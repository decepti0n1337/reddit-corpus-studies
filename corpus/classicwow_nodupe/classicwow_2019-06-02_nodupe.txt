it was a aoe stun that did a ton of damage and chain to everyone around you making it really easy to just stunlock your entire raid at once while dodging deep breath

The Ryzen series of AMD processors are more than enough for Classic WoW and are barely behind the IPC performance of Intel CPUs in the same price range. The only small issue with this PC is the slower ram which hinders Ryzen CPUs a small amount but nothing you're likely to notice.
---
I could look for other PCs if you want but looking at the reviews and name of this brand, I think it's going to be great.
---
I nominate the floss dance ito the game. Let’s make Wow Classic a Battle Royale while we’re at it.

Gotcha. Thanks for the guidance chief!

Sounds valid then. Lot of work of getting up to that point and good luck to you and your group
---
Thanks! I will play how I like!

I was watching a streamer last night who dismissed his moderately happy pet (one good thing?) in SFK and then, decided to do a good amount of...melee.  A friendly sort in his chat suggested at one point he might look into using hunter's mark and shot rotations and then there was a massive and almost absolutely incorrect discussion taking place about the function of disengage.  Followed by a discussion about how his pet did no damage anyhow.  He was specced kinda bizarrely, too.  It was interesting, to say the least.
---
Speaking as a hunter, he also rolled on some things that I wouldn't have.  At least, not without asking the group if it was okay to, first.  Supposedly they played on a private server but I found this hard to believe.  Like, guy.  Communicate with the other people in your party.  I don't know, it was a very weird experience watching him.  Maybe he was just stoned or something but I think MMO etiquette is lost on some people.
---
That trinket did 400 damage.
---
Uh, no. In Vanilla you get a 10% discount for Honored, that's it.
---
That you will ! It is your right. So is free speech. Neither is protection from being full of shit though.
---
Isn't it running on the modern engine/code?  And I think for BFA they changed the requirements so a lot of old PCs couldn't play it anymore.
---
It’s okay, I don’t mind you being full of shit....you do you and all
---
If this is real...Don’t talk to your 7 year old son like that.
---
Tuarens are in generel not good hunters. If i remeber correctly they only have like three fingers and that is just not good for handling arrows and so fourth
---
You're salty that you got proven wrong on multiple accounts. No need to be mad. You saw the DPS numbers yourself afterall; that a Shadow Priest when combined with Shadow Weavings bonus effective DPS results in the priest out damaging every single Warlocks average DPS parse, and provides numbers on par with/very close to a mages average DPS across all 4 major raids. Yet you're still sat there trying to argue. Keep on wasting a global cooldown on a corruption when you could have cast a 4K shadowbolt crit though buddy.
---
Technical stuff ain't for me, so sorry, can't help :'D
---
&gt;In any case, I applaud your efforts.  This just "feels" right from an RPG perspective.
---
Aaah thank you &lt;3 Yeah, I do agree, it feels very fun and unique when you make something work with all the tools you have at your disposal.

It's for the moment when somebody needs a fat Raptor Strike Crit

Naaaah, never loop in Dun Morogh! Every half an hour or so, hearing those heavy, beautiful piano notes crash down from the midst of the silence is just magical.

Also have a 2004 perspective and your just wrong.

Like a RedZone for WoW?  I’d watch that.
---
Thanks. It's an effort of about 100 people so far. The real heroes are the ones sacrificing their own character's leveling and progression to make sure 40 of us are rested and prepared.

It's not. 4GB of VRAM on the GPU is pretty limiting. There's only a 500GB SSD of a no name brand and the power supply is probably questionable. Plus the only 8GB of RAM.

We also need holy power on paladins

If they were going to replace a healer for an item, they would have done it before running the whole instance. If you were booted late in the instance it was most likely due to your performance

AutoHotKey

&amp;#x200B;
---
You can thank me later.
---
The thing is most healers only have 2-4 heals in classic, adding extra ranks to your bar just kinda brings them in line with retail in terms of number of abilities you have to deal with. If you can heal retail you can heal classic.
---
This is a new level of paranoia. Maybe you should work somewhere where you have a healthy relationship with your coworkers. Frankly, if I was that worried, I'd just play something else mid day on Steam or console. Not playing videogames with coworkers is ridiculous. I presume you've been busted for something like this in the past.
---
2.0 = not vanilla
---
There's a very good reason they change the version to X.0 when the pre-release patches come out. Revamped class design and systems make it closer to BC than vanilla despite Outland not being opened.
---
This is an extremely weird sociopathic anti social way to think
---
&gt; Kind of the opposite. You're doing harm to yourself in order to just be at the office to make sure work doesn't get behind.
---
And then you infect the entire office and nothing actually gets done. It's like calling anti-vaxers unselfish.
---
Thankfully I work at a company where any of the management team would tell you to take it easy and go home if you came in properly sick. Also helps that we get a generous amount of sick leave here, I think I have like 17.5 days of paid sick leave accrued at this stage.

I get what you're saying, but KT is literally the end boss of the whole game.  Any gear you get from him is gravy, so you have to be able *get to him* using other gear as well.
---
When you go from super soft core to Ultra Hardcore, the more you Veer towards hardcore, the smaller the player base will be who can actually adjust their mindset to once again appreciate that Ultra Hardcore effort to reward system. This is a business for blizzard, they are trying to attract players, so of course they are not going to stray too far into hardcore territory.
---
Besides, the private server Community is mostly responsible for getting this project off the ground and done. The private server Community adores classic just the way it is.
---
Well its from Nost, so it's not THAT old. I double checked the math and its 100% correct.
---
You sound a little salty is all I’m going to say
---
If what you're asking is if I ever played vanilla when it was current, then no, I never did.  How am I wrong?  These were all common features of pre-WoW MMORPGs.
---
are they buffed in this version of classic?
---
You will be able to play however you want, if you will be able to decide what kind of Guild you join and what people you become friends with. You're trying to use an unquantifiable metric to gauge your exact experience in the future.
---
Lol, shadow priests are ABSOLUTELY not going to be brought to speedruns.
---
woa, spoilers? ;)
---
Hahaha I thought the number one thing about classic was the community?  You just said maybe don’t add someone in case they suck.
---
Id argue that thunderfury is still better. Hungercold would be the sword for offhand that replaces the BWL one
---
Because expeting you to work when sick is madness. WoW (and other games) are not in any way comparable to office work. We play games to relax and have fun, ie. it's not taxing. Work is. If work wasn't taxing and instead was fun and relaxing we wouldn't be playing WoW at all and just work all day.
---
Yeah sums up my company. 
---
Also cheaper for the company if I take a sick day or two rather than coming in and getting others infected. Then they have to take sick leave too.
---
Insulting, old theory-crafting must have been wrong because people repeat stuff? They still repeat false information. People playing real vanilla had the actual game to collect data from, while it was live. There has been no better environment to verify theory crafting since the current beta.
---
You’re giving your criticism on a game you never played? 
---
Would you listen to someone giving you law advice if they weren’t a lawyer?
---
If you're quick enough you can suicide before other people get in combat if they didn't already get heal or buff aggro.  Bit less embarrassing.
---
the range of everything, melee and ranged, is based on the edge of your hitbox. so tauren hunters' minimum range is also pushed out 2 yards. their deadzone is still the same size in a straight line (3 yards between max melee range and minimum ranged attack range) but it is set back 2 yards farther than other races. so the tauren deadzone is actually larger, because it's a larger radius circle.
---
Back in vanilla i did 2 nightelfs for leveling and stuck with one all the way through to wotlk. For my opinion, I liked teldrassil but once you got to the mainland I hated every zone in the western kingdoms for leveling. There's some things you just have to go there for like waterlords, world boss, dire maul, aq raids, zul farrak etc. But overall the whole eastern continent is much nicer and I enjoy those zones better.
---
&gt;all mechanics would still be present if they reduced it to say 250 or 300ms, but it would feel a lot less clunky.
---
Yeah and while we're at it, let's add LFR as well. You can still look for raids the normal way but this way it'll go more smoothly.
---
I sense an Alliance bias.
---
I was playing some private server today as alliance as the only healer in WSG.  Of course there was a ret paladin being worthless in there as well.  Even after 15 years it became evident that I still think ret paladins are a waste of space.
---
I agree, the playerbase is smaller for a more hardcore game, but my point is it exists, and it has been actively ignored by developers.  There's money to be made here.
---
I applaud the pserver community for getting us here.  Without them we wouldn't have even this.  I'm not advocating for changing classic, I'm on board with no changes.  This was more about perspective than discussions about changes.
---
As long as you promise to solo and for the love of god never raid with anyone, as you'll be a massive drain on whatever group you're in.

I came to that conclusion because that’s how it works in game. Ease up on the caps if you don’t know what you’re talking about jeez.

Dear god. Well if its fun for that guy then all power to you all.
---
There weren't any prominent Fury dps warriors raiding on my server. People were playing around with 2H slam builds but I'd say 90% of the Warriors on my server were Prot tanks or Mortal Strike Warriors. People joked around about Fury a lot from what I remembered.
---
Sounds like a projection. Post history is a thing.
---
By my own experience, most of tanks have their own pocket healers (I am usually one of those even my spec is Ret. A Ret with a healing gear can heal any dungeons up to BRD) and vice-verca (healers have always some good tanks in their friendlist). Usually, a party should always start with a tank and healer together to look for damage dealer: it's more efficient.
---
Truthfully I would just inform them of the caster pieces you intend to roll on so there are no surprises.  Also seeing as you two are the healer and tank I can't picture it being a big deal to find replacements.
---
You're an idiot.
---
Once took a horde crew to do stocks on a PvP server... it was a magical shitshow the likes of which I’ve not seen since.
---
It's tough when someone confronts your delusions, isn't it? We all want to be unique, and we are, but quit being pretentious about the reasons for it. Using hotkeys is not ''hardcore''. Whatever possible reasons you could have for holding that absurd notion, you should absolutely still go ahead and be a clicker - just quit the bloody pretense. This kind of logic and refusal to actually think critically, instead clinging to your personal needs in the face of all reason, is precisely why we have so many absurdities in the world.  
---
Oh well, we're only human, and I'm guessing you only have so much mental will to spent. I know i do. Glhf to you dude =p

The entirety of the western kingdoms sucks to me personally. From everything quests, environment, music, flightpaths. The whole western part of the world is a giant meh for me.

Thank you for your meaningful and informed contribution.  You're an all-star.

---
No doubt he fucked up, but being the first instance in the game I wouldn't give him too much shit for being careless. Reporting it as a bug was the real unacceptable part.
---
Oh boy. 
---
You should see alliance try and do wailing caverns. The death running through STV along with running across the barrens causes so much trouble.
---
&gt;Its success was entirely dependent on two things; it was easy (in other words, not hardcore) compared to its contemporaries, and had the benefit of an existing successful video game franchise behind it.
---
&gt;No two ways about it. It really was the game that people who had never played an MMORPG, or any RPG for that matter, could pick up and play. It was sanitized, it was friendly, it wasn't hard, and if you played Warcraft, you were at the very least curious about it.
---
This is a criticism?
---
​
---
&gt;It's a theme park.
---
&gt;Self-explanatory. No true MMORPG can be anything other than a sandbox.
---
Are you claiming Vanilla WoW was a theme park? Kinda lost me there.
---
&gt;You can't manually allocate stat points, you just get them assigned when you level up.
---
&gt;In other words, there is very little in the way of character customization. Everyone in your class gets the same stat points. This is some straight up hand-holding bullshit. What's that, you rolled a mage and put points into strength because you didn't know what you were doing? Tough fucking luck, re-roll. In short, you can't be spared the of the consequence of fucking up your character because you don't know what you're doing.
---
Wait, so you think talent trees are bad because they don't have enough wasteful stat points? How is that a legitimate criticism?
---
&gt;You have no meaningful way to help your character with tradeskills.
---
&gt;Aside from a handful of end-game items, tradeskilling is a massive time and money sink that does very little to nothing to help your character while leveling. A well-designed tradeskill system encourages social interaction and can be used to meaningfully aid your character as you level. Spamming trade chat letting people know you can craft the very few worthwhile things does neither.
---
You used trade skills *very* poorly if you think they couldn't help characters level.
---
&gt;Instanced dungeons
---
&gt;This is worse because the dungeons are huge, and were in fact designed to not be instanced. Their size only makes sense if there are multiple groups of people in them. Limiting them to a single team results in boring trash clears that take forever, but it's "safe" because it's just you and your carebear buddies in there, and no one will come and hurt your feelings. Which brings me to the next point...
---
You and I have a *very* different conception of what constitutes a "legitimate criticism". There's nothing illegitimate about instanced dungeons, just as there's nothing illegitimate about non-instanced dungeons. You're just speaking from personal preference.
---
&gt;Mob tagging is a joke.
---
&gt;So let me get this straight, the first person/team to do any damage to a mob gets loot rights on it? This is some baby dick shit right here. Loot rights should go to whoever does the most damage (be it a team or individual). You want to loot that mob, even if you hit it first? You better out-damage me.
---
​Yeah, fuck healers and solo players! They don't deserve any items at all!
---
&gt;Loot rights
---
&gt;Related to the above. After you win loot rights, they're yours until the mob decays. What? No. After you close the loot window, it should be a free for all. If you kill a mob and don't loot, after a few minutes it should be a free for all.
---
I... guess this is something that could have been implemented? Not exactly much of a scathing critique.
---
&gt;Shared mob XP
---
&gt;If I were designing a social game, I can think of very few things to discourage people from teaming up that would be better than mobs having a set XP value and then splitting it among team members. A mob should be worth a certain XP regardless if you are killing it alone or with four other people. Make teaming mean something other than getting dungeon gear.
---
Teaming allows you to spread out more, tag more mobs, clear them more easily, sustain more easily, accommodate each others' weaknesses, *and* the rate of XP sharing isn't proportional to the number of players, so if a 5-man kills 5 mobs, they'll get more experience each than if any one had killed one mob. There are already a buttload of benefits to open-world grouping. All you're describing is a scenario in which the game becomes unplayable if you *don't* have a 5-man group at all times.
---
&gt;Corpse looting
---
&gt;There should be consequences for death in the open world beyond the minor inconvenience of dying.
---
10-minute corpse runs, armor damage, lost clearing progression, and in the case of PvP, lost loot and resource nodes are more than "minor inconveniences". WoW's gear system would have made corpse looting an impossible task. Corpse looting can only be a stable part of a metagame if gear is extremely easy to replace while naked.
---
&gt;Twinking is a joke.
---
&gt;Twinking in WoW: do you meet the level requirement to wear the item? Then CONGRATULATIONS! You're an awesome player and you get to wear any gear you want. Pathetic. If I don't have to ladder gear, it's not twinking.
---
I... what?
---
In what universe could a person write these things out and actually claim them to be quote "legitimate, period correct criticisms of WoW"? These are terrible criticisms.
---
Some actual complaint posts from [2004/2007 old Ars Technica WoW forums](https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=267969&amp;start=11960):
---
&gt; “IMO what killed Wow were the patches that added new 40 man dungeons, thus making gear the only way to progress in the game. BWL, AQ and Naxx are just some of the things I never visited as a long-time WoW player, because of my real life schedule and were added only cause the hardcore players whined and moaned about it.”
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; “If only BGs provided some kind of lasting change to the game environment. Right now, they are just another ever-spinning hamster wheel: queue up, kill-or-be-killed, requeue. Rinse and repeat until you've farmed enough honor points for your trinket.
---
&gt; It would be great if your victories or losses somehow affected your world resources. For example, if the Horde won more AB matches for the week, it would mean more "war supplies" were able to get through and vendors would grant an additional 10% discount or something. I'm no game designer, but surely Blizzard could think of a way to make the BGs feel like you're making some kind of difference.”
---
&gt; “Yeah, I would not mind (beneficial) totems with unlimited range+don't break mana regen.
---
The main problem with totems in raiding is this: To do well you have to MOVE. Moving requires recasting totems. Recasting requires breaking mana regen. On an already mana starved class.
---
Ossirian or Buru are good examples. Prophet slghtly less so since at the least you will know where your casters are, but they are not reliable for tanks/melees. Problem is that when the game came out the end game content was not run throug by a zillion people.”
---
&gt; “It just upsets me that they fixed a tree that didn't need fixing and then our teir3 set leans towards +healing. Oh well, I still think they'll spread out our changes to multiple patches so aliance doesn't bitch as much.
---
But really, there is no denying that shamans still need a lot of work to be really useful in raids. We complain because we can easily be replaced by another class. I don't want to do what other classes can do, I want to be a utility man that can help raise the bar so that everyone's weakness isn't so weak.”
---
&gt; “All i want for xmas as a rogue:
---
&gt; Add a viable DoT build, the fact that 5pt rupture does less damage than a 5pt evis, and evis can crit is just laughable.
---
&gt; Combined Arms, 30point talent in combat, allowing offhand dagger to be used for BS/ambush (those skills just say Requires Daggers) with offhand penalties.
---
&gt; Remove some of our dodge bonuses and replace them with parry. In PvP Dodge == death. In PvE (endgame) what is there really to dodge? We cannot dodge AoE so its kidna pointless.”
---
&gt; “The first thing I want is more survivability in pvp and pve. Dodge sucks, not just because of overpower (evasion is actually a great weapon against warriors). It sucks because it's not consistent mitigation like armor is. Yeah, I might dodge a 5k aoe cleave 30% of the time instead of 10% for a warrior, but the other 70% of the time I still die. The fact that dodge sucks somewhat skews itemization, since Blizz values it almost as much as crit. No rogue agrees with that. I usually consider dodge as literally worthless when it comes to judging item value. In pvp, the skills that help our survival (sprint, vanish, and blind) are all useful, but if the cooldowns aren't up you're pretty much screwed. I dislike cooldowns determine the outcome of a fight.
---
&gt; I want a talent review to get rid of all the worthless crap in our trees. I'd also like some of the talents moved to where they make more sense. Some bug fixes would be nice too.
---
&gt; And most of all, I'd like more utility in PVE. I just want rogues to bring something to the table that can't be replaced by a dps warrior or hunter. This is something the CMs have really been dissonant about though. Caydiem said that rogues have no utility other than DPS, but that their DPS should be balanced around their disadvantages. But Tseric said that the reason rogues aren't unequivocally top DPS is that they have other utility, and that the utility would be nerfed if DPS were increased. I'm not optimistic that rogues will see any significant changes.”

Sholazar Basin is pretty great too. After leving through lots of arctic environments, it is a nice change of pace to something that is much more temperate.

---
I was a hardcore raider in vanilla that saw everything through Naxx. I can say that casuals can have fun, but retail WoW is much better geared to it.
---
How do I know? I was a hardcore vanilla player because I was 21 with few responsibilities of any kind. Today I’m 35, married with two toddlers and managing 15 engineers at work — Classic, while cool at the time, is not as approachable as retail. Not by a long shot.
---
We had a guild leader who literally never hit 60.  
---
He was mega casual, constantly got characters to 40-50 before rerolling.  
---
Obviously most duties fell to raid leaders and such so he was only really guild leader in name, but the point is there's nothing controlling your pace but yourself.  
---
If you want to raid as a less common spec, find a guild that will have that. There will be plenty of them.
---
Why are you even here tbh
---
Nice 2004 perspective you got there. 
---
It’s not a 2004 perspective just because you’re playing a game from 2004 in the year 2019.
---
Your post wants change...
---
I also remember reading that the original intention for DK was that you'd get to a specific level as any class, then there would be a quest or something where your character died and was reborn as a DK.
---
I agree on most of your points wow was never a hardcore mmorpg it never pretended to be. Nor was it as grindy as most other games. This is some of what made it a hitt among a large population. And wow certainly was not perfect. It has tons of problems and bad design. I'll argue that tbc fixed alot of the problems in the game (and added a few new ones). I still want the game unchanged for me it's a nostalgia thing. I for one whold love a new mmorpg from blizzard that takes best part of the design philosophys from all the expantions maby in the starcraft universe
---
15 years as the most successful MMO in the history of video games with no competition to even come close and you think they're doing everything wrong.
---
Yeah, you're an idiot.
---
Then they should make sure it is implemented correctly - not remove it all together.
---
Its existence has a big effect on balance in the game, for better or for worse. Removing it would be a huge change and it would just not be vanilla anymore.
---
And likely most players never actually comprehensively read it. "Which direction? Get what or kill who and how many? Got it." \*accept\*
---
Filthy horde scum!
---
The argument isn't that spell batching wasn't in classic, it's that in the beta the intentional implementation of it has too large of a window for spells to overlap.
---
Thank you, this was actually really interesting to read.  The class complaints are particularly interesting, because their perspective is that of a more traditional RPG (rogue should DoT, for example).
---
You could also not be a sperglord and enjoy playing with people who are a little less skilled. You can also be an adult and know that they understand that just because you're on a sick day doesn't mean you're bedridden.

OP is asking for Blizzard to double check that spell batching is accurate to the way it was in vanilla. It is not a part of the BFA client and they had to create it from scratch. This post has nothing to do with changes or nochanges.
---
Yes they are
---
That post is literally challenging the fact, that spell batching is set correctly right now. It really feels, like it's much slower, than it actually was back then. If not, well, ok. If yes, than "NO CHANGES REEEE" and let's fix it, so it's actually accurate.

Op said they never played original vanilla, aka just move along and ignore the post as it's pretty much irrelevant?
---
It is literally the first dungeon you run on horde. First time I ran it on a p server I hadn't run any wow instance in over a decade. Wiping is completely understandable.
---
These people need to realize that not everyone has been playing on a private server this whole time. Making dumb mistakes on your first instance run is not only understandable but expected.
---
That would be an interesting test, but I don't think that can work unless the priest already has a magic debuff on them.  Otherwise they physically can't dispel.  So in otherwords the game will have to register the spell landing prior to casting the dispel.
---
It would be an interesting test for sure though with say rank 1 frost bolt debuffs applied.
---
exactly, doesn't make much sense lol
---
I wouldn't call a run that's 37% slower than the record and doesn't even make the top 10 a "speedrun".
---
Great post. He won't reply though because it doesn't suit his agenda.
---
I wish my wife would play wow :(
---
they already confirmed that the hitbox is correct
---
I have a love/hate relationship with Desolace.  
---
It's absolutely amazing for experience, loads of quests. Some hidden-style click the object out in the middle of nowhere, a few "This item starts a quest" drops. The issue is the place is just bland, the Kodo quest is a pain, the Kolkar grind is a pain and if that's not enough like 5+ of the quests are in the water, where you can't eat/drink.  
---
Love how efficient it is in terms of one zone that you stay in and get 2/3 levels in, hate how close it was to being amazing. I almost wish it was worse so I could flat out hate it, but instead it just hovers right on the edge of being something great.
---
No he isn’t. In fact you no changes people are allowing change if the behavior isn’t accurate which is what the op is wanting to be verified.
---
If it isn’t functioning as vanilla then that is a change.
---
A proper dumbass post.
---
I would have at least respected your dumbass opinions if you actually played the game... but alas - you didn't? LOL.
---
Lost my actual shit when you said "played private servers" - you do know that they aren't the real game right? 
---
Gee whizz.
---
Menethil to theramore you don't need to go to STV to ratchet
---
I meant Dampen Magic
---
Haha! Clearing the entirety of BWL in 32 minutes isn't a speed run? Now you're just grasping at straws. World records don't matter, because a million other things can determine what makes that a success or not. 
---
The fact of the matter is, you said no SPriests in speed runs, and then I linked you a video of a Spriest in a speedrun. You're a piss poor attempt at a troll.
---
That’s probably Dives’ car.
---
And 10% for rank 3
---
It works the same in my addon as it does for the default ui. Its just a different look.
---
That's neat, I registered and got to look through the list of others from my old server who has registered. Was fun to see some of the old guild names I remember. Thank you for sharing!
---
&gt; Clearing the entirety of BWL in 32 minutes isn't a speed run? 
---
Correct.
---
You didn’t experience it in 2004-2007 with us, you played on a private server... that’s like someone saying they understand sex because they watch porn.
---
!RemindMe 79 Days
---
I'm guessing a streamer mentioned this today? All of a sudden there has been a few posts talking about this. 
---
I feel the window is slightly too large at the moment, but 99% of the time it's not noticable. This is also one of the aspects of the beta they're looking at and it could be tuned before release.
---
Which has no bearing on what zone to choose whilst leveling.
---
Are there a large contingent of people who never played Vanilla that are excited for it? And if so...are they just hyped because other people are telling them to be so?
---
You can definitely still heal as shadow, you don't even get shadow form until level 40 meaning you can always cast heals.
---
Go shadow for the extra damage and you guys can tag team dots and you will kill things infinitely faster just make sure you try for last hits to keep mana
---
Trolls have bow skill and attack speed racial, much better for PvE, Orc for PvP though.
---
I'm not waiting for shit lol
---
Dude when I started playing at 13 I played as a clicker AND moved my character with arrow keys...
---
This is exactly the path with no issues whatsoever... or play on a carebear server and it’s never an issue.
---
I just tried signing up.  It's an explicit part of the process, you are deliberately giving public information.
---
I think I get it now, thanks  ;0
---
You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what Vanilla looked like. All I know is that it was the one thing I ever wanted. Someone took it away from me. And seven expansions couldn't fill the hole that Vanilla left behind.
---
You want something like Clique, allowing you to bind most common spells to your mouse with modifiers. Something like if you Left Click on a target it casts Flash of Light rank 2, if you press Ctrl + Left Click it casts Flash of Light rank 6. Add other modifiers and other mouse buttons and you suddenly have ton of free keybinds.
---
Thank you for making this. It's pretty amazing! :D
---
Bro, maybe she just has big bones, or a thyroid disorder
---
In vanilla Clearcasting 100% proc’d *on cast*. You would *always* get the sound, animation &amp; buff of Clearcasting immediately on cast, before any missiles had been launched at the target. You could tap Arcane Missles and immediately cancel it, yet get Clearcasting. And Clearcasting has never ever proc’d for me at any other time in the channeling of Arcane Missiles than immediately at the start.
---
Absolutely. I have only used it a total of few times, but I'm already stressed out for having to get the characters right. Leveling to 60 and then getting fed up by something on character is a nightmare. If I get in on either of the next two 2 stress tests I'm going to try out faces and hairs so I don't have to try to do that when the placeholders open.
---
The problem is we don't have a server list yet.
---
Hard to get people to a certain server (once pve/pvp rp/non-rp) if noone knows what server they are going to.
---
&gt;HP is irrelevant
---
I've never seen something so wrong in my life.
---
&gt; the fact that 5pt rupture does less damage than a 5pt evis
---
But it doesn't...
---
Hey look, [another speed run with a shadow priest](https://youtu.be/eWeT5y1ciHk?t=1282), this time 24 minutes! But oh wait, its 5 minutes slower than the most modern world record so it's definitely not a speed run anymore :(
---
Oof but the wetlands is scary as well. Spiders and crocs
---
Rant: back when the black market auction house was released I camped out for over 150 days straight to buy frostfire and the only thing that ever came up was the belt.
---
To put this into perspective, I saw most entire sets multiple times. Yet couldn’t even get a single piece of frostfire.
---
That comment might be from a different patch.
---
Glad we can regroup again.
---
Yes... just like every other game you play...
---
No one is going “omg I lose everything I have worked for on WoW if I switch to fortnite”
---
The stuff is still there. You’re playing a completely different game.
---
I thought the blindfolds were available for male night elves as a face customization? if course still not a real demon hunter though...
---
That first picture is so not 2005.
---
No sense in limiting yourself imo. Especially when it doesn't break the bank to go for an card with more VRAM.
---
If they're at work themselves, it's unlikely they would be logging into classic themselves during work to see if you're online, lol.
---
Back before a certain patch (1.4?) you could buy 100% speed mounts that looked like regular horses, no glowing eyes or armor on the animal. Blizz got rid of the option to sell them so some players that played long enough had the older looking mounts but this time I don’t think they will exist :/
---
We're talking about efficiency here. You're going to eventually run into problems when the foundational code that dictates how systems work make your new idea fail. Changing that foundational code has huge knock on effects that just make it not worth doing when you're working on something as big as WoW.
---
It's the reason why they use new engines and start fresh with successor titles, more efficient to achieve your goal.
---
You don’t need to know that to start forming a guild and building its community. Only thing to know is wether the guild plans to be on a PvP or PvE server. The actual server name can be figured out later by the guild when the list is known.
---
battle.net client allows you to be invisible... what you DONT want them to know is your INGAME NAME, that's something you cannot make invisible to them
---
You want to create a guild for a game that is months away without any server list?
---
Alright enjoy being farmed by holypaladins enabling absurd plays whilst horde has windfury totem in premades.
---
When are we going to get a god damn sticky for this site?
---
This is rly hard to pull off in an mmorpg but I would love rp elements like this in the future
---
Warth plate \*HNNNNGH\*
---
\&gt;  This is a criticism? 
---
Preemptive.  Surely someone was going to come along and say "well, if it was so bad, why did it get so popular?!"
---
\&gt;  Are you claiming Vanilla WoW was a theme park? Kinda lost me there. 
---
Absolutely, yes.  It's *less* of a theme park than current retail is, but no less a theme park.  You have rigid classes, instance dungeons, no manual point allocation, and so on.  All features of a theme park.  Like, the literally commonly understood elements of a theme park.  I don't mean to talk down to you here, but you've lost me if you're claiming this game was a sandbox.
---
\&gt;  Wait, so you think talent trees are bad because they don't have enough wasteful stat points? How is that a legitimate criticism? 
---
No, no, not talent trees.  Actual stat points.  You know, like strength, stamina, agility, and so on.  Yes, it is a legitimate criticism.  Not being able to fine tune your character and just having the game auto assign your stats is hand-holdy garbage.
---
\&gt;  You used trade skills *very* poorly if you think they couldn't help characters level. 
---
Feel free to inform me.
---
\&gt;  You and I have a *very* different conception of what constitutes a "legitimate criticism". There's nothing illegitimate about instanced dungeons, just as there's nothing illegitimate about non-instanced dungeons. You're just speaking from personal preference. 
---
Yes there is, especially when they're poorly designed (designed to *not* be instanced, this is a fact the lead dungeon designer for the game at the time said, he even wrote a book about it).  Having your own little personal cocoon dungeon so no one else GASP! interrupts you is hand-holding.  Social interaction, it's what MMORPGs are about.  How can you have social interaction in mind-numbingly boring trash clears with four other people?
---
\&gt;  ​Yeah, fuck healers and solo players! They don't deserve any items at all!
---
This was never a problem in any game that I'm aware of that did this.  I actually played Anarchy Online and this was exactly how it was.  There was an etiquette to it.  Even opposite faction players would rarely, if ever, kill steal.  It was considered exceptionally rude.  Again, the playerbase polices itself.  It comes up with the social rules.  That's a community.  What is wrong with community?
---
\&gt;  I... guess this is something that could have been implemented? Not exactly much of a scathing critique. 
---
I'm not going for "scathing" nor do I know where you got the idea I was.
---
\&gt;  Teaming allows you to spread out more, tag more mobs, clear them more easily, sustain more easily, accommodate each others' weaknesses, *and* the rate of XP sharing isn't proportional to the number of players, so if a 5-man kills 5 mobs, they'll get more experience each than if any one had killed one mob. There are already a buttload of benefits to open-world grouping. All you're describing is a scenario in which the game becomes unplayable if you *don't* have a 5-man group at all times. 
---
Yeah, I know it is proportional, but it's still less than killing solo.  It shouldn't be.  Again, I've played games where this was the exact setup and guess what, no problems, no chaos, game was totally playable solo.
---
\&gt;  10-minute corpse runs, armor damage, lost clearing progression, and in the case of PvP, lost loot and resource nodes are more than "minor inconveniences". WoW's gear system would have made corpse looting an impossible task. Corpse looting can only be a stable part of a metagame if gear is extremely easy to replace while naked. 
---
To my knowledge, being killed in pvp did not damage your gear.  At least it doesn't on pservers.  I mean, you don't even lose XP when you die.  You just die.  
---
\&gt;  In what universe could a person write these things out and actually claim them to be quote "legitimate, period correct criticisms of WoW"? These are terrible criticisms. 
---
I'm not sure what you don't understand about what I said about twinking.  There are no stat requirements to wear any gear.  Like you don't get a plate armor chest that says "req: 100 stam, 100 strength to wear."  You can just wear it no matter what if you meet the level req.  Laddering gear.  Very common in old school MMORPGs.  Which I gather from your post, you never played.
---
Did you watch the video? I dunno how they get 24 minutes out of a video that doesn't kill Ragnaros until minute ~32.
---
Which again, is 30+% slower than the Vanilla record and thus irrelevant.
---
They no doubt will still have the $15 appearance change option. So the option to change your hair will still be there but behind a paywall. 
---
It's why i'm not against some changes, having the barbershop just saves you $15 also adds a nice gold sink.
---
If you have to point out that they are lynching a black guy instead of, you know the lynching itself, then there's something wrong in you.

That wasn't Stormwind
---
Never played vanilla, but I leveled during TBC and I loved it. I assume the lvling experience in classic is close to TBC
---
Respawns are completely different in a lot of places, only one I care about though is the gy skip near gnomergan and that’s in the beta as well
---
Did you not read why it was a success to begin with?
---
You can advertise.  I would like to create a guild for the super casual gamers.  The ones that played during vanilla that now have families and less to time be hardcore but still want to progress in pve and pvp.  Have fun etc.  We will be alliance.   So really then it's just picking a server once the lists are out.
---
Guilds have been forming without a server list since forever. Form your community, get everyone on Discord, then when the list is known the guild leader says go to server X. Easy and nothing new.
---
Blink worked great for falls you just had to learn the timing and it was earlier than it intuitively would be. Sure there was a small risk you miss it and die but there was also a decent risk you use it and fall through the world when starting on the ground lol.
---
Does mouseover work with classic or Luna?
---
Just sharing my opinion.
---
Paladins don’t downrank due to how efficient flash of light is with the mana return from critting.
---
Is fury better TPS than Bear?
---
Did the female undead rogues have the same melee animations they do now? They're really good.
---
So all the things I mentioned actually did happen when vanilla was current?
---
thank you very much, i like this database much better than wowhead
---
Well your idiot criticisms certainly wouldn't have helped.
---
tauren are the chadliest horde race so you should always play them for war/hunt/sham
---
Easy? You think it’s as simple as just pick a server that all 40+ people will agree on? What if people don’t want to play on XXX server? What if people don’t want to play in 3 months?
---
You don’t even know if these people will make it past level 20. 
---
But sure. It’s as simple as “go to server X” and that’s it.
---
Yes, I didn't play because there were more hardcore options back then.  Why would I play the training wheels MMORPG of 2004 when I didn't like what it had to offer?
---
Seems right to me. It was a massive pain in the ass in 2005 and it behaves just as crappy as I remember it in 2019.
---
I still have it in my launcher plus i got another PTR account but when trying to log in on the new account it says "no servers ".

Any idea why it isnt removed from the launcher?

---
Your post is the reason why this sub is garbage for class advice.
---
Correct
---
Thank you, you're seemingly the only person that gets it.
---
The server doesn't update your position while you're in the air. You died for the same reason why you should never ever ever jump when pvping against rogues.
---
I think I used 1 through 4 then clicked everything else. Those number keys were so far away!
---
It doesn't work this way as far as I'm aware, people have tried different things in the beta
---
You must have downloaded some really weird torrent brother. I've never had any issues with private servers but have gotten hit for movies right away.
---
Yeah, this would annoy me very fast
---
Bow skill is only for Rhok'Delar until Ashjre'thul and you can make up 3% hit on gear. You can't get 40% stun resist. So if you plan to PvP at all, orc is better. Berserking makes them the better choice for solely PvE though.
---
Or... just be up front with them like an adult
---
You can be sick as a dog and still sit in a chair moving a mouse around lmao
---
You're picking on the minor details to try and poke holes in it. For starters they don't even hit the first mob until 2 minutes in, and there's a minute at the end of the video after rag is dead. So thats 29 minutes. Sure the title is misleading, but thats still a sub 30 minute run. Plus, you do realise i've already linked you multiple examples of a shadow priest being present in a speed run, and can find many more if I wanted to right? If you think killing these raids in 30 minutes when they took 3-4 hours to clear during vanilla isn't a speedrun... then I dunno what to tell you man. You're blind to the facts.
---
The delay on vendors and looting was centainly there back in the day. And the window feels large but it's also what it was back then. And you had people dying after recieving a heal all the time in vanilla.
---
5% hp increase is irrelevant in comparison to having 1/3 odds of resisting a stun, yes.
---
Guys, quit the books, he played Anarchy Online which has less current players than a single WoW guild.

It's how it worked in 2005. It's what we nagged Blizzard to put back in. It's too late to complain about it now.

---
Someone else gave a good explanation but to me Darkshore is more of a rainy coastal environment like the Pacific Northwest coast (not the Cascade mountains or Seattle/Portland, but the actual coast), it rains there something like 70% of all days, and has a mix of sandy beaches and sharp bluffs. Love it.
---
The dark, gloomy with a sinister feel is different to me, and applies more to tirisfal/duskwood if that makes sense. Different ambiences to me.
---
Most of the things you say are true, but there are some corrections.
---
1) You really dont have to worry about consumables and repair costs. If you're a main tank, you have to be committed to the game, so you will end up gaining enough gold just from playing the game a lot. And if not, guild banks often sponsor main tanks. You do need to be committed all the way from start to finish though.
---
2) There are some spots for pure fury warriors, but usually yeah, you have to be ready to tank if needed.
---
3) /sit still works in Classic due to the batching system. However, it's abit more annoying to do. Even if it works, I believe arms is superior due to world pvp, sweeping strikes and more utility.
---
4) It's true that gear is a big factor for warriors, but even if you're in a pre-raid BiS PvP gear set, you will be a force to reckoned with if you know what you're doing. It takes experience though and engineering/consumables are required.
---
5) It's true, a good warrior will always be in demand. Hardcore guilds can bring even 20+ warriors to speedruns.
---
6) Warrior priest is decent. The priest doesn't need to use PW: Shield in order to be useful. You get stamina buff, dispells and heals. Also priest doesn't share any gear with you unlike paladins.
---
Playing with a pala is more efficient if he doesn't go pure healing, so you need to share gear.

Depends on the gear level; Bear starts strong, especially with [Manual Crowd Pummeler](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9449), but once warriors get some gear from BWL and beyond they can pull ahead.

Loch Modan is where I'd live
---
The sepulchre really bring back a lot of good memories. I love all the undead areas because of the music and creepy vibe.
---
In the current meta, warriors are the most powerful DPS class, the best tank class and also a force to be reckoned with it PvP, especially if you have support classes behind you.
---
2H fury is strong on the Horde side, but dualwield beats 2H fury on Alliance side. It's still a viable choice though.
---
Arms is really a PvP/dungeon spec.
---
Not going to main Alliance, but black and red are the colours of the Brotherhood of Nod, so you'd have one thing to lure me in. But the symbol on your tabard has to be a scorpion.

It's vanilla. No changes. No cry baby kids ruining this for the rest of us. You did that with previous expansions leading to the ruin of the game. No changes. Don't like? Play bfa.

Why is it necessary to exclude players who played later than classic? From my guild a few people registered who joined us in TBC/Wrath. But it's still nice to be able to reconnect with them too.

---
DID YOU GUYS HAVE TO PULL THEM ALL?!?
---
Arcanite Reaper &gt; Dreadforge Retaliator. 2H fury is better than dualwield in MC.
---
For dual-wield, the best is Axe of the Deep Woods + Flurry Axe. However both of those are BoE epics, so it will be expensive.
---
What up Frostmane Final Countdown we up in here!

Would have been faster if they'd taken any other DPS class besides that fucking shadow priest...

Oh so it’s not about removing unarmored lvl 40 mounts?

While some more dedicated players may want to start now I think the intended use of the sub will be post launch for established guilds and people looking for an established guild
---
I'd wait for the driver to come out just to ask "WTF did I do?".
---
It's literally just the vanilla sized batching windows. You just remember playing on a connection that was so insanely shit that it would be measured in Kb/s.
---
Internet has gotten faster by a factor of around 100 since 2004. That's going to change how it feels significantly.
---
You can now get 100 fps trivially when you used to struggle to get 10 as well.
---
if they dont like a server thats silly, its just a name
---
also if they dont wanna play then they dont join i dont see the issue.....
---
Ok.
---
It *is* that simple. If you've set up a Guild group, the faction and server type has already been decided. Then it's only a matter of picking one of the servers of your preferred type and announcing it. Did that in Wildstar and WoW when I ran guilds.
---
[if]losing argument [run] ad-hominem.jpg 
---
Believe it or not. You keep losing elections because your condescending grand standing to cover up your lack of arguments fools no one.
---
It requires alot of gold farming for sure.
---
At lvl 60, you need to farm gold for epic mount, Lionheart Helm and Titanic Leggings. The consumable costs are also high, especially if you want to flask up every raid (most guilds don't require that though).

You don’t seem to understand how servers work. They are a lot more meaningful than “just a name”

Thanks. :)
---
Doesn't matter if it goes faster when they're already clearing Vanilla raids in under 30 minutes. Proof enough that a Shadow Priest is more than viable. You even agreed with those facts earlier with your own math. You're officially the [Worst troll on the planet. This award goes to you](https://funattic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3-6.jpg). Peace ✌️
---
That's how some guildies and I did it back in vanilla. Was still a long trip to get there. We did RFK/RFD too.
---
You're patently wrong about dungeons. They had decided to make dungeons instanced well before a single one was completed. 
---
They made most of the dungeons very large because they were afraid of not having enough content. It wasn't until very late in the development cycle that they realized players didn't like the huge, sprawling dungeons that took multiple attempts to fully complete. That's why BC dungeons were all like Scarlet Monastery. 
---
This is all from WoW Diaries by John Staats.
---
You don't need prot spec for any dungeons in Vanilla.
---
You can easily tank all dungeons in either arms/fury. Arms is the best spec for dungeon tanking due to sweeping strikes. You can use 2h to sweeping strikes + whirlwind and then switch to shield.
---
Ok. Have fun when your GM picks a dead server.
---
Blueboy doesn't just want you to know he is swoll, but that he has that tang...
---
Okay, by that logic classic should never exist since it had fewer players than later expansions.  More money = better than, right?

My memory is a little fuzzy as it was a long time ago, but most, if not all of the things I said were also the case in Dark Age of Camelot, Everquest, Ultima Online, and so on.  
---
In any case, this has little to do with what you're talking about.  I'm talking about things that make vanilla objectively not hardcore, not how popular it was.
---
Additionally, you seem a little worked up and very emotionally invested in this.  Don't get your balls in an uproar just because I called a video game you like not hardcore enough.
---
5/5 Deflection is about as good as cruelty, so I suggest going Arms straight away.
---
It gives you 5% parry, which negates damage and thus increases your uptime, but it also increases your DPS due to parry haste.

Tanaris was the prettiest to me. At least the most soothing. I remember, I think it was back in BC or Wrath, pretty stoned out of my mind and sitting my guy for an hour around where that dinosaur skeleton is, just looking at the sunset. Ashenvale isn't too far.
---
My favourite was definitely Darkshire, though. It has the best ambiance and terrific quest lines.
---
Imagine getting so triggered that someone doesnt like your idol.
---
Then go for it! Play whatever spec you feel will be most useful. There's no wrong choice
---
WW axe is better due to the slower swing time and 5% crit from axe specialization. The weapon skill doesn't matter much, since you shouldn't be fighting higher lvl mobs anyways.
---
A MUST HAVE software is:
---
ISboxer !!  
---
I have tested this and will be using this for a 5-boxing squad in Classic. It is by far the best software on the market! It cost a bit money but is very cheap imo
---
Tauren master race
---
Living out in the woods with no electricity is hardcore, doesn't mean anyone wants to fucking do it.
---
WoW has plenty of hardcore elements to satiate that population. A population that would much rather have millions and millions of non-hardcore players in their world than none at all.

Calling someone is retarded is now more triggered than avoiding an entire chat room because of the mere mention of someone. 🤡🌎

Is corruption affected by it and does it consume charges?
---
Way less scary than STV though
---
My mistake, but you're right, that's who I am referencing (John Staats).  If I remember correctly, he said they copied the scale of dungeons from other games which didn't use instanced dungeons, not realizing it would result in...well, what we have now.
---
No, it was completely random for damage and healing effects. The only player cast spells that might have had any priority were interrupts but I'm not even sure about those because there's conflicting information.
---
Specifically. The point people always bring up with a wow 2 is losing all thier current progression. Please stay on topic. No one is talking about moving to FF or Fortnite.

lmao, what? Everyone has the chance of rolling on a dead server, unless you plan on waiting 3 months before playing Classic WoW.
---
Paladin has plenty of burst with reck bomb tho &gt;:)
---
In all seriousness, mage is what you want first, as leveling and farming should be a breeze and grant you almost twice the amount of a stable gold income. 
---
However, I'm gonna roll paladin, as tanking dungeons like brd will be a blast, and they can be a big time sink, as they can use many niche builds which need items to farm and to shine in very niche things. Think about spelladin, reckbomb, SoCru, control ret, holy reck, even support prot with nightfall is a possibility. Even though these builds can compete only to a certain extent, I will have fun playing and trying them anyway.
---
if i were to gather together some friends, (basically what everyone is doing right now) you choose a server together. Obviously you pick a local one, or one that allows you to play at a time that works for you. then you decide on the server type
---
once you have done that you basically have a handful of servers (unless you choose RPPVP)
---
if for some reason someone doesnt want to play on that server, then they have no good reason. When choosing a server at launch its not like you will know how good a server is. I dont think anyone will until phase 2 since thats when the layers should be combined.

---
No doubt my ass, they went out of their way to re-code spell batching to make it authentic, I don't think they are "no doubt" going to have a $15 appearance change option. Calling bullshit on that one, no source, nothing.
---
Depends;
---
If you want to enjoy having Engineering while leveling then go for it.
---
If you want to focus on hitting 60 fast with as much gold in your pocket then just grab Mining/Skinning and vendor everything you pick up on the way.
---
I stopped reading after the second paragraph.  40 player raiding is nearly twice as dynamic as 25 player raiding so the complexity is MESURABLY greater in vanilla.  
---
If you are talking about boss mechanics, all I have to say is: ability pruning, and threat is no longer a mechanic.

You are wrong.

But some people do want to live in the woods, and I wouldn't tell them to stop if that's what they wanted.

WoW, even classic, is objectively not hardcore for the reasons I stated.  And you don't need millions.  I mean, even 50,000 players of an MMORPG would necessitate more than one server.  If you're going to tell me there isn't even one server's worth of people who want to play a hardcore MMORPG, I would disagree.
---
You cached me off guard.
---
Never mind... im of practicing. Cya.
---
Did they test spell power scaling on it?
---
Mining plus herb is kinda meh since you can't track both nodes
---
I'd keep Mining especially if you're going to level in Ungoro.
---
Troll and Dwarf hunters. Especially  bow trolls.
---
+1 for something I did not know.

Sounds more like you want to be carried lol.

Ashenvale &amp; Desolace. Always skip both as horde
---
Iirc there were 1 set of glaives in the game that were useable by players, and 1 pair with the same model used for gm only warglaives of azzinoth.
---
It seems it does, it did 80 damage. R3 Sbolt average +20% damage from ISB doesn't match up to that kind of damage which is in the video.
---
Looks like we hit a nerve
---
They already said they're going to be new servers.
---
While I agree that would be nice that is beyond my skills and I think even for someone who can make it they would probably need to try to monetize it to justify the work it would take which introduces it’s own set of issues

I'll just leave this here once again, seeing as you don't seem to get it.

SOTP DOTS

Hey, I played MMOs since 1999 starting with EverQuest. I agree with most of your post, but some of your views were ones that I also had but changed once I played vanilla WoW for the first time on Nostalrius. I also (regrettably) never picked up WoW when it came out because I was playing the "hardcore" MMOs like EQ, DAoC, and FFXI. To address some of your points:
---
The whole theme park / sandbox comparison isn't really a binary thing, it's more of a spectrum. Yes WoW was further to the theme park side of the scale than the MMOs that preceded it, but it definitely still had sandbox elements. Like a lot of things it's completely up to player preference for where they prefer a game to end up on that scale.
---
Being able to allocate stat points is a nice touch but being able to fuck up your character before you ever started playing the game was pretty antithetical to the game that Blizzard was trying to create. So, it was actually kind of a smart thing for Blizzard to break away from an RPG standard that every MMO that proceeded them used. It was confusing the first time I tried to create a character though, I thought the attribute selection was hidden away somewhere.
---
Besides, stats were mostly irrelevant in EverQuest so the advantage you got from wisely distributing stat points was fairly minimal. This was a bigger deal in Dark Age of Camelot which had a relatively complicated stat allocation system, and the stats you picked actually had a somewhat significant impact on endgame.
---
To be fair this wasn't really the case with any MMO before WoW either. If you're trying to compare to EQ, fuck man tradeskills sucked so badly in that game that they had to implement quests that required you to raise all of your tradeskills up to just to craft royal toilet paper and shit to turn in for super OP gear. It was the only way they could convince players to waste their time on tradeskills.
---
At least WoW had some useful stuff to craft while leveling up, mostly bags and some tailored gear. They didn't do great but they were doing better than the competition.
---
&gt;Instanced dungeons  
---
&gt;This is worse because the dungeons are huge, and were in fact designed to not be instanced.
---
I'm not sure how someone who came from games like EverQuest could describe WoW dungeons as huge. Besides BRD, they're pretty small by comparison.
---
Instanced content vs. non-instanced content is a gameplay discussion that you could write an entire book about. The tl;dr is that there is no such thing as a best system, they both offer really big advantages and disadvantages. I always say that the only real way to tackle this conundrum is to offer both types of content and let the players work out what they want to utilize. Vanilla WoW did this to an extent, but definitely tended to prefer instanced content. Modern MMOs tend to go all-in and make their games either 100% instanced or 100% open world and I think this is a mistake.
---
&gt;So let me get this straight, the first person/team to do any damage to a mob gets loot rights on it? This is some baby dick shit right here. Loot rights should go to whoever does the most damage
---
This is similar to instanced content; there's no perfect answer to this problem. DPS Race has its fair share of problems as well. It favors players who play DPS classes, and people who are better geared. Those are pretty unfair and arbitrary criteria to decide who should get to loot a mob. I didn't like FFXI's tagging system where other players couldn't interact with your mobs at all, but I definitely think tagging is an improvement over the old DPS race style. Ironically, the classic EQ server enforces an "FTE" (first to engage) aka tagging system for raid bosses, even though the game itself is designed to reward loot to the group that does the most damage. So even in the classic EQ community people are realizing that the DPS system is flawed.
---
Yeah sure I'm not sure why corpses don't unlock in WoW. Scavenging other groups' kills for leftover loot was an interesting element of EQ. They could have kept quest drops to not appear unless you were part of the tag. *Shrug*
---
This is really just a balance thing. A major element of WoW was that the developers wanted players to be able to make some progress while playing solo. This wasn't really a thing in previous MMORPGs unless you played very specific "solo-friendly" classes. They went out of their way to design a game where players didn't have to feel absolutely compelled to join a group if they didn't want to. I would say that they probably got the balance off slightly and group exp could have been a bit better in WoW.
---
By the way, EverQuest was *even less forgiving* when it came to splitting exp across a group. I don't even think there was a group bonus until Planes of Power. It was just more efficient to level as a group because soloing sucked in that game, but that had nothing to do with the exp split.
---
Yeah sure. I don't think WoW was going for a hardcore "you lose everything until you get back to your body" system like EQ but it probably could have benefited by stealing DAoC's exp debt system.
---
It's funny to me that oldschool MMO players love twinking but hate stuff like heirloom gear in WoW. It's practically the same thing. If you enjoy the hardcore leveling experience so much, why sully it by equipping your new character with god gear?
---
The thing is, I enjoyed twinking in EQ too. But you also have to consider that WoW also had a PvP element to the game, and twinking kinda shits all over that.
---
But a Shadow Priest is NOT one of the fastest record holders. 39 players are and he was just along for the ride.
---
FFXI did/does this, and it was pretty neat  to check out happenings on different servers.
---
8 years? It was the second Stat squish you dense mother fucker. You are actually an idiot. Stop saying shit if you don't know what you're saying.

Unless it's a completely seperate list or Launcher how would that work since most of them are still around.
---
Pull and kite with arcane shot. Id only ad it to rotation if your full marks with imp arcane. Its been along time ago but I remember a few hunters posting an arcane dmg build using the AQ 40 set. With the arcane explosion trinket from either Razorgore or broodlord I cant quite remember. But I remember their numbers werent nothing to laugh about. I never was interested in AQ 40 hunter set spell dmg on hunter gear kind of un-nerved me. Because look at every gearset or gear for a hunter up to AQ. We never used a sting in raids. There wasnt enough debuff slots and if you made a CoD from a lock drop off because you used a sting wed kick you from the raid. Serpent sting is the worst dot in game. And I never hardly ever used in 5 mans because try to CC a mob with a DoT on it. See my point its a waste. I always believed that dmg modifiers for serpent sting and arcane shot should scaled with the hunters prime attribute for dmg Agility but someone seems to have thought it too much work.
---
We went talking about friends. This is 40+ strangers committing to something months away. Good luck with commitment.
---
But the thyroid is legit bro
---
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT, WHAT? I've been looking for _anyone_ in Ropetown, but I literally haven't been able to catch them logging on for over a year. I still have my old character from that guild over there.
---
If PvP and dueling are important to you, Engineering is a must. I think Tailoring has some BoP stuff that mages want, but I'm not sure if that stuff is relevant for PvPers. 
---
The main thing to consider when taking a crafting profession is it slows down your leveling time. Gathering does too. If you don't care about that though then I'd probably level Engineering as I went.
---
I disagree as several games have done some or all of these and been successful.  EVE exists pretty easily out there.
---
Chance? You think picking a server is Chance?
---
For sure! Just geographically it was a pain for me.
---
Even better nothing you say in any way says I'm wrong. You just got proven to be outright lying then start being a smart ass as a defense.
---
I got through this whole post thinking that you were writing it because you actually played the game when it was current, at least thats how it sounded to me the whole time. If you've really never played it.. this is a troll post. Just another 'this is how - I - would remake vanilla if I could do the changes I want' post. Nothing to see here.
---
I can't remember my guild but I remember my name and server. Hoping to come across some old friends.
---
The fact you think I went off topic shows you arnt here for a discussion.
---
I mean, the project is titled "Vanilla Friends", not "Warcraft Friends". Adding in data for later expansions directly defeats the purpose of the project, in my opinion.
---
There are add-ons that show you every potential node that could spawn. It doesn't show active spawns, but its good enough. Plus by using it, you become familiar with where everything spawns.

Yet your own math proves that the shadow priest is bringing along more dps than all the warlocks and comparative dps to the mages earlier on in this thread once you add in 3 warlocks worth of shadow weaving. Once again, you're a buffoon.
---
WoD had low content but was fun to play that content (raids etc). BFA is shit to play so the content is irrelevant.
---
I'm planning to do mining/skinning while vendoring skins and stashing ore on an alt until I can afford the mount and then drop skinning for engineering.

Going a warrior though, if you aoe grind as a mage you should have more gold than what you get from questing.

It will be way more than a couple quests at the beginning. I'm reminded of WoD launch with the entire server standing around waiting to make their garrison for almost 2 days.
---
Depends on your measure of success. I personally don't call success being as good as 1-2% of the competition.
---
Hmm. If you wanted to PVP, but also be decent in PVE whether DPS or Tank, you think orc or tauren would be a safer bet?
---
&gt; This can’t be working correctly..
---
Welcome to Vanilla! You wanted it to be accurate, well here it is.
---
A (wo)man of culture. MoP was the most cringy looking one but it turned out so good
---
You're getting downvoted because this sub is pretty inhospitable to any content that doesn't fall within like four categories, but there was definitely a measure of stigma against WoW back in the day. I've played MMOs since the days of text-based MUDs, through Everquest and of course WoW. 
---
When vanilla came out, it took the genre by storm but also left a lot of players hesitant because it was the easy, casual MMORPG. Compared to games like UO, EQ and DAoC, WoW was practically made for children. When you die in WoW, you don't even respawn naked and alive half a continent away! What is this, for preschoolers?!
---
One thing's for sure: Classic will look like a joke to those who watch the top 1% on streams. In reality, even on private servers, only something like 20% of the playerbase even clears BWL; but if you get all your impressions from people so invested in the game that they stream it, you'll easily come to think that it's all a joke.
---
The game has so much more publicity these days, so much more information and community interactivity. I remember a time when finding information about a game online was nearly impossible, and though that was mostly in the 90s, it wasn't until Wowhead launched in late vanilla that there was a fully reliable and continuously supported site for all game information. Even Thottbot at the time was built around ideas and guesswork when it concerned anything more advanced than item stats and quest walkthroughs.
---
Isn’t classic built on a relatively recent version of the modern wow engine?
---
Yeah I'm not saying that you should make it. I'm just amazed that we haven't gotten a tool like that in 14+ years. Finding a guild is such a pain in the ass, it hasn't improved much at all in all those years.
---
&gt;Preemptive. Surely someone was going to come along and say "well, if it was so bad, why did it get so popular?!"
---
Kk.
---
&gt;Absolutely, yes. It's less of a theme park than current retail is, but no less a theme park. You have rigid classes, instance dungeons, no manual point allocation, and so on. All features of a theme park. Like, the literally commonly understood elements of a theme park. I don't mean to talk down to you here, but you've lost me if you're claiming this game was a sandbox.
---
No, I meant that I literally didn't understand what you were even arguing. I don't think any MMO ever released is a sandbox by my definition of the term, unless you count something like *Minecraft* as an MMO. Sandboxes allow for gamebreaking behaviors that could never be tolerated in a multiplayer game, because they'd necessitate nerfing whatever was gamebreaking. Something like the single-player Elder Scrolls games are sandboxes to me, or most ARPGs.
---
&gt;Feel free to inform me.
---
Gathering professions allow for on-level mount acquisition, all armor crafting professions provide you with regular on-level gear swaps if you don't mind not saving so much, First Aid and Cooking both provide less downtime when grinding, and Engineering simply makes the game more fun at all levels. The only profession I think is actively not helpful when leveling is Enchanting, simply because it "costs too much" compared to what it's giving at those levels. But it at least keeps your bags more clear so you don't need a bank alt early on.
---
&gt;Yes there is, especially when they're poorly designed (designed to not be instanced, this is a fact the lead dungeon designer for the game at the time said, he even wrote a book about it). Having your own little personal cocoon dungeon so no one else GASP! interrupts you is hand-holding. Social interaction, it's what MMORPGs are about. How can you have social interaction in mind-numbingly boring trash clears with four other people?
---
Sounds like a personal problem. I regularly had a blast with my teammates in any dungeon, especially since we were bound to make stupid mistakes even if everyone was mostly competent. And I don't put too much import on what something was "designed to be". Cross-continent ships were designed to have long travel times because they wanted to implement a Gwent-styled internal card game into WoW. They didn't do that, but the ships still have travel times and "wasted space". Is that a problem? Nope. Feels perfectly immersive to me without the scrapped card game.
---
&gt;This was never a problem in any game that I'm aware of that did this. I actually played Anarchy Online and this was exactly how it was. There was an etiquette to it. Even opposite faction players would rarely, if ever, kill steal. It was considered exceptionally rude. Again, the playerbase polices itself. It comes up with the social rules. That's a community. What is wrong with community?
---
So because a game codifies what was already considered an exceptionally rude practice by much of the existing MMO playerbase and would have also been considered utterly toxic by new MMO players, it's no longer a good thing? To use a real-life analogy, most people think it's "rude" to run over pedestrians. But if it weren't *illegal* to run over pedestrians, then occasionally some assholes would do just that. Games have the benefit of being in magical environments where laws can be enforced through impossibility instead of punishment. It's "illegal" to kill your own faction or steal tagged mobs because the game makes it impossible.
---
Saying that everyone would have agreed to not stealing tagged mobs, but also that making it impossible to steal tag mobs is a bad thing, is kinda the equivalent of saying that nobody's allowed to drive over pedestrians, but also don't you dare build sidewalks or incarcerate people who commit vehicular manslaughter. If it's already agreed upon by most of the playerbase, I see absolutely no reason why game designers wouldn't enshrine the practice to prevent griefing assholes from doing it anyway and getting away scot free.
---
&gt;I'm not going for "scathing" nor do I know where you got the idea I was.
---
I was being snarky. I think that would have been a perfectly benign thing to add in, but it's also not an issue at all to not add in. Didn't you just say something about the playerbase policing itself? Tell your group members to loot more readily if you need to skin or something.
---
&gt;Yeah, I know it is proportional, but it's still less than killing solo. It shouldn't be. Again, I've played games where this was the exact setup and guess what, no problems, no chaos, game was totally playable solo.
---
5-mans already have a comical advantage on solo players when it comes to leveling and exploration. They just do. Even *two* players have a comical advantage over a solo player, just from how combat works. So saying that they're "punished" for being in a 5-man is misleading. The xp decrease is negligible if the 5-man is clearing as many mobs as it theoretically could with that much manpower.
---
&gt;To my knowledge, being killed in pvp did not damage your gear. At least it doesn't on pservers. I mean, you don't even lose XP when you die. You just die. 
---
You were talking about PvP deaths specifically? Got it. No, PvP deaths did not damage gear. The interruption of leveling continuity is enough of a punishment for dying even once, let alone the strong likelihood of needing to fight off or escape a corpse camper when you come back to life with a fraction of your HP and no buffs or preparation. Adding gear damage would *discourage* world PvP efforts because players would regularly need to spend time repairing and, at max level, a comical fuckton of money. PvE death gear costs add up very fast in raid wipe scenarios; if you dealt with raid wipe repair costs every time you tried to have a PvP engagement, it would get very old, very fast. I don't see any need for PvP death punishment beyond that which already exists, even if the punishment was relegated to only world PvP deaths (because punishing deaths in battlegrounds is the whim of a depraved mind).
---
&gt;I'm not sure what you don't understand about what I said about twinking. There are no stat requirements to wear any gear. Like you don't get a plate armor chest that says "req: 100 stam, 100 strength to wear." You can just wear it no matter what if you meet the level req. Laddering gear. Very common in old school MMORPGs. Which I gather from your post, you never played.
---
Yeah, you're going to have to spell this out, because I don't understand why you think this is a problem. You want gear to have both a level requirement *and* a stat requirement in a game where the only way you get stats is with gear and level? Gear would be impossible to wear without itself, and you'd need to carry around multiple stacks of armor to carefully push your base stats up to a certain level to be able to equip the next gear requirement tier. This isn't a game where you could get main stats by allocating points. Whether you like that (apparently you don't based on your distaste of the WoW talent trees) is irrelevant when it comes to describing it as it is. Gear in WoW could never have base stat requirements without a fundamental overhaul of how base stats are attained. And I fail to understand what you think twinks have to do with this. In WoW's terms, level requirements are interchangeable with stat requirements, because level *is* stats when gear is excluded. Saying that Shadowfang, for instance, "requires 30 Agility" as opposed to "requires level 19" is a meaningless distinction if 30 Agility is what an average level 19 should expect to have. The gear restrictions would serve the same purpose from the developers' perspective: Prevent characters below a certain power level from wearing gear.
---
This sounds more like you have a problem with Warcraft levels themselves. But once again, that's personal preference. You aren't presenting an argument as to *why* gear should be based on base stats as opposed to level (like I just did to argue why the difference is either arbitrary or clunkily recursive from a design perspective). You're merely arguing *that* it should be based on base stats as opposed to level. That is not a legitimate criticism. That's an opinion. And it's a perfectly acceptable opinion to have, but it should not be conflated with an objective assessment about why WoW is inferior to its predecessors.
---
WarcraftMovies has most of their videos archived though.
---
Maybe I'm weird, but if it would be a cold winter with snow outside (irl), and I'd be in any snowy area in WoW, I'd bust open my window and get totally immersed. I hope that in my lifetime we'll neural implants or such to simulate feeling the weather and smelling the environment.

I also remember constantly disconnecting and updates taking 3 days

Feign death then trap after charge. There it’s fixed. Your type of post is the reason people say this subreddit is toxic.

You're misunderstanding me. We're taking about WoW, not unity or unreal. WoWs engine is very purpose built, where as the others mentioned are built in a very smart and open way (designed from the ground up for this very purpose).

WoWs engine is old, but most importantly, hindered by the way it was pieced together. It's not the same thing...

I don't think anyone wants the game to just stop with Vanilla. Everyone would like more expansions that add content without changing the functioning of the core game.
---
What are you *talking* about? I gave you your answer and told you why it was as it was. It's silly to claim that "this happened when WoW became mainstream." WoW has been mainstream since Vanilla, and I have also been playing since Vanilla, so you're basically just stating that WoW is a toxic game. If you think that, you may wish to avoid it, because you're gonna find people a hell of a lot more volatile and foul than me.

Hey, just a small bug I noticed: I can't register using a "ï" in my character name or my Battle.Net tag, but it's a valid letter in both (at least in EU). Hope I helped ^^
---
I would if you were on EU.
---
Thank you for your well crafted response.  I mean that, plenty of people have come in so far and simply insulted me, so I appreciate an actual discussion here.
---
I agree with you, for the most part.  For example, I'm not advocating for full pvp loot, but something (XP loss, you can loot non-soulbound items, that kinda stuff).  I think we understand each other.
---
The point about scavenging is excellent.  I used to do that all the time.  That was a social activity.  That's sort of what I'm talking about here.  I think MMORPGs should maximize the social elements, and that's why I said what I said.  I'm not advocating for changing classic WoW (and I agree with you that it was not the direction Blizzard wanted to go in back in 2004 - they wanted a much more "safe" game), but rather that classic WoW can't be our best option.
---
Damn son, that tang thang
---
With better dual boxing, no. But OP is essentially only using his second account to ensure the first account never has to eat or bandage.
---
Amazing content, man.
---
Yes, when the game launches there is no way to predict which random server flagged as whatever type will get more players for that server type.
---
This is the best policy. Sick or vacation, a day off is a day off.
---
WRONG. I'll quote your own math so you can prove yourself wrong instead lmao
---
&gt;That page shows Warlocks doing about 900 DPS in MC and roughly 700 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx.
---
&gt;It shows Priests doing about 600 DPS in MC and roughly 400 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx.
---
&gt;That means your average DPS (when counting the bonus from Warlocks) is ~1000 in MC and 715 DPS averaged across MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxx.
---
**HIGHER THAN THE WARLOCK AVERAGE ONCE YOU REMOVE THEIR 15% SHADOW WEAVING INCREASE** and only 200 less DPS than the strongest caster in Vanilla, the Mage. Statistics from the pinnacle of player skill. The best of the best. Your own math disagrees with you. You're arguing with yourself at this stage, which is why I called you the worst troll on the planet.
---
If this happened in 2004, no one wouldnt probably notice, due to internet connections (at least in the US) being a lot worse.
---
With less ping nowadays, the spell batching window seems a lot more noticable.
---
Blizzard stated 400ms. 1 second is 1000. So you've got almost a half second per batch.
---
Batching isn't a delay, it's when the sever executes instructions. So you can have say a charge and a poly both enter the batch at 238 and 339 ms into a new batch, both get executed at 400ms.
---
The batch system has a priority to execute, as well. One action may have priority over another which is what we are probably seeing here.
---
wasnt it debated that it gaps at 308?
---
Even just pocket healing his warrior, he'll be just fine to 60 without too much extra time.
---
That's absolutely untrue. Addiction is a spectrum. This isn't the 90s. Stop spreading nonsense you would see on my 600lb life.
---
Smart. I need to strategize how to game the system to get my Briarwood Reed...
---
Nope, but we don't have to publicly decry someone as bad just cause you don't find them attractive.
---
I get it's from a movie, but frankly I don't like those jokes in movies either, because it *is* fat shaming.
---
So no one should do anything unless they're going to go over the top on everyone and everything else?  Niche markets shouldn't exist?  I should just go to the supermarket and be able to buy chicken, pizza, and chocolate because that's what everyone else eats?
---
If being as "good" (a pretty loaded term, there) as 1-2% of the competition results in you making money, is that not success?
---
Flying should never come back into classic, even if they crest new content.
---
I played other MMORPGs I liked at the time.  WoW was a joke back then.
---
Remove the shadow weaving increase? No, that was WITHOUT the shadow weaving increase.
---
A Priest does 400 DPS.
---
A Warlock does 700 DPS.
---
Together, they do ~1200 DPS.
---
Every Warlock gets a ~100 DPS increase because of the Shadow Priest. And since you're not bringing more Warlocks than you need for the curses for better DPS classes, that equates to the Priest doing 600 DPS. Which is lower than every other DPS class by far.
---
At level 12, it increases with level.
---
No lol
---
save your money
---
 Every player has a list of improvements they think would help the game, the problem is those lists aren't the same.
---
\#NoChanges
---
Orly?
---
Projecting much?
---
No changes. I'm seeing too many posts similar. If you do not like how classic is the y ou are not built for the experience we went through. Do not ruin this for us play bfa or fortnight or something.
---
Bro, if you think a particular body type is somehow biologically programmed in us to be attractive, there's a whole world of history you should be aware of.
---
It's not going to give you the same competitive advantage as it would in a twitch shooter, but it's really nice to have regardless. You'll never be able to go back to 60hz.
---
It holds up pretty well. I have used to spec myself in MC, BWL and AQ40 and the performance was pretty good even without Wrath of Cenarius ring. The reason the spec hold up so well is that the spec use a very fast attack speed so your mana return from Judgement of Wisdom will be huge.
---
I recorded AQ40 using this spec, so you can see for yourself how the mana sustain works out on bosses.

In the right gear and the right raid composition, and by downranking Consecration by one rank you can in theory extend the DPS indefinately.

This doesn't help me decide between warlock-mage-shaman so thanks for nothing
---
Yeah buy it and cap it the framerate at 20 for the authentic experience
---
Clicking has never been hardcore man. Same thing as the other guy said, you can play as you want, as long as you don't bother others, but it's a little weird that you feel it is only something hardcore players do.
---
Steak and lobster is not $1000.
---
It's insane.
---
I got bear form too, and was freaking out about how I'm get EIGHTY SILVER for my bear form quests. Sick.
---
Then I learned it's because I hit level cap and XP turned to gold. Oof.
---
I have tough about priest and saw a video of, Kala who goes in detail of the priest leveling

really interesting and in the end seem going full shadow is viable and really great to level. Might have a good synergy with lock too.
---
Me an my wife are doing the same. How strong is this comp for pvp?

I've had it for a day I'll post an update if it happens

spell batching in a nutshell
---
TIL, thank you for info.
---
I'm with you, friend.  I like classic wow and don't like retail.  Also I don't need to make fat jokes to be excited for classic.
---
Lol that was great
---
I have a mate who's played since vanilla with us and still clicks, backpedals and keyboard turns. 
---
He's kept his raid spot all this time by just being good at avoiding shit so outlasts enough people to not be bottom 5 DPS.
---
He honestly just can't move and DPS unless he's DPSing by clicking and moving using keybinds for whatever reason.
---
I think you can just delete the contents of the folder. Is 9GB worth that much?
---
He'll have to kill twice as many mobs, accept and turn-in twice as many quests, loot twice as many bodies.
---
Yeah, it'll add a fuckton of time.
---
What are you doing here ? You're defintiely not looking to play WoW, what you're looking for is everquest.
---
Admittedly, most evidence from vanilla is anecdotal (cuz if someone had the exact dB or logs outside blizz the pservers would have been 100% blizzlike by now) I don’t see a problem with this (unlike a lot of the pserver / retail babies who don’t have any experience)
---
What I am refuting is the practice of bringing MS warz. AND claiming that an MS warrior needs to get carried.
---
3/our top 10 dpsers were arms warriors, with only rogues and more geared fury above them. being the third best dps class doesn’t mean you are getting carried lol.
---
This practice was NOT isolated to our guild (since my warrior mentor was also a raiding MS war, on both horde and alliance on our server.  I imagine he was the top dps of his guild since he was like the 2nd or third r14 on horde side before he swapped)
---
Nor was it isolated to our server, since many of my undergrad friends confirmed the same practice on their respective servers.
---
I NEVER heard anything about debuff slots even being an issue in raids besides murmurs of the ignite buff in AQ.  (Admittedly I didn’t follow a lot of other class guides besides warrior, and most of our locks were destro so they gave no fucks)
---
If you ever checked Wow census during vanilla, it confirmed the the observation that rogue was in fact the most popular class in vanilla, NOT warrior.
---
Predicting that warriors will be the most popular class without evidence supporting it, and then mentioning the word logic immediately after this baseless prediction illustrates you only have a tenuous understanding of what the word “logic” means.
---
Incidentally, recalling the old data from wow census seems to suggest this prediction is probably wrong, at least if history repeats itself.
---
Trying to claim I was carried by my guild because I was arms is factually inaccurate because I was one of the top 5 dpsers (and top dps post fury reroll) AND it implies that any attitude that isn’t geared towards sheer numbers is somehow not contributing to the raid as much as the next guy.
---
As I have mentioned many times before, loot drops are random, but it is in the interest of the guild to make use of every piece that drops whenever possible.  If an item is “sub optimal” but still offers an upgrade, it might make sense to give it to a class that can maximize its use as opposed to disenchanting it.
---
Nope not at all. I nor any conservatives have done anything to silence people on social media. Nor have I called the experience of hearing dissenting opinions on trade chat unbearable. 
---
That’s obvious though. A lot of good could be had voting for the right party, so I give liberals the time of day still. But damn is it tiring having to argue low IQ points with 62 IQ individuals.
---
The only thing I would actually like in the game is a barber but thats pretty much it
---
Yep. Mana regens while you’re in animal forms, so you can trade all your health while fighting with bottomless resources and then just pop out to heal yourself.
---
&gt; If being as "good" (a pretty loaded term, there) as 1-2% of the competition results in you making money, is that not success?
---
When you're in the exact same line of work? No, it isn't a success.
---
Yeah, WoW sacrificed some of the fantasy sandbox elements of MMORPGs that came before it for a bit of a more on-rails, "safe," and "gamier" experience. That's just a fact that everyone who understands the genre can agree on. The question is if you prefer the style of WoW, or the style of a game like EverQuest and that just comes down to preference. The people who prefer games to be like EverQuest are understandably bitter since WoW was the game that succeeded and therefore every MMO since then has been designed to be like WoW. So the old EQ gamers feel left out and forgotten about, and that's not a nice feeling. 
---
So, I absolutely understand it if you feel frustration for the hype that WoW Classic is receiving over a game like Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen. Luckily I discovered that I enjoy vanilla WoW despite its flaws and will be playing a hell of a lot of Classic while remaining cautiously optimistic for Pantheon.
---
There's such a huge spectrum on which you can build a game upon, and you'll never please every gamer in the world. There's probably a couple hardcore MUD gamers out there that think EverQuest was too hand-holdy and ruined some of the fantasy and social elements from MUDs. Feel bad for those guys cause there will never be a super popular MUD again.
---
Someone needs to post this on the official Classic forum!
---
Flip the scenario, you're the scrub and they're the God tier player. More believable.
---
The dungeons were designed to be instanced the fuck are you saying
---
An 18 min video? Where dies the topic start?
---
You literally aren't understanding the point of the post. It's a post advocating for no changes. Moron.
---
I'm likely going a warrior tank. You can bet I won't be sharing my 5 mans with Fury/Arms warriors (I'll be horde). Why halve my chance at loot when I can say "no dps war" and they'll find a replacement dps in 0.5 seconds.
---
That’s where you’re wrong. OP is exactly the kind of pedantic basement dweller that has just responded point by point in exacting detail.
---
Really, clearing MC with a casual raid guild in Vanilla, as one of the 2 Warlocks in the guild and all the raiding I did through Wrath as a clicker and I was huge drag....I never knew. Thanks for that absurd and stupid logic there.
---
What did I just tell you? Soymilk, put it down
---
Loved your Unit Frames, so happy they're live in classic
---
Silverpine forest is bad? Interesting.
---
Also, Dun morogh is amazing.
---
Nvm I was calculating it wrong, level 30 R3 damage is 52-61, shadow vuln is not enough to get it up to 80.
---
#nochanges
---
Hahaha.. I think of this being like Blizzard and the playerbase interacting with eachother.. then when the check comes and its 'must be subscribed to have a chance to get into the beta' Blizzard and the playerbase look at eachother and Blizzard says "dont get cheap with me now"
---
The warlock parses show 700 DPS average across all raids BASELINE. That then drops down to 595 average dps when you remove the 15% provided by shadow weaving. That is less average damage than the shadow priest is bringing by itself. By your own definition, Warlocks are a meme class, because they have less DPS than a shadow priest. Congratulations. 
---
The exact same parse even shows the best shadow priest from private servers pulling 820 DPS in MC, which when combined with shadow weaving puts him at over 1200 DPS when you factor in the top warlocks damage. That is not "lower than every other dps class by far". You're just one of those stubborn douchenozzles who refuses to admit when they're in the wrong, despite hard facts proving it. See ya later, gonna go watch some more Shadow Priests in BWL and MC speedruns! :D
---
There's definitely some wonkyness in the beta with batching that is very un-vanilla-like. Not talking about pserver, either as I don't play on them.
---
A rather large number of us who played Classic have brought this up only to be shouted down by folks who haven't played it yet. It shouldn't get removed, but there's definitely timing issues that aren't present in Vanilla even with procs on attacks that we can see when watching Vanilla videos vs Classic.
---
It needs to be tuned. We can't forget it's running on a new engine which may or may not execute the batch as it was in Vanilla. Right now it feels like they plopped the 400ms number in the batching and left it in but the execution of the batches is wider. More than likely the number is accurate but the modern engine's implementation is different since the modern engine still uses it but to a vastly different degree. I'm willing to bet the farm it wasn't just a numbers change with engine improvements.
---
A leveling hunter isn't "screwed" by not having 2 more stats on their melee weapon.
---
Why would leveling dungeons be any different, off-spec gear is off-spec gear. What if a ret rolled need on a shield would you be ok to compete on that gear despite you being the tank in that particular dungeon?
---
I had very good taste in music at 16/17.
---
#nochanges. Moron.
---
Hey, if you're so confident, why don't you make a post here on classicwow and ask if anyone would have any problems with a clicker in their raid / PvP guild?
---
There are plenty of body types, all on spectrums from healthy and fit to fat slob.
---
I played almost all of Vanilla WoW as someone who never joined a raiding Guild, never even strove for doing progression but even I managed to pop into every raid. I killed Ragnaros and Onyxia a few times. Did BWL and AQ, but never completed them and that's okay. Maxed out all the PvP reps, got the first tier PvP set at while being a dirty casual. I also rerolled constantly, server hopped for that fresh server smell. Only got two characters to 60 because of that, but I didn't need to have every class maxed. Granted, I never got enough gold for my epic mount on my Shaman until BC but I'm going to try and fix that this time around!  
---
Don't worry about being casual. Yes, Classic will be a grind but that also means there will be plenty of other people taking it slow or re-rolling.
---
.......................what?
---
And what delusion do I have? None.
---
So thanks for your childish banter. Oh and my lack of ability to think logically must have not been in effect while I was in Iraq and the rest of the time in the military while you were still swimming in your dads balls.

But oh well, you still do you....it’s entertainment
---
I have some friends who started later than cata who are interested in the end game that is irrelevant these days.  I've tried to warm them about the other differences but we'll see how it goes when they are whining that murloc eyes aren't dropping

Like about 30s into it. Was gonna ask for a time stamp as well, but it's about the beginning.
---
Doesn't make much of a point though. Just says in "general" streamers won't impact the amount of people who play. Yes they will have an effect on the server they are on, but not the overall population of the game.
---
As someone that played high-end arena in BC and WOTLK, I'd love for arena to see the light of day in Classic.
---
However, I understand not everyone (probably the majority) would not agree with me, thus it should not be implemented.
---
Watching him die to those kobolds over and over again was a bit painful :D

LOL WTF
---
Im pretty sure focus target worked on the stress test.
---
There’s been one before. Absolutely nobody cared. Most people are pushing world 1st in anything and keybinding those 4 abilities most classes might need isn’t done any differently than if someone clicks them
---
I started in wrath and this triggered some deep, buried memories
---
You are going to dps very, very slowly. And by slow I mean FUCKING slow.
---
Hey i think i have a little insight as i have played runescape in the early days (including rsc) and played wow since eu open beta and also played osrs quite alot (gz btw for almost maxing!). 
---
Much like back in the day on runescape people didnt really know about efficiency and just fucked around alot of the time with their buddies where as now on osrs all most people care about is ehp and/or slayerscape and people just know alot more about the game in general which leads to people not fucking around as much.
---
Now vanilla wow was the same nobody really new what the fuck they were doing and just kind of winged it but again, its all been figured out so alot more people minmax and know all there is to know. But my experience with private servers is that the community is still strong and the game is designed in such a way it forces you to interact with others and makes you remember the names you see out in the world which imo is incredibly immersing and makes it feel like each server has its own community.
---
I think youll like the minmaxing nature linked with a strong sense of social interaction mixed in.
---
Dun Morogh is good before you go through the tunnel and then it becomes a shitshow of bad quest after bad quest. That quarry? Yeah, no thanks.
---
Vanilla had a massive shortage of tanks and you could wait hours for one. Good luck boycotting tanks.

Yeah so you are an idiot or trolling.

Its a shit meme.  He has a video in full world buffs + full raid buffs + half BiS half pre-raid gear, and he does [~640 dps on a tipple target cleave test in MC.](https://youtu.be/Xlg6BqyaTIQ?t=53)  
---
[He manages ~450 dps on a single target](https://youtu.be/Xlg6BqyaTIQ?t=237).  
---
People could do 100 dps before level 60 with decent luck on the drops...
---
You're incorrectly assuming the 700 DPS warlocks had shadow weaving. I checked the raids, they did not.
---
You're also forgetting that 10% of the priest's damage belongs to one warlock.
---
His name is ButFart88 and he unironically uses the clown emoji.
---
It's a troll account.
---
Fat people choose to be fat, no different than smokers or drug addicts.

I think people that destroy their bodies are funny.

100% I hope their is a pvp realm named hogger Or chromie.
---
&gt; In other hand, I will never team up again with a tank rolling a need on damage dealer gear when there is someone in the team who can directly benefit from it (even I am not currently playing a plate wearer/damage dealer in that team), even if it's only a leveling dungeons.
---
The only reason you do dungeons while levelling is to get levelling gear.
---
Tank loot is useless for levelling, and it's mostly useless for future tanking while levelling too because you will outlevel it before your next dungeon run. At most you'll use it for one future run before it gets replaced by a green. The same goes for healing loot.
---
The idea that healers and tanks should tank/heal levelling dungeons for you to get you levelling gear, but not take any themselves, strikes me as an insane level of entitlement.
---
It is totally different at level sixty, at that level I think it's more reasonable to expect people to roll only on loot for their role, but for levelling content I expect everyone to roll on whatever helps them level the fastest. That absolutely means druid healers rolling on +agility leather for catform, or priest healers rolling on +spellpower gear, or warrior tanks rolling on two-handers with big damage.
---
Fat people like that usually have enought happyness in their life  (money, a partner, family) that they don't really give a crap about what other people think about them.

I don't get his argument re: streamers

* Players won't be influenced by streamers playing

How can you have a huge influence over the server and it have no effect on the players?

Wow, sorry. I completely got my logic ass backwards, must be one of those days. Its slow mainhand, fast offhand. Only reason why your main hand is generally a slow weapon is because you prioritize higher dmg weapons there for the fun backstabs/ambush. Fast OH for lots of poison procs.
---
I watched his stream a bit during the first raid of BFA and he:

a.) is genuinely up with the best raiders to have ever played WoW

b.) fucks around in all other things

Mage Tables?
---
Soulwells?
---
Summoning Stones?

You missed a lot of big ones.

If someone has really been playing since 2004 they ought to remember the official WoW forums and how they introduced the concept of "entitlement" to a whole generation.

WoW alone isn’t worth a 144hz upgrade, no, but once you experience 144hz there’s no going back. Treat yourself if you want. I just recently picked up a budget 144hz GSYNC monitor and it’s been great.

Tell her to level shadow , leveling as holy is painful, she can heal all leveling dungeons as shadow, just tell her that she needs a second set of gear focused on +healing and spirit, also be aware that she also needs to roll on +shadow and +sp  and specially for wands
---
Nono you're misunderstanding him bro, because if Blizzard said no then the answer obviously is no. But the thing is Blizzard is not gonna say no, they would never say no because of the implication.
---
Lul. I believe, he is genuinely good. Just that video itself was funny. Watching his stream right now :\]
---
[Can check any PVE video from vanilla.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw8-FRJYgOg)
---
Obviously we weren't getting hit from 20 yards away, that would have made any sort of AOE grinding impossible. In the Classic Beta, people are getting hit by mobs with melee attacks at max nova range. In the video, you can see me stay within 5-10 yards of the crocs and be completely fine.
---
I'm scared to even talk about having beta. Everyone hates you, thinks you're bragging, and downvotes you into oblivion. I realize how lucky I am and can honestly say its the most fun I've had gaming since, well, classic WoW. Soon boys, soon.
---
Hahahahahaha. Weakest comeback of the century. I can see now that you are defeated.
---
I said a couple quests per level. And that's about what it is. At least for Horde, no idea what the quest structure is like on Alliance.
---
List of things I want to be backported to classic:
---
* BC-Style Guild Banks
---
* Barber Shop
---
* New models as an option (turned off by default)
---
Why is this good for rogues?
---
recking bomb
---
Was doing that setup in Cataclysm too. I was making sure the guild had repair gold, flasks and feasts. I was also settling disputes, but I wasn't actually raiding with the guild until they ran out of bench.
---
They were not the most experienced raiders, but I wanted them to have fun anyway. The first time I joined them when they got stuck on a boss I think I did over double the damage of their dps with less gear. :/
---
They enchant Shadow Oil to their weapons.
---
You are doing God’s work OP, but such a low effort meme/bragging still deserves to be downvoted to oblivion, just like streamer shit.
---
144Hz is hella smooth, it's overall more pleasing to the eye even when you aren't gaming.
---
Started playing on December 2007 I think BT patch had just hit had tons of fun leveling.
---
a few months ago rolled a priest on a pserver and had to stop myself from playing to not to ruin my classic experience
---
If you get aggro, it means you're going to lose F I F T Y D K P, because you didn't know what da fuck to do!
---
Sounds like you suck.
---
It took me so long to hit 60. I restarted so many times. So many deleted characters that never reached level 20. I finally convinced myself to buckle down. I traveled to the frozen lakes of Winterspring. I Spent so many hours slaying banshees. Finally i became level 60. Not to long after that I stepped into MC. My vanilla experience would end with a few failed attempts in Naxx before TBC launched.
---
I personally am too used to IPS monitors to make the switch. Plus i'm too cheap to build a computer that can handle modern games at 144hz
---
Which relates to ISB how? And it replaces poisons...
---
You get +20% on the Sbolt while it doesn't consume a ISB charge.
---
You can't dodge from behind, only mobs can.

They’re so very different...I stopped at TBC back in the day.  Recently I downloaded retail last month to “prepare for classic” and there are so many changes to make the game more fluid...little creature comforts...and i think people who didn’t play vanilla who have zero nostalgia are going to get frustrated with things like super weak toons from 1-19, no mounts until 40, LFG and BGs are not fast, and like u said drop rates sometimes are abysmal.  
---
It’s like someone who has only driven a 2019 mercedes getting in a shelby cobra...you can have a ton of fun but it’s not going to help you park, massage your back, and find the closest starbucks for you.
---
Can you quote exactly where I demanded anyone ban anything? But we know reading is hard for the MAGA hats.
---
Yes. Let's explain why. What do you stare at 99.99% of the time while you game? Do you want a smooth gaming experience? Your PC can easily run 144+ fps, yet you're capped at 60 on your current one, it's a waste of a PC to have a 1070 and stuck at 60 hz. Go for freesync/gsync 1440p 144hz, you will love it
---
Based and redpilled.
---
&gt;perceived increase in range
---
Holy shit what you even smoking? Obviously we weren't getting hit from max nova range while AOE-grinding in vanilla - it would have made it completely impossible. Every shitter mage back then could aoe grind just fine, not like the beta where even the best mages are struggling. It is beyond a shadow of a doubt a massive bug in the Classic beta - just watch literally any PVE video where the character and mobs are moving from vanilla.
---
I remember spending almost a week of wall-walking and jumping in Moonglade trying to get there... when i finally made it up the mountains, chugged a noggenfogger for slowfall and jumped, i went too fast and floated over it all the way down to Darkshore. Good times. (I did make it down there the second try, they actually play music too iirc)
---
Caverns of time is
---
we need AT LEAST one MEGA server with no pop cap or phasing/layering, so we can re-experience the pserver experience of F R E S H
---
I always liked Arathi. Not the most flashy, but felt good being there.
---
Yep flying was almost the worst thing to ever happen to the game.
---
The worst thing was the LFG/LFR system and if they put it back in i'll quit immediately.
---
if you are gathering 40+ strangers 3 months before an event, and you are in a discord together you are gonna be friends, much more sooner than guilds that wait till after releasse
---
I’ve played on private servers too, but god are there some insufferable elitists on this sub.
---
They'd make bank selling them.
---
it doesnt cap it severely diminishes after 315 tho
---
Tell me about it, I remember deleting my 54 orc warrior so I could play with some alliance friends I'd somehow made, leveled a dwarf rogue to low 50s before deleting him and restoring my warrior / going back to horde.
---
Trolling it is.
---
Can't seem to hear the music at all anymore, how she goes anyway. This is about as noobish and classic as it gets!
---
I always get King Bangalash at level 43, hes the best looking tiger at that level, but after that these sabers are amazing.
---
okay
---
normies most likely
---
I'm gonna try to get Broken Tooth for PvE, but I'll be using one of these sabers while doing PvE.
---
You could go alliance and be a mole for your friends?
---
&gt; I'm sure I missed many, these were just what I could think of off the top of my head as possibilities that, while some of them would dramatically alter the economy or community (*cough* LFR), wouldn't affect the base game as much..
---
The community IS a core of the base game and destroying that destroys everything the game is built around.
---
Friends over faction any day.

It's tossed around pretty often that classic World of Warcraft is a journey and it isn't about the destination--and next to retail World of Warcraft, I'd agree. However, classic isn't just an aimless journey into the void (as compared to other MMOs I have played, like Eve online). It is a happy balance of great and designed moments, clearing an instance with 39 other people, getting a piece of pre-X raid BiS, getting a piece of BiS, reaching that PvP rank you are aiming for, and hitting 60. Great journeys have ends, stories have arcs, and great experiences need to give way to new ones.

hell no, yuck

Hunter with The Nicker. You were *that guy*.
---
I wouldnt mind them doing events, but short term.
---
Sounds like you're whining that WoW isn't exactly like some other game you were playing back then (I'd guess EQ but whatever) which is kinda dumb. Just go play that game instead.
---
He's playing the long game
---
What’s wrong with Asmongold?
---
Play with friends. That's the reason the game exists.
---
[Also here's my standard hype message for these questions.](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bm0akw/please_help_me_get_excited_about_playing_horde/emstcpl/)
---
If you really hate it and all your friends quit, then reroll Alliance. Not like you're disallowed from doing that.
---
I was a healer in TBC. Downranking isn't a hassle at all, it's a really convenient way of avoiding over heals while preserving mana. With scaling it ends up more efficient and you always have max rank available for when you need raw output.
---
You are a weird unit mate
---
There is no aggro reset.
---
Soo many things
---
You will have the same discussion between clothie healers and caster DPS on many items.
---
I'm actually not worried about it. Pallies can solo basically anything.. and they can kill deamons and undead really quickly. I'm probably going to farm the heck outta fel cloth and ore
---
People be hysterical. I would never be offended if I didn’t get a reply to a party invite from a friend. People and especially friends can handle it. Ive bonded with people from work that i would now barely know if i felt the need to shun them from my online life.
---
I remember my first time ever playing and it was on a trial. I rolled a troll said screw this im exploring, I made it to mulgore somehow as prolly a level 4-6. Than I found out there where graphic setting and I increased them. The rest is history, i must have been like 8
---
If you imply clickhealing, as in right clicking player frame = heals the moused-over player is inferior, could you elaborate please?
---
 I've never noticed any difference that'd impact the performance in any way.
---
Sounds like you downloaded the client via peer to peer. Should've used the mega.nz link.
---
No one knows your budget so it's kind of up to you. What I think is even more important is having a second monitor to look stuff up on or watch Twitch streams or whatever while you play, and your 60hz monitor would work well for that.
---
I would say go orc. Tauren racials are useless for hunter.
---
Out of curiosity which expansion launches have you played?
---
600
---
What noob doesnt have feign death + trap in a macro for instant cast? 
---
Oh yea, noobs that dont play pservers I forgot.
---
Similar situation I am more drawn to that nostalgia of alliance but if you and your group of friends are like mine - they'll fall off after a couple months and I'll still be playing.
---
It's not their fault it's just how 2019 is, there is too much quality competition (bl3 2 weeks after classic launch) that draws people away once that honeymoon phase is over in classic.
---
So for me it's easier to just say "it would be fun to play with you guys but I'm going to just play for myself" 
---
With that being said I don't know if I can choose horde over alliance in vanilla :( I want to because I've been horde since cata, but alliance was my home from vanilla to wrath. 
---
You could always find a group after they stop playing but I rather start with a guild and stick with them through all of classic, that's why I'll play for myself when it comes to choosing faction/race/class.
---
What kind of event you talking kinda like time walking events or ?
---
You must not have read anything I said previously. I never said the OP was wrong. I said he needs to show proof for people to take him seriously. There are a ton of factors involved here.
---
I would basically just like to see some dual spec. As a healer I choose different talents for pvp than I do pve
---
Right, but how is a 15% chance at 58 to 64 damage better than a 20% chance at 112 to 148 damage?
---
Eh... you been walkin' through the expansions blind?
---
WoD Nagrand. Vol'dun. Stormsong Valley. Valley of the Four Winds. Kun-Lai Summit. Uldum. Just to name a few. All of them pretty wide, open zones without too much clutter.
---
I believe you meant to say something different, because I do know what you mean with this claustrophobic and stressed feeling in most of the new zones. One thing that has sorely gone missing since Vanilla WoW is the feeling of a vast, open world with exploration and pure adventure. Almost every new zone ever since WotLK feels like an ongoing battle field or a crisis parkour. You can't run 100 yards into any direction without running into quest hubs or some sort of frontline battle.
---
In the old classic zones, you could sometimes run vast distances in a zone without running into any quest givers, zones of ongoing conflict or some sort of small faction hub. You could freely explore and find wonderous places that made you feel like you are the first in ages to have touched the ground here, or find a random cave in the wildlife that made you wonder what's inside.
---
&gt;No, I meant that I literally didn't understand what you were even arguing. I don't think any MMO ever released is a sandbox by my definition of the term, unless you count something like   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Minecraft
---
As someone else mentioned, these are more on a sliding scale than binaries, so while no "true" sandbox exists, things exist that are very close to it (EVE, for example).  WoW has always been more on the theme park side of things.  
---
&gt; Gathering professions allow for on-level mount acquisition, all armor crafting professions provide you with regular on-level gear swaps if you don't mind not saving so much, First Aid and Cooking both provide less downtime when grinding, and Engineering simply makes the game more fun at all levels. The only profession I think is actively not helpful when leveling is Enchanting, simply because it "costs too much" compared to what it's giving at those levels. But it at least keeps your bags more clear so you don't need a bank alt early on. 
---
Calling selling what you get from gathering professions and a direct benefit of them is beyond a stretch.  I'll give you first aid and cooking, but no way can you reasonably level blacksmithing or tailoring to help your character.  Look at bracers for both of those.  Look at the huge gap there is for that slot.  I think belts are the same.  You can craft pieces here and there, but you can't craft yourself a whole set and replace all your gear with an upgrade until max level or close to it.  
---
&gt; Sounds like a personal problem. I regularly had a blast with my teammates in any dungeon, especially since we were bound to make stupid mistakes even if everyone was mostly competent.
---
I find the trash clears boring, repetitive, and entirely too long.  It's also very lonely down there.  Why is coming across dozens of other people in huge dungeons a bad thing?  Maybe you can work together.  Maybe they're just passing through and they buff you.  Maybe they're opposite faction and we've got a situation brewing.  These are all social elements, and I don't see how deliberately minimizing them through instancing is a good idea at all.
---
&gt;So because a game codifies what was already considered an exceptionally rude practice by much of the existing MMO playerbase and would have also been considered utterly toxic by new MMO players, it's no longer a good thing? To use a real-life analogy, most people think it's "rude" to run over pedestrians. But if it weren't *illegal* to run over pedestrians, then occasionally some assholes would do just that. Games have the benefit of being in magical environments where laws can be enforced through impossibility instead of punishment. It's "illegal" to kill your own faction or steal tagged mobs because the game makes it impossible.  
---
&gt;Saying that everyone would have agreed to not stealing tagged mobs, but also that making it impossible to steal tag mobs is a bad thing, is kinda the equivalent of saying that nobody's allowed to drive over pedestrians, but also don't you dare build sidewalks or incarcerate people who commit vehicular manslaughter. If it's already agreed upon by most of the playerbase, I see absolutely no reason why game designers wouldn't enshrine the practice to prevent griefing assholes from doing it anyway and getting away scot free.
---
I'm going to go ahead and say that killing someone in real life is in no way comparable to not having mob tagging in a video game.  To address your last point, no, the game mechanics should not limit griefing.  The community should.  Anything else is safe, sanitized, hand-holding, carebear nonsense.
---
&gt;I think that would have been a perfectly benign thing to add in, but it's also not an issue at all to not add in. Didn't you just say something about the playerbase policing itself? Tell your group members to loot more readily if you need to skin or something. 
---
The fact you think this has anything to do with skinning says more than I think you intended.  First off, I am not nor was I ever talking about skinning, I was talking about actual loot.  Furthermore, in classic MMORPGs, you could scavenge things higher level players wouldn't bother looting.  Maybe it's just vendor junk, or food/potions too low for him, but useful to you.  Just another social practice.
---
&gt;5-mans already have a comical advantage on solo players when it comes to leveling and exploration. They just do. Even *two* players have a comical advantage over a solo player, just from how combat works. So saying that they're "punished" for being in a 5-man is misleading. The xp decrease is negligible if the 5-man is clearing as many mobs as it theoretically could with that much manpower. 
---
Okay.  It's still a punishment that shouldn't exist.  
---
&gt;You were talking about PvP deaths specifically? Got it. 
---
Yeah, I'm not saying that if a mob kills you and someone finds your corpse, they can loot it.
---
&gt;No, PvP deaths did not damage gear. The interruption of leveling continuity is enough of a punishment for dying even once, let alone the strong likelihood of needing to fight off or escape a corpse camper when you come back to life with a fraction of your HP and no buffs or preparation. Adding gear damage would *discourage* world PvP efforts because players would regularly need to spend time repairing and, at max level, a comical fuckton of money.
---
I wasn't thinking about adding repair costs to pvp deaths, but something like XP loss and being able to loot all non-soulbound items.  
---
&gt;Yeah, you're going to have to spell this out, because I don't understand why you think this is a problem. You want gear to have both a level requirement *and* a stat requirement in a game where the only way you get stats is with gear and level? Or do you want gear to have *only* a stat requirement. 
---
Just a stat req would be fine.
---
&gt;Because gear is the main source of base stats as currently designed in Vanilla, it would would be impossible to wear without itself, and you'd need to carry around multiple stacks of armor to carefully push your base stats up to a certain level to be able to equip the next gear requirement tier. 
---
Welcome to actual twinking.  This is exactly what gear laddering is.  Twinking should require some thought beyond "I am that level."
---
&gt;This isn't a game where you could get main stats by allocating points. Whether you like that (apparently you don't based on your distaste of the WoW talent trees) 
---
I have nothing against the trees.  Maybe you just don't understand me.  I don't want to get rid of talent trees, or change how talent points are spent.  I'm saying I prefer to manually allocate my own stat points into individual stats.  Like I ding, then I get a certain number of points I can put into any stat I like.  Just like talent points, but obviously you get more with each level because you get more than just +1 to just one stat every time you ding.
---
&gt;Saying that Shadowfang, for instance, "requires 30 Agility" as opposed to "requires level 19" is a meaningless distinction if 30 Agility is what an average level 19 should expect to have. The gear restrictions would serve the same purpose from the developers' perspective: Prevent characters below a certain power level from wearing gear.
---
This effectively only discourages creative, resourceful, outside-of-the-box thinkers.  Since I am in fact talking about a game with a fundamental overhaul to how base stats are allocated (see above), I don't see the problem.  Let's take an item like Shadowfang (bad example as I think weapons should be equippable with weapon skill, not stats, but that's a whole different point).  Instead of having it require about 30 agility since that's what an average player would have, how about some amount of agility that is at the upper reaches of what a very creative, resourceful, thinking man's player would have?  After all, it's a rare item, so why not?  That's the whole point of this, to make things out of the reach of the more average player, thereby giving a sense of accomplishment to the above average players.
---
But thats just like vanilla WoW anyway:
---
Guildmaster: Lets form a  raid and go fuck over the enemy capital/ stv/whatever. and it was done. you dont need to be a streamer to have influence over people.
---
But no defiantly they will have influence over a server, but yeah a player having influence is nothing really new. the difference between a GM and a streamer is though the GM will bring 40 geared raiders, the streamers brings hundrerds of 5-12 year old scrubs too busy watching streams and not enough time playing. IT GONNA BE FUN ZERG FARMING!
---
You only nee- There's some shit about an aggro reset when people don't know how to manage their aggro.
---
Do you have Auctioneer data? =P
---
I first logged into WoW on December 4th 2004.  My sub has been expired for years, I opted in for the beta, I never got an invite and I wasn't surprised one bit.  Nothing wrong with throwing your hat into the ring for the hell of it but nobody is entitled to anything...especially when they haven't paid for WoW since Cataclysm.
---
No game like that exists anymore.
---
Elwynn Forest is still going to be a shit show with a 3000 cap D:
---
Placeholders?
---
Yeah not saying to leave on auto, it'll taunt in the worse spots. Just saying I used to keybind it I suppose and use it to help :) thanks!
---
Big part of the game, aka extra long og corpse runs. In reality, I've been there done that on classic the first time around.  I stopped enjoying pvp in wow when in MOBAs came out. So If I want to scratch that itch, Im totally going to play LoL or Heroes
---
Ye, this is why you can float your corpse / skeleton by jumping right as you die. Height-code was weird in 1.12
---
Are you the top earner in the world at what you do for a living?
---
Same story for any beta. You would think with time people would understand how it work.
---
Exactly my thought, what the fuck!
---
Does anybody know if they have said they will release a serverlist sometime before hand? i know we have naming day.  but was hoping for something afew months out.
---
What are the rules?
---
I like your faith in blizzard. They will however screw something up about classic. My money is on leaving the faction changes, appearance change, etc. They make to much easy money from them to remove them.
---
I’ll take your spot!  I’m looking to find a crew as I am unsure if most of my old cohorts are going to jump into Classic.
---
Swing and cast animations, how boots look along with other gear like helmets and capes. Tier sets. What my friends plan on playing. If I want to have an advantage making gold by farming or by other means.

Horde is favored in like everything except alterac valley bg. Stormwind is the best major city layout wise.

Bad way to steer your argument.
---
Not all fat people choose to be fat, some people have addictions of food beyond extents you could even imagine, you can certainly choose to not be fat albeit with an extreme amount of effort required to get to the other side, but falling into the rabbithole of food addiction is very easy, so easy infact you probably won't even notice you did until you are fat, in which point you are already deep into addiction, no one should have to be attracted to fat people but you're downright psychopathic if you think people destroying their bodies is in any way funny.
---
Close second for me
---
1. How awesome do the tier sets look
---
2. What are my friends playing
---
3. What can I play with 250ms from Australia
---
4. How popular is my class
---
But when the server names come out you know whats going to be the populated servers. when warhammer online came out we knew what the population was going to be like on each server, we knew Anlec was going to be the most populated PVE and Darklands the most populated PVE in Australia. because of the list of guilds signed up to each. Same will happen here.

We can test this. Try to not downvote the following statement.

I miss loot lag so much. 
---
I remember kn the 7 day vanilla CE head start getting stuck in loot lag for five while minutes.  Good times.
---
I actually plan on playing classic and hope it is a huge success.  That's the only way I see that developers will get the message that there is a market for more hardcore, old-school MMORPGs.  So I'm not frustrated at all about the hype that classic is getting, in fact I love it.
---
I like your MUD example.  That's good.  If there is a community of MUD players out there who look down on graphical MMORPGs, I wouldn't tell them to "get with the times" or anything like that.  We prefer what we prefer, and I prefer pre-WoW graphical MMORPGs.  Some people will be more hardcore than me (MUD players) some won't (literally every MMORPG since 2004), but I do believe a market exists here for what I'm talking about.
---
That's interesting, I did some googling around and couldn't find anything, you got a source?

Upvoted for honesty.  The rest of us can wait those 86 days out while we watch streams and leave fingernail tracks on our desks.

I don't get this, even as a 12 year old in 2006 I remember binding my abilities being the first thing I did, it just felt unnatural not to.

Well farming the Winterspring saber does make one quite accustomed to this zone :)

I doubt it, you seem pretty stupid and immature.
---
In any case, you're wrong, and your "argument" essentially boils down to anyone who doesn't make enough money as you allegedly did to just kill themselves.
---
Its also the loot issue.  If you are giving it your all, and some guy comes in with a meme spec, why should he get the loot when hes fucking around or contributing less?
---
Wish it had the option of plugging in more than one character, since I switched classes once my guild started doing BWL.
---
Agree with both of you so much. This is exactly how I have been feeling about it ever since WotLK, too.
---
I hated it when Cataclysm destroyed the old world and replaced it with this... new... questing experience. The old world was so precious because the zones all felt so natural and had a great atmosphere. The barrens is a great example. You could run through the zone, explore it in any direction and it just felt like you were in a real, natural world. Nowadays, the barrens just feels like a fucking crisis zone filled with quest hubs around every corner and questing through it feels like you are just thrown through some weird conflict parkour. There is not a single spot left in the barrens that is not part of some world-ending battle or besieged by evil forces or antagonistic factions, not a single spot left that isn't exploited as a "go here, kill 15 of this, loot 10 of that, rescue 3 named NPCs" location.

no clue

\#1 How good the T2 set looks for that class
---
\#2 PvE and PvP demand 
---
\#3 The ability to wield light and knowing how to swing it
---
And all of this gives a 330% damage increase to Shadow Oil? Because that's what you need for Rank 3 Shadowbolt to beat out Rank 6 Instant Poison. And that's assuming the rogue doesn't have improved poisons.

I completely understand the concern of a guide not being 100% accurate. And if I came across as an ass in my last post, I didn't intend that. I guess I've just gotten used to knowing that anything that is free online is not going to be perfect. Sure, a 1:1 guide that nails the experience all the way to 60 would be perfect, but if this is something that will at least get me through level 30, I'm super happy about that. And it would have been extremely tough to make a perfect guide up to this point when wrong exp values were being used for so long.
---
I agree that if it's left as-is, it's going to start to likely fall apart a bit at higher levels, but I guess I'll keep an eye out for other guides at that time. I just tend to hesitate to bash something for being somewhat off, when it was something done for free as a passion project. I leveled completely on my own in Vanilla. Having a non-perfect guide for Classic will still make leveling leagues better than how I had it before.
---
Although, if you do have a link for Navak's guide, I'd be interested in seeing it.
---
Awesome, unarmored mounts from pre 1.12!
---
Since they included these, I’d prefer if this armor piece from 1.6... and this weapon from 1.8 is amazing. And this potion was a bit better from 1.10. Since they did mounts, they can do there. Make some noise /r/classicwow!
---
may you get ganked and corpse camped throughout your entire classic. 
---
This infuriates me, when people don't group up to kill certain quest mobs and grief others on respawn timer.
---
Wow, that was pretty epic!
---
&gt;	threatened by its potential
---
Oh come on.
---
Radical idea but perhaps Classic's old school unforgiving nature doesn't appeal to everyone - and that's okay?
---
Saying anyone who dislikes the idea of Classic is "too young", "threatened" and "unwise" is pretty neckbeardy to be honest.
---
Streamers won’t have an affect on the overall population of players or a majority of players. They will have an affect on their servers.

It's definitely worth trying, if only for the memes. Something I haven't seen discussed a ton is that . . Well, Classic is here to stay. Lots of time to get lots of 60s well geared. If you sink a bunch if time doing something you enjoy, you're not wasting time. 
---
Plus, there's more of a spot for you now than ever. Since everyone is a lot more familiar with the PvE vs 15 years ago, you can afford to have a few people trying fringe builds. Just don't expect to get a spot on a bleeding edge guild
---
Which ones I've played in the past and which were the most fun.
---
While I enjoyed my rogue, paladin and lock in Vanilla - I'll be going mage first this time around because they are fun to play.
---
Hahahaha lol yes there is.
---
Or your guild doesn't have enough fury warriors.
---
Jeffery is a great guy and hilarious entertainer. You sound quite lonely.
---
You're the one that wants to cater to the 1% and alienate the 99% from enjoying the game...
---
I mean that's cool and all but you aren't talking about modern games you're talking about a game from 2004. Besides, shit like Project 1999 and other such things exist.
---
You deleted a level 54? That’s fucking insane, and then you did it again? What the fuck?!
---
Main problems at the time were:
---
- 8 debuff slots
---
- no addon to check who was 2nd on threat
---
- warriors didn't do that much damage because no good dps spec before 1.6 meaning you couldn't rely heavily on execute.
---
- And Vael was on a 1h timer adding some stress.
---
Some people can't pick Thier co-workers. I have an IT Networking degree, but live in the Midwest. The cool places to work are rare, and have hundreds of applications for any opening
---
Are the exploits in the beta? I would assume they would fix them, if not it will be like Vanilla was. With people getting the banhammer.
---
Definitely great additions. Best of luck dude!
---
Man, you're starting to sound like an anti-classic retail player.  Why should I be forced to play on buggy private servers?
---
Nope, Springfield
---
Yea but at least I don't have to hear the every weapon is a hunter weapon BS.  I can deal with casters fighting over cloth.
---
Yikes. Def hit a nerve with you lol. Have fun in classic buddy.
---
Found the dps warrior.
---
&gt; excellent in solo PvP
---
That's a stretch. Druids are great at running / staying alive in solo PvP.
---
#1 do I want to play this class?
---
#2 are there any other classes I want to play more?
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo
---
One percent of even the gaming community would be more than enough people to populate an MMORPG.
---
Shit joke sounded more like a question
---
Either way it wasn't the mage's dps but counting other players' dps for a single mage.
---
I almost forgot to mention I had a 46 UD rogue too that I deleted. I honestly have no clue what I was thinking... but hey I guess it just shows at the time 13 year old me wasn't too concerned about endgame lol.
---
TBH I am pretty pumped for 8.2
---
add a panel where it shows 3 months later after launch when its dead empty
---
&gt;Chuck Norris can fully gear a Rogue from Deadmines in 1 run.
---
It's sad how much I am laughing at this one.
---
Yes they are still in there.  Are they still in retail?
---
But to answer your question when it came out sure but not recently.
---
1v1 is an insignificant part of pvp. Yes warrior is the worst class in 1v1 and it loses to any other class but if you have a party for some heals/dispels things go the other way round.
---
Thank you!
---
Not for 15 years it wouldn't. Not with the budget Blizzard spends on WoW it wouldn't.
---
You want an entirely different game that most of us would never want to play.
---
Go find that game and leave us alone.
---
This can work both ways. 
---
It's a community game, so you work with what the people are bringing. You don't ignore a ret paladin because you want more dps, you work with him to finish the dungeon together as a group.
---
If I want to do a dungeon, I'll do it with whoever wants to join me. We'll do it together. Even if I have three times the dps as someone else. We all play the best we can and finish the dungeon as a group. This is what it's about, not creating the optimal group.
---
Never said the feelings were justified, that’s just the vibe these “classic sucks” people give off.
---
Solo leveling, farm ability, PvP enjoyment, and aesthetic. I’m pretty sure I’m committing to warlock. Friends are playing mage, rogue, and priest. I think it’ll work out nicely.
---
That’s crazy lol, I’ve deleted chars before but only ones that were around level 10 ish!
---
Same here. I still have it at the time of this comment.
---
I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say at this point. Do you spend any time thinking about what you type before doing so?
---
I think anyone who’s had a sub since 2004 you should get a beta tbh 
---
If anything they deserve it since they’ve been subscribers for so long and they’d be the ones Classic was aimed at anyway 
---
I can see if you want one and have only been playing since 2010 but 15 years is a long time
---
But players and servers are interconnected, affecting one affects the other. If you get Scarablord on your server, all other players won't be able to. If you corner the Devilsaur Leather market on your server, all players have to buy it through you.
---
I mean, just look at the closest example: large guilds. They have a large influence over servers and also have a big impact on the players on a server. Streamers communities are going to be much larger, I don't see how you can say they won't affect players on the regular.
---
Randy Johnson can kill 1 ball with 1 bird.
---
People always post low effort stuff like this. The only difference is people are upvoting it because of classic hype.
---
Alliance is gay
---
I think you should play Horde man, it's gonna be a fun experience. It is the better faction in my opinion, and you're gonna love it. Alliance is gonna have streamers but Horde usually always has a better PvP community
---
Vanilla hasn't existed since 2006, what are you talking about 15 years?  You can't claim the lasting power of expansions as a justification for the creation of vanilla.  The whole movement was created by people who outright rejected the expansions.
---
I'd also be surprised if Blizzard spent any serious money on this.  They will easily make back every penny they spent on this many times over.
---
How do you even define "casual" nowadays? It used to be people who can't sit in raid for 5 hours several days a week. Now it's evolved to be much less than that. The casuals in BFA are asking for raid content for fewer than 10-man. They are complaining that a 30 minute dungeon takes too long. 
---
If you are that casual then I can't see any future in Classic for you beyond just leveling. 
---
Most dungeons at 60 take at least an hour to run and that's not including the time it takes to get a group going, finding someone with a key and actually going to the dungeon and then the hunter forgot to buy arrows so he has to run back because the mage forgot to buy rune of portals, and so on. It's very difficult to get anything done in Classic in 30 minutes to an hour.    Say you get off work/school early and you have a few hours before the rest of your life demands attention. You look for a dungeon group but nobody is running anything. The only thing you can do in the world is grind gold. There are few reputation grinds you can work on while looking for a tank. There are few quest rewards that are worth anything. So in the end you just spend two hours standing in the city shouting for a tank. That's the reality of Classic and why it's not really a casual game by modern standards. I'm not saying it will always be like this, but you can't guarantee to get into a group like you can in modern MMOs. 
---
You can always PvP though, but battlegrounds won't be in for a while. The PvP rank grind is pretty hardcore, but at least it's something you can progress towards in small 15-30 minute chunks.
---
These definitely existed in vanilla. And it was a part of the game and strategy. Often times you would chase a FC up a wall and try to flush them out. Sometimes you would win and sometimes you wouldn't. I don't remember personally ever reporting anyone for this and never heard of people getting banned myself but I dont doubt it didnt happen. Whether or not that will also be consistent in classic remains to be seen. I do think however that this is not as much of an issue as we are making it out to be however. Anyways just my 2 cents
---
&gt;#nochanges
---
I don't get this. Some changes you want, some you don't?
---
Speeding it up doesn't change the gameplay. You say so yourself. 
---
&gt; They'll likely make the window slightly smaller
---
The only question is how much they speed it  up. But since small makes it feel better, they may as well just make it 1ms like it is in BfA.
---
I'm Sporff! I remember this video and that game. I read the Manno forums every day and was super excited when I saw it back then. I remember this game, I was spamming viper sting on Myaki every time we crossed paths. I don't really know why besides I was 16 and I knew who he was because of his trolling. At one point he spams in party chat about how I'm a no skilled and ran back to my corpse to viper sting him, I got a good laugh from that. Thanks for sharing, I tried to find this a few years ago on WarcraftMovies but it was behind a paywall.
---
And in defense that was my alt; I only had that badass rhok'delar because my guild had MC on farm. It cost me some sweet sweet dkp though.
---
Point out what you don't get and we'll review.
---
Dude, this is awesome!
---
I'll have to check it, cheers :)
---
They said they were going to fix exploits like that, I believe. Who knows, though.
---
God there couldn't be anyone more of a burden in your group hahah
---
A political argument in Barrens chat?  Never!
---
they're fun to level, but I quit vanilla 2 weeks after 60 because I was just... frostbolting... forever.
---
I'm rolling druid this time.
---
So I’m all for this website but I’m going to play devil’s advocate and say to the uninitiated “VanillaFriends.com” might look like a white supremacy site.
---
Did I ever say otherwise? All I'm trying to do here is counter the claim that he should be hired by blizzard based on what was shown in the clip.
---
Is it possible to just search the old server without signing up?
---
It’s killing me, I’ve been gaming for 20 years. There hasn’t been any game that has immersed me as much as classic wow/tbc. I just want to play it now and refuse to support retail. The only thing that’s come close is Hellblade, but even that is tiers below.
---
Oh really? Where did they say that?
---
So is the beta different from the stress test? Because I got into the stress test but I can't play anymore.
---
zuggity
---
1. How fun is this class....
---
yeah thats pretty much it
---
Fear ward
---
Dwarf is far superior for PvP.
---
Fear Ward + stone form are really strong.  Spirit isn't very important for shadow priests.
---
Ok thanks, that would explain why they were all gmail accounts. The gold and leveling spam should start soon.
---
Now that's something i had forgotten from vanilla, city chat gold spam.
---
Azshara is pretty terrible. It's obviously an unfinished zone but it's also just annoying in its layout. And for Alliance it's such a pain in the arse to have to go all the way there and then swim out to the water elemental and get your quintessence. Not a fan in any way.
---
&gt;  I plan on hitting 60 within 2-3 weeks so nobody is going to have good gear and I imagine being able to tank means I can get my t0 set quicker.
---
people will have pre raid bis, if not raid gear....
---
I'm almost certain the first warglaives usable by players were the Warglaives of Azzinoth in BC.
---
I loved his first videos 'chronicles of a gold farmer'
---
Holy power actually exists in vanilla, it's the 6-set T3 bonus.
---
Is this whole post a pasta? How can a game with 5 buttons where you can afk in arenas and heal to full every 10 seconds (for example) be more complex than vanilla? The skill floor much lower in vanilla? The skill floor lowered with each expansion from vanilla, not the other way round...
---
In my opinion, play what you feel will be the most immersive. Classic wow is all about the journey. I wouldn’t worry about what’s best because in the end, it’s about what feels the most fun to you. I think you would enjoy the game more if you loved by this rule.
---
If you’re totally into min maxing for PvP, go dwarf.
---
What class can tank if needed and do baller DPS, which is also super fun to play. Ez choice really.
---
Stances can be macro'd to the specific abilities required. It takes minimal effort to macro and it drops the "skill ceiling" people talk about with warriors.
---
If you get stress test you can only play during the stress test while beta players play the beta
---
Uncommon opinion, but I really don’t care much for beta access. It’s like playing a free trial. Yeah it would be cool to fuck around for a bit on there, but the fact that there’s no “permanence” to your actions makes me not really care at all. I’m perfectly satisfied just waiting a couple months so that when it finally gets released I’m fucking buzzing instead of being burnt out.
---
Although I did this meme, I’m actually taking my time. Maybe it’s because I’m now considered an old gamer.
---
McDonalds dollar menu is insane to those who eat gutter oil. Its all relative. Its insane only because YOU personally dont think its worth $1000. There are people right now on the beta who WONT give their access away for $1000 because its not enough. relative.
---
You can level to 30 and be bored instead of leveling to 10 and being bored.
---
If u like him watch him, if u dont then dont. People are always like this about people with big followings
---
I love PVPing there because people reset very quickly.
---
August 13th Blizzard will open servers so you can make your character before-hand.
---
Yeah, Ive been thinking about that too. I feel like I still have a retail WoW mindset of "damagE numberS" and gotta realize Classic is a whole different beast.
---
? War stomp and drop freezing trap
---
Don't remember unfortunately, might have been one of the earlier presentations they gave. Maybe someone else knows (or I could be wrong so meh).
---
Fear ward is definitely better than spirit and feedback. Just keep in mind that it's a holy spell so you can't cast it in shadowform.
---
Selfie camera 📷. 
---
Reeeeeeeereeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Unless they want fresh feedback rather than “this isn’t what I remember” reported as bugs constantly
---
Oh no a place with free speech, quick make it stop
---
Any reason you aren't considering nelf? Personally I prefer FEMNight elf &gt; all for cast animations. They look great in cloth as well. Another thing to not forget is wisp form... dying sucks, and some of the GY runs are AWWWWWWWWEFULLLL.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter. Half of thoose never reach 60. Half of the 60 are incapable of playing the class. A 40 man raid requires 8 warriors at minimum. You can do the math. There can NEVER be enough warrior in vanilla servers.
---
this is true for every class, except for the 8 requirement. which i dont think will hold true for classic.
---
People who ruin their body are unattractive.
---
If someone literally cant  even take care of their body how do they handle a relationship. It's a textbook red flag.
---
I wouldn't date a meth addict and I wouldn't date a fat person
---
Dont need beta to "test" the game if you played in 2004.
---
WoW needs that refresh rate. Without it you're gonna be at a big disadvantage in both PvE and PvP. I suggest you upgrade to the 2080ti as well.
---
That's the one.
---
That sucks huge kodo balls.
---
Anyone knows which movie this is from?
---
Always nice to have a water vendor with you as a warlock.
---
I've thought about it. I love Night Elves and that may be the race for me. A big part of me still has the retail WoW mindset of MinMaxing and everything, but I feel like I have to take Classic as a whole different beast and immerse myself rather than push out the max DPS and potential.
---
Which is why they should have a healthy mix of both.
---
there is a crit cap
---
Stoneform and Fear Ward is far superior to Perception and Feedback. The spirit you get on human is negligible.
---
Are you implying no player from vanilla got beta? That’s a huge stretch and I’d be impressed if you could prove that isn’t the case
---
I don't see why they can't just invite people without a subscription but require them to have one to play. 
---
I'd be totally fine with resubscribing if to play but I'm not going to do it to have a chance at playing.
---
I think it is a very lame reason to say it’s part of the strategy. The core of wsg is 10 v 10 capture the flag within the battlefield. To say there is this special thing you can do outside the battlefield to extend game time is just... weak.
---
If you think it should be this way to keep the classic feeling, you’re being short sighted. I want wow to build and mature with the specific classic style. I want a class balanced classic with content being introduced in the future staying true to classic. Classic is great, but there are many things that can be changed staying true to classic rpg.
---
I hope someone records it and uploads to youtube

&gt;  Maxing out around 10 person dungeons
---
*dungeon
---
Because, you're wrong apparently to the millions of Nochange members /s. We shall see who the actual majority is in game, considering Reddit isn't even close to the majority.
---
&gt; How is raid tanking on a warrior?
---
better than tanking as other classes....
---
You're already really annoying to speak with, but okay. Both of your comments were completely irrelevant to the discussion, like they're replying to something in a vacuum and you've completely forgotten that we're talking about your original post, here. Not to mention bizarro accusations that make no sense either.
---
I loved Uldum, and some Pandaria zones, but those are the only zones I can think of from later expansions, and Cata/Pandaria was a long time ago now. WoD Nagrand and Vol'dun feel far more cluttered. They may have some open spaces but places like Vol'dun are still beset by very far ranging verticality, and places like WoD Nagrand have hostile mobs blanketing every inch of land. You can't look across the entire zones like you used to, and they seem incapable of making zones these days that don't feel constantly hostile to be in.
---
This clutter problem felt like it affected around half the zones in Cata and Pandaria, and pretty much all the zones in WoD onwards. Just because a zone has some open space in spots doesn't mean it doesn't feel cluttered, other things like mobs, foliage and decoration contribute to that too. While I can respect their attention to detail, they seem afraid to leave some areas as they are and feel the need to add at least \*something\* everywhere. There's no more just sparse forests with 1-2 quest hubs, no more truly open fields without sticking a house, a road, a quest hub and 13 rare mobs in between.
---
It's just their design ever since Cataclysm of moving toward a theme park structure, they feel like everything in every zone has to have a reason for being there. It never feels like maybe one developer decided to put a random tree somewhere because they wanted to anymore, everything feels artificially and articulately designed for a purpose, and while that itself is admirable and fun in a way, it doesn't feel natural. I get burnt out from it.
---
Places like Vol'dun may be open in parts, but they suffer from the same design and still \*feel\* cluttered. It's hardly like Tanaris which truly feels like a desolate expanse with a tiny town in the corner.
---
No.  You don't deserve beta access.  That's not the point of a beta.  You're being rewarded with classic.  However they choose or randomize beta invites is hopefully to best serve the beta which makes our classic experience better.
---
I played all of vanilla including the entire closed beta.  I deserve nothing.  I got more then i paid for and I look forward to paying for classic come August.
---
I wonder how much of this guy's story ark they had planned out in 2004.
---
It was released November 23, 2004, that's 14 years and 6 months. You seriously know nothing about this game.
---
And yes you absolutely can claim the success of the expansions. Burning Crusade and WotLK nearly doubled the playerbase. They both had budgets of over $50 million.
---
WoW cost $200 million in the first 4 years of operation and $63 million to develop. They grew from 1.5 million subscribers to 10 million subscribers during that time. If they'd made YOUR game, they'd have gone from 15,000 to 100,000, but they wouldn't, because the game would never of had such broad appeal to reach critical mass. But let's give you those 1% numbers anyway and also assume that the operation cost 1% as well. That's ~$62 million in subscription fees. So they're $3 million in the hole thanks to you. Good job.

1993 Jurassic Park
---
&gt;As someone else mentioned, these are more on a sliding scale . . .
---
K. I still don't think it's an issue, but I guess you do? Nothing about MMOs requires what you or I define as a sandbox.
---
&gt;Calling selling what you get from gathering professions . . .
---
Why is it a stretch? But for your gathering professions, you will have less money. Money is important—vastly so—for your mounts. They help. And I also didn't say anything about completely replacing all gear with sets. I'm saying that the professions can provide you with steady upgrades as you level them. There's no reason or need for the professions to be *mandatory*, which they would be if they provided BiS full sets regularly while leveling.
---
&gt;I find the trash clears boring, repetitive, and entirely too long . . .
---
Then don't run instanced dungeons. There are multiple locations in Vanilla WoW that are large and sprawling, full of elites, and able to be cleared by multiple groups (e.g., Jintha'Alor, Stromgarde Keep, or Tyr's Hand), which can provide good money, good drops, and are scattered across multiple level brackets. You want a sandbox? Then make the game a sandbox. It is as you make it. I was never bored in dungeons because I enjoyed my groups, I liked the idea of a band of adventurers forging deep into enemy territory, and the loot itself was a nice bonus. Your trash clears would still be boring and repetitive to you if the dungeons weren't instanced; you'd just have the illustrious boon of getting to a location where a boss was supposed to be, but some other group already killed it and now you have to wait, but oh no, there are actually multiple groups there and you either need to fight for a tag or form a queue. You think trash clears are boring? I think fighting and/or waiting for uninstanced bosses is boring. Congrats, we both have opinions.
---
&gt;I'm going to go ahead and say that killing someone in real life . . .
---
Congratulations on being a pedantic asshole. *Obviously killing people irl is different than fighting for mobs.* I was making an analogy about how societies enshrine rules as opposed to simply accepting that everyone agrees to unpunishable norms. And if the game mechanics should not limit griefing, then congratulations, you've just opened a Pandora's box of sliding scales. Mobs having fast spawn times limits griefing, because that means griefers can't hog all resources in an area. Therefore all mobs should only spawn once every 10 minutes. Sure, it's fine, everyone will agree to not fight over them. But we can't have hand-holding carebear nonsense, so if you really want to get that mob, better be prepared to tag it. Oh, and your own faction members should be able to kill you whenever like in the alpha. Because we shouldn't allow these carebears to take over. Also, when you tag a mob, you can no longer CC people who are attacking you. See, if you could CC people, that would be the game limiting available griefing. The community should simply *accept* that CC is forbidden in fights and that nobody should attack you and that mob spawns should be handled in an orderly fashion. Actually making these things game mechanics would be safe, sanitized, hand-holding, carebear nonsense.
---
Let people enjoy their fucking game, dude. This is almost combative for the sake of contrarianism. Should PvE servers also not exist, because allowing the two factions to be unflagged is "carebear nonsense"? Let's force them all onto PvP servers, because otherwise carebears!
---
Norms form around the rules of engagement. There were still ways to be a total raging asshole to people farming nearby. General Vanilla WoW rules dictated that if a person was running toward a mob, and you were currently in a fight with another one, you shouldn't tag that mob with a ranged attack to grief the other farmer. Griefers could still do that. Congratulations, you still have griefing.
---
Of all your arguments, this is the most absurd one. It's not "carebear" to have a tap looting system. It's simply a different system, susceptible to its own types of griefing, but not to other types of griefing that were prevented by the game coding, just like any other multiplayer game has certain types of accessible griefing and certain types of impossible griefing.
---
&gt;The fact you think this has anything to do with skinning says more than I think . . .
---
I was using Skinning as an example, because in Vanilla WoW a Skinner could not skin a corpse that wasn't looted. That was the single biggest reason why one would want to enforce a "lootable after X minutes" rule. Your argument is silly in comparison. A person won an item and didn't loot it? That's nice for you. *They won it.* They can do whatever they want to do to it, including leaving it on the corpse, just like they could pick it up, pull it onto the screen, and destroy it. The WoW developers clearly didn't want loot to toggle FFA after X minutes or be available to players who weren't in a group with whoever killed a mob. This is, again, a total opinion argument with no meaningful objective reason why WoW's system is worse than "scavenger" systems (or why scavenger systems are worse than WoW's system, since I'm not arguing that either is better than the other).
---
&gt;Okay. It's still a punishment that shouldn't exist. 
---
Disagreed. Cool how one can simply say they don't like a thing and that counts as an actual argument, right? Because that's what you're doing. So that's what I'll do. It's a punishment that *should* exist, because I think it should.
---
&gt;Yeah, I'm not saying that if a mob kills you and someone finds your corpse, they can loot it.
---
Alright. I don't think players should, either, unless WoW changed its entire looting structure (like that one private server where all skills are randomized and you can toggle some sort of super hatred mode that allows you to loot or be looted). WoW as it existed could never, *ever* allow players to loot enemy corpses for actual gear or bag items in PvP. That would have required a totally different approach to collecting items and gear, and it would have made WoW a totally different game.
---
&gt;I wasn't thinking about adding repair costs to pvp deaths, but something like XP loss and being able to loot all non-soulbound items. 
---
Literally insane. You're telling me that if I'm in a high level PvP zone farming, and a group of five people come along and blow me out of the water, they're allowed to take several hundred gold worth of collected Black Lotuses, food, cloth, BoE gear, and everything else that isn't nailed to my person? Play a different game, dude. That's not Warcraft. If you don't like WoW, then don't play it.
---
&gt;Welcome to actual twinking. This is exactly what gear laddering is. Twinking should require some thought beyond "I am that level."
---
Sooooo, micromanagement for the sake of micromanagement. Got it. Well, once again, the system you're describing is in no way objectively better than the system WoW has until you actually provide an argument as to why your suggested method is superior, and it's an argument convincing enough to sway detractors. I'll wait for it.
---
&gt;This effectively only discourages creative . . .
---
So you want a different game. Got it.
---
Really, almost all of your arguments have boiled down to, "I don't like this feature because I don't, and other games did it differently, so WoW should have used those systems instead of the systems it did use, which allowed it to utterly destroy every competitor and claim a monopoly on the genre market for a decade. Because I don't like it."
---
It's totally fine if you want to play EVE Online. Other people do, too. But could you see how farcical it would be for a WoW player to go onto an EVE forum and say "Look, here are some legitimate criticisms of EVE. First off, instead of EVE's PvP system, it should have WoW's. Also, instead of EVE's economy, it should have WoW's. Also, instead of EVE's customization, it should have WoW's. Also, instead of EVE's guild system, it should have WoW's. Also, instead of EVE's loot system, it should have WoW's. Why? Because I like WoW better than EVE, and WoW has a bigger market share. Therefore all you EVE players can go fuck yourselves, because EVE should be WoW."
---
No. EVE should be EVE. There are players who like EVE and should be able to keep liking EVE. WoW's systems worked for WoW and made it popular among people who liked WoW more than other games. Maybe some players liked both EVE and WoW for their own reasons. But claiming it's a "legitimate criticism" to smply decry a MMO's subsystem as being different than another MMO's subsystem that you liked better, for little reason other than "I like that other one better", is silly. I like Path of Exile. In fact, I *love* Path of Exile. It has a lot of things you're describing. It has an open-ended talent tree with base stat acquisition, gear that has to be carefully stacked to wear it properly at times, infinite customization with skill gems, a true sandbox mode where you're allowed to exploit some gamebreaking interaction and become a literal god, deaths that make you lose XP, extreme micromanagement, and grouping that barely punishes you in any meaningful manner.

If someone told me that they want WoW to be like PoE, I'd laugh right in their face. I like WoW because it's WoW. I like PoE because it's PoE. The two games are different. Neither is better than the other, and they both have plenty of players. WoW does not need to emulate a gotdanged thing from PoE to be a great game.
---
Maybe you should accept that your other MMOs are different for difference's sake, appreciate them for what they were, and appreciate WoW for what it is, instead of trying to foist systems from those other games into one that clearly wasn't designed with such systems in mind and would not lose any quality by avoiding such systems.
---
I've spoken my piece. Good day.
---
Yes, because I stared at it for hours while my game installed.
---
Go to the classic wowhead page, and go to the dressing room.
---
Play around with some sets and see which character looks better to you, in classic most people don’t have time for an alt so you want your guy to look bad ass. Everything else doesn’t matter too much
---
It is affected by it and it does NOT consume charges. It basically has to be a direct damage cast spell. Things like Shadow Oil and even the old Lupos were counted as 'dots' when interacting with ISB.
---
&gt; Not to mention that the tank meta in classic has shifted to fury specced tanking once you get the gear for it. 
---
this is only true on pservers. and it might happen on classic, but certainly isnt the meta
---
whoa, that one specific instance destroyed all 8 other classes and the other faction! incredible!
---
Cool
---
??? $200 for your character to be wiped clean? Film your self just buying two bennies.
---
i dont think fury tank will be the  *meta*
---
Myaki is a she! But that's hilarious. We hated Viper Sting because it was pretty much the only thing that made it impossible to last long in outnumbered fights.
---
Back dat Tangthang up
---
That reminds me of my Blue Companion Hukthang
---
Great, what does any of this have to do with classic, releasing this August?
---
PS - your post is, by your logic, justification for why classic shouldn't happen, and we should get a TBC/wrath server instead.
---
Anyone who played wow since cata deserves beta even less for supporting the downward spiral of our crack addicted best friend blizzard as the QOL suffered over and over and they kept enabling.  Finally we have an intervention!
---
Just joking... Sort of.
---
The lag is extremely annoying when looting. Worse than Everquest in 1999. God awful.
---
Or buy an IPS monitor which will look way better at 60/75hz than a TN at 144hz...
---
For a lot of people that's enough though to satisfy the WoW itch. Plus, you can practice leveling routes, dont just have to do what some are during and playing the 30 meta.
---
I imagine the level cap will ATLEAST go up to 40. Surely they need to have other parts of the game tested besides 1-30 (I know the Alpha currently has a cap of 50 I think, but still.)
---
I'm also curious how Shadow Oil beats out Instant poison, if you wouldn't mind explaining :)
---
I played a bear in TBC and they were real good.  I didn't play one in Vanilla so I don't know how much they changed.  If they are like theri TBC version, then I would think they would be excellent.
---
In TBC they relied heavily on crazy high dodge and armor.  But you had to be defense capped still to be considered as a tank.  I don't know if Vanilla bears could get def capped.
---
I wonder which sword would be bigger Armadyl Godsword or Thunderfury
---
Jumping on this.  I recognized several names and guilds and it was a fun nostalgia trip. 
---
Give it a try super easy to search and painless to join too.
---
i think the issue i have is that someone said its meta
---
which it wont be, fury tank is only required when the dps can down a boss in 2 minutes or less, and then its only possible if the healers can keep up the tank. Which wont be the go to tactic.
---
Min/maxing go dwarf. 
---
Otherwise just go whatever makes you happy :)
---
Hey man, thanks for needlessly insulting me there.  Really appreciate it.
---
Both my comments make total sense to me given what you said.  You told me to play on project1999, which is a buggy private server.  That's the excuse retail players gave private server vanilla players (Go PlAy On YoUr PrIvAtE sErVeRs).  So that's why I said you sounded like them.  All clear now?
---
I think the Current tick rate on live is like 50 times per second, but changes dynamically, classic is 5. 
---
Difference is HUGE. 
---
Smart move, need to spend less on server tech lol.
---
I’ve seen a couple names I remember, lots of guild names I remember as well. It’s been a fun nostalgia trip. 
---
I keep checking every couple hours lol
---
Yes. The music. Hands down tied with grizzly hills as my all time favorite zone. The music is always what gets my nostalgia going.
---
I think the reason TBC sprung to mind for me is because this would happen if you took fall damage after dismounting your flying mount and immediately trying to drink, it'd get cancelled pretty often. It's definitely bringing some memory back for sure lol.
---
Which is the most immmersive race and class.
---
This could end up with hurt feelings and destroy a previously solid working relationship. There's no reason to risk it.
---
Surely they will, free youtube content and every streamer involved will be streaming (Soda, Soni, etc)
---
fear ward trivializes a lot of MC and BWL for alliance.
---
Classic is only happening because of the success from 15 years ago.
---
And you can't just drop players in on the 2nd or 3rd act of an amazing trilogy even when they're re-watching it.
---
Time and time again you've shown you know nothing about business, nothing about history, and nothing about this game.
---
I forgot i had this bookmarked - in case your interested in druids.

Yeah I agree. Ambience is where it's at, with music not looped. It feels really good when the music just occasionally drops and the buzzing of all the wildlife and shit is singing along with it.

My goal was stormwind. So it worked?!
---
Most of what's been thrown around in these responses are absolutely true, protection paladins aren't very useful in raids.   
---
That being said, have some decent thorns gear and queue up with a pocket healer or two for Alterac Valley and stand on the bridge and let waves and waves of the unwashed horde crest against your mighty bow.   
---
I wouldn't main protection paladin myself, but I'll be gathering some plate +stam +thorns gear and do this once and a while.
---
was that in the battle group with aerie peak? i think i remember seeing them in bgs
---
I agree that no one 'deserves' beta access
---
But it's not random, a big portion of it depends on your hardware config, as they want to test a variety of hardware configurations and physical locations, to catch any sort of weird issues that cause issues, to fix them before they launch the game to the rest of the community.
---
I don't even have access to my original account, and yet I still fully support giving beta access to those who do. SO it's not about jealousy. I'd also extend that to say that anyone who was in the demo last fall absolutely deserves a spot.
---
&gt;Speeding it up doesn't change the gameplay. You say so yourself. 
---
Where did I say that? Spell batching had extremely noticeable effects in PvP, and I want those effects to be reimplemented as accurately as possible. What are these changes you say I want?
---
&gt;The only question is how much they speed it up. But since small makes it feel better, they may as well just make it 1ms like it is in BfA.
---
No. When I say "slightly smaller", I mean "if the current window is emulating periods of time longer than .2 seconds, which was the Vanilla spell batching window, then it should be shortened to as close to .2 seconds as possible, and not a millisecond under." It would be a different game if it had modern instantaneous server-side ability recognition. I, and the other people actually enthusiastic about this game for its own sake, don't want a different game. We want Vanilla WoW rebooted. Vanilla WoW had spell batching. We want spell batching, and Blizzard has already confirmed long ago that they were going to reimplement spell batching, and they've already done so. All that remains is to tweak it until it's as close to the original as possible. If you don't want that, then don't play Classic, since one of Classic's central game mechanics is apparently distasteful to you.
---
1- maybe your the rookie scrub
---
2- appear off line
---
3-do you work with children that you need to protect their feelings?
---
Lol I actually usually tank.  I’m just joking about it because the reply was a little specific haha
---
Lame that its limited to 32 entrants and was hard as a non-streamer to find information on until it was filled.
---
This is a riding the fence answer, but why not both? When you’re friends are on play horse, when they’re not play alliance.
---
So just like on private servers. I always thought that was a bug because the talent specifically says "non-periodic", which I understand as excluding dots.

How often do you think you'll regret not having fear ward? Is it really going to be the difference between having a raid spot or not? Maybe... but if that's the case, idk if I'd personally want to be in a raid that's that elitist. Even in pvp, there's only a handful of fears, and I would see shadowmeld as being helpful in equally as many situations as stoneform is in pvp. Perception is nice, but with how abundant humans are going to be for warriors / rogues, I don't see it being as necessary. However every time I die in searing gorge  etc.though... part of me will wish I had wisp form. I mean lets face it... one of the most annoying things that happens in classic is getting ganked, lagging, pulling too many mobs and dieing, then realizing your run back is across half the map. Night elves reduce this problem substantially. There's also the added satisfaction of being in a group of night elves all shadowmelded and just popping out onto unsuspecting victims. TBH every race for every class has it's own niche, some more common than others, but there's no "perfect choice" if your goal is to play both pvp and pve
---
Horde wouldn't even be driving a BMW, would be driving something ugly or beat up as fuck.
---
Yes! That was the original plan. I really wish they had stuck with that. It would make hero classes unique. As of right now they just start at a higher level but are otherwise a regular class.
---
I think mediocre damage can RNG its way through Vael. (Could also try grabbing world buffs.) Chromag is a good point... I guess it would depend on how many worthless hybrids we're talking about. As long as you still had \~4 mages or \~4 warlocks, you could wait for the right vulnerability and get through the burn phase.   
---
I think assuming your healers and tanks are solid, you can fill your raid group with **quite a few** worthless players. It would just leave less slack for everybody else.  
---
Imagine you're doing Nefarian with very few mages and warlocks for AOE. What happens if two of your AOEers get killed? That could be a raid-wipe. Is that the margin of error you want to play with? Hell no! But you can go that route and be pretty successful right up to AQ40.
---
If it's really such a problem with the horde races then deviate fish are pretty cheap hordeside.
---
I'm for barbershops in vanilla as long as they only retained all the original features for your character
---
It was a different time bud, I understand.
---
Yo he's wearing a red eye mask over his black eye mask...
---
I was running on the ground for multiple seconds lmao
---
They were
---
Never not fear ward.
---
Haha yeah we would be flintstoneing are asses.
---
Just what he's practiced all this time.
---
When in doubt, read the story.
---
Humans want all other races, even their allies, extinguished. They’re the Nazis.
---
Night Elves are responsible for the planet nearly destroying itself time and time again. They’re the Russians.
---
Dwarves fight amongst themselves and dig shit up they shouldn’t. They’re the Australians.
---
Gnomes just make cool shit no one thinks is very useful. They’re the Swiss.
---
Orcs just don’t want to be slaves, to demons or anyone else. They’re the Black Americans.
---
Trolls just want a home. They’re the Israelis.
---
Tauren just want people to love the planet. They’re the Canadians.
---
Undead just want freedom and revenge against the Lich King. They’re the White Americans.
---
So, do you want to have to make new friends with a bunch of Nazis?
---
Or do you want to hang out with your current friends just looking for a bit of freedom?
---
Yea, 144HZ looks unmistakably smoother.
---
Doesn’t really matter as long as you have the wand damage talent.
---
144Hz is a trap! Once you've started using it you can't go back to 60Hz ever again! And because 144Hz is more demanding it means newer games will look like shit unless you have a legit computer.
---
Play what you want and play with friends and I’m sure they’ll give you a shot at tanning since it’s kind of everyone’s job to manage threat in vanilla. 
---
Memory of certain specs are tainted from pservers, but I’m sure people will figure out weird janky specs since the fights are so mechanically simple.
---
&gt; I don't see why they can't just invite people without a subscription
---
Well the could, but they want as much money as possible.
---
Actually he won't stop. But I am. I've said all I care, or need, to say.
---
but Tribe is a solid player whos played for 8+ years and North is a clown mage whos new to vanilla pservers?
---
Dude no one cares if your a clicker if you get out of the fire, hold threat, reach good dps numbers, etc
---
So many clickers in Vanilla and TBC succeeded at the game.
---
Pvp is the tougher thing for a keyboard turner.  But very few will be hardcore enough where it matters.
---
Clicker is just so memed everyone oretends half of vanilla didn't click and succeed at the game....
---
PSA they did.
---
It’s easy, just think of it as having small, medium, and big versions of your heal. For shaman, rank 4 healing wave is your small heal because it’s the lowest version that still gets your full +heal at level 60. 
---
Lower level spells get more effective the more +heal and regen you get. Like think having a 400 heal grow to 800 that you can eventually chain cast is a bigger deal than a 2,000 heal grow to 2,400 that runs your mana empty quickly
---
Do you follow the joana guide?
---
I'm taking my time too.... In a way because I'm about to be playing every possible second I can get away from work / family haha.
---
I use the same criteria. Short list really.
---
Deciding which race (horde) is what’s really screwing me over.
---
&gt; Where did I say that?
---
You said they'll likely make the window smaller.
---
How are you fine with that but not fine with changes?
---
The last stress test scratched my "beta itch". Sure a beta invite would be nice, but I am just waiting for the official servers!
---
Still better than looking at people nowadays. I can barely make out ugly people now that everyone wears half a kilo of make up.
---
Asmongold sent me here to upvote this.
---
Hi guys :D
---
Why?
---
They're friendly to the Horde and yet dance around a Tauren head hanging by a rope...
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=13285 So good on hunter dude :D
---
IIRC, warriors are reliably one of the most popular classes, but there still does tend to be an above-average demand for them. Their demand changes slightly over time. They're basically the opposite of rogues in that regard.   
---
In MC/BWL, you could happily run 8 rogues. But by the time you're in naxx, people start favoring fury warriors, so raids often do naxx with as few as 3 rogues. (Being able to swap to a tanking-role makes fury far more adaptable, too.)
---
yeah so... again, mediocre at everything, not the best at anything. combat res is not a best category lol
---
Haha. Yeah, I deleted a level 20 warrior and regretted it immensely. I was unhappy with his haircut I think? And said fuck that guy lol
---
There are three main things that I think should be introduced into classic. None will break the immersion or rpg experience.
---
1.) Graphics are so mich better in retail and if you think they shouldn’t be updated in classic, you’re being stubborn against progression of the classic style of rpg.
---
2.) A better way to handle respec. Whether it be allowing dual spec or free respecs in inns, either way is better than how classic wow handled talent reallocation.
---
3.) Class role viability. If you have a talent tree dedicated to survivability and tanking, it should be just as viable as the others eith their own strengths and weaknesses given the scenario.
---
oh yeah, hard choice. im going alliance so: human.
---
i think for horde though trolls for tanking, orc for arms. not sure for fury? i dunno. GL!  
---
i found https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-warrior-pve-tanking pretty good as a refresher.
---
This guy is accurate. In a 2v2 duel format, paladin/warrior is arguably the strongest combo in the game. Priest/warrior doesn't have great synergy, but at the end of the day it's still a healer and a warrior, so you can get things done. It's just not 100% optimized. Play what you enjoy!
---
What a dickbag.
---
Looking for your gay bro
---
If you're talking about who deserves a spot in beta you are fucking stupid and don't understand what a beta is.
---
100% this guys a douche
---
It’s a content release schedule. Not a balance - Quality or life release schedule, otherwise we’d see bug changes as well as balance patches progressive as well - which completely voids their idea of starting at vanillas most complete form - the final patch
---
Try 400 ms from Australia, nostalgia is a hell of a drug
---
Instead of 144hz, bump up the resolution. I play on 1440p and it’s niiice. It’s gonna be nuts, I played on dial up with about 15 FPS when classic was live.. now I’m gonna be 120 FPS 1440p with low latency.
---
Grizzly Hills
---
Stonetalon Mountains. Too narrow, annoying quests, wishing you were still in the Barrens killing zhevras.
---
Ok good for you.
---
&gt;off-spec gear is off-spec gear
---
If you meet a warrior under 60, prot *is* their off-spec. They need to level just as much as a paladin, and they're entitled to roll on the dungeon gear that helps them do that. If there was a rule that warriors tanking a low level dungeon couldn't roll on two-handers then you'd have a hard time finding a tank for those dungeons. 
---
&gt;What if a ret rolled need on a shield would you be ok to compete on that gear despite you being the tank in that particular dungeon?
---
I don't care what happens to a shield in a low level dungeon. Unless there's another instance that they plan on doing soon that shield will probably be vendored before equipping it a second time.
---
Of the 8 warriors in my raid group, there was 1 MT and 7 fury warriors , most of those fury warriors had assignments to off tank on certain packs.
---
Some examples of this would be the packs after vaelastrasz, where there would be a warrior tank each of the non caster adds.
---
Another example of this would be the champion packs in AQ 40.
---
Not only did the fury warriors have to carry tanking gear in bags for their respective assignments they also needed to dps on bosses while always attempting to pad threat in case it ever fell off the MT, what I mean by this is fury warriors had to make sure they were all below the MT on threat , if ever a situation where something unexpected occurred to the MT then the warrior whom is next on the treat meter would be able to pick the boss up.
---
My initial comment wasn't meant to sound like warriors didn't dps, on the contrary , fury warrior is the best dps in the game and is the most stacked spec in any raid, but it doesn't stop there because most warriors needed to dps AND tank.
---
Dwarf for PvP and PvE. Everytime.
---
Your not fooling anybody you nerd.
---
Haha yeah, ally has it pretty easy to decide the best. 
---
I’ve been pservering it up as a Tauren tank all the way to 60. Definitely not optimal.
---
Trolls are the best for sure, zerkering is THE SHIT, but I hate the animations and no shoes mon. 
---
Orc has that stun resist + axe spec - probably gunna roll that when classic rolls around. Since I likely won’t be MTing, would be OT in raids or fury, 
---
Tauren - pretty meh. War stop is situational in 5 mans, 5% health is meh as well.
---
Undeads racial is pretty overkill too since wars already get zerker rage. Tho cannabalize is dope for leveling.
---
Winterspring 60 virgin here, for me it was the Chimeras in NE winterspring. Probably inefficient as fuck, but that's what my little frost mage desired to end it on.
---
You're not. Wing Clip / Concussive macros haven't been possible since TBC. None of your others will work either.
---
With warriors you can just have /use charge on one line and /use hamstring on the other and it works
---
Hi, /u/Za7hor
---
I'd pull the loot dragons in BWL down a notch, same with Lashlayer. I'd bump Skeram up a bit and pull all the other AQ40 bosses down except CT. Like if we're looking at this from a "normal" gearing and not overgeared point of view I'd say Razorgore and Vael are far more difficult than most of AQ40 and even a few Naxx bosses. Patchwerk is just a gear check, Anub is nothing and Noth is also pretty easy. 
---
Sapphiron is quite easy as long as you have enough frost resistance. KT is definitely hard though and 4H is arguably the toughest boss for newcomers in the game. Afaik during vanilla many guilds were stuck on 4H forever but once they finally got past them they got Sapph and KT down fairly quickly.
---
Lol exactly. Why do people feel entitled to play a character that gets whipped?
---
Stay away from the voodoo
---
Is this out?  I thought it wasn’t for a few more months
---
You can also just AutoHotKey to swap between the two over and over.
---
Yeh like normal the vanilla tooltip is quite limited.
---
Where do you live? China? O.o
---
Takk the Leaper is a very special pet. As far as I know, it was the only pet back in the day that could run so fast, you could effecitvely daze / dismount players on epic mounts with it. No escape from this one.
---
It's a completely seperate launcher and list. Different client all together.
---
Tauren hitbox was the bane of one of our tanks in vanilla...so he says anyway. Could just have been terrible. I always went orc as  a horde warrior. Until blood elfs anyway. Yeah i wouldnt want to play a troll either. Ewww.
---
Because of deadmines I think.
---
Yeah, fury are top DPS when naxx comes around. They're also pretty good in AQ40 gear.
---
nO cHaNgES
---
All spells below level 20 get reduces effect from +heal and spelldamage. So yeah it's usually around rank 4-5.
---
Macros that execute conditional statements "play the game for you" and will not work in classic, as per blizz
---
You're right. It's going to take thousands and thousands of hours.
---
Oh yeah, whip me baby, harder! 
---
Oh wait, this isn't Moonglade Goldshire? 😝
---
Yeah, in retail can't you just put a bunch of abilities in order, and any that you can't use because of range/cooldown/cost just get skipped until something triggers or the end is reached? It seems like it makes it easier to set up simple "use X if I can't use Y" macros while killing stuff like decursive that checks for more than just an ability being able to cast.
---
Sooooo Paladin
---
Could an addon like lazy macros help with this? I don't remember how I did this in TBC and I have been searching for macros online.
---
They remind me of vegans who opt to tell you about it just because, or anyone else that just spouts information in hopes it makes them look better and / or more intelligent.
---
....it shall stay
---
Through the water until you get to Barrens.
---
Teldrassil for me.
---
\*need an active sub anyway
---
This comment gave me nostalgia for Barrens chat.
---
True true..
---
Which is exactly what is needed in world/open pvp
---
Yo this is exactly me. Hit me up.
---
You're not answering the question. I wanted to learn something instead you're sidestepping. Here's your chance. Educate us.
---
I want exactly this but Horde :(
---
I noticed a lot of people are installing addons that track quests on your map cause they cant take 2 seconds to read “go north”
---
I signed up a few days ago w/ hopes that some people I played w/ back in the day will find me.
---
Dwarf is the only acceptable answer. Fear ward is incredibly useful for a number of the early raid encounters, and incredibly useful in PVP.
---
Lol k.
---
25% stun resist.
---
Yeah, I know I'm in the minority here but I recently resubbed like a pleb hoping for a shot at beta so I started exploring the new world and I actually like some of the newer models. Seems like they royally fucked up hair though. Human males all look like they have ps2 hair.
---
Ironic considering most of the people on this sub are tryhards who couldn't care less about community unless they add something tangible to the party.
---
You mean [This](https://imgur.com/gallery/AThZDgv) good ole meme?
---
Use Sunder, if u have Rage to spare use Heroic Strike as well because it isn't on the gcd, use Revenge every time its up unless you're tanking a boss and it doesn't have 5 stacks of Sunder on
---
The only hard part is holding aggro on multiple enemies, ideally you should be given time to pool your threat, but something you can do is tab target Sundering every other mob while using Heroic Strike on the in between mobs so, Sunder tab Heroic tab Sunder tab Heroic. This lets you aggro a bunch of mobs quickly, but you have to be very comfortable with your weapon speed to do this and have a lot of rage to spare, but the idea is that you get high threat on multiple mobs in half the time you would just using tab target Sunder, e.g. 6 mobs would take 3 Sunder's and 3 Heroic's taking 4.5s gcd, without this it would be 6 Sunder's taking 9s of gcd
---
Should have dropped your phone number and asked
---
Well since I'm playing a Warrior I'll feel thrilled but burnt out, will probably take a week off from playing the moment I hit 60.
---
Did I play this class in Vanilla?
---
Does this class get a faster mode of travel at any point before level 40 mount?
---
Will this class get an easy raid spot?
---
Answer was a Shaman and was a yes to all three. I never played one in Vanilla.
---
More screwed than a tank who could keep running dungeons more efficiently than the dps and not even use the 2h. If the tank runs like5 du geons for every one the hunter runs then hes getting less use of the weapon overall. 
---
And hunters just an example. This could apply to a dps paladin or dps warr too.
---
Considering that the few beta access accounts that are beign sold are going for more than 600$ USD right now, 200$ would be a bargain.
---
Dun morogh, loch modan.
---
You could try the GSE but logic or conditional macros are hard to pulloff.
---
Vanilla was better because it was alive.in all senses. socialization is what matters most, the very spirit of vanilla.
---
For real. I'd have given him Int.
---
Someone on ig literally went on a rant on how Classic is only being released for the original players, so all the “children” complaining about the release being the same month school starts needed to stop complaining, because Classic was *made for him! Goddamnit! Only for adults!* Because apparently adults don’t have jobs...
---
**Horde:** Better PVP players. More PVP players. Likely slower BG ques.   
---
**Ally:** Slightly easier PVE. Worse PUGs in PVP. Likely faster BG ques.   
---
P.S. You're the reason why they invented blood elves.
---
!RemindMe 78 days
---
Thousands nah. But a couple hundred more? Yes.
---
pre raid + pvp accessories

if you're interested in warrior pvp you would watch and learn from moo's vids
---
Im speaking about the "combo points" from cata.
---
Wow is a drinking game. A couple beers in, and you can't tell the difference between 30 and 60 fps, but you can still raid fine.
---
Save money on the 144hz monitor and get a bunch of beer (or some old scotches) instead.
---
I can't stand Blood Elves tho...
---
&gt; that shield will probably be vendored before equipping it a second time
---
That's how you end up having a lvl 10 white shield in SM and your DPS having a green 2h. You can't use your ninja 2H an he can't use his ninja shield. So you are squishy because the shield is half your armor value and he does 0 damage because you "need" Corpsemaker.
---
&gt; If there was a rule that warriors tanking a low level dungeon couldn't roll on two-handers then you'd have a hard time finding a tank for those dungeons.
---
There's no rule for anything, just don't be surprised when you are labeled a ninja and your reputation suffers because of it.
---
Yea, betas are really only exciting for brand new games. Because then you can figure out how the game works, and get ahead pretty quick when it’s officially released
---
'class-role viability' sounds tantamount to 'redesign vanilla.' I think that's called TBC.
---
I'd go for 120hz. Almost impossible to see the difference between that and a 144hz.
---
We do not have that info currently.
---
Didn't the devs say in their post about it that spell batching is still in the modern game, but the rate is quicker? Should be working as per usual if that's the case.
---
Nope that announcement will be made closer to August.
---
now we can finally play the game
---
Out of everything you've listed I think Shared Mob Tagging would be the only thing I'd like to see come over.
---
After some practice runs leveling on a busy pserver I can say, mob sharing would be very VERY nice. However I'm pretty sure it would ruin the AH economy in some way shape or form down the line.
---
Being excellent in solo PvP means you can actually kill people sometimes.
---
I think the debuff limit is part of the charm of vanilla. (us disagreeing of this is exactly why it's tough to make these kinds of decisions.) But I could get behind guild banks.
---
My coworkers are all not into WoW at all, thankfully!
---
I like the idea of this, but I wish more people would use it. There's only 12 people signed up on my realm, and unfortunately I recognize none of them or any of the guilds :(
---
what is this Normie /r/wow shit?
---
only undead in my opinion
---
Damn, I've never seen this before.
---
You mustve used a torrent or something. If you delete the torrent it wont be an issue, or if you download a link instead. Or use a vpn
---
Tanking in vanilla is the most challenging raid content. Warriors are the only tank
---
Holy fuck this is one of the most stupid things I have read on this sub and that’s saying something.
---
You'll make new friends on alliance.
---
thanks
---
Mained Warrior in Vanilla and doing it again with Classic. I just love the glory of being a good tank. Plus I want Thunderfury again. ;)
---
That's not accurate at all.
---
Weapon skill is .04% less chance to be parried/dodged per point.  5 weapon skill is .2% not 3%.
---
Yeah the beta is to build hype that's why all the streamers are getting keys. Even those who don't play wow.
---
Does naxx need more than 4 tanks?
---
This might work if gold wasn't so hard to come by in classic, and if raid teams weren't so small and intimate in retail. In fact it feels a bit backward in that regard, but switching them wouldnt really fit either.
---
I believe what you are saying, but out of curiosity, could you provide a source on blizzard stating the 400ms? I had not seen that. Thanks
---
I agree with the first two. It really wouldn't ruin anything besides see Nostalgia snobs immersion into the past.
---
#3 though would be changing the Vanilla experience. While I'd love to see Prot Paladin be able to MT Naxx and AQ 40 with a hard taunt and mana efficiency it would require to much changes to each class.
---
Maybe down the road after everyone's cleared everything to the point of farming for Alts they could try a change like that.
---
On the contrary I am the reason blood elves were invented. Now void elves and nightborne, those are the real enemies
---
I don't trust Activision blizzard to do the OSRS route and not mess up, they don't have the best of track records. With tbc you know exactly what to expect, and it's much better than the last 12 years of retail.
---
Looool
---
I had a guildie who rolled a character without really paying attention at all to the character creation, he just wanted a mage and made one ASAP. 
---
About 30 levels in, he finally looked at his toon’s face, and was shocked at how ugly he was, but he already got that far, so he just stuck with it.
---
I got a computer from Digital Storm about 5 years ago  cuz I didn’t want to do the whole build it myself thing. I think I paid $8-900. Still runnin strong and plays the game with pretty high detail.  They have lots of options as do most other companies that build them for you.
---
I mean, in classic high elves use the night elf model reskinned. Example: https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/4/40/Captain_Thalo%27thas_Brightsun.jpg?version=481bbd229ab2e88c2e82a173af889c54
---
Honestly in this day and age I could see some player organized arena be a thing on some servers.
---
They used to hold 1v1 and 2v2 tournaments on my Vanilla server and organized it through Blizz forums.
---
To be fair he spends so much time there for casting he might as well be living there already.
---
You're sounding like a bit of a sociopath without empathy.
---
LazyMacros can't do anything more than what the regular macro API allows, it just makes it easier to debug and share macros.
---
I don't think that has been confirmed either.  Just people posting they are "sure" it's "totally harder" on pservers.
---
What? Nonexistent? Blizzard has some of the best customer support of a company I've ever seen.
---
I paid 70€ for the demo. I mean I liked it, but why did I do that...
---
The whole point of Beta testing is a diverse crowd of testers. They want veterans and noobs.
---
Better to send them out randomly vs picking and choosing who gets it.
---
why you didnt use ice block?
---
Class fantasy all day. Do I want to run around as a person wearing this or that, how do i want to interact with things, which abilities do i have access to, and what weapons do i want to actually see myself using. If I dont enjoy what I'm doing it doesnt matter how quickly gear or levels come to me. Just like the world, anyone can find a place if you're doing what you enjoy.
---
Someone is terrible with money...
---
Too confusing dick stuck in Abom.
---
Follow up question for you: does the effect proc when a spell is *cast* or when a spell *lands*?
---
The latter is super frustrating on pservers because you typically have half the next spell casted by the time you know you have the clearcast proc.
---
Forsen streamed the blizzcon beta, if he plays classic then his server is 100% forfeit.
---
Hashtag nichanges.
---
On that note, I always felt that falling great distances should also give a move speed debuff.  Sprained ankle for medium falls.  Broken leg for higher falls.  something like -50% move speed for X number of seconds.
---
I’m not asking for beta access
---
I’m saying for those that have had it since Launch
---
If something is off now It's not vanilla that's wrong, it's classic's attempt to recreate vanilla that's flawed.
---
&gt; K. I still don't think it's an issue, but I guess you do? Nothing about MMOs requires what you or I define as a sandbox. 
---
In what sense is there a community comparable to a sandbox in a theme park?  How can you even have a player centric, let alone a player driven game with a theme park?
---
&gt; Why is it a stretch? But for your gathering professions, you will have less money. Money is important—vastly so—for your mounts. They help. And I also didn't say anything about completely replacing all gear with sets. I'm saying that the professions can provide you with steady upgrades as you level them. There's no reason or need for the professions to be *mandatory*, which they would be if they provided BiS full sets regularly while leveling. 
---
You might as well call looting corpses a tradeskill then.  They shouldn't be mandatory (or always be BiS), but they should provide an alternative while leveling, which they do not in vanilla. 
---
&gt;Then don't run instanced dungeons. There are multiple locations in Vanilla WoW that are large and sprawling, full of elites, and able to be cleared by multiple groups (e.g., Jintha'Alor, Stromgarde Keep, or Tyr's Hand), which can provide good money, good drops, and are scattered across multiple level brackets. You want a sandbox? Then make the game a sandbox. 
---
So my choice is "don't do dungeons" because the outdoors exist?  
---
&gt;It is as you make it. I was never bored in dungeons because I enjoyed my groups, I liked the idea of a band of adventurers forging deep into enemy territory, and the loot itself was a nice bonus. 
---
And I like the idea of finding other people also deep in enemy territory, possibly even player-controlled enemies.
---
&gt;Your trash clears would still be boring and repetitive to you if the dungeons weren't instanced; 
---
Less so as more players means they'd die faster.
---
&gt;you'd just have the illustrious boon of getting to a location where a boss was supposed to be, but some other group already killed it and now you have to wait, 
---
It's an MMORPG.  It happens.  So what?  Why should you be spoonfed like a baby?  That's not fun.  Achievement requires difficulty, and clearing trash for hours isn't difficult.
---
&gt;but oh no, there are actually multiple groups there and you either need to fight for a tag or form a queue. You think trash clears are boring? I think fighting and/or waiting for uninstanced bosses is boring. Congrats, we both have opinions.
---
Well, if we had my way, there would be no tagging, so the fight itself would be fun to see if you can out-damage the other team.  
---
&gt; And if the game mechanics should not limit griefing, then congratulations, you've just opened a Pandora's box of sliding scales. Mobs having fast spawn times limits griefing, because that means griefers can't hog all resources in an area. Therefore all mobs should only spawn once every 10 minutes. Sure, it's fine, everyone will agree to not fight over them. But we can't have hand-holding carebear nonsense, so if you really want to get that mob, better be prepared to tag it. Oh, and your own faction members should be able to kill you whenever like in the alpha. Because we shouldn't allow these carebears to take over. Also, when you tag a mob, you can no longer CC people who are attacking you. See, if you could CC people, that would be the game limiting available griefing. The community should simply *accept* that CC is forbidden in fights and that nobody should attack you and that mob spawns should be handled in an orderly fashion. Actually making these things game mechanics would be safe, sanitized, hand-holding, carebear nonsense. 
---
No, see, tagging itself is carebear.  Out damage man, out damage.  Aside from your (I assume) intentionally ridiculous example of not being able to CC while in combat with a mob, I would be totally fine with everything you just said.  That sounds like fun.
---
&gt;Let people enjoy their fucking game, dude. 
---
Ironic, seeing as how you're telling me I can't enjoy the game I want.
---
&gt; Of all your arguments, this is the most absurd one. It's not "carebear" to have a tap looting system. It's simply a different system, susceptible to its own types of griefing, but not to other types of griefing that were prevented by the game coding, just like any other multiplayer game has certain types of accessible griefing and certain types of impossible griefing. 
---
I completely disagree.  With the "out damage = win" system, you can at least fight back.  If someone just tags it first, then you're shit out of luck.  Let's say you're out in the wild and all alone and pulling mobs with a spell with a cast time.  Out of nowhere, while you're casting, someone comes in an insta-casts something on a mob you were fractions of a second from landing something on.  Well, your high damage cast time spell probably gave you a huge advantage over his weak insta cast spell, so now it's a race.  Rather than the passive, pathetic accepting of your fate because apparently, doing 1 point of damage .01 seconds before someone does 1000 damage means that mob is "yours."
---
This is so cool!
---
&gt; I was using Skinning as an example, because in Vanilla WoW a Skinner could not skin a corpse that wasn't looted. 
---
Yeah, I know.
---
&gt; That was the single biggest reason why one would want to enforce a "lootable after X minutes" rule.
---
Absolutely not.  It's so you can loot it.
---
&gt;A person won an item and didn't loot it? That's nice for you. *They won it.*They can do whatever they want to do to it, including leaving it on the corpse, 
---
What you are describing is how literally every MMORPG before WoW worked.  Someone doesn't want something, why shouldn't it just go to some random passer by after a little while?
---
&gt;This is, again, a total opinion argument with no meaningful objective reason why WoW's system is worse than "scavenger" systems (or why scavenger systems are worse than WoW's system, since I'm not arguing that either is better than the other). 
---
You've clearly never played a game with this system.  It's a social activity.  It's not really about the loot.  You make friends.  Think of it this way, you're a level 60 and killing bullshit mobs for a rare drop.  You're like 1-2 shotting these things.  A level 30 comes along that needs them for a quest.  You're telling me you wouldn't team with him and chat a little, just to be nice?  Same concept.
---
&gt;Disagreed. Cool how one can simply say they don't like a thing and that counts as an actual argument, right? Because that's what you're doing. So that's what I'll do. It's a punishment that *should* exist, because I think it should. 
---
No, I gave my reason, you simply refused to address it.  No XP split = more teaming = more social interaction.  Feel free to tell me what your "argument" is, aside from the hysterical doomsday "no one will be able to do anything solo!" response, that has never once played out in any MMORPG that had this system.
---
&gt;Literally insane. You're telling me that if I'm in a high level PvP zone farming, and a group of five people come along and blow me out of the water, they're allowed to take several hundred gold worth of collected Black Lotuses, food, cloth, BoE gear, and everything else that isn't nailed to my person? Play a different game, dude. That's not Warcraft. If you don't like WoW, then don't play it. 
---
Yes, I am telling you that, and no, it's not insane.  I used to play a game just like that.  Using mount prices as a baseline (I know, not perfect), one time a guy looted an item off someone he killed in pvp that would be worth 425,531 gold in WoW.  Literally the most expensive item in the game at the time.  So I am more than comfortable with someone losing a few hundred gold.  See, this is exactly why WoW was in 2004 a carebear game, and completely in line with my criticisms.
---
&gt;Sooooo, micromanagement for the sake of micromanagement. Got it. Well, once again, the system you're describing is in no way objectively better than the system WoW has until you actually provide an argument as to why your suggested method is superior, and it's an argument convincing enough to sway detractors. I'll wait for it. 
---
No, not at all, it's rewarding people who go above and beyond (and they should be rewarded).  If an item requires level 19 to equip, is it a major satisfaction to ding 19 over twinking yourself into it if it's on the bleeding edge of what is possible at level 19?  Please stop denying arguments that are inconvenient for you to address don't exist.
---
&gt;Really, almost all of your arguments have boiled down to, "I don't like this feature because I don't, and other games did it differently, so WoW should have used those systems instead of the systems it did use, which allowed it to utterly destroy every competitor and claim a monopoly on the genre market for a decade. Because I don't like it." 
---
Nope, if you notice, everything I have been saying has consistently revolved around the ideas of social interaction.  If you don't like social interaction, why are you playing MMORPGs and actively working for less social ineraction in them?  Additionally, the most mass appeal, watered down, bland thing in any given market *is not necessarily the best*.  Even if it's the most popular.  Ferrari sells a lot fewer cars every year than Ford does.
---
&gt;It's totally fine if you want to play EVE Online. Other people do, too. But could you see how farcical it would be for a WoW player to go onto an EVE forum and say "Look, here are some legitimate criticisms of EVE. First off, instead of EVE's PvP system, it should have WoW's. Also, instead of EVE's economy, it should have WoW's. Also, instead of EVE's customization, it should have WoW's. Also, instead of EVE's guild system, it should have WoW's. Also, instead of EVE's loot system, it should have WoW's. Why? Because I like WoW better than EVE, and WoW has a bigger market share. Therefore all you EVE players can go fuck yourselves, because EVE should be WoW."  
---
&gt;No. EVE should be EVE. There are players who like EVE and should be able to keep liking EVE. WoW's systems worked for WoW and made it popular among people who liked WoW more than other games. Maybe some players liked both EVE and WoW for their own reasons. But claiming it's a "legitimate criticism" to smply decry a MMO's subsystem as being different than another MMO's subsystem that you liked better, for little reason other than "I like that other one better", is silly. I like Path of Exile. In fact, I *love* Path of Exile. It has a lot of things you're describing. It has an open-ended talent tree with base stat acquisition, gear that has to be carefully stacked to wear it properly at times, infinite customization with skill gems, a true sandbox mode where you're allowed to exploit some gamebreaking interaction and become a literal god, deaths that make you lose XP, extreme micromanagement, and grouping that barely punishes you in any meaningful manner.  
---
&gt;If someone told me that they want WoW to be like PoE, I'd laugh right in their face. I like WoW because it's WoW. I like PoE because it's PoE. The two games are different. Neither is better than the other, and they both have plenty of players. WoW does not need to emulate a gotdanged thing from PoE to be a great game.  
---
&gt;Maybe you should accept that your other MMOs are different for difference's sake, appreciate them for what they were, and appreciate WoW for what it is, instead of trying to foist systems from those other games into one that clearly wasn't designed with such systems in mind and would not lose any quality by avoiding such systems.
---
If you notice, I'm not saying WoW should change, just listing reasons why WoW is not hardcore.  
---
&gt; I've spoken my piece. Good day. 
---
Looks like we got an apex redditor here.  Did you tip your fedora at m'lady too?
---
There’s on named after the chapel where the death knight starter quests end
---
My first 60 was my NE rogue back then. I dinged in the lava zone that is the south entrance to Blackrock mountain (I can never remember if it's searing gorge or burning steppes). I ground out 58-60 in the Orc fortress that just has the circular hallway all the way around it with some elite mob in the middle. There never seemed to be anyone going in there and at the time I considered those orcs to be a decent gold farm as well.
---
I have also experienced the frustration of fighting for mobs in congested areas. One thing that often happens is you get randomly invited when the quest is to kill N of a type of mob. So then I think hey that's pretty cool. I enjoy grouping up, and scarcity of mobs causes me to group up, and that's actually kind of cool.
---
Wait there was a second stress test that I could have been playing? Fuck
---
You're telling me I can't work a register from home? Holy shit, I need to update my resume.
---
If anything I think the Streamers getting access is unfair 
---
Especially if they aren’t hardcore WoW fans
---
It’s a smack in the face to actual fans and just a way for Blizz to build hype instead of giving it to those that have supported WoW since Launch
---
&gt; New to Vanilla servers 
---
Alright, man 😂😂😂
---
It can be named that while still having a mission statement that is not strictly limited to that.
---
The intent isn't "selfish."  It's not comparable to anti-vaxxers, so if you want to make a statement about them, make it somewhere that isn't so pointless to the current discussion that it sounds stupid.
---
Yeah, theoretically other people can get infected, which isn't good, but that doesn't mean the act is selfish.  And if the entire office is being infected and everything stops, I'd wonder how shitty the ventilation, health plans, etc. are in said office, and how badly people want to not do any work.  We get people who come in with colds and stuff, it's not ideal, but never has the entire office been infected, much less to the point nothing gets done, because that's damn near an impossible scenario.  You'd need someone who has a major illness who's still coming in to work, and if they're fighting through that to be at work, there's more issues to worry about than rushing to declare that person "selfish."
---
Vanilla had a massive shortage of tanks that understood not to ninja every piece they needed and roll on the role you entered the instance with. Every LF1M Tank &lt;insert dungeon here&gt; had a few whispers from ninja tanks people didn't want to invite in their parties.
---
I've been rocking [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/yKNI5Kd.png) my brother took a while back.
---
Oh well, sorry.
---
I remember a time when gamers didn’t think beta is an inalienable human right. They didn’t obsess endlessly on it, they didn’t rant on how the writer of a gaming website that only reviews strategy games got to play to write a preview while the “real fans” didn’t get in, and if they didn’t get in they just waited until they got invited or it released. And those that did get in didn’t play 10 minutes then start ranting how broken the game is to everyone instead of reporting bugs. I miss those days. It even seems that now when a game is announced they care more about the beta than they do release.
---
My biggest disappointment was not being able to play a high elf priest. There’s one in the gameplay trailer.
---
A little bit but he has a point.
---
I think it would have been better to tune everything for no debuff limit and let players use all the spells given to them. It wasn't a balance decision made during Vanilla, it was a limitation of their programming.
---
Yep TF is god tier for tanks because of the proc right
---
Sorry, my bad. I keep thinking of it on my friend's warrior (with the talented +15%) since up til recently I was still set on Troll for nostalgia + easier raptor purposes.
---
If you have hypothyroidism you're on medication for it. What % of fat ppl walk around with untreated hypothyroidism? Far far less than 1%.
---
I don’t actually remember dinging sixty the first time. I do remember getting timbermaw exaulted before 60 on my priest though. I don’t know why I wanted it but I did.
---
I had a Tauren Druid, in the Troll village (outside the Orc/Troll starting area) there is a witch doctor who can give you random buffs, one of them makes you bigger. If you log out, you can get two stacks of that growth buff.
---
Combine that with any other items that make you grow (Elixar of Giant Growth comes to mind), mount a Kodo and then ride into Org. 
---
My Tauren was literally the size of the bank. The only downside is, the growth buffs only last for 5 minutes, and you have to run the whole way back.
---
When I got my old account back all I had to do was send them a scan of my father's ID (the old account was in his name because I was 7) and they have me it back instantly, shame my character was naked and a lot of my cool shit was missing so I'll never get some of it back...but I did get my baby bear so that was cool.
---
You've actually seen them? Can you tell them to remove my authenticator?
---
This is the dumbest fucking thing you've said, and you claimed to be rich and successful.  No, it's despite all that.  This totally stems from people who outright rejected everything WoW became with expansions.  You also said, quite literally, more money = better than, so by that logic, since TBC and wrath made more money than classic, we should get those instead.  What the fuck does story have to do when you can just get that COLD HARD CA$H?
---
Is this the one that people claim had a demon Hunter on it just be sure that night elf is using a glaive?
---
They also might dig through your post history to find anything they can latch on to to claim you aren’t a real fan of the game or genre. I’ve seen that happen.
---
Do you want to play vanilla? That's how it worked. 
---
I mean you can get a timer for your CC to estimate when it's going to break if you want but it's your job to manage the CC in vanilla. It's just how the game works.
---
No. Death knights were considered though.
---

---
Thank you, but i am playing in an oceania server, and i think m gonna join the oceania server in classic too... :(
---
Not quite, but I understand the concerns. I agree that it’s a slippery slope but I think that balanced class viability is a huge benefit to immersion and rpg. I’m not gonna pretend that I know the solutions, but the idea is right.
---
No doubt, I've done that plenty of times myself. Still funny as hell when we mentioned he could've just "studied" with us instead and not had to deal with support teemo in pugs.
---
Oh? How so
---
As a guy who played Classic during college, I don't have time to invest in WoW like I did back then. Farming all the materials to make potions, elixirs and flasks. Farming Molten Core to make gear to face Rag. No thank you. It was fun when I was younger and had the time, but not now. Kids, wife, work and life take up too much time to give Classic the time it deserves. PvPing on schedule with the other PvPers to help people reach ranks each week. Having matches of Alterac Valley that would last over the whole weekend. It was awesome at the time, but it was a full time investment.
---
Props to people who get to experience this for the first time, and for those who want to go back and relive those moments. I'm just not that guy anymore. I'm excited for those people and think they deserve to see how the game has changed from its infancy to now, or live those old days.
---
I enjoyed having the Unstoppable Force (so many gnomes were sacrificed against pallies with the immovable object) in PVP with mace spec stun against the Alliance with my old berserker troll trait that only triggered below 20% health. It was awesome.
---
Have fun to those who can bask in the glory of a game that required more time than the game does now. Enjoy it, and savor the moments, but remember to get outside and live your lives too.
---
The thing i like most is it just isn't refined or laid out as perfectly as new games or modern wow expansions. The gear progression is so predictable in retail now, tier gear, normalized weapons, weekly cashes, as you mentioned like 6 buffs, shared cooldowns, so many battle resses per people. mobs scaling.   
---
I like that there is like 20 different consumables you could bring to a raid, that have you to think about your gear more, for hitcap etc. enchants for almost every slot and you can can be OP as fuck with gear and not normalized in PVP/PVE.
---
FYI you don’t need your old account. Make a new one. Your characters are tied to BFA, not Classic.
---
You may already know this. Sorry if you do
---
Okay, fair enough. I'd agree with you if I didn't go the home page and see this exact quote.
---
&gt;VANILLAFRIENDS.COM offers you a convenient way to track and contact your old **Vanilla World of Warcraft** Friends.
---
The level scaling in retail is pretty cool imo. I'm able to go anywhere and it be relevant for questing.
---
Okay so you are retarded. Read the shit you're replying to. I said my stance is that it's a waste of life "regardless of whether it's necessary or not". Do i have to spell it out any clearer?? wtf is going through your brain? You keep posting these dumbass "well maybe he has \_\_\_\_\_\_ financial obligation". Okay? cool? I don't give a shit. How can you not see that what you're typing has absolutely nothing to do with my point? How much more do you want me to spell out before it goes through your head? Your mom must be working 70+ a week to keep up with your shit.
---
Since uploading your ID times you out everytime try maybe getting someone to help you through email. I mean sending your id photo through there rather than the website since it times you out. I couldn't tell you exactly what or how to get that done, but I had a friend who had to do this back in cata. Just sent his photo Id to the email that blizz support sent him and voila he was back on in a day.
---
"Nice Hat"
---
Yuck.  A good boss needs to recognize that there's differences in when a person is capable of working remotely or not.  I.e. for me, if I've got a cold and don't want to possibly spread it, I can still work remotely, not a huge deal.  If I've got pneumonia, then no, I can't.  Heck, if I'm vomiting and unable to get far from bed, regardless of the cause, I can't.
---
I try not to take my boss for granted, because he's good about understanding that difference, and telling us to not work if we're not able to.  I'd like to think that's not a rarity, but, well... I'll thank him doubly the next time he's understanding about me being unable to get anything done.
---
It's a bad idea to try to get people to work when they aren't able, anyway.  You run a risk of them getting worse and being incapable of working for a longer period.  So even just on a cold only-business standpoint, it's not a good idea.  Someone at full health can usually catch up if things get behind, but someone in poor health trying to force themselves too much will likely just cause more of a backlog.  Just makes sense to not push people if they're sick.
---
It's not like there's a limited supply that you can snatch away from players who genuinely want it. It's an infinite vendor item.
---
It's like every investment fad in real life - yeah, you might buy some trading cards because you know they're being discontinued, but if everyone has bought 100 because they had the same genius idea, the supply will be too large to make them truly valuable even after being discontinued.
---
Much like pservers, there'll be so many white raptors that it stops being "cool" to have one.

This sounds like an extremely detailed and well thought out idea.

I mean, you're free to make your own.

As someone with IBS, you would be a bad manager for me to have.
---
&gt;How can I make this thread about me?
---
It's not that I feel like I should get special treatment because I've been playing since 05. It's more like that people who started from Cata on should be treated poorly.
---
Well! Interesting topic. He does ask the player to steal some document detailing his life as a human from Quel'lithien Lodge. He tells the player not to read it, but I'm a snoop, so I did :) There's a letter there from Sylvanas to Kael'thas, singing his praise about how great an archer he was. Why would Nathanos want that piece of paper, if it wasn't for the sentimental value? 
---
I think the romance was implied much earlier on, though it was far more subtle then.
---
They don't have a cs email address
---
Tell me that as you see a ramdom guy (streamer) followed by 25 spergs while questing in the barrens.
---
Why do people even want the beta so badly? It's baffling. It's got a handful of differences from private realms, but it's otherwise the same core experience. And you don't need to drop $15 a month for it.
---
I want it incase they ever unfuck retail
---
STVietnam flashbacks
---
I like seeing ideas like this, not because I want to see them now in classic, but because I think classic has to go somewhere or progress somehow after some time (say 3 years or something). 
---
I like the idea of alternate timeline progressions that other people have posted and adding things similar to these would be more welcome changes that would change gameplay without taking away the general world feel. I’d much rather have things like this implemented than progress through BC and WoTLK as they were in the past. Thanks for sharing these

This happened to me in TBC. This is legit.

What scares me the most is how the classic community has gone from #nochanges to "please change a lot of things for my convenience" as it grew larger the last few months. People not just advocating for layering as a lesser evil, but something they'll entirely stand behind is a worrisome trend. Just imagine where that mindset would take us if they actually ended up trying to go the OSRS path after naxx, the possibility of the wow community begging for changes that ruin the game all over again is suddenly becoming a real threat. I do not want retail 2.

Hi, /u/pallihikihyi
---
Whats SW, NF, DMF, Traces and FoR stand for?
---
What is Dual Spec?
---
I haven’t watched it.
---
 **hilarious**
---
I am waiting for the "MORDOTS" one.
---
extremely amusing?
---
From what I understand, there's only one boss that can only be tanked by a specific class, with a specific class set bonus, and that's Naxx's Horsemen boss, only tankable by prof warriors. Apart from that, I'm pretty sure feral druids were viable tanks
---
I believe south is burning steppes, as below that is RR.
---
A. Is it at least viable for PvP/casual PvE?
---
B. Is it fun?
---
All that matters for me personally
---
This guys scares me
---
That is false.
---
Depends on your ping. You really need a sub-100 ping for blink to be reliable.
---
That's reassuring
---
You do realize doing 450 dps single target while equipped with decent phase 1 gear isn't bad right? From the theory crafting being done for phase 1 stuff people will be averaging 400-600 dps.
---
I watched it well after quitting WoW, streamed it after it hit video, and didn't think it was bad (which is what I was expecting).  My wife didn't hate it either... I thought it was entertaining enough.
---
How so?
---
Too many cooks
---
I recall the director talking about everyone wanting a hand in the movie, tearing parts out or adding them because they didn't think a general audience would understand it.
---
IMO, the reason it failed is they tried to do too much. The story they wanted to tell is at least a trilogies worth of content (one human side, one orc side, one finale). There are a ton of story threads related to the opening of the dark portal, it's probably the biggest and most interconnected event in the history of Warcraft.
---
They should have done a simpler story so they could spend more time building characters. Instead we got introductions to a million characters and the biggest event in Azeroth's history crammed into a hour and a half.
---
Plays a MMORPG with 1/20th the player base as WoW
---
 "WoW is such a joke"
---
My grandmother, aunt, school teachers all at least heard of World of Warcraft back in the day. You just sound like a troll at this point.
---
The movie made bank in China. Most grossing video game movie ever made.
---
The only good Feral tanks are the hardcore ones. It takes that level of play to make them worth taking.
---
1) IF is arguably the best talent point that a Priest can spec, regardless of build.
---
1.1) PWS cannot crit. You can pair IF with any spell really, which may change based on your situation, if you're playing offensively or defensively. As an Spriest you'll often pair it with Mind Blast.
---
2) 3/5 is good enough for PvP
---
3) Imp VE rank 2 is a flat 10% boost, bringing the healing returned from the debuff to 30% of all dmg dealt.
---
You want 2/2 healing focus from Holy. That's your last stand when you need to drop form to flash heal yourself,  unless you plan to never drop shadowform and just accept death. Your first spec with the 2 points from Imp mana burn into Holy Focus is basically cookie cutter spriest.
---
Kind of.  
---
You can successfully tank most of MC/BWL. You can tank 20-mans pretty successfully. Don't think you can do Ragnaros -- and since you can't stance-dance, you'd certainly want to play alliance for fear ward.  
---
But there are more-and-more bosses you can't tank as you move into AQ40 and forward.
---
What makes 2h stronger on horde side?

This is brilliant

Well, you *could* equip the main hand one if you really wanted.

I'm having a hard time understanding why you're so adamant on this. It's always been normal to expect that tanks (and healers) in leveling dungeons will prioritize the gear that helps them level. Not once have I or any of the people I've leveled with been labeled ninjas for needing on what we need. I can't see any reason you'd be upset about this aside from you being a salty entitled retadin, but that's so much of a caricature I didn't really think that was the case.
---
Regardless, I'll be leveling a warrior, as I have half a dozen times before. I'll be tanking for dungeon groups that need it, and I'll be needing on Smite's Mighty Hammer, Corpsemaker, Ravager, and X'caliboar, as I have half a dozen times before. Then, when i hit 60, I'll be happily enjoying friends and a raid spot, as I have half a dozen times before.
---
Id imagine they do but they don't have it out and about but I'm sure if you explain your issues you'll get an email. Your gonna have to ticket or go to the forums explain your situation. Personally I don't know how every single thing you try times you out, but having a freak accident like this will get you in contact with someone who can definitely fix your issues.
---
Yet APES has almost full gnome warriors. Salad Bakers has each race represented. Dreamstate had 4 Tauren.
---
&gt; they’d be the ones Classic was aimed at anyway
---
Not at all. Blizzard wouldn't make any effort to convince players that have been subscribed for 15 years and are still content with the poor state of the game. 
---
Classic is aimed at the player base that jumped ship because the direction of the game went to shit. Blizzard does not work for free, if they commited to releasing Classic after all this time it's because they aim to get back a good amount of the subscribers lost over the years.
---
Pacing was really bad, I enjoyed seeing certain characters and certain locations (especially the dark portal) but I feel like one or two more rewrites of the script could have made it so much better.
---
Is there anything a druid can do that a warrior can't? Or will it always be second to warrior
---
It's stickied on Wednesdays. "What to Play Wednesdays." Check back then.
---
As i said however they choose OR randomize.
---
Most beta selections look for config but also have an element of randomization.  I don't presume to know this specific selection process.
---
Fair point. I respect your explanation.
---
Plenty of traitors to kill of every race.
---
Dude food is highly addictive and you literally require it to live.
---
My 45 rogue was dead in SVT when I resubbed in March. LOL. Sigh...
---
1. Nah. You have to go too deep into Discipline.
---
2. Those are both fine, and no, PW:S can't crit. If you're Undead, you can also use IF for a free Devouring Plague, which is imo its best use.
---
3. Not necessary. Equal-level targets only have 3% by default iirc. 3/5 Shadow Focus is more than good enough.
---
4. I don't fully recall from Vanilla, but I'm pretty sure it was a flat 10% addition, for 30% total. It's very good in PvP.
---
I prefer your second one. But if I might make a suggestion, this is the spec I'll be using: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bx0GoZbZVMGtctRt
---
The two points into Healing Focus really helps in the emergency situation where you need to drop Shadowform and have something like a Hunter Pet on you, or you're trying to spot heal team members. Improved PW:F isn't as useful imo. But one can chalk this up to personal preference. They each have their own fringe scenarios where one is better than the other. At any length, committing so many points to Discipline for Imp MB and Imp IF is a waste imo.
---
Thanks for the answer.

Skarm Tank
---
He clears Naxx on Prot Warriors and Feral Druids. He has a lot to say and teach regarding both.
---
Feral Druids if played well and geared well can do 90% of all content as a Tank. Now, just find a guild of 39 people that agree with that.
---
You'd get dunked tanking Twin emps, you'd get feared on Nefarian, you'd struggle to get the fire resistance for Rag, etc.
---
I'll DM you my battle net on Monday.  I'm out of town this weekend.
---
Darkshore sucks. Unpopular opinion but questing in the northern part and then having to travel way down to the southern part sucks. And the quests are all over the place there.
---
Westfall at least has a central main hub in a somewhat square area.
---
I played since beta in 2004. I don't expect or necessarily want a beta. I am mainly just deciding on my class and reading up on guides.
---
I mean... the one I want to play? I do weigh pros and cons, like I like ranged classes the most, so Warlock/Hunter are out since I don't want to manage ammo/shards. Druid/Shaman are out because I don't want to farm gold to change specs all the time since you only get to go heals for raiding. That basically leaves me with Mage. While the food dispenser shit and 1 button rotation do suck, I have loved Mage in almost every expansion, and not having to worry about buying food is a nice way to start my first 60 climb. Teleporting around is also very, very helpful.
---
The issue is I can't submit a ticket because of this, guess I could try the forums.
---
That sounds right
---
In terms of playstyle, yes, absolutely it is a joke.
---
Congrats on people who don't even play video games knowing this game as a cultural reference.  Totally relevant.
---
Can't wait for more updates :P
---
Gotta love the months of "we need this community back to enjoy exploring the world with friends" and now that the game is almost here it's turned to "fuck casuals and people I see in real life I got avoid them so I can have a 15 minute fight vs a mod 3 levels higher than me and tell this other people I've never met irl about it in my guild"
---
200 for a couple months of entertainment isn’t bad.  I’ve spent more than that in one night multiple times.
---
Unfortunately it will always be second to a Warrior. Even when AoE tanking. It is easier to AoE tank on a Druid but once you factor skill into it a good Warrior will outshine a Druid of the same skill level.
---
However, if you want to Tank and be adored as a Druid then just go PvP and Flag Carry in WSG and defend points in AB. You will be loved by many.
---
You choose two specs and can swap between them anytime you're out of combat (except in BGs and Arena). Your action bars swap too.
---
It used to cost 1000g and require level 40, now it costs 10g and requires level 30.
---
You're free to tell me how in 2004 WoW wasn't a hand-holdy game compared to other MMORPGs if that's apparently just my opinion.
---
Amen
---
And that effects you how? You’re not entitled to some perfect gameplay, other players exist and you can’t dictate how they play.
---
Building hype is good for the fans.  The more popular classic is the more support and effort blizzard will put into it.
---
Cancer.

Ill guess mage.

Wait blood elf’s can be warrior now? When did that change?

---
What makes you say mage.
---
Why RIP?
---
I've seen this suggested before as well.  
---
As alliance at least you can do vagash in dun morough at level 8-11 range for a green 2h, and there is a somewhat simple quest for mor'ladim in duskwood around 28-30.  Both of those weapons are vastly superior to the grays you are describing.  They are also both not soloable elite quests, but if you are leveling soon after launch there shouldn't be much of a wait to find groups for the quests.
---
It has been fun watching these streamers and how the community forms a meta given the conditions.
---
“Best in slot” for level 30 is hilarious.
---
Yep, /u/SlumGlock didn't care *sooooo* much that they made this post. :P
---
All it does is reduce the time needed to farm for gold so that you can swap between PVP and PVE specs or between hybrid specs and not require you to redo your UI every time. Not exactly cancer.
---
Err i thought warriors could always be every race.
---
It did very well internationally but fell short in a lot of aspects.
---
Mainly pacing and exposition for people unfamiliar with Warcraft.
---
I enjoyed the movie. It wasn't an amazing "Film" but it was a fun "Movie" if that makes sense.
---
Much like Pacific Rim.
---
Staves count as a weapon for warriors so you can heroic strike with it.
---
The reason he said it is that Warrior [T3](https://classicdb.ch/?search=Dreadnaught) 4piece bonus is +5% chance for taunt to hit combined with [Nat's Reel](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19947) takes your taunt to the minimum chance for taunt to miss. Druid can get it to 2% chance to miss with just three items one being the reel the other two being a [weapon](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19884) the other a [belt](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19388) both being available before Naxx meaning in progression raiding Druid will be better suited to the task than your warriors.
---
I think we had a discussion a few weeks ago in another SPriest thread. I recall the username, anyway.
---
So to my point: You're really of the opinion that 3/3 into Imp. IF is worth going 15 points into Discipline? I've always found it to be a marginal boon for Shadow, since it already has very good physical reduction. I find the 5 points lost and thus unable to into 5/5 Imp MB and Imp VE isn't remotely worth 3 points of useless mana regen while casting and 3 more into extra armor. My view is that the increased healing and damage output provides more mitigation than would a bit of extra armor. Has someone run calcs on this that I'm unaware of?
---
Has 2 points left.
---
Titanic leggins are a 1.10 add, so anyone leveling on launch can hold off on farming for those.
---
Why isn't TipsOut with? I'm pretty sure he's one of the best duelers in North America.
---
I don't know enough of these players to fill it out, but from what  I've seen I don't think Sodapoppin will win against the druid that beats Guzu.
---
My boss actually plays and asked for my battle.net... and i dont know what to do
---
Because they don't have any reason to reward non-payers with beta invitations.  There will be an open beta anyway, so anyone who wants to join the stress testing can do so.
---
Esfand sent me my beta key, if you're lucky enough to win a giveaway you can get one too.
---
I got a beta invite, guess they want too see how it runs on my PC. I logged in, set settings to max - ran around in SW. Was satisfied with my 60+ FPS - goodbye beta.
---
I’ll be back on release to level 4 alts at the same time.
---
Tell me that as some random streamer gets scarab lord because he has the same army of spergs I mentionned farming for him and you and your guild can't compete.
---
There's no way soda get past a lock. Milksteak is one of the best shamans on pservers, and they counter mage a lot at that level, hes gonna shit on Venruki. Payo is a good rogue, he will most likely get to quarter finals. Guzu is also very geared and a decent player, hes gonna get to quarter finals+ 100%.
---
Well apparently you need a level 10 character to post on the forums, so I would have to level a character on a alt account just to attempt to get in touch with cs.
---
I’d rather watch idiots like Quin discover what WoW was like when it was good.
---
It’ll be 03:00 on Monday AEST. It’s already 14:00 Sunday afternoon here in Australia

You can also shift one more point of Shadow Weakness and two on Imp Fort into Spirit Tap (and more away from Shadow Weakness based on the +hit on your gear). Spirit Tap points help with sustain in world PvP (so you aren't caught with your mana pool empty when fighting mobs) and sometimes in sustained group fights. Marginal, but not entirely useless.
---
How are you going to talk about doing PVP and not mention stoneform. Dwarf is better in PVE because of fear ward and in pvp because stoneform.
---
Thanks for the link!
---
I never did. The furthest I got was 57. I’m grateful for the opportunity to avenge my past self’s failure.
---
What kind of gear is being used? (As naxx level, I'd expect paladin/warrior to be more dangerous than anything listed here.)
---
If I was told upon joining a group that I'm not allowed to roll on gear that will help me level then I'd just go questing instead.
---
This. You can experience almost everything as a casual. 
---
Also, are you me?
---
While leveling all the stuff I gather I just vendor.
---
I'd rather reach 60 faat with as much gold in my pocket as I can get myself started on the AH, Mount investment in crafting etc etc.
---
I know some people will say "Why not AH all the Leather/Ore/Herb"
---
Well, there's deposits and auction house cuts for all that, plus it takes time to put them up and at the start of a fresh server the economy will be volatile and oversaturated.
---
I'd rather take the direct cash in pocket towards my LvL 40 and 60 mount.
---
Skill ceiling and the complexity of the class is a big factor for me
---
im lazy to edit all that lmao
---
Only gear available in the Beta. So everyone is level 30.
---
Still have the old box with cd key or serial numbers? They can use that to retrieve your account. At least they used to.
---
I’m in! I’ve posted a few times with the same intent but I mostly get told to post elsewhere. Haha. We need a discord channel to start organizing/grouping people.
---
Shut up Newman!

Then I would say they’ve worked hard to build up a fan base and that’s a perk they have. I genuinely don’t care if Asmongold gets scarab, honestly I hope he gets Windfury and scarab mount.
---
Good post thanks for the content my dude. Prepared to get shit stormed by retards lmao
---
Can I still download the game even though it’s not out yet
---
You won't be able to move your professions past (75). Not unless you level-up your bank alt.
---
Even if I did, I can't even submit a ticket without being able to upload a photo id.
---
Tailoring and Enchanting for bank alt is good. When leveling though I vendor as much as I can the mount is expensive. Depends how fast you level. If your slow you could play the auction house if your a fast leveler sell everything then go back and start farming things that will sell for raids.
---
This meme is metal
---
My rare xmogs beg to differ
---
Only cos so many idiots don't value their money.
---
I've got kids to tend to here and there.  Shadowmeld is going to be very useful for me when I need to step away.  There will be plenty of dwarves in the raid for fearward.
---
Because Blizzard didn't care if their movie was successful -- it's such an insignificant part of their revenue. What matters more is potentially harming their brand. So they probably had a thousand people micro-managing Duncan Jones. "Too many cooks", as another poster said.
---
A paladin can tank mid-level dungeons just as well as a warrior - maybe even better, and hunter is widely known to have the easiest time solo leveling, so if they need to go do a quest, they can go do a quest.
---
I think the two other people who didn't immediately react with invective and incoherent rage didn't get (much) shit.
---
Tbh for WoD my pretty zone is Shadowmoon Valley.
---
Holy shit that zone looks AMAZING.
---
This time around I'm gonna go slow - no rushing to 60 for end game. Classic isn't going anywhere and it looks like there's gonna be a great player base. I want to immerse myself in the lore and environment.
---
&gt; If anything I think the Streamers getting access is unfair 
---
&gt;Especially if they aren’t hardcore WoW fans
---
Life isn't fair, and at the end of the day it doesn't matter if streamer is a hardcore WoW fan or not, Blizzard will get more from giving streamers access and exposing the game to thousands of eyeballs who otherwise might never have seen the game, rather than giving you a key so that you can play the game before release in some capacity. 
---
There is no benefit to giving little Billy beta access over someone with an audience and following. It's common sense, at the end of the day every single person bitching and whining about streamers here and on the official forums will be playing the game on launch day. Get over it.
---
Not sure if you know how long dueling tournaments take. This isnt going to be over quick, it's going to take 4+ hours.
---
Can't just allow everyone in Horde that is level 30. Plus, it's an event, and most these guys are the top on the beta server anyways.
---
From what I understood from watching Skarm videos, AOE tanning is harder on a druid because they only really have
---
The only things I personally would like to see would be an optional graphical update a la Starcraft/Warcraft III remasters, and some UI improvements by way of making all the elements have moveable anchors allowing us to move and scale them without the need for an external addon.
---
Damn shame
---
From a tanking perspective, no. Warriors have defensive stance and shieldwall. (But you have battle-rezz and innervate, that does count for something.)
---
not like u gonna play any other horde race druid in classic lmao
---
&gt; You need to understand that nobody wants spend 2 hours running a dungeon that they don't have a chance of getting anything out of.
---
Exactly, if you're a tank and you get all tank gear and all dps gear what's the dps getting?
---
All other races have normal hitboxes, even Gnomes.
---
What a reasonable reaction to something that doesn't affect you.
---
Dual spec would just be way better for those who want a PvP/pve spec
---
For me it would be nice to practice my leveling
---
Absolutely. I’ve been FEASTING on classic wow content from streams to class guides to profession videos. The beta content has been awesome to watch and see how the community adapts to a level 30 cap. Super cool.
---
Resto druid is the best. Can’t die and can rot.  Watch the tourney tomorrow guaranteed Druid winner
---
Exactly
---
Source?
---
So beautiful, so classic. Can't wait to play a hunter again
---
Hard to say for sure but I do believe so it sounds right
---
Is it Rogue? If yes, I'll play it. If no, then I won't. Been playing Rogue every since I started.
---
As for how I originally picked Rogue, it was solely based on what the best class was for ganking people.
---
You do understand that streamers that don't play WoW getting beta access are for advertising purposes right? They're streaming to an audience that doesn't play WoW. This will more than likely bring new people who wouldn't have otherwise played WoW Classic. So unless you can advertise the game to a similar audience its completely fair.
---
Look at the ego of one of the most powerful men in the world: Donald Trump.

His ego is incredibly flimsy and gets hurt by the most basic nonsense.

IF rank 3 gives  20 charges of 1395 (27900)  
---
Improved IF: +30% = 1813 (36260)
---
Its 6 more charges, ignoring dimishing return of armor
---
It's fun to talk about what we all would and wouldn't like to see. I want to see an optional graphical update. Other people don't.
---
That's the beauty of #nochanges, it's a simple solution to all these different ideas and wants and desires.
---
Don't have a source, but this guy is correct. All other races have 'normal' hitboxes.
---
Why make it harder by bringing underperforming classes?
---
The content isn’t harder because of blizzard.
---
You choose to make it harder by bringing underperforming classes .
---
Content isnt easy nor is it super hard. Its challenging later on. The reaso people dont bring memespecs is because they make the whole thing longer, youre feeding gear into someone useless when it could go to a useful class, and a lot of people dont like trying hard when someone else gets a free ride
---
I am literally in the exact, same , situation.  To a T.  I'm rolling horde because MMOs are only fun with others.  I'm sure there will be some great surprises along the way going through Horde zones.
---
&gt; Also serious (srs) vanilla raiders: "We can't take a single enhancement shaman, moonkin~~/feral druid~~, or ret pally because ~~content is too hard.~~ they bring nothing of value"
---
I’m gonna say no. I haven’t seen anyone do anything like that in retail in years... then again I don’t be like I once did and there are far more bg’s to pull from in a random queue so WSG doesn’t pop as often.

The melee weapons are as good as about anything you can pick up in raids outside of legendaries and probably Naxx weapons.

Hit level 35 and I could have an alt with level 300 in a profession tho. Might be useful, but idk
---
Lel
---
I always thought it was strange that people seem to think of betas like early accesses. It's not like they're refusing to invite you to an exclusive, private game...it's coming out in August.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room
---
Not sure if your asking how to get the actual assets or not, but this lets you look at the models
---
1) I guarantee you the spergs you'll see following streamers ig are not their fans. They are just sad people looking for a little bit of screen time on the internet. Even the streamers hate them and you can often hear them say they would rather not be followed by an army 24/7. 
---
2) Scarab lord quest chain in vanilla was fun because it created a little competition between people and their guilds. The competition was fair for the most part. No one had a absurdly big following like you see nowadays with streamers. It was anyones game. The most hardcore guild would be more likely to get it ofc (because they usually farmed more, not because they had bigger numbers, they were simply more deserving). 
---
If someone literally has hundreds or even thousands of people helping them opposed to a couple dozens (your average Joe's guild buddies), it blows all competition out of the water, and the game is no longer fun.
---
When is the tournament?
---
Cataclysm
---
Yep. Tryhard PVPers that shit on players that roll on PVE/RP servers.
---
&gt;2) 3/5 is good enough for PvP 
---
and if the opponent has shadow resistance?
---
Yeti's in the winterspring caves from 57 -60.
---
It wasn't "hand-holdy" in the same way Mortal Kombat isn't "hand-holdy".
---
It had a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling. That's it. 
---
It was more forgiving to less hardcore players in the sense that they could pick it up and level to 60 and so some 5-10 man's with strangers, much like how my 7 year old nephew can pick up Mortal Kombat and throw out a few combos by mashing buttons and feel good about it.
---
However, to complete Naxx, to farm AQ 40, to get certain items and ranks, all required you to be just as hardcore as any of the games you played in 2004 and prior. Much like how if my nephew wanted to juggle me into a flawless victory he would have to put in the time and work raising his knowledge &amp; skill ceiling.
---
EQ, Ultima Online, DAoC, Anarchy, Lineage II etc etc they all had their faults, some would argue they were more hardcore than WoW and they could make some good points but what did they sacrifice to be more hardcore, how did it effect the game as a whole and why is it that 15+ years later they're in our memories and this games still going strong with an upcoming revival?
---
If I introduced a hardcore fighting game to my nephew that could only be enjoyed after weeks of practice and studying move sets, what would be the point? I'd rather a game that's easy to pick up, but difficult to master. That's how you make a popular game. Let everyone and their grandma be able to pick up and play, but only those who truly work for it reach the top 1% of content (Naxx)
---
Most betas are not paid for, but in any case, that's not what he was suggesting. He suggested they could send out invites, but still request that you pay to subscribe. Currently, you're gambling with your money to get into the beta.
---
&gt; There will be an open beta anyway
---
Will there be? I haven't heard anything about that.
---
&gt;If the tank runs like5 du geons for every one the hunter runs
---
That's not how it works. Nobody is going to tank a dungeon five times over. They'll go in once, do their quests, soak up loot along the way, and move on. The hunters will do the same thing.
---
&gt;This could apply to a dps paladin or dps warr too.
---
Knowledge tip for you: If you see a paladin or warrior in a dungeon, they *are* dps. The guy throwing out heals isn't leveling holy, and the soaking hits isn't leveling prot. Telling them that they can't roll on leveling gear is a sure way to get them to leave the group, and now you don't get *any* loot because you don't have a tank or healer.
---
There seems to be this misconception that "this would be neat" somehow equates to "I can't play without this". That isn't the case. For instance I would love an optional graphical update, but I will happily play without it. Not liking the vanilla graphics all that much (I didn't like them in 2005, either) doesn't mean I'm not "cut out for the game" or would be better off playing fortnite or bfa. I've never even tried either of them, zero interest.
---
Most people throwing around these silly ideas will happily play classic without it. It's just fun for some of us to discuss. I hope Blizz doesn't take it too seriously, we've seen what happens when they do. But most of this is just for funsies, nobody actually expects it to happen.
---
There are far more pretty zones in vanilla than just those... For the expansions you're spot on though.
---
Respeccing itself is cancer.
---
&gt;what's the dps getting?
---
a fair chance at rolling on the dps gear
---
Not quite. There’s actually a program you can view all the game models with but the current version is particularly set on the current wow models. I’m wondering if I can install the classic ones or get an older version of that program to view them.
---
at my job we have an unspoken rule that its ok to play video games if you called out. you're probably not doing anything else anyway, and it's food service so if you're just hella sniffly but otherwise fine and need to call out for then that's cool too.
---
The answer partially depends on player gear levels.   
---
Rogues get eaten by mages and warriors, but otherwise are pretty dominant.   
---
Warlocks struggle a bit against shadow priests, and can't win vs. a rogue with a shadow reflector, but otherwise are also pretty dominant.
---
Yes and you would have a really good bank alt. What I plan on doing.
---
Sounds like bullshit. Which isp is that? Which country?
---
When they first released they were the only race to not have the warrior class. Guess in Cata it changed.
---
I played through Cata. Guess I just don’t remember it.
---
him and sylvanas always had a thing going on, its just they never interacted with each other until later, so you only knew from reading a letter during his quests and learning his backstory. they had a thing even before they were forsaken.
---
It would have been the Tiny Emerald Whelping 
---
Here's what they look like - I like to collect them on every character :)
---
http://prntscr.com/nwhzxi
---
For projectile spells, it's proccing on land. For arcane missiles, there is a short delay between when you cast and when the missiles start, and it's proccing right then, as the first missiles launch. So after cast but before land, if that makes sense
---
I feel like it was average tbh. The movie had it's moments don't get me wrong, but for every scene that blew me away, there seemed to be another scene that felt... Off.
---
I also feel that Travis wasn't a good pick for Lothar. He's a fantastic actor and I loved him in Vikings, but I felt he was doing just that; he was playing Ragnar, not Lothar.
---
The Orcs were fantastic though. Gul'dan throwing down in a Mak'gora was an incredible scene. Garona was... Less so.
---
I feel like the movie was hyped up to unobtainable levels. I wanted it to be great, I really did, but it did not live up to the trailers one bit.
---
10AM PST. So about 12.5 hours from now. [Here are the rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p41ODFQ_aATUJDxN4Gp8Iq4U0cqWohIhGd5QlKl-wBM/edit).
---
One of my favorite things is that armor actually feels like it matters. TBC was a great expansion and did some things better than vanilla but it also introduced some things detrimental to the game as well. I still think the entire experience of vanilla was better though.
---
I think attempts to make all specs viable without homogenizing everything peaked in TBC and became a bit of a shitshow after that. I wouldn't want to see them attempt it for Classic. I personally think the class fantasy, niche roles, and unqiueness is more important than what became a handful of archetypes with different names and graphics for overly similar toolkits.
---
I don't think TBC did a bad job, but after that it was just a downward spiral to complete homogenization.
---
Probably not for WoW. If you have the money to spare then go for it, but it's much more noticable in first person shooters imo. I can't play CS:GO in 60Hz at all anymore
---
Ideal raid comp has 3 healing druids so you arent gimping yourself. Priests usually are 5 per comp, tho 1 is shadow
---
You mean the same PVE players who say "lol druids/shaman/paladins/warlocks are fucking useless they do X, Y, and Z" or the "tryhard" RPers who nitpick every lore inconsistency in your backstory? 
---
Let's admit every playstyle has its share of tryhards.
---
I'd say a lot of Vanilla raiding is pretty damn easy.
---
If you can even just Heroic raid in retail, you can slap all the Vanilla raids easy. There isn't a single Vanilla raid that even compares to Heroic Tomb of Sargeras.
---
In all honesty, Paladins could not tank in Vanilla.
---
It’s not about gear or game knowledge.  The prot pally tree just doesn’t have the consistent threat generation.  You can’t taunt and dps classes pull aggro off of them too easily.
---
Paladin off spec is Ret.  Prot is a dead build.
---
this shit is why i only play AI games in league/dota with my personal friends lmao.
---
samesies here
---
Sweaty
---
100% agree, disappointing to hear the community is so generally against it.
---
Confirmed. I never have music on Skyrim or Fallout but in WoW or DnD the game feels off without it.
---
Depends on the profession. For crafting professions it says who made the item. So you could collect items that you've crafted that require a skill of 300 to make
---
At very high gear levels, resto druid is actually surprisingly powerful dueling.
---
This picture is soooo accurate
---
I agree. The hard part is keeping the treadmill of 40 geared raiders going. The more memespecs the longer the raids the more wear n tear you put your guild through
---
Yes and no.
---
Warcraft is a very expansive world to be dropped into and the first invasion has too much that needs back story to be a successful, stand-alone film. Medivh's arch doesn't really make sense without telling the story of his mother and Sargaras. They cut everything but the stones out of Karazhan. They tweaked the story of the orcs and fel. So there's a lot to suggest a greater story, but it's also clear that the good story isn't told in the movie. 
---
I agree that it had pacing issues for a fantasy, but it didn't for a western. No one who saw it was expecting a western though. 
---
It also had jack for marketing outside of China which crippled it before opening night. I think this was the biggest problem.
---
I liked most of the model updates for players, npcs, and creatures but I've gotta say the changes they made to some of the hair with the bigger, heavier, chunkier metal bands in them or worse, sometimes adding them where they weren't before, really ruined some of the hairstyles.
---
Does this apply to shapeshifted Tauren Druids, or Tauren Shamans in Ghost Wolf form? Do they go to 5yd in those forms?
---
ofc
---
But.. you don't if you're a clicker
---
unrivaled threat generation with M.C.P. that one is pretty big.
---
I'm starting to understand that the people who say this are saying it unironically, and that makes it even more hilarious.  
---
Said in whiny nerd voice: "Hold on guys, we gotta be really good at killing scripted dragons from 15 years ago."
---
I can confirm this, all other races including gnomes are the same. Gnomes however, can be harder to click on sometimes, especially if they use items to reduce their size even further (noggen fogger and world enlarger trinket)
---
Shadow priest is pretty monstrous, tho resto druid is probably the best
---
Most of us didn't even get into that.
---
I deleted a 24 Priest to save 1g on my respec from Holy to Shadow..
---
For blacksmithing, you could craft something that required 300 or whatever. Couldn't do that with herbalism though. Guess screenshots?
---
You can also equip items that have a tailoring/engineering requirement after having abandoned the profession!
---
I'm glad I don't let things like basic human decency get in my way of bashing pixels on the screen either.
---
Warlock counters mage
---
Druids really shine in soak / elemental damage fights like Huhu.
---
I believe that this method only works on spell with different effective ranges.
---
If you are in melee charge is skipped because it cannot be cast, and vice versa for hamstring.
---
However if you were trying to do the same thing with shield slam/devastate it would only ever cast shield slam and fail whenever it is on CD.
---
Betas haven’t been QA since like 2008. 
---
Betas are advertising. 
---
If you don’t like that fact than don’t buy it (but they know you’ll buy it and a good portion of you will forget to turn off your sub and keep loving them $15)
---
The real world came to games. If you have the smallest modicum of fame you get to go first. Go get fame and then you too get to go first.
---
I wish the entire movie was CGI.  Garona might have looked better that way.  Too much going on to squeeze into one movie.
---
I forgot that the only reason vanilla exists is to gear warriors.
---
In a duel, rogues should beat warriors. Having each of their cool downs up, and being able to use evasion, sprint, vanish and cold blood twice in a fight makes rogues godly in 1v1. Warriors are the worst dueling class, with no reliable disable and their only other cooldown (either retaliation or recklessness) being very easy to counter by kiting or disabling
---
I merely suggested that the OP's first spec was near cookie cutter, some folks will find higher value in certain talents based on their focus (bgs, organized pvp, world pvp, duels).
---
Imp IF is a passive boost to your bubble, allowing your bubble to last just a bit longer since the incoming damage that it absorbs is damage calculated *after* reduction from armor (for incoming physical damage). And a longer lasting bubble equates to higher survivability via defensive throughput and more time where spell pushback is void. IF is a physical buff and therefore not dispellable.
---
Meditation is more for aggressive bgs, where you WILL be constantly near oom, it's something that helps over the course of the bg, but probably not noticeable in the heat of action.
---
Imp VE and (any points spent) into Imp MB are good too, especially if you're play style is pure offensive with almost zero group support. I would take Imp VE in any shadow pvp build, but I can play the spec just fine with 0 in Imp MB.
---
Ashes to ashes beta to beta
---
I’m gonna hit 60 in 5 days played or less. Anything longer is unacceptable to me.
---
Not uncommon at all
---
Shouldn’t you be complaining about people complaining on Twitter? Oh wait, you are.
---
Why not both? 1440p with 144hz feels amazing!
---
Layering with a cap of 9000 is better then without and a cap of 3000  
---
I don't want to be on a dead server
---
This is just a reality of keeping a guild alive. Youre going to have attrition constantly and regearing new members isnt super fun so its best to get it over with ASAP. losing your tank is unironically a big deal, so yeah, funneling gear to warriors is a large portion of end-game vanilla
---
Same. It was fun to run around again and visit places but I had zero desire to level or do anything productive. Just watching streamers dork around the beta while doing stuff in retail is more than enough for me. 
---
When I start playing it's going to be to push my main, not lose hours of time to literally nothing
---
Im gonna hit random 6 times and stick with the masterpiece.
---
Right there with you buddy. I'd love to play beta but like you said, nothing really matters there. Not for me.
---
Listen. 144hz and above will change gaming for you. Anyone who tells you that 60hz is acceptable is wrong. You will not be disappointed.
---
My favourite is people posting “creating a hardcore guild for world firsts”....it was completed 15 years ago what is this world first bullshit haha
---
Watched some of this guys stream earlier, surprised Esfand hosted this garbage. 10/10 wont watch again.
---
Partially agree
---
Even with cross-server BGs, you can probably anticipate slightly longer Q's on horde.
---
You don't get beta access because tips out is too busy using wotf to break sheep.
---
If you play male dwarf, remember to choose your face with the shortest beard option on. There's a face that has all your teeth sticking out that looks ridiculous and you can only see it with the short beard option.
---
except he doesnt owe him a carry, he wanted to solo the hogger. He could offer the mage the first spawn but that mage couldnt kill, and he didnt feel like sitting and explaining why he didnt want to group and not to attack i suppose. This isn't the same as regular quest sharing.
---
Tier 3 is amazing imo. Especially on gnome master race.
---
I evaluate classes based on current and future performance. For ease of mind I'm straight up assuming that TBC and Wrath come after Classic because I have no clue what an OSRS model means for Classic WoW or what that would even look like. It's pointless to speculate at this time because Blizzard have given us no concrete answers as of now.
---
Here are my main criteria:
---
1. How flexible is the class? I.e do I strictly have one role or can I fill multiple roles?
---
2. What's the time investment like before the class comes online at level 60?
---
3. How much effort is required to farm pre-raid BiS?
---
4. How fun is it in PvE? What about PvP?
---
5. How gear dependent is the class in PvP?
---
6. When does my class/preferred spec peak relative to the content stages?
---
7. How much do I need to farm for raids on a weekly basis?
---
8. How much gold do I expend on a weekly basis?
---
9. How good is my class at farming gold, reputation or materials?
---
10. How many faction grinds do I need to worry about?
---
11. Are there any particular farm quirks I need to consider, such as druids needing to farm MCP?
---
12. Are there any annoying class quirks that I need to deal with? I.e hunters having one less bag slot, need to juggle pet happiness etc.
---
13. How common is my chosen class vs. a typical raid distribution for that class?
---
14. Will my class gain significant improvements in future versions?
---
15. How much time and effort do I have to spend on ranking up?
---
I've decided on Priest as my main, and my alts will be Druid and Warlock.
---
You get geared and play rogue patrol. Peel your healers and bully any rogues that go near them
---
Man I totally don’t remember fiat weapons in vanilla. I thought they were added in TBC
---
You should join the wow rendering discord. There are some professional blender users you can learn a ton from! Post work, see others etc. Fun times!
---
Dang that's commitment! I only did 58.9-60 there. I remember where I was sitting on my compaq computer.
---
Can you really???
---
Yeah, gear took a long time to get, especially in the later raids like you said.  That's not hardcore though.  That's a deliberate time sink to keep people paying their subs.  The actual parameters of the game were pure training wheels, hand-holding, carebear bullshit though.
---
I've said this to other people, but popularity doesn't equal good.  This game was popular *because it was easy, and also part of an already popular franchise*.  Arguably, also because of a network effect.
---
Need some context here^^ What was Dirtyauction guilty of? I suppose the name gives an idea..lol But still,the YT comments aren't helping lol
---
LOL, good point my dude.  It's going to be even less of an accomplishment now because everyone knows the perfect setup and tactics.
---
For Engineering, no you cannot.
---
That was a pretty good video! Thanks for posting.
---
Why are you so butthurt? Just join a casual guild. Problem solved. Why would you want to butt-in to "serious" guild that is trying to min-max with something, that is objectively worse? It's not a guild for you. Just join people, who doesn't care about 100% optimal approach and have fun with people, who share your definition of fun. 
---
Why acting like entitled little b and reee on people, who have no obligation to cater to your needs?
---
So if you needed to work a 60 hour week you wouldnt, because "it's a waste of life regardless of whether it's necessary or not".
---
Essentially everything you're saying boils down to "I wouldnt do that no matter what" which is completely lacking in empathy or even basic understanding of different lives having different needs.
---
But that's cool. You're the edgelord that doesn't do necessary shit. Awesome.
---
It should have been animated cartoon or shrek style movie. Then, it would have been epic.
---
Class design in retail is god awful for the majority of the classes imo.. I can't stand playing it anymore.
---
God forbid we ask them to be as patient as the other eight classes.
---
The metric I use is "what class can throw lightning bolts from its hands like fucking Zeus" while still being highly armored with at least mail and a sheild.
---
Whatever class that is most likely the one I will roll as.
---
You can find some good tips to bargains at r/buildapcsales and more advice at r/buildapc
---
They designed Eastern Kingdom first and then Kalimdor, so by the time they got to Mulgore they would've had EK's worth of experience under their belt.
---
I really do not like healing focus, if I had intention of casting heal, better to play disc/holy.  
---
Reenter shadowform costs 40% mana,  I'd rather spend the Inner Focus to clear the opponent's mana or kill him with a powerful mind blast. I have a warlock mind, i guess.
---
Desperate Prayer/Fear ward can be used on Shadowform?
---
Hm, I imagine what you've said is true for most people, during most of the game. But once you're in naxx gear, I believe warriors stop losing to rogues.
---
This is the main reason they’re hesitant to do something like this
---
This spec will definitely work
---
you will see that it has insane potential, and that with the recent theorycrafting, this build can honestly outperform a lot of other classes, due to mainly ONE thing; In PvP there was a trinket from AQ I think that would bring down a meteor on a target. Paladins with this +holy shock crit could sometimes have high enough burst to kill someone once every 3 minutes. But that's about it really.
---
Lol Tips being good
---
And it’s not like it will even have that big of effect on your raid, it’s just...why? Why purposely handicap yourself? I can drive my car with 3 tires but I’d much rather do it with 4.
---
What does basic human decency have to do with it?  Why just carry people when you can make it easier and faster for yourself?
---
Snutz is one the best pvp players ever as well lol, I don’t see soda beating him
---
Are you drunk or just not a native English speaker?
---
First off, I'm doing this thing called "making fun of people."  I find it funny sometimes, especially when my target is super-self-serious types (like progression raiders).  So "butthurt" has nothing to do with it.  Like, if you unironically say "I'm in a top guild" and you got custom made obnoxious "gamer" style button down shirts with your colors and logo on them, why wouldn't I make fun of you?
---
If you're talking about Wowhead, just toggle Classic at the top of the page.
---
The problem is they’ll just leave because tank poaching is a very real thing and a reason why most tanks are the GM or an officer. Tanks are rare, geared and experienced tanks even more so. A guild that doesnt give their tank gear and instead throws it to the ret paladin is going to A. Not progress and B. Be looking for a new tank soon
---
Prob still phase one maybe starting phase 2.
---
ayn\_rand.txt
---
The real value of gear is keeping the 39 Muppets  you want around from MC still around in AQ or Naxx.
---
I hope so
---
I didn't have to do any of that but I also didn't have the authenticator. Took them less than 24 hours and I had my old characters hooked back into my account. Outstanding customer service. I've needed them 2-3 times and they've delivered.
---
I had a compaq nw8000 laptop, haha. Still got and it somehow works
---
Windfury totem.  Looks like Arcanite reaper on horde side gonna be bis until raid drops in phase 1-2
---
Dirtyauction was one of the most verbally abusive people I’ve ever seen in WoW. He did a lot of twink pvp and verbally assaulted everyone he came in contact with.
---
One time I got a random whisper’d apology from him after I wouldn’t dual him and he swore at me for 5 mins. To this day, I assume it’s because Blizzard had warned/suspended him for his abusive behavior so many times that he was on thin ice and reluctantly apologized to avoid another suspension.
---
Flask of supreme power alone adds 150 spell damage
---
great to hear.  I had never heard of a class lead before, that's pretty badass.
---
what are your thoughts about a PvE server?
---
Nice ty
---
- Is it a paladin?
---
I really don't understand why you think it has anything to do with Ayn Rand, or human decency?  
---
Why do people who choose to play ret or enhance or boomkin feel entitled to raid slots in serious guilds?
---
Just remember, this subreddit as well as the beta have an overrepresentation of players in the “hardcore to no-life” spectrum. Casual play is perfectly fine, with one caveat: do your homework. Some things don’t lend themselves to casual play, like hardcore PvP or playing a dps Warrior or trying to raid with a meme spec like shadow priest or ret Paladin. If you’re casual, you’re likely playing solo often. So pick a class that can do fun things solo. Warlock and hunter can both solo some instance runs and are generally easy to gear. Mage is wanted in raids and isn’t hard to learn the basics, also the ease of movement is fantastic. Rogue can gank in world PvP and pickpocket. 
---
If I were super casual I’d roll with skinning and mining just to earn some extra cash. Casual = poor usually so every bit helps! 
---
There’s a LOT of room in classic for the casuals like us, don’t worry!
---
I think flask of supreme power (+150 spell damage) is what tips the scale in favor of shadow oil, problem is its a pricey consumable for a melee to use on top of all of the other consumes but nonetheless a decent boost to overall dps
---
So is it like a quota system?  Once a certain number of people put enough points into the prot tree on a warrior, no one else can roll one?  Was this different back in vanilla and the pservers just got it wrong, because I can log into any of them and just, like, make a prot warrior without a problem.
---
Someone with beta access report this as a bug and let's find out.
---
Never before have I wished Summer would end as soon as it began
---
"warcraft’s impressive results put it on course to challenge Furious 7’s $150m opening instalment in China"
---
I dont think its that the chinese love warcraft or video games which i mean some do. But i think its just time and place for the chinese economy
---
Can we talk about how the Alliance is obviously the more "friendly" faction.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Well I don't live on the north pole or anything but Finland gets a lot of snow. I like it. Everything looks clean and peaceful.
---
This
---
You've somehow managed to out-autism queen austism herself.
---
Similarly to SL locks they rot their opponents away and have really good healing.
---
Well, I mean, the number of stacks is irrelevant. It's not hard to refresh after 20. The main concern is how much more mitigation 1813 provides compares to 1395. I did some rough calcs with the known Vanilla armor calc formula—**DamageReduction = Armor / (Armor + 400 + 85 * (AttackerLevel + 4.5 * (AttackerLevel - 60)))**—and a base armor total of 1000 (a bit above the 895 given by the full epic PvP set). With an Improved Inner Fire setting your armor to 2813 rather than 2395, your damage reduction increases by approximately 2.5%.
---
Is that entirely negligible? No, not at all. Sometimes that small percentage really will mean the difference between life and death. But I don't think, on the whole, that it is worth giving up several points in both faster Mind Blasts and passive VE healing, especially since you're actually spending 5 points to get to and spec into Imp IF due to the preceding tier being wasteful. So you need to give up 10% passive healing and 1.5 seconds of your Mind Blast (or else forego even more potent skills like Shadow Reach) for a fractional increase in a specific type of damage reduction that you're already getting 6 times more of from Shadowform.
---
I can understand why it's not a total waste. No doubt. I recognize the value of ~2.5% reduction in a vacuum. But do you think that ~2.5% is worth 5 points? I personally am unconvinced.
---
Where would these fights take place?
---
i normally would agree but (as a permanent warlock main) i think druids have the upper hand at 30. no deathcoil, no conflag, no spell lock/devour magic, no crit gear.
---
i think druid wins the war of attrition here.
---
Pretty sure I couldn't outdo you and your whole whine infested entitled topic that you posted.
---
The shitty one.
---
Excuse me, what? He has two world buffs, Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer and Songflower Serenade. He has two raid buffs, Blessing of Kings and Blessing of Might.
---
That's not full world buffs and it's definitely not full raid buffs.
---
Also, what do you mean when you say "half BiS half pre-raid gear"? He's wearing nothing but dungeon blues, quest blues, and a crafted helmet. That certainly isn't half BiS gear for the spec.
---
Even the debuffs on the target are totally reasonable and dont include Judgement of the Crusader, which would be a significant dps increase.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Farm gold so you can re-spec between raids.
---
Weird flex buy okay.
---
quick question, who gives a fuck?
---
Ye most raid teams have an officer of each class to either assign loot based on need/reward and to teach. PvE personally makes me feel like youre missing a huge part of vanilla, world pvp. But if youre an rper youre stuck for the time being
---
You can with tailoring
---
Same
---
Nice relic you got there. Gotta frame the MoBo of that bad boy some day
---
This is great, might be removed, but great lol
---
Can't believe it's *current year* and there's no offline mode for battle.net
---
Played in vanilla, didn’t get beta but have been playing the stress tests.  I’m excited for both...
---
I'd ignore him. He literally comments no changes on every single thread and adds zero discussion.
---
the fleshed out daily quests helped revitalize it. But it did make for a lot cheesier engagements in that people ran away to the skies and especially annoying if they had the 280% speed.
---
I got my first ever epic drop doing 57-60 on the yeti's. it was an epic ring good for tanks and i remember selling it for 800g and balling the fuck out. it started with an S, i cant remember the rest of the name... Stormbringer or some shit
---
Tiddys are blurred, just humour :P
---
Unlikely since they said they are usually the original mount system. NOT the mount system of 1.12.1, of which changing them to BOP was part of.

The reality of playing prot sucks unless you can play hardcore. Even with guild help you are gunna be farming gold nonstop to afford repairs, upgrades, enchants, consumes. Its also not easy, yeah you could get some mouthbreather thats a level 60 prot warrior but gl clearing when they dont know fights, are keyboard turning or clicking abilities
---
I actually loved the movie. I think it suffered the most from being cut too short. It should have been 2.5h to fully flesh out the epic story and the characters. Apparently they wanted it shorter for more viewings so we got rushed through the entire thing.
---
All of your criteria works but there is a few equalizers and other ways of thinking.
---
1. What do you want to play. Period. If you want to play ne huntard and do flip arcane shots. Just do it.
---
There is no other points. Here’s why,
---
Want to be rich? Roll mage right? Wrong, you can easily make good money as any class fishing for stone scale/squid etc.
---
Want to dominate pvp? Roll warrior right? Wrong,  you need dedicated healers to really crush does, so unless you have a cult like following. You won’t crush like Pat did in his videos.
---
Pve? Everyone has a place and the good news is pubs will be a thing. So your guild won’t tell you to reroll a new class because they have 40 huntards.
---
Alliance or horde also interferes with power balance of classes. 
---
-Dwarfs extra stomp rogues/warriors
---
-Undead extra stomp warlocks/priests
---
Bottom line there should only be one factor. What do you want to play. Period.
---
Not down with the neural implants thing but everything else sounded kinda sick
---
I'll be taking the time to RP, read all the quest logs.   I do find PvP in open world to be thrilling, and possibly feel more alive.  but I haven't beaten all of the PvE content...  I don't want humans to get in the way of my leveling, or if my guild is trying to raid and another guild is fighting us.... could be epic.... but it seems like a voluntary, unnecessary time sink that I don't get a lot of value from.
---
So the effect is good but the cost benefit is poor and as you improve your equipment, the diminishing return makes it even worse!?
---
No changes is definitely not the same as need rolling on every piece of gear that drops that you could *possibly* use. Good luck finding groups with a reputation like that
---
SW is shadow weaving, how priests can increase shadow damage done to target by 15%. 
---
NF is Nightfall i think, that weapon that has - chance on hit: spell damage taken by your target increased 15% for 5 seconds.
---
DMF i believe is in reference to the Darkmoon Faire buff: Sayge's Dark Fortune of Damage which increases all damage dealt by 10%.
---
Traces and FoR, not really sure.
---
\^Thinks being prot is about being speced prot and not about gear, i loled. "Yeah man, ill just roll up a prot warrior, will be geared and leveled in a week, maybe 1.5 weeks tops, EZ"
---
&gt;you know exactly what to expect,
---
All I know is exactly when to drop out of the game again. They're not doing a 100% repeat of content past vanilla, that'd be so unwise.
---
Is it bad that I know EXACTLY the vocals you're talking about, just based off of your transcript?
---
I hate you
---
It really needs to be raided and ruined.
---
To each their own. Rping is just another aspect of the game, with no rp-pvp servers on launch youre just in a bind if you want both
---
This is a bad mindset, as both Melekith and I independently argued. In PvP, your strength consists of your *entire* toolkit. Arbitrarily limiting yourself to not casting heals, which you are able to do in Shadow spec, is poor PvP. Hybrid DPS specs are as useful as they are in PvP precisely *because* they can spot heal themselves and others, and 2/2 in Healing Focus is a minuscule investment for one of the best returns you could hope for if you find yourself against a wall. If your choice in a fight is either "fall out of Shadowform and heal" or "die", the choice is obvious. And there *will* be times where it's the best course of action to fall out of Shadowform and heal.
---
If you have a Warlock mind and insist on not ever using the healing toolkit of your class, then play Warlock. If you want to play Shadowpriest, then play Shadowpriest, with *all* its tools at your disposal, including emergency healing ability.
---
It's fascinating to see what happens when a person does not have enough courage to reply directly to threads.
---
I'm...Sorry... There are no permancy to anything in life my dude
---
I refuse to believe that the supply of non-mouthbreathers completely outstrips the demand for tanks, especially when we're talking about a game as old and easy as vanilla WoW.  Straight up, people did this without any real clue of what they were doing 15 years ago, and if someone can't figure it out by now, then I'd question how they are able to tie their own shoes.
---
Dude, just upload your ID to blizzard. They won’t help you if you don’t.
---
Kinda funny how people project their social anxiety onto your posts.
---
Playing Classic together is kinda like going to a Football viewing together.
---
You invited the person/accepted the invite to spend some of your free time with the person. And if you meet the person on future viewers and block any attempt of conversation that will form feelings and opinions.
---
Huh?
---
This is a distinguishable situation. First because, hey have already said they are using the original mount system, not the 1.12.1 system. This would just be going along with that. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit#riding
---
Second, because this has nothing do with with progressive itemization. This is progressive availability. Similar to how they are adjusting loot tables progressively, but using the 1.12 version. 
---
They have specifically stated they want progressive availability: 
---
There always is.  Eventually they have to open the floodgates if they want to test a crushing load of logins, character creations and gameplay activity.  It's much too early for an OB announcement yet but it'll probably happen in late July or the beginning of August.
---
On the main road in STV just outside the Arena. Most people would play in the Arena while waiting for their turn or spectating. People would be in a Vent and the General chat of the zone was busy.
---
Also Silithus sometimes. People waiting to raid, the faction battle to keep you busy and then a big group by the summoning stone doing battles.
---
If you're dps spec you wont have problems with threat, get 15 points in prot for defiance. then go DPS.
---
I think vanilla is an exception though (as it is in so many ways). From this thread it's obvious there's other contenders such as Winterspring.
---
You’ve clearly not played a blizzard game in a while. Im surprised half the playerbase remembers to breath
---
If you find a guild to accept you. And if not, you make that Guild and declare yourself the main tank as a druid.
---
I swear the number of people who make threads seeking emotional reassurance about something that requires they themselves to be social individuals and participate in the community on the server, it's strange.
---
worst part is you have to join their discord to fix any problem with your VF listing, pppssssshhhhh fuck off.
---
But does he land in the water?
---
Yeah I gave in to my anticipation and played on an “undocumented server” and leveled to 60 in two weeks. Now I’m content just waiting lol.
---
I hate the lore post-cata. I hate the way they keep adding land masses while the old world is left to rot. One of the things I'm looking forward to the most is wiping the slate clean.
---
How in the fuck did you get to that conclusion?  First off, it was a hyperbolic, mocking statement to begin with, and yeah, I'm well aware you have to level and gear yourself, just like you would any class.  Stop acting like warriors are special snowflakes that need every whim of theirs catered to.
---
'Token Druid' is a common phrase.
---
2 Druids do not produce 2 times the healing, because only one Rejuv and one Regrowth can be up on any target.
---
I jave beta. Level 25 and not rushing. Its great but I'm just gonna have to do it again.
---
Its cool participating. I found several bugs. But I'm still counting the days for classic like everyone else so i can get invested.
---
Yea it must be darkmoon faire buff , and the others make sense. I found traces on a list here https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-consumables-list-for-each-class its a buff from the geyser in silithus to give 5% more damage. Still not sure on what FoR stands for tho
---
That may be the case, but in my (limited) experience as an AQ40 near BIS warrior dueling rogues, you don’t get many opportunities to actually get hits off. Having more armor and health makes the duel last longer and means if you do get the opportunity, you’ll do much more damage, but a good rogue won’t let you have that chance
---
Yes, I wish I could have clipped just a few more seconds without missing the start. Had to pick.
---
Alright, fair enough, I can believe retail Blizzard gamers are that stupid.
---
Why do all the unit frame addons for WoW look pretty much exactly the same anyway?
---
Of course you can make fun of people, who enjoy doing things in a different way, than you. And guess what, it works both ways. These people can make fun of you as well. The only sad thing is, that at least in this scenario, people will mostly laugh at you, not with you.
---
You're literally just sitting in front of your PC like: "Those damn people are not having fun in the same way as I do. REEEEEEEEEE! Why can't they understand, that their way of having fun is ridiculous and should be laughed at? Why... why they do not want to invite me to their club... Can't they see, how awesome Boomkin \[and/or other memespec\] I am? I... I deserve the gear more, because it's actually harder for me, right? Right guys?"
---
But yeah, man. You're literally comedy genius.
---
Excuse you, where's archeology?
---
I've RP'd for years and never had that problem.
---
My dream deathbed situation involves some downtime playing classic. 
---
Wow.
---
Correct. It is most beneficial when you have 0 armor. But since Priests have low base armor anyway, you shouldn't worry too much about DR considerations.
---
The main issue is the point investment. You simply don't need 2/2 into Mana Burn; its cast speed is perfectly fine as-is. And you don't need any points in Meditation, either. So look at the talent tree like this: You have a _/5 talent that reads [Reduces Physical damage done to you by 0.5%]. Would you ever take such a talent?
---
Some might, especially if they feel that they have trouble with melee classes. But given that you need to give up 5 points in other talents to accomplish that goal, I personally don't think it's worth it.
---
All the cliffs, and icy chunks in the water! Though as Horde, I must say we got super dicked in HF; the Alliance base is so much cooler than Vengeance landing! I levelled a human DK on a wotlk server, and entering the fjord on the boat for the first time must have been amazing. It almost made me regret the previous 5 years of Horde commitment. 
---
Thus I never developed a love for HF like GHills. I assume you played Ally
---
The problem is that several zones like Icecrown and the Storm Peaks are designed around flying. Not just in terms of accessibility, but visually. You can't really appreciate them without flight.
---
They specifically said that appearance changes, race changes or faction changes won't be in. They also said that they may be put in after launch if there's demand for them.
---
Just relax bro, it was just a joke, no need to take everything so seriously...
---
Literally can't believe you're getting down voted. The liberal brainrot is real!
---
I was looking forward to the 2 day long AVs :(
---
Where do you think racists, alt-righters, white-supremacists and nazis come from? Do you think they poof into existence to equalize the entropy of the universe, or that they have always existed, as an un-aging, ominous void?  
---
No, nowadays they come from the numerous circle-jerk safe spaces (r/ImGoingToHellForThis, /pol/, etc), where its all just for the memes... until, you know, when at one point it isn't anymore.  
---
I'm curious, do you think the Christchurch shooter was just memeing, I mean that "remove kebab" meme is just for the lulz amirite?
---
I've been posting about being in the beta and haven't been harassed or downvoted for it. Maybe it's how you word things or something, no idea.
---
Fingers crossed
---
here's a tip: you can't really choose your co workers. are you 12?
---
That would be ideal, but doesn't really fall in line with #nochanges progressive availability.
---
Well it can't. Only spells with a 3.5s cast time get the full 1:1 scale.
---
Further testing will be needed, but I still don't think this is going to become the new rogue meta.
---
You can tell Community is a distant 5th place in their considerations when they keep making posts asking other people to reassure them that they will be able to raid given X spec or x-class. I'm like, you're responsible for crafting the community experience you want and making the friends you want to play with or making the guild that you want to play in.
---
maybe it's their routine day off , they come in the next day and heard you called in sick and they say "oh.. he was on his computer 12 hours straight in black rock mountain last i saw"
---
and if you can play a computer game you can damn well sit at a computer at work and have excel open
---
Wow, do you have a camera in my house or can you just, like, touch the screen and *feel* my words?
---
Quite frankly, I don't care how people have their fun, I'm still going to make fun of them if they're dorks about it.  The total opposite of fun for me here were to be if I was in a progression guild (complete with Loot Council, natch), so why would I want to be in their club if I find what they do to be undignified?  For whatever it's worth, my main is a totally normal frost mage.  No meme specs here.
---
Sad to hear about the politics being mentioned. Really not in the spirit of the game. A video game should be an escape from that. I'd rather us focus on the things that bring us together, not tear us apart. My $0.02.
---
Skip the friends, you know what always happens; they stop playing and you end up rerolling two months behind everyone.
---
&gt; Eventually they have to open the floodgates if they want to test a crushing load of logins, character creations and gameplay activity.
---
They've already done this. Twice actually.
---
It won't be a 1:1 scale. Regular shadowbolt (3s cast) only gets 85.71% from spell damage.
---
They are just BoP items, they don't require tailoring to wear. The engineering items require engineering to equip them.
---
Use of the word actually in these instances is hilarious. Low-key shiting on other people's opinions.
---
&gt; You can only do so much without rewriting everything.
---
Doom 2016 is, by your definition, running on the same engine as Quake 1.
---
I got as far as 4 pieces of T1, and as much as I do t love it, I’d choose Druid every time.
---
I mean, what you actually suggested was, and I quote, "IF is arguably the best talent point that a Priest can spec, regardless of build." As I responded to OP with armor calculation math, 3 points into IF gives, at best, about 3% extra physical damage reduction, from around 29% to 32% with a base armor of 1000. And since two points need to go into Meditation to get there, it's basically a pseudo 5-point talent. I personally don't think a talent that reads [Reduces Physical damage done to you by 0.5%] is all that inspiring, and it's certainly not what I'd call "the best talent point that a Priest can spec" even if one does determine it useful enough to spec into.
---
I can fully understand why a Priest would decide in the end to use it, if they value it more highly than other skills. But I don't know why you would characterize it as being this incredibly important, centralizing skill especially given that it's got 2 skill points of bloat baggage.
---
To the center!
---
so much this. in season 8 my best buddy and i leveled new toons to 80 specifically to arena comp as affliciton/holy paladin which was the hotness in the 2s meta
---
me and him got the right gear and started queueing arena
---
we lose. a lot. we can't get a groove going. we end up arguing all the fucking time. dude ends up finding a new partner and gets his weapon and i did the same.
---
the salt was hell awkward.
---
Out of curiosity, did you duel with a shield?
---
started in cata, quit in legion, hyped for classic
---
tbh I'm literally just hyped about a version of wow with other people playing it. not worried about any of the difficult parts, plenty of people find the harder leveling experience fun, but even if I hate it all I care about is having an actual populated world
---
fuck.
---
that.
---
WSG Flag Carry or Guard the Hunter guarding your flag.
---
Be an annoyance to enemy casters, CC enemy melee, understand you're not going to be killing anyone that's not your endgame. You want to build to soak up damage while doing noticeable enough damage that enemy casters can't afford you stuck to them.
---
You want to draw attention to you by sticking to the right targets and turn the enemies GCDs, resources and skill cooldowns on YOU vs your DPS.
---
It's a selfless playstyle. You need to be aware of your limitations and don't tunnel vision like a DPS would. Know when it's the right time to try and kill someone vs when you're just interrupting, slowing, getting their attention to swap targets and then move onto the next person.
---
Every number of damage and cooldowns that's being used on you (built to take it) vs your DPS is a advantage towards your team.
---
----------|E   I'm here ready to take him out
---
it's serious because it's what i plan on doing.
---
Is there actually people who had a sub that long that are not in the beta? Be honest
---
Series may work well. I hope netflix will do that.
---
it's the right decision
---
scrubs suck
---
soda is getting his ass whooped by this lock everytime they duel, double sac is just too OP at that level, theres no way you can outdamage/outsustain them
---
And you know this how? It's been 15 years since anyone could have experienced vanilla spell batching first-hand.
---
Weird hearing this as a vanilla vet. I loved WOTLK, but it felt so different to me. I think WOTLK was the last expansion that I thought was a good progression forward, even though some major fundamental flaws started showing up. But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t love the raids in wrath.
---
The Light bless you
---
I’ve seen this posted and discussed probably around 30 times. I’m sorry you haven’t seen it yet, but it has made the rounds a few times.
---
And it was stickied for a while.
---
&gt;the only indication he was important was quest text and glorified fan service.
---
Nothing wrong with that.
---
In case anyone browsing this thread wants to learn more about the more in-depth aspects of Fury warrior DPS:
---
[Here is a pretty good guide!](https://github.com/ppach/furyguide/blob/master/furyguide.pdf)
---
oh shit you got a vod link? im def down to watch
---
also according to the tourny rules snutz should only get 1 double sac right?
---
My guess is they'll have a fair gap between phase 1 and 2, to both optimise the game early on and let people level up, so most likely still phase 1... that being said, i think once phase 2 drops they'll continue releasing new phases every quarter of a year or so, to keep it fresh :)
---
No idea what you guys are talking about. It just says Classic as far as I'm aware. Sometimes the little mail icon turns red when I'm in trouble. Otherwise no images.
---
Never understoof studying.... like how can it takr that long?
---
Thank you edited
---
If you're not worried about gold sure.
---
You can do that if you want. There's really no such thing as ideal, there's how you want to spend your time and how you want to use your professions both for yourself and for friends or guilties.
---
Illidan dropped glowing green ones in TBC.
---
you are correct, off topic was not the phrase i wanted to use, it should have been false equivalence
---
everyone knows that when you go play another game you lose everything and start again, but I have had people actively tell me the reason why a WoW2 would not exist, would not succeed is because it would split the player base and no one would want to start again. 
---
As you agree this is blatantly false as any game you start fresh you start with nothing. Proven now by classic wow not having anything for you to carry over.
---
This ain’t it.
---
People on reddit don’t understand how to use the downvote button. Don’t take it personal.
---
Alchemy is still a pretty crazy money maker, and the herbs are probably going to be more expensive than just buying the potions themselves after a while. However, replacing herbalism is definitely not the worst idea if you have a better profession to replace it with AND you know that herb prices are not super high on the market.
---
Shadow oil with consumes is for sure better on warriors over dense sharpening stones? Ive never tried shadow oil before
---
You're not clicking to target, you're clicking to cast. It's like a mouseover macro.
---
The reason Luna was really popular *I think* is because you couldn't just put /cast [@mouseover] in macros in 1.12. if there was a way to do that in a macro it likely was a hassle.
---
Also, it showed incoming heals from other healers, helps avoid overhealing.
---
I could be wrong about the mouseover macro though! But it's definitely not the same. In classic you will likely be able to slap that in a macro however.
---
My advice would be to ignore the people bashing Druids in Vanilla- Resto Druids are awesome and the levelling experience for you will be amazing. Even if Resto doesn't work out for you or you find you're struggling to compete for raid spots, you can flex around and experiment with other forms for a bit of fun, but if you're good at what you do nobody in their right mind should sub you out for another class :)
---
Could share loot with paladin or shaman
---
Couldn't you just use /castsequence to handle that then, with a reset set to the cooldown time?
---
i don't got a vod link, but everytime i saw soda and other people dueling locks at that level they just got double sac + chain feared  to death
---
[This](https://web.archive.org/web/20080319141926/http://tkasomething.com/deadzone.php)
---
tanks dont level with tanking gear tho
---
so prot warriors are allowd to grab 2h upgrades
---
that is the rules for vanilla
---
don't like it? dont pug. 
---
but im sure your smart guildies will also use the logic i described.
---
If you want to level fast, don't bother with anything except skinning (vendor everything) and just level mining/engineering after you hit 60.
---
On a real note.... where is bejheera or sonii
---
if u want to play a single game, go play retail.
---
Hogger is a quest mob - he could still "solo" hogger while giving the guy credit instead of wasting the other player time waiting for the respawn. Also the other player could have contributed to the fight but the streamer decided to inflate his own ego.
---
He also bases all of his information on private server data currently.  Now that we know what the parry chance for bosses is, he might end up being off on quite a few things in regards to viable druid tanking.
---
People are "dorks about stuff" only if you are trying to change them for whatever reason or pointlessly throwing your opinions on someone, who has no interest in them. Because if you don't, they don't give a damn about you.
---
And you know, what so called "top guilds" are trying to do, right? To find out the most optimal... The fastest way of doing stuff. And they are having fun doing so. I mean, yeah, your jokes are literally the most funny and clever stuff I've ever heard. Totally the greatest gift to humanity. But in the end, you are just being a bitch to people, who are minding their own business. You're free doing so, but it makes you kind of an asshole.
---
This is private server content
---
I was the first post but sure buddy.
---
For a long time prot tree was really bad and not worth investing it past last stand.
---
So everybody and their mother went 31/5/15 and never looked back.
---
 !RemindMe 86 days
---
*Laughs in private servers*
---
Are hunters going to have a dead zone again?
---
Well, I think it is fine to ask.  What you just said isn't really going to help him, because he can't MT most of the raiding game, so no guild would/should ever make him 'the' MT.  
---
This is a unique situation in mmo gaming honestly; every expansion post vanilla allowed druids to tank effectively, where as vanilla barely supports it, and really doesn't officially support it in a raiding environment, especially post T1 content.
---
But who was fury tank
---
Ugh my company does sick days and PTO as the same as well, end result is I never take sick days when I'm actually sick because if I'm gonna be miserable anyways I'd rather be miserable at work than miserable and wasting pto
---
Protecting the priest from hunter/rogues please.
---
Sonii's in there...
---
Eh, you might be able to tank a few bosses in BWL, but so many of them hit like trucks on geared prot warriors.  I don't think a druid is going to be a feasible choice. 
---
Even if it was possible for a druid to survive with geared/skilled healers; it still is a massive handicap on the guild.
---
Usually RP in Inns is ERP though!
---
Thanks to crushing blows existing, it would just be a handicap to the guild that tries to let a druid be a MT.
---
The itemization to properly do resistance gear in PVP doesn't exist. You gimp yourself badly by putting it on. But for extremely niche circumstances, like duels, you can do some stuff.
---
I don't see the connection tbh. Those questions were prevelant during vanilla and its no suprise they're being asked again for classic.
---
The game has a 240+ hour grind to be able to raid and some classes are role locked for progression raiding, so if you like retri but hate holy asking on the viability of retri is natural, especially for someone who hasn't been playing vanilla since TBC or hasn't played at all.
---
My bad i started from the right.  I didn't expect someone thinking hed lose.
---
However bajheera is the best warrior im the beta for horde
---
Except for that one all Druid Guild. They are going to have a druid main tank come hell or high water.
---
where is staysafe?
---
Out of combat, I would remove the shadowform, heal, reactivate and drink.  
---
But in combat I would die shooting (and heal with lifesteal), sincerely.
---
  
---
And I believe that the fact that the character can not heal in the shadowform corroborates this mindset with the spec fantasy, even though this is not the most effective gameplay.  
---
Even using healing spells, Martydom and PW:S already play the role of Healing focus very well, I think this is overkill.
---
the sentiment on the right will also be the prevailing meta in classic after the newness wears off. furthermore, its completely possible to approach bfa with the attitude on the left and enjoy the game immensely.
---
Scarlet Monastery gear most likely
---
Performance in PvE and gameplay during raids/dungeons for me.
---
Just be chill. 
---
I have homies/colleagues that are at dif levels of dedication to wow and i seem to be able to play with and without them without issue... 
---
Just dont add Tony the narc from accounting that will snitch on u for being in your house on your sick day.
---
This.  
---
One of the things I loved about not having cross-realm games is you see the same people, you develop a reputation. But the trade-off is miserable, as described above.
---
144 makes 60 look like 30
---
Sonii himself says he can't be Snutz.
---
OP, this game has been out for 15 years.  People have been playing vanilla emulators for years and years. All the viable specs have been mapped out. You're not going to discover something that hasn't been discovered in the past 15 years.
---
You are lumping in people from different groups/mindsets together... there is your first problem.
---
4 alts:
---
1) Cloth &amp; Herbs
---
2) Skinning
---
3) Blues &amp; Greens
---
4) Food &amp; misc
---
Main will have skinning only, at 60 learn tailoring, first aid and cooking. Drop Skinning for Engineer and Drop tailoring after I craft my robe for Herb or Mining

Where's Dirge?

How did this post trigger you this much lmfao
---
I dont find it to be a smack to the face. Since I don’t have beta myself I enjoy watching the streams.
---
You can also shrink your hitbox as Tauren on classic by using deviate fish and presumably noggenfogger (To a normal human sized hitbox)
---
Sadly.. new server names. 
---
I kind of hope they have some way for us to hover over these new names and see some old names they were meant to replace (based on time zone).
---
Yep
---
Oh theyll care when they see my CE panda
---
Hey, Tom Bombadil does not speak like that! Mods!!
---
That was a nice lil read there
---
Yep. PvE on my paladin, but did BGs on my lock.
---
I would honestly. A WL mind tapping and then getting healed to full by the priest will be a lot less mana needed than a priest not getting last hit and having to constantly drink at higher levels when the wand isnt best anymore.
---
Ok so not many people will tell you, but instead of going for a 144hz, if wow is what you're mainly interested in, I'd recommend an ultrawide 21:9 monitor instead. Prob can find a decent one with 100hz refresh rate for a good price.
---
Honestly the extra screen space is fantastic for mmos, once you start getting a bunch of addons, and your in a large raid, the extra space is a blessing.
---
You can barely tank 5 mans at 60 in vanilla, sadly.  This was fixed with TBC with the talent expansion/rework, but pallys lacked mana regen of any kind and had no taunt.
---
People will literally threaten to kill you irl if you pick off meta champs in casual Mobas, its a wild ride in gamer bro land.
---
Ofc it's a spectrum, it's never black and white. I'm not sure what you are getting at with the whole "90's" thing.
---
But the younger you are, the harder it is to cope with and the easier it is to get an addiction, because you are worse at calculating risk and consequence of your actions.
---
Op described very well, what can happen to a young man, if left to his own devices without the will to do it in moderation.
---
Thank the lord. Stoked to watch a Druid trap em and scrap em
---
Yeah Snutz should kill Soda. Much, much better player and class advantage to boot.
---
You up?
---
Agreed.  It is better that people know just how bad prot pallys actually were so they don't get sucked into this fantasy of being able to do anything in the end game as a tank.
---
Bottom line is that druids are far better than pallys for the role, and druids suffer from their own issues that make them quite a bit worse than warriors for the job.  Pallys just can't sustain on medium-long length fights, and you have to get mana every single pull in a 5 man, even beyond what a typical healer would have to do.
---
Patch 8.2 looks pretty interesting actually.
---
Rogue beats warrior at lower levels of gear, then warrior overcomes rogue in DPS once they're geared to the teeth. Threat is more of an issue on horde side, and it can become a problem on some fights, depending on how much threat your tank is putting out. That means rogues are sometimes #1, warriors are sometimes #1, in raw damage.   
---
Meanwhile, warriors are always more versatile cause of tanking.
---
orc warriors only get about 35% from maxing out the talent, it's not additive
---
hardiness is worth much more than 8 talent points, it still shouldn't be changed though
---
What if if I played since 05 but stopped playing in 12
---
He had a name for himself back in Vanilla. He just continued in Private servers. He addresses differences between Vanilla and anything in the Private Server he's on.
---
Oh I like that. Makes perfect sense
---
I mean.... How many talent points is WOTF worth? What about Escape Artist? Hardiness isn't the only OP racial.
---
60 hours a week of work plus a family.  
---
I am sure you will have fun regardless, but be aware that you are likely looking at around a good 6-8 months to hit 60.  I am assuming you are going to have an average of around 2~ hours a day to play?
---
If anything its good, because it takes gold out of the system invested into an unneeded vanity item early on.
---
Who cares if you buy said mount for 2500g later on?
---
That is life.  You work what you have to in order to support your family.  Not everyone has an easy way to their dream position.
---
classic players always nail the old.reddit links
---
nah
---
nope
---
Not to sound like a dick, but does anyone care that you reached 300 Tailoring at one point but no longer have it? What benefit does anyone get for knowing you had something, but no longer have it and can no longer offer tour services with it?
---
WAITER THIS GUY NEEDS MORE TEA
---
shes bringing you more tea
---
That's very general of you to assume. I've watched all his videos and he routinely addresses any differences between Vanilla and any private server.
---
He's addressed the changes in parry chance for Classic.
---
I know he's accurate because I played Warrior and my best friend and boss of the Lan center I  worked at played Druid as all through Vanilla up to Naxx. He tanked in Naxx with me and on my first C'Thun kill.
---
One thing you have to keep in mind about the hybrids in LegacyPlayers is those tend to be players who are trying their hardest, using as many consumables as possible, and are overly-geared compared to the content they're doing. And they **still** end up doing literally less than half of 'real' damage classes.   
---
The figures provided by LegacyPlayers might not be totally precise -- but the margin of error is small.
---
Someone got rekt by an orc warrior me thinks
---
Man, I can't believe how many absolute morons like you keep saying crap like this.
---
As if everyone in life has the option to reach their dream position in life.  If you have a family and don't want to uproot them constantly, then you do what you have to do.
---
It’s a joke, how are you possibly taking this seriously. Josh has like 4 world first kills or something, you think he actually cares about soloing Hogger. How are so many of you so oversensitive about streamers, it’s more than a little pathetic.
---
Might stop being cool but for a lot of people they are genuinely just nicer looking.
---
the armored wolves have too big fangs and their spikey collars look ridiculous. Also glowy eyes???
---
the unarmoured mounts are simply true to live. For someone liking simplicity I like my gear not glowing at all.
---
As a  tauren player, the white and red unarmoued 100% mounts are just the coolest mounts.

No. No they haven't.  A stress test that not everybody is allowed in isnt what he is talking about
---
Blasted Lands because it's too ugly and harsh on my eyes with the bright red. Just that particular shade, it's too much and makes me nauseous. I think I like all the other zones. Maybe not Azshara for the same reason (and no reason to go there)
---
Phase 2 probably wont take too long, but phase 3 probably wouldn't be out till the end of the year, or early next year I imagine.
---
When people say horde have better PVP racials, they don't mean *slightly* better.
---
Leader of the  Pack crit buff, slightly higher dmg, better aoe tanking, higher health/armor at the cost of taking higher damage, higher single target threat.
---
“Can blizzard plz hire this guy as a commentator” the title isn’t a literal one. obviously this guy is a streamer having fun, the person who posted this thread understands his humor and I don’t think you do.

Can't wait until people learn this
---
Then why's it an issue at all. why not let anyone need anything they can use then I guess?
---
The amount of running around doing nothing in this video is amazing.  
---
I can't wait to see the videos that will come out of Classic.
---
It was possible, yes. However, even back then people were wanting it to get fixed. This was not something that was seen as common and fair. If you were caught doing this, you could be punished for exploiting.
---
One of the things I remember of playing is jumping backwards on the walls right next to the flag and slowly wall jump up into the air as a hunter so I could just shoot people. The first encounter I had with a GM was when someone reported me and they ended up teleporting in and telling me "Get down from there".
---
People who say "This happened in Vanilla too" are irrelevant. I remember running into a speedhacker running flags back then too. It happened in Vanilla, does that mean it's allowed now? Nope, neither should exploiting magically allowed all of sudden.
---
Skarm was talking about this in a vid recent. its not just DW the entire time, there will be moments during a fight where you can go dw to increase threat then swap back to sword/shield.
---
Casual by the standards of old mmorpg players.  WoW released before gaming hit the mainstream.
---
Imagine asking for changes in Classic.
---
I love how you still have auto attack bound to '1'. I have that same thing in my old screenshots for a long time after I hit 60 (I think I didn't replace it with an actual useful spell until midway through BWL). 
---
Oh, and I also played a hunter.

I've always played a hunter, and as much as I love going after rare pets, i also wonder whether or not if it's always worth it. Let's discuss broken tooth. Implying you raid as hard core as it gets, is he honestly worth it vs any other cat, despite technically having the highest attack speed, or is he more novelty than anything? Will Broken Tooth's dps bring anything life saving to the table or do people just want him because he is 'technically' the highest dps cat?
---
Great site! Unfortunately the BTag as the only option of contact means that no one can contact me before the 27th of August as I do not play any Blizzard games until that date..
---
Faction balance has never been great.  
---
Back then alliance had quite a bit of an advantage on average.  
---
Now days on modern WoW, horde has an extreme population advantage.  Not sure why this happened exactly, but I suspect horde might end up being the more populated faction in classic this time around.
---
luna is so ugly
---
Fair logic, however unless you're running alts to grind out more cash you'll probably be missing out on some easy income.
---
has to be undead, favorite animations
---
can't be bothered with pets, played lock for the longest
---
really was leaning towards spriest but don't want to be a black sheep
---
narrowing it down to mage which has the best QOL when it comes to pve and pvp to me
---
I don't get why this community has a hard time accepting that people who actually played during the real vanilla time frame have more valuable feedback to give than players who started at a later date. It's not about playing early or being a long time fan. It's supposed to be about finding bugs. Obviously someone who started the game in wrath has no clue what vanilla is supposed to be like.
---
This was one of the only movies I had on VHS as a kid, watched it so much that when I was bored at school I would run through the movie in my head, scene by scene line by line.
---
It is the most OP racial though.
---
Couldn't they theoretically put up a slanted wall? As such / Afaik you can't jump up slanted walls. But I do remember something about mounting, dismounting, jumping, mounting etc.
---
Well, it was always massively imbalanced back then anyway, so it isn't like it will be anything new. 
---
There is a reason PvE servers were more popular by the end of vanilla.  It is not fun being on the side that is outnumbered 2 to 1 on a PvP server, and people are going to be reminded of this a few months after release.
---
I have a 144hz IPS monitor, the IPS latency isn't really an issue with the modern panels. They're just expensive unfortunately.
---
Well you're in luck because Blood Elves aren't in Classic. They were introduced in BC.
---

---
Source then please. As i've been trying to find information since classic was announced and haven't seen anything concrete.  
---
Lets also face it there will be demand and blizzard won't say no to easy money.
---
I remember a time when video games also weren't being streamed live 24/7 and YouTube didnt exist so the only hype these games got would be a magazine article
---
Definitely check out Skarm Tank on Youtube. It looks like the Feral tank situation on private servers is such that you can be pretty competitive for a lot of bosses in terms of threat generation (if you farm Manual Crowd Pummelers), but you will take more damage than a Warrior. So for progression a Warrior is almost always going to be the better choice.
---
You'll probably have to farm these if you want to be the best Feral tank possible, so keep that in mind.

Hello there! I am looking for information on where I could start and learn how to make games. could you help me out and tell me how you got started, what it took to get into it?  I am trying to get every bit of information I can so I know what I am looking forward to. 
---
I appreciate wow (classic and vanilla) for how well they made the gameplay as well!
---
Horde was always winning most bg's, so I am not sure why you think the alliance had the advantage.
---
It was very well known/accepted that the only thing alliance had an advantage in, was AV, and only because of the bridge.
---
Dragostea din tei!
---
The Assassination of Dirtyauction by the Coward Skivie Ford.
---
Yea... it is funny to see some people claiming alliance had some kind of advantage over horde, when in reality alliance was the punching bag in every situation but in AV.
---
WoW is a singleplayer game if you want it to be? that's his prerogative. Also reread my post, I acknowledged that he didn't give him credit, maybe he didn't like being bugged and insulted by the mage.
---
Weird post for a warrior thread but yes, broken tooth is just cool because it's a little different. The actual effect vs just a normal tiger would be like +3% extra push back in PvP, it really makes no difference at all.
---
The issue will stem from how individual servers will like be imbalanced over time.  
---
When vanilla launched, it didn't feel like the imbalance was too noticeable, but after about 4~ months it became clear which side had the advantage on your server in regards to population.
---
Accurate. Except its classic Reddit for me before I can fully open eyes..
---
shout out to the murloc village
---
Right there with you. I have limited time for games these days, if I'm going to commit the time to play, I don't want to spend it on a beta. Let someone else ring it out. I don't care. I just don't want to private server again.
---
In combat?
---
Sure, but we are talking like a 70 to 30 difference with MC and BWL back then.  Horde always dominated raiding progression, and did so into BC as well.
---
While I agree they don't deserve it, they should focus on giving the players who actually played in that time beta. Beta is about feedback and those player's have pretty important feedback relative to someone who started cata and beyond.
---
They absolutely stack. An Orc Warrior with Iron Will has a 45% chance to resist stuns.
---
Yet horde always won out in progression by a land slide in vanilla raiding progression.  Guess salv wasn't quite 'that' good.
---
I saw someone saying recently that if you loop it that could kill it for you overtime. Also could be neat to just listen to ambient sounds for a bit, and then when the music kicks on it's Kreygasm

How is this criticism? You're just stating things that made WoW successful. 
---
It was pretty hard when I got into it at 15 years old, it was pretty hardcore for me too, so that's in the eye of the beholder.
---
I disagree. I like my sandboxes to be single player and prefer massively multiplayer online games to have rules and limits.
---
I disagree. If you decide to use strength items only on your mage, then you're fucking up, and you're also free to fuck up in the talent tree. Stat allocation doesn't fit with WoW's design philosophy. Classic WoW clearly isn't the game for you.
---
I can agree with this, but I can't say I particularly care.
---
I disagree. I like that I can remove myself from PvP by entering an instance where it's just me and my buddies for a while.
---
I disagree.
---
​I disagree.
---
You're still writing this massive text, but have you considered that this might not be the game for you? As you state, you never played WoW when it was current, but you tried it on a private server and I'm guessing you didn't like it. So my question is this: why are you writing this opinionated rant? Classic WoW has a very specific design philosophy in mind, and it's in direct conflict with what *you* like in an MMORPG, which is fine. All the things you like is something I dislike and wouldn't tolerate in a game. I could never play EQ or DaoC because that style simply doesn't  appeal to me. I'm finally getting my favourite game back, it has just the  right amount of hardcore elements, RPG elements and difficulty for me. 
---
&gt;I'm sure there's more, but these are the ones that came to mind right now. We're a couple of months away from the Fisher-Price Baby's First MMORPG being re-released and it being the most hardcore MMORPG on the market. To me, that's step one. Classic won't be hardcore enough.
---
Then why are you wasting your time here? You have to realize what a colossal waste of time your rant was.
---
I’m a big fan of sarcasm my friend
---
Everyone has bought 100? The mounts costs 800g a pop. Based on private server experience the supply won’t be “too large”. I had one of the unarmored mounts there were not bound and people offered me 3k for it close to the AQ release.
---
It's and RPG guys. Calm down.
---
I'm trying to recreate your math (and the math on the site you linked). 
---
Using the following definition: 
---
Upon parry, reduce current swing timer by 40% of max swing timer if: 
---
resulting remaining time &gt; 0.2\*current swing timer.
---
else: no reduction
---
Quick table:
---
current		0.2\*current	after reduction	Happens?
---
100%		20%		60%		yes
---
90%		18%		50%		yes
---
80%		16%		40%		yes
---
70%		14%		30%		yes
---
60%		12%		20%		yes
---
50%		10%		10%		yes
---
49%		9.8%		9%		no, 9%&lt;9.8%
---
So with this in mind, if your current swing timer &gt;=50% of your total, you'll get parry haste. 
---
Skipping 40% of your swing timer will result in you having 0.4 'extra attack' in the same time frame. 
---
Since there is a 50% chance that this will actually occur, I would say you get 0.2 'extra attack' per parry. 
---
I don't understand your assumption that from 60-20% remaining, the average reduction is 20%? Did I understand the definition wrong?  Sorry if this response is too late to contribute to the discussion
---
Depends on the situation. It's a crap racial vs a frost mage or a shaman.

I think only visual stuff should be  added if they add anything new. Everything else is tradh that could influence the game too much. Classic should be the wow everyone liked back then.
---
If you could stun every race 90% of the time, stuns would be OP. You can still stun 75% of the time. Stunning is very powerful. You are completely incapacitating your target. From a role playing standpoint, the guys with the tiny brains and thick skull warrior race should be able to take a punch without going unconscious. It's really not THAT OP. It's a good racial, but they aren't immune. You can stun them, just not guaranteed.
---
You shouldn't be able to faceroll in vanilla. You shouldn't be able to stun every enemy player at will. It's a fine racial that makes you choose targets and use your brain. It forces you to change strategy. You can cry and run from every orc, or you can learn your class and fight with some actual strategy instead of your preplanned rotation you read in a guide. OMG MY STUN DIDN'T WORK WTFGGFFFF BLIZZ CHANGE THE GAME!!! lol wut

Playing a Hunter in classic is what taught me to use mouselook and keybinds. I raided in EverQuest from '99 to '04 as a keyboard turning, skill clicking, first-person troglodyte... and then I had to learn the jump shot for Hunter PVP. Changed my life!
---
So let me get this straight.
---
- You didn't play it in 2004 because you knew you wouldn't like it.
---
- You decide in 2019 that you want to try it.
---
- You find out that you don't like it.
---
- You go on to ramble about how you don't like it.
---
Interesting decision making.
---
Thanks dude. Yeah I'm drunk and thought this was just a class question thread. Mad respect for y'all warriors. In BC played a holy pally and 2v2ed with my warrior cousin. Best of times.
---
Same, every time I see this picture.
---
Why would a Druid tank ever wear cloth, or not use Warden Staff? +4% to Growl is really worth the trade off?
---
play with friends, if they loose interest, switch race.
---
Do you know if he will have this attack speed in classic?
---
But why are you *here* if you never liked early WoW and worse yet, never *really* tried it, but only then to proceed and shit on it for not suiting your playstyle? I'm genuinely wondering what the fuck your thought process is.
---
I hoped it could be considered disc in 1.12 T\_T
---
But this only changed in Patch 2.4.0 (TBC)
---
I looked at this picture at instantly smiled. I’m so excited for this feeling again.
---
Darkshore is like the barrens, you need to quest in loops for it to be efficient, but if you do, it's very quick. The only issue that is that you need to know what and where all the quests are to know the best order to do them in.
---
But generally you just make 4-5 gradually expanding circles and it's time for ashenvale.
---
Never said i  used them in classic. Did get them back then jus left them in the bank.
---
I found some old friends on Outland(EU) thanks to this site! any Mirage or Apathy boys from horde side here?
---
How do ret pallies transition to tank then? I'm glad I don't plan on raiding seriously... Such a toxic community...
---
no they don't
---
downvote me more
---
Nope, others were taken down just like this post.
---
Use to play together, slowly became a game you played by yourself, now we are back to playing together again. Amazing.
---
That is why I am going in without questing addons for Classic. Hoping that the "immersion" addon from live gets a classic version.
---
Same here. I started playing early Wrath, pre-dungeon finder. I don't know how different the leveling is from 1.12 to early Wrath, but I feel like I've already experienced most of the things that beta testers are praising, like; the feeling of character progression you get from upgrading your shitty gear, non-linearity of quests, old talent trees, having to be careful around mobs etc. Obviously there weren't as many people leveling at once when I played, so interactions with other players were limited. That is what I am looking most forward to with classic. But even then, I do actually remember joining a group for SM through zone chat and us getting there manually to summon the other players all the while advertising in chat to fill all the spots.

---
&gt;i feal that people dint realy like the movie very much.
---
People didn't dislike it much either. It kind of got a resounding 'meh' from the general audience, which is fair. 
---
I do think it failed at launching a film franchise. There was an opportunity to build something memorable but we got something that was kind of clumsy and didn't have a feeling of 'truth' like the LOTR or GoT films had with their amazing character writing and actors. My nightmare prior to release was that it would share the same problems that the D&amp;D film had and, unfortunately, in a few ways it did. Casting wasn't great. Pacing felt herky jerky. Story was just okay. A big world was made to feel sort of small. For these reasons, it did not bring in enough revenue to justify a sequel and in that manner it failed.
---
I feel like more than half of players don’t regularly do any pvp at max level. It’s not unusual at all to ignore it.
---
Fair enough. That’s more a function of a shitty choice by the mods than haters though.
---
getting m 8/8 felheart and nemesis was my shining accomplishment. always thought plagueheart was kinda lame

It was like this even in TBC.  They didn't expand the viewing range until wrath.

I agree. I'm not reading speedrun guides. Not worrying about best racials. I'm going to play what I want. I'm going to read quests, find my way, maybe get lost once or twice. I'll figure it out, or group with someone.

Yea, druids always needed to run outside first.
---
Sick because the day before I grinded 13 hours straight trying to hit 60 before my guild ran MC that week (TBC was less then 2 months away, so wanted to see as much endgame content as I could). It was prob just a random cold, but I still maintain that all-day grind did it.
---
This comment is funnier than the screenshot itself.
---
I’m patient and can wait for release, but they actually do need to beta test it for two reasons:
---
1. The game is recreated out of the original code. It uses a modern engine, and there will be unintentional bugs from the transfer
---
2. Publicity. The beta test is giving a crap tonne of publicity out to this game, and it’s exactly what it needs. Best way to develop a thriving player base.
---
If I recall that's the case. You can get the beta without a sub but need a sub to login. Could be wrong ofc
---
HAHA ur so right XD imagine thinking being srs is fun xD 15 year old dragon pixels lmao DAE hate autists XD
---
Faction over friends honestly. Its your life, your choice, play what you want. Specially if they may leave later on, than what? You ll be stuck with filthy horde
---
Its pretty clearly a popularity contest. They don't even have any of the top horde premade in.
---
Sure, I'll play it. 
---
Until I've done the quests, which knowing blizz will take a couple hours to complete, but they'll be timegated with precision to make sure you stay subbed for more than one month. So instead I'll just wait until all the timegates are gone, sub for one month, do all the content, and then go back to real WoW.
---
But it was a factor in balancing. If it changes, classes should be rebalanced. And it shouldn't change
---
Fire resistance is no problem, Blizzard intentionally put in plenty of tanky fire resistance gear for druids. Fears are also not a problem since you can just use fear wards or tremor totems. Crits are also usually not a problem since you have a significantly bigger health pool than a warrior.
---
I feel this on a spiritual level
---
AH sniping
---
Since missing a taunt will probably make the raid wipe at 4hm, you need all the spell hit you can get
---
The expense is the thing. If I could get an IPS 144hz I would, but at that price I'd just start building a new PC.
---
Alliance
---
With Legion, it was removed from the game entirely. You now pick which spec you want to be and it gives you the myriad of spells specific for that spec. Action bars are separate across all two/three/four specs.
---
It's not a hassle. Instead of thinking of them as ranks, think of them as different spells, like a lesser lesser healing wave. You'll only ever use maybe 2-3 different ranks per spell. All those bloated smart AOE healing spells you have on retail that play the game for you don't exist so you can use those buttons.
---
I don't know the exact criteria, but it usually involves not looking like the Michelin Man.
---
People really went to extreme lengths for fashion in that game.

I’ll fill much more accomplished than when I was 15 dinging 60 while killing orcs in burning steepes. Will probably ding the same way but With having a life now I’ll probably appreciate it more
---
Some people never will
---
Comparing Hardiness to anything else is stupid. Its absolutely the most powerful racial in the game. 
---
Its an RPG idea that doesn't really work in a fun way in MMO. Its why they changed it to reduced stun duration. If your class can be an Orc and you didn't roll one, you fucked up.
---
Its not too late to complain, we are in beta for a reason
---
But even if a culture has put an emphisis on people being attractive when they're fat, it obviously hasn't stuck around for a reason. It couldn't last without the artificial support from the culture around it. 
---
You know what has stuck around since mankind's inception across ALL cultures? Healthy looking bodies being attractive.
---
I don’t know about you guys but I clicked every option

Unless you have an AH alt to make you money I would stick with herbalism.

What you quoted of me...I was referring to Inner Focus, not Inner Fire. Just now realized both abbreviate to "IF".
---
Luckily allies have no shaman!
---
Gasp!
---
China steal an IP!?!
---
Ill do a bunch of the southern quests in Darkshore until I’m about 15ish, go get questing for Deadmines and then make my way to Duskwood which is good for items and upgrades and a generally better questing experience
---
Let me tell you why I'm glad Vanilla won't have shared tags. Two major reasons as it stands right now, actually.
---
1.  I was just questing in Ghostlands in retail earlier today.  There was a monk that showed up and started doing the same quest as me. We needed to collect hearts from zombies. We are sitting there, killing them, and no talking. No party invite. No interaction because there was no need. 
---
2. If we have shared mob tags, we will need personal loot. It doesn't work otherwise. And personal loot has no place in Vanilla, even if shared tags might.
---
I was always desperate to get a beta invite and once I got one in BFA it’s like there isn’t really anything exciting about it. I get the appeal of playing in streamer run activities you can only watch atm but there will be a plethora of opportunities to do those after release. If you want to play vanilla and ‘get ready’ just install a private server.
---
&gt;unless they add something tangible to the party.
---
What if they want a community of competent players?
---
No one wants to hang out with someone who's completely fucking inept. Join a random club for any sport and see how long you get to stick around in the team when you play like shit. Doesn't mean they don't have a good community.
---
I've seen one set of screen shots on here indicting that but no other evidence. 
---
My theory is that they were invited like the day before there sub expired.
---
Yeah, once warlocks get good hit gear, their damage is smoothed out instead of being extremely hit or miss. Warlocks get so many multiplicative bonuses that they pull ahead of mages. Each additional mage is an additive bonus to the ignite exploit whereas each additional warlock gets a larger bonus from curse of shadows, shadow weaving, and improved shadow bolt.
---
Give warlocks threat reduction blessings from paladins and watch the bosses weep.
---
For real, reciprocity is like one of the core building blocks of any group or relationship. How these people don't understand that is beyond me.
---
1-(0.75*0.85)=0.3625
---
36.25%
---
I suggest you learn basic math before posting next time.
---
shadow priest I would say. reckoning/heal paladin is really strong and in general a good rogue is strong. (Some heroes might even consider mages) So 1. SHP (long time nothing) 2. recko/heal paladin 3. rogues 4. mage
---
It's additive, not multiplicative, and you forgot the 5% base stun resist. Dick nugget.
---
HUG LEFT
---
Wow... It seems like the vast majority of the player base don't even know what a beta is for... They all talk about it isn't worth it because characters won't last or that it is just like a demo. In that case those players who just wanna play and don't want to contribute, really don't deserve a beta invite.
---
BUT MAH FEAR WARD   /s
---
Re: playing. Haven't entirely decided, but currently leaning no. A lot of what I liked about WoW in the early days had to do with novelty and community, neither of which can be recreated simply by returning to an earlier patch. And to the extent that there are things in the original game that I wouldn't mind revisiting... they're mostly not the things at the beginning of the game, and I'm not sure I feel like grinding through the tedious parts to get to them.
---
Re: Spreadsheet. Probably not. Honestly, the theory part of vanilla was never really that interesting - the mechanics were all simple enough and lacking in significant feedback loops that you barely even needed a sheet for it (in point of fact, a lot of my earliest theorycraft was done with pencil and paper while bored at work). The hardest part of it would be remembering (or re-figuring-out) all the mechanics from back in the day, and even assuming I did play, that's definitely not the part of the game I'd want to spend time on.
---
And yeah, I was in Union for a while in TBC. Vanilla was Pantheon and Monarchy (and Drunken Monkeys, in the pre-raiding days). The name Shadowstryke definitely rings a bell - not sure I could've come up with it on my own, but now that you mention it it does sound familiar. IIRC you were a couple of bosses behind Pantheon during Naxx, although we considered Union to be our bigger rivals at the time.
---
Overall: I appreciate the shoutout, and it has been fun remembering the good ol' days with the buzz around Classic; but I think overall I'm probably better off leaving those days in the rose-tinted realm of memory than trying to recreate them to any extent. Honestly, I'd be more interested in reconnecting with some of the people from back in the day (who, in retrospect, I wish I'd done a better job of keeping in touch with) than with the game itself.
---
So I'd like to go 2h fury in PvE (Horde). Is there some compendium/guide for itemisation and/or playstyle? The gearing for 2h might be somewhat different from dualwield (e.g. hitchance) I guess.
---
Lowered respec cost
---
A special bag for the bullets that doesn’t take places with your actuals bags
---
2004 perspective from a player that didn't play back then. Awesome.
---
its as simple or as difficult as you make it.
---
you can bind the low rank spell to 'X' for example,
---
because you'll be using it the most.
---
and if you want to cast the max rank, you can make a macro or a separate keybind for ctrl+X, or shift+x , or whatever you want.
---
or you can bind rank 3,4,5,6,etc to diff keys, up to you.
---
I don't think that's the case. For your first assertion, I'll argue that I replay games like KotOR 2 and Fable every couple of years, and it's always about the journey there. They don't have any endgame to speak of, I still enjoy the hell out of them and they sure as hell aren't new. Classic will be the same for me. 
---
For the second assertion, BfA has made it fundamentally impossible to enjoy the journey because it is at its core a bad game. The questing was made worse in Cata, the newer zones all make it feel like you're always rushing somewhere, there's no difficulty to speak of, classes play like ass, and there's no sense of progression.
---
For a game like BfA, all there is is endgame. And guess what, M+, raiding, and PvP are ALL results-based activities that involve multiple people.
---
This please! Everyone advertising at the moment seems to be hardcore raiding guilds. I'm looking to get involved with a guild now but probably won't get to raid! Happy to be involved with setting something up in EU region.
---
That and Ebn is legit just a better Druid. His videos are what made me decide on maining a Druid. Dude is nutty.
---
Resorting to insults because you know you don't have a point.
---
Nice.
---
also I love how this guy totally missed the memo that blizzard said they weren't using the 1.12 patch when it came to mounts. I know for a fact blizzard said they were following a different patch when it came to mounts because by 1.12 the mount system was changed in prep for tbc and blizzArd said it wasn't an authentic mount experience people remember from vanilla. 
---
So his argument doesn't make any sense to begin with since blizzard themselves literally said that the mount system won't follow 1.12. it's honestly dumb that you can't buy unarmored mounts it's such a small thing lol
---
If you can climb mountains again with levitate, easy choice
---
5% + 25% + 15% = 45%
---
That's my point.
---
Any decent google search will point you to the fact that stun resist is additive and not multiplicative.
---
Planning to play a druid and not looking forward to the 100's of gold I'm gonna be dumping into respecs ;\_;
---
No Oceanic servers for maximum "no changes" :(
---
Just a sub, with it you have access to both Classic and retail (except bfa content).
---
Certainly is. A high fps isn't as important in MMOs. It's nice to have bright vibrant colors too! Makes you feel more immersed.
---
I like it! that would be nice.
---
True that, lol Spec switching can be a pain
---
Some sort of social looking for group. Now not anything anywhere near the god awful thing on live but more than just a spamable world chat. Maybe a bit like the /who page where you could flag yourself as wanting to run LBRS or something or you could see groups forming for the instance you want and whisper them. Really just tidy up a bit. But defo none of this iLvl or god forbid raider io we have now.
---
Guild Banks. There's absolutely no argument against them and once Blizzard remembers all the account sharing amongst guildmates, they're going to add them.
---
You cannot pre-sac though right?
---
T2 Paladins
---
Soda has been preparing for the event for like 3 days straight, lets see if he overprepared or not.
---
Seems possible. I played some of the stress test but I feel like if I had the beta I'd be burnt out by August.
---
He's off about a ton of things. Listening to this guy is going to be problematic for a lot of people. I've already seen tons of posts from people talking about tanking while Fury spec "no problem." Everything works in theory. They are in for a rude awakening when they realize how big a difference a fully naxx geared warrior is vs a half blues half greens level 60 in UBRS.
---
By the way, you wouldn't have a MoP account. Things got changed a while back. A sub gets you access to the entire game minus the current expansion (BfA).
---
So happy I found this!
---
Iv been looking for something exactly like this in doing research before starting classic!
---
Giving maybe 2-3 examples of the pre BiS items might be something good to add too!
---
Saving this post to keep checking back for when you might launch this for real!
---
There will be an addon for this, we're developing it. It works much like the original LFG did in the pre-TBC patch.
---
Wouldn't you want to smelt the ore to help level mining to match your level/zone?
---
 I guess if you don't and just level it by mining nodes you could collect alot of ore.
---
Sounds good. What timezone?
---
An actual 'background' economy. I made that term up, but essentially it would be using all the gold sinks that players spend (repair costs, bank tabs, auction house fees etc.), and putting them into some form of benefit or reward program.
---
Say for example this week your whole faction spent a total of 10,000 gold worth of repair costs and maybe auction house fees. The following week that accumulated gold can be put into slightly increased quest gold rewards for everyone (it will be an automatic system that calculates how much gold you can earn extra), or maybe a simple NPC which you could talk to and get a small gift or gold reward.
---
It's not a game-breaking system, but I think it's an interesting idea to implement into the game which would make all those AH fees and repair costs mean something. In fact, I don't think any other game utilizes such a mechanic, to put a fraction of the player spent gold back into the people's pockets.
---
1. **Updated graphics. Yes** Yeah graphics should be an optional, client side toggle. No need to make everyone count the polygons on their fingers
---
2. **Dual spec. No** You had an identity in spec. Your talents were what your character *did*. If you want to change that around, fine, it should come at great cost. Changing talents willy nilly with no serious drawbacks is a detriment to Classic. You need to design the game around making decisions matter.
---
3. **Class rebalance. Tread carefully**  If this happens, it needs to happen only once ever. It needs to be Phase 7. It needs to be tested extensively. It needs to be advertised and forewarned to the player base ~~months~~ weeks in advance, with finalized numbers. The Classic meta should sit. It should not be a carousel of Flavor of the Month specs. That works in modern WoW where you can realistically keep one of each class geared up and ready to move into the roster after buffs come out. Not in Classic.
---
thats in vanilla, meeting stones
---
It’s cool, but removes some of  the identity of your character. People will remember you with specific hairstyles, if you play with the helmet off.
---
!remindme 76 days
---
I've reported it as a bug (here on Reddit in the bug thread, as I don't have beta access). I've brought up the problem everywhere I could. I can't do more.
---
Do you by chance have the email address of one of the developers? :)
---
Really depends on market conditions. A lot of post here aren't considering the server populations are going to be high and many people will probably go duel gathering for ez money, this could make herb prices favourable for this plan. 
---
Short answer. Have to wait and see.
---
karazhan as lvl 60 20man raid
---
Swamp of Sorrows or Deadwind Pass, easy.
---
damn u right
---
Sounds good to me.
---
I was pretty bad about my hotkeys until WotLK. I was like.. 14/15? I was and still am a holy pally. I thought I was being clever by making my heals hotkeys but when leveling I put whatever spells wherever they happened to go on the bars as I learned them. So at 60 I still had seals on 1, 2, 3 so I made my Flash of Light and Holy Light [ and ].
---
Yep I would move my left hand over to the right side of my keyboard to heal and mostly move using LMB+RMB or move my hand back to WASD. I did this until like Ulduar and I was actually a decent healer.
---
A friend jumped on my account to run something when I wasn't there and said my hot keys ended up being weird and it was probably because of our different addons.
---
I changed everything to 1,2,3,4 etc a week later. Can't believe how long I did that for. I didn't even switch to mouseover macros until like WoD.
---
The amount of damage from a Crushing blow is severe. You never want to take one of those. It's spike damage that is compounded by the fact that druids don't have their own recovery reaction abilities like Last Stand and Shield Wall. Not easy to brush that off with "higher hp, it'll be okay."
---
HI dude, im struggling with the same problem. Here are my thoughts:
---
1. Shadow does not provide anything useful pre lvl 40. Except may be mind flay, which is useful only for PVP situations, and is really bad for pve against mobs, since it is not very mana effecient , compared to a wand dmg.
---
2. Discipline provides infinite mana regen, so its a super good thing to have. However, when playing duo, you will have much more time for mana regen, since you killing mobs faster, so you'll have enough mana.
---
3. Holy provides the best dps out of all three specs early on, -0.5 sec on all holy damaging spells, +5% crit, and +10% damage on all holy spells. Which makes it the best for killing speed. And since you have enough mana when playing duo, i'd say holy will be the best option, and discipline will be the best for solo leveling.
---
Yeah and change meeting stones to summoning stones while we're at it.
---
I enjoy small things that make the game more immersive. I'd like to see my character turn its head when I target mob/player or if my character would open the map scroll with its hands whenever I open map.
---
In some cases, yes. It all depends on the herb and what potion/flask you make with it. For example on a low level scale. Minor health potions are going to be worth less on the AH than the mats that it costs to make one. 
---
Another example at a high level, a flask that is low in demand like maybe the spirit one compared to some of the more generally powerful ones, will probably cost more to make with the mats than it would to buy ones, especially for the cost of a very valuable black-lotus, which could have been used for a "better" higher value/higher demand flask.
---
Nah orcs are cool, I'm planning to do pvp and pve but my heart is always in pvp in every game I play. Thanks for answering.
---
wait, so the barber just breaks his jaw and gets paid for it? cool, i want that profesion
---
We're capitalists, not socialists. Get your universal basic income ideas out of here.
---
They should just re-implement Dual Spec with the original 1000g cost.
---
Those fees are designed to control inflation. A job which live gave up on some time ago.
---
Yeah, I meant the cards. Poopsockers/mafia guys are likely going to be able to get at least a dozen mounts or so, if it's worth doing.
---
Point is that I don't see how it's a "huge red flag for the economy". It's not like ticket scalping where there is a limited supply to take from people who then have to pay extremely high prices.
---
The mounts cost 800g no matter what happens - if anything, big boys spending all their gold (and removing it from the economy) on to-be-discontinued mounts should benefit the average player positively in terms of buying power.
---
That‘s not vanilla....
---
Right with ya there!
---
Thanks for a more detailed answer, I'll prolly do Orc hunter and then make a Tauren sham or something later on. That stun resist is too good to pass up for pvp.
---
sorry you arent able to approach wow with the right mindset. it could be the social nature of the game that makes you feel rushed and competitive. people do alter the experience quite a bit. i played classic and many people played it then the same way you claim bfa is played now, always rushing somewhere. if you liked the old questing style, outland and northrend are all still intact pre-cata style questing zones. nothing about retail wow necessitates that you be the best. hell, i spent the other night stealthing to boralus on my undead rogue, fishing in the pond behind their fishing trainer. i met a funny tauren paladin who was stranded on a roof in town. we teamed up, and then got into some world pvp with this rogue who wouldnt let me fish and kept throwing darts at me. the urgency you feel in bfa will translate to classic after a while too. i have felt it too, believe me, and thats when i know i need to step away, because it really does make the game less fun. but thats on my end. the core gameplay itself has not changed dramatically over the years. the visceral anger of “bfa is garbage” rhetoric is user error, not a flaw in the game design. blizz always tries to make something new and cool for an expansion, but even if it falls flat for some people, as warfronts, islands, and the garrison have fallen flat for some, the core game play is all still there. you can grind, craft, level, explore, farm, quest, etc. i have tried and tried to make a dent in all the secrets and rare stuff that i want to see and get in wow, and im still nowhere near. i always get distracted and end up picking flowers or leveling cooking on yet another alt. but oh well, its still fun.
---
Represents his future with Sylvanas
---
I believe they will, they've said that the AQ event will be returning so no reason why the Scourge Invasion won't either :)
---
That's funny, the only thing that comes up is a discussion from 2006 that says they're resisting "a lot" and someone more knowledgeable posting on barrens.chat saying they're stacking multiplicatively.
---
Please shower me more with the knowledge that you're pulling out of your ass. What's next, will you keep insulting me without providing any proof to the claims you provide?
---
I created a D3 work guild and connected with quite a few on bnet. Only one still works at the company though and he doesn't play wow. Even if he caught me on, I'd just say..."well what were you doing on bnet". So not worried.
---
I'm not defending retail's blatant flaws, but I'm also not naive.
---
Classic's community is probably going to end up toxic and full of those unwilling to recognize or care about other people/players unless those players benefit them in some way. You'll see a bunch of guilds doing their thing internally and probably not doing much else outside of world pvp with other major guilds or flaunting the rewards of their time investment in cities.
---
Beyond that, the world will eventually be as dead as retail's is.
---
Millions played Vanilla. Blizzard needs only a few thousand testers (and even that can be too much, they have to vet all bug submissions). Even if someone have been playing since the original beta they'll have a very small chance to get in. It's just the nature of the thing.
---
I was Snecaras in Discordia.  There was a few ex-wc3 pros in the guild, that's how I ended up there.  I haven't stayed in touch with many people from the old days though unfortunately.
---
Private server are the closest thing we have to classic at the moment at high level. Yes a fe thing are off but it shouldn't change the meta by that much. Also considering that boss damage are often buffed in private server, druid should be able to survive in classic.
---
Increased parry and parry haste also doesn't affect druid as much as warrior.
---
I had to chuckle at this. I cant wait for the whinge fest at how hard it will be to get gold

Here is a Blizzard dev of vanilla WoW talking about how vanilla WoW indeed had dynamic respawns since week 1 of the games existence, in every single area. It was always 100% impossible to ever run out of mob spawns in ANY area of the game. The faster mobs in an area would get killed, the faster they would respawn to ensure there is always something to kill.
---
Pretty good PvP for its time, but by today's standards its a bit... eh. Didn't see a lot of offensive dispels, put it that way lol.
---
Mulgore. Too green and the mob density is too high. If I wanted to look at a field, I'd walk a few miles.
---
I don't believe that is what they want. They specifically said that they use metrics such as time subscribed to choose the participants. I really doubt that they want noobs in the beta. That being said, they probably also don't care for valuable feedback so who knows.
---
Druid is actually the best Ragnaros tank, because you can feral charge the knock back (don't need to stance dance like a warrior to do this, and cool down on feral charge is shorter), if charge don't work you can turn into cat to avoid the fall damage. And it's a resist fight and druid often do better on these.
---
In AQ40 the only boss you shouldn't tank as a druid are huhuan (need shield wall for the 20% phase, you can still offtank it fine if you do the 2 tank strat tho) and Viscidius (reduced damage by 50% affect druid threat alot more than war threat and you will be needed to remove poison anyway)
---
Most of this is pretty trash and you sound like an idiot when you throw around "Fisher-Price Baby's first MMO". Yes, it was more casual compared to something like Everquest at the time but I think vanilla WoW hits a perfect balance and you seem to miss a lot of obvious things about it. 
---
Yes, you can solo a lot of quests but throughout the game you are incentivized to group up and in fact it's often preferrable to duo level with someone because it can be as fast, if not faster, you can tackle elite quests that you couldn't solo but if you didn't split xp and just ran with 5 people everywhere, leveling would be a total cakewalk yet you're complaining about something being casual. LOL
---
Strong disagree about instanced dungeons, I'm perfectly fine with that and we're just going to disagree, it would be impossible to have a world first race type of thing if the opposing faction on your server could just form a raid and camp you anytime into your 200th pull on Kel'Thuzad or whatever. 
---
Corpse looting doesn't make much sense in a loot driven MMO. You can't have people looting Thunderfury off of someone because they managed to kill them. 
---
Sandbox MMOs tend to be crap. I wouldn't mind the idea of allocating stats for classes, I would generally like this to be more difficult, and I would like a more meaningful crafting system but otherwise I disagree with most of these.
---
There is already a Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
Due to the highly demanding gold cost of raiding for warriors, any idea how the gold selling market might look come a month or two into classic? Have a great job, and can make time to raid and gear, but not necessarily farm for gold
---
Taxes are not how you control inflation. Beyond limiting how much gold can be on a server at one time, there’s really nothing Blizzard can do.
---
you actually share loot with every heal class, not the set items ofcourse but set items in classic are for the most part not the best item you can get. and yes palas/shamans/druids all can and will wear cloth. there is no benefit for wearing your max armor tier
---
WoW is CLEARLY a themepark, it has always been. It's nothing like EVE, Star Wars Galaxies or whatever. To engage in the vast majority of content you have to go out and kill mobs and level up while generally following their progression path. You can deviate and grind mobs opposed to questing, do dungeons but it's not like you can be a level 1 master crafter that never engages in combat.
---
The only boss a druid shouldn't tank in BWL is nefarian because you will get randomly turned into cat. Chrommagus is also pretty bad for druid but doable.
---
On every other boss a druid is good and actually better on most (firemaw with fire resist gear, bloodlord because druid can tank the mortal strike better, on vael and the other two small dragon only threat matter and druid can do more).
---
War games for bgs / arena. No ladder or rewards or anything, just a way to deliberately fight against a specific group of people for fun.

I got in might one. Got through sfk and wc and logged out.
---
Only just back to it and I hit 30 tonight.
---
I leveled the class I know best, reported everything I recalled as being off or funky. 
---
I’ll probably log on tomorrow and respec maybe do bfd, gnomer Smgy.
---
After that? I’m going to wait till the 26th. I’ve played it. It’s wow, real wow. It feels good...really good. Like heroin good. I haven’t seen the sunrise from my computer chair in a couple years, i have twice now since beta.

Minus some bugs, it’s 1.12.

It's not even vanilla raiders, it's private server raiders. Toxic bunch of assholes.
---
The AQ event was needed to unlock the raid. I don't think the scourge Invasion was directly linked to Naxx opening. Thought it was just around for a limited time like the zombie plague right before Wotlk etc.
---
I really want a beta invite but if I don't get one by the 28th of this month I have super Mario maker 2 to keep me going until classic release!
---
Use your brain and press different buttons depending on the situation?
---
Taurens care
---
Wow awesome, not much more to say other than I'll definitely want to use this addon! Thank you for your hard work!
---
Doubt it. People are still leveling during phase 1. Most non hardcore levelers will need anywhere from 2-4 weeks (or even more) to reach 60. 77 days after release is imo too early.
---
\#no changes
---
a player who insists on having a suboptimal specc is a special snowflake and will create drama in one way or another.

for the greater good of 39+ people you dont take one. that simple
---
The maintank of my guild is fury and dualwield tank sometimes, but he only does about as much TPS as my bear without MCP. If i use a MCP there is no contest.
---
&gt; its completely possible to approach bfa with the attitude on the left and enjoy the game immensely.
---
You have to go out of ur way to do this, which takes alot of effort, and as soon as u stop making that effort, just like a muscle, it will slowly fall apart. Classic forced a community, which means it organically created a social aspect because relying on others is a necsessity.
---
Alliance is humans + the rest.
---
Many of the vanilla quests are very vague.
---
"Northwest of X city" doesn't really mean much when you need to loot a specific, tiny object on a 10min respawn timer located on the bottom of a lake.
---
If players aren't interested in playing for quest immersion, there's absolutely nothing wrong with using an addon
---
My biggest fear as a warlock is getting a void walker with a terrible name. Tangthang is an awesome name!
---
And frenzied regeneration.
---
uhh what does he look like now? 
---
everyone here clearly plays bfa because no pics linked of his face now? lol
---
I just want my ivory raptor back
---
Well #nochanges will always win over #changes. They're not going to change the game now that it's even more authentic than it used to be before we preassured them into spell batching.
---
came here for the video.... left disappointed :-(
---
Yeah? Wierd. What you describe didn’t happen in 13 years of private servers.
---
Thanks for mentioning this, I will fix this soon. Pm your char name and I will edit it manually.
---
"randomly turned into cat."
---
Weird, druids should be immune to polymorph effects while in animal forms.
---
Thanks guys, got it.
---
And i see what they changed well it makes sense, i remember playing cata and i had to pay on 3 more expacs
---
Anyways so locks - people will die for the summoning stones right?
---
I meant small GM events. I remember the GM's doing a few in vanilla closed beta, always fun and got the server together.
---
Love how it has nostalrius on there, but no one seems to be using it for nost. :(
---
Dont go dwarf.  Its annoying to get out of shadowform to pop fw and get back into shadowform.  You need all the mana you can get.  You want to get into a guild because you are a good shadow priest, not because youre a dwarf. Im just guessing most players havent tried a dwarf sp and dont have firsthand experience.
---
This is actually one I'm against. Part of what made vanilla so great is that you had to travel the world. It gives chances for dynamic encounters to occur. These types of QOL changes are what lead to what we have in retail now.
---
Thousand Needles. What is that shit? Just look at it, dead, gray and beige and just ugly.
---
Fuck you its classic
---
Thats a Drake standing on two legs!!!
---
The fact that many conservatives have this mindset is why humanity is fucked
---
There is a weekly thread for this
---
I don’t know a single name on this list and this makes me extremely happy
---
Didn't even apply for the beta. Release is going to be the first time I see the Barrens after so many years and it's going to be glorious.
---
Let me fix that:
---
„sorry you aren’t able to trick your brain into pretending certain aspects of bfa are great while they are actually horrible“
---
There, got it.
---
Why not both?
---
Feral tank or DPS?

This really does suck. How much does it get up too? 50G?

For what? This complete question?

Stop trying to fix classic. Where do we even stop? We fix one thing and then some other idiot comes with the plan of changing something else. Doesn't matter how small it is, it will just get worse over time and we'll see classic turn into retail fairly quickly. Don't like the server? Reroll on another.
---
I was Snecaras in Discordia. There was a bunch of us competitive wc3 players. I remember tazz was one, I was there also. I know a few other WizZ people were there but names escape me, it's been so long.
---
Been wracking my brain... demi-god, jaden-craft, varione (3-13-03 or something like that iirc), cheesy-craft, zA.Dricen, andross, Hypno.Toad... more I probably forgot.
---
Because I only have time to lvl one and i should choose one tot start with
---
Tank
---
Nah knowing blizz they will probably time gate all the quests to prolong the content.
---
Yes
---
In the real world money spent in the economy circulates minus the tax. In wow any NPC transaction is tax. Buy food and water? Tax. Put an item on AH? Tax. Respec? Tax. All these transactions delete the currency and only killing mobs introduces more. Your right it's not perfect, there's no one controling the total amount of currency or activily adjusting taxes and interest rates but it does slow inflation. Having more than a few thousand gold in classic was impressive. Now if you've got less that a few 100k you're basically poor.
---
&gt; I haven’t seen the sunrise from my computer chair in a couple years, i have twice now since beta. 
---
Beautiful
---
;_;
---
Then ho with Warlock since it is faster to level viable in pve and pvp and you get a free lvl 40 mount.
---
All the tears in this thread will make the faster and faster dropping player population of retail even sweeter once classic is out
---
Make another Battle.NET account and contact them that way. Or maybe tweet @BlizzardCS.
---
I agree with you that single-realm BGs had a greater sense of community. Don't know we can fix this problem tho.
---
your realm is dead....you sit there twiddling your thumbs while you wait for your server only to have enough people to join a BG...you die of old age.
---
Yeah unless he gives his employees a huge amount of PTO, that sounds awful. I'd avoid taking vacation days because what if I get sick later and I'd avoid taking sick days because what if I want to take a vacation later?
---
Mage, most utility, better dps, more CC and fairly easy to level. Free food, do I need say more?
---
I know what you meant. That’s why I “added” to your argument that it’s not even Trumps doing that the economy is still fine.
---
There is a 0/30/21 spec that you can do and never have to respec. You just need to carry two sets of gear/consumables.
---
What about perplexity? He wont participate?
---
?
---
Yep 50g is the max
---
Yes, 50g one direction. So if you respec for PVP, then switch back to your raid spec, that's 100g.
---
And their crowd control in pvp?
---
That’s because a good portion of this subreddit has never actually played classic they’ve just heard enough about it to make it seem like they have.
---
With that being said a beta invite to them would be like a whole new game so they want to experience it as quickly as possible whereas people who are more experienced with classic know what to expect and are generally more patient than the ones who haven’t.
---
MANY COPS! RIGHT SIDE! EVEN SIDE! 
---
*sirens*
---
FUUUUUUUUCK!!!
---
Alright, that makes much more sense. No worries these things happen to all of us :)
---
True. Summoning stones did require two of you tho. Waiting for all five sometimes takes longer than the instance. Was a compromise. The current all ported in thing is garbage, definitely.
---
Haha yeah that is mage :) but i’m afraid everyone will start as a mage.
---
IIRC, the meeting stones just throw anyone who touches them into a group. Your group might end up consisting of four rogues and a hunter.
---
PvP?
---
better have your old bitcoin wallet on there too
---
Nah
---
So the entire patch for you is just quests or am i mssing something??
---
It’s Horde only.
---
Still good enough.
---
But it looks like you are looking for a superman class. In that case i would say try to play retail.
---
You wont find a class that is good with everything and honestly pvp has much more to do with skill than with class.
---
Pala Prot are godlike in 5 man ( if you know how to play )
---
Warrior Prot are godlike in Raid ( still if you know how to play, pressing taunt like a monkey isn't enough )
---
Huge problems as Pala Prot are : Lack of Taunt* and Lack of Gear**
---
* This speak for itself, even if atm there is some cluncky theory that the spellbatching trick for ProActive Procs ( Redoubt / Recko ) could help gaining tons of TPS
---
** There are literally no gear with DEF INT STR SPELL POWER you have to cherry pick and poaching from Warriors.
---
Also tier sets are made for not begin Prot Pala sets.
---
So it will be hard to get a perfectly balanced gear and you will for sure ends up not having DEFENSE capped, which will make you susceptible to crits
---
BUT this in a 5 man or 10 man can be still worth for the Redoubt/Reckoning combo.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. I played lock in vanilla and the mount wasn't free, it was damn close to 700g and you had to do a long and shitty quest line in order to get the mount.
---
1) repair costs can go big way but ye depending how much help you get from guild it can be a lot easier.
---
2) Ehm honestly i've never been in a group which didnt require every fury to have at least 1 set of gear for oting. Might be different with guilds but my personal experience is even if you dont tank you still need it.
---
3) /sit i think is still in talk wether it should work or not so i guess we'Ll have to wait and see what blizzard decides with it.
---
4) No. On this i simply have to say otherwise. Warriors with pre-raid bis are just not great. You literally don't have the base hp pool to survive the initial rotations while you are cc'd to death.
---
5) Yep but i think that's a bit over the top
---
6) Again you can even play warrior / druid it's just not nearly as efficent as warri/hsman and warr/pala.
---
Also gearing palas are easy since they can use any type of armor just like your warrior. If you don't plan on making a prot pala you literally can strap any leather/cloth with offensive stats on him so don't really need to share much. Also palas get nice Q weps.
---
Also this post was meant for new ppl to get just a general idea on what to expect withouth the "play what you want for pHuN" disillusion :P
---
You are fuckin retarded, the first stat squish did NOTHING, because blizzard is so fuckin retarded, thats the reason they had to make a second one you miserable dumb cunt.
---
Why am i spending my time with a cunt like your self who is at 400 karma 5 fuckin years later, you must be a special type of twat.
---
Yes, a network effect called "word of mouth". When something is incredibly satisfying to play, people share their experiences with their friends and it has a domino effect that leads to Blizzard shattering the combined sub numbers of all MMOs in history up to that point. 
---
I've played a lot of MMOs and the thing vanilla WoW did really well is it gave you a very satisfying sense of progression throughout the leveling process that is unmatched to any other MMO I've played. Every item upgrade felt like it mattered, money was hard to come by so everything you spent money on was a decision you had to think about, the talent system was enjoyable, the class quests, the new abilities every 2 levels. A leveling experience where you could progress soloing but it heavily incentivized playing with other people. No, it was not the most hardcore game EVAR, but most things in the game required more care, and more planning while providing the feeling of a lived in world with loads of people to interact with, and this is unavailable in most modern MMOs.
---
Started in Feb 05
---
Actively do not want beta. Eagerly awaiting launch.
---
It is true but you don't need 8 from every class. Also yes it will be true for classic as well. There is a reason why vanilla raids teems with warriors and that is because tehy are hands down the best. Also in later pathces (cough naxx) you literally need 8 Fury/T warriors EVERY raid.
---
even in tbc (or early tbc anyway) those AV's did last days.
---
It's pretty obvious that, even assuming he's telling the truth that he's played it, he went into it wanting to hate it.
---
Haha yes :) i’m always looking for the super class. It one off my problems sincd vanilla and a problem to a lot of other people to. I think I will have tot choose between big variety and baddass :)
---
This is the real thing. 
---
Why would you go out of your way to find someone who wants to play a undeniably flawed spec when you can find a rogue, mage, or warrior with less effort willing to do the same job but is better at it?
---
Might use the old cat form for reference and fix it.i  speed painted from memory to test direct color painting.Thank you for the feedback.
---
I loved all the quests there :) so bloody creepy and unique.
---
And stranglethorn vale.. loved that place so much, everytime it rained we gathered under a tree made camp and talked crap until it stopped (RP server) so much fun.
---
As a Warlock you're rolling against Mages for the same gear. 
---
Mage is a very popular class for sure, definitely top 3. If you're just focused on wPvP and BGs, Mage is probably a better choice. Warlocks are pretty great duelists, and they scale pretty hard with gear so once you have some with the right specs you're definitely a force to be reckoned with.
---
If you're an Alliance player, I'd put another tick in the mage box, as WotF is frustrating as hell to deal with. Horde typically have more Warlocks because they don't have to deal with that.
---
I did that. I was creating a random character checking for available names, got one I was super excited about and just started playing. Noticed at 15-ish and just kept going.
---
I slowfalled down from Hyjal.  I had an alt parked there from vanilla until the area was revamped in Cata.  Log in every so often and dance with the trolls.
---
They're using an addon (Leatrix) to change the range of nameplates to 80 yards. You can also achieve this with console commands (Which is what the addon does).  
---
I personally think the console command needs to be disabled and nameplates defaulted to the original value.
---
No one in my real life knows that I even know what wow is. and it will stay that way.
---
Anyone know what this is from? Im a huge seinfeld fan i feel like i should know, but im not familiar with newmans other work outside the show lol
---
It's a mixx of fury warriors OTing the spell bosses (lady and zealot)but yess 8 warriors with tank gear.
---
I thought you did it on purpose to jebait us all too.
---
If the target has a symbol (skull, cross etc) you can use something like bananabar to click on that symbol and instantly target that mob.
---
Quite useful when there's a lot of shit.
---
I don't think the must. If you want to feel like part of your server through PvP, engage in PvP in the open world. Defend an area maybe. 
---
During my Alliance leveling tests I always appreciated the level 60's just dealing with the gankers in Redridge.
---
I actually liked deadwind pass, it was eerie, hollow and bleak
---
But it was useless
---
My feeling is that they will add them at some point down the road.
---
Or, you know, just don't make a character that's ugly AF.
---
The only way you “solve” a faction imbalance is by moving the players to another realm or realms. What’s that gonna do to your beloved community?
---
Classic reddit
---
If you sit down and calculate the benefit to the group, it doesn't come close to making-up for the damage lost. (But admittedly, if I'm a caster, I want that moonkin in my group.)
---
Dustwallow Marsh. All I want is to leave when I enter.
---
Jurassic Park
---
&gt;i’m not sure about their crowd control in pvp against multible targets.
---
Mage has the same issue.
---
&gt;Is everyone going to play mage on release, what means you need to /roll 100 for armour? 
---
You'll compete with warlocks and priests.
---
Not sure how you'll make the decision based off those questions.
---
Do you enjoy using pets or casting frostbite 30k times? That answer is your class.
---
And?
---
Dwarf is the better choice. Fear Ward is just amazing in PvP. It cheeses some fights in raids, but its not necessary imo. 
---
If you hate the way Dwarves look, don't play one. However, if you don't care or you like the way they look, Dwarf racials are BiS for alliance 100%.
---
Why mods refuse to sticky anything about this site blows my mind!
---
Guildwars 2 beta taught me what this man says is true. Glad there are lots of people keen who have the way for my less buggy release experience!
---
That + flags showing on map lolol! Bfa wage here we come classic :)
---
This is vanilla, whether ppl like it or not
---
Binding target enemy player works well for that though!
---
Better to sticky this than the beta bug thread blizz won't even look at and most commenters haven't even played beta
---
Then play with other noobs and stop complaining. Bunch of whining. Your feelings are not my responsibilities.
---
Nahhhhhhhhhh.
---
They didn't have a solution either - that's why the did cross realm queues in Vanilla.
---
Would be nice if they did a couple of phases with no cross realm and then open it up after we get to suffer 30 minute queues.
---
You can change weapons in combat. Yes, for 4H 2% is worth the small armor loss.
---
I am not complaining and you do not need to take it in a negative way. I was just mentioning something that people might ignore.
---
Yup, all of the above. No point in purposely handicapping yourself and wasting gear on "fair rolls" because you wanted to take someone who's doing basically nothing for the raid.
---
People ignore it because it's not their problem.
---
Still click myself, due to physical limitations. Never has hurt my PvE performance much. I was guild top dps in BC before switching to heals for later xpacs 
---
Here's 2 recount screenshots, our first KT and Vashj kills in T5. So yea, never been worried about being a clicker.

---
Lots of conjecture there buddy.
---
You really can’t judge the in-game community by this subreddit. The people here are toxic and the release of the limited Beta has only made it worse. And I think the stress test wasn’t a good measure because people were overcrowded and had limited time. The Beta has been full of helpful chat and friendly banter for first-time Vanilla players and veterans alike.
---
This ones tough, the only argument against it I can think of is that it might lower social engagement in the guild. Rather than asking if guild mates have a resource you just go look at the guild bank.
---
But this is definitely one that sits on the edge where I could see them changing it because of the TOS violations.
---
Maybe he only has one hand, but he’s just embarrassed so he’s never told you guys.
---
Technical limit is not really a good argument though, given how we’d then for example have infinite debuff slots, just saying.
---
My plan is to lvl skinning with mining.  Save ore and stones for engineering and a bit of leather.   
---
At 60, drop skinning for enchanting, d/e all the blues I've saved up, drop that for engineering. And go from there.
---
Focus
---
Can't balance something if it's not broken.
---
This is strong, not broken.
---
The best part about classic is you do NOT have to play it, there is retail and other games :)
---
The min/max urge is too strong lol
---
The only real diff is having the higher end survivability of tauren and the extra threat of troll allowing the raid for more dps.
---
Wow. Toxic attitude right there. I would rather play with someone fresh to the game, than with you. Don't bother replying, already blocked you.
---
Listen the fuck up, you are going to DPS really fucking slow (Epic 1990s trance music in background) And watch the fucking Tail! YOu get kicked to whelps you loose 50 DKP again!
---
I actually have beta, and feel the same. Not taking it very seriously because it is only a practice run basically.
---
Looking forward to it. Thanks
---
I'd say it depends what you do more of. If you're in BGs using the likes of Mind Blast is going to OOM you extremely fast, but in duels/WPvP it's worth using because fights will be over quickly anyway. Extra armour works well to make warriors and rogues wonder why they're not doing any damage to you.
---
The infamous purple eyed one, right?
---
Stockades
---
BTag is not the only option of contact. Reddit, Discord, email, Facebook and Twitter are all possible contact options to pick from.
---
in my experience, classic did not force a particular community or playstyle. there were people playing it in a variety of ways, just like people play wow now.  however, it *was* more baseline challenging and brand new, and as a whole it was cohesive because there were no jarring transitions between expansions that marr the leveling experience today. many people played it with real life friends which made socializing a lot more comfortable. i had several real life buddies get into the game with me. i mean, society itself was different then, but thats kind of a different issue. anyway, when my friends stopped playing and i continued, it really was much the same as playing wow retail today is, community wise. a mixed bag of people, and youd run into different kinds of players depending on what your goals that day happened to be. that said, i am excited to play in the classic world again. it did have a lot of little nuances that were later seen as inconveniences but now we remember them as charming and adding flavor and depth - which i agree with, and always have. but as far as community goes... i expect more of the same. most people blasting through without stopping to smell the roses, then bummed when there isnt enough to do (even though theyve barely scratched the surface). sorry if thats cynical but i think we all know people like that and have probably played wow like that ourselves. i mean, youre right, it is a choice to slow down and it can be difficult to approach wow (and life, or anything) with a curious, wondering, journey-over-goal mindset. we are torn between the childlike inclination to explore and the competitive social instinct to compete. like the pandaren still say to adventurers passing through: “sloooow doooown, life is meant to be savored!”
---
Pretty sure they had the scourge invasion on their content release plan in either phase 5 or 6, cant remember which though
---
And honestly, you’ll get those pretty often. In good gear and with 2/2 Savage Strikes, you can expect at least 40% crit chance on Raptor Strike, and with a 2hander it can easily chunk a mage for ~800-1000 damage.
---
Imagine looking at this on LSD
---
It forces them into catform for a period of time.
---
im not salty, i really really want to play classic wow. but yes i also still adore retail wow.
---
Collosal waste of gold for unnoticeable differences outside of swiftmend, which you don't really use while healing anyways
---
“Hey, I need you to log onto the GBank and trade me [X] in Org” isn’t meaningful engagement between guild mates. If anything, it’s a hinderance. Officers have to spend so much time organizing and tallying all that shit, they stop being able to play the game with their fellow players.
---
Ah yes, BUT, do you have a life outside the game? Because that would explain a lot.
---
It’s actually insane how many people are downvoting you. If someone stayed home sick from work and played 12 hours of wow like you typed, then I completely agree, they probably could have worked as long as it’s not a physically demanding job.
---
Yes. You can. You are not a slave.
---
Think the problem with this is the supply and gold.
---
If you have herbalism too, you just need to invest the time to go get the herbs. Fame them yourself, and with an epic mount, and some time, should be fine. However, how will u get a good supply of gold needed to buy the mats you need? Especially in the first few months you are playing?
---
I didn't write the above toxic response, but I still wanna apologize in the name of the vast majority of the community of people who played in Vanilla. **What you read above is not us!**
---
Vanilla was, first and foremost, a social game. People who behaved like dickheads were isolated and far in between. People who made friends and welcomed new players had the most fun.
---
If the community is anything like what it was before, you will not have any problem finding people to play and enjoy the game with. Bring a good attitude, and a willingness to put dedication into whatever it is you want to pursue in the game, and people will welcome you with open arms.
---
What about the peole that like, you know, WANT to play that spec, because they think it is fun
---
I don't get it.
---
Nope, nah and absolutely not.
---
Yeah you’re a dick

---
Being healthy is admirable and a goal worth striving for. I dont mind if people want to get fat, but dont offer them health insurance. Go be fat and then die on your own expenses.
---
The argument would be discouraging questions like: "Hey, anyone have X or any in the GB?" being an opened ended question that could lead to emergent gameplay. With a GB, there is a potential for less of that.
---
Thing is, all you need is 8-10 group to defend/turtle and you can extend the game. Used to love doing this, as it was a lot more fun.
---
Keyboard warriors and fatties, lmao.
---
Yes.
---
I've tanked as Druid up to C'thun and it worked fine, but I would not recommend it to someone who cannot spare the time to make the spec work. It was quite time consuming to raid full time as a druid tank and the payoff was not great.
---
I ended up feeling like I was playing second fiddle and that my guild always had to choose between gearing up a feral tank or gearing up a melee DPS because there was a lot of gear overlap between feral and rogue/hunter/warrior DPS.
---
That said, it's a lot of fun to walk around with 73% damage reduction and 11k health :)
---
Thanks! Have been searching high and low for former guildies without luck, so this might be my chance. Have my old guild master in real ID, but he stopped playing 3 years ago. So luckily i will find anyone else from my guild.
---
It wasn't toxic. The whole post of his was about putting the responsibility on other players for his feelings. By not thinking like a woman and trying to satisfy everyone emotionally you're now considered "toxic". The toxicity would be putting responsibilities onto others that aren't theirs to begin with.

Taxes don't remove money from the economy. The state takes money and spends money, the money circulates.
---
States however, also don't have to deal with money magically appearing out of thin air. The WoW economy does, because the money does in fact appear out of thin air...in the form of respawns.
---
Therefore, the Classic WoW economy needs, and has, ways to permanently remove money from the system. Well balanced, and Vanilla managed to do that, this is how you control inflation in an MMO.
---
Reck bombs are real. At release, you could get an infinite stack and 1-shot Kazzak. But now it's caped to something like 5-swings. Still enough to 1-shot almost any cloth class.  
---
After you've dropped your bomb, you fumble around impotently as literally anyone who wishes to will walks away from you at will.
---
In game at launch will be much different... especially after the first few months (if you're still around)!
---
Just keep inimd it's not really difficult just more time consuming.
---
If you don't know the zones or quests you'll take minimum 10-13 days /played.
---
Good luck with everything and have fun!
---
By not thinking like a woman..damn
---
Do you hear yourself?
---
I don't care what you think. I'm just telling the truth.
---
Bro.... you literally upset so many fucking people with a joke about classic raiding..... holy shit..
---
You go glen coco
---
It was still the best tanking weapon into TBC until they eventually nerfed the threat generation of the proc.
---
Silithus. I can appreciate deserts (Tanaris), I can get appreciate bleak (Deadwind Pass), I can appreciate pretty much every other zone in the game's aesthetics.
---
But by the Light, Silithus is just hideous to me. Something about that slightly orange-tinged gray colour palette just makes me want to look away.
---
Honestly I kinda like it anyway , because they absolutely nailed "alien and inhospitable" in a way that I don't think any other zone ever matched. But that doesn't make it pleasant to look at.
---
No, they must not.
---
XRealm battlegrounds are Vanilly (They were introduced at the tail End of 1.12.2, BEFORE the TBC prepatch.
---
And they were a godsend.
---
Yes. You are a woman, I can tell by the way you're typing.
---
so basicly i kinda have to wait until Classic comes out or we are late in beta testing so that we have real numbers?
---
Lol I commented on that video 11 years ago. He genuinely was a flog
---
So if you have just swung, and then you parry, it will remove 40% of your total swing timer off of your remaining swing timer. I don't believe it's a percentage taken off of what you have remaining, just a static 40%; a two second swing timer will have 0.8 seconds removed.
---
The average20% removal was based on this: if you are at 60% remaining swing timer, you will remove 40% going down to 20% left. If however you are 50% remaining, the maximum it can remove is down to 20% remaining swing timer so you remove 30% of your total swing timer. Likewise at 30% remaining it will only remove 10% of your total swing timer. 
---
And then finally you can't decrease your weapon swing timer once already below 20% remaining, i.e. a parry here will cause 0% reduction.
---
Now down to 60% remaining swing timer, you will remove 40% swing timer. If you average all the values between the 60% to 20% remaining swing timer you will get: 40% removal + 39% removal + 38% removal... All th way to +1% removal. Averaging that will be 20% removal should you lay in the 60% to 20% range. And finally you will remove 0%, 20% of the time, as it is capped at 20% remaining swing timer.
---
40% removal for 40% of the time + Avg20% removal for 40% of the time + 0% removal 20% of the time = 0.24 per parry
---
My first 60 was botted. Got banned in a wave about 3 weeks later.
---
Feelsbadman
---
Just add keybindings one at a time. Even getting 1-3 in the easiest to access positions like Q, E and G is huge quality of life improvement.
---
I just added both of my relevant chars, there’s no limit to how many you can add I think
---
Wrong :) Very judgemental 'manlikedetail'
---
Yes, you are correct
---
For years people have bitched at the idea of WoW2, due to losing their characters and work. Since the end of WoTLK, since it was most of the written lore.    False equivalencies really show peoples ignorance.
---
OP please do not forget.  When you start playing classic on Aug 26/27 and on for the next few weeks/months you will see: hate, annoyance, ignorance, racism, sexism, plain uncalled things all in your chat.  These ARE NOT vanilla gamers, they are there for a short run.  We are helpful, responsible, accountable, resourceful, patient, and friendly players.  We want you to succeed with us, enjoy the world, and get sick loot!  
---
Don’t let us all deter you in this forum, we know there are newbies.  We respect you the same as the people we shared classic with before.
---
Don’t feel left out, we envy your innocence and imagination walking into the world fresh with excitement of what comes next.  
---
I wish this game was new to me.
---
You're right, I'm basing that on a couple of years of playing vanilla emulators. But that's a distinct demographic, so I shouldn't assume retail will pan out the same way.
---
Yeah, I don't think it's supposed to be that far.
---
Marksman hunter without arcane, aimed and multi shot? 😂
---
Seconded, I look forward to being able to take my time leveling without fear of the server population dying off, or shutting down (goddamn Emerald Dream).
---
Part of what turns me off from the Pserver scene is the constant feeling of being behind and rushing to catch up.
---
Since the scourge event is identified in the phase system, I would say they will have it....
---
the things i like about bfa are not unique to bfa,  but things ive been doing in wow since day one. what i *do* love about bfa soecifically is the atmosphere of the zones, the aesthetic, the story setting and progression, and the characters. anyway, “tricking” your brain is also what you do when you meditate, focus on your breathing, lower your heart rate, choose healthy foods, or make whatever decision that isnt like the knee jerk thing. i know that wow has always been a skinner box, for instance. but i choose not to let that addictive aspect of the game weigh me down, so for instance i am not torn up by not getting titanforged gear or whatever, as some people are.
---
Ok so that's atleast somewhat comforting it's not like this by default lol. I have yet to see actual proof of people being able to abuse this mod/console command back then so I'm assuming it's new and should be disabled like you say
---
It's not that it's impossible, but basically you're hindering the healers of the raid/group...
---
You're an effeminate man then, a disgrace to the human race.
---
Then you had bad priests? pre-casting prayer of healing before an aoe mechanic and chaining circle of healing after just provided way too much raid healing for you to compete with.
---
Rebugamer you're asking too much questions they will find you..
---
Since the beginning of World of Warcraft, the pvp players are trying to unlock a secret pvp achievement. It's not about the rank or the gear, it's about being **the first one to create a gnome named ïiî**. 
---
You see it's all about the nameplat-.. OH MY GOD THEY FOUND ME NOOOO 
---
**\*pew pew \***
---
this is what I did with my beta access. Did the fire totem quest and pretty much stopped logging in afterwards. It's still not the actual release so who cares
---
That is why I started my own company. Now I can play whilst other people work! :-) Times sure have changed! I told 2 of my devs that I would be playing in a hardcore guild and wont be able to play with them until I have completed grind and a few bis items at 60. So this means I might have a dungeon run with them in phase 3 of classic LOL :P  aka 1 year from now! :P
---
Yeah blizzard can never outdo that one.  ICC was really close too, but not as well made, mechanically to ulduar.
---
I’ve dinged 60 at Corrins Crossing multiple times, it’s at the point where now I feel compelled to hit 60 there.
---
Think about what theyre trying to test... its not 'will people like the game', as they already know that people love the game. It's 'is the damage right on X boss?' 'does this animation match how it was in vanilla?' 'is the experience the same?'.
---
This isn't a 'noob' friendly beta test, it makes sense to have veterans in there.
---
I love this change.
---
I’m sure they will in classic to a certain extent
---
For any guild that cares even minimally about progression:
---
80% of raid slots are Mage Warrior Priest. There's no such thing as druid or pally tank. The hybrid classes are a joke. Raw DPS potential = gearscore checks from wrath, but instead of being lambasted as a fatal flaw in design it's heralded as some form of RPG specialization. It's not. It's just a bunch of lopsided spergy minmaxing bullshit you'll discover at endgame.
---
Mind giving your opinion why? It's literal wallhacks seems pretty cheesy to me..
---
looks fat
---
Pets are neat.
---
Hunter it is.
---
I played Vanilla, but man... I have bad memory. Cannot remember things from 15 years ago that well. I wouldn't worry. Only the people who played private servers for years will probably be annoying know it alls and they'll probably all join the same guilds.   Most players are going to be nice and chill.
---
If you base your class choice only on racials, YOU fucked up
---
This one would have been high on my list as well, but for the same reason it didn't get the top spot.
---
I see you are wielding the Forbidden Barrens Chat Axe! The Nicker! :P
---
I barely hit 10 minutes the stress test and I logged nearly 10 hours. Being in the night elf land with world server down disconnects  didnt help though.
---
Oh really? I like them both a lot to be honest.
---
I managed to steal not only a boss but a chest from another guy while leveling today and he actually complained to me about it.  Man it felt good.
---
I understand you got this one on top, but that feeling that you want to leave when you enter is what I like about it ;-)
---
Which version of the finder is that?
---
Is it the drop down box one with a comment box, where you select like 3 dungeons and throw in "healer" in the comments then just quest till someone whispers you?
---
A friend of mine is subbed since he started playing on 2005, he only wasnt subbed for about 2 or 3 months of that time around 2012, because he got married and changed his bank account info, only to resub again and its been like this to this day! He is far from being always active in game all this time, he sometimes quits the game but he never removes its sub...he doesnt have money problems what so ever, good for him and specially good for Blizz.
---
He doesnt have Beta but honestly he doesnt care that much.
---
if we run out of pto we still have sick days but they are unpaid at that point
---
Ritual?  There are no summoning stones
---
It’s additive. Orcs resist 45% of all stuns.
---
That reflect on the pyro was beautiful - especially at like 20 fps lol.
---
Shut up. They're retards but so are you.
---
You'll still be healing lol
---
Make sure you have 6% hit if you're at 305 weapon skill, 8% if at 300 weapon skill.
---
Since 2h basically can't get critcapped, stack crit after that.
---
Pre-raid BiS weapons are Arcanite Reaper &gt; Dreadforge Retaliator.
---
You can get the hit chance from Lionheart Helm, Truestrike Shoulders, Bloodmail Boots, Devilsaur Set, Satyr's Bow/Blackcrow and Blackstone Ring.
---
Is there somewhere I can tab through all classic character models and their animations online?
---
Believe me, at launch, people will be questing. The problem will be 25 spergs trying to tag the same mob in the Barrens.
---
It’s additive. Orcs warriors can have 45% stun resist.
---
Instant spells receive something like 30% from spell-power. 
---
This discussion is a little moot anyway, since instant poison translates into something like 15dps. So even if the shadow oil were superior, you'd be getting a deeply insignificant improvement for great cost.
---
If it worked in vanilla then it should stay as it was. If it didn't, then it should be disabled.
---
Personally I prefer longer range nameplates, but if it wasn't a thing then so be it.
---
So femal human and n8elfes? only?
---
Ooh, you get your ce items in?
---
&gt;you can damn well sit at a computer at work and have excel open
---
Because that's what we all do?
---
Now that is depressing. Sorry to hear. :(
---
Haha great
---
I doubt Asmon or Soda will get Scarab Lord. They are both guilding with pserver players. The rank 1s will all be playing together. I really dont see the issue.
---
its not like if enough ppl complain maybe they would actually change it.  
---
but they still can change it after classic releases  
---
and x-realm was anyway in bgs in classic, and i dont rly see a reason why to take it out ?
---
In order to do that they'd have to take away features, spells, abilities, items and a whole bunch of other things.
---
Once something is added it's impossible to take it away without causing more harm than good.
---
Oh ok, just looked through my old servers and only saw BTags as contact options
---
I've already started a petition demanding the game is limited to a aspect ratio of 4:3. Otherwise it's not classic.
---
What do you prefer: Handing out food/water/portals to everyone or farming soul shards for 30 min before doing anything.
---
so you're joining the huge mage population? ~~me too~~
---
This spreadsheet looks phenomenally accurate. 
---
With *perfect* conditions, a hunter can reach 60 in around 80-hours. But the 160-hour estimate seems more appropriate for players who are trying to move at a quick pace.
---
That's what I said.
---
Dang, the king of dueling, tipsout, isn’t competing? What a sham.
---
How can you be immersed without your spurs jingling and jangling?
---
Not having cross-realm bgs was the best part of vanilla wow. Played vanilla wow long enough to get 5 lvl 60s and multiple characters at lower level.
---
It was great seeing the same player, my main opponent guild was Perfektion (pretty sure it was spelled with a k) and had a warrior that I very often was fighting against. Never chatted with him but it was nice seeing that it was the same guy again and had to win the battle against him.
---
With cross realm it is just an unlimited amount of players and you don't care about any about them.
---
Thats what they were trying to do.
---
However I still do not feel its an accurate experience. There was server lag, but around the time of 1.12 that was mostly eliminated. It feels like like took the experience of a west coast player playing on an east coast server with a laptop and made that canon. With the best hardware and a reasonable connection to the server it never felt like it does now.
---
Basically as a holy pally in vanilla I had 3 levels of flash of light on my bar and a few other key "oh shit" talent type CDs, seals,  judgement and Hammer of Justice... Max crit for Mana return spec and spam the shit out of it, constantly.  On occasion when tank takes a donger spam larger heals... Otherwise 90% of the time it's spam heals... Occasionally judge wisdom/light on boss depending on the situation... Get buff groups and always check your tanks for salvation =) that's paladin in a nut shell from 60- naxx (which I did do)  oh, and cleanse!!!
---
I never hit max level until wotlk. People told me the game didn't start until max level but I didn't believe them lol
---
Vote Zog.
---
I don't care much for the beta, it's pretty much a trail of the game we'll get and that I know of already. What's funny though is these people who rushed level 30 and got BiS items as fast as possible then whine that they should increase levels. No it's not the full game, this is just to see how the game runs with active players, try all the other classes too and just have fun
---
I sincerely hope they bring back all the events, they were a ton of fun.
---
&gt;  These ARE NOT vanilla gamers,
---
Really? You experienced none of that in Vanilla? These people will always exist, in every online game, in every country, all over the world.
---
I can second that the link is correct.  
---
If you have doubts just go to:  [https://worldofwarcraft.com/](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic) click on classic in the menu and scroll almost all the way down.
---
I could do you a favour and chuck a frame bang her way
---
It is unfortunate that loyal veteran players are missing out on a new classic-based gameplay meta, and will likely never get to experience it, but don't worry, the likes of trainwrecks, and pokimane got your invite. I'm sure they can appreciate it. FeelsBad.
---
Salt aside, inactive beta players should have their keys recycled.
---
force yourself to read the first 2-3 in the quest area, then you get kind of immersed in the story of that area and you will really want to read the rest.
---
I would seriously lose my shit if a hunter stole the nicker😂
---
OP is getting roasted xD. Just wait till you actually try to raid as a ret pally lmao.
---
This guy clearly has Dunning-Kruger, let him continue to shout how right he is.
---
Well that's the radio I keep on. But in-game music I usually keep off. Or at least the combat music using mods.
---
Because I dislike the stupidly short nameplate range on Pservers. Everyone will have the increased nameplate range so it’s not a big deal.
---
 &gt;most utility
---
**Mage**
---
Food, Portals, Intbuff, Sheep, Freezes.
---
**Warlock**
---
Summons, Healthstone, Soulstone, Impbuff, Banish.
---
Nope, pretty even.
---
&gt;better dps
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhckuhUxcgA
---
&gt;and fairly easy to level
---
You mean, as compared to a class that can reliably deal with 3+ mobs, continuously without ever having to sit and drink?
---
Dunning-Kruger, it has that effect.
---
The one who can change your facial features and skin tone?
---
You sound like you belong in the stone age.
---
or maybe the new character models instead of the ugly old ones :(  
---
\+ a barbier shop .  
---
but well its classic \^\^ , guess i spent 30 mins creating my character just to be sure i like it
---
I could be wrong, but name plate distance used to be forcibly set to a constant value
---
Empty win without Soulhatcher, Cooljin, Rinnoa, Thorner and some others there fighting for Horde. Everyone else was just a target.
---
Its already been proved that its worth it on long fights.
---
Don’t enable instant quest text. Leave the default setting and read the words as they appear since you can’t just click accept until all the text has appeared.
---
He has never played vanilla if he thinks that toxic players didn't exist. it was aids.
---
Easy raid spots are a weird factor. For some reason people think its just contant battle and competition who makes it to the raid!! When in reality theres a lot of guilds struggling to even gather the 40 people in. Yes sometimes some classes might have more players than requires, but guilds take players from all classes that show up and they can trust on, not just ”oh thats a shaman lets just take him even though hes bad and obnoxious”
---
If that means that being an effeminate man is normal, then yes.
---
Shadow Priest is the strongest 1v1 and they’re not even CD dependent. 
---
A Rogue might be stronger for 1 duel and then he has to afk because his prep is on a 10 minute CD.
---
I don't mind much either. I feel like I played the beta in 2004.
---
Shaman will be super popular
---
Been Playing Since 04 Can Confirm Beta Access
---
All of those. So, hunter it is.
---
&gt;Is there any addons that would help me actually pay attention to what is happening?
---
You mean, an addon that would help you glance at 5-6 lines of text?
---
I am all for making things better in life with software, but this is ridiculous. sorry. If you cannot be bothered to read a few lines of text, please stay in Retail.
---
I was talking about leveling, you sperg.
---
The way addons and commands work has been changed massively since vanilla so that argument has less weight here.
---
Orcs are ugly as hell though
---
Can't wait to get me some Dopamine on release
---
AWESOME! Thanks for pointing this out!
---
Veterans and noobs **and streamers**
---
i havent played since tbc. Call me lazy, sure, but i dont see how you can devolve this into a retail vs classic argument lmao
---
Don’t forget the shmmoning as a warlock
---
Don't worry you can redeem yourself soon
---
Desolace for sure
---
You had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Can confirm, is legit.
---
I remember seeing a kodo the size of org bank before. I’m sure the buff he had was ‘all grown up’. I never found out how he got it back then....
---
A lot of things have changed since then, if it changed during then I'd understand. Depends when it did.
---
These hills make me think of Tales of the Past 3
---
I had a bit more desire to be in the beta when I thought that name reservations were a part of it. It seems that everyone with a sub will get a chance to reserve names, so I can just wait.
---
3 days? He’s been preparing since he hit 30.
---
Tirisfal and Silverpine Forest. I can't even say why, but I hated both, and I was playing an Undead in Vanilla :P
---
Ironic
---
Тханкс.
---
You can’t get flagged through aoe.
---
Why not abandon alchemy and keep herbalism ?    If you get the herbs, you can get any friendly peasant (aka the guilds head alchemist)  to make the pots for you :D
---
I am just pointing this out to show you can look at it from another side, not as a suggestion for you specifically
---
Repost
---
144hz is amazing and there’s no going back once you get it. You can drop some settings so you can always maintain 144fps.
---
Yeah, especially of those idiots were shitting on Classic just few months ago.
---
Mostly it's because they lack the self discipline to study and play game like wow sparsely, like only 1 hour a day or so.   so they'd rather not play at all to make sure the studying gets done (even if it wouldn't take up ALL their time. ) any free time then can be consumed by less addictive forms of entertainment
---
I totally see where you're coming from. As a casual vanilla player myself all I can suggest you do is play it at a pace you enjoy and son't be rude. Everything else will come naturally. Elitists and more experienced players are everywhere. I guarantee you will make friends along the journey to 60 and you will find your way and choose what kind of guild you want to join. Just have fun :)
---
i spent several hours this last stress test making and remaking the character i want to main with minute differences in every appearance and comparing screenshots to decide how he'll look..... ain't got time to fuck around making a character on launch day!
---
This is actually true, i played d3 pretty much exclusicely in hardcore mode. Every time i noticed that it was risky i toned down the difficulty
---
Man I spend way too much time in ZG back in the day. It was something special. I loved all those brd/brs deep caves and stuff but seeing an open jungle with a lot of dangerous trolls and monsters in it was unseen as a raid before. 7/10 will play def again
---
Orcs are so ugly and stupid though
---
&gt; They specifically said that they use metrics such as time subscribed to choose the participants.
---
Yeah... they send invites to X amount of people subbed for 5+ years, Y amount of people subbed for 1+ years, and Z amount of people subbed for &lt;1 year. They can use the metrics to pick from all range of times, not just people that have been subbed the longest.
---
I still have that, but I have no idea where.  Probably in a box with old books
---
That's how bleeding edge progression is though, and it's better in classic that retail for one simple reason and that's the whole "this is how your class is FOREVER, choose wisely". 
---
In retail, ever since cata, to server first race we're expected to maintain between 2-3 raid ready ALTS (so our main too), since legion with AP and now azerite that's become ridiculously time consuming to do. It gets better over time, but by then content is cleared and you lost out to the guys who swapped all their melee DPS out for 12 feral druids to cheese World First Nefarian.
---
Can't tell you the number of times i invested like 10 days played at max into a character for them to be nerfed below being worth a spot and having to swap for x months until they do it again and that just won't happen in classic.
---
Sure, a lot of specs suffer as a result, but you can play them knowing that, join a casual progression guild, etc rather than the randomness that comes from blizzards constant changes.
---
He addresses that specifically in his videos though. As some one that tanked in classic i can confirm hes not giving out bad advice for the most part. If hes off about something it would that if you have to stack world buffs to be "viable" than your not viable. That may only be a P server thing that won't replicate on classic. Then again maybe it does and hes right about everything. Time will tell.
---
Hmm I love memeing dungeons and don't care much for raids. Thanks for info(: really sucks that itemization is so bad though...
---
Any builds that come to mind? Do you think 20/31/0 hybrid is good enough to be a strong 5man tank?
---
&gt;I was talking about leveling, you sperg.
---
Makes you even more wrong. Warlocks are superior to mages while leveling in every aspect.
---
They have a pocket-tank, they have high sustain, they have dots. They can deal with multiple enemies effortlessly. Lifetap + Sustain via Drains + improved regen from IDS means you never have to sit and drink. They have Healthstones and self-revival via Soulstones. They can solo most group quests. They get a free mount.
---
What does a mage have? Free Food (which he desperatly needs), and the ability to slowly AoE grind, which is only a viable option if there is complete zone congestion and you cannot quest sufficiently any more.
---
eastern plaguelands
---
It's not, I'm just saying, a healthy human being should be able to muster enough concentration to read a few lines of text without requiring an addon holding his hand.
---
Exactly. I'd like to try beta because it's a goddamn level 30, it's half of the game. So I could try more classes, try how hunter pets work because they're usually one of the most broken things. I was lock back in the actual vanilla, so I'd try it too if it's how I remember. 
---
Just things like these, you know, testing stuff. It's level 30, not 60 after all.
---
You're probably right. You win. *party horn*
---
I'm not calling BS because you sound reasonable and wouldn't have made all those things up.
---
That said, it's almost certain by this time that 99% of the invitees own accounts made during the first year of launch, and that's 2004 US launch. Most of us from Europe got to make our accounts late 2005 and early 2006, so for us it's even less of a chance.
---
I really do hope more people get into the beta, though, and maybe level cap raised to 40.
---
Good farming spot for mages.
---
Don't care. My faction choice has deeper meaning. I would play my fsction if i was the only one on my server and i would also play if there was only player on the opposing faction.
---
this is the problem though, beta isn't to "try it out" its to look for bugs and try to repeat them, most beta testers use it as a trial run or for testing out out the game before they commit to it, i get there has to be a certain amount of just pissing about and playing until you encounter a bug but so many see a bug an ignore it as it being just a minor bug.
---
if you feel you have a itch to scratch then go on a private server if you're truly interested in beta testing then you should opt in.
---
Good bot
---
Longbeards bring the smote!
---
It is not blizzlike; i cannot remember that it was like that back in the days. Has someone reported it or has blizz already has given a statement?
---
WotF?
---
Obviously i can read the text, i appreciate the tighten your bootstraps attitude, but i am simply asking for an addon that i would enjoy using. If you dont have a recommendation and think it's silly, good on you for that, i dont see why you would have to go alphanerd on me for it though. Thanks for the input
---
Based on the big pservers a few months into launch - 10$/100g +/- a bit. Not sure how that'll teanslate (blizz has a lot more players with disposable cash than pservers).
---
As for getting banned or anything - i wouldnt worry about it. From 1.1 to bfa gold buying has been consistently pretty safe.
---
a lot of this entitlement come from mixed messages from blue posts, with some saying invites were sent out based on when the account was created and others saying it was a completely random pool, apart from content creators that got prio for free marketing, so no one really knows how invites were selected which led to people that have had an account since 2004/2005 bitching they haven't had an invite when people that didn't start until wod/legion have got an invite
---
Yes, 100% Desolace.
---
&gt; Stealth Classes will always get the opener in a duel
---
Warriors will always be allowed to get the first charge (except against stealth classes, whose opener takes priority)
---
How do i see this, so if the dual starts and for some reason you see the stealth class before he opens on you you can't actually start the fight but need to wait till he opens on you?
---
Same goes for warrior charge, you are not allowed to try and start combat before he charges?
---
Holy shit Pshero is in?! Some people are aboutta get if I crit he dies’d.
---
ill just make an alt   and/or  farm gold on my tank with mining or herbalism / fishing / cooking  
---
im not much into battelgrounds
---
Just play with them because it’s fun? If you die you die? It’s a game that’s supposed to be played because it’s fun?
---
this is what separates the pleb hunters from the good ones, and every experienced player definitely knows how great a good hunter is in 5/10 man dungeons.
---
the best situational CC and kiting abilities, combined with a decent off-tank as a pet when the situation calls for it.
---
Oof, I like how you're trying to portray yourself as a smart guy who apparently knows everything about WoW, but you failed to recognise how there's only a 1% difference in dodge between classic and pservers.
---
The difference is miniscule, not noticeable. Everyone is at hit cap anyway.
---
Yeah mate all that affected your game 15 years ago was the larger batch windows, there was no such thing as delay due to your slow internet connection.
---
It was implemented back in the day to account for bad connections, not because they wanted to balance combat around it. Now with modern connections it looks awkward and unnatural. 
---
I wouldn’t mind if they got rid of it all together, but I hope they find a way to fix it because I know the #nochanges bandwagon will make a huge fuss about something only 1% of the playerbase would remember/appreciate.
---
Ulduar was fenomenal and ICC was pretty ok. Beyond that WOTLK was not that great and, in fact, introduced a lot of problematic mechanics to WoW:
---
First, it brought about LFG, which was the beginning of the end for the social aspect of WoW. 
---
Second, it pioneered that god-awful Normal/Heroic 10/25 raiding mode (seriously, sometimes it feels like no one else remembers how terrible ToC was).
---
Third, it killed raid and gearing progression by having faceroll heroics dropping badges which you could then use to pretty much fully gear up for the latest raid. 
---
Finally, it introduced achievements, which, while seemingly harmless, caused a lot of problems. I can’t be the only one who remembers people making pugs for VoA and asking for the VoA achievement + insane gearscore.
---
TBC also introduced some mechanics that would eventually become problematic (like flying), but I think that, in the long run, WOTLK damaged WoW a lot more. I’m all for experiencing the story of both these expansions again eventually, but I sincerely hope that Blizzard doesn’t just redo them without at least removing some of the problematic features first.
---
Part of the game is getting help and helping others. I played since vanilla and pservers I never treated anyone the way you described. Patience is part of the game.
---
You wouldn't really know what spec anyone was back then, you had no idea what talents anyone had unless you saw them cast them.
---
So a shadow priest not doing DPS in shadowform looks like any other priest. Leveling dungeons are easy enough that it doesn't matter.
---
Warriors level as arms or sometimes people do fury, but they all tank just fine as DPS trees before 60 (warriors can tank alright without going full prot then too).
---
This.
---
I plan on rolling druid as an alt and trying my hand at druid tanking. Just take a lot of whats said about druid tanking with a grain of salt. Druids "can" tank but due to the design of the game they will not be desirable tanks for high end. You have to work around that and prove your worth and carry your weight when you are not tanking. If you are rolling a druid, expect to do a lot of Non tanking and Non DPS even if your taken as a tank.
---
What about just switching factions and keep your name?
---
The only way to solve low pop realms is to move people or merge but to solve faction issues imbalance you can also move people between the factions.
---
But they don’t have to solve it even thought I think they should. I just don’t want anything cross realm because that was a bad solution which ruined server communities that was the core thing that made vanilla awesome.
---
Goldselling will be a fact of life unless Blizzard undercuts them so they can't sustain themselves. Either live with it, or tokens, pick one.
---
Hello sir. That is called a straw man argument.
---
Also, people did actually have widescreens in 2004. I hade a 1920x1260 flat-isch screen myself. I still have it today. I didnt play Vanilla retail but just pointing out that widescreen was a thing in 2004.
---
But how about vanilla? I dont think there are tokens there.
---
1440 is a more “no going back” for me than 144hz was
---
If you have a car, and you buy a new car,you'd have 2 cars. Just because you buy a new car doesn't mean that the old car dissappears.
---
What you are saying could be said about every expansion as well. All your hard work goes down the drain. Sure you'd probably have gold, but the increase in prices should take care of that.
---
It's not alphanerd, but I work in the area of software assistants, and am heavily involved with TTS software.
---
And I can tell you this as the professional opinion of someone who thinks about questions like this for a living: Any addon that does what you describe, in this usecase, would be SLOWER, and more cumbersome, than just reading the text.
---
TIL technical imperfections that were made to accomodate connections of 15 years ago are gameplay features. Now that I know, I will cancel my fiber internet and set up my old dial up because I want to get as many gameplay features as I can get.
---
I tried PTR for 8.2. The content is nice for sure, however class design still completely sucks. Those famous HoA talents that were supposed to be huge thing, are basically Netherlight Crucible 2.0. I was looking forward to this system because smart guy Ion said no class reworks until the next expansion, so I thought at least this might address some of the issues. But it's pretty bland and I think this is how it will release.
---
I'll definitely play it, but only because I don't have anything to play until Classic and the current BfA is one of the most boring periods of WoW I've ever played, so new content is welcomed. The new raid looks pretty cool (raids are the only thing BfA does great), the other content is there too so it will definitely take a while to complete it.
---
But the core issues I hate about BfA weren't fixed anyway. I kinda hope 8.2. is the last BfA patch and they'll focus on the next expansion after that.
---
I would love to see the player charts for both when classic goes live!
---
Should add an option of "opted in within the first 12 hours of availability."
---
I didn't make my account until near the end of vanilla, I think about 6-8 months before BC (I was actually playing on EU when BC launched). I never hit max level in vanilla.
---
cope
---
Yeah, I hope they invite at least twice as many as they already have, and make sure the layering works
---
Maybe even invite a lot to a new beta server only, to test layering. They could have the streamer servers for their PR, and layering servers to test that. Only testing layering during the stress tests seems a bit risky to me
---
bis weapon is the bonereavers edge i think, check the "fight club" warrior discord
---
virus
---
I'm not sure it'll take a full year. Blizz indicated that the content release schedule will be fluid based on how far the players are. Though this is all likely to change.
---
Wait, you actually think raider io will not be a thing in this one? I chuckled.
---
Yep, mobs tend to ignore the y axis and will try pathing to you still but as long as your still in range on that axis you'll be in range.  
---
As for the wands that was definitely just a pserver thing. Another way to think about this is ranged attack power doesn't affect your wanding.
---
Not at all you seem like a great person, I understand your concerns over bashing and could learn from your example to be more diplomatic with my posts instead of not mincing my words. However just because something is free from a dollar cost does not mean it is made purely in good will or will not cost you something in another way.
---
This guide is perfect 1-30 for the dwarf race I tested it on, I cannot comment on the others but I would believe it is of equal or slightly better quality.
---
Navak has a twitch although I am unsure of the handle but I do know his guide will be posted here https://classicwow.live/ or have information on where to find it.
---
Thanks for looking at these concerns from a balanced viewpoint and not RHEEEEing like the author it is appreciated.
---
I can dream
---
This reminds me, does Arcane Missiles properly hardlock on a target? I believe the channeling was disrupted in the Demo.
---
Me too.  Quality runs of great instances like SFK are what I'm looking forward to, not rushing to an endgame that will always be there.
---
Because “muh pvp meta is based around a technical imperfection that is used to accomodate connections of 15 years ago”.
---
That's called a straw man argument. Its usually used by politicians and other dishonest people.
---
Castrandom will not pick another spell until it successfully casts the previous one, so it gets stuck very quickly.
---
No tokens, I rather have a thousand gold sellers spamming trade chat than that god forgotten token system it ruins everything.
---
Felwood.
---
Goldselling was a thing in vanilla too.
---
Drop out of school. School will always be there. Wow classic only releases once
---
&gt;Want to be rich? Roll mage right? Wrong, you can easily make good money as any class fishing for stone scale/squid etc.
---
Thank you for finaly ending my long internal debate between priest and mage.
---
&gt;massive
---
Literally 1% of the playerbase will be in a situation they will be affected by it.
---
If they were in vanilla, then keep them in. So long as farm spots are not completely overrun then it's fine.
---
[It's already a thing like i said in the OP.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m_YEaXeyD4) I wouldnt have to ask reddit for an alternative if blizzard didnt force this project to close, and obviously im not the only one looking for something like this. It doesnt matter to me how long it takes, i just feel like i would be more immersed in the story with this or a similar addon. Why is this bothering you so much? Get over it dude
---
Good link.  I still have the book of this!
---
Your comment is the only virus here..toxic sob
---
Ever hear of skipping pulls hot sauce?
---
The dodge is an extra 0.9% than on private servers, which is a marginal difference to dps and is certainly not going to make a noticable difference to difficulty.
---
...yep... theyre adding 16 debuff slots too. That doesn't mean you have to get a giant box monitor, but if you want to, feel free.
---
&gt;wow rendering discord
---
Link? I'm interested :)
---
&gt;  maybe we should have a free faction change 
---
thats one of the most immersion destroying blizzard services i could imagine lol
---
He specifically says many times in the videos that you shouldn't spec fury/prot unless you have gear and experience tanking in prot.
---
how dare blizzard try to promote their game
---
I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm happy to be able to watch streams since I don't have any chance of getting in the beta.
---
I'm just saying the only people they hand-picked are streamers :)
---
yes they stated it in the phase plans.
---
keep in mind thats about 2years out
---
One of us
---
How? You farm ores/herbs and compete with chinese gold selling company who undercuts you to bottom
---
will of the forsaken
---
Can you tell your friend that I’m also your friend and ask him to add me to the beta too?
---
They aren't made MT for practical reasons since there are around 5-6 bosses in the game druids shouldn't or can't tank without over gearing - everything else can be tanked in progression. Also, what are your chances of being MT if you roll warrior? Getting a spot as MT is about being good at the social side of wow. However, there's nothing stopping the OP being 2nd/3rd tank - a role druids are particularly good at.
---
You've obviously never tried vanilla's Discord Unit Frames then. Now THAT'S insanely configurable.
---
I think there will be a LOT of people going to Classic in the first few months, it's hype is crazy, it's basically a new game, and I don't blame anyone wanting to check it out,   they pay their subs they are 100% entitled to go play it, buuuuuut I think a lot of people will nope out before hitting 30, and will go back to BFA.
---
LOL how is that toxic
---
Yes yes and yes, nerd
---
I would disagree with that actually - if you're in a casual guild you probably won't need to farm pummelers from gnomeregan, and druid tanking is a less complex rotation than warrior.
---
Lol, have fun healing.
---
r/pitchforkemporium get your pitchforks here men
---
I am on eu
---
It's not new. I remember years ago you got a beta invite for presubbing for a span (I think it was 6 months for the MoP beta?).
---
Skarms videos back all this up accept viscidius. That one he admitted your just better for the raid as a de-curse than tank. Not that you shouldn't tank it as feral because of threat issues
---
.
---
Are you moron? 
---
Majority of them are botters. Did you know they use teleport hacks too? So if you could teleport hack in vanilla its ok because "hey it was in vanilla so its ok to cheat". Idiot.
---
Clearly leveling in melee range, guess it checks out?
---
You can change faction and keep your name. Only from the larger faction.
---
It’s better then that the other faction stops playing or a free realm change from your realm.
---
Crushing blows are 150% of normal damage - when you have much more HP than warriors and are at the armor cap, bosses simply don't do enough normal damage for two crits to kill you, let alone two crushes.
---
No changes
---
you sound spoiled and naive
---
1.1 Gameplay during dungeons/raids/pvp.
---
Jokes on them, if they undercut under the regular prices.
---
* How annoying other people will be (used to play hybrids, and used to be constantly asked/forced to heal despite hating it).
---
* Gameplay/playstyle.
---
* PvP performance.
---
* Inmersion stuff, namely class fantasy and interesting class quests and such. 
---
* Everything else.
---
There is no solution but to ban them once you discover them. Cheaters will always exist. Live with it.
---
Could buy yourself a bit more time to show off by just hearthing instead of the 2-3 minutes it takes to get to org Haha
---
Which is why you gotta pay attention to everything. Dodge is just one of the things Pservers got wrong.
---
Oh no those will definitely be there.
---
Can she slip me in the Beta too ?
---
Let's face it, this will definitely happen. I'll be eagerly watching alliance streams waiting :-P
---
funny to see people like you who sit here and try and argue against me when you are actually on the same side
---
Pffft female troll all the way.
---
As if everyone plays video games for the absolute exact reasons and fun somehow means the same thing to everyone.
---
Lmao even Classicwow isnt safe from this mindcontrolled drivel.
---
24/7-rent-free at work again
---
Hit cap has nothing to do with dodge. And 1% more dodge on bosses in classic means they take less damage. Actually significantly less damage in terms of raid damage. I find it interesting how you moved your argument when you found out you were wrong. First you said pserver bosses take the same amount of damage. Then when proven wrong you say they don't take significantly less damage. Its interesting.
---
You forgot the next part in that slide
---
True, thanks! And poor aussies..
---
One of the entrants is called serenitynow, that was the guild from the video right? I really hope this happens.
---
You should be able to put your class down aswell as your name
---
Then you miss the point of a beta.
---
Yep Blue post confirmed it. They haven’t said anything about the BlizzCon 2005 pet though.
---
Are you drunk?
---
susanexpress will be back, with a vengeance.
---
&gt;Now we all know there will be a load of gold swapping going on between Classic players and BFA players
---
Do we? That seems like a stretch.
---
To me, part of the point of a bank alt is to let you level more quickly, as you can dump items in the mail for them to handle, which means you can keep on grinding. Leveling up the bank alt and their professions is a time investment that you're not spending on the main.
---
&gt;You can change faction and keep your name. Only from the larger faction.
---
yes, i understood your post, i just hate 'shortcuts' to an experience. changing your race/faction is completely changing your character and a no-go for me. a server transfer would be more acceptible in my eyes, but name reservation is a big problem then.  
---
i want to actually play BGs regardless of daytime, classic server cap is way too low to establish acceptable queuetimes. As you said, there is no obvious solution.
---
Ban botters/hackers, everything else is fair game.
---
By hardcore, you'll bne a hardcore off tank that heals the raid
---
I remember I reported bounch to blizzard and they havent been banned once.
---
They ban them in waves after 2+ years. Blizzard gms have always been USELESS.
---
yeah, but who else were they gonna hand pick? cant really think of anyone else important enough
---
No. The token might impact Classic, but thats no good reason to have it in it.
---
There are 6 bosses a druid shouldn't tank in progression - Chromaggus, Nefarian, Viscidus, Huhuran, Loatheb and Sapphiron. Half of those are because its optimal for a druid to be healing/cleansing instead (Viscidus, Loatheb, Sapphiron). Pretty much all of them can be tanked by a druid for fun once the raid is geared.
---
Yeah except they will never get ban. I reported several botters and they have never been banned. You can test yourself by tagging mob first and they will kill it like robots. Tag 20 mobs and they kill all of them.
---
I made my account in April ‘05 and I have no invite.
---
Same reason I'm not into private servers. I need it to be live and tied to my bnet account to fully enjoy wasting my time/life.
---
Only the original
---
dont let it be forgoten
---
Atleast the priest t1 set gives you enough stamina to use for pvp as well as pve
---
I get it, I don't support any addons to Classic either, this is just a unique situation which didn't exist back in Classic, the fact that gold will probably end up being traded between the games for game time.
---
Nothing wrong its like intended in wow. this is how it was avid hc raider and pvper back in the day.  
---
as somone mentioned its not just batching i think it has to do also before the network system got changed a bit in wow.  
---
Cant remember when they changed it if it was tbc or wotlk.  
---
but it was indeed thru the entire vanilla expansion.
---
Im about 95% positive you can do the quests in 1.12. I remember myself doing this for mount rep
---
hey there! I'm glad I saw your comment on this because (dunno if you knew it, or maybe even joined us meanwhile)...  
---
but Endurance reformed on several different private servers in the past few years and we're going to play on WoW Classic aswell, with old faces like Dooze and Shaou and many new ones.   
---
If you're interested check our homepage, or hit me up here so I can invite you to our Discord.   
---
[https://endurance-gaming.org/](https://endurance-gaming.org/)
---
Well, havent played since BC and got my old account back from some limbo some time ago. Good thing is, that account is a CE account :)
---
He posts a lot of /r/MGTOW, btw. Might not be worth arguing.
---
Regular price is what bots will undercut. Its about supply vs demand and they have huge supply.
---
You compete with people who grind 24h/day and they get paid for that irl cash. 
---
Your effort of farming 2h = shit.
---
If the GMs don't give a fuck, what makes you think that the rest of blizzard staff do? And what would be your solution? I'm willing to bet that you don't have one, you just like to whine.
---
you mean you actually gave feedback instead of abusing your beta access to simply play the game early?
---
Well if there is different server types then you can choose the solution you want. That should be a pretty good solution.
---
I've seen a lot of people shitting on tryhards, but not a lot of tryhards shitting on people.
---
Bullshit, I even checked 3 times before and after I posted, but sure make things up.
---
Reckoning was changed a few times in Classic alone. You would "store" crits done to you and gain an extra attack on your next swing for every stored crit. This was originally uncapped and lead to abuse like the infamous Kazzak 1-shot.  
---
The 1.12 reckoning will 100% be capped (I forget the cap, but its like 3).  
---
Alternatives pre-T2 would still be some form of 2H hybrid. Once BWL releases, then a lok'amir shockadin (later with the AQ meteor trinket) were peerless, even till TBC.   
---
Lucky for you, paladins were very versatile in pvp and your gearing/talent/loadout options are numerous and flexible. You even get the execute hammer in phase 1! Lucky!
---
Instant ban maybe instead waiting 2-years? 
---
Dude add them in FRIENDLIST. Watch what will happen they will bot 2+ fucking years before next wave. 
---
They have 100% automated movements + dont answer + tag 20 mobs and they will kill all of them like robots.
---
It wasn't related though. It gave a crap ton of argent dawn rep which really helped to get Naxx attuned. Besides the AQ event wasn't needed. Blizz could have simply unlocked the gates, if they didn't want to do events they would just do that.
---
the only two is do i enjoy this class?  
---
second is is it fun for the things im gonna do? for instance if i wanna pvp i wont roll any melee beside warrior or paladin.  
---
You are going to have fun as rogue and shaman in small skirmishes but beyond that, have fun trying to reach your target and thats even if you have your cd:s becuse there is more escape items in enginerring and spec combined to get away than get close to your target :P  
---
But yea.
---
Think about it a bit: Who'll read your post?
---
If they are "toxic" veterans you rally against, they'll just insult or ignore you.
---
If they are helpful people, they'll be insulted by your accusations and tone.
---
You are going about this wrong, just saying.
---
I'll play classic as a supplement, I'll splurge on it for a while then dwindle down from it into a slow, but steady pace of playing, because from what I've played so far the memories came flooding back to me so the "new" feeling will wear off yet again, as it's done in the past. After that it will just be WoW classic like it was 15 years ago except this time, a lot of people have played it already and a lot of us who played as a kid / teen / young adult now have business schedules.
---
I do agree that's it's hyped up, and for some it may live up to that expectation and for some it won't, hope for the best and plan for the worst.
---
Oceanic servers XD
---
I doubt more than 1 or 2 tanks in each guild goes deep prot for raids, everybody else just puts some points in it
---
And my guess is, that if that 1 or 2 tanks want to pvp more than casually, then they make an alt for it
---
I suspect I'll be somewhat sad because I doubt I'll be running any end game content in classic. So 60 may mark the end of the journey.
---
ya, maybe RP servers should have crossrealm BGs disabled or smth like that
---
If you hide behind the wall in stv, you should not be seen through texture
---
Do some of you really care about your characters looks or is this just a meme?
---
I only want a choice for a cross realm disabled server. That wouldn’t ruin things at all.
---
The audience who watch that fight can be easily tab targeted too. I know because I wiped a group doing it. :(
---
dont the tokens take gold out of rotation? prob not what you want on classic.
---
It will almost certainly happen. Sinces booster can make currency out of gold on retail, the gold earned there is likely to be worth more than the gold on Classic is.
---
I agree 100%, there's gold swapping between games, and classic will be a separate game from retail, so there's really no arguing that it will happen, I just wonder what scale it will happen on and if Blizzard will see it as a punishable offence seeing as they own both.
---
Just prepare for the #nochanges crowd to jump on you
---
Then you simply choose a server with cross realm battlegrounds. Everyone is happy.
---
Given that patch 1.12 is the nerfed version of vanilla (due to TBC comming out after that patch worked as a catch up mechanic), did you still die a couple times taking on multiple mobs or did it feel easy like most of the streams i have seen?
---
&gt; but it seems /sit doesn't work in classic
---
It does work but only when you are standing back up and you are timing it with NPCs attack. So it requires a lot more engagement than on private servers.
---
&gt;farming soul shards for 30 min before doing anything.
---
Luckily that doesn't really happen anymore, people show up on time and they forget about healthstones.
---
I agree and was going to post the same thing.
---
I think I'm better off not playing the beta as it will just burn me out faster for the real thing.
---
I mean I'd rather have the real thing today but I want permanence like you say
---
Org is great jumping back and forth through the drag is a great past time
---
You want both?
---
Will it have snow storm weather effects?
---
Are you booin’? You look to be a bit booin’ - but nah you’re totally right some people are boring as fuck
---
emo
---
Because it's an obvious lie, and not even remotely funny. You basically accused me of an activity that would be a criminal act in most western countries. If you did that in the real world, you'd be getting a letter from my lawyer.
---
The Gold in vanilla has a value regardless. If tokens didn't exist ppl would buy it for real money from Gold farmers.
---
Wat ?
---
Larger bag slots.
---
Would be nice to start without them considering each server will have multiple layers (should be small queues), then after layering closes (lol, spoiler - won't be for months) then turn on the cross realm bgs... especially since they were in Vanilla.
---
Ignore is account wide, you can ignore them all you want but when they start spelling out their company name with dead orcs in Orgrimmar right in front of the auction house, you better close your eyes.
---
It's a living for some people, you're not going to defeat them so easily, all you can do is report them and not buy gold.
---
Yeah Im gonna get my main to flying in BFA at least.
---
I agree that it is a unique situation. But keeping the token in retail atleast makes it so, that boosters and others like them have to get the gold there, if they want to change it into BattleNet currency.
---
I just realized that this ability to swap out gold for game time situation will make the farming cartels extremely aggressive.
---
Had an argument with a sibling of mine whos argument was that Classic would be horrible because nobody cares about that slow piece of shit, everyone just wants gold.
---
I am not joking, his argument was literally "you cant get gold in Classic"
---
However, before you bring your pitchforks. He was fortunate enough to get into the stress test and lo and behold, he had changed his mind and was reminded of what made him play WoW back in the day.
---
I remember at launch I spent an extra few hours deciding on my main because I thought the CE pet was a one time thing.
---
I'm assuming classic will be the same but vanilla was really community based. A hunter taking a big 2h from a warrior is horrible form and you can very easily cause drama. If you're talking leveling content then it's perfectly fine for any class that uses it as their main weapon to roll need i.e. a 2h rolled on by pally, warrior, shaman, etc.
---
I could see there being a market for people who cross-transfer gold. Say you got tokens on Retail and want gold in Vanilla, I bet there'll be someone out there that will make that trade to pay their subscription or whatever.
---
Wish it wouldn't be the case, but in reality I don't see it being preventable/detectable even if Blizzard would outlaw those trades.
---
Useless, no, but very slow? Maybe.
---
It's not going to change 15 years later my friend, most games can't really defend against RMT without making legit players super upset, so it's usually something they live with and ban on an as-needed basis.
---
Yeah you're right, it's a hurdle at least.
---
yeah, but they looked less intense than on pservers. Obviously we should compare it with OG Vanilla, not pservers, but its hard to do a side by side comparison with 15 year old memories.
---
Here is a great clip. https://clips.twitch.tv/ImpossibleDaintyStrawberryPastaThat
---
But you will be seen. So deal with it.
---
Except vanilla players are generally much more into loot. No one really cares about loot in retail that much. But missing out on some great loot in vanilla can make people go full on rage mode.
---
I don't mean all the quests. I still remember there was a quest that had something to do with a well in the city after Camp Narache that, as an Orc, I was not able to complete.

I definitively used blink to save myself from falling back then. You just had to get the timing down.

And every so often you'd fail and either blink mid air, or hit the ground and take damage. But most of the time you could make it work.

Human is the best PvE warrior because of weapon skill. The 5 weapon skill bonus to swords and maces translates into about 3% hit rating. It's worth 3 talent points if you compare it to the Precision (rogue) talent.
---
Gnome 5% intelligence is a strong racial for mages and warlocks. 5% intelligence bonus is worth 2.5 talent points if you compare it to Divine Intellect (paladin).
---
Here's the thing about stun resist. It's incredibly useful for every class, unlike intelligence or weapon skill. And it's 8 talent points worth, not 3, of a universally useful stat.
---
That got it from farming, so there will be people out in the open so wPvP is not ruined. No thanks to tokens.
---
Lol, Esfand just bop'ed his friend by mistake. Wasnt the spell batching.
---
Not for classic, I agree. But if they were to sake wow 2.0 I would still want full voice acting. Unique models, but with the gameplay principles of classic.
---
Oh yea people already abused that with the Blizzard balance and gifting, it's insane. 
---
Laundering Blizzard goods through Blizzard, people are smart. Just imagine how useless gold is going to be when people start selling gear runs, MC clears and all these other clears of 15 year old content, it's going to be utterly insane.
---
get a life and stop crying. my acc is from day one never changed acc never got hacked. i dident get one but you dont watch me crying like you... jesus christ get a fucking life.
---
Until the faction imbalance makes everyone cry. Like it happened back then... that's why they introduced cross realm bgs.
---
Cross realm bgs are also not fully cross realm but instead had battle groups that tried to match servers with fitting populations. Unless populations change a lot, your battle group is not changing often. No clue if classic will use this system though, I doubt there will be enough servers.
---
What about priest then?
---
Yeah that totally makes sense, thanks for the 200 IQ tip!
---
allready got added.
---
the possibility to rearange the characters at the login screen
---
Where I live employers are not allowed to ask why you are off sick.
---
You just say you are calling in sick.
---
If you have a certificate from the doctor it always says "medical condition", never the specific illness, unless you request it.
---
lol, well if anything this is going to be very interesting regardless.
---
How expensive is it to drink after fights if you don't have a mage making you free water? Is it worth considering just auto attacking and normally Regen mana instead of buying water from vendors?
---
My top 3 
---
1. Mulgore

2. Elwynn Forest

3. Westfall

Bottom 3:

1: Feralas

3: Desolace

inventory icon is different (unless the nicker's icon was changed in a later patch)

I'm in this exact situation. Working a night job, "suffering" from insomnia during the day, Switched to a high fat low carb diet for longer more consistent energy without caffeine (And to not get fat sitting at my desk), was approved for two weeks of vacation starting august 26th.
---
My goal is level my paladin to 60 within those two weeks as fast as I can. I've had experience with OG vanilla and pservers.
---
My main problem is the line of sight. If they aren't in line of sight why should you know their exact position? Feels strange as hell if you ask me
---
I still think my Mulgore post was better. But if you are an alliance player, then I can see why you would like this. Still....Mulgore is the best!
---
Need something with a bit more range? To start off, the lever-action 7-round buckfork:
---
▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一E
---
Ruggedly reliable, best suited for lynching OP's at a close distance.
---
Next we have the fully automatic forkpitcher:
---
︻̷┻̿●═E
---
A modified tommy submachine gun equipped with a 100-minifork drum, perfect for dispatching entire herds of OPs without reloading.
---
Announcing the motherforker, a belt-fed beast that hates OP even more than we hate spoons:
---
︻╦̵̵͇̿̿̿̿══╤─E

Banned in most first-world countries, we have the privledge of manufacturing these exclusively in forkistan.
---
Finally, the experimental railfork, 69420 volts of electric lynching power:
---
︻̷̿┻̿═━═━E
---
We scraped this together with 3D printed parts and magnetized titanium ammunition, the future is now!
---
Petition forkistan to standardize these models and bring glory to the resistance once more!
---
If this feature makes it to release, then ofc. If blizzard listen to their community a little, they will get rid of it.
---
Normal rez for druids
---
I'm really hoping for a blue post as well it's a pretty big deal if you ask me
---
Awesome, this is exactly what im looking for
---
No sir, will be only the people in there now so they'll be the most ready for classic and get ahead of the pack.
---
Looking forward to being level 5, 10 hours into launch.
---
As much as blizzard says classic is a "love letter" to the fans - it really screwed anyone who has been playing on private servers for years and anyone else that's been wanting classic.
---
Pretty wild that they wont open additional closed beta servers and add more people to see if there are any different things / bugs that can be found.
---
That is unless of course they are done with Classic and could launch today... but are holding off to release 8.2 and have it not be overshadowed more than it already has been.
---
Their beta is such a small number of people that it serves nothing more than a way to try and be relevant on twitch between now and August.
---
All good though because everyone will play by August and we all get to enjoy the shitshow that is layering!
---
Could somebody post screenshots of all the controls a guild master has over his guild?
---
I mained paladin vanilla-wotlk. I used to play on a laptop. Holy Light was bound to '1', Flash of Light bound to '2'. The 2-key was completely eroded into a flat polished unmarked key, the 1-key about 50% less so. Rest of the laptop looked untouched.
---
Thats paladin PvE for you.
---
the rogue from 00:30 still has nightmares of this encounter
---
What is the 'meta' for farming higher level stuff for leatherworking? What do you kill. Also do you need to be in a higher DPS spec or can you do it as a healer potentially? 
---
I'm set on druid but undecided between LW and Alchemy as my main profession basically.
---
Oh man I remember that event, I was having a blast but I recall so many people whining that they couldn't complete quests and turn in because the quest givers were all turned into zombies.  It was said back then, that because of the complaints Blizzard wasn't going to do anything like that again.
---
I sure hope they do it though.
---
Amazing! Must of been later than I thought - So happy someone has this.
---
I dont know, maybe? Classic will be another market for boosting, but the lockouts are different, and there is less loot on each boss, so maybe not?
---
There are a lot of different factors to consider, but the token is abused, (as stated above by Forenx) in retail, and it creates a culture there noone wants to take the two noobs, for the last two spots, if they can take two people who are willing to pay for the spots isntead. I actually think that this, above many other things hurt the gameplay experince more than anything else.
---
Yea, I know of at least 4 guilds from my server on horde side alone that are going to be clearing and selling runs, and some that are going to fluff the opposing faction for HK farming for r14 in BGs. 
---
Since multiboxing is more prevalent now (it did happen in classic just on a smaller scale due to hardware / software) there's going to be some fun stuff going on in the PvP scene.
---
Well, keeping that many alts are only for server first race, as you mention. That is like a handful of people.
---
Aside from them, everyone else have it quite nice in retail. I honestly never bothered playing the optimal classes, I've played both OP and extremely nerfed classes throughout Legion and the part of BfA I tried - and never did I encounter not being able to find a group because of my spec being bad. Sure if you want to push the highest key possible you need to optimize, but that is just the nature of having basically unlimited increase in difficulty.
---
By all means, I'd say retail is more balanced by far. At least they don't have things where even equally geared classes played optimally can be 100% apart in dps or even more. And it is not even due to hybrid tax, there are dps classes that does 100% more dmg than other "pure" dps classes.
---
I do kind of enjoy the imperfect parts of vanilla, though. Classes not being equal can be fun in some ways.
---
Some pieces of it used to have shadow damage and spelldamage.
---
The highlight of my wow experience this year was the classic stress test and i cant even log in in bfa anymore i despise it that much. I would pay stand alone game money to get in it 😁
---
Bahh i don't want beta. Keep it F R E S H.
---
Do we know yet if classic will have OCE servers?
---
Ah, true, it was only intellect. Sorry. I somehow misremembered that the leather belt was also BIS from the quest. We did the quest with two people easily for the mail belt, as that is definitely great.
---
Unlike every other racial that provides some minor benefits that are **technically** better than other racial choices... Hardiness is just flatout the best. If your a Horde Hunter/Shaman/Warlock/Rogue/Warrior/ and you're not an Orc you objectively made a mistake that isn't minor.
---
The reason it makes sense to not include any type of token within classic is so that blizzard can catch buyers and sellers a lot easier.
---
The economy depends on them watching each server very closely for the lifetime of classic.
---
Buyers and sellers are one thing, if we get blizzard ignoring the 15+ betting caravans like they ignore them in BFA... that will be the other thing that runs the game.
---
Layering and caravan botting are the top 2 things that I don't want to see in classic - but I expect those 2 will kill the soul of classic (the parts that aren't raiding)
---
What do you mean; going to fluff the opposing faction for HK farming for r14 in BGs?
---
Yes, you could
---
Rank 1 is great for keeping the +25% armor buff from heal crits up on tanks as well.
---
Everyone and their mother is an alchemist and all the normal recipes are stupidly easy to get. There might be a large demand for potions, but every guild has at least 10 alchemists who will craft for free. Only flasks make money and those are not easy to get.
---
Who am I gonna buy gold from if there aren't any gold sellers?
---
Yeah that exciting emergent gameplay of logging in characters and sending sharing accounts with buddies
---
did you even play vanilla lmao? We tanked UBRS as full dps specs in blues just fine. Imp shield block and defiance were needed for raids, but pretending like you needed to be prot for dungeons is some retail shit not vanilla.
---
All the facts yet youre still missing the point
---
Unfortunately this lands on blizzard to monitor buyers/sellers for the entire lifetime of classic.
---
Not only that but if they ignore the 15+ caravan botters like they do in BFA - it will also ruin the economy.
---
Only thing we can do is report everytime we see it... rest is up to blizzards "small team"
---
My point is, there is absolutely no reason for it not to be stickied. Who cares if someone anecdotally has seen it a lot? When some, demonstrably, have not. It's just fucking stupid and void of logic from the mods. 
---
What if a new person comes to the sub? They have to wait on it to be serendipitously dropped in a thread they're in? 
---
It's as if the mods don't like the guy that made the site or something, just weird.
---
If a Classic player wants game time via token, he has to exchange Classic gold for BFA gold.  
---
It may be that not many 3rd parties will be overly thrilled at being a currency exchange, especially given the added effort of a multi-client gold-&gt;gold exchange. They need to minimize risk by not linking their accounts to both clients, meaning double the necessary accounts per seller.  
---
Their profit will be tied to forecasting the changing economies of two separate games as, in a gold-gold exchange, they have only gold, not yet cash.
---
I'd just be happy with some oceanic based realms, everything else is perfect.
---
Someone in sodapoppins stream said the same yesterday, let's hope it's a big wave.
---
Nothing will ever beat the combo that makes the undead male look like ^_^
---
How hard is it to find herbs on the beta ? Is it even possible of is competition so big that it's better to take skinning instead ?
---
Nice mic drop line kid
---
I would pay 20 bucks sub for classic, blizzard pls use me any way you like
---
!RemindMe 69 days
---
You don't need to  level as Holy to be healer in dungons - I've always been deep ret while leveling, just save the int gear you come accross and have it ready if you find a dungeon group. You will have 0 issues healing all the content up to level 60.
---
Imagine being wrong just to make a post showing how wrong you were.
---
It was 15 / month in vanilla too btw. No changes means no changes right? Or it doesn't count when it's our turn to contribute?
---
Mages are the only class that really needs to drink much while leveling. Warlocks too, but they also have life tap bandaging as a regen option. The other classes are better off using their mana sparingly and mostly wanding, auto attacking, and healing between fights while letting their mana regen.
---
Wow this post is ignorant
---
Splitting the community. No one is happy.  
---
Get this into your heads already: **You are the minority**.  
---
The overwhelming majority of the community wants CLASSIC. Not Classic+, not MyClassic, not Classic 4 IPhone.
---
Understand and I appreciate you breaking it down.
---
If it wasn't changed by the end of vanilla, it doesn't belong in Classic.
---
Sorry to say but any balancing like this makes the game more like BFA, I personally wouldn't care if they changed the racial but I'm only worried about A. Layering and B. Botting Caravans that get reported and don't get taken care of.
---
A premade of horde players vs a premade of alliance players
---
1 or 2 players from either faction will literally farm the other faction for HKs in the battleground, and since both sides are working together, it goes smoothly.
---
It'll be between 0 and 400 ms, 200 on average. I don't know, it's hard to say how it will impact the feeling of the game without getting to play.
---
im sorry but i actually played pvp and was flag carrier in vanilla i know what was one of the rookie mistakes in vanilla.  
---
same goes for hibernate. all cc effect that was tribal effected you could not get out of them once you got stuck in normal form.
---
Yea but you were paying for patch development and balancing.
---
Downvoted because Trump meme.

Builds in Vanilla are usually tied to your gear, especially HIT-DEF values, so a basic entry build will be

&gt;My pal at Blizzard went to add me and my husband to the F&amp;F list and it turns out I am already on the list for the next round of Beta. He says those invites should start rolling out Monday. 
---
&gt;So, I am already on the beta list without a friend and family invite.
---
Not sure you understand.
---
You are already on the lost for the f&amp;f list.
---
Herbs are all over in the beta, keep in mind there's far few people on the beta than when classic comes out. I definitely wouldn't recommend going herb/mining when classic comes out though as those nodes will be very contested.
---
OK Mr. Moneybags
---
[Patch 2.0.1](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.1) was the pre-TBC catch-up patch. Came out over a month before TBC and included all the new TBC spells and talent trees. That's the nerfed vanilla patch, and we're not getting that one.
---
&gt;It works on private servers.
---
You really shouldn't be comparing the two and forget everything you did on private servers.
---
Just watch a streamer with no wow experience :)
---
lmfao I love the elite player frame
---
Then don't pay and go back to pservers, no one will care.
---
Which class do you have in mind for this question?
---
Just because something is a thing, doesn't mean it's useful.
---
&gt;Why is this bothering you so much? Get over it dude
---
Excuse me, did the high council of earth change the rules of the internet, requiring me to only reply to topics that you are okay with me replying? No? Then I guess it's still my business what I reply to and why.
---
What can i do to not think about classic wow Every day?
---
The older models are better imo, but wouldnt mind an option to choose. I used a 3rd party software called tmorph back in cata and transformed my human mage into undead with whatever Mount and wep I wanted to see.  So if you're desperate there is probably options! If not just use savory deviate delights and be a ninja or pirate!
---
And now you are paying for resurrecting a game, new development serverside and ongoing support.
---
I want to believe this meme, but my memory of epic mounts and guild drama wont let me.
---
[Totally ignorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qR5tRwvuas)
---
Its not supposed to be fair. Companies don't price things to be fair. They price things at what they think people will buy it for. People will pay $15 a month to play Classic WoW.
---
Lol pointless if you are willing to pay $15 for classic - you are giving the money to develop the next 10 wow expansions that suckers will play.
---
Ggwp sir.
---
I think it would depend on if you get an alt for gathering. If you got one, then I would say Tailoring for gear and Engineering for what it adds.
---
If you dont have an alt for gathering then either mining and engineering or tailoring and skinning/enchanting.
---
I like to have skinning on my mage because of its big aoe potential.
---
This is funny because this is literally what I told my boss who knows nothing about games or even computers. Going to participate in an online marathon, gotta have some time off work. It worked btw.
---
Herbalism and engineering.
---
Nothing has been confirmed yet
---
i mean, what's the cost of the lvl 30 white weapon
---
First thing, disregard the private server supporters of Druid tanking. They are dead wrong, because private servers are dead wrong. 
---
Druid's biggest weakness as tanks is damage spikes, due to critical crits and crushing blows. On private severs, bosses have 5.6% chance to parry, while in Classic it will be 14%. Most people really don't get how BIG this is for tanking. The difference between 5.6% an 14% is a 250% increase in bosses chances to parry and deliver a hastened hit on the tank. Tanks will get hit more often in Classic than on private server...but that is not really the problem.
---
As I said, it is the spike in damage, which will be 250% more often in Classic...and it is unpredictable. Because Druids can be critted and crushed, and because of RNG, a raid boss will much more often land a series of crits on a Druid. It can even be 3 crits in less than 5 seconds.
---
Prot Warriors have Shield Block and Defense cap, and they are uncrittable as long as Shield Block is up...and it is ALWAYS during raid bosses fights. Druids can't do that. While in theory, this can be healed, again, this is no the issue. Due to 250% more spikes that cannot be predicted, healers will either go oom, or will miss a heal, and the Druid tank is dead.
---
I am only talking about Druid tanks and Prot Warriors, because Fury Warriors as tanks in Classic is now a fantasy.
---
You say that you are willing to work hard for a tanking spot. I am sorry, but this will be irrelevant, because you can only do it in a hardcore guild, and hardcore guilds will not use a Druid as a tank. They will use Prot Warriors. As for casual guilds, the problem is that they are casual, and I don't see a casual guild progressing in raids with a Druid tank in Classic.
---
That being said, you can tank all 5 men dungeons (best tank is the Druid in 5 men) and you can off tank trash or raid boss adds. But it will be hard to convince a guild to offer you an OT spot over a Prot Warrior, because an OT is also required to replace the MT if the MT dies, or takes a break from the game, or leaves for another guild. Replacing a Prot Warrior MT with a Druid, in Classic, will stop the progress of any guild.
---
I really don't see how Druids will tank anything relevant in Classic, because on private servers they are capable due to factors that will be very different in Classic. The use of Rallying Cry (most powerful world buff) is available at any moment on private servers. It will be on a 6 hr. CD in Classic, which means that a guild wiping in a raid, cannot go back and pop another Ony head whenever they want, they will have to wait for 5+ hrs. Black lotus on private servers have a normal respawn CD, providing flasks at discretion for everyone. In Classic, Black lotus respawn CD is 4 hrs, which basically means far less flasks available. Raid bosses having a 250% increase in parry chance in Classic vs private servers...and god knows by how much they are off with resists.
---
Considering everything we know now, tanks in Classic will get more damage than on private, they will have less threat applied on bosses, the raid DPS will have to really contain themselves, and healers will really have to be careful with mana usage. Fights will last longer, bosses will hit more often, healers will have a hard time managing mana...adding a Druid tank to all this will simply make things unbearable, and people will say : "Ok, that is enough with Druids. They can't tank raid bosses, they eat too much mana or they get huge spikes in damage and die. Bring a fucking Prot Warrior, we aren't going to spend 4 hrs in a 2 hrs raid just because a Druid wants to tank."
---
We wanted Vanilla. We are getting it. No guild, during progress, will ever use a druid tank for raids, be it MT or OT. After the raids are on farm, it is possible. But it doesn't worth the effort of going hardcore for the sake of tanking ZG and MC when your guild is doing AQ40 and Naxx.
---
I agree that farmbots are bad, but printing money outta thin air is even worse. You can report/ban botters/gold sellers...it may not be the most efficient way but I rather have the economy in wow as it used to be in vanilla than this new bfa pay to play kinda game.
---
Username checks out
---
He is probably a retail player. In retail you dont have access spells from other trees. Like shadow priests dont have any of the healing spells (they only have one spell to heal iirc). Frost mages dont have firebolt or arcane missiles for instance. Its pretty dumb.
---
That link is the classic version
---
That’s because it’s a completely different client.  Does it really make any difference at all?
---
Buffing random people is one of best thing in Vanilla/Classic. It really feels good when you get buffed or you buff someone else.
---
Nah, everyone’s def convinced to play orc now after your rants
---
You realize the sub fee has stayed the same for 15 years? Ever heard of inflation. Mate, you're getting a deal.
---
10% more mauls that won’t connect (especially when you’re desperately trying to establish threat) is a big deal.
---
Skarm acknowledges this.. and basically the solution is farm manual crowd pummeler harder.
---
No download from blizzard.
---
Have an active sub by August 13th to reserve 3 character names.
---
Get ready for poop socking!
---
It’s not. It’s a Razor Axe of the Monkey or Agility.
---
About 30 silver less, but you also have 4 levels more to acquire the gold - which is quite a long time. As I say, the Bullova axe is a good purchase but only when it’s a significant upgrade. As long as you have all weapon skills you will generally find a sword, axe or mace every 2 or 3 levels while questing anyway
---
So the majority is not happy if a minority is playing alone on a server?
---
It’s not classic+ or anything, it’s how the majority of vanillas existence was.
---
It’s not the nicker. It’s clearly a razor axe of agility or monkey.
---
Are you that dense?
---
This ^^ it's not bfa, some specs don't tie you into one specific thing.
---
It's how it used to work. Removing or reducing spell batching would be a change to the balance as it used to be. Not saying that's necessarily wrong, but your critique is false.
---
Thanks ! 
---
Poop socking?😁
---
Just think them as completely different spells. Currently if you play retail you will have tons of healer spells you use. In Classic you won't. Most of time you are probably just spamming that one heal spells with different ranks.
---
This is a good point, but then what should the separate sub cost? And even if its a fair exchange, do they then look at their profit differently and does that effect whether we get *more* support/deployments/projects in the future?  
---
I think the 15$/mo for reliable hosting, phase deployment, and in-house support is fair - even if no TBC servers, etc in the future. No harm in un-subbing every now and again anyway.
---
Krunk no like 15 seashells to see pretty pictures, KRUNK MAKE LOUD ANGER SOUND TO SCARE PICTURE MAN. KRUNK WANT PICTURES FOR 5 SEASHELLS OR KRUNK GET ANGRY AGAIN. Krunk is caveman, Krunk is smartest caveman in whole tribe, Krunk smash other caveman who say Krunk is not smartest caveman. Krunk prove me smartest caveman when he use big rock to crush smaller caveman.
---
Guys when people make a statement and immediately play stupid after, just mock in a way that only 1 side laughs and move on. This is the best way to get through an event like this without injuring your brain.
---
Jesus for the third time, this is clearly a razor axe of agility or monkey.
---
That isn't worth $15/month, maybe $10/month is fair.
---
Lolol just playing for crazy hours - I'm really excited to see how the first 48hrs unfold :)
---
Same! Got the old crew ready! Will be slow , but fun AF
---
Classic was overrated, but it was fun in its own sense. People on this sub are going to jump on you for it. I think BC was the most fun, personally. Classic will always be that ex-girlfriend that you'd never date again but you might fuck, even though she looked better in the past because you were a virgin.
---
did I said somewhere how much I worry about it? Or I wrote "I just noticed it"?
---
 &gt;it’s how the majority of vanillas existence was.
---
What part of "The Patch will be 1.12" did you not understand?
---
World buffs should not apply inside raid or bg zones. Self buffs, raid buffs, consumables and flasks only.  
---
I also do not like the racial imbalance nor the honor system.
---
Probably for the same reason tanks are rare in live, few commit to tanking because in raiding you have 1 mt for 40 people, or 2 for 20 on live... and usually that spot is first to be filled when new raid guilds are forming, because with no tank you have no raid.
---
So people would rather just go DPS, which they probably found more fun to begin with.
---
a lot of classes have no stuns. So its not as op as it would be on live. Very good against rogues...maybe paladins that have a long cd 1 stun. thats pretty much it.
---
It does. The whole lighting is different, even in game. It feels different. I hope they will adjust it so it matches a bit better
---
Don’t like it, then don’t pay and don’t play. It’s that simple! 👍
---
I feel bad for your team then, having someone being a FC who doesn't even know the basic mechanics of the class he plays, yikes.
---
So what class will you be op to with hardiness exept rogues? really...
---
oh, wouw.
---
I agree, classic should cost more, its better value game
---
You’re paying $15 for both.  If you don’t want to play retail, then don’t.  Just play Classic.  What difference would it make if they charge you $15 and you only got Classic???
---
And nobody is forcing you to pay $15 and play at all.  If you think it’s not a fair price , then don’t pay it.  The concept of fair doesn’t even exist in this scenario.  You have a choice.
---
Skinning is easily BiS for lvling if you know what you're doing. At 60 the professions that provide something you can't otherwise buy are the only ones truely worth considering because chances are you can produce gold to purchase potions more efficiently than you can farm mats to produce potions.
---
If you can farm 3 potions per hour, or enough gold to buy 20 potions per hour, which would be a better method of acquiring potions in your mind?
---
Yeah, too bad tbh. I think dw daggers/fists shaman is the most awesome class fantasy.
---
I have been hearing the mobs hit hard. Is this not true? I don't recall elite balancing, but the things that made the TBC pre-patch easy were the free pvp sets and early TBC talents like mangle.
---
Yes, we have. They are bringing Classic back for us
---
It's an old game though and there won't be any development or patches. So it isn't the same. If Blizzard says they will go down the OSRS route of development and patches then it would be fair.
---
Hard and tough? You mean slow and methodical?
---
I keep forgetting there are people that think time invested = hard, but yea, let's add more health and more mob damage to make things a little slower, because once we reach the end it's the end, until they release another expansion 2.0
---
I'm on pvp alliance side, and server population in leveling zones realistically is medium at most. There's enough people to group up for quests, but nothing is swamped like private servers get.
---
Yes, we have heard them say: "You think you do, but you don't"
---
Mate it’s 2019... It’s minimum 1 hour of your wage per month. If you can’t afford $15 then don’t even bother playing. Maybe focus on getting a half decent job than playing a game.
---
Atm it's just a vague hypothetical. Its pretty unlikely given there is very little overlap in the playerbase. You'd have more luck trading plex for gold in classic.
---
Its working is intended. Is it good feature? definitely no
---
It means people who play retail WoW get to play classic.
---
That isn't fair. They need to stick with retail WoW.
---
this seriously needs fixed before launch, it will ruin PvP in a major way, and no don't bother replying to this and raging that it was always possible blah blah, atleast back in 2004+ no one knew it was a thing! now'days everyone is going to use it to their advantage, the game is more immersive if you can't see a large text box with an opposing factions nameplate coming towards you giving you an advantage to escape.
---
is this guy literally fighting bots?
---
holy fuckkk.. people on this thread... How many stuns are there in vanilla? Rogues and paladins and the trinket tidal charm? Maybe I missed some? but not really... its not that good as people think. Fear is waaay more common and works almost like a stun in vanilla. wotf is better.
---
Shockadins
---
Played mage, druids could be polyed to interupt heals but they shifted out, this is why you spammed poly-instantcast dmg- poly - ICD - Poly. Effectively silencing them while damaging their hp
---
I notice that the manual says that dwarfs can play as mage. I have heard this was possible in the beta, but when was that option removed? Did this actually make it into the printed manual?
---
Why would they come out and say "Our current game that is about to drop 8.2 and future expansions sucks... sorry!"
---
It's not their fault it's the market.
---
It's not as if there are other mmorpgs that are nearly as popular as wow, let alone classic wow.
---
Just enjoy them shoving layering down our throats for months after launch since there is zero possibility that the majority of servers will drop to a regular 1 layer server.
---
Indeed it would. Thats my plan. Have a bank alt who can transmute arcanite bars and craft Mooncloths.
---
If I can have fun with more than 1 spec with this class
---
you run out of mana?
---
That's a very black and white way to look at it.
---
If Blizzard restricts where free accounts can go and what they can do, it can make it so that while gold selling would remain a "fact of life" that it would not be profitible.
---
I see no reason to make free accounts only able to talk to party members, unable to use mail, unable to whisper non-friends, and only able to recieve requests not deliver them. There's probably more restrictions beyond that but the point is if you more or less force botters to have to actually pay for their account, you can eventually tip the scales to unprofitable.
---
&gt;Many people have noticed the highly tuned down elite npc’s in dungeons and rare spawns in the open world.
---
No, they have not.
---
What some people have noticed (well, actually other people have noticed it about them), is their inability to differentiate between **memories** and **wishful thinking**.
---
The dungeons in Vanilla were exactly as hard or easy as seen in the Beta. No, SFK mobs did not oneshot casters. Yes, the dungeons could be rushed. Yes, you could chainpull without the healer going OOM if you knew what you are doing.
---
1.12.1 is not easy mode. There is not a single hint in any of the patch notes, that they changed anything about the health or damage of elites and rares.
---
People like you don't remember Vanilla.  
---
You have wishful thinking about some super-hardcore-uber-elite game, to stroke your egos because "I PLAYUED THU HARDCUUUURE!". And now that you get disillusioned, you are coming up with apologetic nonsense like this, in defense of this wishful thinking.
---
Essentially you are pulling a Kellyanne here: "It's time for some alternative facts".
---
Play mage if unsure. Just about the best playstyle in vanilla. Raiding is kinda lame forever save feral druids. Mages while leveling do a lot, free water, and teleport.
---
Gaming can be pretty tough for friendships. This guy is going hardcore I guess. 4 good mates and one sucker? He is often left out if only 5 slots. Or someone sacrifices to play with him. I don't think this guy would think the same when he wasn't invited to IRL sports. Or not invited to AW pub if he is a boring or quiet type. Maybe thats why he posted because he felt left alone.
---
Hunter stuns, warrior stuns, unstoppable force stun and other items, feral charge druid stun, there are more.
---
you have the brain power of an amoeba if you would sue someone over an obvious joke
---
Blizzard is always up with the people and knows exactly what we want...
---
DoN‘t YoU GuYs HaVe PhOnEs?!?!
---
In PvP yes. Also I'd rather drink and take it out on the mage than lifetap and annoy a healer. Especially in 5-mans.
---
I've tried. Jobs just grow on trees right mate?
---
couldn't agree more. im just trying to figure out in my mind why some people are ok with what is essentially wall hacks.
---
*Insert $11 crab meme here*
---
In b4 retail players say it's fine. This needs to be fixed before release, and any addons that make it work should be broken. I used enemy frames through the entirety of Vanilla, and I clearly remember being able to hide your name behind rocks/trees from enemies if you were far enough away to keep the health bars from popping up.
---
Your ability to critically think is lacking to a degree that renders having any sort of productive discussion with you impossible.
---
Bash, HoJ, Kidney Shot, Cheap Shot, War Stomp, Intercept, Charge, Concussion Blow, Blackout, etc 
---
to think that the only time resisting a stun is useful or life saving is vs Rogues is some really casual shit
---
You don't need to share the same opinions as YT'ers. Some people like the new stuff and wont like Classic. The two products don't compare apples to apples anyway.  
---
It comes down to whether we collectively want to regress to earlier design and how much. To this, I am sure we will gain perspective after release. I am not convinced that in Blizzard's mind that Classic is 'better'. They will wait to see the reaction.
---
It was fun to me simply because it was new and a lot of my friends played, felt cool to gank, too. It had a lot of faults, though. Just gotta respect it for what it is and not lie to yourself (not you personally) about how it actually was.
---
Full t2 prot warrior main tank with Thunderfury. You slappin +15 agi or Crusader on that bad boy?
---
It says *simple* question in the title.. That ain't simple at all!
---
Ok then don't pay, or play. Sorry it's too expensive, but something tells me that you're going to sub anyway.
---
LUF is BIS thank you!
---
&gt;Have we heard anything form Blizzard about this?
---
Well, they are making Classic WoW.  
---
What better way to admit _"Okay, we fucked up."_ is there? :D
---
The other key difference is that people know how to play the game now. Back then, everyone was still learning how to play the game. Now, everyone has a deeper understanding of the games combat mechanics. They can recreate Vanilla, but they can never recreate the ignorance that most of the player base had at the time.
---
We have already recruited a cat and a bear for our progress raid.
---
So go nuts. Feral is defenitely a good addition to any raid.
---
If they change the debuff limit they also need to change the difficulty of the bosses
---
And thats not vanilla
---
No debuff limit would make bosses super easy
---
Roight, its clear to me that talking to you is not worth my time. I will not be hearing from you again.
---
Not sure I would call this SFW tbh.
---
I mean it kind of makes sense in the Classic subreddit :)
---
Got the Velen five head.  haha
---
Some fucking idiots take /pol/ too seriously. Any sane person who goes there just goes for memes and shitty banter. Brenton was not radicalized by 8chan. He was a hateful person who already had a skewed world view, and used /pol/ so he could be validated by edgelords.
---
He was the vast minority. There are millions of people on /pol/, yet such a tiny amount of these alt-right attacks that you can count them with your two hands. The remove kebab meme was hilarious for a decade until that asshole ruined it.
---
It’s worth noting that this is the case for any of the healing classes.  You’re much better off going with a DPS spec for leveling, and just throwing on a set of int gear to heal dungeons when needed.
---
150 ms
---
Thinking Devilsaur? Not sure
---
hunter has a 16% conc chance to stun in a talent. Warrior has intercept stun. unstoppable force weapon isnt that fucking strong really. just nieche. feral charge stun wont matter, bash will.. yes. But still with all these its not that gamechanging having 25% chance to stun resist in a slow paced pvp game like vanilla. Played a lot on lh and pvphenhou and orc is not nearly as strong as people make them to be.
---
You could get polymorphed when you were in caster form, when you were shifted into animal you were immune to it.
---
However, since patch 1.4 the act of shapeshifting removed polymorph effects.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/vanilla-world-of-warcraft-patches#patch-1-4-the-call-to-war
---
[quote]Shapeshifting into an animal form will now remove Polymorph effects.[/quote]
---
I'm gonna need some proof that these changes were made. You can't just claim that things should be radically different without some kind of real evidence to back it up.
---
Worth picking up 144hz because it's 2019, not for WoW specifically. It's amazing to play old games (any genre) at a higher refresh rate to me, that's something that has always been fun.
---
Plus, they're more "affordable" compared to a few years back, and it's pretty much futureproofing for when / if you do build a rig that can run AAA games at 144hz, if FPS is your thing.
---
Vanilla wow was never difficult. They have a working 1.12 client for reference. The damage elite mobs do is correct, what is incorrect is peoples memory of how hard the game was. Either because they haven't played the game in 12 years or because they've played on private servers that overtuned damage.
---
Trump is human shit
---
I was leaning towards this. Only thing concerning me is I hear Eng is expensive and it will set back my leveling speed and gold for the mount at 40...
---
&gt;Did this actually make it into the printed manual?
---
Yep, it did. In fact there are many such statement from earlier development phases, that didn't make it into the final product.
---
Example: Page 24: "All characters automatically recover health after combat at a gradual rate. _This healing rate increases if you sit down_.
---
never personally been interested in priest during any expack, but if I was, same situation as Druid/Shaman. You are gonna be forced to heal almost every time. Sometimes they will let a single SP slip in, but you are gonna be stuck on heal spec if you don't want to farm gold to keep changing between raids.
---
I was a rank 13 druid and 11 mage in 05 and 06. Shapeshifting breaks poly. They changed it with cata I think so they couldn't shift out.
---
You want me to say there should be 1.11 servers? 
---
No their goal is to create “the authentic vanilla experience” and I think to have one or two servers with cross realm turned off will help many to get that experience.
---
Mate, why does it matter that much to you?
---
Vanilla was a long time ago. Before the age of Battle.net, before facebook really became popular, before discord. The internet was a different thing than what we have today, and keeping in touch with people through rerolls, faction/server changes and guild switches was not as easy to do since we basically had MSN messenger and guild websites.
---
But TBC was basically the same thing. It's also a long time ago, and we had the exact same tools for it, though facebook was now considered normal in most places. Battle.net wasn't implemented until Wrath.
---
I raided with one guild throughout the entirety of vanilla, but when TBC rolled around my real life friends transferred servers, so I followed. I then joined a guild that I stuck with until Wrath were I took a break for a prolonged period, and when I returned people were gone. Some transferred, some rerolled, some quit and some name-changed.
---
There are people in the classic guild that I would like to play with again, and ditto for the TBC guild. So I've added both, as this might be a chance for me to get in contact with them despite the fact that the developers of the website did not quite think their initial project scope all the way through. Or at least did not realize the potential of it.
---
Is it so frightening to just see it as a way to find old friends that might play vanilla rather than a strict tool for finding people you played vanilla with?
---
Nah, it's clearly of whale.
---
Ye i can get that, i literally only have experience and thus perspective of what the balance is like at a highly competitive level and cycling buffs and nerfs combined with huge time sinks like AP/Azerite just make retail balance an absolute mess for me, whereas with classic i know what i'm getting and it's never going to change.
---
It is bleak as hell if you really like a spec that isn't optimal though, all of them are viable for progression IMO but there's a few you're looking at only taking 1 of if you do take any and finding a spot as that spec is going to suck, whereas as in BfA you'd just join a guild that wasn't looking to clear current tier mythics and they'll take absolutely anything. 
---
Though your point about not being content locked if you're casual in BfA will be true for classic too, only there's no progressive difficulty content outside of raids so you'll be sitting a tier behind. This was the case for a lot of my friends back then that didn't have 30+ hours a week to grind a game.
---
When we're in AQ i'll legitimately be filling all my empty raid spots with rando specs like retri, arms, etc because we wouldn't actually need more than 25 people and it's faster and less effort to invite literally anyone who whispers than to have someone gear check, etc.
---
50 cents per day? :/
---
I’ll take the tommie. I’ve got a over priced wedding in LA and I’m gonna need a high capacity option for all the shitty guests.
---
Well said
---
Gotta level it after your first mount baby :)
---
I'll probably go skinning and tailoring until first mount then switch skinning to enchanting.
---
Thanks I've heard skinning is great too. I probably won't have an ult. What do you think of doing skinning/mining then at 40 drop skinning for engineering?
---
Vurtne is added on Sylvan as EU, is he coming back or is it a troll??
---
I'm rolling horde warlock, I want to do the pvp grind. Is orc warlock really worth it over ud? The stun resists seems too good to ignore for a warlock
---
Just get some addons, they existed back then and some were even more helpful than now. As long as you're not going to records or anything, you should be able to play whatever spec you want. Keep in mind, this game wasn't even hardcore 15 years ago when it was new compared to some games, and people are a lot more creative now with addon creations and whatnot, so as long as you know the classes and basic mechanics you will be fine.
---
It was a tech limitation but it was a tech limitation that the game was designed around. You can't just remove an important aspect of the game because it was a result of technology limits.
---
Id hazard a guess thaat levelling will be a bit harder ghe forst week with everyone competing for the same mobs, ores etc
---
You can argue about spell batching. I could see people discussing the merits of having it or removing it, or making the batch window smaller.
---
Removing or increasing the debuff limit on raids would be ridiculous. The raids are tuned around only having 16 debuffs. Some were tuned around having 8, and those encounters will be easier because it'll be 16 the whole way through Classic.
---
If there was no debuff limit raids would be much easier. So much so that it might not even be a challenge and would need to be retuned.
---
Druid is the only T3 I don't like. Mage isn't great either though
---
Assuming these are truthful and accurate, it looks like ~20% are randomly selected more or less. I wouldn't blame Blizzard if that is the case, the vast majority of people playing betas never report or test shit, so picking previously detailed testers, streamers for hype and old players who are likely to be opinionated seems like a good strategy. Throw in a few random invites so people don't riot and you get a successful beta testing phase.
---
People like that will ruin the experience initially, mostly Fortnite kids and Twitch fanboys who are just here due to the hype.
---
At least they will inevitably leave the game two or three months in and move on to the next big hype, then we can get some proper Vanilla community together.
---
Lmao at least this made me laugh
---
with expansion cycle or server resets there wont be any permanence on live either if this sub gets its will through.
---
Or you could allocate your own stat points when you level up, ya know, like RPGs.
---
It's not a matter of nochanges but the community itself **cried out loud** for weeks **to have spellbatching**, it wasn't there at first but Blizzard listened and implemented it.
---
If you want it changed how about changing your post into something like "sorry Blizzard we've been stupid to ask for this, could you please revert it?"
---
This meme is the bee's knees
---
https://www.wowhead.com/bluetracker?topic=13087818929#131814318748
---
Can't calculate by that since you have
---
I don't agree. To me it can be much more fun and exciting to run a dungeon with non cookie cutter specs-people. I played vanilla and have been gaming for 20 years now if I count my gameboy time in kindergarten. Lets be honest here: WoW is not that hard pre 60. I will happily invite hunters who try to make pet tanking work, tank shamas, ret palas, etc. Others can go for most time efficient BIS and w/e but I don't care about that. I will hapilly invite the cool guy who plays moonkin instead of some child who runs a cookie cutter build and can't deal with frustration. The loot will still come along.
---
Playing is my goal, not getting 'there' in a mathematically optimized way.
---
What happened with unbalanced faction pvp servers in vanilla? Was is all shit? That's by biggest fear tbh...I can't even remeber if I was on a pve or pvp server, but I don't have negative memories...so probably not too much of an issue?
---
I understand. I'm most likely the raidleader for my guild, so hoping the RL finds a spot for me as a SP isnt much of an issue 😂
---
Ehh, Beta is for testing usually. They used to be a service from customers for the big company to find bugs. For Classic you might get a chance to get into the beta if you have a subscription. So you are paying them to 'test' their product. 
---
I mean yes it is closed and stuff, but if you are sick of their @#!$ with BfA, you don't subscribe until August.
---
You have to consider what the tradeoff is. A massive stun resist, or WOTF. Best way is to put yourself in situations where each of those would help. Would you rather resist the warrior charge stun? Or break his intimidating shout? Just an example of one scenario. Both really good for PvP. I personally think the value of a 25% stun resist is stronger in pvp.
---
Dont listen to this guy. There's been actual math, logs and evidence posted over and over regardling memespecs and yet people like scott\_himself keep regurgitating outright falsehood.
---
Nobody claims memespecs can top hybrids, but to say they are useless is so far removed from reality I dont know why these people bother.
---
I'm happy to see it didn't make the cut
---
Wank. Wank like you have never wonken before to ease the pain.
---
I'm happy it didn't make the cut
---
30 days.
---
Quick question: Have you considered reaching out to Blizzard and to see if they would post a link to it on the facebook page of Blizzard and WoW? Might be a way to generate more entries and it's free vanilla buzz for them
---
I can agree with Barrens. I have fond memories of it, but its a dull area that you're in for way too long. Some of the Horde areas feel a bit like after thoughts.
---
But couldn’t they just go ahead and upgrade all the graphics then as well, since that could also just be viewed as a “tech limitation”? Both these things suggested turned out to be essential parts of the vanilla combat system so I wouldn’t touch them for a lot of reasons.
---
 
---
The debuff slot limit adds a complexity aspect to the raids (of what dots/debuffs we should prefer over others), which limits the power of the raid groups in a vital way. To compensate for this they’d probably have to scale up the bosses hit points etc. and... then the snowball is rolling all of a sudden.
---
It’s important to note that Blizzard aren’t intending on creating an enhanced version of Wow, they are simply re-creating the old game as it was for people to test and enjoy (as Ion said). 
---
That being said I’m all for a 1.13 server later on the line, separated from the original Classic servers (Character copy), where Blizzard could implement improvements to the old game. But separated from the original Classic recreation.
---
classic wow is an  entirely rebuilt client, it used like the 7.35 wow client, so it has modern LUA code and features etc unlike the PS vanilla servers.
---
Also we don't have 20fps and 400ms connections. I remember playing with an Australian on Nost and he had tremendous problems raiding because of his high latency, Nost being placed in France. I can't imagine doing complex fights like Razorgore, Vael, Nefarian and jesus christ C'thun is random enough at 40ms..
---
Chinglish seemed to think they were confirmed. He was at the Anaheim Classic Alpha testing and I think he was the only aussie there so probably the only one who asked.
---
since I HAVE WHAT?!?!?! tell me
---
Vin still comes up as the number three Celebrity that plays WoW on [this list](https://www.ranker.com/list/top-celebrities-that-play-wow-_world-of-warcraft_/misterbo)
---
figured we was talking about solo leveling/questing since thats what his post was referring to, the only time i run out of mana in pvp is when I fight 2 players or more at the same time, don't forget you can drain mana tho
---
I see your logic there. Can you buy the awesome engineering stuff for Eng like grenades etc at 60? If not I guess that would be worth leveling
---
It's the same deal for warriors though, if anything the threat of both will diminish. Which will make druids more valuable.
---
Same m8 that's how I found out my feral Nightsaber spanky was female
---
Don't pay it then if you feel you are not getting value for your money. It's as simple as that.
---
Don't you know land is expensive nowadays?
---
If I build a new themepark I will damn well try to cram all the attractions in as small of an area as possible.
---
After trying the stress tests, I decided to just wait with all professions 
---
A big reason for that is limited bag space at low lvl, and having to keep the skill up, like if you leave the copper zones before you have enough skill to mine the next type. If that happens, then your in trouble 
---
Maybe if I don’t feel like lvling a day, after I got my mount, I could start doing some in low lvl areas
---
At least that’s what I think atm
---
Idk if the tournament was even scheduled 2 weeks ago?
---
&gt;I fail to see how this would disrupt the classic experience.
---
You fail to see how the game works on a fundamental, mechanical level could change the game experience as a whole?
---
Tell you what, why don't you place a small cactus on your gaming chair before sitting down? It's just a small cactus, I don't see how it could disrupt the functionality of a 500$ gaming chair.
---
With /camp dungeon trick not working in classic what will be some better gold farming spots at 60?
---
I was thinking of that combo too. Are you going to be doing raiding?
---
And for 15 per month, you can play retail for free! Amazing, isn't it!
---
Average /played time to 60 is about 8-9 days. 
---
So if you play 8 hours a day every single day which is a lot, you could get to 60 in about a month.
---
Yeah pretty much why I didn't apply for beta or Stresstest and bought two different and long games.
---
The waiting would be unbearable.
---
Check out Frostadamus on YouTube. He has a ton of insanely good gold grind videos for all types of people
---
Probably since my friends are rolling on a PvE server and I would like to relax while farming out in the world:)
---
I seem to remember a video of a hunter tanking nefarian. I think, once you're geared, a lot of crap is more plausible, so I appreciate you mentioning 'during progression.' Do you think 4HM should be on that list, too?
---
Stun resist is op as hell, also you get the nice pet damage bonus as orc and the damage boost as well. Or you can have WOTF.
---
Sounds smart. I would make sure you got enough gold for the epic mount first, then swap.
---
They actually started at ICC patch but say they played in 2004
---
I played a lot back in vanilla, like maybe 4-5 hours a night during the week and then like 8-10hrs at the weekend, and I usually levelled 0-60 in approx 2mths.
---
Classic is not a remaster, things that affect the game experience(both of these do) should be left as untouched as possible.
---
Today they are essentially two completely different MMOs and they cater to different people. There's been this void of an old-school MMO that centers more on the community and the world, Blizzard are really clever to catch this market and combine it with the lost WoW fans. When Ion said they've wanted to do Classic for years I completely believe him. I don't know if the Nost guys had any influence on it, I'd like to believe they did but I think there were movements inside Blizzard already.
---
[Myrmidon's Signet](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2246)?

The thing is that you could also just park him in a rested zone for 10 days (until it caps) and rinse and repeat when it runs out, which would increase the realtime you need, but really reduce the /played

---
Should have clarified a bit.
---
Disrupt the classic experience in a negative way*
---
It would obviously "disrupt" it, but positively..
---
&gt;It isn't fair. It should be a separate subscription.
---
Getting 2 products for the price of one isn't fair, but getting one product for the same price somehow is?

Did you run into any solid objects at high speed recently? If so, how many times?

Faction-specific free transfers from over-populated realms to under-populated ones.

God I'd forgotten just how much the classes being listed out of alphabetical order bugged me. Don't know why, just hurts my brain.

Always like crusader for the threat .  the heal and extra damage tended to outweigh the little crit and dodge.

It's the class call.
---
Yeah hunter probably the best tbh
---
Hiya,
---
I missed WoW the first time around, then fell in with some friends who were really into it. They were max level so I did the grind to 60 by myself while they were all doing Wrath raiding, and eventually lost interest in playing by myself. But I've always wanted to have the full WoW experience, so I'm really excited to have another crack with Classic. 
---
Having said that, are there any particular "so you've never played WoW" kind of guides or videos you would recommend? I'm really just wanting to flesh out my knowledge so I can make the most of it come August!
---
By damage boost I assume you mean the racial Blood Fury? Keep in mind that it only affect melee attack power in Vanilla!
---
As much as I agree wouldn't removing the debuff limit require rebalancing boss fights?  It's not something feasible for them to do, despite it being the correct thing to do.
---
Relieved. The game starts at 60 for me. Also probably tired.
---
Warlocks aren't at great risk of eating fears. You can often remove the fear with felhunter, too. Rogues will ruin your day 9/10 times. But if you start resisting stuns, maybe things go differently.
---
You can do it in 5ish day /played if you follow this guide.

Were they really balanced around it though?  Or is that just what everyone assumes because it existed?

The mana cost is absurd, so keep that in mind.

Frostadamus has a ton of really awesome videos about things to expect and a bunch of guides on things all relevant to Vanilla WoW. Check him out!

And while you're at it, look up Madseasonshow. He too had some amazing content and guides! 
---
Best of luck man!
---
I'm not saying he's wrong, but we've already discovered MANY people misremembered what they did in Vanilla despite actually doing it, and being hardcore about it during Vanilla. No matter how good someone was, or what they think they remember, this was over 10 years ago with no way to perfectly replicate it after the fact. Most of these people played private servers for years and had their original memory melded with their current private server experiences. It's perfectly understandable and very easy to get confused, as we have seen.
---
I'm not saying Private Server data is invalid, but it's also not necessarily accurate either. A lot of the game files, which is the ONLY data Private Servers have access to, were altered server-side and no one knew about until recently when Blizzard confirmed it. No one is at fault for this, unless you worked at Blizzard you didn't know that and they weren't about to tell people how to make Private Servers more accurate and appealing.
---
I'm also personally in the camp that if you want to struggle more, then yes, by definition, bear tank is absolutely viable. I am just not going to take what Skarm says with anything but a grain of salt. While you shouldn't outright dismiss all Private Server data, you shouldn't trust it either.
---
I don't want the retail WoW, I just want the classic.  Why should I pay for retail WoW development and patches?
---
The option for updated graphics and animations. I just played my first game of the new wsg in retail and it was the most beautiful thing I've seen in years for wow.
---
If you're questing together it's usually more efficient to burn mana quickly and drink up than conserving it. Mage/warlock melt mobs sooo fucking fast. You can either go destro and just nuke the mobs but my favourite way is to just dot up everything and the mage snares.
---
Also remember that life tap really restores a pitiful amount of mana until way later.
---
Not scheduled but it was announced months ago that there would be multiple duel tourneys once the beta came out.
---
guild banks:
---
yeah ok
---
barber shop:
---
its a QoL change that sits in a building out the way
---
new models:
---
well you already have the new graphics in every other department are you saying that makes it not classic because it looks more fancy?
---
I also stand by this, at least give us some way for the unarmored mounts. Many people prefer those than the armored ones. :/

Soda fucking sucks no way he can make it to the end lol one of the worst streamers along side tips
---
Bruh you have no idea how much work went into this. If you're really that upset over $5 you shouldn't be spending your money on video games right now.
---
Literally why I'm not rolling a druid
---
yeahhh leveling in current wow is rough. you need a friend.
---
According to you. Not according to, say, rogues, who would no longer be able to vanish-dodge.
---
So you value your personal gain over that of others, so much that you would sacrifice the integrity of the game people have been waiting 12 years for.
---
That is some serious egotism right there.
---
Wanna lend me some beta access?
---
PUG raids will take any spec you wanna play. Dont listen to the "they will only take you if" people here.
---
&gt;Taverns/Inns are **instanced**. Can only be entered out of combat. An Inn can host up to 100 players or so before it is **layered** to prevent mass-lag.
---
Instancing and layering. I don't want to play your game.
---
Part of the reason why it might feel tuned-down is because by 1.12, every class had their talents adjusted.
---
This guy gets it!
---
0/10
---
The work is already done, the game was made 15 years ago lol.

Stuns are a bigger threat to a warlock than fear in pvp. Definitely go orc for pvp.

Force people to use battletag #, I recognize someone from 2005 who I used to premade with to rank 14 but I can't add/find him because he forgot his battletag number.

If you had unlimited debuff slots, raids would do LOTS more damage. You'd have to increase boss HP and make other fundamental alterations to the game.
---
I don't think Skullflame would suffice. The flowers hit pretty hard. Maybe with Sapper they would die, but again don't think so (also Sapper has a price and 5 min CD).
---
The most common way of dungeon farming as a warrior is to 2-man DME.
---
Right now they kinda do. The unemployment rate is very low and employers are having a hard time filling positions.

---
Lol, America. In the UK (and I believe most if not all of the EU) when you're sick you just stay home. No allowance, no PTO bullshit. You're sick.
---
this is original 1.12.1 not classic....max details +  console commands for "Maximize Quality and Smoothness"
---
Engineering is actually the cheapest profession to level, at least to about 260 or so, but instead it's just annoying. You need to travel all over the world for the recipes and of course choose between goblin and gnomish engineering (choose gnomish). Don't forget the awesome tools you get while leveling too. I take great enjoyment in disrupting an AoE grinding mage, but with rocket boots and shit he just zips away into the distance before I can kill him. 
---
And about the money, mages are by far the best solo grinders in the game. By far. By really far. In phase 1 it's not so ideal, but when DM comes out in phase 2 they can AoE grind that for huge bank. When ZG comes out in phase 4 or whatever it is they can AoE grind in there for really serious money. I'm talking over 150g/h easily. And once Naxx is out... 2-3 mages and maybe a hunter can clear so many trash packs in there and sell the trash items. I've seen MSAs and the dagger go for 1300g on private servers. Granted they are fairly rare, but you get a warrior in for the MSA, rogue for the knife, maybe a PvP caster for the robe etc and soon you'll be swimming in gold. My mate made 1500g in an evening that way. It's ridiculous.
---
Durotar :(
---
Depends on if you're going solo or not. If solo, I would say easy leveling. Can give you the chance to buy some gear along the way for your harder to level main. 
---
If you plan to play with others though, definitely go with the main first and then level your alt at your leisure
---
Whatever Blizz did to "implement" spell batching.. They fucking did it wrong.
---
O B S E S S E D
---
The range and visibility was extremely limited back in the day. This is easymode in comparison.
---
And no, you couldn't change it by any legal means.
---
Vanilla isn’t white?
---
I respect your opinion, but completely disagree. X-realm BG’s were added in retail vanilla and it was a fantastic update.  Before they were in place, playing on a low pop, or imbalanced server often meant just not being able to play BG’s.  Or you’d get into situations where the same PUG group kept getting matched against the same premade group over and over.  Neither scenario was fun or good for the game.
---
The risk is that the fee would be higher for Classic than retail since Classic is a risk-move by Blizzard. They dont know the number of subscribers they will have and have to set up infrastructure for a launch. 15$ is the original cost and is fair considering the work they put in
---
People do everything they can to make the game as easy as possible: min/maxing; read every single guide online and watch every video; join the beta just to plan their speed-leveling routes; avoid classes that are deemed "less viable" (and create a culture of viability); research meticulously what gear to get, what stats to prioritize, and what talents to take...
---
People complain the game is too easy.
---
Wha?
---
maybe stranglethorn or ungoro.
---
[this may also help ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4)
---
I think a warrior can solo them without shield. Just whirlwind and cleave and kill them before they kill you. When they are not bugged like on many private servers they dont do much damage at all.
---
But this is the Internet!
---
As someone who mained druid in vanilla for the first year, I would highly recommend a different class unless you know exactly what you're getting into and are fully ready for it.
---
Having made a paladin main first, then an alt priest to 60, and then changed mains to a mage... I wouldn’t say the order matters at all. If you’re set on a class, level it and have fun.  No real rules here.
---
What did you find weird? From my perspective the only thing WOTLK and retail have in common is LFD, and that didn't exist until the last patch of WOTLK. The leveling was easier in WOTLK with heirlooms, earlier mounts, etc. but I was looking at it from the perspective of someone who was already level 70 when WOTLK launched.
---
On the other hand, WOTLK still had basic things like weapon skill and the old talent trees.
---
ohhh i've never done darkshore so i dont know the area
---
weren't there really translucent ones in winterspring or am i remembering something wrong?  i vageuly remember them being teal coloured
---
The simple fact is the vast majority of guilds, if they want to clear content, what is optimal will not be a luxury they have to consider. 
---
Hell even in retail WoW if you want to be in a top tier raiding guild (haven't raided for a couple expansions but I doubt too much has changed here) and be a melee DPS you are generally disadvantaged unless you are a rogue. Rogues have consistently done pretty top tier DPS while also having access to very powerful damage mitigation cooldowns that most other melee do not have. 
---
I have no doubt that the hybrid specs were worse in vanilla, then they are now but these types of things still apply to cutting edge progression guilds, they often stack certain classes/specs for specific fights. 
---
Outside of AQ40 and Naxx, Ret should generally be viable it becomes more difficult on a couple fights in those two raids but most stuff, Ret should be fine. A lot of these raids are easy and the DPS check is nowhere close enough that bringing 1 or 2 Ret Paladins hinders your raid. 
---
Easily the most difficult thing to overcome is the unjustified stigma against hybrid specs raiders have and their stupid obsession with meter whoring.
---
He is not assuming. We already know that Classic raid bosses have a 250% increase in parry (14%) vs private servers (5.6%). Boss resistance can also be off by a large margin.
---
But only parry alone will have bosses land more damage SPKIES on a Druid...and that is the big problem. While not impossible to heal that spikes, healers will either go OOM, or miss a heal (spell batching) or simply will ASK the raid leader to use a Prot Warriors, because the Druid puts too much strain on their mana and their sanity.
---
You don't want a tank that goes 7k HP in first second, and 2k HP in the 5th second...rinse and repeat. And due to RNG, that can also be a 7k HP in second one and a dead tank in second 7 or 8.
---
This 14% parry is MASSIVE. Fury Warriors are 100% off the table, and Druid tanks will be undesirable by the vast majority of the guilds, hardcore or casual.
---
There is just TOO MUCH damage for a Druid, damage that is directly related to healers mana pool. If healers will end up with usually 10% mana at the end of a fight with a Prot Warr tank, they will go OOM way mid-fight with a Druid tank.
---
Druids will get, potentially, almost twice the damage in Classic compared to Prot Warriors...it can be healed, ofc...IF THE HEALERS have any mana left.
---
Except the entire raid OVERGEARING the content, Druid tanks will not be a thing in Classic. Because, mathematically, they will need twice as much healing to a Prot Warrior.
---
And during progression, Druid tanks will simply be dead. Either because of an unlucky parry-haste streak, which can also be ALL critical hits, or because they run OOM long before the boss is dead.
---
Either way, Druid tanks will be very, very scarce, and all that they will tank will be MC, Ony and ZG...but not before their guild is at least BWL geared to the teeth.
---
And that is not really tanking...is roflstoming a low tier raid with an overgeared guild.
---
Have you guys been practicing? Seems like a big call if your going in fresh after 10 years
---
No nipples = sfw. FACT
---
A lot of people here saying they don’t really want beta access but if they had it...
---
DM isn't out in the beginning, so keep that in mind. I think its phase 3.

Robin Williams is noted as dead in that listing.

---
Blizzard has a standalone client which is essentially a modded version of the Legion client. The lua code is also different which I really don't like but I'll live with it. People have already started making addons for Classic and quite a few are released. Projects like Luna Unit Frames are working on Classic releases. 
---
You can find a list of addons [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gLrmUgzzIxMExATvLdcjf60nHMwEKd4voWDTQB6JTcA/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0----------).
---
Probably Desolace for me.
---
They were not, people have no idea what they are talking about
---
I am 100% positive its Donkey!
---
Stop trolling dude. A more responsive game is a better experience and more fair for everyone and you know it yourself.
---
I would say I am envious, but being a raid leader in other games, I know it's not as fun as it seems. So instead, I give you my condolences for having to wrangle 40+ people multiple times a week.
---
I will forever be content to be a gloriless but carefree cog in the wheel from now on. Never again will I saddle my leadership horse and wrangle the tards to roam the struggle ranch again. Responsibility-free DPS Raiders have no idea how good they have it.
---
Has anyone tried to run the client on Intel 620 laptop graphics?
---
My going back to play probably depends on if that's possible.

I'm surprised nobody mentioned the main reason.

So I actually used to twink in the same communities as this guy. Really interesting character. Last I heard, he had gone back to prison for a mixture of domestic abuses or something of that sort.
---
im not saying keep your mana at 100%, I just never have to sit down to drink water is all I'm saying. if your mana is at 100% all the time then you're not killing as fast as you should be and if u have to sit and drink water then thats time spent not gaining exp. and questing together you'll eventually have to actually grind mobs for a couple of levels because of the shared exp.
---
I was just surprised that as a warlock you were having to sit down and drink water, I could see that in dungeons and back to back pvp. Life tap is a niche ability, but as an alliance warlock I guess I'd have a lot less mana issues than a horde one.
---
This is the most helpful

I love Swamp of Sorrows. :D Such a nice place imo.
---
I didnt see anyone cry for "please, give us laggy experience"
---
Yes and also only 60% movement speed.
---
Why do you have XP bar after 60?
---
This right here is your average classic wow player 30 days after releasing. Just replace mods with blizzard.
---
Going for a mage first (main, also playing with a group of mates ) then either paladin or druid. Mostly druid just for herb/mining farming.
---
If you dont care about getting geared asap and you already planned to have an alt for farming or whatever, leveling a less gear reliant farming character will make leveling your main more efficient for sure.
---
But obviously that comes at cost of having probably spent 7-10 days /played leveling an alt first. It wont be for another 7-10days /played where you'll finally have your main at 60. 
---
But if you're already working and cant activate your NEET energy I'd say it might be worth it. Ultimately as long as you're having fun who cares
---
It’s not necessary something they have to keep in mind all the time, is it? They are obviously balancing fights around the power level of the raid groups and what they have access to. And back then, we had debuff slots. It’s just about adjusting numbers.
---
Undead have probably the most dope casting animations out of all of the races (both male and female).
---
Have you done heroin? Because I genuinely feel like it's somewhat comparable
---
I mean I've seen that thrown out there but I e never seen any proof fights were designed with it in mind. They could have been but I'd like a source verifying it. Otherwise it's people wanting a shitty limitation in just because, despite the fact removing it would suddenly make a few unviable specs become viable in raids. 
---
That trade-off would be worth it IMHO.
---
Orc is probably overall better. They are probably the best race for pvp overall and the tauren racials while nice dont make a difference 99% of the time. How many times dies a tank go under 5% in raids, usually never and when they do its a wipe usually.
---
It's just for the Inn specifically. It would have to be layered, not sharded, to fit everyone
---
I'm seriously starting to think they're done with stress tests and are opening up a lot more spots/realms from Monday. At least that's what the rumors are.
---
Activate your accounts bois, we might be going in big dick!

Partially depends on your class. Hunters can out-level everyone, while warriors are very slow.

But about a month, assuming you're putting in 8-hour days and not smelling the roses.
---
What is NEET energy?
---
Partially depends on your class. Hunters can out-level everyone, while warriors are very slow.
---
Was removed by the release date. I recall it was in the original printed manual as well (I read it on the bus to school in the morning --- yikes).
---
I wouldn't be so worried about class choice.
---
The reality is... back in the original vanilla, at least up until naxxramas, a good portion of your raid could be absolutely braindead and you'd still manage to beat the boss. That's what 40 man raiding was like. 30 good people and 10 that are just dead weight. Only back then, nobody really cared all that much about the dead weight.
---
When raid size got stripped down to 25 players and tuned for 25 players, that meant the margin for error or bad performance was also cut in half, even more so. Now, out of 25 players you could have maybe two or three guys in your raid that didn't pull their weight and it would be a problem.
---
&gt; Sure I understand we want the authentic experience
---
Spellbatching is part of the experience and its very important in vanilla pvp.
---
Those words are quite deep but again wise :)
---
It is not that i do not trust these but what i got ticked off by was how people seemed to blindly trust blizzard, blind trust is kinda te one thing i cannot stand :)
---
The question remains how much Blizzard will care about input from beta players.
---
I wish this was confirmed, but I always expect the worst to avoid disappointment.
---
I'd recommend you do this with macros (shift,alt,ctrl modifiers). But thats me.
---
If you take some talents in holy like Divine Intellect and then either Spiritual Focus or Improved Seal of Righteousness, then Consecrate and then continue in ret you can effectively tank, dps and heal all the way to 60. Just make sure to keep all your int gear and maybe keep an up-to-date shield. You can of course also just go directly into ret but I wouldn't tank without consecration.
---
Nice, thanks for the advice 😁
---
Why dont you get yourself PC with Archaic 480 graphic card, one crt monitor and windows XP, just so you can have that "classic" experience
---
Basically the same reason why you don’t get your girlfriend into gaming with you or into the same hobbies you share with your homies .. it’ll ruin EVERYTHING
---
He’s not trolling though. If you want a super responsive and flashy experience, I know a game that may suit you well...
---
It makes it “not classic” because it wasn’t in vanilla. None of it is classic because none of these features were in the game in 2006. 
---
Classic is supposed to be as faithful as a recreation to the original game as possible. New models are the antithesis of that, toggle or not.
---
Weird tho, I still have my Stress Test access
---
You clearly don't get it. It's not about the increase in parry-haste, it's about the increase in the frequency of damage SPIKES.
---
And Druids are in a BAD spot already, needing much more healing (hence mana) compared to a Prot Warrior.
---
**A 250% OFF VALUE** of private servers on parry is a big fucking deal for tanks. Prot Warriors will don't give a flying fuck (Shield Block, Shield Wall, Last stand) if they get 2-3 MINOR damage spikes, but Druids?
---
They will get 5-6 MAJOR spikes, which can be crits and crushes, or a combo. Healers will go OOM long before the boss is dead, if a Druid is tanking...if they are able to actually heal that much damage incoming in a short time.
---
A Druid can get 3 crits in a row...and if 2 of them come after a parry-haste...that would be 3 crits in under 5 seconds. Or 2 crits and one normal hit in under 5 seconds. It WILL happen. And with a 250% increase in parry chance, that will be much more often.
---
Can such damage be healed? YES. Can it be healed if takes place 5-6 times in 2 minutes? During progression, NO. Healers won't have ENOUGH mana for that.
---
ur trolling right? Threatening people on the internet with your lawyer.. lmao
---
I would argue that playing duo would make spirit tap very valuable early.
---
Warrior T3 and Shaman T3 wins this actually.
---
You're absolutely right, when solo grinding. In groups it's more efficient to burn mana to kill mobs faster and then drink to recover it. I think one of the signs of a good warlock is to never drink while leveling and it's something you should try and go for. 
---
It also depends on the mage water of course. If he has an unlucky rank then it's pointless of course.
---
The community asked *specifically* for it so they knew what it was.
---
If you believe it's not working as intended, removing it is not the answer, file a bug report with detailed info so Blizz can tune it.
---
Bro you opinion is laughable.  There will be zero guilds this time around who are so strict that they won't allow anyone to raid as Ret, or Boomkin, or Shadow, or w/e the hell they want.  Server first kills mean absolutely nothing this time around.  Do yourself a favor and look up 'viable' in the dictionary because you are using it incorrectly.  Give me 40 competent players and make 20 of them Rets and we'll full clear MC in a day.  That's what viable means.  
---
You're right about few Rets being invited to main raid back in the day, but that was when people sucked really bad and everyone wanted to bring the most optimal comps for progression.  That isn't the case this time around at all because there's really no such thing as progression.  BWL will be cleared day 1 of patch 100% by most guilds who give a shit, using w/e dps specs people want to play.  
---
Did you even play vanilla?  You sound like you didn't and just heard about what it was like, because otherwise you'd know that the only challenge back then was getting people to learn a few extremely basic boss mechanics and not afk in the middle of fights.   Half the people I did MC with used 0 **zero** key bindings outside of the defaults and mouse clicked all their abilities.  
---
If you're looking for a challenge, classic ain't it.
---
I tamed this one: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/look.php?id=tigerskinsnow-transparent
---
It is white with spots and is transparent. Doesnt have prowl, tho.
---
Not sure about the winterspring one. Could be this you remember https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/look.php?id=ridingtigerskinlavender 
---
it's not transparent, the color is very cool.
---
As if gold has any value in retail
---
Alternatively raids will take it a bit slower, bring fewer fury warriors and more mages, rogues and healers, and by an amazing coincidence we end up with something a lot like the real vanilla metagame.
---
Whole thing will probably be over by then.  Best bet is dropping out of school IMO.
---
Oh dont worry I've agonized over the decision for ages. Druid was my main in proper vanilla for ages. Was also my main over last 5-6 years of retail too.
---
Lmao you're right, holy shit.
---
Never ending marathon?
---
No need to kick the dead horse really. I'm sure some people in Blizzard feel uncomfortable, but it's not all black and white.
---
Exactly. People want shitty limitation because they are blinded with #nochanges stuff and have no idea what they are talking about. There is one server on private scene, that implemented batching system. It was so annoying, and people hated on it, they ended up nerfing it to the ground, where it was almost not noticable. All these retail kids asking for this feature will mourn, once it makes it to official release
---
Lol its definitely not that big of a hindrance. Not even close.
---
No, lol. It will make Druid tanks DEAD. And on par with threat with Prot Warriors, if not LOWER.
---
A Prot Warrior have like 20% parry. The more times the boss hits, the more chances a Prot Warr will benefir form Parry-haste mechanics, INCREASING it's threat.
---
Druids have ZERO parry. They will get fuckloads of damage from a boss that will parry-haste 250% MORE in Classic, without benefiting from parry-haste as a Prot Warrior does.
---
It amazes me how most people can't see the entire picture here.
---
Druid tanks WILL NOT tank raid bosses in Classic, especially during raid progression.
---
I don't think this is true. There was batching obviously, but the rate actions were sent to the server was highly dependent on latency, which made the feel variable depending on your connection at the time. 
---
Maybe if you played on an east coast server living in California I could see how you find that its reasonably accurate. Its not though.
---
Good lord I hope they do. I so feel for the aussies on EU based private servers with their huge ping. I can't imagine Blizzard not giving them servers. Also, judging by the amount of Chinese players on private servers it seems like there's a clear market in China and Taiwan, even Korea possibly.
---
1. you cannot use the 1.12 client. Classic has it's own 1.13 client that will probably be available for download 1-2 weeks before launch. the filesize won't be much larger than 1.12 though.
---
2. old addons will not work, unless they are ported to the new client. but considering that 1.13 is based on the modern client, it's easier for devs to port current addons over instead of the ones that have been outdated for 13+ years.
---
I'd nerf Hardiness. I much preferred the reduced stun duration. It was less RNG and it felt more fair while still providing a tangible benefit to the Orc.
---
Maybe that's too big of a change. A smaller change would be letting my wall hop shortcut to SM again. On beta you have to walk the long way around
---
This guy wanks.
---
yeah, I usually solo everything in the beginning I rarely ever do group questing I like all the green/blue/epic drops to be mine mine mine. hahahahhaha
---
Can it cast mind flay?
---
I'm gonna be playing a priest.
---
Good news are, according to the Beta guys, the size of Classic client is just some 4-7 GB.
---
right but only the people who turn them on sees them
---
same with every other graphical feature the water for example is the new water but theres a toggle for the old water
---
what is allowed for addons is more in-line with retail than classic because people know how the wow addon system works and allowing for full classic there would lead to broken shit
---
Actually $15 today would be worth $11 in 2004 ;)
---
Play what you want. The leveling speed issues are greatly exaggerated. "Warriors are slow, don't level a warrior!". People won't be doing UBRS without a warrior, I can tell you that much.

I can imagine tuning it from 400ms to 200-150ms. Anything beyond 200+ is unnecessary shitty limitation

Good luck to you, then, and more empower to you ... I could never go through that again.

You do understand free speech is a protection from government censorship, not people putting social pressure for others to not be assholes just to try to piss people off....right?

Not in Education, Employment, or Training.

i am def looking forward to both

Exercise
---
If you have any hopes of keeping up with the raiding crowd, you always level your main first no matter what it is.  
---
If you don't care about being 200+ hours behind, do whatever you want.
---
LUL what a shitty response, enjoy being farmed average tier player.
---
WoW isn’t worth the hardware change alone, but for a lot of games it is, it’s a lot more of a universal thing to get a 144 monitor. If you really wanted to as well, you could downscale to 1080p 144hz and your PC could handle that just fine.
---
Tbh I was thinking the same kinda. After they performed the stress tests, they know their server capabilities better and begin to give more players the beta.
---
Tho they're definitely not done with stress tests
---
Oh gotcha, thanks!
---
Utorrent, Mediacom in the midwest
---
Well, not really. Here's some advice, ignore whatever the big streamers and content creators say. People like Tips, Asmongold, Sodapoppin etc. really focus more on the entertainment part than accuracy. So don't follow their class guides. If you want to know how it is to play a paladin, ask a paladin. Leveling to 60 on private servers takes hundreds of hours, raiding/PvPing takes hundreds if not thousands more. You can't expect anyone to have in depth knowledge about more than one or two classes, maybe three. 
---
There are discords for all classes that you can join and ask questions. Just keep in mind that they tend to be full of the more hardcore part of the playerbase, so just explain your position.
---
Imagine wasting scatter for a trap, way to be kicked out of premades it's a niche use.
---
Question: Hunters aspect of the chetah, on private servers only direct damage cause the daze effect. If you have curses on you can still use the aspect without getting dazed. How is it on the beta? Does curses and dot damage daze you or only direct damage?
---
Is this why people call me a wanker all the time because they know I want excessively to pass the time until classic?
---
there won't be hunters in my group and i will be horde so no paladins too
---
I will be doing this time round.
---
Everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it
---
If they could prove that encounters were balanced with the debuff in mind, I'd see their point as removing it would require a balance pass at all the fights, which I feel wouldn't be something Blizzard would put the time into.
---
But I'm not seeing any proof, just nostalgia, and #NoChanges nonsense as an argument when that's not a viable argument.
---
Spell Batching I can't comment on as I'm not totally sure what it is or involves or why people are bitching, but if the debuff limit was only a technical limit and not a design choice, then fuck #NoChanges it should be removed.  Most of the #NoChanges idiots are already being proven wrong with how they "think" Vanilla was compared to how Classic is showing it really was anyway, so all of their screeching about changes is a bunch of shit anyway.
---
Haha
---
The point of mentioning when you started playing Vanilla was to dispel the myth that people were chosen for the beta based on account age.
---
It's not a brag, it's data.
---
obviosly hinting at gnome players...
---
Have you tried playing with spell batching recently?
---
I'd say the opposite, it's definitly a good feature since it was in Vanilla, but I believe that the batching window might be a big too long right now compared to Vanilla?
---
Sometimes you just want to turn off your brain mon
---
There are a lot actually, I agree with most of the ones other people posted already. I don't think Barrens is on there. It's bland, sure, but so is the Sahara and other similar areas as well. I don't think anything is ugly or badly designed about it though, so while it's not beautiful or high up on any list, it's certainly not the worst, not objectively anyway. 
---
Deadwind Pass is probably the worst color wise. It's one entire shade of grey. All the rocks, the trees, everything is just fucking gray. It looks like all the trees there want to fuck-stab you. I don't know what that means, but I feel it in my heart. What I don't want to feel though is being fuck-stabbed. Fuck Deadwind Pass overall, but definitely at least in color scheme.
---
I think Desolace is probably the worst thematically. It's got some green areas, an elephant graveyard, some... desolate areas, some structures, none of them seem to go together or feel like they belong. Maybe you can pull together a lore reason why all the segments clash so badly, but at the end of the day, they do clash, and it looks like shit. 
---
As far as models and textures go, Thousand Needles might get it. The majority of it is one long canyon of brown shit. There's lots of rocks, but is that scenery? Is that really an interesting or attractive design? There's a couple horsefucker tents on the way, and then a flat desert wasteland at the end. I admit, I do like the racing area and the small Tauren Tribe up top. I don't hate Thousand Needles or think it's a bad place, but it's got way less going on, and is way more bland than The Barrens. 
---
The Barrens isn't the greatest, but it has a purpose, it has life, it has complementary ecosystems and segments and overall is a well made zone even if it isn't beautiful, so why anyone would think The Barrens is the WORST zone in WoW? I can't say, because it's at least fine and there are certainly way worse ones even objectively. Would you happen to be Alliance OP? It would make sense if you didn't spend much time there you might not have realized how detailed each little area is, and maybe that gives you a bad opinion of it. I don't know. 
---
Just look at it. [Totally a real in-game screen shot and not anything else so don't bother looking any more into it or saying otherwise.](http://i.imgur.com/tqAKxyM.jpg)
---
&gt;But couldn’t they just go ahead and upgrade all the graphics then as well, since that could also just be viewed as a “tech limitation”?
---
What do you mean? Thats exactly what they did
---
How old are you?
---
What did you find particularly difficult? Raiding?
---
Wait, sitting down didn't help!? I spent half my time as a vanilla warrior having a sit.
---
Wait...am I being trolled...there must be a missing piece to this obviously false claim/post. 
---
Can confirm I just shifted out of poly 15 minutes ago on a 1.12 client
---
I hardly had time for an alt in vanilla playing like 12 hours a day.
---
CrY Me a RiVeR
---
How is it a good feature, please tell me. I cant find a single positive reason, maybe you will change my mind.

What do we do?!
---
He is missing the entire POINT : a 250% increase in DAMAGE SPIKES.
---
Druids will die almost as fast as Fury tanks in Classic.
---
The entire meta of threat tanks on private servers will not exist in Classic. Simply because on private servers you can heal those threat tanks (druids and fury warrs) due to a 250% LESS damage spikes.
---
In Classic, Druids and Fury Warrior tanks will be mince meat.
---
haha I actually wasnt aware of that misspelling , sorry for that^^ 2late&amp;lazy to edit that all at this point. Im no native speaker, guess its just some world chat slang that i picked up. 
---
But thanks for the input, well offtanking is totally fine for me, even respeccing multiple times if neccesary. I just dont wanna see my raid preparation effort beeing useless. Those panic buttons tho ... im going to miss them a lot :/
---
A) You need an Active Sub
---
B) It's for selected BETA members only.
---
I find your pessimism most refreshing
---
Nice! Thanks for info. Which means I dont need to fill my ssd !😁
---
At lower levels not really. Warlocks use drain life and life tap to avoid drinking, priests wand a lot, paladins just auto-attack but I know their dps increases considerably if they can burn mana. I see water as a boost really. As a priest I can weave in a few more mind blasts if I have drinks on hand. But also keep in mind that depending on your class it may actually be quicker to use mana conservatively than higher dps and then drinking. Notably warlocks are like this. They can just keep going and going.
---
It’s not a feature at all. It’s just a limitation that for some stupid reason people wanted.
---
It’s like building a 1950s inspired house and insisting on using asbestos to keep it authentic.
---
That's why playing Horde as warrior is a bette experience. You will never, ever have to share loot with anyone in a 5 man dungeon. No other plate users in the party ever.
---
Thanks, So if I were to purchase a subscription right now then I wouldn't be sure that I'd be able to play the classic?
---
Its a closed beta for now.    
---
You have to be very very lucky to get in. There would be a beta selection above the install/play button.   
---
   
---
Official release for everyone with a WoW subscription is 27th august 2019.
---
RWD BMW &gt; AWD BMW
---
Blizzard won’t fix it, they’ll just say it’s working as intended.
---
He missed the most important ones. Either because he is dumb, either because he believes that meta from private will be in Classic.
---
I am not sorry for him, because HE can reroll Warrior anytime he wants, and fast, being hardcore.
---
But people who think that Druids will tank raid bosses in Classic are delusional, and I am sorry for them wasting the time to lvl to 60 only to be asked to heal.
---
Sadly, A LOT of people, that do not have the ability to understand what 14% parry means in Classic vs 5.6% parry on private servers actually means, will roll Druids for tanking.
---
And they will probably be the first ones to quit the game.
---
If you have the felhunter out that is. But yeah I've been stunned a lot more than feared.
---
Think you are right there for classes, shamans can be good, locks aren't bad... I'm thinking multibox after a couple months and just solo quest then first time through.
---
I'm excited to see what kind of names my pets will have. Still remember my boy Agrafazak from back in the day (rest in peace, homie).
---
What? /Camp won't work? That really fucks over the mages good. I like that.
---
No - have an active sub by August 13th to reserve 3 names and be ready for August 26/27 for launch baby!
---
Can confirm Nobody cares, because i care
---
They said beta invites are mostly all done allrdy
---
It gives your more options that the current wow doesn't have. You can vanish death coil, gouge a kidney shot, gouge a blink, etc. It's also why you can't restealth after a gouge, 5.5s gouge vs 5s combat timer but yet the other player can just spam a spell to prevent you from restealth.
---
Overall, it's just the Vanilla spirit, and if you remove that you definitly change the meta.
---
hmm yeah that could be what i'm thinking of!  i'm rolling my first hunter in classic and I think I'm spending the most time considering what pent i want to have haha
---
i assume lupos isn't going to be doing shadow damage so as far as min-maxing goes i'm not that bothered by picking the ultimate pet... i'm more concerned about having an interesting one
---
its a shame there aren't many more unique-looking rare spawns and stuff.  I like boars the best but they're all quite generic looking
---
If you want to do the PvP grind, you'll do it on BGs. On BGs it barely matters, the rogue stuns and warlock/priest fears should go to a healer anyway.
---
In wPvP stun resist seems stronger, but don't let it be the only factor that affects your decision.
---
Do we know the % from Beta for sure already?
---
Before the wall of "the game wasn't hard, you were bad and your memory is faulty" comments arrive, can we please take a second to remember that people's memories of vanilla are not entirely based in 1.12.1?
---
 The game changed a massive amount between release and 1.12.1. Itemization, totally reworked talent trees, as well as stealthy buffs and nerfs, the list goes on. The difficulty changed a lot over the course of vanilla, it was never in a single official state for long. People need to remember this before they completely discount people as "misremembering". I don't pretend vanilla was some amazingly difficult experience, yet we can't pretend this isn't the easiest state it was ever in, mechanics wise. I fully accept that the stats and damage in the beta are near on 1:1 with how they were in 1.12.1, and from watching a lot of 2005/2006 dungeon videos and i'm satisfied mobs are hitting about as hard as they were back then.
---
However, the fact that a mob did the same amount of damage all through vanilla is not a foolproof indicator of how difficult the content was. The fact that content like MC was hard on release was not purely down to people being bad (remember there were guilds with years of raiding experience prior to WoW and they still found a lot of the content very difficult on release) but also down to the fact that classes toolsets were a lot crappier and they had a lot less utility and survivability, and generally accepted something like 20% less dps output (as we've seen from pservers launching with progressive itemization)
---
From the start of this project i was always in favour of starting with 1.12.1 but retuning earlier content to some approximation of the level of difficulty they were when they were intended to be current content, though i am aware simply buffing numbers will never be able to perfectly recreate this. I know people want blizzard to alter as little of the game as possible, but the fact of the matter is that classic is being implemented in a state that was never really in existence(1.12.1 talents, 16 buff slots from beginning), with the exception of the final phase, and I'd rather the content was at least making an attempt to be as mechanically challenging at it was when new.
---
Yeah this is the big difference. Combined with better itemization.
---
Original T1 sets for example were horrible.
---
That’s a fair point you’re making. Thanks for the concise explanation !
---
Ditto that, might as well take advantage that you actually can do it solo.
---
Mage first warrior second :)
---
5 x shamans can melt people in bg's aswell as dungeons I would say and you have everything at your disposal - tremor totems, poison totems, fire nova totems ns-&gt;cl burst from x5 guys also.
---
&gt; That said, it's a lot of fun to walk around with 73% damage reduction and 11k health :) 
---
It's even MORE FUN to run around as a Prot Warrior with 73% damage reduction and 10k health...WHILE being a TANK in the same time, and not some wannabe Druid that goes against the GAME DESIGN and MATH, making 39 people slower in raid progression.
---
Raiding was the easiest for druid because you're just an innervate bot for the most part, throwing a rejuv on the tank(s) every now and then for kicks wo you don't fall asleep ... and you're usually the only druid, so getting your tier is pretty easy.
---
Leveling as a druid is what I hated ... no matter how you decide to do it, there's another class that just does it better ... way better.
---
I read the warrior post this Friday and everyone says it's really painful and not enjoyful to play one until you get good gear in end game. Well I am super casual and will probably spend a year getting to level 60 in which case I would never do any kind of raiding. So 90% of the game will be questing/adventuring and 7% dungons and 3% choosing facial hair colour for my dwarf. Would it just be too much of a struggle to play as a warrior then? considering I will not get to experience it in "full effect"? Can you actually enjoy the questing part for warriors also? And I'm only creating one char and sticking to it otherwise i'll end up in a continuous alt-loop, that's why i'm doing some proper research prior of release.
---
It's a free game with retail wow.
---
Like buying call of duty infinite warfare, so you can play cod 4 remastered.
---
Giving the people who support blizzard and play retail a free game, and the people who quit blizzard and went to play private servers what they want aswell, but making them pay for it.
---
T2 is the mitigation gear, so it's logical to do +15 agi. And when you start wearing more threat gear, swap to Crusader :D
---
It's listed under phase 6 with Nax.  
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346
---
Not Vanilla, but private servers, which are so wrong, it cannot be even understand by most.
---
But the mounts do the mounts have a skill requirement to buy them. Even if they were not 60 and have the training they could still buy it?
---
Well said!
---
Sorry I blocked you first lol
---
What's the usual online on Beta anyway, didn't someone do a /who estimation?
---
Yes, they fixed the shadows and some ground textures. I was more intending on the updated character models etc. But yes, I should have expressed that sentence differently.
---
You don’t need BiS to clear MC and BWL. They are not hard. Just find a guild that is not about elitist min/maxing but about enjoying the game. And you’ll be able to clear everything. It might just take a bit longer then the hardcore guilds take it to clear it.
---
Gonna book mine on Tuesday. Fingers crossed I get it
---
Interesting - might still be doable without the sit crit?
---
That info is wrong man. Disregard it.
---
Read one of my other posts here, and you will see that Skarm is living in la-la land.
---
Did you just not read what I said? That doesn’t matter. Like I said, toggle or not they weren’t in the game, they don’t belong in classic. It’s that simple. I’m glad to have the old models back because they’re not even in retail anymore.
---
If you want new models play retail. If you want a barbershop play retail. It’s all there for you, go for it. These changes aren’t what classic is, that’s literally why there’s two versions of the game now so everyone can enjoy the version they want.
---
I always ensured I was on different servers than my co-workers in vanilla whcih worked out well.  We had our watercooler moments and discussed raid strategies but it never went further than that.  Most of that talk died off around TBC/Wrath for me.   I can't fathom what it would be like with battlenet, the idea that my coworkers can see me logged in would drive me nuts.  Even now I always appear offline in steam, origin and b.net because I want to choose when I'm visible.
---
And then there was the other guy who said they may consider additional content if players wanted it.
---
Blizzard has no idea yet.
---
It's much much faster in BGs. Evidence is that the southshore v hillsbrad battle disappeared immediately after WSG and AV were released.
---
It sounds similar to Triple Triad games in Final Fantasy 14, maybe that would be a good starting point for thinking about how this idea would operate in WoW
---
&gt; it's heralded as some form of RPG specialization.
---
yeah, classes actually having different strengths that go beyond "I can debuff the green stuff, you can debuff the green stuff" is such a dumb RPG aspect? Who wants choices to be meaningful? Not me sir, I dont want RPG in a MMOPRG. I want retail balance, because retail balance means I can push the exact same buttons without even knowing what char I am currently playing. Now THATS good class design.
---
It does work you just have to be in a Group with your alt character and then log onto them to reset
---
ghoul boys been everywhere recently
---
Yes I personally loved Gwent, the Card Game in FF8 and more than I can think of right of the bat.
---
4HM is actually a place where one or two druid tanks are arguably optimal, since it takes the gearing burden off the warriors. The back two horsemen don't hit that hard and there's a trinket from ZG druids and warriors can equip to make sure their taunt doesn't get resisted.
---
That doesnt contradict what he is saying tho. I dont know who is right and i dont care but if blizzard says its right it might just mean right for 1.12 which is the patch runs at while OP is claiming that it was harder before 1.12. I dont think he is saying that the numbers are off for that particularl patch.
---
Damn dude. It sounds like you might just actually want to say something to make things a bit easier for yourself. Consider the idea that 'play what you enjoy' could also mean play what you WILL enjoy.. as in dont play a warrior if it's going to be inefficient and not an enjoyable experience for you if you're struggling. Might actually make sense for you to play a class that will be a bit easier for a more casual playstyle to do things efficiently! Just my 2 cents before you get bombarded with play what you want to play shenanigans
---
I agree that it should be a different subsctiption. Your post still doesnt make sense because the price would still be the same and rightfully so.
---
from the video in the op https://youtu.be/ctyE_pf-AW4?t=152 (2:32 in)
---
"did you intentionally balance around the debuff slots?"
---
"it was certainly a factor, yeah"
---
i get that it isn't a blue post-level communication from blizzard, but it makes sense and he confirms it
---
Why does there need to be a source? If they up the debuff limit, the boss will take more damage. Isn’t that a logical assumption?  Bosses get tested with those debuff limits, it’s logical to assume if there wasn’t a debuff limit, at the very least there Heath would be different
---
It's true that leveling a warrior can be difficult and the repairs expensive, but it is also a lot of fun. You just have to be more vigilant about upgrading your gear and waiting an extra level or 2 more than other classes to start certain dungeons. If you're going to be super casual, that could actually play to your advantage as you can always recruit higher level players to run you through dungeons for gear or to help you with your mid-30s warrior weapon quest.
---
Great addon!
---
Dont play it. I agree that it should be a different subscription but not because of the price. Personally i'd prefer to pay 20 for cladsic instead of 15 for classic+retail.
---
I do have both :)
---
That's enough for me.  No changing it then.
---
Here’s a question I have though: what happens after a few years? Is there going to be a Burning Crusade release too? Are the things that make the game undesirable going to be released again making the whole experience one giant circle?
---
The best thing to do if there is going to be expansion releases is to think what is working for classic. What has brought all these players back and then apply them to any expansions.
---
Yes it won’t be the exact same thing as when the expansions came along, but all the things that Blizzard thought was good for the player base won’t have to be placed in them.
---
Am I talking shit? Anyone else agree?
---
I'm glad that they didn't implement this in the game. I personally don't think that a card game like this belongs in WoW and certainly not Classic WoW.
---
I think it's a steal, both versions for one sub price.
---
NO CHANGES!
---
If it was a tanking item beginning with S, it could have been the [Stockade Pauldrons](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14552)
---
90% of the people on this subreddit have no clue about the game, you’ll be fine playing a warrior. In pvp you won’t have a good time 1v1 though unless you get gear. That being said there are much better classes for casuals that do more with less like mages and rogues, but if you want to play warrior you should play a warrior.
---
And maybe they dont want to play classic at all. Just like classic players can play retail for "free", regardless of if they want it or not.
---
Who let that moron tips organize it?
---
Last thing we want is to give his dead stream more publicity.
---
Really? Levelling as a druid is very fast and comfy. Stealth, heals and such gives you speed and low downtime.
---
Shadowpriests are crazy good in PVP in vanilla, they will be crazier than in this video
---
Yes if you spend alot of time lookin at the screen it is
---
That goes without saying...
---
Please elaborate on why it would be bad for classic to have this in it? It would still be heavily in game world and not something you instance away into.
---
And here I thought he was dog shit lol
---
Drinking is not really expensive. The main issues with it IMO that it's  a bit bag-consuming and requires you to remember that you need to buy drinks. 
---
Perhaps it is also inefficient as /u/LiterallyMrRogers says, but I'm not sure. I see [Joana drinking while his pet attacks on 22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAA86_GuQ7E&amp;list=PLMeJnlp72R7p-X7PgsMFqqjPtcxhF7kB_&amp;index=6).
---
It’s not like modern WoW is an “embarrassment”. It’s a very visually appealing, smooth gameplay experience. This subreddit obviously wants to go back to vanilla and that’s fine, too. They also don’t cater to different audiences, it’s perfectly normal to enjoy both and plenty of people will do exactly that.
---
Things like flying mounts, LFR, etc...were things the community mostly wanted when they happened. Enough people don’t want them that they see a money-making opportunity in Classic. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. So stop with all the overdramatic hate.
---
Well 5x Shaman is pretty good for Multibox I believe. But I am curious, how Viable it is later in Raids and stuff.  
---
I mean with 5 Shaman you can also prob. do Solo Runs of something. Just make one a "Tank" and have the other ones Macro-Heal it. WIth \[@NAME\]
---
Probably would suggest platinumwow on their class series. His content is really funny too :)
---
Barrens Chat used to troll about GW Bush all the time. Don’t get your panties in a wad. It’s always been a cesspool for triggering snowflakes and sparking arguments.
---
Yes - they kept some small graphical changes from the BFA client, such as water and shadows effects. (And I don’t like that)
---
My point was that if they could have implemented the BFA look for Wow back in 2004, they obviously would have done so. And I’m mostly looking at character models and spell animations when discussing graphics.
---
It will always narrow down to the question:
---
Are we recreating the game or not?
---
Thanks for the input ! Well we actually wanted to roll on horde side so wf + lack of salva wont make it easier^^  what i remember from my rogue time is that the whole mc phase  we rogues got big dps boost from the loot there and on single target almost always out dps-ed the warriors, later  in bwl they catched up. But this might be just my own raid bubble dunno where is the average. And we were very unlucky on those ony axe dropps , loot rage was high with the furys^^
---
Sorry, didn't realize YOUR idea of fun is the correct idea. Damn, my bad man.
---
troll on horse. warrior rogue hunter mage priest shaman. only miss motw/bres and curses/banish.
---
I already commented but rhere is another thing. You can play classic for absolutely free. Since you get access to bfa you can go farm gold in bfa and pay for your sub with gold. There problem solved. Like you implied in your comments you dont have a job, spend time farming in bfa and pay for your sub with gold, its not hard at all to do.
---
Thou shalt not speaketh its name
---
Yeah but theres no point in naming yourself mugmug if the victim cant see you doing it
---
Checked it out still not for me sadly looks like I'll wait for next X-Pac tbh.
---
&gt; They added the large window because the community begged for it...
---
My guess is that they added it because it turned out to be easy and turned out to be good for server load.
---
There were a few vocal goofballs who were leading the charge for batching, but their arguments were all terrible and boiled down to "I want to exploit this hidden mechanic for tiny, unreliable advantages in PvP" which seemed to me like an idiotic reason to make everyone play a laggy game where your actions get held up half a second for no reason.
---
But if it turns out that it allows hundreds of toons to cluster up without unacceptable lag, that does seem like a decent argument for it. The question is how much of the performance improvement in crowded zones is due to batching, and how much due to Classic just being a slower, simpler game than BFA.
---
One of the best machinima ever realised, and the very best movie in the Warcraft universe by far! Dont forget to watch the two first movies Tales of the past 1&amp;2 even if they are a bit clumsy compared to the third one. 
---
All WoW classic players are Lok’Narad to me (Alliance included)! See you soon on EU PvP servers!
---
Just tried this at pserver. At level five, starting quests are still green and you will get full rep amount. 
---
So, it will slow a bit your leveling speed, but its still good  investment in mount rep grind.
---
Elwynn Forest, Westfall, and Duskwood all suck imo 
---
Durotar is also pretty lame
---
Exactly the same!
---
So you don’t have anything serious to say?
---
You can vanish death coil without this. You can even vanish the damn pompyro mage. And you dont need spell batching for it
---
I had a 40+ warrior and a 60 warrior in vanilla and never knew people thought they were bad levelers until recently. You’ll be fine.
---
How id that different than gold being exchanged for feal money that will happen anyway?
---
It's true. See the outcry and debate over not-actually-taken-away flying.
---
I hope blizzard is able to quickly shutdown all gold sellers,
---
Rough as in boring as fuck
---
We SSD users need to help each other :)
---
Already found some ppl from my premade grp in 2005 , great great stuff
---
Damn, this is a fun one to think about. I think Troll would win out overall, but mu god would I love to see a 40 man raid of orcs storming through BWL
---
Really?  Somewhat civil?  You're literally the one who started calling people shit in this thread.  Gtfo moron.
---
Easiest way to implement a card game for Blizzard would be to allow you to start Hearthstone games vs people you meet ingame  but that wouldn't be as immersive.
---
I'd prefer the old wow tcg to be implemented with just the Heroes of Azeroth set to keep it classic. Including the raid decks for griup content.
---
To keep it fair card packs should be sold by vendors, maybe in tiers. 50s for a basic pack and 1g for a rare pack etc.
---
There would be too many balancing issues if cards could drop in raids for only 1 person or from high end dungeon runs.
---
Where did the bad druid touch you?
---
You've ranted eight times at least on this thread alone. Is this a "someone is WRONG on the internet" thing?
---
You're leaving out all sorts of benefits from druid tanking, so I'll just [leave this here](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/#introduction).
---
That’s not even the right icon for the nicker...
---
You actually will loot a fair amount of drinks as well ... vendor and mage are not the sole two sources of drinks.
---
I think Hunter-Management might be hard on Multiboxing, for Solo Play it is prob. one of the best.
---
Me when I refresh reddit every 3 seconds and no one has posted anything for me to get into
---
What about wide-screen resolution? With it you can see more, so the game is easier.
---
What about the lag? Back then a lot of people had shitty internet and experienced lags all the time. So maybe let's implement an ongoing lag of let's say 300 ms for everyone?
---
once BGS come out the only option is really BGS if you want to rankup.
---
No, orc pets deal more dmg...
---
Ye but you can tank them with 2 warriors too.
---
Are people not allowed to look forward to a game themselves? Why would you be hyped because someone told you to be? I'm looking forward to Classic and I only started getting into WoW when WoD was the most recent expansion. A lot of people are looking forward to it specifically because they haven't played it, like with the vast majority of people who look forward to the release of any game.
---
Dont orcs get bonus pet damage? Is that just hunters?
---
&gt; did you still die a couple times taking on multiple mobs or did it feel easy like most of the streams i have seen?
---
I've died more than a couple of times from multi-mobs. So far I've rolled mage, rogue, and a pally (which I knew from vanilla, so I know how to handle that best in fights) and as soon as you get two mobs, it's brown pants time, but you might be okay... three, time to run. 
---
It might be a \*little\* easier than first release, but it's still challenging, especially if you can only do body-pulls like a paladin and mobs are packed closely.
---
Yeah ingame is crucial! 
---
World drops and no raids drops I also agree with!
---
My only thing here is that MOD really will only help you get more openers. 
---
It sort of depends but if you miss your opener you may have enough kit to reset the fight in your advantage.
---
Lethalitys dps increase is nothing to sneeze at tho. 
---
Both have strengths but I’d pick mod for re stealthing with gouge.
---
Gimme the guides, gimme the memes ams gimme mah got daym WOW ALREADY!!!
---
Yes, warrior is a struggle compared to most other classes because you have limited escape options and no self healing. If you put yourself in a bad situation as a warrior while levelling your playbook is not as easy as, "Sprint and Vanish", "Sacrifice Pet", or "Nova and Blink". What this means in practice is that you have to be mindful about your positioning when you engage mobs. Sometimes it's fine to charge in, but a lot of the time you have to rely on pulling with a bow.
---
I enjoyed my warrior during levelling, and you definitely feel like a warrior. Switching stances, putting on a shield, and hauling ass is a quintessential warrior move no matter what level you're at.
---
You straight up aren't going to be burst down due to parry haste, even if you get that unlucky, with a string of three crits, you'll still survive. You don't get instagibbed for your entire health pool, it just doesn't happen.
---
Druids only take roughly 12-15% more damage over the course of a fight than Prot warriors, but they take less damage on average per hit.
---
Those videos are so amazing , i always have a blast rewatching them , that poor little gnome mage :(((
---
Yeah lol all would be in weird ranges
---
This'll be the case for some people, sure, but you don't need massive amounts of handholding. I reckon more people who never played it will enjoy it than hate it tbh.
---
We need more of these “classic life pro tips” now that many of us are adults as opposed to kids/college students like we were last time around.
---
I'd love a CSV file with that data, so I could apply some recently acquired data science skills on it! I could generate some cool charts for you guys and even discover some not so obvious insight about the data itself. Any chance of you guys making the data available? :)
---
BINGO👌
---
Just dm me.  I do have a discord that I'm setting up.
---
If it's about PvP specifically, don't think about theoretical DPS. Lethality increases your average DPS by 3.3% but increases crit backstab damage by 15%. That easily becomes a couple hundred damage per backstab, and in PvP, the damage you deal that actually matters is mostly backstab and eviscerate. You want backstab to do as much work as possible because you're not standing there with SnD racking up sustained DPS on a boss.
---
It's kinda like with mages. Improved CoC increases CoC damage by 35%, which is little to no actual DPS, but a huge difference in PvP where CoC is something like a third of your damage. Same with rogues and backstab: if you're not landing backstabs, or they don't crit, you probably aren't winning anyway. Critting backstabs is how you deal most of your damage, so increasing that by 15% is a lot.
---
I’m vanilla rank 14 chump; [you](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/330/806/8fc.jpg)however need to do some soul searching
---
Why would they design around infinite debuffs? That doesn't make any sense. Raids are designed around how powerful the raiders are, it doesn't make any sense to just pretend that the raid has infinite debuff slots.
---
Just dm me.  I do have a discord that I'm setting up
---
I like cats. For me it's fitting best RP wise and it's good enough for leveling and solo grinding.
---
Nightsaber from Teldrasil (rare lvl 9) to start with.
---
Orcs have a 5% increase to pet damage yes. It does apply to Hunters and Warlocks. However I was just clarifying that Blood Fury does not increase a casters damage
---
&gt;That’s because a good portion of this subreddit has never actually played classic they’ve just heard enough about it to make it seem like they have.
---
The hilarious thing I'm seeing on beta is that so many don't realise treasure chests were a thing. I constantly find them being ignored, surrounded by players. Works for me!
---
How mandatory do you believe flasks will be?
---
I used to play in Vanilla up to 4hm, but can't remember using flasks on each raid, more like, when it was a really hard boss.
---
Anyhow, today is a whole different story.. People are more min / maxing and conscious about the effects of min / maxing. With lotus theorising reading 150-200g~ per lotus, it is safe to say a flask will most likely reach 20-30 % of a epic mount cost.
---
 I have two questions.
---
1. How mandatory do you believe flasks will be?
---
2. If you plan to lead/be an officer, how much will you demand from your raiders?
---
Fraid so, I did the same, reactivated sub got lucky enough for the stress test. Just hoping with the next wave coming in a few days that I'll get into the main BETA.
---
What did he say?
---
Pretty odd they don't have a CDN (not CMS) domain CNAME.
---
Yes they would and honestly i wouldnt care one bit. I understand if some people do but i really couldnt care less about the graphics.  Just like i dont care about playig in HD this time around.
---
You realize the parry changes affect Prot warriors more, right? They'll be outputting even less threat, while the threat benefit gained from using a feral druid or a fury-specced sword-and-board warrior will become more desirable to keep up with threat demands?
---
Each tank is still going to take a similar amount of damage relative to each other.
---
Druids only end up taking 12-15% more damage than a prot warrior over the course of a fight. If anything, a Prot warrior is going to struggle more with parry haste as they have more opportunities for attacks per second, with those attacks chunking their health for more, as they take on average more damage per hit than a druid.
---
Once you got some decent spelldmg gear, like T2 set, you can try playing as a shockadin spec, where you use holy shock for dmg and you can still heal well.
---
What makes you a fan of modern WoW
---
Idc, but I'm just trying to not let my blood pressure spike from the thought of a 40 gnome raid running around without getting pummeled
---
Why would they?
---
I honestly believe best honor/hour will be small groups of 3 ppl roming I  level 48+ areas. Depending on how guards spawn another really good way to farm honor will be ganking at a level 48+ areas flight master. This is dependent on how elite gards spawn when opposing factions civilian sees you
---
Ouch.
---
i know the right one is the rarespawn, but the left one just looks so much better
---
Does bug me to hear people chalk-up all the interest to nostalgia.
---
Had to fix something!

Wouldn't you need a bank alt in a moonwell to make that cloth? Never leveled tailoring but I thought you had to be in o e to make that.
---
I don't necessarily think it's "bad" for the game, I just don't think it fits in the game. My feelings about this is more or less the same as when they introduced pet battles. For me World of Warcraft is not about sitting at a campfire and play card games or pet battles for that matter. For me WoW is about War and dominance and I'd much rather have Blizzard focus on that.
---
That the best you got?
---
Trolls are the best.
---
Humans aimed high but couldn't pass second boss in MC due to no tranq shot.
---
Dwarves should be fairly decent, you don't need sheeps until Nef. Same with Night Elves.
---
Orcs should be fairly decent - they can fear instead of sheeping (easier than priests).
---
Undeads could work too, priests are the masterhealers anyway. But wait, again no tranq.
---
If it's 40 Taurens, make it 40 druids for more epicness.
---
Pretty much what you said already. When it's a really hard boss. You can easily get away with a battle/guardian elixir and in my opinion it makes more sense to save that gold for some of the really strong BoEs and whatnot
---
Well first of all no and second of all changes
---
BGs are effectively the only option, though you can start looking around populated areas between queues.
---
30 cap? I've been diving into streams to watch someone running scholomance and wondering why noones at 60 yet. When are they raising the cap?
---
It was in Wrath ... not in vanilla though. You wanna heal or cast spells, you'll be oom in 30 seconds or less, and you can't wand like other casters. Wanna level cat? Your damage is puny even in full dps gear and you're squishy and not dodgy like a rogue. Then you use your entire mana bar to cast a solitary rejuv ... the good news is your mana is fully replenished in the 5 minutes it takes you to kill the next mob (assuming you only pulled 1).
---
At least that was my vanilla experience.
---
You may wanna work on your reading comprehension. In any way, get blocked.
---
I have already preemptively deleted all of them from Battle.net and Steam.
---
I love hunters and bows, easy peasy :)  
---
Hrmm but stealth and more stuns looks fun, maybe ill try rogue...but...I kinda wanna dot everything up might help surviving more if I drain life as well.... Yeah Warlock for sure.  
---
Then again, I wanna zooom forward with blink, i love mobility: Mage, easy choice! Done  
---
.....Oh but I am gonna need to offheal. Druids do everything! Yeah druids they do it all so I cant go wrong.  
---
I die a lot though, maybe a bubble would be best so pally for sure, duh. Then again if I have a pet I can just survive from a distance and kite!
---
Hunter it is........or warlock
---
This will also affect the brightness in game though. My brightness is ok, thanks for the tip.
---
Dwarfs.
---
You have tanks, you have dwarf priest and dwarf paladin, you have hunters for tranq, you even have rogues. You honestly don't need casters for shit in vanilla.
---
Disagreeing with you is not trolling.
---
But hey, we already taught about the egotism. Thanks for providing further proof.
---
That's a much better approach than asking for it to be removed.
---
From what I remember, some things to consider for Shamans:
---
Resto is going to be the most viable in raids off the bat.  Ele and Enhance will feel lackluster early on and min maxing with consumables and shit is a lot more important than with some of the other classes. Generally guilds would only take like one Enhance Shaman to get the Windfury totem buff for your party members. Keep in mind totem management was also a lot more tedious as well.
---
Glad there is someone else who noticed it too!

With Isboxer and IWT in Classic, you can multibox more freely.Shamans are strong however I look.
---
Some people really need the /s I guess...
---
Why would you want to play a character in a game with a character creator that isn't visually appealing to you in some way?
---
I would, but thats what I have been doing for quite some time now. Some even in this thread if you are willing to look around. But Im almost sure, if you have the opportunity to experience spell batching recently, you would be against it
---
Imagine being so triggered.
---
A fun event with practically everything that makes classic fun banned rofl.
---
40 is too early to be swapping around professions.
---
Maybe they will update the game in the future we dont know atm and we are lucky to have an official classic server 15$ month is nothing for the amount of hour u will play per month. Stop ur netflix sub and u are g2g.
---
Also: "Releases August 27, 2019"
---
The same people advocating for this type of mentality incidentally are the same people claiming vanilla was “easy” and “simple”. I can’t see how 12hrs or raiding and prep is in any way easy or simple.
---
You aint missing anything - check out the banned items and rules etc it's a fucking joke.
---
Twins can be tanked by shadowpriests as well. Not as good, but it's doable.
---
But the world of azeroth holds children and civilians and you essentially are a free man joining the army. The army even in World War 2 had times where they had to feel like normal people and during these times they whipped out a deck of cards or a recordplayer just to remind them of what they were fighting for. 
---
Surely this could fit in the world of warcraft aswell?
---
&gt; We already know that Classic raid bosses have a 250% increase in parry (14%) vs private servers (5.6%). Boss resistance can also be off by a large margin. 
---
Just for the sake of clarity, going from 5.6% to 14% means multiplying by 2.5, which corresponds to a 150% increase, not 250%. Multiplying a price by two means adding 100% of the price, not 200%.
---
Also, higher parry rating would rather benefit druids because they have a lower swing timer than prot warriors, which means they will get parried less times during the fight, which means the boss DPS is going to be less spiky. The only real issue would be threat building at the begining, but that's not a big issue on most fights.
---
&gt; Except the entire raid OVERGEARING the content, Druid tanks will not be a thing in Classic. Because, mathematically, they will need twice as much healing to a Prot Warrior. 
---
Where did you pull these numbers from ? "Mathematically" ? I'd be happy to see the maths behind that, because it's actually literally mathematically impossible. Even assuming the bosses would have a 100% crit chance on Druids and land only normal attacks on a prot warrior, which is as far of reality as it gets, it still wouldn't be such a difference as Druids have a better damage mitigation than Warriors, since they have more armor.
---
Vanilla content is overtuned on PServers. Druids tank won't have any issues on most fights. The content will most probably be super easy. I wouldn't be surprised if MC was cleaned within the first 10 days of launch. The rest of raids will be cleaned on the day they launch, as simple as that.
---
You cry far too much about druids possibly taking your spot.
---
&gt;No, lol. It will make Druid tanks DEAD. And on par with threat with Prot Warriors, if not LOWER.
---
&gt;A Prot Warrior have like 20% parry before MC, which increases after BWL.
---
Prot warriors will suffer from the same parry increase on bosses, resulting in the same average % of attacks being parried.
---
&gt;Druids have ZERO parry. They will get fuckloads of damage from a boss that will parry-haste 250% MORE in Classic, without benefiting from parry-haste as a Prot Warrior does.
---
The chance of a boss parryhasting an attack, which the prot warrior then parryhastes is so low and such a negligible amount of threat benefit that it by far does not outweigh the benefit of a Druid.
---
&gt;Druid tanks WILL NOT tank raid bosses in Classic, especially during raid progression, because healers will go OOM, or because the Druid dies due to a bad streak of crits, which will be more often in Classic (250% more of often at least), and healers won't have enough time to land a saving heal.
---
It's 2019, if your healers are going oom then they're straight up bad at the game and not using mana pots. Druids have smoother damage intake than Prot warriors, which is spikier due to the nature of their avoidance. They get hit for more per attack than a druid, but have far more of a chance to avoid or slightly reduce damage taken via block, dodge, and parry. This arguably means that your healers get to be a bit more efficient when healing your Druid tank, because pre-casted heals won't go entirely to overhealing when the warrior parries, dodges or blocks.
---
&gt;Warriors will get SMOOTHER and far LESS big hits...and they won't give a fuck anyway, because Shield Block removes Crit entirely. And if SHTF, Warriors can use Shield Wall and Last Stand.
---
Absolutely untrue. Warriors can still be crushed, and people don't stack defense like they used to back in the day. Threat is the biggest issue tanks face.
---
&gt;And that is WITHOUT considering the Rallying Cry buff being on a 6 HOURS CD in Classic, vs no CD on private. With Rallying Cry, a Druid, while still getting shitloads more damage, at least benefits from AP and crit....A SINGLE WIPE, and the slight threat increase due to Rallying Cry is +5 hours away.
---
That also applies to a Prot warrior. You seem to do this a lot. Point out a flaw in Druids which also applies to Prot warrior. Like how you say the 14% parry chance on bosses only affects Druid and Fury threat, but not Prot.
---
&gt;Prot Warriors, without Rallying Cry, will still be AS TANKIER as before...but have similar or better threat over Druids
---
Straight up untrue. You say this without any form of evidence to back up your claim. 
---
Again, I'll invite you to join the theorycrafting discord if you wish, so you can discuss with facts and numbers to back up your claims. 
---
Or if you'd rather keep screeching at reddit more... you do you.
---
It definitely satisfies both parties. But there is third option. Leave it as it and once people will have chance to experience it on their own, they will cry for a change
---
&gt; Vanilla Wow
---
&gt; Unstable Affliction
---
 !RemindMe 78 days
---
But why
---
In game it's more bright. (The "glow" is stronger than in Vanilla.)
---
It's unfortunate.
---
It's not even the right icon..
---
TBC prepatch is still TBC
---
Because the purpose of this rule to begin with isn't to make them pay to play the beta, it's about getting quality testers. If it was completely free to opt in then they would get 100x the people opting in to test. Not just the people who right now refuse to sub to opt in, but the thousands who see a news article about it and go 'hey that's cool sure i'll sign up'. Then when they get the invite in their inbox they ignore it for then and never actually get around to playing it or just see the price and don't want to pay then. They can only give out so many beta keys and those going to these people will just be wasted. And reassigning them would be one hell of a headache and just waste time they could have real players that they know are currently playing the real game on and beta testing.
---
Yes this is what I read and it confused me because said nothing about not being available now, just that I need a subscription and it should then be available in launcher
---
female Dwarf priest with Pigtails, has some really nice animation actually
---
Troll wins.
---
Oh man so many to choose. 
---
Winterspring is so icy and beautiful, as is Dun Morogh. 
---
But for atmosphere it has to be Eastern Plaguelands or Duskwood. Man those areas are horrific and beautiful.
---
Except TBC prepatch is still TBC.
---
I expected more remembrance style posts to happen little over a month ago, but it seems people already forgot :'(
---
neither was the new water renderer that is currently in classic
---
addons existed in vanilla and there were less restrictions on what they could do the actual addons of the time were not so good because no one really knew how to make addons
---
this means if someone were to go backwards in time to 2006 with the knowledge of addons we have today they could make an addon that can do much much more than what you can in current retail
---
TBC Prepatch != vanilla.
---
That is what I expect also. A small group to make sure most fights are won and to be able to fight multiple players better, but the less players to get the job done the better to reduce shared honor.
---
Many kills fast with a big honor reward for each kill and low diminishing return.
---
BRM/burning stepped/searing gorge feels like a really good spot.
---
Ungoro has its 1 spot where everyone has to go and I think it is possible to kill at flight path without guards.
---
Silithus would probably have many grinders but not many questers.
---
Winterspring, EPL, WPL will probably have quite many grinders and questers.
---
They did not remove the XP bar at max level until quite far into the game.
---
Tranq Shot is not required to MC. It's hard but not impossible.
---
I would also always end my lvl 60 grind on yetis. I think every character I maxed in classic did.
---
They didn't touched me anywhere.
---
I am just trying to save A LOT of delusional people, that are basing their intent to roll a Druid for tanking raids, on videos that are from private servers. Private servers that are PROVEN to be heavily undertuned AND providing tools that WILL NOT be as available in Classic, like world buffs and flasks.
---
People like you do not see the big picture.
---
But, please disregard me entirely, and roll a Druid in classic for tanking raids.
---
Just make sure that you have a good healing gear in the bags, because you will be healing raids, not tanking them.
---
Not because I WANT this, but because the HEALERS and the Raid Leader will ask you to wake up, smell the roses, and stop tanking raid bosses, because their are running OOM or are unable to heal a bad streak of 3 crits landed on you in less than 5 seconds, due to a bad streak of parry-hasted hits from a boss.
---
It happened A LOT in Vanilla, and it will happen in Classic : insta-gibbed Druid tanks following a bad streak of crits.
---
It doesn't happening on private servers because raid bosses have 250% LESS chance to parry-haste.
---
Prove me, and others like me wrong : be a Druid tank in Classic.
---
Just don't quit the game when you hit 60, die 5 times in a row in MC, and be asked to heal or warm the bench until the guild is BWL geared and uses you as tank in MC, farming Bindings for the REAL TANKS.
---
This guy is complaining and saying bullshit in every thread. Props to you for taking the time to answer, but honestly I wouldn't have bothered.
---
Downvoted because reddit but you're 100% correct.  People trying to say 2.x is vanilla because they hadn't turned on outland yet are fucking retarded.
---
Same. Toss us a link you silly goose!
---
Debuff limit makes putting up debuffs a tactic, not just something you spam. It increases raid skill ceiling. 
---
Spellbatching is just a part of vanilla and all the outplay potential is literally involved around spellbatching so no thanks.
---
Yeah it could be a green like the other guy said. I couldn't remember what icon The Nicker used and I forgot that there was a green with the same graphic.
---
You just have to scroll further. Release date is at the bottom. ;)
---
Take numbers in this thread lightly they are mostly from prive servers and it looks like levelling will be slower in classic. World record is a bit above 5 days not 3 on actually vanilla I'd say double it if you are a good player whit a pre thought ot plan. If not 15-17 days played is not out of the question. If you can try playing long first day if you get ahed of the pack you will be alot faster
---
There's a Google sheets spreadsheet floating around on this sub somewhere with all guilds that are publicly recruiting, and you can filter it by all known information

Always upvote it’s always sunny meme
---
Well isn't it super hard to pick different classes? Like how you Handle a Warlock + Mage same time? Feel really hard.
---
You're likely going to have a better time on a Rogue from what it sounds like
---
Hahaha, have my upvote!
---
(You need to subscribe, nothing else. You'll download the new Classic client, the old one is not usable. There will be new addons for Classic. There are already many working ones for the beta. Just like the old client the old addons are not usable.)
---
Yep. Dwarf is the Race that would be the furthest.
---
They have Tanks, Paladins, Priest with Fearward, both Furywarrior and Rogue as DPS and they have Hunter for Tranq shot.
---
Could likely clear the whole game with 40 Dwarves.
---
It's worth it to respond even if he's completely uninterested. It means that somebody who may be unsure of the information themselves have a decent counterpost to think about.
---
Cheers for the kudos.
---
I'm for it, even if I were against it the goal of classic is not to make some perfect version of wow. It's just to make classic, the flaws and drawbacks contribute immensly to the overall experience to such an extent that removing them would make the game significantly different.
---
They won't be that expensive, and how many flasks you will be used will depend on the price. 
---
Who uses it depends on class, casters and tanks use it the most because damage and well tanks need to stay alive. For melee/hunter and healers you won't really be expected to flask unless if you are in a very hardcore guild or you are doing difficult progression like AQ/Naxx.
---
It depends if you like mixing classes, in general it is more complicated though.
---
Do you have no simile that actually relates to gameplay instead of citing external factors such as lag which varied hugely depending on the player?
---
I don't believe Spirit tap is vital until ~20 when you start getting lots of spirit gear. 
---
&gt; Gives you a 100% chance to gain a 100% bonus to your Spirit after killing a target that yields experience. For the duration, your Mana will regenerate at a 50% rate while casting. Lasts 15sec.
---
That will have severe diminishing returns until around +40 or so spirit (I'm really roughly guessing here - A 1% increase in Spirit increases mana regeneration by 1%, and 1% Intellect yields 0.5% more regen. This is a rough rule of thumb, but is accurate enough for most situations)
---
When going solo, wand spec is definitely more useful earlier on. As a duo, that's debatable, but I don't think faster TTK is bad even in a duo situation.
---
Your opinion is not shared by the entire community tho
---
Druids are typically flag runners in WSG and ninjas in AB. Rogues are really boring in WSG because you just sit in your base waiting for someone to come by. If you're in a premade odds are nobody will get even close to the flag room. In AB they are ninjas and defenders like the druid.
---
 /tar works with out being able to see them in LOS as well
---
How?
---
Yep it's Dwarf.
---
They have tanks, melee DPS, 2 healers, and Tranq shot.
---
This is the perfect answer, you sir have won the Internet
---
Crushing blows are a 50% increase to normal damage, critical strikes are a 100% damage increase on an ability. It's critical strikes you have to fear, not crushing blows. But even then, the damage spike isn't necessarily that big. Giant damage spikes come after multiple parries, at the beginning of an enrage timer or when a boss uses a special ability. 
---
Then you have guys like Patchwerk where the damage spike is all the time, and there indeed using a Druid is a bad idea, but most bosses are chill in that regard.
---
No.
---
If a "friend" sat on his moral high horse and wants you to think the way on the left, (s)he's not a friend.
---
Why would you need poly on Nef?
---
Nice flaming reply, bro. You're the exact type of person that the replies further up is talking about. Just because there are issues with vanilla that people point out doesn't mean that they're a fucking shill for guitar hero retail. You need to fucking stop with that shit. Or you can continue to be mr flamebro tryhard.
---
You need to read the thread over again and the context of my reply. I didn't suggest that it needed to be changed, but it's the exact same shit as gearscore checks from wrath but applied on a class level. "We can expect this sort of DPS from a rogue vs mage, we can expect this sort of DPS from this gearscore" To merely suggest that anything at any point in classic is imbalanced at all is blasphemy. That's funny.
---
There's nothing that mechanically interesting or diverse about vanilla raiding meta in terms of RPG specialization. DPS scaling between classes and cookie cutter builds affect competition for raid slots. Casual guilds won't care too much, but it does bleed into even how casual guilds will be pushed into acting.
---
You get to endgame and are told that only 1 of your 3 specs is raid viable. Your class has only 1 guaranteed raid slot (maybe) and everything else is 3 classes. Yeah, great class design. Read again what I was replying to. That's why people keep asking over and over again about classes and specs. People don't want to waste their time on a character that's class gimped.
---
Only play a Druid if you’re ok never killing people.

Why do you have to sacrifice anything? These are the dagger pvp specs you will be using:

It's something like noone attacks the caster at all. And warrior using Thunder Clap to keep him off healers..? :D Not entirely sure.
---
Both are really going but yes orc is better.
---
Well, back in real vanilla progression, we had this thing called "tanks dying because they took lots of damage" that happened sometimes. So sometimes tanks would wear tank gear, use a shield and spec into prot so that would happen less often.
---
Apparently on pirate servers which are *totally Blizzlike how dare you say different* on progression raids the tanks dual wield, spec into fury and never die. The tanks generate loads of threat and the healers never go OOM and every raid is cleared within minutes of it opening.
---
Now none of us know for sure how it will work out, but a distinct possibility is that in Classic feeding the boss lots of parry opportunities while not generating as much threat and not having many healers will lead to the tank dying before the boss does. That's what people would have expected to happen back in real vanilla.
---
So the solution would be to gear and spec like a real vanilla tank, accept the lower threat, cull the massive overpopulation of DPS warriors who have no threat mitigation and replace most of them with mages and rogues who can DPS hard even with less tank threat, and add a couple more healers to keep the tank alive.
---
Will it happen? We'll have to wait and see. But I think it's entirely plausible, especially for guilds who aren't 100% hardcore world-buff-hoarding poopsockers who have cleared every raid a hundred times already.
---
Where did the rumors start?
---
&gt; They won't be that expensive, and how many flasks you will be used will depend on the price. 
---
Are you basing that on private servers? because didnt they have dynamic spawn on lotus, which retail wont have?
---
If would speak up too much about multiboxing, this classic community has for some unknown reason a crazy hate against multiboxing.  even if you decided to do PVE content only  
---
but consider that /follow doesnt work in BG's, so you only could do W-pvp :)  
---
ill play warrior and healer in multiboxing, so i can find fast dungeons. and i enjoy the extra challenge
---
Been training myself to go from fat to fit before classic launch so I can go from fit to fat instead from fat to obese ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Depend on where u live but if u live in US u cant complain for 15$ month. Some barely get 1$ per hour depending on minimum wage...
---
It's pretty darn mediocre in PvE
---
Definitely not. but with big majority it is. Maybe some retail kids cant imagine the game without it, but its better rpg-wise and leveling-wise believe me. And you will still have nameplates, its not like it would completely abandon them, they would be just shown at reasonable distance
---
It's great for pvp no doubt but it's rather lack luster in most pve content
---
This is like going up to disney land. and telling them that you don't wanna pay $150 a ticket because you aren't going to use ride Space mountain.
---
If it was really imbalanced, PvP basically died out on the server. New realms were opened intermittently and people on lopsided realms often left to start on a fresh one, so most servers were either pretty even or completely lopsided. Plenty of realms were 90/10 or 80/20, and nobody really tried to rank up or do any serious PvP on those servers.
---
That'll be a little different with cross-realm BGs and the modern community tools available for Classic. People will go out of their way to try to land on balanced servers, so there shouldn't be many that end up 90/10. But probably some, and those servers are gonna suck because the 10% faction won't even get instant BG queues like you normally would if the opposing faction is much bigger.
---
Amusingly, if layering and megaservers was actually a permanent plan, you could eliminate almost all faction imbalance by simply making each layer a perfect 50/50 split so that all but the last layer are completely balanced. But that would mean long-term layering and huge server communities that probably feel too much like retail.
---
When looking at how things we're, I think you have to look at how things ACTUALLY were, instead of what they could have been.
---
Weather this was possible in Vanilla or not is irrelevant because no one did it or possibly even knew about it.  
---
Could they of? Yes. But so could they have made addons to make group finding easier... The fact is, no one did and as such, should we allow an lfd addon in Classic? Ofc not.
---
This whole thing is a prime example of how modern knowledge will effect/change the way the game was. In this case it's simple coding.
---
This isn't about weather you like the distance or not (that's also irrelevant (and for clarity - I like it)) it's about preserving the game. We have the option to easily solve one of the most problematic and controversial topics about classic wow (at least solve it for name plates anyway) and it should be broken/removed.
---
If Blizzard are going to break or stop lfd addons and more, then this falls under the same bracket. It just so happens to be so simple you can do it in a sentence with a script.
---
System or tricks that allow you change the game from what it once was (remember, what it ACTUALLY was, not just what was possible) should not exist.
---
Personal attacks is trolling. No need to talk about egoism, lol. Stick to the topic :)
---
Druids have a 2.5 second attack speed. You really overestimate how much 9% more Parry will affect this.
---
If anything it will make Druids more viable as a high threat generating tank as the Parry will affect DW Fury more than a Druid.
---
&gt; And during progression, Druid tanks will simply be dead. Either because of an unlucky parry-haste streak, which can also be ALL critical hits, **or because they run OOM long before the boss is dead.** 
---
I can tell you have something against Druids, but come on. No need to resort to lies to prove your point. You clearly dont know what you are talking about haha.
---
Most the rank 1/tournament players are playing what do you mean
---
You have ven/cdew/ziqo/snutz and you’re still complaining
---
He scheduled this to coincide with his stream being on the Twitch front page, too.
---
Keep this clown out of here thanks
---
gz on reaching r14 in 2006 when people sucked, or in 2016 when the way to reach r14 was to quedodge good teams so you can farm. 
---
Quite the projecting we discovered here, trying quite hard huh.
---
i would love an option , but the tmorph was bannable if i remember right?  only used it for a little bit
---
I just realized that OP was possibly referring to the same thing, but we got our wires crossed because he responded to me as though he meant Imp IF after all.
---
In that case I totally agree that Inner Focus is an astounding talent point for all specs. XD Sorry about the miscommunication!
---
The main reason we don’t have this is a couple reasons. Some people could have quit before having a battle tag even existed. Also, if you are not subbed you may not be able to contact people via their battle tag.
---
As a data scientist make sure you are GDPR compliant with your work when you are working with EU people data.
---
Druid is a tier 1 leveller.. just behind hunters &amp; locks.
---
Prehot.. then shift to cat, while 5sec mana regen kicks in. Basically zero downtime
---
Guild runs are also great so you can organize who gets what before the run
---
Well that's a lie.
---
Wowhead
---
Clearly you haven't played the REAL Vanilla. The occurrence of parry-hasted hits was THE NORM, not the exception.
---
&gt; Druids only take roughly 12-15% more damage over the course of a fight than Prot warriors, but they take less damage on average per hit. 
---
The stupidity of this phrase...Druids take 12-15% more damage? Yeah...ON PRIVATE SERVERS. They will take 250% more, due to Parry-Haste in Classic. The fights will be longer, and the damage will pile up. Overall, the Druid tank, EVEN IF THE HEALERS ARE ABLE TO KEEP HIM ALIVE, will have massive mana issues, and will more often than not run OOM before the boss is dead.
---
Even if we remove the Crits from the table, the Druid tank will still require at least 50% more healing in Classic, and THAT is a big problem.
---
Very often, even with a Prot Warrior, healers are almost OOM at the end of the fight. With a Druid, they will be OOM way before the fight is over.
---
Try to see the FULL implications of a 250% increase in parry-haste in Classic...not only in damage...but also in the HEALING required to counter an increased damage.
---
Druids take LESS damage per hit...nope, they take MORE. The damage reduction is similar between Druids and Prot Warriors. Druids cannot Block. They can't parry. Druid's overall avoidance is less than Prot Warriors.
---
The HP pool difference is minimal, and because Druids can get crit or crushed, Warrior comes on top.
---
Please, for your sanity, IGNORE private server meta. It will NOT exist in Classic.
---
Druids will be HEALERS, Fury Warriors will be DPS, and Prot Warriors will be TANKS.
---
AS IT WAS IN VANILLA, not because we didn't knew better (we knew much more than you think), but because every single attempt of a Druid to tank progression raids was ALWAYS a failure. They either died, or the healers ran oom long before the boss died.
---
The same will be in Classic.
---
When i se u again.... woooooooooohhhh ooooooooooohhhhh
---
My group of friends have played vanilla in 2004 and all other iterations of wow, the #nochanges crew legit bother me, they advocated for batching and the majority of ppl now are realizing that its awful
---
Yeah my 14 year old self decided to delete both my level 60s when I quit the game (before BC was announced/My 14 year old self was aware of it). You can imagine how annoyed I was when me and my friends went back to it, they all got to level 60-70 while I had to re roll.
---
Yep I remember this being a mage AOE farm spot. Pretty much no chance of getting ganged or competition
---
We are talking about raids mate...
---
didnt they mention that they changed sth on that system specific for classic wow?  
---
or i just got it wrong
---
You just look like a religious fanatic posting a page response all up and down this one thread to anyone with a different idea. 
---
My recommendation would be to make your case clearly in a top response, and continue the discussion there. Not respond to *everyone* on the matter with a long-winded rant.
---
I don't particularly have to **prove** anything, as I know what a druid tank is capable of, as I raided both MC and Ony and a bit of BWL as the OT (and MT on one fight) later in Vanilla (but pre-patch 1.12). I had no issues getting a spot.
---
&gt;Private servers that are PROVEN to be heavily undertuned AND providing tools that WILL NOT be as available in Classic, like world buffs and flasks.
---
No they havent. Go lie somewhere else.
---
In every case where we know the real data, the private server seem to be harder. Bosses hit for more, armor is higher etc.
---
Here's a comparison screenshot from C'Thun f.ex between vanilla and private servers.  [https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png) 
---
Because the damage values will be lower across the Board in Vanilla then this Parry change just means you can wear more threat gear. And flask? Stop being stupid. A guild can afford to pay for 3 flasks for their tanks.
---
Druid is more difficult to play in 1v1 scenarios than a rogue where you get carried by your cooldowns, but they are not bad at all.
---
Generally druids are way more useful on battlegrounds, godlike flag carriers, base defenders capable of ranged pokes and roots on AB, and jacks of all trades on AV where you can heal/tank/dps according to the situation.
---
&gt;some wannabe Druid that goes against the GAME DESIGN and MATH, forcing 39 people having a much slower raid progression 
---
   Textbook example of a toxic elitist, it's honestly hard to read. Prots don't have as much damage reduction as Druids and their life is a couple thousands HP off, especially early on, and some guilds used Druid tanks back in Vanilla, I'm not sure why it would be any different comes Classic. Also "raid progression" in a 15 years old game will be pretty fast and easy to most people anyway, especially if they don't overtune the content like PServers do. 
---
   Of course, if you're desperate to find only "optimal" specs in your raid you're free to find a guild of people with the same mindset. But coming to Reddit and belittling people for playing a class that isn't "the perfect choice" - which is debatable depending on the content phase - and blaming them for slowing everybody down is garbage behavior, sorry.
---
False. I don’t want expansions. I’m not the only one.
---
sounds like rogue is what you want
---
Indeed!
---
Yeah, I was at the Media Event as a journalist, the one all the “streamers” were also at. That’s how I got in, because every single person at that Event was given access. But I have to say I’ve found the outrage about “streamers” or “content creators” to be kind of dumb. I’ve been in the beta since day one, and I’ve met a massive amount of people who have nothing to do with streaming or the media. People act like only streamers or those with connections got in. There’s a ton of just regular players, believe it or not. I think Asmon and Esfand and everyone else blowing up on Twitch the last couple of weeks is skewing the perception.
---
What was the nerf?
---
At first joy. Then reality hits. Now I have to grind for the goddamn epic mount. :D
---
&gt;I've watched all his videos and he routinely addresses any differences between Vanilla and any private server.
---
What? It was only found out like two days ago that raid bosses have triple the parry chance in vanilla compared to raid bosses on privas.
---
Same here, it disappeared. Maybe they are updating the client and we will be able to download a new one? That’s just a guess.
---
I actually doubt there will be any free account option in Classic. I mean, if you want to give WoW a try, you still have retail. Also, I think Activision will try to milk the sub money as much as possible from Classic.
---
&gt; In every case where we know the real data, the private server seem to be harder. Bosses hit for more, armor is higher etc.
---
That is flat out false. You literally replied to a guy pointing out that in vanilla raid bosses had a 15% parry chance, and on private servers it was set to around 5%.
---
Tanking in vanilla/Classic is way harder than on privas.
---
Any chance you guys will raid a little earlier? Myself and 2 friends (possibly more) all hadcore semi hardcore with full vanilla experience up until a few bosses in naxx, so far we are rogue/shaman/druid, we work early though and looking to raid around 7-8pm onwards til late of required. Heavily experienced with pvp and pvp leadership for premade bgs. Cheers mate, good to see Horde guild finally!
---
I am so sorry for you guys.
---
Hopefully you have couple Prot Warriors in reserve, because you will replace the Bear after first MC run...a run that will probably take twice as long with a Bear tank.
---
Westfall and Plaguelands...probably bc I grinded my last couple of levels to 60 there.
---
He also tanked his Twitch viewership by half for this tourney by doing "boring content" like farming instead of capitalizing with stunts and events like Asmon (who can get double his viewers now).
---
Look at his bars. 0% chance this is the case lmao
---
yeah it was, but I never got hit with a ban luckily
---
Been clean 10 years now, but I still think about it.  Kinda like you all with classic wow.  So kinda comparable that way i guess.  But in all the ways that really count no, lol.  No.
---
&gt; You can successfully tank most of MC/BWL 
---
On private servers.
---
No need to thank me for adding what you forgot to.
---
Can't we just have classic before we do classic+ with custom content?
---
If you tell me one positive thing it brings to the table besides "experiencing shitty laggy vanilla" in 2019, maybe you will change my mind
---
Hey, btw, sorry for the confusion last night. For some reason when you were asking about IF, I thought you meant Improved Inner Fire based on other responses in the other comment chain.
---
I totally agree with Melekith that Inner *Focus* is one of Priest's best single talent points, if not the best for any spec.
---
Im not saying we can’t. Im simply saying that Id be interested in this being added some time.
---
Thanks, my little heart attack is gone now.
---
I think we should at least get 1 pve 1 pvp server!
---
Sadly Follow work in PvP right now :D
---
It's hilarious reading this because you are so far removed from how damage mitigation mechanics of Vanilla works it's actually embarsassing to read.
---
It's not. Twinstar is apparently more accurate, try that.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=257
---
Lists level 11 requirement.
---
Whats with the surge of memes of people demanding beta, was there a new wave of invites? :O
---
Mulgore, Dun Morogh, Ashenvale, and Elwynn Forest are the most nostalgic for me.
---
You mean that classic should be a sperate subscription?
---
Looking some Videos, shown Warlock/Pally and Mage/Mage seems a good Combo. Not sure how to Handle Warlock/Pally.
---
I noticed this too on my husband's character creation screen.  I have old screenshots as well.  We've tried adjusting brightness on the monitor (turned it all the way up), we tried resetting the "glow" effects with /console ffxglow 0 - but it's just darker.  It really makes a difference on the troll/orc background, it's hard to see the skin tones.  And it makes the human hair colors look, strange.
---
Good point!
---
...on private servers.
---
Warriors will have better threat in Classic compared to Druids, because with 14% parry-haste on raid bosses, more hits will land on the tank...and Prot Warriors will BENEFIT from that, because we can parry-haste as well.
---
Druids can't parry.
---
A lot of people a missing the entire picture : the HIGHER the raid boss parry-haste, the HIGHER the Prot Warrior parry-haste, the HIGHER the threat generated by the Prot Warr.
---
Again, Druids CANNOT parry.
---
Retail flasks were cheaper. We'll have to see how expensive it gets but if it's 200g then don't expect to be forced to buy them.
---
And yes pserver had dynamic respawn because you know... 12k pop is a bit more than what retail had.
---
You can't farm gold when you aren't at level cap. You still need to buy the expac
---
Despite the ignorant fuckit downvoting you this is the correct answer.  Arena epics were the first welfare epics, flying, and the shift from 40-25 raids were garbage.
---
The next test is in June. The last one is in July.
---
Well yeah, what else is there?
---
The raid won't be out at the same time as the patch, the PvP season won't either. What am I gonna do, farm shitty ugly mounts in gnomeland?
---
So you're just gonna insult people who are better than you instead of actually arguing I see.
---
I'm coming up on a year clean on the 11th. 10 years in incredible
---
What about Herb and alch? Does crafted item are soulbound if no u can ask guildmate to craft gear for u .
---
Thanks for responding. I gave up a few threads ago. It's really tiring debating with people who repeatedly ignore facts and math to make a point.
---
I wonder if demon hunter glaives has the pandered face in reign of chaos??
---
Troll is probably better they have the exact same thing as dwarf with the addition of mages.
---
Druids, like rogues, can be a strong opponent in a 1v1. However unlike rogue, druid does not have any escape tools for their oh shit buttons.
---
Well do you want to heal or dps? If you don't want to heal cross shammy and priest off the list because that's what they do in classic
---
If you go priest, you will for sure get a raid spot.
---
Ok but I want to play vanilla, not a modified version with custom content.
---
$5 just for wow classic seems reasonable.  $15 is a bit steep considering it's a 2004 game and no changes to it.  If there was 40k players per realm and new zones like Hyjal and content I can understand $15.
---
I thought about herb/alch but I read thy Eng is just generally better for pvp
---
The movie should have been a show, at least 10  seasons long. There is so much to tell. 
---
The first war should take 2 seasons. 
---
The 2nd war should take 2 seasons. 
---
The third war and Reign of Chaos should take 3 seasons.
---
The Frozen Throne events should take 2 seasons.
---
I dont know if you ever played on private servers or not, but there was this interesting TBC server coming up this January. They promised retail-like experience and the went so far with scripting, that they actually, as the first private server ever, implemented spell batching. People were hating on it so much, that they actually ended up nerfing it. People dont know, what they want and its scary to see so many people wanting spell batching. Nobody is even capable to say one positive attribute it brings to the table.
---
&gt;if you liked the old questing style, outland and northrend are all still intact pre-cata style questing zones.
---
It's not intact, because you A) outlevel it before you get to experience it. B) it's piss-easy because of the numerous stat changes throughout the years and with scaling they can't make a good difficulty curve even if they wanted to. and C) the classes you experience those quests with are poorly designed.
---
BfA is a bad game, it's not me that's changed, the game has.
---
who gives a fuck..?
---
And It's such a dumb thing for the no changes crowd to be up in arms about. How does changing your hair style, a purely RP function, ruin your immersion in an RPG? With everything else in classic that could possibly be different, why is that too much?
---
I mean, yeah, i can totally understand transmog, but the fucking barber shop?
---
&gt; generally accepted something like 20% less dps output (as we've seen from pservers launching with progressive itemization)
---
Where are you getting this from? Comparing K3 with zero armor bosses with ND with buffed armor?
---
ah with world buffs i see.
---
I dont know much about what kinda buffs people were using but DM North tribute buff gives +15% Max HP so if they had that, its quite insane increase in hp. So unbuffed they would probably have like 8k or so.
---
Do you remember what world buffs you had? a few of them give max hp, the one i mentioned has the biggest boost in health.
---
I'd be okay with them taking that part out and just leaving hair color, style, and piercings/beards in.
---
mine is still there, too. just out of curiosity, were you one of the people that had 2 PTRs, asked CS to remove one, and then was properly flagged later on?
---
I’ve seen people *say* they did in chat from time to time. Yesterday night was 581 Alliance side PvP server. Sounded about right, and the world had a lot less people in it due to dungeon runs. It honestly feels like there are less people than a week ago just cause we’re more spread out, but you will always find someone within a minute of travel.
---
I find the cats a bit boring haha.  I like the wolves that have the shout that gives bonus damage so i might use one of them for leveling and maybe in raids
---
boars ftw though cos i'm rolling a dwarf and i think they fit with dwarves :D
---
People will remember your name more than your hair. Do you people never get haircuts in real life?
---
I think we should get out of beta before any plans of another expansion are talked about.
---
&gt; unwilling to recognize or care about other people/players unless those players benefit them in some way 
---
They're not obligated to so why does that matter? Make your own guild where you focus on carrying people if you feel strongly about it.
---
And personally, none of this matters. I'm playing classic to play the game as it was originally, with the old zones and questing experience. I don't need a "community" to do that, and to say "community" is the only thing classic has going for it is to sell it short, as some people do.
---
Rogue is definitely easier for pvp. However, druids are the most fun class to play in my opinion. Being able to shift from cat, travel, bear, flight, they're very versatile with many options. Will you be the toughest? No, but if you're good, you can at least be formidable against most and do your share of beating people. You just have to learn the class and really know your capabilities as well as the capabilities of your opponent. Timing is key.
---
&gt;Can such damage be healed? YES. Can it be healed if takes place 5-6 times in 2 minutes? During progression, NO. Healers won't have ENOUGH mana for that.
---
Prove this. Every post from you is just straight up misinfo with zero evidence (actual math) behind it.
---
9% parry will no make a big difference when we already know Druids survive just fine on private servers despite a lot of bosses trash (at least the ones where we can properly compare with Vanilla) much much more damage.
---
A Druid and a DW fury warrior will produce so high threat compared to a full Prot that healers can easily afford to spend the extra mana. The only issue here is you have already decided Druids wont be good and refuse to inform yourself.
---
And please, stop saying 250% increase in Parry just because you want your argument to sound more impressive. The actual number is 9% higher Parry chance. It just makes you look stupid.
---
This argument really holds no weight. You can't say that players shouldn't have the ability to play WoW Classic based upon knowledge that was discovered since 2005. 
---
Where do you draw the line? Do you limit how many Warriors you can bring on a raid if the meta has shifted since the days of vanilla? Do you somehow ban strategies that have been developed over the past few years? Does Blizzard review every single addon that gets developed for Classic and try to compare it against an analogous addon from vanilla? How can you even prove if an addon didn't exist in that time period?  Do you expect Blizzard to maintain a customer service staff that seeks out and bans players for all of these arbitrary and confusing restrictions on the game?
---
For me WOTLK is much closer to Cata and beyond than to TBC. That first week or two of WOTLK crushed so many dreams - all the raid content was trivial and cleared instantly, heroics were chain-pulled like mad. Comparing SH to something like AN just hurts. Wellfare items were here to stay.  Dailies, even though were introduced in TBC took on a much greater part in WOTLK. On the other hand, Ulduar was incredible, it really stands out. But the whole challenge/reward structure of the game changed upon WOTLK launch I feel.
---
Also my Goal is to hit 60 fast, so either doing Duo or Solo Hunter on Day 1.
---
I played on that server and advocated against it. As i said the nochange crowd is delusional. This nameplate change is an example,  if you dont want it dont use it. Otherwise all it does is present more information to pvp players which raises the skill cap. Its a good change
---
I dig the Barrens. A savanna is actually a pretty neat setting for a fantasy game, and they did quite a lot with it.
---
For me, I'd say the Badlands. They really just don't have much going on.
---
Somehow I doubt that simulating original vanilla spellbatching isn't going to be same when u use BFA client and type in 400ms delay on everything.
---
Here's where they talk about it and it sounds different than what it is in classic. There's more to spell batching than one variable(amount of delay)
---
"You think you do, but you don't."
---
Disagreeing with you isn't personal attacks either.
---
And pointing out that wanting the entire game changed for no better reason than you thinking it should be changes constitutes egotism, isn't an attack, it's an observation.
---
Flasks are definitely a thing for aq40 and naxx, but prior to that it's something only the main tanks and meter toppers really will bother to use in most raids, outside of hardcore guilds anyway.
---
I think most people are in favor of limiting nameplate range. People complain about it on streams all the time.
---
But at the same time, you can't blame players for taking advantage of it as long as it's in the game. Because if you don't, you're playing with a disadvantage.
---
I'd prefer to have the range limited, but if it's not I'm gonna crank that shit up day 1.
---
It’s disabled in beta
---
Summing everything up into something a bit more concise, I think the points you mentioned could be said:
---
&gt; What you do *matters*.
---
People playing four hours a week aren't going to see the results of what a guy playing 20 hours a week will see. 
---
It's a very important point of a game not to have "empty filler hours". Hours where it doesn't matter what you do, you'll see the same end result. 
---
In a phrase: Guaranteed success.
---
This is what set the more popular MMOs apart. The other part of this is that it didn't take Everquest-levels of herculean effort to achieve something in the game. 
---
You can make progress of sorts even in a 2 hour chunk of time. The pacing in this game was superbly done, so even the "filthy casual" doesn't feel like he's not getting anywhere by investing his time. But he's not getting as far as the player who put in 15 hours.
---
If I was going to place blame on where the current game went, it would be to make the content so accessible, that you only have to be a warm body for ten or so hours a week to get similar rewards to the person putting in thirty hours a week. That sort of "everyone wins" design has made retail a game that I am not particularly interested in playing (even after a few trials).
---
I love Tanaris
---
What the cost on retail was is irrelevant. As I said, we are a lot more conscious about the effects of min/maxing. Back in retail, most people barely had potions on them, which most people will have today.
---
Engineering was not really a thing either, which the majority of pvpers or pvers will have today.
---
Does the mod shift currently work on private for me to play with?  I know show tooltip does not.  Or is it more complicated with the old client?
---
I remember having this discussion back in the day. I believe we decided Dwarf would be the best race. You get access to Paladins, and fear ward. While the race lacks magic dps you could take shadow priest to fulfill those rolls. 
---
It was just a few 13-14 yo kids making this up so I'm sure there is some fatal flaw.
---
So this means PvE servers have a much higher chance of being balanced, since faction balance isn't important? Is it also possible to permanently flag myself to PvP also on a PvE server?
---
You are remembering release Druid. I did as well. I have been a Druid my entire WoW career and wouldn’t touch leveling a Druid again with a 10 foot pole as I kept a rejuv up on me and had moonfire ticking.
---
This is 1.12 talents and feral is totally viable to level in. Power shifting is a thing. I’m currently leveling my 3rd character as a Druid on beta and I’m 4 hours /played ahead of my best time with an AoE frost mage. It’s really fast.
---
To say Warrior Priest is a terrible combo because of a single spell is bullshit. Yes shield is a problem for a warrior, but quite frankly I can't think of many situations where using shield would really matter. Flashheal or renew easily makes up for it.
---
Warrior/Priest might not be the most optimized combo, but during leveling nearly any 2 people combination will make almost anything a walk through the park and when it comes to looking for groups any Tank/Heal combo will significantly lower the time it takes to find a full group.
---
Yes other healers have mor utility than the priest, but in general it's best to play the classes one has the most fun with.
---
TBC is over rated.
---
&gt;will help many to get that experience.
---
Their goal is to create the authentic experience of Patch 1.12
---
This patch has xrealm BBGs.
---
So your last sentence is either self contradictory, or you confuse "the authentic experience" with "whatever I want it to be".
---
What does batching have to do with nameplates?
---
Thats true, boars fit well then haha
---
Tbc and wrath were arguably as good with regard to GAMEPLAY.
---
The problem is, tbc started the trends of shifting to smaller raids, welfare epics, and jumping to new zones and making the old zones dead.
---
Wrath introduced lfg, lfr, and the accursed ilvl mod which eventually became the yard stick for player worth instead of skill and reputation.
---
Everything else (MoP and Legion included) were absolute trash, and the trend of   Resetting progression every few months is fucking cancer
---
If you really can’t pick a class, you can always just try them all then just go with the one you feel best with
---
Only race guild won't work
---
You need shamans and druids, to do dungeons.
---
Good thing it's June then huh
---
That's awesome. Thanks for the information!
---
It's enjoyable but when leveling you need to commit to every fight because you don't have a reliable escape mechanism. If you're taking your time with it then doing lots of dungeons will make it good fun as people want tanks and keeping yourself geared makes things less painful.
---
I dont disagree with the Parry. I said the armor and damage values are higher and I even posted evidence of this being the case. 
---
I dont get the zealotry involved here. If you think 9% Parry will make Druids unviable as tanks when the damage done also will be a lot lower in Classic then you clearly have no interest in understanding how tanking works.
---
Has there been any significant updates/news since the release day announcement? I kinda stopped following after that because it killed the hype
---
idk will respond later !Remindme 90 days
---
Isn't he MCing people? Or some drakes are?
---
Joana does drink frequently and "drink while your pet attacks" is one of his go-to tips. I've started doing this with water one tier lower than my level and rarely wait for the full drink. Its relatively cheap and wayyyyy more efficient. As a BM hunter, your pet can solo equal level mobs and with a little help from you easily take on two mobs at a time.
---
but this is almost the same mentality as picking a class because it's the strongest
---
to me I am picking a class based on how much I feel like I identify with it. let's say I'd have shit ton of playing shadow but won't get a raid spot or wont get a bg spot, I'd still play shadow
---
I will not pick a class based on how much easier it will be to get a raid spot or not or how strong the class is
---
but thanks for the input
---
I mean, why not just have them in and not remove them at any point. They're just a visual difference, they still move the same speed than armored epic mounts.
---
They will start hitting buyers - the people who actually care about their character and getting bans.
---
&gt;It's even MORE FUN to run around as a Prot Warrior with 73% damage reduction and 10k health...WHILE being a TANK in the same time, and not some wannabe Druid that goes against the GAME DESIGN and MATH, forcing 39 people having a much slower raid progression.
---
Warriors cannot reach Armor cap. Stop spreading misinformation.

---
ZG gives 15% stats. We had others, but not anything that gave a health boost.
---
I'm just saying pick the role you want to fulfill first, then look at classes that fill that role
---
Go EU less streamers Kappa
---
Yup. And level 20 youre constantly 15% faster running and 30% by 21. This is very noticeable and cuts down your down time a lot, especially considering how much running and fedexing there is in the pre-mount stages. I wouldn’t doubt if a Druid is world first 60 if a Hunter doesn’t get it.
---
Blue
---
Crushing Blows are 150% more damage. It's practically nothing.
---
Because Classic is a restoration effort. The goal is to rebuild the experience of a game not build a new one.
---
What you want isn't classic. What you want is "Classic+Whatever_idea-i-just-had"
---
It's not about "good" or "bad", when will you people realize that?
---
&gt;When going solo, wand spec is definitely more useful earlier on
---
Agreed. 
---
At around level 15 you have 50 spirit. Spirit tap brings you to 100. 
---
1mp5 is 1.6 spirit. So you keep 31mana/second while casting
---
31 mana per second while casting is enough to chain cast rank 1 lesser heal (30 mana 1.5s cast).
---
&gt;The stupidity of this phrase...Druids take 12-15% more damage? Yeah...ON PRIVATE SERVERS. They will take 250% more, due to Parry-Haste in Classic. 
---
250% more damage overall? You're off your rocker. They'll get parried a bit more, which leads to parryhaste. What you're wrong about is the amount of damage they will take. 
---
Let's do the math. If private servers have 5% parry chance, of which results in 40% parry haste (Which isn't always entirely 40% due to how far along a boss may be before their next swing, but I digress, let's go with 40%).
---
5% of attacks result in 40% more damage taken as a maximum, that's 2% damage taken from parryhaste. 
---
Going with classic beta values of 14% parry, with 40% damage taken as a maximum, this results in 5.6% damage taken as total of all damage taken. You're right in that it's more damage taken, but the *total damage* it deals is entirely negligible.
---
Once again, this is also considering that parry haste always results in 40% of a faster swing. Often times attacks from the player will happen just before a boss swings. If said attack is parried, the next boss attack will happen almost instantly from parry haste and then it returns to the boss' normal attack speed. So in reality parry haste isn't always 40%. So that further dilutes the damage total that a tank takes which can be attributed to parryhaste alone.
---
&gt;The fights will be longer, and the damage will pile up. Overall, the Druid tank, EVEN IF THE HEALERS ARE ABLE TO KEEP HIM ALIVE, will have massive mana issues, and will more often than not run OOM before the boss is dead.
---
The healers will be able to keep him alive. There were Paladins tanking Onyxia back in the day, which take similar damage to Druids. 
---
Druids will be fine, healer mana will be fine.
---
&gt;Even if we remove the Crits from the table, the Druid tank will still require at least 50% more healing in Classic, and THAT is a big problem.
---
Where's your evidence for this? 
---
Druids have more armour than warriors, even when Druids are using offensive gear. This results in less damage taken on a per-hit basis. 
---
Druids will be hit more often due to the way warrior avoidance works, but not nearly as much as you're stating.
---
&gt;Very often, even with a Prot Warrior, healers are almost OOM at the end of the fight. With a Druid, they will be OOM way before the fight is over.
---
You played with bad healers or terrible DPS that allowed the fight to go on for so long.
---
Or perhaps the DPS couldn't reach a decent enough ceiling due to the threat being put out by the tank.
---
&gt;Druids take LESS damage per hit...nope, they take MORE. The damage reduction is similar between Druids and Prot Warriors. Druids cannot Block. They can't parry. Druid's overall avoidance is less than Prot Warriors.
---
Once again, on hits that are taken and not mitigated, Druids take less damage per hit due to their obscenely higher armour values, especially if the Prot warrior is using threat gear with less defensive stats on it. 
---
When it comes to blocking, block value often is not high enough to make a massive difference against bosses. The real reason why Prot warriors take less damage **OVER THE COURSE OF A FIGHT** is due to dodge and parry, of which combined, Prot warriors have more avoidance.
---
&gt;The HP pool difference is minimal, and because Druids can get crit or crushed, Warrior comes on top.
---
A few thousand health when health pools are 8-12k depending on buffs is not negligible. Druids can get crit or crushed but because of their heightened armour and health values, this is offset.
---
&gt;Please, for your sanity, IGNORE private server meta. It will NOT exist in Classic.
---
I'm basing it on theorycrafting and maths. You keep screaming 250% without knowing what it is. Private servers are a good reference point, and admittedly are not 100% accurate, but theorycrafting WoW is essentially plugging numbers into slots and watching the result at the end. It's not difficult.
---
&gt;Druids will be HEALERS, Fury Warriors will be DPS, and Prot Warriors will be TANKS. 
---
&gt;AS IT WAS IN VANILLA, not because we didn't knew better (we knew much more than you think), but because every single attempt of a Druid to tank progression raids was ALWAYS a failure. They either died, or the healers ran oom long before the boss died.
---
I would agree with you on Druids if you said that when they only had 125% armour bonus from Dire Bear Form. They got a buff to that in 1.2, and then even further buffs in 1.8 to their talent trees which made Bear fantastic. The stigma stuck, just as it has stuck in your mind.
---
Bosses die faster now because players are better and tanks gear for maximum threat. Tanks survive for longer because healers are able to downrank and be more efficient than they were back in the day, and they also itemize better. 
---
I'm going to be entirely unsurprised when warriors go Fury for threat and pick up the necessary talents in Prot, in the effort to maintain threat requirements.
---
I'm going to be entirely unsurprised when we see more Feral Tanks being used in high tier content because of the massive amount of threat they can push out.
---
I'm going to be entirely unsurprised when people do not stack defense as if it's a godly stat.
---
Once again... join the theorycrafting discords and speak with people who know what they're talking about.
---
https://discord.gg/xH7bXA
---
Ehhh who cares, its like an old man yelling infront of the tv watching a football match. They all think they know best but in reality they dont have the slightest of clue.
---
Nope. We have to do what the post says. Sorry
---
Oh. I didn't even notice.  
---
Well hopefully that's a continuing theme into release.
---
That is true, one solution to that that I've been contemplating is having a section/role in the guild for OOC members to fill those roles. But I'm not planning on taking on the role of being a PvE or PvP focused guild, this will mostly be to support the RP aspect. If other members or officers want this, or have suggestions, I'm not opposed to it at all, and the race only aspect is also up for debate if you  think you have a better idea. I'm just providing a starting point, I'm not saying this is how it has to be.
---
Anybody else having horrible performance on this subbreddit using firefox? My shit is laggy as hell i can even see a stutter sometimes while just typing this. I got no idea why though.
---
If you plan to play classic for 4 months ( au-de) I would pick us. If you are going to play longer than definitely EU. You can try to create a character on us retail, ping is probably going to be around 200
---
Cognitive dissonance from bfa players. If people end up actually enjoying classic more and it becomes the "main" game it will devalue all achievements made on the live game and split the player base, fracturing guilds and such.
---
It's easier to convince yourself Classic is a burnout dead end nostalgia trip than to face the reality. [If Runescape is anything to go by](https://i.imgur.com/90ltkJT.png), Classic is going to thrive up and over BFA.
---
&gt;you'd struggle to get the fire resistance for Rag, etc.
---
Leather resist gear is much better itemized than Plate resist gear.
---
Imo youtubera and streamers bashing on BFA and saying classic was better is well deserved thus time. Up until BFA I was never hoping they play Classic or other xpacs. But with Mark stepping down some things changed and Blizzard got even slower than usual with content in BFA and content in other games. 
---
I think classic will serve now as a reminder to blizz that they cant just pump out stuff and expect ppl to pay for them. 
---
Also you need a sub ti play classic so still I dont think few people shitting on the live game will be big problem for them.
---
I think it applies to people with social awareness who want to maintain a professional reputation.
---
Love me some riff raff
---
I do remember fodly the pink hair rank 14 gnome of my server, as well as some of the hair styles of old guildmates ;)
---
Dwarves don't have decurse. Troll is objectively superior. Both classes miss out on druid and warlock, but dwarf also loses mage.
---
Good point. Especially with shadow guard funnily enough.
---
I liked BC, way more stuff to do, better class specs.
---
The fear is, blizzard being blizzard, what if they upgrade say vanilla to BC, or BC to w.
---
People do not want that, they want the servers to stay as they are.
---
You do gain extra health regen when sitting. It's 10 hps I believe?
---
Honestly they are not far off. The Parry thing is blown completely out of proportion. 9% additional parry wont make a big difference. And unless you have been living under a rock for the past week you will also know that damage values across the board are much much lower in Classic than on Private servers.
---
They took my soul shards and lifetap away. I'll never forgive them.
---
Erm, no.
---
Thunderclap does no bonus threat, and it's damage is ridiculous. And you won't have rage to fire it off reliably anyway. You cannot attack the mob (he knocks you back with a 5000dmg arcane burst if you get in melee range).
---
Ergo, you will lose aggro to the healers pretty damn quickly, and Vek'lor will start murdering them.
---
Go warlock, you wont regret it papa.
---
Your posts are nothing but misinformation and zealotry with absolutely no mathematical backing to them. Nobody should take you seriously.
---
I had Azpep the imp on my first character... I loved him.
---
Situation normal
---
Don't fret those people. They almost always have ulterior motives.
---
My general experience with them is that they know the modern game has a massive handicap, and prefer it that way.
---
Whether it's that they genuinely need the handicap or are just irredeemably lazy, they really just don't want the people carrying them to leave for greener pastures.
---
&gt;Druids have a 2.5 second attack speed
---
That seems quite important then. 
---
In a 5 minute boss fight where the tank is auto-attacking from the get go and until the end, a druid tank would attack 120 times and 18 of those attacks would be parried. A warrior tank with a 1.9 attack speed weapon (thunderfury) would attack ~158 times and 24 of those attacks would be parried.
---
Now this is just auto-attacks, but aren't warriors using way more attacking abilities throughout a given fight than a druid? If so, wouldn't the warrior tank be taking way more spikey damage than the druid?
---
I don't remember anyone chain-pulling heroics in greens and blues when they first launched, and [Loken killed more people than anyone throughout WOTLK.](https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/04/loken-the-most-dangerous-mob-in-the-game/) T7 was made easier for people who had never raided before to make it more accessible than in old days, which continued with "normal mode" in the following tiers. Blizz did it so that more than 1% of players would actually see the raids they spent months making. "Welfare gear" (I hate that term) existed in TBC, too; you could lose 10 arena games a week and get a full set of epics. Blizz continued this so that people who reached 80 late could actually stand a chance of getting into raiding, unlike in the past where you were pretty much stuck with shitty BoJ gear and having to run old content no one cared about anymore.
---
Guess it just depends on what you focus on. I'm more of a mechanics guy, and in that sense WOTLK is closer to vanilla. I also care a lot about accessibility over exclusivity, so I really didn't like TBC all that much.
---
Meh let's just do classic.
---
"Goddess of The Moonlight Knights"
---
We found an original Moonguardian.
---
We don’t even know if addons will be compatible with this client.
---
A boss' parry chance has no relation to how HARD an attack hits the player.
---
I agree that threat will be more of an issue on classic than on private servers, but that has no bearing on per-hit damage taken.
---
What is funny about the beta and guild/general chat there is that there are so many old accounts that old vanilla joke comes to life.
---
How do you know if someone played vanilla?  They’ll tell you.
---
Definitely not gnome, for obvious reasons. No healers, no raid.
---
Human lacks hunter and druid. You can totally live without a druid, but hunters are kind of required for tranq shot. Technically you can do MC without tranq shot if you overgear it by a lot, but let's be real.
---
Dwarf lacks druid, mage and warlock. That means no decurse, which really sucks. You can probably get through MC with resto pots, but I'm not sure that would cut it much further.
---
Night elf lacks paladins, mages and warlocks. I don't think you could pull it off. Blessings will be too important, especially if you have no casters and thus need much more melee DPS.
---
Tauren misses priest, mage, warlock and rogue. It's just too many classes.
---
Orc misses druid, priest and mage. You could totally raid with just shaman healers, people already do that on speedruns. Missing mage is *technically* possible if you're allowed to bring water from outside the raid, but you're also missing decurse.
---
Undead lacks druid, shaman, hunter. If there was another way to deal with enrage, this race would probably be viable.
---
Troll misses druid and warlock. You can totally raid without these two classes. I've been in plenty of raids where we happened to have none of one or the other that night. This is the winner.
---
&gt; Overall, the Druid tank, EVEN IF THE HEALERS ARE ABLE TO KEEP HIM ALIVE, will have massive **mana issues**, and will more often than not run OOM before the boss is dead.
---
Wut?
---
&gt;Black lotus on private servers have a normal respawn CD, providing flasks at discretion for everyone. In Classic, Black lotus respawn CD is 4 hrs, which basically means far less flasks available.
---
If lotuses are available often enough that 40 players are able to flask on private servers then it stands to reason that guilds will be able to buy 3 flasks for their tanks even with the nerfs.
---
This single sentence prove you dont have the slightest clue about anything you are saying. :)
---
Fun fact: Night elf hunters are the most likely to tame cats
---
I hope so. 
---
Tbc is my favorite expansion. 
---
Zul'aman runs and isle daily's so much fun. 
---
Hyjal raid, black temple. 
---
Sunwell for those that can get past BT. 
---
They should just release servers for all expansions and let people play what they want.
---
I want it specifically because I DIDN'T play classic, I started in tbc. I want the beta to figure out which class I want to play and stuff so that I can be ready for launch :(
---
Would love BC, but they need to make it its own thing, so folks who want to stay Vanilla have that option. People have been vocally wanting Vanilla servers since BC came out, this would start that all over again.
---
meh, depends
---
&gt;  I also don't think a druid can effectively tank rag
---
Resistance gear for Druids is much better than Warrior resist gear so this isnt true.
---
A Warrior will have less HP, Armor and threat generation than a Druid if both wear gear to get them to 315 Fire Res.
---
I don't remember anyone chain-pulling heroics in greens and blues at first, and [Loken killed more people than anyone throughout WOTLK.](https://www.engadget.com/2008/12/04/loken-the-most-dangerous-mob-in-the-game/)

Blizz continued this so that people who reached 80 late or wanted to switch mains could actually stand a chance of getting into raiding, unlike in the past where you were pretty much stuck with shitty BoJ gear and having to run old content no one cared about anymore.
---
Also AFAIK dailies as they were known in TBC and WOTLK don't really exist anymore.
---
Guess it just depends on what you focus on. I'm more of a mechanics guy, and in that sense WOTLK is closer to vanilla than anything after WOTLK. I also care a lot about accessibility over exclusivity, so I really didn't like TBC all that much.
---
He admits it wasn’t for the memes, just a mistake. The most common spelling mistake, which I’ve seen in WoW for over a decade. 
---
And “specc” is a common form of spec that has been used as long as “rouge” or any other WoW term, it’s been around much longer than “thicc” and I doubt it’s a play on that.
---
Lol what?
---
I listed trillion reason why its bad. Shield, no offensive utility, priest himself really lackluster, he can only jse cloth etcetc. Not my fault you cant read/think for urself
---
So you just want a one off WoW vanilla remake with zero changes..what a waste.
---
Do you honestly think everyone is so excited about just having a Vanilla remake when private servers provide a completely adequate experience already?
---
Why don't you just go play on a 1.12 private server?
---
Holy gamma batman!
---
Well, to be honest im not really worried about nameplates, I think blizzard will nerf the distance to appropriate level. But how does it raise the skill cap in pvp? Most classes can perform spells around 30yards. Just so everyone can "spy" on everyone and see through the hills and buildings? Imagine you are peacefully killing gorillas in STV and suddenly you get ganked by 5man raid, who were just crossing by to Booty Bay, but they saw your nameplate in the middle of fcking mountain, so they decided to cross the mountain and kill you. Its a common sense, that you shouldnt be able to see through the textures ingame. Not for long distances
---
This is great. Another option is a craftable one hand sword with blacksmithing, I think it was called Short Copper Longsword or something like that, for level 14 I believe. It's a plan  quest reward for Alliance only, though, a chain quest in Loch Modan. It looks really nice and a great option  for retail mogs.
---
Where can you see these?
---
Damn I just realized that guy (Skarm) was in me and my fiancé’s guild that we led on server. Didn’t know he had these vids!
---
I am wanting to play warrior but I am worried about the trouble of leveling and farming gold. Would it be worth the extra effort to dual box priest/warrior? Would that slow down the leveling process and how much harder would it be while leveling?
---
I'm in Perth and I get 220 ping to US West. I don't think you can get further than WA, so probably quicker in other states. It's really not even that noticeable on retail, though spell batching may make it more rough.
---
&gt; TIL technical imperfections that were made to accomodate connections of 15 years ago are gameplay features.
---
They are, the meta was shaped around that delay and there are many things you wouldn't be able to do without it. Just look up the threads of people wanting Spell Batching back before Blizzard stated that it will return and you'll see what I mean.
---
In Vanilla, a warrior doesn't need to spec in protection to be able to tank. An Arms or Fury can tank leveling dungeons with tanking gear. On my side, doing leveling dungeons is not a must: I can level up on my pace by only doing quests and battlegrounds. Honnestly, I only do leveling dungeons for quests only, that's all.
---
Boycotting tanks is also not an issue for me, I can roll one if I want (in WoTLK, I rolled a protection paladin as main spec and holy as second spec). I could roll a warrior just for that.
---
Wouldn't be fair to everyone else.
---
Dude are you like actually insane or in the process of having a mental breakdown? Do you want me to call somebody for you?
---
It's not.
---
You have two warrior tanks, both spamming battleshout. This was done in vanilla by several top guilds.
---
August 27th, presumably :P   
---
sass aside, we dunno
---
144hz is worth even If you do desktop internet browsin, everything is so much more smoother (this coming from a 240hz user xd)
---
Yes we do
---
A sub 5 days /played time definitely requires practise and a well planned route. Going in fresh without I’d say you are looking at more like 8-10.
---
It's insane that you called me "entitled". I guess your plan is rolling a warrior (let's say Arms or Fury for leveling and then switch to protection for pre-raids/raids). Am I guessing right?
---
Id already been persuaded but this is basically the answer I was looking for. Thanks bro.
---
I can’t remember if hearting took off the second all grown up buff of not.
---
Hi, /u/ConsensualDoggo
---
Now you are prepared, young Padawan.
---
Id already been persuaded. But if I cant put it like that then you can't say 5% extra crit at 25% = 1 extra crit every 20th swing lol. That's not how it'd end up in practice. Though I already agree that sword spec is actually the best.

I’m thinking about doing skinning/mining and having a bank alt that enchants and tailors. Send all my mats to said alt to sell on the auction house and make bags eventually
---
meh, you do you
---
yeah if u focus on pvp
---
Sadly, my pitchfork skill is at zero.
---
No, Vurtne played UD...
---
In pve: You are a healer, you keep the tank alive, keep the buffs on your mates and change the aura depending on the enemy
---
In pvp: you keep your team alive, you clean viper sting enemy debuffs, you give freedom to dispel mage ice. Also if you go shockadin you will have enough burst to take down one guy. Usually the rogue/hunter who are harassing your healers or the clothie who overextended.
---
Without the illustration, I don’t think I would have understood this

Not sure if spell batching works for clickable objects in game, I saw Asmon in WSG litterally pick up the flag (it was on his body) but the horde runner was still able to cap the other flag in the same instant.
---
One thing I would add is unique classes. 
---
Overtime Blizzard watered down every class with passive/active heals to make solo content easier. 
---
Unique abilities like Eyes of the Beast were removed and classes all started to merge and feel very similar.
---
If you think Vanilla Vets will bash you for not knowing everything, you will be disappointed. 
---
Most of us are in our early 30s and are not one of those 15 year old brats who do nothing but popping pimples, eating Pringle’s &amp; playing video games. 
---
Don’t worry, you’ll find more friendly &amp; welcoming people in Vanilla WoW than in any other game you’ve ever played.
---
Hello miss information
---
hahaha take that pserver heroes you so bad ahahah!11
---
Find a instant 60 pserver and try all classes
---
Weird. It's like a reflex for me to accept invites when I'm doing a quest that has 'kill X things'
---
Come join us in r/keto
---
9/10 people accept my invites. Some people just don't like people and have no social skills.
---
Shut the fuck up trolling piece of shit.
---
Read the last sentence of my original post.
---
fucking idiot.
---
cant stand retail for more than 30 Minutes unfortunately
---
Your examples are really bad. 
---
I want longer range nameplates so FC can't hide for 5 hours in a WSG.
---
Well now you know so that is good
---
It makes up for the fact horde doesn't get blessing of salvation or an extra healer on par with a priest.
---
Different Demograpgics to get diverse feedback.
---
Is it that hard to come up with that?
---
I did have 2 PTRs yes, one of which were removed without me asking and I got the invite to the first stress test shortly after!
---
Correct, you must allow the Warrior the charge and the Rogue/Druid the opener.
---
All that effort. For something you’ll replace in 2 hours
---
Where do you get the impression that a streamer will report less bugs than anyone else?
---
Most people who sound so entitled about invites just want to play, not  contribute
---
Omg no it's not a game! It is super serious and we are all too socially awkward apparently to say "sorry I'm raiding today so I can't play with you" 
---
There is no fun in taking the game lightly, if you don't get addicted to it and only play it to win then how can you feel like you achieved something in life?
---
What about roots, or travel form or bear stun... No escape lol, they got more escape then any class .
---
i had 2 PTRs and wasn't properly flagged because of it. i figured because I had 2 PTR, this is why i wasn't flagged, so i contacted CS to remove one. Blizz then found out having 2 PTR actually was the issue, and they ran a script to detect anyone who was supposed to be flagged and had 2 PTRs to remove one and add the test instead. I asked CS to remove mine, so  I didn't get flagged then. It wasn't until the next day that they flagged my account. But the way yours was flagged and mine was different than most of the people who got the stress test. I wonder if that's why we still have ours.
---
Very imo. Dual boxing works when the characters can respond easily to the same single key strokes. If you had a warrior every time you charged you would no longer have your characters in the same geographical position and then any directional inputs would no longer be affecting your characters in the same way.  Better off finding a priest to level with or splitting gold from some sort of activity at 60 with another player.
---
&gt;A boss' parry chance has no relation to how HARD an attack hits the player.
---
No one said it does. Imagine downvoting someone because you're too fucking stupid to read basic English and can't understand what they were saying.
---
Bosses will have higher DPS in Classic because the higher parry chance means they get haste a lot more often. Who fucking cares what the "per hit" damage is, the fact is with triple parry chance, Classic bosses have way higher DPS than on private servers.
---
Unpopular opinion: Any silly game mechanic you can't figure out yourself by playing the game the intended way is not a good game mechanic.
---
Well all I can say is that you are wrong and its a very reasonable example. Not much to say about it really. From what I can see here, you want to destroy big part of vanilla by 80y nameplates for your personal problem with FC in wsg. Glad you are not in charge in Blizzard, you need to look at things from all the perspective, not just the one you want
---
45.
---
Yeah, you didn’t run a major raiding guile’s bank then. Dealing with all the ZG and AQ shit? That was hours just in itself.
---
Ubi you have just saved me! Thank you so so so so much. I had no idea where I would ever find this &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I honestly care two shits why it is good. It is fucking great.
---
I just downloaded it a couple days ago, I can’t wait to read through it again.
---
Roots is situational, travel form is not immune to cc, enemies will want to cc you to pin you for the kill when you're low  and bear stun it provided youre in bear form. Which is situational again. Not to mention shifting takes a ton of Mana and if you have no Mana, you're dead in the water.
---
Yeah right, that is why private servers got so much wrong. Because people remember it so well.
---
How can people find bugs in the beta of a new game? They must have superpowers.
---
That's probably true. I apologize for derailing this question, I did not intend for it to get so far off track.
---
What are these stress tests people keep talking about?
---
And less importantly but maybe related, do you know if you will have to have an active sub to create your characters once place holders go live? I don't wanna waste 2 weeks of sub if I can help it tbh
---
Exactly, who is this post aimed at? The wow addict who plays only to win, doesn't have fun other than when he wins, is too socially awkward to say no I'm busy raiding or pvping? 
---
I would be upset with my life if I needed op advice tbh
---
It is you who does not understand tanking. I did nothing but tanking for 2 years in vanilla as my main was a warrior.
---
Their parry chance has way higher significance than their armor or damage.
---
Every time I hear those soft piano notes whenever I first walked or took a flight path into Dun Morogh it fills me with joy.
---
Isn't Master of Elements better than Burning Soul? It basically only affects Scorch. Kind of underwhelming.
---
Sad but i cant realy stay log in retail. Its like can i do m+ or raid? Well no u need ap do wq and islands
---
I can't go back to retail after simply watching a little classic
---
Anyone know the name of this song?
---
Reported and blocked. We will not hear from you again.
---
Shifting removes cc.
---
And yet you don't understand that the person he was replying to is spouting nonsense that classic will be harder based solely on parry chance, whilst ignoring that bosses hit harder on private servers.
---
Parry haste will absolutely not make up that damage difference. 
---
Imagine caring about karma.
---
More pro's than cons with longer range nameplates.
---
The key is to go resto lol
---
At least at 60 
---
But strength is your main damage stat
---
Judging from this and another commenter you posted here, I can only assume that your wife cheated on you with a bear tank and you're trying to remain relevant.
---
Can't shift with no mana
---
Well, tell me
---
The warcraft 2 manual will always be my favourite. Mete a art was amazing.
---
What are your thoughts on 21/8/22 or 31/8/12?
---
Before they choose the patch that was the goal. And before even that they said you think you do but you don’t. A little like you sound now.
---
They are doing some changes. 
---
And where else are we who think they are missing a core thing supposed to turn?
---
Enjoy your summer before you no life it
---
TBC best WoW.
---
Rogues are good at getting flag returns.
---
&gt;This was done in vanilla by several top guilds.
---
No idea from which badly configured private server this rumor came, but no, it wasn't.
---
To make sure, I just did a quick google search for warriors tanking Vek'lor, and, as expected, came up with nothing. Your statement has been debunked.
---
I agree with with all that minus if you can move out of bed you can work lol totally depends what job you doing
---
Ye /u/Hyper1on is right, it should be the usual Battle Shout instead of Thunder Clap.
---
I'm hoping it's on their list of things to fix but as it's super low priority (obviously) it will probably be one of the last things they worry about when they are done with major bugs and there is still time
---
Slippery slope, people'll start asking for more QoL's from retail.
---
Its a super talent, and horde generally has the advantage in 1v1, in group pvp though paladins are much better than shamans so it balances out
---
Lmao, I don't even see the point of these guys trying to argue asspulled math with you. Vanilla content is easy as shit on a mechanic level so anything can work, sounds like r/classicwow meta slaves brigading again.
---
Humans, Dwarves, Trolls, Night Elves, and Tauren each have two healer classes and should be likely to go pretty far as a result, although Nelves and Tauren have a lack of ranged and melee diversity, respectively, if you just consider optimal choices. Although a lack of both Priest and Warlock means Twin Emps will likely be the stopping point for an all-tauren raid. A human-only raid should be able to do just about anything provided they can handle anything that need Tranq Shot to beat.
---
Link a video or similar proof then, because I am not buying it.
---
And thus the GW2 raiding scene repeats itself. A bunch of manlets being overly toxic about fucking easy raids because we have better access to information now.
---
there are banshees in winterspring?
---
I just want access to one stress test, please :(
---
Because he is an addict who plays hardcore In an unhealthy way.
---
I assume he would be the type to rage and say noob to people.
---
Str but it's pretty hard to get str on mail, so you basically only have rings/neck/cloak
---
Did someone test the tauren hunter deadzone in beta or stresstest? How is it ?
---
Pservers aren't far off, and the math is overtuned on bosses to be harder. Please stop parroting this.
---
That's an easy decision for me i'll just wait.  I don't even have BfA expansion and don't plan on wasting my money on it.
---
There are other ways to fix a problem like this then xrealm bgs. Eventually it’s gonna die anyway pve wise and that can’t any bg fix solve.
---
Int and Spirit if you wanna play any group content.
---
Yeah pretty depressing way to live
---
i think you can use trial , you are limited to lv20 , max 10 gold and cannot chat on general.. but it is good to level to 20
---
Not necessarily just devilsaur.
---
Hate to break it to you, but Nexus crystals won't be the only things guilds prepare for content in later stages. We know all the classic content, we know all the fights, we know what's coming and what to do.
---
It's just the way it is, so why bother?
---
We know its not accurate, but that by no means implies classic will be harder. In every case we can compare, vanilla bosses had less armor and often did less damage than on private servers. Even the 14% parry think only has a slight effect on the difficulty of dual wield fury/prot tanking, so it seems reasonable to conclude there is no difference between classic and private servers that will change the meta to such a degree that the info in Skarm's videos is no longer valid.
---
I might be rusty so pinch of salt here but agi got you crit so if you were below 40-45% I think you were best to stack agi when possible. If you were above that then strength for more damage. That was end raid iirc.
---
Ping /u/Sweurny

Judging by his upvotes and your downvotes I'm guessing you are alone on this projection theory.
---
Also don't stalk people's post history as that is fucking weird.

By "is it a troll" I mean, is this someone joking.. Not talking about his race in-game
---
Well the answer to the PServer Kiddies is the same we give to the Convenience-Complainers:

Stay on PServers =)

EU, less-to-no streamers.

It is disabled in the Beta, but will work the same as on Retail in Release.

Just another reason why I am glad the german realms won't have any big streamers :P

truth

But there are no troll paladins...

Aren't you only able to train new weapon skills at lvl 10?

50 happiness. for reference one tick of feed pet with level appropriate food gives your pet 35 happiness. if dismissing your pet makes it run away then you have no idea what youre doing and should find a new hobby
---
can't wait to see these grown adults reacting normally to losing in an event like this, /s
---
I had never given a second thought toward wanting to revisit vanilla until I watched this video back during MoP era. It was the first time I ever felt real nostalgia for wow. It was that feeling that led me to nostalrius and now classic! It would be cool to get an ama from this guy.
---
3.00 onehanded sword...thats insane
---
What if, in fact, you are that mistake. That you are the toxic one and not the other one. What happens if your co-worker is actually better than you at this game and you want to spoil his time to get some pass?
---
Is that some \[The Nicker\] I'm seeing there?
---
Well its a discussion thread and honestly if at least 2 OG players who played druid had no clue about this, im willing to bargain more wouldnt as well.
---
Please direct your attention to the weekly LFG threads (linked in the sidebar) intended for guild recruitment.
---
Personally, I'd go EU. You will probably take 2-3 m months to level anyways, then u can raid IF possible, or focus on dungeons/making money for later. Then once you go back to EU, you can get started playing regularly with raiding.
---
Assuming druid has mana
---
Funny shit on Blackrock.
---
Was it Dirtyauction who got that Shatari Skyguard exalted trinket and Blizzard took it and fixed so twinks couldn't get it?
---
Is this possible with Undead? Power to the Forsaken
---
If you actually want to train for classic wow you should start doing push ups. Increasing the strength of your wrist and forearm muscles makes you less likely to get carpal tunnel.
---
With inflation, $15 a month, 15 years ago, is actually 30% more expensive. 
---
With the average inflation rate sitting around 2% per year, you actually paid 30% more to play WoW 15 years ago than you did today. 
---
Perspective is everything, knowledge too.
---
There is another option that cannot be named.
---
I made sure to check the rules, but didn't see any about this, I'm also on a phone, so that might be how I didn't see it... I'll try and figure something out
---
I am going with secound build you posted, but i am thinking about putting 5 points from Lethality to MoD
---
Having the new models for player characters would create a strong juxtaposition with the rest of the NPCs in the world. You would be this nice shiny new orc fighting centaurs that look like....well did you see them in the beta? That would either break your immersion super hard or compel blizzard to remake/upgrade every single other model in the game to even it out with the new character models...which would be wayyy too much work. My motto is: who gives a fuck what your character looks like as long as the gameplay is fun and keeps you logging on every day out of enjoyment.
---
I brought up similar concerns about burning out in the beta and that’s why they won’t raise the cap. And their response was “lol if you get burned out playing classic, this isn’t the game for you”
---
Yet it’s very real getting all burned out on limited content in classic.
---
TIL my mom was an asshat.
---
Let’s not forget tbc’s flying mounts killed world pvp in many ways.
---
Thanks for feedback
---
They post new ones every Monday.
---
I know she's totally board, she def wants to play wow..
---
The Plaguelands were absolutely fucking amazing..I was pretty young so that place was where I was like wow will I ever make it there? And when I actually could do the content it felt so good.
---
I was mainly asking because I couldn't remember if it did and maybe that was the reason many hunters didnt dismiss.  Will fully admit every time I pulled half a dungeon it was because I was an idiot.
---
Oh, ok, I'll check tomorrow then!
---
this is capped at 30 right? Whats the point of a duel tournament in vanilla actually? This game is not exactly famous for its high skill cap
---
But where is *bajheera*
---
I see. Thanks for your answer. I now have something to thing about. It is tough choice.
---
Well yeah was Kinda harsh but many ppl is looking for IF they are sick nowdays sure depends how sick you are
---
40 hunters would be something to see
---
40 hunters with 40 pets
---
What is dead zone and what does it mean that it's coming back?
---
I might be able to elaborate. WoW was easier than other MMO's of the day. this is because WoW removed the 1 thing other MMO's had at the time. That is negative progression. You could literally lose levels if you died too much. You could lose your corpse and if it was in a spot that  you could not get to in a timely manner. The corpse would rot with all your gear and money on it. raids took hours in WoW? heh. childsplay. Plane of Air raids took days. 3 day Alterac valleys was the closest things WoW had to multiday raids. Everquest featured actual collisions between characters. meaning that when a world boss spawned. and guilds were mobilizing 50-100 people per raid. it was 1st come 1st serve. Guilds would have shamans cast grow spells on ogres/trolls and those people would sit in front of doorwars blocking the entrances to the boss from other guilds. While the guild blocking the path would summon their raid past the bouncers. This happened all the time.  
---
WoW was the 1st MMO that featured quest hubs and quest markers over NPC's heads. WoW was the 1st mmo to remove negative progression. WoW was also the 1st mmo that featured seamless zoning. This was an achievement, and still is today.
---
The way questing worked in Everquest was not point and click. You had to type. For example:  
---
 \*target NPC\* and type /hail
---
NPC: hello "simplepirate". watch out for those \[crushbone orcs\] down the road.
---
player: what crushbone orcs?
---
NPC: The crusbone orcs is a clan of orcs that moved in near Kelethin. Bring me their crushbone belts as proof of their demise.
---
The key words were bracketed and you had to converse with the NPC to get the quest. There was maye 25 quest in the entire game of Everquest. Grinding was how you leveled up.  
---
Reputation grinds was another WoW made easier. In Everquest there was religion reputation. When making your character. You could choose 1 of over 12 gods. or Agnostic. This choice would determine what cities you could or could enter. Same with race. If you choose a Dark elf. You got the best night vision in the game. Akin to Predator heat vision. night times in Everquest were no fucking joke. non darkelf/gnome races had to use torches. OR wait for sun up. If you choose Dark elf. You were Kill on site by the human city guards.
---
When Verant introduced the epic weapon quests. it took me over 6 months to complete my singing steel shortsword for my bard. This sword was so game chaning for bards becuase it gave 80% bonus to singing based songs(bard spells) and it acted like the basic version of every instrument. In Everquest a bard could put down swords. pick up a 2h lute/drum/flute/horn and the song/spells would get a bonus.  
---
[pics of a high end bard after 3 years of raiding in everquest before wow was released.](https://imgur.com/a/uGMNpOF)
---
Resto Shamans don’t need Spirit.
---
Do we know if Rep Cloth turn ins will be available right away, or in a later phase?
---
Where my Boogaras at?
---
They have no reason to raise the cap. 30 is a good spot. Good content to enjoy. Good bugs to figure out. They just raise the cap more and more, people will be doing level 60 content. It’s a beta, you’re just playing a portion of the game. No reason to keep giving more and more content for a beta.
---
To be fair I would prefer to know that there was plenty of autistic veterans testing everything as much as they could rather than say, a titty streamer.
---
yeah i also think so
---
The stresstests are basicly for blizzard to try out their servers and if they can handle the amount of people logging in, doing actions and in general playing the game. 
---
When they open for the public to reserve names, you will be needing a subscription to be able to do it.
---
All info about both of the questions are on the  [https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) page.
---
Following. I to would like to know but probably not going to happen prior to release or at least when they raise the level so a hunter can Solo tame
---
Master of Elements affects literally nothing unless you run out of mana. You shouldn't run out of mana in a 1v1, and even a 1v2 should be OK as long as you have a mana gem. At later gear levels you won't even need a mana gem in all likelihood (and note that due to scaling off your crit, MoE is actually more effective at later gear levels to begin with).
---
Damage pushback resistance is way more important than people like to give it credit for. I tend to find people just go "Oh just sheep the pet and you're good", yeah but that means having to sheep it first and ensuring you then don't use AoE's near it. If there's a Hunter + literally anyone else you're helpless as you'll want to prioritise the sheep on the other player. You also have nothing against Warlocks, which are already a difficult class for you. And in general, damage pushback is very bothersome. If another mage knows you don't have Burning Soul they can legit bait out a CS on their main school and then just Arcane Missile you down while you flail around doing like 2.5s cast Scorches. The only saving grace is that very few mages are good enough to do this. Even Shamans can just throw down a Searing Totem and it'll screw you hard.
---
I'd rather drop Incinerate or Critical Mass for MoE if you feel your mana pool is lacking too much, or you just like not having to be overly concerned about your mana usage. I think the amount of lenience that Burning Soul gives you by being able to disregard damage pushback and focus on actually killing instead makes it a top tier talent. I'd say top 5 if not top 3.
---
I am not, friend. I am thatos from arthas server hunter
---
Yup can't buy T2 with gold
---
It's pretty evident to me that this is a result of the modern shader in use with the new engine. I'm personally okay with this, as it ends up with the net overall "whole" looking better.
---
To "fix" this, it might be possible in settings to disable the modern shaders by turning shadow quality down to minimum or off, and possibly tinker with a few other settings like Depth Effect.
---
Yes, I believe blizzard said you will need a sub to create characters early. Yes Blizzard gets 2 weeks of your paid sub. My hope is it helps Blizzard gauge the demand and spin up more realms if needed.
---
hard to say
---
it's still releasing the 27/8.
---
I'm just a fan of WoW, all expacs have its good things. The story is BfA has some problems, but also good and epic moments. Music is always awesome. Zuldazar and Kul tiras are so beautiful, and i kind of love mythic plus dungeons and class gameplay. 
---
I really enjoy pvp arena, and some form of world pvp.
---
I mean, it's still the world of Warcraft !
---
Yeah AV so fun as a range character, sucks to be melee
---
-Is the the mining helmet (from goblin engineering) useful ?
---
-Can all the ammo the engineer can craft be exchange for arrow to the NPC ?
---
-Is the dwarf racial (Guns skill increased by 5) noticeable for hunter ?
---
-At which level do you hit honored to get the 10% discount in your own faction ?
---
Thanks for your help
---
I haven't played pservers in quite a while, but i've seen that number thrown around a lot so i'm going off that. And looking at some of the massive changes to talent trees i wouldn't be surprised if it were true.
---
Haha I had a minor stroke when I read that too.  I recovered by assuming that he was on a pvp realm and his new alli friends were on the same realm.
---
Of course it makes up for the difference. Attacks per second matters more than the damage of their individual hits when it comes to a bosses DPS long term. The more attacks there are, the more chances there are that the boss critted and so on.
---
FFXIV does it for the xpac classes, it's fine. Level in one class, switch when you're high enough for the one you really wanted, they give you a little starter pack of okay level-appropriate gear for the new one and off you go. 
---
That questline sounds so cool though, and I don't even like DKs.
---
I can't make up my mind about going priest or warrior. I guess I'll change my mind several times before launch as well lol
---
Hunter is the way to go, mage gas way too much downtime
---
Been testing on pservers
---
Good question!
---
I feel like I'll be tired of the game before I get to play it with all the coverage it's getting
---
Found the guy who skips every thread asking about ret paladin.
---
Nah you can from level 1. It does cost 10 silver though
---
this would have signifcant impact on the brilliant shard supply and could mean pricier enchants, good catch! hope they adress profession progression soon :)
---
In the Beta, you can train weapons other than polearms at level 1.
---
There are lot of really good quotable lines in there, absolutely loving all three movies, and Blazer's entrance by itself probably responsible for half of the retribution population in WoW
---
&gt; Let me reacquaint you with death
---
Bank alt with style.
---
What's more enjoyable about leveling as a lock?
---
Clear out your Steam backlog?
---
Hey man, 10 days off that stuff is incredible too, so a year is amazing. Power to you.
---
Private servers have usually intervened and increased the spawnrate of the major component in flasks. Blizzard has stated previously that they won't intervene in this sense.
---
So my guess would be. Not manditory at all, only for those top .1%, who plays the game way to serious.
---
No, it was increased to 40 in patch 3.3.

Why do you wanna go Enhancement?
---
There was a bug with Seal of the Crusader. It's supposed to make you attack faster, but for less damage. With the bug, it would just make you attack faster.
---
Paladin levelling was slow before the bugfix, and just got painful after that. There was even a quasi-apology in the patch notes.
---
This is just a comparison to EQ and WoW, also played EQ SK Delf, Let’s not pretend those planes were hard they just took so long that most players never saw them. They were all about a very simple timed button press, with bosses and mobs that had a health pool far to large for anyone’s good. I loved plenty of things about EQ but never did it have the mechanics of NAX nor did it appeal to people like WoW did. Yes WoW was more casual but the raids were much for fun than EQ. 
---
EQ and WoW both had strong communities and also toxic ones.
---
Talent trees? There's no pserver with previous than 1.12 talents. And comparing to vanilla footage is kinda unfair becausae of all the differences in skill/gear/consumables.
---
Fallacy, the post.
---
Talking about personal attacks...
---
You won't get to 60 anyways so why does it matter?
---
Wait so why is this Horde only? 
---
The rules seem pretty garbage, I mean hunters can’t get down their own trap but warriors get the free charge?
---
To be fair they said 'more enjoyable' so it's not wrong even though both are awful.
---
that is true, 15 bucks back in 2004 was comparable to like 25 now
---
Alliance will consist of raid leaders who want to play Ret Pally and the rest of the guild that follows them. Horde will be everyone else.

There might not be any videos but here is a blog post by a top vanilla raider describing the tactic: https://www.method.gg/wormie-s-classic-vanilla-the-temple-of-ahn-qiraj
---
and no dwarf shamans. Ofc i switched those out because of faction..
---
Nice video; only points I can add are that I think getting level 4 training would have sped things up and you missed a quest after the chief part to pick up a map and is really so/hr efficient
---
You make it what you want it to be like. I know plenty of warrior mains who says it's a pain but as soon as they get a few major talents(as early as level 20-24) and they keep up with weapon progression. It's smooth sailing all the way to 60.
---
Deep assasination sucks is my thoughts. Too much damage way too little utility.
---
well do you want to heal or dps?
---
thats really what it comes down to
---
Also hunter no pre trap but warriors can get free charge is pretty autistic
---
Priest isnt so bad to lvl and is fun if you have a warrior friend in group you can just run through quests the 2 of you
---
Hope these questions aren't too dumb.
---
Will there be transmogs, or account wide mounts or anything like that?
---
True, true.
---
From my experience with the stress test, I believe they will already be in the game. I recall seeing the turn in at SW.
---
Yeah and it really bugs me when people say stuff like "oh classes in vanilla were so unbalanced, only X Y and Z class are worth bringing!", completely disregarding the unique things each class brings. Pallies might not do the most damage but neither will your rogues without Might, warlocks are uncommon but you sure do miss summoning and soulstones.
---
Classes were balanced around being different. There was a rock-paper-scissors balance in PvP and in PvE every class had a role even if they weren't topping the meters. And even if one spec wasn't useful in one situation doesn't mean it won't work for something else. I am so looking forward to actual class fantasy again, and not everyone just being a different reskin.
---
Yes, that's what Im getting at. A faster attackspeed and more use of abilities will lead to higher probability of back to back parries.
---
Those hasted attacks will also eat Shield Block charges and leave Warriors crushable. Without armor cap and substantially higher health pool than Druids, this will hurt a lot more than for the Druid player.
---
Having retried tbc, fuck no. It gets several major things wrong and breaks immersion for me completely.
---
This sub and it's weird obsession with retail is fucking ridiculous
---
Its drawing a paralell to this thread and how the bitching and moaning only makes the game less desirable
---
All these people exagerate studying so much. Unless its your exams to graduate med school or something then you are lying, no one studies for 12+ hrs a day 7 days a week. Just pay attention in class, take notes, re-read your notes every night before sleep, study for about 1 hour every day. You'll see a HUGE difference. Learning everything word by word by forcing yourself to study 10-12hrs is not the key to anything. Work smart not hard is a real thing.
---
Numbers may be off but for a Hunter the deadzone was between 5-8 yards of distance away from them. 5 Yards was thir melee limit and you could only range targets who were at least 8 yards away. It was quite a skill to always know where that deadzone was against a hunter as it meant they couldn't attack you at all if you were a caster.
---
No there will not be
---
This parryhaste affects prot warriors too. The damage taken thanks to parryhaste will remain similar to private servers when comparing across each tank. 
---
Arguably it affects them more because they have more attacks being parryhasted due to sheer volume.
---
Thats kind of lame i guess, these are stuff you normally try to prevent :D
---
Third button: play a classic private server until August
---
I look forward to 40 man run DKP drama, drama around who manages to get their hands on Sulfuron and Thunderfury, drama around gaming the climb up the honor ladder, etc. 
---
There are gonna be a lot of tears when newbies to classic realize how hard it was (both time and social drama) to gear up and how much difference that raid quality gear made in terms of performance.
---
Most likely and hopefuilly they won't allow nexus crystals before AQ because it completely nullifies the value of them. But no we haven't heard anything specific about this yet.
---
But they're gonna spend their free time watching wow classic videos and on this subreddit. Which will only make the craving worse imo
---
My first 60 was a warrior in vanilla. You are harder to kill so if you have 50% health feel free to keep pulling quest mobs, especially melee type mobs. Heal up full as needed with tavern food or while traveling. Use those heal potions that drop instead of vendoring. Learn bandages. People say warriors are slow but maybe other classes are just fast. I had no real trouble gathering mines on my prot warrior at 60.
---
Because 1440p at 144hz can be incredibly demanding. More so than 4k at 60hz.
---
Heavy Copper Longsword? It's a two hander.
---
Shout out to DarkStorm - Al'akir, i remember you guys!
---
what makes you say that
---
&gt; Gnomes probably wouldn't get far as they have no healing classes
---
I never realized that, TIL!
---
Depennds on if trib solo is possible. If yes then hunter, otherwise mage is arguably better thanks to brd solo, if that's doable.
---
As gamers it is our responsibility to support the new games that are being released. Like minded individuals are spending their time and energy trying to peruse their careers in creating video games. I’ll be playing what games I can get my hands on until classic release, cuz you can bet your ass I’ll be no life-omg Classic for ~3 years after release
---
Careful, this is not the way of the circlejerk.
---
&gt;Are you moron?
---
Yikes
---
Eh, I feel like if I play the whole Classic all the way up to Naxx, I’d be open to migrating by char to a TBC after I’ve had enough.
---
But I’d be fine with OSRS type of new content as well
---
Isn't Private Server footage on this sub a no no?
---
What else can you say? I understand #nochanges but have common sense against cheaters ffs.
---
Is no dual spec confirmed? Or just something the community is hoping for?
---
I raided with YCB and DBC on original nost. I wonder what their raid schedule will be like in classic?
---
yeah, but you can toggle those completely off or manually take off the ones that are irrelevant
---
I tanked all the way through Vanilla and my guild ended up clearing 5/15 Naxx. I also have played 3 different Druid tanks on Private servers and cleared AQ40 weekly.
---
I'm not new to tanking. 9% more parry will hurt both Druids and Warriors but Warriors having less armor and a lower total health pool means they get hurt more by the Parry change. The hasted attacks will also eat Shield Block charges and leave Warriors open to Crushing Blows. With 5000 less armor than Druids, the Crushing Blows will hurt a lot more for a Warrior than they do for a Druid.
---
The only real downside to the Parry change is how your initial threat on pull becomes more prone to RNG, but this holds true for Warriors as well. It's easily fixed by going back to the old "Wait for 3 Sunders" playstyle.
---
Mulgore would be solid if they could have a horde raid volunteer to guild the one choke into the zone
---
&gt;It also looks as if the recent Vanilla Friends stats are showing the same story.
---
Are we looking at the same stats? Cause it looks like the Alliance are far more popular.
---
Dear diary, today I called someone stupid on reddit, it made me feel really good.
---
Well if she insisted that illness/sickness was binary and there is only "nearly dead" and "perfectly fine", then yes, I would argue that she was.
---
Idc tbh. For me it would destroy the fun and sense of playing wow. But i guess if someone chooses to powerlvl his mage that way just to reach max a bit faster thats okay.  
---
Anyway I would not want to make that tradeoff anyway.
---
I love how right-wing eastern european millenials who never lived in the USSR love to pretend they know shit about it.  
---
Most people who lived in the USSR regret those times. The only ones who don't are fascists and rich liberals.
---
🙂
---
I don't think this is classic.
---
It wasn't in classic. Why would it be confirmed?
---
All memes aside, movement speed &gt; all.  This is why I decided to roll Druid.
---
I know some people may say that it's unlikely and all...
---
...But we are in a different context now. The players who'll compose the postgame playerbase of Classic are already aware of the benefits of having one faction be the overwhelming majority. It happens in lots of high-population servers in Retail. Not only that - if the elite players *say* that they'll go Horde, the elitists (not exactly the elite) will follow, and their associates will be pressured into following too. It's a snowball effect that happened through the years in Retail, but it's bound to happen quickier in Classic because this time, people *are* prepared, and Social Media is way stronger now.

You can always access the list of different weekly thread topics under "Weekly Threads" in the sidebar. [Here's last week's LFG thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/btk0j2/looking_for_group_monday_may_27_2019/)
---
No decurse bro, no decurse, no raid
---
Like I said, I tended to keep a few spare weapons and bump out those levels as they came.
---
&gt; It also looks as if the recent[ Vanilla Friends stats](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvqed9/vanillafriendscom_celebrates_30000_members/) are showing the same story. 
---
 Am i missing something?
---
# US REGION
---
* **Faction balance**
---
1. Alliance: 9.115 (58.8%)
---
2. Horde: 6.393 (41.2%)  
---
# EU REGION
---
1. Alliance: 8.593 (59.3%)
---
2. Horde: 5.899 (40.7%)
---
I would argue that BarrensChat and some streamers arent enough of a sample size to consider.  
---
Realmpop shows 50% Alliance for EU and 50,8% for Horde (maxlevel chars though, so take it with a grain of salt)  
---
tl;dr: i think were fine
---
Well it seems they haven't 100% decided what sorts of smaller features they want to keep so I was just curious.
---
What a Shaman? :)
---
literally 10x as many threads complaining about people from private servers than actual threads where private server people complain
---
For refernece in the states a big mac cost was $2.90  in 2004 its $5.28 now
---
I got hype about it since it was the one i was coming back to since mop.  think i got like 3 lvls before i dipped.
---
Do they still play or is it just ppl who have played it once before?
---
Something us Americans can understand haha 😭🤮
---
I've played on Pservers for 4 years, they are delusional. Before Classic came out they thought they were 99% accurate LOL
---
Sure thing tough guy
---
There is nothing QoL about the barber shop.
---
2 - engineers can actually craft arrows too 
---
3 - not really, most of the good ranged weapons in end game are bows anyway (exception being the pvp gun)
---
Those would be what people played in 2004-2006 not what they're playing this time right?
---
That's awesome dude :D You gonna be playing with them again in classic?
---
I didn't object to that I'm just curious about the reasoning behind it.
---
Well ive Heard the rumors that severel Beta Tester Ehm streamers were reporting Bugs that arent Bugs to begin with. Just because some Mobs were too hard or Droprate too Low....
---
10 minutes of no wtf or even minimun fun momments. WTF?
---
You sound like you are defeated with low self esteem.
---
I had no idea what to do when I hit 60 so I just rolled a new char and leveled him to 60 by which time TBC was a week away.
---
You should check out the site www.vanillafriends.com
---
I hope it will still exist, since I'll be farming instances with my hunter. Will make things a lot easier.
---
Rekt.
---
The counter argument to that is that you also can see them coming and prepare, more knowledge being presented means a higher skill cap bc you have to know what to do with this extra information being displaye on your screen
---
Gotcha thx
---
In such case they have to search for guild willing to take them.
---
Strong disagree.
---
Putting cap to 40 allows them to test every talent in the game.
---
You misspelled streamers
---
I was in Winterspring in retail at the owls. Remember it as Yesterday.
---
Is there a list somewhere of what servers will be home to what streamers so we know which servers to avoid or fanboi on?
---
This is a mistake in private servers.
---
Just get seal of command first.  The rest doesn't matter because you'll be auto attacking 90% of the time
---
Fuck your life up for this game it's worth it
---
Warlock are good, easier to level. But in an other hand they will never be as good as mages in term of dps.. Some will still be needed in raids and you will have some good tools (healstone, soulstone, summon,...) but I don't know.
---
I will just roll priest and level with my wand
---
im enjoying the reeee's. ive spent some time watching old youtubes and having a fun time because of the hype the beta has brought.
---
anyway, out of millions who played back in the day, only a few thousand get in, for various reasons. if you dont can you make a rant video and link it please :)
---
&gt;the meta
---
A meta for 1% of the players that will be able to consciously do those things that can’t be done without having ancient batch windows. Because of the 1% and their meta that is shaped around half second batch windows, 99% of the other players will be casting an ability and waiting half a second for its effect. 
---
Also the meta was lost gradually as wow improved its network infrastructure and made the game more responsive. A different meta that isn’t based on having half second batch windows is completely unacceptable because #nochanges. It is great that Blizzard is trying to emulate these features of an archaic network infrastructure by moving spells to a lower priority queue that looks awkward and unnatural because “muh meta”.
---
 - You already said that in the existing thread. It didn't need a new dupe topic.    
---
 - Counter-whining is still whining.
---
Damn I’m trying to remember what helm that was?
---
You make a lot of very fair points... I don't think this is what people talk about then they say "no changes" I think this should be something that is fixed. Classic is about the content and how amazing it was... not about keeping broken things broken. People don't realize that stuff like this can completely destroy and economy when you have certain players with massive amounts of gold early on.
---
Your experience may be different if you are an alliance priest. :)
---
they renamed it to Blackrock Slicer for Classic -\_-
---
Is priest hard to level solo? I'm stuck between wanting to make a priest main or a mage main but I'm pretty much going to be playing alone for the most part. I don't want it to be a sucky ride to 60.
---
My opinion only but I think the new player models are shit. Sure the old ones have a low polygon count by today's standards, but I feel that they utterly fucked up the art style in the transition.
---
Gear dependent as in Warrior? I'd say go DD/farmer first and use up your rested XP with your alt while doing dungeons as a tank and grab your gear there.
---
&gt; Fear is waaay more common
---
What? Not it's not and in fact it's easier to counter fear than it is to counter stuns. Every class that can be undeads can use their pvp trinkets to remove fear, except for warriors. Against warlocks you can use shadow reflect trinket to reflect fear and you also have the option to get the blacksmith trinket that makes you immune to fear for 30 seconds. Warriors already counter fear pretty hard because of berserker rage so while WotF is still nice to have, its often just a "win-more" tech.  
---
   
---
WotF is not bad by any means but orcs stun resist is, without doubt, superior. There's a lot of stuns in vanilla, though I agree that most of them are random.  
---
As you said hunters got imp. concussive shot (which is 20% 5/5 btw). Warrior got charge, intercept, mace spec and concussion blow. Druid's feral charge does not stun afaik, but they got bash and lets not forget improved starfire (lol). There is spriest blackout and mages impact. Paladin got hammer of justice, rogues got cheap shot, kidney and mace spec. as well.  
---
That's +/- 13 stuns from classes alone (I might have forgot some). Then of course there's items as well which are all quite common in PvP i.e. grenades, tidal charm and the unstoppable force.  
---
So basically you are are looking at ~16 stuns vs. ~9 charm/fear/sleep effects.
---
It's really interesting, but I think I'll go with a Smite build. Sure I'll lose Blackout procs, Mind Flay, and Silence, but my heals will be much more efficient and I'll have Smite for 1v1s
---
Wasn’t letting me post it, but I guess it went through.
---
If the window is too large, I would say it's a design error and should be reported as such.
---
Like it was when it was first introduced in WOTLK.
---
I have literally never seen this argument from pserver players. I have only seen people make fun of this argument, not the actual argument itself. And weirdly enough it's always very bad retail players who make the argument too.
---
We have Hearthstone?
---
I know taurens used to use noggenfoggers or deviate fish to change race while tanking some bosses in raids so I assume if they arent in tauren form its reduced to 5 yards
---
Didn't stop five dozen "content creators" from posting their private server footage for "guides".
---
&gt; 1% of the players
---
Where do you have that number from? How do you know that only 1% of players played around the fact that spell batching existed and not much more? 
---
Everyone had to deal with it and it's still in beta anyway. I'm sure they will fix it that way that the majority of people are happy with it.
---
Also, you're speaking of it like your opinion is of the majority, but how would you know that it is? Maybe the majority of players is fine with Spell Batching as it currently is.
---
Don't do any Crafting Professions until you have reached Level 60. Start with either Mining or Herbalism coupled with Skinning for maximum income to buy your level 40 and level 60 Mounts.
---
oh yeah thats nice then
---
We don't know for sure
---
Thanks, I will give it a try on next stress test :P
---
My response is directly about your argument. You stated that, for example, if an addon was *possible* to have been made during vanilla but *wasn't* made, then it shouldn't be allowed by Blizzard. I think that's a ridiculous expectation to have.
---
If you think that certain things shouldn't be allowed simply because players didn't utilize them during vanilla (like addons or console commands), but other things that players do now that they didn't utilize during vanilla (like raid strategies) should be allowed, then you're just being inconsistent with your own logic.
---
Instead, we should be considering 1st, did the thing exist during vanilla? And 2nd, would changing said thing result in better gameplay while still aligning with the principles of vanilla WoW? The hardcore no changes people wouldn't even go to the second point, but Blizzard has already shown that they're considering it with additions of things like the improved mailbox system, flight point stops, graphical updates, layering, etc.
---
My grumpy protector where named Sarvhug, I'd love to be able to have that name for new void in classic.
---
FYI, that's been available for at least a decade.
---
i see :)
---
Alright Classic will be a disaster, hype cancelled. /joke
---
If they wanted to do 40 they should have started out at 40. I don’t think they should raise it. People will keep asking for more releases when the beta ends in July. I’m sure the Devs can internally test the level 40 talents themselves and see if there’s any bugs.
---
Piggybacking off OPs question cause you guys seem to know a thing or two about owning multiple accounts: how do I set up a second account to make level 1 runners? I’m prepared to pay two subscriptions, for atleast one month anyway, but do I make a second account under my current battlenet? Should I just make an entirely new B net account for the second? If it’s the same B net, how do I get two instances of the game to launch with only one Bnet launcher? Thanks in advance
---
Just tank in instances and you'll lvl quite fast and get gear.
---

learn to read
---
&gt;Features that will not be included:
---
&gt;Automatic group matchmaking
---
Honestly, I really feel like that any counter argument just look stupid at this point. Do you really prefer the opportunity of higher skill cap over the true mmorpg feel? Thats suppose to be vanilla isnt it? The true mmorpg feel. I think people want to be nameless, unimportant adventurers in Vanilla and not laser-eye gods. Not to mention, that the skill cap is currently being lowered by spell batching anyway so, if you want to increase skill cap, I would start by removing that bullsht from the game.
---
Nigh Elf also is difficult to tell the skin color as well :(
---
Bring the player not the class... because every class is the same now!
---
I played classic and would prefer the old models tbh. It adds to the feel of the game
---
Well one of the tiers as a couple BoEs, bracers and belt maybe? T1?
---
I forget.
---
Nicely worded and planned out. Was an interesting read.
---
it would be a HUGE feature and i hope they don't implement it
---
Priest is my favourite class to level and I don’t find it slow either.
---
They lack decurse. No decurse no raid.
---
Look at it this way. Your farming gets easier and you're making 80g/h selling mara blues. You're having a great time. However, you rolled on a popular realm. And now, 300 other maxed hunters are also doing this at any given time. That's roughly 24,000G pumped into the economy every hour, because you settled for convenience. Half of these hunters may be bots, or people farming to sell gold. I.e they have no reason to stop, and the number is rapidly increasing as more people hit 60 and need to farm.
---
Yeah I should have headed to the trainer, but I was so far away that I decided to go on :)  
---
But thank you for the advice regarding the map :)
---
Priest is easy to lvl solo, you just need to upgrade your wand frequently, get 5/5 in wand spec and go shadow , at lvl 40 respec for shadow form and take again wand spec, you just need to power word shield , shadow word pain and wand till the mob is dead
---
Some people may be rolling the opposite faction of choice just for the beta. I know that’s what I did in the stress test.
---
Don't worry, I still panic everytime I dismiss like I'm doing something wrong
---
no
---
Oh my goooood that's why he's near "The Marris Stead", it's because it's his house. I never made the connection, I thought it was just some house.
---
Rogues have improved sprint which is equivalent to escape artist, worth 2 taken points.
---
Hahahahahhahahhahahahhha
---
I’m in no rush to do TBC any time soon. Three years away would be fine.
---
Properly scripted private server is an oxymoron
---
What's great is my boss and 3 co workers all play together and talk about it all the time.  They know I play but none of them have my b.net information or know the servers I'm even on.  I've made this mistake before and you can't be sick from work and play wow because now they just think you're skipping work.
---
I have played 2years of ingame time raiding, mainly vanilla untill TBC. I played mostly as enhance shaman, we also had a dedicated druid tank, but was more like the offtank and prot warrior (or dps/offspec warrior) was tanking second (horde side, windfury totems are big). If the sulfurad hammer 4% chance thing ever dropped, I would have had the legendary 2H mace. It was a chill semi-top pve server guild on EU, bronzebeard.
---
Exactly, Hardiness has next to no benefit in PVE. Most of the CC in dungeons/raids tend to be a fear or such, not a stun.
---
Good one. Just saying triggered because you’re too mentally limited to think of an actual response.
---
Play 1.12 private server. Work on your leveling route.
---
Lol yes. People choose it for the upper face with a big beard on, then get a helmet that trims the mustache, then they see that haha
---
Hoo Lee sheet
---
Also important to note that seal of the crusader buffed initial damage on first swing with each swing after dealing less damage than the one before or was supposed to. So it was literally just a 30% dmg and haste increase while broken.
---
I don't need it. I have my Vanilla Box right here.
---
Steaming is cancer, especially in a fundamentally multiplayer game.
---
Streaming is the single 2019 sensibility I am worried about negatively affecting the game.
---
I'd like them to have less changes. They are changing many things already and it is making me nervous.
---
I'll be rock hard I tell you hwat
---
I leveled a warrior in vanilla and I really enjoyed it. I don't remember exactly when, maybe around 50 I respeced protection and finished leveling as prot. It took longer to kill mobs but I also took less damage so maybe it balanced out. I found it even more fun honestly. Something cool about having a sword and shield. Maybe you spend a month farming ore to level blacksmithing so you can craft your own plate armor at 40. It won't matter if everyone else thinks you are going slow if you enjoy every minute of it. Just writing that out sounds like so much fun to me and makes me want to level a warrior with mining and blacksmithing all over again!
---
I generally enjoy questing and leveling more than 40 man raids but unlike you I will spend a lot more time in the game playing multiple classes. I will likely play a warrior again but my first 60 will be a warlock because they are good solo levelers and tons of fun. If I had to pick just one class for the ultimate solo/questing/adventuring experience I would probably go warlock or hunter instead of warrior.
---
Your play style sounds like it is much more about the journey than hitting 60. When I hit 60 I tend to start new characters soon because I want that journey again. Going "slow" is going to make the journey even more epic. Ultimately it is your choice. Follow your heart and you can't go wrong.
---
That's interesting. I wonder how quickly it can force things to respawn since nobody in all these years ever noticed it.
---
Not gonna lie, I had doubts.
---
*boom*  
---
BEEP BEEP ♿♿
---
Why not Bring a mage or lock if you want to do high dps
---
In my research, the console command isn't working on private servers and I can't find an analogous command or addon that alters nameplate ranges on a private server the way that players are able to manipulate it on the classic beta.
---
It would be interesting if you knew a way to do it on the 1.12 client. Maybe my Google skills have been lacking. But based on my research it's looking like nameplate range was fixed in vanilla.
---
What am I supposed to think about? What are you in this hierarchy?
---
I hate calling it a nerf. Cause the ability was actually broken. Wasn’t working as intended. So it wasn’t like they saw something and wanted to tweak it. It was a fix. They made the ability function like it should.
---
Priest is my favourite to level. Can recommend.
---
/run --CastSpellByName("Bear Form")
---
/run castBearForm()
---
Cat
---
/run --CastSpellByName("Cat Form")
---
/run castCatForm()
---
Moonkin
---
/run --CastSpellByName("Moonkin Form")
---
/run castMoonkinForm()
---
Travel / Aquatic / Mount
---
These will shift into Aquatic form if you are in the water or the fastest land form you have. Cat form before level 30, Travel form after level 30 with the option to mount by holding down the alt key at level 40.
---
(Before level 30)
---
/run castAquaticForm()
---
(After level 30)
---
/dd travelaquatic
---
(With Mount)
---
Replace "Brown Kodo" with the name of your mount.
---
/run if( IsAltKeyDown() ) then Zorlen_useItemByName("Brown Kodo") else DD__SlashCommandHandler("travelaquatic") end
---
Swamp of Sorrows is my favorite zone. Reminds me of one of my favorite games Resident Evil 4!
---
I just made two different entries for the two servers I played on, but it would be nice to have a better way.
---
To maybe give you another point of topic:
---
Almost everything you do gives a sense of progression or accomplishment. In retail nothing feels worth doing unless you advancing your AP, gear, or getting a mount/achievement. In Classic almost everything feels fun and worth doing, even leveling alts. If I get tired of end game stuff I can go answer World Defense calls and that *feels* like a good use of time. I can to Barrens and offer carries through WC just to help lowbies out and that *feels* good and productive. Retail feels like I'm either grinding for group content or playing a single player game.
---
only direct damage iirc
---
They pay 15 a month, how is that free?
---
A year is fucking badass. Thank you for surviving.
---
Counter-counter whining is still whining
---
We have no server name info as of yet.
---
Play a 1.12 PS. Get a feel of what you would like to do.
---
The average player. The SJW NPCs who hate asmon and esfand for loving our country/president are cultural marxists who want to see us all the same. That's why they hate classic and hate that you have to work for thing in it. They want it to be just like retail with welfare epics. They will tear down and drive out every group of people from the game, even you, best4bond.
---
It is fairly easy for the reasons the previous comment mentioned, I would like to add that you have the huge advantage of having heals so you can get out of situations where some other classes would die.  
---
If you're doing leveling solo but you get quests to a dungeon a huge plus is that it will be extremely easy  for you to find a group since you can heal (and you can do it on shadow spec for the low level dungeons).
---
The Vanilla veteran lean and slim, the sloven private server no lifer going on about meta trying to belittle.
---
A very accurate description.
---
What class is best too use as a bank alt leveled to 35 for max professions?
---
If you are into it, use Questie.
---
That's me, but the other way around. I'll get hyped with every expansion, play a month, play something else. I need the social aspect that's just not there in retail, compared to classic.
---
1 viper sting and spriest can only wand
---
Alt level 5 to disenchant?
---
Will you just not have time to raid or do you think you’ll be too late to the party? If it’s the later no need to worry there’ll be plenty of people in the same boat all wanting to raid with you. Warriors are BiS.
---
You will be able to reserve your character on the servers 2 weeks before launch, until then we don't even know the names of the servers so it is impossible to make any list.
---
Lol, maybe you should block the whole internet.
---
Regardless of what anyone says; it's going to be a painful, never ending, uphill battle against community perception. It's honestly just not worth it.
---
The only time I would say go for it is if you're the GM and you're real life friends are the healers / tanks. That's literally the only non headache inducing choice which if you have that, in jealous of you.
---
It's just a big streamer circle jerk and I would just rather wait to play it when it's live and not do the same grind again back to back.  You're right.
---
Thank you sir, anyone who raided even once can attest to the chaos that is a 40 man raiding.
---
I wager most of the people espousing this nonsense didn’t get to play vanilla, and are trying to establish credibility by suggesting retail is somehow more difficult.
---
I could be wrong, but this is my theory based on what I have seen.
---
They mentioned that all reporting will have a human element. So mass reporting won't be a problem
---
I think I’ll start without it, and maybe use it after a while and see how it goes, thank you :)
---
Its easy bro enh shaman en retri pala only weapon
---
Hunter is the fastest class to level so I'd go with that. You're not doing anything but sitting in a city and crafting so nothing matters besides how fast you can get to level 35 and park in a city.
---
Because a player organized it not blizzard. Asmon is working the alliance one
---
&gt; If they wanted to do 40 they should have started out at 40.
---
No shit.
---
I'm saying it would still make sense for them to raise it to 40 for comprehensive testing.
---
&gt; It’s a beta, you’re just playing a portion of the game. No reason to keep giving more and more content for a beta.
---
No, what you're describing is a demo.  A beta should eventually cover ALL of the content, because a beta is for testing purposes.
---
If something's intended as a demo, it should be released as a demo, with no expectation that people will look for bugs.
---
If it's a beta, then people should be testing everything and reporting bugs before the production release.
---
Je pense que c'est une excellente vidéo. Il est détaillé et répertorie les éléments que certaines spécialisations trouveront utiles.
---
Cependant, rappelez-vous qu'il faut parfois des années de vidéo constante pour devenir célèbre sur youtube.
---
There is actually a guy in the priv server community who tanked MC with ench shaman. He is crazy about tankk shaman and religiously belives that the only thing preventing shamans from tanking post mc is the lack of gear.
---
Transmog and account wide mounts go against the core philosophy of classic so it won't be in the game.
---
What about Skinning and herb while leveling (vs mining)
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
You are weird.
---
How will Classic continue? Do they plan to release TBC, Wrath or something new? I wonder how much time we have before releasing new content, increasing level cap and so on
---
I want to go slow this time: questing, professions, exploring this new old world.
---
I’d say Humans win. Warrior, mage, rogue, priest and Paladin.
---
I mean i will be using addons that track enemy cast bars and cooldowns and cc, you could argue that isnt in the nature of vanilla or an rpg. Ppl will use it still so let them use name plates
---
What than?
---
Not tuff easy no brainer
---
I think that most streamers have said they're planning on all rolling on one server. However we don't know server names and we don't know if they'll even announce which one. However the best bet would be they'll roll on PvE servers.
---
That's the option that wasn't named but can be.
---
60 is just the half way point.  The grind will be over when I've geared enough to just raid twice a week.
---
yes, vanilla pvp is just roll your face across the keyboard. No skillcap required. /s
---
While I think understand where you’re coming from - most success in vanilla honestly comes from gear/class, spamming hotkeys isn’t skilful or responsive in the same way Street Fighter is - vanilla PvP actually does have a high skill cap. 
---
Limitations breed creativity and mindgames. Knowing *when* exactly to use an ability, smart movement, saving resources, bringing and applying the correct professions and consumables, baiting your opponent into blowing a cool down or saving yours for the key moment - all of these require a good deal of skill and knowledge. 
---
Sure, you can get high kills in a BG just spamming charge, hamstring, and heroic strike. The melee combat is not complex and twitchy. But decision making and positioning will make all the difference between 5 kills 5 deaths and 40 kills 1 death.
---
Many classes have most of their kit at 30 too.
---
Counter point: Why use consumables if you can kill all the bosses without them? Why not strive to be the best you can be? I don't want to do "high dps", I want to do the highest dps possible for the spec; it's min maxing. Besides, shadow priests aren't brought along for their own damage; they're brought to buff every warlocks damage by 15%.
---
If you have the original collectors edition on your account you’ll have access to those pets but that’s the only thing.
---
I Think the spellbatching window is correct but we all have better internet connections and PCs which makes it seem bigger than back in 05. That being said I think the window should be smaller because its gonna get abused
---
Humans.
---
I know Tips and Asmon were in charge I just didn’t understand why they aren’t just doing a big cross faction duel unless that’s for later
---
What a chode lol
---
How about getting tank gear in the first place and going prot? Palas while lacking taunt have nice Tps and should have no problem holding aggro in lower dungs.
---
This might have been interesting if you offered any alternatives and discussed them. Instead this was a text just showing the problem we've known about for 10 years. It's an interesting problem, sure but this barely scratched the surface of anything
---
The fuck is Righteous Might doing listed from an RP server? You fuckers were from stormreaver pvp, don't bitch out when classic comes out.
---
Tauren Deadzone is very bad for Hunters, it does not feel good.
---
So why are you complaining when you wont even buy vanilla.
---
Exactly -- if we go trough the old expansions then we're just going to be right back we're we started.
---
You'd be much better off just finding someone to level with, dual boxing is going to be very stressful.
---
I claim you owe me a million dollars. Take my word for it or provide documents that prove my claim wrong. I'll wait.
---
(An exaggerated example to help you understand your flawed view of the scientific process)
---
That's bs palas are fine to tank in all &lt;50 instances.
---
It ensures that a zone never runs out of spawns for a moment, so if there was a raid group of players camping every spawn spot of some quest zone, enemies would probably be spawning in seconds.
---
I've never seen any raid do such a thing so it's not weird that many people didn't notice it.
---
But saying
---
&gt;nobody in all these years ever noticed it
---
Is just false, most people knew about this. It was pretty obvious really, how you were questing in some zone alone and mobs would respawn every 10 minutes or something, but then someone else came there and now they'd be spawning every 2-4 minutes or something.
---
I think it's fine. As you said yourself, it has existed in all versions of vanilla, both on retail and on pservers.
---
Wow has always been cheap.  People who talk about not having enough money to afford a monthly subscription need to stop playing video games quickly and sort their life out.
---
I’ll have to look in more detail on a PvP spec, there  are a lot of variations. But in general I’d say if you are going that far into subtlety you should get pre med but it depends on your play style. 
---
A hemo build is going to focus more on stunlocking for instance. If you are focusing on wpvp id prob say a CB/Prep build could likely be quite useful.
---
Because this is the reason? GMs ruin good game. They are fucking morons. They have probably somekind autist test so you are able to work there.
---
I always love going into details, and yeah, Warriors should be better, but I always loved the aspect of making something that is considered "unorthodox" work, even if it's not the most optimal. I always found Ferals to be the best off tanks in the raiding scene, being able to be a decent dps and tank at the same time, that 3% crit is very good, and the itemization is quite unique. That is not to say that Protection warriors are bad offtanks, because they can always wield that Nightfall/Annihilator when their tanking is not needed, but Druids bring more for the raids buff wise. Mark of the Wild and Leader of the Pack is a very nice boost.
---
BC guild banks are a blessing, giving one guy the responsibility for looting your entire bank is a serious trust issue
---
As someone who is going to lead a guild / has a lot of experience raiding on a private server....
---
1) flasks won't be mandatory for anyone besides the tanks, which the guild will usually fund
---
2) Flasks will be required for everyone on important raids: speed runs, server first clears, etc.

---
how is it garbage? Pretty sure they're pretty standard although banning agm and such is pretty dumb
---
I would definitely agree that the actual purpose of a beta is to test for bugs, however I'd guess that the majority of streamers and normal people that received beta keys won't be tirelessly bug searching but rather messing around in the Azeroth that left them so long ago. Pure beta testers on the other hand obviously have a job to do, and that is to make sure that the game is released as polished as possible.
---
That'd be cool, but I think it presents too many opportunities for interference. Tons of people will just troll with outside interference because they think it's funny. It'll probably happen today where someone catches a heal or buff from outside player and they have to reset. Can't rely on people to not ruin things
---
i still think orc is a bit better for pvp and pve but the nice thing about wotf is its a 2 min CD with a 5 second immunity after, whereas the fear trinket is 5 min CD and no immunity after... so as an undead you can be a fear breaking machine. BUT as an orc overall you will have more melee dps and the stun resist is a bit OP.
---
You'll have a couple of years to progress through classic before anything happens.
---
And it's up in the air.  Odds are they will go the OSRS route and make custom content .
---
As someone who desperately *wants* to play feral tank but knows my place is in TBC (here's hoping), thank you for reaffirming my suspicions after these parry gap confirmations.
---
To anyone else out there, do what you want, but don't underestimate the power of community perception and the toxicity that comes with it. Also acknowledge posts like above that also show actual reasoning why those perceptions aren't totally just perception.
---
There have been numerous clips of how large tauren's hit box is, which is especially funny in a tauren vs tauren situations.  
---
Blizzard have confirmed that it is not a bug, tauren hitbox was in fact bigger in vanilla and it works as it should in beta.   
---
So yes, and I'm not sure if it's that bad or not but you will need to stay further away from your target to be able to shoot it as a tauren but you can hit things with melee from farther away. The actual size of the dead zone is the same it's just farther away from you.  
---
I would worry more about how pets are currently on the beta to be honest, it is very concerning.  
---
If that isn't fixed hunters and warlocks will be at a significant disadvantage.
---
This isn't a half bad idea tbh. You still have to matchmake and actually run to the instance. I don't really see a problem with this.
---
&gt;you’re worse than average tier players!!!!!!

&gt;you’re try hard!!!!!!!!!!!

---
Im thinking of getting a discord together soon and start interacting with people.
---
In terms of delegating you would have Guild leader, Raid Leader, and the class officers.
---
The class officers would be kind of like managers, ensuring each class is prepared for the raid, makeing sure there arent conflicting specs. The raid leader can merely lead the raids, or organize them as well. You can also have pvp officers as well.
---
What i am having trouble with is can teh guild leader be the raid leader as well? I am not sure if a guild leader would have much to worry about in this structure, therefore they could also be the raid leader
---
This is not a thing that was ever talked about, and not something I ever noticed in 14 years playing the game. Acting like it was a given is silly. This was a thing that was always confined to pirate servers to band-aid their overpopulation issues. Tagging mobs in highly populated zones on bigger servers in vanilla was super painful, and the dynamic respawns were not obvious.
---
&gt; Amusingly, if layering and megaservers were actually a permanent plan ....
---
I don't think so. The worse the imbalance overall the fewer layers you could balance out. You might be able to make _one_ good balanced layer and then a bunch of layers with all the same faction.
---
Classic hasn't even come out yet and you want to know what comes after? A lot of people seem very eager to know what comes next, which is funny considering how everyone's praising classic as the best thing ever.
---
The slower pace is still very evident at low levels.
---
Triple. Triad.
---
Any idea where they said that? I've been looking for info on this.
---
We have this discussion a lot and I’ve seen the best arguments for troll. They have everything you need, honestly.
---
you're supposed to ignore the whole part of them being rank 1 / top pvpers over the expansions and REEEE because streamers
---
It might just be less hassle (and cheaper) to find some friends that can heal you from guild or through chat. Everyone knows about the warrior slog I think you’ll get a group together pretty easy,
---
This is great, thanks! Just curious, is this syntax the same as how it was in vanilla?
---
No one seems to acknowledge this.  The pserver stooges illustrated this when they wiped a hundred times in a 5 man on the beta, and there is a video of a hunter using beast lore to compare creep statistics between pserver and beta(which resulted in the majority of the test sample having discrepancies)
---
People also seem to be jumping to conclusions about how the overall sensibility will be on classic, using retail and pserver mentalities as gospel.
---
Admittedly, it probably won’t be like it was in vanilla, but it almost certainly won’t be like retail or pservers.
---
Why did you turn in plainstrider parts before humble task? You can kill them on the way, and remove one trip.

Go ud so you can assert dominance by eating their corpses.

From your list I would only accept two points but with conditions:
---
\- Flying: only in zones done with flying in mind: for example as Outland or Northrend in their day.
---
\- New model: the ones in bfa, sorry but no,  if thay make new models more faithful to the originals, animations specially, then yes.
---
Apart from that, I would accept also the barber shop and maybe a lower limit to the respec cost
---
yes, afaik its a site for finding friends which youve played with back in the day.
---
Do you not have phones?

Lmfao get the hell out of here, you weren't sarcastic.

Yeah no shit. Why would he schedule it when no one would watch.

No servers have been announced yet.

Playing an MMO in hindsight makes it much easier, sadly.

Ye but srsly what can you offer as ret? Seriously ret pala is literally dead weight apart form having a BoP to save things if shit crashes but you shouldnt even be in that position to begin with. It's like the meme group projects from USA movies where there is allways 1 unlikeable guy who does nothing and gets credit for everything.

And yet somehow I managed not to make a new thread about it...

wow classic is a starved girl girl with Anorexia

retail would be that fat one

perfect mix would be the blondie

BLIZZARD DELETE COLORBIND MODUS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
whatever post it was, it was false.
---
Wow, you're really something aren't you?
---
Can’t beta and demo be the same thing basically? Either way, they could also do a section of the beta of instant 60s to test out end game content. Rather that than to keep increasing the cap.
---
Do healers also downrank their healing spells in PvP? Or is that more of a PvE thing? Specifically asking for (disc) priests. Cheers!
---
You don't need to share loot in ally either as no sensible warrior will tank for a group with a paladinn (unless its a holy pala who takes the clothies stuff aheuheauheau)
---
Yes, well the EU rules changed.... duuurrr  Just like the rest of the game changed ... duuurrr ! 
---
And it isn't Classic if we have 2019 rules set and 2019 cry baby appeasing GMs - the games feel will be as much of a direct result of how the game is policed because the referees fundamentally alter the nature of the game.
---
Also individual GMs had it within their power to do a wide range of things and often did.
---
The issue is that the printed rules for the EU allowed for a wider range of gameplay than the USA ones and it was only after at least a couple of years that those rules changed when they realised it was more profitable to let Little Billy Cry Baby cry to the GMs etc rather than require him top adapt his gameplay to compensate for the fact this was a Role Playing game and it was in the rules that he could be lied to and scammed in game and it was all part of the experience.
---
When you have rare recipes 
---
 that require months and months of gameplay to acquire, it makes a mockery of the concept of the game world that someone can have the benefit of that enchant by asking someone in general chart to do it for them.
---
Far better that the world is more risky and dangerous and requires people to cooperate, where you are the custodian of your in game characters reputation and players are incentivised to know who is who on their server.
---
Ditto. It was always packed with people farming, so it really couldn't have been that efficient, but it was fun making the final push all these other characters around doing the same.
---
Beta invites really bring out the absolute worst of the Blizzard community

Thats why I wrote "one of". Take any narcist and you will have the exact same reaction.

Crippled ego with incredibly short fuse getting offended by the most miniscule disagreement.
---
I had a feeling you'd say that, no they weren't bad priests. We were rank 1 for the entire existence of the Chromaggus server on Horde side &lt;Nerve&gt;
---
You can also prehot the entire raid before things like that happened and ticking rejuvs in BIS gear as well as lifeblooms on the tank made it pretty easy to slay some of the COH priests.
---
Yeah literally noone is thinking that...you've been watching way too much 2019
---
They actually do, maybe get off your ass and look for one. Get some qualifications and stop quitting your jobs because part time jobs are too much work for you.
---
GMs don't ruin the game, gold sellers who bot do. I'm sure GMs bans gold sellers when they find them. It's up to the players to report them and not to buy from them. The reason gold sellers exist is because players buy from them and and not because GMs are "fucking morons".
---
Maybe you should close the blinds so your neighbors stop calling you that.
---
The south park episode missed the mark on many things.

Hang on Nelson, I’m going to explore the Tower of Azora with a bunch of night elves.

Do you understand they dont give fuck about them?

If you see botter add them in your friendlist. They only ban in waves after 2 years. They are retards all of them.

Druids tanked in raids in vanilla.  I played it 14 years ago, and we had some druids that were tanks.  Gonna have to get over it.  It happened then, and it'll happen again.  World firsts, idk, who cares?  Can a druid be a tank and be useful in a raid?  In a word, yes.  I know because I witnessed it, and not on a private server.  It might not be the best tank, but it's better dps when you don't need as many tanks.  It's a druid.  They tank, they dps, and they heal.  They aren't the best at any of those roles.  They do whatever is needed.  They certainly decurse better than your 4th offtank when you only need 2 tanks for a fight.  The dps better as well.

You need to take a xanax or smoke a joint or something.  It's a video game.

Well in Vanilla ally was more populated than horde. Mainly Becuase ally is better at pve. Also you mentioned asmon and swifty, don't underestimate how many people are 'ally for life' because of them.

These addons only display info about player, that you should already know anyway. Nameplates can be considered as Xray cheating. Its not up to me to let them use it but up to blizzard so dont tell me. But if you dont see the problem im trying to say here, there is no point in discussing it any further
---
That’s fine. As long as you remember that I’m free to decline you for purposely playing bad.
---
Why begging for beta access when you can play on private
---
Lol.
---
I say herbalism - alchemy since mage already has such a huge toolkit that engineering isn't needed that much. Those consumables really come in handy \^\^
---
Blizzard has previously stated that they were considering taking action to block add-ons that emulate modern game functions in Classic WoW.
---
However, we haven't had any follow-ups to this statement, so we have no idea where the line might be drawn (Is it all modern features, or only a few major ones? What about features from past expansions, that have since been removed from the game? about add-ons that existed or were possible in Vanilla, but have since been integrated into the game? What about modern add-ons that affect gameplay, but aren't actually integrated into the game?)
---
We also have no idea what actions might be taken if something is judged to be over the line (punitive actions or tweaks to the add-on API are my guess, since).
---
And finally, this was just a one-off statement at a panel. They might just decide they don't really care about it, players can go do whatever they want. Maybe Blizzard will do something about LFG mods, maybe they won't. We just have to wait and see.
---
If the cap would be 60 a bunch of people would have hit cap within a week ;)
---
9 days but you lose the roll.
---
It'll be the modern game - the Lua API is 8.1 with mixes of 8.1.5 mixed in. Not 1.12. Modern client , modern Lua API. I'm going to hazard a guess they'll be using a modern Macro API as well.

How tf can you watch Payo without wanting to beat the living shit out of him?

Found my old friend i used to play WoW with on facebook, he barely remembered anything that i had remembered for 15 years. Anticlimactic to say the least.

You should download Unreal Engine 4 and go through the learning material. The engine will teach you when you open it for the first time.

Delegate, delegate, delegate.

One person deals with guild bullshit as the guild leader.  A different person runs raids as the raid leader.  Class leads make sure their groups buff properly, know their roles for fights.  But most of this is unnecessary because the first few raids will be push overs.  All guilds will use MC/Ony to refine and prune their members.
---
Yup.

https://www.wowhead.com/npc=7524/anguished-highborne
---
Leveled 58-60 off them.
---
&gt; This would make it easy for WoW to be Competitive Esport 
---
No, they had that in legion and overall the last 2 expansions are relatively balanced, there just isnt enough interest.  
---
&gt; completely erase Ilvl from the PvP system 
---
gear / char progression is (imo) the biggest part of classic WoW as an RPG. Also it adds inconsistency if ure scaled/better/worse in pvp combat than outside of pvp combat.  
---
&gt;... for WoW to be Competitive Esport ... \[..\] .... There can be an Added Betting System 
---
wow classic is way too imbalanced for competitive mindsets. But it doesnt matter in classic because raids are very very easy and there is no RBG/arena/m+ etc. Otherwise people would get fed up REALLY fast with warriors doubling their dps.
---
You talk about itemlevel and pvp talents and want transmog to be in the game? I respect your opinion, but these things are hated by the majority of classic enthusiasts.
---
I didnt progress far (mostly heroics and T4) but I LOVED tanking as a feral druid in TBC
---
to intense for me
---
AoE Looting?
---
Interesting, TIL
---
You can level as a deep ret without much trouble. If you want to heal, I advise that you save up healing gear, and downrank your healing abilities, and use Blessing of Light. However, if you do want to level as Holy, I suggest you find a partner to duolevel with. When I leveled as holy, this is the spec I went with: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BD9Q9NABPAOfADA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BD9Q9NABPAOfADA) hopefully it'll help. :)

Maybe a mage if you want to sell portals.

---
Hi, /u/Zyoy
---
I am going to say what I have been saying since Legion : Retail WoW cannot be changed, to reflect the values of the past.
---
What is missing from Retail and it was present in Classic is too much to reverse. It is basically impossible to do it, without killing Retail in a single, massive blow, instead of letting it die slow, as it is since WoD.
---
At the bare minimum, to bring back ONLY the social aspect and predictable rewards, Retail must remove LFD, LFR, Warforging, Titanforging, AP farming, (be it Azerite or Artifact or whatever will be in 9.0), bring back PvP servers (not optional WarMode), remove sharding and CRZ.
---
I am not even bringing up the leveling, or questing, or 40 men raids, or flying mounts, or city portals, or professions, or class pruning and class redesign every patch, or 4 ranks of content difficulty...I am JUST bringing into discussion the social aspect and predictable rewards.
---
Can you IMAGINE how many Retail players will instantly quit if LFD, LFR, Warforging and Titanforgins are REMOVED ?
---
This is why Classic will be one game, and Retail another game. Even if they are both called WoW. In time (not a very long time), the player base of these 2 games, Classic and Retail, will prove, in numbers, which one is the REAL WoW.
---
I am not going to say which one will be more popular, because I am clearly subjective, but there is NO WAY that both games will survive in the next 5 years. One of them will be dead (or what is understood by dead - very low player base), the other will be massive and flourish.
---
We, here on r/wowclassic know which one will be.
---
The others, on r/wow think that we are wrong.
---
Thankfully, not even 1 year from now, we will see which sub have more insight and vision.
---
but guild banks lol
---
This used to be bathroom reading for me. No reason it can’t be again.
---
Horde tends to be bigger on the pvp realms as thats usually a reason you seek out those extra racials for pvp advantages
---
I heavily judge people with demon tails, horns, and five different ranks or titles in their TRP. Do I call them out on it? No. But I don't give them the light of day.

Yes, it is very viable to be a Feral Druid player and be succesful in Vanilla WoW. I see alot of people spouting ideas and thoughts but I can't be sure if they are in any way based on facts. What I can tell you is that I was the MT and OT in a guild doing MC, BWL and Ony. Upon the opening of the gates I was MT and OT for both AQ20 and 40.
---
I have however never played a warrior so I cannot comment on the differences between the classes, the only thing I can comment on is what my guildmates told me when they had to heal either me or of our Warrior Tanks. They all said  the same: It's different but hard to explain. When asked by our raidleader after I tanked my first entire raid if they felt it was more difficult they said it wasn't, it was different but couldn't really pinpoint what it was. My server at the time had 1 other guild using a Feral druid as MT and OT and when I asked him about it he checked with the healers in his guild and they confirmed it was the same for them.
---
When we started we were all geared in blues with some purples here and there since none of us had every done a raid, we weren't over or undergeared.
---
Ignore the hate, do you thing and enjoy the game!
---
And then the 2020 picture looks exactly like the 2012 one.
---
Sure if you could throw a link I will check it out, although I personally use Maya.
---
&gt; No idea from which badly configured private server this rumor came, but no, it wasn't.
---
Eat shit, idiot
---
Fatal Flaw: lack of decurse.
---
Priests have the most abilities of any healer by a mile so, you'll probably downrank something like greater heal but, you'll definitely want to just use max rank of flash heal. Ultimately downranking comes down to your personal preferences and what you are comfortable with. There are definitely reasons to have like...rank 1 SWP / holy nova and niche things like that on your bar though.
---
I have never seen one.
---
Exactly me, had 16 im vanilla, had top geared warlock in my server. But now.. meh have family and shit. Cant be top tier player anymore.
---
You might be able to get away with doing Mag with no tranq shot but unlikely to do even the easy dragons without it.  If you somehow managed those then Chromaggus/Huhu are pretty much 100% going to do it.
---
I think we need to see what boss damage is like on classic before making assumptions. So far, elites have been hitting for much less than what they do on private servers. Top private server guilds have already been using dw fury "tanks" because it's such a non-issue keeping tanks alive and it allows more tps. A bear tank taking more damage isn't really an issue if they can still out-threat a warrior.
---
It's a bit more complicated than that and depends on each country, but at the heart of it, you are right. it goes even further because you arent considering changes on wages which is key in this kind of analysis.
---
I agree with both of the other comments: Mage at 40 can sell portals for a pretty nice profit and Hunters are going to be super fast. I'd like to also add that you can do a Warlock to double as a summoning alt, but I personally would level something you think you MIGHT play to 35 just in case you ever decide to just level it to max in your free time.
---
Thank you for the response back. Is that all you're learning from? You think college courses uneeded?
---
I love the Barrens. There's a certain rugged beauty to it and it always feel like an adventure because of how wide and open it is.
---
I'd say the ugliest would be the Wetlands. I don't dislike the zone, but it's pretty foul to look at.
---
Here you go friend. Thank me later.

Exactly, resist gear will be farmed from day one, potions, flasks and every reagent needed to potentially give even the slightest advantage will be stockpiles ready for patch drops days.
---
We can't unlearn what we know.
---
Ehh technically right but it’s not functionally larger. The extra radius will never matter and can’t ever matter, but it’s an interesting point
---
It’s literally just a topic people enjoy talking about just ignore it and don’t try and tell other people what to talk about it’s weird
---
You don't really need AP to do m+ or raids at all.
---
BFA has plenty of faults, pick one that is accurate to complain about instead.
---
Breaking subreddit rules results in a ban
---
I made one of those lvl 20 capped accounts for retail while waiting for blizz to hopefully help me recover my account.
---
Made a belf pally, instantly saw a bunch of low levels running around with former high tier looking gear and those dumbass motorcycles.
---
I was able to pull multiple mobs immediately with no issue, and you get kill/collect credit for hitting other players mobs 1 time.
---
I hate it, I get that 1-120 would be insane without making leveling easier, but at this point you're just mindlessly clicking through the game. Like "oops I pulled 3 mobs, might actually have to heal which is fine because pallys don't use mana for anything else apparently."
---
I talk LIKE this BECAUSE it MAKES my POINTS better
---
Well it was expensive as a kid who had no income.  Now ... lol.
---
Man the amount of time I spent as a kid reading this manual while I was taking shits. Seeing clips or screenshots of vanilla are cool but nothing is like the nostalgia rush of seeing my own game box and leafing through my manual years later.
---
I did it in Vanilla. It’s rough..
---
I have zero qualms about them adding this back in. There is literally no reason not to have it as it has no effect on leveling or competition.
---
The only problem I have with the sub price, is there is no “retail only” or “Classic only”
---
Even if one costed 90% and both costed 100% of the price, I think there should be an option for it
---
I’m hoping to off tank as feral. Even if I don’t I’m rolling Druid cause I want to tank 5 mans when I play solo or while leveling and am 100% ok wearing a dress and healing.
---
it will feel different regardless as it was 15 uears ago and your memory of lightning is not 100% correct.
---
I mean I think its silly to pretend Vanilla was a perfect game. It has a ton of flaws that were fixed in later expacs. The batching window is probably the best example of something that is objectively inferior but is being kept for the sake of "no changes".
---
EXACTLY
---
PvE servers will be dominated by Alliance
---
PvP servers will be dominated by Horde
---
This will never change, different mindsets for different people.
---
If you are going full try hard mode, why not solo? Its more effective
---

---
I’m taking the same days have the same plans, around 10-12/day maybe a bit more. Do you have server/guild commitments or no? We have a group of about 20 planning to remake an old guild
---
Make your own events
---
I love the zones in the region of southern lordaeron: Alterac Mountains, Hillsbrad, and Arathi Highlands :)
---
Redditing has been called the cancer for years. Take that as you will. If you dont want that dont play on a server with a streamer.
---
The vast majority of all guides and experiences are accurate enough so as to be functionally the same thing.
---
Azure myst music is legit
---

---

---
No guild commitment yet but i want to be on a pvp server for sure.
---
I JUST WANT THEM TO ADD BOSWAMBI
---
Wait before you downvote just hear me out...
---
... would it be so bad if Blizzard added a raid finder? It's *JUST* a tool to help players group up, and I for one am not looking forward to spending hours in trade chat scrolling through thunderfury memes.
---
Sure, the raid finder might match groups that are subpar because of low performers, but they could just tune down the difficulty of the raids to compensate. I realize that's not #nochanges but let's be realistic, nobody is going to be wanting to wipe over and over in MC in 2019. Sorry bois, just not going to happen.
---
Won't you all please consider my totally authentic, modest proposal that is definitely NOT a troll?
---
Rokzug and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Rokzug kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.
---
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
---
That was, until the day Rokzug's mom heard a voice from above: "Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!"
---
It all depends on whether the clearcasting is once per mob or once per cast for your rank 1 arcane explosion
---
It is too high.  $15 a month for a remake of a game is highway robbery.    It's only really worth it if you enjoy retail too.  Then it's not too bad.  But make no mistake, if this were a standalone sub, then it would be a lot cheaper.  Like maybe $5 a month.   But that's also why Blizz isn't doing a standalone sub.
---
To argue that it was $15 a month in the past, so now it's a deal is totally intellectually dishonest argument.
---
Yeah its counterproductive to keep talking about changes when classic release is right around the corner.  This is the reason wow failed, because all these qol changes that you want... are shit for the game.  Lower respec, class buffs, etc.  Classic is about community and how the game forces us to interact, not about catering to what makes you feel better.
---
Yeah but Wrath started "You heroes of Azeroth" etc. It had boring questlines except Dragonblight. Introduced the currency from dungeons to buy a gear [as far as I remember?]
---
That would give Blizzard a good reason for not listening to us anymore.
---
Man I remember reading through this like it was yesterday! If you look closely on the page that shows character height, you can see the old lanky female troll model. Always loved that.
---
yeah, like I'm on the fence. Because it just makes life easier for spamming groups, and seeing which groups are spamming to fill. Seems more like a minor QoL thing
---
Yeah T1 bracers and belt are BoE, and drop off trash mobs in MC.
---
I can confirm that the simple macros I did get to work in game seemed closer to modern syntax than vanilla syntax
---
Tastosis is still at it, and dare I say they've gotten funnier and more hype over the years.
---
I'll go make myself a cup of tea :)
---
I think hes talking about the list and not just Paul and vin
---
Totally agree, we cant use the pserver meta, which has higher fury tanks and pummelers on druids, i dont think pummelers will be nearly as prevelant.
---
So if you look for "moonglade" in the list there are two at the moment, one is druid only called ["Nighthaven, Moonglade"](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Nighthaven#Flight) and then there is the non-druid flightpath called "Moonglade". 
---
The druid-only moonglade flightpath only goes to "Rut'heran" (alliance), the other non-druid path can go to more places like Felwood directly. I will figure out a better way to represent these druid-only paths as it's quite confusing at the moment!
---
if you are planing on raiding dont go enhance 
---
but there are so hybrid builds that lower level guilds may accept
---
This is essentially what I’m doing on my mage. I’ll be leveling with Tailor and Skin however since skin doesn’t require you to run everywhere (plan on being 60 in two weeks or less). At 60, drop skinning for Herb and selling them for gold to level engineering then eventually being Tailor/Engine
---
But a lot of the streamers didn't get beta access...
---
I'm totally down to join a strictly dwarf guild which raids, great for immersion
---
Here's the thing though, I did this as a Feral Druid in Vanilla while progressing through the raids. I was the MT and there was no issue with me doing it. No problems in keeping aggro, no problems with threat generation, no problems with healing. I see people spouting of the same old nonsense and it's absolute and utter bullshit. What you shouldn't be doing is forcing the issue, if you are recruited to heal then do that to help your guild progress. But if you are properly equipped and know how to play then there is no reason why a feral druid can't be your MT.
---
Could be, sorry if I was wrong, was sounding different
---
Same with us, horde PvP, I’m rolling Druid and have a good buddy rolling undead priest, our plan is to level separately til about 12 then meet up in the barrens on Thursday morning and roll from there. Add me on bnet! Ralahax#1815
---
I saw a druid tank get killed by Ossirian The Unscarred in 2 hits last week, it was pretty embarrassing for him to go “yeah guys, sorry, druid shit, sometimes you get crit/crushed to open with”
---
Probably wasn’t armour capped, but these things do happen
---
&gt; I always love going into details, and yeah, Warriors should be better, but I always loved the aspect of making something that is considered "unorthodox" work, even if it's not the most optimal. 
---
That is admirable, and trust me, I always did it, with classes there were considered "bad", in every expansion.Yes, you can make the unorthodox spec work, and the feeling of accomplishment is amazing.
---
All I am saying is that people need to reconsider their views about private servers...not about what they want to play.
---
To make sure that they choose wisely, because TIME investment in Classic WoW is very important. There is no problem in making any spec work...there is a problem if you want to do it by going against the current, be it pure game design, community perception, or both, and expect everyone to simply accept a subpar spec beyond the social aspect.
---
Progression raiding in Classic is the most relevant part of raiding, the most fun and the most enjoyable. Every single spec and class have a spot in farming raids, make no mistake. Druids WILL tank MC and BWL and ZG or AQ20...but not before those raids are on easy farm status. Shadow priests, Ret Palas, Enha Shammies, Boomkins, etc. WILL raid MC and BWL and ZG and AQ20...but again, not before those raids are on farming status.
---
My entire post does not discourage players to roll a Druid for tanking...it just present a reality, that they will have to wait a good while before they will tank raid bosses, and during that wait, not to be pissed off because they have to heal. Or innervate.
---
Their time WILL come...it's just not going to be during raid progression.
---
Virgin Undead vs. Chad Orc.jpg
---
As a priest, yes, but really just with flash heal (you shouldn’t really be using the longer cast times that greater heal or heal offer, because you’re gonna get interrupted real quick). There are exceptions to everything.
---
also, pvp (and all other healing) specs for priests are typically split between holy/disc—you don’t get either 31 point talent.  
---
Just a heads up there aren’t really “disc” priests in vanilla.  Healers will be in both holy and disc, usually with a few point weight toward holy (because of spiritual guidance).   Disc didn’t become a thing until BC when people went disc for Pain suppression to survive.
---
its so rude
---
Wonder where I have heard that before? Oh yeah, the No Vanilla crowd when Vanilla servers were asked for.
---
And he's already made a video addressing it.....
---
There's more subtile differences than just what they announced about the parry changes. Skarm goes over many differences to prepare people for Classic.
---
I legitimately believe that Cataclysm had the potential to be the best expansion in WoW's history, because it was the only time since Vanilla when the Developers were not focused exclusively on end-game content. Unfortunately, they screwed up pretty badly in my eyes, taking some bad trends that started in mid WotLK and exacernating them tl the extreme.
---
Max level players once again had a reason to hang out in the original cities, leading to interaction between high and low level players. Huge amounts of new content AT LOWER LEVELS gave them a reason to start again from the bottom, instead of just pushing the end-game. For a brief moment, they even made the little end-game content there was challenging, so people wouldn't blow through it all in a month.
---
Yeah, losing the old world sucked, but it brought people back together instead of just dumping all the end-game players on their own private continent away from the rest of the world. It's just a shame that despite that, they killed off all the reasons for those players to actually interact.
---
I'm taking from that answer that the warrior is the most usable as DPS because it can off-tank as well as DPS and perhaps even DPS better (higher DPS numbers)?
---
But you recommend Rogue to ppl who just want to DPS and not think about being asked other stuff?
---
Is that it? :)
---
Mara isn't 80g/hr. It averages out to 30-40. The /camp isn't a big deal. Just strip naked and die to get out the instance. There's a 5 reset an hour cap, which limits your ability to farm. There's so many ways to farm in the game that instance farming leaves more contested world spots to other classes. Hell I was making damn near 70 to 100g an hour farming ele earth and solid stone if I had an uncontested spot. Sappers can be profitable.
---
Yeah I mean. I’m curious about the OP’s major..got through a comp sci degree hardly studying and going to class lol I just made sure I did all my work.
---
I never hardcore studied like this then again that major was more about projects/actual work rather than regurgitating info
---
Funnily enough small hits on tanks often end up costing more mana as healers are using their fast and expensive heals to snipe the damage. With higher damage they can use slower and more efficient heals as they take turns precasting.
---
He is in for a disappointment.
---
That's your opinion. GMs and Blizzard obviously cares about gold sellers. 
---
The reason for why they ban bots in waves is so bot authors are not able to determine what detection techniques blizzard uses. They want to scoop up all who are using a hack instead of prompting botters to change hacks regularly to avoid detection. 
---
It's also easy to ban a botter but it's not easy to make them stay away forever. They can just go on another account and continue, use a VPN to mask their ip, etc. 
---
It's also takes lots of time to ban players over time compared to banning players periodically. 
---
Blizzard could hire 100 of GMs that patrol every route in game banning every botter they see but that would be extremely expensive. Would you be willing to pay for that?
---
Remember Phase 2 doesn't add that much in terms of raid content.  Azurgos, Kazzak, and Dire Maul.
---
Expect? Yes. do i want it? No.  would i play it? Yes
---
I'm thinking, as mages, what makes more money? Gathering professions? Or maybe keep skinning and aoe farm?
---
There will be no dual spec. There is no rational reason to think otherwise since it'd be too large of a deviation from original classic. Sorry if you had your hopes up.
---
&gt;  Guaranteed your method is hurting their feelings.
---
Guaranteed anyone older than ~18 sees straight through your lies and talks about you as a bullshitter behind your back.
---
❤🤗
---
this is interesting build but it is for swords right?
---
Rest assured that a large percentage of the "bugs" being reported by *anyone* are not bugs at all. Don't let a few streamers make you think this game is not being tested properly though. 
---
Those mistakes will be checked and ignored by Blizzard, they have the old client to compare to as we've seen so far.
---
 Diseased? You mean deceased " You numpty " Probably not best to call people names if you don't understand the difference between someone that is Dead and Sick.
---
Great job. You didn't bother to read anything and jumped with sharpened pitchforks. It's a chat filter. I'm guessing it searches for phrases like "LFG", "LF", "LFM" and shows only that in separate chat window. It's not a big deal you drama queen.
---
Wasn’t that when like 10 million people started playing? Lol yeah we all did trash runs of MC back in the day. Good times. 
---
Then at 70 it was Soloing Ony on the reset timer.
---
So if he didnt completely spec into Resto the only best option would be a hyrbid elemental/resto spec instead of a hybrid enh/resto spec?
---
It's hard not to notice zones like Quel'thalas, Zul'Aman, Gilneas, Kul Tiras, Tol Barad or Crestfall being in the world map. I wonder how much does the 1.12 vanilla differ from the original developers idea before the game was actually released and from the time they made this manual.
---
All they’re doing is including it in the sub with the retail game. So now if you really wanted to play retail, you can(I won’t be). You’re essentially paying for two different versions of WoW. 
---
More bang for your buck haha. 😂🤓
---
That's fine, then maybe you TBC players will be lucky then.
---
woosh
---
Hybrid enhance resto can work
---
Maybe you do understand the difference between a PERSONAL experience and the fact that Druid tanks in Vanilla, as in Classic, were extremely rare...or maybe you don't.
---
Also, my post is about raid progression...I said that multiple time in my OP.
---
Did you MT for your guild during raid progression...OR AFTER?
---
Because if it's after (and I bet good money that it is), it is totally irrelevant.
---
If you have zero interest in tanking, do not play a warrior. It’s like if you have healing spells, you’ll be asked to use them (sooner or later).  Also, rogues get better DPS with rare blues/early epics than DPS warriors, they’re massively weapon dependent.
---
Those toxic gamers are there for, what did I say, the short term.  They will always be around sure, but most end up on your ignore, never make it to 60, or stay spamming in the same general chat you arent in.  
---
Also when did I say I experienced none of that.  I was trying to build his confidence in the positive side of the classic community
---
Damn.. he likes playing shaman but always likes to be in melee range of mobs and doesnt like to just stand back and attack I noticed this and figure maybe we could work around his play style.. but maybe he just might have to practice standing back more and fighting.
---
I'd recommend getting like a selljunk addon, basically autosell any useless greys, and maybe a bartender, questhelper is personal choice, bag addon for convenience of everything being together
---
Found my old guildmaster from the first guild I ever joined on there, and a few people from the progression guild I was in. What a rush of nostalgia.
---
I agree with you for sure.  When I played on a pserver to 60 last year, just the leveling process alone was such a better experience than all of BFA combined.  Impossible to put into words besides vanilla is just simply a better game.
---
What's the actual rotation for combat swords for rogue? Seems like a 5p SnD won't last long enough for 5p Eviscerate and then back to another 5p SnD. Do you have to sometimes cast a lower level SnD to fill in the gaps?
---
Fuck man.. Orcs are so ugly... I cant stand them.. really dont want to roll one.. prolly gonna stick with UD anyway.
---
Insert Trump *Wrong* GIF here.
---
Druid's were tanking in Vanilla. They weren't taking over Warriors unless your guild allowed you to and that wouldn't be for progression fights. At most you would OT and Heal for progression.
---
However, even in Naxx there were Druid MTs in the off groups and farming runs.
---
I MT'd and Raid Lead in Vanilla up to Naxx. I know where a Druid can and can't go as a feral tank.
---
Another person attempting to speak for many
---
Then just play the game once it launches and try a few different classes before getting one to 60? I'm pretty sure you'll be fine if you don't hit 60 within the first week on the primo class you want to play.
---
Nah, let the no changes babies have their no changes, I'll just buy gold from 3rd parties, it's never gotten anybody banned
---
It really was. Yes TBC was the best ecpansion by far let me say but it was the start of the downfall. Daily quests alone make them game a lot more boring and its the dtart pf the game becoming just a checklist. I dont mind grinding at all in WoW. But i eanna get on and have a choice on what i wanna grind and not being forced to do daily quests every single day for like an hour or 2 till im exalted.
---
I learned everything from unreal engine forums and youtube.
---
But for getting work in the industry, getting a degree will help ofc, but it is not in any way mandatory. I do not work in gaming industry (yet) so I am not a professional to give advice. I just do this for a hobby for now.
---
But why *Classic* WoW?  Why can't you insert this pipedream of fantasy spades into Mainstream WoW #notmyclassic
---
Fixed 🙏🏻
---
TBC comes with a ton of massive baggage. 
---
The only thing in retrospect it has is class pve balance and attunement quests. Everything else about it I see a negative. World PvP &gt; arenas and resilience.
---
The reality is, there is no end game for enhance, people will tell you that "casual" guilds don't care about classes which is the dumbest shit ever, of course they care. While your friend applies to a guild as enchance, the guild will most likely have 10 other apps from the actually good/playable classes.
---
Do you know of a guide that explains these things? It gets a little complicated when not only are you talking about a niche spec but one that raids dont normally take.. its getting a little complicated and I would like him to have some sort of guide to go after with weapon progression as he levels up and end game as well.
---
The problem with that is it leads to Blizzard competing with itself, which it was never going to do
---
I just leveled a priest on a pserver so I can tell telle you what it was like.
---
I recommend leveling as a shadow priest, with 5/5 in wand specialization. You can still very easily heal dungeons while not having a single point in holy spec.
---
A lot of the difficulty from your early levels depend on if you have a lesser magic wand (lvl 5 req.) or a greater magic wand (lvl 13 req.). These will change your life. The wands do slightly less dps than your spells but you get to not spend mana, and even regen it, during wanding. This makes it so you have very long times between needing to refresh.
---
You can take on 2 mobs at a time pretty early easily and can even survive some 3 mob pulls. Once you're 30+ you can solo small camps by yourself (chain fear, dot on everything, running and wanding) and it becomes a blast.
---
Overall great leveling class, will always find a place in dungeons, can duo level with any class great, and good endgame prospects as well. I will definitely roll a priest at some point in classic.
---
&gt;t. fat
---
Or you know, maybe play another game and don't limit yourself, probably why you're stuck in this situation in the first place.
---
This is so noobish. I love it
---
It was a *tiny* bit more extreme than that. 
---
Paladins could one-shot Kazzak.
---
TBC and all the bs that came with it made me quit, too.
---
I would really like a source on where they said that any automated system is completely automated. I have a feeling that blizzard keeps saying that in all of their games but then its pretty pbvious that its 100% automated
---
Ah yes, Boswambi, the special needs cousin of Bwonsamdi.
---
No can't say I know of any guides as its not really a normal spec
---
People are making a mountain over a molehill, don't you think Blizzard is *perfectly capable* to see who plays what? A classic only option is not needed to show you don't want to support retail, not playing it is more than enough.
---
My view on that is not every single guild Will be able to field a fully optimal lineup. There Will be ultra-hardcore guilds, recruiting 25 warriors for their basic lineup, there Will be semi-hardcore progression guilds where even retributions are brought (and FYI they are a decent DPS in 1.12, but it requires dedication to make it good, I actually made a guide for rets that you can check out here if you want :p [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ggppqGGm\_5g5AFdtU2g6WrIR16f6DFCUnMPoY28-YAc/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ggppqGGm_5g5AFdtU2g6WrIR16f6DFCUnMPoY28-YAc/edit)), there Will be casual guilds where you Will see everything. Not everyone Will play according to the meta, yet most people like to say outright that no guild Will accept someone just because they want to play the class they like to play.
---
You are talking rubbish.
---
Woops, your right. Sorry I don't normally type that word. And if I wanted to call him names it would not be the most kind hearted of saying you fucking idiot. But hey, sorry for the confusion!
---
they'd also have to rebalance classes that would then be available to have every dot up
---
Awesome. Thank you very much.
---
Love it. I played on the server where it was filmed (Dunemaul EU) and in the 2nd movie my char is actually in a small shot during the big fighting scene. It lagged like crazy because so many people were bunched up in one area. The server crashed when horde and alliance players charged into eachother for the scene and alot of horde players (including me) found themselves at the bottom of the cliff after they logged back in. Good times.
---
Also the HWL orc warrior was my guild leader haha. Oh the memories...
---
How many times does this website need to be spammed?
---
Relax dude
---
I'm never playing retail and it's worth it. There's a ton of work going into this and we're all super excited, it's not just sent circlejerk.
---
Can someone explain how shield block can stop crushing blows or crits? I know blocking removes the chance of a crit or crush, but youd have to predict them no?
---
Out of curiosity, why aren’t you buying it? 
---
Battle shouts always generated enough threat to keep mobs off the healers, there’s neutral bugs all over the room to generate enough rage to make it happen. Only challenge I see would be keeping enough group members close enough to optimize the threat gen.
---
I keep getting the urge to play wow and I know I could. It's right there. But when I log on. It's just...not it. I go to a place like goldshire and see everyone in their all so unique and special ridiculous looking mounts and ultra transmogged out stuff and all this fancy this and that's. and it just feels so fake. 
---
When everything has something special and special things are easy to come by, nothing is special or unique.
---
&gt;Wow has always been cheap.
---
Guild Wars 2 didn't even have a subs, and they did fine.   WoW was never cheap.
---
ITT: everyone who is too afraid to download a private server to test the classes they want to play before launch. 
---
Also, a lot of (vanilla)pservers are shutting down once classic launches out of respect for the classic movement. So there's your beta.
---
Thanks very much for this. Do you know how I refer to caster form or cancel bear form?  
---
I was trying to craft a macro like this  
---
 (if bear form) cancel bear form  
---
(if not bear form) use potion on first press, then cast bear form on second press (this used to be doable with /castsequence reset)  
---
would 
---
/run if( isBearForm() or isDireBearForm() ) then cancelaura BearForm();
---
work?
---
Confused why you think night let’s can’t do it but Tauren can. Lmaoo. If blessings is the reasoning, Tauren can’t have pally buffs either.
---
Totally agree.
---
Phase 3 isn’t an unreasonable amount of time for people to hit 60, but I would call it a little unreasonable to expect every launch player to have epic mount by then. Plenty of people put off buying their epic mount until after they’ve got some important BoEs, levelled professions, whatever. It can take months after you hit 60. 
---
I don’t want to feel pressured into investing in epic mount before everything else purely for the sake of aesthetic mount collecting. The attitude that it’s even an important part of vanilla feels very much like a retail mount-collector perspective. I also think people see it as integral for vanilla emulation mainly because Nostalrius did it this way, not because they actually played when these mounts were purchasable.
---
I fail to see how it wouldnt add to the world building. The inns are nothing right now just having people rushing in and out of them. This would mean you occasionally spot two characters sitting there playing cards. It would add to the world feeling and immersion and give inns a little more life. 
---
Sometimes I feel the hardstance against changes is overdone and overly critical. There clearly are additions made by the original devs that simply didnt make it into the game but were designed with the core-classic-feel in mind. 
---
This very well could have been your classic as the team were looking to make this a reality but cut it due to time constraints among other things. 
---
Simply saying ”notmyclassic” is so stubborn just for stubborns sake sometimes and I think we might miss out on an potential exciting development of the game because of it.
---
Be careful, this was considered retail at the time...
---
No no no. Wow as a competitive esport? Go play another game
---
could try something like this 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/AAPPDTAF86AOgpA
---
just a theory though
---
I apologise, I read r/mayhewk's post wrong
---
They’re very gold efficient if you can kill them. Mages doing this is one of the most lucrative farms in the game.
---
you mean and healing lol
---
Dont listen to all of the haters. The UD/Orc debate really comes down to what class you intend to play. Certain classes will shine as an Orc and others as UD.  
---
For example, if you're rolling:  Warrior, Warlock, Hunter, Shaman or Rogue, I would go Orc.
---
For something like Mage or Priest, I would definitely go Undead. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
in 2004-2006 it was 15$ now with inflation its 20$+, you've got your 5$ cheaper cost. You're welcome, I figured it out for you :)
---
The game was never aids at endgame.  Sorry bud, but I have played since beta and the majority of toxic players always filtered out.  Where they end up, I dont care to know.  
---
You must be always leveling alts and stuck in the barrens.  That “famous” chat is for people who can’t play the game efficiently
---
It's funny because where I'm from "numpty" is quite a kind way of calling someone silly. Maybe there is a cultural divide going on here
---
I wouldn’t mind an option for that either. Would really put a number on how many people are playing classic compared to retail.
---
Activision Blizzard is a publicly traded company though, they’re going to combine the subs together, to keep the stock holders happy, by showing the new and improved sub numbers. 
---
They will know the actual number of people subbing for classic, versus subbing to retail, all behind the scenes and maybe they will put forth resources to change the current version of the game for the better or adding to classic. Only time will tell.
---
AoE will def be the leading factor once DM is out. I’m doing Tailor for Archmage robes and Engine for PvP/Sappers in PvE. I like herb over skin for money making which is why I’ll make the swap at 60
---
Enhancement is a fine spec for leveling and 5mans, but that's it. 
---
Casual enhancement PvP is a myth, unless you are piano tryhard player then you might be capable of something, or the stars align and you get multiple crits in a row.
---
We all have seen these shaky screen metal music crit compilations, but these guys have pretty much crazy gear like Sulfuras.  Elemental is way more viable option.
---
If you heal in raids then you're getting healer loot. Pretty much every enhancement loot piece is contested by pure DPS classes unlike elem gear.
---
Druid is fine if you are fine playing resto
---
Druids are an awesome class
---
Bartender if you want to change the default look and have some more flexibility (not compatible yet I think).    
---
Onebag/bagnon or whatever, though there is a keybind to open all bags at once, the addon can remove some visual clutter.     
---
Vendor price is really useful, also an add-on tht let you compare your equipment without opening your character profile.    
---
Then something to track dots and debuff, so I read it has to be hardcoded.    
---
If you like something to change the aspect of nameplates and unitplates.      
---
Something to change visual look of windows like xloot and others.    
---
Some dps metter, clique maybe to bind stuff to mouse. 
---
Gathering add-ons, general map enhancers.    
---
Usually fubar with a bunch of add-ons but eventually it becomes such a clusterfuck that maybe it is better to try to keep the vanilla look as much as possible.
---
I’m gonna assume you’ve never RP’ed
---
My reminder thinger reminded me to come here. Any progress? Just curious friend. Cheers😁
---
&gt; Their time WILL come...it's just not going to be during raid progression.
---
IMO the fury tank guilds and druid tank guilds are the ones that have the damage to beat a boss in under 2 minutes. at that point they are almost begging for a challenge, so squishier tanks would be that challenge
---
If the boss raid damage will be like in Vanilla 1.12...Druids won't be MTs during raid progression.
---
Raids on farming status? Sure. Progression? Nope.
---
They will take too much damage during progression, and blue/green geared healers will go OOM before the boss is dead. Way before.
---
Same for BWL, T1/blue geared healers will go OOM with a Druid MT...if they somehow manage to keep him alive before going OOM.
---
AQ40, same issue.
---
Druid tanks need a combination of gear that shines AFTER AQ40, and even than, they will be subpar to Warrior, during progression in Naxx.
---
Sure, once a guild is AQ40/Naxx geared, they can farm MC for bindings, using a Bear as MT.
---
But to think that Bears that are MTing MC on private servers, with heavily undertunned bosses and T2/T3 healers in raids is the same as MTing MC in Classic, with harder bosses than private servers, with blue/green geared healers is somehow the same...it's really a stretch.
---
A VERY LONG stretch.
---
Yep. The boss damage is the real question whether we see ferals in speedruns or on the floor. When I first heard that parry chance was much higher my initial thought was that druids will suffer. But who knows what other numerical values are wrong on private servers.
---
I would agree with this sentiment. It almost makes more sense to not play a warrior if he's gonna spend more time pre-60
---
Barber shop, Orgrimmar style.
---
Okay, let's add the dungeonfinder system too because its convenient and enhances the experience, and pet battling, and crossrealm and oh shit its not classic anymore.
---
If it adds to the world building put it in Mainstream WoW and not the experimental nostalgia everyone has been waiting years for.
---
Break it to me?
---
I'm asking this precisely because I know how it goes.
---
I'm just asking how this is gonna work, since Blizzard is apparently already gating items with their respective patches.
---
Dunno how I found this capture of a Vent all those years ago, but it's an extremely funny display of why kids shouldn't try to act like an adult XD
---
I don't really understand this. I remember seeing somewhere that warriors was topping some statistics on DPS. Why couldn't you just join a raid as a pure DPS warrior?
---
I mean of course I understand if that makes it more difficult to gear up all the participants cause you will have more players sharing same drops, as opposed to rogues needing other type of gear.
---
But let's say everybody is as geared up as possible and you're doing Naxx for the sake of speedrun. Wouldn't you prefer all warriors and no rogues? IDK, I'm just asking here :) be gentle
---
I'm a big fan of no changes. But I have enjoyed the improved client and some of the graphical improvements too. I play on classic setting with a bit better shadows and a bit more ground clutter. That makes the game look exactly like my vanilla brain remember it (since in my mind I remember it looking better than it did).
---
I don't want any of the things listed above.  But after naxx has been out for a year or so I might like the idea of totally new content. Like content they scrapped for vanilla. Like lvl 60 karazhan, the other onyxia like raid instance in hyjal and hyjal itself. 
---
I think I might like that more than tbc.
---
This. Everything is relative. Guild wars was subscription-free and Runescape was $5 and could be ran on a toaster. WoW was definitely seen as expensive for the time.
---
Doesn't mean it wasn't worth it though.
---
Play a private server and learn to level.
---
You hit honored very quickly, before level 10 I believe.
---
Im fine with that but i will be mainly tank.
---
Could be, I guess it's a way of interpreting things but anyway, I will bow out of this and hang my head in shame.
---
PS: Not trying to be satcastic
---
How are they gonna test any high level content if they don't raise it?..
---
I haven’t played in almost 10 years, when I came back I was shocked to learn that you get all that content and the price still hasn’t changed.
---
Wat?? How about classic Aszhara.  Can't beat the fall colors and cool ocean ruins.
---
This is exactly what I mean. LFG didnt add to the experience it took away from the world building. I once again ask how this would subtract from the world building? 
---
How can you even make this sort of comparisson I strictly stated that since its in game and in world and takes place infront of your eyes and not in menus and instances its simply more flavor/nuance/authenticity to the world of Azeroth.
---
I love how spineless, entitled and lazy Western millenials long for Communism, thinking that they would be part of the party elite. Those kind of people would be the first to be purged when a competent leader gains power in the Party,
---
Just get a proper job m8 and stop fantasizing about robbing other’s property.
---
This is unfunny because it's stupid and highly inaccurate.
---
What exactly is your point? No one cares about gold in retail because just playing will grant you enough to keep you running for most things. In vanilla you have to actively farm gold weekly just to raid, let alone a ton of other things.
---
This meme is just so wrong it's not funny.
---
Naxx needs at least 4-6 tanks for some fights, so all our warriors ranked the bosses while rogues were behind them stabbing. 
---
I’ll put it this way, most high end raiding guilds will welcome DPS warriors over retribution paladins or feral druids, but if your single goal is melee DPS, just go rogue and the tanking thing is irrelevant and inapplicable to you.
---
It cant be often enough.
---
Shocked in a good way hopefully because it’s cheaper now, even though they haven’t changed the sub price.
---
Pservers also made changes to make these high yield farms less profitable, and I highly doubt Blizzard will make the same changes.
---
That's fine, just keep in mind that warrior will be the most played class in the game and it's just flat out better than feral tank.
---
I did mention in another comment. Maybe make the last 2 or 3 weeks of the beta instant level 60s. Let people play around with specs. Try stuff out. Give them tier .5 gear and some other random accessories so they can test things out at 60.
---
I’d prefer that over raising the cap.
---
this is legendary
---
When he met Ronda Rousy they both bonded over their love of  WoW and after that played together a lot. He was a Tauren I think paladin, and she was a Night Elf warrior.
---
he could of done it during progression, but it just took way longer. I guess thats how they want to play?
---
This is comparable to my last guild i was in during retail, that wouldnt down bosses till certain players severely out geared the fights.
---
I guess if thats how he wants to play then so be it. But he wont get as lucky this time around, he has to find a guild willing to forgo a warrior tank as MT... not an easy task
---
I would hope so.
---
Not all guilds used DKP back in Vanilla, so I would assume not all would use it in Classic especially if they could find a better system. But I would assume the majority of the more serious raiding guilds would use it yes, unless they found another way to do it.
---
&gt;Let’s not forget the hidden racial of increased melee distance that Tauren have
---
Have both as 2 separate interrupts?
---
Yeah but GW2 has an in-game shop.
---
Nah. It just means you need to use Restorative Potions.
---
It’s actually 18%
---
Well sometimes, the best way to solve these things is to listen to common sense
---
60 was fine, the real grind for me was getting my epic mount. I farmed thorium in Tanaris for days.
---
Consider Alliance is generally the more powerful faction in vanilla (paladins &gt; shamans), it might balance things out a bit. 
---
In modern WoW Horde is by far the biggest faction, but that was never the case in vanilla.
---
lol the funny thing is i google searched this to check if thats the correct spelling, people actually have youtube videos with that spelling in the title
---
Hmm I had the impression that almost every streamer was alliance *shrugs*
---
-	mining helmet isn’t really useful. The mining skill can be neat if it just pushes you to the next tier of materials, but you’ll rarely use it as-is. It’s a component to build the Goblin Rocket Helmet, so you will want to make one just for that. 
---
-	afaik, they’ll be putting the bullets-&gt;arrow NPC in. But don’t quote me on that, i’m not from blizzard
---
-	the weapon skill racials are cool to have, but shouldn’t be the end-all be-all of your race choice. Pick the race you like the most (you’ve chosen well, as dwarf is the best race)
---
-	assuming you’ve leveled in the proper faction-oriented zones, usually you’ll hit honored in the 20’s, perhaps sooner depending how many of the quests you’ve done
---
Esports.  ffs
---
Well PVPers have an excuse to tryhard. There aren't any good reasons not bring who ever the fuck you want to MC.
---
Anyone got an idea why people tend to favor the alliance?
---
If your goal is to tank I'd highly recommend going warrior as you'll be the first choice for raiding over all other tanks.
---
Im going Rogue lol... I just prefer Undead over Orc a million times to 1.
---
Unless you’re a dwarf spriest with resto pots /flex
---
I've started doing 5 pushups every time I have a session looking at wow classic stuff. Yesterday I did 25. Trying to get healthy before launch so I can go hard. I just don't think it's realistic for me to not look at anything wow related lol
---
I think the problem is deeper than making it so everyone wins.
---
The problem is that you don't need to seek out help from other people to win.
---
Questing in a group of 2 or 3 people is super easy in classic, but it works well for the game.
---
I was the MT during progression, when we first downed Rag it was with me being the MT for the entire raid. ME and the Warriors would cycle so all of us had experience in being both MT and OT. And you're right, it was a personal experience, but that doesn't make it any less valid. I remember Ony and Magmadar being annoying because of all the fears and since I was playing Horde we didn't have Fear Ward.
---
I've seen you going on about Feral spec in several threads and I don't really get your problem with it. It is viable, it has proven to be viable and if a guild wants to run their raids this way then they have that option.
---
Ton of work, my ass.  It's being built by the C team, and some interns.  Renting out the servers that they need for this game cost almost nothing.  How do you think those pirated servers were able to stay around?   So, then you only have the cost of remaking the game.  What's that?  Well, let's look at some other remakes that blizz has done.  SC is $20, I think?   WC3 is $30?   There's no way in hell this game should cost more than $60.
---
Yah, this is just circlejerk fanbois circlejerking, and defending Blizzard's greed, because they identify so strongly with the game that they've lost what little critical thinking skills they possessed.
---
Hell yes, i would argue its a BIG improvement even if you only surf the Web with the computer. Its all around a huge upgrade for your eyes and smoothness
---
Vaccinate your children
---
I’m not certain. The same functionality should be available but it’s usually less straightforward how to write it.
---
This is the classic subreddit bro
---
I see what you did there.
---
While this is true most guilds are gonna have 45 to 55 dedicated raiders, in case of emergencies or someone having to step out. 
---
We still would pug an under geared rogue or war before an enh shaman.
---
Good point But 90% of classic will be warrior so id like to change that.
---
The part where he virgin-shames half of the raid is priceless.
---
Definitely not
---
From what I know, this has been already fixed. I think the ID of the dungeon is now connected to each player ID, instead of each group ID.
---
Female orc if you don’t like the extra beef
---
Guess what you love is in the links title huh lul.
---
Anyway what class do you play.
---
People like you are what ruined retail in the first place. "I honestly care two shits why... It just is." You are the same type of person that is the first one to complain.
---
It's not up to the addon dev. If there's a way to display total HP (for instance, looking at combat log and then comparing those values to the % of health left), you can be assured that someone will write an addon for it. Only one able to prevent that is Blizzard, and it wouldn't be vanilla if they, for instance, made mob hp % protected from AddOns.
---
You are correct, and thats why i want to roll druid cos 90% of classic will roll warriors
---
The ping wont be **that** bad from NA to EU. The beta servers are hosted in the states and the EU streamers that I've seen are running around with ~160 ms. Additionally, nearly all pservers are hosted in Europe and tens of thousands of players have cleared content and pvped just fine. 
---
Keep your character EU imo.
---
I think people should just accept that from Blizzards perspective, Classic is a free bonus feature of having a subscription. And we should be happy about that, because there is really no way we would get any of that cheaper if it was seperate. If they had increased the price, that would be a different story.   
---
If you play Classic only, nothing has changed from back then. If you only play retail nothing has changed too. If you play both, its a damn good deal.   
---
In general I can totally understand the "dont force me to buy something I dont want so I can buy what I want" point. But in this case its absolutely uncalled for and to me seems like the good old "i want it cheaper".
---
yea that's the thing, I would love a better system, dkp was so time consuming.  I remember waiting so long to get loot after boss drops because people would be betting, and it would just take forever making the raids take even longer than they should.
---
I just don't think many have even thought of this yet.  Very interested to see how this pans out.
---
[Warcraft Chronicle Volumes I-III.](https://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-Chronicle-BLIZZARD-ENTERTAINMENT/dp/1616558458)
---
My guild tanked twins 100% with two warriors during vanilla. The initial agro was enough for a full teleport cycle.
---
You would only damage the melee twin.
---
Pretty spot on. 15*(1.02^15)=20.2
---
idk if there is a better system considering there hasnt been one since
---
At the end of the day it's up to you, but tanks are still going to be the least played role, they always are, so being a Warrior just gives you that extra edge, but again it's all up to you and if you understand the extra challenges coming from druid tank and still want to do it, go for it.
---
care to explain?
---
My guild is. DKP loot council combo.
---
Not at all at Naxx
---
&gt;  reinstate the way old macros work.
---
:D
---
^(:DDD)
---
so think people are just gonna roll on loot?
---
Reagents stacking to 20 limits bag space and makes people choose about what they want to carry. 
---
Additionally it keeps people traveling to from the world to their bank/vender to get more reagents or to vender other things to keep their bags clear. Forced travel is really important, it keeps the world bustling. 
---
This is a really minor one. But they add up.
---
He doesn’t say Tauren could do it, but if you don’t equate Pally buffs to totems, you’re missing the point.
---
Don't take the post for granted. There's assumption that boss damage (each individual hit) is tuned equally as on private servers so increased parry chance (on classic/the real one) will lead for more boss hits (this is true). However, there haven't been any confirmations yet if private servers have tuned the damage higher or lower. It is still true that warriors mitigate more damage but higher threat makes faster kill times possible aswel and thus reduce the overall damage during fight. We shall see later if the boss damage is unbearable for druids or not
---
Source: Trust me bro.
---
I have yet seen anyone providing actual proof of this.
---
It hasn't been necessary since Vanilla.
---
Ill check it out! Thanks
---
Loot council is among the better systems.
---
I don't want something like DKP because that means an inferior player who does not bring consumes and flasks to a raid is as entitled to loot as I am.
---
You want to gear up the most dedicated and performing players first, not those who save up a lot of points.
---
thanks man ill go for it!
---
You're again making a ton of assumptions. I'm not claiming you're wrong but we really need to see what damage is like in raids before making these claims. 
---
During retail Vanilla my guild actually had a MT Druid and OT Druid (I was the OT Druid). We were a casual guild and never saw past Vael in BWL but I dont ever remember either myself or the MT struggling with staying alive.
---
Oh, then that means everyone agrees on everything related to classic if it's stated here? My bad, bro, wasn't sure if sheep mentality was as prevalent here
---
What is the top 3 DPS heirarchy (potential) in 
---
1) mc 
---
2) bwl 
---
3) aq40 and 
---
4) naxx
---
They pretty clearly do not think taurens can do it either
---
And dungeons don't feel as much like a dps race in the first place. It's more balanced around working as a team.
---
You can always get new friends, and you dont play 100% with them at all Times anyway, you will group with new ppl, get in a good guild, go alliance
---
He said Tauren can’t. Their missing too many classes.
---
Alliance is better performing in PvE and PvP due to paladins salvation as well as paladins enabling a lot more top tier setups in premades rather than horde. Not saying shamans are weak but alliance is just busted due to palas.
---
Perfect answer!
---
You are a salty one ;)
---
This isn’t meant for veterans or serious progression players and above. This series is for those that are either new to the game or want to play a bit more casually. I hope you enjoy the first episode of possibly five that I plan on releasing.
---
He has viable information on why they're suboptimal. You're spewing some anecdotal story of how people carried you through MC.
---
Fun fact the price of a wow sub has risen the same amount as my hourly wage at my job since it's inception!
---
Pretty easy if you ask me. Only for quite a lot of money i would touch retail ever again. Been clean on that since middle of wotlk.
---
&gt; Hell I was making damn near 70 to 100g an hour farming ele earth and solid stone if I had an uncontested spot 
---
And there are many more ways to make similar gold in the open world, compared to Dungeon farming. I was making 60g / hour, at lvl 50, farming ele earth and solid stones. The trash items and greens that drop in 1 hr from elemental farming is like 20g alone.
---
There are plenty of farming places in Classic, and gold won't be an issue for anyone who can pull off 1 hr of farming every day.
---
The no-lifers will ofc be rich AF...but not because DM farming. But because FARMING in general. They just do it for 5 hours, instead 1 or 30 min.
---
I am one of them so...I know :D
---
Stop trying to shove esports in to every fucking game. FFS!
---
No idea what you’re talking about and have no interest in answering your questions, but the fact that you’re still here tells me all I need to know about you. That’s why I have now blocked you and will never again read anything you write. Sleep soundly knowing I truly believe I wiped the floor with you here. Take care!
---
What? So I'll waste weeks just for levelling different classes? I said I'd try different classes to see how they work, because you know it's beta testing, not to decide what to main...
---
./console ffxglow 0
---
At least I think that’s the command I used. Someone please correct me if it’s not.
---
It's fun
---
Back in the day I had an allowance of roughly 40$, converted to mericacoins, and there was no problem paying my sub. Just had to cut back on other expenses.
---
the removal of master looter was not well received, guilds that understand not everyone should get gear at random if the guild wants to make the best progress found ways to circumvent this new system
---
For top end hardcore guilds going for server/world first, loot council is a must. For all other guilds DKP is the most fair (not the most fair for individauls, but the most fair for guilds as a whole).
---
other guilds that award loot via roll will have trouble keeping members once they have what they need. I feel need rolling is not best for a guilds long term success.
---
I would pay 30% more tbh!
---
I don't want to assume anything ;)
---
Is Xaryu pariticapting? 
---
Is there a list of the participants?
---
Ah ah ah you didn't say the magic word
---
On a serious note, both races are great. And even if one had a distinct advantage, it wouldn't matter. Even if you're not RPing persay, the cool part about MMOs is being able to subconsciously get into character and **be** an UD Rogue. If you dont think you could enjoy looking at your character for the next few thousand hours because of how it looks, you're picking the wrong race.
---
I'd roll UD if I were you, for the same reason I'm going Tauren. Because cow Master Race.
---
I believe this got fixed at one point in classic. By the time 1.12 rolled out you couldn't aoe farm DM anymore.
---
Where did i say its impossible for other races?
---
I also was in the top 10 furys on Nost as a Dwarf. After AQ40 you start falling behind more and more because youre missing one slot worth of stats.
---
I dont entirely disagree with you but at the same time, but criticizing people for being too nostalgic in this subreddit is like getting annoyed for at the beach for beinf too sandy.
---
Probably cannot change this guys mind. It's worth arguing for the benfit of people that might be visiting the thread with no prior knowledge about Vanilla however.
---
We really dont want these people to be met with a wall of misinformation like what TheRealCollector keeps typing.
---
Holy shit...never thought of that.
---
Good catch OP.
---
This will have to be addressed by Blizzard. If they already did, they should make a blue post about it. It's quite damn important to know how epics will be disenchanted in Classic.
---

---
Take your time dude, enjoy the journey.
---
Yeah that’s what I was getting at, I was surprised they didn’t raise it when other mmo’s like runescape have. It’s a good thing.
---
&gt; You want to gear up the most dedicated and performing players first, not those who save up a lot of points.
---
it will be hard to keep players if they arent getting gear, and if they have no idea how and when they will get gear. DKP allows people to kind of know when they are due for some upgrades.
---
Also proper Guild management wouldnt allow under performers to just sneak by. If other guildies are more prepared they will get the raid spot. At the end of the day a properly managed guild takes the most prepared to the raids. Thus DKP would work
---
Why tho. Is there's something extra edgy and competitive about being a bad guy monster?
---
In this case i totally agree
---
&gt; it's definitly a good feature since it was in Vanilla
---
No comment.
---
You want to gear up the most “necessary” upgrades for players in a hardcore guild, not the most dedicated players.
---
Anyone who raids is entitled to the purple pixels, dont assume you are better than anyone else because you can consume.

Imagine putting all your spare time for the whole week into a raid and being denied upgrades because some biased loot council gives it to the guy who can farm 30 hours a week for guild mats/food/pots.

Hunter falls off hard once other classes start getting their t2/t3

That’s a different bug completely. My fix was in 1.2.5 that was reckoning which wasn’t fixed until 1.10 I believe.
---
I wouldn't make the call just yet. We don't know how much damage the bosses really do. Everything you said is true: bosses will hit more often and druids will take more damage than warriors as always but we barely know half the story yet. It might be that boss damage is still survivable even after bad rng and in general druids are used for speedclears, not for progress

The dollar value of your minimum wage job has however. Which has to happen because of inflation.

That’s why you hear “Back in my day, such and such was this, and now it’s that”
---
Am I?  What is it you think justifies a $15 a month sub just for classic?   Why isn't the game a flat fee like the other remakes?  What justifies not having a standalone sub for only classic?  
---
This is just more greed from Activision Blizzard, and you guys are defending it, because you want to defend the game.

They did that to be able to sell more gold, not because it was bad for the economy.

I did not get to level 10 during the stress test, but during the Blizzcon Demo I was able to use
---
    /cancelform
---
    /cast Bear Form
---
for instant form swapping.
---
I did try to use the old method of keybinding macros during the stress test -- for me I was trying `/run SetBinding("CTRL-F1","Test Macro")SaveBindings(2)` \-- but it didn't seem to be working for whatever reason.
---
Basically during Vanilla I rebound my forms to cancelform macros as Ctrl+F1 - Bear, Ctrl+F2 - Caster, Ctrl+F3 - Cat, Ctrl+F4 - Travel / aquatic (I think, aquatic may have been F5).  I'm sure I can replicate it if I pull my macros out to my bars, but I did prefer just binding straight to the macros and saving action bar space.

i think the batching window is the same as it was in vanilla, but because our internet is so much better then it was 15 years ago we have much less latency so it feels like the window is much bigger then it used to be. personally i think itd be a good idea to scale the batching window down a bit to compensate for our improved internet.

I have a GTX 1070 with a 144hz 1440p monitor and most modern games won't even run past 100 fps on 1440p. With this graphics card, for demanding games you have to chose 144hz OR 1440p. Bethesda games tend to glitch with everything above 60 frames, so do many others console ported games. Keep that in mind.
---
Classic tho runs super smooth and it's a hell of a difference to the 1.12 client.
---
You heard it here first folks. Having a higher threat ceiling will make MC take twice as long.

All of the points that you make were made when moving from pre-wow mmos to wow.

The WoW team have not really changed their approach.  The best metaphor that I can come up with is that the devs thought that the car was going too fast, so they put their foot on the brake.  When the care slowed down a bit then a lot more people liked it.  The foot has now been on the brake for 15 years and at this point the car is going so slowly that the previous crowd of people no longer like it.
---
Read the post title
---
I'm gonna be rolling a priest.
---
The logic behind it is im looking for a class that's gonna be usefull in both pvp and pve with atleast one solid offspec.Having a fun offspec that can also kick ass in pvp is just a bonus and some casual shadow pve is just the cream on top.I am not expecting to raid as shadow (atleast not progression raids) but solid holy priest has almost guaranteed raid spot in nearly every single raid.
---
As for warriors...considering how 90% of the playerbase is having wet dreams about TF warrior tank ,the competition is gonna be fierce..and also someones gonna have to heal all those tanks(which is another reason for rolling a healer) so instead of the usual "lf tank dungeon x,last spot" i reckon it's gonna be "tank lfg dungeon x".
---
Fair enough. Thanks for the extensive answer.
---
Imagine responding to a response to a statement created by images from a television show with captions this way

Like I said, you just need to relax. The game is worth that to those of us that want to play it and will pay that. What's the big deal? I'm not thinking "OMG BLIZZARD GREED CIRCLEJERK BWAAAH THEY SHOULD AJDUST IT BY 6 DOLLARS"... I just want to play some classic and pay what I paid before. Simple as that. You're making it some crusading point, deciding who's done what for the game and how.... Jesus dude, if it's not the right price for you then don't by it, suuuper simple. I haven't played WoW in 12 years. I'm going to play classic for fun, and if it gets to a point where I feel it's not worth it then there's a super simple solution.
---
That and if you do the math, 15 bucks isn't what it used to be. It's the equivalent of 11 bucks back then. That's one lunch for me these days... Meh.
---
I think this is mostly because of the market share. They really never lost much of that. They’ve been the king MMORPG for years now. With each new expansion too, players would come back for a while then leave.
---
And wow does not? Do you know how much money they get for cosmetics, pets, mounts, transfers, boosts etc?
---
God you people are fucking idiots. They aren't expected to remember everything 100%. They report things they suspect aren't correct and blizzard verifies it on their 1.12 environment. Who else would even *suspect* things like the mob damage being off? Nobody who played later expansions only would have known to report this. Remember, it DID end up being incorrect due to a bug with buffs persisting after expiration. 
---
Also trying to use private servers as an argument against vanilla players is incredibly stupid. First of all, many people never played or had any part of private servers. Secondly, it's actually fucking impressive how much private servers *did* get right, and how close some of the things that are wrong ended up being. You don't have a single clue what you're talking about and it's extremely evident.
---
And for the record, because I know you and probably the other retards reading my comments are thinking it - I did NOT play vanilla and I don't expect nor want a beta invite. I started in TBC. But at least I'm intelligent enough to acknowledge that those players *are* more valuable than random people are.
---
DKP will always be there for the casual guilds, probably even some more hard ore
---
Loot council will be there for the guilds that consider the entire raid as one person.  An upgrade helps out one player more than another which in turn helps the raid by a percentage.  
---
Council will also be used by casual guilds who have a friend core that will tend to get all the gear, shy away from that
---
No you didn't. I found two reasons.
---
1 Shield can't be used
---
2 doesn't have any way to buff a warrior offense wise
---
The first point quite literally doesn't matter, because I'm pretty sure there are plenty of shaman/pala/druid spells that are equally as useless to a warrior. Making the usefullness of a class dependend on a single skill is ridiculous. Especially in vanilla where a ton of spells from all classes are at best usefull in very specific situations.
---
The second again, doesn't really matter, the leveling content doesn't every single pont of strenght, crit-chance or whatever. The heals alone will allow any Warrior/Heal combo to do pretty much everything available outside of dungeons and a priest can still do damage, if skilled shadow he might not even have to cast actually healing spells for harder mobs.
---
Yes priest might not be as good, but just because other classes are better, it doesn't mean priest is bad. There is a big difference between bad and not as good.
---
Finally the most important thing, it's a game, play it to have fun, so whoever you want to play with should be leveling the class he wants and has the most fun with.
---
And to top it all off, the RPG elements, which seem to be cut from today's games, keep me engaged beyond the immersion.
---
Are you joking? Being beaten by an arms warrior in PvE?
---
I hope you get it too man
---
As has been said before in several other threads he's posting in, check the youtube videos that Skarm Tank has made. He has several of them explaining the differences between Feral druid tanks and Warriors. He goes very in depth and gives you pros and cons to both, very informative. The one with TipsOut is especially well made.

One of the reasons you even use a bear tank is because they can generate a ridicilous amount of threat with pummeler maulspam.

If that's not needed, there's not much of a reason to use them over warriors.

I reported mass amount of players especially in tbc when botting came more popular. I reported 50+ players and added them in friendlist too. Some people were still botting after 2-years. So please stfu if you have no clue.

&gt;I saw a druid tank get killed by Ossirian The Unscarred in 2 hits last week, it was pretty embarrassing for him to go “yeah guys, sorry, druid shit, sometimes you get crit/crushed to open with”
---
If the tank died in two hits then it's because the raid did not activate the crytals in time. Warriors get 1-2 shot there as well.
---
Agreed, it's the same reason that I won't play on a private server. The whole point of WoW for me is progressing my characters, and if they don't stick around what's the point?

LOL Imagine preaching about how he should think of his family when the guy is at work most of his life. My girl's dad works long hours managing a car dealership. He provides for their entire family and she's very respectful of that, but she barely knows the guy. It may be necessary in his current situation, but i clearly said that either way it's a waste of life. Good chance his kids grow up not knowing who their father is. Doesn't matter if they respect with all their hearts what he did for them, it's the bond you build by spending time together that's important and all i said is that i hoped he found a way out of that shit existence.

Lord of the Clans is really good. It's about Thrall's journey from slave to Warchief.
---
No it did not have this in Legion. Ilvl is still important and I want to remoce it... Wow lost its pvp community. Your critisism is about pve. I separate this from pvp.. 
---
Yes wow classic is way to imbalanced.. If not that everybody can pick the same... So there will be people who want to organize tournaments..
---
Yeah I know these things are hated.. But like Vanilla... Classic will not be forever.. It would lose value. So I suggest to expand Vanilla with the other expansions instead of building upon it
---
&gt;Then you have guys like Patchwerk where the damage spike is all the time, and there indeed using a Druid is a bad idea, but most bosses are chill in that regard.
---
Actually not the case. Hateful Strike is incapable of critting. Druids will be an excellent choice there.
---
Always been in the same guild that is still there fixes this. (And doing decent content)
---
this server will be a fairy tale land, where streamers are the heroes and the villians. Id expect it to be such a hallow experience if everyone just helps asmongold beat the horde streamer for every little thing...
---
Arms was go to dps spec until later patches in Vanilla
---
The fact is unless you play druid, you join a huge pop. Yes there are more rogues than priests but there's still a lot of priests !
---
Hm, I think I will not have the time at all unfortunately. So I will never get my hands on the best gear which is okay as long as I can casually enjoy the journey to 60.
---
If pvp is important to you think about the pvp trinkets. The rogue trinket doesnt cleanse stun but does cleanse fear effects. So it might be more beneficial to go or rogue for the chance to resist stuns that you cant cleanse. But if you go undead you can wotf charm and fear so you can skip the pvp trinket and take another bis item. Dont know if pvp matters but worth thinking about the vanillia trinket effects
---
Not really upset at people for noatalgia. This is just pandery. Like its the friggen box art for the game, AND it gets posted here all the time. It was just op posting a picture with nothing to add. If they had added something to it like an experience or how that screenshot made them buy the game...then thats fine. But this just isint any of those things. Its pandery as fuck.
---
I think the solution is just to stop the power creep. Freeze Classic at 60, start reworking BC content into the lv60 classic framework. Then do WotLK, then Cata and so on.
---
The real challenge follows: Why do new raids if the gear isn't any better? You'd have to re-think the reward structure in WoW (which to be fair I think needs to be done anyway - boring Microsoft Excel loot is awful). .
---
It really amazes me how people here are actually protecting botters or gms who protect them. You people are pathetic.
---
I botted 2-3 years and I got mounts like  [Scepter of Azj'Aqir](https://www.wowhead.com/item=64883) without doing anything myself. No bans. Please stop fooling yourself.
---
Go ahead and dislike you retards. Botting will always be in game because gamemasters are fucking useless clowns.
---
&gt; Once a mage has the Mara scepter
---
What scepter do you mean?

Bc he doesn’t know what he is talking about. They’ve stressed resented enough people for a normal server. They probably won’t open beta. Who even cares those toons are getting wiped y’all
---
Thanks, but I know. :)
---
It turns the glow off completely. I like the glow in Vanilla. In Classic it's too strong.
---
I never said anything about endgame. Endgame is a really small part of wow overall. And ofcourse the dipshits gets filtered out the guilds.
---
Okay you stupid motherfucker. You have to be trolling at this point. I never ONCE said that i wouldn't do it. I never once said that it wasn't necessary. I said that it is a waste of life. That is all. You are so fucking stupid it hurts dude. holy shit.
---
Iirc hunter gets a sweet 6(?) set t3 bonus and 2set (?) t2 bonus that boosts BM dps significantly...however mages and warlocks (and in later stages fury and maybe rogue) are miles ahead of hunters.
---
Hunters became really good in tbc when stedy shot BM rotations pumped out some great dps.
---
I find the hypothetical crushingblow crit streak hilarious, it‘s the same like the hypothetical dodge streak from a tank pov 🤷🏻‍♂️ rarely happens. And if it happens, who cares during progression? It‘s not like you gonna wipe all time cause of something like that happening. 
---
Feral tanks tanks are still easier to heal as the dmg they receive is more predictable, plus they have a larger HP pool especially on horde side. 
---
If you go preraid bis into MC as feral, you got 75% mitigation from physical attacks, and have around 20%+ dodge and an hp pool of approx 7k hp with a flask of titans only and no other buffs. So what on earth does make you think a few more squeezed in bosshits could nail a feral tank down? Besides the healers are sleeping 😂
---
It's not cheap with regards to games in general. At the time anyway, almost all games were one-time purchases and at best an expansion pack once in a while, which WoW did as well. But even so, you'd have to last 2-3 months with an AAA game to get the same value. And in the modern age of F2P/mass micro transactions it's easy to spend more as well.
---
But, even more than that, going to a pub/movie/whatever for a single evening is likely to cost more than a month of WoW subscription. It is an extremely cheap source of entertainment, at best it just doesn't stand out too much in a generally cheap sector of the entertainment industry, especially back in 2004.
---
If you don’t like them enough to want to game with them just don’t add them, pretty simple. Unless you’re the raid leader it’s pretty easy to avoid awkward conversations with them about not doing certain things with them. Other than that, wow isn’t your job so don’t be a bitch that stresses out because your buddy sucks, some of my best times in wow involved playing with friends that sucked.
---
right
---
Thanks for sharing your experiences and reflections. It made me wanna stick to my decisoin of leveling a warrior. I do enjoy the concept of creating my own armour etc, so will definetly spend time on leveling mining and bs, as well as fishing, cooking and first aid. Going slow dont matter to me as long as I can somewhat feel challenged but occasionally destroy some mobs here and there. In retail wow I just destroy everything with no sense of progression which obviously is too boring.
---
Bro big Mac Mondays were the best. Only $1 and I'd eat 4 or 5.
---
I prefer at zero but setting at 1 too much?
---
Int, Mp5 and plus healing
---
Wtf
---
Another reason why I’m switching from horde to alliance hunter.
---
Main reason being shamans are useless for hunter and paladins are op. And shamans really suck at healing in pvp from my experience in retail vanilla, they are selfish.
---
Perfect! That's what I needed to hear. Just read so many points comlpaining about the difficulty and pain associated to level a warrior.
---
There is nothing wrong with Druids if topping meters is not your main priority and if you are willing to heal when its required. Feral offtanking can work quite well and if you are dedicated enough you can easily find a guild which will take you (but there will be situations where you are going to heal).
---
For 5 man content as a healer I’ve had quite good experiences with Druid tanks and even as a DPS I’d rather have a Druid tank than a Druid healer due to the lack of non-battle Rez.
---
Yeah I have a GTX 1070 and it's not really suited for 144hz and 1440p with everything on max on newer games. Depends on the game you have to switch to 60hz or 1080p.
---
I like to tank so it was easy to pick warrior.
---
True, but phase 2 was set to release after 3-6 months. Which means blizz would probably release phase 3 3-6 months after phase 2. We also know that layers are to be combined at phase 2 so it might be a longer release time as population stabalizes.
---
My guild does two nights a week, about 4 hours each with a small break in the middle.
---
But that's just false. You'll encounter shitty people regardless if you don't exclusively play with friends and only interact with them. 
---
You make it seem like the "true" vanilla players are all good people. But this is just not true. Classic will have as many shitty people as any other online game. Boosting his confidence with lies isn't a good way to do it.
---
this will be for your guild. How do you know if this will be successful?
---
Yep, I Druid tanked in Vanilla raids myself. I’ve been reading various threads in this subreddit and that guy is *constantly* posting hate on Druid tanking. He’s triggered beyond belief. It’s sad and pathetic.
---
Warlock mount isn’t actually free
---
You need to relax, and stop making bad arguments. 
---
What you think the game is worth is not the argument being made here.   Blizz could charge $10,000 a day, and you could argue that it's "worth" it.   Worth is totally subjective.
---
&gt;  I just want to play some classic and pay what I paid before 
---
Really?  You want to pay what you paid before?  ROFL!  Bull fucking shit.  You have already made your mind up on this issue.  Talking to you is like talking to a wall.   You wont listen to reason.  Thus, hive mind circle jerk.
---
&gt; You're making it some crusading point, deciding who's done what for the game and how.... Jesus dude, if it's not the right price for you then don't by it, suuuper simple. 
---
First off, calm down.  Secondly, I am just debunking the shit argument, because they're shit.
---
&gt; That and if you do the math, 15 bucks isn't what it used to be.   It's the equivalent of 11 bucks back then 
---
Now, we are back to the shit argument.  Inflation has not increased that much in the last 15 years,  $15/$11, but the cost of developing the game, and future content isn't he same either.  It's much much cheaper to just remake the old content.   In fact, after the initial release, all the content is basically done.   The only thing left is the last few raids and a couple dungeons.
---
In 2005, the monthly fee was justified, because they had to develop new content.  Even though, plenty of other games didn't have a sub fee, like GW2.  What's the justification now?   What's the justification for classic not having a standalone sub?
---
So, this is a classic daggers build. Look up ‘Seal Fate’ builds for PVP. You can also go 31/8/12 for the extra crit on backstabs.
---
There are a few points. First, you won’t be wasting energy on SS as a dagger build. Second, you need extra CP generation from CP on crit. Last, you wouldn’t think so but the 10 energy from Vigor is important.
---
If you want to PVE as a dagger build, Combat Daggers is your ticket. 5/31/15 if I remember correctly.
---
Cost on retail is not irrelevant. Server population dictates costs since there is less gold flowing through the economy things will cost less than private servers.
---
So this was my experience as well and I tried to mention this in a different post. Someone said tbc killed wpvp and I thought that was wrong cause I was pretty sure bgs killed wpvp. Did you play on a pve server?
---
A good loot council gives upgrades first to the players that will improve the chance of progression. This generally means the size of the upgrade matters as well as how often that person raids. DKP can mean that someone who gets a 1% upgrade from an item may get it first, while a loot council should give it to the player who gets a 10% upgrade from it.
---
I mean, it's about progressing further, and you do that by gearing your best people first cause the gear is going to be much more effective on them.
---
this will be different for every guild.
---
Casuals wont require too much of anything. and there will be guilds that require everyone have full buffs and consumables
---
I'm not saying it is. I'm trying to find a potential bug in Blizzard's implementation, because you are only able to get the current HP percentage. Yes, you can indeed make estimations based on how the percentage moves around, like you used to, but as standard the game should not allow you to see the exact amount.
---
Now I actually happen to think this doesn't matter, but since we're going #nochanges, this limitation has to be respected.
---
I’m using questie on a pserver right now, but I find it quite confusing; it shows quests I can’t take, even though I tweaked it not to show them, and it shows quests I have don’t if it loads after those are completed. 
---
Is it like this in official Classic as well, or is it more likely just buggy because of the unofficial client?
---
It’s on the 1.12 patch.
---
Fishing is a great way to make money, much more efficient than farming at low levels. Especially early on, I imagine a lot of people will skip out on secondary profs and just power level to 60, so you can get in on that market early. Not sure how soon people will start buying though, you may have to sit on them for a few weeks.
---
 a semi-corrupt loot council will get your further than fair DKP, imo.
---
This is for everyone who thinking about trying retail again. 
---
If you haven't played WoW in years, then maybe you might enjoy retail, you know catching up lore and other stuff.
---
However if you played let's say Legion, or even the beginning of BfA and unsubbed just like few months or year ago. I wouldn't suggest wasting time on it. BfA is much worse version of Legion and you'll hate what the hell happened to your favourite class and unless you're a raider, you'll hate endgame content. I'm still subbed, but only to finish level 50 neck on my main by doing WQs because I don't even bother doing M+ or PvP for weekly chest anymore and then I log off. Thank god it's almost done. I'm doing that only to get ready for 8.2, but I'm seriously losing interest even in that patch after trying PTR. I wanted to get glad in PvP, I'm 2.2k because I almost didn't play PvP for weeks already, but I can't drag myself to do even that. 
---
Like honestly, I haven't tried pserver in years but I was thinking about trying one. Nothing hardcore, I'll keep that for the actual Classic, but just chilling, learning levelling routes and getting used to vanilla classes and gameplay after spending so much time on retail in the last few years. I doubt I'd burn myself in 3 months anyway, especially if I won't play hardcore. I mean there's no way I'll stick with BfA for 3 months, hell fucking no.
---
&gt; We can't unlearn what we know. 
---
which is why classic is just not going to be as good as vanilla.
---
I personally like the visuals, encounter design (not the dungeon design) and mechanics (not class design) of retail, but I feel the design of the world overall is pure trash. They removed core elements of the genre.
---
It reminds me of starcraft 1 being ruined for me by the majority of people just wanting to play BGH or some sort of money map. Those maps removed a big part of the game. They didn't go ahead and remove resources when they designed starcraft 2, they doubled down and made a matchmaking system where you had to play blizzard-made maps.
---
Blizz just lost sight of their own design. They could have moved in the direction they did without ruining the game, but they decided to not give a shit. Ion says "we don't want you to hate the game" but they actively design content without the fundamental principles of what makes an MMO.
---
Their shitty design had the ripple effect on other games as well. I tried playing ESO and I honestly cant feel any difference in my character's power at any point leveling. I don't care about gear because everything is so easy. And it's a shame because the crafting system feels really good, but theres no reason to need anything. (Obviously im sure that changes at higher levels, but why not just make it mayyer right away?).
---
I just point people to old school RuneScape when they say it's just nostalgia.
---
The pros have said to go Agi first.
---
Gearwise, Iwould personally go Agi&gt;Stam&gt;Strength&gt;Int. 
---
I would enchant Int, Mana and Stam. You want to have a lot of HP and Mana because you want to survive long enough to have a chance at a few WF crits. 
---
Yyou want a large Mana pool for shocks and heals. I would also personally pass on Stormstrike and instead go for Nature's Swiftness in resto.
---
Good point.
---
Sadly most old games don't support 144hz. They glitch out or you have to spend hours to fix it to run properly on 144hz. Plus most console ports are hard locked at 60fps.
---
can someone explain the principles of Loot councils? I recognise dkp from back in the days.
---
Thanks
---
Pretty sure the settings range is from 0-3. Is 1 or 2 still too much?
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Dispel_Magic - says 14%
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=527 - says 18%
---
Its kind of moot though. My point is that on fights like lucifron you get 40 people get a debuff that hits for 2k damage. You will oom from dispells after 10-15 casts and a few heals.
---
There is no range. It's of/on (0/1).
---
You sound like a giant sarcastic jagoff. I wonder howany of us will have to mute you in the Barrens.
---
What can you tell me on lvl 60 tank druids in 5 man pls ?
---
Loot Council is waaay better than DKP because LC is always optimal and dont require administration. Just hand out loot in the most optimal way. That means that the super nice social member can get loot if you want, or the new guy, or the best player who have the highest dps or that warrior who need the item for ovo or whatever is optimal. Optimal is always optimal.
---
In the end, the lack of community broke what most people love about classic, it had a lot of redundant things which were there because the devs at that time didn't think it through.
---
What some people aren't going to understand until later on when they see it for themselves is that the community has changed because internet and gaming culture as a whole has.
---
Not in canada
---
They’re open to TBC and post Naxx content based on subs and player preferences, but that’s at least two years out. No way to know until then.
---
Optimist : "WoW sub is 30% cheaper than 15 years ago"
---
Realist : "The other costs are 30% more expensive than 15 years ago"
---
how i cant see anyone taking a full year to level, unless you arent playing for days and weeks at a time... Wow classic has a few very good catchup systems, ZG and AQ20 to name the biggest 2
---
I remember with my guild, we just did a /roll on gear we needed. But my guild only went to MC and ony. I only started raiding about 5 or so months before tbc
---
&gt; No it did not have this in Legion. 
---
Spec templates in legion made gearing feel pretty unrewarding and the community didnt like that direction. pros and streamers heavily advocated the template system but in the end it was scraped for bfa (i think because they just hadnt had enough time to balance them, they pulled some "community wants gear progression in pvp"-excuse) 
---
&gt; So I suggest to expand Vanilla with the other expansions instead of building upon it 
---
Yes, but keep the core values of classic pls. A lot of people would argue that minmax-mindsets stemmed from ever increasing competitiveness and blame this circumstance for the course of the game. You want to add transmog, more competitive goals and to eliminate gear in certain aspects of the game? :O
---
It nullifies the value anyway because, as someone already mentioned, people will save them till the patch drops and then de everything.
---
I just lost my friend to heroin. He and I used to play wow in high school. He had been in rehab twice and was going on two or three years clean, then just one night last week...
---
We were gonna play classic again just like we did in high school. Now I’m gonna be making a character for him and crying while leveling alone.
---
Yeah same. Genuinely I've been trying really hard to enjoy it but I log on and just walk around Orgrimmar and do a single dungeon and then get off. PvP is a shitshow because every class has 13 stuns, silences, slows, etc. and PvE is no fun because I know I'm just going through the motions because you can't really fail at retail WoW.
---
Mila Knuis recently said she still raids casually but her character name is anon and she dosnt use voice.
---
Don't wanna say it but it rhymes with Wyatt Conserver tehehe
---
Same. I spent a lot of time on rp-pvp servers and 90% of the people on there whether they rp'ed are no were noticeably nicer and more mature than other servers. This really can't be argued.
---
You won't, only streamers get in.
---
If you want to play, play on private servers for the time being
---
Keep in mind that Chronicles are new and retcon a lot of stuff, and as such might not really go very well with vanilla. It's modern lore tweaked to fit the modern game.
---
Really, all you need is Warcraft 3/TFT. Just read up online what happened before that in WC 1 and 2.
---
Actually the OPs post is full of competely wrong info. I can't be bothered to type a wall of text right now but take a look at the other feral tank thread on this sub right now - the OP is making a whole load of completely ludicrous claims in the comments to that thread which have been shown to be false by people in the replies.
---
HAGS
---
UD is fine for rogue. If you were going warrior I would strongly recommend orc for PvE. The +5 axe skill is very huge.
---
It's you who don't have a clue what you are talking about. You are just on a rant about how stupid GMs because you and other hackers did not get banned 7 or more years ago. You are such a manchild with no understanding how things work, grow the fuck up.
---
The real TL:DR
---
Bosses hit more often with higher parry chance and faster attack speed will result for more overall boss hits and damage. Druids have worse damage mitigation than warriors thus taking more damage.
---
What your post didn't say was that druids generate more threat and because of that faster kill times are possible which will result less overall damage in encounter.
---
What your post says but doesn't prove is if druids can survive bad rng and all extra damage compared to warriors. As of now, no one has tested and confirmed how high boss damage really is and whether it will be a problem. It could be the same, higher or lower than on private servers so we don't really know yet how viable or optimal a MT druid would be.
---
Your post has right reasoning but some wrong assumptions and the result was mongering druids unviability. I hope you didn't just lower community perception before anything was really confirmed
---
Great perspective. Should also note that all the time you’re spending playing WoW, you won’t be spending money on other entertainment or unnecessary things. You’ll be saying tons of money overall.
---
No dual spec, and I do not think a large part of the community is hoping to get it. Most people seem to be no changes, at least at first.
---
Why is that confusing for you?
---
no yea i get what you mean totally. But sill, at lvl 30? I dont have by memory how much of the kit every class has. But its not balanced for duels at 60, so Im not sure if it is as 30. My point was just that a tournament doesnt really make sense, centered around inherently unbalanced gameplay of classes, in regards to pvp. And I think we can all agree that the classes arent mean to be balanced well around each other
---
You forgot to add that private servers also have bosses on a higher difficulty with dmg done, health etc very often to make the raids harder and a druid could still tank it.
---
They did not in Vanilla.  Game purchase plus sub no other monetization.
---
Most of us think the purchased mounts, gold, pets take away from the point of earning such things.  I'd rather a sub then ingame shop for MMO.
---
Definitely not.
---
The level 40 mount is 100% free
---
My Vanilla memory (which could be wrong) was that if you camped in an instance you were TP back where your bind is.
---
When I was farming SM with my lvl 60 warrior, I remember running back at the entrance of the instance, exit, right click on my char portrait and select "reset all instances" then go back in a new instance.
---
I always assumed the macro I saw on forums was a pserver inaccuracy.
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half
---
I had an unarmored mount in classic and it's one of the things that really trigger the nostalgia for me. Even on retail, it's the only mount I ever use despite having a lot of other rare mounts.
---
I think it destroys a lot of the feel of classic without them, at least for me.
---
Nah.
---
**Razorgore** is incredibly easy. The difficulty of the fight is Phase 1 where you need to coordinate DPS in all 4 corners. The mobs themselves dont hit for much so you can tank P1 and P2 just fine.
---
**Vaelastrasz** is the boss where having a Druid is optimal over a Warrior. With infinite Rage, Energy and Mana you need a really high threat ceiling to kill the boss fast. The boss also makes random people explode every 20 seconds or so. You really want the boss dead fast to not waste world buffs and consumes. With infinite mana there is no issue keeping a tank alive.
---
**Broodlord** is another boss where Druids do fine. With higher straight up physical damage mitigation and health they can survive the damage done by the boss. Mortal Strike cannot crit. The boss also has a threat reduction on knockback so once again the superior threat of a Druid tank shine.
---
**Firemaw** is a pure resistance fight with a taunt swap mechanic. It doesnt really matter who tanks this. It's far more important that your tanks for this fight can communicate and position themselves correctly.
---
**Ebonroc** hits like a wet noodle. This boss is all about taunting to prevent the boss from hitting a tank with the Shadow of Ebonroc debuff. Any tank can do this.
---
**Flamegor** also does practically no damage. Like Ebonroc the only requirement is that offtanks can hit taunt to take the Wing Buffet. Doesnt matter who tanks this.
---
**Chromaggus** is a boss that requires two tanks only. A guild need 3 tanks for any raid which means no matter what you will have two other Warriors there that can handle this. Druids cannot use Hourglass Sand in Bearform, and they have no Def stance for sub 20% when the boss Enrage. Let your Warriors handle this and either DPS as cat or decurse.
---
**Nefarian** requires 3 tanks. Two on each side for Phase 1 and one for Nefarian itself for Phase 2. As a Druid you will be tanking either the left or right entrance along with the Maintank, while the second Warrior tank the other side. The trash dont do much damage and you can tank them in mostly DPS gear. Once Phase 2 starts and the Maintank leave to pick up the boss landing, you will stay at the entrance until the adds stop spawning and then either DPS for Phase 2 or help out decursing or healing.
---
yes, but only in raids.  
---
Loot is a bit of a trust-issue anyways, raidleaders can set masterloot a few seconds before a boss is killed and do as they like with the loot.
---
ye just need on everything and then sell it after.
---
damn
---
I like slicing stuff at that low of a leveling. People barely know mechanics
---
That comparison holds very little weight, it's tough to say what's going to happen, and how much longetivity there will be. 
---
For some reason, the "haha classics gonna blow up retail" narrative is as annoying to me as "its all nostalgia"
---
Yeah they really need an actual level squish in retail. Shit, they should have just kept level cap 60 and kept the level process the same except making new gear better. At least that way you can get friends to boost you once you hit 60. 
---
That's what they need to do for retail, at least. We'll see what happens with classic.
---
is this on pserver?
---
Actually, 1.12 was a boon for gold making, as it introduced the ability to get extra gold from quests at max level. 
---
When that happened, I was able to farm the last 500g I needed for my epic mount quest as a Paladin, in a week.
---
Yes gold takes longer to get, but you also realize inflation isn’t a thing in vanilla. You don’t have people with millions of gold.
---
Depends a bit on where you live though. I have people from like Bulgaria and Romania in my guild and 13€ is considerably more for them than it is for the Norwegians in our guild for example. 
---
Average monthly salary Bulgaria: 500€
---
Average monthly salary Norway: 3500€
---
And that's after taxes.
---
Guess I should of defined old, that's my fault. I haven't really run into too many games that can't be worked around fairly easily if there is a soft or hard cap in place, but I could see a problem if the games go back too far, date wise.
---
Raids in 1.12 compared to earlier patched were ez mode except 2-3 bosses in aq40 and in naxx.
---
Naxx is usually cleared day 1 on pservers. And they often have higher difficulty to bosses to make it harder.
---
Druids will be able to tank without any big issues in 1.12
---
do people not know this meme, or was it just that unfunny? lol
---
I didnt hack 7 years ago. Im pretty new to hacking. I did it because everyone else did. I got eventually all my chars max lvl. I got all classes at max lvl.
---
But Im done with arguing. Like I said when you see botter report him and add him to friendlist. He will be gone maybe next year because this is how banwave works.
---
That is quite minimal loss compared how much irl cash he got during that time. Nobody gives shit if he gets banned when you have several other accounts you botted max lvl meanwhile.
---
why would you D/E if people want the gear?
---
I acutally work in accounting. I know what im doing!
---
As soon as I finish wanking, I always think "ok all clear headed to keep pla- damn it!"
---
I explained to a friend like ten years ago. Humans benefit from mutual gain and help each other.
---
God damn idiot went off telling others I said humans use each other and not to trust me because all I do is use others. Moron.
---
So what’s y’all a decision on stuff like this? Where something wasn’t in Vanilla until the end? Both aspects were in during Vanilla so how do you choose which one?
---
The one that was there the longest? Or the one that was there at the end?
---
Solid job 🤑🤑🤑
---
because this wasn't possible, retail mop baby.
---
I have been doing housework nonstop. Painting, trim, cleaning gutters, power washing. Getting my house in tiptop shape before I gain 100 lb and become a lazy shit.
---
thats it!!!
---
If I'm grinding to 60 but doing mining/engineering, should I just save the mining resources on an alt then do 1-300 engineering at 60 or should I level it as I level my character?
---
I'd say 50% of the top twitch streamers are always comparing pserver to classic, like it has any merit to stand on.
---
You've been helpful already I appreciate it. Yea starting out as a hobby first is what I'll be doing too.
---
Can you imagine how many players would come BACK if those systems you mentioned were removed? 
---
I'd maybe even give it a shot myself.
---
Here we go. 
---
No more “vanilla isn’t what you remember”
---
Now we have arrived at the “TBC isn’t what you remember” post coming.
---
Warrior isn’t too bad. On the beta it’s been going a lot faster than on pservers. You’ll be fine, just keep your head down until 30 and get your axe. It’s all downhill from there. If you can make it to 40 you’ll coast right on through 60. I think it’s easier to make friends than dual box, but it’s possible to do it and the pair isn’t terrible. If you type in the zone channels you should have no problem finding buddies to quest with - most casters would love a tank for questing.
---
Felwood, blasted lands, deadwind pass or Desolace. Take your pick, they are all fairly ugly. Burning steppes isn't much better but atleast it has some cool mobs.
---
You don't get to have both you wanted classic you've got classic
---
Amen bro. Get the house in perfect condition
---
They did actually.   They started selling server xfers during vanilla.
---
I've seen people do lock/pally combos where the locks send out their pets to aggro a bunch of mobs, then the locks hellfire while the pallys spam heals.
---
Because things like free action potions and similar consumables are too impactful and. would destroy the whole dueling experience. There is a reason why this ruleset evolved in roughly this form over 13 years of private server dueling tournaments.
---
Comparing sure. But I've never seen a single person ever say "this is wrong because of pserver." Nobody ever has. You just made it up
---
Yeah I think its unhealthy for the game. As a main PvP'er I dont like the current system and its very annoying. And PvE'ers just wanna stomp people in PvP with superior gear is not a rewarding, its just dumb.. why would you want this? Where is the value of PvP? Its not sportsmanship like and only serves a dominant majority, who just want this for free. You can still reward people with gear that is good in world pvp and balanced with pve gear. It just would not have the résistance buffs needed for PvE raids. 
---
Yeah I do want to add Transmog. I think if items are still hard to get, it doesn't matter. 
---
I am holding true to core concept of Vanilla.. 
---
Vanilla is very competitive and raiding requires commitment... The competitiveness gets relieved by the fact that if you put in the time.. you prob have the same things.
---
&gt; **#NoChanges but**
---
I believe blizzard that the beta values are the correct 1.12 values, but I also think this will not deliver the “real” classic experience. 
---
80% of Vanille Vets did not join st 1.12 but earlier. If I think back, I remember getting thrown around like the little bitch of a tank I was, from DM to Scholo. 
---
Dungeons should primarily deliver the authentic EXPERIENCE. NOT the authentic numbers of the 1.12 client. 
---
The damage values were different, specifically for newer players to catch up before TBC launches. But TBC is not considered right now + we all grew up &amp; know or understand the mechanics better. 
---
I really hope Blizzard reconsiders “‘micro changes” like this. 
---
Retail holds our hands through dungeons already, I don’t want to build mental sandcastles while going through classic dungeons too.
---
Yes. I also play a Druid tank named Gammarays.
---
He plays on private servers but he was popular in Vanilla for being a Druid Tank in Naxx. He's like the top 1% of Feral Druids. 
---
If you want to tank on a Druid you can do more than half of the available content if you're good and your guild supports you. 
---
5-10 man's can be your thing and you can make a name for yourself on your server as a good tank running them, then you may get a few spots in MC, Ony, BWL, AQ 20 for some fights, but even if you're the best Druid Tank in the world, you will be healing on a lot of fights in raids.
---
Wasted 120k gold subbing again this month and felt like a wasted it. Its so disheartening to come back the SAME expansion with leaving off in mythic RAID GEAR and seeing peoples fresh alts with hugely better questing (dailies) gear than your raid gear that took far more dedication and commitment to get than just saving the turtles.
---
Hell yeah I want a beta. Screw those streamers!
---
As much as I enjoyed BC I still feel that flying was a major mistake
---
How can you prove a buyer from someone receiving gold from a friend or guildie
---
I always said wrath was my favorite because sh*t wasn’t easy but it wasn’t totally hard either.
---
Unreleased? I already played Vanilla &gt;.&gt;
---
Nah. Flasks will be for the main tank in hard progression encounters. Just bring food buffs and normal pots and you’ll be ok.
---
Wouldn't the community being a thing stop this kind of bulshit from happening? Wouldn't somebody who did that quickly get a bad reputation
---
Could I raise awareness of cropping images or that would be rude of me ? :p
---
Jeepers
---
Because we’ve had 15 years to optimize gold farming, if things like this are allowed to go unchecked the economy will take a hit. And that doesn’t even factor in the exploits of layering. 
---
I definitely agree leaving quick exit bugs like this will result in massive gold influx into servers
---
The mods in this Reddit pick and choose what to censor.
---
You’ll have a ton of fun as Druid as long as you don’t mind tanking/healing dungeons. I know you can level as a feral spec and just use int gear to heal up until the 40’s so it will be pretty easy for you to find groups.
---
Ok. Oh noes, three times I have been banned on Reddit so I dare not even hint at a private server.
---
Oh my god stop being such a whiny little bitch. OP made a viable point. 
---
This subreddit evolved into such a hateful place I hope the actual community turns out different bc at this point the community feels like retail incels.
---
I base my game purchases on the principal that for every dollar I spend, I should get one hour of entertainment. At $15/month that's a good deal for me. 
---
Plus, I like having a sub to keep the riff-raff out. It's not like $15/month is breaking the bank, and if it is, then you've got bigger things to worry about.
---
'a good loot council' your assumption that the majority of players would be unbiased and fair is very naive.
---
In a 40man environment there will be assholes you don't get along with and people who try get power over others on the net are most of the times the worst of the bunch.
---
Link other thread please
---
Everything is just "oh it's hivemind circlejerk" to you so there cannot be a valid discussion here. That's probably the most irritating millenial saying I've encountered to date. It makes you think you're right, and that because a bunch of people disagree with you "oh, it's just a hivemind circlejerk!" Okay buddy.
---
You're also deciding what it is I want and what I think is okay, as well as everyone else. It's fine to have personal opinions and stuff dude, I just think you sound a hell of a lot more "circlejerky" than many around here. You're telling me to relax when you're all fucking riled up lol. I can hear the keyboard buttons for here.
---
It's extremely simple. If you don't think the subscription is worth it, then don't subscribe. If you do, then do. I am fine with what I paid before, despite you saying I'm not or whatever. I didn't expect anything different.
---
If you want to complain about corporate greed and what companies are charging for games, then that's the greatest circlejerk in existence on reddit. Plenty of platforms to do that on dude, and you're just jeeerking away into the wind, lol.
---
Meanwhile it's okay to pay more for retail because it's more up to date and has more people working on it, but it's fucking garbage. You make absolutely no sense.
---
Anyways, make another one of your quoted lists if you wish, everyone always loves those /s
---
The page quite clearly states that it supports [Real Mob Health](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24924-RealMobHealth.html).
---
Your aware melee is a significant part of playing hunter
---
Jesus Christ, so much text, so much theorycrafting, all for a game that people beat 15 years ago with shitty internet, horrible PCs and sub-optimal tactics. News flash, the stats on private servers are completely random. Elites hit **way** harder, than they actually did, otherwise they would be stupidly easy to handle. Either way, if you need an absolute perfect team composition to complete the raids, I feel sorry for you. 
---
Personally I'll welcome any race/class/spec combo and have a blast finishing these old raids that barely require any tactics.
---
That's too bad, would've enjoyed running enhance/resto dual specs. Don't know why I'm being down voted for asking.
---
You can not replicate being shit at the game. That’s the only reason vanilla was “hard”
---
It will affect you either way though. It only takes a handful of people who farm day-in-day-our to kick off economy inflation.
---
Where can you find that data, if you don’t mind?
---
you can blame the fact that any reasonable change gets shouted down by the no changes crowd but suddenly when they feel something is off it's all this should be change
---
Some more warlock pros. 
---
PVE/PVP/Farm is the same spec so no need to re spec 
---
Amazing dps in later raids 
---
Aside from 4 min fights in a raid you do once a week you won’t be reduced to spamming SB. 
---
Huge array of utility more than any class considering curses/summons/stones/infinite mana/soul stone/fears etc 
---
Above average farming speed
---
Cons 
---
Soul shards 
---
That’s really the only downside of playing a lock.
---
Yup, absolutely agree with you. 
---
As long as the changes come from any patch of the Vanilla Version I’m fine. 
---
I heard streamers &amp; players say Elite Mobs are a joke &amp; dungeons feel boring. Why keep a bad mechanic if we can get a good one?
---
/r/hedidthemath
---
Go outside?
---
Why would a guild bring a tank just for trash tho?
---
I can see prot paladin maybe in naxx on 4 horsemen.
---
Yea definitely classsic feel but better class balance. Better pvp and the best raids in the game imo.
---
True, but at the same time casual guilds are more likely to choose a non-optimal class over an optimal one if it can help them defeat the raid attendance boss.
---
Yes and that’s what is going to fuck people over who aren’t used to the community impact
---
This is an absolutely wonderful idea. I thought I would just post my info and not find anyone I knew but I searched my old server (Hyjal) and found a friend I never would have dreamed of contacting again.
---
Arms was universally known to be the best DPS in mc, so uh, yea...
---
I'm in the UK and coming off the back of EQ, then DAoC, WoW wasn't seen as expensive at the time at all. You got three months free and continuing with three or six month subscriptions was considered pretty good value for what you got
---
Is everyone in North America making 30% more?
---
As an experienced rogue main and classlead, I can assure you that statement is false.
---
OP bases his whole point on a ton of bad assumptions, and then covers it up with ass tons of math that make it seem more legit. Everything in his post is either factually wrong, or something the druid community already knows and has been found to be negligible (see: dRuIDs gEt CrUsHeD)
---
You wouldn't - that's kinda his point.  Once people have the gear they need though, you start to DE.
---
So you bring new people in through your on-farm raids but since they don't have any raiding gear, they get pretty much everything that drops and you end up not DEing as much!
---
Can you imagine if J. Allen Brack turned around and said sure, we’ll make classic servers for you guys? I bet he feels well shit watching the whole Beta server worship Omar instead lol
---
Orcs are so beautiful and intelligent though
---
It's pretty cool if you feel like flying around just to check out flying in Kolimdor and Eastern Kingdoms.
---
Then you say: "My god, they ruined this game." then log out feeling depressed.
---
From my experience it means a good old boy system where the friends and top performers get all the good stuff and people will expect you to put in maximum effort for the scraps.
---
&gt; All the defensive plate gear is slathered in str and completely missing regen or int. 
---
its sad that you can see how blizz attempted to leave hints that prot paladins shouldnt bother so much with defense rating, but then failed to give proper int tanking gear.
---
its said that gear just never came around to allow prot paladins to capitalize
---
That has not been my experience, but I've always run in guilds that were adults only and kicked players who started drama or didn't get along with others.
---
I pressed the button on the left ...but don't worry; all I do is level up and transmog alts, so it's all good. lol
---
I literally still ride one on Retail in 2019. It's not like they were "gone". This whole argument specious at best because you know what also is long gone? WoW Vanilla. But here we are.
---
They're part of the Vanilla feel and nostalgia. They should be there.
---
Potential max dps after clearing 1-3 times
---
Same. But things aren’t the way they were in 2004, everything is streamlined now. Best leveling paths. Best weapon progression lists. Much easier to be efficient now and that will lead to many more players having alts. I’m able to level to 20 on beta in under 10 hours. I remember leveling for the first time, it felt like it took weeks to get there. Mainly from just exploring and being clueless.
---
These warriors and rouges will be sad when they figure out the parry chance on the boss will be double what it was in vanilla.
---
Low levels dungeons should be harder imo, agreed
---
Middle class wages haven’t gone up too much, but minimum wage in my state have practically doubled, at least.
---
did you even read the thread?

A rogue specific addon you'll want is an energy timer. EnergyWatch was what it was called in vanilla. Just a bar that tells you when your +20 energy ticks will occur. Very handy for setting up hurst attacks. If you use your opener when the bar is 90% full then you get the +20 right after you attack allowing you to use more skills faster.
---
Release of classic is first step towards TBC and i also think that TBC is very well done. For example paladin have taunt and also is very good (best?) AoE tank. Both factions have all classes available - altho like always horde gets better version of paladin. So in short - things are kind of balanced and also theres Arenas :D
---
Crossrealm was in Vanilla though
---
There's a video of a streamer flying over Arathi Highlands. The place is barely recognizable. Someone mentioned Teldrassil burned down. I don't even want to see what the rest of the world looks like.
---
I think you will have to buy it to play Classic
---
No,that's wrong.
---
Any half decent healer will use downranked spell for minor damage healing.
---
He gets seduced and a shadowbolt hits him but he is still seduced.  I’m not sure why he thinks the timing is off this is literally working exactly as intended.
---
Druids with 1.12 balance changes are light years ahead of druids in the first part of OG vanilla. He’ll be fine.
---
It'll show on your account page on the Blizzard site the second you have it. That's how I saw that I got stress test access while still at work.
---
I[ndeed, someone else remembered too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bv8uzg/i_suddenly_remembered_this_classic_hobss_this_is/)
---
okay, that clears things up. I thought somehow people could use shield block to never be crit or crushed, but you basically would use it as a response
---
I mean anyone who thinks that is okay is a complete scumbag anyways and should be completely ostracized from the community because I thought that was exactly the sort of thing people want to get away fro
---
Omar, save me from the dreamers.
---
It's 3 months until launch, you don't need the list.
---
As an experienced rogue main and guild leader, I can assure you that statement is true.
---
&gt;  \[..\]I started personally botting around pandaria and I used honorbuddy 2 years without ever getting banned. I botted myself\[..\]
---
You just said you hacked in pandaria?
---
&gt;  I did it because everyone else did. 
---
That's a lousy justification.
---
&gt; He will be gone maybe next year because this is how banwave works. 
---
Yes and I tried to explain to you why that is but you did not seem interested in listening.
---
What I find weird is that you were a botter and you still complain about other botters. And then you complain on GMs when you have been part of the problem. That is such double standard.
---
Very serious guilds will all be using loot council effectively, casual guilds on the other hand would only misuse it and should, imo, use dkp instead. Im not joining a casual raiding guild using loot council unless i know the people well atleast.
---
Could you suggest one? Im still trying to figure out what I want to play. Also, I'd rather it not be PvP as it's already established and would prefer not to get ganked
---
Did you colon ever try to tap out?
---
I tried leveling/playing in BfA again, it's stupid.  Turned off of it immediately, I get disgusted by it so fast.  Just knowing there's a point where I have to do Cata, MoP, and WoD again killed any and all ambition to play along with the stupidly easy leveling.  My right button is worn out at this point.
---
What is this parry mechanic - when the boss parries a tank shot what happens?
---
LOL. Druids are top tier levelers, with almost no downtime, stealth for skipping quests and choosing PvP encounters, excellent mobility, and the ability to fill any role in any group quest of dungeon.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvtcp0/can_you_be_a_hardcore_druid_tank/
---
Someone ban this guy he just said the p word stone him now
---
The three piece set that drops during the event is free BIS for some specs. Easy gearing for naxx.
---
Lol #nochangesbutmaybealittle
---
I'm saying we were disenchanting stuff nobody could use, like tier 1 gear when everyone already has it or better.
---
&gt;which is why classic is just not going to be as good as vanilla.
---
That's subjective. Personally I dont think there's anything "Better" about progressing up until Huhuran only to discover you have to spend 3 weeks farming NR get to progress further.
---
I assume the list will be out before august 13th, which is when we can reserve our characters. Even if the servers are released on the 12th its not very hard to pick one and decide on your group
---
Paladins should be able to use staves and daggers
---
Because blizzard servers are stable and my character won’t be gone tomorrow if the server shuts down. I think you’d be surprised how many people just want to play vanilla. I have 10 character slots per server. That’s a lot of content.
---
Honestly, I don't care anymore who does the beta as long as the bugs are found and fixed they can give beta access exclusively to nazi war criminals.
---
My only objections were to the way they used the beta for financial gain, and I will openly admit that I was naive to not first consider they would try to profit from the beta after they charged $50 for access to the demo.  (And don't insult me with the "but.. but... the digital blizzcon pass!" arguments, if people buy a combination spoon and heroin for $50 you know they're not paying because spoons are so hard to get)
---
I'm actually thinking about warrior or healer myself, and the two things scaring me away from warrior are
---
1) some items that are really good for warrior need insane time investment in PvP. Not necessarily the bis items, but still, if you can't get the drops, these are important.
---
2) everyone plays warrior. Not everyone will be down to tank a dungeon, but even if they aren't, they will come to the dungeon for the same gear as you...
---
Healing is alright fun, but I've healed a lot over the years. I'm scared of putting all my eggs in a DPS basket mostly because it can take so long to get groups.
---
Star seeker mount is more than Overwatch that’s saying something
---
Fwiw it’s worth I own both just saying
---
For a time it was nice feature and also as it was expensive (epic was 5000) it become prominent not until into late expansion. But yeah in retrospect it kind of ruined the game.
---
A DKP system, however, discourages players from taking that 1% item because it costs them DKP they could later use on a 10% item.
---
There's no question in my mind, though that Loot Council is best for cutting-edge raiding guilds.  But you better have a damn good, trustworthy council - if there's favoritism beyond what is justified by the guild's progression, that reflects poorly and will irritate guildies.  The best bet is to write down loot rules for the council, post them somewhere, and STICK to them.
---
That's the thing, I'm not a gamer. Resident Evil 2 was an amazing and nostalgic journey back to my childhood but you can only speedrun it so many times. Guess I'll keep hitting the gym and concern myself with my career, house, lawn, and Monster Zero Energy drinks until launch.
---
Which is exactly the reason I will roll on an RP-PvP if one is available.
---
No. You just need an account.
---
It’s worth buying the best water you can afford from the vendor.
---
You are wrong. American purchasing power has been almost stagnant since 2004.
---
https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/
---
Blizzard have stated they will disable loot sharing in 5 mans though, so only raids are affected, who will be using master loot anyway.
---
Apparently it doesn't allowed special characters in names?  
---
When I try my name "Básh" it says "only letters/no spaces".
---
Well, no, like I said the values changed over time. 
---
The tweaked the dungeons in 1.12. They made them easier.
---
not sayin this is spot on but i played a pserver for the first time 2 yrs ago lvld a warr mostly solo and i didnt have any routes and i did wpvp and lvld mining and eng. i dinged 60 around 7 1/2 days. now ill be playing a lock and I think i can do it in 6
---
Lol you can’t get parried if you’re standing behind a boss. 
---
Also the hit cap will be lowering in Classic so rogues and fury’s will be doing even more damage.
---
The same, actually: Performance. There is no law that prohibits you to perform subpar in PvP.
---
You just said you wanted to pay $15 a month.   No one interested in an intellectually honest discourse would say that.
---
&gt; PvE'ers just wanna stomp people in PvP with superior gear is not a rewarding, its just dumb.. why would you want this? Where is the value of PvP?
---
its not about PvE vs PvP. its about one consistent world where everything you are, wear and do has an impact and not to feel differently in different contexts. for me gearing up in PvP was a HUGE motivator cause i felt my char progress and getting stronger. and btw noone needs resistance gear to farm anything.
---
&gt; I am holding true to core concept of Vanilla.. Vanilla is very competitive
---
another HUGE contradiction in my book. Vanilla wasnt competitive, it just was immersive, tedious and time-consuming. Even the Honor System was purely a measure of time spent grinding, 0 amount of skill was involved.
---
"  Taking that into consideration, we’ve decided that the two-hour loot trading system in WoW Classic will only apply to soulbound gear that drops in raids. Soulbound loot that drops in five-person content will not be tradeable at any time.  "
---
Thank you, you the real MVP!
---
I played vanilla 2004-2007 and these unarmored epic mounts were exceptionally rare in vanilla. I dinged 60 in February 2005 and only remember a paltry few on Blackhand, a launch realm.
---
All wrong...
---
We don't need a list yet
---
DKP definetely works and it is fairly transparent, but it's not flawless. You can make some adjustments to it like award DKP according to your performance, consumable bonuses etc, but it still does not solve the inherent issue of DKP stacking, players hoping that somebody else would spend their DKP on shit items etc.  
---
The main difference between DKP and LC is in the approach. DKP works towards personal progression while LC works for the progression of the whole raid as a single entity. 
---
This means that in LC guild you are much less likely to loot Axes as a human warrior and vice versa - if you are, let's say a gnome warrior then it's not very probable that you will be getting swords any time soon. It's just a small example but these class/race optimizations go a long way, like Robe of Volatile Power (which is a 100% caster item on the first sight) goes to the paladins because crit is crazy good for them and you want powerful tank healers first.
---
"#nochanges but" is a viable point?
---
I just hide my powerlevel entirely, all my coworkers think I'm a massive normie but little do they know I'm always silently judging their casual asses as they talk about gaming and other "nerd" stuff while I pretend like they are speaking a foreign language.
---
Adding this wouldn’t take anything away from the spirit of classic, why be against this?
---
That's unexpected, I got it from a thread of people saying that it worked for them.
---
I can definitely agree with that. 0 chance of a warrior or priest winning this contest. 
---
However, I don’t think balance makes competition have more of a point, or become more fun. Perfect balance in WoW sounds SUPER boring. I loved games like Dota for embracing their ridiculous approach to balance (at least they used to, haven’t played in years). People ALWAYS learn to play around their limitations, that can make for the biggest surprises and most entertaining moment.
---
Ultimately, this isn’t an Olympic sport, it’s a bunch of streamer duels on the classic beta. It won’t be perfectly balanced, but the prize pool will make people try their best, and I think it would be way more of a shame if we left this lvl 30 meta without ever having some competitive PvP to point to when we reflect back on this meta in the future.
---
4 seconds for me.
---
Haha, oops. The clip is the longest they allow, and I assume people would just click "what full video" if they didn't see that by the time it cuts he is above he water. :P
---
 Correction sir, Big Macs are 2 for $5.00 equaling an astonishing $2.50 for each sandwich. Poof.
---
Yes it is. For example, robe of the archmage was not something people considered back in vanilla, today, everyone is going to farm it. 
---
We have a lot more knowledge today.
---
Okay buddy. Well I for one am glad I won't be seeing you in classic. Go have fun circlejerking every thread you find. 15 bucks, whaoaoAho.. blizzaaaard!
---
I agree.
---
There's no common sense in asking for something and then complaining it sucks when it's finally given to you.
---
Common sense would be providing reasonable feedback to improve/tune it.
---
Will the game require a gaming pc to run? Or will the requirements be simular to back in 2004?
---
Can someone explain about Engineering for me, I get to choose one between Gnomish or Goblin? Is this faction specific or I get to choose? Which is better?
---
Trust me, you don't need to be a "gamer" to play other games than wow, but yea I would definitely focus on the things you mentioned, except try the Rockstar pure zero watermelon if you haven't already, it's tasty.
---
A player or group of players decides who gets the loot that drops.  A "council" if you will.
---
In theory, they emphasize getting gear into the hands of folks who'll make the biggest difference in the guild's progression.
---
Also, believe the loot trading does not affect UBRS.
---
With a max level paladin, should I have different gear sets for solo and group play?
---
I’ll be so excited to take the shit I’ve been holding in for 5 days.
---
Brilliant
---
I would certainly like one 
---
but need is the wrong word
---
Dude....
---
Just don’t play?
---
You must be a shitty Druid
---
I would read them in this order (I would only list novels, games and select short storys and comics):
---
\- Rise of the Horde.
---
\- The last Guardian (and for a more complete experience you could also play the original warcraft and do the missions in this order:  human 1, orc 1,  orc 2, orc 3, human 2, human 3, human 4, human 5, orc 4, orc 5, orc 6, human 6, human 7, human 8, human 9, orc 7, orc 8, orc 9, orc 10, orc 11, orc 12, human 10, human 11, human 12, the last one losing it ).
---
\- Tides of Darkness (in this one I recommend the novel, the end of the game is not exactly canon)
---
\- Beyond the Dark Portal (the same as above)
---
\- Day of the Dragon
---
\- Lord of the clans
---
\- Of blood and honor (Tirion and Eitrigg short Story)
---
\- Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos
---
\- First half of Ashbringer comic happens here, The last part happens at the end of vanilla wow.
---
\- Warcraft 3: The frozen Throne (I recommend games above Arthas novel, as the novel is centered on Arthas and cover events posteriors to World of Warcraft, TBC and WoTLK Launch).
---
\- Sunwell Trilogy manga
---
\- Cycle of Hatred
---
\- War of the Ancients trilogy (the beginnig of this one happens before or during Vanilla wow, some say it happens even before Cycle of hatred, whereas others say it happens during Vanilla wow, so i put it here).
---
Apart from that my recomendation is to not read anythig from Chronicles. Retcons abound in those three books, and some of them are very bad retcons.
---
Apparently you have no idea how Druids work lmao
---
I completely agree, however this was also when they started to make classes to much the same.
---
I heard if you post "PRIVATE SERVER, PRIVATE SERVER, PRIVATE SERVER!" a mod will crawl out of your screen and shank you with a dagger sized replica of frostmourne.
---
no butt changes !
---
I saw this too, I never knew about it back in the day, but I know there are quests in there for alliance levelling in Darkshore after the cata revamp so I recognised it. I saw the dancing trolls were Horde pvp marked, so I guess they would be hostile to alliance right? I wasn't sure how that interaction would work considering they all seemed yellow.
---
From what I've read, level 40 is usually the good switching point. Its when you need the gold to buy your mount, and the really useful engineering recipes all require mithral anyway.
---
yeah either could be true but im definitely with you kn this one. i was 8 when i was playing my huntard. now that i how the fuck to do things and pvp way better and so on itll be a blast.
---
Not really. Have someone designated to choose one the moment the list is released, that person chooses the server and posts it to the group, and bam there you go.
---
they really shouldn't
---
Wait, we can reserve a character? How does that work?
---
Yeah, even regular flying was slower and more expensive than epic ground mounts. Getting enough gold for epic flying was a feat in and of itself. 
---
Although epic flying was arguably too fast. I think it may have been better balance to only have regular speed, 60%, flying. Keep 100% ground still be the fastest.
---
Im recent botter in sense that I didnt do it before pandaria. I have botter couple years and stopped because I stopped playing game. I got fed up that bots gather 24 hours everyday without being infront cpu on multiple accounts.
---
For me it was eather quit game or bot to compete with bots because GMs dont give a fuck and I was 100% right about that. 
---
I would been extremely happy if they banned me. If I complained about being banned only then I would be hypocrite. But nope I can still log to my account which has no warnings. 
---
Answer me this why there is gold spam every 2 seconds in general chat if you think gms did their job? Also do you understand what ban wave means? It means you can bot 1-2 year before getting banned with wave.
---
Right, and wasn’t seeing one cool and part of the experience? At least it was for me.
---
TBC had resilience and arena and it began the forced effeminization of the horde in the forms of bloodelves. Almost no horde player wanted bloodelves. We were forced to group with them because they had paladins. I think you could also say that the blood elf/draeni addition with shamans and paladins was also the start of removing what made one faction unique from the other
---
And if you have a competent raid leader and guild then you shouldn’t be worried in the slightest.
---
Every guild I did MC/BWL ran master loot and did DKP with zero issues. Transparency with DKP solves a lot of trust issue issues.
---
very true.  the best parts of vanilla for me were the exploring the open world, discovering new friends to play with, and figuring out the new small scale content that was released.  If this sub is any indication, there is absolutely nothing new to discover that isn't already in a guide, or spreadsheet and mathed to perfect oblivion.  kinda sad, but still glad my work schedule has me starting a week off Aug 26 :)
---
Dwarf hunter is very common in Azeroth, even in the cinematics everytime you see a hunter you'll see him as a hunter (vanilla intro, bfa cinematic, etc).
---
Hunter is very good in t1 raids, at least on par with mages and possibly even slightly above locks. They do fall behind in later tiers though.
---
I think your point is fundamentally flawed. Druids are less survivable than warriors. This is a fact. It was a thing in vanilla, it's a thing on private servers, it will be a thing in classic. BUT! Just because the druid will take more overall damage does not mean they won't be able to tank. Since they will be able to tank, the increased threat is most definitely relevant. Even if you swap in an extra healer or two just to help babysit the druid (although I doubt this will be necessary), that's a raid dps increase because ALL the dps can do more damage.
---
More content that includes me having to actually use my class/strategy/group Dynamics the better I say. That's what classic was good at. If we are speeding through dungeons that stops all of that. I enjoy a good crawl.
---
The hit gap will not be lowered. If tanks have a harder time hitting and melee has an easier time it would be impossible to hold aggro.
---
I’ve been thinking a lot about this as well. I also haven’t come up with a way to do the reward structure that would allow new content within classic
---
Venezuela for example has a minimum wage of around 11 USD and there's tons of other examples of Countrys with broken economys like that.
---
People tend to forget that beeing born and raised in a First world Country is a blessing and not a privilege.
---
Twitch viewership = subs = money, so I would guess that Soda/Asmon care at least
---
He was just making a point that soda is taking this super seriously at the expense of some irl income
---
Is this really that much faster than taking off gear and dying?
---
Hunters are mid to bottom tier dps throughout vanilla. They fall off really hard in AQ and their dps becomes nonexistent in Naxx.
---
Whoever thinks Shamans and Paladins were useless are pretty terrible at tryharding.
---
Does anyone know (or have a link if it’s already been discussed) if threat and threat generation is going to be any different than what it is on private servers or are the numbers pretty much the same for both?
---
it's fun every 10th person you fight where you get a wf proc, 9/10 times you're just useless and can't do anything but die.
---
Snutz to take it out. Looking forward to watching! Is there someones POV who will be commentating the duels?
---
the reason mages make good money doing it is beacuse they can kill it very fast
---
You need certain fish for several important potions, so it can definitely be viable
---
You fail to take account of a warrior weapon speed though.
---
&gt; Taladril make those calculations, and Druid's Maul will hit every 1.66 seconds 
---
Some tanks use the epic BOE dagger that has 1.3 speed and fire resist. 
---
From my foggy Vanilla memories, I remember that I liked fast weapons because a miss wasn't a big thing. If you miss with a slow weapon, you have to wait more than 2s before the next hit that could be a miss too, meanwhile your DPS are sending in all they got !
---
So if parry-haste is such a big problem, should warriors stack 8% +HIT (at the expense of +DEF) and go with the slowest main hand they can find ?
---
Uh yeah when by the time 1.12 came out many aspects didn’t feel like Vanilla anymore. This highlights how stupid the no changes movement is. They want no changes but they are fine with changes that dumbed the game down before TBC released. It’s hypocritical. Do you want a game that feels like vanilla or not?
---
30mb/s is data usage not seconds
---
I used a calculator I found online. 420 days will it take me to reach lvl 60 with me playing 4h/week on average. And that’s still best case scenario.
---
I laughed too hard at this
---
So if they're all wrong what's right then?  Or are you just here to troll and flame
---
Whats the point of making a new thread on this? You already had all your arguments dismantled in the other thread on Druid tanks. The only purpose of this thread to way I see it so to keep spreading your misinformation in an attempt to avoid any criticism against your points from the other thread.
---
Overall TBC has the best balance, but it had its own problems as well. 
---
I played TBC more than any other so I’m sure I have some nostalgia goggles on.
---
That is kinds dependant on how Blizzard handle fish botters.
---
Post this in their beta forums so devs can see ASAP
---
Yeah but if they’re not going to be available in perpetuity, they become common. Would you argue they launch with classic and then get pulled a little later as they were in vanilla ?
---
OP is in Highschool still.

---
Staysafe said he's going there as an Ally and will be commentating. I bet Tapsout will stream and commentate it too.
---
Anyway rogues can't use axes in Vanilla, so the +5 Axes is useless for them.
---
It happens dw!
---
Yes. The fact that a 5 man group of lvl 30s can clear SM cathedral and kill a lvl 42 elite boss is ABSURD. 
---
And was DEFINITELY not a thing when I played classic (been there from launch). 
---
What’s even more absurd are these people here in this sub, who want to rather fuck classic up then admit to a bad aspect of the game as it is right now. 
---
Although changing this, it wouldn’t even violate #NoChanges since it would still be within the original Vanilla spectrum. 
---
Can’t wait for Classic to finally drop so I can leave this subreddit &amp; anti social mommies basement incels behind.
---
This is something we talked about a lot before we knew what Blizz decided to do. If they're going with 1.12 itemization and talents, the early content needs to be adjusted to maintain the same challenge it would have been earlier on.
---
I just joined a guild that is 100% preparation for Classic launch. &lt;No Beta Access&gt;, &lt;Waiting For Classic&gt;, etc. are all very popular guilds right now. People just refreshing their memories of quests, testing out classes, seeing how professions play out, attempting dungeons. It’s a blast!
---
INSANE PSA: STUDY BEFORE LAUNCH SO YOU CAN PLAY MORE AT LAUNCH? :3
---
There has been some damage comparisons made, and private servers seem to be across the board tuned to do more damage.
---
Example from 2006 vs private server. Warrior has 10k armor from being 7/8 T2 and the Druid has armor cap.  [https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png)
---
Wow sub has practically doubled in gbp since 2008 though...
---
/moo
---
You could always add in extra challenges yourself, you go-getter.
---
SL/SL was TBC
---
... or Just get a Real Job and take sick days/vacation. 200 IQ
---
Imagine once spring 2020 comes around if someone remade all of the Tales Of the Past, really loved the story, and brings back good memories.
---
Thing is, bag space is limited in vanilla. So unless you force epics on to every guild member &gt; force them to reroll proffs, it wont really be THAT much stacking.
---
Kind of a noob question here but.. why more than one pummeler?
---
Apparently you’ve never done the quest.
---
It has nothing to do with any of that. Private servers have been played for years and years with modern connections. The affect of spell batching isn't just some random delay on your spells, it changes the flow and tempo of combat to the point that it even affects class balance. In a very high-damage game setting, it gives players an extra split second to react to threats. It also allows for certain lines of counterplay that are important to old wow: Gouging blinks and abolishing blinds and skulling rocket helms and the list goes on... these things matter, and spell batching helps keep the combat the way it was.
---
Use classic db
---
There is no evidence anything you claim is true. Especially the issue of running oom is straight out untrue. How many healers were running around with their T1 set back in 2005/2006? With the itemization available these days you can easily sit on twice the bonus heal as people back then were using.
---
Gear exclusivity is a huge portion of vanilla. If you aren't able to do the content, for whatever reason, then you don't get gear from it. Downscaling difficulty to allow for a random group to not need to know the fights (which in MC's case are simple mechanics) is essentially the opposite of the approach to gearing vanilla had as a whole. 
---
For those who are more casual, raids like ZG, AQ20, and Ony compensate by allowing smaller groups or more casual players the opportunity to pug something relatively easily.
---
You want a spamable bear macro. Especially the way spell batching will work, you can shift after a stun goes off. You don't want to double tap it and shift back out of bear. 
---
Unfortunately I don't have a beta key so I don't have one for you.
---
What's the logic in these rules?  Is it to try and balance out some inherent disadvantages that rogues/wars/druids have at this level?
---
There's some evidence though. I have made some comparisons myself between my own recorded footage from 2006 and compared it to Private servers I have played on. The result seem to be pretty much the same. Damage is higher on private servers:
---
Warrior in 2006 vs Druid on private. Druid has 5k more armor.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/nxCiLCZ.png)
---
Beautiful I always examined you and would drool.
---
You're right, back at the beginning of Vanilla I was unemployed and WOW was the only entertainment I could afford.
---
The one that most accurately represents vanilla. I want old AV because it's iconic to vanilla. I want the original epic mounts available at the start of the game and the content to offer the challenge it would have when it was introduced. The sad thing is that pservers seemed to be better at making choices like this.
---
Leveling as a shaman is very simple. The fastest way to level is "earthbind kiting", this is pretty much just you dropping down earthbind totem, dotting the mobs down with searing totem/flame shock while auto-hitting. You can keep killing mobs with this method even when you're low on hp/mana, which is the reason it's the best(most efficient) way to level. But dropping down searing, flame shocking and auto-attacking is basically what you do when you don't feel the need to kite.
---
When it comes to talents however there are several ways to do it on your way to 60. I always go for this one (the 2h stormstrike build) [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxdux0hZxVbzA0ut](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxdux0hZxVbzA0ut). This means you start with 11 points in elemental to increase your survivability [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbu](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbu), then respecc at 20 to jump-start enhancement and get the talents that matter a lot when leveling with this certain build, like the two handed axes talent, flurry, ghost wolf to reduce travel time, etc etc.
---
In terms of 2h weapons there's just so many to name, you have this weapon [https://classicdb.ch/?item=5306](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5306)  which can be obtained at level 14 from a quest. Crescent staff is big for you [https://classicdb.ch/?item=6505](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6505), you can probably get it pretty early on if you find a good group. Corpsemaker [https://classicdb.ch/?item=6687](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6687) from RFK. Skullsplitter from a questline in Arathi [https://classicdb.ch/?item=9521](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9521). Will of the Mountain Giant  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=10652](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10652) Feralas. Beastslayer  [https://classicdb.ch/?item=11907](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11907) Un'goro.. and these items are just a few out of all the different ones you can get when leveling up.
---
When it comes to raiding your friend will have a hard time finding a raid spot in a SERIOUS guild and with hard I mean basically impossible. BUT, there will always be casual guilds that will recruit and bring literally anyone in order to fill up their 40man raid team, so he will be raiding even though he might not progress as much as others if the casual guild runs into problems.
---
If he wants to raid in a serious guild then tell him to prepare to actively pay for respecs, because they will force him to go resto during raiding hours. It's just the way things are.

Thank you

I don’t know whether it is 1% of the players or not, but I am pretty sure that the common player was, and still is, too dense to understand what spell batching is.
---
I don’t remember in 2005 people, even the ones that were commited to PVPing, trying to blind vanishes, scatter charges, etc. I remember that - and any player who consciously made these plays back in the day will remember too- many people considered these tricks as exploits.
---
Now I am not bringing this up to say that they were exploits or in anyway had a negative influence on the game in vanilla, I am just trying to point out to you how clueless the common player was/is about the game, so you could stop pretending that the common player would truly care about spell batching in classic.
---
This didn’t come into the common players’ attention into what needed to be implemented in classic, before the cherrypicking of old PVP videos and shitposting of how spell batching allowed for nuanced, high skill plays and that it is imperative for it to be in classic.
---
My opinion is that spell batching is a thing that will not make or break classic for most players. So rather than having a broken game due to the way Blizzard tried to emulate a technical imperfection, I’d not have it at all. Of course I too hope that Blizzard will fix it.
---
You need to calm down, and stop making such bad arguments.   Logical fallacies aren't your friend.
---
PS:  Reddit is basically nothing more than circlejerks.
---
Fish is used for a lot of important recipes.
---
Stonescale Eel is used for Flask of the Titans (hp flask for tanks) and some armor elixirs.
---
Firefin snapper is used for fire damage elixir and for fire absorb potions.
---
Oily Blackmouth is used for free action potions (very good in pvp).
---
Deviate fish is used for a elixir that increase size and damage a little (think the damage was not worth it but still size is a fun item) and also used to make a thing to turn into a pirate for a while.
---
Mana regen food is made with fish, very important in raids.
---
I think other food that is important also uses fish.
---
If that's the dealbreaker for you, please stay in BFA

Each pummeler charge lasts 30 seconds and the weapon has 3 charges. So if you want to use 1 charge per boss in a raid, you will probably need 3-5 depending on how many bosses you are tanking.
---
I see plenty people agreeing when reading the comments. 
---
Yet it’s not a surprise most people in this Subreddit cannot read.

Those two have to be my least favorite as well. I'd say it's the colors but other zones are very similar and I don't mind them.
---
It gets consumed.
---
Nothing beats CCs that lasts forever, though, the true classic experience.
---
It's going to be lower because of the higher boss parry chance confirmed recently. Pservers are like 8%(?) and classic will be 14%.
---
Thanks. Another option to consider it looks that i sacrifice utility for dmg here.
---
Read Lord of the Clans and the Last Guardian. Ignore the whole Rhonin War of the Ancients stuff. He's just an invincible male Mary Sue, traveling through time and fighting next to Illidan. I don't consider it real lore. Just bad writing. It's like reading stuff from later expansions where a hundred different developers all have their own story idea and none of them communicate with each other so it's all inconsistent. Lord of the Clans and Last Guardian are true to the original vision of Warcraft, rather than the mess that the game is today

This has to be a troll post lol well done
---
You sound like a pussy :)
---
Thanks I’ll look into that as it will be very useful with limited bag space :)
---
In a MT slot sure, but they still have massive utility as an OT for a casual guild. Better damage than a prot warrior dpsing, better tank than a fury w/ a shield, and one less tank fighting for warrior tier gear make them a very good choice.
---
As others has mentioned it really depends on which class you want to play. Besides that it comes down to what you feel like you're struggling with the most.  
---
In PvP theres approximately 16 different kinds of stuns, most of them are random though for example mace spec stun, impact, blackout etc. but these, as well as the majority of other stuns, are all very common in PvP.  
---
In terms of fears/charms/sleeps that WotF can break, there's around 9, however it's only fears and MC cap that is common in PvP tbh.
---
Who would have thought that Newman was a corporate spy.

Youre not my bro :)
---
Dude, the Light before it was expanded lore-wise is just diet-Christianity.  In fact, didn't the humans in WC1 straight up just worship "God"?
---
I think most people agree vanilla should be difficult though. 
---
I mean let's pretend it is nostalgia, and vanilla was only hard because we were all retarded, then shouldn't blizzard make the game actually more difficult to compensate for all the information and resources we have now? 
---
Because otherwise classic is going to fizzle out we're the only challenge is the time gate it takes to get anything done.
---
Exactly this. When they announced they'd be working from the 1.12 patch I think many of weren't as concerned as we should have been because pservers did too. The difference is that they were dedicated to recreating the every step of the game as accurately as possible whereas Blizzards seems to want to get away with doing as little as possible. 
---
If we're starting off before honor ranks and DM, the difficulty of the content should reflect that period.
---
Group play as in dungeons? You would be healing those, so +healing and int. 
---
And how do you want to play solo? Most cases, you will want stam, strength, int, spell power if you can get some.
---
That would be a problem for all dps. We won't know how much damage a lot of classes will be doing though. The resists and armour values were just made up on private servers, and as mentioned before were going into MC with full class reworks.
---
Viable, yea.  but... not optimal
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 didn't even have a subs, and they did fine.
---
GW2 never had the quality of gameplay/content WoW has, nor the customer support.
---
Don’t forget about the corpse runs you have to do for instances. For example, an Alli group wipe in WC means you have to run back from Booty Bay. This is a million times faster than taking off gear and dying since you’d have to run all the way back from the nearest open-world GY.
---
RemindMe! 86 days
---
I’m trying it on a pserver now also, i are that it is confusing showing the quests already completed and ones that I can do yet, maybe if I install it before doing any quests will help overall? I’ll try though :)
---
Check Kargoz videos on YouTube, he covers duo levelling a lot
---
Gw2 sells you better salvage kits, infinite salvage kits (bag space is a *premium*, much more so than compared to wow, a million cosmetics that absolutely shit on 99% of armor sets you can get free, more bag slots, more bank slots, the list goes on.
---
Yes, wow has a shop too these days, I just don't think it's comparable... Wows shop will never be as big, doesn't have consumables, and doesn't offer any items that are really useful, it's all cosmetics except the level boost.
---
You *can* buy gems from people like you can buy tokens for gold in wow, but much like wow they are expensive.
---
they have already said you will need an active sub, doesn't mean latest expansion. I am sure we will have to "buy" classic (which I am not pleased about...) but if they try and make me buy BFA to play classic I seriously just wont. That would be absolutely ridiculous.
---
Ah that’s a good one, I’ll look into it, thank you :)
---
Can't an add-on fix that for you?
---
Option 2, any time any day
---
Idk this meme
---
&gt; So far, elites have been hitting for much less than what they do on private servers.
---
Is there *any* proof of this?  I've seen it repeated over and over without any proof other than some people saying they played both and private servers felt harder.  
---
I have a hard time believing this is the case.
---
Yes. I think it’s pretty reasonable: lots of people are talking about how it’s 1.12 but there are phases like there weren’t in vanilla, so patches already don’t map to content.
---
Introduce them at launch but make them BoP like they were by 1.12 so they can’t be hoarded and sold on the AH later. Remove them when Phase 2 hits.
---
Sylvanas died before Blood Elves were a thing.

Explains as to why blizzard said "everything is as it should be" and yet the damage still felt off to some people.  It's not as fun and it doesn't make much sense, and you would think blizz would be able to catch something like this unless they are just really determined to keep the nerfed values. Also it doesn't help that the people who know the least are often the loudest. shrug
---
That episode broke up our raid that night it premiered. Everyone was laughing too hard trying to watch it at the same time.
---
Classic doesn't have to mean a perfect 1.12 server. We're getting progressive content so what's the point of going with the nerfed versions of everything?
---
But they arnt speeding through things. You saw how amazed people were when asmon did deadmines without wiping once.

I don't know a guide but you could spec 0/30/21 and get the improved healing talents in resto plus NS, and a few points into the totem boosting talents and that is enough to heal in raids.  Mostly shaman just spew out chain heal and totems, the only big downside is you don't have mana tide totem AND you don't have stormstrike but stormstrike is kind of overrated, it has a long cooldown.
---
Do Tauren hunters get extended range with bows and guns, or is just their melee range and dead-zone affected by their large hit box?
---
Because someone wrote that this was a thing back then, against an entire internet of not showing any evidence for it? I don't think so.

But hey, please do try it when AQ40 comes. I will have a grand laugh about your guild getting stuck :D

Of course not, why the fuck would you upload a l33t pvp video of you camping a flagroom in stealth for 20minutes, with no one coming in caus the premade is farming them at gy? Those clips are mostly from situations where the flag is already stolen by the opposing team, which is when the rogue should be out killing efc.

Yup, yup. I decided to go back and continue the grind for the fishing chair. At least fishing is always fun.
---
So its says taurens have to racial mount and are to big to ride and use a racial called plainswalker wonder what happened there?
---
It would make sense if Dwarved couldn't be Hunters.  Then all three Titan-created races would lack the connection to nature, but if Dwarves can be Hunters there's no reason Humans shouldn't.
---
fishing can be big money
---
I was a clicker in EQ, but very much was actively keybinding abilities in WoW during vanilla.
---
Oddly enough, I recall playing EQ2 sometime after WoW release and going back to clicking. I'm fuzzy on the why, as it was so long ago...but if I recall correctly there was just a metric ass-load of abilities, even compared to WoW (at the time), and I just gave up and clicked through the dps rotation.

My best friend, that got me into wow, rolled a hunter. It was wild how much some people had it down. Druids especially could fuck them up by entangling roots, hibernating the pet, then just sitting in the dead zone and wailing on him.
---
Yes, I agree. 
---
But explaining this to your typical WoW keyboard incel warrior is almost impossible.
---
I guess we won't be hearing from you again. Good bye.
---
They claim they happened to have had a backup of 1.12 which is what is making it possible to replicate it accurately, but they may not have this with TBC so any implementation may not be any more accurate than a private server currently is.
---
I forgot about that! I don’t think it was dirty who had it though.
---
There is no quest for the LEVEL 40 mount...you are talking about the epic mount at 60.
---
Surprised nobody has mentioned EPGP yet. That’s what my guild will be using.

I'd rather go in as fresh and desperate as possible when the game drops.

I log into retail but only to explore the old raids and dungeons to get the layout of them. I also fly around the old zones just to remember what most of the layout looked like. It's been really fun to do even though I know a lot of the old zones are not the exact same.

I think $180 per year is quite steep, for a game that is. On the other hand, go to a movie with popcorn and drink you probably spend $35-$40 for a 2h experience.... so in relation $0.03 per hour of game time is very reasonable :D

He and Sylvanas work better as background characters.  BFA's mistake was shunting the Undead and all their horrible actions to the spotlight.
---
I don't count server xfer as a shop.
---
Plus a lot of xfers were free from OG high pop servers to lower pop servers as they tried to redistribute the population once new servers were added.
---
I re subscribed just in hope to get beta key, never though about that first option.
---
Like others have said, pretty relative. I had no problem paying it, even as a 12 year old with a measly allowance. I'd have killed for a way to pay my sub with in-game gold back then, but nowadays I don't mind so much. The money I put in for over 7 years was worth it for all the good memories I got, and I'd do it again for more good memories!
---
He said epic ring. Lol.
---
They are talking about the **level 40** mount.
---
Why would you want to AoE farm Deadmines?

Just stop studying for 2 years

iT IsN'T FaiR!!!
---
It's a World of Warcraft subscription that includes both games. You're acting like a child.
---
WoW Classic is such a rock paper scissors, that it isn't even just picking who you think the best overall player is. Matchups are a huge decider.
---
11usd per hour?  I'm confused thats higher than US min wage or is this per week?
---
13€ a month is expensive for a game like this, I'd rather pay 60€ upfront. But meh, obviously the value of something is the max people are willing to pay for it.
---

---
The Tauren range passive is a notional passive that happens because of the larger player model. So it only affects melee range
---
He is clearly talking about when it was possible
---
You only get dplit up if you want to. Not saying its ideal but worst case scenario you can just say we go to the first pvp/e/rp in alphabetical order. There, impossible to get split up

best case scenario would be 42 weeks, unless you are doing things to artificially stop exp flow.... like role playing in cities and inns...
---
How do you only have 4 hours a week?
---
1/ can it heal?
---
2/ are secondary specs fun or boring?
---
3/ it is Possible to try strange specs/ multi specs and be strong?
---
4/ is it Druid?
---
You mean Ratchet?
---
wow, great advice from a random redditor.  You must feel proud of this comment.
---
Priest probably has the easiest 1-20 leveling experience out of all classes...(hunters and warlocks come close but accidental pet pulls are huge pain in the ass) and one of the best self sustaining leveling specs in the game.
---
Idk wat u on about m8
---
It's even worse, because it cost them nothing to do.
---
This is an incredibly naive approach to assessing the value of money, and reads like a parody of depreciation/inflation theory.
---
Just because inflation occurs, and a particular price of a particular thing remains the same does not equate to said thing being cheaper, there's like so many other factors.
---
Make leeway and batching like retail.
---
Vanilla wasn't that difficult is what people don't want to hear.
---
WoW was considered THE casual MMORPG compared to Everquest and the PvP centric hardcore MMORPG's.
---
You were basically a "carebear" just for playing WoW in general compared to those other MMO's.
---
The hardest part about Vanilla WoW was having a computer that could handle 40+ people on the screen. The raids are super simple for the most part (Makes sense, this was 2004.) Compared to raids nowadays, Vanilla raids are an even bigger joke difficulty wise.

Except his information is either misrepresentations of the truth, or in some cases flat out false. His arguments got shot down in the other thread so he made a new one to avoid people reading all the posts calling him out on his BS.
---
Everyone no.
---
In general yes.
---
It varies state by state depending on min wage, cost of living, tax changes etc.
---
Don't think so, no.
---
Guild bank. 
---
I used to be an officer of a couple raiding guilds in vanilla, and this was the biggest pain point ever. Having to drop whatever you were doing to login to an alt and get some mats, or if the person who managed certain things of the guild bank alt was unavailable to login for whatever reason it sucked. You had to spread out the goods among the officers just in case, but it was never a fun nor good experience. 
---
A guild bank would make sense gameplay wise as it makes sense for a guild that shares resources to see and control this. 
---
Out of fear of whatever other QOL changes might come with it I'm still on the no changes - but if TBC comes I'll rejoice in the opportunity of guild banks.
---
Desolace or Arathi. I really don't like both zones. I think Desolace takes the cake. It's the only Desert/Barren zone in the whole game I don't like. The questing is horrible but I think the colors also don't help at all. 
---
And, well, Arathi is just... boring and empty.
---
Small correction even though in general you’re right: it’s 3500 US-$, so roughly 3125€ right now.
---
Hunters are not required for anything, MC will still be faceroll without them.
---
I'd say the vast vast majority of classic players who are returning would like the values to be as close as possible that's the whole point. So if we are starting in a later patch that happens to involves changes to lower level dungeons in a way that makes them easier (that made much more sense at the time when they were originally implemented) but not so much now in this situation, why wouldn't we ask them to adjust that part back. Pretty reasonable and hard to argue against lmao
---
"#nochanges but" should become a meme on this subreddit because it's so moronic, so thanks for the free comedy :D
---
I've said many times but let me repeat.
---
Blizzard has only 1.12 data, no earlier. Classic will be as Vanilla 1.12 was. The end.
---
But /tar doesn't tell you where they are. The only thing you know is that they're within targeting range
---
11 USD per month
---
Felt like best bang for my buck.  A 2 hr movie almost costs the same as 80 hours of gameplay.
---
Pservers are 5% I think
---
Haha, he probably was worried about server issues that were back on release. It was horrible to play classic with the internet issues for sure. I'm glad this is happening though, but who could've guessed it would be such a success already!?
---
Well, as you can see it’s easy to argue against when you live in Clown world.
---
Im sure a couple million subs will make him feel better and get over being wrong.
---
I plan to do a blend of loot council and dkp, however loot council will be announced much in advance, like main tank gets first bindings, etc. However i feel that DKP should be deducted even on reserved gear.
---
I fill the best DKP system is also not bid based this can combat collusion where people keep items very cheap
---
Yes but 80% of that will only want to play a melee dps god. The vast majority of people who choose warrior is not for tanking.
---
bump, this post needs more attention
---
You choose, hard to say which one is BETTER because if you care to min max you should go gnomish to get all the items then switch to goblin. But if you only want to do it once and are a melee player, then go gnomish because of the battle chicken.       
---
Basically gnomish is gadgets and other items, quite a few are BoE that you can trade.    
---
Goblin is more bombs and explosives on use types, also boe but having people to craft sappers for you could be annoying
---
Is this correct use of this meme? Because I don’t get it
---
Retail WoW isn't really my cup of tea anymore either but saying you can't fail in is just ridiculous. Mythic+ and heroic/mythic raiding is harder than any vanilla dungeon or raid ever was.
---
Unfortunately about all the people i played with quit. Especially the people from my first guild, Stormwind Assassins. When i ding 60, it wont be the same. One of my toons, who was my.main from Late BC onward, was a joke toon originally.
---
Has to do with currency valuation.  Blizzard doesn't control the weight or expectation of GBP against the USD.  Generally these companies just best follow valuation and prediction.  GBP has been relatively unstable this decade.
---
Yeah but on Ally side it will be harder to find a group as warrior since there are also paladins who try to get in groups, and you have to avoid all of those. On Horde side if you are a warrior, any group is fine, there are not going to be 2 warriors after all.
---
Same reason I like pizza and ice cream. I just like it
---
When trying to decide what class to play, don't worry about how easy they are to gear, and try not to focus too much on how they are performing. Look at the playstyle of the class before anything else. If you choose a class that you don't enjoy playing, gear and dps won't change anything.
---
Paladin. You guys won’t really die while questing if you stick together. Paladins have like 3 oh shit buttons. This will also allow you to easily create dungeon groups. You can tank, heal, or dps. Gear won’t conflict. Plus no class is boring if your playing with people you love.
---
Won't need a gaming PC, if you can run retail wow you will be able to run classic, I think even if you can barely run it'd be fine

just fyi you can buy a 6 month for 12.99 now.
---
I've been on Emerald Dream for coming up on 10 years now.

Ishnu alah, traveler.
---
Are warriors actually better than any other class at a specific farm? Or are they always just better off doing generic/outdoor farms?
---
Tanking runs with a farming grp notwithstanding, I’m talking solo

I hope blizzard bans it.

Lol that username.  Was going to counter point this post but no... God you are so off on this.

Don’t know why this was downvoted. I don’t think faction changes or wow tokens and all that will be there, but, over time, I do see things like paid appearance changes coming back. 
---
Most of the money retail WoW makes is through microtransactions. If lots of retail players leave to play classic, that’s a huge loss. While the developers and project leads may be passionate and claim certain things, Blizzard is a big company with higher ups who do not care. 
---
People have to understand that Blizzard doesn’t hold company meetings about how good their game is and how many people like it. They talk about customer retention, average amount spent per customer, etc. If they see losses in WoWs revenue, regardless of how good classic is, they will treat it as a failure and act accordingly.
---
You get Crystals right from the start.

In the last couple of years the EU price(Blizzard's doing) has been raised and a load of states now pay tax(not blizzard's doing) on their subs when they didn't before. Is this being factored in?

I live in Venezuela and can assure you it isn't per hour. Now im too lazy to do the math to check if its weekly or monthly but yeah you can imagine trying to pay for WoW with those salaries.
---
Warrior rogue and mage, warrior would be #1 once they have some raid gear otherwise rogues will be #1, then in naxx the fire mage that gets the ignite will be the #1 DPS. I cant remember if the same applies for AQ for fire mages
---
I could argue it's going to be even better this time around, I was an idiot kid back then who knew nothing. I get a second chance at it now, most people given the chance would love to do things in life over again in a different/better way.
---
&gt;  I bet Tapsout will stream and commentate it too.

hahahaha tapsout
---
When the boss Parry it will reduce the remaining time on it's swing by 40%, making the next hit occur faster.
---
What OP failed to mention is that Druids have a 2.5 second attackspeed. With bosses in Classic having 14% Parry instead of 5.6% like they do on Private servers, then Warriors will be more affected by this increased chance to Parry than a Druid tank.
---
The 9% additional Parry might occasionally increase damage spikes on the tank, but Druids have armor cap on 75% reduction (Warriors can never reach this) and a higher healthpool, Druids are very unlikely to die.
---
For Warriors this Parry is actually a real problem as it will eat Shield Block charges and leave the Warrior open to Crushing Blows. With lower armor than a Druid these crushes will hurt more than on a Druid.
---
I do know it's using the updated graphics. But as far as modern graphics go, it's not that high-end. You can also turn down the graphics obviously. Depends on what you have.
---
Doesn’t change the fact that the current state of the Elite Mobs in the Beta, DOES NOT represent how they were in reality. 
---
Because in reality we had like 10 patches of actual strong &amp; dangerous Elite Mobs vs. easy 1.12 Elite Mobs.

What I'm suggesting is that they don't drop from DE'ed items until patch 1.9 as is blizzlike. They should drop large brills until 1.9.
---
That way there's no saving up.
---
It's also possible that back then people just sucked at level 30, I know I sure did. Also people are grinding for BiS level 30 gear which wasn't exactly a meta.
---
Though having dungeons be harder would be more interesting, for sure.

DM is both Deadmines and Dire Maul in vanilla. It’s not that card to differentiate if you look at their level or pay attention to context clues.
---
Why would it be more difficult to run into Gnomeregan in Classic? The boss is located 3min from the back door if you stealth.
---
I would have to disagree. I would like the content to be harder but i disagree that its absurd to kill a 42 elite with a 5 man group of 30s (those 30s have mostly lvl 30 BiS btw and are fully enchanted). One great thing about classic is that a lvl 60 players can go harass level 30 players, but in a big enough number those 30s can still kill the 60.
---
Also say what you want about retail being harder, i agree to some extent, but dungeons? Cmon, they are not hard, not even in M+, the only thing preventing you from doing it is gear. Its simple. You dont need any CC or anything in retail, tank pulls a group and you aoe them down. Thats the rule for 95% of the pulls. Occasionally there is a target you should focus. What do you do differently in a +10 key from a +20? Nothing. You do exactly the same, if you have the gear you can do 20 and if not you do lower. Sure great players might do a +20 with less gear than you but those are exceptions. Again, not saying one or the other is more difficult, they are both easy in their own ways, but do i think the vanilla style is more engaging? Yes i do. I would like it to be a little harder but not in the sense of mobs doing more damage and having more health which would only result in you needing better gear and not much else
---
I think the world changes in Cataclysm were actually overall positive. It didn't really have an impact on the game that much, since at this point dungeon finder and other changes had killed a lot of the social aspect of the game. 
---
Personally I felt WotLK and Cata raiding was very dull, as the only thing with a shred of challenge was heroic mode. Experiencing the same thing you've already done except with bigger numbers isn't the most exciting thing imaginable. Most guilds cleared normal raids within a couple weeks of launch and that was the beginning of a very long and boring wait for new content.
---
As stated before, you are taking part in the biggest circlejerk of all. That and you're assuming that we as individuals cannot decide for ourselves what a fair price point is because we've been affected by the "hivemind". Someone's been "redditing" a little too much.
---
And since you're so bent on quoting things and pointing out logical fallacies, look up the actual definitions for "Straw Man" and "Circular Argument". Sounds like a circlejerk doesn't it?
---
In any case, none of your arguments are valid because of the way you comport yourself in a discussion here. You're editing your wording in your replies AFTER I've replied, and then quoting me and picking away at it to make me look silly  It's actually extremely pathetic, and to me kind of helps me understand why you are so dense about the subscription stuff. Refining your wording in an edit long after the fact does not make you look more intelligen, dude. On top of that, if you do plan on still playing classic, then this is also the dumbest argument that's ever been had. If you aren't, then it isn't your job to try and police the people that are already fine with it.
---
Lol i was through this conundrum this past two days being bored.. I decided to wait just because I will have to study a lot the rest of the month and it would be a waste of sub.

Firefin Snapper - Used to make Fire Protection Potions - they'll be chugged in MC
---
Oily Blackmouth - Used to make Free Action Potions - they'll be chugged in BGs
---
Stonescale Eel -  Used to make Flask of the Titans and Greater Stoneshield Potions - they'll be chugged in all raids. Also used to upgrade T0 to T0.5 in Phase 5.
---
Deviate Fish - Used to make a recipe that turns you into a Ninja or Pirate. Some people use these 24/7.
---
Spotted Yellowtail, Rainbow Fin Albacore, Whitescale Salmon - about 40,000 of these together needed to open the AQ gates in Phase 5
---
Lightning Eel, Plated Armorfish, Stonescale Eel - Used as a repeatable turn-in during Phase 6
---
Winter Squid - gives the best agility food buff, can only be caught in the winter
---
Nightfin Snapper - gives the best MP5 food buff
---
Pearls - used for all sorts of crafting
---

Yeah we can disagree, but I think your arguments are very emotional and you dont really read. 
---
World PvP would still be gear based and your pvp gear will have meaning in the world. Just not Wargames.. So it can be a real pvp so equal experiance. 
---
Vanilla wasn't competitive? While is was yet so prestigues to gain surtain items or mounts. Even if it would be on competition of time investment.. 
---
Yes so you agree that the honor system had 0 skill involved. Yet you defend it? 
---
I could agree about your arguments for Transmog. Not about the image, but for recognising the scale of the opposition. 
---
Yes because wotlk was the height of PvP experiance, so had relatively a target ammount of them. These people where correct. But any kind of Ilvl influence nulifies their wish.. scaling is not solution. 
---
I dont see what you would want to happen afther the classic timeline
---
They could always make an expansion on a "different timeline" kinda thing. They could make a vanilla specific expansion. I think re-releasing the expansions is dumb.
---
They won't be able to. We're only using API calls that the "must-have" addons like threat meters, gatherer, etc use. To block what we use in the API would mean blocking just about every addon.
---
My friends and I would show up like clockwork after football practice for Mac Mondays. Our local store had trays with like 30 Macs stacked on each all ready for us. I usually had 4-5, a Biggie fry and diet Coke. 😁

cough pservers cough pay for level boost cough
---
...is that for real?
---
Did you do MC back in the day? If you didn't tranq rumbling earth you didn't even make it passed the earth ele boss, period full stop. 2 shot the tanks, game over.
---
I have done some damage comparisons myself and the difference is quite substantial.
---
Warrior in 2006 with 10k armor vs a private server armor capped Druid:
---
in order to have a few extra minutes, you'd have to be spending literally hours just mount riding in order to get those few extra minutes. Since you've already said you have a limited playtime, I doubt you're doing that. The time you're "saving" from having this trinket is all negligible for you. It's not allowing you to do anything extra. If you are on your mount for a full hour and stay constantly riding, you'll save maybe a minute and 30 seconds, if you even have your epic mount. If not, you wouldn't even be saving a minute. But since realistically you may spend 10-15 mins on a mount per play session at most, you'll be saving maybe 15-20 seconds. That's not allowing you to do anything like making food, taking a shit, or pooper scooping.
---
Time to level it up! Grab one of our high quality pitchforks and go to town
---
I got in week one, my highest character is level twelve. I play it once a week if that.
---
Theres gotta be a tiny amount of 2004 players.   I started in March of 2005 because it took me that long to get my hands on a copy of the game
---
15 years ago it was also a brand new game with brand new content, and with new content and system being developed continuously.
---
If they want full retail price from me, they will need to commit to that level of effort into classic WoW. E.g., they could commit to reworking all the xpac content with vanilla mechanics and systems. I'd be happy to pay $5-6/month for classic only, but there's no way I'm paying full retail for just plain old vanilla.
---
Wat. I mained mage and you could blink your falls all the time. You just needed to use your blink about 15 yards off the ground, unlike retail where you need to use it about 5 yards off.

Unfortunately yes.

That isn't true for many players.  I had clickers succeed all the way through AQ 40 when my guild stopped raiding.

You think this because of a minority of examples.  Successful Vanilla clickers weren't posting montages they just silently succeeded.  I knew of them because we chatted in vent.  If i hadn't found out i would have never guessed because they did fine.  Not our top healer or dps but certainly passable through endgame.
---
this has nothing to do with farming the pummelers, but how the druid using one would open itself up to near certain death
---
If you were to google the words “retro” and “wow” you may or may not find something that will assist you
---
This. If you would to spend, lets say 50% of your salary on basic needs like apartment, food, bills, gas ect, then having 250$ or 1250$ to spend isnt really comparable. 15$ just has more value in Bulgaria on avg salary than in Norway.

Retro-wow instant 60. I played for 15 mins and got bored but if there’s anything you want to check it could be good
---
Or just find an instant-60 fun server.
---
There are certain areas that provide players the opportunity to automatically play at level 60.

Why is it horde only tho?
---
&gt;I wonder how much does the 1.12 vanilla differ from the original developers idea
---
Well, let's have a looksie:
---
* Rogues were originally supposed to be able to use [Bucklers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckler) as their Offhand
---
* Taurens were not supposed to have a mount (because they are too big, you see? ^^) , but instead use an ability called "Plainsrunning" (Page 108 in the Manual btw. :) )
---
* Demonology Warlocks were supposed to be able to Melee
---
* Discipline was supposed to be a TANK SPEC (No, this isn't a joke. Ever wondered why MindBlast does extra Threat?)
---
* Hyjal was supposed to be an Endgame Quest Area
---
* The Emerald Dream was supposed to be accessible (ever wondered about the portals behind Lethon &amp; Co.?)
---
* Old Ironforge existed, but was never used. Shamans could "Farsee" through the door and access it however.
---
* There is an unused Instance portal leading to the Stormwind-Sewers
---
* Zul-Farrak was supposed to be a 10man Endgame dungeon, on par with UBRS.
---
classic is about we can play the same old fashioned vanilla like it used to be. Despite implementing new systems and creating new lores through vanilla sounds very tempting, it should be stayed away until all 6 phases are out, then we can get right in the conversation about these new stuff.
---
No, it's not.  It's $11.  Nice ass pull though.
---
I plan on being a mage on a pvp server. I like the cc abilities and the burst damage.  Frost is the best for pvp right? Is engineering a good idea to give me more pvp viability? If I go engineering what do you recommend as the second profession?
---
I can only speak for the subscription in USD terms. Sales tax and such, in certain states, are obviously out of blizzards control, but overall the price of the sub has remained the same in USD terms.

Anyone know what size the client is going to be? My internet isn’t the best so I need to know whether to plan to download it at a friend’s house.
---
I would usually fish while I was watching a movie/tv show or making phone calls etc. Whenever I could do fishing while also doing something else, I would try and do it.
---
Nobody can really predict the prices things will have in Classic, so it's impossible to know, at this time, what kind of farming will be "viable". If you have the time I doubt fishing will be the most lucrative though.
---
&gt; So it can be a real pvp so equal experiance. 
---
Thats the thing i dont get, whats equal? its imbalanced as fuck, rogues gonna farm r14s in stun/sap-lock with a gray level2 dagger. why taking gear out of the equation? so the game can get balanced?
---
&gt; Yes so you agree that the honor system had 0 skill involved. Yet you defend it? 
---
???? and you say that I DONT READ? wtf man stop wasting my time
---
Just find Retail macro sources. We're using the same API.
---
Obviously, but you weren’t mentioning LFG... I was responding to your previous point by saying that DM was a common acronym for both Dire Maul and Deadmines.
---
It's a totally subjective thing, I just know for myself that classic just won't have the same charm that vanilla did.
---
It isn’t very hard to track large amounts of gold moving around between people that are not in guild or friends. Unless you join a guild full of gold sellers or are real life friends with a gold seller. Unlikely.
---
Auction house is also easy to find aberrations like weird buyouts. They will detect and ban.

Since it seems Blizzard is starting with 16 debuff slots you have a point.

For something that can ruin social interaction in group finding at a level of gear score and LFR, I'd prefer blizzard to straight up ban all add-ons.

But thats my wishful thinking. People have issues thinking about long term or bigger picture effects, that's how we ended with BFA. I'm sure there's a market for what you make - still makes me sad though.

A *lot* of my old WoW friends have already came back in some form or another. Legion, especially near the end there, was legit fun bringing back the squad.

With classic of course my oldies want to come back but I'm hearing *hella* people who never even played pre-cata excited to get a bite of it too.

Long story short, homies probably came back already. We're getting tons of new people, like it or not.

&gt; I'd prefer blizzard to straight up ban all add-ons.
---
Yeah, that is never going to happen.
---
Every guild I ever raided with used DKP, however it was never true dkp. Everyone got dkp however each class always had a private channel where they would decide who would get the next piece of class-specific piece of gear and they would only have to spend the min dkp. Then when a piece goes up that can be used by multiple classes you had insane amounts of dkp being dropped because everyone was hoarding it.
---
The stress test was about 7 GB. The original client was about 5.5 GB
---
Raid times won't be scheduled till after release.  Raids won't be available first phase so everything will be prep and then plan best times for our community as it nears release of MC.  And certainly ill DM you tomorrow my bnet.
---
I mean, bank alts though.
---
I will enjoy Classic WoW at current prices. They haven’t changed in 15 years, and from what I’ve described above, have got 30% cheaper. 
---
You should do the same, yes it’s older content, but it’s packaged with the current version of the game. You could play both if you wanted. There’s nothing stopping you. You have that option. 
---
With how well Classic performs, that could change the future of the game/genre for the better. 
---
I’m more on the optimistic side of things.
---
I remember being super excited for this ability! As I recall reading at the time, much to my dismay, the decision to have Tauren ride Kodo was made in an effort toward "fairness and equality" so that every race had a mount. It was a last minute decision, I believe.
---
Most games without powercreep seem to gravitate towards  "ceiling" of item power. The best gear are either behind extremely prohibitive cost or very challenging objectives. This is actually very easy to imagine in World of Warcraft.
---
The problem is coming up with gear apart from the standard "More damage, more HP" kind of thinking. Hearthstone actually had to deal with a similar issue, where you can't just design cards with bigger numbers. You need something more interesting right? They have a slight power creep, but in general new cards have mechanics that didn't exist before (E.g. "Discover" or "Magnetic") and Blizzard designs card sets to add a new spin to the game.
---
World of Warcraft could in theory follow a similar line of thought. Maybe add a set for mages that does increased damage if you mix all 3 elements at once? Maybe add gear that unlock new skills when worn, creating another play style entirely? I think the possibilities are quite limitless, but coming up with ideas and seeing what sticks is really the hard part.
---
*\[Broken Shore Intensifies\]*

Yeah? How does that help?

Can you find any proof they nerfed all the low level dungeons in 1.12? I can't find any and I don't remember that at all.

---
Literally pertains to the video. Its vanilla style transmog essentially
---
Sounds like you did decent in an economics class, but it sounds like you meant to say "WoW subs are 30% more valuable than they were before" because $15 is still $15, and 30% cheaper is not objectively still $15. But there is no value beyond your person use, so, idk. You're literally just trying to sell subs for Blizz for no real reason lol. $15 per month for entertainment services is comparable rate to every other streaming site.
---
2man  3-4boss DME with a healer is really good as a fury warrior. Obviously we don't know exactly how things are gonna be, how good lashers are gonna be, what prices of the stuff you farm on bosses etc. But on pservers it's been usually just as good as mage AOE farming.
---
It was done with two warriors in vanilla.  When the Twin Emperors teleport, the closest raid member (including pets, which could cause issues if stupid hunters didn't get their pets away in time) would get a large amount of threat.  As long as casters didn't DPS Vek'Lor it was usually enough to let the healers do their job without losing aggro.  The Arcane Explosion was dealt with by simply tanking him with your back to the wall.  
---
As to *why* guilds would tank them with this set up, there were several reasons:
---
1.  The raid comp supports it.  If your dps are mainly physical classes then you're really not losing much by forgoing damage on Vek'Lor.  Obviously if you have a bunch of mages and warlocks in your raid you're not going to use this strat.
---
2.  Only two tanks are required instead of four, and are pretty much already geared for tanking.  Gearing up two warlocks with the proper SR set could be time consuming, especially if the necessary pieces never dropped for your raid.  But more than that, with two warriors tanking the raid's going to have fewer teleport transitioning issues because the tank that needs to pick up the boss after each swap is already in position.  
---
And because you asked, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnZtLf6b0Ws) a video of a guild using this strat in vanilla.  If you go to 4:15 in the video you can clearly see a warrior tanking Vek'Lor.
---
Someone make this into "I have gold in damage" for Overwatch.  I'm too lazy right now
---
Glad you said it. i did DKP through all BC (up to KJ in Sunwell, only expansion i've fully cleared funnily enough), and in WotLK I joined a hardcore guild to push content, and they used Loot Council. Was a huge change. I still got geared, but enjoyed the game, my raid mates, my guild, and everything else so much more. 
---
DKP felt like a contests to get BIS, competing with my friends via auction, left a bad taste in my mouth and just wasn't good for social aspects.  
---
Loot Council felt like proper group progression, rewarded people appropriately, and felt like group progression. I remember being the first mage (and possibly character) on the server getting 5/5 of the 25 man tier set, and being congratulated and thanked rather than hated on
---
Good for you. I hope you feel the same way in 6 months.
---
Nobody cares
---
I used to frequent /r/relationships because it was good drama to read. And some people posted on how relationships could ever work at all with so many bad ones, and you realize that anyone with a healthy relationship isnt going to post there at all. It's similar to the customer feedback that Blizzard gets, people who enjoy the game don't go to the forums very often to say "Great game Blizzard! Keep it up!"  You usually get complainers that stuff is tedious or too hard. Blizzard listened now we have retail. And the complainers don't stop complaining.
---
There was a post on /r/wow yesterday saying they should introduce World Quests to leveling because leveling 50 alts is tedious. Half said good idea, the other half said terrible idea. But even if Blizzard implemented such an idea, they would want something more for a game they honestly don't even enjoy and can't figure out why.
---
In some ways yes in a lot of ways no.
---
I had a soccer coach in HS who stopped doing running drills because people complained. Like dude seriously the people running track botched and they run for their sport lol.
---
Until drama causes the guild to implode.  40-mans have a lot of drama.
---
People dont just play classic for the raids.
---
&gt;a 5 man group of lvl 30s
---
A group of lvl 30s who optimized their characters to degrees that are absolutely ludicrous, and would not have been done by ANYONE in the normal process of leveling. I can point you to optimized lvl 19 PvP Rogues killing lvl 45+ players in the open world.
---
How this impacts the normal game, only the crybabys know.
---
&gt;who want to rather fuck classic up
---
Explain to me how this is "fucking up classic"?
---
The only thing that gets "fucked up" here, is your fantasy of Vanilla as some kind of hardcore, super difficult Elite Uber Game **which it never was**. Get this into your heads already: Vanilla was not a mechanically hard game.
---
&gt;it wouldn’t even violate #NoChanges
---
It wouldn't violate #nochanges, because it would change something. Uhuh...yeah, you may wanna work on that logic a bit, buddy.
---
&gt;Can’t wait for Classic to finally drop so I can leave this subreddit &amp; anti social mommies basement incels behind.
---
Thanks for showing conclusively, how serious you are to be taken in any given discussion.
---
I just tried it in beta and castrandom seems to be broken right now, it only casts the first spell in the list. I have submitted a bug report.
---
The behavior I described previously was implemented during WotLK, because retri paladins could make 1 button macros that just did /castrandom with all their offensive abilities, bind that to their mouse wheel, and that was their optimal rotation.
---
IIRC Cata actually had pretty challenging end-game content at launch which took a lot more work to gear for and was less forgiving of mistakes compared to Wrath. I remember playing through a few dungeons and being like "huh, I think we might actually need to make a plan for dealing with these fights" a few times, which was a pleasant change from WotLK being pretty mindless outside of heroic raids and PvP.
---
But people accustomed to late Wrath complained en masse that they couldn't just mindlessly grind heroics for a week or two then start clearing raids, and Blizzard ended up nerfing heroic dungeons and normal raids pretty hard.
---
I said this toxicity was gonna last weeks/months.  Who isnt at endgame by then?  Even the casual gamer will be finding his niche and building a core understanding of the most helpful players in the game by then.  
---
Lets be honest, there is always a level of negativity in the game, but it gets filtered out very fast
---
Yes which makes it even more cheaper in this regard. Thanks for pointing this out, totally forgot about this aspect of the subscription. I actually have a 6 month subscription up right now and this totally went over my head haha. 
---
Giving one example though I think was much easier to explain then giving examples for the 3, 6 and 12 month subs as well. Upvoted.
---
Like 1% people that come here actually post, and they hold differing beliefs. Most just look at it going no thanks, just like the rest of the internet. But the lurkers will be playing the game.
---
Will be easier sacrificing sleep for WoW if you’re in better shape. As much as we all want to eat Totinos and drink Monsters, if you want more WoW time then better food and exercise will help
---
Negativity gets blacklisted faster than you are eluding to.  Do you want the game to be toxic?
---
What about a Gnome Raid with 40 Tanks and a Taunt-Bandage-Rotation?
---
They will have those numbers anyway.
---
As someone who's primarily been a tank and occasionally a healer, I've never understood why people get so worked up about dps meters.
---
* Hunters are needed in raids
---
* Raids will bring hunters
---
* Hunters will see the content and get loot
---
What does it matter where you fall on a list as long as you're maximizing what your class is capable of.
---
First off, you seriously need to calm down.
---
&gt; And since you're so bent on quoting things and pointing out logical fallacies, look up the actual definitions for "Straw Man" and "Circular Argument". Sounds like a circlejerk doesn't it?

[Patch Notes for 1.12](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0)
---
There's nothing in here about detuning lower level instances.  Nor in 1.12.1 (which is the actual reference Blizz has IIRC).  Nor in any "undocumented changes" lists.
---
Nor in 1.11.  Or 1.10.  Or 1.9.  I'm not saying it's not there, but I am saying I don't see it.  Do we have a reference for these changes from OG sources?
---
Maybe the entire new dungeon they are adding, but that would force you to play with others so im guessing you wouldn’t like it
---
Ah, that would be an issue then. huh.
---
Get a job
---
Druids can tank all they want, I’ll just avoid them
---

---

---
30% discount on a 15 year old game with no new systems, no new content, no big team pushing further development, etc. is simply nowhere near a good enough deal for me.
---
But I'm happy if you think it's a good deal for you, I'm sure you'll enjoy the game. I'll join if/when they drop the price (as they do with the xpacs).
---
It was a change that happened during classic. Along with many other things that changed *during* vanilla, blizzard and the community have had discussions about what version to implement. So i'm not sure what you're retarded comment amounts to.
---
Loot council with pre-posted decisions so people can see when they are due next. Also allows members to discuss and make any adjustments outside of the raid.
---
Bonus points for changing up the council team from time to time with non-officers.
---
Yeah, this is also why I don’t think they will split retail and classic on twitch, since it would show if one of them doesn’t do well
---
Look how fast classic died, it was a waste to spend time making it
---
Or look how few watch retail compared to classic, the game has turned bad
---
This was all very unpleasant to read, and I haven't learned a single thing from it.
---
THIS.
---
I vividly remember leveling with my 5 RL friends and we were 30-35 in Arathi and kept getting attacked by a Level 60 Paladin. We were able to hold him back and kill him every time even if just two or three of us lived.
---
He kept coming back, it was a really good time. Will remember forever.
---
Yeah this post seems to avoid a lot of points as to why guilds bring Druid Tanks. Resist fights (Druids can stack straight resist and not suffer parry loss like warriors would, Allowing warriors to not focus on resist sets as much), and in progression they’re great before warriors get decked. They’re not on the brink of collapse if the healers miss a beat. Yeah crowd pummelers will make the parry difference worse but it’s not big enough to impact whether a feral can survive or not. I’d say Feral would likely be more valuable since Dual Wield Fury tanking will be put off even further into progression, leaving feral the most practical way to allow DPS to min max due to it being uncontested highest threat for longer
---
Because they only invited the best players. Kappa.
---
Wow molten core.....
---
I’m pretty sure a rogue could tank mc
---
That had been more healthy tho

TRNASMOG IN VANILLA?!?....not really....
---
Casual players receive a lot of undeserved hate. Maybe there were times when Blizzard listened to some feedback that they shouldn't have, but we're way past that now. 
---
The major issue is how Blizzard treats their casual players like they're complete idiots. I'm not referring to bad players. I mean treating players like they've never played WoW, or even a MMO for that matter, before. It's like a never-ending tutorial mode.
---
Vanilla WoW is essentially, "We've created a world and filled it with content. Have at it." Retail doesn't work like that. It's micro-managed to such a level that you play the game the way Blizzard wants you to play and you're not supposed to fail. There's no real challenge outside of the top end of instanced content (M+, raids, and PvP). The vast majority of the game isn't just easy. It's idiot-proof. 
---
If you want to stick with kids as an example, Vanilla is when kids would leave the house in the morning and the only rule was to be back home for dinner. Retail is like having helicopter parents that decide everything for you and make sure you get a trophy at the end.
---
Soda doesnt care about money. He cares about the quality of his stream but I think playing WoW classic on stream prolly tipped him over to not care at all as he's clearly having fun
---
Let the scum fight it out.
---
Very bold claims when we don't know the boss damage, and even if we did, it's easy to extrapolate into how tanky warriors are in comparison. Armour equations have been known for a long time.
---
Wholesome
---
Imagine being a Trump lover and making a reddit account called CrookedHillary.
---
Get seal of command. Its really your only hope of doing any damage
---
Why 13€ a month? It's 10€ a month: https://www.amazon.de/World-Warcraft-GameCard-Tage-Pre-Paid/dp/B0007T3ARE/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?keywords=wow+gamecard&amp;qid=1559493052&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=wow+ga&amp;sr=8-1
---
And for me personally that's a great deal. 60 days for 20 euros for a game you can play every day for 12h and still have enough to do is extremely worth it.
---
On page 56 I drew that Earth Elemental for my 6th grade class. None of my friends believed me and the teacher even stepped in to clarify "No, you didn't draw that." It wasn't even that good or anything. I just showed them the little book I drew it from and they accused me printing it out larger or something.   
---
So I got mad and threw it in the trash. Honestly I wish I never did that.
---
I wish the phases also included the patch and balance changes over time, but understand it is unlikely and honestly too much to ask for.
---
Late vanilla leveling and early instances were a lot easier than release. Thats what were seeing now tbh. That mixed with knowledge, ping, and a better gear than average due to the cap... its easier.
---
If it were patched through the phases, totally different. We dont have a decade of theory crafting for level 30 1.1 for instance, and it would be way harder.
---
Don’t get a dps meter
---
I think you might be correct, I was thinking the same thing but none of my friends had the dual PTR accounts "bug" so it was hard for me to confirm it.
---
Definitely the best system I've encountered. Combining it with guild rank priority system to ensure that the most dedicated/high attendence/helpful folks are getting their efforts acknowledged.
---
This is the answer. I’ve had a great on-and-off relationship with someone throughout WoW. His strength is guild drama (my weakness) and my strength is raid strategy/leading. It is so much more effective and is supported by pulling together a great group of officers/leadership.
---
Also of note, and often an issue for us at various times, appoint someone to be focused on guild recruitment. I find this to be a tricky compliment to incorporate, but if you can find the right person to focus on it, ideally someone personable with a lot of knowledge on class gameplay, it can be s huge pay off.
---
druids are not uncrushable or on critable, fury warriors are
---
I’m more surprised the blood thirsting PVP chads of the horde managed to put something together that’s as well organized as that.
---
Sounds like an interesting tradeoff to make.
---
you know, life gets in the way. work, gf, sleep, eat, workout.
---
More specifically, the item will stick around forever, but the active effect (what you actually are after) can only be used 3 times each.
---
You’re definitely over complicating it. 
---
The dollar value of goods and services has changed over time to account for inflation . Same for wages and everything else. 
---
In this respect, the dollar value of the WoW subscription should of then changed as well over the course of 15 years to “$15 in today’s money” but it hasn’t. 
---
It is in fact cheaper than it was 15 years ago. 
---
At least in the USA, can’t say the same about other parts of the world.
---
And ime that that usually ends with the council determining that friendship makes the biggest difference. lol
---
But maybe I just had terrible luck.
---
The concept of "transmog" existed in vanilla when people would wear "out on the town" gear when not activley fighting etc. No its not TrAnSmoG111!!  Nor do i want any of that retail garbage in the game.
---
First off? Uuuh.. 
---
And no, they make you look stupid. You don't argue any of my point s and just edit your comments to try and sound smart. It's kind of sad, and the more you say the less it makes sense.
---
This is misleading because wages haven't risen to match inflation so is not cheaper for anyone who works a job to make money.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291757/xdlate-wow-classic-interview-with-ion-hazzikostas-and-calie-schie#in-game-shop
---
idk i get the sense that this is somewhat important to him, while i recognize its just a game its obvious he should quit his job and dump his gf
---
When Druids have armour cap they're being tickled. A crush or crit is not that much of a concern to a druid. These are also 15% and 5.6% chances to occur before factoring defense. 
---
For druids it isn't that big of a deal.
---
That's a pretty solid point that I don't think people get. Blizzard hasn't raised the price of their sub ever. It's been $15 a month since launch. How many other pay to play games can say that?
---
This is basically the addon vQue for 1.12 client. I guess
---
I was just giving people a different perspective , tying it in with economics, about a post I saw earlier today, that I tried to comment on but it wouldn’t go through so I made my own post. It eventually went through but here we are.
---
I would love to hear about RP-PvP servers. I hope devs will change their minds and will create them from the start
---
Decent chance you did eating McDonalds that much.
---
Priests are better levelers than shamans, really you should be supporting her. Just have her go down shadow and let her get killing blows, and she will never go oom. The problem if you want the shaman to be the dps is that you will be drinking, alot. The reason warriors are so great is because they dont go oom. Shamans already drink a ton while leveling, and now you want someone to wait on you drinking as well?
---
I remember mages casting invisibility in beta as well. Or am I remembering wrong?
---
During Vanilla and from my personal experience fishing was extremely profitable. Several important items from alchemy used fish and most people found/find fishing to be extremely boring so not many people would do it. Allowing a few people to really dictate the whole fish market. 
---
Fishing isn't the best or ideal way to make money given the time investment and possible profit, but it's a nice way to supplement your farming if you just want to sit and chill for a bit.
---
Engineering and whatever makes you money. Probably not alchemy.
---
Oh, I meant Druid Main Tanking but indeed I didn't know about Hateful Strike being incapable of critting, thanks for the info. Offtanking that monster must be thrilling.
---
Yes they will definitely know who’s playing what and that will be beneficial in the long run. Everything is about money though and giving a separate subscription will actually dilute their earning report. 
---
They’re you know, a publicly traded, for profit company after all.
---
Yeah, that's why I hope they release new content after the last phase
---
This strategy is also in this wiki page: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Twin_Emperors
---
and the wiki history shows it was added in 2006.
---
You do know transmog is the term where you make one item look like another item right? That term was not in Vanilla.
---
Can someone explain what stats are good for a druid? I understand Stamina, Spirit and Intellect but I cant place how important Agility and Strength would be in the mix
---
I recommend you play something else so the leveling experience can be enjoyable since it looks like your spending most of your time doing just that. If you still want to be melee, maybe consider playing rogue? A bit of a step up from warrior.
---
Another redditor brought up a good point with the different tiers of subscription prices, you get even more of a discount.
---
Its gonna be lower on Classic as Bosses parry with 14%, hence forcing Tanks to go 0/31/20
---
What is it you think justifies a $15 a month sub just for classic? Why isn't the game a flat fee like the other remakes? What justifies not having a standalone sub for only classic?
---
Classic or Live both require the same sub fee, Bliz wins either way. They just found a way to regain the lost subs.
---
I'm reading this is in a clap-trap is happy as a default tone of voice kinda way. It's probably misleading as you can just as easily be The Brain.
---
Totally! Best zone ever!
---
I mean the game is gonna be easier, that’s just something you gotta accept.
---
So if you're working 60 hours a week to provide for your loved ones you're wasting your life.
---
You are clearly a young man. Nothing wrong with it. Try to get less triggered by strangers and have a bit more empathy. Very few people enjoy working more than "necessary".
---
Hope you get some of that rage out in a healthy manner.
---
You mention people getting attached to characters, well this is just beta and everything will be wiped so there is nothing to get attached to.
---
Blizz has already said when they will allow us to reserve character names so one would assume that is when the server list is being released.
---
&gt; I get the feeling you are not capable of arguing your point, that's why  you resort to petty insults. I almost feel sorry for you. Your points  get debunked, your system destroyed, and instead of picking up whats  left of your grace and leave, you stand here, basically insulting  yourself. 
---
What point do I need to argue? You haven't raised any because you lack the basic reading comprehension skills to understand what I've written.
---
&gt; From what I read here, the only guilds you ever joined are the typical  wannabe-hardcore guilds with "aspirations of greatness" that fell apart 3  weeks later. No good guild functions the way you describe. Progressive  casual guilds are not asocial, and actual pro guilds don't use such  absurd loot systems. 
---
I'll see you near the top of the world first list. Meaning, my guild will be there and you'll be sat wondering why yours is so shit.
---
&gt;Sorry, I just had to laugh :D  
---
&gt;The  only Vanilla you ever experienced was from an ice cream vending  machine. You played on pirated servers, with shitty data and judging  from your behaviours shittier admins. You quite obviously never played  Vanilla, because the insults you use are the typical Pserver nonsense,  the assumptions you have about guilds and loot are contrary to the  social system on Vanilla.  
---
&gt;I played the  real deal sunshine, all the way from my first steps in Tirisfal to the  clear of Naxxramas. All you have, are fake memories, from fake servers.
---
Sure thing kiddo. You definitely were a part of the &lt;1% of the guilds that cleared Naxxramas in vanilla retail. Totally believable. Meanwhile actual retail vanilla players like me did kill bosses in Naxxramas, just not full clears. You can tell me how jealous you are some other time.
---
&gt;Good bye, I will not be hearing from you again.
---
I'll miss the salt.
---
You need to have Sapper charges as a melee. You can buy them on the AH tho and still use them as a gnomish engineer
---
They can fit Tier 1.5 and 3.5 raids in, one being Karazhan. The only other thing they could add without breaking the flow of the game is new leveling zones from anywhere that falls within the range between 1-60 but with the old vanilla questing formula.
---
Agreed. I doubt flasks will be as prevelant as people have been saying they will be for instance.
---
I would change a lot of low level gear / crafts  to make professions more useful, without disrupting the end game.   Basically, make more craftable sets of items that do something interesting, add a useful ability (on 30 min cooldown)  or so.  We have a  few of these in the game, but I think not enough and there are some craftable sets that are absolutely worthless in a 1.12 environment.  Those could use some love too.  
---
(This also goes for individual items)
---
Impressive.
---
Everything is affected as the larger model means everything is further out. Melee range is larger, which means the deadzone is further out. A disadvantage in PVP as well as in PVE for fights like Onyxia/Thaddius where you are at the edge of your deadzone.
---

---
&gt; Did you do MC back in the day? If you didn't tranq rumbling earth you didn't even make it passed the earth ele boss, period full stop. 2 shot the tanks, game over.

What in God's holy name are you blathering about?

If they make a vanilla-only tier for 5$/month I'll sub in a heartbeat. If they announce a credible and interesting plan and team to work on classic WoW beyond the original vanilla content and systems, then I could pay up to full retail.
---
There wasn’t. The differences that people aren’t account for are all the slow power increases from tuning talents and abilities. Lower level dungeons weren’t retuned or redone until Zul’Aman in TBC. Anyone claiming otherwise has no idea what they are talking about.

they could make the gold sinks bigger, and give a percentage back. end result the same, but different feel
---
Sounds like the perfect utopia, for sure its possible but in most cases it won't happen, in general people are shit.
---
&gt; I am not going to say which one will be more popular, because I am clearly subjective, but there is NO WAY that both games will survive in the next 5 years. One of them will be dead (or what is understood by dead - very low player base), the other will be massive and flourish.
---
&gt; We, here on r/wowclassic know which one will be.
---
&gt; The others, on r/wow think that we are wrong.
---
Lmao I'd be very surprised to see retail die within 5 years.. I stopped playing aswell and am also on the Classic side but at the same time I don't see myself playing on the same classic server for 5 years (probably 2-3 max) unless something changes.
---
Just by reading your comment you seem to be one of those that *wants* retail to "die". I'm definitely on your side but I still think you're wrong in thinking they can't coexist.
---
We did 1x 2h per week with MC and BWL on farm. AQ took a lot more time. So it was splitted on AQ one evening and mc/bwl once
---
Retail incels? What?
---
Today I went through all of the vanilla patch notes on dungeon/raids, there wasn't a single nerf to any dungeon pre zf. If you want to say scholo or Strath are easier you'd be right, but all the dungeons we've seen so far are exactly how they always were. I could be wrong if there were hidden changes that weren't included in the patch notes. Also, how much did class changes affect pre 30?
---
Yeah obviously, but people are using the faster heals like Flash Heal to snipe instead of the more mana efficient Heal and Greater Heal.
---
Mate.... ive been there and done everything vanilla offered back then, i so much agree with you but point 3 of yours triggered so much memories... i am 34 already with kids n everything, but i can say that wow classic will always be special and have special place in my heart till the end! You simply cant erase so much memories and real people that you " won" via this game back then.
---
I know and still see some of them irl, we even used to gather half our guld on summer vacations together couple of years.

---
"near certain death" is such an absurd exaggeration it's laughable.
---
It's 9% more more Parry over private servers while the actual damage values themselves are very likely much much lower based on comparisons between the two version of the game.
---
Add in how Druids have considerably higher armor and health than a Warrior tank and you would have to do some serious mental gymnastics to think that 9% additional Parry will turn Druids from being highly competitive to totally unviable.
---
They never tweaked lower level dungeons in vanilla. I have scoured patch notes so many times looking for different changes for different things. Lower level dungeons weren’t touched collectively until ZA patch (2.3) in TBC. The differences are from tuning and tweaking talents, weapon normalization and other things.
---
If you think otherwise prove it. Find the info in the patch notes. Unless you can do that please stop spreading misinformation and lies.

---
If you loot the mobs do they respawn faster than ones that you don't loot?
---
I thought it was still way too easy - we cleared all the raids on heroic in about 10 weeks if memory serves. I barely logged in to the game after that, I had other more interesting games on my hands at that point so I just stopped raiding altogether. Never experienced MoP because of that, I was already commited to Eve Online and a some other games.
---
however, if Everquest is anything to go by, Classic server will become ghosttown less than a year after release, at which point BLizzard will release a new one and the same crew of vanilla fanatic can compete again for the MC-first or w/e else they make up.
---
AQ is horrible for melees yea, especially warriors have so many tanking dutys. So i'd say its
---
1. Warrior
---
2. Rogue
---
3. Mage
---
4. Warlock
---
Till AQ then
---
1. Mage
---
2. Warlock
---
3. Rogue
---
4. Warrior
---
Then Naxx its different for each fight
---
You don't need to, I was just trying to register to see what it looked like, I'm still in contact with my first guildmates
---
Mate I don’t need you to list me the reasons why spell batching must be in classic. I am assuming the average player, who won’t be consciously pulling off these tricks, and wouldn’t be playing any different than they would if they had an extra split second to react.
---
&gt; There was a single game loop that processed all messages sent and received every server tick. Nowadays, the game processes multiple loops for messages of differing priorities. Spell casts are high priority, and have been for a long time.
---
&gt; For WoW Classic, we’re moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12
---
Now I am not sure if you have read this or if you understand what it means. It means that Blizzard can’t simply set the server ticks to whatever it was in classic. I don’t know how private servers implemented. I am pretty sure that private servers didn’t use the same client as BFA, so they might have as well just had the single loop as WOW had before.
---
We are going to be playing on a BFA client, on the same network architecture of BFA, with the BFA frequency of ticks, and the only difference is going to be spells will now be processed less frequently, whereas everything else is going to be processed as if you were playing BFA.
---
So for something that only a tiny fraction of players would appreciate, the game is going to feel broken for everyone, unless Blizzard finds a way to fix it.
---
Honestly, if youre coming back, the majority will play the same faction as they did in vanilla. If they had the same server names, we'd be there. Ill be in the same guild. All just so the recognition will be there and running into old people long gone would be amazing.
---
I suppose it is interesting. But it’s not a trade off people consciously ever made in Vanilla. They had no awareness that the original epic mounts would get removed. 
---
Really, they got the best of both worlds: both kinds of mounts, no dilemma for the individual player. We can’t replicate that, so I’d rather stick with the option that doesn’t create a new dilemma.
---
Me warrior???
---
Patchwork dont really hit that hard on the main tank, so not a huge issue. But due to how armor mitigate the Hateful damage you should always have your Druid offtank that boss regardless.
---
Even on a private server. Getting a 2agi, 1stam green leather boots made me more happy than a 400 titanforged ones on retail tbh
---
But then how it comes all the English folks from the chad city's are all playing alliance?
---
XD
---
You have to understand that Soda makes so much $ and has made so much money that he can stream like that and not even bat an eye. He still pulled ~20k viewers just farming
---
I remember some warriors absolutley wrecking my priest because of how much better their gear was.   I had a fair collection of tier0 that would get shredded by quel'serar.
---
I’m actually big into finance and investing. 
---
First thing you need to learn is about how money works. 
---
Don’t get me started with Bitcoin, future of money is upon us.
---
Hey if you wanna take up that alternate spot and fill in for missing raiders have at it, no doubt you'll be raiding every 3 weeks or so.
---
If a guild is even semi serious about progressing past the current phase, and you're raiding in that guild as a ret pally, they are trying to replace you as dps. You will probably be offered a healer spot when they replace you, and it will probably be something like:
---
"Hey RetPally, we are hoping to switch things up in the next few weeks to make sure we are ready for Phase X. Would you mind respecing at some point this week so we can get an idea of how you handle healthbars?"
---
Respec holy when this happens if you want to raid. They already have a replacement and are trying to be nice.
---
Yeah because Vin met Ronda in 2004 lol..
---
It isn't a problem. Just don't act like WoW Classic will have the vibrant community that retail supposedly lacks.
---
It won't.
---
As someone who's played vanilla and more often been the GM / Raid Leader / Officer than not, just remember people will abuse the system any way they can, and people absolutely cannot handle power. The best system is a DKP one that is hard to game; open bidding, etc.
---
Loot council will be the worst. It may seem like a good idea, but the actual politics behind the decisions will be totally biased. It'll be based on who's friends with who, who's been brown nosing who, who's the popular guy that people don't want to go against, etc. There will be good arguments for their decisions, but the actual decisions will have no connection to them. Remember anyone can argue anything.
---
If you're in a guild that says "The guild comes before the individual", run. GM's and officers love this line of thinking, because they see the guild as part of them because they own it, sp sacrificing themselves for the guild is just self-interest. But they aren't gonna get kicked if something bad happens, and they won't have to sit out raids either.
---
Find a guild that treats everyone fairly, and uses transparent and clear DKP rules that rewards everyone fairly - even if it gives some bonuses to the MT. Make sure rules can't be bent, because they will do it. Hell, even with DKP officers will usually try to verbally pressure people to bid the way they want, but at least the system is on your side.
---
But don't do loot council unless you're trying to push world's first. It's only used to screw you over.
---
So a wow subscription used to be 5 Big Macs and now it’s 3?
---
Perspective is everything. Definitely a great way to look at things.
---
This is exactly why Loot Council is better for progression and DKP is better for casual, IMO.
---
In progression, people are focused.  Leaders are more likely to be committed and less likely to apply favoritism because otherwise, you aren't making as much progress.
---
In casual, spreading the loot around in a transparent and fair way keeps people happy.  As long as the raids don't turn into wipe-fests, people will be satisfied and enjoy themselves.
---
Beware the "semi-hardcore" guild with a loot council being run by a couple of IRL friends and no established principles on how the loot council is being run.  That said, most of these are probably fine as well but I'd wager that most of the loot council abuse would happen in this space.  If you're joining such a guild, I'd definitely talk to people about how it works before committing long-term to a guild.  And if the guild has cliques, talk to people outside the clique as well.
---
My personal system would be a zero-sum DKP system since that rewards attendance primarily (points are generated when loot drops and distributed to people who didn't get the loot) but it doesn't gate people out of the occasion piece if they are occasional raiders since they'll still accumulate points when they come.

If I was fitting that to a "semi-hardcore" mindset, I would probably ensure that there is some sort of limited-use loot override but I'd have to spend a significant amount of time thinking about how to implement it.  Regardless, it would be well-documented on how it would work and the people entrusted with that authority will be reminded that it is to be used sparingly and with a high level of integrity and ALWAYS within the scope of the written rules.
---
They should make the game free.
---
Homework is not useful for learning until very late in adolescent development. 
---
Use another example.
---
The only way to prevent this is to use current technology like the one they used to regulate which items will drop titan residuum and which won't.
---
I.e. items dropped before and after the patch hits to regulate people just putting all items into their bank and wait.
---
Socialism is aids
---
Yes, I've seen the video. It's highly probable that "slightly before" means not even a patch worth. Otherwise they'd have said they have 1.11 data or something.
---
Cat form DPS you want loads of Agility so you can max your dps.
---
I don't think there were any changes to lower level dungeons - at least I have never found any evidence of this. Exception is namely Zul'Farrak and less so Mauraudon/Uldaman. Main changes we know of are to strat/scholo/brs which had a lot of trash removed when the player cap was changed - and there were some nerfs.
---
I really hope there are more 'pristine' versions to be found and we could get to experience them, but I think talents and mechanics are the only game based changes to difficulty.
---
If we should buff dungeons to reflect those is another discussion entirely...
---
&gt; Firefin Snapper - Used to make Fire Protection Potions - they'll be chugged in MC
---
a bit off on these..  it's used for fire oil, which are used more for Greater FirePOWER potions, not protection, as the easy to obtain GREATER fire protection potion was used instead for protection. (elemental fire as main ingredient) 
---
Other than that, great summary, spot on!
---
Remember when they said they put spell batching into classic? Well now you know what it looks like
---
How important is taking Engineering for a Druid doing a mix of PvP and PvE (more of the former)? I’ve read that Eng is a “must” for PvPers but I’ve also read that Druids don’t really need it. I’m asking because I’ve always hated leveling Engineering and could only ever do it on one character. Seems like a big gold sink in Vanilla, too. I’d probably take Herbalism as well to try and fund it.
---
Apparently it's fine to change things when they suit you, but it's funny that you aren't willing to give an inch to anyone else even if it wouldn't affect you in the slightest. 
---
Your proposed changes would affect how others experience the game, but a lot of the proposed changes that the #nochange community seem determined to shut down wouldn't affect them at all.
---
This attitude of hostility just feels just as ridiculous and selfish to me.
---
I don't care what version of elite damage you guys want. I just wish you didn't care if I got a model toggle.
---
Talents are at level 10, its possible you confused the two.
---
&gt; unless you force epics on to every guild member &gt; force them to reroll proffs, it wont really be THAT much stacking
---
Majority of private server guilds already do this, there are always plenty enough members with enchanting. There absolutely will be THAT much stacking.
---
If something is exploitable, people _will_ exploit it.
---
It’s a huge achievement.
---
It would be cool if they did a micro event or something to bring this back.
---
that argument alway made me laugh...
---
on classic, if you have trouble with a dungeon, you CC every mob minus 1 and slowly tank-and-spank your way through. There's 0 challenge whatsoever.
---
on retail, if you want to time your key at the 15+ level you are pulling multiple groups at the same time, have to coordinate stuns on 4-5 different target, there's multiple frontal cone to be dodge, whirlwind to be stunned, affix to spice things up and modify your route every week...
---
On classic, as a priest healer I'm wanding 90% of the time. I really only use 1 healing spell ( 2, if you count I have 2 different ranks of it) and the whole depth of the class can be summed up to ''do i start healing at 50% or 40% HP?''.
---
on live, I have AoE healing, spot healing, external, massive cooldown, and 3-4 different heals to do on the main target, and I'm also expected to throw in some DPS in the midst of that.
---
How the heck are classic dungeon in any way shape or form harder than retail stuff? And haven'T we proved it time and times again by rushing through dungeons on beta? pulling group of 5 red-con elite and managing it?
---
Really just feel that the classic zealot simply couldn't keep up with modern WoW... or that they never tried anything above heroic dungeons.
---
No. I get that some people want it to be a perfect remake but I'm never going to support intentionally including bugs.
---
Thanks for the reply! Does Agility get translated into attack power in cat form, is it it purely for the crit hit chance?
---
I've heard people say str for the AP, or agi for more crit = more flurry = more windfury. Sorry for no definitive answer (: maybe theres more info here: Melderon's Shaman Guides: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg0pEiKvlmUOaMt1Bzh_jiXBGlrtrFO9n
---
As for PvP, imo spell dmg and alot of int is more important. Enh shaman should be played as an offensive support / healer. If you focus on str/agi only, you will be oom after just 3 shocks
---
What stat do paladins judgments scale off?
---
&gt; Need ~1500g for a lvl 19 think rouge within 2 months.
---
At that point instead of wasting time getting a few silvers here and there as a lvl 19 you're better off leveling a 2n'd char and farming mobs / mats in the higher level zones.
---
And you lived through that?!
---
Being a buffbot is bad design dude.
---
There is a reason people like TBC and Wrath, most specs were finished so that they at least could preform the role they existed for.
---
In Classic, Hunters and Warlocks are underpowered for PvE. That's a big problem.
---
Oh good, all the important stuff
---
Doesn't help you when you all die to AoE because you lack healing
---
Meet in durotar.
---
You are getting emotional, and you need to calm down.  
---
You don't have any valid points, and I have already addressed the fallacies.  First off, we aren't talking about worth.  That is subjective.   Secondly, your accusations that I am assuming " assuming that we as individuals cannot decide for ourselves" are completely baseless.   I have never once said anything like this.  You can determine the worth for yourself.
---
I will be playing classic, but I am under no disillusion that I am getting a "deal".   I know that I am being ripped off.  Now, if BFA appealed to me, then maybe you could argue that it's a "deal", but that isn't the case for me.   BFA is worth nothing to me, thus I will be paying $15 a month for classic, which is a ripoff for a remake that isn't getting content REAL updates.   
---
Just do the math... It's not hard.   There's about 1.5 years of content in classic.   $15 per month * 18 months = $270.   That's $270 for a remake of a game.  That's an insane ripoff.
---
You have misunderstood the wiki.
---
It's 3 months, relax.
---
I'd say in the first few clears hunters will be top DPS depending on faction.
---
1. Hunter 2-3-4. Mage / Warr / Rogue depending on raid comp
---
I played both in 2005-2008 and I liked vanilla better.  I did raid more in vanilla, and only raided t4 in TBC and a bit casually T5 though. RL caught up so I had less time, so maybe that influences my opinion.
---
holy pallies can handle all the blessings, why bring ret or prot?
---
And the 1 druid 1 warlock 10 fury warrior 10 rogue DPS setup isn't exactly a good example to follow...
---
Didn't feel so great. I spent 6 months at level 59 in an awesome pvp premade. Played over 6 hours a day. Opposing teams would afk when they saw us enter wsg or av.
---
Then one day someone decided to ding 60 and the group followed. I was the last and actually felt sad about the end of the premade. Best pvp in 14 years of wow.
---
honestly though on a wage so low, playing wow would be a pretty low priority for me
---
It's the people that has registered on the site in hopes of finding friends. Can't reaaaally say if all of them are going to roll the same faction this time around.
---
I'd just get to level 10 in your respective zones. Questlines can easily lead Undead players to The Barrens, so you'd organically meet there and play accordingly.
---
So you don't want changes but you want changes???
---
Is Bloodsail Buccaneers rep grind worth it?
---
Kek
---
Sorry, but the first point seems incredibly childish and small minded to me. This isn't really an issue... provided you can just act like an adult and not be an asshole.
---
If your co-worker/classmate/friend is bad at the game then you can be an actual awesome human beeing by trying to help them get better. That's the kind of camaraderie that builds strong communites, and made Vanilla into the awesome experience it was for a lot of people. 
---
Not just ignoring the *scrubs*, talking shit about them behind their backs and letting them run around for themselves, dying to quest mobs because they don't know what gear to equip or which abilities to use. We helped the poor bastards to become better, because the more decent players there are, the better the game is for everyone else.
---
And from a selfish perspective: being a mentor/teacher to a friend or co-worker, and watching them improove over time is an absolutely amazing experience. And it comes at an incredibly low personal cost to you. You're playing the game anyways. Just take couple minutes here and there while your standing around looking awesome in Orgrimmar, to teach a newbie about the auction house or showing them the way to their class trainer. Show them how awesome the WoW community is capable of being. It'll make you feel like way more of an actual hero than turning in a quest to an NPC ever will.
---
And if not, at least be honest and tell them that they need to get better before you feel comfortable bringing them along for group content. Being told the truth is way less hurtful than feeling that you're being avoided.
---
"you also realize inflation isn’t a thing in vanilla. You don’t have people with millions of gold"
---
There will be an inflation in vanilla as time goes on, there aren't enough gold sink to prevent it.
---
Once a player learn all his spells and buy his mount, what's left ? Repair costs and a few max level quests ?
---
You guys really think this is a deal?  Stop lying to yourselves.
---
It’s a form of entertainment just like anything else that costs money and it hasn’t changed in price in 15 years. At least in USD terms.
---
Can’t enjoy wow unless you feel superior to somebody, it’s part of recreating that vanilla mindset.
---
&gt; Is priest hard to level solo?
---
Not hard, no.
---
&gt; I don't want it to be a sucky ride to 60.
---
That's a slightly different discussion. Priest is probably the 3rd worst class when it comes to leveling speed. It's not hard it's just slow and boring.
---
The horde only got so big after blood elves. and those are just all the alliance people who wanted to be high elves but couldn't
---
It's even higher for EU due to the € to $ changes
---
Rather have them ninja loot there than ninja prebis stuff in 50+ dungs tbh
---
That's kinda what I thought.  One thing I hadn't really considered but might explain (at least some) of the dungeon difficulty "issue" is that in vanilla (and I assume in launch) there isn't really a level-30 meta.  People aren't looking for and hunting down level-30 BiS the way they are in beta.  You run the dungeons with the shit gear you find while leveling and that would add to the challenge significantly.
---
Cognitive dissonance from what BFA players? i don't ever see anything negative said about classic wow on the main reddit or ingame BFA, but everytime i come here every post talks about how BFA players are shitting on classic. where?
---
Why would you need to second it?
---
there's no need for Frost gear until sapphiron, and all the frost resist gear good enough for sapphiron comes from naxx craftable... so that's not an issue.
---
fire gear is really just 2-3 juicy piece for rag /vael, you don't need a full set.
---
So really you are looking at 2-3 FR piece, 6-7 NR piece for huhuran and viscidious, and maybe a shadow set for warlocks ( twin emp).
---
that still leave a lot of room for the 35 other people on your raid.
---
Depends entirely what you define as "content". Many would argue that the game right now suffers from "current patch" seasonal culture right now, meaning everything behind that patch is just left behind and doesn't really count. Just because molten core is still in the game doesn't mean I'd consider it riveting or even tangible content.
---
It had more depth and a bit more variety. I also do 99% arenas so in excited for bc.
---
I don't like flying mounts tho.
---
None of those will work in Classic since it's using the modern amcro system.
---
It's just their intended power by blizz based on the loot tables, not their real difficulty
---
This one hits home hard. I miss Vanilla Combat so bad. Combat daggers for life.
---
That would be ideal, I was just giving a different perspective on something I saw earlier today about the expensive subscription price. 
---
Overall, whether you play Classic WoW, Retail, or both. You’re paying 30% less than you were 15 years ago. 
---
Most of us were so young that we probably didn’t even pay for it. Our parents did. I know mine did.
---
It is bad. You are trying to argue with someone who basically solo dual boxed warriors in the last decade on priv servers. If you want to play priest warrior do so. Nothing is stopping you. Saying that warrior priest both objectively and overall is bad is no exagartion. It is bad. Both are slow levelers with huge downtimes. Yes priest heal leverages that, but they won't be killing anything that much faster unlike w+p or w+s.
---
Anyways im done arguing about trivial stuff like that.
---
Bullshit. Get out.
---
If Classic WoW doesn’t revive the genre, they might just do that.
---
you forget loot trading (meeeeeh), unless there is a limitation that you can't trade with people who were not in the raid when the item dropped?
---
Would be so easy to invite an alt just after the boss encounter, trade him the item to be DE later and invite back the previous raider.  
---
This being said, I remember back in the day we had so many items that ended up DE (oh no, drood item again!), not sure nexus crystal should be in so high demand anyway
---
Loot council with hidden DKP is my preferred way. The hidden DKP helps out to show who are dedicated and if there is a drop which is BIS for 2 "dedicated" players... the DKP will show who should get it.
---
[citation needed]
---
Erf MC yes, BWL? uh i think you need more than that o_O.
---
Just a bunch of bad horde players.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8URSUWm0
---
And we need a "different feel" because...?
---
When a new player rolls a warlock, do you think they were thinking to themselves 'Aww yeah, I'm gonna give so many healing pots and summon so many people to reduce travel time!'?
---
They were probably thinking 'I can't wait to deal mad damage with my spells, summon a bunch of demons, and make all the bad guys die!'.
---
Sure, warlocks brought unique things no one else can bring, but so do rogues, so why do warlocks need to be so much worse than rogues?
---
That's not even getting into hybrid classes...
---
14% of base mana sounds like a lot, but you also have to remember int gave more mana, so in practice it was a pretty small amount of your mana bar. But mana was still a pretty finite resource so you couldnt do nothing but dispell.
---
i thought you couldnt train swords till lvl 10 - at least it was so in the pservers
---
You're wrong. Inflation has increased but in the US wages have not. Compared to other goods and services it's cheaper, but compared to how much Americans can afford it's exactly the same.
---
They are used for Fire Protection Potion.
---
You have to farm LBRS for the recipe for Greater Fire Protection Potion.
---
We're planning a week one Rag kill and have one guy who's only job is to get to 25, fish these, and make the pots.
---
Yeah, eventually they'll be overtaken by the Greater version, but not at first.
---
No, that's 20€ for two months.
---
You only need a active sub.
---
Spawn this in during the next streamer clusterfuck on the stress test.

i really hope they bring it back ... i hear the cdc uses the 9original outbreak as a simulation of apedemics in real ecosystems
---
Also you could macro it so you equip the staff, use taunt, then go back to your usual staff
---
You just need an active sub. That’s all.
---
Can’t deny the facts. 
---
$15 in 2004, is equal to around $19.50 in today’s terms. Inflation sucks, but that’s how our monetary system works. It all started in the 1930s. Look up “Quantitive Easing”. 
---
Lucky for us, Blizzard hasn’t changed the price in 15 years.
---
Gets even cheaper from there, with the different tier of subscriptions. Which hasn’t changed too.
---
What’s the point of wanting the beta when everything you did in it is going to be undone when the game actually releases?
---
these (Barrens Chat servers,Vanilla Friends stats) are not representative in any way.
---
faction imbalance will definitely gonna be an issue since blizzard isn't doing anything about it.
---
in B&amp;S for example once a faction went ahead of the other they would just stop recruitment for that faction until they would even out.
---
Doubtful. They have never banned buyers in the past.
---
I dont know much about engineering but I think you'd want to take mining with it instead of herbalism
---
I will bet anyone 1 BTC straight up that classic will have more active players after a year
---
Well, as a matter of a fact, I'm actually really nice.
---
I think i remember reading some where that they said they are considering bringing it back for a day or 2. Ill look for the post now.
---
As others have said, you only need an active subscription. There's no "buying all the other expansions" anyway. When a new expansion comes out, the previous one gets folded into the subscription. To play all of Retail, you only need BFA.
---
It is subjective but you seem totally incapable of understanding that. Because I am fine with the price, I'm part of a circlejerk and cannot comprehend that it's a rip-off. That's your angle, and it's just wrong. End of story, were done here. And no, your edits do not serve to make me look stupid. They make you look insecure and unsure of what exactly it is you're trying to argue.
---
That and the fact that you'll still be playing is fucking hilarious. And if anyone needs to calm down it's you. You're literally doubting things and going back and changing multiple comments to makesure they are "perfect", pointing out fallacies while making a slew of assumptions yourself in the process. Yiiiikes dude. Yikes.
---
Peace out man, have fun jerking other people around on your crusade.
---
I think the joke is that he’s never gotten a raise? Which is pretty sad
---
They directly profit from gold being harder to obtain through gameplay. If you're asking for a source where they admit this, it obviously doesn't exist. It isn't exactly hard to figure out yourself.
---
I know you don’t want it, but druids are going to tank all content whether you like it or not. Your opinion will stop no one from playing what they truly want
---
Yeah, but you need some barrier for xfers so that people don't just jump servers for no reason.
---
Good to know, thanks
---
Also, a great example of either how PvP servers are incredibly amazing, or a total shitfest that maybe you want to avoid. Depends on your mindset.
---
... I want MY change.
---
I can’t speak for the other classes, but I don’t see anything bad about ret paladins, I always felt they always pressed a few buttons in their rotation.
---
Chromaggus would be a good and proper pain in the butt but you just got to make sure you keep the other debuffs low so nobody gets transformed.
---
The curse of Nefarian has a short duration so its survivable without decurse, although it's far from optimal :D
---
Troll for PVE.
---
I plan on playing a feral Druid for my first toon. As of now I’m gonna run mining/skinning and save all the mats in the bank. Once at 60 I’m gonna drop skinning for engineering and max that and then drop mining for LW and then man that
---
Sadly
---
Best gathering profession for making gold? I believe I did mining in Vanilla and it paid well enough... better or worse than Herbalism?
---
“Properly” scripted private servers all inherent have spell batching because it’s a vanilla WoW client
---
Have we been told if the realm names will be the same as vanilla?
---
Okay, so no evidence to your conspiracy theory then.
---
What class has a spec that is the optimal singular spec in both PVE and PVP? For example, I'd like to roll a warlock but SL spec is not good in PVE. 
---
If I wanted a good class that has a good spec that works for both, what would you suggest?
---
We are here if you need us &lt;3
---
Diablo sure is fun.
---
Did they remove him in retail?
---
I asked them and they said both no. What now?
---
Hes an inexperienced, angry young man. It's like trying to explain to a kid why he cant eat ice cream every day.
---
This argument needs to die. There was an entire continent of players that had good internet connections in 2004.
---
Q
---
What if we allow crits that double crit etc? If similar mechanics were introduced for other % stats it could be an effective way to keep scaling up without needing to "reset" by having a new bracket.
---
After spending many years on pve servers then doing a realm change to pvp. I can safely say pvp servers always. Dont mind that much if I get ganked. Also super satisfying when you get ambushed and you manage to clutch that 1v3
---
Warrior will give a fuck if they get hit multiple time in a row that remove the shield block charge and cause them to get crush/crit (and it will be a higher hit than on druid because less effective health).
---
Also if a druid do not use swipe (which is only 10% more threat), he will only do 1 attack every 2.5sec, at worse that mean getting 2 hit in a row with parry hasting.
---
The more you play, the more you save.
---
I'm so hungry I could ride a horse!
---
Man, as expected, you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Wages have definitely been increasing. Same with good and services. Same with the amount of USD in circulation. It has to, it’s how it works.
---
I'm planning on playing a Hunter. I kind of like the idea of going gnomish to get all the items I need then switch to goblin.
---
Touché 👍
---
Do you plan on playing classic, or do you just like hanging out in this sub to shit on classic?
---
It literally does not feel broken at all. I am in the beta, and there are many things that do feel broken (some of which you can find in my post history), but spell batching is not one of them. The "average player" won't even notice the difference between classic and live in that aspect.
---
And just to be clear, if we're talking about the Esfand clip in OP, that shit still happens in BFA ALL THE TIME despite the faster spell processing. Shit, sometimes I will disengage like 20 yards before the ground and still die.
---
Everyone has and hasn’t 😏
---
Same! Except it was a lifestone and it most certainly didn’t sell for 800g.
---
According the National Average Wage Index, yes. 36% from 2005-2017.

---
Private servers are free so you can have as much bank space as you want.
---
I think it depends. The Alliance are already at the Barrens which is the location of the next duel area..
---
If you have limited time, I'd usually lean to recommend people to PvE. You got 3 hours to play a day, you dont want to spend 1.5 hours of it fending off the other faction. Will dramatically slow down leveling.
---
Also depends on your goals. I am torn because I have no plans to push Rank 14, I don't really enjoy losing hours to getting ganked (Difference to me between fair World PvP and just 60 Rogue's camping your ass until you log out)
---
A few days ago I found this (link below). For sure all these charts base on data from private servers, so this is not a reliable source of data, but since we don't have anything better :/
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
oh sorry, i forgot people on this sub didn't like it when we talk about the vanilla server of any other game, minus runescape...
---
Excuse me for disturbing your echo chamber.
---
Pole arm is level 10 and 1g, right?
---
&gt; you forget loot trading (meeeeeh), unless there is a limitation that you can't trade with people who were not in the raid when the item dropped?
---
Loot trading has never allowed people to trade a BoP item to someone that did not participate in the kill of the mob that dropped said item, so no that won't happen.
---
&gt; Night elf lacks paladin, mage and warlock. I don't think you could pull it off. Blessings will be too important, especially if you have no casters and thus need much more melee DPS.
---
Night Elf lacks warrior, too!
---
Makes total sense alliance, atleast the servers I played back in vanilla, always had about a 5-10% advantage it terms of players. So since so many people are looking to coming back the ratios could be really similar to what they were 15 or so years ago.
---
The horde are a bunch of whiny babes. What’s new?
---
Was elite mob damage reduced in 1.12?
---
Nope. AQ patch. Go look at allakhazam’s archives, the oldest comments are dated January 4 2006 and the AQ patch dropped a day earlier.
---
That is the most succinct and straightforward way to understand this concept. Very well done!
---
Also in hope your name is related to dogfish head.
---
so is 1999's everquest dungeon crawling with single-digit APM to achieve optimal efficiency...
---
Only for vendor / AH cost reduction and prestige i think
---
Actually it's not a big problem. Hunters (and to a lesser extent locks) are still essential because of the utility they bring. Why does it matter how much pure dps they do? And in PvP, both are feared gods in the hand of a skilled player.
---
It's balanced imbalance.
---
Should be yeah. The only limiting factor is going to be your monthly bandwidth allotment if you have any or if your carrier is pulling some  net neutrality shaninigans.
---
&gt; 80% of Vanille Vets did not join st 1.12 but earlier.
---
I' be willing to bet that the large majority of people who will be playing classic in 3 months never actually played vanilla. Classic WoW isn't being just for people who happened to play Vanilla.
---
DM was Dire Maul in vanilla. Deadmines was VC.
---
Would it be worth hopping on pservers to mess around with some classes to see what I would like? Also how do you get access to those?
---
Lol
---
&gt; and cannot comprehend that it's a rip-off. That's your angle, and it's just wrong. 
---
It's not wrong.   
---
Secondly, the cost of Classic is NOTHING compared to the cost of developing it, maintaining it, and creating content updates for it for Vanilla.  
---
So, it cost you exactly the same as it did before, yet it cost blizzard only a small fraction of what it Vanilla did.   That is by definition a ripoff.
---
Yep, Classic is far more about time investment than ability...however I would actually put that forward as a benefit for Classic.
---
In BFA if you want to get the most out of your character, you need to be doing really quite hard stuff and it's a barrier to a lot of players. My wife would never be able to hang with me in BFA for example, the skill and knowledge required to run even M5+ content is just not going to be something she'd have fun with. Too high stress, too high paced. In Vanilla I can't think of any dungeon she wouldn't enjoy running with me though. Maybe I'd have to pull a little slower or we'd need to focus on CC a bit better to keep the healing fairly low key...but we'd still complete the run and still get the exact same gear and drops as a group blowing through it in 1/3 the time.
---
Same goes for raiding in Vanilla. Zero chance my wife would enjoy Mythic in BFA, but I could see her having a good time even on the more demanding encounters like CThun or Razorgore.
---
So in a weird way, Vanilla was less casual friendly when it came to time commitment, but a lot more casual friendly when it came to skill requirement.
---
Depends what you're doing in game. Just questing? Maybe 100mb/hour. Sitting in org or a raid? A lot more.
---
Groups and raids. Yeah, I know I'm gonna heal in those but I'm afraid doing anything out of raids with that gear will be painful. So yeah, I suppose I should have gear for both.
---
No it wasn’t. Deadmines was DM before Dire Maul was even in the game. People who say VC are TBC tards
---
I loved TBC and Wrath. Honestly they were more fun than Vanilla in my opinion. That’s just my opinion though!
---
What I love about the release of Vanilla is seeing all of the people who have come out and voiced love for the first three expansions. It reaffirms that I’m not the only one who felt like Cata ruined the game. 
---
Even if we only get Vanilla, I’m happy to have been able to relived one of the three greats. Probably will find my way to a private TBC server after I’ve progressed through classic enough. I imagine a large number of people will do the same.
---
Level 12 noob here. At what point do I start seeing chests in the world? I'm keeping my eyes peeled and havent seen any yet. I watched summ1g find like 3 in an hour the other night around level 20
---
It's so much faster to do BGs over random kills that's its barely even comparable.
---
The only limiting factor is queue times. Once you start getting queue times of 30min plus the random kills may be higher per hour, but you still queue as much as possible and just kill as you wait.
---
Once AV comes out, if your server can organise 8min games, which there's almost no reason you won't be able to. That dwarves every other form of honor gain even when the other BGs have their bonus weekend.
---
Having done this myself while working away the only issue would be updates, playing the game hardly ate into my allowance.
---
How did you not detect the sarcasm?
---
Yes people raid on PvP servers too.
---
Oh yeah, forgot he was in that lol thanks; it was on the tip of my tongue
---
He hasnt. Making 20 dollars an hour in 2004 and now again in 2019
---
No one would ever choose to raid Molten Core if it weren't a source of loot. It's total dog-shit. It only makes sense people are going to be really concerned about loot when getting loot from Molten Core is a necessary step to actually being able to enjoy other parts of the game, it's time consuming, and not much loot drops per run. 
---
The difference is retail raids are actually super fun on the whole, Blizzard hasn't released a raid below a B in a long time. Raiding with alts for fun is totally a thing. 
---
So yeah, this meme is literally the other way around. Classic players have a reason to be worked up about loot, whereas retail players can play with whatever group-size they want, with whatever classes they want, on content that is fun, so retail players are going to be more chill and mostly looking for fun.
---
World record is 2 weeks, speed run, that's if you know all the best quests and grinds.
---
In your case 4 weeks if you don't know anything.
---
I was just asking a question? Which is still out there if you want to answer it.
---
When Asmon breezed through SM Gy, library, and even armory, that group wasn’t fully BiS at all. They had some good pieces for sure but they were missing a lot.
---
People are also just ignoring how bad they were at the time.
---
Pservers are off sure but I've tanked SM Cath and Armory at 32 on multiple pservers. I even tanked Cath at 34 on retail vanilla on a tauren warrior. I have no doubt that a group of lvl 30's in basically the best gear they can get with people who are knowledgeable with the best gear they can get could do Cath easy!  
---
The only leveling dungeons I recall ever being a serious issue for groups that are on the low end of the level range are Gnomer, and Ulda. That was also before talent changes, weapon normalization, and any changes that came after 1.2 (that's the patch i was doing them in). A bunch of 40's doing the last boss in Ulda was tough. Same with Gnomer a bunch of lvl 30's doing it was tough as well. Could be for lots of reasons though, maybe we all sucked. Our gear may not have been good/great. No way of knowing what everyone's spec was then either.
---
Ultimately vanilla wasn't that hard. Most people playing it then had no prior mmo experience. That changes a lot. Any seasoned mmo vet going into Vanilla did not ever think it was hard while leveling.
---
Why would you drop engineering when you need engineering to wield/use/equip most of the gadgets and trinkets?
---
WoW Classic, or There and Back Again
---
yeah doing that wastes you so much time compared to teleporting out
---
Streamed by tipsout? Guess he needed an excuse to not participate and get roflstomped.
---
I’m not dropping engineering Lol
---
Since druids have a lot more armor than a warrior tank a crushing blow on a druid will not be more than a normal attack on a warrior tank
---
The Earth Ele boss [Can't remember his name atm, at work] that had the ability that allowed him to bypass all armor and cause crushing blows even to tanks unless it was tranqed because it was technically an enrage I believe.
---
My server is full of people who like to trash on Classic.
---
lol
---
We can settle this in Azeroth
---
To be fair, this is part of the flaw of a PvP realm. If they could duel in the main city it would be better.
---
The Alliance are trying to bait into getting attacked, but the Alliance streamers can't control the randos in beta who don't listen, and same for the Horde.
---
ah ok, I played vanilla and never used the regular ones, I guess we had enough of the greater ones , we had some pretty hardcore guild members  from the start so I guess they got those recipes from lbrs early on.  I remember going to the un goro vulcano a lot for the elemental fire because arathi highlands was always farmed heavily
---
I understand it can be frustrating. But I think of it as just another part of the game, it makes the fact theres faction war going on alot more immersive. I dont really favourite horde or alliance. But whatever side my char is on I will attack the other faction without a second thought. Love it.
---
One last thing that no one talks about (you kinda mention via powerscaling):
---
**Short pvp fights!**
---
The fact that you can die in 3 seconds if you encounter the wrong foe at the wrong time - and likewise eliminate someone in a flash if you play it right. That makes pvp vastly more fun for me. When cata came out and suddenly everyone had 100k+ health and self-heals PVP felt brutal, all consuming, and futile. If I run into a group of 5 enemies as a hunter, I should die immediately, not run in circles for 30seconds soaking up hits.
---
On top of that, killing a tank or healer alone became impossible (I was never geared after WotLK). Every fight shouldn’t come down to attrition. Show me the lightening fast battles where every split second decision and timing counts!!
---
Was VC on the server Kel'Thuzad.
---
Wisdom of the ancients. There are mice with more neurons in their brain than you dude. You've finally come to the conclusion that you disagree with my statement, which is okay, but haven't realized that everything you said previously has nothing to do with it. You might be an "old man" but you still have a bit of growing to do.
---
Biggest problems with TBC were:
---
1) New maps on different world
---
2) Flying
---
3) Arena and PvP gear
---
4) Shaman/Pally available to both side
---
Okay, how come? Isn’t worth it towards end game raiding?
---
interesting this is good I like this.  Maybe go 1h shield trying to hold aggro with rockbiter and earth shock (downranking for mana) and maybe even go down resto for more mana regen/healing.
---
There isn't a reason to play EQ when WoW exists. WoW killed Everquest, so it makes sense that EQ server would be so empty. Runescape is in a different genre of MMO, so the two games can coexist.
---
The competition is way more numerous than it was 14 years ago, and they have a fraction of the subs they had a decade ago.  I think if anything the reason their price has stayed stable is due to that \*loss\* of market share.  They're not just competing with the other mmos at a $15 price point, but the hundreds that ditched the pure subscription model for freemium/p2w models.  When you consider the cash shop, I would be surprised if, averaged across users, the actual average cost per subscriber hasn't gone up even accounting for inflation.
---
Now, you may argue that since you can still get the base experience for $15/month and that the cash shop doesn't affect that, because it's optional, you're not paying for it.  You're still paying for it in loss of experience, however.  The community has gone.  Customer service is gone.  The depth of gameplay is gone.  The game is much smaller than it was 15 years ago because it has been condensed to an ever shrinking endgame on a semiannual release schedule, and while it is still technically possible to go back and complete older content in some form, it is not remotely the same experience.  The current game is indeed a lot like a big mac.
---
The big mac of today is cheaper than the Big Mac we grew up with.    But it's also much, much smaller, with much cheaper ingredients.  To say that means we're getting the same product for a cheaper price is to ignore the concept of value , which is, in effect, the entire purpose of currency in the first place
---
Most of them are BoP. You're not going to get a thousand BoEs which need to get in order to actually run out of bank alts on your officers.
---
The horde is still growing and has for many years. More or less all of the best guilds/players play horde. 
---
Blood elves was only the start. The top guilds switched at some point due to racials I think. And since then never had a reason to switch back, and more and more people then follow them.
---
Not if you haven't played Vanilla since it was current or at all. Then I think you should wait til launch and enjoy exploring it completely new.
---
Stop talking talking out of your ass.
---
I agree but I found the less frequent raiders were the worst.
---
In a flat DKP system players that used to raid regularly or currently raid now and again will naturally build up DKP, whilst players that raid consistently are likely to have low DKP due to regularly spending it.
---
This meant in Vanilla I had a player that raided literally once or twice a month outbid me on a tier piece and win. I was also the highest performing player of my class and attended all raids, so it felt super motivating.
---
DKP is like the shotgun rule of loot systems, some guild/raid leaders like it because it takes the decision out of their hands and allows them to hold their hands up and say "sorry I'm just following the rules"
---
A lot of the custom DKP systems seem to require even more administrator than just having BIS lists submitted and then running a loot council.  I've seen people claiming Loot Councils are corrupt but I have never experienced this, whilst I have experienced glaring issues with DKP multiple times. Another being people not bidding because they want to "save" they DKP for another item, which again needs further admin work to stamp out.
---
I'd argue good loot lists are even more valuable in Vanilla/Classic when you had things like fast ranged weapons, where the hunter was generally not the most appropriate person to receive drop. I believe the mail helm from Ragnaros was really good for DPS warriors, whilst hunters had better options as another example.
---
My experience with loot councils is they help to teach people to be less selfish, whilst DKP often does the opposite, alongside having to counter all the ways people will game whichever variant of DKP you adopt.
---
They are speeding through. People thought Asmon would wipe in Deadmines in part because it’s much harder on pservers. In fact, in beta you don’t have to stop for a drink the entire dungeon. On pservers you have to stop every 2-3 pulls or more.
---
So "shitting on people" to you is people stating facts?
---
Herbalism/Alchemy. Steady source of making gold while always being useful to yourself as well
---
I think they should make dungeons harder... #nochanges usually refers to Vanilla as a whole, not individual patches (the hashtag probably existed before we knew it would be based on 1.12?) ...
---
That won't be a fair bet to make on its own.  It depends heavily on where retail is in its development.  Was there a major content patch just dropping or is it the end of an xpac and the subs are naturally dropping waiting for the next one to release.
---
I don't need it, but others might enjoy it.  As I picture this, it would tax the rich a bit more and spread that to the poor, because the rich would use more of the gold sink.   If that means the randoms I group with are slightly richer (= more likely to have purchased the right skills)  I wouldn't be against it.
---
On Alliance side the first ones spawn in Duskwood and other Level 20 places. I think Deadmines is where most see them first.
---
they dont want ppl to feel the need to rush the mounts
---
yea because classic is absolutley not about exclusive rare stuff
---
by that logic we need to skip the aq event too, because ppl will feel the need to rush the event to be able to participate. but hey its 1.12 and the gates are open already in 1.12 so everything is correct
---
Wage arent keeping up with inflation so it's not 30% cheaper. Unless you're a billionaire.
---
Not only, it's actually a good [reference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index) to compare the cost of life everywhere, since McDonald's has presence in many countries.
---
**Big Mac Index**
---
The Big Mac Index is published by The Economist as an informal way of measuring the purchasing power parity (PPP) between two currencies and provides a test of the extent to which market exchange rates result in goods costing the same in different countries. It "seeks to make exchange-rate theory a bit more digestible".The index, created in 1986, takes its name from the Big Mac, a hamburger sold at McDonald's restaurants.
---
In 2018, McDonald's, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Big Mac, issued a currency named MacCoin. Each MacCoin was redeemable for one Big Mac and could not be converted into cash by the restaurant.

There's a whole bunch of reasons, which we spoke to Halwin and Sams about when they first launched the website. Originally the tool was a google sheet that was linked from a post here on the Subreddit, we did originally sticky that because it was a product of this community, and so heavily tied into this community, and since it became a website we've continued to try and support it, however we have not stickied it because: 
---
1. We can only ever have two stickies. Juggling our ability to host megathreads and the weekly stickies is nearly always the reason we don't sticky something. Having vanillafriends.com stickied all the time means we can only ever have 1 sticky - either no rotating discussions, or no megathreads, and no news stickied, on the occasions we get to host something like an AMA, we'd have to unsticky things. Things start to get messy if there's big news that we'd like to sticky, and an AMA we'd like to host at the same time, or if we want to do a state of the subreddit post and host a megathread at the same time. All of these push the weekly posts out of the way - with only one free sticky slot we do not have weekly posts. 
---
2. We had a lot of concerns about linking directly to a website (and clearly endorsing it, in the form of a sticky) that had intentions for a merchandise store and was openly asking for donations. This wasn't a matter of consensus, and a lot of us had very varied opinions on that front, but those against it felt we would be doing the community a disservice to link so directly to what might be construed as a business. As of late that's less of a concern for most of us, but we still do not allow links directly to merch stores (excepting Blizzard's, if its relevant to Classic) or posts saying 'I work for commission'. 
---
3. We did not believe the website needed a sticky post to stand on its own two feet, however we have continued to try and support the website, more passively, in several ways. 
---
Halwin, Sams, and Roddeh all have custom flair to try and passively promote the website, and when we spoke to Halwin and Sams at the time of the websites launch we encouraged them to feel free to repost a link to the website once a month so that it would continue to be visible to newcomers to the subreddit. They did for a while, but these days they don't tend to bother as normally someone has already linked it far more recently than a month. 
---
We've also included it in the [Community Resources &amp; Information](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/discords) list on our wiki, which is linked in the sidebar.
---
TL:DR: We try to support it as much as we can, but we can only have two stickies and we need them.
---
Cool idea, great job!
---
I totally agree. This is the reality we have to live with, not just with WoW, but with all things that are affected by inflation.
---
Playing on a PvP server is identical to a PvE server when it comes to raids and general pve. You may have to corpserun to the raids though ;)
---
No, it's not. It's actually not the definition of a rip-off.
---
We know what we're getting, better than anything before. We know what we want and we are more than comfortable with buying it. It's as clear as day.
---
I'm not going from list of the slew of actual ripoffs that are committed in gaming, including retail WoW, where you pay for unknowns and "future" things that you hope for. I don't need to. If you know exactly what the product is and you think the pricing is fair then it's not a rip-off. It's fine if it is for you, then we've just reached an impasse. You can't measure everything in how much a sever costs or how much work is done, of which you know nothing about but love pointing out, but even if you could it doesn't matter
---
I mean, they did say the alliance could come watch. They all stood in a line and did nothing. Because they could t attack. As long as the duellers didn’t PvP flag everything would be fine.
---
But all the whiny babies on the horde started crying. And still are, sodapoppins stream is pure gold. Never seen someone so salty.
---
I would personally like to compete for top DPS, as this is class locked that decision is something that is important to me, hence the question.
---
Every time i hear Thralls "ENOUGH OF THIS!!!" i swear, i get such a hard on its not even funny...
---
Legendary.
---
Just saying the current game is Diablo not WoW.  Mythic dungeons are a way to create artificial difficulty with zero content being added.  Hence diablo rifts, affixes on the monsters ECT.  For example Strat in vanilla is a speed test, but it actually comes with some sort of tangible reward and a cohesive story.  That is the difference between WoW vanilla and WoW Diablo.
---
Do a quick google search
---
Pservers like K1 were more Blizzlike and people complained that it was too easy, while Nost was overtuned to better emulate the Vanilla experience and became more popular. 
---
So pservers learned from their mistakes over time, basically. I don’t know why we want to repeat these mistake in Classic.
---
Lots of people roll on the PvP servers because of the world pvp that can be had that’s not really a thing on PvE servers. Other than the having to flag for combat if you’re on a PvE server, there’s no difference and there are plenty of people on PvP servers that only PvE and do raids.
---
Roll a warlock. They're strong in pvp so when you're rolling pve spec you'll still be good.
---
It's not just minimum that's important chief
---
Furthermore, it's only costing Blizz a small fraction to make the remastered game as it cost them to make the original.  The cost of servers has gone way down too.   
---
In 2004 we paid blizzard $60 for the base game, and we were paying Blizzard $15 a month for content updates.  There's no content updates in Classic, so what is it you think you are paying for now?
---
Both sides are part of the problem. There are still Alliance standing in the dueling area (Probably randos, no streamer can control that) same for if a Rando horde attacks Alli trying to spark the war.
---
There is a reason some popular streamers are going PvE, to avoid shit like this (Seems pretty split on big streamers going PvE vs PvP server)
---
1 year into Classic is roughly when a new expansion hits, seems like poor timing for that bet.
---
Private servers are not really any easier which leads to a better experience. It’s more engaging when you have to face the threat of wiping. 
---
Why do we have to accept that the game is going to be easier?
---
Yea inflation has risen but wages have not, so this point is moot and invalid. It’s not ‘cheaper’ if your wages haven’t increased with inflation, In fact because so many peoples wages have not increased with inflation their cost-of-living is much higher and so in a fact the subscription now costs more because they have less disposable income
---
If that is true, awesome. All that has to be done then, is to decrease the batching from 400ms to something appropriate 100-150ms and nobody will complain and there will still be some interactions
---
Hi, /u/Undoer
---
Some of the early heroics were pretty difficult (HoL and UP come to mind), and even some of the later ones (HoR was insane when figuring out the strats. I loved it though). Leveling was exceptionally easier as every class had either increased regen (I think that was only at early levels though) and self healing (victory rush for warrior iirc m). LFD changed the landscape a lot. I think GearScore left the worst taste in my mouth. Overall I loved WOTLK, but you could see the design philosophy shift away from classic rpg combat towards modern button mashing. Also tank threat pretty much didn’t matter until you got to the highest echelon of players (which was fun, but made other stuff a bit trivial). PvP was a bit of a nightmare at first with death knights and Ret paladins being overtuned.
---
These are just my issues with WOTLK, but don’t take that as I didn’t like it. I really, truly loved that expansion. It just had some issues that needed fixing imo. But ICC will always be my favorite raid, maybe second to ZG.
---
Alright sensei 🙏🏻
---
According to your [Social Security website,](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/central.html)
---
 average wages increased from $35,448.93 in 2005 to $48,251.57 in 2017.
---
I don't know what kind of weird math you learned as a child, but forty eight thousand is, in fact, greater than thirty five thousand.
---
There are definitely pros to both.
---
But if someone takes off a week from work, they may want to strictly level and not deal with that.
---
(I forgot, are server transfers a thing? It could be worth to spend $30 to xfer once you hit max.)
---
A lot of people want to get "most of the work" out right on launch and such during their vacation time
---
Expect to be ganked mercilessly while leveling
---
Character looks good for 60 era
---
Which is still fun though.
---
\#nochanges thing is fucking bullshit and people who use it are hypocrites. No changes? That means day 1 release state.
---
I'm actually going to max cooking and fishing this time.  I never did even though i played all of vanilla.
---
Save up items for DE. Then when the 'phase' that drops and allows Nexus crystals to comes around you can mass disenchant them.
---
You could go with blacksmithing and make ret gear. With a free mount you also have a good chance to spend some gold on making the best pieces and have some solid gear for soloing.
---
The only difference between a PvP server and a PvE server is that you can be attacked by people of the opposing faction freely while questing, while on a PvE server you have to allow or disallow it by toggling /pvp
---
Troll master race!
---
Like an expansion perhaps ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I got an ultrawide 3440x1440 at 100Hz for WoW and I couldn't be happier. It has a lot of screen space for the UI and add-ons, and the resolution bump makes the game gorgeous. The 100Hz is the cherry on top, since it makes the whole experience smoother!
---
I remember wiping through Blackfathom Depths for countless times. The low-lvl dungeons were pretty difficult before 1.12, especially when grouping with randoms and without voicechat.
---
Yeah, i agree. I mean, it was absolutely fine being a casual in vanilla. You didn't look great, you didn't get everything handed easily for you. But it was fucking great. You could log in and have fun, and meaningful social interactions.
---
The thing many don't understand is that **vanilla wasn't unfriendly to casuals, just to entlitled little shits**. A true casual, someone who lacks the time and will to put any massive effort into pve, pvp or whatever, someone who just wants to play now and then without commitment, **just to have a good time**, could do just that and unlike retail did indeed had a great time because the way the game and the world was designed made it fun. Logging in a few casual hours meant immersive, even therapeutic, experiences enjoying the world and the community.
---
Now having a good time **is not** the same as being handed purple loot, mounts, titles, achievements, cookies and whatnot.
---
There is ofc a public that wants artifitial gratification. That wants to feel powerful and awesome for absolutely no reason other than paying a subscription. And that's fine, there are games designed for these cravings. Retail went quite a bit into that direction.
---
And regarding being in auto-pilote: YES! One of the great things about the classic design, as many pointed out, is that the story is mostly your story in the game. The friends you made, the things that happened to you. People who played vanilla always have a ton of stories to tell. But retail took a different route, where you're guided through everything, the journey is error-free, choice-free, and you don't need others. What results: you don't have a story to tell. You didn't live, you were just a passenger.
---
Again, it all comes to different game designs.
---
Troll.
---
Pretty much agreed - our lack of knowledge, lack of gear, and lack of skill while playing retail vanilla make up most of the difficulty people (including myself) remember.
---
I was an absolute moron while leveling in vanilla.  There was some class-essential ability that I just didn't even bother with (judgements, maybe?  I wish I could remember because it was an epic facepalm when I realized it).  It wasn't until 60 until I finally started to learn my class with some level of competence.
---
I just brought up the level 30 meta gear point because I don't see it often and I think it's probably an overlooked factor in what people see as "easy" dungeons for the streamers.
---
2% inflation over 15 years is closer to 35% than 30%, since its multiplicative. Also you cant just substract the inflation like it was a net loss. 100% inflation doesnt mean you lost 100% of your money. It means your money is only worth half now. If you have 1000$ in your bank account and an inflation of 30% takes place, this means that 1300$ have the same purchasing power as your 1000$. So your 1000$ is only worth what ~769$ used to be worth.
---
Can confirm I will be using the deviate fish one that makes you the pirate literally almost 100% of the time for all of vanilla... if I fish it myself or not idk but I will deff be spending lots of gold on that lol
---
I am pretty sure anybody can notice their heal going off and the tank still dying. Lets hope that Blizzard finds a way to tweak it that will make it work.
---
+1 for the mount of patient adventurer's. Im going to grind it this time at level 60 as well. I don't like mechanostriders :p
---
I mean it's r14 on the winterspring mount, this guy was a grinder
---
No, I agree with you. With "accurate" I mean as in the experience. Since they're going with 1.12 talents and gear I think it's obvious they ought to re-balance the content. IMO that's accurate.
---
The main point of the post was to point out the fact that a $15 subscription in 2004, was actually more expensive than one today. Which is true. 
---
Another point of this post was to breed constructive conversation about the topic in general which it has with all the comment this post in receiving. 
---
I’m not denying the fact that Blizzard is making tons of money off of us, with efficiencies in technology, yes everything is getting cheaper.
---
Yes, and no. Internet speeds have changed significantly. The most major change is in latency and not just bandwidth. Fiber wasnt really a thing back then, and the service providers have had 15 years to optimize their own end.
---
On top of this computers in general were slower which means you may not be able to take full advantage of high connection speeds.
---
IIRC bats had a screech which was an attack power debuff.
---
Indeed. The way classic works, it feels like a true rpg where effort and knowledge makes you grow. Retail activities feel more like a deliberate artificial hamster wheel, to me at least.
---
I know it sucks to see your game die when all your friends plsy classic.
---
Who knew KT was filled with a bunch of losers.
---
Yep 100%. And that will just ruin lots of fun and active gold farms like fishing and other small stuff that makes the game unique... everyone will just ... have to have a mage and shit :/
---
Yes we do... they’ve removed these lfg adding from retail so why would you think they’d be allowed in classic?
---
Glad yours is ok. Most are dead
---
Because if you think a game that’s been out for over a decade is going to be harder then idk what to tell you. 
---
We have played this game before. We have infinitely more knowledge about WoW and MMOs. We have every single thing in the game documented.
---
I don't think there's many people that are happy with Warforging / Titanforging. And the current way LFD works is fine, you still need to group up for mythic dungeons. It would be impossible to do any dungeons before max level, and even heroic dungeons would be extremely hard to find a group for, so LFD is pretty much required. There's just not enough people leveling to fill your Dire Maul run.  
---
I would imagine more people would actually START playing if they removed sharding, warforging / titanforging and AP farm.
---
What now? Since when nelves cannot be warriors?
---
Classic overworld is harder than retail overworld. Retail dungeons and raids are harder than classic dungeons and raids. PvP is just a matter of preference (I enjoy both).
---
My largest issue with retail is that your gear becomes obsolete with each patch and nothing you do matters. In Classic, your gear retains its inherent value and nothing becomes obsolete. What you do and how you spend your time does matter, and a new big patch won't take that progress away from you.
---
I'm not a guy who's gunna be smashing my way to 60. I'm going to enjoy the ride, I'll play when I can but I wont be in the super hardcore side of it
---
So people donated thousands of subs to him because they thought it was going to be harder???
---
Started playing pre-ZG, only ever played alliance. Deadmines was (and is) always VC.
---
Intentionally including bugs is almost like abusing a broken mechanic. It would be great if bugs were fixed and the game tweaked and added onto such like OSRS where it keeps the nature and play style of the game, just increasing on content that stays true to it.
---
\#nochanges is used by different people to mean different things, like it always has.
---
Word, haters gonna hate
---
All races can be warriors, Night elfs included
---
At most, the optimal class allocation for each class is around 1.5 spots a raid. That's not even closed to balanced.
---
Oh shit. Got em.
---
It's not funny at all if you actually understand the appeal of Classic. The design philosophy of Classic is what people love the game for. It's only natural that people want that to continue at some point.

He must be a cata baby when there was no VC anymore.

---
Is classic gonna be available as it’s own download? Or am I gonna have to download every expansion? Haven’t played wow since Wrath.
---
&gt;15 years ago it was also a brand new game with brand new content, and with new content and system being developed continuously by a big team.
---
Today, it's a fairly new expansion pack with brand new content, and with new content and system [sic] being developed continuously by a big team, plus the original classic experience on top of that.
---
Don't want to play the current version?  Fine, but your refusal to touch a bunch of content doesn't mean that content doesn't exist.
---
TBC just killed it even more, but yeah it's a pretty strange argument. BGs was definitely the major cause.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Was LK, irrc.
---
They didn't need to make changes to dungeons, they buffed the heck out of every class. I tried to list the changes to just one class between 1.2 and 1.12, but I couldn't, there was simply too many. And not just minor tweaks, entire spells disappeared, or did a different thing. Abilities were buffed. Talent trees restructured.   
---
Players got more powerful. Items improved. Low level dungeons might have been exactly as difficult but if damage/healing/mitigation all improve, the result is the same.
---
You're right, wages haven't matched inflation... they've outpaced it.

TL:DR: We try to support it as much as we can, but we can only have two stickies and we reckon we need them.

Garr. He’s right, and I’m not just saying that cause I main hunter. There are a handful of bosses that enrage and this require tranq shot or insane insane gear

PvP exists, my friend.
---
I need to report a bug but I don’t have beta access only stress test. We tried to run a 10 man deadmines run and got “instance is full with 5 people”. Never during vanilla was the cap for leveling dungeons any less than 10, it went from 40 to 10 and remained that way. Here’s a 10 man deadmines run during TBC

If you can’t afford 15/month maybe you need to take a break from video games and focus on your real life

According to \#nochanges, giving any ground will enable Blizzard to make a slippery slope back into retail.

But I'm more of a \#ClassicOSRSmodel guy, so I'm on board with \#SomeChanges.
---
Classic raids are so easy that it doesn't matter. Utility and good times are more important.

Lvl 20 i believe

Last time I did this the average usage was super low including raids and bgs. Around 126 mb/h, of I recall correctly.

Any particular profitable mobs I could farm with a level 45-50?

---
YES. I should have mentioned it and it plays with the whole community-driven design of classic. You're not great on your own, you can do some things well, but you lack this and that. Others complete you. In this kind of design it feels freaking good grouping with others.
---
That's what i meant by " the group is stronger than the sum of the parts ". If classes are too similar, grouping feels like adding more of myself. It's just a quantitative improvement. But when classes are distinct, grouping chnages the way things work, it's a qualitative improvement. The gameplay changes.
---
I mean my guild did BS tank Vek'Lor so there is that, then after it got nerfed we just tanked him in the Arcane Explosions, which was painful but doable. Tank Vek'Nilash against the wall and Vek'Lor gets teled into position and you just tank him against the wall to negate the knockback.
---
There were quite a lot of guilds that tanked Vek'Lor with Warriors from what I remember.
---
Tell you what, if you think the game is too easy, stay in Retail and run Mythic +
---
That sounds right. Ty!
---
They could simply gate it behind itemlevel.
---
Epics drop with a certain (hidden) itemlevel, you can disenchant them and they give whichever is available at that moment. 
---
From the moment they introduce Nexus Crystals, they can increase the itemlevel by 1 and make all epics that drop from that moment able to turn into Nexus Crystals.
---
Its not that hard to prevent this from happening Imo.
---
Just take 1 alt in the raid and give him all the unwanted loot. Not that complicated  really.
---
LOL so we’ve found the cause of this post: OP just victimizes themself no matter the situation
---
But what if I become a streamer to!?!
---
yeah but you get to farm gold for a month and gain double of that!
---
Ty for explaining.  I hope things get better.
---
Care to try again? I have no clue what you're trying to say. WoW Classic only has the vanilla content. I have no interest in playing or paying for the current xpac, so they might as well include every single Blizzard game, charge $100/month and call it a great deal.
---
Your character looks awesome btw
---
Correction: They're not tbc tards, just tards.  Dm cannot mean dire maul without a compass direction attached, leaving dm for deadmines.  So simple and people somehow over complicate things.

There was an attempt to be right here. And that’s all it was.
---
Not everyone wants to PvP. Plus, raid gear is helpful for PvP, and having to be a healstone bot through raiding to get the gear needed to PvP sucks.
---
That’s some serious time investment.
---
You could plan out the best gear from quests and dungeons to make sure you have gear for your level. You have to be quite meticulous in the way you approach and pull mobs when you level a warrior, and it is slow. But where you can't solo you will always find someone to team up with. It's not a horrible, impossible task. I'd say go for it as long as you enjoy playing in groups. Not to forget how warriors, as tanks can get a group and lead it quite easily, so dungeon runs will be easier acces than most other classes.

Not much resist gear to farm from day 1, the little FR you need you'll get from crafted stuff in MC that requires MC trash drops, most of NR gear was added as recepies with AQ patch.
---
Agree with you 100%. Dungeon/raid content should be buffed. The game doesn’t need to be hardmode, but it should be somewhat engaging. 
---
Some private servers were more Blizzlike (K1) and people constantly complained that dungeons and raids were too easy, while Nost overtuned dungeons and raids leading to a better Vanilla experience. Why would we repeat this same mistake? If there’s no threat of dying/losing, it’s not fun. It feels like LFR.
---
I think many people actually wanted nochanges from *private servers* not realizing that the content was buffed.

Used to shoot up heroin. Clean for 3 years. WoW is very similar.

Wow has always been really friendly on bandwidth, basically any type of connection is sufficient.
---
Yea I agree with you just wanted to add supporting arguments.
---
My main was a druid in vanilla and I did mining and engineering.
---
I'm gonna be rolling the same. Engineering isn't a must for pvp but it makes the game way more fun and interesting... Flag carrying with the World Enlarger helps... And using mind control cap on the enemy flag carrier etc

except for the mount system because that's not as much of a gold sink in 1.12

---
Wow thats a good list! This is probably what ill do then, thanks so much
---
People tend to forget basically noone knew how to play the game properly back then. Things will be so much easier now as anyone that did decent raiding in vanilla will know each and every tactic still. 
---
I know I didn’t properly learned to raid till Karazhan when I discovered elitestjerks forums and I felt like I let my class down in vanilla 😬 and I raided AQ40 in vanilla.
---
Depends on the economy. Early on, is elemental earth that desired? On a p server I farmed my 60 mount in an hour and a half finding a node, but that was huge population and elemental earth was in huge demand. There was also horrible competition for it, so most of the time I didn't make shit farming for it. In the end, I went back to farming instances at 60.
---
The corpse run will definitely add a lot of time to mara farming, though. Instead of 5 runs in an hour, you have 5 runs in an hour and a half.
---
I think both voices are important.  Fresh eyes instead of rose tinted glasses gives different feedback.  You want both.
---
Dude you are wrong, that is how they were. Stop with this nonesense. You were a bad player then. We all were. Simple as that.
---
God forbid we accept the fact that Vanilla WoW was incredibly easy and players were just really bad. Why stop at elite damage ? Since we have better internet connections and PCs, let's add affixes to dungeons so tryhards can have a proper dick measuring contest. I mean it's not like druids and pallies wanted to tank anyway.
---
The first chests start anywhere outside of the noobie level 1-6 area, the rest of the 1-10 zone should have chests spawned randomly around camps and caves. They can be fairly rare, luck has a lot to do with it. They spawn on intervals, I think like once an hour since it was last picked, not sure on the exact time, but once they spawn they just sit there until someone picks them up. So if youre on during peak hours, youre unlikely to see one unless you see it spawn, or shortly after it does. If you play at like 3am, youll probably encounter a lot of them.
---
Yeah, warlocks need debuff spots and hunters put out sub-par dps. No need to soak up good raid spots for them.
---
Because we're talking about which of the two is more impactful. Not both...
---
Classic wont have any blood elves ;)
---
FR gear is only for tanks. Everyone else in the raid uses DPS gear and chugs 2 greater fire protection potions.
---
I really don't think current WoW is dying anytime soon. I mean like EverQuest and EverQuest 2 and RuneScape are still going...
---
His group, his choice? How is it that you’re entitled to a spot in his group, or to have him tank for you when he’s targeting a piece of gear he knows you want? Is he supposed to wait until every ret/arms/hunt on the server has the piece before he’s allowed to roll on it?
---
You can put a raid marker on the /tar and it will then show thro los
---
Throw this up on mmochamp and official forums for more traffic. I'd like to see the results
---
Yes, which is (in addition to the 1.12 talents/balance) why pservers buffed dungeons and raids. And it makes it a lot more fun because it’s engaging, even when the game is figured out.
---
Think of it like Asmons armory run. They’ve been playing WoW for 15 years yet really enjoyed that challenge.
---
...exactly. Druids can kill almost anyone 1v1 by simply opening, putting up dots, running away, healing, then going back in and opening again until they die. Tricky to do against Shadow Priests and Elemental Shaman (both hit hard and dispel your hots) but stealth allows you to pick your fights against them.
---

Jesus I hate this website

Those people get the order of operations wrong. People aren't into the game out of nostalgia, they are nostalgic because they were into the game (because it was and is good). Brutalistically recreating Classic WoW is a good first step but there's nothing wrong in wanting to see the original design philosophy alive and well.

This isn't math class ahhh my brain!

There is none because they didn't nerf anything.
---
These people don't want to accept that Vanilla wasn't that hard and we were all just horribly shit at the game.
---
Even with this being the case I don't see why they wouldn't give an option for people to pay a lesser sub for those who just want classic! They could still have this regular option but a reduced if you don't want retail.

I found that the Arthas novel is great for catching up. Gives a little bit of insight to the fall of Stormwind and then you get to see the rise of the forsaken.

BC was my fave, classic is cool and all but it has very little content, even with naxx and aq
---
Hell yes
---
&gt;Mana regen food is made with fish, very important in raids.

Oh yes, the day/night cycle fishing in Feralas for the mana fish!
---
And yet there were tons and tons of us that played wow in 60fps with 100ms tops of lag. This thing that people were playing with 5fps and 1200ms of lag all the time just isn't true. Might be for some, but far from all.
---
I commented on Blizz forums and wow Reddit saying I would pay anything per month play classic again, and I still stand by it. This game is definitely a steal at $15 per month. It's classic, not some generic new random shit tier mmorpg.
---
Yes. Or they "remembered" it being harder. If you need more convincing watch this video by Defcamp and Melderon who were big in the pserver community: https://youtu.be/XL3vco2zy98?t=363
---
You can't (at least not without sacrificing all of your stats), but Warriors aren't getting defense capped in 1.12 either. That was another late Vanilla change - in earlier Vanilla, when Druids weren't very good, defense cap was a thing for Warriors.
---
Yes, I think you’re correct.
---
I also have nasty memories of getting backpedaled to death by rogues
---
Warlocks are not even close to that bad, they do fine DPS, just not top DPS.
---
Is it nice playing the game as if you’re looking at the monitor through a glass of cloudy milk water?
---
Frost mage.
---
A sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
&gt; Yep, Classic is far more about time investment than ability...however I would actually put that forward as a benefit for Classic.
---
Exactly, its way more inclusive than retail because being a mediocre player doesnt prevent you from competing. Commitment and Dedication are the real deal breaker, not skill.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Classic+wow+what+version%3F

Earnings report, if more people are paying less for a different version of WoW, they’re making less money. Now if you bundle it with retail WoW, you make the same no matter what they play.

I think it's worth it if you can get on a server with increased xp rate to see what it's like at higher levels for yourself.

&gt; They all think they know best but in reality they dont have the slightest of clue.

In other words: They think they do but they dont?
---
Sure have been a lot of characters recovered lately on this forum
---
A double crit lol, could you imagine rogues ambushing clothies with 2x crit 😂
---
It may just be uninformed retail players or people who haven’t ever leveled vanilla healers/tanks. Warriors can’t “level prot” the way they can in retail. Nor can any healer class “level healer” if they want to be 60 in a reasonable amount of time.
---
If I’m a Druid healing a leveling dungeon, I’m 100% going to roll need on strength/agi leather/weapons. Because I’m going to be specced feral, and 95% of the time I’ll be wearing my feral set way more often than caster gear. Trying to level Druid as a caster is an inefficient nightmare in vanilla, just like leveling a warrior using a 1h/shield on everything.
---
The idea that tanks and healers are only ever allowed to roll on dps gear in dungeons if the dps in their group don’t want or need them is not an idea that was popular among (informed, non-idiot) vanilla players.
---
Shit! Since you put it in Big Macs, I get it now!
---
They do significantly worse DPS than an equally geared mage and required spriest support in order to do that dps. Sure, they're not as bad as a hybrid, but they're still not great.
---
And that's just a pure DPS class. Hybrids who wanted to PvE were just fucked.
---
The mount system we are getting is exactly 1.12.0. The change to mounts was in 1.12.1.
---
It isn't a real event on a PvP until all hell breaks loose. Who wants to watch a boring tournament where everything goes smoothly?
---
It failed because they didn't
---
I know, right?
---
How dare people have fun figuring those little gimmicks out, huh? They should rather do something *efficient* with their time instead of just playing for fun...!
---
That's how progressive servers on eq work. Because after time they're just a normal live server again.
---
Now project 1999 which is stuck at the first 2 expansions and won't be expanding anymore has had a very large and stable population for like 7 or 8 years.
---
The "nostalgia" rhetoric implies a lot (mostly negative) without the person actually needing to say a lot.
---
Interesting read, but you are ignoring the part were blizzard doesn't want you to play old content. Yes, endgame gear isn't useful anymore once the expansion is dropped, but each time blizz made a new expansion it also nerfed low level trinkets/consumables so those won't be useful anymore(restorative potions, invulnerability potions, trinkets with "you cant use this against X level players", etc). Because of this low level players cant interact with high level players, what can they do? the only useful things they have for endgame players are being nerfed.
---
My take on the whole problem with endgame gear becoming overpowered is a controversial one(also, even if its what I think it works, doesn't mean that I want it in the game, I want to be able to  play classic wow for, at least, 2 years without ANY changes). I don't think everyone should be able to get to that point. If you have less than 10% of the playerbase running with Naxx gear, then it won't really be a problem, because its easier to find enough people to kill somebody like that than to find a Naxx geared player.
---
How would this fix work? Overtune end raids like Naxx to be only winnable if you are the best 40 people on the server. Best gear, lots of consmuables and nobody dying because of avoidable damage.
---
Add in between raids. This will create power creep, but only in mid tier players, the overall power will be te same.
---
Add endgame dungeons: Rewards from this would be better than starting raids, but worse than endgame raids. The difficulty should be on par with what my take on endgame raids would be, but 5 people playing their classes as well as they can is a lot easier than 40.
---
Now, the problem is, what to do with that 1% of people that clears naxx. You can't give them a a new raid with better loot, as that would implement power creep. I would give them similar loot (maybe change the bonuses, but with the same attributes), niches items/consumables, and cosmetics. If something we can learn from retail is that people love to show off, and what is the rewards from the hardest PvE? Being able to show off that you were able to farm it enough to have that shiny thing in the end.
---
Been playing since 2004, and I don't want beta. When I log back into classic I want to be able to play, not hit a point and have to stop. 85 days is nothing.
---
Exactly. Classic WoW makes it so you want to quest with others and it is natural and spontaneous. It's like playing an incredibly organic version of Dungeons and Dragons.
---
Pservers are nothing like classic is/will be they have totally wrong numbers by 1 order of magnitude sometimes (5 vs 15).
---
So by that argumentation you could say "It costs money, doesnt matter how you cut it"?
---
Same here. It iss very interesting to see what spec people want to play
---
Additionally, everyone talking about loot council needs to try to remember what it was like in Vanilla, as opposed to later expansions.  40 man raids and the amount of loot/boss/person is a totally different game.  When 3-4 items drop for a 25 man raid, that's very different than 3-4 items dropping for a 40 man raid.  Later expansions had raid size cut nearly in half, and loot was much less scarce in general.   
---
The benefit of DKP is trust in the system.  If administered properly DKP is fair and encourages both attendance and buy-in (both huge problems with coordinating a 40 man group).  Ultimately if your a consistent raider and you show up, DKP guarantees your going to get gear.  
---
Trust is a huge issue in Vanilla guilds, as guild size is too large for everyone to have a good relationship.  You just will know some people better and cliques form.  Even if the loot council is being fair, the perception of unfairness can be corrosive to a guild and harm morale.  
---
DKP=Trust.  Even with some of its downsides, it is the best system for large raids.  (You can always make exceptions for particular players/items).  The exceptions just need to be reasonable and well publicized.
---
Mage with Tailoring for gearing myself and bags and either enchanting or skinning. Probably starting with skinning no matter what to keep grinding more profitable, maybe switch to enchanting at 60.
---
Casual dungeons and raid groups will be much more prevalent.
---
Often guilds will have applications on real websites to fulfill their 60 man roster.
---
If raiding is your end all be all make your class choice based on that.  Priest, mage, rogue are always desired.  Warriors are good too but often gleaders or the most hardcore raider will occupy the warrior slots.
---
Rogues are also very common so try to learn alot on your own.  Lockpick to 300 take professions seriously etc.  You want to check as many boxes on a guild app as possible.
---
Any hunter who thinks they have priority on a melee weapon over a melee class, without regard to whether they’re tanking, healing, or another dps, is an asshat. Especially while leveling.
---
The only thing that would be worth changing is backend stuff like spell batching which was implemented to makeup for bad computer hardware and servers. I would only agree on upgrading the backend of the game for better gameplay, but absolutely zero changes to the game itself.
---
Jesus Christ dude... Stop and take a breath.
---
The AQ war effort is going to be done in a day with people stockpiling beforehand.
---
S a l t
---
I look at people's thoughts about the PVP and PVE aspects of some classes with a grain of salt, it's all very subjective and people like to think it's possible to talk definitively on the subject when that's not really possible. I have a good idea of what classes I like, and I'm not choosing from the ones that weren't my mains but rather alts I enjoyed and never fully leveled. I think that's a good way to make sure I don't sink too much time into a less familiar class, and end up not liking it. 
---
I've decided to pick from the hybrid classes and hybrid specs, and even though people like to put them down a little bit I know I'll be putting a mass amount of effort into my main character, I have lots of experience with the game &amp; plan to be very guild involved.
---
To fix it didn't they have to roll back the couple of servers that had a big outbreak. I don't see it coming back
---
Yes WoW is not free, it’s cheaper than it was 15 years ago though. 😏
---
Although i would love to see this happen again (on the other side they had to rollback servers to get rid of it), it was soon fixed to be able to take the infection outside Zul'Gurub and i'm pretty sure the 1.12 classic version will include that fix.
---
I could have sworn I put a comma in there lmao
---
Haha yeah, maybe it doesn't even have to be as much as double, and of course there would have to be some nice mechanic to counteract it as well. But perhaps you see what I'm getting at? :-)
---
Id love Blizzard to use classic as an excuse to re-visit or re-implement cut vanilla content, things like the Dragon Isles and the Emerald Dream. Then spiral out from there taking classic in a philosophically different direction that retail.
---
So to all the private server players who prefer buffed dungeon/raid content you would tell them to go to Retail? It doesn't really make sense. These players are chasing the Vanilla experience, not specific HP/dmg values. 
---
You sound pretty close minded so I'm not going to waste more time but keep in mind that some pservers were Blizzlike (i.e., K1) and people constantly complained they were too easy, and I hope Classic doesn't repeat this mistake. It's not fun when there's no threat of dying. It's like LFR. Oh yea, retail.
---
If you end up doing end game raiding then consider getting a damage meter. But certainly don’t get one before then. It’ll just distract you and cause you to focus on the wrong things. Dps isn’t the end all of being a valuable team member.
---
I think he means that someone in the guild will be the disenchanter, and they'll hoard the purples until the AQ patch, and then the guild will have a ton of nexus crystals.
---
Who was the orc? Gorbag?
---
Yeah that would be awesome
---
&gt;I had no idea how to join one after I got to level cap, since everyone on youtube told me not to ask trade chat for an invite, and the in game guild search tab was a joke.
---
I don’t know if I should laugh or feel sorry. Stop listening to youtubers and ask around in-game, search the forums etc.
---
To get geared for PvP you need to do PvE to get some decent gear. Some classes can perform quite well in blue gear from Dungeons (Frost Mage for example), while others might need epics from higher tier raids to really shine. 
---
Once you get some good enough gear, you can try to solo grind BGs/join a premade and aim for rank 10 (blue) PvP gear, which is quite good for some classes, though usually raid gear will be better. Again, this mostly depends on your class choice, for example as a Shadow Priest you most likely won’t get epic caster gear before Mages and Locks even if you raid, so most people recommend grinding out the rank 10 rewards.
---
Food buffs are a bigger help compared to now and fish can be cooked into lots of things.
---
What you're saying is very possibly true and it's why I'm glad streamers got so much favoritism in the beta. Hearing them articulating why they love Classic so publicly is important. Here's hoping Blizzard takes what they are saying seriously.
---
afaik russia and asian accounts have different price policies, but I could be wrong about that.
---
&gt;But you also don't want to make old content irrelevant.
---
Is that actually true though? I don't think so. Making old content irrelevant means that you get to bury your mistakes. Molten Core is shit. It's total dog-shit. Don't @ me. One of the best things about Burning Crusade is that all the progression of vanilla was rendered irrelevant. The shitty raids. The broken gear. The design built upon class design philosophies that have since changed. Even dungeon content isn't guaranteed "evergreen" content because of the shifts in mentalities that have happened over time ("How much should ranged be able to move? How much CC should each class have? How resilient should tanks be?"). 
---
The "play the expansion" approach means that Blizzard gets a clean slate and can focus on delivering the best experience they can. Obviously it is dangerous to follow that train of thought to it's supposedly logical conclusion and design the game around "play the patch", because we've seen where that has led, but the "play the expansion" approach was super successful for Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King, bringing the game to heights I'd argue it would have never reached in the game was perpetually held down by the designers first attempts at designing content. 
---
&gt;Some older MMORPGs start to amass staggering amounts of content where new players will have new experiences for years. 
---
Too much sometimes. Having to go through nerfed versions of each raid makes the story more coherent, but it's a huge road to walk to get to the content that your friend is playing. Look at FFXIV - it has some fantastic content, but having to do every Primal and every old raid to even start gearing for end-game is an insanely long process. You also have the problem that in order for this system to work, you have to hand out welfare gear to players to fill out the "LFR" version of these raids for players going through the story. You also get the problem that if you want to min-max your own gear progression if you're trying to catch up an alt's gear, you have to play 4 year old content every so often for those goodie bags. As a new player, experiencing the Great King Moogle fight even in a nerfed form was awesome, but I imagine for a vet it gets tiring. (FFXIV has sidestepped some issues that WoW would have with that approach by not fundamentally altering the nature of classes too often - every tank and healer has access to the same limit breaks that were available then IIRC). 
---
The only game I experienced with good "horizontal" progression was Dark Age of Camelot, and even that game screwed the pooch when they eventually added a new "tier" of content above that horizontal layer they existed (Trials of Atlantis = RIP, people say WoW killed ToA but I'd argue that people were willing to jump skip from DAOC because ToA was such a mess). When it was at its peak during SI, you had dragons for respec stones, you had epic quests for a set of starter end-game gear, you had Darkness Falls to fill jewelry slots, items with unique procs, and coveted "light saber" cosmetic weapons, you had the SI raids with "imba" items that broke the standard conventions of gear but didn't fit into existing templates so you would have to spell-craft around them to reap the rewards while still maintaining capped physical and other important resistances, etc. You would do a variety of different content to gear up to be PvP ready on a starter level, and you would continue to do content and rework your gear in order to get incremental advantages (break cast speed cap, break HP cap, break resist cap with SI gear). Having said that, the PvE content wasn't the main meat of the game - the PvP was. So there was a smaller amount of PvE, and therefore it could get reworked/rebalanced and it wouldn't go stale because it wasn't the main activity of the game.
---
Do you have any idea at all how inefficient it was to run dungeons without quests in vanilla? You’re better off going out in the word and grinding than trying to do dungeons.
---
The only time you step foot into dungeons and expect it to be efficient is when you have quests or there are very strong pieces of gear in there which you’ll use for multiple levels. 
---
The tank is likely going to run the dungeon as many times as the hunter. Where the “tank” being a warrior is actually going to use the weapon outside of the dungeon for legitimate damage increase, the hunter is missing out on a couple more numbers on his stat stick.
---
I hit 2k + using my phone internet. You will get random d/c and maybe spikes but typically in any city it will work fine.
---
I prefer longer pvp fights because they give enough time to use everything in your arsenal and potentially preform a comeback. 
---
With fights that last less than 8s , basically who ever attacks or procs first wins which means initial reflexes and luck are more important than skill
---
Every racial is pretty darn mediocre in PvE, its such a minor 0.00012% benefit for like every racial. Hardiness is at least broken in PvP. Not picking an Orc is just bad
---
I think you know full well what he meant, as evidenced by your first comment. But you still chose to be an asshole. 
---
Wages for the vast majority of people in America have not in fact outpaced inflation.
---
How do you plan on implementing the guild rank prio?
---
why do I remember this being voice acted? is there a Tales of the Past 2?
---
Ranged classes in general, MM hunter, Ele/Resto shaman, Mage / Lock / Heal/Shadow Priest.
---
No casters for me, haha. I'm for sure gonna main Rogue and have a Warrior too tho.
---
Buthurt. Go play 8.2 haha. Few quests for max 2 hours and netherlight forge 2.0 , insane!
---
I think you're underestimating Night Elf. They have every physical damage class and excellent buff synergy (Leader of the Pack, Trueshot Aura, Battle Shout, etc).
---
The Troll raid would be easier for the average player, but IMO the Night Elf raid would be the strongest in the hands of skilled player.
---
This is hilariously similar to why so many restaurants fail on Kitchen Nightmares. They listen to their vocal regulars who aren't numerous enough to keep the business alive and alienate the silent majority who vote with their dollars.
---
Should just lock this thread before it gets overrun by moron class traitors who gleefully go to bat for billionaires who are fucking them and almost everyone they know in the ass.
---
I guess my idea of "significantly worse" is really different. They're good enough to bring to all content. If that's not good enough for you as a player, just don't play a lock.
---
Why is this even an argument? Everyone knew this before classic was announced. I'm not saying you can't talk about it, I'm just wondering why.
---
Old School was very much primarily nostalgia-fueled before they added new content.
---
Find BiS gear for your char through top level dungeons.  Kill every enemy faction in the world and learn guard aggro range and best locations for pvp.
---
Prove yourself individually on your server then join a hardcore WSG group to grind to Marshal or Warlord.  If you are respectted enough you may be granted Grand Marshal or High Warlord.
---
Don't ever pretend you are irreplaceable, you should always act like someone is breathing down your neck for your slot.  As soon as you get pompous you may be replaced and never reach too eschelon.
---
He spent a lot of time farming so I can see why he would be salty. Idk how this wasn't the expected outcome when in the past funerals have been invaded
---
Very nice, thanks!
---
&gt;Playing on a PvP server is identical to a PvE server when it comes to raids and pve.
---
Fairly close but not identical.
---
Going to BWL/UBRS/MC can be very precarious, especially if you arrive alone.
---
Woke
---
It’s funny because I don’t have to remember your name I just look for the crazy rants with random capital words lol
---
You forgot warlock
---
We had this discussion in another thread before, no idea why you guys are bringing it up again. Some servers called it VC, some called it DM. It was a fact that Dead Mines came out first though, and most people that played before Dire Maul was in the game gave the DM moniker to Dead Mines because of seniority. If they wanted to run Dire Maul, they used directions because no one ran all three at once. DM:E, DM:N, DM:W.
---
In short, retarded servers of people who came in late or were on EU servers called Dire Maul DM and then had to have subsequent, time-wasting discussions about which route to take because they weren't smart enough to just say DM:W for example in the chat. DM was always Dead Mines from the start though, no matter what servers had their weird quirks and decided to change it when Dire Maul came out.
---
Missing hunter  and you need tranq shot for fights like chromaggus and the three BWL dragons.
---
Which bug streamers are going pve?
---
Think about which class fantasy speaks to you
---
How their abilities flow with each other and feel
---
How your class/race can work with the professions you like
---
How much effort you see yourself investing in what characters
---
Think about gear and the people you will play with
---
Can you somehow identify with the character based on your own personality/experiences
---
Are you okay with the limitations of the class
---
It's lItERaLlY ImPoSsIBlE tO CoNveY sArCasM tHrOUgH TeXT.
---
I can second this, I also got in early (Day 3 I think) and have also played since Vanillas Beta. I've had more than a couple of 4am-5am nights and I haven't done that for a long time.
---
When I was studying (and working) I was barely able to get by, allready cutting corners where I could. I would have loved to play WoW in my sparse free time, but I couldnt really answer for those expenses. Now the sub fee is a laughable amount of money.     
---
Dont be ignorant and assume stuff only based on your experience. Chances are others have different ones.
---
I levelled totally fine in cata on 3g (or early slower 4g?) via USB tethering when my Internet went Down.
---
I was arguing against someone else's point that balance wasn't an issue in vanilla because, even if a certain class doesn't do as much damage as another class, they bring unique utility that no other class brings, which means they're wanted anyway.
---
I was trying to point out that most people who rolled a warlock didn't do so in order to provide that utility, and that other classes also have unique utility while having much more damage, meaning that class balance was an issue in classic, and just saying 'well people brought you anyway for healthstones and summons' is a shitty way to deal with it.
---
I form my own opinions. Not take other people’s.
---
Mount Hyjal was under construction in Vanilla, "Gemology" was cut out in the beta.  Karazhan was originally Vanilla planned content.  Demon Hunter was on the original Vanilla box.
---
Most PvE specs are pretty good for PvP. Id say Mages and Prot Warriors would be ones to avoid. Fury Warriors you might have to cheat a point into Piercing Howl, not ideal, but theyre OK. Paladin and Druids have pretty flexible points, so they can get pretty decent specs. The rest of the classes are OK to pretty good in their PvP specs.
---
Rogue, Warlock, Hunter and Paladins are probably the best ones.
---
What are you paying $15 a month for though?   They're not doing real content updates anymore.
---
Yeah, Tales of the Past 2 and 3 were voice acted.
---
I would recommend you do so. Because the reality is that if you, as a dps, try to kick a tank because he won’t agree to pass on gear you want, you are going to be kicked and replaced instantly. And if you try to make your own group so you can’t be kicked, expect that group to disband and reform without you.
---
Dps can be replaced in a snap, and an idiot who thinks they’re entitled to gear because “mainspec&gt;offspec” in a healing dungeon is going to be put on more ignore lists than you can shake a stick at.
---
There is no much point talking to you, isnt there?
---
Tl;dw he found lower level dungeons to be too easy and sees this as a big issue. As a shaman healer, he didn't have to stop for a drink in entire dungeon runs because his group was taking that little damage.
---
I can’t decide if I prefer shaman or paladin as support for a warrior in pvp
---
They will care when I mix that ass because they are busy bitching about glancing blows and resisted spells
---
I don't think its a rip-off at all. To me if I'm spending a dollar per hour of entertainment it's worth it to me. If I spend 60 on a game I would want to get at least 60 hours in or as close to that as possible. I know for a fact that I will easily reach  more than 15 hours a month on classic.
---
No warlocks for trolls will make twin emps very hard.
---
From pserver knowledge, herbing is best. Mining is all right, skinning is usually pretty bad at 60. Fishing is also all right at 60.
---
And your pets
---
I think they could do an in game event in the same vain as the zombie invasion they did leading up to WotLK.
---
What fantasy land are you living in?
---
Spell Power for Righteousness and Command. Righteousness has a better coefficient.
---
Can we at least wait until classic actually releases before posting about this yet again?
---
You know the funniest part? That protection warrior wanted to invite me to do SM-Armory as healer (Retribution Paladin with healing gear) after his healer left the group because it was too long to get a group. Because all of this he wanted only clothies in his party. He sent me that invite and I declined right away. He did again and I declined once again. And then, he sent me an IM: "Our healer left, we need a healer and we are good to go." I replied: "No, I know you and I don't want to party with you." I was only healer online on that time around that level.
---
I've always played Warrior and Rogue 
---
So I'm gonna play either one first and both eventually 
---
Just still struggling what to do first 
---
Warriors will be overpoped
---
Warriors are hard and slow
---
Warriors are gods in group pvp later on
---
Rogues will be overpoped 
---
Rogues are not as hard
---
Rogues are gods in 1v1 and ganks
---
Rogues suck at group pvp
---
Question is can I endure till phase 3 to play Warrior
---
Or should I play something more powerful early on
---
I'm not lamiliar at all with looy trading as I quitted during tbc, good news it has this kind of limitation :)
---
If it's LTE you can have decent latency, 4g is ok too.  I've heard of people making do with 3g too.
---
everquest is one example, but so is old school runescape which is doing incredibly well. 
---
also, did you forget about nostalrius? that was up for about 10 months, but was doing great in terms of its playerbase. it's the reason why we have classic in the first place - blizzard know how successful pservers are.
---
Also I used to be poor and now I'm rich , so that really helps
---
Yes, we only have 1 Tank in our 80 man roster. Who hurt you?
---
You can stream Retail WoW without a subscription, if your laptop handles it I'm sure Classic will be fine.
---
I secretly hope he’s rolling feral tank and this is just a crazy way of throwing everyone off of the class.
---
Assuming hunters won’t be rolling on your staves/daggers, eh? Foolish.
---
&gt; not about keeping broken things broken.
---
Some people will argue that Paladins/Hunters/Shamans/Druids are broken too and should be fixed.
---
It has
---
Newman...
---
Troll. If you like a free trinket in pvp, then undead.
---
I suspect that Enchanting has been designed with a large range of items in mind, so the game checks level requirement, rarity, and slot, and then generates a loot table based on this data.   If that's how it's coded, then it would be quite trivial to change a few values in these ranges.  
---
Now on the other hand, if they've coded it such that each individual item has it's own disenchant loot table, then it would be time consuming and tidious.   I kind of doubt that's how it works though.
---
And you form your own opinions by being close-minded and unwilling to listen to anyone else's?
---
this is much more helpful than the megathread which is basically a [suggestion box furnace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKVAs2J84w8) at this point. so many comments "lul im not in beta its a bug".
---
hope this gets some attention
---
This need to be stickied.
---
In world PvP, not that important for a Druid, it doesnt give you much in 1v1s. However, as a flag runner, Engi is kind of critical, especially when left to your own devices, netomatic, parachute, rocket helm, rocket boots, grenades to a lesser extent, all can save your life when holding onto the flag by yourself.
---
You would definitely want to be mining to just farm your own mats.
---
Better than being an unrepentant sociopath /shrug
---
Not really? What’s wrong with a simple discussion and hearing other people’s opinions?
---
Sounds like a competition of who has the bigger dick here. I was just pointing out the fact that the inflation rate over the last 15 years have made the subscription for WoW cheaper because it hasn’t changed in USD value. This strictly pertains to only people using the USD. Can’t speak for other currencies and countries. 
---
You dialed it in a little bit more and gave the specific numbers. I thank you for that and have a good day. 
---
It has sparked great conversation. Enjoy it.
---
Can someone post a list on or directly after launch day of what servers popular content creators are playing? This would be good for those of us trying to avoid those servers, as well as the people wanting to play on them.
---
Good, alliance are Cowards anyway
---
???? It was never a gold sink to begin with.
---
Nah it hasn't been done yet this last hour.
---
There is never any point in talking to people who think wage growth has significantly outpaced inflation for vast majority of people in America. Either he's rich and evil or poor and stupid.
---
“I lured you out here into open waters, where you have no hope of escape.”

Oh come now, I know you don't know what that sounds like

If blizz says the difficulty is accurate then there’s nothing to be done about it.
---
Oto’s rogue guide for rogues
---
Yea so there was no lfr or even dungeon finder in tbc...
---
Also enrage due to low dps
---
Because this has been posted over and over and over and over again. This discussion has already been had multiple times, with the same points brought up repeatedly.
---
And, again, classic has not actually launched. Maybe we should wait to see how popular it is before we start speculating on what the future should bring.
---
Well yeah. Ret is garbage. If I say I’m looking for dps and a paladin responds, I’ll politely tell them no thanks, but I’m not surprised people just ignore you. You’ll be doing less damage than the tank many times, and taking gear from every roll more often than not.
---
You don’t really contribute anything of worth outside of some buffs that don’t even come close to making up for the dps loss.
---
Play ret if you want, definitely, but don’t expect people to want to group with you...
---
One day you'll have responsibilities and laugh at yourself for your old opinions on exactly what constitutes a waste of life. 
---
Until then, do your best to be less abrasive. It's a bad look.
---
I always love when people talk about disturbing the "echo chamber" as if that actually means anything. People agreeing on things isn't an echo chamber, it's people agreeing on things. An echo chamber constitutes a space where not only are the same opinions held to be facts, but also where dissent is banned or otherwise mitigated in such a way as to ridicule or dissuade the dissenter. Mods here aren't about to ban you from this sub just because you don't like, or if you have critiques about classic.
---
No, the names and types are unannounced.
---
It seems common for people that never played Vanilla to think they have to stick to one spec.
---
Wrong : you will have a levelling spec, a dungeon / raid spec and a PVP spec at the very least.
---
You choose your class, then you choose a spec adapted for what you want to do.
---
I won't comment on paladins since I know almost nothing about them.
---
&gt; Rogues will be overpoped
---
For what it's worth, Rogue probably has a much smaller population after a number of months. Going by unauthorized servers and surveys on these forums, they're pretty low on the list. The massive influx of retail and less involved players on launch means there'll definitely be a ton of extra rogues (and hunters, and paladins) but once the dust settles they'll probably drop quite a bit. 
---
Warrior is still #2 most played at 60 if we go by current statistics.
---
BC had its problems as well no expac is without its faults
---
How is the barber shop a QoL feature?
---
Could use restorative pots
---
Great efforts RIGHT HERE /upvote
---
The leveling path can be different if you don't like getting ganked. Avoiding STV seems to be a good plan most of the time.
---
If you don’t like it then just downvote and move on with ur life. No need to comment
---
I didn't take it in moderation back then, and I don't expect to do any better this time ^^
---
It will be a win if I can keep my job !
---
No salt, just honesty.
---
Definitely is. The other thing is streamers (especially famous ones) are better than your average player. Not saying they are all top tier but nobody would follow a streamer who was straight dog poop.
---
A group of your average players probably wouldn’t be able to do what the streamers are doing in their groups.
---
Same situation. You just have to ask yourself would you rather stare at the back of a humans head all day? Or group/pvp eoth your friends all day?
---
I should have been more clear... 
---
I am OKAY with making dungeons harder if they are actually really really easy (I'm not in beta). I think great, smart game design trumps #nochanges ... especially since #nochanges is a grey area when it comes to versioning.
---
On the other hand, I do understand people's hesitation when it comes to any changes. These are the developers that both made WoW and ruined WoW. ;)
---
Lightning's Blade US, guild Lost Chapter. Believe it was the 2nd Rag kill on server. Though the guild who had #1 had fallen apart at this point.
---
I guess they mean the used gear that is bound to the player and not DE'able by an alt. Could be smart, but bank space is scarce while leveling.
---
muh minmax raids for content i was clearing in middle school
---
Is that supposed to be homophobic?
---
He does a lot of comparison with private servers right after he talks about memory being a bad metric to use for comparison even though private servers are also made from memory and videos which don't explain anything.
---
That's a pretty poor way to go about it. There's nothing to compare. At all. Certainly not to private servers.
---
Poorly written video.
---
The mods actually disallowed these sort of discussions until phase 3 of Classic. This thread gets posted all the time and it's so annoying to just keep downvoting it.
---
If you want to raid, you'll find a guild, easy. There are weekly threads here for finding a guild, but you won't need them. The hardest part of raiding in Vanilla is getting 40 level 60 people online at the same time and listening to one person. If you can do that, guilds will want you.
---
You should be able to find a guild to join just by playing the game. 
---
Vanilla is social, people will spam lfg, you talk to them, join the group and do a good job. If you play well you usually get asked to join if you're not guilded already. People want lots of people in their guild so they can form groups internally and have more options on raid night
---
Yeah but not TBC, I mean new to everyone
---
By today's industry's standards prices for low-income countries would remain the same and prices for high-income countries would rise to match.
---
I'm in one of those countries, post-tax I get 410€ a month. Post bills (and I live very much like a student) - 170~€. Another 50€ for food (no eating out or anything) and you're left with 120€ for saving/emergencies/clothing/entertainment and whatever else A MONTH. That's one of the reasons I stopped playing WoW (only visited like for a month or two every xpac) after Dragon Soul, just couldn't justify the price/fun ratio.
---
WoW didn't start out with an in-game store where as GW2 did.  
---
Also most of GW2's Living Stories are based around the in-game store  so if you really want everything from GW2 you would probably need to spend more money than you spend paying a monthly subscription.
---
Same, except I dont like the bugs *ruining* my desert!
---
Just appear offline bruh.
---
Druids tanked vanilla back in 2005-2006 just fine, stop acting like you know shit.
---
Who said I want to try to kick a tank??? I just don't join the party at the begining if I know the tank is a dick. Then, the rest of your argument doesn't make any sense.
---
Everyone is replaceable, tanks are no exception. Also... "dps"... the right is damage dealer.
---
I want to carry da flag
---
Druid
---
I'd rather Blizzard make their game consistent with the original than force everyone to download a 3rd party addon for something so simple
---
Im not really sure but i dont think you can count abscence of evidence as evidence.
---
I'm personally not too fussed about the barbershop, because I think it's cool to recognise characters based on looks, but I can understand why other people would want it. I am gonna miss the hairstyles added in WOTLK though since my main has used one of them since then.
---
Minimum wage is also good way to look at it. When I first started playing vanilla in 2004, I was making USD $6.75 an hour. So it was like 3 hours of work for a wow sub. 
---
Now in California its like $13 bucks an hour I heard so just a little over an hour for your wow sub.
---
If this happens again I will be so happy! =)
---
Wish i didnt bot on my first account and wasnt banned, would be fun to see my first characters again. Accounts like that is 100% not recoverable right?
---
&gt;I was a rank 13 druid and 11 mage in 05 and 06
---
Nolife. No wonder you're still alive now :D
---
They took Dwarf mages out because it would have given Alliance one extra race/class combo compared to Horde.
---
Still salty about that.
---
You want me to change my opinion based on others opinions? 
---
No. I will change my opinion based on facts. Opinions mean nothing.
---
Burning Crusade is "WoW Upgraded". It is the TFT to WC3's ROC. It's better in every conceivable way. Did it make some blunders? Yes. But even when it blundered, it was still ahead of vanilla's interpretation of that facet. 
---
The reason to celebrate Vanilla Classic is that it is the stepping stone to Burning Crusade Classic.
---
Blizzard could keep track of the items dropped before 1.9 like someone said, but it still makes a massive difference because you can store way way less nexus crystals like this when it takes an entire inventory space for each nexus and you can't trade it to alts or anything.
---
!remindme
---
I don't think that's true. If there is enough of a consensus from the community I think Blizzard is open to anything. Even "no changes" was originally born out of the community consensus. 
---
Another argument is that a lot of people have pointed out that most classes were stronger in 1.12 than in earlier patches. So while 1.12 is the most polished patch, it also doesn't best represent the true difficulty of Vanilla.
---
People didn't minmax as hard back then anyways, so it didn't matter as much. Utility and class identity was more important. Now all people are about is tryharding and sucking the fun out of everything. WoW should be about friends and good times, not smashing through content 7% faster.
---
Yep. 5 more days. Already have it ordered.
---
You will also have Druid for tanking, so it’s not like threat will matter.
---
I did as well, but mine is 80/WotLK era so I didn't post. But Blizz support was incredible and super nice, I just sent them a ticket with my old account name and they asked me a few questions before recovering it and even merging it with my primary battle.net account.
---
Tipsout
---
yea, most will be dead as well after classic is older than few months
---
Can anyone recommend which professions I should take? Purely from a gold-making perspective.
---
I will be playing human mage and I'm not planning on doing much raiding.

I like it - you know your gameplay is attributed to your ability as a seasoned player and the time you intend to sink gives you the potential to make it work. That’s a good mindset
---
Yikes.
---
TBC was a wonderful expansion, and if wow had ended there it might have been fine. But it introduced too many mechanics that became a precedence that ended up ruining the game.
---
Considering the upper class definitely didn’t lower then that statistic just means the bottom
---
end of middle class just slid down into lower class
---
haha, no that won't happen    
---
keep living in your delusion tho, see you in december when numbers plummet :)
---
When I reached 60 I was like now what? Lol
---
Warlords of draenor 2.0: The Burning Crusade in another timeline to see how things play out differently
---
How do you figure?
---
Ebin is good :(
---
Yeah telling me nerzhul zq match was bad play making?
---
Why do people keep comparing price/value of different medias? Yes, WoW gives you more stuff for the money than pub/movie/whatever does. Books give you 10 amounts that. Get a book for 2$ out of a discount bin - get 40 hours of content. 
---
It's a not a good argument. Even within gaming WoW's value is not that astronomical. Take a good tripe AAA game like Dark Souls 1, you can get it for 5$ and one playthrough will net you 70 or so hours, a lot more if you like playing different characters, co-op'ing or PvP (I've accumulated over 1k hours before DS2 came out).
---
It's a dumb discussion in general now that I think of it. It would be way better to talk about their monetization model. If you got a subscription - ditch expansions. Or at the very least get rid of cash store...
---
It sure as hell didn't need to be.
---
Does your discord theorycraft things other than tanking? I’ve been looking for more information about Balance Druid.
---
I've been in guilds that did both.  I think for the 25 man raids loot council is more plausible than trying to loot council 40 mans where there aren't a lot of offspecs like there were in TBC and Wrath.  DKP for 40 mans, because of the sheer numbers, is a much better system from a management perspective.  One system risks gearing out subpar players, and the other risks nepotism.  What a lot of individuals fail to consider is the scope of Classic.  It will be perpetual and everyone will be completely geared on several alts even in lower skilled guilds.  
---
I lead raids in Vanilla to Wrath and the one thing above all else I despise about raiding is loot.  So many people have that glittering greed in their eyes and find it a personal affront to have someone they deem lesser than them being geared out a week before they will.  For 25 mans I always ran raids with DKP.  For 10 mans it was always roll.  If I could without drama I would leave every single raid as need before greed rolling, because the only loot does is slow down raids and cause greedy children to lose their minds.
---
With how loot trading will be in Classic expect there to be a lot of people looking to pay for loot from people who receive it.  I foresee many people banking DKP and holding loot hostage for 500-1000g.  I can see individuals bullying the hell out of anyone getting gear in loot council to trade to them.  My advice is to shut that shit down immediately.  Even in PUGs.  Someone brings that mentality into a raid kick them and complete it with 39 people.
---
Really, it just depends on the guild.  Loot council can work if the guild is fair and has a specific set of goals.  DKP is better for not as close guilds where people want to keep loot distribution on an even playing field.
---
DKP will be the majority system for most guilds. A lot of people, especially casuals, will hate Loot Council since it values dedication, time, skill and role over everything else. This is going to mean that the 5th Mage in the raid in terms of parses that doesn't really give the guild his herbs or bring the best consumables isn't getting anything until everyone else already has their gear. So he will quit and go to a DKP guild like most people.
---
That being said, the top end guilds will be running a Loot Council system and optimizing the raid for progression. As long as you don't have retarded leaders giving tank gear to Fury Warriors first because the Fury Warrior is the leader's cousin, everything will go smoother for overall progression than the DKP system. DKP systems are harder to corrupt and less likely to fall apart though.
---
Idk I played a TBC server recently and honestly I think the expansion sucks major dick. The raids are shit at least t4-5, the pvp system is garbage, the arena sucks, the prebis farm is tedious, the dungeons are doll. Playing on a wrath server right now and honestly while everything is easier, it's actually a way better experience. Wrath&gt;TBC for me atm.
---
Long term, herb and mining are the best gold making professions.  
---
Exceptions if you get an ultra rare pattern early, but that is unlikely unless you are raiding.
---
I have put about a thousand hours in skyrim, but it's not worth $1000.   I have put thousands of hours into woodworking, but my chisel isn't worth thousands of dollars.
---
Private server lists won't be correct because of differences in itemization. Try [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview#) instead, it's pretty accurate.
---
What?!?? You won’t change your opinion based on what I said??? So close minded!!!!
---
Well, we know that Private Servers are easier. A bunch of mobs didn't have abilities and the boss stats were all wrong, especially parry. So #3 is wrong.
---
Private Server addons don't matter. They don't work in Classic. Yeah, they'll be some new addons from Retail that get ported over, but the ones you listed were available in Vanilla.
---
Same with mine! It's a vanilla account but not much worth talking about. Blizz was super helpful and got my account back in a day! Nearly shed a tear when I saw old Janberglul back in all his glory of still not level 70
---
I'm not entirely sure yet about whether I'll go Warlock or Hunter. 
---
&gt; Was it your original main 60 from Vanilla?
---
My main, initially, on EU launch was a Troll Enhancement shaman. Had a lot of fun with it, until it became clear they aren't fantastic and people became hesitant to let you play it. With the years of experience we've all had by now, it's also a harder sell since PvPers got so much better and Enhancement has some severe issues. So I'm skipping that experience again. 
---
Later on in vanilla I did swap to an Orc Warlock for raiding (AQ and such), so there's some nostalgia involved there but it's not my primary concern. 
---
Ultimately, I'm concerned with a few elements. I don't care about raiding performance, other than having a class/spec that gets taken I'm fine playing one that under-performs or one that does well. In a solved meta, I don't really care either way and lets be honest vanilla rotations are far from involved gameplay in raids. I'll happily do them, I'll certainly not slack off, but I couldn't care less whether or not Hunters fall behind in the DPS meters or some such. 
---
No, the reason I'm contemplating between these two is because they're quite similar in some respects. I want a class that's capable at solo farming, check, I want a class that I enjoy the theme of (Thematically really like pet classes, be they summoners or beastmasters) and I want a class that performs well in all facets of PvP with a high skill ceiling and good complexity. Warlock and Hunter fit the bill for that perfectly.
---
This is essentially how I landed on my main for live (DH.... yes, yes, I know...).
---
I’ve seen people talk about how people should just “play what you find fun”. I struggle to comprehend this in the context of classic due to not knowing what’s fun at endgame, which leveling-experience aside is where all your time is spent in game. I played Vanilla but was only level 44 on my rogue when TBC came out. I never experienced the Endgame back then, and modern classes are so far from their Vanilla roots I feel that’s a poor measuring tool to use as well
---
Barrens. To big and you are there for to long  just gets old after 7 levels.
---
my turn to post this tomorrow
---
/r/thathappened
---
The first question is what faction are you playing? This usually is dictated by which faction your friends want to play.
---
After that, for me personally: I know I will play a hybrid. I'll probably only be able to cap 1 char so I want to play multiple specs and gameplay. Currently it's looking like I'll be playing a horde shaman.
---
I was in the exact same place hitting 60. I was AMPED. Super salty that my hard drive with my screenshots died. :-/
---
Yeah I feel you, well what are the ones you are struggling to pick between? 🤔
---
If we are including content with randoms, some of the dungeons even as you leveled up were pretty challenging with retards. I forget the name, but one of them at 82 or 83 that took place underwater with the octopus that locked onto someone's face. DPS never fucking switched and got that thing off of anyone. The design of some of the mechanics was pretty cool though.
---
Overall, I actually hated the changes they made to my favorite classes. I was a Holy Pally main in wrath and loved the way it healed. Then they reworked it for CATA and added Holy Power bullshit and I just couldn't stand it. I might have actually enjoyed the raiding though if I would have stayed, but I just got salty at 84 and quit. I genuinely fucking hate Holy Power with all of my being and haven't touched Pally since. It still makes me furious when I think about it.
---
&gt; Wouldn't it make more sense to adjust prizes depending on country?
---
The EU requires all countries have the same price. They are cheaper elsewhere.
---
WoW is about a lot of things. 
---
Even if it is easy enough that it doesn't matter that much which class you bring, it doesn't make the imbalance acceptable. Warriors and rogues doing double the damage of ret and enhancement is not something that can be excused by totems and blessings.
---
I think there’s things that can be learnt from classic but also some stuff that’s difficult.
---
If people were still having to run uldir now they (and myself) wouldn’t really be happy by it. People just get bored of raids quicker nowadays and they could reduce the drops from the raid by 75% so I had to run it more but that’s a really crappy way to make it last longer. 
---
In classic (and every other expansion up till legion) dungeons became irrelevant. With mythic+ 5 player content is always relevant which is great but puts more loot into the game causes other problems. 
---
So ya killing mythic+ and reducing raid drops would force me to raid older and current raids longer but I think I would massively resent raiding if this did happen. 
---
I think the biggest thing we could learn from classic is just what the world feels like and the difficulty that comes with it. Personally I would love to see the world and rewards scale with item level with say a gold quest reward scaling from 50-500g so you can get up to x10 the reward but it also stays challenging all the time.
---
I hope not, cheaters deserve every punishment they get.
---
I agree when it comes to trying to figure out what is "accurate". However, private server comparison DOES provide value on the topic at hand (Dungeon Difficulty). We already know that it's accurate, but we can speculate on whether it's too easy based on whether the game is more or less enjoyable on private servers.
---
Prot Warriors don't even reach 10k armor until Naxxramas. Druids have about 11-13k armor during MC/BWL era.
---
There's also no fucking way in hell a Warrior pushes 9k HP with titans flask before Naxxramas is out.
---
Paladins are the best pvp support by far, if that is what you want to do.
---
Shamans are better for raid support.
---
On a side note of 'guild bullshit':
---
Have a guild wide conversation early and often as to what is expected, how things will run, and the processes that will be taken in situations we all experienced thru Vanilla. 
---
DKP or loot council - how its calculated and distributed. What classes can have things expected priority over others. Legendary items. DKP hoarding over raid progression. 
---
Even the 'obvious' things should be put out there. Maybe an OEB shouldnt go to a hunter first even if they have the highest DKP or bid. Should the first Thunderfury got to a main tank or a rogue? Is Dark Iron Ring a tank or healer item. Should PvP be considered when looking at drops.
---
Coming to a consensus on these things early will make life easier for everyone.
---
That and 40 man single guild raids are even less likely than in Vanilla, and raiding coalitions will have to do this but to an even higher degree.
---
I have a... negative take on "no changers" for these things... they just come off as scummy people who want to take advantage of an exploit or bug because they know it and the common person doesnt so they can have an advantage over them.
---
There are even chests in the starter area, i know of one on the middle troll camp and another inside the frost troll cave for the dwarf/gnome starter area.
---
&gt;the right term is damage dealer
---
Oh yeah, I’m sure you’re going to get one everyone’s friends list...

---
Holy shit man how you doing these days
---
I haven't played in several expansions so my information could be outdated but, where modern WoW fails most is in the integration between leveling and max level content. Like you say, there are a ton of people who've never done anything above heroic level dungeons, and many haven't even done those. They tried the game, face rolled some content a 3 year old could do, (literally...) got bored and quit long before ever being challenged and with a terrible opinion of the game.
---
If Classic WoW had expansions that fit with it's original design there would obviously be much more complex boss/mob mechanics by now, but it would also have challenging content right out of the gate. People who are stickers for Classic were discouraged by the game's sudden lack of immersion, world &amp; community significance, and progressive difficulty. Rather than "couldn't keep up" the vast majority were very likely bored to tears by the game's overhauled design and didn't even touch the difficult content.
---
GW2 has *much* less content too.
---
WoW is cheap for the amount it gives you.
---
Sure, go for it.
---
You realize that the entire game can't be balanced around 40 man raids having exactly equal numbers for every single class and spec right? Hunters and warlocks favor solo play because of pets. Therefore they are less needed in raids but thrive out in the world when alone. And the important thing is that they *can* raid. Every class can in one way or another. The reason why WoW is the way it is today is exactly because they tried to "balance it" like you seem to want
---
Sometimes, when they're on sale.  Regular price on them is hella expensive though.
---
can we maybe sticky this? this is super important and actually useful compared to the megathread
---
Increasing the cap allows the beta testers to go through the leveling process (whether by questing, grinding, or however they choose to do it), which then allows for testing all of that stuff.  If they jump people to 60 immediately, it means there's less testing of the content, which defeats the whole purpose of a beta test.  They aren't releasing a game where we'll all be instant 60, they're releasing a game where people will be leveling to get there, and they want to test the process to make sure it works correctly.  If people don't want to test the process, they shouldn't sign up to be beta testers.
---
If you are on a private server they are going to be quite rare in part because the population on the server is so cranked up.
---
All things that I think would absolutely be worth exploring down the line.
---
I mean... if you play for 3 years, $15/mo adds up to $540 not including any expansions.. that is not a cheap game
---
That's the Meta. Don't get mad at me.
---

This is one of several comparisons I did a while back. The left is my Warrior in 2006 wearing 7/8 T2 with roughly 10k armor vs my armorcapped Druid on a private servers.
---
Factor in the blocked value and Def stance and we can still see the Druid taking significantly more damage than the Warrior despite having 5000 additional armor.
---
This is funny AF and also very well done. Hope he enjoyed it
---
Yes nerf and normalize anything that’s fun. Sounds like retail wow.

No, even on private servers it isnt done in a day. It'll take a little while.

Hi there. You can join the main theorycrafting discord or the Druid discord. To note, the Druid discord is the biggest classic class discord and is super busy. Here's the links:
---
Theorycrafting: https://discord.gg/xH7bXA
---
Druid Classic: https://discord.gg/Epy3wk
---
I don't wanna seem rude but this seems to me as much a solution as the solution to people dying to starvation being "give them food". It'd be great if we could give good progression without power creep but what would that look like? purely cosmetic?
---
Crogge made a forum post admitting to selling gold. You can also try to find other posts of why they wouldn't revert the changes made to brd/dm etc. Almost every dungeon got their nodes nerfed.
---
Dont be passive aggressive with your crappy memes when you dont know what you're talking about...
---
So what? 
---
No changes. I’m good with how it is.
---
I've been thinking alot about this too. Mainly because I would love to see more classic content and am very very much against anything where the level cap is increased.
---
I was thinking maybe future raids could have gear with attributes or bonuses that were only active in that raid. To prevent extreme disparity between new and old 60s basically... either that or I have been thinking open some new zones like hyjal post naxx and make everything in it hard as fuck and basically require naxx level gear to do anything in it. It's really hard to balance I think but the most important thing going forward is to build horizontally I think
---
Wait, you think the game was popular because most specs were awful?
---
Black smithing/ mining. I love the blacksmith aesthetic and most of the weapons I want need blacksmithing to make
---
If they do decide to do something about this, they need to be upfront about it as early as possible. Whether or not we can farm Dire Maul Lashers will determine if I roll a Priest or not... If we can't do it then Priest is definitely off the table because I need a class that can farm gold easily... I'm sure other people will have similar considerations.
---
Yeah I can’t argue - it’s a difference of opinion. My favorite part of pvp is positioning well and using the environment to your advantage, which I think are especially important in quick fights. I also come from playing fps’s so I like the quick thinking/reactivity part. But I respect your different play style/preference!
---
Then go play on a private server?
---
Blizzard says the game is like this. Why do we need to make it more private server like?
---
Relax, I just saw now. lol
---
Doesnt matter, ill gank everyone with my night elf hunter. Like EZ
---
If a Priest player is not actively dispelling ice barriers, max rank rejuvs and regrowths or preparing to dispel nature's swiftness... idk what to say to them.
---
It's not even like an incredibly high skill thing these days, it's kind of just standard play to dispel ahead of time so you have a chance at sniping their NS.
---
Did I say nobody had fast connections back then? No I did not.
---
Obviously some people did but they would have been the minority so it's not really relevant. The players complaining about the batch window being bigger is very likely to be part of the majority that had slow connections. You also cannot rule out faulty memory.
---
Restorative potion
---
Most of the stuff people wrote macros for were brainless non-decisions, like using Execute over anything else if it *could* be used, or using Repentance if Hand of Justice was on cooldown since they were nearly identical effects. It wasn't people trying to avoid using their brains, it was people trying to save keyboard space by cutting down on excess hotkeys.
---
Back during vanilla 1.12 I got 3 classes to 60; my warrior used some really lengthy macros for Execute &gt; Bloodthirst &gt; Whirlwind &gt; Heroic Strike and my paladin used a couple light ones for Hammer of Wrath &gt; Judgement, but my rogue never used any because it's *always* a situational judgement call as to whether you want to save up for a 5-point Eviscerate, pop it early to try to finish off a target, or go for a Kidney Shot or something instead to buy more time. 
---
With the retail macro system, my warriors will have to start holding Shift when the target reaches 33% for the exact same functionality. Does that seem much more engaging to you?
---
Pre-job:  "Man I wish I could pay in game gold to keep my subscription going."
---
Post-job:  "Man those gold farmers are really onto something, maybe I should just go for it, there's a chance I may not get hacked."
---
Is there a comprehensive list of things that are changing and not staying true to Vanilla?
---
Hybrid tri-spec masterrace !!! (pvp priest)
---
'It's okay that you're not brought to the challenging, well rewarded parts of the game, because you're good at the easy stuff that isn't nearly as rewarding, and other classes can group up to do the stuff that you do anyway'.
---
Not a great system.
---
Yes, every class can raid, but when only one role out of the three that you have is viable, that's not very helpful to people that wanna play prot paladins or whatever.
---
But my pet peeve is important and will makes life easier and more fun while still remaining in the spirit of vanilla. It's only other people's changes that are wrong!
---
Nice copy pasta
---
Okay that's fine, you are entitled to your opinion. I was contesting your statement that "there's nothing to be done about it"
---
With the exception of shaman, all the healer pve specs are best or very close to best specs for pvp.  
---
Hpaladin needs 31 holy for pve, after that you can do what you want.  31/20/0 is great support, wsg escort build.  31/0/20 with spell power gear is shockadin.  
---
Rdruid flag running build and pure pve build is only a couple of points different.  
---
holy/disc is usually better in pve then disc/holy but most raids will be fine accepting a disc priest or two in their raid just for the buffs that disc brings.
---
Any video of duelling?
---
All builds are being talked about there.
---
[https://discord.gg/fA8gj64](https://discord.gg/fA8gj64)
---
Pretty sure people still bring hunters and warlocks on raids.
---
Hmm. the spec I'm most looking forward to playing isn't the spec I'll be starting out/leveling in.
---
Whew, that's a relief. What is the classic client, like &lt; 2gb?
---
agreed
---
I agree, but i was a young boy by then. Kids do stupid things.
---
How Odysseus felt when he finally reached Ithaka?
---
Lol what a bunch of snowflakes. Im happy you nerds didn't get beta. At least the game is good for now.
---
This is good lmaoo
---
There's other reasons. Having 2 Warriors and 1 Druid as your guilds tanks over 3 Warriors let you gear those two Warriors up a lot faster as well.
---
&gt;Well, we know that Private Servers are easier. A bunch of mobs didn't have abilities and the boss stats were all wrong, especially parry. So #3 is wrong.
---
Man it's funny how easy it is for miss information to spread on this sub.
---
&gt; I really don’t get you people
---
We're chasing the Vanilla experience, not specific HP/dmg values. Part of the Vanilla experience is the threat of wiping, such that you feel accomplished when you get the loot you wanted. Unlike LFR, where you get loot for free.
---
Also, many classes were stronger in 1.12 than in earlier patches. So while 1.12 is the most polished patch, it also doesn't best represent the true difficulty of Vanilla.
---
Still waiting on my Dwarf Mage...
---
They aren’t timegated this time
---
What are you talking about? The tournament hasn't been ruined...
---
Some things I consider:
---
Consumable requirements for raids
---
Ease of leveling
---
Speed bonus while leveling
---
Farming potential
---
Can you PvP with raid gear
---
Can you PvP with raid spec
---
How easy is it too get groups
---
Rotation
---
It's not the best way to make gold but it works, and it's chill af
---
Arena Master trinket
---
I’m curious if this makes raiding at end game content easier? That’s what I fear. I played in bc and if you didn’t manage your mana you would oom at 50%. If they take less dmg overall and this effects raiding and healers not needing to drink etc that would be basically retail 2.0. That’s the prob with lvl 30 cap. We won’t know end game.
---
Definitely differs throughout the country but overall, wages have definitely increased to match inflation or even go higher than it.
---
&gt;2) 3/5 is good enough for PvP
---
Even if the opponent has shadow resistance?
---
While this is an important factor that can be hard to look at, the price of food increasing over time is actually only a tiny fraction of the price of other things that have increased, namely real estate and automobiles.
---
Absolutely insane that people downvoted you. Fuck this sub.
---
Did blizzard state that it was a bug and not just a feature that they changed their mind about?
---
Wouldn't Command scale off of AP and crit too, since it's 70% of your attack's damage? Or is it just the weapon's base damage?
---
Love it
---
I'm going to lead raids again.  Can be done on any class really, but I think it's just easier to be main tank for positioning control.
---
Keeping doing great things
---
Could have been a different guy with the same name.
---
Im so torn on this.... On one hand I like the wild west nature of classic, on the other hand it allows twitch chat to walk among the streamers and ruin everything!
---
Yep, I’ll probably play it for a month or two till I get bored and then raid log.
---
The artificial spell batching they did feels really, really bad. Every time you loot it just feels like a half second of lag. Definitely not bothering with mining since you cant hit modes again immediately or they won't work.
---
Probably quit when it wasn’t possible. For him to simply say “Tauren paladin, what?” And get downvoted on a classic wow sub is fucking insanity.
---
interesting. so druid tank may be not only viable, but better?
---
wat
---
&gt;Realist : "The other costs are 30% more expensive than 15 years ago"
---
Nitpicker using most recent info: aggregate costs for households are 33.7% higher since WoW's release date, but median personal earnings are 39.9% higher. So for the US, WoW is more affordable than ever before.
---
wow your so cool
---
Haha I know exactly what you mean.
---
Never hurts to ask.  My buddy and me back in the day both got our original accounts banned for the same thing.  Mine wasn’t restored but my buds was.  Good luck!
---
The only people ruining it are the whiny babies like sodapoppin raging on stream about people standing some where he doesn’t like.
---
I levelled in STV two times back in vanilla (rogue and warlock) and had exactly zero problems. In fact, I'd say I was the one initiating fights more often (on a RP-PVP server).
---
Yeah so what exactly are you talking about? Nothing has been ruined calm yourself
---
The smell of BS surrounds this post
---
All servers have good raid guilds.

console commands to increase view distance
---
A common misconception is also that you need a Pummeler for every boss in the raid. This is far from the truth, as most bosses do not require the threat output of a Druid with MCP.
---
When I would tank, I would only use a Pummeler for Fankriss in AQ40, Vaelastrasz and Broodlord. I would also sometimes use a Pummeler on Garr if I was tanking the boss and we did the burn strat where you offtank all the adds to the side and kill the boss before he can dispel peoples world buffs.

You can’t really compare this game release to anything in the history of gaming.  You’re talking about a top 3 highest grossing computer game of all time with massive cultural impact grand releasing an old version of the game with millions of active subscribers still playing the current version.  
---
This is a release predicated on nostalgia not improvement.  So it’s just bizarre to me that people who never played it...only played later versions of it are hyped.
---
I know you're slow, so i'll drag you along my train of thought so you don't get lost. Think about how much of a flying fuck you give about what I think of you. Now flip that on its head and multiply it by at least 10 trillion. The guy is wasting his life away in a factory. It might be for the benefit of his family, but HIS life is being wasted. He will never get these monotonous, turgid weeks of putting screws into screw holes back. You bigger picture retards forget that everyone is an individual just like yourself.
---
Fuck the haters. Content is content. I didn't know about this item before, thanks for the vid.
---
Yea, I'm interested as well. I personally hope they continue to increase the level cap so we can find out about more about higher level content.
---
We want accurate. If you want enjoyibility then play a different game.
---
Do you two happen to be related in any way, with Nixxiom?
---
You savage! After getting Grand Marshal, I too thought I'd grind out the winterspring mount. I made it like 2 weeks and said "fuck this". It truly is a time sink I don't think most people understood. I feel bad for the people who got it, and now you can get it in 3 weeks with like 10-20 minutes a day. They didn't even change the model like they usually would in that scenario...
---
It's 100% guaranteed to be a false memory since Blizzard knows what the batch window was and has set it to the same now.
---
And players that played with low latency and okay FPS wasn't a small minority of players. That's my point. It wasn't a demanding game even when it came out. Sure, a lot of people got to play it for 20 minutes on the family PC on a 56kbit connection outside in the snow uphill, but everyone I know and every community I frequented at the time had what you'd call a "gaming" computer (ie a computer with a dedicated graphics card and 1gbyte+ of ram) , and ADSL or fiber.
---
Basically this. I agree here completely. We want a full on vanilla experience. I don’t recall healers not ooming at all in wc or sfk or armory deadmines.
---
In addition to Spell/Holy damage, spell crit% and spell hit% (+3% cap for PvP) will help your effective DPS output too.
---
I plan to run LC in my guild, but I plan to have it very open as to why players receive gear, and when they should expect it.
---
First, I will have every raider submit their 'bis' list per content release. Players are not required to submit their exact bis (for example, if a gnomes bis would be a sword, but they know swords are going to humans first...), however once they receive that piece, they can not receive another piece for that slot except on an off/pvp spec roll, or if it is from the next set of content.
---
Second, the amount of bis and non bis gear handed out to each player will be recorded and publicly available to everyone in the guild (as well as who else wanted each piece of gear). Everyone can expect that their should be as even as possible a distribution of bis and non bis gear amongst players, except at the start of MC where tanks will receive a slight priority (I am currently undecided how many pieces of priority, probably 2-3). If there are players who no show frequently, they can expect to be behind.
---
Lastly, every week a non officer will be elected out of the raid group to join the LC, so that the LC will consist of 3 officers, myself, and the elected 'champion'. Once elected champion, one cannot be elected for 4 weeks, which should somewhat prevent one person being permanently elected to the position.
---
Only time will tell.
---
Nah lol, but my cousin does kinda look like him now that you've said that
---
I see [rising wages in the US](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252881500Q). Do you live in Venezuela perchance?
---
They did the leveling process 1-30. So 30-40 there will be more bugs to report leveling? Nobody is ever gonna do all the quests and kill all the mobs and be able to report every single issue in the game.
---
That’s why I said the last few weeks of the beta you give people instant 60s to test specs, talents, end game dungeons, etc.
---
Who’s testing the process, people who’ve already done it? People who have never played the game get a general idea of if they want to play it. And everybody who has played it... well they already know what to expect with the game.
---
People don’t want the beta to raise the cap to test more and report bugs. People just want more to do than just be capped at 30. They want to play classic so bad and don’t want to wait, so they want level cap raises so they can do more. That’s what I really think this whole thing is.
---
I remember watching this back in the day. Couldn't find part one though with the gnome.
---
Wow forums.
---
Me: well I hate melee, so a rogue, warrior, paladin is already out.
---
I was already a hunter main for 3 years on retail, so I'm not interested in doing that again.
---
Druid and shaman just don't sound appealing to me -- seems like they both will only be useful in one or two specs, neither of which interest me. Nope.
---
So we're down to warlock, priest, mage.
---
Mage interests me more than warlock, so now it's between priest and mage.
---
Idc either way really, but the guy I'll be playing with wants to be priest, so I'm going with my other top option of mage.
---
Very welcome apollexis !
---
I had it initially down to Hunter, Rogue, Druid, Warrior, Priest or Paladin/Shaman. 
---
Going Horde with friends so Paladin gone. Dropped Rogue, Priest and Sham due to playing with friends and wanting to tank for friends while leveling. Then my wife decided she wanted to play as well so I went from Horde to Ally. Which put Paladin back in the mix. Added Rogue back in too, as my play group went from large to small (only 1 friend will be joining us on ally). Removed hunter cause my good friend is going hunter, so if I do play one it will be an alt not a main. 
---
Left me with Warrior, Paladin, Rogue and Druid. I like stealth to much to remove Rogue and Druid. Not a huge fan of Paladin auto swing style in vanilla so dropped them. So War, Rog and Dru. Well I want to be able to tank while leveling and solo, don’t mind healing and like stealth. Druid it is.
---
Jesus Christ Reddit.
---
I'm not sure if it should be fixed or not. I am absolutely planning to farm DM lashers for money if I main Priest so fixing it would be an inconvenience for sure. Does fixing it even change much? You can take off gear and die to get back which is slower but it's still doable. I think there are definitely some expectations of being able to do this.
---
Maybe it's something Blizzard should address specifically with a blue post early enough because it will probably affect people's decisions on which classes to roll. If it becomes non-viable to farm DM as a Priest then I simply won't roll the class, gold-making ability is a big part of choosing one class over another.
---
Can you give some more info? List talents progression (did you go balance at first, indeed?), when did you grind instead of questing etc?
---
No, it was him! I thought the same, but I went to his YouTube channel to see his videos and he has a video with a character (Druid) named Skarmbrena, and that character was his alt! Think he also had a pally called Skarmabless? Not sure but cool to stumble upon that and connect the dots!
---
Keyword is “essentially” but yes in exact amounts you’re correct.
---
Median wage is up 39.9% in that time period, so in aggregate yes. [Sauce](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252881500Q)
---
Consideration: Can it tank *well*?
---
Made my list pretty short.
---
&gt;Why do people keep comparing price/value of different medias?
---
Because it puts things in perspective.
---
Worrying about the cost of games or books is a waste of time if you are spending 5 times as much going out.
---
Christ that chick gets cooler the more I learn about her.
---
Indeed, the progressive itemization that pservers have changes pretty much every BiS list

Keyword is “Essientially”, but in exact terms you’re correct.
---
Pretty sure he's talking about the Collection Plate quest reward that a bunch of people got recently. It has ~1400 armor.
---
In vanilla elite gards where summoned when you attacked or was attacked by civilians. This is not the case on most privet servers we will have to se how many spawns and how hard they are
---
&gt;You're wrong. Inflation has increased but in the US wages have not. It cost the same as it always did.
---
Youre sadly mistaken. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252881500Q

craghack\_tv ... where did I hear that name? Ah, Privatserver Streamer. So the stats were wrong on privat servers. The bosses were more easy during classic. But yeah, miss information.
---
Wages have kept pace with inflation or slightly exceeded it.
---
Not true at all
---
Is median wage okay? [Because it has definitely risen]( https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252881500Q)
---
I sure hope we get Burning Clicksade servers after Classic Reddit
---
Yeah i do hehe
---
This is probably the best idea. The early zones are going to be a shit fest anyways. Just slog your way through and get to the Barrens... and pray you can find someplace to grind or something.
---
&gt;According to #nochanges, giving any ground will enable Blizzard to make a slippery slope back into retail.
---
False. People  tend to be perfectly accomodating of the concept of any part of original Vanilla being considered.
---
One thing I've been doing is watching a full playthrough of warcraft 3 and warcraft 3 frozen throne with no commentary. Pretty great way to get some sweet lore and have it playing on your second monitor if you dig your lore feed that way. Otherwise, some of the suggestions for books here are spot on.
---
imagine caring about a fucking duel tournament at lvl 30, jesus don't you people have something better to do?
---
I feel as though these types of questions receive responses with certain assumptions. 
---
Comparing class DPS in hypotheticals assumes equal gear, and usually BIS. That’s very unlikely for Vanilla. 
---
Each toon has 14 slots for armor, rings, and trinkets. And 2 to 4 (1-2 melee, ranged and quiver, idol, librams, totems, etc) slots for weapons and accessories
---
So if you’re a dual wielding hunter, you’re looking at up to 18 items to optimize. (Idk if this is BIS).
---
There are 40 people per raid. 
---
(40)(18)= 760 slots to fill out. (Realistically 700).
---
There also 8 classes, 
---
(40 players)/(8 classes) = 5 of each class
---
This won’t be true for each class, but it’s close. 
---
Each boss dropped about 3 pieces of loot. 
---
Ten bosses in MC means about 30 drops per raid. 
---
There are 8 classes, so...
---
(30 drops)/(8 classes)= 3.75 items per class
---
This assumes a full clear each week. 
---
(3.75 drops per class)/(5 of each class)=0.75
---
You have a 75% chance of getting 1 loot per week. 
---
If each phase is 6mo long, that’s 26 weeks. 
---
(26 weeks)(0.75 loot chance)=19.5 weeks 
---
19.5 weeks where you’ll get a piece of loot
---
. 
---
Whether you win said item varies due to:
---
Raid rules of distribution
---
Competition (maybe you have 7 hunters)
---
Guild turn over/pugs affect things too. 
---
You CAN reach that sweet sweet BIS status. 
---
But this assumes no duplicates drop.
---
And, assumes everything drops at least once.
---
And, this assumes you’re inline to attain it each time. 
---
This is what makes the Vanilla experience amazing. Some guilds will see the first three bosses drop all hunter loot and hunters will carry progression. Some guilds will see all warrior loot and warriors will carry progression. Some guilds will have a normal distribution and slow build everyone. 
---
Many good players leave high end guilds for a second or third tier guild just because they’ll have a better shot at loot. Being 1 of 4 hunters increases your loot rate to 80% or 21/26 weeks (or two more pieces of loot)
---
RNG is not your friend in these raids. But if you want to increase your chances of big DPS, solidify your spot in a guild. Try to be an officer, or ranged team leader. Be available, be valuable, and be loyal.
---
Thanks, back in the day haha.
---
[deleted]
---
It's more likely because people are significantly better now.
---
thanks for the info y'all!
---
Alternately, time spent on WoW could be spent working!
---
Haha. I'm talking about the people who don't like the idea of Classic, but spend time and effort on trolling the forums of people who do.
---
People who're actually good on retail don't have a reason to give a shit, because they don't care who joins or leaves the game.
---
Yet here you are, lol.
---
&gt;Let’s say you increase your weapon skill by 4. Against a mob 3 levels higher than you, you get: 0.8% lower chance to miss, 0,4% lower chance to get dodged, 2,4% to be parried, and a 0,8% higher chance to crit. That means a 4,8% net increase.
---
This is from a tbc era blue post, which means it has to be accurate, at least for tbc. This does indeed suggest 0.6% parry reduction per ws.
---
I'm very aware of the 0.04% figure you're passing around, but I've never heard a source for it. If you know where that figure comes from, please do tell. I know it's on vanilla wow wiki, but where did they get it from?
---
Nope, beta testers confirmed you can learn weapon skills from level 1 provided you have the money.
---
Can you recover accounts from like 2007?
---
Wages have matched inflation.
---
i guess we’ll have to see.  i love this game...i played it at launch and stopped after tbc...but it is a huge downgrade in terms of features...i’m incredibly eager to play on launch but i know a lot of it is nostalgia...i just can’t see too many modern gamers who never played the original iteration loving it enough to get to end game.  
---
But im not an expert...and certainly Asmon, Esfsnd, and Soda are influencing the younger streamer generation and making them interested.
---
Turns out yet again that PS got it wrong...
---
TBC was the sweet spot. Every spec was pretty great in some way or another, support specs actually existed which I liked a lot (played enhance shaman) but there was almost no homogenization. WotLK took it too far with handing out class buffs and abilities to others.
---
We're not going to have arenas...
---
&gt; That's a pretty solid point that I don't think people get. Blizzard hasn't raised the price of their sub ever. It's been $15 a month since launch. How many other pay to play games can say that?
---
How many other games have a purchase price, a monthly sub, a "micro"transaction shop, real money trading (Tokens), and 15-20€ for simple changes in a table which are completely automated (racechange, serverchange, namechange)?
---
Really the only thing missing are lootboxes. And you guys seriously go around feeling proud that Blizzard is so nice to not raise the price of the sub...
---
I’m not good at wow stats, so is that sword good or is it mostly just a cool looking sword to have
---
Sodapoppin is seriously the biggest baby I've ever seen.
---

&gt;is simply nowhere near a good enough deal for me.
---
What kind of fucking joke is that? I'll never understand people that complain about the WoW sub price. You get a game, even if the content is old, that can easily give you 40+ hours of gametime per week (if you're that kind of a gamer) - for years. The content will be released in phases and the amount of things you can do is just as much as before.
---
People will buy a cinema ticket for 15$, have fun for 3 hours and afterwards only remember the movie. WoW is a LOT more entertainment for that amount of money. 15$ per month for a "full time hobby" is simply not much. And in the end, even if it has already been developed, you still get the entire content...
---
I played before Maul came out and we called it VC. No need to get emotional or attack people for calling instances what they called them. Direct that anger at more important things.
---
He said UBRS mate...
---
I’ve seen a few examples in the forums and on Reddit.
---
this tourney is scuffed af. So many trolls just running through the duel area, health plates of everyone shown, chat spamming that they cant see a thing, location wasnt in a contested zone so duel mods could enforce trolls....the list goes on. This was so poorly organized and for them to think that muscling through it will work is nonsense. Move the location next time
---
That's an awful lot of prot warriors. Something ain't right here.
---
Get my Boomstick we have sootin to do lol
---
You will still be wasting weeks leveling different classes in the beta.
---
Level as enh and use a 2h and rockbiter. You can tank dungeons in classic as shaman so get a 1h and shield also. Use windfury/flametoung if you are dps in a dungeon and windfury for pvp.
---
Shield, 1h and flametoung is more for relaxing while grinding and watching netflix thing (opinion).
---
There is absolutely no way I am farming Naxx level consumables and doing TBC onwards level mechanics for sidegraded and gimmicks on play style. Without power upgrades many players clear raid once (or not at all) and never go back.
---
I mean I remember Druid tanking some boss fights in vanilla in later raids. Patchwerk anyone? But it is definitely not something that every person who wants to go feral will be doing.
---
I plan on being feral, and would love to raid tank. Think I have the ability and can put in the effort to do it too. I’m just not gonna get super upset if I don’t and am completely ok with healing.
---
All good though TBC is where I shine anyways.
---
I calculate all my expenses based in Big Macs. Wow sub is roughly 3 Big Macs. Not bad
---
Why not state your time zone?
---
good op is not getting beta. if he does, you know he will be the tauren standing on top of duelist being annoying as f.
---
Yeah, I do agree that the homogenization of some of the buffs was a mistake. Overall though, I had more fun in Wrath.
---
If you are respeccing to ret, a slow hard hitting 2h, strength, melee crit, and spell power are the target stats.  
---
If you are staying holy and playing as shockadin, basically spell power above all.  Melee crit/hit/spell crit are more valuable then spell power but the cost on the stat budget is such that typically just targetting the pieces with the highest spell power will net the most overall damage output.  This includes wearing nonplate.  
---
The raid T2 set is quite good for hpaladin damage builds.
---
Grand Marshal with the Winterspring Frostsaber!
---
/played? lol
---
I hope that tauren gets his beta access revoked.
---
Pretty good tournament so far. Some really close fights. People here love to shit on Tipsout but his commentary is decent and whoever is casting with him is really energetic.
---
The ONLY serious problem I have with vanilla class design is that there is only one viable raid tank. I wish they had made one other class at least competitive with warriors on that front.
---
ya since most people don't know that its currently bugged that can tame up to level 32
---
At this moment I feel very related to your cousin. First I was 100% sure that I would go back to my roots and main a Druid. Now all I do in my free time is watch videos on: what class should you pick when Classic launches. Now I only have 2 classes excluded from the pool being Warrior and Huntard.
---
I mean, if you pull 1 mob or face pull and leash extras...dying in classic wow is embarrassing. 
---
Soloing elite quests, escorts and or intentionally pulling 3-4+ mobs is the only time leveling is challenging. 
---
1-20 is and has been a snooze since well...forever. Difference being we’ve al got 15 years of game knowledge now.
---
Anyhow did the Hamuul sageclaw escort in ashenvale last night. The bear in the cage in the furbolg cave.
---
Took me 3 attempts to solo it. Had to pre clear the route and be pretty intelligent as to my spell usage during the 3 mob scripted ambushes. 
---
Mostly cause I needed to learn when the scripted ambushes happen so I could react properly.
---
As a now Alliance player who has played Horde aswell, but started off in the game with Alliance, is it worth it to play Alliance for the nostalgia, but give up the playerbase of the Horde? I want to PvP pretty competitively come Classic, and I'm worried that if I go Alliance, I wont have access to the majority of the PvP population, being on Horde.
---
That sort of beta testing is useful for developing a new game, but WoW Classic is pretty set in stone design wise.
---
Beta would mostly be about finding bugs and building hype.
---
We could technically make it so all epics are actually a separate item ID, so before patch for example: Vendorstrike DEs into a Shard. When the AQ Patch drops, none of the items change, but enemies now drop a different ID of the same item. Vendorstrike now DEs into a Nexus Crystal.
---
I know its quite a bit of work, but that would be closest to OG Vanilla, when no one expected the Nexus Crystal conversion.
---
Alliance were so much better at PVE in vanilla that 36 out of 39 world first raid clears were done by the horde. The racials help, no doubt, but they are by no means dispositive.
---
I didn’t choice YouTubed policy of making videos 10+ minutes earn 3x as much as those that don’t.
---
Other people stretch the content out and thinly spread the quality so they can reach the 10 minute mark.
---
If I don’t make it, I’ll just stick a longer outro on it and keep the main video quality high.
---
Personally I like my method as everyone can see when the video is over regardless of the time remaining, and I don’t degrade the main video quality.
---
Wait but inflation causes everything else that I spend my money on day to day to be more expensive so if anything you’re just proving the subscription model never worked and should have never been implemented for 15$ a month especially for how garbage the return of investment has been for the past couple yeara
---
Beans
---
I don't think you understand that people who talk about WoW's pricetag doesn't have the funds to go out. We're not talking US 'I earn $60k a year, I'm poor types'. We're talking about 'I earn 12k € a year and that's a good amount where I'm from' types who don't go out to eat, don't go out to movies, doesn't get food delivered or eat at fast food places in general. People who are left with 120€ after bills/food to spend on everything else - clothing, emergencies, savings, whatever AND enterntainment.
---
'People should worry about increasing their income in that case instead of playing WoW' - THAT IS A GOOD INCOME FOR THE AREA.
---
Hell hide yo husbands too they rapin' everyone out here.
---
Well if that’s the case we should tune it slightly. I’ll prob get hit with downvotes but w.e. I still feel as though this is true. If the game is too easy is it really classic? I remember in bc dying as a warr or rogue to mob pulls. If people aren’t dying in vanilla without proper cc etc then it’s prob to easy
---
The only duelist that's bitching is sodapoppin, everyone else hasn't had a problem with the crowd. Chill the fuck out.
---
Almost everything can be transferred between the two.  One this that is not is the transporters.  Gnomish gets a trinket that teleports them to Tanaris, Goblin to Winterspring.  I typically think gnomish is better for the access it gives to things like dire maul and AQ.
---
Ya this is what I am mostly concerned with. How was the leveling in the beta? Was it faster or slower then pservers?
---
I might hate the Twitch chat community more than any other online community. It's so toxic, and their lingo sounds completely ridiculous. Lol, I sound like an old man saying that (I'm not).
---
More than classic wow?  GW2 has far far more....
---
&gt; But more generally, MMOs are very cheap compared to most forms of entertainment.
---
That's a ridiculous comparison.   It should be compared to other video games.
---
Haha, well, the educational value of the ban helped you then :D
---
I have a co worker who had a DUI and he's constantly bitching about the cost and hassle he has to go through to keep on driving. Drunk drivers kill people... and I always tell him that he deserves every last bit of the hassle...
---
$2000
---
&gt; Lucky for us, Blizzard hasn’t changed the price in 15 years.
---
But has added just about any thing for money that you can think of. Purchase price, "micro"transactions, real money trading (Tokens) and paid race-, name- and serverchanges.
---
I think the IMAX is wrong, because apparently he won't be maxing anything.
---
depends on country sadly, i pay 4 times more
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
I just wanted to add that Victory Rush was added in TBC and [only became available to low level warriors in 3.3.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Victory_Rush#Patch_changes)
---
I'm not accusing you of anything, and you definitely have your timelines right, but I've noticed a lot of WOTLK-haters don't seem to realize a lot of things were changed in TBC or Cata but act like it all happened in WOTLK. I've seen people shit on WOTLK because of LFR (???), for example. You can't even really say "LFD led to LFR", since pretty much no one was saying "I bet LFR is next" back in 2009.
---
It was a clear example to me that people's memories aren't nearly as infallible as they like to think, which is why I laughed through the "mobs don't hit hard!?!?!!?" "controversy" when beta launched.
---
I thought GS was dumb, too, but that was a player thing not a Blizz thing. I also know what you mean about tank threat, but I actually preferred the WOTLK model (let DPS go crazy but tanks can't be retarded); it was fun seeing if classes could reach their theoretical maximum DPS. Same thing with PvP, to an extent; S8 was too much damage and too much PvE gear for me, but S6 and S7 were good PvP. I played a ret paladin in WOTLK so I can't complain about S5 :D:D:D My only regret is not making a DK to go with my ret.
---
And I have a hard time calling the xpac that spawned [this](http://azeroth.metblogs.com/files/2009/10/catdps.jpg) a shift "towards modern button mashing". That's all Cata to me, especially when I think about hunter and warlock "rotations" back in TBC.
---
I thought prot warrior rotation was heroic strike spam?
---
Jellybeans just misstargeted due to trolls, bound to happen. Twitch chat unleashed is exactly as expected
---
By the whole realm? No. People aren't going to bother to build realm wide blacklists. Even if some are, far from the majority would use it.
---
No, but every online multiplayer game is toxic to some extent. Especially big mainstream ones like WoW.
---
Lmao awesome.
---
Arena Grand Master trinket provides a shield that absorbs 700-1300 damage or so.
---
Man you guys shit on retail so much and don’t even play it.
---
hahahahaha
---
Copper is usually easy to find early, but almost everyone gets stuck at tin.  Without a mount running around and finding enough tin takes hours and hours and usually isn't worth the time.  So most people wait until 40 mount or until 60 to backtrack and get mining back upto level.  
---
Once you have the mats leveling engr isn't that slow and for some classes can be somewhat useful.  
---
That being said, I plan on doing both at 60.
---
There are very few games that have such returns such as skyrim.
---
Compare it to ANY other hobby out there: 13€/15$ a month for full time entertainment is simply not much. There's no discussion about that. That's one cinema visit. 1 big/2 small fast food meals. The monthly price for many sport clubs (that still require gear). 
---
If your money is tight enough that the WoW sub is too much for you, get games like skyrim that have the biggest cost/money factor of all games. Or go full f2p, there are many out there. But for a pay to play game, WoW has so much content that it's more than worth it.
---
Clock is ticking my man, 3 months to go
---
You've had a very different experience than I have.
---
Yes, I know, I'm specifically talking about an actual shield.
---
We've already had this full discussion complete with the "yes, this is how it works"
---
What a helpful comment.
---
I dont really care about downvotes but this sub is weird at times. The idea of a tauren paladin is funny to me.
---
mistaske. anyway, can we focus on the question?
---
Hmm, the database says it has 88 armor.
---
It seemed pretty good in Legion. Especially Survival hunter lordy I was having an absolute blast.
---
Its closer to 6GB, but def not 60
---
If games were all about nostalgia, I’d be rip-roaring through the N64 Zeldas right now. As it happens, I don’t really have interest in playing anything besides Classic.
---
If it wasn't for the online store selling pets and mounts, and the token system selling subs at a + 5 dollar markup, then the regular sub price would have definitely gone up by now. We should be glad for these systems.
---
Tranquilizing shot rotations are 100% mandatory for raiding bud so that's a hard no.
---
Right someone who actually plays private servers maybe knows just a little bit more about them than some retard who watched a tipsout video ?
---
Shout out to that inbred Tauren running over duelists: Your mother should have swallowed you
---
Cool to see the top papers in modern wow coming back and performing against private server guys. I was reliably informed by some private server players they’d be absolutely stomped.
---
What? http://classicdb.ch/?item=4129
---
Asking someone to back up an outrageous claim with evidence isn't "memeing" it's being responsible.
---
I don't know anything about this Crogge guy, but a 5 second Google search shows that the forum post you mention was a fake:
---
&gt;Rondalf - Today at 6:39 PM @everyone Crogge's account has been compromised on Reddit via decryption of hash password LH is having at the moment ( usage of same passwords on the account he used as a player and one on reddit ). Post is fake and we will be filing a report to the Reddit administration about this matter.
---
So, you're spreading misinformation to push a dishonest agenda.
---
The DM changes were made on several servers because it had a harmful impact to the server's economy. But please tell me more about how private server GMs are running pedophila rings out of the basement of pizza shops.
---
The terms stand, anyone wants action dm me
---
This is the result of giving beta keys from giveaways.
---
Online communities have FOMO toxicity and this month Classic WoW is just the target for manchildren with immaturity problems to spread their wings and get all the attention to fulfill that void they’re missing in their lives.
---
It’ll pass over time, once another FPS comes out these content creators that just generate fake hype in order to gain subscribers for the next big thing will flock over to that.
---
One issue is that early on there will be very few people building raiding mats or any max level mats.  The overall economy will be very suppressed until the average player buys their epic mounts.
---
This could be me. I've only ruled out one class so far.
---
His fault for not tab targeting.
---
Yeah, just both level outta your starting zones. You friend can make it to Thunderbuff for about level 10, and you can make it to 10 then head to undercity. 
---
From this point, you can both jump the zeppelins to Orgrimmar and meet up to then quest in Durotar and make your way to the Crossroads in the barrens.
---
I'm playing a warlock. And this is extremely fine for me.

You guys seem all nice. Dont come to Ironforge tonight.

People will likely still die. Not everyone is going to be bis gear like these streamers and super organized.
---
They care a lot. 
---
I reported issues with wands. Fixed.
---
Reported issues with spell pushback on channeled spells. Fixed.
---
I reported issues with mobs spawning outside the game world. Fixed
---
I’ve reported issues with mobs agro radius vis a vis other mobs (ie escort quests). Not fixed.

STM for me :) I used to long distance hike the Black Hills / Custer State Park even into the Badlands in SD
---
In Mexico, the minimum wage is 176 MXN (9 USD) per day. that comes to about 5000 MXN (250 USD) per month, I'd say that for one person to live comfortably you'll need about 10000 MXN (500 USD) per month
---
Yea you complaining about a game that you’re paying for is much better.

Level as enhancement and get a 2h or a 1h &amp; shied. Shammy’s can tank lower level instances easy enough.
---
I‘m by no way a casual anymore even though I only started at WotLK and not vanilla. I‘m gonna recommend this video to my friend who starts woth wow classic (he never played mmorpgs before).
---
By the way: you got a nice and calming voice. Keep that series up! Thanks :)
---
Having a shitty inflated economy where the average casual player can't afford anything isn't "fun."
---
That's an awesome name for a warlock pet.
---
I can only remember my Imp's name: Gobtip
---
And rice
---
Yeah, wowhead is garbage for Classic.
---
In a clever way, the price did go up. Blizzard sells a lot of subscription tokens. The more they sell, the more additional money they make. It's 20 dollars per sub instead of the regular 15. Somebody somewhere had to buy that token with real money. Blizzard doesn't care who bought it, as long as they made their money. The more tokens get sold, the more they make.
---
On some bosses they will be better than Warriors, and on others they will be worse. On other bosses again it wont matter.
---
Same as it is on private servers.
---
Well I got triggered by it.
---
Fishing makes great gold....it’s just time consuming!!

I plan to level fishing and cooking while at lunch in work! 😀👍

I personally have no issues with big organized guilds showing up a "racing through the content" as I know I'm not one who would be in the front lines anyway.  Wasn't back in the day either.
---
But, if that really does cause grief for the *streamers* then I am all for it.  
---
Clear the raid content as quick as you can so streamers won't be wanting to join that realm.
---
DodgyKebaab is absolutely useless and produce shit content. How he got 30K subs is mind boggling.
---
If the heal outhealed the damage it will be processed at the same time and he'll live
---
Imagine your friend organizes a $2k tournament and when you try to help him deal with trolls you’re called a whiny baby.
---
I’m a pretty casual viewer of WoW streamers but this subreddit has gotta find a better hill to die on if you wanna shit on anything these streamers do so at least you don’t sound like a complete fucking nonce.
---
I actually thought that *was* Nixxiom and it was in reference to some stream he did. Then I read the title and the comments...
---
Calling him a retard does not help your argument, if anything it weakens it.
---
Paying $15 a month as a thank you for bringing back the greatest mmorpg ever made. Paying $15 a month to play something that was previously totally lost to us. Paying $15 a month for years upon years of truly satisfying gameplay, which is incredibly difficult to find today.
---
Hell, for that last point I would easily pay $100 a month.
---
Are you okay? These projections are really negative and excessive.
---
I’m trying to decide too. I was initially thinking Pally tank but I think I want my first char to be pure dps. I’ve always made it a point to be top dps on runs/raids. 
---
What y’all thinking? Rogue? Mage? Other?
---
Feel free to use the link wherever. The more people to submit their opinion the better.
---
Wait, your first comment implied that people can't complain if they don't play it. Now you're saying they can't complain if they DO play it. Which is it?
---
Also, you can buy game time with gold from the character select screen. Don't have to spend money.
---
im reading this page and it says the level req for the quest is 39. but you can get it at 30?
---
Vendoring skins actually worth??!!
---
The credits at the bottom of the poster makes more sens also lmao

Personally I'm playing mage, sweet portals

Agreed

The content is already downloaded, the data is just moving bits around to track your character and other environmental data, a phone tether should work fine
---
Only go when it’s on sale, you can also get that buy one get one on their app like most days :D
---
clearly in today's Market of games RP Servers keep games alive so I do not see why you wouldn't make a RP-PVP server... I mean  coem on Blizz
---
My class picking process is:
---
1 - What role do I want to fill? (DPS, tank or healer)
---
2 - What classes fill this role? (Priest, paladin, druid or shaman for me, as I want to heal)
---
3 - What are the unique things each of those classes add to the table? (long answer, but they all have unique aspects)
---
4 - Which of those things I can't live without? Which ones I can? How sought after are each of those classes in endgame?
---
This last question is the hardest, and I'm still stuck between Druid and Shaman (leanning towards Druid but who knows)
---
Lets add a slight context to after she stepped away. I joined part way through T4 content in BC.  Sadly, the guild lasted into ToC in Wrath. I left after we initially cleared ToC.  Naxx, OS, Malygos, etc had drained the guild after being on the hardcore side in BC.  We had stopped on Brutallus pre-nerf.  Really wish we'd had another couple of weeks of attempts on it. I had a slight grasp of what my bear butt was doing, but I caused a couple of wipes.  
---
By ToC the old raid group had been burning out since we killed Yogg in Ulduar.  I'm still proud of the world 689/US 199 Heroic Siege of Ulduar we accomplished before I left. I remember speaking to our recruitment officer one night in Ulduar and him talking about how he was burning out.  A number of raiders had changed specs or classes for Wrath.  I was different as I had just graduated college a few years prior.  I was jobless with way too much free time. Most of the guild was mid-20s or older so our lives were changing. I was one of the stubborn few who (I regret now) remained jobless for a bit longer. I was still of the more hardcore mindset and guild leadership had struggles finding new recruits. We were no longer the top server first or Alliance guild. So the new recruits were hit or miss and this frustrated an impatient and immature person such as myself.    I know the guild ended up merging with another guild shortly after I left.   
---
I left for "greener pastures".  That's thick with sarcasm. I do appreciate the guild I went to after Shandris.  It was one with a former guild priest and druid in it on another server. And my sarcasm has nothing to do with either of them as my own actions left to me leaving and souring friendships.  I had rolled an alt druid on their server, leveled to 80, and was allowed to run Naxx 25. Having become fairly entrenched in feral dps theorycrafting at the time I did very well.   Transferred my druid over and so began my wandering until I quit WoW.  Over the next four expansions I ended up in seven different guilds including two raiding guilds I failed at leading.   Must say post-Cata WoW wasn't as fun as Vanilla to Wrath.
---
You asked for others to also join in the disappointment. But based on your rude comment history I don’t think this is your real account.
---

---
Most of the changes people are asking for are things that were already in the books for vanilla that just mever got completed.
---
May I have your attention please? May I have your attention please?
---
Will the Karazhan raiders please sign up? I repeat, will the Karazhan raiders please sign up?
---
Comparing it to other forms of entertainment is completely disingenuous though.  You have to compare it to other video games.  
---
$270 for a remake is a laughable ripoff.   
---
Warcraft 3 is $30.  
---
SC is $20.  
---
AOE remastered is $20.  
---
&gt; But for a pay to play game, WoW has so much content that it's more than worth it. 
---
Worth it more than what?  Skyrim?   How is a cheap remake worth $270 when NEW triple A games are $60?  
---
Riddle me this.  If classic wow is worth $15 a month, then why is it that Retail + Classic not $30 a month?
---
Plenty of PvPers want to play Alliance races.
---
Resto Shaman will be my main for sure. Always been in love with that class.
---
Also looking forward to level Priest.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot stuff like that actually matters in classic. Although I used to love being a rogue and using vanish right before a wipe and then using jumper cables to rezz the healer. Made me feel super useful.

Sucks that they don't make the price affordable for lower income places.

I remember there was a dude offering to pay for anyone who couldn't afford the sub on this forum. I suppose he's rich af. Not sure how to find that post.
---
Does blizzard even give active player number stats out?
---
Positioning is one of my favorite parts of PUBG.
---
My main issue with his post is that he assumes extremely shitty healers.
---
I raided a shitload in vanilla as Resto Shaman and when I wasn't chain healing the raid I was pre-casting the appropriate spell on my designated tank. Those heals only passed if the tank's health dropped beneath the threshold of two MH heals.
---
This assumed the main healers were doing pre-casting as well, and they were, so it worked out. 
---
For what it's worth we had a druid tank who got to go MT/OT once we had cleared BWL twice. 
---
Now, healing him was a STRESSFUL. Those crushing blows and critical hits SUCK. A ridiculous amount of health is gone, and it wasn't unusual to see him at one-normal-blow-away-from-death. However, that said it also worked out just fine because those three hits leave a shitload of heals to flow in. 
---
Then why was it stressful?   
---
Because even though it's under control, well, *you're the healer*. The tank has so stay alive and it's *on you.* A tank at 20% is entirely close to your ultimate failure.
---
...you think people can have gold to buy tokens without paying money for the game???
---
Please explain how he got gold to buy time if he doesn’t own the game?
---
Trying to visualize how I'll play it, and take into consideration my time, and how effective I want to be.
---
My favorite classes/specs would be Enh shaman, BM Hunter, Rogue, Feral Druid, Affliction Lock. Right off - in Vanilla I had much more time to play (young kid). I have 2 kids and work 50-60 hours a week now, so I immediately have to be honest with myself, and cross Feral and Enhancement off my list. I won't play enough to make them any bit valuable since they are already gimped.
---
That leaves Rogue (my original main), Aff lock, and Hunter. I've been playing Enh sham since TBC, but my Lock and Hunter have been second most. I tried them both on a Pserver because it's very hard to remember back then, and I'm glad I did.
---
Hunter: I completely forgot, but the auto shots and aimed shots are awful to me. I used to love hunter in vanilla - had a 60, and a 19, 29, 39, 49 twink hunters. Loved them. Going back, it feels incredibly clunky to me, and I've decided it just isn't for me anymore.
---
Rogue: still fun, and I seriously considered playing it, but I do remember being completely useless when caught out of stealth. This made it awful when you were grinding mobs open world and got ganked. No chance to survive unless they sucked and you could vanish/jump them. There's also a shit ton of rogues, so idk if I want to compete with them.
---
Lock: I actually loved my Lock the most in TBC, didn't have one in Vanilla. I don't like retail with the combo points on locks, I like the simplistic focus on DoT, and fearing at the right times. Tried it on the Pserver, it's fun, and I think overall it will be the best choice for me. I also plan on playing SM/Ruin for PvP and pve, so it makes it a bit easier so I don't have to respec.
---
Anyone managed to play the beta without being subbed?
---
I bought game time with a token, been screwing around on Moon Guard. I've been leveling some characters, pre-60. It's okay - I've been purposely avoiding using a mount if I'm under 40, been trying to walk everywhere to get back that sense of exploration. It sort of scratches the itch, but it is SO incredibly easy.

He may have it, i got in on day2 and still haven’t received an email
---
If everyone thought the same it would be a very boring life, I disagree with any changes as it would water down the classic experience BUT I can understand when people ask for small changes.
---
Whether short sighted or a considered approach people will always have opinions and suggestions, for instance, I wouldn't hate dual spec but only because I am married/work 6 days a week/have a child now compared to being a child with unlimited free time last time I played classic WoW.
---
I am however, completely fine with no changes at all.
---
I'll repost a comment from upchain for you: 
---
&gt;Classes were balanced around being different. There was a rock-paper-scissors balance in PvP and in PvE every class had a role even if they weren't topping the meters. And even if one spec wasn't useful in one situation doesn't mean it won't work for something else. I am so looking forward to actual class fantasy again, and not everyone just being a different reskin.
---
Rephrased: Classes were unique. They could be marginal at something but great at something else. Everything had a use somewhere and so classes had identity. That's important to many people who value a sense of reality in the game world.
---
Yes, I watched Sonii get it. An alliance hunter helped him kite the quest mobs to the Booty Bay guards.
---
50 cents a day for a months worth of unlimited entertainment is expensive? 
---
Look at some bar tabs at an attempt for one night, not even guaranteed.
---
Are all retail players as disconnected with reality and grumpy as you are? 
---
If I find the game disappointing in comparison to classic that is my opinion, it does not mean I will not find enjoyment in playing.
---
You can either help out and suggest a server or get the fuck out of here, because your triggered assumptions and rage are not welcome.
---
I didn't call him a retard to help my argument, I did it because that is my opinion and I'm willing to share it.
---
That sounds dope hahaha
---
They’re also not part of what made vanilla such a great game.
---
they should take away the beta access from people grieving the tournament and staying on top of duelists. its a big community tournament and a good publicity for the game and this subhuman trash are ruining it
---
Apart from him I’ve enjoyed it. He needs to have his beta revoked. Very surprised the GMs haven’t acted.
---
If you had the gold sitting around from PAST times that you've played, then yes, you can easily have gold. Most of us here have played the game at some point in time, so it's not unreasonable to assume that a bunch of us have enough gold lying around for a free month of play.
---
Man I really miss doing 5-mans in classic.  I remember when pulling was usually left up to the Hunter and it was a skill that many could execute but not nearly as many could master.
---
Also MDing to a group member if you were getting kicked out of the instance was just some of the best instant gratification you could get in that game.
---
And TBH honest I am sick of the no changes community. Hypocrites and unable to produce one good point against well thought out changes that in fact add more to the game without ruining it. Just their usual logical fallacies. Fact is if Classic does well, then Blizzard is going to add. They can keep the no changes crowd on their own server with no changes the rest of their miserable lives.
---
Eh that really depends on what you want though. Pservers with instant 60/high xp rate can give you a great look at how classes feel like at 60.
---
Literally just came across a post for locating lost connections. I remember most of my previous friends, but I'm sure it can still be used for finding some buds to play with. 
---

Look at that!! It's back up!! LOL. . It took me coming to Reddit to get it fixed?
---
On a side note. . That was not fun. . Google just gave us  the 1% of the 99% uptime?
---
Ah yes, holding it in a contested area wouldn't lead to any trolling or griefing. Brilliant plan.
---
Not really worried about that.
---
Oh wow, thats quite the statistics. It should go on the main page here. Thanks
---
DUI vs Botting in a video game

Lmao stop

Should just keep sticking his ass on a different layer or teleport him to STV
---
except character limit per server. and half of it will be hunters
---
Its entertaining to watch and I enjoy it. I dont enjoy greedy 3min outros though and 10min videos streched to 10min to be 10min.
---
Everyone that thinks Vanilla couldn't have been better is delusional.
---
Yeah I subbed about 8 months ago and encountered the ez ride. Still miss being in the world tho and wanted to start fresh to kill some time.
---
Great to know since I'll be outleveling my friends and can help my tank friends do this when they hit 30.
---
Honestly, anyone who cries about Classic's sub are insane. If you have the latest expansion, you're paying $15 a month but get access to retail and Classic for one sub. Blizz could have tried to make people pay for a retail and Classic sub.
---
Yeah lol.. but same principle.
---
Does that class have MInd Control? Then it’s decided
---
Some things in classic are just blatantly broken and doesnt make the game any better.  The core philosophy of the game made it good.  Not every broken function inside it.
---
The same goes for all tanks. Not everyone is able to do it. It's not that hard but let's be real, not everyone are the brightest. I'll roll a druid as well later. My main will always be priest by I enjoy druid pvp alot and like how druid is quite decent in all roles with one spec.
---
I hope the quality does not go down now that they sold to Boston brewing.
---
The one that most people seem to be missing or not mentioning is esports, specifically 1v1 balancing. Other games need strong pvp elements to keep players hooked and thus continuing to play the game. If one class is considered OP everyone in the game migrates to that player. The largest visible impact in the game we've seen from this is the removal and replacement of of the talent system. It's a million times easier for the devs to balance the classes when they have basically 3 specs per class to balance vs constantly thinking about what strange combination of talent points might someone pick that ends up being OP together.
---
I see you didn't actually read what the add on does...
---
Fetid! Foul humans and their silly games!
---
Make it so you can buy snowballs year around.
---
If you just want to find out if what class you're gonna like, absolutely. There are like two instant 60 servers I think, can't remember their names though. As far as getting access goes, head to the website and follow the instructions.(which pretty much always go "create account, download client, change realmlist"
---
TBC is the best but it would have been a lot beter with no flying.
---
Agreed!
---
In general, I do feel that each zone have it's own "beauty" and mood, and I honestly don't dislike a single one with one exeption: Silithus. 
---
It's not a zone per se, but Undercity is also the worst...
---
I'm surprised nobody mentioned [Shroud Loot System](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shroud_Loot_System) yet.
---
It addresses a lot of the flaws inherent to the classic DKP system.
---
They do not.
---
Hunter is far better for world pvp, since it has tracking. I feel mage is a bit better for BGs.
---
I am a casual player. Which is why this gold farming method appeals to me. I don’t have to spend lots of time leveling crafting skills, don’t have to compete with others in open world, I can quietly spend the little time I get to play wow making a decent amount of gold.
---
You can lol. For people who never got the opportunity to play it, it's the exact same as any other new release.
---
You do know you’re a retail player right? Or am I projecting again?
---
Lol I’m triggered and have rage? You’re taking this a little too serious. 
---
You find retail disappointing compared to classic? You haven’t even played classic.
---
This is amazing.
---
Fuck yea dude you rule lmao. I'm grabbing Ziltoid so fast on the 13th when we can make characters.
---
Ever wonder why there's this random female cow named Samantha Swifthoof wandering the main road in STV? I guess she was intended to be the Plainsrunning trainer, and they never bothered to remoove her from the game after they scrapped the ability.
---
I feel like most the changes are about additional content and speculation after Naxx.
---
Mark Kern is praised on this sub, and even he thinks Classic WoW needs to go the OSRS route.
---
I have no idea if this sub is NoChanges except for bonus content or if NoChanges means nothing after Naxx. It seems to change by the hour.
---
Thank you. So he did have to spend money. He did not get the game for feee.
---
I forgot how much I used to pull. It made zf pulls easy, aspect of the cheetah, shoot a fool, disengage, run to the area the tank is and hope to shit I remembered to remove aspect.  
---
It made the instance take longer but less wipes when someone ran away to another pack.
---
Never played it. Haven’t enjoyed a shooter in many years unfortunately - something in my brain shifted :P
---
I'd say it's a good pick tho. What would you have removed otherwise?
---
Same here. It's nice seeing the world again, but it just makes me want to play Classic that much more. I mean, all warlock specs kill everything at the same speed. Subtlety rogues can solo three mobs at once, out of stealth. Hunters pull ammo out of thin air.
---
It passes the time, though. I don't HATE it, but it's basically a single player game on the easiest difficulty.
---
I saw this mentioned a while ago and sooo many people were crying about it. 
---
Maybe there's a way they could do it. I would love it, personally.
---
My biggest issue that I run into is convincing people to pay $15/month. Like yeah they can *easily* afford it, but do they want to? Considering you can get full blown video games for the same price, a lot of people I try to convince to play WoW are pretty hesitant.
---
Really nothing to complain about
---
Minimum wage hasn't gone up in a decade, so I don't think basing this off just inflation really holds any water.
---
&gt; Comparing it to other forms of entertainment is completely disingenuous though.  You have to compare it to other video games. 
---
Why would I? It's not about video games, it's about entertainment. There are only very few games that compare in the time offered by WoW. Skyrim does, but Skyrim is considered to be THE game of games by many. Yeah, the price/time is unbeatable, apart from F2P games.
---
&gt;Riddle me this.  If classic wow is worth $15 a month, then why is it that Retail + Classic not $30 a month?
---
Because Blizzard would be competing with themselves. And most people would not be willing to pay two subscriptions. 
---
&gt;Warcraft 3 is $30.  
---
&gt;SC is $20.  
---
&gt;AOE remastered is $20.
---
And WoW has a ton more content than these 3 games. That doesn't mean you can't play them forever, especially thanks to Wc3/SC custom games. But that doesn't change the amount of money you pay per month for easily 100+ hours of content per month.
---
Are you telling me 15$ a month are much for 100+ hours? Honestly? It just feels ridiculous to me. No game has ever given me as much time as WoW.
---
I don’t agree with those who think Retail is unsalvageable at this point. I think and *hope* Classic will make Blizzard take some positive steps forward with retail. 
---
Preach said something on AllCraft I really resonated with: imagine how much better **overnight** the game would be if sharding was removed. 
---
Would it be perfect? No. But instantly you’d start to slowly get back some community feel to servers (we can already see this working in Retail with RP servers, which have lfd, lfr etc and yet still have a great community aspect to them). 
---
Blizzard will never go whole hog and remove Sharding, LFD, LFR, etc all at once (though I wish they would). And I don’t even think that would kill the game, I don’t think that many people really care for/love those systems. 
---
But I think if a huge number of us play and enjoy Classic over a long period of time (like I plan to), that definitely will send a message to Blizzard that Classic style systems have real legs and deserve a look to come to the live game.

You pull a group of mobs, You coordinate interrupts, you use psuedo interrupts or as CC, you coordinate stuns, the tank starts kiting the healer knows when to use CD's and WILL use utility abilities to make things easier.
---
You try to go faster or figure out ways to skip packs that you used to do in +10's because those packs that were kinda scary then are a monstrous wall now. You use CC to skip things or to pull two packs together while keeping the truly dangerous things out. People use their toolkits to the max, dancing blades to avoid mechanics, bubble or bop to avoid them, Ripsote to avoid debuffs, Crimson Vial during heavy damage, Blind as an emergency interrupt, defensive's at the right time because you can no longer NOT use them.
---
Mythic Plus is not all about gear. You can handle top gear to the average or even slightly above average player and they will not be able to complete a +20.
---
&gt;  i don't ever see anything negative said about classic wow on the main reddit or ingame BF
---
AHAHHAAHAHAHAHA. This is hilarious. Its all over the main subreddit, and its absolutely insufferable online on my server. And don't get me started on the main forums.
---
Unfortunately he won't be blacklisted from content either because he's just on a Level 1. Probably cackling to himself how he's being such a fucking nuisance by running with people.
---
The Horde have been a bigger problem than the Alliance now.
---
In all fairness, using the classic version of wowhead does provide the correct information.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4129/collection-plate#comments
---
Why would they act? This isn't an official event, hes allowed to be there just as they are.
---
Because of this I sincerely hope that classic WoW servers never raise level cap. I'm tired of endless vertical power creep grind.
---
What the fuck even are you? 
---
Get your crazy ass outta here lol.
---
What I would do is level mining/skinning, sell everything you get from skinning and keep everything you get from mining. Then when you hit 60 and you got most of what you need from skinning, dump it and level engineering with everything you got from mining.
---
I agree 110%.
---
Play whatever will be fun to you, but i hope you are aware paladin tanks in vanilla aren't really thing. I would save underdog specs like that for alts, and go with something more viable for your main. Rogues and mages are both excellent choices though.
---
Gold was easier to obtain in WoD/Legion than it is today. Someone returning from then could theoretically have more gold than the average player does now.
---
How about actually putting some pride into your work instead? Pumping out videos just to get the ad revenue says a lot about you.  If you actually do this for a job, you better put your back into it and produce quality content. Greedy ass content creators can suck it.
---
No wonder everyone is using adblockers. You guys are the cancer of the new media.
---
Your cousin is obviously scrub neckbeard made manifest into a chubby kid.
---
&gt; And WoW has a ton more content than these 3 games
---
No, it doesn't.
---
he legit hit the limit on retail the other day lol
---
Maybe NoMAX lmao
---
The reason I take the nochanges position is because I don't trust people to implement changes without effecting things unknowingly. I don't really think vanilla was ever perfect but that's sorta the point.
---
It's kind of a weird poll. Most classes don't spec in just one tree and some, like warlock, always spec affliction while leveling. Paladin's level ret/prot even if they're healing, priests do shadow and druids level feral.
---
is that not player harassment that he's doing?
---
Give me 5 good thought out changes, I'll wait.
---
Personal opinion the quality was never that high to begin with.
---
See you in Winterspring if you're doing it again!
---
Show me one
---
Yeah we can't have any changes.. a change being something like you know... 1.12 item stats, 1.12 talents, new graphics, rightclick report, battlenet support, layering, higher population caps, 6 patches instead of 12, and stuff.
---
This guy gets it
---
You're making this out to be way more important than it is. 10% more chance to be parried isn't going to have Druids being parry-hasted to death.
---
Best touch of this whole thing is the HD-DVD lol 10/10 would reroll again
---
Nah, this is being streamed all over twitch for tens of thousands of people and he is trying to ruin it for everyone. Get him out.
---
Bone, don't talk about yourself like that lmao
---
I made this so you pick something!
---
You do realize that this has always been a part of classic right? There have been funerals raided...did you really think a duel tournament would be offlimits?
---
Troll Master Race
---
It's griefing.
---
Slower actually, due to lower base mana regen. It's just group content so far that seems absurdly easy.
---
Hilrious lmao
---
they can save up items but its overall less effective as many are unique/run out of bank space for the guild enchanters etc.
---
#UNDERRATED COMMENT. FUCKING HYSTERICAL
---
Also, *never* let people with "compromised feelings" on said council.
---
That means if someone's playing together as a couple, neither gets on the council (or to be officers, really).   
---
That means people who are clearly crushing on someone else doesn't get to hold those positions.   
---
That means people who can't help themselves white knighting (dear lord the drama) don't get to hold those positions.
---
Vanilla PTSD up in here right now.
---
I... never said it's free. I said you can buy game time with gold. That gold can be from a year ago.
---
Everybody would know exactly what my initial comment meant. You're just trying to start an argument, I assume because you're bored.
---
I know you love spell batching and I hate to break it to you, but you’re wrong.
---
Far as I'm aware, there have been no beta key giveaways.
---
50? Thats a lot
---
Jellybeans got robbed.. was that Sodapoppin that claimed you couldn't tab target flagged alliance?
---
The return on the investment would be all the money you’re saving. Perspective is everything. 
---
The subscription itself is not an investment, but the time you invest in it is. Whether that be good or bad depends on you. 
---
There could be worse things you’re spending your time and money on.
---
Thank you that was my favorite one besides the Nickelodeon and R rating lol. HDDVD looked great beside that 8K logo
---
It doesn't really matter because for some reason it's accepted that companies don't adjust their wages according to the economy, the only people profiting from it are the shareholders and ceos whilst the majority of wow players are just normal people that probably haven't had a significant raise in years.
---
oops misread the post sorry XD
---
He's being BM, and he's annoying as fuck, but you can't honestly believe a GM should be able to revoke his beta for being a jackass like that?
---
😩
---
I've never forgotten the name Martin Falch. Such a legend.
---
Agree - beta should be a privilege
---
I value variety over pretty much anything else. I'm a textbook altaholic, so I'm drawn to any class that can fill multiple roles. Because of that hybrid classes are a natural fit for me. As far as picking which hybrid, I like the aesthetic of Knights so Paladin was perfect. Though I did seriously consider Shaman for a long time.
---
95% a pve thing, but having knowledge of downranking and some binds can situationally be very useful in pvp.  If you find yourself against low dps rot situation trying to OOM you, using your highest HPM spell is better then using a not-needed high HPS spell.
---
I'm probably just gonna block him. Every time I see him post, he just twists people's words around to start an argument. He's just a troll.
---
Half the posts here are talking about different **versions** of classic. To act like classic didn't change significantly between 1.2 and 1.12 is silly. In particular when talking about dungeon difficulty/class power.    
---
People keep on articulating bringing up these concerns only to be met with a wall of "NO CHANGES" spam. It isn't a *change* to ask for the version of classic that many people leveled, rather than the easy mode later patches that buffed the heck out of almost every class. I'm not even say I know what should be done (spoilers: I don't) but 1.12 isn't what many think of when they ask for classic back.
---
You're lucky to be playing a class like Hunter or Mage who can take advantage of the high rate farms. Not everyone plays those classes, and the hardcore players who are farming several hours per day are still going to negatively affect pricing for you, even if you can semi-compete by running Tribute on your Hunter or whatever.
---
And? Its not a Blizzard official event. Wanting Blizzard to interfere with player created events sets a dangerous precedent that I for one do not want to see fall on Classic.
---
Precisely
---
????????????????????????
---
Agreed but, concurrently, if you think Vanilla *needs* to be changed you're also delusional. It was the best game I've ever played. Is it better to encourage dev team that you don't know to tinker with it or to encourage them to just give us the known, amazing thing?
---
Yeah, that’s why I wanted to go pure dps. As a rogue back in vanilla I remember constantly having the highest dps aside from the occasional mage or a tank with Thunderfury. It’s been years though, so I don’t remember exactly how all the dps classes stack up.
---
Don’t forget about discord baby! First live action movie for the platform ? Who is your agent this shit is fire!
---
I prefer "no changes". That said, I mean such as not having guild banks. It changes the dynamic of the game fairly heavily. Changes like allowing the mailing of multiple items, and name autofill on mail, those are good and don't fundamentally alter the game. Option for new models? Hey, as long as I can toggle it off, it's fine by me. If they implemented classic exactly as vanilla, it wouldn't hurt my feelings.
---
What are you even talking about? I said I want to test classes in beta, so yeah I might waste weeks on it. Why does it even matter? Are you comparing live release to beta that wipes on 3 months? Of course I'm not wasting weeks on levelling different classes to test them when Classic releases, that's what beta is for. You know, testing stuff.
---
Hard core raiding guilds will require people to level alt-warlocks to park outside of dungeons to summon people.  If you already level a lock for this purpose, having it have professions would be quite good.
---
People did the same thing in classic.  We knew for awhile that epics would disenchant into nexus crystals so all the guilds enchanters maxed their inventories with all the epics no one wanted.
---
Pretty sure there aren't 3000 players in the Classic beta, so everyone is on the same layer. Not sure if they have the tech to create a non 3000+ layer for just him. Plus he would just re-log and get back in that layer because there is no way there are 3000 people in the beta. Last night at 7 PM, there was not a single WSG going on for Sodapoppin to do.
---
Undead get a lifesteal dot on a couple minute CD that is considered very strong in PvP. However given limited dot slots for raiding it's not useful in PvE outside of dungeons, solo play. Will of the Forsaken is pretty powerful in PvP as well, with some PvE usage.
---
Trolls get berserking, which let's them reduce their cast times and as a result both healing and damage output are increased. They get hex of weakness, which is a spammable curse that reduces damage done and healing received. It's useful for any class encounter in PvP because it reduced healing from any source (like bandages) and really can hurt dual-wield classes with the damage reduction. 
---
Troll will win in raids because they can speed up heals / dps in a pinch. They're also decent enough in PvP, but probably not as much as undead at high level play.
---
Why does it matter? Blizzard already made their stance on it and nothing will change it.
---
In vanila you bound to finding friends. It will happen organically while playing, dont worry about it too much
---
No thanks, if we go down the route of releasing BC then there will just be a group of people wanting WOTLK and then people will for some reason start asking for Cata etc and before you know it we've just repeated the same shit cycle that the game originally went in. 
---
If Classic is a massive success then they should allow you to transfer your character to a new server where they'll develop new additional content for the game in the same vein of classic.
---
They should allow us to select the layer on the server and join a queue if it's full.
---
Once we get in we are locked to that layer for 1 hour.
---
Haha idk man I was running out of things to put at the bottom of the poster. Coming to Discord Nitro!
---
Yeah I know that part but it’s always nice to power level with someone
---
&gt; No, it doesn't. 
---
I'm sorry, but neither Wc3, SC nor AoE are 1000+ hours of content (and you WILL reach 1000+ hours in WoW easily during one expansion/classic). If you count online games you could say they've endless content, but that's hardly the point.
---
&gt;New Triple A games are $60
---
That equals 4 months of WoW. I've finished tons of AAA games in a shorter amount of time. Even Skyrim can be "completed" in a way shorter time. You can replay it, but so can you create multiple characters in WoW.
---
How would they be able to tell the difference between a player who would actually sub and return to a dead account? I'm sure the selection is all done by machines so that makes no sense. They could send out 1000 beta invites and only 5 are actually people who would return.
---
Yes and no. All depends on where you live in the US. 
---
But most of the jobs these days are higher than minimum wage.
---
Hi, /u/John1225
---
I just downloaded the battlenet launcher, do I need to download WoW or will there be a different way to access it?
---
Update - 185k WoW viewers, 80 for Sodapoppin on a Sunday afternoon... what a crap beta huh? no interest at all...
---
it's doable, but remember you'll need 100g at lvl 40 and 1000g at 60
---
/s
---
Lol dude, there were no WoW beta key giveaways. The Esfand thing was a meme. There is no such thing as a meme, and Blizzard has to manually flag your account. There hasn't been a closed beta random wave in like two weeks.
---
I started a guild on blades edge for people locking xp at 60 and play arround the classic content as far as that goes for fun.
---
Anyone that is interrested can pm me.
---
Me and my brother are healer+tank combo atm for some runs etc.
---
Otherwise cya all around and/or on classic.
---
Altoholic, I love that. It took me from 2005 to 2007 to get my first main to 60 because I made so many alts, drove my friends crazy.
---
I too know the suffering
---
Can they just up the Sub to $20 and make retail a good game again? I would gladly pay the 5 more dollars.
---
Wanting to go Resto here too, just afraid of very slow progressing as a solo player. Thinking of going elemental/enhancement for a start, though got to think it over.. Restoration is fun.
---
Might be worth it just for the feel-good benefits it gives to the casters if a raid is on farm :)
---
thats cause the best part of the game is 1-20 and the designers could not manage to keep it interesting after that
---
Why exactly is slow attack speed preferable in classic?
---
It's a group of people who expect the least-altered possible recreation of the game. 
---
While I disagree that the counter-arguments are fallacious, that doesn't even matter because no argument is needed beyond my first sentence.
---
Agreed with all of that.  Loot Council is the only way to go for the most hardcore raid guilds who want to compete for world firsts, as you simply must eke out every tiny advantage for the raid that you can, but other than that it's a bad idea.  There will always be bias and it will be even worse among the raid leaders and officers who believe that they aren't being biased.  Everyone has unconscious biases that they can't do a lot about.  In hardcore guilds this won't matter because the rules will be pretty clear... main tank gets stuff first, healers second, this item is a bigger upgrade for mages than warlocks, etc and they'll stick to those rules because they want world first.  In any other guild, "this guy makes funny jokes in gchat all the time, this guy is a loser with a JOB who only plays a few hours every day" and the like will subtly influence the decisions made.  It's human nature, we form subconscious opinions of people and those opinions will impact our decision making.
---
DKP with clearly posted rules removes a lot of the "human factor" with regards to decision making and is best for most guilds IMO.
---
My mistake then, I edited my comment because I believe it still applies.
---
Hunters probably have an easier time vs mages in a 1v1, but take more nuance to pick up in terms of not getting caught deadzoned. 
---
For BGs, both are solid classes for solo and group play; you'll be satisfied with either and both are generally taken to premades.
---
For world pvp, Hunter takes the edge, I think. As a frost mage, you'll basically never lose to a rogue or warrior which is fun though. Being an undergeared frost mage and kiting a tier 2 warrior to death is an experience. 
---
For pve, mages have a bit of an easier time since more are generally taken to raids, but both are viable. Early Classic will actually be hunter's time to shine. 
---
Overall, you can't go wrong with either class. I'd recommend trying both out on retrowow and seeing what sticks.
---
Oh yeah all those people standing in the barrens are really ruining it.
---
As much as I'd love dual spec, respeccing was one of the main gold sinks used to slow down inflation. 
---
With dual spec, you'll end up with more gold but less buying power unless you do have unlimited free time, or something close to it. If you just want the convenience of two sets of hotbars there are add-ons for that.
---
Over 100 000+ viewers between streamers on twitch watching it. Yeah we should definitely not care.
---
i mean it depends on the 4g. i have 100m speed and good pings and stable so playing cs is easy, wow is supereasy. i played wow on 3g and it was super except sometimes upload fucks up and you get 20-5min breaks, but i raided with it aswell (day raids would've been impossible tho since for me usually its gets better late at night). basically it only depends if your upload is stable and even without that it may be possible to do solo content in the world. Test it out but 4g should normally be awesome.  I've also played on other shitty 1M max speed wireless networks and wow have been fine to play.
---
Yea but without the leveling journey where you learn to actually play the class, going straight to 60 gives you a false feeling for it as you stumble around not knowing what you’re doing
---
Why purposefully confuse people? Sharding and Layering are two different terms and Blizzard chose to use different terms specifically to avoid confusion.
---
Using sarcastic quotes in a poll... Talk about unbiased! You must have aced stats class!!
---
Inflation only matters if you actually get paid. ;D
---
Yea, I love the idea of classic wow, but realistically it's not going to feel the same as vanilla. Nothing will be new, everyone has millions of guides at their fingertips, etc. New content will bring back the true feeling that vanilla had
---
I know I could do it as a warrior. I did it as a warrior and people generally like my warrior tanking. I just like the versatility a Druid has.
---
Do we really use all of those every single raid? Wouldn't that take a immeasurable amount of time *just* to get consumables? Or is it easier to obtain than it looks like?
---
At least you have the correct mindset to put the Tauren in the middle where he belongs! The saddest thing for me is that I want to roll a priest and can’t play my milky boi feelsbadman
---
There have always been good games with depth out there. Maybe they're not popular, but they're there.
---
What's the easiest way to do imp packs in MC when nobody has FR gear and everyone is in blues/greens as horde?
---
I have the same thought until I started playing on private servers several years ago. And I realized, it's actually just an amazing game. Even content that I've done before, the same class even, is fun to do again with the group of people that are fun to play with.
---
People will be more ammenable to such discussion once a mostly-unchanged version of Classic is released on August 27. Until then, #nochanges. After that let's talk.
---
It depends on the community, how long and how many people will keep playing classic. If it does change retail we won’t see it untill after the next expansion after BFA, since next expansion is already planned out.
---
When I played the stress test I was so psyched about the scrolling quest text because I ended up reading all of it. 
---
I got together with some friends later that day and they asked about the stress test, and I relayed how great it was to be forced to wait for the quest text.
---
&gt; Yeah uh, you could turn that off in vanilla, you know? Definitely can now, too.
---
...oh.
---
Anyway, I kept it on and I'm going to keep it on. It's really something extra to actually read the quest and know what you're doing, and why.
---
There are certain quality-of-life things that would have absolutely no impact on this being "the best game you've ever played". One example is Guild Banks, which I believe Blizzard has every intention of adding to prevent all the account sharing that went down in Vanilla.
---
ZF was amazing.  Even more so when someone gets feared into another group of mobs.
---
First pick if you want to me mainly pvp or pve then pick a role, tank, heals or dps. Then research the play style of the options
---
It would feel like you had an heirloom 2 hander from retail but in classic. If only for a few levels.
---
If Classic ends up being a success, I can't see why they wouldn't look into it.
---
Are you stupid?
---
Tauren best race, we all know this
---
&gt;What I’m trying to get at is that the WoW subscription is 30% cheaper than it was 15 years ago
---
Yeah, it's been odd in Canada too. For a while after regional pricing was added, the CAD to USD conversion meant that Canadians were paying more than Americans for WoW as well.
---
Druid tank in classic? No.
---
People have been playing SC for decades.  WC3 still has a strong pvp community as well. 
---
The amount of hours put into wow is hardly a good argument, because you are just doing the same shit over and over.  You aren't doing unique content.
---
how do you handle the different spell ranks? when leveling just doing pve and quests should you always use the highest rank available? just wondering how to balance them all and when to be using certain ranks
---
Thanks I love it
---
Oh I will level as enhancement. But you can heal dungeons with any spec while leveling.
---
Raiding is where the Shaman shines. In my opinion the best healer in raids, even though he might not top the charts. But the totems bring so much value that any guild will be happy to bring on a good Shammy.
---
mana was way bigger a thing in TBC than it ever is in vanilla so it's not that much of a worry.
---
The numbers I've heard on dwarf gun racial is 0.4% dps gain, but I am not sure if that is accurate.  
---
Anyways at max level is almost doesn't matter, as your bis weapons are almost always bows and crossbows.  
---
Stoneform is the real reason to roll dwarf, if you pvp at all it is really really good.
---
I don’t think there should be new water in classic. The old water was fine, it’s an unnecessary change that shouldn’t be in the game. 
---
Okay? And we have more knowledge about the game in general and each and every raid. That is a consequence of a game being out for 15 years. 
---
I’m not talking about third party addons, and your point doesn’t make any sense.
---
Changes are possible (and have already happened) in terms of things like a colorblind mode being added. I wouldn't be surprised if down the road they added a player voting system for new features akin to osrs. 
---
The core game will be virtually the same though. And any voting system likely wouldn't arrive until post phase 6.
---
People are capable of realizing others are objectively retarded without being angry at them. I know emotion doesn't translate well over the internet or text in general, but anger isn't one of the ones I had while I was writing that. Once again, it's fine if you were on one of the retarded servers, I'm not blaming you or calling you personally retarded. You just didn't know any better. 
---
The reason VC started coming into existence is because people needed to kill VanCleef specifically for a quest/drop and HIS abbreviation is VC. Some people started saying that instead of the proper dungeon name. You can argue all day about what you called it, you could have called it Smelly Pirate Cave for all anyone actually cares, all we are saying is the original and most common abbreviation for it is DM and always has been. What some servers decided to change it to later isn't really relevant. We're happy for you guys randomly naming stuff as you saw fit, but it doesn't make it the correct abbreviation. 
---
If you disagree then our conversation is just at a dead end. There is nowhere for the conversation to go. I explained what happened and why you think it's that way, but if you don't believe me then there is no point in continuing to argue over something so trivial when we can't even reach a mutual resolution anyway. Especially when you think that was an actual attack against you, I really don't know what to say to that.
---
no this is beta
---
Thanks buddy :)
---
Yeah, as an outspoken asshole myself I can normally bark back at the trolls enough to spark an actual conversation, but I have no idea what this guys intentions are.
---
I think the feeling you just described is inexorably tied up in how much you personally have played MMOs in the fact that you are, that's right, burned-out. High tolerance.
---
Unless you live outside the USA. They've raised prices for other countries and regions in the past when adding regional pricing.
---
I think it's for the RPG factor mostly. If you allow any case then people can use for sentances and not names. So although you are thinking of situations like Scottish names such as McAllister, Blizz is thinking of people naming their characters IamLeetMaster and dumb stuff like that. Which no one is named IamLeetMaster in real life as that is a sentance and not a name. Enforcing normalized lowercase discourages names such as the before stated example and encourages more appropriate first names. Obviously it doesn't get rid of it and people will still do it (looking at you Xxlegolasxx) but it doesn't look great. Heck I had a paladin in TBC called Imnosuperman (I liked the show Scrubs).
---
It's also probably worth noting they seem to specifically want first names as opposed to full names like other games where you can do such things (ex: Arthur McAllister). Which would also explain why all non alphabetic characters are forbidden even though they are used in some cultures (I'm thinking of hyphenated last names such as in Hispanic cultures). I believe Kevin Jordan even mentioned this** in passing during an interview on Countdown to Classic? But I could have that source mixed up with somethjng else...
---
** "this" being encouraging single, first names for RPG reasons.
---
I believe rogues will print most of the liquid gold of the fresh economies due to BRD pickpocketing. It's just one of those things that guarantee +30g in pure pickpocket gold.
---
I think I'll go with a Dwarf Hunter. I always played Mages and I like them, but just got tired of Frostbolt...
---
Truth, but as a Canadian, I am paying $18.99/month.
---
That’s exactly who this is for. Thank you!
---
I've been doing this for years!
---
Yep, a casual guild using loot council is a very good idea if you're in a position to know you'll be in the inner circle lmao.  Otherwise, avoid.
---
Pick a faction and that will rule out one other class for you
---
Have any experience with shaman? Would you just follow the guide?
---
I had a Pokemon Colesium strategy guide that I read at school.  I didn't even own an N64 lmao.
---
That has been the case since cata. Not really a new thing.
---
Hope they say they won’t do this and that they fixed it....
---
But secretly they still allowed for pets to export the virus and thus the cycle of death continues.
---
Maybe a lot of people don't know about it.  I myself have heard of it but don't know what it entails.
---
 Riddle me this. If classic wow is worth $15 a month, then why is it that Retail + Classic not $30 a month?
---
It's preferable in every expansion before they normalized weapon speeds. Special attack abilities like Mortal Strike and Sinister Strike deal damage based on the weapons damage plus x. So you want as much top end dmg as possible. This carried over into even Cataclysm. I remember simming the 384 item level version of the mace on my arms warrior in Firelands and it was better than the 391 axe and sword because the mace had 3.8 speed and the other two were at 3.6. Even though the weapons had more DPS they weren't as good because the top end dmg was lower.
---
some of these comments... man, who knew people were so sensitive about BFA
---
I don't think the question is "could Vanilla have been better?" We all know that it could have. I think the question is "do you feel that Blizzard *would* make it better if we encouraged them to try?" 
---
With a community of people asking for their one change would Blizzard only ever make the one change you want and stop there? Or would they make a bunch of changes trying to satisfy the most outspoken groups? 
---
I know which one I believe. It's not that I don't want anything changed; it's that I don't want Blizzard changing anything.
---
Classic and retail are two separate downloads
---
They werent.
---
Blizzard has already confirmed that there won’t be any changes and if they do make changes then the true classic community will just move back to private servers with a complete replica of the retail classic client ready to rock, as long as this is known, then there will not be any changes and no amount of whiny reddit babbling will make them consider it.

GF: I know those words, but why are you putting them together?
---
BF: That is what you do when you have a baseless claim.
---
GF: How many streamers are there?
---
BF: For WoW? A few dozen?
---
GF: So that is the reason you did not get in? Because of a few dozen people that use software to show videos of the game?
---
BF: Exactly. I am so glad you understand.
---
GF: Perhaps there is another reason.
---
BF: Stop using logic. It makes me angry.
---
Raiding should be harder. Private servers have bosses at 5% parry while Classic will be at 14%. The bosses in classic might potentially have more armor and resists compared to private servers as well.
---
Haha I read that as alcoholic I was like... “okay well what does being an alcoholic have to do with classic wow?”
---
&gt;What a lot of individuals fail to consider is the scope of Classic.  It will be perpetual and everyone will be completely geared on several alts even in lower skilled guilds.
---
That's a pretty big assumption.  If classic does well we might see progression beyond Naxx and/or TBC servers that you can transfer your character to.  We might not get that stuff and you could be right but we don't know for sure.
---
This is correct, people have done the math.  If blizzard keeps to original spawn timers there is only enough black lotus for basically 1-2 guilds to full flask per day.  In fact there will be a dozens of guilds per server that are flasking their tanks, meaning only 1 guild per server can really full flask and that will come at a very high price.  
---
Private servers often had x5 to x10 the spawn rates and black lotus was still super expensive.  That is the only way people were capable of flasking every raid.  
---
Also because private servers allowed for infinite ony head turnins, it was easier to stack world buffs with those flasks and speed clear raids.  Without flasks or frequent world buffs, the average classic raid will be slower, further increasing the number of flasks required to permaflask every serious guild.
---
Big macs are 2 for 5 atm.
---
I recovered my old account, and apparently it was hacked- the Blizz rep that helped me said my two real characters had been transferred too long ago to verify who did the transfer, and that the characters were in use too recently for them to just give them back.
---
While that makes me incredibly sad, at least the characters saw play and weren't just deleted or vendored down to nothing.
---
He was on a recent Countdown to Classic episode.
---
44 warriors are starting with protection. I guess some people  will learn the hard way.
---
They're not $5 here.
---
Both solid choices. Hunter is more complex to get decent at than Mage, Mage's are pretty lean and easy to grasp initially (both have an excellent skill ceiling of course). Mage will also get you everywhere you need to go with a Frost spec until the later phases, Hunter you might want to begin with BM and respec later. 
---
Anyway, specifically for PvP they have a pretty different role when it comes to premades. WSG, anyway, the role of a Hunter is far more defensive than that of the Mage. 
---
In a premade WSG, ideally, a Hunter is keeping an eye out for the incoming enemy flag carrier (probably a Druid) and has to stay in a position where you can cover all entry points while scouting with tracking skills (humanoids, hidden). Placing traps at entry points. Slowing down the enemy flag carrier when they do get the flag and chasing after them .
---
The mage, meanwhile, is likely on the offensive. Mages make for better flag carriers themselves (during the tough enemy base part anyway), so they are likely to do that if you don't have a Druid or if you do have a Druid (which is ideal) you'll be helping them out trying to get the flag. 
---
So there's a bit of a role difference there to keep in mind. Other than that, good Hunters will have a leg up in WPvP due to Aspect of the Cheetah and longer ranges but by no means do (Frost) Mages remotely struggle in this area either. Mages deal a lot better with enemies getting the jump on you, in turn, and it's much harder to really mess up as a Mage.
---
"oh you have a lv 60?
---
well I have: one lv 43, two lv 25s, and three under lv 16."
---
Okay. Now do server costs.
---
I can't decide between a druid, mage, or hunter. I thought I was maining rogue before I found out I had 4 college classes during classic, so I'll probably play a faster leveler now.
---
OSRS?
---
The success of WoW destroyed the MMO genre.
---
The success of WoW Classic will revive it.
---
Same with this one, I was bit sceptical but decided to give it a shot and it was handled in day or so. Can't wait!
---
What classes are viable for farming low level dungeons (Deadmines, SFK, etc.) at level 60, like Wowhobbs used to do? Is it only Paladin that has the healing and tankability required?
---
Is it easy to have them merge accounts, you just put in a ticket?
---
Yeah dude...
---
I'm playing mage, sweet sweet teleport
---
Depends. A friend of mine did a lot of account sharing with his guild for them to rotate Grand Marshal / High Warlord among each other, and continued to account share into BC when a lot of them were banned for it.
---
One of his guildmates was recently able to get his account unbanned, but he wasn't.
---
I fell in love with twinks, particularly the 39/49 twinks.  I had a 39 enhancement shaman with a 4.0 second swing.  Windfury procs would 1 hit other twinks
---
Engaging in gameplay (i.e. PvP) is something entirely different, what that guy is doing is more like spamming tradechat to make it unuseable.
---
I played vanilla on priest and we got up to 4HM.  I literally flasked 1 time the entirely of vanilla, our first patchwerk kill.  Flasks cost hundreds of gold, and were almost always limited to being used on the tanks.
---
Classic is being bundled with Retail into one subscription. 
---
We could break it down even further and say, you get two games for the price of one 😂
---
Trying to figure out how many server regions there will be in Classic.
---
My question is simple:
---
* How many server regions are there in WoW Current/Retail, and what are they?
---
As far as I can figure out, there are 4 or 5 regions, but conclusive info seems a bit hard to come by.
---
I'm not, I'm stating that no matter what community Classic has, it will still be a better GAME than retail WoW is.
---
They could just disconnect him and shadowban him for like 1 hours giving him the message "connection error" ;)
---
Ziltoid, the Ignoriscient
---
It’s not a nerf. It’s shit the private servers got wrong or just decided to change.
---
Open beta purpose is to actually make changes and find bugs. The general populace won’t give a shit about that and will just want to play and then bitch when something doesn’t work. 
---
They tried opening the beta up more for panda expansion, and they got so much shit feedback compared to when it was more closed they didn’t do that again.
---
yooo Frostwolf represent, I remember you and SotH &lt;3
---
Hey everybody. I'm /u/suchanjv, I've been an alcoholic for 9 days... There's just not enough time /cry.
---
Played alliance as a kid, rogue first, paladin second, lock to finish Vanilla into TBC.
---
After wrath switched to Horde and have been since. 
---
Going back to Vanilla in the form of Classic makes me want to try Vanilla on Horde but I can't bring myself to it.
---
The alliance zones are just better and for me stormwind&gt;org and ironforge&gt;thunder bluff.
---
It's about 50/50 if I'm going Mage or prot Warrior at this point but I'll probably decide when I'm at the character select screen.
---
Guarantee they are bringing it back when ZG comes, in a way that doesn't need a rollback but just fixes itself
---
I am not CauthonLuck
---
I don't mind doing it but I refuse to pug it, so I might end up doing it once or twice but it's certainly not something that's gonna make me sub for several months. 1 month tops to play through it all, like I said.
---
Is it similar to Warlock? That was my main on a private server and I wanna be something quite different to prevent burnout.
---
If Blizzard don't change anything I know for a fact 100% sure that I will love Classic and it's the best game in the world. If they change stuff, I don't know. And that scares me.
---
Berserking isn't really useful for a healer unless you know *exactly* when you'll need to dish out some extra healing.
---
im grabbing ziltoid so fast on the 13th
---
USD is stronger compared to the CAD.
---
&gt; These players are chasing the Vanilla experience, not specific HP/dmg values.
---
Wrong.  
---
These players don't chase "The Vanilla Experience", they chase whatever misconfigured crap was standard on their PServers.
---
&gt;You sound pretty close minded
---
Not agreeing with you, is not "close minded". But please, by all means, don't let us hear from you again, that would be a great idea.
---
FWIW, the size of 1.12.1 clients (private servers) is 5.5GB.
---
the scripting system in wow classic is the same as that found in BFA
---
this scripting system is very restrictive compared to the true classic scripting system
---
Or just store them on whoever and force them to roll enchanting when aq hits. They can re-learn the old profession after disenchanting those.
---
Agreed. This is how I put it...
---
I love my morning cappuccino, it's the best thing in the world. I walk to the cafe down the street, look at all the beautiful little homes in my neighborhood, admire all the gardens and trees, feel the sun and the fresh air. I get to say hi to random people I know and run into along the way. And I get to just unwind a bit on the patio while I sip it before I start work for the day.
---
If someone just gave me that same cappuccino in bed every day when I wake up, it'd be nice for sure and sometimes it would be good to save all the time I spend walking down to the cafe...but for the most part I would lose a whole lot of the things that are so great about my morning coffee. The drink itself is only like 20% of what I actually enjoy about the drink.
---
WoW Classic is a lot like that. Sure it's nice that I effortlessly earn gold in retail, sure it's nice that within 3min of logging in I can already be grouped and inside a dungeon...but I'm missing all these other great parts of the experience. I'm not walking to the cafe anymore, I'm not admiring the neighborhood or feeling the air on my skin, I'm just in bed being fed cappuccino after cappuccino. It's not enjoyable at all at that point. Retail WoW is all about being too much of a good thing.
---
You are exactly why this subreddit is cancer lol. Can't even take anything in context and assume everything is about Classic. It's been 15 years, find something in the real world to be accomplished in because you are fucking pathetic.
---
I have no clue about server costs. Blizzard would need to comment on that. I don’t think they will though.
---
Just saying everyone who dosnt know specifics of the argument just sided with him
---
The 1.12 patch from start is huge imo. It will be a very different experience than original Vanilla. Yet very few diehard #nochanges seems opposed to it.
---
Pretty sure there will be an Alliance one eventually
---
A meme that took effort? I must be on the wrong sub
---
If you're going to compare GW2 to classic then it has to be before HoT. Vanilla WoW had a lot more content then vanilla GW2.
---
Also, why are we even comparing to GW2? It came out way after WoW. Be fair, compare it EQ, FFXI, Runescape, etc...
---
I'm sure they have extra fields in item data tables where they can track the date and only allow epics from after a certain date to d/e to nexus
---
How do you know that?
---
Neither Argus nor the 8.1 war campaign quests were time-gated on the PTR, but they were time-gated to hell once it launched.
---
At that level difference it literally doesn't matter.
---
Undead for sure
---
&gt; How do I know? You can do it on every properly scripted private server.
---
Private servers work fundamentally differently from the real servers. They run on a 100ms (IIRC) tick even without spell batching emulation, which means that they essentially have 100ms spell batching turned on even if no blizzlike batching is being emulated.
---
After Blizzard did away with the 400ms spell batching on retail, their servers have been running basically with as fast of a tickrate as they possibly can, which will typically be below 20ms.
---
What’s wrong with arena PvP? End of world pvp?
---
Never understand how 15 dollars a month is too much for basically unlimited replayability. 
---
The people bitching are exactly why we have shit free to play stuff today. Not the whole reason but a part of it. Just stop.
---
Yeah agreed. It came in what.. tbc? So it’s barely not a “classic” feature. I’d prefer it just to be hair color and style (which is how it was in tbc iirc), so your character doesn’t change “too” much... just the same amount that we as humans can change.
---
I dig the poster man. I understand your cousin.    If you would have asked me three months ago, I could’ve told you exactly the characters I was going to roll and in what order. (Human lock, NE Druid, and gnome warrior) Now I’m not sure of anything!?! Do I go shaman/priest mage/rogue, hunter is an easy choice for the first alt to 60, but do I go Orc or NE.?!? Haha they are all fun and enjoyable in my mind, that’s what makes it so difficult to decide.
---
it took me like 6 hours lol.
---
Wow, How can you Rage about an comment so hard. The Subject didn‘t Unterstand that a tauren Paladin Seems Strange for anybody who only Played in the old days, which i Pointed out.
---
Cry more.
---
&gt; Does that seem much more engaging to you?
---
Having to use four keybinds instead of one? Yes I think that's much more engaging.
---
Go tailoring on both, use both Mooncloth cooldowns to craft the Truefaith Vestments on your priest, then drop Tailoring on your priest.
---
Probably asmongold because he gets frustrated easily and isn't really that good on his own
---
its a caster, great at CC, plus ports to major cities is a huge plus lol. make a good amount of cash from it also
---
So I could pull everything in SFK from the entrance to the first boss as a squishy mage? I want to farm loot efficiently.
---
Mara corpse run is brutal.
---
I answer that exact question here.[Classic WoW: Fishing for Gold](https://youtu.be/MtPbU-Qi7rE)
---
Back then many times one looked up stuff on [thottbot.com](https://thottbot.com) . It was a site which gathered all data about quests.
---
The brew?
---
What about WPvP?
---
Who would win in a duel between a Mage and a Hunter?
---
You literally said you don’t have to spend money. He did have to spend money. 
---
I’m trying to start an argument? You replied to ME saying I was wrong.
---
Savage
---
That is literally how it works. Damage and healing is all applied at the same time. On beta right now you can go aggro 2 mobs and have them both hit you, and if they're within a certain window, the damage will be applied in 1 chunk, though the damage numbers will still show separately of course. That is literally how this all works, my dude.
---
id watch it
---
You guys should call each other and hash it out, also Loktar my guy horde all the way, orc
---
As a hunter main you should know that tranq shot would only remove a "frenzy" effect, not an enrage
---
Magmadar, 1 of the drakes in BWL, chromaggus, huhuran, and Gluth are the only bosses that tranq is used, hence my response
---
It's great watching the Horde tear themselves apart.  Meanwhile our boys in blue are fighting off Dafran from their rear, great stuff lol
---
&gt; Good specs untouched, shitty ones like Ret/Balance made to actually be viable and not meme specs. Only like 6-7 specs are being taken to 40 man raids.
---
Yeah so fuck the people who want to play classes that they played back in the day to relive their younger days because their classes aren’t “viable”.
---
&gt; Additional content after Naxx
---
You know what’s amazing is that the there are more raids bundled in with your $15 subscription, it’s called BFA.
---
The reason why you think nobody can come up with good arguments to your changes is because you just list things you want without good reasoning behind having them so you’re just blurting out popular opinions. You can’t say that people have shitty reasoning for nochanges when the changes are what gave us BFA. 
---
Maybe you should try analyzing your thoughts better bud.
---
And how did they play wod/legion? Did they use money perhaps?
---
people like you are what makes pvp great, if we ever face in premades it's gonna be fun as fuck to trashtalk or receive it lmao.
---
Awesome thank you for your reply.
---
Nah Blizz should fix most bugs and exploits.
---
It's not like vanilla where knowledge didn't spread all that fast, nowadays any little bug/exploit will be distributed to everyone on day 1, so what's the point except requiring everyone to abuse it just to stay viable.
---
I think you’re projecting. If you’re confused then maybe you need some help.
---
Doesn't really matter all that much.
---
Berserking doesn't have a whole lot of use as a healer (you'll have to know ahead of time when it'll be needed for the extra healing potential.)
---
Will of the Forsaken is good on encounters with fear, but at the same time not really because you're almost guaranteed to be in a group with Tremor Totem.
---
Troll get Hex of Weakness and UD get a life stealing DoT, both of which are mainly useful in PvP.
---
We don't have anything as crucial as the Dwarf Fear Ward. Which means you can really just go with whatever you want.
---
People have done this since Vanilla. There is always going to be some random jackass or jackasses to spoil something because they crave attention or think it's funny to be a dick. If being a dick was enough to get you revoked then basically everyone at some point this Beta would've gotten banned, streamers included lol
---
This is so well done, but it could have been graphically horrible and I would still upvote for those quotes.
---
So you want me to spend my day digging through posts and threads just to appease you? You know many new posts there are a day?
---
Weapon speeds were normalized in classic
---
 [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization)
---
4 hunter man, 4!
---
You can PayPal me 5$ a month and just never log into retail.
---
show armory or this is just shitpost
---
Right, even further off.
---
I'll use mage as an example. What do you use frost nova for? Freeze your enemies in place. This means rank 1 is best, as that effect exists at all ranks. Now look at frostbolt. Are you using the frostbolt because the enemy is running at you and you just want the slow asap? Cast rank 1 because it casts quicker. Are they already slowed and you want to do damage and refresh the slow? Cast max rank. The answer is, it depends. This is what people mean by learning your class. If you are a noob to vanilla it's gonna take you 200+ hours to hit 60, that is plenty of time to experiment for yourself. Learn the game,  don't learn what people tell you.
---
Aaaand he followed them all teh way to the new area, persistent Tauren!
---
Enhancement without SS? Are you high?
---
Very funny
---
Mental illness truly is a scourge. Tbh they should ban that retard
---
Back in the day, high end guilds used warriors to tank twin emps.
---
if you're like level 40-50, yeah.
---
Lvl 30 duels are so incredibly boring. I just don't understand how much attention this gets.
---
Is it just standard streamer exposure or can someone explain it to me? I guess there's just nothing left to do at 30.
---
Preach.  Most Hunters will only do Tinkerer, Princess and Rotgrip due to time constraints.  Pretty sure the best case scenario for drops will only net you 14g?  That's sword, 2 maces, and axe.  You would have to have that set drop every run to even hope for 80g/hr.  Literally impossible.
---
Thank you sir! You are doing gods work.
---
Might as well give streamers more privilege and give them GM powers.
---
True vanilla amirite?
---
"stole the account" lol
---
pick rogue, pure dps :) 
---
try browsing through some https://legacyplayers.com/ raids maybe to see private server stats, i tried to  search for some slowest clears and full raids and to see what kind of dps there is.  top ranks are filled with raids that kill bosses in 20 seconds while normally it takes minutes.
---
That sub would still count towards a bfa sub so not really an option. This isnt about burning money. This is about not wanting to support bfa
---
ok
---
I would reccomend skinning/herbing. Herbing mining is probably the most gold, like the other guy said. Problem is you can't track both nodes at the same time. I'm sure you will be able to find a macro to swap between the two with a button spam, but if that sounds tedious to you, go herb/skinning.
---
Dude, you are spot on. No need for the edit. People need to realize if they fully enjoyed BFA or honestly anything past WotLK (which was already starting to kill the original experience with little changes) then Classic just probably isn't there game. Have to read where I have to go, have to actually know my talents, have to do a class specific quest that actually took at least a little time just to feel like my class....yes please. People that want changes don't understand that's what they have gotten already.
---
If you're spraying corrupted blood, you're doing it wrong.
---
I don't care what side people who don't matter takes.
---
Lmao as a longtime altoholic i had to stop watching those videos, it literally took me like 3 months to finally decide I’m maining Druid lol (my fav class of all time). I just hope I don’t relapse before classic finally drops 😭
---
this is the best thing i’ve seen all day
---
"how is this tourney ruined?"
---
Proceeds to post video to get to area so more people can continue to troll
---
Youre a real piece of work
---
I’m using classic versions of the addons. Developers are creating addons specifically for classic.
---
8+ hours later and OP still hasn't shame deleted this post.
---
oof im pretty sure you are mad about streamers but they are providing entertainment for 200k people right now and publicizing the game while you bitch and whine about it here on reddit. pathetic
---
That, my friend, is a proper roast!
---
Typically alliance humans, gnomes and dwarves level in EK till 30. As one of those you can quite easily hit 30 and go split your time between arathi and stv.
---
Horde predominately levels in the barrens and has control of Stonetalin, ashenvale, 1k needles.
---
Undead who don’t come to kalimdor aside, alliance tends to own hillsbrad. At 60 before bgs tarred mill and south shore are two of the closest faction specific gys. It tend to get lit at level cap—aside from the yeti cave, that is.
---
The guys who go to desolace tend to go there in order to avoid pvp. 
---
People who go to stv are either seeking it or ambivalent to it.
---
I got beta access.
---
I got my CE on live.
---
why shouldn't I be here laughing at delusionnal classic fanatic?
---
Yes just like i said skilled players will be able to do more with less. Doesnt change the fact that everyone is able to do the maximum keystone required for the best reward at the end of the week just because they got better gear
---
lmao this is fucking great. it's amazing.
---
Pally bubble pull :p
---
This just in: you can't both have a streamed noninstanced event and have people not troll it.
---
Thats always been the true nature of vanilla, streamers are the out-of-place odd man out, not the trolls.
---
Lol this guy reads.....
---
yet on classic I spend 90% of my time wanding stuff to death and I can  literally watch a movie while grinding.
---
impatience is about the only thing that'll kill you while lvl'ing....
---
well that and some bored max-level character looking to gank lowbies.
---
Can Warlocks farm late game dungeons like Mara and DM, and is this going to be an efficient way to farm gold?
---
Weapon speed normalization is based on the AP benefit they get, which while significant, didn't completely remove the issue because like the above post stated, you want items with higher top end damage, at least if the DPS was close. All things equal, a 2.5 and 3.0 sword will do the same white DPS, but the 3.0 sword will pull ahead because of special attacks like sinister strike.
---
Same here, and I feel like it fits theme wise foe my priest or shaman that I'm starting with
---
I like everything about tbc except the introduction of daily quests
---
It's similar to DKP in that the person with the most wins the item. EP - "Effort Points" are earned by attending raids, so the more raids you attend the better. You then acquire GP - "Gear Points" by being given items, better items are worth more GP.  The prio is decided by  EP/GP. There's also an in-built decay per raid or week or however your guild wants to do it, typically around 10%, but can be customised, so hoarding isn't really effective. You can also award EP for having flasks, food, killing bosses. By far better than DKP, and more fair/transparent than loot council.
---
accept for the fact that cash prizes for in-game player-hosted events is actually against TOS, so why would blizzard enforce it?
---
All this text and yet druids were still used on the most melee intense fight, Patchwerk, during Vanilla progression. Go spend your energy elsewhere.
---
Frost mage is a completely different spec for PvE and PvP.
---
I'm definitely an altoholic. Most max levels I had in a single xpac was 20 90s in Mists of Pandaria.
---
I'm HOPING to only play an alliance warlock (idk what race yet) but we'll see how that goes.
---
New Dueling Tournament Location: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU0DibGVmW4
---
i don't get it, like dog you're on the classic sub lol. if you like BFA that's cool, but why come here and shit on people being excited for vanilla.
---
Thanks you, really appreciated input!
---
Thank you for the detailed feedback
---
Right, but isn't that the entirety of WoW up until BFA?
---
i would hesitate to use a private server database instead.
---
"havent been here in ages"
---
dont wanna say it but man
---
the feels
---
You should play horde, LOKTAR!
---
exactly why wouldn't they? they obviously like those types of tournaments bud : ) they made the rules and they can change them. they know about the tourney and probably watching it right now
---
Prot paladin is really good in dungeons. 
---
Not every spec has to excel at every part of the game.
---
no, this is being human trash
---
LOL..
---
&gt;You can make progress of sorts even in a 2 hour chunk of time. 
---
Just as importantly, the progress is relevant for much longer period of time.
---
If you don't play much in BFA, then catchup mechanics will make most of your accomplishments irrelevant.
---
No, the emergent gameplay of "Hey we're farming X wanna join?" or "I'll help you farm it if we don't have any" or even "you aren't of a sufficient rank to take any of those out of the guild bank, if you want to work on Y and Z that will help you increase your rank". There are a whole bunch of scenarios which could emerge out of a simple social interaction.
---
The point is, we got to retail by slowly cutting away these kinds of interactions until we were left with none.
---
recovered my account too. Got it back in 10 minutes.
---
mods no, but say something against classic on this forum and you'll have a herd of zealot running at you... pointing out how much harder and complex classic was, when classes can be dumbed down to 3 button...
---
or another example : people hate the M+ system, yet think they'll enjoy running BRS/strat/scholo over and over and over... why? the modern system scaling nature make sure you can alway be challenged by the dungeon, the weekly affix and seasonal affixes make sure there's some rotation / diversity in your strategy. There's factually more gameplay, challenging and strategy in modern dungeon than classic dungeon... so why wouldn't you get bored after 10-12 strat run, but get bored with modern M+?
---
I think people just see it as streamers getting to profit off a beta test for bugs and feedback while hosting a tournament with a prize of $2,000 to capture more viewers on Twitch.
---
Protip: if people have full freedom to mess up your special event, don't put a $2k prize up for it and complain when it gets trolled.
---
At this rate streamers and their fan base are going to really mess up classic, wanting special privilege for their gods in a game where everyone is supposed to be equal
---
Maybe if alliance was making any content themselves they wouldnt have to crash horde events :))
---
The only thing we have been told about the realms that I can recall are the following:
---
* There will be PvP, PvE and RP-PvE. Probably not RP-PvP.
---
* Realm names will be new, not the same as realms that were open in vanilla.
---
yes
---
I guess they sre salty that's all
---
Is it just me or does it look like the boss crit that Druid?
---
weren't they celebrating having 10k player online at the same time, cause that set a new record?
---
10k might be amazing for a private server... but it's kinda laughable compared to the real game.
---
I had some good friends in soth, was sad to see it break up but then Warfare took over and we got our server firsts. I remember cauthonluck being one of the first to 70 and farming shadow labs while the rest of us were still leveling
---
Not just that, but they get to spend way less money chasing down gold sellers and buyers, because they ARE the gold sellers now...  lol
---
Whoa
---
Hey passerbys of this thread, instead of getting baited by the OP and other trolls in here and giving them the spiteful angry post that they want from you just look at their post histories and it’ll give you a good laugh.
---
Thank you for the input, I thought there was daily/mob grinding at 60 but guess I got that wrong. Probably Rolling a priest!
---
Classic streamers are so incredibly entitled.
---
What do you know, someone who posts on NEET and Braincels is complaining about things you don’t like being not be fair.
---
Grow up, get out of your moms basement. Find a job, find a girl, clean up the piss bottles out of your room. It’ll get better.
---
Looks like that lists all the beneficial consumes available. You wouldn't necessarily use them all every time and some don't stack with others. That said you still spend a lot of time gathering consumes for raiding.
---
\&gt;events sets a dangerous precedent  
---
This is just a game, lol.
---
About 6 hours perhaps?
---
Hi, /u/Freshboyslim
---
&gt; Being a buffbot is bad design dude.
---
I understand what you mean, but some people enjoy having an "easier" class that is utility focused. Not everyone wants to play mechanically difficult classes.
---
You really should say what spec and role you intend to play for us to answer that.
---
He asked for a spec that works for both, not one that is min/maxed for both.
---
Who cares? If they wanna have a duel tournament that nobody can ruin, do it off stream and make a YouTube video of it. It's their choice to stream it and broadcast it to everyone.
---
Tournament outplayed by Trollgodx
---
I understand fx economics. OP claimed wow sub was 30% cheaper than it used to be which is just total rubbish for most places.
---
Wouldn't work on Noth.
---
Yees! a little more lmao
---
Just check out his post history bro, it’s fuckin hilarious how pathetic some of these people are with how much time they spend hating on people they’ve never met on the internet.
---
Hoooo boy what a shit show.
---
Prot paladins don't excel at any part of the game. Everything they can do, warriors can do better.
---
Attendance rewards make more sense for the average guild than the higher ups designating who should get what first. 
---
I can see why hardcore progression guilds despise DKP, but at the end of the day those guilds are very rare.
---
Thank you for this. It’s incredible. Better than the actual movie
---
How much more DPS does a mage do than a a warlock?
---
Realm transfers were a thing in Vanilla and will be in classic, however, PvE to PvP transfers were not allowed in Vanilla since that's basically cheating
---
So it's likely they won't be for classic.
---
They're pretty hot in dungeons (as far as I have researched, their AoE aggro holding is incredible)
---
But yeah, they lack a taunt and reliable constant mitigation so holding a raid boss wont happen.
---
It's just a list of every available consumable. It's up to you how much you want to tryhard it.
---
Been in 2 guilds where we had pre posted decisions and we still had corruption that killed both guilds.  
---
People with any hint of power are prone to corruption, and even over small crap like this.  To each their own, but I don't think I'll ever waste my time in a guild that gives priority over attendance rewards.
---
He posts in braincels and NEET (“not employed, in education or training” I had to look it up)
---
He’s obviously a basement dwelling jobless fuck. I really hope he takes your advice to heart
---
Didn’t read much pst the bullet points but your comment about raiding being more than just bosses and it being economical, we must remember stuff like “the beast” and his rare drop skin. This is only one example of rare materials that really had an impact on the game. Not to mention if your guild has surplus Ony skins you could sell them to other guilds.
---
This isn't a blizzard sanctioned event. Vanilla wasn't made so streamers can run events.
---
I don't care how much exposure streamers give classic - banning people for playing the game - even if they are trolling streamers - is a stupidly lame idea
---
WARTS AND ALL AMIRITE #NOCHANGES
---
Funny how the nochanges crowd suddenly gets uptight and wants GM intervention when their streamer gods can't run a tourney uninterrupted
---
Most DKP systems are based on attendance and nothing more.  If you were in a guild that based it off of how prepared you were, then said guild may as well have been using loot council.
---
I see Sodapoppin, a dude who literally makes millions of dollars a year playing video games and has thousands of fans all over the world, sitting on a hill waiting for his turn like everybody else in the game.
---
Shitty take my man try again. Next time don’t start with “pro tip” if you’re just gonna reply with that nonsense.
---
''very large population''
---
you know we can check it, right? they openly display it on their website.
---
https://www.project1999.com/
---
p99 green currently have 1149 player, p99 red have 46.
---
even by EQ standard, an agonizing 20-years old game, 1200 players is bad... and I'm not up to date on the boxing status of P99, but I'll bet that no matter what the admin policy is, a bunch of people are boxing few character at the same time... it's just too easy.
---
Plus he has the biggest audience
---
It's different watching it play out live. The ability to switch between the different perspectives live and experience it spoiler free alongside everyone else is my preferred way of viewing content these days. 
---
So I care.
---
He said what class has an optimal singular spec for both. That's definitely not mage. Would you mind mocking up for me what you think that spec would be?
---
Good on you, but you need to accept the consequences of that ability.
---
Why have one flavor of ice cream when you can have them all...?
---
I guess some people are scared of it being a malicious .pdf
---
I'm going to roll one of everything, and then play whatever suits my fancy on any given day, without any regard at all to when I get to raid level.  This time, I refuse to rush to endgame.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
They should soo act on it, getting streamed with combined of 100k people watching &gt; 1-2 spergs ruining it.
---
Your decision to not experience all the content available doesn't mean that content doesn't exist.  The simple fact is, when Classic rolls out, a WoW subscription will get you more content than it ever had at any point in the past.
---
I have a coworker with two duis, no license for over a year (2020), and he’s been driving every day.
---
We found Trollgodx boys.
---
interesting
---
I see no difference. You broke the rules and have consequences when caught.
---
Go find a warehouse, learn how to drive a forklift, ez 15/hr and they’re basically always hiring. At least I am
---
Sure, and you need to accept that me and others can dislike those consequences.
---
That is interesting. Lowering spell batching may solve the problem then.
---
But who's counting
---
There's actually a very useful addon named that...  lol
---
Not a fan of any changes, but I will say that a gold sink that disproportionately affects certain classes over others isn't a good gold sink. Hybrids will typically need to swap more than pure classes over the course of their playtime.
---
There is a difference between the stability  and balance (not perfect) that comes with patches, and the change in game mechanics that comes with xpacs. Balancing that was in Vanilla before it's end, graphics, and reporting don't change how the game plays now. Adding a quest tracker does more to change that experience than any of those. I'm sure it will be an add-on though.
---
So you might still play a hunter, then.
---
I guess vanilla isn't the game for you and Sodapoppin eh?
---
If you can't handle a duel tournament getting interrupted, either don't have a duel tourney or quit the game.
---
It's really that simple. Vanilla wasn't made for streamers.
---
You know what you can do? Do the best you can to run the tourney and stop complaining when it goes south
---
Hell, I hope it does outpace retail
---
Trollgodx is the hardest working player in this dueling tournament. He has to follow the duelers and stack on them with pixel-perfect accuracy, all while making sure he's facing the opponent and simultaneously jumping and sitting to take up maximum space. Nobody else in this tournament could do what Trollgodx does nearly as effectively or with as much flourish or grace. Trollgodx hasn't taken a break this whole time. In between duels, he is either tea-bagging the losers or hopping around between players to stay limber. Yet, after this incessant display of maximum focus and concentration, the community wants this big beautiful Tauren banned. Shame!
---
Problem with loot council is that you get way too much favouritism.
---
Goes the GMs girlfriend who can’t actually play the game, etc.
---
Then there’s the drama...
---
Again for the people in the back
---
A dui isn’t even close to being banned 10+ years ago for botting in a game.
---
Let the boy play again fuck it, if he bots again then he gets caught and banned.
---
In the gaming industry as a whole (pc, mobile, console, tiger handhelds, etc) it may be a far fetched idea that classic will divert their plans, even if the game is a commercial success.
---
But it may change the design philosophy of blizzard. Maybe they will focus more on their roots -pen and paper RPGs- and give the incredible content they visioned for their game back then. 
---
Example : a deity system, different elemental planes which coexist parallel with the world, the emerald dream (you die and you could do quests and special fights while in the ethereal plane/ or just run back to the angel for a Rez) and many more ideas they didn’t implemented.
---
Sounds like you want them to change the realm caps. That would be a disaster, #nochanges
---
How good is Ziqo man?
---
Sure. But do we need to keep expressing that dislike over and over? We get it, there's nothing you can do about it, let's move on. All of this shit is just giving trolls more attention anyway, which is what they want.
---
It's kinda crazy to me that they scheduled a completely random scuffed dueling tournament only a week in advance and still got 100k+ viewers (probably more, this is just a total of soda and tips viewers combined)
---
Seeing as how a classic account would only cost you 20$ I see no reason to unban him.
---
1. Does Seal of Command scale with attack power and melee crit since it's 70% of attack damage, or does it only use the base weapon damage or something? If the former, could you get a melee-crit weapon swing that generates a spell-crit Command proc?
---
2. Why does every guild seem to plan raids for Tuesdays and Thursdays or whatever? Does nobody plan raids nights for Fridays or the weekends? What's a person with a swing shift job supposed to do?
---
But what was broken in Vanilla is seen by many as not as bad as what's been broken since WotLK.
---
the hunter with viper sting
---
I raided Naxx on 400ms satellite internet, was one of the 28 guilds that cleared it. 4g with 70ms is fine.
---
You guys act like my opinion matters. You're all going to have a fun time with your friends when none of them want to invite you because your off meta spec makes them work harder. Everyone is lazy.
---
I just think you got offended by me saying the word disappointing and you let it go too far.
---
If they indeed removed the effect it would be sad.   I guess snowflake countries like Germany want censorship so bad it affects these things.
---
In all fairness, /u/UbiGeofram is still right that Wowhead is garbage for Classic.
---
Let's give it a couple of years first.
---
But honestly, no need for an expansion. Open up Hyjal as a new raid (replay the demise of the burning legion. Then open up caverns of time and have the chance to play old Warcraft 3 events (the culling of Stratholme, the fall of Silvermoon etc. Then open up Grim Batol and fight Dark Iron Dwarves and infernal daemons. Pow 1 more year of content.
---
I don't have the exact numbers, unfortunately. Vanilla was over a decade ago, and private servers aren't always accurate. I'm mostly going by statements other people make about comparative damage.
---
Apparently this guy
---
What are you talking about, the animal forms get dps buffed every level without having to get a new weapon.  You're never behind the curve for a few levels waiting for that next weapon upgrade.
---
that's actually one of the very rare argument that do have merit on this forum... thanks.
---
But there's also a downside to gear retaining it's value... you'll still be clearing  BWL when you have C'thun down because there's 3-4 piece in BWL that are better than AQ, and killing nef really get old after the 10th or 12th kill.
---
Heck, you'll still be killing Garr and Geddon while you're in Naxx because some of you war and rogue still need thunderfury!
---
So sure, while it might be nice to know this one piece will be BIS for 2 tiers, it also suck knowing you'll be farming old raid forever, disenchanting everything but 2 or 3 rare drop...
---
There's a similar argument amongst Cutting-edge raider on live; farm raid are boring.  Progressing on Jaina felt good. killing her after 300 wipe felt good. re-killing her 2-3 time felt nice... re-killing her for the 10th time is just annoying.
---
I didnt say its impossible, but it will make it hard
---
At least he’s Horde
---
Do you have any proof that it is against TOS? There is plenty of known inofficial tournaments around dozens of esports with cash prizes.
---
i dont know what it says about me when i thought "Yea but 50 isnt really that many"
---
I Hit that cap in TBC and have been fighting with it for years since.
---
I'm sure that taping a popsicle stick across four keys is the height of skilled gameplay. :/
---
Sounds like this guy really needs a job
---
&gt; you know who ESLE LOVES MEN? BONE. Bone FUCKING LIVES DUDES. It's crazy. I spent six HOURS on THIS.
---
LMFAO.
---
The whole concept of vanilla is the community aspect of it. This is a community sanctioned event. The response should be the shaming and “exile” of the griefer. That can’t really happen because beta means nothing and that character won’t exist in a months time. Because the community can’t take action on the user, you could make the claim that a gm should. Honestly, I don’t really care either way. I like the player having the ability to grief if they want to grief. But I can see the reason why it shouldn’t exist in the beta. Especially as a salty 13+ year player without beta access.
---
Don't listen to these knuckleheads, Bone. Ain't nothin' wrong with being an altoholic. You've already made the important decision in choosing the correct faction; everything else is gravy.
---
Stay strong, brother. I'll see you in Azeroth on my own stable of alts.
---
Lok'tar
---
Hunter - because I mained hunter, get feign death, shadowmeld, engineering, ress healer in 3h Gnomeregan run after wipe, solo dungeons, run fast, and be chill ranged in bgs.  
---
\- but wait hunters are low dps in classic!  
---
Retripala - because that was my alt in tbc and wotlk, I'll get shiny sets, and be ok in wpvp solo and duels  
---
\- but wait, retris are even lower dps in classic!  
---
Warrior - I get to guide and tank 5 man dungeons while leving, wear cool weapons, armor and be a fat dps in Alterac-Valley, and ... GET THUNDERFURY N LOOK COOL  
---
\- but wait, I have low raid tank experience, and for fury TF is not rly good, and Alliance, which I like to play doesn't get meele windfury - cause no shamans ...  
---
Warlock, I get 56448 soulstones and always summon my group to dungeons while leveling, everyone will love me and my dps is ok!  
---
\- but wait, no shiny meele weapons, and isn't mage and rogue top dps?  
---
Mage! I get to be top dps often, easy rotation and super aoe in dungeon farms/boosts plus crazy MASS DPS in Alterac-Valley! + usefull cc in hard 5mans  
---
\- ok but I don't enjoy mage pvp besides aoe in AV, never played mage a lot and want to wear shiny plate armor, and big fat meele weapons and possible legendarys!  
---
Rogue!!!!!!!!!!! big-dick-dps, THUNDERFURY!!!!!!!, stealth for fun in bgs, and all kinds of nice weapons while leveling dude!  
---
\- ok but I'm not a rogue-expert either, need windfury for ideal dps, don't like horde and again would love a tank and be ranged ...  
---
and spriest pvp is kinda cool isn't it? or - or - or 2h windfury shaman and 1hit ppl ... druids ... but boomkin no dps and I'm not a good healer ...  
---
**My experience says hunter, my head says mage, my pride says thunderfury-warr/rogue, -  BUT MY HEART SAYS ::: PALADIN**  
---
**This time** I'll really dedicade to **one class** because Vanilla-Leveling is **reallly slow**.  
---
*\*hits level 20\**  
---
"Okay time to create some alts."  
---
2022:
---
**\*Burning Crusade announced\***

"has no RL"+

"10 different half-naked 60's with no mount, no gold and only saw molten core"  
---
**\*sigh\***
---
Our guild used an auction style DKP system that worked really well. Bosses on farm had a specific value while progression bosses and time spent in progression raids also earned points. Unlike some guilds, we didn't have minimum prices for wins. It worked out pretty well and drama free for the most part.  We had basically two types of people. The ones that wanted an item first and others who were very economical with their points.  Very little drama.
---
Unlikely. Those other games are popular for a reason, and a throwback MMO is unlikely to change an entire culture. It'd have to basically pull the numbers that it pulled back when it originally released in order to change anything, and that's unlikely.
---
They definitely said they’re considering it
---
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing"
---
Sounds dope, I'll prolly send you a pm later
---
Except that in Wow-vanilla you get the normal mode difficulty... and that's it. nothing ever challenge you beyond that. even timed stratholme remains easy.
---
as we saw on beta... people have to go to ridiculous length to find something remotely challenging in the 5-man game.
---
I guess this is a positive point for people who struggle with M+10 tho...
---
Oh ya I was only saying those are my 2 fav starting zones, it’s honestly impossible for me to pick a fav zone overall personally. I use to live in panama &amp; my grandparents had a house deep in the rainforest, so I love zones like STV &amp; Feralas but at the same time I love other zones I have no connection to like winterspring, TN, or the barrens. STM is certainly up there too (: there’s just so many for me to choose, it’s so much easier to pick the few I didn’t like from classic
---
Alchemy and Herb.  Tailor and enchanting
---
Yikes indeed, dang.
---
I couldn't agree more
---
**Alternatives** to **Devilsaur** gauntlets and legs as a rogue looking to complete a pre-raid BIS list?
---
There no way I'm going to be able to pay the mafia prices while trying to save for epic mount. Farming the leather myself is out of the question unless I'm part of the mafia.
---
Thanks for reading.
---
There’s nothing you can do man. It’s not bannable. Move on.
---
Yeah it will be forced and boring if it happens again. Everyone knows what's happening and it won't cause the same sort of reactions
---
Dude omg!!! This guy is SERIOUSLY something else. Holy fuck this guy is the definition of No Life. Scroll way down to where he gets absolutely wrecked after he claims his guild will Week 1 Rag on Classic
---
Yep, Frost mages are the best at AOE. Ice shield, cone of cold and blizzard will be your go toos
---
Here in Poland my sub went from 65 PLN to 62 PLN. 
---
... So yeah it''s cheaper.
---
That’s not the purpose or point of a BETA though. I understand where you’re coming from but that’s counter productive to what the developers are requesting
---
No it doesnt. It means when the game was patched to where it was sustainable. Day 1 is a disaster for EVERY game.  You dingus.
---
Go poop on your own party somewhere. 90minute blew my fucking mind 10 years ago.
---
&gt; It's really that simple. Vanilla wasn't made for streamers.
---
Actually, it was, the whole reason Blizzard even thought about creating classic servers was because of a petition supported by millions of people started by, you guessed it, streamers.
---
The only reason we’re getting official servers is BECAUSE of streamers and them wanting to stream classic wow, and I don’t even have any loyalty to any of them and I realize that.
---
So like I said, you’ve got a shitty take my man, player grieving has been bannable since the EQ days, try again.
---
If it works exactly as it did in 2004-2006, there is no problem.
---
Human rogues are a bitch to fight on horde rogues
---
10k players on one server is a very lively player community.
---
HAHAHAHA this fucking made my day
---
Loot council son!
---
but what about you, who is apparently pushing M+ and raiding mythic mode?
---
how will you remain entertained by a raid  knowing no encounter in classic even challenge normal-mode jaina?
---
Not by spec
---
It alle depends on which version will yield more money. If there are more people subbing to classic WoW than to retail, it might even kill retail.
---
You're dead on, Mate. People are glossing over one of the biggest factors: Healers wont want to heal these people. People aren't going to want to deal with someone else that makes their job harder. Of course everyone can go "Well we can do it on an off spec night!" Duh. We can have Rogue tanks on off spec night. It's just for kicks at that point.
---
Should be, my first account was Perma banned for running a casino in IF back in Vanilla when blizzard actually cared when you robbed players. Managed to get it back in Cata i think, Even managed to get my Trading card items moved over from the banned account to my second account as i still had the physical copies of the cards with the codes.
---
Fire mage represent
---
Cheers thank for your reply
---
Cookout in the south (WV and the Carolinas) is a cheap fast food place whose food doesn't taste like dog turds and instead is a delicious treat that your body thanks you for until you've had it every day of a week.
---
No. No we aren't open to balance changes. We aren't open to any changes. Thats where #nochanges comes from. If you want new balance, ask blizzard to make an experimental server like they did with runescape. But no changes to the real game.
---
Alliance scum
---
Its about bag space
---
Yep usually the spider cave in the undead starting area has a chest in the back too.
---
compared to... the hundreds of thousand of player you have on live because all the servers can interact with eachother?
---
I feel this one. I have a main (Holy/Disc Priest), but I have 3 other Priests in various stages of leveling all on the same server. lol
---
Lok-tar, brother. I'll see you in Azeroth on my own stable of alts.
---
Unless bosses hit way harder, I can't imagine it being a huge deal. An extra 4-5 parry hasted attacks per minute won't be a big deal unless you get 3 back to back.  Even then, if healers are in top of it, it should be fine.
---
Any highlights clips?
---
It might be cheaper in Russia, not sure. But generally I think the EU has the same pricing on most stuff. No one can be bothered to set up separate systems for relatively small European countries, just bunch it up into one instead.
---
What is this zone they are currently duelling in?
---
I'm not Alliance, if you look at my history, I show you how they're the baddies.
---
Yikes. I think you’re projecting.
---
The true war crime here is Tipsout commentary. If this man attributes one more thing incorrectly to spell batching I'm going to lose my mind.
---
That’s the best way to deal with people like this, just take time to look and see how much time they’re dedicating to this and then you’ll find yourself feeling bad for them at times.
---
I think Hunter is a lot better than Mage in PvP in almost all respects except in that Mage brings poly to the table. Hunter scales better with gear, brings more utility, works better against what I expect the meta to look like again (a lot of people rolling mages, priests, and locks for raid purposes), etc. 
---
If you're just going to run around in blue gear by yourself in Alterac Valley and not really play as part of a team, you can be a Mage though. Mage doesn't scale with gear particularly well so if you gear sucks it isn't the end of the world, and you have tools like Blink and Frost Nova to survive, so you don't need Blessing of Freedom to escape a Warrior. And you're ranged and have stuff like Blizzard and Flamestrike, so you can just toss that stuff into the enemy mob and get some honor points that way.
---
Lol tar oh'behave!
---
probably going for a casual hunter/retri that just noobs around while enjoying the world of classic  
---
\- If I have fixed my life til server release   
---
Ever1 enjoy! :)
---
Also; raiding isn't everything.
---
I don't think twitch should run vanilla.
---
The beauty of WoW was that you could run it on a potato even when it was new.
---
Why don't you just list them in a text post? I could read it instantly. Instead you make people watch a video for 10 minutes
---
You are also talking about people who are good at the game and have the best items available at their current level which will never happen when classic is released.  We just enjoy different things, I enjoy hard games, I love playing games on the hardest difficulty but for the most part those are solo games.  For an MMORPG I want to socialize, relax, and have a good time with a group of people.  When I ran mythics in Legion it was just pure silence as we pulled 900 things and rushed through an instance.  The hardest part of mythic dungeons for me was trying to get myself to care about it.  Might as well been playing with NPCS.  I love Diablo, but that style is made for an action RPG, not an MMORPG which WoW is not anymore.  I hate difficulty modes, it ruins games and creates non-content elitist attitudes.  Just set the bar and either players reach it or they don't.
---
It’s not my job.  I do this for fun, why are you angry at me and not the system that made this 10 minute situation a thing?
---
As someone with over 20 level 110 or higher toons in Retail, I know this well.
---
Still haven't made a decision fully between Hunter, Mage, Priest or Warlock for Classic.
---
Vids not even 3 minutes long
---
or a rogue.
---
I know what it means, lol. But if he doesn't care, why should anyone else care? 
---
He's clearly enjoying himself. He also turned down a major brand deal recently just to be able to dedicate to Classic WoW.
---
You basically can't get past Nefarian because of the class call mechanic.
---
Definitely level as Enhance.
---
So you mean #nochange except with change? Nice.
---
?????
---
There would be no nerfs. Imagine playing a Paladin, and still getting to play Holy which is godlike, but also having the choice to play Prot or Ret and not be delegated to meme groups.
---
Not sure I comprehend how more viable options = worse, unless you're a sadist and want to relive the pain of only plating as awful Ret.
---
I went from rogue to shaman to druid to warrior back to druid and warlock.
---
Now I'm at shaman again....
---
okay so I actually went and looked it up
---
it seems that Blizzard has a "Community Tournament" licensing process: https://communitytournaments.blizzardesports.com/en-us/
---
so as long as Tips arranged for a license, it should be kosher.
---
I am going to play the same class I always played - mage! Easy choice. But will also play alts - warlock and priest and possibly a warrior tank
---
You're really going to claim your post isn't meant to dissuade feral tanking?
---
If you were really going for an honest treatise you'd acknowledge all the other factors you intentionally ignored.
---
Druid tanks are going to be fine, at the very least for MC/BWL/AQ. Why? Because vanilla content is easy and most aren't going to join a server first guild
---
It'll be a short fight.
---
i cant imagine creating another character of a class i already maxed wtf its just the same thing again?
---
No they didn't. Blizzard said they will consider additional content post-Naxx and are considering BC + WOTLK as well.
---
To add to your point about resources: you can't have an economy without demand. It's as simple as that.
---
The challenge of questing in classic directly contributes to that demand. You WANT gear upgrades to make content easier. You WANT to craft things for yourself to help make content easier. Engineering, for example, in classic is not fully supplied by mining. There are materials that are provided by other professions.
---
I was playing BFA the other day on my warlock, and did an underwater quest. I got a buff with underwater breathing and swim speed.... why? There was a perfect opportunity for them to create at least some market demand for water breathing potions, diving helmets, or swim speed potions. Even just the desire to seek out a warlock for the buff. But no, they opt to just let people go through the motions. 
---
They even increased how long you can hold your breath baseline making the undead racial, and the new kul'tiran racial not even worth looking at. They even gave allied races profession racials which are basically useless in the current design of the game. 
---
They are so fucking out of touch with how to design an MMO it's not even funny.
---
Mage 4 life
---
I thought Phase 1 included MC?
---
Oh okey, then i guess thats settled.
---
My shitty Dell desktop from 2002 ran it like shit in 2005. I never saw more than 12fps outside of dungeons and buildings. 
---
Finally upgrades to 1GB of RAM and it was glorious
---
TY. 
---
Maybe just make another entry in the drop down list for "Moonglade (Druid only)" ?
---
I see your reading comprehension also struggles severely, if people want to play Ret or Balance because that’s what they played back in the day then they should be able to do that.
---
You claimed nobody has any good arguments and you didn’t even read my comment correctly, cmon man.
---
Yeah sure, but banks exist and you can just push the epics to whomever still has space. Sure its not unlimites, but its still alot of nexus crystals
---
rogue/mage for top dps early  
---
lock/horde fury for later  
---
but just play what you enjoy playing, I found it more rewarding than being 1. dps in raid, but not rly enjoying the class I play thousands of hours on lel
---
i see everyone flaming dafran for wrecking all the alliance but what did this tauren do lol ?
---
Playing WoW is relatively easy on data usage because you're just sending small packets of data over and latency (at least for me when I've done it) is decent - 80-150ms range.
---
Would we be able to use them on classic server?!
---
You can't really just go about changing 1 class because of previous patches and not touch the others..
---
The question is not whether you can do it but what you can do for your team if you did. Do you bring any special buffs that your team could use that are only accessible because you went into that spec? Things like make up for not being the objectively best tank at tanking itself.
---
Exactly lol. If it were the live servers i could understand the griefing. Its pretty much a private beta though and still have these mouth breathers running around thinking its funny. I guess if you are apart of the soda aids what do you honestly expect.
---
The price of McDonalds varies from country to country though. McDonalds is pretty expensive compared to most other places where im from.
---
there is a problem
---
I love how the only thing you've done on Reddit was to tell me I need a job. I'm dying
---
Ok, still don't see it coming back
---
"remoove"
---
haha
---
How does one kill that which has no life?
---
YEEESSSHHH 
---
Pretty epic stuff for a 40 something in vanilla.
---
&gt;Care to try again? I have no clue what you're trying to say. 
---
My bad, I shouldn't have expected you to understand the point using your own phrasing.  My point is, you're going to be getting more content than at any other time in the game's history for the same price it's always been, and if you choose not to experience most of it, the company is under no obligation to refund the unused portion.
---
&gt;  I have no interest in playing or paying for the current xpac, 
---
Irrelevant.  Games, along with most products in existence, aren't cafeteria offerings where you order bits and pieces a la carte and pay accordingly.  You can't demand to buy a Corvette at half price because you have no intention of using all its horsepower.  You aren't going to get a cheeseburger for half price by promising only to eat half.  If you buy the latest Call of Battlefield: Gears of Warfare and only play for four hours before shelving it,  you're not getting a partial refund.
---
&gt; so they might as well include every single Blizzard game, charge $100/month and call it a great deal.
---
That's just an absurd argument that doesn't address the topic at hand, but it does make you look like an idiot who's run out of arguments.
---
The real game had regular patches.
---
I'd go for a lock just named Townsend for the sake of confusion. 
---
Those that know, know.
---
The problem with most of the expansions is trying to redesign systems every single time. 
---
And making so much content pointless.
---
Zygor has plans to release an addon for Classic...
---
Yeah I hope they give an option in the settings for blood!
---
But its a orc mage! not the same as troll mage! The racials!
---
"3 weeks andhe is still running RFC"  
---
Dude, I've done a million deadmines, gnomeregan, SM, Zul'Farrak runs and know everyone NPC in Karazhan by it's first- and-lastname, geared up over 20 chars on pservers and retail to full T4 but never did classic NAXX or BT a lot xDDD  
---
buying 10+ epic mounts can also be a pain.
---
Dammit I feel so attacked
---
Considering additional content and balancing old classes to make them viable are two completely different instances of changes, and BC WOTLK servers would be on completely different servers, your straw-mans arent gonna bait me into more replies unless you actually have a good response so have a good day bud.
---
what?
---
Honestly, wouldn't the natural progression of Classic be modders with unique servers?
---
At least you'll miss the layering shitshow.
---
Meant to reply to the guy who said he thought he remembered it. My B
---
Prolly switched races or factions. Iv also heard of people leveling two of the same thing back in the day because of respecs and other reasons.
---
Dirty horde
---
It's not like those people can join your guild though. You probably won't ever run into them out in the world again. You have access to this huge player pool but it's totally useless because once the dungeon or quest is done the purpose is served and people just go their separate ways into another shard never to cross paths again.
---
People want Classic content!
---
Megathreads are pretty much always that. Reddit just isn't good for that kind of discourse. Following the comments in them is a massive pain and virtually no one actually does it. When discussion gets forced into a megathread, it's basically over.
---
And you are asking for patches that the regular game didnt get. No changes
---
So does bone!
---
You can’t buy tokens in classic. Only bfa. If you want to pay your sub in tokens you need to buy a token on bfa.
---
Likely
---
so much gold...
---
Twitch shouldn't get to dictate what happens in vanilla, I think it's pretty simple.
---
We also shouldn't give streamers massive favoritism.
---
Is even vanilla without it?
---
It's not a change.  Warriors received insane buffs right at the end of classic.   It's simply removing the buffs, until Naxx.   If they're in from day one, then it will completely change Classic.
---
Consider that the ultra hardcore guilds can only get their 25 warrior lineup by scalping geared warriors off other guilds with a more balanced roster.
---
Meaninging they aren't actually earning all their achievements, guilds that earn all of their achievements (gear up their own players) have balanced rosters because that's just how loot works in MC/BWL
---
I was more looking for an explanation of how Agility and Strength come in to things. Sorry if my wording was confusing.
---
Sweet, thank you
---
Okay so it's more or less DKP just with different accrual triggers and a built in anti-hoarding measure.  I like that.  It does sound better than DKP, hoarding is the main downside of DKP so having something built in to deal with that is great.
---
Mafia won't be a thing like private servers. It requires some form of cross faction collusion. If Blizzard catches wind of such a thing, they will ban them. So the mafia is entirely reliant on Blizzard not enforcing or catching players breaking TOS.
---
Neither, it's to prevent 30 people from commenting the same thing. It's a nod that I know most people here won't feel like I do.
---
It's not like the usual unpopular opinion on reddit where everyone agrees.
---
Career priest myself. Once you get that lvl30 threshold. Finding myself a spot either questing, or 5man instance runs is basically a blank check. Makes for even quicker movement once I find a solid handful of good tanks and dps that I can have on the friends list.
---
I would like to subscribe to your system of freedom units.
---
Warrior is like one of the most popular classes and enjoyed in the form we've all gotten to know them for years and years now. We're looking for a good and fun version of what wow used to be. Gutting one of the most popular classes in vanilla makes no sense for anything. It's never happening couse of the popularity of the class and because most people actually aren't wanting to be pinpoint accurate to the detriment of the game and it's popularity.
---
I can fast pull DM North, PvP, relax and level a new character, run ZG...there's lots of ways to do challenging stuff. And jf I'm 100% honest with myself, a big reason I do M+ and Mythic raiding is because it's just simply what you do to min/max. That's an itch I have to scratch. I really wouldn't mind a more relaxing min/max meta in Classic, I'd welcome it actually.
---
Rejoice!
---
Ignorance is bliss
---
No thanks. We managed back in the day, we will manage again
---
In theory, I'd be all for a frankenpatch of some sort, but 1.12 means 1.12.
---
And so did many other classes. Paladins for example got completely reworked in AQ and it heavily influences paladin healing. Shamans didn't get threat totem before patch 1.8 or something etc. 
---
Yes using 1.12 talents is a complete massive change to vanilla. But the decision was made to go 1.12 talents because it's easier and spec are properly developed.
---
The mana pool is enough even if you are Enhancement? I mean healing in dungeons. Oof, many things I dont remember it seems.
---
I mean talk about hand holding... to each their own i suppose.
---
Tuesday and Thursday is literally the best time for a 9-5 person with kids and a family to raid. Weekends are usually full of birthday parties, soccer games, or random stop ins from the in laws. Tuesday after work while the kids are doing homework then going to bed? Done deal guys
---
You can contribute to a beta without knowing every nook and cranny of the game. Most people on the beta are simply playing anyway, but they are still contributing by playing, by running dungeons, grouping up, testing layering etc. I may not have played vanilla but I am still very familiar with all the old systems and would know in most cases if something was a bug. I don't deserve beta any more than anyone else, and I don't expect to get in at all at this point, but the idea that only vanilla veterans can beta test is just wrong imo. There's plenty of ways for people to contribute.
---
Wut what have we germans done? You can play games of any gore level here.

omg and a lvl 19 dwarf hunter to mock on all those rogues!

I've been at 50 for a long time now, but the majority of them are lvl 1s who are just reserving potential names.

why are you making a post on something thats been asked over 1000 times? stop beating the horse, its been dead for months
---
One can kill people.   Boy you need to relax.
---
appreciated! you made my evening.
---
Look, it’s not my fault your memory is bad and you can’t recall seeing them. Maybe do the digging on your own, I don’t feel like wasting an hour digging through old threads and forums.
---
&gt; I remember there was a dude offering to pay for anyone who couldn't afford the sub on this forum. I suppose he's rich af. Not sure how to find that post.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/boxkq6/for_those_who_cannot_help_themselves_afford/
---
PvP gear is equivalent to Tier 2 raiding (BWL). But it is not easy to get. You need to commit to a 10 hour grind every day for 5-6 months with no breaks, due to how honor degradation works.
---
That’s not the point. The point is all actions have consequences. He got banned. The end.
---
Because it's not the same and not really comparable, I didn't play vanilla (started in wotlk) but there is a huge different in feeling and immersion and the grind to me simply doesn't feel the same. (Note that I only have played on private servers)
---
Just make friends on your server! It’ll be easy!
---
if you want balance changes then go play bfa or a different game. let classic be what its supposed to be, a historical recreation of vanilla
---
You probably won’t be able to get high enough ranks to get the PVP gear that surpasses raid gear without getting raid gear first in order to even join premades for honor farming.
---
Even though this sounds tedious, it gives you more things to do, and its an overall good thing.
---
Joana is also updating his leveling guide
---
Max rank heals just do so much. They might be the most health per Mana, but even a dps specced hybrids big heals are fucking big. You're gonna be overhealing a lot using max rank.
---
Not initially. 
---
I’d be fine with it if they used gear to change the balance in new content after phase 6. That way, the vanilla experience continues to exist for new players, but vets who are running AQ / Naxx regularly have a new meta to enjoy. It would impact PVP a little to have more viable DPS classes, but 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Hunter NE male all the way!  
---
shadowmeld and get mocked for being a huntard :)
---
&gt; It's a small change
---
vs.
---
&gt;If you are truly #NoChanges
---
The sweet, sweet smell of hypocrisy...
---
Well, Classic WoWHead shouldn't be.
---
Yes and no.  No pet, more reliant on cast times, more reliable CC without pulling nearby mobs, but the CC breaks on damage.  If your play style was more affliction and demonology, it won’t be similar.  If it was more destro, it will feel more similar.  Still cloth, so still some survivability issues.  
---
On beta, leveling a mage is a bit slower through 30, and it feels a bit choppy running oom all the time.  Warlock leveling is slightly faster, but much more smoothly paced in my experience.  We will see how that changes 30-60.
---
Cool, Ty friends 😃
---
Reading all the old guildnames from my first realm gave me such a flashback. Thanks man, much appreciated
---
Played ud mage in vanilla sure af gonna play it now, oh and making a portal to uc after a guild run is gold, stacking portals ontop each other is the best
---
You’re comparing apples to oranges.  You sound like a fun person.
---
Nah mah boi, we germans stepped our game up. You can even purchase Mortal Kombat 11 in its complete gory glory in stores and on steam.
---
How you think bone feels?
---
I know this mans pain
---
i'm gonna resub whenclassic comes out, def gonna check out my old characters... thou I do recall one time they got hacked and so much shit got destroyed and or traded even my epic mounts got deleted and they couldn't recover them for whatever reason.
---
that was when i officially quit because on my main shaman i had the Zul'Aman epic warbear and that got deleted.  I said fuck it and never played again.  this was during wrath. But since this is classic and fresh i'm giving it a go
---
If you think this is bad, you wont last 5 minutes in classic.
---
There’s already a lost if addons that work in classic. Questie is one of them.
---
It's something I too have thought about a lot since the launch of TBC. 
---
One idea I sometimes come back to is the idea of soft seasons. Unlike other games where seasons/ladders have a set end and a new one starts over from scratch, the idea would be that content would be on rotation constantly, and you might never have access to *all* content at the same time. 
---
It would be similar to how WoW already handles its seasonal events, except over a *much* longer period of time. 
---
Let's say Classic launches. Instead of taking just over 2 years to roll out the entirety of the content, it instead only takes about 1. 
---
At that point, a reworked TBC launches (no flying, retuned as 1-60 content, etc), and AQ/Naxx are closed. The Caverns of Time dungeon levels are: 39-48 (Durnholde) &amp; 51-58 (Black Morass). As many players are already going to be lvl 60, all TBC content is open from the start (still got to get attuned though :P). 
---
After about 260 days, a reworked WotLK releases (no flying, retuned to 1-60, no Naxx, etc). Black Temple, &amp; Sunwell close. The Caverns of Time Culling of Stratholm dungeon is lvl 58-60. Ruby Sanctum is an Onyxia/Gruuls tier raid. Trial of the Crusader is an entry-tier raid too. Once again, all content is open from the start (still attunements though), and the duration is around 260 days. 
---
At that point Ulduar &amp; Icecrown Citadel close. 
---
Subsequent seasons will consist of half-regular/half-random top end raid teirs on rotation - switching up every 3-4 months. Rotation 1 would have AQ &amp; Naxx, plus 2 other random raids from TBC or WotLK. Rotation 2 would have Black Temple &amp; Sunwell, plus 2 other random raids from classic or WotLK. The final rotation would be Ulduar &amp; ICC, plus 2 other random raids from classic or TBC. 
---
As part of these seasons, new levelling dungeons &amp; quests can be sprinkled in, and any new top tier raids can be introduced in place of one of the normally random raids. 
---
Events associated with certain raids will occur each time a raid re-appears, but you wouldn't be able to get a black battle tank every time AQ rolls around (perhaps there could be other cool rewards but nothing as prestigious as the mount). 
---
The itemization would be such that TBC/WotLK content (and any other new content) would not tread on the toes of classic gear too much so that any sideways powercreep is minimal, but also serve to prop up certain specs. Items/item sets might also change the way you need to play. Elemental resistance requirements would move back into a more prominent role. Certain items could be balanced so that they only provide a power increase beyond previous items within a particular raid. There are many ways to itemize without impacting on previous content difficulty, while still providing gains within other specific settings.
---
I play retail. It’s a huge disappointment and my standards aren’t even that high.
---
\&gt;Snowflake Countries like Germany
---
\&gt;ESRB founded in the US because of Mortal Kombat
---
Stopped reading at "hunter scales better with gear"...
---
Those other class changes don't matter anywhere near as much as warriors.  No one hardly ever even used the tranquil totem.  Giving WF to the melee took priority.
---
 Warriors dictate the flow of the entire game, because they're the tanks.  Raiding will be completely different from Vanilla, if the warriors are left in a brokenly OP state.
---
So the beta means nothing but you want GMs to use their power to protect streamers because they are trying to run an event on a beta that means nothing.
---
Got it. Really, really dumb logic. The dueling tourney doesn't matter, I agree, that's precisely why Blizz shouldn't go banning people.
---
Streamers events will be interrupted even if you try to ostracized them from the community at 60. Doesn't mean GMs should go around banning
---
The wrath launch event was like a lite version of it I think.   You could be a zombie and infect players and NPCs alike. I remember rolling with a few people starting in the barrens and spreading the infection south all the way to tanaris.  I wish they bring that back for like Halloween or something.
---
When you phrase is that way “Me finding out what class I want to play is just an added bonus”. Yes, I whole heartily agree that’s how it should be viewed. Most view it as simply a playing experience, and while, yes, it is a game, BETA testers should be playing the game with more of a critical eye to help further polish the finished product. I’ve had an active account since July of 2005 and I have no confidence in a BETA invite. So I’m in the same club as you and so many others. BETA invites are basically worse odds than a lottery.
---
Well I did mushrooms and jumped out a window, so there’s that. I’m comparing laws and breaking them, knowing and accepting punishment. Not two fruits of different families. 
---
You can’t graft and Apple onto an orange tree without some serious effort. You might want to look more into your botany if you want to use it as a point.
---
the classic servers are a fresh start for everyone, it's pretty much like day 1 WoW starting from lvl 1
---
Yes, energy recharge is the same but sinister strike is an instant, weapon damage + x so a slower weapon hits harder at the same rate a quicker weapon would
---
While that does give me hope. I still question if I will be able to get the leather myself or in a small group if the spawns are camped.
---
So, are there decent alternatives in those two slots for preraid-BIS?
---
why?
---
&gt;Hypothetically, would you be open to balance only changes?
---
Hypothetically, would you, and the people like you, be open to stop wasting everyones time by opening one "but but but its only one smaaaaall change!!!" threads all over this /r?
---
It's getting annoying.
---
To clarify:
---
### No, we are not open to any content changes
---
### No we are not open to any "balance patches"
---
### No we are not open to a partial revert of 1.12.1 for this class or another
---
### No we are not open for any "its just a small change"
---
Doubt the BWL part really 
---
Chromaggus alone depending on the week would be hell on the healers
---
It’s funny because this is genuinely the one change I agree with since progressive itemization is technically a change too but the biggest streamers are Warrior players and a majority of the population in this subreddit are fans of them and probably play warriors themselves so getting the community to agree on nerfing them is definitely not gonna happen haha.
---
Thank you for actually having a well thought out post though OP it’s rare to find on here nowadays.
---
&gt;I'll join if/when they drop the price (as they do with the xpacs).
---
They've never dropped the price of subscriptions.
---
It's a small change from just a hard line 1.12 state, which is itself a massive change.
---
Play warrior.  Top DPS and best tank, both of what you wanted to do.  Obviously there are tremendous downsides but yeah, thats the price of greatness.
---
That's my plan for the most part well I will be able to raid I will most likely spend time just enjoying the experience all over again... Getting to 60 with one toon from each faction
---
Alliance, but maybe horde.
---
Yeah in classic a Tauren follows every single player around and obstructs their view
---
And reading guides is better? Lol
---
lol the debuff on mindflay is just the slow so isnt needed and just gets knocked off from having lowest priority, then shadow word of pain you actually want on 16 debuff slot cause its one of the best next-in-line debuffs to use, then there is vampiric touch that is purerly defensive/healing and so isnt needed and think thats about it - so while there is like 3 debuffs on spriest, if you know what you're talking about you know there is really only one that needs be used and is actually a good choice to do so.
---
 "Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions. " , take from blizzard's [code of conduct](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/42673) ,same rule in blizzard EULA.
---
Yes Blizz can ban this guy , obviously.
---
IIRC, in classic they are planning on raising debuffs to 64, so at least that part won't be as difficult.
---
That is unfortunate. I wish acquiring PVP gear was more about skill (like needing 2050 &amp; 2200 arena rating for weapons &amp; shoulders respectively) rather than just straight grinding 10 hours a day for 6 months. However, this is Classic, so gotta accept the #nochanges.
---
Your comparison is griefing  a streamer on launch of the game to griefing a community event on the BETA server. You can see the difference right? 
---
Being on the beta is a  privilege not a right. More so than playing the game on releasing after paying for access. So yeah it's pretty reasonable to believe a GM should be able to revoke his beta access.
---
Make good connections and never act irreplaceable, you can get by with r11-13 gear until BWL, but once AQ launches you NEED to raid AQ to stay competitive.
---
Mechanos are probably the coolest mounts after night elves IMO
---
15 bucks a month for the best MMO on the market seem like a good deal to me. None of its competitors looks enticing to most people visting this subreddit.
---
There's a reason why people are clamoring for Vanilla WoW instead of the Vanilla Everquest experience.
---
Found the guy that need rolls everything just to troll and says “welcome to classic”
---
Call me vain, but good + fun.
---
Coincidentally, I usually find the top tier in every game the most fun, WoW included. You have more options, you are more effective. 
---
I'm maining Mage and alting a Warrior.
---
yea I feel like most people will take these two if they want to go hard.
---
you won't make any real money with it and be poor for a very long time though.
---
Totemtwisting btw..
---
I disagree, I don't think streamers are the one and only reason we're getting classic. I think it's from really hardworking and passionate old timers at Blizzard and the community ad a whole who are responsible.
---
Even if you want all the credit to go to streamers, that's still not an argument for banning trolls in a fucking lvl 30 beta duel tournament.
---
This isn't grieving, it's standard vanilla play. Funny how the community is generally for #nochanges, EXCEPT when they think streamers need special GM attention whenever they want to hold an event.
---
Ridiculous.
---
I picked the game up in cata, made a troll mage, and played mage ever since. So its an easy decision for classic
---
Classic balance and vanilla balance will be very different. Itemization changes makes older raid somewhat trivial and not the experience that the "regular game" provided. I do not remember raid with 10-12 warriors. At the end of vanilla there were big population problem that leaded to the introduction of the blood elf. Classic will be the private server experience not the vanilla experience.
---
Lol I only just noticed my typo
---
Not for classic no. Before classic there was plenty but people won't play on shady shit servers doing classic.
---
So I'm guessing your in beta and choosing not to go huh?
---
The vast majority is bop. So no, you cant
---
Rogues and mages will be raking it in
---
Of all the things that are nochanges, these need to be top on the potential reconsider list
---
Hunter does scale better with gear what are you smoking my dude? Spell damage barely existed in vanilla WoW, especially on blue gear, and even tier 1 gear barely had spell damage. There are trinkets like the Zandalari Trinket that can be retarded with PoM Pyro but that's a gimmick more than anything else - sustained damage in actual group vs group PvP is more important than one big burst of damage. You have to really start getting up there to get more spell damage, and honestly it isn't even that much. The big thing for Mages, IIRC, was that better gear meant more gas for a drawn-out raid boss.
---
No, the Instant +2k Heal is more valuable. 
---
Stormstrike costs a shitton of Mana and has a long ass CD ontop.
---
Ooh i thought you meant no Classic on twitch at all
---
As a part of everyone. I play hunter and druid. Op, OP, very OP. I don't touch warriors, lol.
---
Which honestly would be fine, if the salaries increased just as much. But that's never gonna happen...
---
That wasnt the answer i ve been looking to :) İ guess my only option is wait for original release and pay for it. Thanks.
---
Why would they? Its not against the rules to ruin someones time in vanilla, its part of the game. If someone breaks rules, sure ban them. But nothing against the rules of jumping around a duel
---
Holy = Buff, cleanse and flash of ligth. Retri = atoatack.
---
I dont know what that guys problem is! I actually would like to see people bringing up EQ progression servers when discussing legacy servers (sorta like how folks talk about OSRS). It is another example but handled differently. I believe a few things contribute to the predicted outcomes of their respective servers. When an EQ progression server comes out its populated well enough. This population drops after a month or two. If anyone reading this has played Path of Exile leagues it is a similar trend. Think of a three month block. First month has a good population. Second month sees a population decline. Third month has low numbers until the end as people wait for the next expansion to drop. I can see a similar situation occurring for Classic WoW for each phase. How much the population will fluctuate is hard to gauge. I dont personally believe it will nose dive to very low levels or anything like that. EQ Prog tried different release lengths for some servers. In their case, longer times between releases ended with a below average population server. There are multiple potential reasons for this but I dont want to make this long post too long. I'd love to discuss this more if there is an interest.
---
where do i download classic?  i have the battlenet launcher with all the blizzard games, but don't know where to get the classic download.  do i have to wait till august 27th to do it if i don't have a beta key?
---
just report this post
---
1 ally max, 1 ally twink. 1 horde max, 1 horde twink. +maybe other twinks (19,29,39,60,70 twinks are all common). That could all be for just 1 class too.
---
Waste of mana
---
Also the rogues can't see their opponent's casting so they can't kick the right spells (which is why all the rogues are getting eliminated).
---
This is why I PvP. It never gets old or boring, while PvE frequently does get boring. But I would rather know that my T2 piece will have a lifespan longer than 4 months than know that killing Jaina is meaningless because 8.2 is about to come out and the gear she drops will be useless. They need to balance retail around set bonuses and quirks rather than ilevel. I would be okay if first-patch epics remain BiS throughout the lifespan of the expansion as long as new content/raids adds new variety to the effects that gear brings.
---
You’re so stupid
---
Who actually cares
---
Hi, /u/Aerospine79
---
Shame on them for not using an addon.
---
Basically during every duel the horde are having th etauren 'trollgod' is just wandering on top of both players obstructing view etc
---
I don't see how clearing a tier in 2 1/2 months is too easy?
---
Tips was really solid the first round of fights but he has absolutely gone full retard since.
---
Yeah
---
TBC server instead of content past Naxx please
---
Skinning/mining whilst levelling.

Engineering &amp; ...
---
At 60.
---
Clearly you are super wise about vanilla lmao
---
There will be an aweful lot of frost mages. Better roll warlock or hunter.
---
I have forgotten more about shaman in Vanilla than you will ever know.
---
We'll see. Private servers may have buffed the bosses in other ways. Pulling from an old thread about Nost:
---
&gt; Nost content difficulty was tuned towards retail values. However to compensate, gear/other items were patched onwards from Patch 1.4. Limiting itemization/enchant/buff options for tanks, DPS, and healers, allowing for a more identical experience to original Vanilla. Bosses like Broodlord, Chromaggus and Nefarian had the capability of killing your Main Tank within 1-2 seconds due to unusual damage output, seemingly **stealthily buffed**. Making it a fair challenge in progression with un-defcapped tanks. Invis pots to skip trash was not possible due to dragonkins detecting stealth.
---
Lmao go do some island explorations man
---
inb4 deleted post.
---
I don’t think you quite understood my post champ.
---
How stupid do you have to be to justify the actions with false hyperboles?
---
Oh no the streamers had their plans ruined lets ban peopple so the streamers are happy... uhhh no fuck off thats stupid if you want to broadcast your game play this is what happens stop catering to the cry baby streamers
---
Someone below linked it https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/boxkq6/for_those_who_cannot_help_themselves_afford/
---
&gt; I disagree, I don't think streamers are the one and only reason we're getting classic. I think it's from really hardworking and passionate old timers at Blizzard and the community ad a whole who are responsible.
---
Hey man, you can disagree and think whatever you want, but the hardworking and passionate old timers at Blizzard have moved on and the ones that are passionate about the game (Omar) probably wouldn’t have had the voice they’ve had at the company if there wasn’t such a big push from streamers and Ion has stated that multiple times in interviews.
---
You seem pretty opinionated on a community that tides itself on wholesomeness and meaningful player interactions that you’d defend someone whose trolling something that is vital to the exposure of the game from the perspective of the hundreds of thousands of people watching this tournament. 
---
Also, like I said, this is not “Vanilla play” this is toxicity and like I said before, defending behavior like this is a shitty take so instead of defending this dude due to whatever problem you have with streamers is straight up idiotic and it makes whatever opinions you have lose all credibility.
---
I don’t use guides.
---
No it shouldn't it should be for testing the game, not something bestowed upon the lucky few. If this guys a good tester in general then who cares about what he does on a twitch event.
---
Go tailoring on both in anticipation of bloodvine.
---
i just answered this in a thread just above this one, go back to this page and look up one or two.
---
TL:DR spriest only needs one debuff slot for sw:p and its worth
---
This reeks of bs.
---
This made my day. I know all too well what the alt lyfe is like.
---
Probs China.
---
Part III was so Great, gonna watch it the coming days!
---
I remember a human female warlock with a bunch of pvp videos back in the day. I can’t remember the name though. Wish I could.
---
thank you!
---
You clearly do not know what that word means.
---
And you are not worth anyone's time.
---
Sounds like someone got rekt in pvp by warriors. :P
---
The gap between 1.12 and the final 'phase' of vanilla leading in vanilla was quite large.  
---
Am I misunderstanding something... or are you referring to the pre patch that happened a couple months leading up to BC?
---
Maybe that explains why you now know nothing.
---
Not to mention that sweet 17,4 fps! :D
---
Orc &amp; troll are better yes, but play what you like to.
---
Nothing worse than hating your character.
---
1.12 is not the prepatch no.
---
I genuinely and truly hope TrollGodX gets cancer.
---
For people like me who've never experienced it (I played from TBC to Cata), I would love to see what it was like. That's just me personally, though
---
1.13 is essentially going to be a franenpatch. Launches with 1.12 itemization, 1.2 item availability, Thorium Point already in game, etc.
---
That's not true. Vanilla had the most restrictions due to mana management.
---
Just report this user for making incorrect reports.
---
Hunter for sure. They are probably the hardest matchup for a mage together with a lock.
---
All of them or just a specifc one? Link to info?
---
I found his aliance guide(s) much worse than those for horde. I was honestly thinking of not using it as they are not that optimal but are so popular that some quests take forever because everyone else who follows joana's guide does them in the same order. If he's updating them tho..
---
I actually did the 'reking' as an elem shaman.   I used to kill warriors and their healbots quite frequently.   Shaman elem burst is no joke.
---
Oh man I wish someone cared enough to spend that much time on me even if it was just to roast me lol
---
People are annoying.... GMs dont normally get involved so idk what people expect
---
it's the endgame for non-raider.
---
it's the only 5 man stuff you'll do at max level, which is where you'll spend most of your time.
---
it's directly comparable.
---
Mainly that last paragraph is the important part. Guilds don’t want to gear up people who aren’t loyal.
---
Wasn't as good as it became in wrath in regards to money making, but it was still decent.  
---
Main issue is just travel time.
---
There is a tauren currently standing on the duelers being an ass so.... its a people problem.

Same story for DM.

relax? pvp?...

aight. adding you to the 'cause feeling' list.
---
Defias Brotherhood
---
Depends on your class. Mages, Druids, Hunters, and (to an extent) Rogues are control-based classes that do well in PvP the moment they hit level 60. Warriors and Warlocks need some gear before they start to feel strong.
---
*When* you hit 60 also matters. Battlegrounds aren't even out until phase 3, and when they do come out, you can just PvP to get your gear. Before then, dungeon blues will be plenty to keep you competitive on all but the most gear-dependent classes.
---
Classic uses the modern(tbc and later) scripting
---
 "Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable"
---
its against the rules so stop talking trash
---
Trying to hide behind the "technically he's not doing anything wrong" defense really puts your tragic lack of critical thinking on display for the rest of us.
---
therE's this community thing they added which do allow you to invite them to what basically a guild.
---
are you saying the community is too large?
---
I know this post is still kinda new so I guess even more people will complete this poll sooner or later but even with the previous poll OP posted. This is just another poll that again confirms warlocks are going to be way more popular than they were in the actual vanilla, meanwhile hunters and actually to my surprise even rogues are looking less popular than locks. When I saw similiar results in other polls I thought they were innacurate, however this is just another one with similiar results so I'm starting to believe that.
---
It's kinda interesting.
---
Explain
---
im sure "trollgodx" the guy grieving and standing on top of duelists is a great beta tester and contributer to bug fixxing. /s
---
That DoT needs a ton of mana and is a cleansable disease. Troll's Hex + Blackout is better.
---
Okay, that would mean you know less than nothing...
---
Rshaman did not totem twist.  Even if you had the spare mana to do it, it consumes far too many global cooldowns.  And if healing is so light that you can spend half your time and mana fucking with totems, then why are you even there?   Another DPS would provide far more dmg than a grace of air totem.
---
Eh, I wouldn't say so. It's just progressive 1.12 server like private servers of 2012, with sprinkles like gating more items.
---
Maybe link/show us the buffs you're concerned about in your OP? Might go a lot further than just saying "MASSIVE buffs" and expecting us to believe you and jump right on board. Just a thought.
---
Honestly if you are not getting bfa Id reccomend to either just level on a normal 1.12 pserver or try characters on an insta-60 one. Having said that, im also playing bfa a little again and pvp at 120 is actually kind of fun.
---
Yup \^

That's not why shaman boomkin spriest is garbage. It has absolutely nothing to do with mana.
---
Just for discussion, I'm listening to a classic podcast with a class designer for blizzard back in vanilla:
---
https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/03/27/episode-97-mute-speaks-kevin-jordan-on-druids-loot-trading-rp-pvp-av/
---
He's talking about what he wanted to do with different classes and why talents are divided a certain way.  
---
I played wow since release and I believe that the regular balance patches helped give life to wow. I fail to see how balance only patch is making the game a better experience. I would not have played all those years if they would never have released new patch in 2004.
---
Trollgodx has soda incredibly shook
---
Unfortunately no :(. This was BWL days and was from 2 guilds merging and we all went our seperate ways but holy shit was it funny. This is what made classic though. 40 outrageous fucks having a great time stumbling our way through content with not a care in the world talking about how much the raid leader loves "snowballing".
---
There were regular patches back in the day.
---
ahhh, yeah i loved what dafran did but what those guys did is just annoying.
---
3.59 in MI
---
&gt;This is your 4th hunter, what are you going to do with 4 hunters man?
---
Why don't you back off, you don't know my life!
---
but on the beta right now we're still not talking, unless someone get lost getting to gnomeregan.
---
we're still pulling entire gorup together and very rarely, if ever , CC'ing.
---
there's no CD to coordinate.
---
people are in for a big surprise if they think the socialization/community aspect will remain when everybody is rushing to max.
---
As for asmongold/esfand being above average player... everyone can do that when the skill cieiling in classic is soo low.
---
The magic wont be there, everyone will be ready. This is like comparing the end of the world that came random, vs end of the world that we all planned. Got to see how other reacted now its our time.

Dude thnx, this made my day &lt;3
---
You have to be joking.. lol.
---
Hes also working on an addon as far as I know
---
Blizzard should just ban everyone in this duel tournament area. I mean they used an exploit to get to an area not designed to be gotten to. Ban the trolls, but ban everyone else too lol
---
Hi, /u/Ketchup_Sniper
---
You either can’t read or just want to flame. No where did I say I wanted GMs to ban. I can see the argument for it, since the beta is about testing the game and promoting the game. The griefer is doing neither. 
---
You should work on your reading comprehension.
---
&gt;Okay, that would mean you know less than nothing...
---
Are you actually mentally deficient
---
Unpopular opinion: I'd love the difficulty in dungeons to be scaled up a little bit. 
---
But then again, I haven't personally tried it out. So I've no way of knowing how it feels in classic. I felt the difficulty was good on private servers - wiping in dungeons were a real threat. Especially some packs were extra mean (looking at you, goblins in Deadmines, dark iron dwarfs in gnomeregan and packs of dwarfs infront of BaelGar in BRD). Using CC seemed essential before pulls of trash moving through the dungeon. I'd hate for that danger to be missing, just because we got good. 
---
But maybe streamers are just surrounded by the best of the best and their experience compared to our own won't be close at all? Who knows. I'm on the fence on this one. 
---
I love dark souls though, so a difficult torture is right up my alley.
---
Can you site some examples?
---
Exactly, unless you get invited to the stress test.
---
I did the same when I played Vanilla. Picked a rogue and never looked back until after I had cleared MC/BWL then a Druid and a Paladin in TBC but now I’m torn!
---
People are so quick to hate on the private realms! You know, one or two of those pvt realms were more authentic than Classic will be? 
---
Because they did things like re-make AV 1.0, or they went back and made items worse to match earlier patches. Even played on one that implemented an 8-debuff limit initially. 
---
Several of those realms were also intentionally more difficult than Classic will be -- inflating boss HP.
---
Oh of course i bet your just elite as
---
Yeah I’d be into that!
---
i dont expect GMs to do anything, however banning these fucktards seems like reasonable thing to do
---
Its been awhile sense i did that but i was young and out of school. Took maybe 3 days. 6-10 hour days. Chatted with guild to keep myself entertained.
---
I almost burnt out during vanilla 3 weeks in because I couldn't find a main and my friends switched sides like 3 times. Altoholism is dangerous.
---
Please use the weekly thread for guild recruitment. It's in the sidebar.
---
The reason OSRS became massively more successful than RS3 is because the community votes on changes made to the game and new content. I doubt Blizzard will take this kind of approach with classic. Also the fact that most people want an eventual re-release of TBC, instead of expanding and creating new vanilla content (new zones, raids etc.), is pretty mind blowing to me. 
---
Blizz seriously has the option to hit the reset button with classic and take it in a completely different direction with retail, and make it an entirely new game.
---
In this context, I don't remember the exact numbers. But one full rank Holy Light healed like 1/2 or 1/3 of the tanks health, so I waited until he was that low until I healed but I was still running out of mana after every pull.
---
The tank was pretty low level from what I also remember, we had tons of trouble clearing up before Gilnid.
---
Danger Ehrin
---
Because it wasnt in classic? Probably more suited to BFA.
---
its not about making classic balanced, that was never the purpose behind the project. the purpose was to recreate vanilla as closely as possible. ion even said he wants it so if someone went into a coma playing wow in 2006 and they woke up playing vanilla in 2019, they wouldnt know the difference. they want it to be a replica of vanilla, and thats what other people want as well. vanilla is obviously not balanced at all because classes were designed to feel unique to eachother, and making classes more balanced leads to homogenization like what we have now, even though what we have in bfa is a bit of an extreme its the same idea.
---
Ok. Was more a general feeler. But I understand
---
Ignored everything I wrote, and trolled.  Sad and pathetic.
---
If a Hunter can catch the Mage at max range, Hunter'll probably win. If we're talking a more contained 1v1 with competent players, Mage stands a really good chance. If you can aggressively blink into their deadzone and freeze them, Mage gains a ton of ground. 
---
Outdoors, I'd say the Hunter has an edge but in a more restrained zone Mage will.
---
Wasnt the Tournament a Ally think First with Aamonsgold?
---
Horde or alliance?
---
The salt here is fucking glorious.
---
How is anyone, in the year of our lord two thousand nineteen, shocked that someone would come in and try to troll an open world event?
---
lol black and white manual?
---
I've healed as Enhancement on private servers and it's never been very hard. Ofc you get those groups/tanks that tries to chain pull as if it's retail, and then you're fooked. But that goes even if you're resto.
---
Slow and steady with good CC and you'll do fine healing as Enhancement.
---
Horde for sure. But will check with the guys
---
No because even on 20 seconds bosses you don't bring those classes. If you aren't a shit guild you kill bosses in less than a minute, you physically cannot oom even if you play a elemental shaman or some shit. The whole shit about mana is just a meme. Obviously they do go oom fast, but even if they don't oom, their dps is still garbage.
---
Prob. Sold Like ervyone and now recovered xD
---
I've watched too many Lindybeige videos and he ruined back scabbards for me. But it does look cool as fuck for some reason lol.
---
Tranq only removes Frenzy effect in vanilla
---
Magmadar, 1 of the drakes in BWL, chromaggus, huhuran, and Gluth are the only bosses that tranq is used
---
Why? This is how stuff Work. If alliance come over and gank, this is how it work. People Just Want Grab the 2k $ xD
---
I understood you perfectly fine, you are using "slippery slope" argument, banning some fucktards that for 2 hours straight grief community made tournament which has viewer base much higher than any HoTS or SC2 event would cause some "dangerous precedent".
---
Because it's all false. Yes you don't totemtwist in all situations, but you do in places where the healing is light. You can't just constantly change around how many healers you have. Some bosses/packs do less damage than others.
---
Well this tournaments are Not real Testing AS well. It is to generate Content to build Hype.

Germany (along with some other countries) has a long history of this stuff. I'm surprised if you haven't heard of this as a German before.
---
Though in the case of WoW removing blood would more likely be something to do with getting a lower ESRB rating or something.
---
I'll agree to disagree. I think honest people foster a better game community.
---
alliance are not doing anyhting they are peacefully watching. the level 1 horde alts are stadnding on top of people to ruin it are the problem
---
are you sure it isnt the Deep Wounds talent in Arms?
---
It would be hard for McDonalds quality to get any worse
---
Definetly. How could he not be? I think blizz should give him more keys so he can get more friends to beta test
---
&gt; As you said, DPS warriors in pvp were great but even still they were rare, and in vanilla raids viturally none existant…  
---
You know nothing about shaman healing.
---
Ignored everything I wrote, and trolled. Sad and pathetic. I won't reply to you again.
---
This reminds me of Crendor's Beta Bob video
---
"I'd suggest not makin' a rogue, you have four of them and they're all under level 30."
---
Narrow it down to horde or alliance, eliminating paladin or shaman. Then, once u feel like you enjoy X class the most, stop watching videos on the other classes. Maybe try out a pserver to help you decide, level a few classes and see what you like. Good luck
---
Because then JimmyJohn69 is going to come up with an idea that won't affect Classic very much and that'll get implemented. Then BlazerBro420 will come up with an idea that won't affect Classic very much and *it* will be implemented. Then CoolManL33t will come up with an idea and let's say that it too gets implemented. And by the end of everyone implementing all these little ideas that don't affect the game, they really start to begin affecting the game.. 
---
So no, no to all of these little ideas, no to any of these little ideas.

Not at all sure no! My memory is very hazy, I did play a warrior back then.. so could be?

One of my buddies college who was a touch more adeventorous with drug experimentation, he tried heroin.

Said it was the best he’d ever felt in his life, he recalled realizing and making a decision at the time. He knew if he ever did it again he’d never stop, but he also knew he’d never feel that good ever again. 
---
Fortunately for him, he choose to know what nirvana was and decide not to keep experiencing it. Many aren’t so lucky.

I’d like to know what “the best feeling ever. Period.” Is. But I’m not sold I’m strong enough to say “never again” after the first time.

*Don't you dare!*
---
Sounds like a cool idea for an add-on, but I don't think they should be adding much to the game that wasn't already there.

I'm offended.
---
But What is the issue Standing on? They can Just target and interact?
---
I want to be the best.
---
My go to order at 17 was a double quarter pounder with cheese, large fry, 10 piece nugget, and a large chocolate shake.
---
I was 6'1" and 135 pounds from like 16 through 23 - no matter how much I ate, I couldn't gain weight. Even now at 26 I'm 160 and trying to get to 175. I exercise a lot too. Just doesn't happen.
---
When has the term, in a vanilla context, ever been damage dealer?
---
Bring me some **coffee**
---
I mained a hunter in retail vanilla. I am likely making a hunter as my main alt in Classic. So I have my main + Hunter. I plan to start clearing MC/BWL with my hunter by the time AQ is out which I will raid with my main. 
---
Hunter 8/8 Dragonstalker is possibly the most OP set bonus in the game. It has essentially an effect close to the Saphiron Trinket. With Chromagus x-bow and nice trinkets/rings, you will be a force even until post-naxx. 
---
The Naxx gear on hunter is great, especially the KT xbow but not a massive jump over 8/8 DS + Chrom xbow.

If we're talking TBC, that doesn't really solve this particular issue since the metas and exploits for that are also known. That said, I do love TBC (though flying has got to go, splitting up the world in yet another continent I'd rather not see and balancing PvP just for 3v3 arenas brought some real issues down the line).
---
That's precisely the reason why GM time shouldn't be wasted chasing ghosts

Rogue is second to warriors. I’m the 3rd best melee dps in my guild as a rogue behind 2 warriors. So I can easily beat unskilled warriors but not skilled ones.
---
I remember it felt rather anti climatic. I was a warrior, and I dinged 60 from a random dwarf in BRD.
---
Was a nice “now I can finally play for real” feeling though.

I also thought it looked like some WoW style landscape so I figured two birds one stone.

I'm a big fan of the Chipotle price index.

&gt; Because the community can’t take action on the user, you could make the claim that a gm should.
---
Banning is indeed one form of taking action. Apologies if in all the streamer-defense spam I'm getting you are semi caught up in it.
---
This is a really interesting issue to think about - not just with the crystals. How will knowing what is coming next change how people play?
---
That's something many people have a severe lack of understanding of... People neglect to factor inflation into allot of purchases or sales.. people don't realize all assets, or incomes devalue 50% every 22 years even if it's value remains steady.. because purchasing power is severely affected by inflation .. if you work making 100k a year.. in 22 years you should be making 150k or your lifestyle will take a huge hit.. allot of jobs don't give raises that steadily
---
Also interested in this.
---
BigMacro economics
---
Incorrect assumption, bad argument. I quit BfA like 2 weeks into it, maybe did about 5 explorations for a quest or some shit
---
There are going to be A LOT of players that have never experienced WoW in it's most hardcore state. They won't be ready for it you know?
---
Anything to help people out is good.

I'm just going to use Questie.

so this is the power of the classic community.

---
When I was a rogue, I'd carry spirit of zanza, healing potions, grilled squid, rumsey rum, mongoose elixir, three types of juju's, bandages, and various types of protection potions. 
---
So maybe one full bag worth of consumables. But I wasn't very try-hard.  You could add oil of immolation, strath holy water, flasks, etc. You can bring quite a bit if you're willing to try. If you're playing like more of a casual, you can do okay through most of the content just bringing some mongoose pots and HP pots.
---
EQ prog servers should definitely be looked at and discussed along with OSRS. I’m not to person to discuss it with, very limited knowledge in those departments.(Have a few friends that really like OSRS, and my EQ knowledge ended with a lvl 16 necromancer back in 03 :) I would look forward to reading the discussion though, any added knowledge to the possibility of what lies ahead for wow classic is a good thing.
---
Search function exists.
---
Huh.. didn't know that was a thing. Cool! 
---
Too bad I'm a Horde. But I'll definitely try getting that for the meme. Will look good on a beefy male orc warrior, or perhaps as part of a pimping-out-my-bank-alt gear.
---
As what? I’m not saying im elite... i just don’t use guides. I enjoy vanilla. I also have the quests memorized after years of playing vanilla. I just feel like you miss a lot just following a guide that tells you what to do every time you go do something. Why so negative? I’m all for questie i just feel like guides like zygor that spell it out for you take it a bit far.
---
A Gm (probably Omar) took the form of Patchwerk and took down the bosses on his own like a real MVP
---
So interested in this. Hopefully we can get a relamslist before release and plan it out.
---
That stuff was very real back then, had my vanilla acc stolen as well
---
In the video he points out that a lot of the players he rolled with hadn't played WoW in many years yet it was still a cakewalk. 
---
I think a big part of it is 1.12 balance/talents which makes it a lot easier.
---
No, We stick by the same principals we did in Vanilla, nobody tests endgame.  Nobody gets an advantage in the world first races because no endgame gets tested, if there is a bug, we all suffer through it, if there are no bugs, everyone starts on an equal footing.  We really don't know exactly how the endgame will be tuned because Private Servers are a guesswork.

---
I had about 6 level 20-40 characters in vanilla, and two 60s.
---
Again. You called it what you called it. My server called it what we called it. Name calling is unnecessary. Just because some called something different than you doesn't make them retarded. It also doesn't make them objectively something. It would be subjective.
---
Offhand, I can't think of anything good that comes from armorsmithing.
---
Except that, somehow, it actually isn't. Distinct classes have massive advantages right now in BFA (such warlock/priest in raid, rogue, warrior in mythic plus). 
---
While they do play the same (I main ret pally and a rogue), the damage output, mobility, utility is still massively skewed in a favor of a rogue in every scenario.
---
Melissa the priest invited me, still thankful :)
---
The GM is often the RL, but some GMs are too lazy / tired to do both, which os perfectly reasonablem
---
Same here, I started on a Pserver, but I can only bring myself to play a few hours a week, still nowhere near 60.  Only because it doesn't feel permanent, I know my toons can be deleted and the servers go down at any time.
---
I thought I read or saw an interview that the original implementation involved Tauren running for some time and either they gradually increased up to mounted speed or it just kicked in after awhile as long as they weren't in combat.  I think there were implementation/fairness issues, but I can't recall where I saw/heard this.
---
Interesting perspective, I wonder how they treat people(groups?) who disrupt trade/city chat making it borderline unusable.
---
&gt;In private servers where this "progression" is implemented, guilds just store all unwanted epics and disenchant them as soon as AQ patch hits. This leads to guilds having hundreds of crystals from day 1.
---
Are you retarded? Almost all raid epics are soulbound, no one is filling their bags and bank with soulbound epics, carrying them around for 8 months so they can make a little bit of money.
---
I just want to play Vanilla again man
---
Not wow related per se but my wife has been clean for a year and a half. Used for about seven years. Was a tough struggle but it can be done, and it's worth it. She would have probably been dead in six months if she hadn't quit when she had.
---
We all died right after i took the screenshot :D
---
Female troll.
---
I'm one of the people that wants a relaunch of TBC, but I also understand that may not be the best route and am open to seeing what happens with new content for classic
---
Gg
---
ungoro crater, I despise forest zones
---
Thank you for the fun :)
---
One day soon I'll curl up in a fluffy blanket with a bottle of wine and watch this again. It is decided.
---
Was playing there as well

:)
---
Because you could just leave the video at 7:40 and it would be fine. Instead you pulled some dickhead move that just serve to piss people off.

---
You mean the addons back in vanilla that automated shitton of things were any better?
---
Are you thinking of Garr? I don't think you could tranq any of his abilities or effects.
---
It wasn't small.
---
When you say you had an allowance that makes me think that you had zero Bill's to pay to go along with that
---
I feel really bad for Soda, he played that so well only to be screwed over by getting feared out of range after blowing all his cds. That warlock was literally just spamming fear and summon voidwalker over and over so lame...
---
I feel like questie is enough is what I’m sayin. Zygor almost plays the game for you.
---
My computer had a whopping 512mb of RAM at the time, some old POS Compaq PC. I remember upgrading to 1gb and it was one of the best experiences I had in vanilla: being able to run around IF without so much video lag.
---
Any idea when it'll become available for installation via battlenet? Is it not going to be available until August 27th?
---
That’s fair. I can see that spam getting outta hand. Cheers and good luck in the wars to come.
---
The most entertaining part is all the people getting triggered over the trolls. It’s honestly more entertaining than the actual duels.
---
Yep, I'm only seeing the mist of blood on crits here. Most PvP Warriors back then were specc'd Arms with Deep Wounds.
---
;0
---
People like you at the absolute worst. He's griefing end of story
---
If you want every class to have the same abilities and be “balanced” then BFA is bundled into your subscription.
---
Enjoy.
---
R14 and frostsaber.....
---
Its not unheard of, but to have to go and “recover” an account like that is pretty unlikely
---
are you graphic designer? cool work
---
It is, but maybe Just Family &amp; Friends so I feel they dont so Public waves ATM.
---
Thank you man. I needed to hear this... 😭
---
And? Clearly it worked well for him.
---
They're the only people I camp, lmao.
---
Theres like so many other factors!  I won’t say what they are though because I just want to sound like I know what im talking about!
---
Holy shit an elite wow player!!!!?
---
That's how you play warlock though. He didn't even use fel dom.
---
And congrats
---
Im not, just free time and years of messing with photoshop, youtube tutorials and what not
---
Mad how quick he has picked up Vanilla. Drink walking, the lot.
---
Gotta watch some streams of warriors with deep wounds tomorrow and see if it's present, or somehow less than shown in the Maydie one. ^^
---
R14 and that mount grind
---
What does discord do with your data? Is it exportable? And how do they make money?
---
(All serious questions, I just don't "get" Discord)
---
I'm so glad I'm set with a guild to never have to interact with spergs like u
---
Balance changes would ruin the very purpose we are having classic. Next you want item nerfs I suppose?
---
Lmao you're so fucking confident in yourself and it's hilarious how wrong you are. My guild killed Twin Emps with only warrior tanks after trying (and failing) to use Warlocks w/ shadow resistance.
---
Because you had to opt in to a new beta option that didn't exist before it was announced.
---
You are ridiculous... you claim the other dude has no reading comprehension when you fail miserably at it yourself...
---
He is saying that some specs in vanilla just sucked, like ret pally, moonkin, etc., and that he would like that those specs receive a buff so that they are a viable choice for raiding as well.
---
He is making the same point you are making which is that people should be able to play what they want. But unlike you, he actually wants that those choices are valid.
---
He already has an add-on that works on pservers at least
---
People also had like 7-10 buffs in BGs.
---
The Mafia represent. Although my 29 twink was in soth.
---
Great work. Here's a potential hunter bug list that's worth looking into as well: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rQRdHw8LgmiPEVc8ST-cwdD1kKkBwhwlK1f0eO45voU/edit#gid=0
---
Does anyone know how Blizz plans to handle the legendary necklace dropped by Garr? Any word on the uhh.. panda-pet, or diablo-pet, or murloc-pet? Frost/fire tabards?

---
I resemble this guy 😊
---
I'm exactly that guy. I played vanilla on release, not as a child, in a serious guild until the end of BC. I'm waking up in 2019, buy a new computer to play wow classic.  
---
I'm not even pushing for balance! I'd like to see overpowered builds one month and people crying in the forums. That was part of the original experience.
---
Uber is really great
---
Really lame.
---
Questing without a guide isn’t hard...
---
How do paladins enable those setups?
---
I honestly don’t know. I’m a noob. So could you please explain? Thank you in advance!
---
What is Adderall? Asking from Germany.
---
Sure, so? Did you misunderstand what I said? Inflation and increasing wages further devalue a constant 15us price.
---
If you start your own guild, sure. Nefarian is the only encounter that's really rough on Druid tanks (good luck with that class call).
---
I plan on starting a guild and being the MT of my guild early on. Eventually, I want to outsource MT duties to a Warrior so that I can OT and spot heal. But if I can't find a trustworthy Warrior to take over for me, then I might just keep on tanking.
---
See the Guy, could use target macro instead of Tab target / Mouse click xD
---
he's been jumping around and 'trolling' for hours it's actually crazy
---
Once again just shitting on classic, if you don’t like the game no one is going to force you to play. If the negativity is based on fear that classic is going to draw in some guildies/friends that you’re currently enjoying BfA with, then that is a real concern. But ripping  on classic isn’t going to solve that. Best of luck to you and yours.
---
Remove the ‘s’ and the ‘27’ from your username
---
I guess every fighting game under the sun lacks good game mechanics, because nuances that add depth to the games aren't obvious to figure out.
---
He did use feldom in the first duel, it's a 15 minute cooldown
---
Nice vid man!
---
Some people like that. They like having a guide book when playing final fantasy or whatever their single player game of choice is. That literally plays the game for them.
---
I feel you though, I mean for us Questie is clearly enough, but some people need their hand held, I mean... Have you seen some of the players in wow? :D
---
Eh fair enough, maybe I'm just completely full of shit on this one I'm wrong all the time like most people. I still just can't see a reason why this is a serious issue. End of the day this type of stuff did happen in vanilla (a guilds funeral been griefed in vanilla as an example) and I just don't see a problem with it in a game like this.
---
But why should those viewer counts matter? It’s not a blizzard event. Why are they more important that him? If you say he should be banned for ruining an event that has a lot of viewers then you are actually proving my slippery slope argument correct.
---
It's probably muscle memory he still has from back in the day
---
I didn’t know about the tram or flight paths between storm wind and ironforge so the quest that you can get to deliver a package to ironforge from goldshire I walked the entire way and then walked back to keep doing the quests in the forest.
---
It’s pretty dumb because that Tauren is blocking the tremor totems making them untargetable. They should have had someone on the other side of the word summon them both for the duel
---
Help blizzard this guy keeps jumping around us and bothering us MOOOOOOM!!!!!
---
Biggest I can remember is unlocking an AoE (Hurricane?) on my Druid and thinking it was so cool that it was the only skill I would run. Even in dungeons.
---
I see your reading comprehension lacks as well.
---
I understand those specs suck, but saying that nobody enjoys playing them is just wrong. I’m agreeing that people who play those classes are probably just wasting their time, but if you read OPs post, he says there are no logical responses from the nochanges crowd, and then I present him with logical arguments and he uses straw mans to support his narrative versus proving me wrong.
---
If all choices were valid and all classes were balanced then that would ruin the game, it’s really not that difficult to understand why especially when BFA exists as a perfect example.
---
Yeah a priest just lost because he couldnt target totems i guess you should make a macro for each totem too
---
Lil zoomzoom mad his favorite streamer tournament is griefed?
---
This definitely never happened in vanilla...
---
https://youtu.be/YgXW-cKI1bw
---
If you're truly #nochanges then you should keep the game on its earliest alpha form tbh.
---
Shame you can't duel inside instances. That would have solved some issues.
---
Yep, that's what I did and I specified which account I wanted the old account to merge into on the ticket. My old account was just a straight WoW account, not even registered on battle.net, and they did everything in about 30 minutes. Now the old account is a dropdown option on my main account under WoW.
---
Not true. Maul spam beats Warrior threat (and any DPS threat) even without a Pummeler. The Pummeler is really more of an insurance policy than anything. Vael is the only time it's necessary (and only because DPS put out much more threat than normal due to unlimited resources).
---
Yikes, to anyone considering buying gold: this guy has no idea what he’s talking about.
---
What are you telling me for? There's people who want the level cap raised and I'm saying I'm not for it. If they wanted to test out ALL of the bugs of the game, they should have started the cap at 60. But they didn't for a reason. If they want to do that though, the best way to do that without raising the cap every other week is to give free 60s to everybody to test out classes and specs and make sure there are no bugs with classes and such. And at the end of the beta, it's all gone.
---
Nobody gets an advantage in the world first races if you get an instant level 60, you get advantages by leveling classes from 1-30 constantly in different areas to figure out the best way to tackle zones, so that point you made is completely out of the discussion.
---
uWish ;)
---
 Pretty sure this effect only happens when you use Rend.
---
100,000+ watching and no action by blizzard, do thry not care or or they THAT incompetent?
---
Also with flying and contenents, everyone has fragmenting more and more. I can't wait to go back to running past groups of people in Darkshire.
---
Or Just Tab Target / Nameplates dunno. The Tauren Not Really Block anything. He is anyoing but Not Ruin it. People Just Bad if they click xD
---
He's too old to be doing that
---
I'm certain that 2 weeks after release we will see thousands of post from kids who never played and suddenly realize that ret pally is not a viable spec.
---
To be fair, your “retail MoP baby” part came across as a bit aggressive.
---
Till half the planet runs weapon chains.
---
&gt;  attributes or bonuses that were only active in that raid.
---
Blizz tried something similar with this but in PvP and it didn't end well for a lot of classic players.
---
&gt;some new zones like hyjal post naxx and make everything in it hard as fuck
---
I was watching a stream the other day (don't hate me, I just didn't got invited to the stress test and I'm really hyped), and when I watched the raid going through the plaguelands, and every enemy being a real threat, why don't just open an open world raid? We already have open world bosses. Make it so a solo player can farm the first mobs so if you find somebody else you will invite him and go furthest, so it makes grouping a necessity, but at the same time you would have minmaxers raiders at the end trying to complete the zone (and maybe some PvP, so it makes it harder to discover the best way to min/max, encouraging theorycrafting)
---
reddit please ban /u/katjezz he's making my reddit experience bad and he used a derogatory word to describe the mentally handicapped.

The ever-fleeting mystery as to why classic wow is just pure magic while nothing else feels quite the same is simple, it is tailored after real life.
---
 \- In life you struggle.
---
 \- going through life entirely alone is impossible from both a mental and physical point of view, you need connections to function and that's what society is.
---
 \- Resources ,for the majority of people, are scarce and crucial for survival.
---
 \- People who have it hard in life enjoy when they achieve/earn / gain things that they worked sweat and blood much more than people who didn't. In comparison a rich kid who has it all in life will probably not feel any joy in anything they gain/do because values no longer exist from their perspective.
---
It kind of makes me wonder whether real life is the true mmorpg sometimes.
---
Thanks :)
---
Also, for people who are coming into classic late or leveling an alt, you can help provide community for the new or re-leveling players!
---
Have fun watching.
---
Without a doubt yes. Game breaking bugs should all be fixed.
---
I tried to sell a BoP robe.
---
&gt; "feeding"
---
We're playing WoW here, not League of legends     
---
Stop talking trash LULW
---
The very best? Like no one ever was?
---
? Okay lol
---
Excellent conversation bud, have a good day.
---
Missing keyring isn't on the list, cba making a google acc
---
Hey, I resemble that remark!
---
&gt; You cannot attack the mob (he knocks you back with a 5000dmg arcane burst if you get in melee range). No attack = No Rage = No Thunderclap.
---
It's obvious from this part alone you have no knowledge of warrior mechanics so you should have just stopped talking when you had the chance.
---
As short as gnomes?
---
im gonna be reading builds, theorycraft etc and wait for it and in the end im not actually gonna even play it
---
Those people who raided funerals got temp banned.
---
i thought i'd catch a few minutes of it but am still watching. Brings back so many memories. I am pulling for cdew because those wf procs are sexy.
---
Make sure you are looking at the classic database, at classic.wowhead.com or by clicking on the 'classic box' next to search.
---
We also added item stat filters yesterday, so if you didn't know the name of the item, you could search for shields that have armor in the 1400-1500 range to narrow it down :) https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292058/classic-item-stat-filters-added-to-wowheads-database
---
Hope these taurens names get leaked. So we can pay them a little visit.
---
I'm saying it now, you won't enjoy Classic. I suggest you stick to retail if you need this much hand holding.
---
I guess there's some truth to that. But they do have to constantly spam mana pots and dark runes off CD which nobody did during BC iirc.
---
Very cool lot of fun. Tested it in Classic Stress Test
---
Same here. I was so happy after helping our warlocks farm shadow resist gear to just do the job myself when we couldn't get lock tanks to work. Also, this wegwacc guy is saying "No attack = No Rage = No Thunderclap" which is pretty hilarious because a warrior tank gains most of his rage from damage taken, not damage dealt.
---
It all sounds fine and technical but druids are very much confirmed to be very viable tanks and this parry difference is not going to change that lol. 
---
And if I can be brutally honest I expect every single raid and every single boss to die fairly quickly for a lot of people. You are making it sound like a big problem when in reality there is almost no challenge what so ever in the first couple of raids except for a few bosses. This isn’t 2004, general player level is much higher than back then, so the only challenge people get from raiding on private servers are speed running the places. Hell Naxx has been cleared in its entirety in little more than an hour.
---
I couldnt find something at work on my first day, in a storeroom full of boxes. I asked my boss who was walking by if he could point it out quickly, as it was my first time in that room. He said snidely, "can't you read?". I replied "I mean I do have a college degree" then after a second I said, "to be fair though I never did any reading"
---
Found trollgodx/y
---
So What Class should I Pick for Beta? Is there any shortage in the Beta?
---
I mained warlock for vanilla-tbc. 
---
I never used Void sac.... not even once.
---
&gt; Corpse camping
---
It's fine dude, this is classic.
---
&gt; Camping low level zones to kill grey players
---
Too bad, log out and come back in an hour dude, classic :)
---
&gt; Some lvl 1 tauren run around, not attacking anyone, not doing anything but run around
---
FUCKING BAN THAT GUY, HE'S RUINING MY EXPERIENCE
---
My previous comment was deleted due to saying the pservers names so I'll abbreviate them.
---
This is what caused some of the developers from E to break away and start the LH server(where there was still corruption). There were many accounts from people who worked on the project stating this and other shady acts, such as gold selling and creating characters to sell, caused them to leave or get forced out because they tried to call them out on it.
---
When it blew up the head of E even made a public statement saying he did it and deserved to do it and would continue to do it. Found that post link as well https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/7729jo/its_time_to_confess_post_has_been_deleted_here_is/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwivz-znzMviAhURSK0KHeyCBpIQrAIoAjAAegQICBAJ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TUVqYq-Q5oL6HBE7b7G_J&amp;cshid=1559506094922
---
Just Google E wow gold selling corruption and you'll see all the drama.
---
Found a link for you https://www.neogaf.com/threads/e(lysium-project-wow-private-server-group-disbands-due-to-uncovered-corruption.1448828/
---
(Take away the parentheses in E to follow the link)
---
The nerfs to gold farms only happened under E not the nos devs iirc.
---
lmao like the alliance wouldn't have done the same thing if the tables were turned.
---
I never looted gray items, because I thought they were useless/worthless.  I missed out on a lot of cash.
---
Well hopefully we see some sort of balance changes
---
I leveled my warrior back when TBC released (I had mage 60 but re-rolled to warrior for TBC). I leveled him as tank. The quests and mobs were still vanilla like. It was good. I dont mind take time to kill mobs, and I did all dungeons during leveling 4-5 times each at least :P
---
Oh I have, the salt has been flowing all day and it’s glorious.
---
Gelkis every time. Fuck those Magram guys.
---
ya dude these guys are terrible, just probably some of the best classic pvpers in the game
---
im torn between Resto druid and Resto shaman, but it leans more towards a Resto Shaman, im so looking forward to it!
---
Ok so temp ban these people...but then you'll have to temp ban the duelers since what they are doing is against tos as well
---
This is not going to be a popular answer, but it's the truth: I think that the most hardcore raiders are going to spend some real-life cash on gold. They always have and they always will. If dropping a few hundred bucks on gold makes the game more enjoyable for you, then I say go for it.
---
Lol the man babies in this community will always amaze me. The autism is strong here.
---
people change their minds the closer we are on release. I voted for paladin back then but now I am gonna level a hunter first.
---
I did the same. Wall jumping into Hyjal is probably one of my most memorable moments ever in WoW. I loved every second of it.
---
So relocate to a contested zone?
---
Dunno, I'm not the creator of the video. The clips might be from a mix of servers.
---
our guild didnt have geared warriors so i could just press 3 buttons and be at top :) wouldnt have known that warriors are good back then. already learned so much new about the game
---
Did arcane fire leveling till my MT for my guild decided to teach me a lesson about not over aggroing.  
---
Looted chests without rolling. 
---
Equipped two boe epics leveling up instead of auctioning. 
---
Putting the game before my personal life.
---
Would dual spec fix an issue like this?
---
I've not done any scripting in wow so this might be stupid. 
---
But i saw someone the other day that had a script include defining a %target that was then used later in the script. 
---
Are these global? If so you could use one mouse over macro to quickly set your %target before the pull that is then used in your cc macro.
---
Then hitting max and not knowing how to get started on playing the rest of the game.
---
Same here :P Will level a class first that I will be able to grind/farm gold and materials easily. Then I will level my "main"
---
no idea
---
Well that's incorrect as the 2nd stress test has already happened in May.
---
Duskwood is one of my favourite zones.
---
Defiantly isn’t because I play a paladin and it’s full of undead.
---
I would not be happy about **balance only** changes. Ideally, new balance changes should come with content designed with the new meta in mind. Perhaps Blizzard should add some leveling content after 60  to help people learn the new classes. And maybe add a coherent theme around the new leveling zones with a connection to the Warcraft RPG lore. Maybe something to balance the lore back into something for the horde and explore the old homeland of the orcs. Certainly balance the class situation between the horde and alliance with new races that can roll paladin for the horde and shaman for the alliance.
---
dude fuck tos even if that is not the case  beta is given by them as a privilege its not a right people didnt pay to play in the beta they can take access from grievers or whoever they want
---
Best mount ever. The grind sure did take awhile during Vanilla, but you bet I will be working towards it when I hit 60 in Classic.
---
Good luck.   Everything outside of naxx and C'thun  is totally trivial with patch 1.12.
---
I thought Hyjal was absolutely stunning, but that was a locked zone so not sure if it counts :p
---
If not I always found Teldrassil amazing but that’s where my first character was made so I might be a little nostalgic about that one.
---
They won't ban him, nothing will happen.
---
I like how you guys defend low level killing and corpse camping but because some random lvl 1 is running around on stream you flip your shit and want him banned.
---
i dont rly see anyone being upset?
---
I tried to find some information about seal twisting, but nobody is talking about it. Does it exist in classic? What about totem twist? If those don't work should be added as bugs
---
I would like to know when Ret thrives and helps a raid. No one is asking for 7 Rets.
---
But most guilds are recruiting 5-7 Fury Warriors, 5-7 Mages, Prot Warriors only, Priest and Paladin healers, so on.
---
Added it &lt;3
---
That’s exactly why the Big Mac Index is a good indicator...
---
Well Soda pretty much won the duel, but lost due to a fear sending him out of the duel zone. They had to reduel and Soda had no more cool downs.
---
Let's see about that, batching will be reimplemented anyway, not sure it will affect that ..
---
Tips has proven to be massively misinformed about a lot of things.
---
lol Xd
---
Alternately, time spent working could be spent on WOW ! :o
---
More seriously, back then the economy hadn't still recovered from 9/11 and there were literally no jobs (at least where I lived).
---
That doesnt change your chances to get in a group though... Mage is THE class for groups. Portals, Sheep, Food/water, Intellect Buff, Kite... every group will start with a Tank, healer and a mage.
---
I wish!
---
Alas, I was unaware of bitcoin at the time :(
---
Epic, beautiful, goosebumps! Keep it up😍
---
Seriously, all these people calling for Trollgodx to be banned have no idea what Vanilla was.
---
The stress test was all I needed. 
---
I brainstormed some different Race/Class/Character name ideas and found my Main + main alt that I am happy with. 
---
Got to level 5 just to mess around but that's it. We've already waited 13 years for Classic, 3 more months is nothing.
---
And that’s fine.
---
Yeah but in Europe we always get the short end of the stick : high prices and shitty economy.
---
What about anger issues ? You're super mad buddy, it's a video game and you're not even playing. Calm your tits.
---
He's literally standing on top of tremor totems. It's not game breaking buts it's super annoying and takes away from the competetive integrity.
---
i did not play druid in vanilla but considering one for my alt,
---
is there anywhere i can see a list of spells unique to each forms druids can change into? like, what spells cant you use in bear form etc.
---
That's why I recommend a server with high xp rates so you at least have a somewhat gradual experience. Much faster than retail will be, but still a good idea.
---
I’ll try to pick some favorites out tonight. And figure out how to post them.
---
My friend honestly believed that quests were a waste of time, so when I started playing on his account he told me to mob grind only. I managed to level 1-43 on mobs alone.
---
I'd start with a couple spikes in the heart, burn it and then burry it deep !
---
Then why do Frost Mages and Fury Warriors get to?
---
Just play on LH, its the closest to vanilla and you can test some things out (lvling routes etc).
---
That is dedication.
---
Dushichka?
---
Source on a couple of years?
---
I remember the blood splat sound when getting a crit on my warrior. I’m not 100% but I don’t recall this happening on my rogue or paladin during crits. 
---
So like others have said before, it is probably from deep wounds.
---
Mend pet duh.
---
there is something wrong with the [damage for sure](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs5q6x/different_damage_values_same_gear/).
---
surviving through everything is the least representative element of vanilla. 
---
everyone is pushing the "classic was hard and that leads to stories and friendships" while they are making it easy as fuck. this is hypocritical and stupid. and the fact that there are hordes of bots downvoting every thread like this aggressively, why? undeniable the difficulty was part of vanilla.
---
[tanking in instances](https://clips.twitch.tv/GeniusAthleticDonkeyBibleThump). face up 4 elites with a 2h, in battle stance and deathwish on. he tanked like this from DM up to SM :|. defensive stance obsolete, shields - who needs them? cc the mob? - lol, fuck that!
---
blizzard is afraid that tourists will abandon the game way early with all the qol features lacking and making it hard will not help with that.
---
so we're getting some washed up, LFR version of vanilla.
---
Now id only my wages rose to match the inflation of the world
---
I want to be able to heal or dps without making an alt. So I'm going either Druid, Priest, or Pally.
---
Calm down buddy, it's a video game and you're not even playing.
---
Fishing while leveling does not give you money, but saves money.
---
They used to sit on my fucking fishing bobber so I couldn't click my fish
---
Why can't both co-exist? There will be a lot of players who bounce between Retail and Classic, hence the $15 sub covering both games.
---
There are still a lot of people who wont play Classic not because they dont enjoy it, but because they simply already did it. There are a lot of people who aren't into retro game experiences and only want to move forward, so they just play the new iterations.
---
been asking for this aswell, so far what ive gather is that theres mostly technical changes dude to the legion engine being used, wide screen support, 244hz etc.
---
other than that the only thing ive noticed is stealth animation for rogues is also changed to its legion version.
---
Pick one. Get hyped. Get confused. Fall into despair. Pick a new one. Get hyped. Get ...
---
Devouring plague also hits like a truck in the situations where you are able to use it. But if you're always playing vs. competent groups, then I'd agree with you. Perhaps it's better to plan to beat competent players.
---
I accidentally sold the [Mageblade](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=17103) to a vendor and didn't even realize it. Had to put in a GM ticket to get it back.
---
They really don’t make much sense, do they.
---
I'm pretty sure it got nerfed on Nostalrius
---
Quick search, [here's](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=23833) a post from Nostalrius of players asking for the Tribute run to be nerfed. It's not a made up conspiracy, it actually really impacts the economy.
---
Personally I'm not a fan of 'off-shoring' my problems onto others aso I won't take advantage of it but it's really cool what he's doing.
---
You are not talking for everyone here. You don't want changes but a lot of people would like new content after phase 6 and there's an issue with the itemization that makes the curent content very different.
---
I was listening to a podcast with the top druid on the private servers and the whole powershifting thing really turns me off. I don't think that bugs and exploit for once, that was discovered over the 10 years private servers are running, should stay in the game.
---

---
But of those 3 types of heals..you used different ranks of them. You didnt just always use max ranks, for priests
---
Paid for =/= "are paying for". 
---
It's semantics at that point. Clearly OP paid for the game at a point in time. 
---
Regardless of whether or not OP was currently paying for the game, you seem to be taking a combative approach to someone asking an otherwise innocuous question.
---
If you do no not play much it's normal and fair not to have as much gold as somebody sinking hours into it though. And on top of that most people won't be able to do this since it heavily depends on the class you play. I don't think supporting a broken mechanic advantageous specifically to you for the sake of QoL is good personally.
---
Should the subreddit have some sort of requirement that when people post these "recovered account posts" they need to link the armory as well? To make sure its not just a karma farm?
---
I share his pain.
---
Yeah wtf no. Nerfing a perfectly fair pick pocket farming method that uses no exploits and is 100% how the developers inteded it isn't the same as fixing an dungeon resetting exploit that nets over 3 times the amount of BRD pick pocketing.
---
3.5 would be a terrible idea IMO, Naxx gear is already powercreep enough.
---
Thanks that basically just confirms my thoughts.
---
&gt;...Things like server transfers and race changes were available later in Classic. I could see a world in--let's say a year into Classic--as realms have become mature where a player wants to transfer to a different server to join a guild there to play with their friends, and they want us to provide a way that can make it happen....
---
He doesn't outright say only if the players want it. 
---
Plus it was in classic so we have to have it .#nochanges.
---
We might not get appearance change but using two race changes does the same thing at a significant cost.
---
It is completely jaded to think retail changes were just by "casuals"
---
A lot of the changes are things "Us Vanilla veterans" thought we wanted, but realized we didn't.
---
It's why listening to your consumers can be so dangerous. Sometimes "You think you do, but you don't" is true.
---
How does that piss you off more than dragging the entire vid out with nonsense like everyone else is doing? At least now we know it's done at 7:40 and the rest is just the creator giving the finger to Google's crappy algorithm.
---
You don't know anything about classic wow pvp lol shut your goofy ass up
---
For the love of god, please don't spec Prot to level. You don't need to be Prot to tank dungeons while leveling. You'll be so much stronger solo leveling and kill stuff so much faster.
---
Looks like they got banned lol
---
Planning on rolling a lock, do you have to farm shards at every login? Do they disappear like health stones or mage water?
---
Yea there were, they led us to BfA
---
Hunters start strong in MC/BWL, then taper off hugely in AQ40 and beyond.  
---
A heavily geared warrior will pretty much always be #1, but at lower levels of gear, rogues beat them.   
---
Mage/warlock remain about even, though at ultra-high gear levels, warlocks pull ahead slightly.
---
Well that is why they click Nameplates :o But I heard totem Marco Not Work.
---
But What ever xD I get my Beta tomorrow, so I can Check Out. O actually through they invited normal people to tournament.
---
&gt; So 30-40 there will be more bugs to report leveling? Nobody is ever gonna do all the quests and kill all the mobs and be able to report every single issue in the game.
---
Well, 30-40 opens up more quests, more zones, more dungeons, more talents that can be purchased, so a lot more stuff that can be tested.  No one single person is likely to do all of that, of course, which is why there's lots of people in there, so they get varied feedback from a variety of people doing different things.  You'll have people doing all kinds of things and hopefully reporting back.  I'd also bet they've got people keeping an eye on the data and seeing if anything weird pops up.
---
Whatever reason people want for caps, raised caps, whatever, Blizzard's the ones in charge, and I think they'd do gradually raised caps in order to do phased testing.  It just makes sense.  They want it to be as smooth as possible when it launches.
---
Heck, Asmongold keeps saying he'd prefer they don't test the raids so people can go in blind, but at least he recognizes that they won't do that because they don't want to risk the raids being bugged on release.
---
Looks like he got banned. You can see in this clip him phasing out.

Thank fuck just in time for the semis.
---
"Nothing is out of bound"
---
Expect for Sodapoppin in a duel..
---
Especially on the Horde side. 
---
One of the reason I’m rolling Horde is to witness the most saltiest side of the community
---
All BiS lists should strive to be like Taladrils druid spreadsheet.
---
&gt;Gotta love calling someone retarded when they're telling you exactly what happens. That IS how private servers do it. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
It doesn't make it any less annoying that the manchild has nothing better to do with his beta access than spend all fucking day trying to make people misclick/etc in duels.
---
I like it! If I’m  honest with myself, I’m going to get to 60. Will I raid high end content? Nah, probably just casually pvp and run 5 mans. Maybe jump into some MC or ZG runs.
---
Please don't use autism as a slur.
---
For PvP? Sure.
---
Ah yes! Gunforks! I, a city boy, have never trained my pitch fork skill. However I have my gun still capped.
---
Vanilla premade pvp is all about big damage coordinated burst, escorting people etc. Paladins have cleanse and freedom. Cleanse is why horde runs 3 priests (magic dispel for fears etc, magic debuffs, as well as offensive dispel vs shields and free action potion (huge, alliance runs priests for this reason, too, usually on defense because attackers or flag carry of enemy wants to use free action pot).
---
Paladin is run on the offense of ally teams usually because they are nigh immune to cc (blessing of sacrifice on warlock or warrior or something that people tend to attack, stay at a safe distance and the chip damage means you cannot really be cced by many things that would threaten you like a hunter or rogue) as well as fearing plate with a shield, good luck killing that. Only classes that would be able to reach paladins in a proper premade (if teams clash and not random zerg which no one good does anyway) is melee's charging through or flanking, and plate vs melee is great. Bubble is OP. Their weakness is having no real instant on short cd so interrupts are super good v paly but their buffs and auras are ridiculously good.
---
Freedom on warriors with gear (r10+ gear or BWL stuff, especially AQ later on my god) and cleanse spam means they are an unstoppable juggernaut that recks people, they need their team to cc ele/resto shaman or warlock/mage to prevent the warriors from being bursted super hard tho. It's not like the warriors can mindlessly run in but pala healing is solid and mana efficient, breaking a pala frontline is just tough and requires some lucky crits.
---
Palas can also help flag carriers much more than shamans, obviously, or a hunter. Blessing of Kings is arguably the best buff in the game.
---
On paper horde cannot beat alliance, but wow is full of rng and no one is perfect.
---
A big upside of Pala over priest on the offense with dispelling cc is that you get rid of crippling poison and blind vs rogues.
---
Paladin downside is that they are really shit at actually pressuring, they have divine favor shock, decent dmg judgement and that is it. They rely on the team to attack, if you are not fighting but only poking then paladins are weaker.
---
Shamans having windfury totem for warriors is great, purge is great and nature's swiftness is amazing, so is their burst. Their mana just blows and they are less versatile than paladins. Also harder to play I guess.
---
&gt; i'm pretty fucking informed about this topic, otherwise i wouldn't have made that comment...
---
Anyone who makes a comment on anything thinks this about themselves you child.
---
How important is dodge chance for tanking druids? like should i always use dodge trinkets over strenght/stamina or?
---
[Except](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13503/alchemists-stone) that [it is](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18951/evonices-landin-pilla)
---
Oof
---
I think raid/dungeon finder would be good if they require you be at the summoning stone to access it. I believe they did this at one point and it kept people in the area before running something.
---
Just go farm essence of fire in silithus, crusader orbs in EPL. 
---
I farmed essences and it didn't even take me that long to get my 100% ground mount.
---
Feel like playing paladin. Not a hard-core player. Is there a spec I could reasonably use for both pve and PvP content?
---
Yeah, maybe people are assuming you have to play prot to do dungeons while leveling?
---
Which for anyone reading this, please don't. You can tank just fine with arms or fury, tbh you only ever need to respect prot for raiding. Even 5 man dungeons at 60 don't require prot spec.
---
Yeah if they nerf BRD pick pocket farming I'll just stick to my private servers lol.
---
Fucking no changes means no changes, pretty fucking simple imo.
---
&gt; Hell I was making damn near 70 to 100g an hour farming ele earth and solid stone 
---
That's just twisted logic. You're able to make tons of gold from elemental farming **because** there are people willing to pay high prices for it **because** things like tribute runs or lashers are possible and inflate the economy, leaving everybody with more money. If everybody has less gold, then all reagents will sell for less money. 10K pop dynamic respawn PServers have horribly inflated economies. 
---
&gt; The /camp isn't a big deal. Just strip naked and die to get out the instance 
---
Well if it's no big deal then why not fix it ? It's a bug afterall. But to be honest Mara run is pretty long, you cannot autorun it for a big part and you're forced to rez at the instance entrance, not close to the Mara scepter portals, so that'll definitely strongly slow down farmers.
---
Leveled as a resto druid to 60 by auto attack and moonfire spam.
---
sure, ban him for harrassing and ban the streamers for exploiting an area to host a tourny. lulz
---
This problem exists from WoW to Street Fighter to Smash Bros to Mario Kart. Some characters are bad, others good. It's normal in static games like those mentioned.
---
People still aren't asking Nintendo to buff Donkey Kong in Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64, and since Classic WoW is a recreation of an retro game, complaints about balance are *worthless.*
---
Yeah. I'm super on the fence about rolling mage. I love the class, I know a lot about it, especially for classic. But the leveling I find boring and one mage isn't too special from another. You only ever press 2 buttons in a raid: Frostbolt or Fireball and De-Curse.
---
You're talking about a pvp experience, but expecting you to differentiate between the two. yikes..
---
Oh god, someone upload highlights of the tauren!
---
&gt;C. Rules Related to Game Play. Game play is what World of Warcraft is all about, and Blizzard strictly enforces the rules that govern game play. Blizzard considers most conduct to be part of the Game, and not harassment, so player-killing the enemies of your race and/or alliance, including gravestone and/or corpse camping, is considered a part of the Game. Because the Game is a "player vs. player" game, you should always remember to protect yourself in areas where the members of hostile races can attack you, rather than contacting Blizzard's in-game customer service representatives for help when you have been killed by an enemy of your race. 
---
No you cannot.
---
True, but a lot of people also watch streamers for the streamer, not so much the game.
---
I did the grind for the Wintersaber Trainers back in Vanilla, I always had E'ko buffs and Winterspring Firewater to hand out in raids, and also mined Thorium veins when I saw them to get those valuable Arcane Crystals. 
---
When the furbolg camps were camped by Horde (since PvP server), I would ride down to the south part of Winterspring and do the quest involving the elite giants instead (once I unlocked it).
---
My GM leveled multiple alts to 60 from scratch while I did the grind. People in my guild got Grand Marshal during that time. But I got my mount, people said I was crazy for doing it. Winterspring was my second home in Vanilla.

Endgame content is going to be tested.  It has to be.  It's where people will spend most of their time in the game (unless they do introduce a plan to tack on TBC later), so it needs to be tested to make sure things are working properly.  There's not going to be any more of an "edge" to world first races than there is for all the people who played it before, or even just people who watch the videos... or, heck, people who've done dungeons or raids in modern WoW.  Raids in vanilla WoW weren't full of complex mechanics, so realistically, just about anyone who's paid attention while playing instanced content in recent years will be on solid footing, especially given that there'll almost certainly be mods available to help with that (basically Classic brands of DBM and GTFO).  And if people are serious about "world not-so-first races," then they'll be using those mods.
---
Whatever you say ya sperg
---
Surprised to hear so many people backing troll. In my experience, vanilla zerking is extremely negligible.
---
On my first character I didn’t know I had talent points until level 18.
---
Pre-raid bis is different to pvp gear though.
---
How's therapy going?
---
[Check out this list](https://classicdb.ch/?spells=7.11.134#0-2+1). If you mouseover the ability name and it says it uses energy then it's a cat form ability. If rage then it's a bear form ability. Everything else requires that you not be shapeshifted.
---
Holy cow
---
I understand this point of view. However to me what made vanilla wow great was that it wasn’t a fair game. Not just in terms of gold making but class balance, specs, etc. It’s a game that’s rough around the edges and while I wouldn’t say it encourages players to find clever loopholes to get ahead, the fact that you were rewarded for thinking outside the box was a great aspect of the game. 
---
And to clarify my point of view, I’m not so much against removing the instance bug OP mentioned as much as I’m entirely against the notion of nerfing aoe farming content like some private servers are said to have done.
---
Yes, you can. People have gotten banned for excessively camping people on PvP servers.

All, he's been working on them on stream. I think hes started doing alliance starting zones
---
Windfurry &lt;3
---
I really enjoyed his content before the beta started but then started realizing just how little he knows. Same for Swifty which was really surprising but watching him play is often painful.
---
I like pvp so I'm not against the funereal and wedding raids, that stuff is sick. This is just griefing to be an asshole
---
Srs bznz
---
People die faster in nilla
---
All dps press 1-2 buttons in a raid :)
---
then move the tournament to somewhere level 1s won't bother you
---
wanting someone banned because they interrupted your favorite streamer will ruin the game before it even launches
---
Your thoughts were already set on this and were not going to be changed either way, so I don't really care.
---
If you have vanilla collector’s on your blizzard acct, you get the pets in classic. Dunno about the other things, but the neck wasn’t supposed to drop so it shouldn’t be in game.
---
:p
---
Jeeeeeeez, someone is salty as fuck!
---
The man won his duel didn’t he? Seems like he made the right choices.
---
ah perfect, thank you :)
---
So I want to get into raiding in vanilla but I would rather find a guild to raid with as my past experience is just pug raiding. Anybody know any good places to find a guild that's not just spamming general chat.
---
*posts in WoW classic subreddit*
---
*gets upset when people thinking in vanilla wow context*
---
Managed what?  Talents?  Because you won't be managing them this time, since it will only be 1 patch.   There's no experimentation.  Everything will be straight cookiecutter.
---
What's more, everything outside of naxx and C'thun  is totally trivial with 1.12.
---
Sorry but I can’t imagine that guy being a decent person
---
I'm German and I've never seen that death animation before, you don't die like that in CS:GO here. The article says that it was in the Beta version and around that time the news were really advocating against videogames, but right now no one gives a shit.
---
Well they dont Really Block the Tournament. There are enough ways to target totems etc. They are Just Not as good AS they Claim, at least on Classic.
---
And yes, this will Always happen. I mean If they want a real Tournament, they could Just have asked Blizzard. They are Happy to Support :-)
---
No they haven't.
---
Or, it can be no changes and they can not test the endgame content.  I don't think endgame content should ever be tested tbh.
---
I doubt all that many people actively playing bfa will quit properly for classic. The games are very different and there for largely different crowds
---
Playing classic on a pve server is like going bowling and putting the side bumpers up.  Are you bowling?  Yeah sure sorta, but also not really.
---
I hope, i never have to play with someone like you. Disgusting.
---
you are correct, she arguably put her family name on the line for him to train and take the ranger lord test.
---
I have an i7 7700k+GTX 1080+16GB DDR4 and I run a 144hz monitor. Many games can run 1080p at 144fps or better, even if it only reached 120fps you would notice a large difference in quality. In my opinion its worth it to upgrade, just don't go for the 1440p! Fps&gt;higher resoultion.
---
Soda even delted his Report Bug Keybind. / kappa
---
Fat people need to be shamed
---
wow they banned someone for messing with streamers?
---
that is beyond pathetic and this kind of crap will ruin the game before it even launches
---
Do not listen to OP lol. Feral will be great in Vanilla if you're willing to put the effort in to farming consumes, grinding exalted with WSG and AB for the epic items which are legit for tanking until Naxx, and pummelers. Don't forget, you're meant to be flexible. Expect to be DPS'ing, removing poison, or healing depending on the fight and bring the appropriate gear to switch in to.
---
Everquest gets update
---
I get where you're coming from I just don't like the idea of blizzard banning based on twitch events. Especially when this is fixable by doing it in higher level zones.
---
Also I don't think there is anything wrong with people been ass holes. There were people on servers known for been assholes and I just don't see an issue with it especially when this is something that can be fixed by having the event in higher level areas.
---
Guess my opinion is way off rest of the sub but at the very least if Blizzard did ban for something like this I would hope the fact it was on twitch would play no factor in that decision
---
I have work so i need to play casual.
---
That leaves out
---
all healers because I need a class that can farm some gold within time limits
---
Warrior because.. well its not the casual class
---
Warlock. Don’t want the shard farm
---
So that leaves hunter, mage, rogue.
---
Don’t like the rogue playstyle.
---
So hunter or mage.
---
Think mage is the most versatile and all round pick
---
Yeah, I still havent thought about which class I want to play. And Im thinking I might make a mage, warlock and a priest, but if I do it will take forever to level them all.
---
We used this for years in the Wrath/Cata days.  It struck the best balance between long time and newer raiders.  Hopefully the addons for Classic will support it when it launches.
---
Led us to burning crusade. The best wow patch.
---
Please, infect Lagforge with it.... the more dead gnomes, the better =P
---
As far as I'm aware seal twisting was only discovered in TBC so we have no video evidence of it in vanilla. If someone does PM me, we've been on the lookout. Some paladins said it doesn't work on the beta, but it still needs in depth testing to be sure. If anyone has a video/clip of someone testing this I'd appreciate it. Also our discord's in dire need of paladins with beta access &lt;3
---
Ive been playing a Warlock since TBC. I will be dooing both PvE and PvP in classic. I see a lot in this sub talk about Warlock and not getting into raids. I would say im fairly decent at the game, how big of an issue will i face when trying to get into raids?
---
Okay stick to your private server, shut up and enjoy a bottle.
---
Lol rogues don’t fight tooth and nail for raid spots 
---
No one said nerf pickpocketing
---
But ability to exit out and suddenly reappear at start of instance, THAT is not intended, and that’s what makes farming runs so easy
---
Can't go wrong with healing as Holy
---
Level 30 in 6 hours? Unfathomable!
---
*sounds pretty bfa to me*
---
Oh my god thank you.
---
Pretty much every game company does this.
---
There are rules, but pretty much anywhere slapped in their EULA they say you don't own your account and they can revoke it when they want.
---
Companies that operate in the multiplayer space can always (and usually have it somewhere either in the EULA or just company policy) they can ban you for any reason they want.
---
If they feel you are negatively impacting others experiences, they will take action.
---
Trollgodx is a fucking clown and if he actually did lose beta access, that is fucking hilarious.
---
Remember when people said they miss when their actions in WoW mattered? Well, if this ban did happen, I guess he learned his lesson. His actions had consequences. 
---
He's a mega pussy too for hiding on an alt while doing it too.
---
They said PVP, PVE, and RP in the interview. No RP-PVP.
---
I'm sorry...what? This is untrue. Everything I have posted indicates we are looking into it at a later time, and don't want to rush into it to label misinformation.
---
From the [raid post](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292057/classic-wow-raid-loot-tables-on-wowheads-database) I made today:
---
We have received feedback players would like "added in phase" indicators for all loot, as some raid loot was added patches after the raid opened. We will look into that as future development work, but there are still some gray areas like Molten Core loot, documented in this thread with Ion Hazzikostas, and we do not want to mislabel items.
---
From the [filter post](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292058/classic-item-stat-filters-added-to-wowheads-database) made yesterday:
---
We are considering this but based on this conversation with Ion there are still some areas of uncertainty like Molten Core drops. There's no phase info from datamining we can gather.
---
From my [personal](https://twitter.com/perculia/status/1134890837060415488) Twitter:
---
"Since a few people have asked, we're going to try to add 'added in phase' info to the database pages, currently we just need to prioritize filters, search, and talent calc optimizations first!"
---
"We hope to add that in a future update for filters/columns, only so much we can work on at once for a new site!"
---
From the [dungeon drops](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292038/classic-wow-dungeon-loot-tables-on-wowheads-database) post:
---
"We may look into this at a later point, but our current focus is bringing the Classic database up to par with the BFA one (basic drops, filters, search) and then we might look into manually flagging things based on each phase, which first requires the devs to build a system showing what is in each phase."
---
"They'll be staggering when each content is unlocked, and if a launch dungeon got an upgrade in like 1.10, that dungeon drop will be added in P5. If it's something as simple as splitting up bands of IDs into phases, we might be able to do this sooner than expected."
---
This post is a perfect example of somebody coming to a conclusion first, and then doing whatever it takes to have the evidence match their conclusion.
---
A couple months ago this same poster was insisting that it would be impossible for Druids and Fury/Prot to tank because in Classic fights will take way longer than on Private servers Sunder/Faerie Fire/Annihilator are stacking when in Classic he told us that this was not the case. Not only was he completely and utterly wrong on this point about them not stacking, it turns out raid bosses in Classic will have 1,000-2,000 less armor.
---
Now he is saying that the new hit tables, the same hit tables where you have tanks in Battle Stance and Two-Handers tanking level 40 elites (that using their parry formula have a 35% chance to parry) without the healers going below half mana, is somehow evidence that just so happens to prove his point of Druids and Fury/Prot Warriors (don't inform him that Fury/Prot was the only viable MT from patch 1.6-1.10 though because he will just ignore it) being unviable tanks.
---
Should have redone Cdew's QFs against priest.
---
im 22, its possible maybe lol
---
jesus christ your logic is stupid. ofcourse opposing factions are going to ruin other sides events. But same faction two cows just griefing is not even close the same thing. Just stop spewing stupid shit like this. Christ...
---
Let me give you a cue : the word you're looking for is "queue" ;-)
---
How would you have solved it? One person ruining something tens of thousands of people watching?

This event had more viewers than retail pvp matches. Wouldn’t you be annoyed if someone stood in front of a movie you were watching just for fun?
---
You are defending some fucktard who intentionally griefed community made event that was enjoyed by more then 100000 people.  
---
You are equally as dumb
---
Actions have social consequences levied by the community, not by Blizzard.  
---
If you can't fathom that then perhaps you never played Vanilla.
---
What value was Trollgodx gaining by being the asshat that he was?
---
It isnt like he was camping someone in PvP. He was intentionally being a giant, huge asshole ruining everyone's fun.
---
This isn't like he ninja'd an item for his own gain, kept someones mats and blocked them. He was being the worst kind of asshole -- Where he had absolutely nothing to gain from doing it.
---
Source? I've heard it's gonna be 16.
---
Track your calories over a long period of time. I guarantee you dont eat as much as you think you do. If you somehow do eat like 3000-3500 cals a day over months, and you dont gain weight, congratulations you broke science. Or you have a super rare disease.
---
The game design is just better. There are simple things that Vanilla had that retail lacks now, and these are things that make the game feel better as an RPG. Killing a bunch of spiders in a cave in Vanilla is more challenging and engaging than the entire levelling process in retail. Certain decisions they made in the game to make it more casual have completely killed certain things that made vanilla great.   
---
And Im not even a vanilla purist or anything, I just believe that Classic &gt; Current retail in terms of game design. I would probably love playing BFA and Legion if they had the Vanilla game design philosophy.
---
Does the typical pve and PvP healing spec align or are the fine details of most talent choices not that important
---
What faction you planning on rolling?  PvP or PvE? Region?  I'm sure you can find people who will play with you and have fun, part of the fun of vanilla was helping people and the sense of community.  There will be a community, don't worry.
---
I get where you're coming from, I don't think either of us are wrong really. Just different view points and that all G. I guess they should get it "sanctioned" by blizz first so they can "expel the grievers"
---
Depends, but generally, Frost Mages, if they aren't engaged from afar, are one of the toughest matchups for Hunters, and have the strong upper hand. They can very easily stay in a hunter's deadzone with novas and demolish them there, plus they can CC the pet very reliantly with sheep. 
---
However, if the mage doesn't manage to get to the hunter's dead zone or threeshot him in time he'll get mana drained to his loss very fast, and can generally get murdered by big crits from the Hunt from Multishot/Autoshot. You should note though that a Hunter should rarely be jumped on by a Frost Mage in WPvP because of Humanoid tracking.
---
Did they actually ban him or did just log?
---
Ya, but why not both in same tourny?
---
So is the best way to work this out look at all the tiers of your spell and see what it gives Vs trade offs like mana cost cast time  etc.
---
Ok, since Han shot first, and Han's a badass, are you calling the Horde a bunch of badasses?
---
then move the tournament to somewhere a single level 1 can't ruin it?
---
no, you have to demand that player gets banned
---
 Hello Vandrel. You never provided me the source for the spell damage  paladin working better. Did you miss my post, asking for the source?
---
They're listed in the dictionary as a definition for coward?
---
Somethings don't have value.  That's besides the point.  Ninja'ing loot and destroying it has no value but still isn't against the rules.  Should that be bannable?
---
So you'll need to not sit staring at a screen for five hours before you depress on key like you did in Vanilla.
---
how is being a giant huge asshole ruining everyone's fun any different than camping someone in pvp?
---
if you were being camped you'd be demanding they get banned, too
---
I would also like RP-PVP, but I think it might be a possibility that one of the PVP servers gets made into one unofficially.
---
Were pvp-rp servers not in classic?
---
Two people being as persistent as they were don't just log.
---
Yes thats true, pre-raid bis is better than the first tier of pvp gear, while 8/8 transcendence is much better than r13.
---
Legend
---
lol Jesus
---
Is this version of Everquest a project to preserve a game (Classic) that is currently unavaliable?
---
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/42673
---
&gt;**Behaviour**
---
&gt;Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions.
---
Here it is. He was detracting from others' enjoyment and faced the consequences.
---
Well the Event is on the beta, if it would be on live I guess less would have Trolled. Also they could Just asked blizzard. They are Happy to Help.
---
One thing to note is that back in vanilla, the servers would often be unstable after maintenance on Tuesdays. So unless you were chasing server firsts or whatever you generally avoided raiding on Tuesdays. Might be different this time around though, with better servers. Do they still do weekly maint?
---
the community here = a bunch of whiny children who love streamers more than the game
---
Well, clearly you aren't experienced in the multiplayer game realm or even Blizzard. Blizzard has banned people before just for camping someone in PvP before on a PvP server. If they feel it reaches a point where you are ruining others ability to play/enjoyment, they will take action.
---
This isn't exclusive to Blizzard or new for Blizzard.
---
And what area would that have been safe enough where everyone can dual?
---
you can see multiple solid blows in the video not all of them have the blood effect, could just be that the video editing is making it more noticeable (i.e he zooms in on some of them)
---
Seems like the Tauren idiots are gone, so maybe blizzard did intervene
---
Got me like a deer caught in headlights rn
---
The problem is always when a person with some sort of reach spreads said misinformation. If he says something false about spell batching his viewers are going to latch on and say the same thing. 
---
Swifty not knowing jack shit doesn't surprise me. He has never been a good player, just an ad for Razer.
---
There is a huge difference in camping someone in PvP and intentionally just following people around on top of them for hours on end. What he's doing was worse than camping someone. He had literally nothing to gain out of it, and people couldn't stop him. He can be stopped when camping someone.
---
In Vanilla your character is just a random scrub adventurer, I thought my Night Elf Warrior (my first character in Vanilla) looked way more badass than anything because everything he had reflected what he'd been through, and finding that one rare item and showing it off was great.
---
Naaah. In the first 2 phases if you actually consistently bring 1 or 2 good consumables no one will say shit to you. Those who want to go above and beyond can and will, but you won’t be gulping 5+ different consumes every night.
---
I haven’t played retail in years but I imagine all PvE resources online still tend to go overboard with listing every possible minmax option. We all know most guilds, even in retail, are more casual than expecting every detail from every guide strictly followed to a T. Shit, people rarely have the time or energy to enforce that kind of junk.
---
Want to tank, like the sound of blocking
---
Warrior it is
---
yeah, actions like hosting a dueling tournament in a zone that allows a level 1 to ruin it
---
move it somewhere else
---
it's not hard, but i guess it is harder than crying to blizzard
---
streamers have ruined the game and it hasn't even launched yet
---
He's banned tomorrow. Same faction griefing is a bannable offense. 100% since Vanilla if reported. Guess what I did.
---
Why are people upvoting Garbolt?  He uses the phrase "Did you do MC back in the day"  but not only can he not remember the name of the boss, he's wrong about it.  Garr cannot be tranq shot.  The only boss that you can tranq shot in MC is Magmadar.
---
They did, they are in an area you have to exploit into. He simply went there too. He is Horde, anywhere they can go, he can go.
---
This. Could Just be moved, but then people Had PvPed. Aka, Just dont do stupid tournaments in Beta, Just Report Bugs and do it, once the Game is live with Blizzard as Partner.
---
100%, especially on beta they should chat with them to setup events. On live it'd be easier as you could just go to level 60 zones and that'd remove most of it. I guess part of the issue is that it is 100% against the rules to contact Alliance players at level 30 to just guard the event and wipe out anyone who tries to fuck around in actual PVP zones.
---
But ya I think it'd be good at least in beta to have some events like that and honestly it'd be cool to see them on life even though its something that didn't happen in vanilla
---
so now besides trolls on the horde bodyblocking, the alliance can actually attack the people in duels. Great plan
---
Calm down man, it's a well known quote that explains my perspective well, it's not literal
---
They logged back into their mains I’d say :/

---
If he actually got banned and didn't get bored, it's fair.
---
He didn't just mess with streamers. He messed with hundreds of thousands (literally) of players who wanted to watch classic wow pvp gameplay before the actual game comes out in August. Totally understandable why he got banned
---
I'm here with you. I swear I used to jump warrior charges in TBC as well.
---
move the tournament somewhere where a single level 1 can't ruin it
---
it's the streamers fault, not someone who does what the game allows
---
Well said, im with you on that. I see your point, thanks for being cool to talk to. Hope you're Ally so I can hunt ya XD
---
Yeah, but those trade goods are sold to other players. They will be worth less in a young economy since people have little gold to spend at max level for the first few months. Rogues however will farm cold hard cash, and once the economy picks up they will make even more gold.
---
I don’t know who this is or what happened but whenever someone ruins streamers gameplay is a hero in my eyes
---
how bout the area that's literally a stadium built for duel tournies?
---
I mained a hunter in classic, and I'm playing a hunter again on n-dale. Last server I played (k3) I played a lock and I think I enjoyed myself a lot more. When classic comes out, I was planning on playing hunter again because it's fast and I know what quests and dungeons are good for me, but now I think I'm gonna burn myself out and have no idea what to play either. 
---
I'm either gonna play a role that I've never played in vanilla before (healer or tank), an enhance shammy just because, or roll horde hunter or rogue just to change things up enough while still playing classes I'm familiar with. It's a tough choice, I relate to you and op's friend a lot. In fact, I played vanilla, tbc and Cata and I never even reached cap until Cata, and that's only because I got prescribed adderall because I have add. Made it much easier to stick to my choices.
---
Can somebody explain the classic mount system and how it differs to current earliest I played was wotlk
---
lol this is a serious Twink, looking forward to joining you, I did a rogue last time, Im thinking maybe a priest or lock this time for a change of pace
---
I used to be a big fan of the suicide system, but my guild will go with loot council assisted by an open roll system for certain class items (items will be predetermined). 
---
Kinda like both systems, but any successful loot system really need to be tailored to the guild and the people using it.
---
Soda literally watching Tips stream with +70k viewers - what a guy!
---
protect the duelers yourself
---
you have solutions in your hands but clicking report is so much easier
---
Was this in patch 1.12? #NoChanges /s
---
Right, this is the Blizzard catch all.  You could put literally anything into this and consider it against the TOS.  
---
The thing is, Blizzard RARELY acted upon these things in Vanilla.  RARELY.  EXTREMELY rare.
---
Did you mean to quote yourself? No one is keeping their bag full of soulbound epics from MC patch to AQ lmfao.
---
I think this is more of a nod towards PvP twinking.
---
I feel 10-19 WSG is just going to be twink wars more or less as soon as it comes out. Good luck.
---
I doubt. They prob. Just stopped trolling. I mean they didnt Really interupted the Tournament. This "pros" Just Claim their loose is based on Trolls but I doubt. You have enough ways to target totems. It is Just, they are clickers.
---
Not defending the Trolls, but the Pros prob. Are not AS good anymore AS they Claim.
---
While your not wrong about making up the bulk dps, it's tough to find a spot due to the population of the class, especially horde. 
---
Nerfing the ability to exit out instantly I would be okay with, nerfing the actual amount we pick pocket for would be fucked.
---
I am in the same boat, but I know I won’t be able to play WoW long-term if I choose Horde. I’ll make new friends on alliance. Rolling human paladin by the way.
---
2h Fury 8)
---
If I ever get in I will be:) Hopefully cya in game
---
These players are legit wow tournament champions, lol, sure they aren’t any good.
---
Blizzard banned people in Vanilla at times for excessively camping even on a PvP server. Because at some point you are griefing and are out of spirit with the game. PvP isn't about camping someones corpse for 2 hours, so even though "HEY, THEY SIGNED UP FOR IT!" That isn't a defense.
---
Yea I’m familiar. It’s just down right cringey how bent out of shape you people are getting over what is essentially vanilla wow in all its glory.
---
&gt;Right, this is the Blizzard catch all. You could put literally anything into this and consider it against the TOS.
---
Which is the entire point. People who can't stop going "hurhur I'm retarded" to the detriment of others and where there is no way for anyone to stop the behaviour, it should be dealt with by higher powers.
---
This is a great comment 😄
---
This is the real shit. The true metagame of classic is the raid loot metagame. This is why I’m never trying to main fury warrior again. Loot is a nightmare.
---
by that logic get enough zoomers to report someone for stealing their favorite streamers herb node and bye-bye
---
sounds great!    I do worry of being subbed for a paladin or priest.  oh well.  Rejuvenation sounds more interactive than spamming Flash of Light.  
---
Here is my fear: guilds may be formed around friends.  they may give their noob friends the perceived "easiest" job, which may be the healer position.  
---
Say a guild usually disregards their Resto Druid, and has them mainly for their buffs.  
---
\-That makes me feel very replaceable.  more replaceable than any other raid member.
---
Wow, they banned a guy just for trolling some streamers, and the community supports it? No wonder we ended up with retail being so shit.
---
Fucking with people was like half the point of vanilla, maybe you guys don't want vanilla as much ad you think.
---
Talisman of Binding Shard will likely not be in the game as it was removed very shortly after MC was released.
---
The damage values are correct. 1.12 saw huge dungeon nerfs.
---
It was actually possible on launch for a while, and they left in dwarf mages that were already created.
---
You can combine the points in a PvE spec like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgstxMuZx) and a PvE spec like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurtotVMpcMh). They both have the same core points.
---
&gt;you could eliminate almost all faction imbalance by simply making each layer a perfect 50/50 split so that all but the last layer are completely balanced.
---
That doesn't make any sense. Lets say a server can have 10k people and has a A80/H20 split. Lets say it uses 5 layers. They could have 2 layers 50/50 of 1k of each faction each, but then 3 layers would be completely wacked.
---
It's not possible to balance a server with layering. The only servers that could be close to balanced are ones that already are close to balanced outside of layering, which means layering doesnt even need to be used.
---
Spending an entire evening ruining the entertainment of 100.000 people is not vanilla wow in all its glory
---
Not really, no, stop talking bullshit.
---
What the fuck are you on about? We're talking about about a pvp video from 2006
---
I'm banking on release haha
---
 What class ?
---
This is bigger than beta. This Classic beta WoW tournament had over 100,000 views. You want Classic to thrive don't you? You should want more players, especially to try to support incase BC comes out in a few years.
---
Sounds like a great system, but a nightmare to manage.  Hopefully you have a lot of free time. :)
---
Anywhere with some mobs, or just man up and go to gurubashi.
---
shocks me to see this reaction. been happily playing alone for like 6 years in private servers now.
---
I plan on rolling a druid for tanking for my friends in 5mans (getting dungeon set)  but wouldnt you say i have a higher chance of filling a off tank spot in raids over a fury/prot warrior? like i know druids are subject to bigger hits and would never impose on a main tank spot but would there be a place for me in off tank role in the different raids?
---
He was banned.
---
Blizz had a few messages from the streamers and his access was revoked.
---
But there aren't any epic boe rings with a name like that, which is why I suggested it could be stockade as it is a similar name to what he suggested.
---
We're talking about the 258 mana cost of dispel magic on a class with 5.4k mana in pre-bis gear.
---
Thank you for this!!!
---
But why Cry they can not target a totem, while they can? And yes they are Old Champions :-)
---
I will try it out tomorrow in Beta, I am almost certain you can Tab target them.
---
Atatürk Death and Decay?
---
looks like blizzard stepped in and banned them. a win for our gods the streamers. suck dick and cry about it asshole rofl
---
You smash!!!
---
No they didn't.
---
op must be trollgodx
---
didnt get banned, they moved to a different layer.
---
Oh look! Someone else who fails to do their own research and instead looks dumb by posting shit like this that this sub has seen countless times. 
---
Please do your own research and realize that you are wrong.
---
&gt; Is this version of Everquest a project to preserve a game (Classic) that is currently unavaliable?
---
If I'm not mistaken it's an anniversary re-release of the original with solo and progression servers, so yes.
---
A 20 year old, extremely popular game that ran on private servers with a recent version of the game as well.
---
Patches on items, quest bugs, balance and raids that are welcomed by the community.
---
I’d argue you’re really robbing yourself of a lot of the payoff while not getting a very good idea at all about how the class plays practically.
---
Madseason has a great video on picking your first vanilla class based on their perks/limitations which I’d recommend to anyone who is curious how their class will play at 60 while not spoiling it for themselves
---
Jellybeans and Claak get fucked for not being e-famous.
---
rekt
---
Ah, I only ever got to twink a character in TBC.   
---
I remember hating twink Rogues while levelling though, so much that I swore I would never player a rogue. I made my first ever rogue in legion.
---
Yes, you also need to factor in spell coefficients with int and +healing and +element damage +spell power and stuff like that.
---
The two taurens ruined the experience for 100k people...
---
And yet, I still think they did not break the ToS no matter how shitty it was.
---
Should make the ToS for things like this more defined so that decisions like these aren't made with logic, and not feelings.
---
Keep in mind there are plenty of allies so tab-targeting it can target an ally just as well
---
Gotcha, right on.
---
They never banned anyone for pvping ever good try
---
i agree 15 dollars a month is pretty expensive for a video game. its not really a big deal but im suprised at the amount of people on the floor kissing blizzards feet for the oppurtunity to pay them 15 dollars a month
---
So true it hurts.
---
That's what they said about honking the car horn at people in PUBG, until the developer started banning people for it because streamers were saying anyone honking a car horn near them was stream sniping.
---
Keep this entitled streamer shit away, thanks.
---
OP is hated by Blizzard and would never get a beta invite.
---
He was banned already on stream.
---
Blizz had a few messages in regards to his actions.
---
Lol I don't think you understand how annoying it is to have someone trying to bodyblock you in a duel when you're fighting someone.
---
He absolutely caused Seren to miss the tremor totem as he was standing right on it in the moment since that is what he was attempting to do.
---
Warrior , I like the tanking mechanics in classic and the methodical play style. Yourself?
---
Oh I know =)
---
Maybe the 200,000 people were turned in to watch the guy troll?
---
I was gonna ask this same thing. I really wanna try lock this time around, but the way people talk about them makes me feel like I might have trouble finding a raid spot in a decent guild. Will we really be pulling shit dps for half of classic?
---
fuck no, they can go and organize these on pservers like they have done for years.
---
except you can the behavior
---
move the tournament somewhere a single level 1 can't ruin it
---
is the current wow community incapable of solving their own problems they themselves cause through naivety?
---
Viability and fun. Also, sometimes I just want to play a class in a certain period of wows history. I played Warrior back in Vanilla so thats probably going to be the class I dont play, or at least initially dont play.
---
&gt; As a troll myself I commend him on what he did. 
---
i think what you meant to say is "as a social reject myself, i commend him for being a sack of shit."
---
Banning him turns off a lot of people too.
---
"Behaviour that intentionally detracts from others' enjoyment (such as griefing, throwing, feeding, etc.) is unacceptable. We expect our players to treat each other with respect, and promote an enjoyable environment. Acceptable behaviour is determined by player reports and Blizzard's decision, and violating these guidelines will result in account and gameplay restrictions."
---
Yep, just like Blizz did in Vanilla. Do you think no one got banned in Vanilla or something? At some point you are GRIEFING players. 
---
In before "special snowflakes l0l 2019 OmegaLul"
---
😂
---
don't roll on a pvp server carebear
---
They do not disappear. So you can stock up beforehand.
---
You won’t get through to them so don’t bother. Their overlord blizzard told them it’s correct and that’s final.
---
Vanilla WoW was not as hard as a lot of people seem to think it was.  Especially when you came to it from Everquest... EVERYTHING seemed like it was easy mode in WoW from day 1 :)
---
If a guild is failing to progress past a phase it's probably because they are failing to execute the mechanics, there are very few legitimate DPS checks in vanilla WoW and in fact a Ret Paladin can comfortably beat the average DPS required to beat Patchwerk in Naxx so idk. 
---
I agree, there is a very strong bias and people are so concerned about the meters that plenty of mediocre guilds will look at that and make a judgment based on those DPS numbers because they don't know any better.
---
this proved 2 things:
---
1) the modern wow community needs blizzard to solve every problem for them
---
2) streamers ruin games
---
ohh look another ape yelling with 0 proof. There is nothing wrong with damage values, this was already proved multiple times on ELITES AND BOSSES.
---
He made the right choice of picking Horde. The rest is trivial.
---
There will be a horde one first, then an Ally one and lastly at the end of beta a cross-faction duel.
---
That's what they've said at least.
---
- Spent an hour trying to find my friend from school while we were on the phone together, and learned from that day what it meant to be playing on different servers.
---
- Asked a GM if it was okay to be in Hyjal in a ticket WHILE being in Hyjal and got a ban for a day. 
---
- Dinged 40 and were a couple of silver short for my mount, so I sold some of my equipment without having any replacements, because I couldn’t be bothered to farm for 20 minutes I wanted my mount NOW
---
- leveled to 40 in Desolace. So boring.... but at least I knew all the ways to Maraudon. People always got lost so at least I could show them the way 
---
- Used a staff as arms warrior for quite a while because I thought it looked cool.
---
- Didnt know about slower weapons hitting harder so all I would look at to determine what was best would be  superior math from a 12 year old me and the dps it showed on the weapon. Thank god the Whirlwind Axe looked so god damn cool because I was so close to picking the sword.
---
- Heard in school you needed a lot of fire resistance in MC, so in preparation for my very first raid I ran to the auction house and bought all “of fire resistance” greens I could afford and would use them instead of my much much superior blues and an epic. My dmg must have been so hilariously bad. Ignorance is really a bliss.
---
- Got attuned to Onyxia 10 minutes before our first Onyxia raid. Remembering how long that chain quest was and how many different places all over the damn world you had to go, I think it’s fair to call me the god of timing.
---
- Asked two of my friends if they knew where it was good to farm copper and tin because I just picked up blacksmithing and mining, and they both suggested Deadmines. I asked them where these deadmines were and they said Westfall. Now nowhere on the Westfall map does it say Deadmines so I scoured the entirety of Westfall for an entire day until I eventually found the mines only to find out it was a dungeon and I couldn’t solo it. 
---
- I would sometimes roll on downgrades because they looked cool. 
---
- I was a proud user of Vendorstrike. It was epic so it HAD to be better than my Icebarbed Spear. 
---
Damn this just made me overly nostalgic. Can I please be a kid again?
---
What killed OW for me was Blizzards constant need to police the community. Now I see people supporting that for Classic.
---
I understand your evening was ruined.
---
You have to understand that you don’t speak for everyone. You also have to understand that maybe you’re just a bit fucking dramatic.
---
Throwing and Feeding?  What TOS did you find, the fucking League one?
---
No
---
I never hit 60 because this became my main lol, in TBC i got to around 78% unbuffed dodge and could regularly beat players as high as mid 40s. One of the reasons I quit was because they made this character pointless in wotlk.
---
With the excitement of having an enchanted weapon like fiery weapon or crusader, I don't see that happening tbh
---
if they held the tournament in Gurubashi and/or Dire Maul arena then they could just kill the Tauren
---
tournament being ruined by the opposite faction is a risk you have to take IMO
---
So I am very interested in raiding and getting a good experience this time around (I stopped playing wow a while ago) I am wanting a tank warrior and a dps rogue probably combat main talents to avoid debuff problems. Which would be the better idea to lvl first to get into a raid group. Also is it likely that once I get raiding I will I be stuck with one char as my main and the others never touch a raid (I'm prepared for it to happen only picking classes I want to play but it'd be nice to have 2 options for progression raiding)
---
I believe it means Old School Runescaoe. Meaning, they might release more content, but it will stay with the values of classic wow and will be built horizontally. That way new content is playable for people to enjoy, but the old content is still rewarding and doesn't become useless (For example, with retail WoW when a new expansion comes out all the gear and raids and such of the previous are pointless to do now for progression).
---
Thanks sir!
---
&gt;Two problems that this could solve immediately:
---
&gt;Prevent the tournament being ruined by trolls and/or the opposing faction.
---
Help with Fear RNG'ing opponents out of the duel area.
---
It just won't happen though - if things like this get implemented or anything from BFA gets implemented, it's no longer classic.
---
Dealing with trolls was, is and will be a apart of classic.
---
They ruin the fun, that's fun for them. 
---
Just like anyone who will multibox and gank people over and over again - just because they are annoying doesn't mean they get banned. 
---
This kind of feeling or outcry leads to sharding and I rather shit myself and sit in it than have layering for longer than it needs to be.
---
This is what I came to say
---
Where is the proof? ohh wait, it doesn't exist.
---
Basicly you have your mounts in your bag or bank. Just like a potion.
---
they changed layer. I saw trollxgod fade away :(
---
DKP and loot council are both hot garbage.
---
DKP leads to the same bullshit each time: people who need upgrades during progression hoard their fake points for BiS because apparently BiS is the only thing that matters to them. There's nothing better than working for months on a mid-level boss just to watch as their perfectly good upgrades are sharded right in front of your eyes because everyone is saving up for those sweet sweet BiS drops. **If you must join a DKP guild, only join at the beginning of a new tier of content.** Attend every raid or you're effectively fucked.
---
Loot Council means that a handful of Best Friends get all the BiS gear for themselves. Are you one of the Best Friends? No? Well then fuck you. You're just a husk, there to push buttons for the enrichment of the Best Friends. I'll never forget the day that our guild's best warlock and one of the most consistent raiders gquit because the guild's first BiS trinket went to another warlock (the raid leader's girlfriend). If you want to see things like this as well as other similar types of high school quality drama and, join a LC guild. Don't worry, you'll get the loot for sure once the content is on farm. Of course, the guild will "go on break" right around the same time the last BiS trinket drops for the last Best Friend, so good luck with that. **If you must join a LC guild, join one with your Best Friends. Otherwise, don't.**
---
This may not be the way it works for every single guild that uses these systems, but what I have stated above is the rule, not the exception. Be very careful with the guild you choose and make sure they have systems to quash this scummy behavior.
---
what if the hunter knows his dead zone and stays way from it?
---
so will you be demanding blizzard ban people for corpse camping?
---
Wait what? They confirmed the pet thing? I have vanilla collectors and asked this and my thread was shit on saying I was an idiot for thinking I should get my "retail" vanilla collectors pets
---
Please link patch notes if you are going to claim something.
---
You know retail probably peaks at around 200k concurrent players, if not less. 10k concurrent players is quite a lot, especially for a private server with no marketing.  
---
Concurrent peak playerbase is usually around 10% of total monthly players, for most games anyway.
---
Oh shit I had no idea that was even a thing. Is it true you can only unlock them past 40? Also what speed will they be at 60% or 100%
---
Things like kiting a world boss to Stormwind?
---
This is classic, the same way ret paladins can heal dungeons BELOW 60... if you don't like it, don't play.
---
Agreed that was such BS. Not being able to wand a tremor 100% lost him those duels. Cdew's semi vs ven hadn't happened yet either so they totally could have.
---
We could call them....Arena battles and we could make teams of say 2/3/5. Brilliant!
---
First, people are stupidly geared in the beta, a NORMAL level 30 couldn't do this, but a level 30 in the best of the best gear for that level? Easily.
---
Second, the Nostalrius devs literally said they had to just guess values for everything which lead to the game being much harder than it actually was.
---
Please do not mistake your private server knowledge for how the game actually was, because even the private servers devs are saying they were wrong.
---
I don't mind streamers, they brought a lot of life back into the game for me during Legion.  Baj got me into arena and I got my Gladiator title last season with it only being my 2nd season in arena since then end of BC.  It's nice to see other perspectives on the game.  
---
I just don't like it when the community like you said, can't solve their own problems.  When Vanilla comes out I'm going to ninja loot, and camp people, and be the toxic little shit I was when I was 15.  If you want to stop me, just don't invite me or come to my raids.
---
There will likely be a pre load well before August 27th, probably a week or so from launch
---
what you mean to say is he messed with a streamer while they had an audience
---
streamers are a cancer
---
Cdew is the most recent Blizzcon champion lol
---
that's a twitch problem, not a blizzard problem.
---
This thread is useless because not a single person has said what he actually did...
---
You mean it was enjoyed by a few priviliged streamers.
---
We can discuss the degree to which mine or others' evening was ruined and I probably take more offense to this stuff than most. But im pretty sure the majority of viewers felt negatively impacted so my point still stands
---
Lol that would be the absolute best.
---
So excited to see layering in classic for months since pop won't drop like they think it will.
---
I honestly am curious as to how people like that taurens minds work. Like who actively wants to just be a nuisance to everyone. I honestly feel sorry for those people, prbly lonely.
---
Does you brain fathom the slight difference between honking a car and griefing a tournament for few hours straight?  
---
How is it entitled? Is expecting people being decent entitlement?
---
I find it interesting that most the people in this thread saying what you're saying are posting in The Donald.
---
Getting ganked and ganking in STV is the true vanilla experience. Can't miss out on that shit.
---
Should someone get banned for standing on a fishing lure?
---
Me, except I only get to level cap with 1 character- my "main" who will never actually do anything unless I get *more* bored of alt hopping
---
I can't help you if you don't remember Vanilla. Look for the changes yourself.
---
They're perfect for commenting real-time things like sports, events, and in today's political climate, congressional hearings on CSPAN  but not useful for anything else
---
Sorry, I'll sum it up for you.
---
There was a very largely watched Twitch dueling tournament on the beta and two Tauren, Trollgodx and Trollgody, attended and jumped around and spammed /sit on the duelers while dueling.
---
It caused widespread anger and hatred for the two.
---
He’s also likely rocking the best gear possible for his level and the GY is a very easy dungeon.
---
extra stomp?
---
You're completely lost right now dude, try to get it through your head that I was commenting on something that was happening in the PvP video.
---
And FYI it's better to spend 258 mana dispelling HoTs that heal 2k HP than it is to cast two spells that cost 800 mana to deal 1500 damage.
---
Basic fucking maths.
---
&gt;78% unbuffed dodge and could regularly beat players as high as mid 40s. One of the reasons I quit was because they made this character pointless in wotl
---
Yea my brother and I were also seriously annoyed about the removal of twinks from regular pvp, I get why they did it, for newer players etc but at the same time, it killed alot of fun in the game. 
---
I loved it because it was fast and easy to get one that was half decent, you could play it as almost a minigame away from your main when you had down time or no other commitments. It also made for great guilds of people who wanted to go out blow off some steam and brutally murder some level 14's. 
---
Hopefully the que times when BG's do launch wont be too bad, and we can all have some overgeared fun once again.
---
Hello "trollgodx"
---
Not how this works. You made the claim burden of proof is on you.
---
I’ve been through the patch notes tons. There were no nerds to leveling dungeons in vanilla.
---
Gurubashi? Are you fucking high? The trolls would just run into the ring and not abide by the rules and then it's just be a giant World PvP situation, which isnt the point of a DUELING TOURNAMENT.
---
That troll wouldve done the same in PvE? Thats the issue? It was a idiot from the same faction, nothing fun about that at all.
---
I remember back in vanilla I used to not only snipe/tag mobs and troll people being a hunter by being faster and able to reach nodes and use my pet to distract mobs while I gathered but I used to talk shit and curse people out really bad back then... I mean it was clear that first year maybe year and half they Blizzard did nothing for trolling or being abusive to people.
---
Times have changed....
---
At level 40 you get your 60% mount and at lvl 60 you get your epic mount which is 100%. The catch is that you got to save money while leveling to be able to afford your mount at lvl 40. It’s not uncommon for people to be several levels past 40 before they have enough gold to buy there mount. Same goes for your epic mounts. You probably won’t have enough gold when you first ding 60 and it will take time to grind enough gold to get your epic mount
---
Stone skin is a decent I win button vs rogues and warriors
---
I don't have anything to prove to you. Blizzard has said over and over that the damage values are correct. Get over it.
---
My only issue with raising the cap is they raise it from 30-40. You open up quests and such to do, mount purchasing and all that, no problem. Once people get to 40 in a couple days, what then? People will run around and do dungeons at 40. Then eventually they run around and have fun at 40. And then they ask to raise it to 50. Do the same thing. Then they ask to raise it to 60. Then do the same thing. At this point, they've essentially played the whole game minus raids. Blizzard may want people to yearn for more, get to only 30 or 40, wipe all the data, and start over, instead of people who have multiple 30s, spend their time getting all the way to 60, learn the game isn't what they want it to be or expected it to be at 60, and then stop playing before the game is even released.
---
I think they're trying to keep people testing stuff, but also be interested to play the game once it releases and not have people spend so much time leveling up and testing stuff in the beta that they don't want to play the game on release because they already did it and don't want to do it again.
---
That's just my opinion though.
---
??? How do you stop same faction people? You can’t kill them, you can’t move them...
---
Would have to flag for PvP and there would be sooo much griefing.
---
I liked the tournament and despite frustrations and having to move, deal with trolls, falling off cliffs.. I'd never want to change any of it. That's what we're signing up for and I love it.
---
You'd still get suspension for being overly abusive in chat.  At least back then it wasn't automated.
---
I knew about the grinding and predicted it to be much worse than my time in wotlk. Strange question but what are the scourge invasions?
---
Yea let’s dual in an arena that makes people inside attachable by everyone. Good idea.
---
Classic is basically free, we’re getting it bundled with the full game.
---
I’m not saying they aren’t I’m saying dungeons weren’t merged which is what you are saying.
---
The ease is from other changes. Not dungeon nerfs.
---
You unlock the first mount in level 40, its a 60% mount. But its gonna cost you a wooping 100 golds. Which is a lot in classic. You get 100% in level 60, and that one cost 1000g.
---
Troll for pve and undead for pvp. Makes sense.
---
Most raids run 3 warlocks minimum for the curses, that's a great baseline number for a class since for others that number is 0. Obviously you'd want at least 1 of all classes for the tier rewards but you get what I'm talking about.
---
Blizzard have banned people for way less.
---
But don't you know they have picture perfect memory of exactly how much damage every single mob did 15 years ago? Clearly it's Blizzard who is wrong
---
he had it in the third duel but didn't use it because of the rng fear.
---
you move the tournament somewhere not safe for a level 1
---
let the spectators protect the dueling area
---
Just like how the Super Bowl is only enjoyed by the players, lol
---
See this is worries me a little bit. I’m very hyped for classic because so many of my real life and online friends are going to play. I’ve been playing this game on and off since release and now I find leveling extremely tedious and boring, and whenever I think about classic it’s all about what cool stuff I’ll be doing at level 60. I’m just scared I’ll burnout because the leveling is so slow and I don’t find it enjoyable :(
---
Literally you are questioning something that Blizzard has said is right and has been done in patch 1.12 before. 
---
The burden of proof is on you because you are the minority here.
---
I'm talking about megaservers, like five populations on a whole stack of layers. With a system like that, you could pretty much guarantee that there isn't going to be a huge imbalance.
---
Or he is extremely active
---
How is standing around even doing anything?
---
It doesn't even interfere with the duel, and it is even less game-changing than honking a horn.
---
And, yet we see the tauren banned on video for standing around.
---
GG Bliz, keep this up and it will harm classic.
---
If I was camping someone for 2 straight hours to where they couldn't play the game, I wouldn't be shocked to get banned and I'd say based on the behavior statement they have, I wouldn't argue against a ban.
---
I played in Vanilla as well, and I always felt it was an unspoken rule that you sort of stop camping people after around 5 deaths because I knew people who received temporary bans for excessively camping (griefing) people for hours.
---
Yes, they do. It's a great class for healing in both pvp &amp; pve and you get to choose how many points you want to spend in holy.
---
There is some fine tweaking depending on your raid (Lasting Judgement if you're on judgement duty, or which buffs to take depending on your other Paladins), but if you're not minmaxing then it doesn't matter too much. Generally speaking, if you spend atleast 21 points in holy (Illumation &amp; Divine Favor), you're good to go, so you can spend the rest in prot for tankiness in PvP, 5-man tanking and Blessing of Sanctuary for your raid, or you can put more into holy for more healing power and mana efficiency, making you more valuable for raids and premade pvp.
---
I’m not questioning anything other than his claim that dungeons were nerfed.
---
Damage values are correct. Dungeons weren’t nerfed. That is all.
---
Sure, tell where? To contested zone so some
---
Idiot from other faction can grief?
---
Wasting gold at the auction house while I was leveling and having to earn a ton more to buy my first mount.
---
That's the answer I was looking for.
---
By extremely, you mean at a collegiate athlete level, right? Regular exercise doesn’t burn all that many calories.
---
Makes sense to me :D in almost every fight a warrior is better. Not sure why your making everyone mad :D
---
would the super bowl be held in a grass field where anyone could just walk up and ruin it?
---
no it would be protected and in an area not accessible by a level 1
---
the answers are there the community just wants blizzard to do everything for them
---
I quit the right at TBC when I saw a Tauren Paladin running around at XR. Just logged right out and said F it.
---
They half us in the lie, had first not gonna.
---
People are used to pservers, where trumpets and incels rule late-night worldchat
---
damn, the classic wow keyboard warriors rolling out
---
I'm choosing to replicate my exact vanilla experience from back in the day, so picking the same class was easy.
---
MEN gachiBASS
---
Vanilla prot =/= TBC prot ... Many things are different
---
I was also on Dunemaul during vanilla! I actually participated in one of the big scenes in Burning Steppes. Gonna have a look and see if I can spot myself.
---
Im done to 4 classes!
---
TBC was my favourite personally, but I loved vanilla too.   
---
But to me there are things I love about a lot of the expansions, for instance a lot of people who love Vanilla seem to hate Cata, but there are aspects of Cata I liked.   
---
For me the thing I want out of Wow Classic is not the authentic vanilla experience, its the superior game design philosophy.
---
You can do both PvE and PvP with the same talent spec as Holy, you just change your equipment. For healing you're good as long as you have 30 points in Holy and lots of +healing gear. Then you just decide if you want extra survivability (Prot) or do some burst damage and have an easier time farming (Ret) with the rest of your points. 
---
Personally, I plan to go Holy/Ret at the start when I'll be doing a lot of farming, then maybe switch to Holy/Prot when they release Battlegrounds
---
In what world is this giant asshole being removed from being an asshole going to turn people off? Especially compared to the overwhelming majority that was so fucking annoyed with the guy?
---
How? What is the solution? Move to contested territory and get ganked by Alliance?
---
Fucking Desolace no doubt
---
i hope the layer thing is actually what happened and blizzard didn't actually ban them
---
Your first sentence contradicts the rest of your post.
---
A mana burned druid can't cast HoTs. Its more mana efficient to oom a druid then dispell. That's basic fucking maths.
---
based trollgod triggers fools itt
---
Can you tell me what server you're on so I can camp you 
---
Hit me up with a remind me 86 days so I know, ty bro
---
Good warrior tanks were hard to come by from what I saw, they could not AoE tank and most could not hold aggro.... 
---
Back during Vanilla there was handful of bear druids that were amazing tanks and hands down out performed the warrior tanks.
---
If I recall, one them had insane armor and dodge and like 16k health and built threat like crazy...
---
Going to be really cool to see how things play out come August ;)
---
why can't the spectators defend the area?
---
Did the very same thing with my paladin.
---
I can relate to this. I went from shaman to hunter to warlock to pally, to priest.
---
Thought I had really settled on warlock at one point, but now it's all up in the air again.
---
I wanted to either go pet class or healer. I think I've settled on healer, but I still don't know what I want to do exactly. Not sure if I wanna go with the familiar, or something new. I guess time will tell.
---
I'll probably make one of each and level them all to 10 or 15  or whatever and play whatever I'm having the most fun with at the time. That's kinda where I'm at right now lol
---
Classic had its own way of making your gear obsolete and forcing you to get special sets for raiding.  MC had fire resist, AQ40 has nature resist requirements.
---
????
---
You want the spectators to protect the dueling area, but then that allows the level 1s to also be safe. These guys are only level 30 dude.
---
Hi, /u/adsgolly
---
I used to tank dungeons with a 2her back in the day in leveling greens. Idk if I could handle four mobs at once but I guarantee you that if I had the same gear he does I could've done it no problem.
---
I'm just fine waiting on a private server.
---
Horde warrior is a bit easier than alliance warrior due to pally competition. 
---
Alliance hunter is a bit easier than horde hunter due to shaman competition. 
---
Pick the class you like the most and roll with it, except Rey pally and Oomkin. Everything else can find a niche.
---
Agree with /u/strangequark18 here
---
Deadmines was WAY easier for asmon’s group than on pservers or pre-nerf Vanilla
---
Stopping to drink every 2 pulls should have been a reality
---
They were basically chainpulling and not stopping
---
yep
---
Isn't their main issue different servers and regions? Perplexity and whatnot will be EU, let alone individual servers. So something like that would have to be cross server since it'll be dead on a lot of servers, not to mention regions. Seems like quite a big thing to implement
---
Last server I was in, our priest officer had 3 bags full of soulbound epics before AQ.
---
Yes it does happen.
---
You don't even need to skill up enchant to be able to disenchant everything in vanilla. Anyone with a free profession slot will do.
---
"Are you retarded" is completely uncalled for.
---
Private servers got it wrong
---
yeah really, yeah, since the report system is automated
---
For someone that doesn’t watch any streamers ever, what happened?
---
Just admit you didn't understand what this discussion was about so that we can move on instead of trying to change the subject.
---
I dont see an issue with it. Might be controversial but I honestly dont care about upholding a perfect replica of vanilla, I just care about the game design philosophy. For instance I think the fact that class balance is really bad is a detriment to the game rather than a feature, but Im still interested in Classic despite things like that. Im sure many people really want that 'authentic' experience but personally that doesnt matter to me, and I think it wont matter to everyone. I really doubt blizzard will start changing things though, they seem pretty dead set on keeping it 'authentic'.
---
I'm really sad and ashamed to admit it, but there was times I was really bad and cussed people and said some mean stuff when someone set me off and triggered me... and I never once got any emails or was suspended.
---
Not an issue. Alliance Warlocks in particular are rare and always needed.
---
If you read a lot of forum posts, you might see people talk about the meta and how Warlocks are bring less DPS than Mages, Rogues and Warriors. That is true. What they don't tell you is that Mages, Rogues and Warriors are the most-played classes in the game. Good Warlocks are much harder to find than good Mages.
---
Vanilla WoW is a role-playing game. Warlocks do things that only Warlocks can do and they wear tier pieces that only Warlocks can wear. They are still necessary in spite of their lower damage compared to other classes.
---
Ah i misunderstood what the Big Mac Index was. I though it was a way to simplify prices of other stuff (like 3 big macs for a month of wow) when speaking to people from other countries. Which would not have worked.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
Don't forget that it's one of the most experienced vanilla players also using iron grenades.
---

I hope you realize that comments like this make these types of people really happy
---
Oh it better be there, that was iconic
---
It wasn’t always as easy as it was at the very end, is the point of the image. It wasn’t one static difficulty from 2004-2007
---
are you unable to read?
---
move the tournament to an area NOT safe for a level 1, you know, so they can't "ruin" your favorite streamers "community event"
---
if you are worried about mobs or other players, then let the audience defend the area
---
You can compare to the first guild wars
---
I played both heavily at the time, and wow has considerably more to do
---
They can play BFA.
---
It's not the players requesting changes. It's Blizzard's current philosophy that's harmful. Two entirely different things.
---
Hey buddy. If the audience defends the area, guess who is safe to ruin it?
---
Quin69 was watching all the duels, just check his stream to see each duel one after another as he kept up with it.
---
And you can see what going on with the two tauren's trolling the duelist.
---
[Compiled List](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10VX4klI8ZbqQKIce7r7UZ6ItIpM5lft0/view) in a [Reddit Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7tmn92/what_was_so_significant_about_patches_14_and_112/dte75jd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) by u/jpedrote52.
---
The dude is almost 30 and saying stuff like this. It's actually quite sad.
---
Those two taurens were asmongold and mcconnell
---
I’d rather die than watch Quin’s stream sorry
---
Better players don’t take extra damage or waste mana.
---
Protect it from your own faction? Do you guys not get how WoW works?
---
venruki won.
---
3-1 finals against snutz.
---
It was asmongold and mcconnell
---
Oh God, the replies. Yeah tanking with 2 warriors is not the best strat, but I definitely remember guilds did it. The first raiding guild I was in broke up on Twin Emps but having 2 warrior tanks was not the biggest problem.
---
Bad for the game
---
You can’t tab target the opposite faction unless you’re already flagged and they appear red.
---
What happens when one of those people does run onto the field? They stop the game, remove them, AND BAN THEM FOR LIFE. Moron
---
he was running on top of the duelers in the tournament today
---
How much hp/mana would a geared hunter have?
---
I mean, you're a Frost Mage, you're only frostbolting anyways. Might as well mix it up and have rank 1 set to 1, rank 2 to 2, max rank to 3..
---
if that many people want to ruin the event, then maybe re-think holding the event?
---
You don't get to pick and choose if you're arguing for authenticity. Either go for progressive class changes or not.
---
I personally don't want to deal with a classes that's going to change over time and bend the meta every time a new phase rolls out. It's tedious and confusing to most.
---
Walking through the Burning Steppes at level 10? Fun times.
---
Or perhaps they're remembering doing dungeons before patch 1.12? You know, the patch that we're launching with? The patch with wildly different talents, spells, itemization, and numbers compared to the launch of the game?
---
This is great. For someone without beta access, it's especially nice to hear that some things are getting fixed.
---
I don't know if I'm more surprised that Blizzard would get this wrong or by all of the people defending it. This is not how it was. Period. They've got this wrong.
---
They said the numbers are right. He’s questioning a claim that dungeons were needed across the board with zero proof. Whomever is making the wild claim is the one to provide proof, otherwise they are talking out of their ass. That’s his point.
---
Then credit to your priest for sacrificing all his bag space for months to get minimal gain.
---
It's totally called for, everyday there are dumb misinformed posts like these. It's a complete non-issue.
---
if the only thing preventing all the people at the tournament from ruining the tournament was the zone rules preventing combat completely then they didn't really want to do a tournament
---
This is literally a post about that.
---
Some geek was running over the top of duelers for 5 hours today trying to get them to misclick/block things.
---
You have some patience.
---
Lol what a nightmare!
---
Did you even read the patch notes yourself? There were no "huge dungeon nerfs" in 1.12.
---
Because most of the top guilds favor horde that’s the only reason. As former top world guild who played alliance we where right up there with the horde and only raided twice a week on prog. One farm. U will see the same again come classic release horde will dominate all aspects. Only because it’s the favoured race not because of racials that are slightly more op.
---
His name is Bone? I have a friend we call Bone, that I got to know bc wow 😮
---
Part of classic WoW. Like when the funeral got raided.
---
With a random green chest piece? Seems like the pre-TBC PvP epics.
---
I used to think the lich king was a slime because the page in that manual that talks about the lich king had a picture of a slime on it.  I never played wc3 so I had no idea.
---
streamers and their audience got upset someone interrupted their streamer's community event
---
typical streamer cancer
---
He was griefing a community made tournament that gathered over 100k viewers, he probably got banned for harassing.
---
Shouldnt ban people maybe just put them in a ingame cell for an hour or two lolol
---
Lol you kinda listed 3 of the best classes in pvp ;)
---
Its mostly pretty simple data entry. Shouldnt take more than half an hour each raid night too update
---
Tauren couldn't be paladins until 4.0.3, so uh, that's not true.
---
Not in PvP, mate.
---
Damn I remember when a Big Mac was $2 
---
I feel old
---
No they didn’t.
---
Why does everyone complaining about this shit come off like some facebook boomer birther lol
---
He 100% has had his access revoked.
---
You will not see proof because outcomes of reports are not given.
---
Just running on top of them is fine but annoying. However, they also covered Tremor Totems as their Tauren model, so that changed some outcomes of duels.
---
I think it’s a little unfair people care so much about what’s viable and what’s not when in reality PvE content is so simple and easy by today’s standards that everything is practically viable.
---
Will you be doing the same dmg as a mage or rogue? Nope at least not until later tiers, but the bosses are still going to die regardless. You could probably clear MC with 30 ret palas in the raid without too much issue.
---
Theres tons of stuff like this. ZG enchants for example. If they release ZG with the first version of enchants pristine black diamonds are worth a lot. If they release them with the second version of the enchants they aren't worth anything at all.
---
As a tank warrior I feel like I have a great deal of choice in talents, I’ll be experimenting all the time. Different phases/raids/encounters call for different builds. I was sure of my build for months but I went back and looked yesterday and had 3 or 4 other ideas about where to take it.
---
I started by working out what I intend to do at max level. I don't have the time/inclination/work pattern to allow me to commit to serious raiding, so my endgame is PvP. I enjoyed the hell out of AV, so my mindset is towards playing something useful in large group PvP.
---
At this point, I'm trying to decide my faction. Alliance are seen as being favoured in AV, so should I roll ally and try and get more wins? Do I try to find a group of Horde willing to commit to playing AV and try to beat pugs through organisation. I need more info from the Beta/Reddit to determine how good AV queue times are for the Horde, or rather how bad they are for the Alliance.
---
That's probably priority number one. After that, there are other factors in regard to my faction choice. WotF and stun resistance for Undead and Orcs are amazing PvP racials, do I want to play an ally priest or a lock where my fears are getting wasted and my blackout procs resisted? Then there are also concerns in regard to getting gear. Do I want to play shadow priest or boomkin and make it even more difficult to join a pug?
---
I think I'm left with four choices, and which faction I play will have a lot to do with what I end up playing.
---
Boomkin - Probably my first choice if this was TBC, but it's not. I've watched some videos and hell, it looks pretty fun landing huge crits, but how viable is it to cast a lot as balance in AV? Do I tank strat for long enough to get some decent gear and then switch full time to balance?
---
Affliction Warlock - I like the dot and tap playstyle, the survivability, forsaken warlock is pretty cool.
---
Shadow Priest - played it previously and enjoyed it, but will I have mana issues in big group battles? The toolkit is awesome and mind control is hilarious. Then there's the question of which race, everybody says dwarf for fear ward, but I think I might enjoy having shadowmeld. Standing at the top of a tower and mind-controlling a defender off the edge - pretty fun.
---
Mage - I've played mage before, and the teleports would be great, but the best part would be unlimited food/drink. Being able to regen without worrying about cost would be great. I'm concerned about being squishy though, do I want to spend my time being worried about getting two shotted by rogues?
---
Maybe these are questions you've been asking yourself, and at least part of me thinks I'll be happy playing anything. You can always reroll if you really need to.
---
Blizzard never banned anyone for PVP. Corpse camping is literally in their EULA as an allowable action.
---
Social consequences for a level 1 throwaway griefer char.
---
*headshake*
---
You sound like you're just as much a piece of shit as him. Probably was you, judging by your 4chan edgelord nonsense.
---
Weapon damage depends on melee attack power and melee crit, so by extension Seal of Command scales with those things too.
---
hes our hero, seeing soda mad because of him was priceless lmfao
---
Uh I don't think any of them have just 1 for their damage except mage.
---
Hahah so now it’s the streamers fault for scheduling it bad?
---
The dungeon loot tables are still empty or incomplete as well as a lot of other info. I was looking stuff up a couple days ago and gave up trying to navigate that poorly constructed Classic section and went back to a pserver database.
---
They might not be perfect but at least they're intact...
---
But my friend what about the 2 for $5 deal?
---
'As a troll myself'
---
Cringe, dude
---
Horde Paladin I remember. It was over 10 years ago
---
pretty sure the funeral raid was pvp, no? I think that is the qualifier
---
Not nearly as annoying Orc rogues for any rogues
---
some idiot with no brain cells that was griefing, still has more brain cells then people who want him banned
---
Elemental shmaan and hunter is amazing in pvp. 
---
How time consuming it is depends so heavy on the server, when  you rank and stuff like that. It's really impossible to tell because ranking depends on how much honor you get compared to your own faction, so if your own faction is a bunch of european welfare no lifers you are gonna have a hard time, but if your faction only plays a couple hours per day then you should have a good time.
---
Mage, im a ret pally on retail but don't wanna go ally tbh
---
lmao, it has nothing to do with "overlord Blizzard".
---
these groups have been level-locked at 30 for 3 weeks now. they've been literally farming and doing quests to abuse certain quests giving them gear that is far beyond the power level of 30, for instance, the axe the Warrior is using is basically equivalent to a level 40 axe.
---
if this was a normal level 30 group of random dudes, it would look much different.
---
They have a 1.12 reference client, it's the exact same as it was back in 2006. It uses the exact same database that they used back in 2006. Videos online from that period confirm the damage is on point.  
---
What exactly is there to argue against ? Of course people are defending it, you're acting like flat earthers, but unironically.
---
If you want to save on server transfer cost it can happen. Also 1 of each class on each faction. Also twinks, especially 19 twinks are very easy to make.
---
All the people standing a foot away from the dulers annoyed the shit out of me.
---
class doesn't matter that much for getting a high rank, if its the same way it was in classic all that will matter is how much time you're willing to put into it. Since you're not going for 14 It will probably still be a lot of time but not life-shattering amounts.
---
I remember this from wotlk as well. Only because i tried convincing my mom either cod or cs (cant recall) should be ok for me to play since wow also had blood in it and then zooming in as i was killing a bird in the barrens
---
Horde wasn't the meta faction until TBC and beyond. Alliance is 100% the meta faction in Classic. You will not have an issue finding competitive groups as Alliance.
---
It's like that on the beta, yes. But, was it like that in Vanilla as well?
---
I’m my guilds MT, I’m picking a warrior. Done. I want to pvp aswell so I’m picking orc.
---
Bunch of streamers organized and advertised a dueling tournament. Bunch of people showed up and some of them tried to interfere with the duels. Blizzard banned two of them.
---
Rogue I’d say, maybe hunter or warrior
---
People who would rather control their own circumstances and take accountability for their own actions than cede those powers to powerful entities do tend to vote conservative.
---
That was one exciting tournament to watch...these guys are skilled.
---
Reading some of these, I think some of you were just victims of being 12-16 😄
---
Lmfao tru
---
Your idea literally makes the problem worse. This is a dueling tournament, not alliance vs horde world PvP. 
---
It is not a duel if you are being hit by someone besides who you are fighting. Which is what would happen in Gurubashi.
---
Nah bro i think youre in the minority there
---
Streamers kiting bosses to their own cities griefing their own faction, or bug abusing under a city in front of 120k people, its all good! 
---
A tauren jumping over people dueling in an unlicensed tournament, Holy shit we gotta ban this guy! 
---
I mean come on, who the fuck cares. Good on the steamers that put this all together but they wanted attention and people watching, the could have just had it off steam if they didn't want alliance or other people there. They each made thousands and chose to stream it, get a grip they'll get over it.
---
This hardly represents most of, including the most difficult, bosses in the game. 
---
They don't bring those specs for MC because that means attempting to gear them up despite shitty itemization and then being forced to continue bringing them for future content.
---
agreed. ToS needs to be more defined, because that was not really griefing no matter how shitty that was from the taurens.
---
 110k+ watchers and great action from all players   
---
The final was Mage vs Lock  
---
This was so much fun to watch  
---
Blizz take note
---
*all time is defined as this week
---
you can get R10 just fine with random ques but you are going to need to actually play and be in a premade for the 12-13
---
Ahhhhh sweet #showtooltip how I have missed you!
---
dude is a literal god, he literally pulled out everything to win that
---
http://oi56.tinypic.com/1112cn4.jpg
---
that match up, watching the strat and counter strat was on another level.  so much fun to watch.
---
Someone spending their beta access using it to grief.
---
Attention seeking on the Classic Duel Tournament streams, which had 100k+ viewers.
---
So 10 people are upset compared the 100k people celebrating that this asswipe is no longer ruining the duels
---
Hmm, wonder what side Blizzard should support..
---
Those were some sick duels at the end. Venruki truly deserved that win imo.
---
Skill and class don't matter for getting rank. The only thing that matters is time investment. The exact time investment required scales with how much time other players are spending so its hard to give an estimate.
---
&gt; First, people are stupidly geared in the beta, a NORMAL level 30 couldn't do this, but a level 30 in the best of the best gear for that level? Easily.
---
yeah, i dunno why people don't get this. if this was a normal Warrior leveling to 30, he'd have a random mix of gear between 15 to 30, he wouldn't have a WW axe and he'd probably have 25-30% less health.
---
people are freaking out because of people min/maxing a level 30 beta for the past 3 weeks that have gear they shouldn't have.
---
My first MMO, I figured I’d play a paladin because I didn’t want to get killed by monsters. Mind you most classes don’t regularly die grinding standard zone/quest mobs. I figured “why would anyone pass on having a heal?” Nobody told me mages could conjure their own food and water.
---
Yes, Blizzard unfortunately bet on the wrong horse and only kept doubling down each expansion.
---
It would be amazing to see an MMO actually do expansions in a different way.
---
at one time Soda had 114k+ ppl :D
---
The dungeon tables were incomplete at beta launch, because it requires people to upload data via the Wowhead Client, after running the dungeon. It's not something which can be acquired through datamining.
---
The Client was up and running fairly quickly, but as the level cap hasn't increased beyond 30, some dungeons can't be run at all. So as a temporary solution the content team manually added dungeon drops (no droprates) to all dungeon pages: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=292038/classic-wow-dungeon-loot-tables-on-wowheads-database
---
Today we made a similar post about raid and world bosses.
---
Some no-life fuck that spent hours grieving the duel tournament today. What a waste of organs.
---
How do you play private servers nowadays? Still have to swap game files in the WoW folder?
---
venruki did a great job kiting him and staying away from the windfury
---
News flash: not everything makes it into patch notes.
---
Oh the money for sure.
---
A GM alone can hardly handle leading 40 man raids alone; there are so many more than 40 to manage in the guild overall.  
---
It got a lot more reasonable to be done solo when raids were toned down to 25 and the composition meta was more easily understood.
---
And the start of balancing classes around really small scale pvp and whiney arena players
---
Also took a lot of character progression out of BGs and WPVP and forced arenas on any PvP player, especially due to resilience
---
Honestly I way prefer classic’s system, even if I’ll never touch the high ranks
---
Exactly.
---
I hated the interference of the taurens as much as everyone else, but you need to define ToS better, otherwise asmon and everyone else should get a ban as well. 
---
Banning people over emotions and not rules &amp; logic should never be allowed, it has bad ripple effects.
---
Interesting, but not surprising
---
Mage was my strong second, they look really fun in PvP. I can't get off work until 3 weeks after release (apparently a wedding and maternity leave is more important then classic who knew) but hope to AoE grind level as a mage around that point assuming I've got my warrior ding'd by then:P
---
Dominating wsg is where it starts, for me the most fun was wpvp out near deadmines and redrock. Or everyone getting their crappy mains to win the arena trinket. Really excited that some of my old 19 guild will be playing classic!
---
You're missing the point. I'm saying that these specs are useless EVEN if they had infinite mana.
---
I need heart medicine
---
Of course mage wins
---
Hunter.
---
Soda leaked that they were already planning to move. The battle started after that. Alliance won and the respected the wishes on the duelers to stay back.
---
You have a sad way of deriving pleasure, mate.
---
This video shows a great comparison between beta and original 1.12. We want blood!
---
https://youtu.be/OU3ZGIf0S6c
---
Incorrect.  If you are in a non-contested area that YOUR faction controls, then you can tab-target the opposing faction, while they cannot tab-target you unless you flag yourself first.
---
UMAD bruh?  UMAD?  
---
Yeah, UMAD.
---
That is the visual effect of rend and deep wounds.
---
That was an insane duel. Venruki fully admitted he thought Snutz was going to wipe the floor with him, but he pulled out some insane plays. The guy had so much adrenaline pumping through him that he was on the floor panting after the tourney ended lol.
---
Dunno if you noticed but you mispelled "else".
---
Cool poster, fits my friend a little too well :p
---
Use this 
---
www.wowclassicbis.com
---
I really like large parts of your idea, but I'm on the side with people who just don't believe that people would be motivated to run a raid more than once unless it increased the power of my character (in any arbitrary domain).
---
And your idea doesn't seem to address this issue?
---
Maybe you prefer horizontal progression (I still haven't seen an example of that, that I thought might be able to motivate people to do the content)? Or do you have any suggestions for why people would do ulduar if the gear is on the same power lvl as e.g. BWL?
---
too much care about streamers.
---
Total control of the fight, damage at any range. They’re just a nightmare.
---
Venruki is a good dude and fun to watch. I'm glad he pulled out the win.
---
If you've ever watched that Serenity Now video and thought the comments they pulled from the whiners seems a bit meek and ridiculous then please be mortified that you're doing the exact same thing here.
---
Warrior presses the most buttons, sword rogue close second. Hunters press about 3 (well timed)buttons per 10 seconds, mages/warlock spam their scrollwheel for spamming the same ability.
---
Any evidence for 1.12 dungeon nerfs beyond "muh feelins" or "muh memriez"?
---
And a 100% of it getting briefed
---
Or just 1v1 duels, ha ur so clever
---
Lawyared.
---
Rank 1 and Max rank, yes. Rank 1 for the 1.5s casted slow is a lot easier to pull off than a 2.5s Frostbolt.
---
Can't say about everyone, but I'm making about 900% more. 
---
Now, in the state I live in minimum wage has gone up to 10$ this year, and I believe it was around 5$ when wow came out.
---
So pretty good gains here yeah?
---
I can tell you I personally knew 3 people who got temporary bans for griefing in the form of excessive camping. I can tell you I got banned for something not in the EULA either - Doing the Cash on Delivery mail scam in Warlords.
---
Blizzard is at their own discretion to determine what griefing is, and you can get banned for excessively camping people to the point where they cant play after multiple hours.
---
&gt;Blizz take note
---
Idk, I think what makes it special is that its player driven content. I'm not sure I'd be as interested otherwise. My favorite thing about the level 30 cap is that there is no where to progress to, so players have to make up fun shit to do.
---
Was really cool to watch!
---
not at the start, im not sure when they were added
---
Such a sad life lol
---
It’s been widely discussed. I’m not the only one that remembers it.
---
Thanks for the link. Didn't realise the drama I would cause by just asking how.
---
Genuinely didn't know it was possible with a warrior tank.
---
So awesome to see people enjoying classic. We thought we did, and we did.
---
Rogues easily.  There is virtually no real downtime.
---
Maybe in two years. If they decide to give classic the OSRS treatment I suspect we'll see a paladin hard taunt and a druid OOC res. 
---
Do I want to see major changes? No.
---
Lol go through the list and tell me which dungeons on there are leveling dungeons?
---
Uldaman is the lowest dungeon on the list.
---
Aww cuz the jumped around during peoples duel? Your right they should be banned for life
---
Fury warrior / rogue
---
Nope. “I know some guys that knows some guys” doesn’t count. Bring up a Blue Post or stfu.
---
Maybe you could provide some evidence for your claims?
---
But i know why you dont, because the damage in the beta is correct and there is no evidence to back it up, even if someone showed a side by side comparison you wouldnt believe it because you are a person who solely operates on feels before actual evidence.
---
Here are two videos, one from vanilla and one from beta, both characters have the same amount of armor and take the same amount of damage.
---
Vanilla: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSq2yWz0a4s
---
Beta: https://youtu.be/ZrOIf_Ntkh8?t=2438
---
they already had it planned before this (asmongold).
---
You can definitely 2 man them, solo might be a little hard going though. It is a great way to make money though, I use to two man brd and DM (war/pally). 
---
Bonus cash if one of you have enchanting/mining as you can DE the blues and mine the rich thorium veins in DM north (I think its DM north, the one with the tunnel after then end boss)
---
Venruki reppin’ Canada well. Atta be Ven!
---
I'd love to see a source on that, if you don't mind.
---
Haha you did the Scam? But yeah I saw also people got banned, but only for 1 day. Btw Check Chat :D
---
Ven was absolutely incredible. I watched his perspective and that was crazy to watch. Insane.
---
Maybe I'm blind but there's virtually nothing there that applies to any of the dungeons currently being run in the beta.
---
mcconnell's alt
---
Venruki is so wholesome I'm so happy he won. That reaction is priceless. I've never seen a more grateful streamer in general.
---
There is already one organized with asmon and esfand
---
Makes it more awesome that this was all player created content  
---
Classic's not out yet but this is very positive
---
You can tank pretty much every dungeon up to BRD with a 2H as a Warrior in Vanilla.
---
I don't see your point. I had a sword and shield for some fights while leveling but mostly tanked 1-60 in Arms with a 2h.
---
I walked away after the first match cuz , it was close, but seemed snutz would finish the next two (nothing against venruki he's a fucking legend, this proves it, warlock just rarely loses to mage) 
---
Awesome to see ven win! He's my fav wow streamer 
---
What a fucking beast, he obviously still is one of the best players in the world... Of Warcraft xD
---
how about you leet pvp'ers protect the area then?
---
Sounds like his name fits, got to give him that.
---
I know i want to wield a giant fuck off 2h weapon. So classes with that option + fun and oneshot potential.
---
Make one of each and level them all a few levels at a time til they're all maxed. Ezpz
---
No. The players organized the tourney just fine. We don't need Blizz to muck up something else.
---
What you say is correct and what I understand the numbers are authentic, but man, 70 damage taken from lvl 30 elites on a warrior without shield and def stance AND using death wish, that's low, that's really low... The positive thing is that I can EASY tank on my shaman while leveling.
---
Crazy Sodapoppin would have won if they allowed reduel when getting feared out of bounds. They did it later in the tournament but not for him. He shoulda won
---
I imagine 15 paladins bubble hearthing to avoid losing
---
The only "balancing" I would be okay with, is if there was something unintended or game-breaking that needed to be fixed.
---
They suspend them like any other group that's tried to disrupt WoW.
---
 If you want a ranged class with minimal downtime between abilities, then I think hunter might be your best fit.  
---
Melee would likely be rogue; you are either building up or spending combo points constantly.
---
Well I also saw people got banned from Stranglethorn ganking for a day or 12 hours Not 💯 Sure.
---
Yeah I was watching his stream during his duels vs Snutz. Seems like a really genuine guy
---
Wow. Mage 1v1 Warlock is a tough fucking thing. Venrukis is a true animal and master pilot of toons.
---
The only leveling dungeons in that list that recieved a nerf was uldaman and ZF, so not really relevant for the dungeons being ran in beta. the max level dungeons recieved some proper nerfs but that was in response to reducing the cap first from 40 to 10 man, and then to 5 man.
---
He's just a scummy kid. Stop posting about him makes him feel proud of himself and want to do it more I bet
---
The three amigos top 3 finish was great.   
---
love watching all three of them, super talented guys.
---
So you're solely speaking off of 15 year old memories. Good to know.
---
It's free, lol
---
Lol no, it was definitely griefing so enjoy the ban.
---
No you’re not that’s all the changes to dungeons in vanilla. Huge nerfs right?
---
I like the RP aspect of being a dude in big plate armor with a huge shield :)  so being on horde, warrior was an easy pick!
---
It pretty much takes the same as R14 except a month shorter. You have be among the top like 1% honor earners in order to make meaningful progress at that point. If you get in the top bracket every week, it'll take about two months to hit R13. If you can't make the top bracket every week, the time to rank up grows longer. If you aren't pretty high up, you make no progress or even lose rank.
---
The actual amount of honor and hours per day will depend entirely on the server. If there's a lot of people tryharding, it'll take a lot. You shouldn't expect to get there with anything under ~50 hours per week, and on some servers it'll take more than that. There could also be unforeseen factors in Classic that people aren't used to, so it's hard to say anything for certain.
---
In my experience, it's just precisely doable with a full-time job or university if you spend no time on anything else. Just sleep, work, grind honor. You can do something like 6 hours per weekday and 12-16 on the weekens, though it may take a few weeks longer since you're unlikely to get really high standing that way.
---
At one point the WoW section was pushing 200k views. actually nuts.
---
well it looks like he got his beta access revoked so...
---
It wasn't 1.12. that saw the dungeon changes. It was a patch or two before it when the talents were balanced better for level 60s (because vast majority of players were 60)
---
When they did that they nerfed the leveling dungeons a bit to balance it because the talents shifted from benefiting leveling to benefiting end game raiding.
---
&gt;While your not wrong about making up the bulk dps, it's tough to find a spot due to the population of the class, especially horde.  
---
&gt;Nerfing the ability to exit out instantly I would be okay with, nerfing the actual amount we pick pocket for would be fucked. I guess we're on the same page :b
---
Which private servers? iirc didn't I read somewhere that some of them announced plans to shut down once classic launches?
---
Briefly
---
They did allow Sodapoppin a reduel. The score was 1-1 when he got feared out. They replayed the duel.
---
The problem is he used his Whelp 1 hour cooldown and dash trying to win the game he got feared out of bounds that he was unable to win without cd's.
---
Random comment but I play PoE and Quin used to stream it and I always thought he was annoying.
---
But in this tournament it was awesome watching Quin's stream. Out of everyone he had the best commentary and knew a surprising amount. Very entertaining.
---
They never said this.  They only ever mentioned that the automation wont be quite as strict as it is on current retail.
---
Rangchu played Panda in the Tekken world championship and won.  Pandad was considred one of, if not the worst characters in the game.
---
Just because something isn't meta, does not mean it isn't fun or viable in some way.
---
If your healer heals well and dps nukes things quick, there's very little you need to worry about. Many fights I've done in dungeons on pservers the tank is dual-wielding and I'm healing and it's not really bad even early on when people have crappy gear in max level dungeons.
---
We didn’t see a single Core Hound Tooth drop until we’d cleared BWL. Drove me insane.
---
They also have lists of undocumented changes in most sites that have the old wow patches.
---
Enjoy the ban.
---
especially after monkeynews and his friends crashed the horde one. Asmongold and esfand are going to throw a shit fit, but tit for tit i guess
---
If you're not familiar with something then don't bring it up as a point in an argument... like wtf...
---
Nameplate range is a hardcoded value until at least TBC, possibly further.
---
Is this whelpling that strong?
---
They did reduel when he got feared out. Idk where you saw that.
---
So I haven't heard how its going to work n I'm wondering if you know.  So my understanding is that throughout every single phase of wow classic there wont be any updates to class balance.  So at the start we'll have MC then after a while BWL.  If there's no balance changes I guess how will each of those raids compare to classic and to private servers?  Is it possible the metas from back in the day won't work due to individual class strength differences?
---
Basic timeline:
---
2004: WoW launches with the weapon skill system  
---
2007: TBC launches, weapon skill system remains unchanged  
---
2008: WotLK launches and weapon skill system removed midway through expansion  
---
2019: Classic beta launches using data from the final version of vanilla, patch 1.12.1 dated September 26th 2006
---
It's extremely unlikely that Classic has this wrong because this is a server-side restriction and Blizzard would have had to go into the server code and changed a specific section of the code that handles weapon skill training with the specific intent of removing the level restriction but otherwise leaving the system intact.
---
This kind of change doesn't happen accidentally which you'll see by reasoning your way through this.
---
imagine crying because you aren't part of the fun. The streamers just put on a tourny that 100k people watched and enjoyed. Stop being a salty shit stick
---
Never said they were, I was linking changes and specified those from 1.12.
---
Never played WoW but have really enjoyed watching Ven and Ziqo play the beta, they both had some clutch duels today. Makes me want to play a mage on release!
---
There isn't. I was linking changes and specified those from 1.12.
---
What're you talking about? He did reduel after getting feared out. The problem is he used most of his big CDs on the duel he got out of bounds. Either way, it was part of the rules for that exact scenario.
---
Went 8 weeks of MC without a single rogue item drop. Rogues ended up with an insane amount of DKP that when a new rogue joined the guild he left when he saw how much dkp everyone already had.
---
No they don’t.
---
One of the most famous videos of Vanilla WoW were people who crashed an in-game funeral for a real player who died. 
---
If you don't want to deal with that bullshit you do what I'm going to do: you play PVP. If you do play on a PVP server you'd best go Horde because there will be a legion of undead rogues who only rolled that class to make sure that every gnome they find ragequits.
---
Then it's not worth $15, is it?  Retail is worth $15, and classic alone is worth nothing?
---
Blizzard should make tournament realms later in Classic, that'd be so cool to watch.
---
For the HORDE!!!
---
And the warstomps on cd.
---
Dude you don't even know how dumb I got while trying to figure out what to main. I don't want to top any meters, I don't want to be the most OP class for pvp, the things I'm looking for are: little to no downtime while pulling 1 or 2 mobs at a time at max level while farming solo for rep/gold/etc. There are certain things that makes the decision harder for me, I'll show you where I am at right now as I created a short list with all the classes and listed why or why not I'd like to go with them:
---
DRUID - shapeshifting aint for me, only really need 1 (or very few) in a competitive pve environment...
---
HUNTER - pet/ammo system puts me off kinda, not very sought after, deadzone
---
MAGE - squishy, loads of downtime, not my playstyle really
---
PALADIN - very little to none combat interaction, don't feel like healing with this, healing is 2 buttons, farming is 1(+2-3) depending on if it's an Undead/Demon or not AND mana can be an issue so downtime...
---
PRIEST - downtime...(?)
---
ROGUE - too overpopulated - not easy to get in groups, while undergeared it sucks,  weak for solo farming, downtime...
---
SHAMAN - FOR THE ALLIANCE
---
WARLOCK - I like this class the most but having tried it on a private server with mostly pre bis gear I'm not sure about little to no downtime with this class.
---
WARRIOR - most guilds are set on tanks, weak solo, downtime...
---
So as you can see my biggest pet peeve is downtime. Is there actually any class that will not have too much downtime while farming solo and pulling a single mob or maybe 2 at a time? I feel like druid and hunter will definitely not be chosen for the stated reasons (mostly cause of shapeshifting and deadzone for hunter and I heard they are not very sought after classes).
---
Guess I have \~2.5 months to make my decision lol...
---
The funeral was cross faction. There was actually a way to prevent that. Can’t do anything with same faction. 
---
Nice try though.
---
https://youtu.be/WWYa4nZPSy4?t=528
---
I do not think you know what an argument is.
---
and abusing it will result in a ToS break. you're being dumb
---
What about boomkin?
---
He really killed it. Absolute fantastic play and planning, he executed the perfect strats for everything Snutz threw at him. Great play by both players.
---
He was banned so... it is bannable.
---
I don't believe that even if the head of Blizzard says it themself.
---
There would be no reason not to include an RP-PvP especially if they are going to do an RP server.
---
That just forces an entire community of players to play on a PvE server. It makes absolutely zero sense.
---
He has so much gear he might as well be around lvl 42. Normally there is no way for a player to gather all that gear and not outgrow it.
---
Yea i mean i'm gonna see what friends i make while playing.  It's not a 100% definite that I'm gonna start raiding again.  Might just play for fun.
---
I wonder thou if blizz kept the loot system that have in retail for classic how people would react to that.  Probably would be a huge negative response... at least I would think.
---
If Blizzard said no, they certainly have a reason. Maybe RP-PVP servers didn’t have enough historical population for Blizzard to consider them. Maybe they just don’t care.
---
The OP is different.
---
You log out in the instance, someone else resets it. You log back in, and your char location is invalid because the instance is gone.  The servers will put you at your last location prior to loading that zone, which would be right at the portal.
---
I want to say this is not vanilla like, as typically when the server could not locate your position, you were put at world origin (0,0,0) which was in the sky above alterac mountains.
---
I’m going to have to ask you to trust me on this one...
---
All I will say is that Blizzard contacts asked for information in forms of screenshots/proof and then 10-15 mins later he phased out. 
---
I can’t post any proof without blowing up where it went down :(
---
Alot of the playerbase have no idea. So i dont mind getting it back.
---
Exactly!
---
Agreed  
---
Expect even more Mages in Classic
---
This isn’t about someone using game mechanics to stop a thing from happening. This was a lvl 1 grieving a community event. This isn’t like the funeral crash, this was just dumb. It’s not like he’s banned he just had his beta access revoked and probably temporarily
---
True! It’s always easy to find groups if you are a good tank or healer!
---
There was nothing that could have been done to stop Trollgodx. You cannot do it in a contested zone, as even being hit once by a driveby fire blast has now ruined the duel even if you kill the guy. And they will keep coming.
---
There would be much more Trollgodx's out there and in a way that would force duels to be restarted constantly if it was a contested zone.
---
I kinda like the fact this was player created content
---
was it actually tho or are these just memes im gonna assume the latter
---
Watching Ziqo stall for a combined half hour was some riveting gameplay.
---
5 hours? Holy shit that’s some grade A no life dedication
---
Eh... I loved playing warrior, but your farming options are extremely limited.  Anything that requires that much AoE is not going to be very effective.  Your best bet is just farming felcloth rather than farming instance resets for the most part.  
---
Although, I remember a lot of warriors doing the mara resets though, due to having BWL gear or better can let you easily solo the goblin boss and the croc with relative ease.
---
No it won’t be isolate it’s a planned attack. They will get a temp ban like what happens now in live
---
My process is, "Yes."
---
You sort of contradicted yourself there.
---
Ok, seriously dude. I'm seeing you all over this thread talking so much nonsense bullshit. Why can't you make your point without false dichotomies and absurd hyperbole? Are you too stupid for a real argument grounded in reality?
---
Venruki tab targeted to an alliance mid duel with cdew. Its still possible
---
Watching cdew stomp out that serendipity guy was also amazing lol and getting the third place against claak was dope. Them straight savage wind fury procs
---
nice bait
---
At one point our main tank would pull out his 2 hander for MC boss fights just for shits and giggles. We were way over geared for MC, but those legendaries sure are pretty.
---
Well Just move Tournament to a unknown place and do Far Sight, it Had unlimited Range and could be recasted No?
---
I was doing the Hunter class quest to get my Rhok'Delar and some rando lowbie that was just questing through thought I was in trouble and "helped" me without realizing that it would cause me to fail the event.
---
my ears
---
You guys realize that its just the spergs right? Your faction doesn't actually say anything about your personality and these idiots reside on both factions...we all realize this right?...right?
---
I'm not so sure that is entirely true. Soda had around 50k views in the beginning of the tournament but as it picked up speed a lot more people tuned in. Think he ended up around 114k at the heat of it?
---
That seems to indicate people are interested in the streamer doing interesting things in the GAME. 
---
I think the personality does a lot but the in game events are more important to keep the viewers attention.
---
Or maybe... just maybe... the dungeons are easier because of all the other changes in the game that “buffed” the classes. Like talent changes, weapon normalization. 
---
Nah... couldn’t be that had to be dungeon nerfs.
---
No they have not. You're talking out of your ass.
---
You can't be banned for anything you've listed above aside from actual messaging or texting harrassment/rude things.
---
All the jackass player has to say is that they enjoy frustrating people and it's part of their class fantasy to be a rude asshole.
---
Nothing about being a dick is against the T&amp;S agreement.
---
I seriously doubt it'd be as much as they'd lose.
---
Venruki is the Hero of Classic Beta
---
Watch the vod. At one point both of the trolls get phased out at the same time.
---
So you're not even going to take my ban into account? I was banned for something that would simply only fall under the broad "griefing" term.
---
My scam got me banned and I lost the gold I got from it.
---
Blizzard has taken action even if your action does not say it will get you a ban in the EULA. The EULA is not a bible, which is the whole fucking point. Everything is a case by case basis.
---
 I know because that's how I got banned.
---
Fuck trollgodx and trollgody
---
Druid will hit a wall at twin emps, very liable to get one shotted or feared
---
Still, he doesn't have a shield, doesn't use def stance AND have death wish active and are taking 70 damage from lvl 30 elites...
---
what about enemy totems?
---
i know you're upset but this all boils down to you being a fan of the streamer and if they had a bad time it means you had a bad time :(
---
Its a meme
---
where i can find the bracket/results?
---
you're retarded, if someone charges the field they get removed and banned. This example you gives defeats your point
---
Not sure how I feel about consumables in duels.  
---
I suppose it was mentioned as allowed in the rules before hand though.
---
Take note of what? Cmon dude it was only fun to watch because of streamers, nothing to do with Classic.
---
They do automatically upgrade for classes like Rogue where the cost doesn't increase. If the cost changes the skill won't auto upgrade.
---
Was just a totem on the ground not grouped with it.
---
That definitely came after classic
---
I'm mainly going to solo World pvp with 8/8 DS.
---
news flash, this isnt vanilla
---
That doesn’t mean they got banned, they could’ve been layered, logged out, Ddos’d, etc.
---
I find it extremely unlikely they got banned for it.
---
Agreed. I made it to rank 11 just my mainlining AV for three/four weeks. Could have gone higher but it is boring when you're doing a full 9-5 jobs worth of PvP. Got the epic mount and quit.
---
"unknown place" doesn't work as well as you think. People can easily find their way to them by /who their zone and theres always someone who knows all the secret spots
---
I also remember decked out 60s camping the questgivers and flightmasters in crossroads, or being camped by some bored players while trying to quest in contested areas. People didn't get banned for ruining someone else's fun in vanilla, it was usually language or exploiting broken aspects, vanilla was merciless.
---
The raid leader doesn't lead the raid alone, far from it. He just calls the shots and is the unified voice. Most management is usually done by class leaders that report to the RL. 
---
Whether the GM is the RL or not doesn't really make a big difference, since the GM is usually in the raid and not managing other things at that time. 
---
GMs are as a rule raid leaders, the exception being usually if they don't like raid leading or being in the spotlight, or don't have time for the preparation that goes into it with tactics, etc.
---
You should hit that mage up
---
Woah I'm not talking about new spell. I'd like to see a little more armor on raid boss so 3/4 of the raid is not melee. Changes to items so you don't get the best item in slot at level 40.
---
I think a lot of the content creators are genuinely happy about classic wow because it was a era of harder games
---
Both games are Skinner Boxes through-and-through. Classic is just tuned better to your preferences, Modern is tuned better to others'.
---
How does pvp solve same faction greifing? 
---
The funeral could have been stopped with pvp. This could not have been stopped at all unless with GM support.
---
Umm??? I'm not Trollgodx?
---
Go home peasant.
---
Hitting max was so awesome. I hit max level at the end of wotlk and for the first time I got epics through the tournament heroic dungeon. Just getting all that epic gear felt so unreal after all the years I spent playing. 
---
It's a shame I won't feel the same way about any game ever as I did with classic wow. Not even going back and playing classic today, since I'm pretty sure being a stupid kid with a wild imagination had a lot to do with my classic experience back then...
---
It didnt get crashed tho. The final was already moving so it turned into WPvP before the alliance then came and lined up nicely to watch
---
Gosh this is so amazing. The Nickelodeon logo made me lose it
---
Jelly loses against Venruki by tab targetting a stealth rogue and Scattershotting a non-participant losing the duel.. even recognized by Tips, but oh well no-redo.
---
Cdrew gets feared out of bounds by a Priest (Claak) 2x for 3rd place match and should be down 2 via the ruleset, but has those 2 matches wiped... was he supposed to stay in Tremor range and just take hits? He played like he should and was punished.
---
Yeah. During phase 3 of the plague we ran a scourge train from Orgrimmar to Darnassus. 
---
Turns out that Horde and Alliance got a common language when they were undead! Those people in Astraanar were not happy.
---
a streamer community even is not comparable to huge sanctioned event like the super bowl
---
if blizzard had put on the tournament, it would be comparable
---
but they didn't, and it's not, so i'm sorry your streamer got upset
---
Yea, what he did was scummy but he shouldn’t be banned for it. He should have the freedom to play how he wants. If that is being an idiot and trolling, then so be it. The freedom to play how you want is what classic was all about. 
---
Also I hate streamers so I hope they constantly get griefed six ways to Sunday.
---
-Never used any add-ons (Still managed to MT raids)
---
-Equipped all the BoE Blues and Epics I got while leveling/fresh 60 (dumbass)
---
-Just taking FOREVER to level my Warrior. Explored a lot and had fun but looking back it took me MONTHS to hit 60. Some friends had 2x 60s by the time I dinged.
---
What other modifiers can you use?
---
And yet conservatives want laws to restrict the autonomy of women, to govern sexuality and gender, to legislatively prioritize certain religions over others, silence the press, continue to instate laws that give freedom only to the very, very rich while limiting the poor, are lapdogs of the couple of people who are actively denying a healthy planet for future people hence restricting their autonomy, actively excluding people from entering this country based on race and religion, burden the poor with the tax load, restrict access to healthcare and food, allow companies to put restrictions on an open internet.
---
I guess you can mislead yourself into thinking conservatives are for "independence" when you exclusively are talking about the rich and for guns.
---
NA Horde player looking for a semi-hardcore guild.
---
Prefer a guild that's lighthearted and joke about serious stuff without people getting upset over stupid stuff. DKP/Loot Council(If fair).
---
Intended classes would be Hunter, Warrior(prot/fury) and Shaman. PST/CST times. Msg me here or to inquire for discord info for more information on my raiding background or guild history.
---
Wrath of the Lich King 2.0, finishing all of the stuff they wanted to add but couldnt. Just change storm peaks so flying isnt a requirement and you're golden.
---
Then we can have the troll raid and the underground nerubian raid instead of naxx.
---
Go remake the video. Duel a shaman, try it then. Maybe leave out the part where you tell people to kill themselves.
---
I'm a fan of the positiveness and enjoyment the event brought. It was fun to watch, I laughed and cheered while watching a bunch of the different people showing the duels. 
---
You however, are just being a negative piece of shit. You have no friends here and no one agrees with your ridiculous comments. I don't accept your sorry, and suggest you just delete your Reddit account and go spend your time elsewhere.
---
🤔
---
Hello Setup, this is from Nostalrius. Please make it clear in your post that this is from a private server.
---
because why would you pay for a server people wont use
---
With discussions with Esfand, stay safe and tipsout. They are quoted on saying this.
---
He says "I'm gettin a bike!" right after this haha wholesome dude glad he won.
---
pretty sure it was just a layer change
---
sorry to ruin your "justice" boner
---
So take note of using the streamers more for advertisement
---
Cdew was my favorite part this tournaments them windfury procs that deal like 70% of peoples total health were hilarious.
---
Trollgodx and Trollgody the true MVPs of the tournament
---
It autoattacks hard but is squishy.
---
Thing is that having the enemy wasting swing timers and/or mana on it as well as maybe taking a hit or two makes a HUGE difference in that one duel
---
Damn salt is real
---
My streamer? Most people and viewers were annoyed. Might be why everyone is telling you you’re wrong
---
The tournament today was better than any arena tournament I've ever watched. The closest would be when Cdew won blizzcon.
---
I would co-star so hard in this.
---
May be a way to do it in Classic considering how congested the Zones will be. 
---
Especially then you get to 30+ you can start mob grinding elementals for Elemental Fire and Earth's and make A LOT of money while leveling.
---
Basically you're doing what you'd be doing at 60 but just at 30 while gaining xp.
---
True. GM Island :D
---
But Classic will be nothing like Vanilla...  It will be far far easier with the 1.12 skills and talents.  There will also be like 10 warriors in every raid.  You want #nochanges, so that it mirrors vanilla, but you are really changing things drastically with the stagnant 1.12 patch.
---
One less rando idiot. Good riddance...
---
We are going to have one a couple weeks before release.  If 2 weeks isn't enough time, then some of those people may not care all that much to begin with.
---
But you are still friendly to it,The whole point of a target totem macro is to actually target the opponent's, if it cant do that then its not working.
---
You do not take durability loss if a player kills you. The majority of mid to high level zones are called "contested zones" . These are zones where players who are "flagged" for pvp can fight each other whenever they want. On a pvp server, the second you enter that zone, the game flags you for pvp. On a pve server, you have to manually flag yourself. This can be done by either turning it on in your settings or aiding a fellow faction member currently engaging in pvp. (I'm unsure if the game allows you to attack the opposing faction if you are not flagged yourself, I've never actually played on a PvE server).
---
I salute you sir
---
Top 1% isnt rank 12
---
why is soda so popular? he is a whiney baby and nothing special
---
 1.12.1 have been played for so long you could say it's broken.
---
I quick explanation on the pvp rank system:
---
You have x points, starting at 0 when you make your character.
---
Each rank has a range of points associated with it.  So to be rank 12 you need to be between a and b points.  To be rank 13 you need to be between b and c points.  To be rank 14 you need to be above c points.
---
At the end of each week, you gain points based on your position within your faction.  Eg, the number 1 horde player earns the most points, the 2nd player gets a bit less ... the 100th player gets a lot less than the 1st player.
---
At the end of each week you lose points based on your current rank.  A rank 12 player will lose far more points than a rank 7 player.
---
Therefore, as you get into the higher ranks you need to earn more points just to offset the amount that you will lose.  To get to rank 12 you need to place fairly high amongst your faction just to stay level / not lose points.
---
Imo, if you cannot consistently be in the top 10 players of your faction then I would not aim for rank 13.  Therefore, you need to be in a dedicated pvp group.
---
Oh, and do not take a week off until after you have reached your desired rank.
---
Check out the addon "pfQuest". I had a lot of issues with Questie including thise you mentioned.
---
I don't have nearly as much (if any) with pfQuest. Also it's designed way smoother imo. Check it out.
---
An absolute dogshit player and no-life piece of shit. really pisses me off seeing these clips. It's fucking nonstop, what a god damn loser.
---
Anyone got a link to the whole tournament? Or perhaps just a clip of the win?
---
Can't be nochanges and then ask for changes.
---
Most players who played vanilla, did so post dungeon nerfs.  
---
Keep this in mind... the nerfs happened when they stopped letting people take 10 people into 5 man dungeons.  The dungeons were always simple, because either people were abusing the raid function constantly, or it was post nerf.
---
Is there a VOD of this somewhere?
---
depends on the class. Abilites that cost rage or energy always cost the same regardless of rank and therefore they update automatically and you can't downrank them because they don't even show up in your spellbook.
---
Nothing needs to be implemented. 
---
When you advertize as much as this did and being streamers your bound to be griefed
---
Whether or not this type of trolling would've had action taken on them 15 years ago is irrelevant. We live in an ENTIRELY different time period. The Blizzard we have now is nothing like that old Blizzard and the playerbase is just as different. Trying to crusade against everyone involved in this game in an attempt to force them to emulate 2004 behaviors is a fool's errand.
---
From a business &amp; PR perspective, it wouldn't make any sense for Blizzard to NOT take action on these individuals whose main goal was to ruin an event which was being watched live by hundreds of thousands of people. No one with any common sense can honestly say Blizzard would be in the wrong for taking action on trolls who were blatantly griefing for nearly 5 hours.
---
Let me in... LET ME IIIIIIIN!!
---
Honestly I loved my main Warrior but some of the fondest memories of WoW I have was playing a Paladin to 44. Never got past that before TBC but just leveling was filled with a fun time.
---
A lot. They farm gear for raids that aren't out yet, farm materials for the war effort, farm equipment that gets updated in later patches (though this won't be a problem in classic), ect.
---
Tanking is without question the most difficult role to find a raid spot for. You need to level that first if that is something you want to do at end game, as it will increase your odds greatly of putting yourself in the mix before guilds solidify their tanks. There are no guarantees even if you do get fully geared for it. It's the reality of the situation, sadly.
---
Sounds like you want to play a Warlock. They scale very well, are extremely useful and don't have much down time because of pets/life tap.
---
What? He didn’t get banned.    He may have had his beta access revoked and blizzard has the right to revoke anyone’s beta access.    They aren’t stopping him from playing classic when it comes out
---
Venruki is unreal. What a god.
---
Ha
---
Except vast majority of players in Classic will be completely new to vanilla.
---
Spent all my money at the AH. Never had the level 40 mount.
---
? I use it in retail all the time.
---
Cant bubble hearth at level 30
---
Blizzard please never let him in
---
Warriors don't even bother to spec prot on private servers.
---
It happened when they stopped letting 10 people into 5 man dungeons.  At every step of vanilla's existence, dungeons were easy for one reason or another... people just choose to forget this fact.  
---
Remember when strat/scholo was run with 10 people and required no cc?  I do, and it was pathetically simple.  
---
It also didn't happen near the end of vanilla.. it happened just before the half way point.
---
venruki was flagged mid duel and literally 0 alliance attacked him while he did 3 duels in a row until the flag fell
---
Well, that too, though.
---
I think they should stick to as little changes as possible for now. Maybe after the phases are done or after a phase or 2 they could *maybe* try balancing. However, if they did, they **MUST** have servers specifically that will never be changed. That way players can decide if they want to risk blizzard screwing things up or want to have it true to the old.
---
I'd still prefer T1 then for higher burst damage.
---
Leveling now is boring because you can solo everything in the world and all you have to do is press a button to be teleported into a dungeon with 4 other silent players until you finish and are back out alone in the world again.
---
Those other 4 players could be bots half of the time and I'd never know.
---
Serendipity got fucked by the tauren trolling. He couldn't target the tremors because the tauren was sitting on them.
---
I mustard test my trickz!
---
Players have to report it first. Just about everyone in SW was in on that joke, but yes people have been banned for that.
---
I believe they were an event to hype up the original release of naxx. The event was reused before wotlk release too I think.
---
Imagine making this video to prove a point and being wrong
---
It's mental illness. And yeah I feel sorry for them too, you just know they have a sad life
---
Same! I don't care for his POE/Diablo content but I do enjoy him in wow.
---
Whoever is voting holy/disc for your own sanity please level as shadow at least.
---
But you realise thats kinda impossible to achieve when we allready have 1.12 patch?
---
PvP to PvE is allowed then?
---
For some reason I read this as my cousin is an alcoholic and I was like dammmn I'm not sure how the two relate..... wooopsie
---
You are also failing to factor in the absolute fact that almost everyone in vanilla keyboard turned, clicked their abilities, and mostly ran on lower end PC's with absolute crap internet connections.
---
Not sure how anyone could expect these dungeons to be difficult in a group where he has people listening to his every word... essentially a premade.
---
PuGs will still have some trouble along the way, but it wont ever be as hard as it was back then.
---
Did he even apologize after he won though?
---
Oops! Typo.
---
How many people are going to roll a Warrior and quit at 22 because of how slow it is, or a Paladin and quit at 40 when they find out everyone just wants them to heal.
---
I foresee a lot of people changing classes halfway through their first toon.
---
all the engineer stuff feels a bit overhyped, bombs get resisted like 75% of the time... also that one warrior who netted himself lmao
---
Someone give this guy gold
---
[https://challonge.com/j0t1yy2c](https://challonge.com/j0t1yy2c)

You need help.
---
If they really wanted to the organizers could avoid crowds and trolls.
---
Have warlocks at hard to get to places at every corner of the world and summon the duelers there. The switch place for each match. Would take an hour for anyone else to get there.
---
He’s incredibly good and has been for a very long time (I agree he is kind of a douche)
---
The Ziqo duels were fucking butt clenching.
---
I bet you missed the last couple of weeks on alliance streams. Asmongold has been making loads of fun content. High level dungeons. High level mobs with 40 man raids. Explorations. Kiting worldbosses to cities. Except for the few times horde went to gank alliance streamers i havent seen much content from them.
---
Well that’s good to know it wasn’t a completely awful decision. 😁
---
So it's okay to whine about no LFG addon because it "ruins the social spirit of Vanilla" but not to whine about Blizzard changing policies because it "ruins the social spirit of Vanilla"? No. You get both or none.
---
You seem like the whiny baby. And jealous of his popularity.
---
Yup, it's in the interview here:  [https://www.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291717/brian-birmingham-and-patrick-dawson-from-wow-classic-on-vanilla-collector-s-edit)    
---
&gt;If you have the original Collector’s Edition, you will unlock that special CE pet on your Classic WoW character.
---
More of a history thing
---
They can't even show skulls or bones though. So china can't be the reason, otherwise they'd censor that too
---
Love your username!
---
I love you both
---
Op is literally full of shit.

This is his character dude didn’t even play during vanilla at all and he has r14 druid in his actual reddit description Jesus Christ.
---
This is fucking monkeynews and he is geared out the ass
---
Go cry on a pserver
---
When dungeons got nerfed, that is when they stopped letting 10 man raids into them as well. 
---
It was the norm for all end game dungeons (sometimes even things like deadmines) to be run with 10 people, despite being designed for 5.  If you want them to revert the nerfs, then they should also bring back the 10 man raid option with your logic.
---
You're talking about conventional Republicans, who I dislike almost as much as the Democrats. Us normal people in the middle majority don't seem to get much of a voice in the political game or mindspace, as your post illustrates.
---
Is [Personal Life] BoP?
---
Your supposed ban has nothing to do with PVP and isn't specifically listed as an allowable action in the EULA. Corpse camping is specifically listed as an allowable action in the EULA.
---
Why wouldn't people use it?
---
Some of the best PvP events happened on RP-PvP servers. Blizzard forums were very active at coordinating RP PvP events and a lot of Blue/Green posts included themselves.
---
I never touched Role Playing but enjoyed the faction wars my RP-PvP server would cook up every weekend that resulted in massive PvP battles at random locations around the world.
---
They didn’t change policies, the policy breaks their overall TOS in blizzard games. No lfg addon is a design choice. Good try though
---
If you want ranged and consistent DPS play Hunter
---
Because they want to watch?
---
This is interesting. I wonder what would happen to angwe (i think that was his name, the rogue Who camped menethil harbor for month making it impossible to use as a lower level) in this New streamimg climate of today. Would it be possible for him to still camp the harbor for month or would the out cry on stream be too much and blizzard would intervene
---
 The tournament was very intriguing
---
Well he posted somewhere else of his character with its name and you can tell he never even played vanilla for one.
---
^
---
soda
---
Thats a weird way of spelling asmongold.
---
rogues and fury warriors.
---
why would I be jealous? I'm not a streamer
---
I just think he is kinda boring to watch and not a very nice person. He is like the Nightblue of WoW
---
Help to gets to teh btea!
---
Haha, he deleted that shit quick. It's cool his youtube video is still posted to forever show his shame
---
Um, GY has always been a joke, only the end to library is slightly challenging, and they actually did struggle a bit in armory.
---
But you are talking about a PREMADE.  Most people are going to be pugging as they level up.
---
BoB-Bind on Birth
---
Wow had 12 million players at peak. Today, It is speculated to be between 1-2 million, absolutely below 3 million. 
---
Personally I never stopped or moved on from playing WoW, it simply disappeared on me. It evolved into something I didn't recognize.
---
So unbelievably many people have that same feeling.
---
Ugh. I basicly lived in thunderbluff and had to ask friends to move me to ragefirechasm cuz my pc crashed everytime i entered orgrimmar.
---
spirits be with ya mon
---
Haven't got a clue about any of this but I am happy to see a random Ziltoid. How omniscient of you.Indeed!
---
he was so unlucky against venruki
---
I will be using this account in Classic now.
---
I agree that they should add content horizontally this time and not vertically, so they can avoid the same "play the patch" issues that happened before
---
I missed that drop apparently.
---
No worries it happens.
---
you seem like someone sweating a twitch streamers nuts a little too hard.
---
Ion said this and he has contradicted himself more times than I can count, based on what other devs have said.
---
Popularity by weebs with their parents credit card? Kk sign me up
---
Warlock to rank 12, there was a lot of competence. Having a pvp only guild running 24h bgs. Took me around 2.5 months playing 4-5h/day. The top who won top for a week played around 12h/day or even more just for 13 to 14 around 1.5 months.
---
Remember, streamers can kite dragons to Stormwind and grief their own faction. But if you stand in the wrong place on their stream Blizzard will ban you for it.
---
Not only that, jumping frost novas, reading plays and countering them last second with right totems...The windfury procs were just icing on top.
---
What happened to them I saw them early in tournament but during the semis and final they were gone? Did blizz ban them?
---
Its there own faction
---
two to three rp-pvp servers would be pop capped guaranteed.
---
Sure, but that sounds like an issue with the guild- that then becomes a different challenge you'll have to face which is finding the right guild for you. Make some friends as you level, chat around and be social through the 1-60 experience and you'll find yourself spoiled for choice when it comes to finding the guild for you :)
---
Megathreads are a form of soft censorship
---
Then they can enlarge the entire world.
---
How were there going to be social consequences for a level 1 alt that no one and tie to a main?

---
it's ok for asmongold to kite a boss to stormwind and ruin the experience of other players not in on *his* joke
---
but blizzard should ban someone for harming asmongold's stream while i'm watching it!
---
It was seren who got fucked
---
I am sure there will be 1 RPPVP server for NA and EU.
---
I got more excited watching it than anything in any past  expansion, man...
---
Strategic stalling is crucial to the gameplay of Mages.
---
I give this comment 5 stars.
---
Yeah all was laid out. Consumables were only regular food, water and trinket/gear cooldowns
---
hunter/ranged or rogue/melee
---
Do you have an example of that? Because i am quite sure that has never been the case
---
I want an “Arthas” movie.
---
It's not irrelevant.  If you want to maintain the classic experience then you should have to deal with problems in a similar manner.  The community needs to handle the issue, not the company.  
---
If I ninja loot hundreds of times, change my name, continue to ninja, change my name, on and on, who takes action then?
---
The community does by figuring out how to track name changes, server transfers, etc through Blizzard's API.  The same way they did it in the past.  Guild's prevent me from joining by asking for references.  The community creates a way to deal with the problem.  
---
Common sense, in my opinion, would dictate that players shouldn't lean on letting the company dictate what is write and wrong when it comes to social interactions.  Obviously there is a line to be crossed such as real life threats, doxing, and anything that could be considered illegal by law, but social interactions are something Blizzard shouldn't intervene on.  That's what made Vanilla the experience it was.
---
Wouldn't have mattered either way
---
I guess moments like that happen in every sport. Im a huge mma fan and some people find the ground game and clinching boring. Most of these fans are casuals and cant appreciate the extreme amount of skill that is being displayed and dont notice the little things.
---
Same applies to wow. Its easy to say Ziqo was just stalling but that isnt really doing the skill that is required to do that justice imo.
---
See, i haven't played since around the timeless isle was patched in mists. I did a fair bit of exploring on my 70 rogue post-cata, but before that i tried to be super serious raiding man for most of my wow experience. I was never any good.
---
My exploration experience largely comes from the seat of a Turbo-Charged Flying Machine zooming around at pretty high speed compared to the standard ground mount. Going searching for things i had only really experienced from a literal bird's eye view while exploring with an old friend (i miss you, bp) is going to be a nice twist on nostalgia i only have from after the world was changed. I didn't do much exploring in vanilla, or in bc. i had homework/d&amp;d/mtg/work/girlfriends on top of farming mats for professions, running dungeons, and raiding.
---
Despite playing for a year before classic ended, this will be my first time experiencing most of it from the ground.
---
Streamers on Horde?   Even more of a reason to never roll Horde, besides the fact they are all meth heads who live in mud huts and eat their own feces.
---
For real
---
This particular problem has no solution.
---
«Nothing to do with Classic» my fucking ass, it wouldn’t even have been close if they were doing a BFA tournament.
---
While i agree that this sucked, i still think cdew would have won.
---
Alliance could only grief if horde toggled pvp it was more a case of horde being arrogant and stupid and trying to attack the alliance who just came to watch. But what do you expect from a bunch of dumb green aliens and cows
---
Well that's where warrior NE walks in
---
I vividly remember discussing with my guild the changes when they happened and why they happened (because certain talents were changed that effected leveling characters).
---
I also vividly remember certain mobs in WC, Mara, SM, BRD etc change from Elites to Normal mobs.
---
I'm sure it's not listed as "Dungeons nerfed" in the patch notes.
---
It's probably a amalgamation of changes varying from spawn amounts to spawn distances to mob elite status to buffs/debuffs to damage values etc over the course of several small patches or hotfixes.
---
I would bet my left nut on my memory of the changes to some elite mobs in several leveling dungeons though, I don't doubt that for a second because I remember discussing it with both guildies on vent and RL friends during LANs.
---
We know.
---
Still won't stop people for asking for buffs for their "low-tier" specs in Classic. It's inevitable :P And blizzard should never change the class balance of this game - otherwise it would stop being Classic.

Huge faction imbalance, incredibly low populations.
---
Yeah, Blizzard isn't going to bring RP-PVP realms to Classic just because a few people want them.
---
Use the tools at hand to track his main like they did in the past, develop ways to figure out who it is, and ostracize him from the community.
---
Faction leaders would never initiate combat vs NPC mobs unless the mob hit them with AoE.
---
Only certain guards are scripted to assist players without being hit by the NPC.
---
We are simply getting the post nerfed 5 man dungeon values.
---
Not sure if you actually played early vanilla or not, but before they nerfed 5 mans, you were able to bring 10 people into them.  Guess what everyone did most of the time?  They took as many people as they could to clear dungeons (mainly end game).
---
Mix this with the absolute fact that most people clicked their abilities, and you can start to realize how tanks were dying a lot easier if healers were clicking everything, and perhaps even trying to mix in attacks as well.  
---
I am not completely opposed to the notion that Blizzard is pulling a fast one (wouldn't be the first time), but most of these examples are with good players, keybinding, no keyboard turning, good PC's/connection, and as premades going into these dungeons.. and most of them likely played in vanilla/TBC anyway.  
---
Vanilla wasn't 'that' difficult to the point of being some kind of hardcore experience.  Wiping wasn't the norm in leveling 5 mans until mara/ST.
---
In the past a guild would probably come, stand guard, and aptly be named &lt;Menethil Militia&gt; and there would be great RP to be had.
---
Agreed. He was the star of the show!
---
and not just any warlock...snutz is fucking nut
---
That would be funny if the GMs did just move them to a different layer. Then this guys bitching over banning is pointless and hilarious.
---
Menethil Militia sounds metal AF...
---
Snutz had to play the scuffed SL lock to deal with melee at that level, but it's not the best against mages. I'm pretty sure with Siphon Life it would've been an easy win. 
---
Mad respect to both players though, played out of their minds. Shit like dodging nades with pet recalls is so fun to watch.
---
For the most part, those changes did little to affect such low level dungeons.  For example, at level 30 you only have 21 talent points.  Also, weapon normalisation was a nerf in mist cases.
---
The truth is that the low level dungeons were introductions to the game, and was always exceptionally easy.  Maybe people remember them being difficult because they were children at the time?
---
In can distinctly remember the first dungeon that I ever found difficult: the sunken temple.  I remember that as it was the first time that I realised that I must down rank my healing touch in order to sustain mana through a single pull.
---
Don't worry, the level 60 dungeons will be more difficult than the lower level ones.  Not as difficult as they were originally, as they nerfed the hell out of Scholo, Strath and UBRS in patch 1.3, and then nerfed them again in 1.10.  They will still be far more difficult than the low level dungeons, though.
---
Who knows. I can only hope. It was so blatant they were just trying to disrupt other players mechanics.
---
Shut up Ziltoid!!!!!! Bahahaha
---
end of vanilla you could just buy full r14 wep/gear for honorpoints like the system they used until cata or something. every ran around in r14 gear pretbc.
---
Yes, but the dungeon nerfs came with the patch that stopped allowing 10 people to enter 5 man dungeons.
---
So should they bring back the ability to bring 10 people into deadmines or scholo?
---
I couldn't care less if I got into the beta lol. Show me where it says  you can't do what they did and ill retract my statement. Sorry that I don't blindly follow "big shots".
---
If the guild is having to go that far to avoid drama it seems fairly likely that there are people making accusations of "crushes/white-knighting" against people who make decisions they don't like.
---
That was the case for me. Basketball practice and conditioning on alternate days. So ever day for 4-6 hours.
---
My Thunderfury story has a sense of weird timing. I had one the right to get the first bindings that had dropped for us with guaranteed getting of the other binding. For 6 months I raided with my guild every single reset with no sign of the other half. So for the first time I had a night I just couldn’t make the raid but I had this odd feeling in my gut that it would be the night. Well guess what dropped? Yep the 2nd bindings. Thankfully the guild was totally cool with having a friend log in as me to be in the raid for that one fight. I heard that Ventrillo went nuts with everyone happy it finally dropped for me. Finished the quest the following morning with evetine taking down the Windseeker.
---
Also had 2 world epics drop for me. 1 Krol Blade and 1 Skullflame Shield. Used the Krol Blade but sold the shield for about 1000g.
---
Don't most of those same streamers play retail? Nothing like this happens on retail with streamers.
---
Awesome tournament, really fun to watch! 
---
However, Tipsout got really greedy with his ads. I feel he wanted to milk the situation as much as possible.
---
I get GM intervention if something like this was teetering on crashing the server, but the servers nowadays aren't the shitty TI-89 calculators they used to be.  I hope fun things like this don't get removed.
---
I can’t believe that a Mage won it. Nobody thought that Mages would make it very far. And the fact that it’s Venruki, literally the nicest guy in the world, is just incredible and so deserved.
---
I had to open a GM ticket on an alt because my main got trapped in Ironforge once. Framerate got so low that it would send me back to the character list lol
---
Crusader strike ftw. Paladins will rule
---
I feel like scarcity is the underlying fuel for much of what makes Classic so much better to play and invest in.
---
Way to miss the entire point of the thread, go full retard and demand changes to something that is completely fine. OP disagrees with what you just said.
---
&gt; Consumables were only regular food, water and trinket/gear cooldowns
---
It can't have been that because he uses a grenade in the video
---
If a bunch of streamers did that for bfa very few would care. Its definitely partially classic
---
You don't even get tranq shot until it drops off luciferon
---
Seal twisting worked, it was just pointless prior to Seal of Blood.
---
https://imgur.com/a/NRsVtJ2
---
I also found our first rag kill :)
---
me
---
You literally can't target totems a tauren is sitting on. /target doesn't work.
---
I'm sorry. You think DPS Warriors were rare in Vanilla? The only way a DPS Warrior could actually let loose full gear on a Boss was if they had a dual wielding Warrior tanking to keep threat.
---
You didn't play Vanilla or you've hit your head several times since you did.
---
After the next few rogue items the majority of your dkp would have been spent, while a new rogue had to earn dkp anyways. Makes no sense
---
Lmao this tournament was more hyped and exciting then anything I have seen in WoW in the past decade. It’s only lvl 30!
---
Agreed. I thought the lack of warlock summoning was a real shame, as it could have solved quite a few issues. More to learn for next time though, we hope!
---
Your whole point was a typo?
---
They already said no rp-pvp
---
It is literally in the TOS that you can’t initially over grief. There’s a difference between the alliance coming and crashing the event which fair credit to them even when a player flagged they didn’t do anything fucky and a player cause issues by jumping on players to get them to miss click during a fun event put on by the community. If this was the life game he would have prolly gotten a 3 day ban
---
One thing the people were right about was Vanilla class balance, TBC gets this right and wrath is good also.
---
Yep lol, in Warlords of Draenor I was bored one day and sent random items with 10k gold COD..
---
Yea I saw some people "shitting" on cdew and just spamming windfury proc things which definitely happened a shit ton of times but its not like cdew played bad and got carried by the windfury procs at all
---
That's crazy man. What an awesome guild and friend.
---
Actually that's a brilliant idea. It would also make the event more diverse as people duel in different zones.
---
They removed totem targeting because of macros.
---
On the dog boss Maybe. But tranq shot doesn't drop until luciferon so you could go through a bit of it
---
Just creating a BIS library for 50 people sounds daunting.  Even though they are submitting the data you'll still have to format and join everything.  Kudos to you, maybe i'll join your guild, but it sounds like to much work to me.
---
Blizzard can ban you for no reason at all. It’s in the tos.
---
Just don't watch him then...Why feel the need to comment at all? Everyone has different opinions on what they watch.
---
&gt; meaningful player interactions 
---
&gt; defend someone whose trolling
---
This is the fundamental problem in your thinking - these *are* the same thing. Because whatever you want to label an action is subjective.
---
The raid on the funeral *was* a defining event in vanilla history, *precisely* because you had chaotic player interactions that weren't curated and filtered by whatever Blizzard GM was around to police it.
---
Some said it was trolling, others said it was a meaningful representation that you can't truly control an event in the open world.
---
And neither should streamers - they shouldn't be able to control the world with GM powers. If Blizzard wants to police a streamer event in the beta, fine. Make it clear ahead of time, I really won't care. But that's not vanilla, and actual classic servers shouldn't have any of that policing. 
---
*If you host an event in the open world, expect people to disrupt it and don't cry when they do.*
---
If you want to get into it, you also need R1 Fireblast, R1 BLizzard, R1 Cone of Cold, R1 Frost armor, R1 Manashield, R1 Fireball and R1 Arcane Missles on your binds.
---
And this doenst even cover mousover binds....
---
venruki is literally a 1v1 god , as mage and also as monk.
---
Now this is shitposting
---
He’s banned dude. Streamers reported him to Blizz, check other comments in the thread ok?
---
You could perform well easier on a bear Druid up to a certain point.
---
An equal skilled tank Druid will always be out performed by an equally skilled tank Warrior though, even in AoE situations 
---
You're correct though, it was rare to actually see #GOOD Warriors, but when you did come across one, it was like watching an artist.
---
Brooooooooooo, I think it was Dude wheres my mount, thank youuuuu
---
You don't get tranqshot til you kill luciferon you get further than the second boss
---
I really like Venruki. His stream is always so chill and he has such a great attitude about the game. Really happy for him.
---
I'm 99% sure it is from a ps as well but how do you know?
---
Crusader Orbs do not exist
---
Yeah, you caught my meaning. No pre buffs, food buffs, Free Action Potions, pots at all. 
---
Iron Grenades are a specific exception if i remember correctly. There were a lot of small specifications to lay out the tourney. Shaman getting one totem placement pre duel, stealths, no pre-saccing for warlocks, etc.
---
I felt so bad for Jelly when that gnome rogue soaked up his scattershot that was meant for Venruki. Seriously tilting even just to watch it.
---
You can see from his comment history he’s played post-vanilla retail to some degree, so I really doubt he made a brand new account to do so while his character is sitting there on an inactive with rank 14 and frostsaber.
---
Why not just give them instant 60 and full GM powers?
---
Classic will be even greater then yeah?
---
&gt;We didn’t see a single Core Hound Tooth drop until we’d cleared BWL. Drove me insane.
---
Should have asked the MT not to break all the core hounds' teeth then!
---
I do believe it was "dude wheres my mount?" now, but thanks for turning me on to Illegal Danish lol. Was a fun watch.
---
Sequisha's stash was on a one day cooldown otherwise he woulda won.
---
Whats funny is once the big battle was over and the alliance won, they were able to get everyone to stay back 100 yards and stand in a line to watch.one of the announcers even made a joke about it.
---
Felstriker my first UBRS run as a rogue that hit 60 a few hours prior.  Rolled human for the sword / mace expertise and it pigeonholed me into going daggers unexpectedly, which I ended up enjoying tremendously.
---
Only a low functioning autist is incapable of understanding which dungeon people are talking about when they say DM.
---
Was that rando a gnome mage?
---
Rogue for sure.  Toss up with fury warrior I guess.
---
What did they say? Those Tauren were so freaking annoying.
---
the debuff part of mindflay is the movement speed slow, unimportant and "low" priority so is fine to use, one of the first to get knocked off. VE isnt an offensive spell anyway and people want at least one stack of shadow weaving - so its mainly shadow word pain and i think mindflay is around as efficient as swp so on longer fights it shouldnt be as important and if nothing else only takes one extra slot up after the valued shadow weaving
---
I'm just glad gear has a real impact.
---
Clip not found?
---
*Nice*
---
lol tips never updated the bracket after the finals. Thanks a lot.
---
And this is why DKP is silly. If you don't think every class channel had worked out who would get what so they didn't jump up bids, you're delusional. Every class would purposely tank the bids on items only their class wanted and save DKP for multi-class items.
---
Ohh OK I see it now, thanks
---
Spell batching was  never meant to be a game mechanic and thus it throws balance way off without any good reason. This isn’t a fighting game.
---
he didnt get banned. Layer changed
---
That's awesome. In the thread I asked some guy called me a dumbass for asking such a stupid question. Lol.
---
Anyways can't wait to have my pets again! They were a big part of my vanilla experience. They'll be even more rare now!
---
Until next week’s tourney.
---
I mean, I *am* interested because of nostalgia. Doesn't mean it's unjustified.
---
Your triggered about his angry comment. Cmon dude it’s just a Reddit comment. Calm you tits.
---
Every system has flaws because people, if they have the will to do so, they´ll find ways to abuse the system.
---
**Loot council** is a method that could work in top-end guilds where everyone knows each other and progression and achievements "MC world first" matters more than you completing your T1 one week sooner or later, but I don´t think it´ll cut it for random guilds, even the ones that will be top5 server-wide, because let´s face it, people won´t join a guild and commit a lot of time and effort so then the "loot council" decides that sword better goes to the officer because he´s guaranteed to stay with his friends and you´re not. 
---
What loot council is to me is: friends' common sense but applied to a group of 40 people. Imagine if you are leveling with your buddy, you both are the same class and require the same gear. If you have a lvl 40 weapon and he has a lvl 35 one, and a really good lvl 45 weapon drops, you´re gonna allow him to have it. You will not even give a fuck about the gear "improvement" because he´s your friend and you're doing what's right. 
---
That plus the fact that guilds with loot council are going to inherently progress faster than DKP ones since it's all about % upgrades, so if you will increase your dps by 5% with that one item but your teammate will increase it by 3%, you´re having it.
---
**DKP** is the most common and probably most fair / inmune to guild staff corruption, but it can still be very easily abused, depending on the circumstances. Anyone who raided back in the day will know. If I am in a guild that´s doing molten core and we're about to finish it, I could save "all my dkp", not spend it there, and come black wing lair all loot will be mine because I hoarded DKP and the best items will belong to me. It rewards progression in big steps rather than item by item, and you could have a guy with many blues not spend DKP in MC to save it for BWL or AQ40.
---
Conclusion: Systems have flaws, just make sure to find a guild of people with your same goals / attitude and HAVE FUN.
---
These guys are almost as decked out as possible.
---
Keep in mind that people aren't going to be at 30 forever in live and wont have the spare time to just gear up for the sake of overgearing their level range of instances.
---
a legend who will be remembered
---
How do you hate a (massively diverse) group of people you don't know? Maybe you meant you dislike the idea of streaming?
---
I said it elsewhere the only 2 leveling dungeons I ever remember being tough for me were Gnomer, and Ulda. Which probably had more to do with the levels of everyone in the group. I was tank in both. 30 in gnomer, and 42 in Ulda.
---
Am I dumb or can you actually jump over the frost nova?
---
People did similar things with DKP as this. One old guild of mine had weekly % decay on everyone dkp, and decay on the price people paid on previous items (so their value hurt you less and less over time).
---
This helps to keep people more even on how much they’ve stocked, and new members weren’t completely fucked when joining and have to take non-bis upgrades.
---
Sure, you could hoard, but it brought you down a bit and made it more difficult to outright trump anyone by a large margin and get defaulted all the bis loot purely by being the oldest of a spec/class.
---
We also did a hard reduction when going to a new tier. Like everyone received a 90 or 95% reduction to total dkp.
---
Well you asked how I'd feel entertained in Classic as a current Mythic type player, and I'm saying to you that there's enough challenge to be found in some of the Vanilla dungeons and raids to keep that itch scratched for me.
---
&gt; Any silly game mechanic you can't figure out yourself by playing the game the intended way is not a good game mechanic.
---
I was targeting this in particular, which is an absurd thing to say.
---
what a legend
---
Dont roll mage unless you want to die to a lot
---
I do often think of this only because, how could a game last a year in this day in age without at least some balance changes.
---
I'm all for No changes, but will everyone else after a year and a half of the same meta?
---
What makes you think it was unlicensed?
---
Seems like another thing that PS got wrong.
---
Righteous orb*
---
They're used in the crusader enchant and that is where my confusion stemmed.
---
wasnt banned
---
I don’t have a plan, it will depend on what my returning friends decide to play. But regardless of what I roll, I will expect everyone *in levelling instances* to roll on whatever gear helps their levelling spec. Because we aren’t “tanks”, “healers” and “dps” at that stage, we are all levellers.

Rank 11 was top 1.4%, so yeah, safe to assume rank 12 was 1%. Rank 14 is top 0.1%. Some realms didn't even have enough players with enough contribution points to name a rank 14 each week.

so you got no proof is what u saying. gotcha

PvP happens any time, anywhere on a PvP server, except in faction-specific zones (generally below level \~20) and capital cities. You can still attack the opposite faction if you see them in your capital city, but they can't attack you until you do.
---
Only way to play IMO. Makes the game feel alive.
---
I'm in the opinion they should rerelease wrath, using existing content as a frame and build off it. Finish the nerubian areas, have the tier 1 raid for the expansion be there and leave naxx where it is. Have the content start at level 40, and go to 60. Introduce gear that's not ilvl superior to what naxx has, but has interesting procs. Make the tier gear slightly better than classic (so tier 4 &gt; tier 1, but tier 2 &gt; tier 4. T5 &gt; T2, T3 &gt;T5 and ect.) but for different specs. Your paladins can tank because the nerubian raid drops int plate with defensive stats, and tier 4 promotes tanking and what have you.
---
Keep ulduar, but replace trial with that unfinished troll raid because trial was a joke. Rebuild ICC to be more Karazhan in scope and feel.
---
Then just change Storm Peaks so flying isn't a requirement and bam. Expansion.
---
Starting doing 10 mans with my Guild in Wrath. Picked up the shield off of Anub’Rekhan on my Shaman. Then proceeded to have every shield either not drop or lose the roll for the entirety of the expansion. Only ended up replacing it a couple months before Cata doing a random ToC Heroic PUG. I was so used to not seeing a shield they had to point it out to me.
---
lol at anyone who was watching tips stream for this. No shit he’s a leech.
---
Since you said you prefer “not up close” I’m going to say warlock. Locks can life tap, which is trading life for mana. Since warlocks have multiple ways to regain HP, their efficiency makes them the fastest casting leveler and also the most consistent caster in terms of times between pulls.
---
I have so much respect for Venruki. Love to see such a yop tier player being so humble and down to earth ❤
---
Just a quick one. I thought there was going to be too many rogues too, but of all the polls posted to this sub, rogues are sitting like 4th. So doesnt seem like it will be too bad? One of the polls has 30k votes too. So decent pool size.
---
I really wanna know too. Winterspring Frostsaber is still a pain in the ass to get even nowadays.
---
[Here's the armory. It is a shit post.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/outland/knth)
---
If they got banned, I don't understand why so late in the tourney? I'm sure blizzard staff was watching throughout. Maybe they weren't so sure themselves how to handle the situation? I think we might need more clear rules as stuff like this is going to happen continuously. Also Sodapoppin reporting the Troll with the reason "retard" with 50k+ viewers, real mature. Wonder what would happen if a normal player does this.
---
That link doesn't work
---
Idk where people are confirming that but would like to know if was it was a permanent ban or they just suspended them.
---
You’re spamming a clip that doesn’t exist, btw
---
he is what vanilla is about, you're just a crybaby
---
It changes a lot actually. Same faction griefing is/was/will be much less common, by degrees of magnitude, than cross-faction. If you don't see that then I don't know what to tell you? Open your eyes? Wake up and smell the coffee?
---
Anyhow I'm not going to carry on this conversation with you and don't want to have your reply, however well thought out it may be, cluttering my inbox. Welcome to the block list!

First half of TBC was insanely fun.
---
I guess I just enjoyed the more challenging dungeon/raid content.  It did come with some issues and changed some things for the worse, but the overall 'fun' factor was at its sweet spot for me.

no he used it for a trash buff
---
lol bidding was so shit, I would never join a guild that didnt use set value item dkp prices.
---
For sure... I’ve played quite a bit including raiding on a 4g connection and it’s very close to my home internet.  Ping is usually like 10-20 higher.  Additionally,  WoW uses very little data so long as you aren’t installing the game from scratch.
---
Luci is first boss, and the second one has enrage.
---
Other posters are correct though, he should be possible without tranq.
---
You might be able to push it with 6 tanks. Might depending on the week.
---
i am absolutely loving the suggestions. you great ideas keep them keeping. this will improve classic 100%
---
Long lost MMO twinsies.
---
then everyone in the tourney should be banned to for breaking TOS of exploiting the map when they moved to a new location.
---
Well regardless he proved again that he's the real deal
---
Hypothetical: If you walk in on a streamer event in Classic and decide to start killing the opposing faction, and a streamer complains, will Blizz ban you?
---
What exactly is the line between simple pvping and griefing? And will streamers and their massive rabid fanbases get special treatment?
---
It sure seems like Blizz will go out of their way to appease streamers, while all the other plebians and peasants just have to make do with actually playing vanilla.
---
While I agree with many of your thoughts, I personally think one should refrain from posting without possible solutions. I know, get a conversation going and so on, but still. It always feels so easy to criticize Blizzard for their actions by a huge mass of people, especially on this sub here, with very few thoughtful potential solutions for known issues.
---
No he summoned it to cast a shield not to sac. It wasnt against the rules and the hosts said it was too late to change it mid tourney anyways. Its much much less of a deal compared to sac but they will probably take that away next time

the rage from the kids in twitch chat was incredible. those two guys caused 100,000 uptight gamers to shit their pants with rage with minimal effort - not bad.
---
Sweet. I was gonna go PvP anyway since I never got to experience it but it's good to know I have an out if I need it haha
---
RIP - too lazy to reclip it
---
Grats Ven big win
---
As much as I lived fucking around in classic and I was an absolute hero persona I gotta say I was annoyed and I agree when you get such big events with over a 100k watching, fuck it, ban the troll especially when it's one person literally. If the tourney never started and just went all put group pvp, I'm fine with that but in this case it was one guy vs hundreds abiding and watching

---
I disagree, climbing has been a part of the game forever even in retail. Not ToS
---
though, priest can dispell both debuffs on the warrior and buffs on the enemies which shammies an palas cannot. And its way more detrimental to a warriors rage generation attacking an enemy with a shield then the warrior having the shield - so dispells matter
---
He did tell people multiple times to go to tips stream and also asked tips if it was ok to do that. Tips had 20k+ which is a lot for him.
---
So one of them plays how he wants to and the other panders to his audience?
---
At that point, you're better off using something like [loot lists](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/). Best loot system ever devised.
---
or banning everyone in the tourney who exploited the map to get their new location.
---
Thats an important detail.
---
Blood needs to be in.
---
Get a guild that cares more about a persons personality rather than what class they pick
---
Remember that these are not normal progression...these guys are level 30 twinks with BiS gear.

as a cat? No. No pvp premade would take an actual cat DPS in and neither will any PvE guild. Why take in someone who does 1/3 of what warrior does, specially when warrior is the most played class and they will be everywhere.

you can even see on monkeynews vod that the horde engaged first all the time.

Well to be fair, we have seen what happened to EQ classic and OSRS when you don't move on to other content.  People do and will get bored of a game where there is no hope of any positive changes (class balance for example) and the population will likely fall off in 1.5-2 years from release.  
---
You are also assuming a corporation would take the risk of letting these devs, who ported a game over, make reasonable decision making on new content.  It would likely be far cheaper and easier for them to just port down TBC and then wrath when the time comes, as opposed to trying to create something completely new.
---
Yeah, but no one can predict that at launch. It's a gamble.
---
Herb on mage because its easier to cc mobs and then Herb, plus with blink you move around Faster before you get mount and that is just Nice when gathering stuff. Ench on priest because if you heal on it, then you can run a lot of dungeons and get a lot of greens and blue to dis enchamt
---
imagine thinking this. bombs are absolutely key.
---
You can both heal and dps viably with a single spec as a druid. Your talents are insanely flexible. I'll link you a build I just mocked up that would allow you to swap between a healer and kitty dps with a simple gear swap. You'll need two different sets of gear obviously, but you can get addons that allow you to swap gear sets with a single button.

Luckiest - First day at 60 got the raptor mount out of zg. 
---
Unluckiest - got that account banned about a week later for buying gold. (Not really unlucky since I deserved the ban, but still sucks)
---
Hope he keeps it real now that he is literally exploding in views and subs.
---
Excuse me sir, streamers have special privileges. 
---
You can't disrupt their play, only their play is allowed to disrupt yours.
---
that’s a huge bummer. rogue it is i guess lol.
---
Yea, it added a few, very questionable things to the game, but all in all, I wouldn't mind it happening again. 
---
Loved the dungeon/raid content more than any other iteration of the game.
---
Yes you can play whatever you want, just don't get upset if you set refused a raid invite or are asked to respect resto.
---
If you ultimately want to raid as feral, you and your mates should start a guild or run a weekly pug group to guarantee you play feral.
---
That's the great thing about classic - options - unlike BFA where very class is the exact same :)
---
It didn’t work on any of the private servers I’ve tried
---
Here's an idea: Get a racing foot pedal and map different thresholds of the pedal to different modifier combinations, then you can bind 8 spell ranks (Shift,Ctrl,Alt + all combinations) using the foot pedal to increase the rank.
---
Now you can literally increase the power of your character by pressing down on the gas pedal.
---
I'm with you for the most part.  I wouldn't mind if they completely stopped wrath at ulduar though, and omitted dual spec.
---
The first time you do MC you do Lucifron before Magmadar for the tome.
---
saying cope is harassment?
---
Play what you like. Most specs, even hybrid specs, can be viable in PvP, and Feral Druids are probably the best flag carriers for WSG.
---
For PvE? No, it's not really possible. Maybe you'll have a guild that will allow you to be a Feral OT, since they aren't actively *bad* (even if Warriors have a much better toolkit), but Cat Ferals are pretty much a no-go in a progression guild. There will be plenty of casual guilds that let people do whatever the fuck they want, but if you want to actually be in a high-ranking one, they'll expect you to either be a healer or, if you're very lucky, you can again be an OT.
---
What's wrong with it in the pic? Was it changed visually during classic or something?
---
Why don't we just allow them to manage the servers?
---
Honestly, I want to know who randomly decided to edit the game file and swap the sword around out of no where, how they got away with it and how no one has ever corrected it back yet, even to this day.
---
I just.....I just don't understand.
---
or go to a PVE server because this will continue to happen in a pvp server. For wedding, for funerals, for anything. There's gonna be sooooo much ragequits before Phase 2 even hits.
---
Oh so he’s basically the griefer from the South Park episode.
---
So true. After watching him and Ziqo for a few days I thought I had the basic grasp of vanilla Mage, and also having a ton of retail experience I thought I can do a decent job at vanilla duels. Got into the Henhouse insant 60 private server only to realize how god damn hard it is to think about 50 different things at once. Those advanced duel tactics are so much harder than they look.
---
That's a really well done comparison, if only we could get one from actual Vanilla to stop any doubt.
---
if possible , can you please provide a screenshot and the spec of your laptop? im really looking to play the game on a laptop. thanks
---
Eh, TBC hardly changed through its time.  The most that really changed was the final couple patches introducing insane catch up mechanics which would likely come in phases anyway.  
---
As opposed to vanilla where the came was completely changing every month up until the final 3rd leading into TBC.
---
Wow those spoilers.

Sorry I’m just caught up in the beta hype FOR THE ALLIANCE

Upside down
---
Go look at the lvl 30 classic beta tournament that happened earlier today and see who won. or go to a Pserver, a tbc server would do well or a good classic one if you can find. And level a Druid, if you figure out that you really like Druid drop the server so you don’t kill the hype for yourself and roll a Druid when classic drops. At least that’s what I’m doing and so far I’m gonna roll mage. I had a warrior for my main when I joined in WOTLK, and mained a rogue in legion and bfa so I’m going caster.
---
I have never been part of a guild that did bidding. Each item had a cost and whomever had the most DKP got it. So if each item cost 15-30dkp and 4 rogues have 300+ dkp (i don't remember the actual numbers) then the new rogue is in for a long ride.
---
What does it look like now?
---
how about soda typing "retard" as the report reason in front of 50,000 people?
---
is that good for the community too?
---
Made a super popular video where he explains what he was wrong about classic and highlighted why it's so good.
---
He also led the charge in WWW1 (WhirlWind War 1) that "won"them the battle. Fucking epic. Was invited as a guest on the ClassiCast podcast.
---
Was the first guy with a 1v2 PvP video made, along with Snutz.
---
Most entertaining WSG matches and plays, by far. Him and Ziqo.
---
Very wholesome guy and impossibly skilled.
---
He is definitely the hero of the Beta so far.
---
thats never been brought up but i like it. keep going
---
Thanks! I couldn't find a link I appreciate it.
---
Removing comments cause someone’s feelings might get hurt lmao nice mod team
---
What? That was the epitome of griefing. It could not fit the definition any better.
---
I know Druids can farm decently even with full healer spec and healer gear, that's not an issue. I'm mostly curious about what Leatherworkers actually need to skin to make max level stuff. I could just go alchemy though, cuz druids are good at herbing in animal forms and so on.
---
You can't.
---
It's backwards. The curve should be facing towards the ground.
---
Trying to weild this sword even with orc strength would be imbalanced because the back of the sword would always want to switch around forward.
---
Basically the back of the sword is the blade I. This photo.

Wowhead Classic Dressing Room has it right, maybe that's a sign.

Really? Have a link?
---
Are you able to explain what information you provided?
---
Ew retrowow lol
---
depends on the server. but if they only plan to release a few server because of layering it will be impossible with just soloque and casually playing few hours weekday/nolife weekend.
---
the amount of unemployement people or people who afk university for a semester to grind honor in premades 12h a day will be huge. i mean even on pserver its an absolute tryhard fiesta. cant imagine how tryhard it will be on classic when it will actually matter again.
---
on otherside it will be easier on pve realms tho because less active pvp players but because of the huge numbers of people on classic servers(layering) there will be more absolute number of spots per ranks so it should be easier to have a high standing there.
---
&gt; but not life-shattering amounts.
---
If account-sharing is allowed then yeah, anything above R11 is basically another job. Have to sacrifice something at that point.
---
Should have just had the whole thing at the Gurubashi Arena.
---
Hahah and why would same faction grieving be less on pve servers? These guys have hundreds of thousands of people watching.
---
This is classic PvP. Grenades, food, bandages, trinkets are all super important and add another layer of difficulty to the fight. I'd say they even make or break some classes.
---
Plus, it's super cool to see how RPG like it is to use consumables.
---
Let's hope. Favorite sword in the game. When it's held proper.
---
Get... Out... OF MY HEAD!!!
---
That's one reason why I made this post. "It's about the journey, not the destination." Read the quests and really get a feel for what you're doing and why. And make sure you interact with other players. No matter how many times you play through the same content, it should have a different experience if you interact with the people around you or even a guild. You'll have a good conversation, get into shenanigans, get ganked and have that spark a huge WPvP fight, or all of the above! People need to understand the game is what you make it. When we forget that, we end up with BFA.
---
Every Wednesday here people advertise guilds and stuff in a specific thread
---
Fuck... imagine playing an orc and complaining about aesthetics. LMAO
---
Problem is the target audience/demand gets significantly smaller as the expansions go by. For classic there's a huge demand, for BC there will be a decent demand, for WOTLK it will be pretty low and from then on it's non existent. 
---
It's really not hard to develop content for classic so long as the content is made with the classic theme in mind, no game design changes that may cause issues have to be implemented, just purely new zones &amp; instances for players to get stuck into and tackle.
---
It looks like this photo in retail.

Honestly at higher levels are classes feel more fleshed out maybe but others become "OP".
---
This game is 15 years old. It does not work the way the current game does. No one will care unless you are world first cutting edge. Play what you like and be helpful and people will want to play with you. Most people on this sub are delusional. I raided with quite a few druids and loved them back in vanilla. I was always envious of their versatility.
---
Yea because there's no hype for BFA at the moment and there's no big names playing, why you guys are so bad at understanding how HYPE works on Twitch? 
---
If streamers did the same tournament at the release of BFA it would have had the same numbers as this tournament.
---
I'm not saying Classic sucks, i'm just pointing out what the fuck OP means when he says "take note Blizzard", the fuck is he talking about?
---

Having played a 70 twink through 2 and a half expansions, it doesn't get old. I haven't done mythic+, i leveled my paladin to cap, did some 5s and lfr, and just... it's not even the content, i hate the character. I leveled a druid to 112, and that was aweful too. My rogue made it to around 114 before i gave up on her, and then i just went back to my level 70 comfort zone to find that the bracket was dead, my subtlety swords spec didn't exist anymore, and all of my friends were gone.
---
Coming back to WoW after almost 6 years doesnt even feel like WoW. I don't find any of it fun anymore. The dungeons, the characters, the leveling, the story... it's not the game i grew up with. It feels completely alienating, and i haven't even logged back in since december.
---
But in my day, i was running Karazhan twice a week. I was running every other BC raid at least once. I dropped into 5s in lfg because i enjoyed talking to people, which is something i hadn't done one single time in the 2 months i played BFA. Even the "social" guilds that recruit random guildless people were dead, i had maybe two conversations that lasted for more than a couple minutes.
---
The game feels like it's single player. Nobody asked fkr help with anything, nobody needed potions or flasks, nobody wanted to run content as a group. It was... aweful.
---
Aahhhhhh thanks for the post m8 :)
---
Mind sending the details?
---
Stock Google image, I don't play orc however they look badass in most plate sets and have some of the best melee animations in game.
---
&gt;I've never seen a more grateful streamer in general.
---
Why do you make dumb comment like this man? I know you are not that dumb.
---
Well, vanilla with nothing new would also see a massive drop in players either way in a couple years, so forcing them over would likely make sense.
---
Otherwise you just split the playerbase of servers, and it may or may not work out.
---
Someone call the whaaambulance. Get downvoted bitch. Fucking god damn cancer.
---
How old are you
---
2k+ HP warrior in lv30 BiS using Sappers -- I think this is an edge case.
---
Just remember folks, if a streamer feels like their gameplay is being threatened, they are allowed to have their rabid fanbase spam reports and get special Blizz GM privilege to ban them.
---
If you feel like your gameplay is being threatened, well tough shit you aren't a streamer lmao get in back of the line pleb. This is classic, not vanilla
---
Why don't we just have streamers now own all of activision-blizzard?
---
I assume that was to help with the 2k prize pool but i could be wrong
---
I am only playing classic in hopes of TBC happening again. 
---
My guess is that it will happen, but it wont be announced until there is a decent drop in players for vanilla.  Once the numbers clearly indicate people are bored, they will try and get new content out.
---
showtooltip didn't work in classic, probably works in the new engine though
---
Sorry to burst you’re bubble, none of the horde races look great.
---
On the one hand I agree, definitely, they're in the game and anyone can go get them but on the other hand it's yet another barrier to entry on a game that is basically one giant barrier to entry
---
It’s called ret prio
---
You are looking for priest with wand specialisation and spirit tap
---
I love how no changes incorporates changes (who am I kidding, it always has). I guess I'm #nochanges now?
---
He's talking about the guy being 14th in obtaining the mount in the picture. It was a Winterspring grind.
---
But how does it look on beta?
---
why dont already like seriously they should. i love them and they are gods among men
---
feral is fine in PvP, it's... very undesireable in PvE once you get into raiding, but if you can stomach healing, you don't really need to spec out of feral to heal, as long as you get the mana regeneration talent and Improved Healing Touch in Restoration.
---
Lvl 9 twinks bro.
---
To be fair, mages are relatively easy in classic, but the difference between a good mage and an exceptional mage takes an insane amount of skill, which of course Venruki is.
---
Low skill floor, high skill ceiling.
---
TIL you can
---
Boohoo, that's open world for you
---
Which likely can't happen the way you think it should.  They wont risk splitting server playerbases apart if vanilla numbers were already dropping after a time.  
---
Nothing lasts forever, and something tells me they rill go up to wrath and call it quits and then reopen all instances of the game again.
---
As I recall Alliance always had more players but usually would lose even with a 5 man lead in World-PvP.
---
Prot 30+ is very good.

From a PvP perspective, things got worse.
---
PvE was never better though.  5 mans were challenging and very rewarding.  Had some of the most fun and challenging raids to date.  Karazhan alone would be worth experiencing again.

Yeah I don’t get it.
---
Kids, maybe?
---
mirror?
---
i don’t mind overly much. i was originally gonna roll rogue before i remembered  about feral.
---
even if druid interests me, it seems that a lot of people (even my friends outside this subreddit) believe that playing a druid isn’t gonna be easy work if i wanna play as competitively as i want. 
---
probably gonna main a rogue and build a druid on the side, and play the druid when i feel a bit of burnout. i’m planning to put a lot of time in (while i have the chance), so my options are basically limitless lol.
---
who knows, might end up rolling some other class in the end ^_^

TIL Snutz doesn't know how to Sac :P
---
A lot of "end game" gear is made from leather skinned from dungeon bosses/ raid bosses and trash. So most of the super high end leathers come from stuff you feasibly won't be soloing.

World Of Warcraft: A Realm Reborn
---
&gt;Also track X was a buff, your video is bad.
---
not sure how actual vanilla video recording is "bad" but you're wrong.
---
he adjusted to every matchup incredibly well. It was a treat to watch these people duel.
---
Damn, hunters got starched. Sucks when you are dueling and don't have the distance to kite, I'm guessing
---
Those thaddius caster had odds are 1:7482.
---
No, that didn't happen till wrath, and even more so in cata.  
---
BC still had buffs as very unique abilities for each specs, and rotations were still very different from each other.  I am interested to hear which classes you think were even remotely the same to play, or even specs for that matter?
---
Added more videos to track X buff, let me know if you find evidence of otherwise \^\^. As for faction leaders, I'll add video evidence as well, if you have something that contradicts it please let me know!
---
Alot of ppl saying rogues and warriors but they need to heal often so dont think its what you are looking for. Instead I would suggest either warlock or priest. The reason is wands, mp5, drains for warlock and high spirit for priest.
---
Leveling you make sure to spend some mana on a mob or two using a big spell to pull then dots after which you use your wand to kill with.
---
Just make sure you have an up to date wand which is fairly easy.
---
Also hunters are great since there is often little need to over spend on mana so you will have a very easy time.
---
Over all I'd say hunters take the cake when it comes to sustainabillity after them comes warlock as a close second and priest follows the warlock on third place. But they are all fun to level and have a big role in most content.
---
The example given with regards to OSRS vs RS3 isn't even all that comparable. OSRS was pitched as a 2007 version of RuneScape and that was it. It kept bleeding players until they made it F2P and more importantly added *new* content. 
---
OSRS branched off and became it's own thing. A sort of retrospective look at where RS3 went wrong, and has stayed on a better path since then. 
---
Classic WoW isn't exactly aiming at that as of currently. I'm in the camp that doesn't believe it's all nostalgia whatsoever and that classic will be very successful, but eventually without any new content or reset it *will* die off like OSRS was about to.
---
You don't even need fire resistance items as a non tank, just using a potion is more than enough. Only the tank will need a set.
---
I’m not factoring that in because the experience that is fresh in my mind (I was like 9 when I first played vanilla) is pservers. I’ve run deadmines on a relevant level characters different pservers in 2019 and we always had to stop to drink. It was SLOW. There really was waiting and planning between pulls that just isn’t there on any beta stream I watched. I understand why people found that incongruous.
---
But yes, I agree, PuGs will still overpull and wipe all the time. Random people aren’t paying as much attention or trying as hard as people on stream.
---
this is why u need alliance there to kill the trolls. Just coordinate better.
---
I didn't say or suggest that it wasn't classic PvP. I said I don't know how I feel about consumables **in duels.**
---
The same reason I wouldn't particularly enjoy someone using a shadow chugging a shadow protection potion in a duel against a shadow priest.
---
I think the rule of thumb should probably be the only (non-conjured) consumables that would be valid in a duel are consumables that every single character has the ability to craft and use themselves. Engineering consumables don't fall under that, same as alchemy ones.
---
yike
---
They were added in Vanilla, I know because I rolled on them as soon as they came out
---
I totally did misspell else ayyy lmao
---
#showtooltip
---
/startattack
---
/cast ________
---
It also got a lot of things right.
---
At the end of the day, vanilla had done a lot incorrectly as well, but it has more pros than cons.  Same can be said about TBC.  PvE content was arguably at its pinnacle in TBC, and skillful players shined the brightest in that iteration, especially tanks.
---
ohhh noes, anything but the downvote!!! what will I do! my feelings!! wahhhh /lulz
---
You'll have to make some noise on the official forums and bug Devs on twitter about it, cause as it stands they said they won't have them unless there's more of a want for them.
---
Thanks for doing this, we appreciate it.
---
He was literally getting soul drained during the duel he first flagged on
---
The game is 100% worse than 15 years ago.
---
It's banned in China which means its banned everywhere
---
hell of a day, hell of a time watching quin
---
*tips fedora to the tauren sperg*
---
Whoever said you couldn't /target totems are wrong. Totem stomp macros were removed in 3.1.2.
---
You should be able to in vanilla.
---
gnome tanks getting absolutely slammed by the giant fiery stone dudes in MC was one of the most memorable experiences for me in vanilla.
---
Not to mention that AQ and naxx will still only be experienced by a very small fraction of the community.  Not because of challenge alone, but because of the time it takes to clear MC/BWL every week on top of pushing progression.
---
Yeah, but people have been griefing and ruining player-created events for years in-game, and it's never been a bannable offense. I think doing that is pretty trashy, but that's just how it is.
---
felstriker
---
I gave them the account name and character name and e-mail. Also had to provide ID.
---
Subtle.
---
I'm probably maining feral as well, remember the raids are 40 man, as long as you can show up and aren't a douche, and don't mind being an offtank when needed you'll probably be fine. I think the main issue is just that gear is a bit scarce for them.
---
Bring me your universes ultimate cup of coffee! So i can stay up all night playing alts on Classic.
---
2 grand had to come out of someones pocket. but yeah i hate ads with a passion too.
---
Yea, the fixing of specs alone makes me want TBC.  Talent trees were so much more robust and meaningful.   
---
Though many would argue arenas brought the game's PvP down the wrong path; I imagine that is why many people who liked vanilla PvP are so opposed to TBC releasing.
---
Can you elaborate on that?
---
Just the animation, no damage. Cancelled before any damage was done.
---
They're using legion client, right?
---
Lmao xD
---
competitive battlegrounds will draw in so many viewers
---
I honestly can't remember.  I was horde, though.
---
Yeah. Warrior threat is bonkers at lower levels even without points in Defiance. There really is reason to do go protection before 50.
---
Zug zug.
---
[I have good news for you.](https://i.imgur.com/hvu9Z8C.png)
---
Dunno, probably gave them the wrong info previously. I at one point had the CD keys associated with the account (years and years ago) they wouldn’t take those at the time; they did ask for any key’s used on the account this time but I didn’t have them.
---
I actually gave them the wrong account info initially. The GM said we’d have to think of other info we could use, so I asked if I could give him a list of account names I have used previously. He said sure, and that located it.
---
and why they deserve ban? you guys take this way too seriously
---
To each their own, but wrath's dungeons were complete garbage overall in design, and CC was no longer required heroics even at launch.
---
Not to mention they just rehashed naxx for their first major raid and made a very basic dragon fight on the side.  Only thing about the first tier of raid content i liked was malygos.  
---
And come on.. apart from ulduar, the ToC raids and ICC were completely piss poor.  Very generic and boring fights overall, with little to no atmospheric design that made sense.   Also so many dailies in wrath that you essentially had to do for BiS enchants... I don't even want to consider doing them again.
---
That's the slow way to level, much faster to intelligently push your luck sometimes. I don't play priests though.
---
There were no oceanic servers in classic wow, so Australia was playing on 200-300 ms latency. If we can do it, you can do it mate!
---
I loved the wrath pre-launch event; trying to infect all the afk people in shatt; so fun

The replies to this thread prove that most people on this subreddit are cry babies lol
---
So? Blizzard can still take not and give them tools to help like a tournament realm. Some losers were trying to grief duels. One set was lost because someone tab targeted and attacked an ally character. Many sets were interrupted by characters standing over duellers so animations weren’t as clear.
---
Serious fun. My friends and I still talk about it.
---
lol this must be a joke since he was 1800 all-star in wotlk
---
I dunno if I would go that far. I've found Esfand to be pretty entertaining to watch as well...
---
This is very inaccurate don’t use this please anyone.
---
If he does it for 5 hours, yes.
---
This is a meme. I’ve seen a lot of protection MTs on pservers at varying levels of content. When taking damage is the issue, prot is correct. When threat is the issue, fury tanking is correct. It’s my belief that a relatively deep prot build is the best when you’re in blues going into MC as MT; DPS is not capped by threat at this point, especially on Alliance (which I’ll be playing, in a guild with many holypalas, so salvation will be up) but you are more likely to get mulched by boss damage and be far from defence cap.
---
Never mind that there are many variations of prot, fury/prot, and arms/prot tanking. I’ve tried 3 different fury tanking builds that all have their pros and cons. If you think there’s 1 best tank specc for all content and phases you’re flat out wrong.

i was playing on a desktop without a gpu. had to RMA my gpu. but it was on a 8700k, which has a uhd 630 integrated gpu. i also have 16GB of ram. if that helps

Relational DKP/Ratio DKP/EQ DKP solves many issues, in particular minimal/no loot drama:    
---
 - Each item won worth 1      
---
 - Each hour raiding worth 1      
---
 - Ratio = Hours Raiding / Items Won + 1  
---
 - This means if you won 10x items, and raided for 30 hours your ratio is: 2.72    
---
 - If someone else won 9x items, and raided 30 hours their ratio is: 3   
---
 - The highest number wins. Therefore 3 is higher than 2.72 and wins the item.     
---
 - Each new expansion divide the hours and items in half **this keeps the ratio order the same** but gives newer members an easier time catching up.   
---
This simply rewards effort in terms of time commitment. It allows newer members to gear up quickly. It also removes decisions from the guild leadership, meaning everyone can see the ratio/items won/hours and knows who will win.
---
Tipsout man.. what the actual fuck is wrong with you?  
---
You cant keep the duelists targeted?!  
---
You keep health bars on for the crowds of players, even when the duelists are too far way to see their bars. Why cant you keep them targeted you retard!  
---
You jump and strafe and move back and fourth like your having a fucking seizure when we're trying to watch!   
---
You can't even keep your fucking camera pointed at the duel!!!  
---
Fuck you for wasting  everyones time and effort when you cant even point your fucking camera at the action properly. There is something seriously wrong with you. How the fuck can you actually be a streamer, yet I have to say all these things! Why do I have to say ANY OF THESE THINGS TO YOU! RETARD
---
post your specs and ill tell you if you can play it
---
Its one of the only classes, besides mages, which can AoE farm while leveling.
---
I call shotgun on Ziltoid on the 13th!
---
Wages haven’t kept up with inflation though
---
When he phased out, I /who him and he was in Mulgore. Either he hearthed or GM ported him. Doubt he wanted to run back.
---
Totem stomp macros were removed in 3.1.2 it's clearly an oversight from blizzard when porting vanilla to the 8.0 client.
---
Don't eat the grains.
---
Also, some people are just poor. 
---
There aren’t really any avenues for me to ‘sort my life out’ that are really feasible. 
---
I can afford wow and nice things here and there, but if I had a kid, for example, or if I lived in a nicer area, I don’t think I could.
---
love to see stuff like this :)
---
Why do they deserve to play the game at all?
---
Some people were saying because Classic is on the Legion client it's not possible. Cdew tested it and could /target his own totems, but wasn't sure if that's just because they're friendly to him. Dunno tho
---
I know just not at the start
---
Emotional why....
---
I think someone got ganked by a lot of gnomes
---
So what do you reccomend using? /roll?
---
This is why birth control is legal. Use it.
---
Think so. I had a clip where it shows 'the dude' getting phased out just before the semis, but the clip got deleted somehow. If I had to guess, Tips manually deleted it so as to not give him any more attention. Which is a good stance. I'd rather focus on how dope the semis and finals were.
---
There were some really good duels! Shame that the duel radius is small enough to get screwed by fears, but that’s life.
---
Venruki was also heavily specced for melee, shaman and Hunter. Priest and Warlock was his worst theoretical matchup.
---
Wow, I feel personally attacked. Don't call me out like this!! I got a spreadsheet mapping out what race/class/professions I want already made, too.  
---
I was a chronic re-roller in vanilla so it was a problem. That being said, I plan to duo level a few of them so hopefully that'll keep the altitis at bay.
---
Yeah but blizzard can nurture and cultivate player driven content while not outrightly interfering with the game. So it would make sense for blizzard to take note and try to recreate atmospheres like this in classic for when it releases.
---
But it shouldn't be. 
---
We have regular bony Undead in EU and NA, so why is blood any different?
---
If you are talking about PvP, you're very misinformed. PvE-wise, it's incredibly simple with all classes in vanilla. And the raids are fairly easy compared to current standards so I don't really see the argument here.
---
Jeez spoilers
---
Any word on one for Oceanic?
---
Hahahahaha, no. It really isn't.
---
does the threat from buffing ppl with battle shout apply even if you've over-writing the same buff?
---
&gt; guess I'm #nochanges now?
---
Might want to get that STD checked out...
---
It works in classic, it didn't work in vanilla.
---
There is recruitment going on r/classicwow discord server and many others
---
Absolutely insane, I had to go halfway through the tournament and I was really hoping Venruki would win and I cant believe he actually did. What a absolute god.

snutz missed a sac, he was trying to health funnel for some reason. lost it there
---
TBC prot was way stronger than vanilla.  The talents and overall class improvements allowed you to pull several enemies at once and slowly kill them, where is in classic you still take too much damage relative to how much you dish out.
---
It wasn't uncommon to see people level as prot and aoe pull.
---
Frost mage is good for both though
---
Um, how in the world can a prot warrior AoE farm pre wrath?
---
Does anyone know if retail WoW and Classic WoW will be covered by the same subscription or will they be separate?
---
The "McIndex" would have been better but what do I know.

*UD mages

well i havent buy any laptop yet since im still in process of selling my desktop rig (2500k + 7950 ). but if u can play it with the igpu i think i can be ok with smth like a gtx1050 laptop version.

why they dont "deserve" ?
---
"and it's never been a bannable offense."
---
"Georgina" has always been a bankable offense.
---
Oh damn that’s dope!
---
The vanilla Endgame and meta was only *TRULY* fleshed out on Private servers and as we all know by now, that data is probably mostly wrong and cannot be trusted.
---
Most of those consumables are super situational. You can grind out a stack one and it will last for a month or longer of raiding (of course depending on how many days you raid). Also very few bother with minor consumables. If you get the jujus, food, elixirs and blasted lands consumables then you will probably already be ahead of 95% of population.
---
The world buffs will generally be gathered before a raid starting with ony head and in later patches also the DM:T buffs and ZG buff. Takes about 30 minutes of prep before every raid.
---
1st and 2nd place venruki and snutz won Arena world championship together.
---
Tied for 3rd place cdew won arena world championship last year.
---
Top tier players are top tier players for a reason
---
Getting banned would be absurd. 
---
In vanilla players raided an [in-game funeral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEpv7YxnLCQ). Watching the video is one of my most memorable moments. 
---
If you're going to be hosting community events, expect community members who want to ruin your fun to do so.
---
So good to see current players translate their skills into classic WoW. They have a great feel for the game. I don't know how someone like Cdew can stream classic in between BFA arena queues and not skip a beat, these guys are really talented. I think we're seeing the beginning of a second golden age of WoW with events like this.
---
Not sure what you mean? I see the clip got deleted, but not by me. Anyone know what is up with that kind of thing?
---
The Snutz one was awesome, but the Cdew one was the closest and by far my favorite. Thought he was out when he polyed the Alliance.
