Ahh, just able to be slowed during those 18 sec then

---
No, he's not correcting my .25, he's correcting 7.25%. I just failed at math somehow.
---
Imagine citing Staysafe as your source. Joke of a player.
---
Yea!
---
yes the priest shields the warlock who pulls everything with Eye of Kilrog
---
My pc wasn't good enough to run fraps and wow at the same time :(
---
SM has most of the BiS, they know the cap is 40 and there will be more shenanigans, like another tourney
---
Hey there. We are [Hero Association], its a guild formed by a bunch of real life friends (of which i am not one, haha, but i am one of the officers) - its a friendly guild that doesnt go hardcore, but still plans to consistently clear content. One of my personal regrets in original vanilla was not seeing enough content - even though i later caught up and went to be pretty well progressed with multiple server firsts - so i will most definitely be trying to push towards strong progression - although we will still focus on a laid back atmosphere. 
---

---
The raid times are 20:30-23:30 UK time (so 21:30-00:30 server time), although days are unconfirmed yet (at least 3 days though). We will be on EU PVE servers. Let me know if you're interested or have any questions - and i could give you a discord invite!
---
Our main tank slot is currently closed, but we have plenty of dps and healer slots open (and some offtank slots as well!).
---
Bottle-necking from hundres of players trying to lvl at the same time. Also a lot of people were insanely geared for lvl 30s since they were locked at 30 for a month. Clearing dungeons at a good speed is more xp/hr compared to fighting for mob tags since they can clear dungeons with ease.
---
Yup, it's fine so long as they fit the theme and don't expand WoW to.. "certain" types of vocal, annoying people.
---
thats pretty nifty
---
Keep the 50g for respec, raise it to 100g so it's even more meaningful, but allow dualspec so certain classes don't get shafted.
---
Arms warrior literally cannot participate in raids.
---
They're extremely overgeared for level 30, which makes farming dungeons more efficient for leveling than questing and grinding.
---
Probably not worth going over board at the moment. As the beta opens up more and more and more addon makers get in and start updating/making things it'll change a lot. In 2 months what addons will be available will be completely different compared with now.  
---
  
---
 
---
More than likely the last stress test or the last couple weeks of beta everyone who has opted in will get in and it'll be free play for 2-3 days. That'll be the time to get all your addons setup in client and you'll be ready to go for launch.
---
You jelly bro?
---
That may be true, but we're talking about bias here. Blizzard obviously didn't intend for people to travel to Menethil that way.
---
Navak, first horde to 30 (on a warrior no less) twitch.tv/navashed and Ayle, twitch.tv/AyleGaming 
---
They are kind of in the same clique as Kargoz. Navak is their best leveler and works with Ayle on making their guide, which should be released soonish
---
NO
---
Oh man the days of a 12 pack of mtn dew code red sitting beside me was so unhealthy but so good!
---
You can read some drama on /World in the Beta. I read about some Warrior leaving a Group beacause a Rogue rolled on the SFK Ring with Strength.
---
Wow, hunter pretty low on the list. Guess i'll be playing hunter!
---
Can you explain how rogue solo leveling is efficient? Stealth detection is ridiculous without speccing 5 points into sub, so your opener is generally nullified. Tanking a few mobs at once is difficult based on evasion being a 5 min cd. Just want to hear your opinion which could help me grasp how its better?
---
Keep the cost of respeccing but allow dualspec so you can actually do something on the days where you don't raid.
---
Good, Fewer hunters the better more gear for me. People are too worried about min-maxing.
---
I haven't played retail in ages, but are you sure on this? The website lists several examples, including consistent use of 'ppp' being translated to 'vil'. Given that such a letter combination still gives a consistent outcome, I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to write things without having to resort to unicode garbage.
---
If I have to make a guess then the only reason this site likes to utilise unicode characters is because it gives a greater range of individual letters. The algorithm probably just tries to get each letter one-by-one whenever possible, as such the preference towards whatever single character can generate the desired character, even if that is unicode.
---
Example: If you ask the site to translate "youre evil", which in the example is translated with "3 1 p 12 2 ppp" except the website now gives you "3 1 p ‡ 2 2 ppp". This just looks like algorithm being biased towards single letters. Moreover, it's probably biased towards numbers too because it probably just goes over them starting with 0-9 and then a-z, etc. The website also shows me that some stuff still translates to the same things, so I see no reason why it would be any different nowadays. The fact that we're not seeing "familiar" phrases out of this website just seems to be the result of how the algorithm works.
---
Was just wondering the reason is all?
---
what the fuck mate.
---
*I'm Mr. T, and I'm a Night Elf Mohawk*

---
^^***CUT!***
---
Female gnome = loli
---
Sword weapon skills are better imo.  Also 10% rep is pretty op.
---
Wow thanks I'll definitely check out the chronicles. It's fascinating that undead priest was my main in classic and I know almost nothing about the lore. Thanks for the info!
---
But why would you use a different keybind for stealth abilities? Ambush and Backstab should be the same at least...
---
^***Cut!***
---
&gt; you can buy the same thing on amazon for $50
---
Asking someone to prove their claim is not moving the goalpost, but gg I guess
---
I think it's a combination of a bunch of things. 
---
-There's a big bottleneck of players at level 30 all trying to do the same quests and also pvp which makes normal questing more difficult. Streamers probably deal with being bothered by pvpers more than your average player too.
---
-Lots of people completed the 30s quests for gold while they were capped, so they literally don't have any quests to do right now.
---
-They have crazy twink gear, and the group comp and specs (they removed respec cost) to support these crazy speed aoe runs, which makes them particularly efficient.
---
&gt; no-changed problem
---
But... there were no RPPvP servers at launch in 2004...
---
I agree that an RPPvP server would have a solid comminity - and Bliz should definitely add one. But saying it's a "no changes" issue is a bit disingenuous. Demand and demand one. Don't give up.
---
So my druid was herb/skin, and depending on what I was doing I would flip.
---
One was instance farming with my guild, and we just pooled everything on me (the healer) who auctioned it, totaled it all up and distributed the money from the sales. The reason why I pooled it all on me as our team was geared, so I would just use heals over time on our tank and he would run forward with the DPS who would start pounding through trash, while I lagged behind and collected everything that was green/cloth and all the blues went to our mage who disenchanted it all. (We were all in T1 or better, so we needed nothing from those instances)
---
When running solo, herb is great for farming, especially as a druid you can harvest while in travel form, while not super fast, 40% is better than having to dismount every 5 feet and waiting 2 seconds for the cast bar to fill back up. (You can get pvp gear which increases travel form up to 55% move speed)
---
Skinning for rugged leather is nice too, there's a number of locations throughout the world you can farm really quickly and efficiently for leather, and it sells pretty good.
---
Even while resto, I had a set of feral gear that nobody else usually wanted, so I just threw it on, went cat and clawed stuff down.
---
Druid gear is mostly stat sticks (stats dictate your in-form damage, not the ilevel of your weapon), so while your weapon may not be the best, you still do enough damage to solo.
---
Combine this with self sustain (heal/innervate for mana) you can go for long periods of time without stopping.
---
Eye of Kilrog is a cute trick. For a massive pull you'd be better off with a pally to bubble to group them all up then you just nova/ imp blizzard from max range. You can literally do 50 mobs this way without any mage taking a single hit.
---
And still leaving wholesome notes for each other?   
---
Damn that's awesome. Good on you two! :D   
---
Here's to many more years of love 🥂
---
FOR THE HORDE! If your icon is any indication of your class you want to play.... COW &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NIGHT ELF!
---
Yeah, Undead Priest was my main during WotLK. I was a guild leader and needed something to remind me why I play the game in the first place, so I took a deep dive into the lore. The running joke was "don't let Geo tell stories during raids or we'll be here all night".
---
Good to see that at least staysafe has a brain.
---
They did, imbecile.
---
Definitely agree
---
It's $42 to have 88 caps made. I don't plan on using separate caps. I just want to get my money's worth.
---
I had to do a triple take. Totally forgot about that till now.
---
Scarlet Monastery is such a fun instance though! One of my favorites back in Vanilla.
---
You can group and split loot, farm lashers in ele spec, or make a hunter alt.
---
These guys all have max engineering, you won't have that when leveling on launch. They all have gear that makes some classes have HP similar to what they would normally have at 60 in normal 60 questing gear. The dungeons being easy isn't the issue here, its the fact that these level 30s-39s are using gear they normally wouldnt acquire while leveling as well as professions. You think you'll see a full party with engineering grenades like this during launch? GL
---
Anything is viable, just might not be optimal.
---
It would be alot faster to just not stealth, just straight up to them and smash them with SS with a hard hitting MH.
---
Lol
---
&gt; Even with perception a human won't find win the opening on a 5/5 imp stealth rogue if the human is 0/5
---
I don't think you realize how good Perception is. It's 50 Stealth Levels of detection (Drink a Catseye for an extra 10 levels) for a total of 12 levels. Few Rogues will run around with 5/5 MoD (which only provides 5 levels of stealth), so a level 60 Human can detect a level 60 Rogue as if the Rogue was level 48 (or 53 with MoD). That's a huge advantage.
---
&gt; In fact, a catseye goggle nightelf will beat a 5/5 stealth human if he doesn't have goggles, so there's some issues.
---
No he wouldn't.
---
&gt; All that does too is win the opener; ideally you're garroting an orc rogue, but with iffy ping and sprint, you gotta go for the tab cheapshot route.
---
Rogue openers were literally the single most important aspect of the class. Without their opener they could very quickly get killed or kited.
---
&gt; Then it gets bad - if he DOES resist that CS your entire advantage is blown, all the while he still has a great shot at resisting you.
---
That's why you play smart and kite when you can.
---
&gt;  but yeah no fuck playing vanilla rogues, you're just asking to become food for a warrior/hunter/shaman/priest/warlock/druid
---
Yeah that's pretty unfortunate.
---
i cant wait for tbc and wotlk to come out as well, lock was so much fun back then
---
&gt; The running joke was "don't let Geo tell stories during raids or we'll be here all night".
---
Haha that's great. Would you advice starting with the wow chronicles if I get into the lore, or would you suggest something else to begin with?
---
Oh I don't believe anyone was touting vanilla as difficult, it's always just been more time consuming :)
---
High expectation is not a curse feral Druids have to suffer.
---
That's on you to YouTube - I'm not digging through 2004-2006 Vanilla videos just to find the jokes and puns about resists, immunities, profession failures, etc.
---
All endgame herbs are orange at 300. Orange has a chance to fail which you learn your first time gathering herbs in starter zones.
---
Vanilla has enchants and gear for herbalism to up the stat. Max is 325 with a Tauren.
---
There's a reason for that. You can believe it or not. I don't care. A little bit of Google goes a long way with plenty of guides saying the same thing.
---
Do your own legwork.
---
Smooth leveling, shaman. Everything else you listed, warrior. Warrior is top tier dps, highly gear dependent. Not healing as a shaman will put limits on your gameplay, as well as potential difficulty in obtaining gear
---
Not boxing? Fake channel!
---
Wait, really?  I feel like weapon damage would matter a lot for Rets.  It's only a potent end game consumable for druids because weapons are only stat sticks for them.
---
I was also a 12 year old in vanilla who raided mc and bwl as a hunter main, but I don’t remember a damn thing lol. I do remember kiting being exhilarating, at least.
---
If they aren't playing Orc rogue they're doing it wrong tbh.
---
I was expecting Lich King to throw us off Hell In A Cell, and we plummet 16 ft through an announcer's table. Or a Loch Ness Monster.
---
The one in Ratchet is a high elf, yes. In Classic he uses the crappy Classic high elf model, but in TBC he uses the blood elf model.
---
Just wait till you get over lvl 20 and you can start aoe grinding it is so satisfying
---
Join the classic pvp discord. There might be a place where everyone can practice PvP at level 60 in equal gear.
---
No doubt mor’ladim has millions of kills
---
You already have to do this for Mythic and keystones.
---
How is that op for pvp?
---
Ironforge. One of the main reasons I'm struggling to stick to playing Horde is that the Alliance cities and zones are just so good. Orgrimmar, nasty.
---
I’m sure there will be an addon like gatherer that would largely mitigate this issue
---
They went over a lot of them in one of the most recent countdown to classic podcasts
---
Some of them blew my mind. Like the wolf at Arathi Basin blacksmith being named Lady.
---
Alliance has the best questing, the best cities and the joy of Paladins.
---
Sadly my friends decided to play the wrong faction, but you don't have to.
---
Gotta say this repetetive SM farming on every stream is really lame.
---
Lol a lot of people saying it won't be done in classic at launch but they are so wrong... the level cap increase yesterday was the perfect example of the bottle-necking and I CAN'T WAIT!
---
Going to be hilarious when these streamers keep saying "under 1 week I'll be 60, and I'm going to get ahead at launch"
---
We'll see :)
---
Oh god oh fuck Hand of Rag. I would fucking DIE
---
I could stream two zone chats but the music will sound terrible :(
---
Wait until you start making rank 2 water.
---
Game changer
---
The best feared players will be pvers, by in large. 
---
Sure your server will have potentially 52 hwl/gm a year per faction. 104 folks with weps. After an entire year you’ve got one raid team and substitutes...not exactly a common phenomenon to run up against them.
---
But when av comes out mc will have been around for months oebs, bre, and spinal are all better than unstoppable force. And bwl comes out same day, drake talon cleavers, Ashkandis and untamed blades will show up on Wednesday the night after top guilds clear bwl for the first time. There may be 0 there may be 4 rank14s. And an exalted is at least a lockout away.
---
You’re over blowing it. If you absolutely never want to get outplayed by gear, go play csgo or heroes of the storm. Gear disparity is a necessary and desirable part of mmos.
---
The ilvl of items in classic at max level goes from 62 to 81 by the end of bwl. That’s not an unamanagable power creep over two tiers. Talented folks in blues can still kill t1/2 geared players of average skill.
---
Joana even stated himself somewhere on his website something to the effect of other players being competitive with him as he has not played in some time.
---
There are people who have been speed running Joana's route for probably as many hours as Joana has, more recently, and with private server meta information which may or may not be irrelevant. All I'm saying is, I'm not counting out the private server speed runners until world first is made.
---
Paladin is downright miserable to level. Seal judge seal auto for 10 seconds.... Judge seal auto for 10 seconds..... Over and over.
---
Shaman wont be overplayed in comparison to warriors, rogues, mages, but they are in high demand for raiding, so you wont have trouble in the regard. Warrior and shaman leveling combo is a steamroller, it really picks up with WF. the more you play with totems, the easier and more intuitive it becomes. 
---
Druid though is highly versatile, crazy survivability. It's very nice having stealth and heals, you can get into a lot of hijinks with a druid.
---
Hey thanks for the detailed reply, that’s really what I want to hear! I’m really enjoying levelling my Druid and obviously it will change at 60 but the versatility seems awesome.
---
[removed]
---
True, but Classic isn't being released as it was launched in 2004. 1.12 balance, flightpaths, quests (minus those affected by endgame content release of course) etc.
---
It's a no changes issue if you played on one. #nochanges is about recreating the same game we all fell in love with back in vanilla. Without RPPVP, those of us who played on one will be missing a vital chunk of that experience.
---
Jeffery, if you're on here, please keep uploading.  These clips are so fucking entertaining!
---
Yes i am not sure if i should cry or rage im that jealous so ill just keep quiet haha
---
And the king of Stormwind will be- oh.
---
People may end up doing the same thing they are doing now. Just dungeon grinding for a bit. If you have a solid group that you are going to be playing with for hours, its not a bad option around the 30+ level range. But ya, getting past the surge of starting zones is going to be hell.
---
Priest has a lot of spell variety. Shamans mostly spam varying ranks, if totem twisting is a reality you will be dropping 2 totems every 8 seconds. Druid mostly spams healing touch.
---
New Bug: Button Missing and therefore does not work.
---
Wasnt the Alliance one basically Voltage, or is that something different entirely?
---
TIL leveling stops at level 40.  What's the point of even arguing with such idiocy?
---
Quick! Someone theorycraft for me! Databases are haaaard
---
I saw that for individual posts, but not the parent post.  Apparently I'm missing something, I'll look harder.  Thanks!
---
Please god
---
MT is a sought after position, and also one that requires the most dedication than any other role in the raid. In case that swings your feelings at all. Shaman warrior is amazing. You dont even need to go full resto and you guys will crush.
---
This post made me happy. I hate the votekick system and how it made people disposable. If someone is underperforming, we need to be encouraged to help them and not get rid of them in two clicks.
---
Level 30 taking on mid to low level 20s. I wouldnt say this guy is doing anything special.
---
There won't be this kind of bottleneck at 30 though, this was caused by the artificial level cap. People who get ahead of the curve early will definitely have a leveling advantage since they'll have higher level zones mostly to themselves.
---
How many times you going to post this?
---
What are you using? PC or mobile?
---
[Behold the fruits of gnomish intellect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvybmpNIDPQ).
---
That would work if server time zones were able to be seen without logging into the server.
---
It’s much more likely they release server names before name reservation period.
---
It’s all downhill from 26.
---
Yup, I thought about getting back into Magic, but it's just too expenisive.
---
People always talk about how "hardcore" vanilla wow is.
---
I think it's because all of these people never played it and are actually in their early 20s right now. When WoW was released, it was the most popular computer game EVER. Why was that?
---
Because of how easily accessible and new-player friendly it was. it brought in so many people from outside of the MMO community it was unbelievable. People who didn't even know what an MMO was started playing and absolutely loved it. People who didn't even play computer games started playing!
---
This whole "hardcore" mentality is just silly
---
Exact keyboard I had, so nostalgic.
---
Time goes slow at 22 cause you probably don’t do dick.
---
Time goes fast at 42 cause you’ve got a career, wife, kids, house, social commitments, etc.
---
Aka sure it does by...but it’s not like you’ve got hours to spend on wow...that’s why time goes by so fast.
---
Only ones that get ahead at the start are those lucky enough to log in first.
---
Whoever does get ahead will be able to keep that lead, it's just funny that all the streamers assume they will get ahead.
---
Even though they probably will since they'll have priority login lolol.
---
just walk there after you hit 16-18?
---
Its more that the first boss has optional difficulty, with bonus rewards, but also gates the instance.
---
Classic actually had this with Alliance side Razorgore to some extent.  Would you do the fight normally to make your raid less shit, or would you DI cheese him to get on with the rest of the raid.
---
Doubt it.
---
Thanks I deleted the other post.
---
That’s nice, honey
---
While they are also fighting mobs.
---
And also sounding like he is giving out commands to a 5v5 Arena team while on Adderall, but it's really just him narrating himself.
---
I am broadly pro steamer but what exactly did this clip add? He just says yes.
---
Ironically, these were the last thing I remember drinking before being diagnosed with diabetes.
---
The commentary is what gets me.  Yeah the PvP is good, but his commentary is so fun
---
Any reason for the original game fuel I’m on board with
---
Discord.
---
Thanks, I have read that info in the past.  However, that info was written many years after 1.12.  There were other changes made to glancing blows and weapon skill during TBC, so I am hesitant to believe that the newer info holds true for Blizzard's 1.12.  We will find out soon enough.
---
Fwiw, a lot of people did testing during retail vanilla and there was a consensus.  It was thought that glancing blows reduced damage by up to 30%, which each point of weapon skill lessening that reduction by 3%.
---
Absolutely 100% agree. Doesn't matter how good of a group it is... They could be horrible players, but the time away from doing effective grinding in a dungeon takes away a huge portion of the xp. I tend to do a quick 5 min break in between a dungeon or two myself...absolutely no need for it to be any longer or consistent unless kids/family are involved.
---
Ooph
---
People were talking about the laughably easy dungeons way before they got to 30 and got geared. It was a huge topic of discussion few weeks ago if you missed it.
---
You got me. Once I started reading. Immediately was singing it in my head.
---
Yea but they have barrens chat.
---
Makes sense from s lore perspective too.
---
The horde banded together by necessity. They were being persecuted by “alliance forces” 
---
The alliance only ever came about out of necessity when green bloodthirsty demon things invaded their world. 
---
The alliance races fought eachother before Orcs ever showed up...hence the alliance. 
---
They are much closer to a strictly military alliance where the horde appears to integrate culture and military cohesion.
---
You stick out like a sore thumb as a shadow priest. You will melt faces 1v1 but will be higher on the focus fire list. Mages and Warlocks will outdamage you, but you have AoE fear, dispell, etc. Utility spells. I don't remember disengaging much to go drink, I was usually Focus Fired in the crowd :(
---
This is so much true. Challenges are really everywhere in vanilla.
---
Every single dungeon can wipe a group if not played quite well or over-leveled. Most crafting professions also require quite some effort to max on the first months. Some recipes are actually very rare and some stay relevant for a very long time. There's also the needed-to-be-overcome challenge of socializing in order to get anything serious done, be it PvP or raids.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
These demanding activities are a joy to do much more than weekly quests, daily boat faction missions or the island expeditions. The only thing remotely still fun in BfA for me are the time-walks (funnily enough, the best was BC).
---
Yea I think Blizzard and the gaming industry in general is going down a rabbit hole that shows incompetence in my opinion. They may have good individual ideas but it means nothing when you have shitty leadership that only cares for a bottom line.
---
All of my faith in Blizzard has been sucked dry over the years, and the fact there is a chance for them to give me a time-capsule of my favourite era of gaming - your damned fucking right I don’t want them messing it all up.
---
Ill take Tbc and Lk no changes to avoid the chance of them fucking up those with shitty design choices. All it takes is one bad change to irreparably destroy the game - just fucking leave it.
---
Is it freezing cold outside ?
---
KEK
---
At this point, they just need to find out how much demand their is for Classic.
---
They have years before they need to release new content.
---
I'm a big fan of his stream
---
Thank you for the kind words bud ! I'm just the average dude playing this game and loving the social aspect of it like us all. See you in Azeroth !
---
They are also insanely geared compared to a player that just hit level 30. Couple that with dirt cheap respecs, and maxed engineering, and you've got something that isn't really doable to the same extent when the game is live.
---
Just figured it out.  I don't know how I missed it lol!  Thanks again man.  :)
---
FWIW in tbc and onward weapon skill no longer effected glancing blow damage reduction. They also got rid of it on items in exchange for expertise.
---
SOME
---
That feel when level 30 and no hat
---
Vanilla graphics have character, life and a timeless style. No games come out with a style like that because it’s hard to pull off. 
---
Blizzard updated the graphics and completely botched the character designs and animations in the process. 
---
If you like the new models go play retail
---
i cured my kid of autism with sweet nectar

I accidently pulled a mob in a Utguarde Keep today leveling my mage (blinked the wrong way) and got kicked 30 seconds later.

Ah, well in that case:
---
* Pick Lock and Pick Pocket
---
* The 5 poisons
---
- Ghostly Strike
---
- PVP Trinket
---
- Mount (this could take up 6-7 depending if you want one for every available type)
---
- Ranged Attack (that's 4)
---
- Grenade
---
- Food
---
- Professions (that's at least Poisons, Fishing, Cooking, First Aid, and then whatever non-gathering you think you might take)
---
- Hearthstone
---
- Thistle Tea
---
- Health Potion
---
- Map
---
- Character Pane, Spellbook, Talents, Guild, Social
---
Just do that 20 times per level!
---
Online. Up to like ZF you can have a shaman or ret paladin tank just fine. 
---
At Sunken Temple it gets a lot harder, too many big hitting mobs.
---
A group of 5 priests could do WC, DM, SFK, BFD
---
We aren't talking about the other dungeons are we though? We are specifically talking about how a group of all cloth wearers are easily farming a dungeon a few levels higher than them. If you think they will be able to do this even half as easy or effiently with the same comp at launch without the gear and engineering, you are in got a bad time.
---
&gt; That would work if server time zones were able to be seen without logging into the server.
---
You don't need a list of server names to pick a timezone.

Noticing how past Launches went in WoW specifically. They were garbage for Warlords and BFA. So if they give us a Legion Launch we're good. If it's the other two it'll be a hellhole but then again nobody is clicking on a garrison flag or joining an instance for a scenario so we may be fine.
---
Of course, but it's different.
---
Nobody has priority log in what?
---
Mind sharing where you plan on getting them from? I've been interested in custom keycaps but haven't been able to find them reasonably priced anywhere.
---
Yes. Deathwing
---
But I thought dungeons were to easy and everyone would breeze through the content. Did they lie? :(
---
Yep. Deathwing
---
hardest choice of all
---
always mained rogue and raided multiple expansions
---
alted druid vanilla but no LFG i didnt actually experience that much tanking with it 
---
shammy healer i leveled 100% through LFG if i could (newer expansions actually require you to quest for next itemlevel instances)
---
played deathknight tanking through LFG 20 levels and kinda liked it beeing a tank and all, + it did nuts dmg so kinda nuts really
---
leveled warrior 10 levels through expansion free level gain
---
leveled disc healing pries through expansion and geared it
---
leveled mage through expansion but never had a feel to further level it
---
i dont really care about pve end game or pvp since i already kinda had it both
---
mostly thinking about hunter (solo farm ,maybe profession rep farm) or druid pre-bis raid gear (mostly tank but i guess you could get anything during it, and obviously access to 5 man groups)
---
i guess 20 mans interest me too since i hardly did those either beeing overgeared and such but with druid i prob wouldnt want to tank or heal and hunter i dont know. it was just easier beeing overgeared rogue and do dps and not care about anything but i also not felt contributing other than that dps... what class is most fun those pug raids?
---
i guess druid could be flexible and also farm but its also 2nd class i played vanilla  (not finished) :S. Maybe just get 60 and experience it from there? Maybe make friends and fill whats needed?
---
They left those jumps/areas in the game, I don't think they would consider those wall jumps to be exploits. If they did they would've removed the wall jumps from WSG
---
Disc priest probably isn’t a thing like you think it is. 
---
I mean yeah there’s a 31/20 build...but you’re still spending 99% of your time cancel casting single target heals. 
---
There’s healing and shadow priests. You have slightly different tool and your power is focused a bit differently, but gameplay among all healing priest specs is pretty similar. 
---
So I mean if you knew that, ignore me, but if you thought it was a spec that spams boubles and shit, this spec that is not.
---
Sadly there will still be people who won't realize that until it's too late.
---
I mained a Shaman through the entirety of Vanilla, I raided MC through Naxx, and helped a Mage friend of mine grind out High Warlord. 
---
I would say that Shaman are tons of fun, aside from having a huge range of abilities during PvE and PvP encounters, you also have a lot of abilities that assist with exploration, if you’re into that sort of thing. You’ll probably be stuck healing for raids but aside from just spamming healing spells, you also have totems to manage. In dungeons you can find a spot as DPS, and in PvP both Elemental and Enhancement deliver huge bursts of damage. Leveling up is relatively smooth, (albeit a bit slow) as you can usually move quickly from one target to the next.
---
The only people who want 10k concurrent are the mopes who thought nostalrius was blizz like.
---
Yah I feel like the fact that we don't have sharding in the starter zones = shit show.
---
However - if they use the layering as sharding (which they most likely will) for the starting zones only- we'll be fine.
---
But to think that just have 4 or 5 layers will do the trick - it won't. 
---
Those layers still have a cap and that cap being 2,3,4k players (whatever they choose) it's still thousands of players spread across 6 starter zones.
---
If you're interested in pvp, take engineering. Much more beneficial for any class.
---
Maxkeyboards is what I'm looking at. 
---
A Friend's wife is making me some printed vinyl stickers first to see where I want stuff, then I'll have them made.
---
Make sure you pay attention to the size/layout of your bottom row, they differ from each other depending on your keyboard.
---
After levelling BS and LW on a PS. I say that this will be very hard because you usually need mats form higher level zones to craft level appropriate gear. Ex: needing iron to craft level 28 armor
---
Over 300 is less important than getting 150 five, ten, fifteen levels early.
---
It really feels like the classic team is not even a part of current (Activision-)Blizzard. It's so strange to see them actually working with the community when we've all gotten used to nu-Blizzard's methods over the years.
---
Damn alliance and their tram!
---
Problem is you have to know a Rogue is coming for perception to be useful at preventing the opener. A good Rogue doesn't let you know they're coming.
---
It all depends what kind of reader you are. If you want a story, the Chronicles aren't great, they're more of an encyclopedia (though I certainly read them cover to cover). A lot of the novels tell great stories, but they're not directly related to your character or even the timeline we'll be playing in. Some of them are pretty bad (I can't stand Richard Knaak but everything Christie Golden wrote is excellent.
---
And if you want something to listen to or watch, Nobbel87's YouTube channel cannot be beat. He is *the* expert and very entertaining.
---
My first character was an Engineer, and I loved every moment of it, my friend hated me using my shrinking ray in fights, and pvp was a blast with my netomatic projector.  But no one complained when I saved a wipe with jumper cables.
---
A profound statement
---
Assuming and knowing that there are 6 starting zones and multiple layers i Assume you'll be able to quest reasonably.
---
You think a Shadow Priest is pulling off the MT in vanilla due to healing threat?   
---
&gt; Aside from mana issues threat is one of the other major shadow priest problems.   
---
Only for the first 30~ seconds.
---
we were barely able to achieve the gearing goals in vanilla because of the time issue, people with average lives literally couldn't do the content because it was time gated, not skill gated
---
the only issue vanilla ever had was that, which is what caused retail, they went to far on the opposite end for gear
---
Early Cata had a pretty decent system where you could eventually progress from wherever you were stuck just by doing as much as you could every week and eventually either outgearing the next boss or meeting a nerfed version of him a few months after the raid's release. I always felt that this was a better solution than LFR or a small % of the player base ever seeing the fight.
---
And that they're going to be bottlenecked at 40 and will need the loot from sm anyways
---
I don’t have much time to play either, I plan on rolling a Shaman and healing, it will make dungeon groups a lot quicker to find, in addition to raiding spots. Find yourself a Tank friend and the world is your oyster.
---
Nah, Joana will be WR again.
---
The only question worthwhile about quests is ones that were added in later phases, or particularly are the Jintha Alor ones. Alliance, I believe gets a rare spell power cape. Horde gets a melee dps trinket.
---
Just because of your zealous certainty of this, I hope you're wrong.
---
Great suggestions, thanks!

I think the build stacks spell power for on-hit damage. MCP simply doubles your dps for 30s ( the physical DPS difference is almost negligible compared to what else you might use, ie lokamir)

Questing in Darkshore:
---
"fuck, I only have 2 6 slot bags and one of them is filled completely with sea creature bones."
---
My problem is the conversion didn't stick true to what the models looked like and this pic illustrates that completely. When I looked at my old characters on the Retail select screen, they were no longer the characters I created. Same goes for that screenshot.   
---
The Vanilla Human looks stern, thick eyeliner darkening her eyes and thin brows drawn down to make her expression harsher. The Retail version is wide eyed almost shocked looking with lighter lips and no dark eye make up, looks surprised and her hair doesn't even lay the same way with less curl.  
---
With the NE, it's almost the opposite. The Vanilla one has soft facial features, but she still looks serious enough. The Retail one, her expression looks harsher and her face in general is plumper with a sharper nose and lips.  
---
Neither of them look like the same character.
---
assuming GRRM didnt have that planned from when he started the series
---
stream snipers
---
Didn't they change the recipe though?
---
I thought that was pvp only that could only be one faction. If not, good to know!
---
Stormreaver was day 1 launch..pretty sure it was a rp-pvp server.
---
Green ring with stats including dodge, nice for rogue 29 twink
---
Oh ok, thanks! ❤️
---
Unfortunately I think people would bitch to hard. Remember when you had to actually discover the entrance to a dungeon? That didn't last long before people complained until it was removed
---
Make Tauren fem orc imo can’t go wrong with either
---
I feel you but just because something is tedious and long doesn't mean it's always better. I think EQ could be really punishing which also made it fun, but I think it also had a lot of faults. Putting together raids and endgame content stuff in EQ was a chore. Which made the success of doing it well a great feat of coordination and organization.
---
Vanilla WoW compared to modern WoW definitely had this requirement of dedication and involvement, but on a more accessible level.
---
I think EQ was in many ways, too punishing. WOW managed to take EQ and find a balance between accessible and difficult. Vanilla WoW 40 Mans definitely felt like a serious commitment but just playing WoW was more forgiving than EQ.
---
I think Vanilla WoW and B.C. had some of the best balance between these two and is why they were so successful.
---
Recent WOW and MMO's in general have really failed to tackle the balance between accessibility and success from major commitments to the game.
---
More trinkets:
---
- Badge of the Swarmguard

- Jom Gabbar

I don’t think I’ve ever said no to a blizzard cinematic.

It never felt like we were doing alternate versions. Just the one, hard version that was relevant to us at 70. Maybe that's why it worked so well.

Yawn

[deleted]
---
Where's watcher Dodds?
---
But a pre-rendered epic trailer sure would be awesome though...
---
Just because there is a specific way to mitigate it does not mean that it isn't griefing.
---
You said there's plenty of videos, and I already stated how the +skill racials work and that removing fail chance doesn't have anything to do with it. The burden of proof is on you my friend.
---
I dunno, are all those extra mounts really worth it if theres no system to track them like the collections we have now?  Gotta remember, all those mounts take up your already limited bag space.
---
Sounds like you should play battle royales
---
Wait, is this another thing that has been removed in recent versions of the game?
---
This isn't super accurate.  
---
His spec had +85% crit chance on an ambush putting him at 90% before crit from agi.  
---
Elusiveness doesn't give you twice as many sprints/evasions, it's 1.5 min cooldown off of 5 minutes.  
---
But really you're acting like opening a fght with a crit ambush wouldn't have any impact when in reality if you're similar level to the mob it can be upwards of half its health.  The point of this spec is to kill enemies faster not to facetank them better.  
---
Also there are two viable strategies for the spec and one is either gouge followed by backstab followed by eviscerate which can kill a mob, or alternatively to use a swap macro and ss or hemo the mob down after the opener.
---
uhhh Game of Thrones was published in the mid 90s
---
You need to log in to know what server the time zone is in though. Even on retail you can’t see time zone for servers.
---
I wouldn't listen to the naysayers man.
---
It's not right, the eye is supposed to have like 5 hp but it has thousands. Shouldn't be usable to pull large groups
---
there is am item in game called Axe of the Iron price and if you click on the pandas guarding the wall in pandaria they will say "We are the watchers on the wall."
---
Imo aoe grinding and grinding in general is quite cathartic
---
Thank you 90th person today who apparently can’t grasp I made a mistake...
---
Maybe a max level character with absurdly hard to get card game rewards/collectors edition/tier 3. It's not like a base 60 with no gear was worth close to that much =p
---
I did it in a stress test. You'll be able to at least see that the addons load when you are able to reserve your name on the 14th. A lot of the addons work on retail too.
---
This is true but we can also throw a bunch of other criteria in that they also don't have that they could. What if instead of a warlock they had another mage for more novas / aoe. What if instead of a priest they had a paladin that could bubble and gather up even more mobs.  
---
I get what you're saying that you cant just gather up any 4 casters and aoe every dungeon down. But I also think you're overplaying the difficulty of a few people wanting to aoe dungeons being able to easily do it.
---
Wow so alpha even when your wrong. Why are you obsessed with incel?
---
Because it's by far the superior flavor over the blue alliance one.  The horde game fuel is one of the tastiest mountain dews, just behind Livewire and Whiteout.
---
Yes. No immersion breaking "versions" of a boss.  Either you kill a boss or you don't.  Nothing killed raiding for me more than when they made all these different modes and difficulties and players for the same boss.  
---
Hard to get excited about seeing the inside of a raid when every scrub on the server can just click their LFR button and AFK kill the biggest villains in Azeroth
---
All I'm saying is that you have more options than the Horde :P Doesn't mean you have to collect all of them :D
---
Ah you're right, I had retail cooldown numbers in my head. Oops.
---
His spec gives +45% crit to Ambush, what am I missing?
---
All I know is my gut says maybe.
---
&gt; Yet, to their owners, they are still not doing good enough. 
---
This is just capitalism and greed man. We just hate it when they invade art and start fucking with it to appeal to as many people as possible, thus making more money. It happened to music, movies, and as gamers have noticed in the last few years, it has now happened to gaming.
---
But it’s magnetic and it breaks done for easy use, and it smells good, and and and....
---
Mining if you go engineering and want to cut the cost a bit
---
Lol I really am a Paladin, that's funny.
---
I mean people can use any rules they want for a duel tourney. More than likely the better pvpers will adopt the rules from private servers is my bet
---
Classic is harder because people be dying to bleach.
---
The only time I experienced a crowd so bustling in a zone that it prohibited progression on retail was rolling a draenei on day 1 of BC. I've seen loads of private servers where the starting zones were packed.
---
10k would be batshit insane.
---
pwnd?
---
Back in the day gaming for 14 hours daily was unheard of. 
---
Its common now.
---
That's exactly what I did / planning on doing!
---
4h20m blaze it
---
Dungeon spamming... the classiccast boys have transitioned to full retail mode
---
Honestly I want them to re release the 'tropical smash' dew.
---
Streamers are for entertainment, not testing.
---
Hopefully the other people in Beta are actually doing testing.
---
its actually easier now to hit max level and people still by character boosts
---
Ah fuck I wanna join now!
---
Is that the one with the bladestorm spins?
---
So what? You know what type of realm and timezone you want to be in.
---
On August 12th, one person reads the list, sees the realm that matches up with these two factors, and announces it to the group.
---
😂😂
---
how the fuck do i even type those letters
---
ya thats why i deleted the message after i saw others typed it allready
---
do you know the meaning of instant gratification? Sure, 1 year to endgame is a lot longer than a few months, but by no means is classic wow instant gratification. Not even close. Instant gratification is nu-WoW where you can *literally* buy a 110 (and at the end of the xpac, a 120 if you pre order...) and start endgame content within a few hours of playing for the first time. And if you don't buy it, you can level up in no time at all.
---
NE Warrior (Prot) or Human Paladin (Heals)?
---
I know Prot can be kind of slow but I may have a leveling buddy or two.
---
I was just thinking that. Thotbot was my best friend! Totally forgot about it.
---
1) It is based on server time, so maybe, but maybe only 1 hour.
---
2) People seem to think there will be a chest there when the servers first come online, based on the stress test servers.  Many people are planning to speed run there at level one.  Spread the word, so there can be a massive level one PvP fest.
---
Let's pretend there are 3k player caps and in an ideal world it's 50/50... that would put 1500 alliance players between human, dwarf, night elf starting areas.
---
Quest reasonably - I agree if that means we'll be able to complete the starter zone in 3.5 hours.
---
I'll play a female night elf because the bow animations on male are horrible.
---
Bazooples
---
Eh? It was still common then.
---
No one knows definitely, it's something people are assuming though.     
---
Also there's a very important detail here, which is it will depend on the time of the server (PST vs cst vs est), assuming they're going to have different ones.           
---
But say for a server in PST I would assume it'd be up if the server is running before 2:59, and doesn't crash or whatever. Otherwise I'd bet it's not going to be up.
---
You're not going to get banned simply for fucking around.
---
Oh, and Disarm Trap.
---
ITT:  Lots of "I don't even ~~OWN a TV!~~ drink soda!" killjoys.
---
I really appreciate the summary. 
---
That sucks though... I had heard Illidan was back in Legion, which overall sounded like a decent idea to me. Pity that they mostly just continue to shit on him. I really enjoyed his character in WC3.
---
You can’t have a meaningful conversation about improving Classic if everyone is hung ho to change.
---
Ideally you need people who offer valid criticism in a collected manner.
---
If someone puts up a built out idea—that isn’t bat shit insane—they should be heard. The zealotous nature here is a bit overblown and dogmatic and reminds me of the rediculous logic of the church.
---
If you don’t like an idea—day why—don’t just say #nochanges.
---
No one with any sense wants anything other than 2006 wow in 2019. The question—and it’s valid—is what happens in 2021 when naxx is on fame status for all raiding guilds who want it to be. 
---
These improvements to classic threads need to operate under the assumption that they refer to the next server reset in 2021/2.
---
In a jail cell wearing a dress
---
I'm playing a warrior for the first time on a pserver that is on 1.12.1. I've tanked a few dungeons and people ask me why I don't thunderclap. As far as I can tell it's such a bad idea to use that for tanking. I have to change into the dps battle stance, losing a ton of rage, and as you point out it's not all that damaging. Instead of been using mostly taunt and shouts (demoralizing and the other one that buffs people).
---
I don't pretend to know what I'm doing but it does feel like people are making assumptions on how I should tank based on later expansions instead of vanilla mechanics.
---
Althought this is a great strategy to level in the beta I dont believe it would be beneficial at the full launch. You miss out on SO MUCH only doing the dungeon. Professions, Rep, Gold, Quest Lines, PvP. They are rushing 40 to hit AB on Saturday... that being said the AoE farming looked fun as fuck.
---
Pretty sure they have the ability to create as many layers they need to make it reasonable.
---
I remember loving [Pathologist's stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-85rvpA4tA).
---
I never played the game before, so whats bad about a male elf?
---
Hey man. I've read and agreed with many of your posts over the last year. I think you have a point here but, because of how you presented your argument, I find even myself wanting to disagree with you. The name calling and the blunt assertion that you are right no matter what puts people off. 
---
If you're at all open to a different way of presenting an argument, please check out this 12:00 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXjH3duyLKc&amp;t=52s and see if anything in there appeals to you. It really opened my eyes to some things.

Weird flex but okay...

#nohat
---
With a smaller % of the human population playing games.
---
Now your Chad daddy from high school puts in 14 hours easily.
---
So you can’t really choose a time zone without knowing what time zone the servers are in. Say you want pacific, so you pick a realm and reserve your names there. Then on launch you log in and... it’s eastern. Understanding the problem with picking a time zone?
---
Of course baby - gotta get yo mount and get ready to fish baby boy.
---
People didn't pay thousands for max level chars they paid thousands for the items those chars had.
---
Maybe like directly after release the first couple dudes to hit 60 might have sold their char for something like that but beyond that I'm calling absolute bs.
---
I mean what else to do? Fighting with 1k players for 2 Zones? :D
---
Yes
---
People would rather have daddy blizzard make everything kosher instead of dealing with the situation themselves.
---
In the 'picking your class' guide-
---
&gt; a Warlock considering PvPing at all should consider Human, as ‘Perception’ when combined with their ‘Detect Invisibility’ spell allows a Warlock to easily detect a Rogue or Druid in stealth
---
Someone wanna edit that?
---
Just get 6 linen and a couple of threads, every starting zone has someone skilling up tailoring, should be able to get the craft for free.
---
I'm not heavily versed in wow-speak. Can someone break this down and help me understand what it means? I get that strat is the Stratholme city/dungeon but what does the rest mean?
---
No, you don't pick a realm by its name, so you would never be surprised to find a realm you wanted in the wrong timezone.
---
1. Pick a type.
---
2. Pick a timezone.
---
3. Wait until August 12th.
---
4. Find the realm(s) that matches 1 &amp; 2.
---
Although you made it up it was convincing timolains phalactery was actually thought to be part of obtaining the Ashbringer. Would be really cool if this had ever actually existed.
---
I have a coke a few times a year, but honestly once I got over that sugar and caffeine addiction, it was really easy to train myself to not enjoy sodas. I quit cold turkey in 2009 where I was drinking a 12 pack of mountain dew in a day or two. I was so sick from the caffeine headaches(Probably sugar too, I don't really know if that kind of nosedive in sugar intake would cause sickness) I missed two days of work. Not long after I would drink sugar free carbonated flavored waters my local grocery sold, and that really helped me get a taste for water. Now at home I just carry a big jar or bottle of water around. A side note, it is much more enjoyable eating food now after shedding so much sugar from my diet. Things are way tastier when I only eat a piece of cake or a candy bar once a year. I honestly can't say I like packaged sweets anymore. My sugar tolerance, looking back on it, seems like 30 cups of coffee a day.
---
My thought exactly. Even worse is they don't even care that your keystone gets downranked
---
Because you couldn't hide in a cave or around a corner.
---
Aren’t they only doing this because they know the questing zones are gonna be congested?
---
Thanks for the explanation and the youtube video  - much appreciated! Glad my original question got downvoted lol. :) ClassicWow the friendliest of subreddits.
---
That’s my point you can’t find the real that matches number 2 without being able to log in.
---
So you can’t know what time zone the server is in until launch unless blizzard posts a list of servers with their corresponding time zones.
---
If you have the desire to eventually tank at endgame you don't have to level as prot.  It'll be slower and frankly the dungeons up through *maybe* UBRS simply don't require you to be prot.  Pick up tanking gear as you level and throw it on when doing dungeons.
---
Because of their antics. This event will live on much longer than anyone involved in it. If you read the whole story. You would know people thought  it was funny and in the spirit of the person they were celebrating. After all they were on a pvp server, advertised it, and even held it in an area where the horde could even engage them. 
---
 If you wore Hawaiian shirt like everyday of your life, because you loved the damn shirts so much. and people knew this. Would it still be considered crass for them to wear a Hawaiian shirt to your funeral? The people that didn't know you, would get upset at the notion of being so disrespectful to the dead person that you couldn't be bothered to put on a nice shirt and tie.
---
I don't disagree, but all the guidance Blizzard gave to RPPVP players is to "show demand" and "make noise" so that's what I'm trying to do.
---
In my experience, it's entirely possible. Fully consumed there were plenty of times where I was hovering just barely below threat cap without using VE. That being said I was lucky and had a guild that actually let me have normal priority on gear, so my experience is being a very well geared shadow priest. I'm aware it will be less of an issue for people that are going to be playing more casually.
---
don’t forget the alliance cities are way way way way waaaaaaaay better
---
Best bank roof.

This is not the best setup for 5man dungeon but it will be fun to try one time:

1.Healer: Retribution Paladin
---
2.Tank: Retribution Paladin
---
3.DD1: Retribution Paladin
---
4.DD2: Retribution Paladin
---
5.DD3: Retribution Paladin
---
yeah undead shoulder pads are pathetic. lol
---
Does he keep his kids in cages?
---
I guess its too much for people to right click me and actually do something about their problems.
---
I remember a story about a guy who paid thousands for a lvl 60 rogue and got perma banned for it shortly after
---
I do remember some going for thousands. It seemed to be the toons with rare mounts / rank 14 / full outfits of cutting edge gear. 
---
I sold my original character in early TBC for $350. Kinda regret that now.
---
I was in AQ40/Naxx.   
---
Maybe your tanks just sucked at threat.
---
My recollection of Shamans in vanilla is that getting Ghost Wolf at 20 was the game's first speed boost for 10 levels (yay!), pwning rogues (!) and everyone else with Frost Shock, learning that the Spirit stat sucked for Shamans (despite being utterly necessary) due to the 5-second rule, and finally seeing Shamans pigeonholed into healers, despite the multifaceted description of the class and skill trees.  
---
I'd really like to see some balance work done there.  Mana cost reduction on the totems shouldn't seem outrageous.  I'd like to see Blizzard take the "what if we could do it all again, what would we do differently?" question and answer it without fearing the outcry of "you better not touch it!"  Do it again - only do it better, I say.

Did WC two days ago and we didn't wipe once. Was way easier than I remembered. Well, we did skip Mutanus at the end so not a full clear. But I got leggings, glowing lizardscale cloak and wingblade so I was happy :)
---
And with different priorities from those nasty business people.
---
That system still exists for mythic and up dungeons.
---
I can't help but think streamers played a role in influencing this distribution. Not a steamer hate comment, just saying mage, Hunter, and rogue in the bottom half? Warlock number 1? Seems the complete opposite of what vanilla was. But we'll see when it launches.
---
&gt; Alliance has the best questing, the best cities and the joy of Paladins.

Cages is a barbaric term. We like to call them kiddy-corrals.

The gear really doesn’t do much for casters. Just gives them some extra mana &amp; hp. They’re still at 0 spell power just like a caster who’s in leveling gear.

Is it for sure level 10? WowHead's classic professions guide is saying 5. It's 5 in retail, and I haven't played on private servers, so I genuinely don't recall.
---
Amazing argument, if you disagree with me go play Tetris. xD
---
Almost got to log in?
---
Nope. There's plenty of Vanilla videos you're free to look up.
---
Plenty of actual guides that say the same thing I'm saying and even other posters in this thread.

"Black Lotus (also ) is extremely rare and hard to find as it spawns randomly and infrequently in various high-level zones. It requires 300 herbalism skill and it is still hard to gather (failed attempts happen often); the Advanced Herbalism enchant will reduce failure rates on this and other herbs."

You can continue to remain ignorant, child. No skin off my back when everyone says what I'm saying. You're the odd man out.

Now off to YouTube and Google for you.
---
Org is cool but it's a nightmare to navigate when youre first starting.
---
I quit in 2005 when I couldn't afford a mount at 40. Which was weird because my first character was a shaman.
---
Spriests are pretty useless in big fights. Enemy will just dispel your dots, mind flay has a short range and you have no aoe. You'd have much greater affect on the fight going holy/disc and throwing heals.
---
Are you sure, it's not just the animation? I've seen funny things happen with swing animations while you eviscerate. What was you/the streamers latency when you observed this? IIRC none of your abilities should, or ever has.
---
My god I can't wait for this. I never take the game super seriously so sometimes I mess up in endgame dungeons, and I get pretty anxious that people will kick me for the slightest mistake, it's happened before. Or even more annoyingly, I know my way around old dungeons very well due to lots of levelling, and there's been multiple occasions where I've been kicked for "not being with the group", when I was the only person going the RIGHT way and spamming in chat for them to please listen to me and come over. Always happens in places like Gnomeregan.
---
I can't wait for people to be forced to cooperate again instead of blaming each other, kicking and quitting the moment something isn't faceroll easy.

How are you talking about a 5 man group with you as the healer on a priest and a shaman with mana tide? Mana tide is a 31 point resto talent, not something every shaman gets. Obviously not an ideal group.
---
The whole idea of an ideal group is fun, but you don’t need an ideal group to be successful, that’s half the fun
---
This is so wrong.
---
This is true but dropping from being able to pull 50% of raid to less than 20% was a huge huge diversion from classic design. I agree that TBC was a great expansion, it definitely was better than what came next.
---
I drink bleach to permanently cure my depression
---
Yeah, I'm no slouch myself :) besides I've seen many of the streamers be bad on stream. I say easy speaking on the majority. Now if I run into snutz or ven I might pucker my anus. Lol
---
"Character progression" LUL.
---
You're still pressing one button at 60, mate.
---
50 is way too low. There's just no shortage of idiots in online games. I filled up fast when I played on a private server.
---
Thank you so much I completely forgot about this podcast!
---
No, level 60s went for 100-200$

I think I bought one of those just to get the pet.

Levelling is a chore and I intend to get it out of the way ASAP, if that means I spend 10 hours farming the same dungeon then so be it.

I wasn't quite 12-pack a day, but not real far off. It was regular Dew all through college. After I hit a point where the calorie intake seemed nuts to me, so I forced myself to switch to Diet Dew by eating a small snack-sized bag of chips with the diet soda. My friends all laughed, what was the point? But after a month I didn't need the chips anymore. And after a couple of years, I couldn't even stand to drink regular Dew anymore because of all the sugar. It is nuts how much is in those things.
---
But it was still Diet Dew, with all kinds of crazy chemicals. It wasn't a New Years resolution or anything, but starting in the beginning of January 2015 I said to myself 'I'm going to have tea during my commute to work instead of the usual morning soda, reduce my intake by one soda at least.' When I got to work I thought 'well that went all right and I haven't even died yet. How about some water next..' And then 'I've made it half the morning, can I make it a full morning?' Before I knew it, I'd gone the week without a soda. After a couple of months, I gave the remainder of my last case of soda to a co-worker who also drank the stuff and showed no guilt about it at all. 
---
I'm not quite as off sugar as you seem to be, but definitely reduced. And I know what you mean about tasting food more. Sugar and salt. Just murder the taste buds. I love to cook now, and try different flavors and herbs and things. My wife thinks I'm crazy because of some of the things I taste and she doesn't. I suspect it is because of things like overly-sugared drinks (coffee in her case) that she can't.
---
It’s crazy...... it’s almost like....... people have different experiences playing the same game. 
---
Isn’t that NUTS?
---
Honestly a big company outfitting displays  and want to use apple will probably buy it.
---
Was actually a 70 rogue with warglaives.
---
I'm sure OP was just being facetious and he really means "a more difficult and engaging game." 
---
Because if someone came at you saying "Candy Crush is a game just like DOOM 2016" you'd be like "hold on a minute." 
---
But one of those 2 is a lot... uh, "better" for lack of a more more appropriate term.
---
The main thing to watch out for in MacBooks is over heating if you play for a long while. A cooling pad will help.
---
More importantly, if you play Warlock first you won't want to go back to a Mage. It'd be like trading in your F355 Berlinetta to buy an MR2.
---
God the scarlet set is so beautiful, and good!
---
And them collapse them as needbe right?
---
So it's possible they make 20 layers on day 1 and by day 3 or 4 only have a few layers up?
---
Oh how gooey that would be :)
---
How can you actually believe this, or anyone for that matter? I'm not saying it's wrong for streamers to PVP. But there is a *HUGE* difference between that and doing when I mentioned. You can't reasonably defend this. Imagine someone like Asmongold or Sodapoppin telling 50,000 people to put you on their KOS list. It effectively ends your character. You will never be able to play normally again. That is absolutely abusing their position in the community.
---
One quote isn't gonna count as evidence, and I'm not going to search through youtube for a lotus picker for your baseless claims.

Problem is is that they're giving us this shit way too late. People have wanted different races, straight-back orcs, transmog everything, etc. but they're just way too late with all of this. 
---
I can't help but quote the ironically self-aware quote from Saurfang in the newest cinematic "This world... it looks good. But it's broken." 
---
No matter how much X and Y you give us won't bring us back when we want Z.
---
Ulduar hardmodes are as hard or harder than a good % of early to mid tier mythic bosses however the last couple in each raid tier (as a general rule) have become ungodly. Stuff like  Uu'nat mythic or Jaina mythic that just got released are so many order of magnitudes harder than anything in Wotlk.
---
In world pvp, hunters are unmatched. You may lose duels sometimes, but the class fantasy of tracking down enemies and raining hell from afar is fucking real. You’re faster than everyone, can shoot farther, and usually have a jump on them with track humanoids.
---
I would take it but I also only play PVP servers so I consider talents usefulness in PVP while leveling also. This is my build up to level 39 IMO the talents pretty much pick themselves.

---
I always thought Darnassus was really pretty, always thought it was a shame it was in the middle of nowhere and annoying to get to, with never any reason to actually be there. I like Alliance in vanilla just because it's one of the only occasions I know of that people actually used a city other than Stormwind/Orgrimmar, or whatever the current expansion hub was. It's gonna be cool to see that place filled.
---
Opposite here. I played Horde all through Vanilla to Cata, then quit.
---
Had two alliance toons, neither max level.
---
Ready to roll Alliance and my buddies who never played want to go Horde.
---
I'm so tired of all the undead and desert wastelands.
---
Oh interesting, so yellow damage for ret is mostly Holy rather than physical...
---
My progression vanilla guild gave our first one to our most dependable Paladin (no Ret raiders back then, all Holy). He played around with Ret but mostly just in PvP. We were going to let him raid as Ret after that, even encouraged it, but he was a Holy Pal at heart. So a legendary was just a "weekend weapon" and for boss kill screenshots haha.
---
Every guild worth their salt knows Sulfuras is best for Ret Pals and Enh Shaman nowadays so I would surprised a guild giving it to a warrior first tbh. As a warrior I'd rather have 2 1hers for pve without question and Untamed Blade/Bonereavers/Ashkandi for pvp. Sword spec all day.
---
If only all the top streams on Twitch were of the Classic beta. If only the answer was easily answered with a quick google search.

If only...
---
Holy shit. How did they get all that footage to make that?
---
TBH that's pretty cheap for the amount of playtime the average user is going to put into it.
---
wow you are a moron
---
I was actually able to log into the beta server and make a character. I was halfway through the dwarf intro when I got booted off.
---
DPS-wise Horde are better. Windfury.
---
I was 3 when I started reading this post
---
You don't need an ilvl requirement to do heroics,only if you are using groupfinder.
---
You should put an asterisk on that. Engineering won't make gold for his level 40 mount goal. I made a killing selling sappers being one of the few goblin engineers on my server. You can farm the solid stone while farming ele earth at the same time.
---
Windfury is in it's most nerfed state in 1.12. It's not that good.
---
i dont fuk\*\*\* care. just release this game!!!
---
He's talking shit, there is no ilvl restriction if you form a group. If you're an antisocial casual who uses groupfinder then yeah maybe there is one.
---
ive been playing on pre-cata (mostly tbc) private servers since the start of warlords, so yeah, its always been like that over there
---
Paladins are just a lot less clunky than shamans and salv allows some classes like warlock to do much better on alliance than horde. I don't know if it will translate into fastest boss times considering the variance of windfury, but alliance should have the advantage in speed clears.
---
That being said I think population wise we'll see a horde bias simply because of the retail carry-over.
---
I'm not sure if you're joking or not but they added the fuel to the random toy guy walking around the city a while back...
---
One of the safer insults
---
And it better be made of solid titanium for that price.
---
Poor deluded Glanea, he doesn’t even have a wife...
---
There is a vendor that sells it. They added it in cata I think
---
Much more than that for very geared characters. I sold my AQ/Naxx geared Mage after we killed KT a few times for 3500 euros.
---
My condolences.
---
As a Horde player. I miss Alliance areas. And now I know how to play i really wish I was alliance to grind that Wintersaber mount. At least horde are better at bgs (at least when I last played) 
---
Only went Horde because my brother absolutely loves Shamans and Id rather play with him over playing Alliance.
---
Hoping they have a RPPvP server. Will go Ally on that!
---
I found this funnier than I should..
---
You aren't talking about Vanilla raids surely?
---
Look... just drink the bleach
---
I prefer orc for the stun resist and racial.
---
quiver was removed long b4 legion iirc
---
This time I won't be dumb enough to not realize how good it is for a paladin.
---
It will be my first time ever playing WoW; I love scout classes/rouge or big fat huge HP types (tanks). My friends all say tanking will be a bit too hard for a first char, and rouges will be hard to find groups/raid with. Thoughts?
---
Yes. Sugar free versions.
---
A+ yeah Im going to start rating memes on this page. What of it.
---
At the top end there's a good argument horde are close or even with alliance. WF is a huge buff to warrior's damage and speedrunning is mostly about stacking the crap out of warriors, and shamans are incredible raid healers with top gear as well.  
---
For the average guild yes alliance is way easier with fear ward/BoK/Salv and only needing 4 pallies to ensure everyone get's proper buffs (where as a Horde raid needs 8 shamans).
---
So everyone just sits and waits while one person finds the realms? Then all their names are gone on the server they chose.
---
No, I want to know ahead of time so I can log on and pick a name, not sit around and wait to figure shit out that should have been known ahead of time.
---
you need mana to deal damage. you need hp to not die. your points as so irrelevant...
---
No guild bank is silly.
---
Agree
---
That’s like 50 cent a key cap. That’s actually not bad. Provided the images printed on them last.
---
Yeah is pretty op, but I want to know how far UD is a solid race, I wont pick a race only because the animations are more cool.
---
Why shouldn’t it? Explain what your version would be instead of just complaining about someone else’s opinion.
---
Whatever happened to mana and health potions they were supposed to release? Did that ever ham
---
Because duels represent an ideal situation that presents a false positive of one's skill in pvp. Anyone can set some arbitrary set of rules for duels that may or may not favor one class.  
---
 - No SL
---
 - No hour long CDs
---
 - No buffs/pots
---
 - No engineering (but first aid is okay?)
---
None of that shit matters when you're getting you ass handed to you by some rogue who's corpse camping you the entire weekend all the while you're screaming at your screen that they'd lose in a "fair fight."  
---
No, you're just bad at pvp.
---
Copper bars was like my go to gold farm for low level
---
It remains to be seen whether it will be prestigious though if it is too easy. C'thun will still be a tough fight and not many people should see it at least. MC &amp; Bwl should be cleared by a good % of capped chars.
---
I would pick a racial based on the hardest counters. Who will be harder for you to fight as a rogue, melee or casters? If your worried about other melee and such, go w the orc stun resist. If you know warlocks and priest are hard for you, go WoTF. I will say rogues can wreck locks, and with the WoTF, they kinda have no chance. You can tilt them pretty easily..

Look at the talent trees themselves instead of focusing on their mechanical applications.  Here are the [Warrior spec descriptions](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/talent-calculator#warrior) straight from Blizzard:
---
&gt;**Arms**
---
&gt;A battle-hardened master of weapons, using mobility and overpowering attacks to strike her opponents down. Preferred Weapon: Two-Handed Axe, Mace, Sword
---
&gt;**Fury**
---
&gt;A furious berserker unleashing a flurry of attacks to carve her opponents to pieces. Preferred Weapons: Dual Two-Handed Axes, Maces, Swords
---
&gt;**Protection**
---
&gt;A stalwart protector who uses a shield to safeguard herself and her allies. Preferred Weapon: Axe, Mace, Sword, and Shield
---
While a well-rounded Warrior would be proficient against monsters and other players, a Warrior who solely spars against the opposing faction would understandably outperform our well-rounded friend in that arena.  That's why we call them specializations.
---
Further, consider classes with more distinct specs.  We could substitute, say, Priests in your example: a Priest can be good in PvE and PvP, but what specifically is that Priest doing?  A Priest constantly switching between Holy and Shadow doesn't make a whole lot of sense lore-wise, just as a Warrior constantly switching between "stalwart protector" and "furious berserker" doesn't make a lot of sense.
---
With respect, suggesting dual spec as a solution to constantly respeccing tells me you're misunderstanding the opposing argument, which is that your character is not just a Warrior.  Your character is an Arms Warrior, Artisan Weaponsmith, who crafts the weapons he carries into battle (or whatever).
---
Weird... some streamers do something not everyone saw and want to post it so others can get enjoyment as well. - FTFY
---
They removed WHAT
---
you are without a doubt being stubborn, you keep harping on xp and dismissing anyone that dissagrees with you. It has nothing to do with xp yet you cant seem to grasp this simple concept. 
---
Running back and forth isnt about being a min/maxer its just foolish.
---
What I love about these old vanilla cluster fuck UIs is they are legit. They aren’t fabricated for upvotes. 14 years ago someone genuinely did this to their ui, took a step back and said “yes I need all of this information”
---
Undead is superior for PvP.
---
More people play Warlocks than you expect. It's the surprising class it seems from what the talk around the sub and other forums. 
---
Still, you get shadow res vs (Lock/Priest). WOTF vs (Lock Priest and Warrior) and the most overlooked for a Rogue...... Cannibalize.
---
It's level 10.
---
Shit if I wanted to give reddit momey instead of Blizzard I would give you a plat for that. Take my upvote good reddit user. Its not as good as a plat but its still an upvote.
---
I wish I hadn't sold my collectors edition.
---
I still have my pets tho
---
Wow thata good shit
---
The solution is simple don't stand in the bleach.
---
Ony is easy to get to - boat or portal to Theramore and swim (if no water walking) from the docks southwest towards Nat Pagle. Keep going past him until you hit the shore. There's a spot there where you can get up and over the hill/cliff.  If memory serves me right it's almost a direct line from the Theramore docks to Nat Pagle to the hill entrance.
---
Its a minimal difference. Orcs are better agaisnt the classes that are going to be the hardest to kill for rogues imo, but having the undead racial and a pvp trinket means you can almost always break fears.  
---
Play what you will enjoy looking at the most cause that's going to be the biggest thing. I always thought orcs looked kinds of silly with daggers.
---
Every single pserver speed record is held by a Horde guild.
---
[https://legacyplayers.com](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Speedkill/Default.aspx)
---
Yes really
---
This comparison is kinda to make.  Vs fear wotf is objectively better but if you don't get feared it'snormally  useless.  Personally I'd say go with ud they look cooler, cannibalism isn't useless, underwater breathing is a nice qol upgrade, and wotf works on some janky charm and sleep effects as well.
---
There's likely going to be one server for every type and timezone combination, that's it. If there is more than one, is it really that hard to read and make a quick decision?
---
Blizzard is publishing the names of servers on August 12th. You'll be able to see them in the game menu 14 days before launch. That's 14 days for you to decide. That's all you get.
---
As a hemo pvp build do you solely use hemo or do you get the bonus damage charge up then BS?
---
I've seen a fair number of people do it at 40, but I think 'easily' is an overstatement. If I had to guess, I'd say the average is probably closer to 43. 
---
Of course, if that's your experience, it's understandable how you would feel that way. Perhaps grinding makes less gold than questing?
---
For the night elves in particular, their mouths were pretty butchered after the update. Their lip colors were all wildly different with significantly more lipstick, and a majority of the mouths were also curled into smiles whereas before they appeared much more stern or neutral in their expressions. It turned me off the entire race with how awkward they looked.
---
1) You're severally underestimating how many servers there will be
---
2) You're drastically underestimating how competitive it will be to reserve names on servers
---
I don't even know what Discord is so there's that as well.
---
I think I saw talk that having +engineering is good for lower level twinks, who will have access to certain items other lvl  19s won't in BGs.
---
Rogues can solo the torch room.  
---
Gank the torch carriers while they are between mobs. 
---
Soloing the elementals that guard the alters can be hard if you aren't geared but plan ahead and bring greater fire protection potions if you are under-geared or unsure.
---
If I end up playing I plan to do exactly that with Leather Working on my druid. Live off the land as the Earth Mother intended.
---
Space titanium

what is dont do dick
---
Hi, /u/wututolkienbout
---
Our guild was in same boat. 
---
Made it to 4HM but then kept gearing new tanks only for another one to stop playing because TBC was around the corner.  
---
Especially sucked as rogue giving up all that bonesycthe for “progression” :(
---
My first character was a Tauren and Mulgore was amazing. It was so isolated from the rest of the world, I didn't even see any other races until 10 hours in somewhere in the Barrens. The world was such a mystery. It's such a slow start and the best for someone who wants a character arc with humble beginnings.
---
I've never leveled in tristfall. How is that area and the next couple zones in terms of story? Thinking about going UD priest solely because of this.
---
I have 4 female characters on a pserver. Some times you just want a thinner cow you know?
---
Also in old Vanilla people would give you shit if you acted like a chick for 15mins so i plan on doing that when I can. A rare boe and 30g? Fuck yeah Ill /dance on you while I go take a piss. Dirty talk? Thats going to at least cost a stack of ore or some enchanting mats.
---
..yes I was a whore in Vanilla only because i wouldnt be a successful one irl
---
Oh, darn. Ya I’m gonna be playing solo as i don’t know anyone that is gonna play. What would be fun fun to level solo you think ? Warlock Druid or hunter?
---
If it's like retail the regions have US East and west.
---
Not necessarily. They use 10 data centers in Washington, California, Texas, Massachusetts, France, Germany, Sweden, South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Some of those timezones overlap. If you live in Washington, you'll have a better ping to the Washington servers even though California servers are in the same region.
---
And thats why I always play female characters hahah glad to know not the only one
---
repeating, of course
---
Thanks a lot. i checked that out. This is pretty cool you made this.   
---
Its kind of weird the alliance really do have more mounts. I guess they thought it would be balanced by the horde getting the Shaman with its wolf form. It can be used in dungeons and early leveling it is extremely impacted by it.   
---
Truly.   
---
I think there is SOME balance there. Also the Shaman get Astral Recall which also increases world mobility. That is major for Classic.   
---
When you factor in the Frostsaber mount the Alliance get I can see that. There are more Alliance racial mounts as well. I don't think it was intended to be that way.   
---
At least the Horde get spikes on their armor. XD
---
So they actually still make the OG Orange game fuel but because they decided to rebrand Kickstart to GF, they call the old GF flavor Citrus Cherry. Shit is the fucking bomb.
---
Life became vastly better after 26. Late 20’s have been the best time of my life. Yes I miss my childhood and being 16, but life approaching 30 is pretty awesome so far.
---
Sounds like you're asserting I'm the dick. Is it because I'm playing to win the battleground?
---
If 9 people join a WSG, screw around in the middle of the map ignoring the objectives, and then want the flag carrier to throw the match so they can leave, is it not those 9 people who are dicks?
---
Anyone who purposefully loses a battleground, now there's a terrible person who's worthy of your contempt.
---
Any idea when it'll be up on the site? Really looking forward to it as Mage is one of the top choices for me personally.
---
Well informed and Undead Rogue is an oxymoron mate.
---
??? Then pick the racials - do you want stun resist or wotf?
---
You can wotf wyvern sting as well as other goofy effects like that sleep powder and Mc cap.
---
lmao my favourite is that everyones rolling need on that green trash cape. also rob zombie :D
---
I'll rip the secrets from your flesh.
---
You can do both - go druid.  Level as feral and you can play both a stealthy character (cat form) as well as a tank (bear).
---
There's going to be a plethora of guides out there on how to play so don't worry about this being your first time.  Just read up and enjoy the class (which is one of the more fun to play IMNSHO).
---
yeah, I mean, female orc is okish, but UD is fair superior in style and lore. But I dont gonna be happy if i am in handicap in pvp for pick a race for style u know.
---
ON A MAC?????
---
Sodapoppin is definitely influencing druid numbers.
---
Yeah, every time I see a comparison of an old and new toon the appearance difference is jarring. My Dwarf Hunter use to be rather cute looking, but the model update butchered her face.
---
That's because pserver alliance people say "howdy" and horde are the cool kids.
---
With Layering, Blizzard could release only one server for each of the 4 timezones and 2 realm types and still be able to support 200k+ players. Even at one million, which is very unlikely, that's only 5 realms per type.
---
You're telling me you can't pick 1 of 5 names in enough time to reserve whatever name it is you're desperate for?
---
Just wait till Buffy shows up.
---
But the attunements were things you were doing along the way to progress anyway.
---
The attunement for Kara - grab quest chain, do a bunch of dungeons and heroics.
---
The attunement for BT - beat the previous raids.
---
And if you didn't beat them, you could still go in as long as someone had the key.
---
So basically level damage until like... 50ish? And get two sets of gear so I can tank dungeons along the way?
---
Or all the way until 60?
---
These are garbage and nothing like the old GF flavors. They actually still make the original orange coloured flavor but they call it "Citrus Cherry".
---
I will say though, the Amp cans have a really interesting tab that can re-seal of you don't finish in one sitting.
---
I’m going to give it a solid 5/7, a perfect score.
---
Can you still get under Ironforge?
---
There is a weekly thread for this question
---
Good Old Illidan. My old stompin' grounds.
---
 This will be my first time leveling on a pvp server so I will probably level shadow. No black out is rough especially against rogues. It feels like a good stun can really turn those fights, but you just cant justify not taking spirit tap. 
---
I feel like imo mindblast is only good in displayed fights like 1v1 wpvp when you dont mind using everything and then eating and drinking after. Over longer fights it just seems like it will eat your mana faster
---
Oh I have no doubt the % of people clearing AQ and Naxx will be far higher than in 2005. And that's fine.
---
Turn off UI, have a weak aura that reminds you to eat a consumable every 3 to 5 hours, and of course permadeath.
---
You weren’t killing things faster but Bear dps was so *frustratingly* close to cat dps while bringing so much more armour that you could chain mobs noticeably quicker on bear
---
Any idiot could design post-Naxx raids. Whenever someone says something like "1.13 would lead to Blizzard adding dual specs and flying mounts to Azeroth" they're just making a bad faith argument because they're rather have TBC.
---
It's okay to prefer having TBC (even though I personally think it's bad for the game), but at least be honest about what 1.13 would be.
---
Did you play vanilla?
---
If yes, pick a class you didn't play back then (it won't be the same)
---
If no, then it doesn't matter- pick one you have read are good - warrior,rogue,mage.
---
Nobody will answer it for you. 
---
Tank = warrior
---
Healer = priest, druid, pally, shaman
---
Dps = anything except Hunter, balance druid, feral druid.
---
Pick one and have fun!
---
It's not different than playing any RPG on easy, Normal, Hard, Extreme modes.
---
I do agree the "sightseeing" difficulty needs to go away but that doesn't mean normal, heroic, mythic couldn't be perfectly fine
---
I’m perfectly fine with BC but I am super curious to see what Blizzard would do for 1.13 content.
---
It's not made for people that would buy a $50 adapter on Amazon. You aren't Pixar, so it isn't for you. Simple.
---
It wont be sufficient if you want to be a feral druid. There are some other less obvious examples.
---
This is not a hard choice.. at all
---
On a pvp server they will encounter a shitload of people messing with them as they try to level. Also I think they are surprised by their speed and would have done something else by now if they weren’t getting such good xp
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
I think it really depends on how many instances you plan on running while leveling, but no matter how you slice it or when you go prot, the questing will be crazy slow at any point in the game.. even at 60.  
---
I would say go prot at around 58~, which will give you time to practice with the few differences in mara/ST/BRD.  58-60 is a long time, keep in mind.

Blessing of Salvation from pally gives a gigantic buffer to tanks, allowing them to go further with less in the gear pool.  The pally healing helps too. The Horde may eventually get speed records, but Alliance will probably have the easier runs overall.
---
Alliance also has dwarf priests and fear ward, which helps make things easier for tanking too.  No stance dance.
---
Human rogues, not much impact.  If they're using swords, which they eventually will, they can probably drop one point in weapon expertise for one point in applied poisons.  The loss of windfury is made up by having main hand poison.  More or less, they'll be fine.

My stress test drop down disappeared not long after last weeks stress test. However, I noticed that when I launched my Battlenet App yesterday it said it was downloading an update for my Stress/Beta version of WoW. The dropdown has never returned. I assume that is related to the accidental stuff? I wasn't on until fairly late in the evening, figured that error would of been caught long before that.
---
Depends, what are you planning on farming? If you’re just herbing or mining, you can do that while holy...
---
Its a minor difference overall really. I played a troll rogue in vanilla and still did really well
---
Going into Ungoro the first time, you never forget youre in a massive crater even when your at the top of the mountain.
---
It was pretty good except for the beginning part with ~~Elsa from Frozen~~ that fucking Gnome.  Blizzard's art direction and sense of "humor" have taken a complete nosedive over the last decade.
---
Classic doesn't require bfa........
---
If you're planning on doing this, make sure to pick up Tailoring first and only Tailoring, then drop it. Your first profession costs 10c, your second costs 1s. You'll save 90c, which is about the price of a skinning knife.
---
They wanted warlocks on both factions, even with the lore, they wanted alliance players to be able to play the more evil class.

---
you only have to pay the sub fee, you dont have to buy the game, so yes you could live in europe and play on NA servers, it each region has its own sub fee, so your sub for NA wont carry over to EU servers
---
I was probably gonna be a tailor/enchant. Guess ill have to take up fishing or somthing
---
Why so adamant about no hunter?
---
Why except those 3?
---
Think it's so far off I could have 2 or 3 children by the time that comes around.
---
Not now chief, I'm in the fuckin' zone
---
If it is in any way linked too classic wow, I want it.
---
theyve said theyre open to the discussion but blizzard has also said they dont want to manage two mmo's at once, so its more likely theyll just release tbc
---
I was R14 during retail without needing to be UD/orc. I promise that you will be fine.
---
Def going Rogue. Cant decide faction though. Undead rogue is my favorite class/race combo, but alliance is my favorite faction/cities/zones
---
Do you know what adamant means?
---
It's my opinion...
---
*laughs in warlock
---
We are gonna kick dead weight.
---
I know but I felt like starting a fresh thread. Less in it and new responses
---
Highly likely but not confirmed that they’ll run Classic exactly the same way as Retail wow servers. Only during beta is everyone connecting to Blizzard hq as that’s where they have their own small beta servers.
---
So from Australia I’m getting 240-320 ping to the beta/stress test servers. However to the retail Aus server I get 70-90.
---
Just not as good - it isn't like BFA where and dps is within 1 dps of each other :)
---
Like I said before, Blizzard leaves thing to their own discretion. That's the final answer. I only recommend that the guidleine should be to stop at same faction griefing. The only answer is Blizzard calls the shots so don't be too much of an asshole, that's all there is to it.
---
I hate that you made me remember this and the fact I thought it was SO COOL, MOM, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I NEED THIS
---
Warriors are the best DPS in the game.
---
Windfurry is the best buff for the warriros
---
Conclusion. Horde has the exclusive best buff for the best DPS class in the game.
---
In vanilla, it is tough to beat the questing experience of alliance.  Horde has some cool spots like barrens... but that is essentially it, and even that gets old near the end (it lasts a very long time with tons of running back and forth).
---
Alliance also has better cities and city placements in my mind.  Ironforge is a very central location to get to just about any raid (close to boat, quick flight to MC/BWL and most end game dungeons).  
---
At the end of the day, it doesn't matter 'that' much either way, so if you have an interest in horde 'just because' then you wont be hurting for enjoyment.
---
Even better! Go holy, spam dungeons - you’ll get good gear, and you get a lot of cloth in dungeons. Also, lots of items to Disenchant. No need to go shadow at that point :)
---
WotF frees you from the same things as the PvP trinket for rogues does, which you will eventually get.  I honestly don't remember, but I assume the cooldowns were independent of one another.  Stun resist is something that can be matched via free action potions or living action potions.  
---
So it comes down to whether you think you'll make more use breaking two fears/charms/poly or resisting some stuns, and therefore less reliance on a living action potion to save you.
---
I played hunter in vanilla and I felt they were pretty strong in end game
---
WoW is one subscription for all regions. You don't need multiple accounts to play in any of them.
---
To play all of Retail except BFA content, you just need a subscription.
---
To play BFA content, you need the BFA expansion.
---
To play Cliassic, you just need a subscription.
---
No, he bought another character that was fresh 70, and geared it. Our fun surprise when he lost that account two weeks later too.
---
Adamant: a legendary rock or mineral to which many properties were attributed, formerly associated with diamond or lodestone.
---
But seriously, since you’re a cocky know it but happens to be wrong. Adamant means: refusing to be persuaded or to change your mind. This definition is usually about an poor job. 
---
This makes you a compete idiot when it comes to correcting people and when when it comes to vocabulary. 
---
You sicken me and I award you no points, may God have mercy on your soul.
---
Go hunter then :)
---
Only if we get those old celebrity commercials back with ozzy and MrT
---
I just might
---
Yet horde was destroying alliance in raid progression from start to finish of vanilla, and not just a few guilds either.  
---
You are also completely wrong about the PvP que time thing.  Alliance outnumbered horde on most servers, and horde were the ones who got very quick que times.
---
Yep, pserver starting zones are absurd and they kind of ruin any danger. Everything dies so fast you can sit afk in defias camp for 10mins and nothing happens.
---
&gt;But seriously, since you’re a cocky know it but happens to be wrong. Adamant means: refusing to be persuaded or to change your mind. This definition is usually about an poor job.
---
There was no dispute that I was responding to that caused me to be adamant, good try fortnite catakid :)
---
No
---
You don't need a single point in protection to tank in dungeons until end-game content and even then it's not super necessary.
---
Pick whatever spec you want. If that's the most efficient solo leveling spec, fine. Whenever you want to tank, just slap on the sword and board and switch stances.
---
My hunter lvl 49 got that on retail, with plate armor from SM lmao
---
Would be neat to see them finish the Emerald Dream, and maybe that battleground they scrapped in Azshara.
---
Yea, mages are going to be everywhere much like warriors, so I wouldn't put them into the category of easy grouping.
---
Priests are always needed in raids, and you will likely get into fully formed 5 mans whenever you want.
---
Nice! 19 twinking was all I did back in the day. I was only 10 and didn’t have the drive to grind levels so I spent all my time in wsg 1 shotting squishies... can’t wait to remake my rogue.
---
You're clearly talking from 15 years ago. I'm talking about modern day classic wow. And yes, private servers are a really good indicator of how things are going to work. The PvE focused players go alliance, and the PvP focused players go horde.
---
If only AutoMod would delete posts like these as quickly as it deletes posts mentioning private servers...
---
Just add a filter for "after Naxx" and be done with it.
---
I trust the devs to faithfully reconstruct the game from the original 1.12 source material. I dont trust them to go off the rails designing their own stuff. 
---
Just like GoT. Dumb &amp; Dumber were able to accurately translate book source material to the screen in seasons 1-4. As that source material dried up they had to go more and more off the rails and the final product became a bastardization of itself. 
---
Only time will tell with Classic WoW. Hopefully the source material is valued above all else.
---
I'm very aware; but compare that to hordes trip.
---
Alliance:
---
Sw-&gt;tram IF-&gt;Flight menethil-&gt;wait for fucking boat-&gt;run across the annoying ocean (water walking isn't a thing for alliance; only levitate)-&gt; Ony
---
Compare that to
---
Horde:
---
Org-&gt;Dustwallow, run south for 50 seconds on an epic mount
---
I've always played female characters in just about every game I've played.  (im male obviously)
---
Literally no one cares if you want to play a female character than play one, it seems like the majority of female characters in the game are male IRL anyway.
---
If unaware, the /camp relog to the start of the instance farming from pservers doesn’t work on the beta. You log back inside the instance exactly where you logged out. So DME, DMN tribute and Mara etc have taken a massive gold per hour hit. 
---
As a future lock I’m scrambling haha.
---
200 ping sounds like an authentic vanilla experience to me :)
---
Agreed.  I think most of the people that I really don't want to run into in my game will all be gone by the third month.  The people who are gonna stick around aren't going to be interested in streamers or popularity, they're going to be there for the game.
---
Fair warning though: finding raid spots will take some doing. In raids druids are considered the weakest healers and rogues will not be excited to be cutting loot with you if you spec for cat dps. That leaves bear tanks which aren't useless but aren't preferred to warrior tanks either.
---
No. Staysafe asked Ian about this, summoning infernals and he said that's fine
---
At some point if you do it for hours, it is kinda though
---
I wanna play druid feral/resto for pvp but my problem with them is that it's hard to troll with druids. I like hunter for eyes of the storm, priest for mc, locks to control demons and release...but druids, it's hard to dick around
---
It's literally "fresh" every Wednesday and guess what day it is?
---
Just a robe and wizard hat
---
What?
---
How did you know that I was a fortnite catakid?
---
Absolutely not, the most you could expect for them to add are features to alter the playstyle of the game. Such as a one life character. You click hardcore on when you create your character and if you die it auto deletes. Shit like this could be added to spice things up because they wouldnt change vanilla wow for everyone else.
---
Warriors can take a lot longer than most classes, but it isn't the point of needing to no life or anything... unless you are trying to beat most people to 60, in which case your life is forfeit.  
---
The true nature of warrior comes from the fact that you need to learn how to DPS and tank, while also figuring out your limits.  Just a lot more to learn and get use to than most classes, and you don't have much of a say in the matter.
---
Do me yo-yo master
---
God, I miss this sort of experience. 
---
Private servers are fun, but they don't quite capture it - it's probably the player count and wildness there. Say what you will about being people being reported, but it did keep some of the vileness down because of the possibility of getting banned.
---
I remember my first time doing BFD, and I was absolutely amazed at the size. This was on my third toon, and i was totally shocked at how big that lowbie dungeon was. 
---
Like some other posters have said , the sheer size of BRD was amazing to me too. I don't know if I've ever done the entire dungeon in one run. I remember slogging through it for hours.
---
I think my favorite high level dungeon is probably strathome. My first 45 minute run was so friggin awesome - it was a paladin heavy group too - three paladins, myself (a warrior), and a priest. I don't know how we managed it. 
---
There's so many little things that made vanilla such a wonderful game.
---
You built up such strong ties with people because of the time investment and the coordination required. You learned who to watch out for and who was good, and at all points during your leveling experience you made good friends. 
---
Good times
---
Healers carry raids. If you're competent, play a healer. Otherwise go damage and press 1 button.
---
Hahaha. 
---
Remember the year. OSX was [space alien stuff (I had it heavily modded though)](https://imgur.com/a/JKVyVWI) compared to where [Windows was](http://www.wikihow.com/images/e/ef/Install-Windows-XP-Step-25-Version-3.jpg)
---
You need Drowning Pool - bodies on there.
---
The only hard part about being a MT in vanilla, is actually getting into a guild as a MT.  You basically want 2 'tanks' in a 40 man raid, where as you wanted 2-3 in 25 man raids in TBC. 
---
Also, if you handled TBC tanking and did well, then you will be able to rest easy, because vanilla tanking doesn't even come close to as strenuous as it was in that expansion.
---
I agree, they could litteraly take the already made TBC kara and hyjal instances and repopulate them with vanilla tier content. And since they've been able to fully create MC in like a week end, I'm sure modern game designers could do a good job.
---
To be honest its not super likely you'll be running into vast amounts of pairs of enemies. Wouldn't worry about it overly.
---
I'm really hoping for 1.13. BC was fine - but I'd hate for this entire endeavor to just end in following the same path until the same mistakes are made.
---
Any newbies reading this: PvP Warlocks want to be on horde so they don't have to deal with [will of the forsaken](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=7744/will-of-the-forsaken).
---
Wtf u talking about. Blizz has always been responsive. They just took a swing amd a miss with bfa mechanics and u cant go back on 2 years of development overnight
---
I’d love to see Emerald Dream, Hellfire, Dragon Isles and such as level 60 content designed with vanilla style mind
---
 I leveled a specific set of alts in vanilla with my friends just doing dungeons and it was way more enjoyable then questing in the world, but it was slow. Which was fine with me since it was with them.
---
Would you rather be able to resist CC from two classes you can already beat every 2 minutes that a trinket can do just as well?
---
OR
---
Resist more than 1 out of every 4 stuns from every class in the game, including the ones you have a problem with, all the fucking time without having to press a button?
---
Devilsaur set solving all my problems
---
Nah kids need to learn the hard way
---
#NOCHANGES
---
Yeah, it really depends what race you're playing. If you're Undead you should be dealing with Rogue's pretty easily with DP. If you're Dwarf though, especially against Undead Rogue's you're gonna have a pretty shitty time regardless of Blackout or not up to level 40. Once you get Shadowform Priest is one of the best 1v1 classes not many people really want to fuck with you other than maybe Hunters.
---
And exactly, you will only really pop MB once per pull while leveling so the talent is kinda garbage.
---
Seeing content that was cut would be nice, that's an easy way to bring stuff into the game without really advancing it.
---
\#NoChanges
---
Use /r/classicwowplus for this pointless topic. It's banned until phase 3 of Classic.
---
I think they meant the faction imbalance during release of vanilla.
---
Haha nice man. I recovered my account and found my lvl 20 twink hunter that my 11 year old self lvled on accident in ashenvale when looking to wpvp! My items were all changed though. Created my account on 12-21-2004. I remember I begged my mom to pls give me wow before Christmas.
---
All they gotta do is have 1.13 over a picture of Kharazhan's tower and you'll watch them all snap their word-holes shut.
---
This subreddit is pretty militant
---
Not in particular no.
---
Alliance is the superior faction after all.
---
I still keep finding myself watching Laintime over and over.
---

Damn makes me sad I stopped playing wow the day ulduar released...
---
There are people who feel the horde have big advantages. There are people who feel alliance have big advantages.
---
That bodes well for a good population balance.
---
Arthas was corrupted when he took up frostmourne. When his soul was taken, he “died” and what we see as Arthas is a culmination of all of his fear and doubt that he couldn’t protect his people.
---
I cannot wait for the full ST again
---
Better than ud and thunderbluff but nothing beats ogrimmar lol
---
&gt; How better is alliance
---
Not better enough to get any more than 3 of 49 significant world firsts in the entire history of WoW.
---
In extreme scenarios such as speedrunning, Horde groups grab Paladin buffs anyway.
---
And without Windfury, swords is not better for rogues.
---
In what sense?
---
*But everyone is doing it!*
---
I don't think they are going to do much actual advertising for classic.  They still want to sell their crappy expansions after all.  
---
Likely they will just depend on streamers and virtually nothing else.
---
Uhh, no. The eye moves at 200% speed and lasts for a long time so it can gather up all the mobs quickly and outrun them to pull more. Pally runs in, pops bubble, only has 8 seconds to pull a handful of mobs then dies.
---
Lol?
---
I was with yo till 
---
Why? Because they want to tank
---
I’ve never heard anything more offbase. Nearly no warriors want to tank. Some are willing, but very few want to. 
---
That’s why finding tanks has been a miserable experience from 11/23/04 to 6/6/19
---
Kek bur is all you need!
---
The point of using Hemo is that it only costs 35 Energy (the cheapest combo point generator). It gets combo points faster and cheaper than any other build. It’s all about that 5 point Eviscerate, that’s the goal of the spec. Switching weapons for a backstab isn’t the goal and the opposite of what the build wants to do.
---
As for trinkets, once Zul’Gurub comes out, go for Renataki’s Charm of Trickery, it’s god tier
---
I’d love to see a video of 4 horseman with 8 prot paladins
---
Are you sure? Because I stared in NA and needed a new game for Europe and a new sub for Europe .... that was in 2005 ofc.
---
Earning that first gold on vanilla took  forever.
---
There isn't a Warlock spec you should ever be hard casting Shadowbolt in for pvp (outside of super niche scenarios).
---
That too.
---
On the other hand, Paladins. I roll Aff and they're the only class I'd actively just run away from because it wasn't worth trying. (Got my revenge in TBC with Unstable Affliction!)
---
Please do me. You so cool
---
I guarantee you most people who played vanilla/TBC back then are not going to be the types of people who are glued to twitch.  Yea, exceptions exist, but most people now have families if they didn't already.
---
You ramble a lot and it seems like you don't know what you want. Hard to give you advice from that.
---
I counted 21 mobs :O
---
Mastapiece*
---
Best way to lvl a tank is to lvl as arms or fury. Arm especially at lvl 40 with mortal strike
---
I kinda doubt it. A huge portion of the community is pretty vile. There are plenty of nice folks out there, but MMOs tend to attract people with a chip on their shoulder.
---
~5 days /played to 60
---
$7.25 minimum wage
---
A naked level 60 character should be worth about $870 today.
---
Most gamers aren't glued to twitch/youtube.  A large portion of the ones watching twitch are in the teen demographic... everyone who played vanilla/TBC are going to be way past that.
---
If you're only gonna raid casually human won't be worth it imo.
---
Seems like an odd reason response. I didn't see the reply as complaining
---
Where in the list is the time zone? Cause retail doesn’t have time zone listed. Vanilla didn’t. Why would classic?
---
That’s what you aren’t getting. There is no way to tell time zone of the server without logging into the server.
---
I don't watch them myself, but I will shit on them whenever I can. Because they deserve it for their nonsense attempts to solidify a place in the game ecosystem for themselves like selfish pricks. They can get fucked.
---
Disappointed there is no Flip: category under best races for alliance.
---
Yes there is
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/status
---
I think too many people think warriors will outdps them in most aspects of the game.. when in reality rogues are top dogs in MC, BWL and most of AQ40.  
---
Oh well, give it time post release and people will remember the rogue glory days.   Worst case scenario, this means rogues will actually be sought after if they are a rarity.
---
Would love if you only need one sub for every region. I recall to need to purchase the game again in a need area. Was my case at least in 2005 switching from NA to europe.
---
Yes, and make sure to roll on a streamer's server.
---
I give everyone this suggestion. It is much easier to have your main raid specced character and a farming ALT.
---
Imagine thinking pservers = classic
---
Don’t forget the Undead Female flip when she does an Eviscerate!
---
Leveling as a prot warrior will be slow and hard. I wouldn't suggest it even if you want to spam dungeons the whole way.
---
I heard about a priest taking the agility cloak from VanCleef because he is convinced that it increases wand crit chance lol.
---
You do not want to level as prot. It will take you so much longer to level. You can tank everything just fine as a dps spec, obviously put on a 1h/shield and switch to def stance.
---
Should I play alliance or horde? I plan on playing Priest and leveling with a friend playing Warlock. My friend does not care so it is my choice to make. We plan on rolling on a pvp server and doing both pve and pvp casually. 
---
I like horde lore and find thier races more interesting. However, I think I prefer alliance cities and my friend typically plays "magic knight" classes so he may want to try paladin at some point. I'm also concerned about pvp. From what I have heard horde dominate world pvp, but get long queue times. I am not a fan of queue times and typically play tank/healer specifically to avoid long queue times. It also sounds like alliance get an advantage in pve when it comes to racials.
---
Easy to forget when most undead rogues I see are male.
---
I suppose for players that developed the skill to do Ulduar hardmodes, and then went on to clear the hardest content of the next few expansions, Blizzard would _have_ to up the difficulty to ludicrous levels... eventually brushing up against the hard limits of human skill.
---
I'm actually wrong, sorry.
---
As the other guy responded to you, eye is significantly superior to a pally in this scenario. The eye can pull literally half the instance. They were clearing armory in 3 pulls. A pally bubble can't pull nearly that many and has a cooldown.
---
Yeah, although I raided as Holy.  Ret was a lot of fun to PVP with and I spent a lot of DKP on gear to be able to do so lol.
---
Pretty sure the only thing that would be considered griefing is doing something like full body blocking mail boxes (don't think this was possible till wrath anyway) or doing your best to prevent people from doing other things that were clearly unintentional.  
---
Summoning a doomguard is something they purposely coded in.
---
Not to mention resisting grenade stuns, because anyone competitive will have Eng.
---
&gt;How about if a Shaman was tanking?
---
I don't watch streams so idk if people are doing this but rather than rushing SM as much as possible with the cheap respec's and great gear everyone accumilated at 30 the #1 fun thing to do IMO would be to push limits of dungeons and SM specifically due to the level. 
---
I'd be getting groups to have a shaman tank, 3 man it with a warlock VW tank, 5 man it with all dps specs and kiting mobs. See how far you can get in dungeons by doing wild stuff and weird specs. Sounds fun as hell, I did a bit of that at 60 back in the day once we got geared. Mainly trying to 3 man dungeons.
---
Isn't the Alliance quest chain much longer than the hordes?
---
Is it really that hard to google something?
---
RP-PvP servers got introduced in 1.8, and Stormreaver is a PvP server.
---
Unfortunately, I got the hammer like 3-4 months before BC launched.  Didn't get as much time to enjoy it as I'd have liked.   We didn't get an Eye of Rag for well over a year of MC.
---
... welcome back?.. I guess. Back in my day we only dropped if work was more important ( which we properly timed out anyways) or mom pulled the internet chord.
---
The people recreating the content are made up of devs who loved the game and some who literally made the game. The remark of not trusting OG developers to make new content (more or less just raids let's be honest here. Something that literally is blizzards only good content through all their content even without OG devs) is pretty asinine to say the least.
---
Because I totally said that right. Or maybe it's just that the best data available says that Horde has better DPS. Stay edgy my friend.
---
As an Alliance player I have to agree the Horde one tasted much better than the Alliance flavor.
---
It's not worry as much as it is fun fantasizing lol
---
Disagrees in tauren
---
they are easy, but unforgiving.
---
If you know wtf you're doing you can breeze through them.
---
If you don't you're in for a tough ride
---
having a good 3 man group to quest and dungeon together is the most fun way to level imo. Especially if you want a healer and don't want to do a dps spec just to be able to level solo content.
---
Oh they will. It is only a matter of time until spirits are broken, hated forged, and friendships forgotten. You think the cost warcraft of is 14.99? No, the cost is your soul. 
---
Welcome to classic.
---
Imagine being this mad
---
But that would be so...evil.
---
More to keep my sanity when I look at the dps meter in any event encounter.  Also I really don't like dwarf or gnone models :/
---
Nobody says that, what people say is that blizz wouldn't know how to create new content that doesn't power creep everything before, balance the classes in a way that makes sense (if you add new gear class balance WILL change).
---
Current blizzard knows how to make good PvE, but doesn't understand good rewards, or how to design a good grind, or how to create new lore. If the only reason you play a mmorpg is endgame, retail is a lot better than classic for that. Harder raids, more mechanics. If you want everything else, there is were blizz doesn't know what to do.
---
You seem in an awful rush to get to something....
---
All rules should be bespoke to the tournament at hand.

I thin engineering in a duel is fuckingn dim, others don’t. Meanwhile those same people think you shouldn’t be able to use certain class skills/talents....
---
A duel is a test case. duels should be Bo3. Once a duel starts, it’s duel, heal, duel, heal, duel if needed. No rest. 
---
But players should be given full rest to reacquire CDs between opponents. 
---
That creates a meta of cd management within a duel set while also preserving the idea of a duel being an ideal “fair fight”.
---
In vanilla blizzard said the free mounts were a perk of the classes. Warlocks and paladins don’t pay more to train skills than other classes.
---
Yeah, players who did ulduar hardmodes when current would be able to adapt to mythic raiding though for sure. It's like anything that you grown accustomed to it.
---
Also when a more casual mythic raider like me gets to a boss they have sometimes nerfed it slightly as well as the natural nerf of having more gear than the first guilds to kill it.
---
I say bring it on. PvP on PvP server.
---
Hint hint: Everyone is on my KOS list. It's called "If red, it's dead". It should be the same for everyone else on the opposite faction. No different than some streamer swinging around their scrotum-hangers they call viewers.
---
Can't decide between Lock or Hunter.
---
Will primarily be interested in wPvP, BG's and duels, but will be raiding in a progression guild a few nights a week which I also enjoy. 
---
I'm concerned about soul shards, competing for cloth gear and shadow bolt spamming for locks but I love their pvp tool kit. 
---
On the other hand I'm concerned about hunter's being too one dimensional in pvp just frost trapping and kiting but like that their pve rotation is a bit more involved.
---
Help :(?
---
I added it up one time. Two sometimes 3 accounts since 2006, servers transfers, faction changes, and names changes the number was kind of staggering. I won't be doing that again ever...
---
Respec when you're doing content that requires it, not before. This is probably the day before you first raid.
---
How will your sanity fare when you're stuck in frost novas?
---
Man, I don't think I ever had to ignore 50~ people in 6 years of playing the game back then.   
---
What is your definition of "relentlessly spamming"?
---
Ahh i see, in that case engineering profession and grenades will be your best friends.
---
Hell, even female Night Elves have huge shoulder pads.
---
Yeah I think like 5 steps longer if I remember right
---
I'm sure not going to roll on pvp. I don't like ganking people and I sure don't like being ganked. 
---
Corpse camping or killing low level sound almost like griefing to me but its somewhat accepted in wow.
---
You will rarely have good 1vs1. People wait you to have low mana/health to attack you. You better have an alt because if you get camped for hours it will get old very fast.
---
Also pve will most likely have much more casual players, a most for me.
---
No, fuck off with blizzard playing thought police. This will lead to mouthbreathing streamers abusing the system.
---
I did this on my DK before it was nerfed in Cata, and it was a pain in the ass even though I could solo everything. Finished it with 6 months to spare before Cata released lol. It helps to preserve your sanity to also grind the Timbermaw Hold rep as you will be killing a lot of Winterfall Furbolgs and they drop the beads for the rep turn ins.
---
Remember that in Classic Winterspring is one of the handful of max level zones, so this will probably be a crowded grinding area. You'll have high level players trying to grind out their last few levels, competition from people working on the same reputations, raiders gathering firewater or mats for jujus, as well as miners and herbalists on gather runs and just killing stuff along the way. Plus remember that raiding is expensive and there will be plenty of players just grinding mobs for gold to pay their repair bills.
---
That does make sense. I worry about all that extra time spent leveling a second character, but we will see how it plays out. I'd assume mage or hunter the best for farming?
---
Yes. I've seen twinks with the hat in the Beta.
---
Horde beat alliance in raid progression in vanilla AND TBC by a rather large margin.
---
Not sure why people still cling to the idea that alliance somehow has an advantage, because horde has its own advantages as well.
---
this sub is eternally butthurt about everything lmao
---
The paladins part is fairly objective
---
Was shitting blue for weeks.
---
What happened to 4 hours?
---
On a backup of a backup of a backup, I think.
---
Why is everyone playing a warlock now I want to be unique!
---
MC's attunement was to jump through the window portal, but you could technically get in otherwise. The attunement quest is basically just going to the far portal for MC and grabbing a quest item anyway.
---
There is literally nothing revolutionary about it, my 5K Dell reference monitor has identical range of motion, can be rotated vertical, angled up and down 15-30deg, and side to side 45deg, and moved up and down around 12".
---
That stand came with the screen for a total price of $2500.
---
I completely agree with you in regards to the carry over.
---
Retail alliance has been dead for years now, and I think people coming over are going to stick with their horde transition more than not.
---
Seeing that you will be raiding in progression I'd go Warlock. 
---
You will be a monster once geared.
---
Aylegaming is great. He does a great job of explaining people’s questions, and is pretty chill. He groups up with Navac and Kargoz a lot too who are incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the game. 
---
Check him out! https://www.twitch.tv/aylegaming
---
I’m not too worried about the leveling process, I rarely make alts and if I do it will be one at most.  I typically spend all of my time and effort on one character so a couple extra days spent leveling doesn’t really factor into my consideration.
---
Also I’ve been learning some neat tricks for Paladin leveling that have me kind of excited for it.
---
How do you do this?
---
An ugly faction judging an attractive faction by their shoulder pads? Who are you? Rupaul?
---
At least for AQ40/naxx40.
---
this is subreddit for classic wow , not private server. anything related to privated server is against subreddit policy
---
You all are NAILING it!!
---
Thanks to the addon developers and testers!
---
https://willitclassic.com
---
You don't need to spec as tank to tank leveling dungeons. Go full DPS and bring your sword and shield. Just make sure you're not wearing cloth.
---
I think there are some opportunities to troll having stealth and being uncatchable in wpvp.
---
Tauren extra reach and stun, and health. Orc axe and stun resist..to name a few. Best racials to horde
---
I played one from vanilla to bfa 1-120. Just don't. It's painful.
---
You just go to twitch setting and allow blizzard access.
---
But I trolled myself because at first I thought the email I got was a beta invite. Sad.
---
WoW3 is completely gone as an option for me in game so I guess there's no part 3 to this stress test. Not for me anyway :-/
---
I don’t plan to become a big streamer. But I will be streaming my whole process 1-60, I’ll be leveling a warrior/shaman duo. I don’t really expect views lol
---
&gt;Nobody says that
---
Asmongold was just saying this on his stream. 
---
&gt;(if you add new gear class balance WILL change).
---
Well I'm also in the camp of people who wouldn't mind rebalancing. After a year or two of 1.12 and Naxx is on farm, sure why not improve offspecs a bit? That's a part of TBC anyways, and TBC is what the anti-1.13 people mostly want.
---
&gt;Current blizzard knows how to make good PvE, but doesn't understand good rewards, or how to design a good grind, or how to create new lore.
---
The nice thing is that this is pretty much already solved if you just follow along with vanilla progression.
---
&gt;If the only reason you play a mmorpg is endgame, retail is a lot better than classic for that. 
---
Big disagree, retail is hardly even an mmorpg anymore. I want endgame PvE and PvP, but with the design philosophy of vanilla.
---
There was a "sappd girls can't say no" on my server.
---
Vanilla was never hard, even in its original form.  Completely agree.
---
Wand spec and spirit tap make leveling ez. A priest can open with holy fire, follow up with a smite into swp, cast a mindblast while being beaten on then wand.
---
Me may be at 70% mana.
---
With the spirit tap buff you can kill 6 mobs before really being in Amman’s trouble...so for that mob you just Holy Fire, swp...wants to death. 
---
Pop a renew and start back up. 
---
A priest never has to buy water or stop killing shit. 
---
Once you get shadowform you can blast, pain, mf, r1 fear, mf, wand and never go oom or see your health dip
---
Good idea. Two full levels of mob grinding. That's a lot of stuff to vendor.
---
This is some Brexit shit right here.
---
I... I don't even think this dignifies a response... If your standard for hardcore is "no guild bank" then you're going to have a fucking miserable time in this game. 
---
Do what the 10 year olds playing classic WoW on bisque colored Gateway PC's running windows xp did... Send them to the guild bank alt and trust your guildies! Enjoy classic, wait until you find out that mail isn't instant when sent between guildies!!
---
I don't hate them, it's just a joke.
---
It's not griefing. If it was they would've coded it such that falling into water from height with water walking on wouldn't damage you (or you'd just fall through the surface of the water in lieu of taking damage).
---
It's been a mechanic for as long as the game has existed, and many people have died to fall damage from water walking. If it was something they would punish people for doing, then they'd change how the mechanic worked to avoid the problem condition.
---
Twitch.tv/xanaduwow
---
Depends on PvE vs PvP
---
What does this get you?
---
Fury is probably best with booming voice/piercing howl/enrage - all very nice talents for tanking. If you want a more dps style arms with SS is probably the way to go.
---
It was not unheard of for people to recover their sold characters by claiming they were hacked. I know people who sold their characters for $350 and got them back a year or two later :-)
---
45 is a good time to commit to holy/disc. At 50 the more difficult dungeons start and you can't get away with shadow healing anymore in my opinion.
---
I dont think im gonna craft my own gear but i will have maxed professions and fishing/cooking by the time i hit 60.
---
Love taking the time out every once in a while to breakup the monotony of leveling. Plus its SO nice to have everything finished when you hit 60. No scrambling for gold to buy shit off the AH to powerlevel your profs.
---
Paladins skills are more expensive than other classes that I guarantee. Maybe not 100g more expensive but they definitely pay more for training than any other class.
---
Gathering professions basically.  
---
You wont be doing any kind of mob farming as prot.  At least not to the point where it would make a lot more sense just to go herbing/mining just about anywhere else in the world.
---
How's healing in classic? I know about downranking, but would I still expect to see paladins in some cloth, for example?
---
I want some frankenpatch of TBC and 1.13. Like redisign all of TBC to be in line with Vanilla stats, make Outlands level 45 or 50-60 content, take away flying mounts and the fucking dailies, no new playable races, pallies and shaman stay Alliance and Horde, etc. Probably impossible to do correctly though.
---
Not mad at all.
---
The most honest, realistic post here and it's sitting at 7 downvotes. I love this community's naivete when it comes to what classic really is. I can't wait for the rude awakening when your "2 hour dungeon allotment" is spent simply trying to form the group. Then you get there and find out your tank is braindead and causes you to spend 3x as long to clear Wailing Caverns thanks to how many times you have to corpse run. Then the healer gets lost because the dungeon is a literal maze, and the next thing you know, your wife has left you because you've been on the computer for the last 9 hours.
---
Hope it's as fun as you think it's going to be! Enjoy the ludicrous progress you'll be making raiding "4 hours a week". Yeah, you'll be a real commodity to that guild.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-classic. I just legitimately look forward to the inevitable 180 the nostalgia goggle wearing community is going to do when it really sinks in over what classic was really like back then. You mocked J. Allen Brack about his "you think you do, but you don't" comments but he wasn't wrong.  Condescending maybe, but not wrong.
---
If you're a parent and legitimately believe that you're capable of finding enjoyment with classic wow without devoting a minimum of 12 hours a week to the game, then more power to you. Just temper your expectations when it comes to what kind of content you will realistically be able to participate in.  If you think retail is boring, then what exactly do you call the act of spamming "/1 LFM BRD need healer and rogue PST" for 40 minutes straight?  Immersive?
---
It is tough to ever use thunderclap in vanilla just due to how tough it is to get enough rage for anything.
---
Downvotes apparently.
---
Perhaps I'm mis-remembering but you still had to be outside of the instance to summon, did you not?
---
True dat.
---
I thought it was a backup of a backup kept at an offsite facility that held backups of those backups
---
It's not weird to play the opposite gender, at all.
---
In WoW and many, many other games, sexual dimorphism is greatly exaggerated and tailored to be attractive for one of two reasons:
---
1. To fulfill a power fantasy for the player. Bulky, roided out characters are designed partly from this perspective.
---
2. Exaggerated sexual attraction. We are very visual creatures, and given how successful sex, the porn industry, fan service, etc are, this obviously appeals to a lot of people.
---
If you pick a female character because the race/class combo you have chosen to play has animations and proportions that tickle your fancy more than the male model does, that's fine. That's the extreme sexual dimorphism and video game power fantasy working as intended. It isn't weird, it doesn't say anything about your sexuality, masculinity, or indicate any kind of latent deviance or anything like that.
---
You don't need to convince anybody to do the same, as they may choose their characters for their own subjective personal tastes, and you don't need to defend, explain, or validate your choice of video game pixels. At most it's analogous to an author writing about a protagonist that is the opposite gender they are.
---
Play what you want. I used to mostly play male characters despite not being a dude. I occasionally get some crap for it by super fragile people but I don't care, and neither should you.
---
Kinda funny to see how much I got downvoted for confirming that I played vanilla and don't agree that private server problem of too many people per area will be an issue in classic.
---
Nah I’m genuinely curious, what does linking twitch and battle.net do? I didn’t downvote
---
SM Cath, as Horde, on a PvP server, is actually a sound xp grind.
---
Who said anything about being "hard"?  Vanilla was always an easy game to figure out.  Scholo, Strath?  Trash being removed?  Respawn rates decreased?  As time went on, Blizzard dumbed things down.
---
Again, not to insinuate that things were hard to begin with.  Which is why Classic and 1.12 is so lol.  MC will be be 1 hour snooze fest with 1.12 talents.  Even AQ40 will be easier with the 1.11 tanking buffs.  DPS was already threat capped before 1.11 hit.  After that, we were able to go ham for the most part.
---
I asked the same question a few months ago, when I started leveling a Warrior on a pserver, and the comment I found had the most accurate info was [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aeumlf/relaxing_warrior_leveling_builds_without_the/edv0fxw/)
---
Essentially, a 2H, Deep Wounds / Imp OP Arms build.
---
Protection talent tree is for endgame raiding only.
---
It was announced like 3-4 months ago it only requires subscription.
---
Vanilla scenario: Your guild is in AQ40. Warlock quits. You recruit a new Warlock who is in pre-raid gear. He won't exactly be your top DPS, but you can still carry him along until he gets gear. Pre-raid gear is enough to meet the minimum DPS checks - he just needs to learn mechanics. Your guild continues to make progress on its normal schedule. Everyone is happy.
---
TBC scenario: Your guild is in BT. Warlock quits. You recruit a new Warlock in pre-raid gear. Your guild now needs to run the new Warlock through Karazhan, SSC, and Hyjal before you can even set foot in Black Temple again. Pre-raid gear is probably enough to make the minimum DPS checks in BT, but it doesn't matter because your new recruit can't zone in. Your guild's progress comes to a halt until the new player is attuned. Everyone is unhappy.
---
The TBC situation gives people an incentive to leave their guild for the top guild on the server, who will only recruit attuned players, while every other guild on the server is stuck recruiting pre-raid players and then running content that they no longer need just to attune the new recruits.
---
Basically, he is saying a tank can start a group and post their intent.  
---
The intent being that he will be reserving the high value items of strat (Live side) for himself.  
---
Good luck with that I say, but if you are willing to wait a lot longer for a group to form, then yea, it can work in theory.  I remember a lot of people trying to do this in vanilla, but at the end of the day there will come a time where less people are running/needing 5 mans outside of the things he would be reserving.
---
It was just a joke.
---
1.12 talents
---
It is extremely slow.  There is no trick to it, it is just frickin painstaking.
---
What's a zoomer?
---
Can you please delete this post? I wanted to do the exact same thing, but now more people know about it b/c of this post.
---
the giggles.
---
Those two tapes are mainframe z/os tapes. Did they really keep them backed up on the mainframe?
---
It's been a really long swing since cata
---
No, it came from the back up of that back up's back up.
---
MOBAs, for example.
---
I was on a high pop server and just before TBC my friend on same server, sold his account for $900 AUD. He had a decent geared warrior probably BWL gear(gnome - guild offtank).
---
Plus a 60 rogue + 60 mage.. they might have had some MC leftover items on them as we had MC and BWL on farm
---
Price was definitely tied to class and gear. I reckon mage and rogue probably didn't even add much to the price, people frothed over warriors.
---
My bro sold his MC/BWL geared druid for $100.
---
I held onto my rogue with perditions, think I got sucked back in late TBC.
---
You could in vanilla, but you can't in classic. This is why people have been asking for the addition of focus since it would replicate what was available through scripting in vanilla.
---
Hell. It's about time.
---
The true heros of beta
---
Honestly I'm not sure. I just recall them saying at Blizzcon that the only useful vanilla version they could find was a backup of a backup on a tape drive from an offsite facility.
---
Yes. The old days. I've missed it.
---
lol... there is a very clear difference between tanking with a 2h and using a shield.  
---
Yes.. it 'can' be done.  It does not mean it will work with the average pug, or that the healer will appreciate being forced to work overdrive the entire run.  
---
Most people on beta are more dedicated players, and many have gone out of their way to get as much high end gear as possible on their way to 30, because there is no real rush.  It will be completely different when people are 'hitting and quitting' 5 mans just to move on after their quests when it hits live.
---
Given that I don't have much time to play (mostly weekends) this time around, and given my focus on pvp, my top choices at the moment are hunter or warlock.
---
I am mostly interested in getting to 60 and PVPing in BG's and doing some casual raiding (to leverage gear for PVP).
---
Right now I'm leaning toward night elf hunter, in part because I've heard warlocks can be incredibly gear dependent in PVP. Would I be disappointed by the pvp potential of a lock without T2? I also like the idea of having stealth hunter + stealthy pet for WSG and AB defending.
---
The only thing holding me back from choosing hunter is that I only have the time to invest in one character, and I'd be fencing myself into a class that will fall off in PVE and PVP over time, and one that struggles against warlocks, which are shaping up to be one of the most populated horde classes this go around. Is that a misconception? I'm also hoping to do a lot of premades BGs, and I'm not sure if there is a general preference for warlocks or hunters.
---
Also--if anyone had suggestions for other classes I might not have considered carefully enough, I'd like to hear that as well. The classes I've ruled out are paladins, priest, shamans, and warriors. Mage also sounds like it might be a good fit, but I tried leveling one on a private server and I wasn't enjoying the playstyle much up to \~30.
---
Thanks!
---
I don’t know. I guess it just lets blizzard share your battle tag info with twitch.
---
Wtf is a pokimane
---
Did you actually look at them yourself? Every single boss in naxx is held by alliance except for Gothik and that time is so ridiculous there must be something wrong with it.
---
Feel like I'll be looking at a damage meter more than I'll be stuck in frost nova so I'm okay with it.
---
Mage is good for grind gold farming, Hunter is good for "turn you brain leveling and farming". Rogues are hard to level (easier if you feed them some gear from your main) but can do some targeted farming by sneaking to last boss for particular loots. 
---
Instead of spending 50 gold to go DPS and 50 gold to go back to raid spec I think ALT can be a viable option.
---
it lets you chat on the official hearthstone streams etc
---
Im going to do the same more so to build a guild and not so much a stream though

---
Iron forge hands down.
---
Have you heard of Blessing of Salvation? That's literally a 30% dps bonus to every relevant dps in the raid because anyone playing seriously enough to care about their DPS is pushing the threat cap.
---
Yeah I made a priest on a pserver and I'm loving the leveling aspect
---
Only thing I'd see is getting invited to groups to start with, you always have the option of starting a group yourself but I'd say definitely find a guild to get friendly with tanks and healers:)
---
Thanks for the idea. I'd actually considered doing that. I struggle with the morality of it.
---
Watch some of TipsOut videos where he talks about Private Servers data. Warriors are TOP DPS even on the fourth week of MC.
---
Alright someone was watching asmongold earlier
---
Ill never forget the red version of this because it's the drink I used to chase the shrooms I took the first time I tripped
---
The utility two hunters can bring to 5 mans will be great. If you raid together you'll have great tranq shot communication which is one of the biggest things hunters do in vanilla raids. If raids utilize hunter kiting you can always pick that up yourself.
---
Hey same, I don’t have a webcam or anything, but I’ll Main tank and guild leader to my future guild. :) Just watch for some awesome game play. Good luck man
---
&gt;Well I'm also in the camp of people who wouldn't mind rebalancing.
---
I also want this, but I just don't believe current blizzard can do it.
---
&gt;TBC is what the anti-1.13 people mostly want.
---
Personally, I want 1.13, but only if blizz understands what made wow vanilla what it was. There is a talk about what the devs were thinking when they did the game, if blizz shows that they understand that, I would love 1.13, but I know what TBC did, and overall is a expansion I would enjoy (to be honest, I only enjoyed the PvE, and I didn't like the new lore, world and arena).
---
&gt; The nice thing is that this is pretty much already solved if you just follow along with vanilla progression.
---
If they do that we will end with power creep and that isn't healthy for pvp, you can't have pvpers to be also hardcore raiders.
---
Thats why, personally, wouldn't create content post nax, but overtune the last raids, create content between those with new gear (weaker than the old gear), but this only works on new servers so its pretty much useless.
---
&gt;retail is hardly even an mmorpg anymore.
---
Thats why I want classic, I'm willing to sacrifice that endgame PvE and having everything else be better.
---
You're wearing clothes?
---
That's really stupid. Request Invite should have stayed, it only enhances the social feelings of the game and encourages grouping.
---
I think he's referring to my current lifestyle that is only reflected by my bland Reddit post in the pursuit of stirring up controversy
---
I want the classes in the state of TBC, with a rework of the content to stay on Azeroth and exclude flying.
---
You're right
---
Fear Ward is better than every horde racial ability combined for top-end PvE, and Paladins are better than all of those and Shamans put together for both PvE and group PvP.
---
mmmm, didn't know that
---
I am very out of touch with retail WoW
---
Did she try warlock? Just curious. It's still a pet class but with awesome quests to unlock each demon and they are all so unique.
---
Yeah I plan on taking engineering at 60. Grenades are too good to pass up
---
I may be bias, but undead had the coolest videos.
---
What's your eventual goal?
---
Keep in mind raids will have 40 slots but but only 2 for tanks.  Do you want to be one of those 2?  Even if you are Molten Core is *really* bloody easy.  You honestly don't even need to spec prot to run it.
---
As for how to level, yes, you'll want to constantly carry a tank set with you and update/upgrade it constantly as you level.  There are no mythic/heroic/hardmode/whatever settings in vanilla so you never actually have to be prot to run the dungeons (and if anyone starts complaining that you should be... run away... far away from them... they're an idiot).
---
You can get nades before 60, mid 20s i think
---
Fuck it, better be made of moon rock for that price.
---
Wow that’s almost as many people that got beta Invs
---
Totally anecdotal but yeah, going back to my vanilla experience there was definitely a greater sense of unity among the Horde. I played in Closed/Open beta EU and was part of quite a few WoW/WC3 communities prior to release. It appeared back then that most peoples preference was to play Alliance, so me and my friends specifically rolled Horde for a challenge and to have more people to fight. Alliance outnumbered Horde everywhere in the world and our guild was really the only good Horde guild where Alliance had 3-4 active decent guilds. Yet we rolled the Alliance in almost every wPVP situation, even whilst being outnumbered and even whilst fighting outdoor bosses and Alliance guilds simultaneously. Horde back then really had to get better or just give up, where Alliance could coast with their superiority in numbers.
---
Have no idea what it's like post-vanilla since wPVP barely exists, and obviously this was just my experience on my particular server.
---
I guess. Good luck in classic man!
---
Yeah but I wont need them as much. I want go alchemy first
---
Eh, the odds of everyone in a 5 man premade leveling group getting all the gear they need at every step of the way post 16~ for the sake of optimal dungeon running is extremely low.  
---
A lot of these streamer teams were decked out in every possible dungeon drop they could get (some even from higher levels than you otherwise would have been running anyway); not to mention every warrior and their mother got the whirlwind axe at 30, which is already going to make a massive difference. 
---
I remain skeptical until we see a fresh start and true to form testing of the method.
---
You'll have the same issues running as any two dps classes. Hell some people might love you both joining runs as 2x hunters fill up some niche loot slots, leaving the other 3 to pick and choose among what they want (hand of justice, melee weps, caster stuff etc.)
---
Just an fyi blizzard tracks your ip so if they notice you log on from another state they ban instantly then look into it
---
Hmm?
---
I don't think they will, I think it's more likely they will release BC servers. If they do release BC, I'd like them to do it such a way that we can clone a character from Classic, continue playing that Classic character but also switch to play the BC character who is now on a diverged path.  There should be no interaction between servers after the initial clone.
---
If they were to continue releasing more Vanilla content, I hope it look something like this doc (not my OC, found it on Reddit about a year ago).

Giving my bro a shout out. He's got a lot of experience. Answer every question in chat that's asked of him. For some reason has a bigger Chinese following right now.
---
Nerfing Cata Heroics was kinda the beginning imo.  Nothing good followed that.
---
Ok, forgive my memory- it's been a while since Vanilla and I never played mage to max level until Legion. And I never said Horde wasn't easier, it definitely was! But it wasn't a nightmare for Alliance to get to Onyxia lol. Dustwallow is a low level zone so running across it was just an inconvenience not some insurmountable task.
---
IDK my old male night elf looked like a fucking beast in tier 6.
---
Awesome! Thanks for letting me know about this!
---
You too brother
---
Lol at all you nerds saying the streamers weren't beta testing
---
Dawg idk what your talking about I look at my character the whole time I level
---
Fuck off, give credit where credit is due and quit being so pessimistic.
---
This is a cheap accident. I for example, have on one peacfull AQ raid chugged all my remaining flasks of Distiled Wisdom thinking they were Nature Resistence pots. It's the same icon with almost the same green colour. Saltmines are still running.
---
Cooldowns are independent
---
Pretty sure mining will always be the more consistent of the two in the end game.  Keep in mind that engineers are likely going to be more common now that we truly can see how powerful it is in both PvP and PvE.  
---
Herbalism has that chance at the jackpot picks later on, but I can only imagine just how rare it will be do actually get those black lotus for yourself during most hours of the day.  
---
Both are good.  Both can be done in conjunction with most mob farming spots.  
---
However... herbalism has an edge when paired with alchemy, which is the true money maker of vanilla.  Blacksmiths aren't going to make much of anything as opposed to just selling the raw mats anyway (unless you are one of the lucky few to get certain plan drops very early).
---
I'm not really going to go point by point here because a lot of these vary from server to server, I didn't raid so can't answer that, so on and so forth so I'll stick to casual play and competition/griefing/etc.
---
I'm about as filthy casual as it gets. I've always been basically a free honor kill, too, but I love PvP. So first off, the main question you should ask is ***do you enjoy pvp, even when you are not expecting it and not the one to initiate it?***
---
If the answer to that is a negative, then don't roll on a PvP realm. If you feel like getting camped in STV is griefing, game breaking, and completely unfun, you might want to just opt out of PvP realms entirely. If you take a more lightheartd approach to it, and don't mind finding something else to do until they go away or finding somewhere else to level, then I'd say give it a try.
---
With regards to competition, whether you play on a PvP server or a PvE server, you will be competing with other players of both factions for herbalism nodes, especially high level or lucrative ones. Whether or not players can kill you and steal your node will not have a significant impact on this. They will either get there before you do or they won't, ultimately you will have to accept competition will be a thing regardless of how you play and what server type you choose.
---
Here's how I view PvP servers. Like you I am quite enamored with the heightened danger lurking around every corner. I also like to join groups to raid enemy quest hubs like Southshore to entice their PvPers to come out and play. However I don't run around ganking random lowbies, and I'm not a very good PvPer myself (usually play healers to boot), I'm basically a free honor kill and an easy gank even for players around my own level. I suck. I still have lots of fun. I laugh when I get ganked, and I find something else to do if I'm getting camped. If this sounds like your cup o' tea, then try a PvP server. If it doesn't, I'd opt out.
---
I saw in asmon clear of scarlet (armory iirc) that they sent someone to buy ammo and then summoned him in the middle of the instance since respawns were just behind them.
---
\&gt;  rogues are low   
---
Or maybe they're the most numerous of all...
---
Girls, you're both pretty, let's try to get along.
---
If I dont /dance as a naked nelf female how else am I supposed to make gold
---
I think blizz stealth nerfed classic.
---
I was watching streams where complete noobs would run into a pack of 5 mobs in a cave and somehow live. 
---
The “players are better now” argument didn’t even apply, these were fortnite players who never played wow before, who could barely cast spells and would accidentally chain pull mobs that should have wiped them yet they still managed to live.
---
I watched my guildy who is decent play beta and he was literally one shotting mobs his lvl with backstab, I couldn’t even do that during tbc on my rogue.
---
100% blizzard has stealth nerfed classic, they hate the game and it’s fans with a passion and this is how they will sabotage it.
---
Give up man, no more Beta invites
---
What I'm doing is going to get 4 characters to level 10 which shouldnt take more than 5 hours or so each. Put 3 of them into an inn and level one as my main. Every two weeks (rest xp stops after two weeks) Ill grind out the xp I've gained on at least one maybe switch between them. I hope to grind two alts per two weeks but it will depend on what my Main is at at the time.
---
Errrrr, I guess you never realized that alchemy is among the best money makers in the entire game. 
---
Herbalism alone likely isn't as profitable as mining, but trying to get alchemy up with gold alone is going to set you back many hundreds of gold which should always be factored in.
---
Honestly, do you not know how to take a screenshot?
---
Pros: 
---
Super easy leveling and two hunters don't really interfere with each other. 
---
Hunter is one of the lest gear dependent class in the game so you do good DPS no matter the gear.
---
World PVP is very unlikely anyone would attack two hunters. That is 4 bodies to CC and if you run opposite directions. no dead zone.
---
Cons:
---
Finding a group by typing "LF Tank, Healer, and a DPS, have two hunters" will be a bit of a challenge.
---
You are definitely rolling on each other gear in lower level dungeons.
---
Minimal group utility or buffs. 
---
People have bias against hunters, let alone two of them.
---
If you are looking to raid there are usually 3 hunters. As a couple you are one unit so if one of you is gone both of you are gone so as a raid leader would I want to go from 3 hunters to 1 overnight? (tranq shot is my main concern here)
---
yes, do u need anything sir scrubbles?
---
I think the reason wow used to have so many toxic players was because many played it at a young age, now kids are playing fortnite and a million other games where they can be rude in. Classic is going to be played by an older cloud
---
Ive always tanked and been a dps since wotlk.  I really am considering healing this time around.  Just a few questions though
---
I plan on playing with some friends and want to show off my epeen healing, what class should I heal with?  
---
Is druid really an interactive healer who has utility to keep her healing interesting?   I know she's not top charts but is her utility spells used enough to make her hard to learn?  
---
What is hpally like?   I read it's a buff not, refresh buffs on 40 people every five minutes. I imagine hpally is really popular, should I expect to see an absolute high amount of competition of gear for hpally?  
---
For priest really just wondering if holy or disc is more fun on your opinion. I've never created a priest in wow.  I read in classic they're incredible healers, may give it a shot.
---
People who usually do nothing but PvE roll Alliance because Paladin buffs work better in that environment.
---
False
---
Too bad Mountain Dew is nearly unfit for human consumption.... It's one of if not the most unhealthy soft drink.

Twitch.tv/Booshies 
---
He is a pretty good streamer and small time content creator maining warrior. Decently entertaining and informative to watch too!
---
Dec 24th 2007, the first Christmas of TBC, me and some other no lifer Horde who werent spending time with Family decided to camp Honor Hold instead. We held it for a couple hours before a Nightelf in blue GM robes showed up, froze all of us in an ice block hunter trap, then teleported us all above Thrallmar, and let us fall to our deaths. He comes floating down a moment later and was like "oops, forgot to put slowfall on yall" then hit us with the mass resurrect.
---
We were geeking out "do it again do it again" so he did, this time with slow fall. For the next hour or so we were hanging out with him in Thrallmar, doing GM shit. One guy asked to be teleported to a random spot, and the GM chose right in front of Doomlord Kazzak...all we saw was a tauren disappear and then heard "All mortals will perish!" And we knew what had happened...
---
Before he left he summoned thrall, made him huge, and do a dance for all of us as he disappeared. 
---
They only do that during holidays I heard
---
&gt;Corpse camping or killing low level sound almost like griefing to me but its somewhat accepted in wow.
---
A lot of us genuinely find both of these fun. I get why other players don't, but it is "somewhat accepted" because a lot of us genuinely enjoy it.
---
Blizzard has already shown us proof from back then (at least in regards to lvl 1-30) to certain elites that were in heavy question. 
---
Bottom line is that on the beta, there are few people who outright suck like people did back then, so clearing instances is simply much easier than most of us thought.
---
Yeah good thinking it is worth power levelling engi at 60
---
its the only classic wow content right now
---
Agreed. 
---
clips.twitch.com should be put on the same AutoMod removal list as the names of private servers.
---
you're totally right, SM *is* super major. Just mentioned why I didn't include it, *despite* SM.
---
What if you reset the instance before you log out?
---
Pets shouldn't lose Happiness in BGs or PvP kills from what limited experience I had as a 54? Hunter in original Classic.
---
back in my day twinking meant totally different thing
---
Hi, /u/crabmancam
---
Hi, /u/KelTobano
---
Or the Galaxy brain option where they use what they feel for from BC to create content past .12?
---
The skill in druid is choosing which of your healing touch ranks to cast. Party members will completely oblivious as to whether you're doing this well or not except when you screw it up and let people die or run out of mana.
---
I can't speak for hpally or priest.
---
I just downvote. I don't even watch them clips.
---
Arms, my dude. 31/20/0 is 100% fine tanking any dungeons until 40 mans.
---
Should I expect to have a hard time finding raids as a resto druid?
---
I agree with everything you wrote.
---
It's getting ridiculous
---
They have 3 mages, a lock and a priest. Doing monster pulls using eye of kilrogg then massive aoeing packs down with engineering
---
Ok, but how long was it in vanilla before you were really chainpulling in UBRS with completely random pugs?  I don't remember things like that becoming the norm until it was common to get many people with some basic raiding gear or high end crafted stuff.  
---
Granted, could be much different this time around, but people were most certainly not capable of that kind of stuff in the first year of vanilla, especially before they improved dungeon loot and reworked talents.
---
Anyone here remember a dagger rogue video, human make decked out in AQ40 and Naxx gear. Murdering people to Lolipop song? Been looking for ever can't remember his name.
---
I'd be interested to know what people think the 'good names' are.  I personally don't find the meme names (Bowjob etc) especially appealing.
---
I’m here to drink bleach and slay goblins. And I’m all out of bleach. Take it away lizard guy.
---
 /spit is all you need.
---
I have some on my shelf. They're not shaped correctly
---
Playing the long game, I like it. Could step it up even more and play multi box lol.
---
People used to pay thousands for a maxed out T2 - T3 character. A fresh level 60 was like a few hundred at best.
---
The books don't have a Night King.
---
As other have said, duo dire maul east with a good warr.
---
There are heaps of herbs and mining nodes in dm:e and you d/e the blues from bosses to enchanting mats.
---
You can also sell the boss drops to players, instead of disenchanting the gear you can carry players through the dungeon and sell them the boss drops.
---
Healers can also run scholomance for dark runes (dark runes are used in raids to restore mana) healers get priority on dark runes, so you can run school to get them to sell on AH or use in raids.
---
Congrats bro
---
If I could play on both regions with one subscription I would kiss the dev´s ***.
---
I did look at everything through MC BWL and AQ and got bored at that point. Almost every single one is Horde. Also the overall speedruns are all Horde apart from Naxx. It is interesting that it flips heavily Alliance favoured with Naxx, I suspect that's due to there being a much smaller sample size for Naxx raids in general since Naxx wasn't released/wasn't scripted properly on a lot of servers and it just happens most of the best guilds were playing Alliance on the servers that do have Naxx records.
---
I need this addon in my life.
---
I remember when I played bc/ vanilla and my friend came over and we spent the day gearing out my twinnk. I told my dad I was so excited about my twink. Lil
---
lol even if I wanted to spend another 15 dollars a month on it Im not sure my computer could handle it. I get dcd on pservers all the time in cities and starting zones.
---
probably because the only way to see classic right now is through a content creator. its not like everyone here can get their hands on the game anytime they want.
---
yeah you can taunt pets, but if you are in a CC you cant taunt, you are cc:ed.
---
i dont understand why the moderator of this subreddit do not control this endless streamer no contexm post and links to streamer twitch advertisement , also no control over endless fanboys prmoting their fav streamer here..
---
WOW classic is not about streamers , if ppl want to watch streamers they go to twitch , if ppl have their own favoritte streamers they to their own streamer subreddit.. yet these shills and fanboys intentionally pollute this subreddit with their constant cross post and streamer promotion here..
---
is this Classic Woaw subreddi or Classic WoW Streamer promotion subreddit ?
---
People talk about how much they hate the Hand of Justice grind, but everyone who has done it remembers how it went down and probably looks back on it fondly.
---
Under your guidelines then bringing high level mobs back to cities is a bannable offense.
---
How about we just have streamers find clever ways to avoid trolls and not require a special team of GMs dedicated to make sure streamers don't have their feefees hurt?
---
If people are well informed why would 75% be Horde? 
---
Alliance has the edge in PvE and in Pre-made PvP (which is where the PvP rewards come from) due to Paladins. 
---
And why would 75% be undead and 75% of those rogue? Rogues are good in both PvE and PvP and have always been popular so they'll be overpopulated, but you really only want one in a PvP pre-made for WSG room guarding, if people were making well informed rather than decisions based on 14 year old PvP ganking videos they wouldn't be going Rogue to such an extent.
---
Most of the clips aren't even content though. it's some pointless shit that isn't special or exciting. "X person says this!" "Y person hit level A!" "Z person ganks B and you WONT BELIEVE how they react"
---
Yeah, that's not supposed to happen lol
---
I always felt that 4 people playing really well could clear a levelling dungeon, so if you can't do it with 5 is not X person who is bringing the whole group down, but a little everybody.
---
Eh, at least you missed the dual spec crap that came with it.  Not a total loss.
---
Should I roll Rogue or Warrior? Which one is easier for beginners?
---
I never played Vanilla, I only played WoW for 3 months (BFA). I played mostly as DH.
---
I dont like to tank, only DPS. I'll be mostly raiding and PVPing. Most of the time I'll play solo.
---
Next: Horde or Alliance? Which Race should I go for?
---
oh absolutely! Rogue leather working going to be fantastic :)
---
Sonii submitted the bug. In original vanilla you were able to challenging shout right before you step into the trap and force the pet to attack you. 
---
It does not work like that in Classic.
---
Nah no way is it 100 gold. MAYBE if you buying every single spell for every pet and yourself. But you know thats the wrong move
---
Ya, fair enough. Sounds like you know what you're ganna be playing :P
---
As pumped as I would be for a BC expansion, I think it would be way more fun if they reused BC, Wrath and whatever expansion’s content but keep it on Azeroth without flying. Raise the level cap to 70. Introduce Blood Elves, I guess Draenei too, for balance.
---
Redo Grim Batol, Twilight Highlands, Hyjal and Uldum. Kara, ZA, CoT.
---
&gt; I worry a lot of people are going to burn out if they rush to 60
---
oh there is going to be tons of people like this, they are also going to be the first on here complaining how classic is boring and underwhelming. Going into classic with the mentality of retail is going to ruin this game. Retail is about the finish line, classic is about the journey
---
I actually prefer tanking and healing. Mostly because both roles are pretty vital in deciding how a group is managed.
---
I really enjoy some DPS classes and can keep up, but I feel like in every MMO they are the easiest to get into a game.
---
I'm not a big fan of the priest though, I prefer more uncommon healers like the hybrids, mainly the druid and paladin.
---
I will probably end up having a DPS Mage but tanking is kind of my thang.
---
I honestly dont care if you dont beleive me just trying to prevent bans
---
15 years into the game I feel like they should cap the raid size at 30 on launch day and groups at 3. Will make things interesting.
---
Advertising / getting eyeballs on their content. They can't turn off the hustle.
---
Yeah only buy useful leveling spells. Dont buy crazy gear on the ah, and grind mobs for a few levels pre 40. Iv never not had more than enough.
---
need to report thm as spam , i saw it is the same peopke that constantly post twitch links and it is annoyng to see thm spamming twitch streamer here.. fanboys can go gaga for their favorite streamers in their already existed subreddit , yet they maliciously cross post here instead of on the streamer subreddit.
---
either this subreddit focus on classic wow or it will become streamer yet another streamer and low effort meme subreddit full of useless stuff..
---
we need a pinned FAQ post so ppl do not ask same qustion on state of classic
---
we need to moderate the endless spam of streamer advertisemen and fanboyism as these have their own subreddit
---
Reposting what I said last week and was only met with downvotes.
---
&gt;I think allowing streamers clips turns r/classicwow into pretty much a repeat of r/livestreamfails ,which for the longest time was basically r/iceposidonclips until they made a move to restrict his content.
---
I find after adding asmond and esfand to my filtered posts the sub has felt a lot less like a second promotional platform for those 2 streamers and a lot less obnoxious with the reposts.
---
That's a Mountain Don't.
---
You’re a assuming the mods do anything here but make weekly stickied threads and delete repost.
---
I used to break hunter traps all the time back in retail.
---
just hit commanding shout/taunt right before you hit the trap.Most of the time the hunter doesnt realise what happened until it's too late
---
They both aren't particularly complex, but if you don't like tanking, then id suggest a rogue. In pvp, warriors hits hard, but don't do well solo, that's where rogues shine.
---
Still torn on what to play. I only really want to focus on one character, at most I'd level a 2nd character only while rested was a thing (so level one, when I'm done with that one for the day/tired of it, do the other for a while and park it in an inn and repeat) but even that is pretty doubtful. I didn't play much vanilla, think I got to 40 max at the time, so excited to fully experience this time around.
---
Main choices are Paladin and Mage. Paladin I'd go a Ret/Holy hybrid ideally. So that way I could do some damage while providing off healing/utility as well. Not sure how viable this is but I think that build would allow me to do that in both PvE and PvP decently without having to respec a million times. I'm not trying to be the best DPS here, but I want to put in the work and do it and see where it gets me, just not sure how viable this actually is. As for Mage its a bit easier being a pure DPS class but I know things like managing threat is a big thing, especially in later tiers when Fire becomes better and ignite control is a big thing. How did this work exactly? It seems kind of daunting to me but I'm not sure how this worked so don't know whats actually required of this kind of playstyle. Only thing I'm not super hot on is having to constantly drink after each pull even if you can make your own food/water. Plus I know there will be a ton of Mages around, and I'm a casual player at best who's OK but not amazing at games, so I worry about being able to raid, get geared up and such properly.
---
Warrior and Rogue are also sort of on the list, but a bit less since I know most Warriors are expected to off-tank, a role I don't enjoy too much (I don't like to have that kind of pressure on me, OK with healing/off-healing but I can't do tanking), plus I prefer 2 handed weapons on Warriors which I believe 2H Warriors aren't as good on Alliance side so theres that. As for Rogues the main thing is similar to Mages in that there will be 10000 of them and I'm not sure that I can set myself apart enough to make sure I secure a spot, though the gameplay seems to be much engaging then the Mage gameplay so thats a bonus there.
---
I know right? I've bought every game of theirs Rock N Roll racing, had 18 wow account subs going since vanilla with no lapse in payment and they didn't invite ME. I might not even play classic if they keep personally disrespecting me like this.
---
you cant reset an instance while you are inside and instance, this is a private server bug.
---
If you play a healing class just straight up plan on either respeccing a lot or get used to grinding in a healing spec. 
---
Mobs aren't terribly hard to kill so it's not like you'll straight up not be able to kill anything as holy. It'll just be slower. So you will learn to weigh the choice of "Is the gold to respec, then respec again later, worth it so that my farming goes faster". 
---
If you've got a goal in mind to farm for and know it will take a few days, a respec is probably smart. If you've got an extra hour or two to kill but might be healing a raid/dungeon later that night then it's probably not worth the gold and you should just farm in healing spec for a short time. 
---
Either way you'll respec a lot at 60 as any healing class. Tank class too, they can get away with a little more since DPS is still a part of tanking while healing you can straight up ignore it completely.
---
LFD may have worked, if it only kicked in xrealm after 10 minutes on being unable to form the group with ppl from your own server.  That feature just made you too anonymous and getting a group too convenient at the same time.
---
The devs on it now are mostly programmers and engineers. Not level designers, or game designers, or artists, etc.
---
Again, I didn't say it was revolutionary.  I just said they spent a lot of R&amp;D on it and it's bleeding edge.
---
It's an overengineered monitor stand for sure.   Overengineered monitor stands are expensive.  You could make a functional monitor stand without spending a ton of money.  Look at the hinges on the monitor stand, and look at a normal frictionless monitor stand or monitoring arm.  Notice how small they are on the Apple stand in comparison.  Now think about how much R&amp;D they had to spend to make those hinges.  Now do the same excessive for every other little detail.  Nobody else has a stand like the one they just made.
---
They didn't have to make an overengineered monitor stand... but that's Apple for you.  That's all I'm trying to convey.  I'm not saying it's impossible to make a cheap monitor stand that does the job of holding up a monitor.  It's expensive because Apple overengineers the crap out of everything, even when it's unnecessary.  In the end, you get something unique, but it's REALLY expensive.
---
That's what I mean by bleeding edge.  They made something nobody else made.  They did some crazy stupid things with that monitor stand that nobody else would do, because it would be too expensive to make.  I'm not putting any value judgement on what their bleeding edge is, or if any of the design decisions they made are worth it.
---
I don't buy Apple stuff because I don't really care about this kind of thing.  But I'm not their customer, and I'm not so oblivious that I can't see what they're doing with their hardware.  Some people like this kind of thing, and will pay more for it.
---
moderators , please automod the endless twitch link spam and known streamers name filtering so there wont be any more of silly advertisement and fanboysm here..
---
&gt; I just don't see how it can be that horrible? They would either just not balance it, or do some slight balance adjustment(with extensive testing).
---
Looking at the 15+ year history of WoW, they have never left something with in-game benefits imbalanced for long.  And when something was discovered to be imbalanced, they almost always over-correct to normalizing classes.
---
It's simply not possible to have 3v3 be balanced and still retain the high level of diversity that we had in Vanilla.  And people seeking rewards in 3v3 would never stop complaining about it until Bliz tried to balance it.
---
The same would happen with 3-player PvE content, but large group PvE/PvP content is less of an issue.
---
People don't demand that duels be balanced because there's no tracking/reward structure for them.  If they put a tracking/reward structure on dueling, the outcry over imbalance would be deafening.  If they implement small group PvP, the same would inevitably happen.
---
If you just want to test your skills against a similarly-sized group, then "group duels" would satisfy that.  But once you add tracking/rewards to it, things inevitably go bad.
---
idk i saw some cool things like aoe clothies running SM
---
They don't change mechanics to avoid griefing, they punish players who do it.
---
He doesn’t take himself too seriously and plays it up a bit for shits n giggles. He’s obviously an eccentric dude though.
---
There's not a single twitch clip on the front page, and I don't see any under new either. It's 95% memes.
---
Chromie was in vanilla, so...
---
Until they do, just use RES Keyword Filter to do it yourself.
---
I’m pretty set on warrior - but my only hesitation is I want to play all 3 specs. I want to be able to off tank for raids and dungeons since I think it will be easier to get a group. I want to mainly play fury dps in raids and I want to do some good old fashioned arms pvp. Obviously respec costs in vanilla are prohibitive to this so I am having second thoughts and considering playing rogue just to go combat swords for simplicity and just pure dps...especially since rogues are top tier melee dps. Thoughts?
---
if they like to stare at a male ass for thousands of hours ingame, let them xD
---
Why is there so much streamer content?  Probably because it's the only window into the game for 99% of people.
---
Well, I live on the east coast. Had to fly out west for work and brought wow on the flash drive. Logged in without issues, no ban. I don't believe because I'm proof that's not a true statement.
---
these streamers fanboys are currently here to promote their favorite streamers and they will brigade you with down votes.. i dont know why moderators allow twitch spam here without instant automoderation..
---
Not gonna lie that's half the reason I raided so hard lol. Fed off that attention.
---
There's no way in hell I could read from that far, hope your vision is still what it used to be!
---
So the story goes, in any case.
---
Until you realize Venezuelans will do it for .25 cents an hour because that's still better than any college educated career in their country.
---
can't defend a tree lul
---
No one has ever been punished for merking people with water walking just FYI.
---
Depended on when you sold and what you had, dunno about current mmos but most games back then sold very very well. Guildy sold max lvl on gw2 on day 2, leveled new account and sold again and then again all in the 1st week. Walked away with 2k for basically minimal work.
---
Agreeing with these guys, especially with how competitive classic will be. Everyone trying to pvp seriously will be throwing grenades left and right.
---
Also lots of stuns in MC and other raid content to resist!
---
They do, but it's a figure of lore and stories, but are hinted at being true.
---
Well it happened to me years back so im full of shit because you have experiance somthing other... ok bro i was just trying warn people but fuck me right
---
Hi, /u/Roldstiffer
---
I thought it was interesting too, but it ends up being that there's more shit being posted than actual good things.
---
Venezuela has one of the worst and slowest data infrastructures in the world. That’s not gonna work.
---
Undead priests have probably the strongest racial for both factions for pvp. Human priests for pve. 
---
As to who is better factions for pvp, I've never been able to reasonably assess one as being better over another, I think most people who comment on this are likely basing it on their own experiences, over hard facts.
---
What about Races for Rogue?
---
Undead or Orc?
---
Human or Gnome?

The phenomenon that time passes faster the older you get is actually a studied psychological effect. It’s due to the fact that you don’t have as many brand new experiences. During the first 20 years of your life you meet so many new people for the first time, you have so many new experiences - grade school, middle school, high school, driving, someone touches your pee pee(maybe), first time traveling somewhere, etc. 
---
As you get older there’s less of those moments, sure you’ll still have a few major ones like children and marriage but there’s a lot more been there done that moments.

However, they say happiness peaks in the 60s because you’ve got less to worry about and little things don’t bother you.

It's definitely not this video but maybe it's the same guy and could give you a lead? https://youtu.be/lxzzVdtx9r4

This has always struck me as a lame excuse from people who are ashamed that they really like being pretty hero girls. Nothing wrong with embracing your feminine side.
---
That's not how you should be viewing addictions at all. Yes there is a physical dependent component, but the psychological ones equally important. Very few people "smoke solely because something out of their control needs it", good example is they've built such strong association to stress relief and smoking, that they need it as a source of stress relief (even if nicotine is being sated elsewhere). Theres a myriad of other possible explanations, but you need to focus on what state of mind, emotion, thought is being produced (or being sought) whenever the substance is taken. And then focus on what circumstances cause that feeling to become highly desirable, and work on minimizing those circumstances / having other  more healthy coping mechanisms available to you when they arise.
---
Why would a healer get priority on an item that’s going to be sold on the AH?
---
Been glancing at this sub every few days, there's been little to none Twitch stuff, just when people are doing something different/first. I'm confused what's even being complained about here.
---
I somewhat agree, although the first week will take substantially longer to get out of the first few zones.
---
Hardcore guilds, maybe a little. Otherwise no.
---
Mythic + was a pretty good addition for Legion's expansion. Other than that yeah.
---
There is an ocean of difference between an engineer and a creative director/developer. Blizzard has always had exceptional engineers. It is only recently that their creative department has been shoddy, but there has been a significant decline in quality over the years.
---
Look, we are all excited for Classic, but people consistently give ridiculous reasons behind its development. “We did it!” Patting themselves on the back in a huge circle jerk. What they don’t consider is the creative cost of developing games. Titan sunk a hundred million dollars in creative development and they canned it in failure.  Only by the skin of their necks did they wiggle a game out of that failure. Classic has zero creative cost. It’s all engineers. The cost to develop the game compared to a new theoretical game, where Blizzard has had a streak of over budget failures, is pennies on the dollar. 
---
I trust Blizzard to engineer and create Classic. I do not trust their creative team to competently create novel content in the spirit of continuing classic.
---
You have that razor around the wrong way my friend. Better be careful with that.
---
Where it really gets confusing is when people start reusing the bottles for other materials such as sunscreen and eye drops.
---
why do retards worry about running out of content their noob asses won’t make it past AQ40 anyway.
---
We don’t need classic+ we need idiots like you to shut the fuck up and stop asking for stupid shit nobody wanted.
---
Classic has infinite replay ability, if you actually played the game you’d know this
---
Hiding the mailbox inside your Kodo is not griefing, no one ever got punished for this.
---
I did a lot of PvE stuff in TBC, but running H SH as a Warrior tank with a Priest, Fury Warrior, Rogue, and Hunter (who didn't trap the entire dungeon) and still made an execution run was the most memorable experience I had.
---
The next week, I got my Prot Paladin to 60, and did the same dungeon with 0 CC...yeah...
---
Ever hear about Charlie Manson?  Well we aren’t quite there yet but streamed worshipers are getting close. That’s why.
---
I have the same interests as you and I'm strongly considering hunter this time around.
---
Hunters will never have trouble being desirable to WSG premades since they're so good at chasing and escorting flag carriers. I understand that's because of their mobility skills and slows which have nothing to do with their gear. Hunters are one of the best classes at scaling with PvE gear which I understand you're not interested in, but it would at least break even with Warlock in that respect. If you did take the trouble to get geared you would easily stay relevant by annihilating cloth classes. I understand the class does struggle against a bit against warlocks but every class has its counters in vanilla.
---
You'd be interested in [this post](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=1070&amp;p=10234&amp;hilit=my+favorite+class#p10234) on barrens.chat, it makes a pretty good case for the class.
---
Compare this poll to a new one when people see the ‘farming soul shards’ and ‘please summon’ aspects. 
---
Cant help but feel warlocks being high is due to people who played DK looking for another edgy class (only half kidding here)
---
I was going to go Alliance this time. But then posts like this occurred. I have to be a Tauren. Mulgore is home. Now to pick a class.
---
You can easily heal any 5 man as shadow as long as your group is happy to wait a little longer for you to mana up.
---
Or a ... dearf?
---
What is the primary objective?
---
37 horde in thousand needles, 19 in arathi, 19 in desolace, 29 in stranglethorn, 18 (lvl30+) in hillsbrad.
---
They are doing it because they don't want to finish behind others.  The zones are an authentic high pop experience atm.
---
That’s been a problem on all release days, until they started sharing mob tags. Blizzard has confirmed they aren’t changing any spawn timers, which private servers like to decrease.
---
leveling as fury till level 40 is quite common, due to the fact that the arms tree early on doesn't provide significant increases to your dps. Post 40, with mortal strike, Arms becomes very good, while fury starts to require more hit to make use of its effectiveness, though you can still use fury (2h)
---
Pratchett ... next
---
Herods Shoulders as a level 19 Twink Hunter? Lol, good one.
---
TEH ARMS
---
Why would a GM interfere with PVP? Boooo
---
it does, not the one on the tv show but there is a night king in the books and winds of winter hasnt even come out yet so he could still be introduced
---
It's the heirloom shoulder, probably added sometime in Wrath
---
Why though?
---
What do you want from the game? If you don't care about end game content or pvp, are you only interested in leveling?
---
It's honestly people mad they're not in beta. That's the end of it. I for one am ecstatic I get to watch people play as opposed to sitting on the sidelines through another WoW beta.
---
If desert is aesthetic.  ..... I will be horde for classic though.
---
Wait you actually look at your keyboard when playing?
---
Just making stuff up now? No one had ever been punished for it?
---
The meeting stone version was added in Vanilla, but wasn't really utilized by many players.

Hillary
---
Ok so give me a name of a Dev that would have to be involved as creative lead or level designer that can get you guys to stop shifting goal post?
---
Jeff Kaplan? Who is trust worthy to develop it?
---
This idea that were better off waiting for wow 2 is a farce. Wow2 isn't coming and even if it was it wouldn't be made by the devs that we can actually trust. Ion has been shit on retail but he has redeemed himself on every decision he's made in classic, it helps he actually played vanilla wow, I'm not afraid of him developing the raids in the future content patches. Raids have been his best content in retail so far.
---
there has been at least 6 twitch streams in the last 6 hours,and also a bunch of youtube links to their channels
---
I didn’t think a Mage could beat a Warlock tbh even at 30. He was just so good at getting resets.
---
I'll be playing alliance, but i absolutely love tristfall!
---
With locks I'd go undead for aesthetics. Min/max wise Orc is the better choice for the stun resistance (the extra pet damage helps too but not massively). Wotf is helpful against other locks, but not stun resistance is incredible. Especially considering the prevalence of engineering/tidal charms in pvp; even classes without a stun get a stun.
---
Nope. At least not until TBC when everything became ratings.
---
Put the sword down, put your dress back on, and get back to spamming flash of light
---
I'd love to find someone with just a plain set of vods of just leveling. I hate all the crap the streamers do because they have views.
---
I'm playing classic hunter for the first time and I want master it. Watching your vids now
---
Maybe they can just add a filter for it.
---
Compared to what, like 50 meme posts? That's not that bad. I'm not a fan of people advertising their socials and twitches, but I haven't seen much of it.
---
Sounds like mods are getting rid of the worst offenders and it's a non-issue.
---
Orc or Human.
---
On a pvp server, you can't have characters of multiple factions :(
---
Raiding
---
That’s honestly my dream. Use assets from like 15 years of wow and just make it fit vanilla style content. They could literally just redo Karazhan and make the mobs level 62/3 and I would be happy.
---
It can happen if the log in attempt happens within a very small amount of time from beimg logged in to england then suddenly germany for instance.
---
they are worst than any cult .. any post that criticize their favorite streamers will be downvoted and brigaded out..
---
i hope sincerely that moderator of this subreddit will nip this streamer advertisement / promotion out of this subreddit now , before Aug 2019 launch
---
damn ya that sounds dope as hell why wouldn't you do that at least a couple times. 
---
Sounds like it would get boring after 3-5 times though. Even if it's technically the most efficient leveling I'd prob bug out to just do something else for a while.
---
They will most likely be on the streamers servers and also give up on the grind to 60
---
If you're going Demo Sac and you want to min/max, then put the three points in imp VW. The reasoning for this is because you can summon a VW, use the VW's sacrifice ability for a shield, then Master Summoner a succubus so you can Demo Sac that one. This is only needed for fights where there is a lot of aoe damage going out and the VW shield can help prevent spell pushback (for example Vael in BWL).  
---
If you're specc'ed that deep into demo fro DemoSac, you should never have a pet out longer than it takes for you to sac it. If you put three points into improved imp, then at best, you're able to put up a better fire shield once.
---
We were mostly killing the NPC since there were no alliance players anymore,
---
Point to one instance where someone had their account actions for using water walking to troll a raid group for a fall into water from a great height. Opportunities for which can be counted on one hand.
---
stop with the BS nonsense .. 99% from what data ? it seem majority of people who love classic WOW never bother to visit twitch and watch these non funny entities play games
---
Well that’s easy then because you’ll never use a pet in a raid as DS.
---
It depends on the server population, faction and the crafting profession, among other factors. For example, engineering can make a good deal of money, far surpassing what is needed for a mount at 40. You can do this by selling just grenades and guns, even early on with deadly blunderbusses for an Ashenvale quest Horde-side. Alchemists can make pretty good money too selling potions, but this is would probably be more profitable overall on a PVP server.
---
Druids can only res once every 10 minutes in Vanilla which some people will find annoying.
---
Paladins will always wear cloth if they want to heal effectively so you compete with all the other healers anyway for loot. Paladins would be my pick of the strongest healer in Vanilla. People are also more interested in having multiple paladins than multiple priests or druids as each extra paladin is an extra type of blessing for the raid and an extra aura.
---
Nah, I meant no harm bro. Wouldn't put it past blizz to do that, but your statement isn't true 100% of the time.
---
I was saying 99% of people can't play it so the streamers who can play it are the only window into the game.  I'm sorry you're so angry at streamers.
---
Although trying to tag mobs in the starting zones is going to be hard, but at least you’re not lagging.
---
No I hate you now *shakes fist*

not everything was perfect with TBC, they also had the flawed dungeon design policy based on statistics from scarlet monastery (dungeon combat mechanics were great though, such as mandatory cc and interesting fights). it's why all dungeons in tbc and afterwards are linear with wings, because scarlet was so popular; but the reason why scarlet was popular wasn't because it was a great dungeon, but its because it's one of the only access points for players in that level range.
---
the old dungeon design policy was much better, intended for adventures, with exploration in mind. thats why say, WC, BRD and BRS are so amazing, because you're supposed to explore different parts of them at different times. full of secrets, mysteries, unique elements, and lore.

Yup currently being downvoted for shit talking streamers. They don't like hearing about how they're cancer

I mean I get what he’s saying. Like if you killed the mobs without going oom then the gear effectively didn’t help you.

If they ever do BC servers they absolutely should run those commercials again though

Depends on your CPU really, graphically it's not very intense, so a regular laptop with a decent CPU and integrated graphics will do fine.

Good thing reddit lets you upvote and downvote content.

+2 for this, that frightening ambience / music turned up was unsettling
---
The big thing I dislike about Outland is how disconnected it is from everything else. I wish there were more ways to travel between Outland and Azeroth. Like, have the Naga construct a portal that leads between Zangermarsh and Azshara. Have the gnomes of Toshley's Station set up a teleporter that takes them to and from Desolace (because gnomish engineering is 100% accurate). Have the goblins of Area 52 stuff you into a rocket to Winterspring.
---
The Shattrath portals may be convenient but I feel they also take something away. I want a world interconnected enough that their convenience isn't necessary.
---
We’re talking about talents that only affect pets.
---
I don't think it will be exploitable. I saw a streamer use it once and it killed him, letting him either run back to res or take the sickness lol
---
5 points in shadow mastery gives you 10% shadow damage increase while still keeping your pet around. Warlocks really struggled in raid DPS so they where most of a Utility class. Healthstone, Imp Stam buf (interestingly enough since imp can go immune, one of warlocks jobs was to be in MT group and make sure the imp was placed firmly inside MT as.... you get my point). Curse of elements you buff every single mage damage in the raid. Banish was required. Other tasks. DPS was secondary.
---
Imp voidwalker made the most sense to me. I didn’t realize the shield angle though, I just assumed it was for farming. 
---
Thank you for the detailed answer. I appreciate it!

Any chance I can convince you to do an ally version? 😀
---
thanks, i dont think its him but thanks for the lead
---
As an alliance warlock WotF is the most annoying shit
---
They definitely already do this for other games lol.
---
I eventually want to have 3 characters: A paladin, a hunter, and a rogue.
---
Which one should I level up first? I was thinking paladin -&gt; hunter, then rogue whenever I have time. Not sure if that would be best, though. Also, on which class I listed do you think engineer would the most important (I don't want to be an engineer on all 3)? I plan to play holy paladin, if that helps. Will PvP, though only seriously after I PvE for gear first.
---
&gt; I also want this, but I just don't believe current blizzard can do it.
---
If they could get people like [Mark Kern](https://www.twitch.tv/grummz_em8er/videos) back there wouldn't be anything to worry about.
---
No, but you should do it anyway, because classic
---
I can’t tell if this is serious or not? Someone please help me out.
---
I was in a guild SheSaidSheWasDotFree
---
Yams
---
That's pretty neat.
---
I'm not the one making the claim that it hasn't been done. You made the claim which you can not back up and are trying to turn it around on me. That's now how it works.
---
I don’t ever skip training. Playing the game how you enjoy is never the wrong move.
---
I'm thinking of coming back to WoW because of classic. I miss the "taking our time, enjoying the experience, and make some friends" rather than the current "meet strangers, rush to the end, and leave as strangers".
---
Healers and yanks have significantly easier time finding groups.
---
I’m debating dps/healer/tank still.
---
However if I went healer, I’d start building my healing or tanking off set from quest items and random drops right around level 54-60.  The second I ding 60, it’d be respec and LFG BRD.
---
It’s a massive level 52-60 dungeon.  Even if you don’t clear it, the drops are plentiful and some even good enough for raiding.
---
The most fun experience I had was grinding 5 mans.  I think vanilla had the most solid 5 man experience to date.  They formulated and scripted it too much in BC and onward.  Standard layout with 1-2-3-4 bosses with trash in between.
---
Vanilla dungeons were epic mazes with different routes leading to different bosses.  Even if you didn’t kill the last boss, everything you did kill was super fun and engaging.
---
Yeah, Chromie has been around forever. Blizzard has always been goofy and there's always been goofy stuff in WoW.
---
maybe if your goal is to figure out how to speed run, instead of actually testing the game systems for bugs -- you know, what the beta is all about? you know, the thing discussed in the actual blue post?
---
&gt;Later today, we will take the WoW Classic closed beta down for maintenance and we will increase the level cap from 30 to 40. This will **allow testers to level up in zones such as Stranglethorn Vale, Desolace, and Arathi Highlands (among others)**.
---
Also sold in Dalaran at the toy shop.
---
I’ll stream for you. I have a group of friends that I’m playing with and I have zero stream following. It’ll be lots of fun.
---
Some people joked that a good phone can actually run Classic wow.
---
Thats the goal but its inevitable that some servers are going to be overpopulated, potentially to something crazy like 10k. Any streamer server is going to be like this. Particularly if the two biggest streamers roll on the same server. 
---
I think all they can really do at that point is offer free realm transfers off the server.
---
Absolutley bro never said there was a right or wrong way 100% agree with you. But in order to get your mount at 40 without having to do an insane amount of grinding many players skip the non essential spells. Thats why you find it hard my friend !
---
You post a stupid meme and then when I explain the reasoning behind applauded an engineer and believing that creative will drop the ball you call it the moving of a goal post?  As if your initial words were some intellectually eloquent statement. 
---
Get the fuck out.
---
remember when u were crying about getting rekt in open world pvp? pepperidge farm remembers.
---
Yeah. I'm not sure how I feel about them adding *any* new continents. I'd rather have a smaller world that's packed with possibility than a massive world that's one and done.
---
Undead rogues think they are special snowflakes pick orc
---
&gt; Yeah, that's fine, though. I hope people understand, especially those who come from modern WoW, that vanilla isn't about rushing to 60 and raiding ASAP.
---
Don't tell people how to play the game. You can fish or craft or take in the scenery if thats how you have fun. I have the most fun raiding, so for me speedrunning there is the way to go.
---
Tape is common and widely used today.
---
And these numbers are higher than the given mob pop of the full map at any given time
---
Damn that was good. Grenades are key, couple of those guys got SO close to dying. Was very surprised to see them all make it. Thanks for the link, like I said I don't watch streams but I love highlights like this.
---
The spec requirements for Classic are MUCH closer to Retail than to what it was for Vanilla 15 years ago. The only two exceptions to this are video RAM and hard disk space.
---
Yeah the engineering is so overpowered at that level, no problem yeah I watch occasionally but clips are always good
---
There used to be a *lot* of goldseller spam in vanilla and I filled up my list ignoring them.
---
If they start when classic comes out they probably won't have any problems finding groups. There will be so many people playing and groups will be abundant
---
Me too. Sadly everyone is too scared to try.
---
Good point. Forgot about that.
---
No Wheel of Time Reference. 
---
Shit tier game
---
Doesn't change the fact that the meat of the game is not there. Raiding was not emphasized in vanilla like it is in modern WoW. The default for the majority of the player base—or at least the new player, or a player who comes from post-cata WoW—shouldn't be to rush to 60 because in doing so, they'll essentially skip the game.
---
I’m glad I saw this. Night elf it is.
---
yes scrubbles? how can i help u? *dabs the tears from ur eyes* where did the mean horde hurt you?
---
Because spectating the level cap meta in beta is very fun, it has nothing to do with using that information for our own characters in Classic.
---
A bigger concern for me is more viable specs, staying on Azeroth for continuity and no flying (because that’s a dealbreaker for a lot of people).
---
70% of this is your retarded opinions and not actual information. It's impossible to get through without feeling like fighting through your grandpas racist anecdotes.
---
wow yeah I've read/watched about many of them but wasn't aware of that one. Really cool stuff.
---
They were discussing players of the same faction disrupting the event. There’s literally no reason to do it other than to grief
---
i think what u failed to understand about what i was saying to u is that u r thinking something fundamentally untrue - that there is a big difference between alliance players and horde players as to how they play the game.
---
FYI the teleport is straight from Orgrimmar
---
Again, don't tell people how to play a video game.
---
would u like a juice box, sweet child?
---
Sure you can show up... but there’s a difference b/t showing up and being a dick for no reason other than to grief *your own faction*
---
&gt; I actually prefer tanking and healing.
---
Consider going Druid.  A 0/30/21 build lets you tank or heal all dungeons in the game (what I did back in vanilla with my druid).  Raid viability as a tank is something that is... in question but you can certainly heal MC with that build.  The only hybrid that can pull that combo off (just kiss your bag space goodbye with all the gear you'll need to carry, lol).
---
Thank you for that.
---
I think it is entirely possible that there will be design teams that begin creating content for a 1.13, but that would have to either be after, or simultaneously to, an expansion server.  Otherwise we will likely have an outcry from a portion of this community, or other communities that are waiting to see the fallout of Classic, where they would want to see their preferred version of the game resurrected like Classic is getting now. 
---
The one drawback to Classic is that it will open the doors for other expansion based servers to be considered/petitioned for.   IMO, it is completely hypocritical for this community, or Blizzard, to want to deny those who loved BC/WotLK/Cata/MoP the chance to play the version of the game they loved the most. 
---
Most arguments that would normally detract from that (Fractured community, cost-to-benefit, ect) would be moot since many were the same arguments against Classic.  However, we are on the cusp of getting Classic, so those arguments obviously failed.
---
The issue is that quiet a few classes felt completely different from Vanilla to BC, BC to Wrath, and so on.  So if 1.13 is just an extension of Classic, in design philosophy and class expression, then all of those who loved BC for one reason or another will be denied the chance to (re)experience the content they loved the most.
---
You don't have to be offended by facts just because your preferred way of playing the game differs from what the game was originally designed for, as evident from the content itself. 
---
What I said is true. Deal with it.
---
Injection molding is for plastics
---
Your pet will be sacrificed the entire time.
---
I like how this subreddit has managed to give leeway to the devs to change things, even before any sort of patch was set in stone.  
---
Well this and the classicwowpodcast.  
---
It's almost like they're working with the dev's, for their own benefit...
---
Classic Wow Gm's:  "fuck this guy imparticular(though classically, we couldn't give a shit about them), they're effecting our ability to drive up ad revenue and subscriptions.... After all, isn't that what classic wow is all about?
---
&gt;I realize a lot of classes/specs in vanilla will seem pretty watered down compared to retail (less buttons).
---
WAT
---
Thousands of people rushed the starting areas with full knowledge of quests/pulling with maximum efficiency to hog as many monsters for themselves? I don't remember that in vanilla at all.
---
That's the sad state of gaming these days my friend.
---
I saw this art piece on reddit a few months ago of all the famous vanilla undead PVPers.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ojTEZqr.jpg
---
Probably gonna make it my phones homescreen now lol
---
Idk tanking in classic is just as complex if not more so than almost any DPS.
---
Grenades are useful and not locked to engineering so they’re a viable income source.
---
Which druid race, make or female, looks best in vanilla style armour?   I know I can't expect to wear tier gear always, but fashion and how my character looks has always mattered to me.  Obviously your opinion, but just curious what you think.
---
For sure, no problem.  
---
However, if you *really* want to guarantee a raid spot, go for a build that gives you both 2/2 improved healthstone and 3/3 improved imp. Tanks will be fighting you get you into their raids. Yeah, you have to sacrifice some personal dps, but it'll be worth it when you have priority when raid invites go out.
---
Classic Wow + add ons, but it's classics wow's fault they didn't have all this in their earlier build.  "Retail is so Superior, how could you give up these qol, improvements?"

In 2009, Mountain Dew restarted the Game Fuel promotion for 10 weeks, this time releasing two different flavors and promoting the Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game, World of Warcraft. 
---
One of these two flavors was the same formula as the 2007 Game Fuel, renamed "Horde Red" and with World of Warcraft packaging and an updated "Mtn Dew" logo. The other flavor for this promotion was a newly created Wild Fruit-flavored Mountain Dew. It was named "Alliance Blue" and was bright-blue colored.

It isn't hard to google, not sure why people agree with me the first time I said it but downvoted the 2nd time.
---
a lot of classes in vanilla are pretty much one button no? I guess I’m referring more to past expansions more than bfa
---
iirc he ended up getting hired by blizzard
---
It can be done, group play or dungeons doesn’t matter.
---
You need to be resourceful.
---
1. Don’t level a crafting profession unless you have a specific game plan to capitalizes on the market at the time.  Blacksmithing, Alchemy, leatherworking, tailoring and enchant-enchanting is a gold sink to start.  Don’t bother unless you have a specific plan, I.e. hitting a certain threshold to craft mageweave bags of the materials cost is less then the final product.
---
2.  Stockpile materials and sell them as you go.  Gathering professions and disenchanting help here.  Even first aid, no leveling and selling the cloth can get you 10-30 gold on the journey to 40.
---
3.  Don’t buy fancy shit you don’t need.  Don’t buy items for quests like animal organs or STV pages.  This is poorly spend gold per XP.
---
4.  Loot loot loot, vendor junk, repeat.
---
5.  Addon for item value.  Seems minor but after 200 quests, over 75% of them will not reward an upgrade.  Always select the 2h weapon or plate items, they vendor for more money.  If it’s an option between 3 unusable items, take the most expensive one obviously.  Some people just don’t pick up on this.
---
6.  Rogues can sell lock picking, mages can sell ports and I’ve seen warlock be paid to summon the lazy.  
---
7.  Dabbling in the AH.  Really open ended here.  Depending on how hard you hit the AH.  I got so elaborate in Wrath and Cata, I had 1 of every profession, multiple Alchemists and Scribes for the 24 hour cool down.  I was dominating gem, potion/flask, dark moon card, every major market being played.
---
Can also be as simple as listing your mageweave and noticing 2 stacks listed for 50% under market price.  Buy the 2 cheap stacks and list them all for the next highest price.
---
If the group really has trouble and is dedicated, just AOE farm the highest level dungeon you can clear in under 5-10 minutes.  Disenchant everything and vendor all junk.
---
Man, Blizzard is getting some super in-depth beta testing for Scarlet Monastery. In a couple months, they're going to know *all* the bugs in Scarlet Monastery.
---
When I do pvp I 100% do the same thing. Whichever side seems to have a winning streak that day is the side I’ll play on. Otherwise with classic I mainly play alliance since blood elves aren’t a playable race.
---
My vote would be for twitch.tv/kala .. shadow priest
---
You’re right - BFD was definitely one of the worst. Particularly if the new group member didn’t have Zoam(?) Strand FP.
---
What? I can rush to 60 an raid if I want, its what seperates the scrubs from the casuals
---
These complicated UI's are definitely more of a PVE thing. I can't imagine PVPing with that shit.
---
I wouldn't count getting to unreachable areas an exploit unless you use it against other players or gain somethign from it.  
---
I've been to Hyjal, CoT, Old IF etc in original Vanilla and I never got banned for it.
---
There are however cases where you jump out of WSG with the flag or you get into the tunnel in the IF battle master room and keep the battlemasters in combat that could be disruptive.  
---
I did both though in the live game and again never even got a warning for it.
---
Yeaaaah deep down I guess I knew lol I just wanted other people to weigh in to reaffirm my choice. Cause leveling a warrior is fine and dandy but I just don’t resonate with the class like I do Paladin.
---
Dude, just play the race you want if that’s going to bring you fulfillment. I don’t think the loss of DPS or whatever will be something game breaking. This is your game, not a job, you should be worrying primarily about having fun.
---
Another Horde crying like a baby bullshit post.  Yet they scream "For the Horde"...
---
Every tank and healer will be actually a DPS spec so it is more likely that pure DPS will be looking for groups. 
---
A druid tank or healer would prefer not to have hunters in the group since they can pick and choose and would prefer exclusivity (hunters use leather till like 40?)
---
Shaman as a healer would like to have agi gear for leveling so they would prefer no competition.
---
As you can see you may actually struggle getting into a group.

Haven’t had Mountain Dew in forever for a good reason but I would totally do this for launch. Maybe it would make the inevitable server issues more bearable haha
---
What specs are 1 button?
---
I would like Dr. Pepper Fusion to come back. Also, Josta.
---
You could probably do some kind of Holy/Ret build with Seal of Command, then both attack and spell modifiers will both contribute to your damage output.
---
If you think you are the only one that's going to be farming materials... good luck.
---
God I can imagine, all that sugar with the Jim lmao
---
They do. Since it's written in point of view characters, no one has seen him. He clearly exists but no one has interacted with him yet.
---
ur so cute. :p
---
Pffffft
---
This guy has an extreme hatred for people in the beta haha
---
just explaining how you were wrong
---
This is true. Rotations in classic are pretty simple. Most of the hard part is prepping your bis and consumes. Warrior and rogue are probably the biggest brain classes
---
holy pally, frost bolt over and over w mage. idk was just a question because I have read/heard from a lot of sources that people might find vanilla gameplay slower and with less variation than retail. wasn’t trying to shit on classic
---
100% same, just to relive the teenage years
---
I loved watching these videos. Made me want to play a mage. It is at 8:00 https://youtu.be/sv-mj2M9PjM
---
If only Reddit had some sort of voting system
---
I agree for the most part with what you are saying but I feel Blizz has a huge chance to make things ‘as they should be’ meaning finding out what the original team had planned for/wanted to include in Vanilla that was either postponed or moved to bc or completely abandoned.  
---
Then the ‘changes’ would be entirely in line with the original philosophy of Vanilla - and some people may not get screwed over due to their class rebalancing happening after 1.12 like shaman
---
Same here! Essentially the only thing I remember from MC as a hunter was having to tranq Magmadar because it made my younger self feel pretty damn special/useful. Everything else is a blur lol
---
Those were for all the stv gank tears
---
No, it's what separates players who don't get the game and think it's BFA 2.0 from players who do. Sure, you can, but it's your loss.
---
I don't know if female characters are "cool" to play just because you like looking at their ass.
---
There are some classes that have very basic rotations in a raid situation. But no, there are not a lot of classes that are "one button". 
---
But complex rotation does not necessarily mean hard or higher skill cap.
---
I booted up my old Paladin after a decade of not playing and mistakenly went into a dungeon. I was kicked promptly after the first wipe. I realized WoW was much different than it used to be and cancelled my sub.
---
Would yall like to see the same post over and over again?
---
I played since 2004. Always been Horde. I played on ZK, Ely, Ndale, always been horde and my point of view on it is very different.
---
To me horde is always the players who will believe Mak'gora is sacred. Dont you dare help your fellow hordie friend cause you take the honor away from his victory. I even let horde die if they attempt a gank and cant finish it on their own. I stand and watch in case another alliance try to intervene.
---
From my experience alliance always travel and quest in groups while horde go solo. Another experience I have is I never attack alliance questing cause I wanna quest peacefully. 
---
They usually respect that until their friends joins them and now they can finally outnumber me and secure the kill 3v1.
---
To me alliance are hypocrites who cannot take care of themselves and need to outnumber horde to engage pvp.
---
Well i'm rolling Alliance this time cause I wanna see what its like to raid and having paladins with you. I'm not sure how i will handle annoying gnomes yet. Wish me luck.
---
Struggling with the same decision! 
---
If you feel like you'd enjoy wpvp I feel like that could swing things in favor of hunter for you as the tools that make hunters so strong in wPvP (tracking, range, cheetah) aren't gear dependant.
---
Yeah I know.
---
rekt?
---
Which is pretty fair because sometimes your gear is taking the hits and how smooth the run is generally entirely depends on the tank.
---
Yes the specs are very simple compared to retail.
---
They have main abilities sure, vanilla is slower - a lot of people that never played has it in their mind that Vanilla was HARDCORE wow experience and it wasn't... it's not difficult at all (with few exceptions ofc) Vanilla wow is time consuming which typically (in vanilla) leads to a rewarding play experience.
---
As far as classes go, they were the original - if you are talking about "complex rotations" wow hasn't had that in it's entire 15 year history.
---
Embracing your female side is different from perving at your toon though. I was kind of shocked by the amount of people who just got exposed for using nudie hacks.
---
This. I keep seeing these ‘warrior #1 PVE DPS’ posts. All I can remember though is the combat dagger and combat sword rogues carrying my vanilla guild through a wide variety of boss fights.  The only limiter was threat, and rogue has plenty of tools to deal with that.
---
In classic you get to keep all your spells no matter how you are specced.  Imo this leads to more complexity with a frost mage knowing when to use a fire spell etc.
---
Just out of curiosity, are you planning to or expecting to run all dungeons with the same 4 people, or to have full control of how the group is set up every time? 
---
Or will always be better to have 4 competent people than the 4 classes that suit you the best. 
---
I generally love having hybrids in the group, it cannot really be a life saver to have a spare paying that can throw a heal or two, or whatever else may be the case. 
---
As a priest healer, is probably, like your suggest, go for something like rogue, warrior, shammy, Mage.
---
As someone that always played a restoration shaman, I just loved having a shadow priest in the group for vampiric embrace. I think this time as a druid healer I'll be looking for Shadow priests too, for the combo of that and a proper ress. Once there's a shadow priest, a warlock is really nice. 
---
Especially during leveling, I actually prefer druid tanks over warriors. For lvl 60 dungeons it's kinda the same, except it's easier to find good warrior tanks at 60. But druids are in the right specc while leveling, actually provide some damage while taking, have high threat, and are harder to mess up.
---
8.2 comes out within the next couple of weeks, if you already have a 120, sure.
---
"maybe if i waste his time i win? wait... im wasting my own time too. are we both just idiots? no! because im alliance, not like those dishonorable horde who never fight 1v1!" -phenoobtyx
---
Yea classic is more about managing your mana, position and the rest. It's much less staring at your action bars all the time haha.
---
Lots of classes in classic have super basic rotations, you are dead on there.
---
I stopped playing when tbc came out, the only thing we ever wanted to do back then was get to 60 an raid or pvp besides farming I guess.
---
No one will miss anything coz it still takes forever to get to 60 an there's no lfg tool. I don't understand what you're whinging about?
---
That’s a good point. Didn’t think about the horde racial. I’ll be going cat eventually so that warstomp would be nice even if I don’t pvp. I’ll mostly be pve 🤔 you have given me something to think about. Thanks!
---
&gt; not locked to engineering
---
Uh, yes there are. The only explosives Engineers make that non-Engineers can use are:
---
* Flash Bomb (fears Beasts)
---
* Ez-Thro Dynamite (small amount of damage, can fail, no stun)
---
Which no one ever uses.
---
everyone has so much to say but no answers! there have definitely been “fun” classes. which classes are “fun” in vanilla?
---
Bro, no, warlocks get spell lock at 36.
---
You were getting downvoted, and I am making fun of you, because you basically did to the above guy what I am doing to you.
---
You can only cram in so many raid tiers without destroying wpvp balance though.
---
as the tears fall liek gentle rain upon the keyboard...
---
I don’t ever find buying my mount hard.
---
Dumb question, but BIS?
---
The guild I’m in will have a SM/Ruin lock with improved imp for that reason.
---
I’ll be picking up imp hearthstone for sure though.
---
Karma-whoring. At least I'm getting to practice my downvoting recently.
---
When in Rome, do as the Romans do. They’ll quickly assimilate to Classic WoW. The game is unforgiving at times and they will realize this after getting their asses kicked multiple times and people telling them to f’ off.
---
Oh sorry maybe i was replying to the wrong person my bad
---
"pve focus" that's your problem honestly. Every class is kind of boring in raids. Are you not confident in PvP?
---
I don't give a shit what Mountain Dew do

I just know I will be playing more pve. I play pvp as well but I also know my priest will
---

---
Ah we've come full circle
---
*save comment*
---
&gt; a lot of classes in vanilla are pretty much one button no?
---
If you just go by endgame raiding, sure. But there's so much more to vanilla than endgame raiding. You'll take weeks leveling, doing dungeons, if you're on a PvP server you'll be in constant World PvP. They're absolutely not one button rotations there.
---
literally all you had to say from the start!
---
to see a man so shattered... i almost feel pity.
---
The point I'm making is that the "the game begins at max level" is an entirely misguided mindset to have when playing vanilla WoW. That may seem intuitive to someone who comes from the current version of the game, but it doesn't apply to vanilla WoW at all.
---
Do you have a source for that? I can certainly believe it, but I didn't notice anything that seemed to imply the others had a leader when I read the books. I only read through once, so I could have easily missed it.
---
Which I did...
---
"Druid"
---
you say a lot are one button in end game raiding. but which ones aren’t??
---
Why didn't he use Frostbolt?! It's clearly not immune because he Nova's it.
---
I’ll be taking my time leveling so I’m really not opposed to waiting a day or so to start. I’ll probably avoid most the crowd and have a good time if I stick to questing areas that I know won’t be as popular. I’ll definitely be /who checking zones. If I’m feeling risky I’ll go to STV for the shit show just to get a taste of how hard warriors get stomped by some of the classes early on.
---
I don't know. Pretty much most people respec to shadowform at 40 even if they go mainly shadow.
---
And thus my original post containing, "Until 40 its slower."  Maybe if you read the post before thinking you knew everything you wouldn't make such simple mistakes.
---
See that that is a point, Am i am correct, where as, you argued to go full shadow (except wands im sure) which is slower without exception below 40.  
---
Are you saying leveling to 40 doesn't matter? Everyone knows of the level 30-40 slump for sure its best to be strong then.
---
Furthermore, "If you had simply been shadow spec you would have been able to solo at a decent rate and still heal well enough for lowbie instances." This is just entirely wrong. 
---
His issue was more likely that he didn't understand the 5 sec rule or wanding. Because people level holy pallies and shamans and they don't even scratch holy priest leveling speed. Its not that far from shadow if you are doing it right. 
---
Furthermore, as i stated even above 40, Holy is far faster than most people who NEVER tried it think. Its oddly shadow wand damage, SWP damage, the 15% less phys damage taken, and they efficiency of Mind Flay (but only if you cast just one) that Shadow largely obtains over Holy.
---
But Holy gets stuff that also really helps. 25% (50% when spirit tap up) Spirit as Spell damage/healing, Faster HF/smites (which is more dps and mana efficiency), and 20-25% of hp recovered from melee and range crits. It really loses out on the lack of 3% hit vs equal level mobs (+1=4%, +2=5%) with its holy spells and also benefits from no mobs having any resistance to holy.
---
I wouldn't say in the 50s holy was = to Shadow in speed. But they really aren't that far apart. Much of the damage even these levels are still wands and SWP, and holy does lose out on wand damage at level 50, big time, due to the Woestave wand (if AV isn't out, if AV is out then no wand dps difference 50+.) Also more shadow/spell gear starts showing up which helps shadow some more.
---
I have done this more than a few times and the only time I was like heck yeah shadow is just the best was on a troll.
---
Frost mage rotation is quite literally frostbolt until OOM, evo, frostbolt until oom, wand - retail sucks but rotations are much more complex
---
Those keybinds lmao
---
Rogue, Fury Warrior or Hunter would fit that bill the best.
---
I’m a fan of how female night elves look and move. I like how some of the armor looks on them 😁 they look pretty sweet in the molten core gear to me.
---
Raid PVE DPS I would say furry warriors have the most engaging rotation. Rogues are good as well. Fire mages later on.
---
I'm 100% sure your computer will run classic wow.
---
Also a potato could run it.
---
/r/HailCorporate
---
Warrior, rogue
---
You said...
---
&gt; I’d actually really like togglable new updated textures.
---
The game ***literally*** has a feature that toggles updated water textures and updated bush and shrub textures ***WITH*** physics. Things that were ***added*** to Classic. 
---
&gt; I’m on beta. That’s not what I’m talking about at all.
---
There's no possible way for me to tell exactly what you're talking even though that fits what you're asking for. Then gets pissy because I couldn't guess exactly what you wanted or use "basic reasoning skills". 
---
As I said, toxic as fuck lol.
---
if youre not already subbed, its not worth the 15$
---
From what I've gathered over the years, not butch enough.
---
PvE rotation yes, but I was thinking about PvP opportunities to pull out some crazy moves
---
You can't have SM, Ruin, and improved imp. You don't have enough talent points for it (SM requires 30 point investment in Affliction and Ruin requires 21 points in destro).
---
The "made by" tag
---
Yup, I could be there for days and not care
---
Bro, lol, how can you get griefed by your own faction in a duel tournament.
---
Gotcha, well I wouldnt advise rolling a dps class just to raid.
---
You’re stupid. He legit just posted the BoE epic ring he’s talking about.
---
ty gonna do rogue or hunter
---
How can you grief your own faction? It should definitely be okay to kite mobs to random events.
---
I think you're dick riding streamers a little bit too hard buddy. Nobody should get banned because their 40k a month stream got disrupted.
---
Rogues are worse DPS than warrior
---
Combat swords is not really the main rogue PvP spec either, so you'd probably still want to respec between raids if you're trying to be all serious about PvP.
---
Oh man yes! Best feeling when you run around in your own gear and it is better than anybody else has. Makes it worth it to take back from leveling, and you also don't burn out from killing things in the process.
---
It is the only way I can level properly. :)
---
I suppose if nothing for the Juxtaposition - if you have $30+ to spare then go for it. Who knows - you might win the Beta lottery.
---
Lol, bro they will be fine. You're over thinking it. They just want to play the game how they want. I promise there will be plenty of people leveling that group make up wont be a problem.
---
Hunter, druid, warrior, rogue, shaman
---
yes, on a pve server . and bgs arent in for a few months
---
&gt; they don't have Zepp
---
Okay, what? Boats are far superior. How often do you miss the zepp because you have to climb that stupid tower, or fall off beacuse of a lag spike? Our FPs do suck thou.
---
Pservers bro
---
Yea but they're still not going to miss any content either way? Doing all that stuff in between is still a slog. If there's more people on the server then there will be more people to play the game with? If you meet someone you like playing the game with then add them to your friends list, it's not a difficult concept.
---
Every class is fun imo. Pick the one class that you identify with on a RPG level. Imo classes feel more distinct in Vanilla, they each fill a niche role.
---
I feel like Shaman fits me best. I always liked the concept of totems, even though it's a little clunky in Vanilla. When you play Shaman you also *really* have to play the entire class in order to be effective, I love that the class forces me to utilize every tool at my disposal and to be creative with em'.
---
Read the op then my response again, carefully
---
I’m talking very long term
---
You don't have to like them but that doesn't make the vanilla graphics any less dated. Only a nerd can throw this much of a temper tantrum and still be completely off base. Also people are talking about a toggle, you could still play with the old graphics. If you want to be taken seriously grow up.
---

---
I’m pulling for cdew getting some dumb wind fury procs.
---
Raiding wasn't fun because of your rotation. It was fun because of the idea of 40 people trying to do something together. Keep in mind when Vanilla first came out MMO was not a thing, you couldn't just look up starts or gear or rotations. All of that information was past down from one guild forum to another. 
---
In the current world of information on min/maxing raid will be extremely easy. I honestly think World PVP will be the new Classic Meta.
---
sir scrubbles types with weary hands... defeated, empty, vacuous eyes gazing at the screen. thwarted within azeroth. thwarted outside of it. he prepares to impale himself on his sword. with a tired sigh, he whimpers: "for the alliance..."
---
yeah, OP is asking for pve tho
---
OMG I LOVE YOU! this was my first mage video that I watched and was amazed! youre the best
---
I’d do hunter, paladin then maybe rogue ? Hunter has an easy soloing/kiting capability. You can funnel money to your paladin eventually. I’d say make the hunter an engineer. You can make your own ammo, trinkets, weapons. Plus it’s really good for pvp. 
---
I’ve heard that paladin leveling is kinda slow ? But not sure. Are you planning on raiding at all? Or just pvp
---
the chad rekt poster vs the virgin hmm? poster
---
Couldn't care less what you believe. Just putting you straight :)
---
Try dauntless or something similar until then.
---
its more like 50
---
Play something else in the meantime
---
If you ask me, then no. I genuinely think retail is bad in most aspects.
---
I wasn't in either guild here, but I did play on illidan around then, and if I remember correctly they're attacking an alliance guild named &lt;DIE&gt;, who were sort of a server villian/joke. I still remember their constant raids on undercity and some of the old memes about their GM.
---
Oh god, and I used to sit around and look at Zxtremes' crazy op gear in org while I was leveling the first time. Too many memories from one screenshot @___@
---
Yep, I missed that somehow, thanks for that
---
One light and icc no buff are both probably in contention with the top of the current tiers imo. People forget that ICC heroic 25 was only trivialized by the 30% buff.
---
Say you’re having a duel tournament and two same faction players show up and follow around the duelers or stand//continually jumping on top of them. It serves no purpose other than to troll. It’s distracting and could cause select targeting issues
---
that makes sense. rogue and priest it is

metzen wasn't invested in wow until mid-wrath. he had other projects at the time and let the game's designers reign free, basically.

Is human the best pick for shadow? Based on what I've read dwarf priest is the best race/class combo in the game due to fear ward. However, I don't think that is castable from shadow form so human may indeed be better for shadow.
---
I'm not sure about pvp either. Horde seems to have better pvp racials, namely will of the forsaken and the 25% stun chance resist for orcs. However, I've also read that alliance has battleground layout advantages as well as paladin just being more useful to the team than shaman. I agree people are likely basing it on personal experience, likely from private servers.
---
You do realize PvP outside of the wpvp was non-existent.  The Vanilla devs have said they weren't sure about pvp and felt it very difficult to  balance.  WoW almost didn't happen. Be thankful you got what you got instead of being an entitled whining about "how it should have been".
---
Is there a specific build that has it? Seems like a waste to go DS and have your imp out.
---
I got tingles
---
Who are you to dictate how the "game is meant to be experienced" anyway? Some people want to raid with their friends and get the best gear, some people want to pvp an get the highest ranks.
---
If someone wants to read all the quest text and RP with everyone then good for them? 
---
But you're acting like this game is everquest, asherons call or dark age of Camelot.
---
Even back in the day almost everyone had an ALT rogue for the sheer fun it was. So yeah I would strongly recommend one.
---
Cool man. Get any good drops? :)
---
:( poop, I was enjoying having ESP
---
So you think going 2 craft proffesions should be fine? Been considering if I should go engineering/tailoring on my warlock.
---
As others pointed out, it's about identity. If the cost is low everyone will have the same optimal specs, for whatever they are going to do. 
---
With the 50g cost, people will find interesting specs (not saying new, just interesting) that allow them to perform their main job (e.g. healing) almost optimally, but also have some fun in other ways. 
---
It allows someone to be the guy that heals great in raids, but then stormstrikes some Mage to death when putting on his big 2-hander. Or someone to be the druid that tanks trash and heals on bosses, or the shadow weaving hybrid priest that's an absolute beast in PvP. 
---
It's not about 50g being some perfect number, it's about what that number caused as a, possibly unintended, consequence.
---
No, no, no, no Tauren are in a category of their own, every class played differently as a Tauren.
---
Making ALOT of assumptions for that corrupted ashbringer .... but sure is totally possible
---
Just need a solid strategy for making gold to support two crafting professions, that’s the key!
---
Oh trust me I’m wellllll aware of how little a chance I have of actually getting it. But as a wise man once said... “So you’re telling me there’s a chance?”

I Quit in pandaria and resubbed for a beta invite i got in to the stress test but not the full beta so i started playing my retail account because i didn't want to waste the money. Well my first introduction back into the game was pretty sad i saw that WOD was a mmo phone game and just gave up hope right there lol. leveled from 90 to 100 so i gave it a good go
---
Again, don't tell people how to play a video game. You do you, they do them. Ezpz
---
Some people want different things out of a game. You want want one thing, they want another. There is no objective correct way to play WoW, and that is a beautiful thing man. Have a good day friend &lt;3

SM ruin for utility , ds/ruin for aq+
---
I haven't played much wow past Cata so I'm not sure this still exists, but basically the pvp brackets during leveling are broken into segments so you are only pvping (talking about BGs, not world pvp) with people around your same level. I think it was 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, etc. A twink is a character that you would stop leveling at the highest level of the bracket and get all the best possible gear, enchants, etc. With the point being you would be very powerful in BGs compared to a normal character who was just doing some BGs during leveling.
---
Orc is slightly better for dps because of their active racial ability. They also have stun resist.
---
Undead has WotF.
---
Orc for optimal PvE performance. 
---
Undead for PvP, but Orc would still be quite good.

I laughed really hard at the guide saying "Regeneration is also fairly robust, essentially giving you a higher health pool during a Raid Boss fight"

Regeneration heals SO little that its functionally neglible, hence the whole "regeneratin 5hps" meme

They're gods precisely *because* they show restraint. Because they have kept thing their finger on the pulse of the community, and have been incredibly attentive to preserving the original game while not giving into the temptation to take modern shortcuts or add in extra bullshit nobody

No, taunt on pet doesn't make it to attack you in beta.

The problem is that Apple has the image of producing impractically expensive electronics. They're not going to attract more consumers until they combat this, and these new releases are not helping them.
---
It worked when they were innovative, but that's not the case anymore.
---
Yeah that won’t happen on live. People won’t waste time on it.
---
My judgment is based on the game's content and overarching design philosophy. Of course, you're free to do whatever niche thing in the game you want, but it's an easily inferred conclusion that it was foremost meant as a complete, lengthy journey, putting significant emphasis on the leveling experience, not mainly as an endgame grinder like the current game. 
---
Do whatever you want, but what I said is undeniable. Thus, it's completely warranted to say that the notion of "the game begins at 60" is flat out wrong.
---
&gt; Any idiot could design post-Naxx raids.
---
Could they though? Like, let's be real, Blizzard is not going to be happy designing content knowing about the mess of balance that 1.12 was in. If Blizzard is going to design post-Naxx content, they probably want to fix the classes as well - not even talking about going the full shebang and completely reworking classes but bringing up other specs to viability at the very least. Well, this new meta, whatever it looks like, is no longer going to be "classic". A WoW where druids can tank progression content or enhancement shamans are legitimate DPS specs is not going to be classic WoW. Arguably, at that point purists are going to want their own server.
---
It's super, super risky trying to hit it right. BC fans are not happy, classic fans are not happy, you're aiming at a very small target, if you miss it fails horribly, if you hit it the pay-off is pretty small. It's just not worth it. Asmongold made the perfect analogy. You can close your eyes while driving on the high way and that's risky... but why would you do that? Don't do it bro. Just release BC. That's the correct play.
---
You’re downplaying their actions by saying they’re “standing around”. Following around the duelers to be standing directly on top of them or jumping around in each and every duel is not just standing around. What’s the purpose of it than to troll? 
---
Does it serve a meaningful purpose? Is the action disrupting other peoples’ games while bringing the individual no benefit? The answers to these questions are clear.
---
Plus, you’re also putting words in my mouth by saying I want to ban them. Never once did I type that out. Altho it’s mad douchey, I don’t think that type of behavior is ban worthy.
---
you dont say... thats what Im saying. The scarlet mail gear got changed to plate in retail so my old hunter got stuck with plate gear.
---
Even then there are better avenues for getting gear and heroic difficulty for dungeons is basically irrelevant, especially if you're forming a group.
---
you must construct additional "hmm?"s

Bro, my dude, you wana ban people for walking ontop of other people dueling? You're unhinged.

Why does it have to

&gt;Plus, you’re also putting words in my mouth by saying I want to ban them. Never once did I type that out. Altho it’s mad douchey, I don’t think that type of behavior is ban worthy.
---
Yes you absolutely do. The only thing blizzard does do is ban people.
---
There is no objectively wrong way to play it, but there is a wrong way to approach it based on preconceived notions learned from the modern iteration of the game.
---
Hey, thanks for that.  I can see how the brez revive only could be frustrating. But the CD is shorter than I thought it would be.  
---
I didn't realize we aren't set to a certain armor type.  Cloth mail and plate.   Very new to wow classic.  So if that's the case in most scenario (unless class.specfic piece) all healers would compete anyways?   Ive read a lot of comments saying "resto druid, at least you'll hear quick since underplayed".  How would that be the case then?
---
why?
---
Wouldn't you have to buy the latest xpac?
---
lol did anyone even die? Those mistakes  lead to epic battles and great stories and sometimes death.
---
ah i see.
---
I need to comment on this post to save it
---
oh in pve. yeah okay.
---
in any other circumstance, vanilla has like 3 times as many buttons per class.
---
If you level up when the server releases, then you won't have any problems. Thousands of people will get playing do groups will be easy to find. Getting a guild will help too
---
Sounds like the life of a healer 🤷. Not big d dps and not big ole tank, don't notice the heals lol.
---
Lol - I just said I didn’t want to ban people for that type of behavior. Then you say I’m unhinged for wanting to ban people? 
---
Your comprehension skills are unparalleled.
---
Most engaging for raid dps is hunter and 2nd probably fury war
---
Yeah, I'd consider 'trying it out' if it didn't involve dropping $60 on an xpac I won't care about in a couple weeks.
---
If you want grunt money get 2 gathering professions.
---
Realistically: they’ve gotten way more free advertising about their WWDC announcements than the revenues from a monitor stand could even come close to matching. Also they get to control what everyone is outraged about, selectively helping them slip other things under the radar.
---
Even long term they are all fairly boring. Maybe rogue would be mechanically what you're looking for. Otherwise roll a healer. At least you will be reacting to stuff more often then.
---
What do you want to happen to the person who trolls duels.

Just auto downvote any stream crap you come across, thats what I do. If I wanted to watch streams I would be on twitch, not reddit

I think teleporting away was a perfect solution.

How long has your wife taught primary school for?
---
Yes. I only play on pve servers. Hanging makes the game not fun for me as my playable time is very limited so I avoid pvp servers for that reason.
---
Ya id be goofing around on it too, in order to get a chance at the beta. Having to buy that xpac is a no go for me. I didn't bother subbing at all.

They didnt teleport him away though. He just got phased randomly.
---
Technically the post I linked to is an Ally version. Or did you mean with the Ally leaders?
---
There is a pre quest AFAIK. Anyway, you should do all BB quests anyway so you will get there.
---
You can even create a group for the pirate quest chain and the gorilla cave quest (with the blue boots reward), since those are sweetspots for ganking rogues, and go with that group to gnomeregan
---
That's just like your opinion guy, likewise other people enjoy the game once they reach 60. So going by the way you THINK the game should be played, everyone should just level to 60 and roll a new toon then? And make sure they take as long as possible to level as well so they don't miss anything, right? Coz that's what you're saying mr overlord.
---
IF the warrior can't produce enough threat, Rogues are the better melee dps.
---
If they can, and you have shamans, Warriors dps is better.
---
It just depends what limiting factors there are in your guild.
---
Well, I always liked the sets because they're very fitting.  I mean, Druids are all about communion with nature and animals, as opposed to Hunters, which are instead a little more about dominance over nature and animals, though I feel the two classes do share concepts.
---
To me, Druids aren't really about being badass, definitely not like a Rogue or whatever, but it's perfectly fair to have that view of them.  Everyone sees things a little differently, and it even depends on what "badass" means to each person.
---
Anyway, being brand new to WoW back then like everyone else, just knowing each set was "epic" skewed my perspective on them, but even now I still like all the Tiers considering what the artists could do back then.  I agree that Tier 3 is the coolest one, though Tier 2 is very close.
---
I've heard that hunter has a very high skill celing. They may not do top tier dps, but their utility to do certain niche things that are needed by groups IF you know how to do it reliably, can be valuable. If done optimally you can become op at certain things like getting to solo &amp; soloing the final boss in DM N  (5 man level 60 dungeon). Crowd controlling 2 mobs simultaneously, pet-tanking a 3rd and kiting a 4th. Kiting one mob for an entire fight. Outstanding grinding efficiency, compareable only to aoe frost mages. 
---
Tldr: hunters are easy to play but have an extremely high skill celing and you can really make a name for yourself if you are adept at the game.

I've articulated and reiterated my point multiple times, and yet you're still missing it, so I'll give up.

was this the strategy your parents used on you as a kid?
---
are you contemplating your own failures?
---
The Chromie trailer was clearly whipped together in a short amount of time (It's just every other trailer in reverse). 
---
I would love a full GC take on the time travel theme. Like show the cataclysm in reverse and all our favorite places being restored. Plus have we ever seen something like a full Blizzard-quality CG model for Ragnaros? That would be so awesome. 
---
The original trailer is cool but it's not like it's going anywhere.
---
You attacking everyone on sight is very different from thousands of people blindlessly following instructions to hunt and camp you.
---
hey scrub. are you still mad?
---
I would agree. Shifting forms is like stance dancing on a warrior but by far more punishing. You basically drop all your armour and lose a ton of health shifting out of "defensive stance" etc
---
It has one of the harder rotations in PvE for dps. It requires tons of consumable etc but you get fairly lackluster results :/
---
There's a 0/30/21 Master Demonologist Ruin build that picks up both. It also has the benefit of reducing your threat generation by 20% if you have your imp out. And let me tell you from experience...with no way to dump aggro, you're going to appreciate having the reduced aggro generation.  
---
Later on once you move out of MC, there are more options that allow you to spec more into destro and basically become a "fire 'lock".

They basically nixed it when BGs started giving you experience. I somehow ended up in a twink guild during vanilla despite being ass and also not a twink lmao good times
---
WoW is F2P up until LVL 20, so you could use that as a test for your PC if you really wanted to. But in the space between now and classic release, there's not a whole lot worth doing in retail imo
---
Such anger is really distasteful. One of the great things about this sub is how welcoming everyone is regardless of their background. A mix of people who've mapped out 0-60, people who don't know what character they're going to play, and yes even people who watch streams. 
---
Instead of trying to divide this sub i would honestly think about the positives of the currently state. There's many examples people have posted as to how to avoid content that you in particular would want to filter and a baked in system to downvote the content. Overall though, the streamer content will yield a net positive to the long term growth of this sub but more importantly the game.
---
hm... yes, he is destroyed. he has hmm'd? his last hmm.

&gt;I was under the impression on of them were teleported to Winterspring
---
Teleporting people across the world because they stood on top of a duel is not appropriate. 
---
If thats the standard for griefing. Then stealing mob tags, killing you open world, etc is even worse. 
---
&gt;But yeah either way though I still think teleporting them is a good idea.
---
Does everyone who stands on a duel get this punishment. Or is this only a punishment because a streamer cried.
---
Doubt it. Pretty sure everything is implemented in the beta for testing purposes. The fishing tourney originally came out with the ZG patch.
---
Finally, some good fucking food.

Grenades don't "stun"

Man you're dense.

Half pop of this 10k server doesnt speak english anyway. You are comparing a unique server where people from all timezone play. I can assure you that even with 1 million account on one german/french server you won't have more than 1k online past 3AM (except at start of course).
---
This was the best Game Fuel they ever released.
---
It's coz your point isnt really a point it's just an opinion, you THINK everyone has to go in with the same pre conceived notion as you and play the game like you THINK the game should be played. An from what I've gathered you think having more people on the server will ruin your levelling experience coz you might have to wait for mobs to respawn or you might not recognise some names. And for some reason you only care about levelling and nothing else, and that you're so much better than everyone else cos you "play the game how it should be played". 
---
Pretty sure I got your "point". Maybe join a guild an try raiding or pvping you might make some friends and learn not to be such an elitest gatekeeper.
---
Yeah, when I heard that arrow thing I wanted to Butt into the episode so badly. They way i see it, running out during a raid is an opportunity to make friends with the other hunters. Make a friend, maybe they are an engineer and can make him more arrows in the future. That’s what vanilla is all about. Hah listening to all those rants were making me so salty XD
---
Ss ee oo D a p

False.

One person with the key = whole raid gets in.

"When im looking for a workstation I want an impressionist piece if art, not a utilitarian tool."

Why not roll a druid with hotw build??

What is there to struggle with lol it's shitty. But can't say it hasn't crossed my mind
---
you want some more salt? but you know that's not good for you mr. slug.
---
yes, you got rekt. it may take some time for you to realize it. continue meditating.
---
I might know you. My friend is hs during vanilla sat somewhere and typed out like 100 phrases and made a dictionary.

All I remember is kek Maza was like lol noob
---
do you need a tissue?
---
i love looking at your recent comments. it's like a monument to how successfully i destroyed your entire career
---
Stealing mob tags has a purposeful function. So does open world killing. That seems to be the part you’re missing. 
---
Following around duelers, standing in top of them, and jumping around in their duel zone duel after duel fulfills absolutely no purpose. 
---
And what kind of question is that? Punishment should be handed out regardless of whether the tourney is streamed, not streamed, large, small - it doesn’t matter. It’s the actions that occurred, not who they occurred with.

I chose Tauren because in the morning cinematic one nails a hunters bear pet with a 2H totem. Looking at this guy sucked because he's the only one who ever got one.

god damn who knew so many health freaks would be commenting on a Mountain Dew post in the wow subreddit

one time i was playing wow, and i killed an alliance. he got on his horde and was like "wahhh typical horde, too afraid to fight 1v1!" and then i met him on reddit and owned him there too. come to think about it, it was... it was you! *cue stan by eminem*
---
I played classic pretty extensively (hit warlord and raided MC, BWL, AQ on a warlock) and I would be pretty thrilled if they decided to introduce dual specs for switching.  It doesn't hurt anyone and just makes it so you can pvp and pve without having to spend 50 gold on a respec (which is an insane amount of money in classic).
---
Cool story, bro.
---
Pretty sure a truck backed up over it too. It was in bad shape.
---
Sometimes it's better to kick someone and 4-man it, if the person you kick is a complete tool.

hey buddy. havin a rough night? *pops open a beer* here's some alcohol. it was invented to help kids who get rekt in video games to make their life even worse.
---
Thanks it's a best seller
---
You said they will struggle because druids and shamans won't want them. He said there will be tons of groups in response because this is a discussion. No need to get offended and mock him repeatedly like a baby.
---
 OP also said "they would raid orgrimmar" so that negates your shaman comment.
---
*pats you gently on the head* you have been rekt. we all get rekt, but it is how we handle the rekt that makes us who we are.
---
I mean if you can find enjoyment somewhere in the game go for it. 
---
I personally uninstalled after a couple hours
---
come on I quit my job and moved back home for this shit get with it
---
When you mention it I also seem to remember this being a thing. Seems like summoning inside instances was added in [patch 2.4.0](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.4.0) You could summon people that already were inside the instance, but not someone that was outside the instance.
---
Not true? Blood Elves turned to fel magic (hence the green eyes) after the destruction of the sunwell vs High Elves who didn't (blue eyes). All Blood Elves used to be High Elves and now most of the Thalassian race is Blood Elf.
---
this particular comment is especially ironic, because my entire point was to try to teach you that we \*are\* the shitlords who we hate, 99% of the time. every time you complain about the horde, the horde is saying the same thing about you! lol
---
How often are you gonna have 10k concurrent players on to ruin your levelling experience?
---
That's an awful lot of text for someone not trying to make a point.
---
Let me break it down for you: You made a wow/apple satanism joke. I mentioned the sell price of their original computer (if you look it up) was $666 to add to your joke. You then went on a tirade about economics of scalability as though I'm attacking...someone or something you hold dear in your belief system?
---
Do you see why I'm a little confused on how we got here?
---
So, my guild from retail is going alliance and I’ve always Mained a rogue since I’ve started playing WoW so I really wanna play a rogue, currently 21 on a pserver after seeing the beta come out. There’s just one problem, like 5 people want to play rogues and that’s not even including the 20ish other gangsters we need to recruit for a 40 man roster that also are rogues. How many rogues is too many in a guild, and should I play hunter instead (I find hunter interesting anyways) because we have 0 people interested in playing hunter (plus I’d get dibs on Rhok’delar and the BWL crossbow.)
---
*shang tsung voice* your comment history is MiNE
---
So your biggest issue is the fact you're gonna struggle to make friends?
---
Monster Hunter?
---
OH MY GOD YES PLEASE PLEASE YES I NEED THIS
---
Definitely felt dead
---
Can you heal 5 mans at level 60 in shadow spec as a priest?
---
Want to play priest and willing to spec holy to heal in raids but have no interest making my first character a dedicated healer while gearing up pre-raid
---
The thing about retail is that it's meant for quick 20 min game sessions. No for 20 hour marathon grinds
---
If you are familiar with hamstring kiting warriors do for leveling and fighting hard monsters, I am essentially doing the same with my shaman using earthbind totem. Only stepping into the melee range of the enemy when my swing timer resets. 
---
Also keep in mind Windfury totem. With you and your brother both swinging hammer, you double the chance of chunking down if not one-shotting mobs.
---
They can, it's just not advised unless it's necessary. More often the priest is healing and shielding themselves, and not you. People tend to ignore the warrior and focus the priest in this situation.
---
Why is it bad having a higher population? It's easier to find groups? Who made you the expert that says 3k is the perfect number? Wouldn't more be better? It makes it easier?
---
Man. I miss having babelfish on Nerzhul
---
well you cant put anyone straight with anecdotal evidence so settle down there cowboy
---
I think people forget the 20 second immunity that follows after they click out.
---
Also I believe in vanilla wotf and the trinket are on different cooldowns
---
Do you guys think more people will be playing mages this time around? I rolled mage since vanilla. I just don't want too much competition for Magister gear when UBRS comes around. Its gonna be pretty disheartening to roll against 4-5 other mages in a 15man group lol.
---
I think it's time for you to go and stop littering the thread with increasingly low quality comments. It looks like I've upset you, and now you're taking it out on me personally.
---
So you are genuinely worried about not making friends and people taking nodes and mobs from you?
---
the story of hercules and the hydra! *sets you on fire*

You stole 2 minutes from me. Kicked.

I'm still trying to figure out what exactly is wrong with having more players? Have you heard of the more the merrier?

sir scrubbles.. back so soon? but you haven't even been able to kill one kobold... on second thought, maybe northshire abbey doesn't need your help.

The ToS is intentionally vague so that blizzard can use common sense and reasonable judgement. Disrupting a community event through non-gameplay is absolutely, positively, 100% griefing just to grief and blizzard used their common sense and reasonable judgement to kick the piece of shit from the zone. I can’t imagine people would defend the guy, but I also can’t imagine people being anti-vaxx or flat-earthers or climate change deniers so I guess there’s just some special people in the world.

I enjoyed oculus
---
Thank you all for replying! Cant wait to meet you all ingame! 
---
(I know its unlikely due to different Servers and such, but still :] )
---
Damn this has me wondering now. I wonder which enemy/ NPC has the most kills ever.
---
Think it'd be worth taking Mining? I was considering doing Skinning/Mining while leveling, for gold making end-game, and Mining to get extra mats along the way, then drop Skinning for Engineering for Engi/Mining for a bit as I farm certain mats, then drop Mining for something else later once I'm set on gold.
---
My only concern with Mining is it might be difficult to level it up at the start due to the rush of players.
---
Because your employees might be able to have a yearly bonus if you didn't spend profits irresponsibly. I prefer to spend my money on socially responsible businesses when I can.
---
The real fun in playing a warrior is that you only need one healer focusing on you to be nearly immortal in a battleground. Just make sure to peel anyone going after your healer and you can almost never die.
---
Yeah, let me know how that works out for you.
---
I think I missed something is wow getting a reset to vanilla? What's going on here?
---
He was coowners woth his dad
---
what? lol.
---
oh wow i was just joking but yes
---
The person's arguments was "they will be fine" and "plenty of people leveling". Which one of them is a Pro or a Con specifically to the dual hunter conversation? Will they be able to get into groups - Yes, will it be more challenging - Yes. 
---
Not offended at all, not sure how you got there. I am not a fan of the juvenile "Lol, bro" attitude to everything including IRL. Everything is "Chill bro" or "take it easy". There is a difference between giving a shit about something and getting actually upset about it. 
---
So no, I am not upset, but only disappointed. 
---
They USED to raid Orgrimmar back in a day, nothing to do with the main question of Pro and Con.
---
Wowhead has a Thottbot theme.

Never heard of china peak, russian peak and EU/NA peak? You have 10k players on this server because the players from different timezone are overlapping. On retail classic it would never be like this, you could have 5k peak between 6pm to 9pm but after/before that pop would be way lower.
---
Not everyone would agree with his assessment. I for one completely disagree. I had quite a bit of fun pvp'ing as a warrior all through Vanilla, and I never saw a piece of PVP gear from AQ or Naxx. All you need is a healer and you're gold.
---
Not to mention going back and doing those quests for extra gold
---
It does kind of set a bad example. I'd bet quite a few people started picking up SM groups, and skipping zones after examining streams. I'm glad everyone is having fun, and people should be allowed to enjoy it, but for a better release experience we should squash as many bugs as possible.

this is the correct answer. I get chills when the chorus kicks in on the dwarf.

Clearly you're upset.

Y so mad bro?
---
This is fucking incredible.
---
1) You're delusional if you think even half your groups end up like this when you wipe in BFD.
---
2) You're delusional if you're calling this game a masterpiece, at this point, after running a level 20 dungeon.

I came back to wow from 7 years off due to this, sigh 
---
Wow still got me back been a aweso.e few months now!
---
Do Americans not get lower monthly sub prices for WoW if they buy several months at a time? Because at least in Europe if you bought even like 3 months at a time it would cost like 25% less than the normal monthly sub price.
---
Wondering because you calculated those 66.6 months with the full 15 dollar per month price.
---
Shadowfang Keep and Scarlet dungeons on alliance side also took a good while to reach
---
Only engineers buy grenades. If you're farming ore to craft to grenades... you are usually better off just selling the ore itself.
---
Highest skill ceiling class imo is hunter. Even moreso for PvE. Melee and auto shot weaving are an art.

What happens in AQ that invalidates 2H fury?

I can't remember the exact order of the spaces but something like "H pal AD in" in gnomish said "I hav a gun"

Webster dictionary and the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy both describe whataboutism as a variation of the “tu quoque” logical fallacy. 
---
“Rhetoricians generally consider it [whataboutism] to be a form of tu quoque, which means "you too" in Latin and involves charging your accuser with whatever it is you've just been accused of rather than refuting the truth of the accusation made against you. Tu quoque is considered to be a logical fallacy.”
---
You can copy/paste into WoW chat and/or macros
---
I don't know what you're talking about, or are you some dude from the future? ^/^s
---
That seems very strange to me. Personally I've never ignored anybody in WoW (except gold spammers who are technically ignored when you report them I think?). 
---
What is it exactly that you can't handle seeing? How do you come across it often enough to get past 50 ignores? I can't imagine anyone saying something that I would feel the need to ignore them for. Do you feel like a sensitive person?
---
Sorry if these questions are strange; I honestly just don't understand this mentality. 
---
I've had people rage whisper me and then when I try to whisper them back, I'm on ignore. What is the point of that? Ignoring is so bizarre to me.
---
I agree with this. I'd rather see true classic servers remain then create additional servers with our characters duplicated and allow for TBC that is still locked at 60 and sticks with the vanilla meta and feel while splintering off into it's own thing. That'd be interesting.
---
I’m super patient, but I was playing on a pserver the other day and this tank just...didn’t understand it. He was specd half ret-half prot at level 35, he didn’t use any sort of aggro generating abilities....it was a mystery how he got where he was and it showed that he just wasn’t gonna he able to finish. Also the healer sucked. So I fucked off and felt no guilt.
---
everyone liked this
---
Yeah, I dont mind a tool or list where people can sign up for what they are into. That would be a little more superior than shouting in trade chat. It would have to be based on the server population though and not include any teleportation as mentioned. And since vanilla doesnt have item levels and achievement you would still have to talk to the person and get to know them and their experience before accepting them into the group.
---
Clearly you can transcend through the space and time and make those kind of conclusions about another person.
---
I understand now you are "just trolling" so somehow it becomes a contribution to the conversation, never understood that concept. 
---
And with that phrase you end the argument, you confirm my views.

Feel free to come up with another meme like comment.

---
I never once said the actions the GM took were over zealous or anything other than completely acceptable. But people calling for account bans and suspensions need a reality check. The people who ruined the winterspring funeral didn't ever get suspended, and that event was much greater in terms of importance.
---
One button at 60 huh? Let’s hear about your vanilla experience then.
---
You might be talking about making iron grenades to vendor as some people do this as it’s a good way to increase the value of the raw materials. However, only when comparing straight to vendor. Selling ore to players will almost always be better but an option if saturated.

No one is arguing that Agility isn't useful for Warriors, they're bickering about the exact value Crit gives vs Strength. 20 Agility gives a Warrior 1% Crit, so that is the value of Agility, 1/20 of 1% Crit. Now you need to determine how many Strength you value 1% Crit is worth, and then you divide that by 20 to get your value for Agility. This isn't a situation where there can only be two opinions, as the actual opinion you're talking about is the amount of Strength that 1% Crit is worth.
---
Well, if you look at my posts you'll see that I do not care about likes, but it's a decent way to gauge popularity here, and it shows you should go back to YouTube.

I think cross-faction speak can get you muted, not sure how well they'll enforce it on Classic though. My friends and I used to use it in BGs a bit and never got muted. You're probably fine... unless you spam like an idiot.
---
Vanilla had add ons in the beta.
---
I read somewhere they intentionally designed the game to be customizable by players rather than having a set interface.
---
No idea why tho, was a pretty crap idea imo, not having raid frames and decursive functionalities in the shipped game was the stupidest thing ever really.
---
I’m a vanilla lover, the game is pretty much perfect imo, but I’ll never understand what went so wrong with the interface, it seems like whoever’s job it was to make it really did not give a single fuck. 
---
It’s just so opposite, everything else in the game seems to have been made with such purpose and dedication with high attention to detail, yet the interface looks like something they threw together in a day and decided they couldn’t be assed touching it again.
---
If you’re looking to be top tier it might make a difference but if you’re going to be more casual I’d say go with your preferred race.
---
Tauren do still have a larger hit box and Blizzard confirmed it will stay that way. 
---
Keep in mind in high level PVP people might adapt to that essentially removing the benefit. It is very hard to adapt to a 25% stun resist on Orc. 
---
Side not, I am not sure how they will address the high ping, but I saw Asmon duel this NE warrior or rogue and it was weird, he was lagging all over the place. So maybe Tauren lagging could be a thing.
---
Dark Spear trolls for Life!
---
Not server resets. Just fresh ones
---
Which are you saying is better for Fury tanks?
---
My understanding is taurens get 7 yards reach but also hit from 7 yards so it cancels each other out. Orc wins imo.
---
Razorgore as a hunter was some of ther most fun I'd ever had in PvE.
---
That would have been Lucifron, any mage doing dps instead of decurse on that fight is a bad mage
---
Alliance
---
I did this for the first time on a Pserver a few weeks ago - and my team seemed to have no clue what they were doing..
---
Is there any reason for taking it slow? We had the drop mobs tagged out and 2 mages - I kept going OOM trying to AoE the packs down while the tank / team dawdled around really slow.
---
It took 2 tries each time I did it because of this..
---
Why do people go slow in that room?
---
Obesity?? I've been eating junk food and drinking soda all my life lol, still a twig. Plus since when does soda make you obese? Beer will give you a belly sooner than soda will. Stop drinking beer and alcohol if you wanna be healthy.

Does the Gnome INT racial only count for base INT or does it include stats from gear, buffs, elixirs, etc?

I liked having to fond the tomes for the polymorph abd other spells.

Vanilla ui sucks ass they didn’t even remember to add raid frames

The Logitech G502 is the best mouse I’ve ever used. I can’t speak to headsets because I use a boom mic and headphones most would consider “audiophile”.

Hi, you posted this informative post 2 months ago. I was just wondering how you calculated the Morrowgrain quest to be around 30 rep per hour? I understand there is a 10 minute cooldown for seeds. I read a post on a vanilla database comment section of someone claiming it would take a total of 70 hours /played to convert all the seeds. Is this how you got the 30 rep per hour value? Did you factor in the drop rate and just average it?  And finally, is that 30 rep per hour figure with or without the +150 herbalism buff?
---
Regardless, thanks for this post. It helped me out a lot in making plans for my human characters.
---
Jokes on you, they’re a youth LARGE.
---
wow, you're sweating more than you ever have. not a bad thing - you could stand to lose a few pounds.
---
I see what you did there. Well done. Take an upvote. Pablo would be pleased.
---
Half a year, but yeah.
---
could you rub my feet?
---
I was literally saying something to this effect last night in a levelling dungeon. 
---
We were 2 pulls in and I realised I had only gotten 2 of the 3 quests, it was one blink away to grab. In that time my friend I was playing with informs me the group has voted to kick me.
---
I then rage in chat about how toxic this shit is like it’s not hard to type a message to someone to ask if something is up rather than blindly kick. Pointing out how if you were a new player you would have no idea why you were being kicked and probably just give up.
---
Some say the Classic to BC transition "screwed over" their class, others think it helped define them and make them more relevant.  That is more personal preference on what you value in a class than anything else
---
Where is this mentioned?
---
And if its banned why not just let them delete the post?
---
Yeah, no unarmored mounts in Classic, that’s confirmed.
---
Shame about the DHKs though. I only plan to do just enough honorable PVP so I can stay rank 3 while getting as many DHKs as I want.
---
This isn’t for a regular consumer.  Look up how much reference monitors cost and the gear for them.  That is Market Apple is after
---
If you’re thinking of just PvP terms, you need to take into account that you will be a big target as a Tauren as well.
---
Really? Any benefits or is it just easier to stay with something older than deal with the pains of upgrading?
---
I’m more referring to fighting people trying to kite me and npc’s running away in fear. I want to be able to react quick enough so I don’t get the out of range issue. 
---
For example if I charged someone and they started to run away, would 200 ms of their movement be further than the extra range of the Tauren or would I be constantly out of range. Assuming both players are running at the same speed.
---
Orc will ultimately be the superior choice. If this is entirely based on racials and you arent concerned about the character model go orc.
---
As far as headsets i really enjoy the hyperx cloud 2, they might be a little pricey though, maybe around 80 bucks.  as far as mice I really like most of the logitech ones, i use the G502 and its my favorite mouse ive ever had.   These are just what i know and what i like.  Honestly as long as you stay away from razer you should be pretty good, Im sure a lot of people will now comment saying their razer products work great, But man ive only had bad experiences with them and from my research so has a lot of people on the internet.
---
How woukd seal of righteous proc seal of command if you cant have both up at the same time?
---
And here I am, coming from games like RO and EVE, wondering what's the deal with all the ability clutter in classic WoW.
---
Right, and that's not a logical fallacy. For example, if you're accusing my country of killing someone, and yours does the same, you can't pretend to come from a superior moral high ground.
---
"Whataboutism" was invented as a way to deflect the criticism that Russians would return when the US criticized their government's way of doing things.
---
Americans would make an accusation, and Russians would point out how America did something just as bad - which is, and was totally true, as America is a terrible country in nearly all respects.
---
If you want to criticize someone for being immoral or unethical, you can't at the same time be immoral or unethical, as such, whataboutism is not a legitimate concept, and never has been.
---
I don't know why they haven't made a meta post about this, but they delete these topics and in the message they say it's banned until phase 3.
---
[Spearmints says so here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bvcn3i/some_ideas_on_how_they_could_add_new_content_to/epo18v2/?st=jwk6u4uj&amp;sh=83da5b9e) and in a few other comments where he locks threads.
---
66 months that's 5 and a half years. Meaning many of us already spent more than that on wow.
---
The quest for instant gratification has left modern wow with no gratification to be found.
---
This is why Classic is so special!
---
IIRC Blizzard made a list back in the day. #1 was Vael from BWL
---
Finally! Someone posts a picture of an actual faction that exists. All this made of talk of some fake "alliance" faction is getting on my nerves. Everyone knows there's only 1 faction and that's the Horde.
---
Imagine thinking you can actually play the Bandits race.
---
fuck you bitch.
---
You said furry warrior
---
I stopped doing steam when i realized i spent $999 dollars in less than a year, and most of the stuff i bought i didn't even play that much if at all.
---
Is there a place to request beta/Classic addons?
---
What is the best class/race to grief the opposing faction with?
---
I seriously doubt we’re gonna see a level 60 beta.
---
This is amazing
---
Bro my mom told me once that when I was at school, the computer came on and there was the face of the devil laughing and then it shut off.  
---
WoW caused that. Because aside from school I did nothing but play WoW. I looked and all she did was unplug the power cable and took it. I just got another power cable from my room and played some more. She tried saying "You're going to get more viruses if you keep playing!"
---
All you need is a sub and you can play it to 110. If you take your time and try out different classes, races, and even factions, it'll be plenty engaging until August.
---
This makes me so glad I am rolling Alliance this time around, fuck blessing of freedom..
---
It's probably a level 5 instance full of rats and slimes.
---
&gt;We made adjustments, finished the instance, and said goodbye as friends
---
Meanwhile 90% of the raid to themselves: "Thank fucking god it's over, holy shit that is the most incompetent group of fuckwits I've ever seen, hope I'll never will group up with them again"
---
The alliance leveling guide has you go from Elwynn to Darkshore if you're human. Loch Modan and Westfall dont work well right when you finish Elwynn at level 11. Alliance had an awkward optimal leveling path.

&gt;Your argument was “current gaming trends” I argued that their is no change in gaming trends from a consumer perspective in the last 2 decades. Just not any evidence of that at all. 
---
The slower games have gotten way less popular, and the high octane, fast paced games got way more popular.
---
Apex, LoL, and Fortnite is far, far more popular than anything that was every popular in 2004.
---
&gt; It would be absurd to come to the conclusion that people don’t want ice cream anymore, the reality is they don’t want sushi flavored ice cream. This is exactly what happened with world of Warcraft post TBC, they tried to bring in a different demographic and alienated the one they had.
---
Okay, but why are there so many other sushi stores in business meanwhile the ice cream stores are decrepit ? Even if there are some ice cream stores on the market that sold stuff that used to be incredibly popular.
---
&gt;This is exactly my point. They are far less successful because of it.
---
I don't think so. Final Fantasy XIV, SWTOR, and ESO seem to be doing way better than what MMOs used to.
---
&gt;Everquest never saw the success wow did so this would be expected, classic WoW is is a far superior product we know that.
---
Right, but my point is, Everquest was still considered a fantastic game. No ones flocking to it, even if its offering something that people say is missed on the market.
---
I think its very likely the younger crowd, the fortnite generation, might look to WoW like how you're looking at Everquest. They might think its a boomer game.
---
&gt; “That’s it, Mister Vimes. No more knives. I can’t run. I surrender. No messing about this time. I
---
give in, okay? Just arrest me? For old times’sake?”

&gt; The Beast screamed inside Vimes. It screamed that no one would blame him for doing the
---
hangman out of ten dollars and a free breakfast. Yeah, and you could say a swift stab now was the
---
merciful solution, because every hangman knew you could go the easy way or the hard way and there
---
wasn’t one in the country that’d let something like Carcer go the easy way. The gods knew the man

deserved it… …but young Sam was watching him, across thirty years.
---
&gt; When we break down, it all breaks down. That’s just how it works. You can bend it, and if you

---
down until there’s nothing unbroken. It starts here and now.
---
&gt; He lowered the sword.
---
&gt; Carcer looked up, grinning, and said, “Never tastes right, does it, haha, an egg without salt…”
---
&gt; Vimes felt his hand begin to move of its own accord—
---
&gt; And stopped. Red rage froze.
---
&gt; There was The Beast, all around him. And that’s all it was. A beast. Useful, but still a beast. You
---
could hold it on a chain, and make it dance, and juggle balls. It didn’t think. It was dumb. What you
---
were, what you were, was not The Beast.
---
&gt; You didn’t have to do what it wanted.
---
Nice find! I thought this was the case because I remember having to hang around *outside* raids while we prepared rather than safely inside the instance.
---
Yeah, we’ll be ringing the gong a week after it drops. Any guild that thinks they can get more than one mount is delusional.
---
Not doing quests will leave you with low reputations though. So all that extra cash will be wasted on buying cloths for turn ins.
---
Fun fact: Michael McConnohie, who voiced Uther, also voiced Kel'Thuzad. In Wrath of the Lich King they got a new VA for Kel since Michael ended up voicing the Lich King.
---
He has done voices for a few minor bosses and other small characters along the years as well as Deathwing! ALSO the Necromancer in D2 and the classes incarnation in Heroes of the Storm, Xul.
---
Gold wise yes. Iv been preaching this and have made many videos on the topic. But if your willing to strategically farm and grind out a few levels especially in the 40-60 range you can easily have enough gold for all your pre raid BIS boe gear enchants and epic mount money.
---
I never said Tauren. They are different, special, the extra range on attacks really changes things. 
---
But yeah just pulling your leg here.
---
The original was perfect. Fuck off
---
Hunters start out great in endgame content but don’t scale as well with gear so will struggle to keep up with dps by the time AQ and Naxx are coming out. If you’re in a solid raid group you’ll be good but pugs probably won’t want many hunters for the later phase stuff

* High capacity (approx 6tb per tape)
---
* Lower cost per gb
---
* High read speed (1tb/hr)
---
* Portability (disk platters are fragile)
---
* Reliability (tapes are not fragile when stored properly)
---
* Longevity (tapes do not deteriorate at the same rate)
---
Unless a revolutionizing storage technology is invented, tape will likely remain in use for the next two decades. Possibly for much longer.
---
Should definitely go fast. Two mages should had made that pretty simple too :(
---
Rushing to 60 in a 14 year old game with fixed content would only cause me regret.
---
I'll still make good time, but there's really no point in worrying about "being behind"

Just be content where you are wherever you are. You might meet a good friend you otherwise wouldn't have met.

Kind of a weird question about possibly making a Hunter. Is it possible to use a Bow as my ranged weapon throughout Classic? I know there are a number of times where a Gun/Cross Bow are BiS but I have a weird thing where I only like using Bows. Am I gimping myself mega hard by doing this? I’m not trying to be a number 1 Hunter, just do decent enough to earn my spot in content and play at a decent level. Wondering if this plan is insane or can I get away with it playing fairly casually? Plan on doing a mix of PvE and PvP but neither to a super hardcore level.
---
LOL is this old school Doom?????
---
This is why I love classic &lt;3 this community always keeps me hype for the game. Love you guys
---
Yeah I totally understand Outlands ruining stuff because it's its own world. I don't want to feel disconnected either and if this was purely my decision I wouldn't do that. Just a personal want because I really enjoyed the zones that BC offered. Still, can't say I'd be disappointed if they decided that chunks of Outlands fell onto Azeroth close to other places. As long as it was done in a way that made sense and didn't throw everything off of that Classic feeling. 
---
Of course I'm not sure they could successfully pull something like that off. I trust Kara could be implemented well. Maybe even Dragon Isles and Hyjal as long as it's mainly raid/dungeon focused. Ultimately I'm not sure that entire zones could be added, but maybe in a year or two after the devs have decided what's next (if anything) and have been working on stuff. Of course I really do think that they would have to keep the soul of Classic without adding anything that has slowly killed the game for so many of us. Even if they do decide based on community feedback that BC (as it was) is the next step they need to just do a character copy onto a nee server and let people play Classic without BC as well. Of course this will eventually create so many splinters, but as long as both communties are big and healthy, with players having the option to go back to their Classic pre-BC characters on a whim it should be ok.
---
There were three versions of Shield Slam in vanilla. The first two sucked, and the third was very good, for both damage and threat. 
---
The first version was added in 1.6, then two months later in 1.7 they increased the threat. It was terrible from then until 9 months later when 1.11 came out and it was redesigned. They lowered the rage cost to 20, and reduced the base damage but added damage based on your shield block value, ultimately doing more damage per rage and threat per rage than before, even while going from 30 rage to 20 rage.
---
Play on pervers until release and thank me later for the advice.
---
Resto still will wear a lot of cloth but there is far more healing leather than there is healing plate so its not as bad. Resto also gain in combat mana regen from spirit while paladins only regen with mana per 5 so the amount of useful gear for paladins in their armour class is reduced even further.
---
You can wear any armour type below your best armour class so a paladin can wear anything and a druid can only wear leather and cloth.
---
One of the original devs said that at first they wanted servers to be 500 players each, or 250 vs 250, so that you're actually going to recognize names after a while.
---
While these numbers are rather unsustainable(people come and go), 1-2k server would be ideal.
---
I have no fucking idea why would anyone ever want more players. The game's just not that big.
---
This is an incredible guide!  If you don't mind, I'm going to add it to my [WoW Classic: Class Guides and Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b5mh0e/wow_classic_class_guides_resources/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) list.

Or there is a grace period where the victim can report a stolen account. After that period its clear that the account compromised was abandoned. 
---
So all the data that they had (like IP's and such) could be lost, so all the GM sees is "banned for REASON" and is unable to determine anything else.
---
Id say you rather have a druid tank - no need for mana breaks and still had the AOE threat. 
---
30-40 have plenty of quests. Id rather do dungs 52-60. Get some prebis on the way.  Typically you start getting them at 58-60, but with dungs being easier we can start earlier. Just gotta have a proper composed group

Hahaha look at this mong lmao

Gnome mages have a huge PVE and PVP advantage over their human counterpart, wtf are you talking about?

Torn between Orc warlock or UD mage... I'm a multi glad healer that started during BC, so I want to experience classic as a DPS. Love dueling, BGs and wPvP, but I really want to find a guild and clear all raids. Biggest concern on mage is that they will be about 20% of the population. I'll be leveling solo.

The blackwing lair one is too good
---
can you stop advertising your favorite streamer here ? i know you get paid for it but your streamer already have their own subreddit
---
STOP CROSSPOSTING HERE
---
Wow. cool..
---
I don't know why but the idea of a troll stripping down to his briefs and quickly putting his clothes back on again for extra damage just tickles my funny bone.
---
Lol will mages be popular? More so than ever my friend.
---
Robe, not robes.
---
The ashbringer clearly is a paladin weapon. So just be the No1 Paladin in your Raid and remind your raid lead about it.
---
Holy Reckoning Build would synergize well with this sword.
---
With some close contenders behind that including:
---
* Defias Pillager
---
* Cat
---
* Defias Looter
---
Hahahahahhaha, which race tho? Fucking loser
---
Yes, but I wouldn't drink it.
---
The plural of robe is robes.
---
Emerald dream was the raid in legion go away with your bs and leave classic alone.
---
Yeah, goblin rocket helm, but the animation and the jump do not compute with what I'm seeing
---
You can play anything up to 110 with just a sub.
---
MY MAN
---
Any recommendations for headphones? Probably can’t go super cheap there but I’ll definitely like to keep an eye out for sales. 😃
---
Sort of. They're re-releasing vanilla WoW.
---
new boss mechanic where the boss fills your bags with bleach and you have to drink it and take damage to clear bag space for something else i dunno
---
And there’s only ONE BoP robe a mage can make and use.
---
A seal will overwrite any currently active seals when cast. So if you try to do what you want to do you'll cast SoC, get SoC, cast SoR, lose SoC, gain SoR.
---
If you benefit from any other source that gives you additional weapon swings ([Reckoning](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Reckoning_\(paladin_talent\)), [Thrash blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade), [Hand of Justice](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11815/hand-of-justice)) then yes, SoR will proc on those attacks.
---
Weird, I distinctly remembering when Blizz fixed the horde roof exploit.
---
There's no way all of these are going to make it in, it'll trivialize the game so much
---
This was a thing during Burning Crusade, wasn’t it? If so, then no. It shouldn’t be done for classic servers…
---
!remindme 80 days
---
Lame - I kept telling the tank too speed it up, next time ima yell more. Sometimes it actually feels like i’m back in 2005 when I play Vanilla.
---
1.13 as long as they avoid ever adding flying and keep the power creep under control and not the ludicrous jumps that ramped up each expansion and it can work out.
---
Classic wow developers stopped working at blizzard over ten years ago.
---
What you have now is monkeys copying and pasting old content.
---
Please tell me people aren’t so stupid they think the people making classic now are the same original creators....
---
I subbed to Retail for a shot at beta like a total sucker, and have been using my time farming gold. Once Classic is out, I think a lot of people are going to play Retail solely to farm enough gold for their monthly subscription.
---
Don't worry too much about mage spam.  They have best cc, aoe, and give water.  #1 desired dps for 5mans.  It was only slightly harder to find groups as a mage as a priest.  Also multiple mages is almost never a problem in a group or raid, their damage tends to feed each other.
---
Maybe not contributing much but my gf saw the horde one and said,” I thought that was Shrek.”
---
Not that I’m advocating for it, but this is what happens without sharding. People dont want to get caught in an unplayable slog with thousands of other players. It’s a pretty obvious outcome.
---
Like level 60 cap, and hunters have need ammo? And op pallys? Sick
---
Yep. The Longevity, Backwards compatibility and reliability are HUGE to cybersecurity professionals and corporations.
---
Powder injection molding, aka PIM, also known as Metal Injection Moldng, says you're wrong, smartypants.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_injection_molding
---
If you love World PvP and 1v1 Warlock is the king.
---
Relaunching vanilla parallel to the modern game.  Modern game will continue getting content patches unchanged.
---
**Metal injection molding**
---
Metal injection molding  (MIM) is a metalworking process in which finely-powdered metal is mixed with binder material to create a "feedstock" that is then shaped and solidified using injection molding. The molding process allows high volume, complex parts to be shaped in a single step. After molding, the part undergoes conditioning operations to remove the binder (debinding) and densify the powders. Finished products are small components used in many industries and applications.

there really isnt one tbh lol I just thought it was an interesting fact
---
Do you wanna date my avatar?
---
Robe of Power, Robe of the Archmage. That's two.
---
May I ask what DI cheesing razorgore was?
---
Generally if your class can be gnome.. go gnome. Unless you go warrior or rogue and never intend to pvp.
---
I don't even think that would be worth it. Why spend time farming in retail when you can just play the game you want.
---
If the book is not available from the start (added in 1.10 implicates Phase 5) people have to completely drop engineering to learn the other specialisation.
---
I thought the teleportation aspect of the meeting stones was good. At least 2 (or 3?) people still had to be there to summon, and required the group to coordinate who would be there first, etc. 
---
I really really hate the instant teleports nowadays.
---
just a thought, but i think the following happened:  
---
He used goblin net, net backfired and pulled him to the enemy and rooted him (it can backfire as just a root, or pull to the enemy and then root), but because he had freedom he didn't get rooted, so he just flew through the air.  
---
I don't think he knows about this backfire and that's why he didn't know what happened either.
---
I’d love to play a Druid as a healer for raids and some pvp. Is there a spec that allows for most points in resto with enough placed into feral to be able to fool around as feral for WPvP?
---
I know it seems really nit-picky but In a discussion about whether or not you can summon people while inside an instance, being clear about whether or not the target was already inside the instance matters.
---
&gt;they sent someone to buy ammo and then summoned him in the middle of the instance
---
Can be also read as if they sent someone outside and then summoned the target without it being inside the instance. 
---
So it is not *quite* what you said :P
---
I'm sorry, but there are absolutely hundreds of arguments for why people prefer classic on this subreddit. There are also countless YouTube videos explaining why people think it's better. 
---
The fact is that you just simply disagree with those arguments. There is no point explaining anything more to someone who cannot see past his own opinion.
---
You are a very closed minded person. I hope you grow out of that.
---
Good day.
---
Same account I hope, sounds to good to be true, hopefully they keep the lv cap at 60 for awhile. Thanks watching the video now
---
If you want to play mage, go mage. There will be alot of warriors, rogues and mages tho. Keep that in mind.
---
Ironforge &gt; Undercity &gt; Stormwind &gt; Darnassus &gt; Thunder Bluff &gt; Orgrimmar
---
And I’m rolling Horde.
---
Dont worry about magister it is literally terrible for mage
---
  Not a single piece of it is bis.  For pve you want to focus on spell power, and for pvp focus on stam and int.  Magisters is super heavy int with a lot of spirit.  Dreamldmist is the set that will have every caster rolling on it.
---
press F to pay respects
---
That won't continue because once players run the same instance a few times will voice there concern as soon as things don't go smoothly as a past run. The pservers are like this now and I bet classic will eventually also.
---
suh bruh? want another spanking?
---
Now we just need somebody to make a game to put under all that UI.
---
henlo stinky
---
your mother smells of elderberries
---
Well met.
---
I played on dial up until BC. Shit was lit.
---
Thankfully, layering will allow us to actually enjoy playing. Shouldn’t be too bad thanks to this system.
---
My game plan day 1 is to run around and grab all the flight paths on both continents, I’ll do this on both my warrior and rogue. Then I’ll run my bank alt to stormwind. Hopefully by then I’m a respectable level, then I’ll try to find a corner of the world with mobs around my level to grind to hopefully get some grey drops and work on some level appropriate quests.
---
Yupyup. It's gonna be great.
---
Your an idiot the game was shipped as it should have anything that got cut was cut for good reason stop trying to ruin classic with your garbage classic+ ideas.
---
The fact everyone has their own individual ideas of what should happen and no one can agree shows none of us actually know what is best for the game so please and any change is worse than no change.
---
JUST FUCKING LEAVE THE GAME ALONE FFS.
---
Maybe when naxx has been out for a year we can have these discussions, but honestly why the fuck are we discussing the end of vanilla when we haven’t even started leveling?
---
No changes = nobody angry
---
Changes = everybody furious
---
I honestly think the classic+ people are the same old vanilla haters just trying to troll or ruin classic.
---
But Robe of Power is useless, no wonder I’d forgotten it.
---
Well we have a pretty good idea from the stress tests. It's slows you down a lot but it's not really the end of the world, just means you need to budget for a much slower time for the first 5 levels in particular, but will be fairly slow going at least till 25 if you're back in the pack.
---
All gold farming involving dungeons will be abit worse in classic due to no /camp out.
---
Spicy water
---
It's definitely not useless, probably the best robe you can get at that level.
---
Dwarf female so people can look at you and ask: What is this guy doing with his life.
---
Level 30 in under 24 hours, then I’ll sleep.
---
Still have one of each saved on a shelf from when I thought WoW is life. They are dusty as all hell.
---
Go for it. As far as dungeons and groups go. Duo hunters (especially if they are competent) can actually duo a fair amount of dungeon bosses and quests.
---
Rogues are good. But fury warriors start outscaling them hard mid-late game. You wont see a rogue out dps a warrior when everyone starts getting gear. Unless the warrior is a pleb ofc.
---
Shit, have one tank and you've got a party that'll wreck any dungeon.
---
You'll discover this as you level paladin, but as long as you're wearing the appropriate gear for what you're trying to do, you'll be fine.
---
The only talent you need in order to heal at 60 is illumination, which is 20 points holy, leaving you free to go 31 ret if you wish. However, unless you over gear the content, you should expect to be healing or cleansing 90% of the time. Idk about private servers, but back in vanilla, the only time any of our pallies put on their ret gear in a raid was to clear trash/farm content faster.
---
I think if you are willing to put in the work to manage multiple gear sets, and can accept that you'll still primarily be invited to heal, then paladin is a good fit for you. If you're expecting actual hybrid gameplay, i.e., healing while dpsing, then you should pick a different class because endgame will be very disappointing.
---
what was the verdict?
---
snutz got to 40 first by spamming SM. but he also didn't go to sleep and did it in one sitting.
---
questing/grinding still might be better in terms of xp/hr.
---
Yeah, because sooo many mages are dying to stay level 33...
---
Yes, there is nothing you gain from disc or holy trees that is not replaceable with gear.  When you first hit 60, if you struggle maybe respec holy/disc for awhile until you gear out and have enough stats, but after that shadow is fine for any dungeon.
---
There are very few things in vanilla that engineers make which can be used by non engineers
---
Everyone, get in here!
---
What the fuck have you brought upon this cursed land
---
you seem triggered by how he wants to play..
---
Nah, but it's nice to have if you've gotten unlucky with dungeon drops or don't wanna spend time farming them. Mages wanna blast during lvling, and decent gear helps with that.
---
It's active and working in the beta according to people that have the beta.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bd5yui/analysis_of_private_server_40man_raid_composition/
---
5 consistent raiders, maybe up to 7 or 8 considering some will quit, suck, or have bad attendance.
---
Orc is a lot more important than having a Paladin.
---
At least Scarlet Monastery will be free of bugs.
---
Dire Maul East. You pair up with a Warrior or Rogue and jump down to the lower floor before killing Hydrospawn, Zhevrim Thornhoof and Alzzin the Wildshaper. There are dozens of video tutorials online.
---
Ideally the Shaman goes herbalism/enchanting while the Warrior goes mining/whatever he prefers as his second profession.
---
Pre-bis is recommended for both Rogue and Warrior, and the Rogue pretty much has to be sword spec.
---
Mages have the highest population but thats just they had access to everything, free food, easy transportation, best aoe, and guilds can take multiples without worry for raids.
---
Orc warlock may be a downgrade, because you will use demon sac for dps so you lose your +pet dmg and the blood dury is melee ap boost not spell
---
None of the classes are really that hard to get in to on the PvE side of things. However, some people find stance dancing hard. People generally agree that warriors are one of the harder classes for new players. Again tho, none of them are very hard if PvE is what you inted to focus on. Remember that with the correct gear nothing beats a fury warrior in dps.
---
Good times. I didn’t remember too many groups breaking in vanilla. People were quite civil. Just hope there won’t be retards that complain about having to cc and lack of mass group pull. I see a lot of streamers mass pulling without a tank in the group to grind quick xp in the dungeons. That is fine if you know your shit and cc timings with your group. Doesn’t hurt that most are overgeared. My fear is that kid Randy’s will see that as a legitimate strat in pugs and will bitch and rage in group when things don’t go their way.
---
Mc required a while to balance afterwards tho.
---
Well, with 'community' actually mattering again, there is potential.
---
Absolutely was wrath
---
I fuckin' love tape drives dude. Without them we'd have never gotten classic.
---
Not only this but if your a dbag to someone theyre still on your server and you will see them again. It may bite you in the ass
---
Do you somehow think that Blizzard fired all the classic devs before BC came out?
---
Jesus christ, the circlejerk is strong with this one.
---
"Difficult obstacles"? Like what, lighting all braziers after Kelris at once?
---
"hardships", like what, having yellow gear because you wiped three times?
---
There is absolutely zero chance of the “community” ever coming to a consensus on anything and policing anyone.
---
^
---
The go to "feral" pvp spec usually is something like 8/12/31 which will heal perfectly well in raids.
---
If you intend to play a dps warrior you either go human or orc. None of the other races are even close in terms out output. Orc has axe specialization and human has sword specialization which allows for alot better dps at end game. Orc also has stun resist which makes them superior in alot of PvP situations aswell.
---
It's like learning to play a game! wow you guys are awesome!
---
Druids are pretty garbo compared to the other healers. You can still do fine. But dont expect to flex on people as a resto druid in PvE.
---
Interesting. I haven’t even researched BIS. I just remembered years back, it took me half a year to get 4 pieces of magister and most classes stuck to their class set pieces.
---
If you want a hardcore guild, look at the guild recruitment sticky in this thread. Also on the wow forums.
---
If you want a casual guild, be friendly in game and you will get invited :)
---
Glad I could be of service :-D
---
Idk, Armory with 99% trash and one braindead boss is not really my definition of fun.
---
vanilla was like a good novel. it has a much higher percentage of great chapters over bad chapters. multiple people creating their own content with basic guidelines but no computer trying to figure out what does and doesn't work based on pre-existing parameters without creative touch. it is what made the old era of games so good. just look at the wc3 maps, the map designers essentially made the story for the game as they crafted the maps individually, some were good, some were bad, but in total, there were a lot of real gems in there.
---
after classic (which was it's own world, huge, and never intended to extend beyond that world, lots of unique features, secrets, and cool shit), tbc and wrath instead are small pocket universes where they barely had time to put anything together, started using data to determine what content should be added, the game was no longer designed by creatives, but by algorithms based on what works and what doesn't from user activity. which is not an organic way to create a fun game. it just uses the bad stuff and decides, oh, well this is the bad stuff most players play, so let's add more of that then!
---
basically, i think we can trust blizzard to do the right thing with classic if algorithms aren't the decisive factors of 1.13+ content; and they let people like [Mark Kern](https://www.twitch.tv/grummz_em8er/videos) make their own organic additions to the content line.
---
Twinking is still alive and well in retail. Matter of fact in most brackets if you aren't a twink you shouldn't queue.
---
Don't worry, 50% of the alliance side will be paladins which will cause 50% of the undead rogues to stop playing.
---
I’ve been using a razer naga trinity - it has 16 buttons on the side and is overall very comfortable. I’ve noticed some input delay, but I think that’s just due to the pserver I’ve been on since I never see it on other games. 
---
As far as a gaming headset, I’ve used a Astro headset that works for my PS4/PC. Works really well, but expensive for what it is.
---
I just got a Corsair Void Pro RGB wireless headset, it is amazing, I believe it’s only in the $70 area for price, the sound quality is great, also has a great mic, comes out clearly when speaking on Disc! Highly recommend.
---
&gt;Nobody got vote-kicked out to be algorithmically replaced with a stranger.
---
"what's up guys, oh you're half way done did some guy leave"
---
"haha... yeah"
---
Hail to the king :)
---
The reason ally has an advantage in PvE is not so much the racials but the fact that they have paladins.
---
so? 
---
if blizz starts raking in millions in revenue from subscriptions (which is very likely), they have resources for those things you mentioned.
---
One proc chance per cast, not one proc per missile. AoE also has one and only one chance to proc it, regardless of the number of targets
---
It’s a huuuge difference in getting a 15 year old game to work with modern software architecture and making new content. Unfortunately we have no reason to believe that Omar &amp; Co are good at the latter even after their excellent work on wow classic.
---
&gt; Ok, but how long was it in vanilla before you were really chainpulling in UBRS with completely random pugs?
---
I couldn't tell, because I never ran UBRS with a PuG. I met my Vanilla guild in my first UBRS run, and stayed with them for the remainder of Vanilla ;-) (Well, technically you could say I pugged it once, because I was a pickup for them at that run)
---
&gt; before you were really chainpulling in UBRS
---
That was some time later, when everyone had a few solid pieced of MC gear under his belt.
---
I am not trying to make the point here, that Vanilla dungeons were trivially easy. They were not. They could wipe you, and failpulls could wipe you even in very good gear. The notion I am trying to dispell here, is the misguided belief, that Vanilla was some sort of Uber-Elite-Super-Hardcore game, where only the most l33t dare tread. It wasn't. Vanilly is not a mechanically hard game. It was of a reasonable difficulty, with reasonable meaning: Enjoyable for a majority of the playerbase.
---
----
---
Bottom line:
---
**Most players** will find the dungeons reasonably challenging. There will be OOMs, there will be wipes. There will be tears, drama, joy and slaughter.
---
And yes, that includes **most players** who believe playing retail for the last 8 years somehow makes them MMO geniuses. We have seen, in every new expansion, **most players** flopping, failing and wiping in entry level dungeons.
---
The difference in Retail, which makes it appear as if Dungeons were piss poor easy, is the super rapid gear progression, and gear progression by doing only solo content. People rapidly reach a point where they simply outgear everything the dungeon content throws at them, making for a piss poor experience.
---
Thank you. This is the information I needed. Orc it is.
---
Dwarf is going to be the best priest on ally. No matter what spec you intend to go.
---
Acronym for Bass/Icefish/Salmon, 3 types of food (+Str, +Int, +Agi) that are considered bis for preraid dungeons.
---
Most of the player base does not take part in these surveys, they are not representative.
---
So I take it the rings and necklaces aren't as common as I thought they were.
---
I agree for the most part but I also think a bunch of the percieved ‘screwing over’ is due to changes reflecting both what was ‘lacking’ during 1.8+ (I think, cant remember when exactly) and what the devs needed the classes to perform like in the new expansion. Shaman is a pretty good example of people losing their shit over not being rebalanced
---
Going druid in vanilla as your first character is not a very smart thing to do. The only people who should dedicate to play druids are the one who are dead set to play druids. People who cant see themselves playing anything else. Try a rogue.
---
Im on vacation now, I will let you know :)
---
MUh iMmERsiOn!
---
&gt;Scholo, Strath? Trash being removed? Respawn rates decreased?
---
That could have something to do with the fact that these dungeons were originally designed for 10 people, and then reworked into 5man. But I don't expect "Mr. Powergamer" to know that, because "Mr. Powergamer" likely started the game long after Vanilla and has nothing but hersay to fuel his statements.
---
&gt;MC will be be 1 hour snooze fest with 1.12 talents.
---
I am looking forward to your rage posts, when your "snooze fest" wipes you at Lucifron, once you figure out that there is no Mass Dispell :D
---
I'm a Nightelf Mohawk!
---
Play what you like if lag is your only concern.
---
Doesn't it net both players when it backfires like that?
---
The game is going to die if new content isn't added. 
---
TBC may stem the tide for a bit but it'll open the door to WotLK  and that will open the door to other expansion re-releases. We already know that we can't split the player base up into unique servers, and there is no way we can keep re-releasing expansion packs and paving over old content because we'll just end up with retail. 
---
Blizzard has already set a precedent by not charging for Classic because of course we already bought the game. This leaves them financially vulnerable because it also means that they can't charge for TBC classic either. The community outrage would be awful if they tried.
---
That leaves us with two options, both of which are things Blizz can charge for, so they're more likely to do it, and they're things that add new content while not becoming retail. 1.13 post Naxx OR WoW 2 or other new MMO in the style and with the philosophy of Classic WoW.
---
I personally favor  a kind of 1.13 expansion pack/DLC with the plan to maybe include retail raid design, arguably the only good thing about retail--no fucking flex or mythic raiding though, just boss shit. No dual spec, no lfg/LFR, pure classic design integrity. 
---
Sure they could fuck it up, but there's risk in everything and if something is going to die if you do nothing, why not at least try to save it? Can blizzard TRULY ruin the game if it's already going to be ruined if we do nothing? They can't exactly ruin it harder, and if they do what's stopping you from playing on a vanilla private server afterwards.
---
Playing a feral druid seriously is pure aids. You're going to spend so much time in gnomeregan farming manual crowd pummlers.
---

---
@Hypocritical\_Oath would you like to also make this comment on the hundreds of other guild posts, including Discord Servers specifically designed for Guild Recruitment, and the Guilds who post on there with 300+ members already? Its never too early to play World of Warcraft
---
Not so fast. Good locks are almost unbeatable for mages
---
how is this different from what I already said?
---
&gt; Wuld you also rather have LFR than not being able to raid?
---
yes, I would prefer an automatic system over not playing at all.  
---
same as I would prefer sharding over not playing at all.
---
I really don't understand how one can be upset about these 2 very reasonable preferences.
---
Look deeper in to it. Cant get shit from watching streams with lvl 30 characters. Most classes are missing half their toolkit.
---
With weapon dependant classes is that wise?
---
My idiot what?  
---
You must be the one trolling here as the original devs have stated multiple times that content intended for vanilla got pushed to bc only due to financial reasons and deadlines.  
---
I have no clue why you flare up with such anger or why you are angry people are discussing such a thing? 
---
Game was obviously not ‘shipped as it should’ since bugs and exploits were fixed, catch-up systems added, battlegrounds added etc.
---
I guess I just don't understand the anxiety around 1.13. Do you guys have actual concerns? Or do you just want TBC more?

Ahhhh Risitas =)

Always a pleasure!

Time is money friend! :D
---
Now i am confused. In the first comment you say that warlocks would get " rolled" over by warriors if they are affliction, then you post a video of a terrible SL warlock who does basically nothing the whole fight and it STILL is close, as you say yourself. 
---
If your argument is that warlocks are favored we were on the same page to begin with.
---
They have BiS gear so grinding SM is probably faster. During launch, questing will 100% be faster.
---
Woah, this is stunning !!
---
If you have a pocket healer, it doesn’t matter, because you will get healed. 
---
However, we tend to focus on “big things”... well Tauren are the biggest in Classic, so in a group of Trolls, Orcs and Undead, Tauren stick out and usually get focused on. 
---
While I understand your choice to compensate for latency, IMO, the Orcs facials are far superior for PvP.
---
naxx for a year, lol, naxx is going to be cleared within hours of release.  Who is going to stick around?  People that want to farm it for a month or two?  Classic will be dead 1-2 months after naxx release.  I don't care about it now, it doesn't matter, we have the whole thing in front of us and hopefully it's great, but around the time naxx is released I hope there is a plan for BC or fresh servers or whatever is next because the clock will be ticking.  No one is going to playing this a couple months after naxx, let alone a year.
---
Is there an updated add-on that screenshots on level up? 
---
Lost all my vanilla, tbc and pre-ulduar wotlk screenshots years ago and the bit that hurts the most is not having those screenshots of me dinging in random spots after a 6 hour grind lol.
---
If not I can always make one, or fan update an existing one.
---
I love that people fail the pillar jumping test before the turtle and modern wow had to add ropes for people who couldn’t make it

Yeah, just not sold on the casting animations. Probably still gonna roll one. Cute as a button.

That's when it can become griefing imo.

Patch 1.9.0

Blizzard said, in the Beta announcement:
---
&gt;Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle .net Account. While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test **it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test.**
---
They did tell people they need to be subscribed, and they warned you, specifically, that resubbing just for the Beta is probably a bad idea.
---
So if someone did that, threw money at them, and is now disappointed, well, mate, that's your own fault.
---
I mean this is also not always a good thing.  
---
Sometimes you're stuck with a MT who has no idea what they're doing and whenever you suggest something they get passive aggressive and you just want to finish the fucking dungeon already.
---
One with the ally leaders. Your horde one is better than the ally one imho
---
Click the link &gt; go to the warlock section, find this : 
---
&gt;Drain Life and Siphon Life now reduce the amount healed when the warlock is affected by healing reducing effects (e.g. Mortal Strike, Wounding Poison).
---
Before 2.3 it was considered leech, while these effects only reduced heal. It was changed, because SL/SL locks got popular and were quite strong for a while.
---
I remember in vanilla a warlock outrolled my holy priest on the mp5 trinket in DM and I sent a whisper to someone in his guild to find out who the GM was and an angry whisper to that guy about it
---
Are you... meme-ing right now? Those big-ass portals to the Emerald Dream have been around for ages. Hell, Malfurion wasn't really in Classic *because he was in the Emerald Dream.*
---
Do you know how much content was *planned* for Classic but came out in the forms of later expansions?
---
It is a new ret build they are testing and even without bis know yet they get an increase of around 45% dmg and thus get into tier 2 raid dps wise in calculation
---
Are rogues still gonna be everywhere? I played rogue in vanilla and would really love to do so again. But competing for raid and party slots was kind of annoying. Is rogue still as popular as it was 15 years ago?
---
No.
---
I'm not 12.
---
Dang, that sucks.  My Mage is going to be so much weaker in live.
---
This mechanical lie that blizz put in the game just to screw with players is proof that they hate the Alliance.
---
To be fair there were some shady addons out there who were sharing your account information. Think you can google it or check on youtube, lots of people lost their account this way.

That guy *has* to be a troll account. Nobody can be that stupid or childish.

Nobody wants to play Classic because we hate new content. We want to play Classic because we want that old school mentality back again.
---
Pretty sure that was just about trinkets/set bonus procs to try to give AM some use. Iirc it never worked with clear casting in vanilla.
---
True, in the Roguecraft videos he 1v1s a fully geared Grand Marshall warrior while doing the naked with a single level 1 Worn Dagger shenanigans. Eviscerate and Ambush was so much flat damage

How long do you expect devs to enjoy replicating other devs works? They got in the field to make games not copy them. They deserve a chance to fail on their own works after they proved themselves to us.

I swear i drank those blue ones so much when i first started playing and I pissed blue.
---

---
Yeah comparing yourself to a group of lvl30 twinks that all have max level engineering is not the best of ideas
---
What..the..actual...FUUUUUUUUUUUUK...did I just click on ....?
---
It's not as bad as people think. Everyone fans out pretty quick. At lvl 4 you can leave the start area. People who have to do all the quests are choosing to do so. I just leave and find mobs away from the pack and skip a lot of the early quests because you get to lvl 4 so fast and you're 6 soon and people really fan out by then. The major congestion is for people forcing quests. Just skip them and kill every mob you can find.
---
I'll give you an example. During the stress test people where killing wolves near the kobolds in the human starting area. So many people the lag was bad. Nobody was killing the wolves by the river.
---
Run the other way. There are mobs everywhere. Don't have a quest for them? Who cares, they are exp. Kill whatever you can find.
---
Vqueuue addon does this
---
Intelligence gives spell crit and mana, and these guys all use engineering bombs...
---
That's actually exactly what the original commenter was trying to do: construct a logical definition for "griefing" and specifically "punishable griefing", which was that if there is a way to migitate it in the game mechanics, then anything goes.   
---
I mean sure it's still griefing, but blizzard probably won't (and probably shoudn't) be punishing this kind of gameplay.
---
To my knowledge, it started off as just a place to post Rule 34 of healers from video games. 
---
But then kind of evolved into a BDSM community somehow with their kink being "used" by other players (namely a "daddy tank" or "tank dom"). 
---
I don't understand but aye more power to 'em.
---
The difference is in whether or not the hunter travels back to town and is summoned by the vendor, versus doing that and making the return trip and just being ported past the respawned mobs.
---
Or you can summon a party member that is in the dungeon, but he may not accept the summon, hearthstone get bullets then accept the summon. This way he is back in the instance iirc
---
Looks pretty cool, if it can feel like its own game and not like a japanese or korean mmorpg i would be down. WoW does have a special place because it is cartoony tho, wouldnt mind a nice polish of the wofld however

Do you like Phil Collins? I've been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on Duke where, uh, Phil Collins' presence became more apparent. I think Invisible Touch was the group's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums. Christy, take off your robe. Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress. In terms of lyrical craftsmanship, the sheer songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why don't you, uh, dance a little. Take the lyrics to "Land of Confusion". In this song, Phil Collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority. "In Too Deep" is the most moving pop song of the 1980s, about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as, uh, anything I've heard in rock. Christy, get down on your knees so Sabrina can see your asshole. Phil Collins' solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying, in a narrower way. Especially songs like "In the Air Tonight" and, uh, "Against All Odds". Sabrina, don't just stare at it, eat it. But I also think Phil Collins works best within the confines of the group, than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio", a great, great song, a personal favorite.

Colours are all wrong.

&gt; The meeting stone version was added in Vanilla, but wasn't really utilized by many players.
---
I don't remember a single dungeon in TBC I wouldn't either summon or be summoned via the dungeon's Meeting Stone. Idk where did you get this "people weren't utilizing them" thing from.

---
When will this myth die out...
---
These guys all have at least 2x and possibly up to 3x the int you will have in leveling gear, and then they use engineering bombs and still are almost oom when they finish a pull. This will not work in normal gear, sorry
---
Added in 3.2.0: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Bluff_to_Orgrimmar_travel_guide
---
That's why they have instituted layering. To prevent overcrowding.
---
Holy shit I have thought about rolling troll for that exact reason! I really want to go gnome because that was my main in BC onwards but friends are going horde.
---
This dudes obviously a milk toast fence sitter. He was probably trying to write Charlie but fucked up and wrote "Chrundle the great" in his own blood.
---
I assume at release there will be a lot of bad mouting of vanilla in chat from retail players that don't understand it and get angry at players that enjoy themselves (the usual if I don't enjoy something, it must suck and so does everyone that actually likes it that way and I have to tell them how much they suck to feel better).
---
However I hope this will eventually die off. Fingers crossed.

I guess you are right, you never know who you ‘meet’ on the internet.

Also hitting the nail on the head regarding the mentality (for me) as I would play ugly wc2 again if it meant having a good time with my friends, but for some people it is literally about recreating everything to the same pixel without much regard for recreating the experience/journey.

Doesnt matter if the game is infested with toxic people, gear score and shady behaviour, as long as the visuals and mechanical game play is 1:1. /shrug

The great classic community, doesn't shy away from throwing insults around immediately if they don't agree with something. &lt;3

You're actually right. Maybe the net missed on the mage? There was a miss on him when he landed, idk. I can't see a keybind for net on his screen anywhere either. idk weird

Not sure if it works the same way, but the weapon proc wasn’t proccing windfury on a shaman stream I watched earlier, FYI.

The one good thing I can say about BfA is that, as always, the environment looks mostly beautiful and atmospheric (especially Nazmir, Zuldazar and Drustvar). If that is enough for you to shell out around 60-90 bucks (purchasing BfA plus sub time for 1-3 months), go for it. Otherwise, I really would wait, and maybe use a *fraction* of that money to tide you over with a new game from one of the summer sales (e.g. GOG currently has one).
---
What? That would be the most worthless ability in the game.
---
Ok he hearthed bought ammo and the was summoned from stormwind.
---
Yeh, the only things that BC did that have been ... not good was flying and the world not beeing part of the main world (which is because of the setting, but, still).
---
Yeah, sometimes it is like that as well. As a healer in dungeons, I had many conversations with new tank that didn't know what to do and were eager to learn - but some just don't care. So do some dps players, the prime example being the (at classic times) overpopulated hunter that never played in a group before and just kept doing what he did outside. From my experience, it gets less common later on.
---
LF PORT to ORG. Any mages???
---
That'd be pretty awesome
---
huh... so, is it faster than regular flight path?
---
&gt;You argument falls apart with every new raid, you understand that, right? If you opt to take or not take certain classes or specs, it is your decision to deal with those consequences. Some raids require more ranged DPS, some require more melee. Some require more tanks, some can be single tanked. Every single raid is like this...
---
We raided from MC to Naxx with the same people and only rarely changed classes or even builds. 
---
If you want to play "perfect", then, yes, you have to shuffle stuff around constantly. But that was never actually needed before Naxx if you had a "multipurpose setup".
---
&gt;Common group setups change from guild to guild, run to run, raid to raid. Just because one guild prefers to run 2 tanks for an entire raid, maybe another guild is used to runnning 4 and sacrificing DPS. This doesn't seem like poor design, it seems like it goes against what you think a raid should consist of...
---
Tell me one boss that requires 4 tanks other than 4HM.
---
Which is why they’re layering at launch and then phasing it out as people spread out
---
Check out this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bwvcek/memoria_automatically_screenshot_when_you_level_up
---
It seems the author included code you can modify with this addon to make it classic compatible.
---
Unless something has changed since I canceled my sub twinks queue separately again, that got changed when they removed stat templates.
---
My server had several twinking guilds, some since classic, and they're either all disbanded or inactive now because of the changes between xpacs and adding then removing stat templates, split queues, etc.
---
I would have never guessed any of this. Wow! This is so fascinating. I had no idea that tape had a good use in the modern world. Thank you for typing that out!
---
Yes, there are many aspects that were inspired by ASoIaF. Ice Zombies from the North, the names Azshara and Tyrion, the title of the last mission "A Symphony of Frost and Flame". There are other similarities that I have noticed, just can't remember them right now.
---
I’m not sure but I think it would be neat if they developed the storylines within the old zones.
---
TIL!
---
I believe classic has the 15 min buffs
---
On top of that crafting gear was good enough to skip T4 pieces and sometimes T5, plus T3 was good enough to skip at least T4 and Naxx was a lot easier at level 70 with new talents and spells.
---
&gt; I think a lot of people are going to play Retail solely to farm enough gold for their monthly subscription.
---
Yeah, that's gonna happen. I'll farm tens of houres in a game I don't like so I can earn Blizzard more money for a month than they would get if I paid them directly via money it takes me an hour to earn via an actual job.
---
To be honest I don't want to play Classic "pixel for pixel" as you put it. But I want an MMO that doesn't teleport me everywhere, have "daily rewards" or any of the hand-holding every other MMO does now. 
---
I want to struggle, I want to get lost, and I want to earn my keep. Shit I'd play anything that brought back that kind of mentality. Classic is just the closest thing. 
---
I've tried GW2 and ESO but nothing seems to scratch that itch of "you have to walk all the way across the world for this one thing" and "you better hope the tank and healer aren't as retarded as the DPS"
---
Yes, and people figured it out "wrong" and now it became the general accepted main way to do it. That is basically the definition of bad design.
---
Pretty much. Ever since i quit smoking weed Ive been using alcohol to fuel my long gaming sessions. Cant wait for new PoE league Im gon be an alcoholic rq

I don't think he bought the wrong kind, he's just imaging leaving both items around and a child not knowing the difference.

I... have no idea. I imagine it'll be slower unless you're literally stepping on it as it's about to leave. Otherwise you're standing around waiting 5-10 minutes for it to arrive.
---
&gt; Anyone that tries to argue that it should be 50g because it's a great gold sink is an idiot. Anyone that says a lower cost makes the game easier is fucking retarded.
---
Anyone that tries to argue that 50g for respec is shit is an idiot. Anyone that says a lower cost makes the game better is fucking retarded.
---
Oh boy I got you here, see? I have those smart and well researched arguments too...
---
Sorry but the only fcking retarded people are the ones who come with statements like "anybody who thinks otherwise is stupid".
---
You are just a catababy being mad that you cant respec on the fly like you learned to do it. If you would have done actual research and not just showing off that you have no idea you would have known that 50g is only the price for people who jump back and forth to much.

This poll looks so different than how it was back then in the vanilla days. Priest on top? Warlock over Mage? huh... my gut feeling rejects this outcome. It's like alternate reality... ;)
---
On the other hand classic servers will be exactly that, this alternate reality. 15 years have passed, people know the meta etc.
---
That’s not true. I have people in one of my discord that got in last night and tonight.
---
I couldn't agree more. In modern wow, the majority of dungeon groups would be better spent with bots instead of real people. You don't interact with them anyways and the only human reaction you might encounter is when someone loses their temper.
---
druid gives you the illusion of choice but in all reality, you can only shapeshift 4 times before you go oom. And your rotation is handicapped to only playing a certain way because that's the only playable way there is. Skill cap is at a predictable 2 on a 1-10 scale.
---
Yeah, idk how people can generally be that ignorant (to not call it stupid).
---
I liked how they added additional challenges down the line like the Stratholme timed run or using the Banner of Provocation to get a harder boss in the Ring of Law. They got good use out of the locations they already had.
---
Why is everyone in here getting downvoted? The OP is asking for this.
---
Would it have really taken more than a few minutes to make a version with a different coloured label.
---
I had it in vanilla and the procrate was abysmal.
---
I don’t understand why a character with Wrath items is posted on a classic wow subreddit? Yet they delete any type of meaningful discussion about post naxx etc.
---
Holy fuck you just unlocked a childhood memory I didn’t know I had.
---
I make an exception for Hyperx Cloud. They're actually really good for the price.

Double checked this and multiple search results back you up!

To me it isn't, because the alternative is heavy-handed easy design. Vanilla won a lot and lost some, but was over-all great. That's the risk you take when you make something good, you can't reduce errors without also killing all quality.

---
Yeah what the hell.
---
&gt; I wonder if this sense of community is going to last outside the beta?
---
It does on most private servers I've been on - really, it's just the game allowing the community shape itself, something that retail has taken away from the players.
---
with the daily hubs and farming hubs i always saw a ton of pvp despite the flying. It did reduce it a lot though.
---
I dunno, it did a pretty damn good job on things like Ninja looting and generally disreputable asshats. I remember on Azgalor the alliance side blacklisted a guy who refused to honor a duel for deletion. I have heard similar stories from other servers. I think that if "big names" on a server puts forth the idea that "we don't cooperate with the Alliance" it will once again become a thing. I could be wrong, we shall see how layering/server sizes affect this, but in Vanilla, this was a thing, and could be again.
---
heh thought so.. Well I guess it adds some flavor. ;)
---
It is 1.13 - I thought classic will be on 1.12 ?
---
NO, DON'T COVER THEM TOES, I WANNA LOOK.

---
In vanilla, you could land from a deadly height, hear the fall damage pain sound/grunt from your character, then cast blink, and take zero damage after the fact. I bring that up to say I think the videos I've seen show it isn't the same timing as true vanilla, unless we are defining that as "with bad internet".
---
To quote a great movie ... “At no point in your ramblings, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.”

Aren't both SoC and SoR, damaging judgements, they don't leave a seal on the target to procc, they just do X damage on judge and X damage or X procc on swing depending on which you currently have active.

Exactly, if retail dies guess which game is getting store and tokens? They never learn - be glad retail is what it is so that the focus isn't on classic to deliver "additional revenue streams"

Aaaaand, that's enough internet for today =)

Was probably an LTO2.
---
People really over exaggerating soul shard farm, if you need to summon everyone to raid in raid nights, just gquit tbh. Pet damage is irrelevant since you either sacrifice your pet or use imp with phase ability in tank group for stamina buff. Only decision here is %25 stun resist or Will of the Forsaken.
---
For mage vs warlock, either is totally fine if you want to see end game. Good raids usually run at least 3 warlock for curses, 4-5 spot for mages. Thing is people overlooking caster dps as 1 button spam but even with same gear, there is a huge dps gap between garbo player and good player. Pvp wise both good but mages better for huge wpvp battles ofc.
---
For an all purpose mouse my personal preference has always been the Razer Deathadder. Its just the most comfortable to me. The Logitech G502 is very good, but it just felt not good in my hand.
---
Razer makes the Trinity, which has three different swappable button layouts for the thumb section. Its too expensive imo, but some people like it. I personally shy away from anything with parts like that, more room for something to break.
---
SteelSeries 310 is a good ambidextrous mouse and the Logitech G203 is probably the best budget mouse.
---
I use a Corsair Scimitar. Its an MMO mouse, I find it more comfortable than the Naga and its cheaper.
---
I'm not as experienced on headphones. I personally just use Hyperx Cloud 2. The price for the quality is really great.
---
&gt; Great guild names
---
My latency was around 30-40 while I was on and I saw this happening.
---
Compared to retail, PvE rotation is boring. But overal classes feels way more intresting because you have the base spells of 3 specs. As a frostmage I also use scorch, fireball, arcane missles in pvp. You play your class and not your spec. And tbh, every class has something intresting.

Also you can see the patch history for ritual of summoning [here](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ritual_of_Summoning). Interesting notes:
---
Patch 1.1.0 (2004-11-07): Target of summoning ritual must already be in the same instance if caster is in an instance. 
---
Patch 1.3.0 (2005-03-07): You can no longer accept a warlock summoning while you are in combat. 
---
Patch 1.6.0 (2005-07-12): Fixed a bug where players could be summoned from outside the same instance as the warlock in some cases. 
---
Seems like it's a bug if people can actually summon players that are not in the instance already. I couldn't find anything about summoning in the [bug spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HmeFqag7dzkvibcbvcenWtY3XJLihmvmPNtlnqqsEEo/edit#gid=0) and it's also not mentioned in the ["Not a bug" list](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887)

Sorry if it was unclear I was just agreeing with your notion of ‘not against new content’ - because it is not about the content itself but what it facilitates. Yeah it may not be practical I have to run to the fishing village in desolace to get the flight point, but now I am ‘forced’ to experience that ‘journey’ and if I come back later (after getting mount) I will have something to compare the new experience to and reflect on.  
---
With teleporting or flight points this is never going to happen - which again supports your point: it is not the content pixel for pixel but rather what and how you experience
---
Last time you played were brackets every 5 or 10?
---
Last bg I did (in BfA) I had xp unlock and was level 11. Was expecting to be grouped with level 14’s as in cats brackets were in 5’s.... rude awakening when I was grouped with 19 twinks who all had their xp locked.

Mining + Engenering for gold making would be 95% from Mining and max. 5% from Engenering.

Just mining is good, mix that with another proffecion if you want to make gold.

Did you get told to have sex with a close family member for not giving away the piece of gear that dropped?

WTF is this sorcery?

Ranged weapon from pre-raid bis to bis is: crossbow-bow-crossbow-crossbow. 
---
You get a good bow from MC. Next item is not until next to last boss in BWL. After that you will have to wait until Naxx.
---
It might take you a while to get the crossbow from BWL. So you might end up running a bow for a very long time.

Do you know where I can find this in a VOD? You can not summon people from outside the instance in vanilla.

So, i resubbed ( don't have BfA) just for the classic wow, just to find out i was not in for the test... I subbed  for test to.. is it still a thing? do i have any chance to get in the trial ? Or i better cancel the sub and wait to August ?

I remember reporting two idiots back in vanilla doing this, both was cursing fairly offensive stuff to boot.
---
GM replied to me on both occasions and informed me that this was "very not allowed" and would be looked into...
---
So....bannable or not, not entierly sure, but better not risk it...especially with frases such as "smellmyass"
---
Carefull with that one....you could easily get a temp ban for something like that...
---
Fun idea for WoW players, not so much for non-WoW players or who are not aware of the video.
---
I always though the translation for "LOL" was "KEK". Or does that only work for horde to alliance translation?
---
The night king in the books does not resemble the show version of the night king at all, if it was going to be something in the books he probably would've been introduced by now.
---
Seek help immediatly.
---
The solution for that would be that on RP servers you can keep the one trick ponies and on the other servers you allow dualspec. Then you keep the RP intact where people actually care for it and you can switch between specs on the servers where people gank and teabag you.
---
The thing is, there are two components to the game: pve and pvp. And the truth is, no one takes an arms warrior to raids and no one wants to play a prot warrior in pvp (except to troll or maybe some niche applications as flag carrier under certain circumstances).
---
Now, in your example, holy priest is still perfectly viable in pvp as it is in pve. So is shadowpriest. Most classes are actually.
---
So basically people are asking a special tax for certain classes while they themselves aren't affected by it and can keep playing both aspects of the game. What am i supposed to do as a raid tank on days where there is no raid? I farmed some nice gear and i want to use it. It's enough that the repair costs of my gear are probably a multiple of most people amd the same people still keep on insisting that i pay another at least 100g per week so i'll he able to do the same content as them? Especially since without anyone taking up the ungrateful tanking, those same people wouldn't be able to raid as well. Those same people who complain that there are not enough tanks in the game actually want to shaft the tanks even more. It's schizophrenic.
---
And the solution of those same people is that i roll another toon for pvp. Sure, ask the person to spend another 3 months leveling the hardest to level class in the same spec they already used to level the first time. And then how do i outfit him? Ah right, i get gear in raids... but wait... i'm still an arms warrior and no one will take me. Great solution.
---
So, tl,dr:
---
Dualspec for non-rp servers, keep respec costs in the game, everyone is happy except for hypocrits who aren't affected by the tax because their class/spec is valid for pvp and pve.
---
Gnome are bis in pvp since you can't fucking click on them in huge fights
---
The beta is pretty freaking dead. You run into that problem when there's a ton of players on the server, in this case not so much. This wasn't even a problem for Asmongold 1-30, so I don't see why it'd be a problem 30-40.
---
They're doing it cause it's the quickest xp, and there's content to be had participating in the capping race.
---
Well, the only endgame bow you should be using as hunter is Rhok'delar, which is quite easy to get its drop (the quests for the actual bow, though, may be a different thing, camping the demon mobs along all other hunters).
---
PvE I presume it won't be an issue. Hunters' damage isn't the reason why they are brought there. 
---
PvP might be different in the long run, since Ashjre'thul (xbow from Chromaggus, BWL) makes such a difference being so slow (compared to Rhok, which is faster -2.9 vs 3.4-), it helps a lot for getting some good burst done and to avoid clipping shots. It'll be a bit harder to stay with bow-only (since that xbow is so convenient) but I guess it'll be fine anyway.
---
Each layer in itself is a full standard server of about 3-3.5k. Its going to be very crowded in every starting area even with layering. Layering isn't meant to help with overcrowding, its usefulness is in that when the population dies down they can merge the layers into one server, thereby preventing low population dead servers.
---
Every starting zone is going to be a warzone of people spamming tab + instant cast tag spell to claim mobs.
---
Because thats your issue, you played TBC. In vanilla you went to the meeting stone ( which no one did for a reason you will soon read ) clicked it and it would put you in a LFG queue kind of similar to what it is on retail however it would throw anyone together, like 4 dps and a healer or 4 tanks and a healer just any sort of random combo no 3 dps/tank/healer. Once it had formed your group you would all run to the instance, It didn't become a summon stone for a while.
---
What's your channel? :)
---
If you want a smaller streamer, just search when the servers goes life. I bet there will be a toj if people streaming. Most bigger streamers give a wrong impression of how the game goes for the rest of us. Getting insane amounds of gold from vieuwers helps out so much you are playing a diffrent game.
---
There is no evidence of a white walker king in the books at all.
---
This wouldn't really solve anything. You know what would happen? The new meta would be waiting outside the dungeon instance and queuing for LFR and if you weren't, you'd be kicked for someone that was.
---
you will be able to clear everything using a bow.
---
Dude neat
---
oh man the compaq lappy. i played lots of wow on that bad boy. everything dialled back to 0
---
Kinda. Even still some post cata zone are better than the pre cata versions.
---
It's faster than the FP and since it's not going to far, you aren't waiting 5-10 minutes. It's also FREE!

you could always just fall on top of it or tie a noose and kneel down
---
Shut up, foo!
---
Hi, /u/TrueLoner
---
Well, these sets are still decent for physical classes (well, and ferals, who are interested in rogues' one), they fail for spellcasters since they get no +dmg or +heal, just raw stats. 
---
Their upgrades, though, are really nice, but they'll appear quite late.
---
Beautiful use of a beautiful meme.
---
Here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQCU36pkH7c
---
holy shit, i forgot about vote kick in retail... such bullshit
---
You're correct, but I think there's an argument to be made for grinding still, especially since your ways of making gold increase exponentially as you go up in levels.
---
There are no plans to rerelease anything after Classic but they are open to it if the demand is great enough.
---
Elchupa-nibre better be its name.
---
and it seems that currently only streamers get invites through F&amp;F fucking unfair garbage
---
Emerald Nightmare was far from what the Dream was described at you nut.
---
Could you link me one of those videos? Really interested on your take.
---
And you're arguing in bad faith too. Not trusting Blizzard, who have a long track record of bad decisions in WoW, to make the right changes a 1.13 would require isn't some dishonest argument to get TBC.
---
No he doesn't because it's bullshit, blizzard have actually vanilla server bad client for reference - they don't need dodgy pserver data that fucked with respawn rates to accommodate higher server caps.
---
This would be super dope! id stock pile it! For The Horde!
---
I always LOVED it when that one was spamed in /1 or /y instead of tradechat :P
---
Sure, I imagine there will be lots of mages around, in the capital city of the TAURENS.
---
\-Complains to people being toxic by being toxic.
---
Oh the irony.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Yeah, it's gonna be difficult, even with layering you're gonna be competing with hundreds of people in the start zones. All part of the fun, baby. Some people will do exploration/fedex, some will group and fight high level mobs, others have detailed plans to what to do and what to avoid, most will just fight the mobs around them and hope for the best.
---
How it should be.
---
*gets reported*
---
nah, if the item just says increases critical strike chance or hit chance, then it means for attacks, only if it says for spells will that apply to heals and the like.
---
Ninjadick is the only good one
---
I would suggest finding out what servers streamers are playing on and avoid them at all costs. Layering will only do so much. Instead of 200 in a starting zone you might only have 60 or so to contend with.
---
The Classes were by far better in TBC imo, Prot Warrior, Ele Shaman, Prot Paladin, Mages and Druids.. 
---
So many classes got made awesome.
---
Yeah I could use a good laugh at a group of people’s expense.
---
If you decide on NElf warrior do yourself a favor and roll female. You can thank me later.
---
I really agree with you mate
---
Yeah, and they had resources back when they released TBC, Wrath, and every other addition to WoW. Retail's problem has never been a lack of resources, Blizzard definitely has the means to make good content post classic but I'm not sure I trust them to make the right decisions.
---
I don't remember that ever working during the 2 years of vanilla, definitely not in 1.12.
---
What's the point of your reply?
---
This guy nearly had it right, get a G402 for half the price, amazing mouse and you don't need customisable weights for WoW. Take the extra money on a headset.
---
I personally recommend anything in the Steelseries Arctis range, all of them are good even the cheapest, obviously generally the more you spend the better they are. REALLY comfy to wear for long periods of time.
---
Does using an engineering item use trigger a gcd? Because there is none..
---
I don't, explanation please? I like the post because it is funny to see TB without any zeps but I didn't think there was anything else to it.
---
Why do you mean? I love thos BROOOAAAAD shoulders of the male :D
---
“basically, i think we can trust blizzard to do the right thing with classic if algorithms aren't the decisive factors of 1.13+ content;” 
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement and am hard pressed to find much Blizzard has done right in the last 5 or so years.
---
You can’t be upset about something without being toxic? I don’t get it. People overuse that word so much
---
A classic druid troll move is to root a chaser (not warlocks, though) underwater and let him drown.
---
I felt this in ma hart... Because i did resub just for classic Wow, only to find out i was not opted in for the stress test, and now i'm just sitting here, hoping for an invitation.. Already cancelled the subscription :))
---
&gt; I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement and am hard pressed to find much Blizzard has done right in the last 5 or so years.
---
because they haven't, it's all algorithms.
---
You're wrong, you get a quest in Org by the goblin engineers called Rig Wars, a goblin will then whisper to you by the door, giving you a quest. You then go to a goblin by a transporter to the left of the Inn in Booty bay, turn it in, then you have the transporter "rod" and can walk into the teleporter.
---
He's recreated the [Pablo Escobar Waiting meme](https://i.imgflip.com/2ll0sl.jpg)
---
I’ve been having the same issues, deciding between Warrior and ‘fill-in-class’... But I think that over all Warrior will be more rewarding in the end...
---
It’s tough! Good luck choosing.
---
Not sure if you mean literal queue times, but just to clarify no such thing as lfg in vanilla, so all about making connections with people. Tanks will be in short supply for dungeons both when levelling and at end game, but it might be harder to find a spot in a guild/raid potentially
---
Check out the stance with a shield.
---
You are 100% wrong here. Every single person needs to be attuned for Karazhan, SSC, TK, Hyjal, and Black Temple.
---
WE DONT WANT PEOPLE TO DEVELOP A NEW GAME - HALF OF THE REASON WE ARE EXCITED FOR CLASSIC IS KNOWING HOW HARD IT IS FOR THEM TO FUCK IT UP. 
---
i have no interest in WoW 1.5 or 2.5, I just want Vanilla / TBC warts and all.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s53K5Vc1VTw&amp;t=8s
---
No one can be this stupid right
---
Prove yourself to be a conscientious, crowd controlling communicative friendly patient Hunter and those tanks and healers will seek you out for dungeons.
---
&gt;  What if instead of a warlock they had another mage for more novas / aoe. 
---
You need the warlock to pull.
---
Yeah I miss the quality content we had before, such as "what happens after naxx" and "what spec should I play"
---
There aren't a lot of 2H weapons in AQ, except for maybe the dark edge of insanity. And this is where BRE starts to fall off.
---
Why no potions? Are engineering bombs allowed then? Makes no sense
---
Clip not available
---
Paladin bubble?
---
Heirloom twinks pffffffft
---
Why bother playing Classic if you're just gonna play it like retail?
---
Every expansion in order
---
Except there is lfg in vanilla. The first and shittiest iteration of such.
---
Oh my mistake yeah I was in agreement with you as well!
---
Just kind of rambling about what made classic so good and that it's not necessarily the "content" as it is the "old school" aspect that attract me.
---
Yeah lets split the community repeatedly until we kill the game. No way splitting us between 3+ expansions will fuck the playerbase respectively on each of those servers post launch each time. 
---
Listen, I get being afraid of the game evolving into something shit, but we aren't getting wow2, so its cool to like relive vanilla and tbc, but we could be apart of creating an mmo that is just like vanilla and has more content, something sustainable and enjoyable and not temporary for 1-2 years etc.
---
&gt; We made adjustments, finished the instance, and said goodbye as friends, because that's what WoW is supposed to be. 
---
i genuinely think Retail was ruined by people not understanding that this isn't TF2 or Overwatch or LoL. Things are not supposed to be exactly balanced and gameplay is supposed to be affected by social dynamics.
---
i like poopin :3
---
Yes, you reserve the name on all realm. But you can make 3 chars. So eigther 3 diffrent on the same realm or 3 the same on diffrent realms.
---
We need the server list to do it.
---
1.13 is the way to go not TBC
---
The best ones are in dead wind pass I grinded  a lot of 50-60 there.
---
Yeah lets go down the route of reducing raids to 25 man, reducing community, lfg, destroy azeroth world and keep going down the same path that ruined the game the first time instead of just taking a fucking chance. Way more sensible.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1qXY-cB8B4

Yes please
---
Asmongold world first scarlet armory on youtube, around 38 min in. If its a bug they dont mention it.
---
Patch 3.2 introduced XP locking and seperate queues.  
---
Patch 7.0 Removed XP separated queues, added stat templates.  
---
Patch 8.1.5 Adds the separate queues again now stat templates are gone.
---
Wound up googling it to save the hassle of trying to figure out when i stopped playing in BfA.
---
That's generally the life of a healer. People only notice when you screw up.
---
If you're doing your job right, they never really notice.
---
It's kinda sad. But hey, it's the job we sign up for!
---
They have knocked raids out of the park, and literally thats like 90% of what we are talking about when we say new content.
---
A cinematic trailer for each Phase would be awesome, but I doubt we'll see that due to how much time and cost Blizzard's CGI cinematics cost.
---
I do hope we get smaller trailers for each phase though.
---
their regen passive is unrelated to their max health, it just scales their total regen which is based on spirit and a base amount.
---
staysafe
---
Ah so it’s back in, meaning my bg was before it was added. Probably why it was put back in. No point queueing without it unless you’re a twink.
---
Unless you can make 170,000g (EU prices) in 30-45mins (the time it takes on average to earn £7.99 in a menial job) I don't think it's worth it
---
the war stomp in raids isn't crazy useful, but for sure in dungeons it can be.
---
Fuck no. I’d rather them rotate expacs then let Blizzard ‘create’ anything. Somehow you dont believe Classic+ wouldn’t fragment the playerbase either?
---
To be fair though that's because the map is literally designed in such a way that alliance has a geographical advantage since it's not a mirrored map.
---
Hunter is the fastest of your three to level. It's tough to say, but I would guess rogue would be a bit faster as their damage is more consistent. But paladins have incredible survivability. 
---
I think the main thing is which of the three do you see yourself putting the most time into? Does one of the classes speak to you in a deeper way than the others dont?
---
Totally agree, the cost would be a huge limiting factor. But man, I can dream!
---
i really want to see how the tauren racial +2 yards to hitbox will work for whirlwind and deadzone as a warrior
---
Classic Remastered would be Classic with retail graphics and models.
---
I then rage in chat about how toxic this shit is.
---
I then rage in chat.
---
***rage in chat.***
---
Glitch-cannot drink the bleach
---
Yeah I was thinking of just going to cold blood and figuring out from there or like you said more of a combat backstab build with imp sprint and relentless but you lose out on the ambush openers.
---
I'd personally really like BC and even WotLK. But they could make some changes to fix those expansions the second time around, even if it's just as simple as no lfr/lfd. I don't see any possible way they'd ever repeat cata or anything later again, because that's when we all left in the first place.
---
... or not caring about rep?
---
It doesn't show that I care about what you think at all, it shows that I care about there being accurate information in this post. You stating that accounts sold for max $500 is clearly nonsense and shows you shouldn't be speaking on something you have no knowledge of. In my case I sold my account to a mage from Nihilum who got banned and needed another equally geared mage to continue raiding or he would have lost his spot in the guild, but it was far from a one-off occurrence, it was actually set up by a friend of mine who sold his account for a similar amount through the same middleman. This middleman would headhunt valuable accounts to sell for large amounts to rich idiots like you said, and take a good commission on the deal.
---
Play what is fun or it's simply a chore
---
Try both out at launch or get on a pserver to just get a feel
---
Reminds me of a news story a couple of days ago in Norway - someone got plastic containers wrong and mixed detergent instead of slush into a machine, then a girl got sick from it.

---
News article in Norwegian.
---
Not really. Somewhat decent players will cc the healers as warriors by themselves pose close to zero threat
---
Male troll or female orc Hunter?
---
I wanna do both PvP and PvE, focusing mostly on PvP.
---
The bow animation on male trolls are awesome.
---
The orc racials are great for PvP.
---
I think you're the one who needs that luck if you think BRD is difficult.
---
My end result is unkown, it could be good it could be bad, it's a risk, but the payout is such a high reward that I feel it's a better choice than going down the for sure road of the same path that ruined the fucking game in the first place. I hate 25 man raids, I hate flying, I hate having portals to everything, I don't know how hard core vanilla enthusiasts can be so adament about a shit expansion that comes after classic that invalidates all of azeroth and changes tons of its mechanics. 
---
I'd rather eat ass than play TBC and Wotlk again (Lol wotlk, fucking spent 3 years in that game almost)
---
Why should we go down the same road that fucked us again, instead of taking a chance, just because we are afraid?
---
I mean you can play everything but 110-120 without it. Although you probably won’t enjoy any of it anyways.
---
https://youtu.be/f3T-HJvFs_Y
---
Some good insights here. 
---
TL;DW - Any half-decent mouse will do.
---
Orc has the BIS racial though.  If mages could be Orcs, I would 100% be an orc no question
---
Objectively, sure, but once you get into how BC drained azeroth of players or that flying mounts did a huge number on world pvp things get a little more shaky.
---
I personally prefer vanilla warrior for my own unique reasons.
---
what did I just watch
---
Note to myself for my Lock main: 
---
/dnd if you want a port to OG gather 2 more people BEFORE ASKING ME
---
Isn't this what Mythic dungeons already looks like, but is heavily considered just as toxic with people leaving after every pull.
---
I've been actively watching for this news for years. It's time.
---
Or we could wait for the game to release before we start talking about what we should do after it's over.
---

---
It was put back in because of stat templates being removed, for the entirety of legion twinking was basically dead due to stat templates so it's a good change IMO. Now there's scaling, but it's not significant enough to make a level 10 capable of killing a 19 twink like before.
---
Some edge lord may actually make one of these into a guild
---
And as one streamer said, if they cared about it they would invite more non streamers.
---
Streamers have to entertain their audience, hard to do that by testing stuff.
---
That's why TB is a mage kingdom. Everything is very close and little to none distractions from gold beggers.
---
I'm not opposed to this, but as others stated, we don't get much time after nax is released, if we don't choose early enough we could spend literal half year to a year waiting for content which is not something sexy if we're being real. Even if you want TBC to come, whatever side you're on, we need to have the conversation up front, latest time frame would be like the 4th phase? maybe? but this conversation really needs to happen.
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
Far out, not only will you be both competing for gear you'll also be stealing the gear of many other classes. I certainly wouldn't group with you both but good luck.
---
Id rather you fuck off with that mentality until i get to play Bc and LK - if they go on with Classic I guess we just miss out.. like I said before Blizzard hardly released anything of value since i’d say SC2. They really arent a good company anymore so i’d rather not let them take that risk. 
---
I will remain subbed for old content but if they mess with it and release new stuff im done, which would be sad cause i’ve been interested in legacy servers for years.
---
They never planned to release classic again, but money is money.
---
Once they see people getting invested into classic and they're hooked, then that's when you will start seeing very small microtransactions, then depending on the backlash, maybe even more.
---
They will milk people, they're good at it
---
What a dumb post
---
The community seems to be mostly split between three opinions:
---
**1.13 or Classic+**: Releasing new content while keeping the Vanilla design philosophy in mind.
---
**TBC**: Releasing a separate client/server for TBC some time after the last phase, allowing players to copy their characters to the new TBC servers while also keeping their Classic character intact and playable on purely Classic servers.
---
**Pure Classic**: Straight up Vanilla, no changes, no updates.
---
Kalimdors Revenge?
---
This is not possible. 
---
Vanilla is easy, the elites in dungeons are doing piss poor damage and the player today is much more skilled and informed.
---
/s
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
What kind of hot garbage is this?
---
Why the imp? It should not stack with the (stronger) priest buff or does it? And priest can just give it to all groups...
---
5 sword/mace skill is a racial.
---
More people need to know about Wheeliecool and Champ: Your raid has met its match.

My favourite Vanilla PvP video!
---
Even if any of what you said was correct, it still wouldn't be worth sacrificing the pros of single server queuing.
---
Ahh yes, good old puzzle to de activate the barrier, the summoning of the Spirit of Hakkar, the underground boss, the level 50 class quests.... That place was so awesome.
---
wingardium leviosa
---
Blizzard is not going to make a decision on how much to invest in Classic until it gauges how much money it's bringing in and how much staying power it has. There's going to be a wait after Naxx regardless and it'd be good to prepare yourself for that now.
---
One of the big differences is that they'll be one of the first people to hit 30 on their server, and won't have already done a shit ton of quests. Because there's so many people right now who are 30, it's a huge bottleneck and so dungeons are a much better option.
---
man i had many of these macros in vanilla but the only one i can remember is 
---
ai am D C P  (which is lo ve Y O U horde -&gt; alliance)
---
i said, "im only doing this because i care about you."
---
Revenge of the Windfury is my all time favorite https://youtu.be/DLrrXaTq1Yc
---
I'd imagine that that you can't proc the extra attacks while you're stuck during the bladestorm channel, while paladin seals seem like they might function differently. Also, IIRC they wound up slapping a tiny cooldown on Windfury at some point to stop windfurysplosion chains.
---
Damn I even played WotLK but can't remember this being added..
---
The BC iteration is the first thing you can call a LFG system, the system in classic should not be called a LFG system at all.
---
They are though. Probably five gamer dads with auto attack bound on 1 landed in one group.
---
Added in cata I think, probably for new Tauren players to help them a little bit to reach orgrimmar a littler faster and easier so they don't have to run through all the Barrens etc.
---
Isn't that the point of the beta, to find bugs?
---
Your kind disgusts me.
---

My 8 years old Lenovo Y570 runs it fine (i5 2520M, 8GB DDR3, GT555M 1GB). I was only able to try the stress test tho. If I clean this relic out I might be able to crank up the graphics too because currently I kinda overheat xD.
---
I'm sure you'll be fine waiting a few extra minutes
---
I'd like Nagrand, but that's it.
---
They were responsive to the massive amount of complaints in the bfa beta about classes feeling hollow without their artifact abilities and no new talents? They were responsive about several broken specs just not working without them?
---
I think Private Servers dont have it right because there's so many people it feels kind of disposable. 12000 player concurrent servers just are too big man.
---
There's also a lot of foreign players, the Chinese community in ND for example is huge and feels jarring when you cant speak to people because of language barriers, trying to do a quest and trying to talk to the Chinese guy to get an invite and he replies with a blank message, sucks ass. Classic will solve a lot of that.
---
Haha does anyone else ignore and dislike their partner and kids, fellow boomers? XD
---
Maybe but thats ok. But UBRS is 10 man in 1.12.
---
DD in general had it worse getting in groups especially they can't have low level like healer (always hitting). Play what you like, I am still in thinking, too (Mage / Warlock / Priest / Pala). Mage is really basic with low downsides but also less upsides. Over all, this game has a place for everyone.
---
Haha thanks, the song is not the only reason for my name though! ;)
---
That's not possible
---
Mistakes can be punishing.
---
Orcs are the best race for PvP, however if you can't stand them aesthetically you should roll something else instead of not liking your own character.
---
If the content was all harder with more people to coordinate you wouldn’t need it
---
Makes me sad that this site is exclusively for Vanilla. I would love to try and find some of my old Wrath/Cata friends too.
---
I'm not saying fuck those people, I just want those people to acknowledge that's what they want and quit using BS reasons for advocating for it. It's a legitimate reason alone and in itself to say you want to relive that experience.
---
If they wanted, hybrid specs were common.
---
Did you play BC and LK? Cause LFR was not in til 4.3/4.4 and LFD in its modern iteration didn’t come til 3.3 which was the ICC patch in LK..
---
Your complaining about something that came in the last 10% of the games lifespan.
---
That's a really fair point.
---
They are two completely different buffs, they stack.
---
I remember when I would level in my Hunter it was like Christmas when one of these dropped. No Mages would give me water for obvious reasons so I'd stock up on these for dungeons lol
---
That would be a Bug. Warlocks can't summon people from outside their Instance. Either the group needs to leave the Instance and summon the Hunter at the frontdoor or the Hunter has to enter the Instance and then gets summoned by the Group to where they are, skipping respawn.
---
Cover your shame healer

This, is probably the best description of the intent of layering I've seen posted on reddit.  Good job.
---
All that talk ON asmongold stream bout the chill lvling and dreamlike experience the world around rofl by rushing the fuck to 40
---
Male night elf shadow priest. Those words alone will send chills down peoples spines.
---
&gt; very expensive
---
If you don't grind some mobs for 4 hours every week anyway to get your raiding buffs and gold for respec....
---
Or possibly you could just type /em press space and write whatever you like in as an emote
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
OP, 
---
The polls accurately represent this specific target audience, but it is far from the actual truth.
---
People on this sub are largely influenced by knowledge on both what is strong and what is really needed in raids. Simply put: the average person on this sub knows more/has more interest in classic than the average of all classic players.
---
That being said: People here knows warlocks/priests/druids are underpicked and needed in raids, so they are biased towards picking it. But that doesn't mean its an accurate representation of how it will be. 
---
I think the 'safest' stats you can base your demographic on are pservers...
---
Drake dog, Laintime, Vurtne and who?
---
I made this [PVP music spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5lxT9KwO7tKObdOd5E3l85?si=IBZhZMQRTbKxvbNHrNFE5A). 90% songs from the Vurtne movies with a few more from other movies that I'm slowly adding.
---
Will take about 35-40 hours or more
---
The WoTF myth is ascending to new highs.
---
 First, people dont play warlock on alliance due to wotf. Now people dont play undead on horde because not many alliance people play warlock.
---
On point: play what you prefer. Mathematically hardiness will save your ass more times but you might not even notice. As a rogue you can trinket out of fear but from ZG phase onwards  you can "potion out" of stuns with living action potion.. so again, pick what you like.
---
Damn jabroni
---
Meeting stones were a looking for group system. The others were group finders.
---
Bis in pvp, not because they have small models but are slippery fuckers.
---
The most complex spec in PvE Setups is either a healing role with downranking - awarness etc.
---
Or a powershifting Feral Druid
---
They are implementing dual specs that will be available at 40. So that solves the problem.
---
So when naxx was out for a year ... you want to wait 2 more years for a rushed expansion instead of discussing now?

Murlocs were, are and will always be scary.

i belive the toxic nature of people just leaving and kicking early is on a systemic level that starts with LFR and LFG and ends with M+ and it's timers. while i think for a top end person the timer system is a good way to challange them the issue is how that trickles down to the rest of the player base it means that everybody even if it is just a mythic will want you to clear like it is a M+10

Undead Mage - Undead Warlock - Undead Rogue: 
---
My friends and I are going to play casually. They will go with Warrior and Hunter. I want a minimum time effort friendly class since i'm busy nowadays. Also something where i don't need to wait for group and raid spots. 
---
Mage sounds nice since the class has portals and the potential to AOE farm, so a lot of qol stuff. 
---
With warlock i like the class fantasy and all tier sets (looks are important ;) ). I believe the soulshards farming won't be as much as an issue as most think. Warlock pvp sounds more involved and i always had issues with complex pvp rotations in the past since i get nervous and forget all stuff. 
---
Rogue sounds nice since it can simply decide that it doesn't want to get ganked. I'm not sure if the melee rotation and mechanics are fun in pve.
---
Ideally the class should be also solid through tbc if it ever gets added.
---
I was also thinking about playing a healer but i wanted to mix things up and play a more active role - not reactive. (Warrior tank may not be my thing though)
---
I mained Hunter in classic - tbc and shaman healer from wotlk till bfa.
---
I hadn't seen that announced.
---
If you were dps yes. If you were heal then you needed to switch spec to the the weekly material farn, else you would run out of mana when 1 target is half hp and it would take an enernity to kill anything. I don't know about tank dps.
---
Relying on a subreddit for advice, when that subreddit has nothing but hate for said game
---
Are you really wanting advice? Play it and see if you like it, don't base your opinions off what you see here
---
I was constantly broke in vanilla. The best compromise you can do though is just to set your talent tree up to 2 things good, isntead of 1 thing perfectly.
---
My favorites are Champion Flames and Pope Muscle.  Thanks!
---
Do you have people playing on pservers atm or is everyone waiting in anticipation?
---
Swords was the name of my Warrior for a while.
---
Heals was my Pally.
---
Bank for my bank alt etc
---
Surprising that mage would be low. Ziqo and Venruki play mages. Venruki won the big dueling tournament the other day. I've seen a lot of love for mages in the chats.
---
Source? I'd be greatly surprised if they did this.
---
hey atleast they aren't sitting if the safty of there own faction city waiting like a lobby insted a mob might walk up and attack you.
---
Thats a long name
---
Male nelves can't use bows but they're fine as warriors.
---
Can always do quests at 60 for rep and increased gold rewards.
---
Sheep need a shepherd
---
Questing as the servers came up was nigh on impossible, everything was dead and over saturated (since everyone was 30 and on at the same time) - layering also has some areas bugged (you can kill mobs there once, but they never respawn).
---
So for the streamers (and others) that wanted to get to 40 quick, instance spam was the only 'sane' option. Pretty sure Asmon tried questing for half an hour or so before giving up.
---
Behavioural Inhibition System.
---
So the whole Warlock cult in each capital city makes sense now?
---
Would be funny if every Warlock on the server gets around there,meet and they plan their dispute.
---
Darkshore is pretty dope. A lot of running when you get to the last of the quests but, great place overall.
---
Fantastic.
---
I still hope that somewhere somehow Blizzard might implement ignoring the whole account at once. It'll save so much of ignore space!
---
They also had neat plans about housing, hero classes and siege weapons at the start of vanilla. Would be cool if they look up old concepts and plans for classic. 
---
Ofc not as prio 1,  they can go with original content for the first 2 years.
---
The Okay button under server is down is so miserable looking haha.
---
Just dont play arcane...
---
Back in vanilla as horde the DPS warriors were usually limited by threat more than anything and it'll probably be similar again. 
---
Alliance warriors will probably be able to go all out and top meters once they get the gear though.
---
I’d rather listen to the game OST thanks tho
---
I see it now
---
I bought game time only and got into the stress test with a miracle...which they proceeded to strip away recently.. So yeah, bamboozled. Can't even look forward to the stress test nolifing during my holiday because I doubt I will be reinvited..
---
If I knew that stress test would be a one time invite thing I wouldn't even have bothered with it. I tought I'd be in all of them if I got invited once.
---
It does stack with all other hp buffs. Usually one warlock will use imp in tank group Improved Imp talent.
---
&gt; Sure, I imagine there will be lots of mages around, in the capital city of the TAUREN.
---
ayy lmao

If they start fixing old school exploits though, that's a slippery slope away from vanilla classic wow though. Personally I'd prefer they didn't go down that road.
---
&gt; cleared within hours of release
---
Do you even Naxx?
---
If I remember he paid something like 7k USD
---
Thr original epic mounts and AV are my two main concerns with classic ATM. Both should be preserved for the same reason the game is. With progressive content there is no good reason to leave the mounts out.
---
DHKs is a bit more complicated since they have to go against the way the game was to change that.
---
I remember killing Whitemane on live before she got the ress up and we didn't get any loot from Mograine. It was the Pre-TBC patch with a group of 40s.
---
So I think this was actually possible on live and not some new classic beta-bug.
---
Another Karma grab post about recovering an account, heirlooms definitely had a hand in the decline of twinking
---
Because he's lying.
---
Doubt it and I haven't seen anything official on this either.
---
There's no source and I'm sure you know why.
---
Raids were content played by 10% at most in classic. Nax was completed by 1%. Not relevant for barely anyone.
---
I am Pleased
---
if you haven't played BFA yet (or retail) for quite sometime, then yes. if you already have a 120 and you're asking if it's worth it to play BFA until Classic... that's up to you.
---
tbh, i did have fun leveling in BFA and doing the dungeons, it's just when i reached level cap that i was... less then enthusiastic.
---
On the internet? No!
---
Yea if you killed it too quick it bugged and you didn't get loot, so this is nothing new
---
Beasts in desolace are great for grinding through those levels too!
---
[Good group](https://i.imgur.com/3db8wHn.gif)
---
MoP is amazing though. So is Legion.
---
Not better than Classic, they are mostly different games, but solid expansions. Especially suprised by MoP, because that was looking worse than cata.
---
The more intense players I knew somewhat regularly respecced when they had 3+ days to do straight PVP or farming. Most players just kept a hybrid spec or dealt with being marginal at something. 
---
I played a Fire Mage in raid spec and that was actually pretty good in group PVP so I mostly aimed for Alterac Valley to get my honor points and ranks. Otherwise I'd respec into a PvP spec maybe once or twice a month.
---
The only thing that makes me question my choice of rolling horde : [https://barrens.chat/images/tier/armorset\_nightelf-female-priest-t3.jpg](https://barrens.chat/images/tier/armorset_nightelf-female-priest-t3.jpg)
---
Crendor's, like many other people, is living in la-la land, thinking that Retail WoW can remove any QoL's without massive backlash from their drone players. Remember when they removed portals, in 8.1? Jesus, the reactions from the retail players...
---
Removing MORE QoL's, in order to make Retail more like Classic, will led to a massive dropout from the retail players.
---
Just imagine, for a second, that Blizzard is announcing the removal of teleport option for LFR...
---
Retail WoW is DESIGNED as a SINGLE PLAYER game, that MUST provide as many QoL's as possible, to have even someone that can only play 30 min / day doing SOMETHING that rewards EPICS, keeping them PAYING for the game.
---
It's the mobile gaming mentality, apply to a PC game. Ofc it failed, and the BfA player base is 1.3-1.5 million today (and that is clear after latest monthly report from ...YET, generating cash (through mtx) comparable to a 3 million sub player base.
---
Preach was absolutely right : Blizzard will make Retail more and more like a mobile phone, for a certain type of players (thus, leading to Retail becoming a fringe MMO, and ultimately making it an exclusive mobile game), and Classic WoW for the MMORPG players.
---
Even assuming that Blizzard will remove the teleport from LFD and LFR...would this alone make Retail more appealing to the MMORPG player? Not even in the slightest. 
---
They will have to remove A LOT more, for Retail to be an actual MMORPG...and they won't do it, because they will lose the "modern" player and won't gain any MMORPG players, because there is Classic WoW for them as a MUCH better option.
---
I mean, ZG was 20 Man and awesome.
---
You can share an account with a child or a parent, you're a little dense for assuming they base much off IPs when they could live in different places.
---
I've been using Vpns to play wow and switching them for a very long time, due to work.
---
double post
---
&gt; fellow boomers? XD
---
Gen X mate, no boomers here ;)
---
this argument still assumes that duels must be a mirror of WPvP rather than a separate test of skill... if arena were in classic would you say it's nonsense because it doesn't reflect WPvP?
---
Shit yes one of my favs, also azgaz nerf druids series
---
&gt; How did they get all that footage to make that?
---
**He** (it's really only one guy) took WoW assets and animated them in an offline renderer (I think he said Maya?). So he made the footage himself.
---
I mean, yeah: more dongers. I guess.
---
This was unexpected.
---
Over half of them are in org/IF or in an instance.
---
Impossible!
---
This
---
There definitely is some, [Blademaster Telaamon](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blademaster_Telaamon#Trivia) springs to mind.
---
They do mention it! I just watched it. At around 42min they finally summon Themechanic and someone mentions you aren't supposed to be able to and I think it is Esfand who says "you can in the beta." That would be a feature provided by being on a BfA/Retail client engine of WoW.
---
They just need to also add new PvP rewards to not force every pvper to go raiding. And changes in pvp balance are part of an mmo.
---
What the hell have streamers to do with it? 
---
If one layer is the pop of 3k players, no streamer with like 100 people following him will make a difference
---
It certainly is inconvenient but it is still useful. It's probably a technical limitation they didn't change until later expansions.
---
That's not how it works. The Classic team (including Omar) are programmers. Have you seen any designers/graphic artists in any of the interviews?
---
Most of the original creative minds behind Vanilla have left. You will never ever get anything resembling Vanilla from Blizzard ever again.
---
Ok, thanks for letting me know! I didn't know that. : )
---
But not everything that was available in the patch 1.12 is in the first phase. You do realize that?
---
When you are kicked from a group because you wanted to stop for a bit and get a quest...raging is the only NORMAL reaction.
---
I would have raged as well, seeing where my beloved game had become, because those 3 idiots that kicked him are representative for the vast majority of retail player base, those who asked for a gazillion QoLs (read "features for lazy people").
---
"purely play PvE" Not a thing in classic. You dont raid every week on a schedule, for gear to be stronger for next weeks scheduled raid. You raid to be stronger for killing other players!
---
just saying in classic i had a level 50 ally warrior and a 60 horde warrior. leveling is what i am going to enjoy most of and that means i will do both sides.
---
Since your friends are going warrior and hunter then i'd say dont go rogue to avoid competing for gear.
---
Mage is for sure the best time effort friendly class. Lots of qol stuff (CC, food, portals). They are solid DPS thro vanilla and tbc. Pretty simple and straight forward class.
---
Warlocks in vanilla are utility (soulstones, healthstones, summons, curses) but pretty low dmg overall tho they become top DPS in tbc. A bit better leveling than mages thanks to their Demons. Also free mount at 40! Plus some of the best class quest chains.  But don't understimate soul shards. It is a pain and you'll spend a lot of your time at 60 farming them. I'd say it's even worse than hunters arrows and food (for pets) since those can be bought at least.
---
Yeah, the first week out of about 104 weeks of the expansions existence. Even LFR is more relevant than heroic dungeons 99% of the time.
---
Oh good lord. I actually laughed out loud. Such classic humour. ;)
---
Sounds like the other players were terrible if they managed to wipe in a levelling dungeon just because you hadn’t played for a while
---
If the legion engine supports it, then I would assume Classic does.
---
If it doesn’t, I can’t see why they would dedicate development to supporting it but not retail.
---
AKA it doesn’t matter what you pick
---
They are talking about something about unlocking the boss room while in spirit form, not the summon.
---
Because some people liked vanilla for things other than levelling.
---
Mained Hunter and you are spot on - relevant to pvp and pve and it is just a fun class. Easyish to play hard to master
---
Chinese are also known hackers and exploiters and do not give AF on private servers. Cheating is popular in Chinese culture. I’m happy I can finally play on a server where the Chinese players don’t control everything.
---
If you're playing Arcane your Mage will be weak in general.
---
They are some of the original programmers. Omar worked on Vanilla (don't know about the others).
---
But that's what they are, programmers. Not designers or graphic artists. The Classic team is small and specialized. It's not a normal game developer team. It can't create anything new for the game. But people don't seem or want to recognize this.
---
After years of playing, I still cannot for the life of me find a goddamn thing, even tho I usually go to Thunderbluff when I need to visit a city. Hunters rise? Didnt I just come from there? Where the FUCK is that auctionhouse? etc
---
I am deciding to role either mage or warlock as well. Dps and CC wise (pvp, raids etc) mages are superior in general, however leveling is faster and more convenient as warlock with lifetaps (imo). From my experience on pservers, as a casual, you can't go wrong with either choice, however mage is probably the safest choice and better in your 3 man premade group.
---
At the first few hours of the beta there weren't that many people invited yet, and they were spread out across the friendly starter zones. It allowed people to get an early head start and avoid the zerg. For 30-40, there were more people invited on the server, all at 30 already, all packed into a small amount of eligible ~30-32 contested zones.
---
Of course it's a bigger problem at 30-40.
---
The thing is ... they don't need to be the biggest.  They just need whatever population makes for a healthy experience and earns enough cash to keep the company going.  I am not expecting the type of game I like to be a blockbuster hit.  I am just hoping for my own personal EVE (which could be considered a non-standard MMORPG maybe?).  
---
For me my current hope is in Pantheon.  WoW classic/TBC will tide me over until it releases.  I want a game that goes back to that old school EQ group dynamic.  Larger group size so you have room for those pure utility classes not just the trinity seen in modern MMOs.  The game being designed around grouping almost entirely, with little to no solo/raid content.  I don't expect it to be a hit or even popular, I just hope it makes it to a successful launch and I can have fun playing it.  Other MMORPGs in the pipeline that may be non-standard (but I don't follow them closely at all) would be Camelot/Crowfall since they have a bit more PvP focus.
---
I called all of these already. 
---
*tightens blackbelt*
---
Why wife would do the same, except subtract ten years. Yeah, I'm not going to be playing much...
---
I've not seen anything official or played the Beta but it seems like a safe bet. Classic is effectively running the same code as modern Wow but with data from vanilla, so engine level support will be much the same. 
---
Of the two, DX12 support is less likely but if modern wow supports DX12 (I haven't played in years, so not sure) then it's likely classic will too. At the very least it'll be DX11.
---
You absolutely can criticize someone for doing something that you are also doing, that thing doesn't stop being wrong. It is not a valid defense to point out that someone else is also doing it, hence the fallacy.
---
thing is, leveling up in retail, bags dont matter much anyways. Potions and bandages are not needed and alot of quests items are not physical. so its mostly random items that are mostly vendored anyways and perhaps the random dungeon reward bag you'll be worrying about, rest can just be auto vendored with an addon... Vanilla seems so much better.
---
Totems
---
What do you mean?
---
NPCs referring to your character by name? That never went away.
---
NPCs speaking? Absolutely not.
---
This exact line? Probably; the zone was remade in Cataclysm along with most vanilla zones.
---
The BOOTYSWAG? That never left you, and never will.
---
With Spikes!
---
It's a double edged sword for me.
---
I loved the heroic dungeons in tbc, they were very challenging, but well ,they oculd have also just been the normal version. I hated heroic dungeons in wotlk, as they were so easy. I don't think I ever ran a normal lvl 80 dungeon, just straight to heroic and easily breezed through.
---
The difficulty modifiers implemetned into the encounter itself, e.g. Ulduar is an excellent method though, but I also hated the raids as 10 and 25 man version in wotlk.
---
If done right, i.e. Ulduar style, different difficulties can be a fine thing.
---
Raiders represent the players who will actually stay in a game after the content has been eaten (referring to questing zones etc), every new raid in vanilla had a questline, attunement, and epic rewards you could get through questing and doing collections of currency if you were persistent enough. There's plenty of content for non raiders and raiders alike. 
---
Also you're citing stats that are ancient, but its also difficult to know how many people enter raids now without counting LFR.
---
auction"house" :)
---
&gt; My fear is that kid Randy’s will see that as a legitimate strat in pugs and will bitch and rage in group when things don’t go their way. 
---
And this is exactly what will happen with most Twitch users watching a group of 5 pro players, and thinking that "this shit is easy". Not to mention that everyone is saying that elite mobs do very low damage.
---
And they also live with the impression that a 15 year old game must be easy AF...because the player today is much more skilled. They aren't more skilled, they only think that they are.
---
Going to be fun reading the retailers rage-quit in /2.
---
Yeah. I quit some time during cata maybe my memory isn't perfect on time lines of when stuff came in, but that was the first complaint that came to mind that would be easy to change.  There are plenty of other things that could be done to improve those those expansions, so don't get super worked up over my poor example.
---
I'm just saying those servers will be oversaturated. I'm sure streamers like Asmondung will bring more than 100 sheep.
---
You'll end up at the point where you just don't have time.
---
If there is anything still good in retail its the raids anyway.
---
They're just a meme since their racials are just straight up worse than any other of the alliance races. Gnomes got escape artist which makes them able to dispell slows and roots which is huge for warriors in PvP. Humans got weapon skill which makes them better at hitting bosses and hits them slightly harder. Dwarfs got stoneskin which dispells poisons, blind-effects AND increases your armor by 10%. The nelfs got a 1% dodge that might look good but doesn't stand a chance compared to the other races.
---
&gt;In vanilla all the dungeons are hard, need skill and CC, you can't just pull entire dungeon!1!11!
---
Since you started reading it, 5m have passed. Those are 5m less that you have to wait for August 27th... You're welcome.
---
We used to do them on off days, they were treated like dungeons practically during vanilla. The meat of raid days were always 40mans.
---
Pornography. Are you 12?
---
this person is wrong.
---
regular weebs will remain though.

fk your authentic experience in terms of population size on a server. 
---
i bet you shit ton of money there is great amount of people who prefer more than 2-3k people on server. 
---
maybe not 10...but fk 2-3k honestly.
---
Seing a raid decked player standing around was one of the best carrots dangling in front of your face.
---
In a vacuum yes. But lets not pretend that there arent any solutions. Even during vanilla they changed items to make them better and introduced catch up raids and dungeons. They could do more of those and improve the items. Just slap some armor and stamina on 'older' items.
---
Thanks for sending me down that rabbit whole haha
---
It's so that new players can go from OG to TB (or vice versa) without having to walk there the first time.
---
And tons if grass
---
Dont forget dailies. Im sure everyone loves to come home and do the same shit every day. Bonuspoints if you have alts.
---
Yep. You got to be fast. And be ready to use consumes and eat/drink even for 5 seconds, if possible. Ofc , this is for fresh players, that will be quite undergeared.
---
Probably not but you don‘t need to have ogri flightpath to use it (:
---
You can't be serious...they added fucking ROPES ?
---
Same 😂
---
&gt; I mean if were being pedantic
---
No, OP is just being proven wrong.
---
"True spirit of WoW is RPG" yeah nothing says RPG like killing the same plot-critical entities fifty times over and over for loot.
---
Yep. Thank God.
---
So true, unless you found that unicorn hunter that actually knew how to play in a group. They could be a great asset, but oh boy could they ruin your day.
---
Not exactly true, u need chilling and improved blizzard which is unavailable at 20 iirc. Also 26 is game changer as u get cone of cold which saves your failed pulls.
---
It's true this has been confirmed
---
yeah me2, but have to say Pfui is really good
---
I am pretty sure that they are working on something, to promote both twitch and the addons itself.
---
Nothing confirmed though
---
Nice.
---
&gt; will all be gone by the third month.  
---
Most will be gone by day 3. The rest by week 3.
---
Who can last more than that will become "ONE OF US".
---
Agree.
---
Undead is superior for PvP
---
Orc and Troll for PvE
---
Tauren if you just want to be big and bulky.
---
I'd go warrior if endgame and finding groups appeals to you more than having a pet.
---
Blue pill and red pill, which would you want?
---
YES! I remembered Team Ice and Blood Legion. Good guilds, but I might be on the other side of that battle, i remember running into horde waiting for us to go into BRM from Loch Modan
---
wasn't there a rep penalty for low lvl quests, or is that just for mobs?
---
I actually think low level dungeons would be a wonderful thing. So many people are convinced that adding new content will suck as it'll make Naxx and whatnot obsolete, but there's nothing wrong with just adding low level content that people can play on their alts or whatnot. OSRS did this for a lot of their skills.
---
Yeah they're also implementing cross realm sharding and lfr
---
Going to be a irl engineer soon. I can prove it, in wow engineering is different than irl.
---
I'm so torn! On the other hand TBC was my favourite class design wise (I'll miss prot pala the most on vanilla &lt;/3) but I would love them to take the game to an alternate path with post-Naxxramas. Vanilla did so many things right and I would love them to stay true to similar design philosophy. I want things to *matter,* which is something Vanilla did so well. 
---
Post-Naxx gives so many options though, and Blizzard could even try to use and rehash assets they already have to create something new in the old. I would love to see Hyjal in Vanilla with a proper Barrow Dens dungeon or a small raid. Alternate vision for Karazhan and/or Karazhan Crypts would be amazing as well, so would be Gilneas. As long as they stick to the old design philosophy and old philosophy of the game.
---
Alliance or Horde? 
---
I have always been an Alliance player in retail. I'm going to play classic with one of my best mates and he really wants me to play Horde. I have been planning on playing a tauren shaman to level with him and I'm super excited about the character, but I'm just not so sure about the faction.
---
I'm afraid that I'll just be missing the feel and look of the Alliance zones &amp; cities which I came to love so much over the years.
---
I was thinking that I might roll an Alliance toon to level in my own time, but then I'm afraid that playing two different factions on two separate realms (since we/I want to play on PVP realms) might divide my attention between communities too much.
---
Has anyone ever been in a sort of similar situation or does anyone have any advice?
---
Don't see a guild Recruitment sticky on the subreddit
---
Male nelves can't use bows???
---
 Well I know where all the dungeons and raids are on retail and bfa so it may not be retails fault you don't know.
---
0/30/21 or 1/29/21 are considered the "go-to" flexible spec for druids. Capable enough to heal (not hardcore) and good in PVP and solo pve.
---
if tape has all these advantages why arent they used in consumer setups?
---
&gt; A huge portion of the community is pretty vile. 
---
We are...but with who? 
---
Retail mindless players. You can't be civil with people that shat on your game for years...and they STILL do it.
---
Worry not, once the waters settle (3-4 weeks) the only players that will remain will be the ones who will understand what Classic is.
---
And the community will be as strong as before.
---
Ofc, there will ALWAYS be idiots here and there...but that is an exception, not the rule.
---
Does this really work? Sorry if the question is stupid but idk. Maybe druid are beasts for real and not counted as players in classic
---
I will forever love Perkulators old rogue videos, my absolute go to for classic pvp.
---
Same with my Druid during stress test...
---
Those servers will have more layers. Saturation will be the same @ ~3k per layer.
---
I lost everything. All of my screenshots were gone when my dad reformatted the computer back in like BC, and the few I had uploaded on Photobucket and I'm pretty sure those got wiped out a while ago.
---
Well, isn't the player today much more informed? I see this mantra all day long since Classic was announced.
---
So, they should inform themselves about the game.
---
If they don't, I don't care if it will be to late for them.
---
Their fault.
---
Tbh combat might be better with how strong the swords are from SM and RFD.
---
Classic will run on the legion client, not the old one from 2004
---
It's not that its retails fault, it's that I can do the dungeons without having to travel there and put in the effort, I can just queue and it ports me there. In classic you have to know where they are to get them done.
---
It isn't about PvP for me. I think flying fucked up the atmosphere and gave them the opportunity to be lazy about area design.
---
I believe this is the ONLY way for low lvl taurens to reach orgrimmar, since the road to barrens is now blocked by wall. Also, i could be wrong, but i think there is no straightforward path from southern to northern barrens anymore.
---
Lets be honest here. We want classic to be over with asap and get to the real expansions sooner (tbc, wotlk).
---
You want some I’ll give it ya
---
No. In retail any real use of dungeons requires manually forming groups and running there. You can get summoned to the entrance but you can do that in classic too.
---
Blood fury is only melee attack power.
---
dude i can't wait to fish....i loved fishing in vanilla.
---
Errors are normal. The issues is how errors are handeled. The devs should have redone the encounter after they realized how people were doing it.
---
Amazing so let's have them do it again
---
I remember telling myself when the beta launched, "sucks for the few people that end up getting an epic world drop only for it to be wiped come launch."
---
Still cool though. Hand that bad boy over to Snutz or Venruki for max beta fun times.
---
Vanilla WoW isn't built for servers to have 7.5k-10k people playing at once. Private servers manage it by allowing dynamic respawn times to ramp up massively, but it makes the game really weird to play when it's  sea of players fighting over mobs spawning like crazy. One moment you are picking off the lone mob here and there with no concern about dying, then suddenly a few people leave the immediate area and you are faced with 5-6+ mobs spawning on top of you. But don't worry, by the time you corpse run back, even more players have starting camping the area and it's back to killing lone mobs as they spawn with little concern for dying.
---
Then you have issues where multiple groups are camping mini-boss quest mobs and other similar situations.
---
Sure, finding groups for instances/raids is easier, but it's at the expense of everything that's non-instanced in the game.
---
so you are telling me everything went to sht when Metzen came along?? :((((((
---
Theres a difference between fixing bugs, and redesigning entire specs/classes when theres 4 months till release.
---
As if Americans never broadcasted everything going on in their life XD
---
Relax im joking
---
https://youtu.be/5frS6BjaiD8?t=158
---
Maybe?
---
What do you mean any real use?
---
I wish these were released in the UK or if they were, were very limited!
---
Maybe they can release them in the UK this time haha
---
pretty much, actually.
---
me not that kind of orc!
---
Except there were constant complaints throughout the entire beta and barely a word from them. It was blizzards idea to take away our abilities and make specs designed around them hollow shells.
---
I know I'm a bit too late for this LFG Monday but still
---
Looking for a EU casual raiding guild preferably on a PvP server. I'm a 23 yo male from Russia planning to roll a shaman (but I'm also okay with playing as a warrior or a warlock). I'm okay to be convinced to roll as Alliance because why not?
---
I started playing in 2009 as an orc shaman. My raiding experience is pretty much limited to clearing ToC and ICC 25 man normal but I enjoyed it very much. After the WotLK the game wasn't the same for me anymore.
---
I previously played on Russian servers but this time I want to experience a true multi-cultural gaming. So I'd like to find an English-speaking guild with more or less mature players. Socializing, normal pace leveling and eventually raiding is what I basically need.
---
Timezones are a bit tricky so the earlier - the better but I'm okay with 19:00-23:00 CEST.
---
Please add me on Discord even if you aren't a recruiter but want to find the same multi-cultural gaming experience: AndreyP#8084
---
Lol sounds epic
---
Ban Bleach !
---
Gross
---
Different tools for different jobs. They're not made for general purpose computing, i.e frequently reading and writing data. They're made for data storage.  
---
Relative to hard drives, tapes are not practical because they are slower at general purpose consumer tasks.
---
Yep that was confirmed also class balancing for pvp
---
Likely. They are lagging behind the current client somewhat but probably don't want to merge the bleeding edge just yet.
---
But even without DX12, Classic is lightweight enough that a Ryzen 1700 should max out your monitor even in raids.
---
Strange but good to know
---
Is it not only for mythic that you create a group manually?
---
Some people just like servers packed with people, I know nostalrius wasn't blizzlike, but I really loved seeing tons of players everywhere, plus at blizzlike population eventually down the line it becomes very difficult to find groups for lower level dungeons and elite quests in the world.
---
Do only streamers get to reserve a name or everyone lol
---
Thats the combat text we want, not that horrid one currently being used...
---
If you need mobs to grind as a Warrior/Rogue Humanoid Casters OR Whelps of any kind.
---
Whelps die very quickly to melee and have the best loot table in the game.
---
Yeah ! Awesome!! That's the spirit and the real classic feeling. I've been waiting for this since BC. Finally getting my max distance for enemy Nameplates back!
---
you need addons for that, thats vanilla
---
On a server of 3000 people, only 1500 in your faction and you'd want more than 50 ignore? The problem might comes from you don't you think.
---
So retail has what is basically a tour mode for all their content and that doesn't require you to enter the instance manually. The tour mode is basically an easy mode that allows people to see content without putting in any effort.
---
Would rather give it to Xaryu since he’s better
---
Imo they are good, but I would preferr a slower and more Blizz CGI one
---
I think there are still some animals left alive in our oceans so a few more pieces of consumer shit in plastic bottles really is what we all need.
---
They aren't summoning stones. They're meeting stones. Just an in fame marker for saying "Hey, there's a dungeon here."
---
You could right click on them and be put in a queue with others who right click on them and then a group would be formed, granted enough people joined the queue.
---
They did not summon in vanilla.
---
Do both.
---
That's what I plan on doing.
---
I have mained a hunter my whole wow career. It's safe, familiar, and will always be there when I feel like grinding. Does everything well, not great. Quite possibly one of the most immersive classes in the game due to the rp factor. Finding a group will still be easy with a bit of manners and skill.
---
I've tanked. And plan on it this time around as well. But I want to sneak in the back door. I'd like guilds to find their main tanks early on so I can take my time with the warrior and not have many expectations set by my peers.
---
There is something to be said about having access to some of the most fabled gear in the game. I'd like to slowly work on it however. Really enjoy the little things I never got to experience before. On a long enough timeline you can do it all.
---
And for what its worth, I'll have a dwarf and a human. Humans are op. And the dwarf was my first.
---
Cheers
---
Just hope there are enough servers to avoid any major streamers in EU
---
Anything on combat text?
---
https://discordapp.com/invite/2r25M8Z
---
Hybrid specs were common. Lieing was also common (Source: completed molten core as a fire mage spamming frostbolt in 2004).
---
MOST people I met stayed in the spec they used the most. We had a lot of arms warriors in our MC groups for example.
---
WIth that i just meant sitting in og or stormwing and spamming lfg haha
---
Human Mage, Human Warlock or a Night Elf Hunter?
---
I'll be duo-leveling a paladin with my wife, but I'm planning on playing on another character when we can't play together but I still want to play. It's not about being in a hurry or stuff, just getting rested levels on another char. If I later need to reroll or want to roll another character, at least I'd have one *at somewhere* instead of starting from zero. 
---
I'm having hard time deciding which character I'd like it to be, a DD for sure but... I love hunter gameplay in Vanilla, it's imo the best hunter has ever been in the game. Hunters aren't that needed in raids though and I'm pretty sure there'll be quite a few of them max level. Mages have some pretty fun and interesting things between the lines and I think I'd like a vanilla mage. I started playing a mage properly in Wrath myself. Also you need several mages but mage will be probably the most common class at max level anyways. Warlocks seem pretty interesting, but I have no touch on them before Cata and I have no clue if I'd enjoy playing one or not. They have the best chance of getting into raid groups though out of these three. That all is, if I'm going to raid on any other character than my pala.
---
Well at least I can get the stand now...
---
Can confirm this axe was amazing with command - we actually went back to farm SM for this to win the war event in ZF because we had no aoe besides me with that axe lol
---
Vanilla world is honestly pretty big, after a certain point when most people are 60, leveling zones feel dead at 2.5k pop, killing chances to do stuff like elite quests in the world.
---
Well it isnt all rainbow and shine here because the playerbase has changed since 15 years ago.
---
You put a fortnite player in a dungeon that takes maybe 2 hours to complete and you wipe a few times, how much you think that person cares about staying.
---
I hope that ppl will realize that this is what makes the game feel so rewarding but i also expect a lot of newer players simply not getting this.
---
yea pretty obvious from the duel tournament
---
Don't worry someone will backport gearscore to classic, so you can not get invited to dungeons because you don't have enough gearscored due to not having the items from that dungeon.
---
Ya but mythic is basically the normal basic difficulty in retail. You can do it with all greens on.
---
People need something to cry about, don't you take that from them!
---
I would take level 30 duel tournaments with a grain of salt
---
New WoW isn't all bad, I fucking loved Legion. It seems that with BfA though they just went all-in on the bad parts of modern WoW.
---
I wouldn't  say clearly exists, but the book does mention 'the others' who have motifs, actions and powers. Presumably 'the others' must have a leader 🤷‍♂️
---
As a Mage I am a big fan of knocking them down to 5% health then polymorphing, kissing and walking away to assert my dominance.
---
Hyjal wasn't hard at all.  Hardest thing about it was being bored through waiting for all the waves so you could finally kill the bosses.  Due to having to repeat all the waves if you wiped on the boss the bosses were generally easier (first kill usually within a few attempts).  Archimonde only took slightly longer and that was because some people in our guild were terrible at using the clicky.
---
Duel tournies with so many rules don't mean shit. Anything that doesn't replicate open world pvp doesn't prove anything.
---
"Rogues get the opener" and "warriors get the charge" bullshit.
---
&gt;The best part of not having a LFG system
---
What I am wondering since quite some time now: Why the fuck are people complaining about the LFG system when it actually is a matchmaking system? A proper LFG tool (Akin to the one for M+ in BfA) would be quite nice ...
---
Exactly
---
Very well done meme...the subtitles perfectly fit his behaviour, excellent meme!
---
I hope that most guilds will be run by "old timers" that knows things dont come instantly in this game.
---
So since you're not forced to do something, that is bad?
---
I mean, I get it, people think if it's less time consuming it's easier.
---
This is awesome, me and a buddy use to sit in vent and type stuff back to one another in game, trying to come up with insults.
---
You can summon people from outside the instance into the instance. [video of this happening](https://youtu.be/44BlKx7N1pE?t=2325)
---
This was not possible during vanilla. It was added in TBC Patch:
---
 2.4.0 (2008-03-25): Can be used to summon players into instances if they meet the instance requirements. 
---
[Patch notes for ritual of summoning](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ritual_of_Summoning#Patch_changes)
---
Your the tosser for reporting them
---
Thanks I'm not sure if an encyclopedia will keep my interest since I actually prefer novels. But I'll give it a shot.
---
Yeah adrenaline rush is really strong too.
---
[here's](https://imgur.com/a/k7mHhxB) a couple I found on an old hard drive
---
I hate how he says "maybe we should report that one" - yeah man, report it! Do your job.
---
The badges mainly assisted with the bad drop % so you could afford something for any slot - hardly like you got an item a week. I saw half of BT and it just wasnt easy to gear up in 25 man instances; but you could get to t4 equivalent with the guilds B team raids so that you could at least step foot in. i loved it
---
I think you have to put these rules in to get the duels started in a timely manner. Without letting the rogue get the opener it’s a 2 min game of how can he sneak in. With warriors getting the charge off they still lose to everyone, so it doesn’t matter.
---
The +X skill in profession has many use. During leveling can loot higher level plant sooner; gnome, if maxed-up, can use some engineering item at lvl 29 that normally require lvl 30 (good for twinking). 
---
At max level, herbalism isn't really a plus but +15 in engineering is "huge" since some of your trinket does damage/pet level based on your engi skill.
---
Skinning doesn't have a racial improving its skill but you can get enchant and gear that increase it above 300 to be able to skin The Beast.
---
Same goes for fishing so you can fish the boss in ZG.
---
Yes. Being forced mad classic immersive.
---
Hopefully people are .... playing the game
---
I live the tram work and element of classic :)
---
Good stuff man
---
Lmao same thing happened when I put on an old mage set on my undead
---
You're the type that has to be forced into doing something or you won't do it? Run there yourself with some like minded people, nobody is stopping you.
---
Just because other people do it a certain way doesn't force you to, just work harder for it, isn't the what you want? To invest more time?
---
Because they been building up to it with Bran Stark thoughts and the legends of the North.
---
Similar to how Danny pieces together that there are three living targs (including her). Jon is clearly a Targ. People put that together well before the TV series.
---
Warrior or Priest? {Teamplayer}  
---
Warrior - My first ever Class. BIG Nostalgia trip. My question is... Can I tank instances all the way to 60 (if not, how long?)  with a levling warrior using an Arms/Fury spec but with an up-to-date 1H+Shield?  I dont want to barely be able to. Assume that I'm competent with a tank warrior and will only tank same levled (+1) instances. Is it possible without wiping solely because of spec?  
---
Priest - I'm thinking about choosing my last played class (MoP)  just because I feel like the majority will want to deal damage, and I enjoy PvE healing BUT also WINNING in PvP, so I'd be a disc or Holy priest. Question is..  
---
Can I heal instances all the way to 60 with a Shadow spec?  
---
My Wildcard is boring... .Thats a Rogue. I know what to expect but I feel like
---
The beta is limited to DX11 for some reason without the option to pick DX12 (nor DX11 legacy). But even so Ryzen 3 2200G can handle the game easily (mode 4 at 3440x1440 gave 80FPS, and above 100 FPS in caves). This game is very "light". It's 2019 and it requests less than 1GB of VRAM of a GPU on average.
---
My recent retail/beta stress test benchmarks: [https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/](https://rk.edu.pl/en/benchmarking-and-analyzing-world-warcraft-performance/)
---
Thanks.
---
Well the difference is summoning a guy who's in ironforge or summoning him when he's at the start of the instance. The former would be incorrect for vanilla.
---
I think it sounds like a waste of money... also no changes
---
YOU RUINED IT!!!
---
i feel like 90% of the people complaining about bfa in this sub have never stepped foot in any truly challenging content like a +15 or mythic bod
---
No, as a streamer the point is to get max level and milk views.
---
not a current one, no
---
I wouldn't participate in this cos it's lame and annoying ,*but* it's completely fair play on a PvP server.
---
Shouldn't you have asked yourself why you got kicked, though? Of course a game will be different after 10 or so years of constant updates ...
---
Dude, that makes things less time consuming, that's not the classic way. We should have to move everything to the addon folder manually, and update it like that too.
---
oh I was waiting for this haha great work guys
---
Oh nice catch! Thanks.
---
No because I’m a mosaicist.
---
To say that you "didnt need to do anything other than LFR" is kinda wrong, because you didn't need to do that. You didn't have to get to max level, or even start the game.
---
What you need and what you don't need is entirely up to your own goals. If all you wanna do is "see the content" then yes, tourist mode is all you need. But anyone who does more than just LFR and Heroic dungeons does know those little things like where the summoning stones are because you still need for mythic dungeons or actual raiding.
---
Don't get me wrong, I wish normal and heroic dungeons in BfA were more difficult, and I really really wish LFR wasn't a thing because it's the completely wrong way of introducing people to raiding. But if you limit yourself to the content that is meant for people who specifically don't want to invest any effort into the game, and then you go and complain that it doesn't take any effort, well, then you just played yourself.
---
I think you mean Stegodon.
---
I had a 29 twink priest full agility, wand spec, ammo pouch and bracers of marksmanship. 
---
Popping Berserking racial and attack speed pots was so much fun
---
Wtf is this post.
---
I play them because they stand up straight and aren't fat so they look better in armour. They also have better animations.
---
That's one long guild name...  
---
^(Use some comma's, netx time =D)
---
I feel like you replied to the wrong person or worded that terribly. It makes nonsense.
---
Theres gonna be millions playing, and thousands on whatever server you'll pick. So my advice would be that if you are the type of player to keep a guild chat alive and you're social with everyone (going for that Vanilla wow feeling) then you should go Alliance.  You're gonna talk to your friend about the game so much anyways. It'll be annoying not playing on the same faction but yeah...  
---
If you're gonna play casually, I think you'll enjoy playing with your friend more. the Barrens chat, Orgrimmar atmosphere. Racial abilities... Easy access to SM. Lots of benefits of being Horde :D
---
Don't worry, just watch for the many "just recovered my old wow account, man, time flies" threads and you might see him or someone pretending to be him.
---
Talking about Demon Hunters, I think it would be cool that it Blizz makes post 1.12 content that they'd re-explore their original idea for hero classes that you can turn into.
---
They would have to make sure that it's balanced and that the hero classes fit in the with the Vanilla pace though, which could be difficult.
---
50th repost, and no, this was added in tbc.
---
But why tho?  
---
with that motivation behind it you could say "why even bother getting addons" play it the "blizzlike way".
---
With the app its just easier to see which addons are working and keep them updated.
---
If you don't like 1-12 mouses i can recommend "roccat - tyon" ... you won't regret.
---
Probably. Its easy to complain about something of you don't really even try it.
---
Not any one at all, the Night King in the book was not the king of the White Walkers.
---
The Classic dev team and Blizzard are doing everything possible to have Classic WoW as close as possible to 1.12. 
---
Looks like people forgot that Blizzard wanted sharding...now it's layering, and it's not sharding with another name. It's the only logical solution for launch, and while it is technically a shard, it's a HUGE one. You can't just put a shard with 20 people in the same basket as a shard with 2.5-3k people.
---
They also forgot that Blizzard backed down hard on loot trading, basically being now just a label, instead a system wide open to abuse.
---
They also forgot the praises that Blizzard received for being open and damn active in communicating with us, much more than we could ever hoped for.
---
Sure, AV it's the 1.12 AV...but what exactly did you expected for a Classic WoW built on 1.12? 
---
Half the Classic players are rejecting 1.13 because Blizzard's approach to BfA...and this is stupid, at best, and crazy , at worst, because the approach to Classic was THE OPPOSITE.
---
Blizzard WILL implement 1.13, but they will also re-release TBC. And time will tell WHICH will be more popular. I already know which one will be...because NEW content, with Classic WoW game design philosophy, will blow out the water TBC.
---
Unless Blizzard massively fucks up 1.13.
---
Which they could do, because everything is possible. But they also can deliver the MOTHER of all MMOs with a good 1.13.
---
No official confirmation yet. Vanilla collector's edition pets are confirmed in so maybe any loot cards on your account that were available before TBC launched will make it also.
---
The illusion of control does wonders for managing people of the outrage, #metoo culture.
---
Give em a button. That'll shut em up.
---
On the stress test I was in Durotar and it was bit less crowdy than a pserver FRESH launch in Mulgore (and you have 2 popular races here). There was a lack of scorpions, had to find some boars on the other side but it was doable. The named scorpion I did later and in a group. The only quest I skipped was those drops from scorpions. Pretty ok-ish. 
---
If quests are oversaturated just find mobs and kill those. Knowledge of other simple quests further away may also help.
---
Literally every poll on this sub shows rogues outside of the first 3 most picked classes. I'm not saying they won't be popular, but people like you need to stop living back in 2005 where everyone was rogue. Back in the day where DR wasn't even a thing for a while.
---
I mean so many class picking guides for example say locks will be one of the least popular classes, meanwhile polls on this sub say something completely else.
---
I feel like best specs change greatly depending on what weapons you have access to. Daggers can be great but not when they are significantly worse than the swords you have access to.
---
Discovery channel happy noises
---
Even deep frost uses arcane missiles
---
This message took 5 years to arrive
---
Every spec uses arcane missiles
---
Eventually Blizzard automatically unlocked every major city flight path by default too so it became pretty much useless at some point.
---
Yeah but the first 7-8 steps are just "deliver this letter to X". All you really have to do is run BRD and UBRS. Compare that to horde who has to: Run LBRS, run UBRS, go to desolace and find Rexxar, Go to WPL for the hag, run UBRS again, kill elite dragon in Tanaris, kill elite Dragon in Wetlands, kill elite dragon in Winterspring, kill elite dragon in Swamp of sorrows, go to Desolance and find Rexxar, run UBRS AGAIN, travel to Desolace and find Rexxar.
---
The hode one takes 10x as long to complete. Alliance has to travel between Stormwind and Redridge, run around in Stormwind, do BRD and UBRS - boom done. There's no contest here really...
---
&gt;  they have never left something with in-game benefits imbalanced for long.
---
How do you define long? DK's through whole season 5 was beyond broken.
---
&gt;  they almost always over-correct to normalizing classes.
---
You think Blizzard would go for the exact same approach for Classic? You don't think they would have a different approach or be a little bit more careful? 
---
&gt; It's simply not possible to have 3v3 be balanced and still retain the high level of diversity that we had in Vanilla
---
I mean have you done a lot of 3v3 testing in Vanilla? To just claim it is impossible seems a little short sighted.
---
&gt;  And people seeking rewards in 3v3 would never stop complaining about it until Bliz tried to balance it.
---
People have **always** complained about balancing. There haven't been a single patch or time in WoW, where nobody complained about balance. It is inevitable that it will happen in Classic as well, regardless of any changes or not. People complaining will not always make Blizzard change things either.
---
&gt; People don't demand that duels be balanced because there's no tracking/reward structure for them. 
---
World PvP isn't always balanced either, still gives HK's/honor. A premade vs. random non-premade in BG usually isn't balanced either. Still gives honor/rep/HK's... Some BG's are also are faction favored. I really don't understand where you get this relation between rewards and balance. It really isn't existing in many aspects of Vanilla PvP to begin with.
---
Lfg, lfr is easy mode. He means mythics.
---
sure absolutely, but it's not like he showed off any amount of skill of classic pvp. I'd say the opposite
---
ONCE
---
Sorry it makes "nonsense" to you, I'll try and break it down.
---
You state retail is like a tour mode, which you are angry at because it doesn't force everyone to walk to the instance. So since you're upset about it not forcing you to walk there, but it's also not stopping you... 
---
Why don't you just walk there?
---
Edit: probably should have said so what you enjoy and you’ll get good at it. I played BM spec raiding in Nax and was comfortably top 10 in dps because I knew my class inside and out and my rotations were spot on. There is things like weaving your spells between your auto attacks so you don’t clip your damage.
---
Even things like mages had this. I knew a mage that would use a hunter timer for his wand attacks and time his spells between them and his damage was insane. It also allows for proper movement with out penalties in damage.
---
—-
---
Totally depended on your guild in my opinion. Back in the day I would PvP loads on my hunter but was a raiding officer and the guild agreed certain “ranks” were given an allowance of sorts as the guild was 120 strong (alt toons had to be actively raiding or weren’t allowed to be in etc so that we knew the proper active/dedicated number of players) so officers pretty much did their main content raids and then a noob raid for new guys and active alts that were gearing up. 
---
I would play a lot of MM and survival for raids depending an what raid and bosses etc but the hybrids for a little of this and that happened all the time as the talent system wasn’t that polished at the start.
---
I know it's just coincidence, but I actually did get beta access within a couple of days to resubbing to wow after having it lapsed for a while.
---
don't forget scaling. scaling is very important. don't want people to have an unfair advantage just because they invested time and effort.
---
You can't jump through the window without the attunement. You have to go through BRD into MC to touch the shard.
---
Yes, what I said was a joke, plus addons were a part of classic too, it just seems like this subreddit like to mix "hard" and "invests more time" up.
---
Hopefully we do get support for it, it was tedious before.
---
Kicking players from a group was the most overpowered ability given to players. I almost feel like there should be a penalty for kicking - like, maybe a mandatory cooling period of 5 minutes before another player will be added.
---
Oh wait, maybe, they could remove kicking ability altogether! And make players find dungeons by traveling to them! That would be cool. I wonder if there’s a game like that??
---
Exactly, the immersion made the game what it is, and in retail there is no community aspect. You just get paired with randoms and clear a dungeon and part ways. The community is what made people love the game and its kinda been taken away from that.
---
No because im not a fucking sheep
---
[This kind of pulls were satisfying tho](https://clips.twitch.tv/BigAgreeableElephantShadyLulu)
---
&gt;Sure, but not everyone has the beta
---
&gt;*in* the beta
---
??
---
That was some genuine excitement in that man, I can't wait for Classic WoW.
---
Just killing mobs isn't the point though. There are certain spots where killing mobs is insanely more effective than the ones you'd be killing while questing. Where the mobs are fast to kill, easy to pull, have good loot-tables, and all gathered nearby. No running around looking for new ones, no accidental big pulls causing death, just constant killing. With questing you'll often have a lot of time running around gaining no xp/gold what-so-ever in that time. In a lot of cases, the extra XP gained from grinding will vastly out-weigh the extra XP you'd get from handing in a quest.
---
Still a scum bag thing to do though. So there's that. They knew it would work.
---
I guess in marketing the whole point of it is to make more money. This was just a really lame way to get people to sub.
---
As much as I love SM, this 30 to 40 grinding is only widely viable due to streamers having pretty damn good "bis" gear for level 30. Really makes a difference for dungeon grinding.
---
I mean, are you sure you don't want to play a 15 year old game for another 15 years?
---
They could add seasons, monthly or timed events based on classes, roles or specs. They could do a ton of things, and there's some unfinished content that was scrapped they could play with.
---
Dude if you're playing a warrior of course you prefer vanilla. Literally everyone else got more viable specs out of the transition.
---
Zero patience. Might as well remove the player component altogether and develop NPC’s that guide you through any content you wish to experience. I mean seriously, the more I hear about retail, the more I feel like having other players around in the game is almost unnecessary. They’re literally one step away from making a 25 man raid one-player content with 24 NPC’s...
---
I love tanking that place as a warrior when every pull is like 6 mobs and you have practically no AoE threat abilities.
---
Your really misinterpreting what I said. I'm not angry at all. I dont mind that there are casual difficulties. I only said that retail still requires and run to the instances.
---
You find the friends while you level. Especially if you roll as a tank or healer.
---
As a former hemo rogue spamming sin strike through the first boss of AQ40... I'll have to agree. No one asked. I didn't tell.
---
Ah..I didn‘t play retail that much the last couple expansions. But you may have a point here
---
Yeah so glad that was confirmed. Don't forget the increased mob spawn times  because of overcrowding and individual veins so they don't get "stolen" from you.
---
Nope, it's hypocrisy.
---
When everyone else is wrong, being right is wrong.
---
Normal and heroic dungeons were only run at the very start of the expansion or during leveling. For mythic and mythic plus dungeons you need to go to the entrance.
---
Same is true for normal, heroic and mythic raids.
---
Wait and see?
---
That is like the dumbest option. Ever.
---
1.13, even if not an expansion per se, would still need a solid 2-3 years of designing and testing, if we want it to be as good as possible.
---
How long do you want us to wait? Like 1 year into Classic?
---
And wait 3 years more for 1.13?
---
Do you see Classic being able to sustain a healthy player base for 4 fucking years? Because it CAN'T. Most players would quit in 2 years, either because they are bored of farming Naxx, or they did as much as possible in their power to go past AQ40, or they simply burned out.
---
I don't see even 5% of the Classic launch player base survive after 2 years of Classic.
---
No, the answer is NOT "wait and see". The answer is push Blizzard for an answer to Classic WoW longevity, in due time, no longer than 6 months after release.
---
They have to tell is which is it : 1.13, TBC, both, seasons, perma-Classic. WHATEVER.
---
But they have to tell us something, because people plan LONG TERM. 
---
At least half of the Classic players want to know if they are going to pay for a game that is going nowhere, or if it's going somewhere...where the hell it is going.
---
Repeat the same expansions that destroyed Vanilla...starting with TBC?
---
I rather NOT go the same way, because I know how mucg damage every single expansion did to the Vanilla game design.
---
There won't be any new classic content... You guys are getting greedy. Blizz has retail to worry about.
---
I've heard people compare the grinding in WoW to a kind of meditation and I can't say I disagree. Simply killing mob after mob with that slow meticulous attention is very relaxing.
---
Maybe just make generic  Trinket 1 and Trinket 2 buttons, else you're going to run out of space quick.
---
Don't forget the engi stuff too !
---
The other day I was in a BFD group, and two of us didn't finish getting the twilight marks from the mobs in the end. Everyone in the group stayed and helped us clear to them again so we could finish.
---
I would always stay in TB/UC and sell Ports to Org for easy gold.
---
1g per portal baby
---
Playing on private servers that had 10k players online was amazing to me. Could always find groups no matter what you wanted to do.
---
I do so long as they are decently easy. If I'm just grinding for hours I want to be able to watch Netflix or something while I do it.
---
Warrior can definitely tank all the way to 60 as arms or fury, so no dramas there.  
---
You can also heal all the way through as a priest as shadow , so both your plans will work. Just work out which you want more :)
---
.........
---
I'm still using that exact keyboard.
---
I bought a "gaming keyboard" a few years ago because I thought this one was nearly dying with left control having some issues, but I couldn't get used to it and told myself I'd use it when this completely breaks.
---
Yeah, a few years turns out to be 5 years. Still going strong. 16 year old keyboard. OP
---
That's true, but a lot of people here are stuck on the fact that if the game doesn't force you to do something that consumes a lot of time, then it's easy. Choices are never a bad thing, and easy isn't a direct correlation to time invested
---
Eh, ever heard of Old school Runescape? The opposite of what you said happened.fhey re-released the game in a state it was in in 2007, added some old content that got released after the fact and designed the game progression all over again and quite frankly it's an amazing game that still harks back to its roots.
---
People will get bored of vanilla, and QoL iterations came out for a reason. I think blizzard should redevelop the game and to implement changes given the classic context of the game similar to OSRS.
---
Yes im sure i dont want to play seasons if its just the same all over again 
---
&gt;there's some unfinished content that was scrapped
---
This is part of what the thread is about. Lets say they add Karazhan first, should it be changed to be a 20man raid, would people be fine with it being 10 man?
---
I even heard an opinion that all the fun is happening on Beta now, everyone is overly excited, people organize fun events, improvise etc - that after the launch it's going to be boring "follow the guide to raidlog"... I not necessarily agree but ye, epics on Beta have their weight.
---
Most people who try to level fast ignore things like PvP, Professions, Rep farming etc. until level 60 anyway. And most people who will be rushing to 60 have probably experienced most of the quest lines plenty of times before
---
Pally Mage has surprisingly great leveling potential with consecration + aoe blizz farming. Can heal you out of tricky situations and BoW is awesome.  
---
Warlock Pally has less synergy. Also leveling Nelf hunter means you won't be leveling with your wife for a fair few levels, or you're running to start zone.  
---
I think best bet? Level as a mage with your wife and alt a hunter. Hunter the perfect solo leveler with little commitment so is Alt-tier in my mind.  
---
But as always, just play what you feel.
---
Why did the paladin in this video act so upset if paladins were better in PvP than shamans? [Unbreakable Warlord Shaman WoW PvP Ragnaros Sulfuras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w&amp;t=10m24s)
---
The only way a paladin could do that much damage would be if they had Reckoning and were getting attacked by a rogue, or multiple rogues, with a high crit chance. Or they used a Gnomish Death Ray and got lucky. There's a reason not a single paladin won the Test of Honor contest in early 2005, where the players with the most honor acquired got a special tabard or something.
---
But you don't have to be, retail doesn't force you to use the dungeon finder tool. You can form a group and go there on foot. You just don't choose to.
---
Already confirmed it wont be added.
---
I've been watching a lot of old parody songs.
---
Maybe /u/xypez means "better" in a broader sense than "skilled in PvP"..?
---
Well they don't have to do Kara, maybe just the crypts under it too, unless that's what you mean
---
Yeah, tune in that podcast or favorite music and hours fly by. And since the progression is so fragmented in Classic, you feel like you moved forward after every session.
---
Death is a preferable alternative to communism!
---
Oh thank you so much !
---
I was slowly getting resigned to buy an unreliable Razer Orbweaver since I didn't find a decent alternative.
---
Seriously there's a market to copy Razer products and make them reliable and last !
---
I cannot watch this video and not smile.
---
It worked like this in vanilla too.  True story, I helped a friend do this once.
---
That said, it was Vanilla, and it took 2 days for a GM to restore the character.
---
If you want to play both sides then you're going to need to pay for 2 accounts as you can't play more than 1 faction per account
---
Or you can chill cause content is on a drip and you'll have plenty of time to do everything in a 15 year old game.
---
No I mean Xaryu is better than Venruki at classic PvP.  That being said, I’ve actually seen a few mages that would absolutely mop the floor with Venruki, Xaryu and Ziqo in Classic PvP.  People like Wedding and Greatwizard to name just a couple.   After watching them for so long and practising in certain PvP private servers myself, it’s very obvious whenever I see Venruki or Xaryu make mistakes like not ice blocking at the most optimal time and not using cone of cold and frost nova in the best order etc.
---
Someone did that in the EU Beta to be because I mined a fucking Copper Ore while the Guy was fighting a Mob. :D
---
Lmao imagine racing to lvl 60
---
yep, normal.  I remember the land sharks!
---
Fine. But since they will be developing the game in this hypothetical scenario, if it keeps being successful they onviously wont stop and the unreleased vanilla content is finite. What sbout after that, and even with the unreleased vanilla content people have different opinions. Some dont want horizontal progression at all because they think it will mess up the balance of the game. Should we keep horizontal progression and buff items from older raids dungeons, should we raise the level cap? Its not that simple.
---
Subbed too, we rock the same haircut - instantly I like you more than other streamers :p
---
Nice, too bad it's a beta though... lol
---
It's both!
---
You can survive really well with Rhok'delar from MC through BWL in to AQ40 really, but just get used to only using that one bow for a looong time if you don't want the xbow upgrade haha.  
---
The BiS blues are mostly xbow but you can grab an Ancient Bone Bow from Scholomance.  
---
If you roll Troll, you can definitely justify going Bow &gt;  xbow with what we now know about hit rating going in to classic.
---
So yes, you can just use bows just fine. Just get used to Rhok'delar for the long haul
---
It’s amazing when you see a mage casting AI over and over to make it look like he is still using mana. 
---
Easy way to earn a /gkick imo.
---
Its almost as if its comprised of individuals with their own opinions D:
---
...
---
I mostly agree though I do think some required effort is important. If blizzard added a button to instantly make me 60, I'd hit it in a heart beat.
---
Bring back the MR T world of Warcraft adds please
---
I thought it was only 1 faction per realm, not account. Do you have a source?
---
Well that's usually where they would plan another expansion, at some point they're going to hit a lore block, and then that's going to freak out some of the lore community, lol. I think it's possible to peice on some content but I fear it won't be enough to solve the issue of the fact its already a 15 year old game that has already evolved
---
Nah no bc only vanilla base expanded on.
---
yet another "woowww classic is so much better than retail for x" when x is still a thing in retail. your character has to physically enter every mythic dungeon.
---
I think you're being dramatic
---
yeah because a LFG tool before the entrance is useless because you would just see the people standing there.
---
I think a LFG system is good if its not automated just show the names of people also wanting to do a dungeon, nothing more.
---
I also think meeting stones teleportation is nice. Three people still have to run and you can at least reasonable get a replacement if your tank leaves half way in.
---
You are right, and wrong in the same time.
---
Yes, they do have to see the potential...but they don't have to wait till after Naxx.
---
And you know WHY? Because they will KNOW before Classic launches the potential : Classic WoW name reserve option.
---
Every single new sub or re-sub in August will be from people who will play Classic WoW LONG TERM. Your name matter is Classic, and the people who will sub or resub for reserving a name, will be the ones who are serious Classic gamers.
---
Secondary to that, Blizzard will also KNOW how many servers they should fire up for launch, because this name reserve option also implies that the server names will be released prior to launch.
---
Tertiary to that, Blizzard will also know how to tackle layering, because I don't see more than 2 layers per server. I really don't see more than half quitting before Phase 2, when layering will be removed entirely.
---
Some servers might have 3 layers, but not all of them.
---
Anyway, Blizzard will have a pretty good image on Classic WoW, and they have formulas to project numbers at launch, 3 months after, or 1 year after.
---
Waiting for Naxx, in the above conditions, would be anti-logical.
---
That’s a better way to distinguish them indeed
---
Duels, imo, should be everything your class can do with full CDs, nothing else.
---
One of the best Magic the Gathering flavor texts on a card: **Raging Goblin**
---
***"*** *He raged at the world, at his family, at his life. But mostly he just raged. "*
---
What does pre-bis mean?
---
Damn, never noticed any of that going on. Not that I was looking for it. My guild paid more attention to dmg meters than specs. As long as people pulled their weight and didn't break any rules, no one asked questions.
---
Same i hate that they became super lazy. Instead of developing new harder content they kust slapped a diffculty setting on. Same goes for mounts "here 20 new mounts"... proceeds to release 20 reskins of one mount.
---
L A Z Y
---
I suggest buying and level to 120, do lfr raids. 
---
You'll see how much has changed..  and welcome classic even more.
---
You probably have to wait till addon devs get in.
---
I heard the staff is insane on Shamans due to weapon damage, so I would like to see it on Cdew and see just how crazy windfury procs become now
---
Undead all the way
---
"Raid"
---
Thanks for your retail mentality input on a level 23 5 man dungeon.
---
If groups are abundant then people have more opportunity to pick a good comp.
---
I whole heartedly agree but I can't explain what it is that makes it so relaxing.
---
If we had those guidelines, releasing expansions but tweeking them to fit the guidelines would probably be fine, even post wotlk
---
The general consensus is that enhancement shamans are the worst pvp class in vanilla wow.
---
*Because nobody will agree to that.*
---
Unless you've got dedicated friends or a guild that wants to do that, then you end up looking like a "kids these days and their iPhones and speedmobiles" psycho. 
---
Nobody reasonable is bismirching dungeon finder but people who don't want it would like another option that isn't looked down upon
---
haha, I was thinking that every time I look into this sub. At one point they are praised and at another point people don't trust them to be able to come up with reasonable improvements or even additional content that still feels like classic. Ridiculous.
---
Enhancement shamans have pretty much the *lowest* uptime on the Nightfall debuff, because they get fewer melee attacks per minute than hunters or warriors (the only other Horde classes that can use it).  I don't know what the actual numbers are, but the consensus seems to be that the other two classes are significantly better purely in terms of Nightfall.
---
But if you're going to take an enhancement for the totem twisting anyway, you might as well throw Nightfall on them to increase their value to the raid.  Even if they have less uptime than the other classes, the raidwide benefit is still going to outweigh whatever extra personal dps they might bring by using a different weapon.
---
I have full trust in them. I will buy one month for $15, see what it is and if it's good I will stay, if not, private servers will exist forever. No harm done.
---
Or maybe they dont care about it being perfectly blizz like and just thought the game is more enjoyable with a lot of players?
---
🤙🏻
---
Would be fun to see how they pull it off without putting the community in panic mode
---
Because it has very slow access to data. Reading device literally has to roll the tape in one direction or the other to read desired data.
---
This. When I leveled an alt in vanilla I sent that little shit gold and a full set of bags. Why wouldn't you?
---
But it is still a bug she and him should still drop loot. its not like the loot they were equipping magically disappears 
---
just because you were to good.
---
Maybe go Hunter/Warlock ?? You still get pets :]
---
Why would it be bullshit? He ready paid for it albeit years ago
---
Implementing the old mounts should take 5 min for blizzard, so the only reason they won’t do it is because they think it will be something bad in the long run. 
---
I can’t fathom why they won’t, I would love to get the ancient frostsaber once more in classic.
---
Feature, not bug, 'member?
---
All you have to do is look up private server stats to see this poll is wrong as hell, lol. 
---
Mages, warriors and hunters will be #1. 
---
Druid, shaman, pally will be at the bottom.
---
So according to this video - fuck rogues, right?
---
If anyone else here changed their mind as much as me, that would be very different now lol.
---
We used to farm Strat/Scholo and sometimes Dire Maul for orbs/enchanting shards to sell. I'm sure depending on class you could solo farm more efficiently, but it was more fun as a group. And often without a tank, it was still a little challenge and needed more than your usual one button dps rotation. Plus if someone was online with an alt, they would get the odd upgrade aswell or finish a quest.
---
I'll admit people did not use meeting stones hardly at all in classic. But people are use to dungeon finder systems so I imagine they will use them more, even if they aren't the main way to get groups.
---
Because they aren't playing classic yet.
---
A child would drink bleach even if the bottles looked different
---
&gt;but I'm not sure I trust them to make the right decisions.
---
They can't do it right, regardless of how well it is done. You have purists, that want 1:1 classic, you have people who want a improved classic experience, you have people that want more classic content and you have people that would like servers to gradually go through all the expansions.
---
Wrong. Read up on layering please.
---
You are worried about irrelevant things :p
---
I wish I could be worried about these things too 😅
---
Production takes time. They aren't going to be able to see what happens on release and then snap their fingers for whatever new content they want, just look at how long it's taken from them just announcing classic to being able to release it. 
---
You can talk about how name reservation will translate into long term player base, which I don't agree with at all, or how much of the player base will stick around after the initial rush, but that's conjecture and Blizzard won't be making decisions based off that.
---
If you purely play pve then why would you respec between raids?
---
Disgusting...
---
What balance?
---
I am sorry, but tunning Kara, Hyjal, Emerald Dream for lvl 60 doesn't require much "developing". Same for new 5 men dungeons...I mean, how much "developing" is really needed if the basis are set in stone : no lvl cap increase, no huge power creep, no new areas, quests in line with previous ones, no class redesign (maybe very slight improvements of hybrids), no new or talent system redo, etc.
---
I mean, a FULLY NEW expansion, where everything HAVE to be changed OR new stuff added is clearly a massive developing effort.
---
But 1.13, when structurally everything is set in stone and the gear power creep is kept at bay?
---
That is NOT really an expansion...it's more like a patch. And not a BfA patch, that REMOVES the relevancy of all previous content, but a Vanilla patch, that ADDS more things to do, while keeping everything else RELEVANT.
---
Only if you want you can fuck up 1.13. Otherwise, the chances for a SOLID 1.13 and beyond are quite high.
---
You're not being realistic if you're expecting Blizzard to start work on additional content to Classic before they even see how Classic does financially.
---
Jesus do people actually hand shit over for free just because they're streamers?! That's sad.
---
fraps.. how the days have gone :)
---
Well, they could make them mostly optional to level and just have some additional endgame content there.
---
Yeah thats wrong, PvE servers are a thing and people do great to be better at PvE - I know I did. I raided on a PvP realm and rarely engaged in PvP - once I reached a certain gear level I only traveled to raids in groups of 40 ppl.
---
94 silver in the pocket, spent all is gold on enchanting a white item with 30SP, true vanilla player.
---
99% of people do not have beta access, this is just overreacting...
---
I've had plenty of runs that were going badly become easy as soon as the bad player left. 
---
If they're pulling extra mobs or breaking cc or making it hard on the tank/healer by pulling aggro then it can definitely be easier without them.
---
whOMEGALUL?
---
What if they call it 1.14 on phase 2..? Then we'll only have 1.19 to discuss.
---
Portal arent available at level 9 for sure. Its lvl 42 if im not mistaken.
---
Here you go man [http://bilde.krissvs.be/hi.thaddius.jpg](http://bilde.krissvs.be/hi.thaddius.jpg), our first ever pull and wipe on Thaddius, might even be WORLD FIRST Thaddius wipe by &lt;Forte&gt; Kazzak-EU!
---
That's exactly how duels goes down in classic, not letting rogue/warrior get opening is considered BM
---
This is the reason i dont like the big timer streamers, sure they bring in a lot of new audience but showing entitled and selfish gameplay will only teach those new players that its okay to behave like this aswell.
---
15 years ago there were trolls, but the trolls that has come in the wake of streamers are some of the worst (just look at that troll at the duel tournament which was funnily enough named after greekgodx)
---
They will not implement dual spec in vanilla
---
TIL, thank you!
---
The wow community can barely read I wouldnt start worrying that everyone becomes a min-maxing optimization god on launch
---
Oooh thats right I 'member
---
its got the oldschool UO/everquest grind charm. after all the clamoring to add deep progression systems, all people really seek is a mindless yet pleasant grind. i guess retail wow is actually too complicated, and has too much to do. it makes it less fun, in some ways.
---
Yes. This. I will quote my previous reply bellow :
---
&gt;I am sorry, but tunning Kara, Hyjal, Emerald Dream for lvl 60 doesn't require much "developing". Same for new 5 men dungeons...I mean, how much "developing" is really needed if the basis are set in stone : no lvl cap increase, no huge power creep, no new areas, quests in line with previous ones, no class redesign (maybe very slight improvements of hybrids), no new or talent system redo, etc.

---
People who think that Blizzard will fuck up 1.13 are looking at BfA, forgetting how much Blizzard backed down on loot trading, or sharding, or how much communication and openness we had with them in the last 6 months.
---
You're right - a raid has you fight through trash mobs to kill bosses, while a dungeon has you fight through trash mobs to kill bosses - it's totally different
---
I would be on board with a story mode (at or close to the end of an expansion life cycle, as that invalidates all previous content anyways), hell make it soloable with a bunch of npcs as the other heroes and drop no loot. This way you would get to see the story, get closure and everyone would be able to see it.
---
Don't worry, any hardcore alliance priest will be dwarf because of fear ward.
---
All you had to do was follow the damn Zeppelin, CJ
---
Sure, it will take a little dedication and like minded people, but in a subreddit screaming about the community they once had, I don't see many actually trying to do much about it unless it's forced on them.
---
I wouldn't mind a way to form groups, so chat wouldn't be full of looking for this and that, efficiency seems frowned upon though.
---
Yeah I like to play doll with my wow char it feels good and I'm a straight guy.
---
Everyone has a masculine and a feminine side and at different levels, some arent ashamed of it, some are...
---
Everything isnt black and white. You can be a straight guy who recognizes male beauty and empathize with females w/o being gay. You can also be gay and not empathize at all with girls...
---
Self acceptance is a step into hapiness but It's blocking so many people, especially guys...
---
As a main tank im wondering why i never had a tank dom..
---
Am i doing something wrong here?
---
Being subbed does not guarantee access to the beta, they are not sending out many more invites to the test so you're more than likely not going to get in. Personally I'd unsub and wait for the actual release.
---
Thing is though, he was attempted to be kicked not actually kicked from group so he abused the group for trying to kick him while i do think its a bit much for trying to kick someone for picking up a quest they forgot that cant be shared.
---
Not only that but you can't kick someone 5 seconds into the instance if the quest was " one blink away " while its still a bit much for trying to kick someone for said reasons but no reason to be toxic also.
---
Talk about cheating yourself out of the experience if you race to 60 and start min maxing haha.
---
Omar &amp; Co are programmer devs not creative content designers.
---
Small precision, you can only break the fear while being in berserker stance.
---
I didnt take it in an offensive way. \^\^
---
All im saying is that QOLCs are not nessersary a bad thing of course classic tends to be a lot more time consuming then current WoW, but it hasnt to be necessary everywhere.
---
For Example: Blizzard imported the map clock to classic beta, of course you could just alt + tab and look at the desktop or analog one in your room. 
---
Same thing with addons i think..  
---
but y supp for that would be very nice
---
The Emerald Dream was originally planned to be a Vanilla raid and the partially completed zone was in the game files on release.
---
&gt; grinding specific mobs with good loot tables from 1-60 is going to get you to max level with the most gold
---
Perhaps the most gold by reaching level 60. BUT it doesn't mean it would be good gold per hour ratio. The higher level the better gold per hour efficiency. So you want to do low levels as fast as possible.
---
Im sorry but the fact that you dont have friends does not mean there is no community aspect left in the game. There are plenty of people doing cool stuff on retail too. You can meet them in dungeons or anywhere else. Its probably you who didnt even bother trying to talk to them.
---
Blizzard is one of the most trusted names in gaming. They don't cash in at the expense of players so why would they suddenly start now.
---
But vanilla was designed to cater to casuals...
---
You raid Wednesday, Thursday and Tuesday before reset. 3 Consecutive days to save on respect costs the rest of the week you are PvPing
---
You raid on a schedule, so you can raid on a schedule some more? Why? To be stronger? For next weeks scheduled raid? You dont see a pointless cyclical hell? Clearing content that is on farm is not fun.
---
Eh if youve done the leveling experience a few times now most of the content is at endgame. I envy the people who are doing it for the first time or first time in 15 years
---
Oh there's tons of things I wish that they made less clunky, it seems like they thought of them too late and just decided to roll them out with their expansions instead of patches
---
Whooooooooooosh
---
They said something about letting ppl have fun. So most of the stuff will not be considered as griefing.
---
tbh, give addon developers priority access to the beta instead of these narcissistic """"""""""""""""""content crreators"""""""""""""
---
Probably going to get a lot of hate but I'd personally like to see 1.13 content a couple of years down the line that also balances classes a bit and makes some currently unviable specs more viable.
---
They Live &gt; Duke Nukem
---
As a warlock I was always in my SM/Ruin spec and did PvP with it.
---
Was I a PvP god like someone with a Soul Link build? Nope. Still in my raiding gear I usually won in open world skirmishes and was passable in BGs.
---
What blizzard failed to mention is that other nations besides the US would even an even less chance of beta access, feelsbad...
---
i am for sure going to play rogue, but i just dont know which faction.
---
If i play alliance, i want to play human. If i go horde, i dont know if i want undead or orc. WSIP?
---
Don't put programmers in the same bag as designers.
---
You can trust classic wow devs team to deliver what has been 
---
decided, what they've done until now is 99% technical. For the future, it's hard to trust current designers to not ask devs team to implement stupid stuff.
---
I mean if you dont even know the locations of the dungeons ill tell You a secret. You have to run on foot to the dungeon to do a mythic/mythic+ dungeon. I dont think i have used the dungeon Finder this expansion (meaning the autoqueue ofc). The game isnt as bad as you'd like it to be.
---
I've been trying but can't seem to get a copy of the client without having to download other bullshit I don't want.
---
You do realize the stupidity of your sentence right?
---
A T2.5/T3 geared player is ALREADY making mince-meat of a party of 5 new dinged 60's, and absolutely destroying an opponent in blues/T1.
---
What exactly would be the different if the player is geared in T3.5 or T4? The outcome will be THE SAME.
---
Maybe it will take a "sneeze" less to obliterate a normie.
---
But the obliteration will still be the final result, no matter if it's a T3 or T4 or T5 geared player vs a normie or a newbie.
---
Yes that was added in WotLK.
---
They're gonna have aussie servers on launch
---
Omar &amp; Co are programmer devs not creative content designers. They would need to hire the likes of Kevin Jordan and Mark Kern. And who knows if they still have it in them to pull that magic off again. Worst case they assign some MoP-BfA devs teams to that task as those are the ones they have.
---
If you lose your tank you may as well head back to town
---
Yes they will it's already been confirmed
---
Well, honestly? Yes. This is when WOTLK was over for me -- after I beat him on 10men, not on 25hc. I strongly believe that raid (not dungeon, heroic dungeons are ok) difficulty ruined pve.
---
This is something I've been looking for for a while! Very cool. Based on this it looks like the equator goes from Feralas to STV?
---
IIRC The Plaguelands are/were colder before being diseased? And Eversong is kept in Spring via magic.
---
I don't think the community should have any sort of say. They just need some devs who understand what makes the game great and what the game needs to continue onward. Most the shit that ruined WoW would have gotten YES votes from a great majority of players. Game design is not a democracy and never should be.
---
the leveling isn’t the experience for everyone. I get that it’s Vanilla and it’s all about being hard to reach 60 and how it’s the journey that’s fun, not where you end up etc, but for some people, myself including (especially those who have done the leveling experience before) Classic is more about endgame content.
---
Well healing as SP is mana sink. Yeah you can clean BRD with it, but you need to at least have enough mana for the pull or the boss ahead of you.
---
Depends on your group tbh... If you're all 58+ yeah it should be OK, but if the group isn't you could have a very bad time.
---
I wouldn't take a SP post BRD, It's like the cutting edge of Shadow healing. It can be done, but not by everyone with everyone.
---
Saw a crimson dragon pet on ah for 10g lol
---
I did something similar to a guy a week ago but with a Plaguebloom. We were both locks but he was instead fighting off the mob that was aggro’d to his pet and him being under 60 I assumed he was just killing the mob for a quest as I assumed he would have made an attempt at the node to show me he wanted it. Yoinked the herb as I thought he didn’t have Herbalism and he messaged me for the next half an hour calling me an asshole. Look guy if you really wanted that herb you could have let your pet tank it, pet double it, Death Coil it, or fear it away. You had to the tools to get the node but you chose to not utilize your classes abilities so not my problem if we’re gonna get down to the nitty gritty.
---
ngl back in classic/BC, getting out of Mulgore as a new tauren was confusing as fuck. I had no idea I was supposed to go to XR, so when I walked out of Mulgore and immediately met a thunder lizard 8 levels above me, I thought I was supposed to go back to Mulgore and grind to level 20. It was only after a friend told me about XR that I realized I had to power through to reach the low level area lmao
---
I don't mind heroic 5mans, but different difficulties for raids are what had ruined pve for me. That magical moment of first kill was gone, it didn't matter on 10men because it was too easy, it didn't matter on 25hc because I already killed the boss on 10men.
---
Or it could be one time miracle when community recreated the vanilla and played through it after which you can return back whenever you feel like it. Both your account and the game would still be there as they were when you left and you would still be able to play with niche community that never leaves.
---
The game doesn't have to last forever as #1 go to mmo. It's aging 15 year old game and I appreciate that we will have to re experience it again. It's also a test platform for blizzard and rest of the gaming industry to see what a good game really is like. I know you are thirsty for a new great game just like you're but perhaps the next hit will be made after and because of classic wow. The wow didn't have to be it
---
Yeah, in real life money, when TBC was nearly out and everyone already *had* mounts. If he gets it from the start of Classic he's got an instant mount, that's P2W as fuck and completely antithetical to Classic
---
Pets are a different matter, they're completely useless
---
I disagree tbh. Wouldn't it be cool if a bunch of warlocks kept spamming doom guards in cities just to piss people off? Sure it would be annoying at the time but looking back on it, it's a great story. I dislike how people are so easy to get angry for stuff like this. Like pulling a world boss into a major city. That's fun! That's playing an mmorpg. I wouldn't ban those people, just add a plaque or something when you enter the city that says "on this date player whoever organized a doom guard fest that killed x amount of people"
---
The game is all about having fun and sometimes, being an ass is fun.
---
Also banning is lame unless someone is specifically targeting one player constantly
---
Warlock Pally has crazy synergy, [in fact it's a god duo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4)
---
Hes been mentioned in two of the books by both Bran and Samwell.
---
Exactly the same problem here. Except I want to play a warrior.
---
No respect for Alliance scum
---
Well only Horde has a blue quality fishing pole available from questing.
---
The only way Alliance can get a blue quality fishing rod is through the STV fishing contest.
---
Something about know my alliance char is gonna run away with a green fishing rod just urks me a lot :(
---
15 years has past since brave adventureres wandered on these lands for the first time. Drums of war thunder once again.
---
You and me both, man!
---
I just got a beta invite and am touching quests I haven't seen in a VERY long time. It's... Interesting. Reading quests, trying to remember shit, but also just being a better player. Not mashing random buttons and knowing what's going on in the combat rotation.
---
People still comparing Classic with Private Servers..
---
Gz, gnomish or goblin?
---
The NE male bow animation is SO BAD, it has always frustrated me that Human race has one of the best bow animations but can't roll hunter.
---
So you're saying with questing you spend a lot of time having fun instead of just grinding. Plus you get to have even more fun because it's slower than grinding.
---
Why would anyone want to grind then?
---
Haha nice one, took a while to get it 😁
---
Soon™
---
Any restaurant expert will advise to make your menu smaller. People don't like too many choices. Give them a few -- but all excellent -- options and they are happier.
---
I guarantee you anyone raid logging in classic won’t have a raid spot for long
---
Yeah vanilla is a fun leveling experience but a long one. I’m betting most people will be much better players this time around
---
thats called the release experience.  
---
If you dont want it, start weeks, or months later, to avoid this
---
alliance on 1st pvp server horde on  2nd pvp server ---&gt; lose on both
---
No, no it wasn’t. The only BM in duels was potting.
---
&gt; Nobody says that, what people say is that blizz wouldn't know how to create new content that doesn't power creep everything before
---
That is relevant for BfA. Not Classic. 
---
It is crystal clear that Blizzard is approaching Classic and BfA VERY DIFFERENTLY, because the player bases are like water and oil. You can't redesign BfA like Classic, not redesign Classic like BfA. It would be a disaster for Blizzard...and they know it.
---
What exactly a T3.5 that is 5% more powerful than T3 would imbalance in Classic? Nothing. And if you think that people won't raid, let's say Karazhan, in Classic, for only 5% power gain...you are mixing the player bases mate.
---
The BfA player, 100% will NOT do it, because showering rewards and epics that are much more powerful than 3 months before is THE WAY THEY WANT TO PLAY THEIR GAME.
---
The Classic player WILL raid anything, and the LAST reason that they are doing it is increase in power. The first is PLAYING the fucking game, the second is PLAYING with their guildmates, the third is PLAYING new content, the fourth is being among the FIRSTS that clear the new content (you know, reputation matters in Classic). Somewhere in fifth is power creep...
---
Do not mix the player bases mentality mate. Classic players are the OPPOSITE of BfA players.
---
Pulling a boss is fun sure, 100 warlocks summoning a monster ontop of me, no. It's just a fun as being camped by that level 60 rogue, expect this time it's someone on my own faction. 
---
All I want to do is go to the bank and visit the ah and yet I'm getting killed in my own capitol city for an hour.
---
luckily this doesn't affect DME jump runs since there's a backdoor entrance after the last boss
---
Weak to do 5, but for questing, farming, wpvp and 40 raiding you're fine.
---
Depends about what you plan to do. If you're OK to play 5 on farm mode one by one when your SO isnt online you'll be OK, but yeah 2 hunters in one 5 man is far from optimal. Still doable though.
---
Yeh i dont think this guy played the mmo's where you grind couple hours a day for few days to obtain materials for a weapon only for it to fail at making and off YOu go repeating the cycle :)
---
Amazing from start to finish honestly. They Resubbed for this!
---
Leveling solo is faster.
---
This. And also the game might be boring if player skips all the content: rushes to 60. Powerfarms professions and goes for meta all the time. I have two goals myself: enjoy the leveling with my friends (and make good while I'm at it, I don't plan going too fast) and become an expert in profession I choose (will require raiding and reputation grinding) meanwhile I do casual pvp
---
I remember keeping a few stacks of bleach on my mage back in vanilla. When someone would ask me rudely to give them water, I'd hand over a stack of bleach.
---
It's like people running after hunters in melee right before the duel starts, like if you're going to duel then do it properly.
---
Dun Morogh’s Ass.
---
I still do tape backups in work...... LTO5-7s.
---
I was not considering the gear competition, thanks. So it seems i will first try mage and if that's not my style rogue. I'm just scarred from getting ganked constantly as a hunter. But mage should have enough peel to get away from a rogue ganker, right?
---
Xaryu was against a druid on the first round, druids don't lose to mages at level 30. The duel tournament is a really bad indicator.
---
I never commented which is more or less fun. Personally I don't find running over large distances to be that fun, but I like to mix up questing and grinding. Both get very boring in the long run.
---
&gt; Why would anyone want to grind then?
---
For the reasons I just mentioned. it's more effective, both in terms of gold and xp per hour. A lot of players have been through the 1-60 process so many times now, that either way it's going to be boring. So why not go for the boring option that's the quickest at the time?
---
maybe im just paranoid but i feel like either
---
A. blizzard wont allow guild names like this because 2019
---
B. some idiot SJW journalist who never played vanilla will be doing a kotaku review or some shit and will see that guild name, get offended, and do a write up on it, forcing blizzard to do something about it (probably)
---
Pulling a boss or summoning monsters on top of you is basically the same thing. If you don't want in on the fun try going to a different city.
---
It's a massive multi-player online role playing game. Of course people are going to do shit that pisses you off.
---
But hey, I understand that people have different opinions! Let's just agree to disagree and I'll give you a heads up if I ever manage to organize something like that
---
Because your "main" is only level 10 while you're starting your 5 alt?
---
No, soda is gross. But they could do something else for sure
---
what kind of sorry ass carebear shit post is this? get the fk out honestly...
---
Game is already at patch 1.13...
---
Do you even shaman? Totems for days.
---
Although honestly a lil too many
---
Isn't the group leveling now like it is on retail? Basically faster and better if you do it in a group?
---
Not really mount training was what was expensive in 1.12.1 not the mount itself. An not really people used to buy gold an characters all the time, I know I bought gold a few times.
---
You're no da supposed to be in all of them if you stay subscribed though. It's been said as such by CMs, and it's what I've seen for me and others.
---
This is quality content, thanks!
---
So I did level as a priest with a friend who played warlock (free mount for him).
---
I was tailoring and enchanting and he was herb and alchi. We both maxed our prof while leveling so when we hit 40 I only had 30g because I enchanted every new piece of gear we looted. fortunately, as he was herb/alchi he got some nice pocket money and gave me the 50g I was missing.
---
All in all, if you play it wise and use the AH as well as a bit of grinding on the last lvl to 40 you shouldn't worry even if playing in group.
---
I mean if we're bringing in 3rd party classes this conversation is pointless.
---
I could probably like with Outlands...as long as Shattrath is gone, and all the crap that was ADDED in TBC is removed while the lvl cap is the same.
---
But Outland should really be a lower lvl area, and only BT and SCC to exists as raids...40 men raids. Kara and Hyjal in Azeroth. Emerald Dream as well, or accessible trough a portal.
---
Tempest Keep is way too sci-fi for WoW. It should never been existed in the first place.
---
To be fair it's a word that means very little anyway in that context.
---
gotta keep in mind a LOT of these guys are using super high end/BIS level 30 gear that 95% of people wont have(they might have 1-2 pieces, 3-4 if they are lucky or rich, but not full sets)
---
so of course clearing SM with 5 geared out level 30s is gonna be way easier than on live with greens/2 blues/maybe some non-30s.
---
I can understand it in beta especially if I can't use the weapon anyway.
---
Wait a second... The fuck blizz
---
He's using an Axe in the offhand, Rogues didn't get axes till 3.2
---
 [http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/3-2-0](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/3-2-0)
---
A tiny bit of photoshop good go a long way to improve the quality of those cutouts before you proceed.
---
And no, I’m not talking about the major changes to the image kind of photoshop
---
I do think that the vanilla system of spamming people with whisper in /who is quite crappy, but at the same time it also encourages people to join guilds and form relationships. 
---
In retail as a casual player you don’t need a guild or community. You just use the LFG tool.
---
Goodluck playing both factions on PvP server
---
Even though they never explicitly stated what game they were playing, it's clearly WoW-based.
---
lmao imagine sharing the joy of yourself and 39 other guildmates when you all rush to 60 and get ony or rag world or even server first, imagine lul like even imagine it lul xD
---
I feel like this is what a level 60 Corporal Alliance Rogue's UI looks like as he is listening to Ramstien and ganking level 30s at Camp Nessingways.
---
Time is money mate
---
Same, just own it if you like roleplaying a girl, the argument about not wanting to stare at a dude ass all day is weird cuz its rpg game, you're supposed to roll a character you identify with so in reality you arent looking at "a dude's ass" but just your own ass lol
---
Glad you had a nice experience here, but the idea that people in vanilla never left groups is delusional.
---
Alliance is the faction majority of females go to; equals horrible raiding environment and drama that halts progressin.
---
Horde is the faction majority of sweaty dudes go to; equals maximum performance and quality raiding that incrases the speed of progression.
---
&gt;layering also has some areas bugged (you can kill mobs there once, but they never respawn).
---
how is this even an issue lmao. i'd think blizzard would fix random shit like this before putting it out to beta
---
The best guild name of all time is big nick diggers
---
Why would it be? Is there some kind of party exp buff I did not know of?
---
It may surprise you to hear that different people like different things, and a lot of players really like what is basically the main foundation of the endgame, raids...
---
If they've gone through the 1-60 journey so many times that it's boring surely they've also done end game so much that it's also boring. Then why are they even playing the game at all?
---
You stating your opinion as if it's a fact makes you look like a twat. It's a crazy concept, but people are capable of enjoying things that you may not.
---
Glorious Ironforge vs. canyon temporary camp.
---
Easy choice d8-)
---
&gt; The game isnt as bad as you'd like it to be
---
That are strong words to use for the worst expansion and lowest sub numbers in wow history.
---
&gt;\- you know, what the beta is all about? 
---
hahahah fuck off with this
---
sure beta is for bug testing but play however you want. otherwise they would have said "be sure to actively hunt for bugs!"
---
the best way to find bugs and report them is to play organically and find them that way. thats how most people are gonna be playing when it drops, correct? so thats where the bugs would most easily be found...
---
I was running BFD two days ago. The run in itself went very well, not a single wipe and every situation was handled very well by everyone.
---
But getting inside was such a shitshow. we died several times. had to repair a lot. I, being a warlock, was supposed to summon people but ran out of soulshard. It probably took us 1 hour to get our shit together and actually get inside BFD.
---
And same as you, nobody got kicked, nobody complained, nobody said "gtg" and left.
---
Group work is much more fullfilling when you're incentivised to work out solutions to problems and there's no easy fix like "leave group -&gt; join lfg". Actually, I would go as far as to say than no more than 10% of people playing BFA understand how group work ties into WoW. I didn't when I played it.
---
this is why im rolling orc lock in classic. no WOTF to face and stun resist is the best racial for a lock
---
Buying gold's against TOS and totally irrelevant since loot cards were legit. 
---
Doesn't matter how expensive it was, a real money mount is a real money mount. That's 10g everyone else isn't getting. How can you not see this as a problem? Fuck it, might as well put the WoW token in. Might as well put the cash shop in. Character boosts? Yeah, why not.
---
Almost guaranteed it will be a mixture. Group up for "kill" quests where the mobs are either overfarmed or really annoying (poison, fear, diseases, self-heal, ...), and/or if there's lots of PvP going on. Otherwise, solo is generally faster. Some two-man teams with good synergy can about match solo speed too.
---
Solo but not strictly solo. You'll be slowed down if you don't group for names mobs early on when crowding is a huge issue.
---
If AoE leveling was a thing on most private servers it will be more difficult to do it in Classic.. because lot of mages will want to do the same and all the good spots of  AoE farm are well known and will be full of AoE farmers.. also the fact that all that spots are also loved by gankers.. as a huge fan of world pvp (playing mage) I’m used to camp some AoE farm zone dominated by opposite factions.. and i guess I won’t be the only one loving to do it..
---
I wonder what the fastest clear time on a private server was. Saw a guild clear most of it in two nights. But I think they got stuck on 4H. And I don't think Sapphiron would be possible without proper FR gear, which you only get after farming Naxx.
---
I already addressed this in the post you replied to. The alternative to 1.13 content is TBC, which rebalances the classes anyways. So using this as an argument against 1.13 while simultaneously wanting TBC instead makes no sense at all. How could you be against a content update to Classic that makes Feral Druids and Enhancement Shamans viable while at the same time being in favor of TBC which does the exact same thing, while also introducing a bunch of other gameplay mechanics which most players agree are negative to the classic experience?
---
It just doesn't make much sense.
---
Both you and Asmongold are claiming that there's some massive risk to 1.13 content, yet neither of you can adequately explain that risk in a logical way. This is exactly what I mean about it being a bad faith argument.
---
As far as the Classic purists being left out, I'm sure that we'll get fresh Classic servers along with whatever they choose between TBC and 1.13.
---
&gt;you're aiming at a very small target of "classic plus" fans
---
I am sorry, but it's about 60-40 now between TBC and 1.13. And it was like 90-10 when Classic was announced.
---
The trend is CLEAR and it will led to a solid 80-20 for 1.13 not even 6 months into Classic, when almost everyone will realize why TBC is the worst option, and 1.13 is the much better one.
---
Well fuck it. I was torn between rolling a mage, a hunter or a rogue, but this settles it lul
---
Playing a tauren I always asked how BS the boots were :(
---
Oh wow, you're right.
---
No it wasn't. It was completely exaggerated excitement and it's a big reason why a lot of us don't like streamers.
---
I disagree. 
---
There will always be casual guilds that doesn't require much consumables, *and* value people who simply show up in time and know what they're doing.
---
There is always a possibility to overfarm consumables and raidlog until you run out.
---
I don't see an always-applicable reason to take raid spots away from those mostly raidlogging.
---
Probably because the differences are more and more obvious the more we see of the beta.
---
\&gt;And no, I’m not talking about the major changes to the image kind of photoshop
---
I don't think that it would really matter or be worth the effort to it.
---
There was a thread last week where a guy who hadn’t even got to level 120 was bashing retail and the circle jerk that is this garbage subreddit were eating it up. I am absolutely no retail apologist, BFA is the worst expansion to date, but at least make the complains valid.
---
I have met more toxic, stupid people in this subreddit than any other subreddit on this website and that’s saying something. The community in here is almost turning me off the game, which is a shame cause there’s also some nice people.
---
Beats me, to be honest! But people are like that. Still enjoy PvP and raiding at 60, but don't enjoy the leveling process anymore.
---
Why are you coming with this dual spec crap? Have you missed entire threads in the last year about it and HOW BAD is for the game?
---
Dual Spec will DESTROY the economy, the inflation will be rampart. Tanks and healers will be rara avis, even more than they were.
---
Dual spec should NEVER be in Classic, or 1.13.
---
It should stay in Retail.
---
wtf are they gonna do on live lmao
---
In a larger pop server going eng won't hurt too much especially if you make friends with a guildy who can make flasks. It's really down to how much gold/time you have, if you think you're gonna be playing for many hours outside of raid nights then you should really be fine.
---
That’s what a fucking beta is for
---
Yes you can. You can have both an European and an NA sub. (Double the money, of course.)
---
Level grouped but just duo unless u need more for a quest.
---
They're counted as beasts when they're shifted. Hibernate works, track beast, etc. Shamans also count as a beast when in Ghost Wolf.
---
Horde main city options: a camp on rocks, a camp on cliffs or sewer city.
---
*rolls a d20* #20! Sry man, Alliance just won the capital city battle.
---
And i'll ignore the gnome comment cuz thats just too low.
---
Duo will mean you rarely struggle with any quests however, this requires you to sync playtime’s with someone else exactly, otherwise you’ll end up on different quests/zones. You get 60% of the exp per mob, but should kill things twice as fast. 
---
In your situation I expect solo is fastest. Obtaining a levelling guide and avoiding professions will help you get to 60 in the shortest amount of time.
---
But you said P2W is completely unethical to vanilla an that isn't true, it's personal ethics. Maybe you just hate the cash shop? Thats fine, but you're being really dramatic and making a mountain out of a molehill. 
---
Do you think everyone has to be even when you play a game? Some people get ahead by spending money. An this is money that was spent years ago who really cares if they have a free mount, maybe they should just give everyone a free mount so they don't hurt anyone's feelings?
---
You are correct on the overfarm of consumables. But from everyone I have talked to who will play classic, as well as many streamers who will be making guilds, will require them. It’s almost a snowball effect because if you have Greater Arcane Elixir you should also have your damage type elixir, then fortitude for more survivability, health/mana/rage pots to have more output in an encounter, and the. wizard oil for casters is really good as well and will offer an edge. The difference they make will be so large that I feel like so many guilds will move over to wanting people to have at least 3 types of consumables and food.
---
Wait a minute....the fuck, its a mace.
---
Cant help but see he was talking about rogues also. And then it stands.
---
Any one doing strictly pve should go human for wep skill.  Gnome or dwarf for a broader gamestyle, for reasons im sure you know as well as i.
---
As for mage you are entierly correct that the base int is much better in both scenarios.
---
I suppose i should have been specific or recommended human if you are more into their aesthetic and dont much care to min/max
---
that's why I'll play on a PvE realm :)
---
I had a group in the windy place in uldum, idk the name but the last boss puts a safe zone on the ground and everyone goes in it to avoid dying. I was healing and I stood in it and everyone else died. The tank said “I knew that I thought I could survive it” and I replied “ok sure”. We get the boss to 50% and boom kicked and trash talked in whispers. Thank you Blizzard. 
---
Safe to say I went back to questing after that one.
---
Honestly i look forward to chilling with quests like this cuz we have all the time to do it now.
---
Slipper slope argument there. Some are playing for max level pvp. Or maybe they prefer raiding. Either way, most of those people prefer to increase efficiency on the 20th leveling experience
---
May it be a weird-looking mace? Would be pretty odd if such thing is not fixed by now.
---
I might be wrong but I don't think the xp is shared in the same way it was in vanilla. In vanilla, xp for killing was evenly split among group members and that meant you get much less xp. 
---
However that was changed down the road, and in retail it is faster to level in groups. I'm not sure which one of the two is in classic now but watching Asmongold do his quests in groups made me think the latter was implemented.
---
hey im not gay but 30s is 30s ;)
---
They can do all those 3 things at once.
---
You're looking in weird places, it's not hard to find
---
there are so many good instances besides those for leveling, why only those?
---
Dungeon farming is probably the best tactic, just like in beta now
---
&gt; I dont trust them to go off the rails designing their own stuff. 
---
What about them NOT going off the rails?
---
New raid and dungeon content with minimal power creep is EASY TO DO. Sure, if they wanna re-work classes, and talents, they WILL fuck it up.
---
But if the ONLY thing that they could do is adding NEW raids and dungeons that will reward gear that is SLIGHTLY better (like a 5% slap in base stats increase) , they simply CANNOT go wrong.
---
A player in T3 is a MONSTER, NOW, compared to a newbie or a normie.
---
What difference does it makes if he is T.3.5 or T4 geared in 1.13, and it's like a 5%-10% increase in power?
---
You think the newbie or the normie will hold a candle, REGARDLESS if it's T3 or T4?
---
Wrath, but you got the rest right
---
&gt;Assuming you purely play PvE.
---
There are some reasons to switch between a PvE raid spec and another PvE spec, but not that many. Especially DPS raid specs work well enough for solo stuff like herbing/grinding or 5mans. Mages might want to respec for AoE farming, but I can't think about much else. For tanks and healers, it's not worth it for most players, and they look for different ways to make gold that don't involve hitting mobs (much), like fishing, herbing, or running 5mans for gold.
---
Depends a bit on the class as well. As a warrior you'll have a much easier time in a group where a hunter or warlock will just breeze through it anyways. Also think about if your class has a tagging spell. Moonfire, fireblast, shaman shocks, shadowburn (don't try it). These spells can be macroed and be used to tag spawning mobs. If you don't have these spells it'll be harder to get tags.
---
Thank you. Different strokes for different folks
---
As i see it Alliance is strongest in pve (human wep racials, dwarf priest fearward, gnome int bonus)
---
And horde in pvp, though its funny seing some ppl still not getting that will of forsaken doesnt work on stuns :P
---
Only if you have a Warlock
---
Really good for shamans and warriors indeed. #gief_staff_spec
---
Well I'm not saying it looked bad because he lost but he clearly showed his lack of knowledege by polymorphing the druid several times.
---
I thought people were saying the opposite. That respawn rates were faster as classic had forced respawn if no mobs were found by the server. (This excludes rare/named mobs). There will be competitition for spots as always but if youre fast you can get ahead and stay ahead using them
---
Level 1-30 you're better off questing to get there ASAP.
---
After level 30 I just grind mobs that die easy to melee with good loot tables (Whelps)
---
Looks like the Scarlet Monastery Mace to me.
---
Exactly yes
---
1. That's his main hand.
---
2. That's Hand of Righteousness, a mace.
---
Nice try though.
---
Just saying “my turn” got me more into the nostalgia of WoW classic, I was so young that me and my friends would take turns on our toons on a pc that would actually run the game semi smoothly for the time. I agree with your statement, when it’s my turn I’ll do it how I want to! That’s the beauty of classic, you can play how you want to and be successful in the ways you want to.

---
Why would anyone give 1k dollars for an apple stand when a 1 dollar bowl can hold them just fine?
---
Indeed. As much as I dislike BFA, OP's argument doesn't hold any water. Except perhaps pre-BFA content.
---
and you will see a lot more people completing them this time around.
---
Better addons, better mechanical skill of players, better knowledge of the game will mean it will be a lot easier to kill bosses.
---
There was a post a while ago with the stats but there is a drop is total experience gained till the party is 4 or more.
---
&gt; so many guilds will move over to wanting people to have at least 3 types of consumables and food
---
Yea, I as well think that guilds that require proper consumables will be a majority this time around.
---
You are supposed to BE the tank dom. You dom the healers.
---
They tried to balance between keeping dungeons relevant and ensuring raids reward the best loot.
---
The only time they really succeeded was early vanilla, where the additional stat budget of raid epics was mostly allocated to raid-only stats like fire/shadow resistance and hit (no level 63 outside of raids).
---
You sure? 100% looks like those green stone axes
---
I would 100% take an SM lock over an SL or conflag lock to a BG. I want my lock to peel, not just being unkillable and ignored by the other team while they do zero damage.
---
If you can't even read my posts properly, there's no point trying to have a conversation. Maybe someone else can tell you why everything you said is dumb, not worth it for me, later.
---
ICC until Cata was close to a year (1 day less)  with no content. Patch 3.3 was 50% of Wotlk.
---
Hopefully you can relax instead of crying about all these cheaters with their "free mounts".
---
Lol, this subs memes are on point.
---
Their fix is layering.  
---
But you can fix it by, you know... group up with other people?
---
There's even people in *this* thread complaining about it.
---
&gt;People didn't need to kill the Lich King, just revere those that did.
---
wait what, who didnt kill LK in wotlk lol there was so much time to
---
Keep in mind which phase you're in as well. At launch we'll only have MC and Ony which is completely clearable in PvP specs. Hell I've seen a priest tank Ony. 
---
Once more raids are out you will have to spend more nights raiding and probably optimise your spec. We usually had a rank 10 rule which meant if you are rank 10 and are pushing for 13 or 14 you get to raid in whatever spec you want and get dibs on PvP loot like BRE and Asscandy. I think that's fairly sensible.
---
I can dispel  blessing of sac though right?
---
This is a conservation project, not a reimagining. 4 to 6 years down the line I'd either want fresh servers or TBC servers in addition to some fresh servers. 
---
I want absolutely no new content. Also, don't type like THIS in your replies. Makes you look like a fucking tool.
---
I'm gonna group up when it's needed, solo the rest.
---
Looks like fall or winter 2005 from some of the names and guild tags.
---
Neither of those fix the problem. That isn't how layering works.
---

---
&gt; summoning stones
---
I thought they implementented the summoning feature in pre tbc patch,no?
---
I feel you there. I waited for Ash for months of weekly clearing bwl.
---
It wont be too bad. Ive leveled ok through 12k person server launches without the layering blizz will have. You gotta be attentive and snipe those mobs. Once you get out of starting areas it gets quickly better
---
*gargles* FOR THE HORDE!
---
It's going to be weird seeing clips like this of people looting epics in the future since so many people record themselves gaming for reddit content nowadays.
---
Yes they have confirmed a fix, if you open a ticket to a gm explaining how others are ruining your experience you will be put into your own instance so that you can level in peace and not worry about all the mean people tagging your mobs.
---
Link?
---
Druid here. I was healer for my friends, feral for sole PVE and PVP and moonkin for my raid. It was an absolute economical nightmare. I was in high school back then and WoW was more like a "real job" because I was constantly farming mats for flask (only a few would be used by myself, most of them were sold in the /trade or in the action house), this special orb for crusader enchantment or just mobs in general for money/drops.
---
I had a complete rogue-dungeon set, the complete druid dungeon 2 set, T1 and a bit T2. And yes: My bags were also filled to the brim.
---
Type int oa chat that you're looking for a group. The responses will be "There's a group finder. use it." or "Can't  believe you're spamming the chat with this. use the group finder, moron", etc...
---
Cheers for the feedback, I don't have any issue in terms of performance, just want to make sure I'm hitting 120fps+ continuously and I know this game is cpu dependent, want to make sure it's not just using 1 core and leaving 95%+ of my cpu alone
---
I stand corrected, looked like one of those mid range level 20 axes.
---
Nah they were just meeting stones and they were less effective than simply going to a general or world chat channel and saying LFG [instance].
---
How should I say it. The guy is multi rank one on retail, and polymorphing druids works the same way as in classic. So if he did, he should have had a good reason. Maybe, for exemple, forcing mana usage by forcing shape-shifting.
---
ah nuts forgot about that .... well, not rolling lock now
---
Im still torn, I really love Rogue but I like them for PvP since BGs wont be out at Launch I may aswell just focus on my PvE character until BGs release. So It's going to be Mage/Warlock.
---
Warlock will be nice to solo things, have a pet, soulstone, healthstone, free mount
---
Mage has better damage and more utility in interrupts, poly, portal/tele, nova
---
Pre-raid best in slot. The best gear available without raiding.
---
Yes they do, it's exactly how layering works genius
---
if its still very overcrowded in the starting zone on release grouping up with a few others to go from 1-4 to start getting quests in the next hub can be pretty effective.        
---
i just dont see myself doing all those kobold quests in a row on release.
---
It won't necessarily be boring for someone to have a character at max level since they can take the game more casually with an alt if they want to experience the game that way as well.
---
This is awesome. So many random noobs are gonna try this and wipe now haha
---
I’m personally in beta but we run our own for testing purposes.  Some don’t want to ruin the experience and don’t use it.
---
&gt;going 
---
Yeah, already did that.. Thanks for the explanation!
---
Oh man, how I wish this were true.
---
About that auctionhouse in Thunderbluff ... just keep looking.
---
Oh you made this yourself! I like it!

It is, I have an inside source

There's 2 other capitals without doomguards in them...
---
I watched the stream too you know
---
Yeah? Let me guess, your dad/uncle works at Blizzard?
---
Pre-raid, best [gear piece] in [gear] slot.
---
Obtaining pre-bis is important because it means you've exhausted all possible upgrade paths outside of raids, which are the ultimate upgrade path. Obtaining all possible non-raid gear upgrades make a big difference.
---
No dx12 on classic (legion client). Dx12 comes with BFA client.
---
RISE UP
---
They are simply subjective (started in TBC, never played Vanilla) or they are thinking that 1.13 means a full redesign of everything, confusing 1.13 for an expansion instead of a patch.
---
They immediately assume that 1.13 MUST add new, powerful gear...because this is what they actually experienced in retail WoW.
---
Which is NOT the case. A retunning of Kara, Hyjal, ED, GB, etc. for 1.12 classes, specs, talents and abilities, with a flat 5% slap increase in bases stats for new gear is what 1.13 means. No QoLs whatsoever. NOTHING that was added after Vanilla.
---
Sure, it's going to be a big effort to redesign raids and dungeons made for lvl 70 classes, specs, talents and abilities, for lvl 60 counterparts, but it's not like fully CREATING brand new content.
---
Its going to be a much easier and LESS RISKIER to do.
---
Da Boyz
---
Flying mount is another problem. They impact too many things :
---
\- Reduce the possibilities to cross path with someone else (killing pvp server)
---
\- Reduce the constraint of the layout. In wow classic, either you pay to fly to a set point, or you walk to it. In BC, you could just fly wherever you want for free.
---
\- No interaction. Flying is for traveling, no battles in the sky, no monster. Nothing.
---
Removing them is a possibility, and needed. Flying never did something good.
---
Also, for the draining, it's because all the interesting content was in Outerland, and nothing was done to make azeroth rewarding :
---
\- monsters doesn't scale with you, the land is full of monsters you one shot : no danger anymore
---
\- lot of zones have no pvp content, and pvp content is a buff for the map ??? (give actual rewards to the players participating !)
---
\- Why going in azeroth ? Shattrah (or the capital city whatever was called) had everything you need, and if you lacked something, there is portal to each capital city on azeroth directly, so you don't cross anymore the dark portal and then go back to your city from there. (necessary because it would be boring to hell to cross zone without any danger anyway).
---
There is room for improvement in everyway to make classic a wow that is still what the players want : A game that likes its community and let it meet (no fly) and play by their own (no tools), without removing difficulty of old content, and still make them relevant for future use.
---
With that, Classic will be what WoW should have been : a good MMO with TONS of content. Retail is not WOW content added up since classic. It is the last extension content with access to a simple mode with old content. Classic should not follow the same path.
---
It literally won't fix the problem. Layering is continent wide not zone wide. So even if one layer is maxed out, let's say with 3k people, there will be hundreds in the starting zones fighting for mobs regardless. I do not mind personally because I like the launch clusterf*ck but zone by zone sharding would ruin the experience like crazy.
---
They've already confirmed it won't be in the game you fucking idiot
---
gonna listen to the whole audible library while leveling so i can pretend to have taken vacation for relaxing and reading instead of going full on nerdmodus 24h+ grinding
---
You can't stop people from being morons sadly, they'll keep calling 1.13 1.12
---
Even if the zones are mega packed, solutions: grind mobs, 5-15 mobs = 1 quest worth of xp. staying in the same spot is sometimes more beneficial, leveling from 30-50 is generally alot of grinding anyway. or you can do dungeons, cant have your mobs stolen there.
---
&gt;Like i really hate transmog and think that it is one of the worst things to happen to the game, but if the vast majority of people enjoys it, it wouldnt really be a deal breaker.
---
Yes it would be a deal breaker.
---
I want post-Naxx content, but the guidelines are exactly what shouldn't be up to the community. All of those anti-Classic mechanics should be off the table from the beginning to make this work. Post-Naxx content needs to focus on interesting raid encounters, itemization, and class balancing in the spirit of vanilla.
---
Im new to all these things. Never was one for the whole bdsm things.
---
Warcraft 3 actually
---
dont woosh @me
---
I don't think we should be focusing so heavily on raids when it comes to adding new content. The whole point of vanilla is that you can do other things than raid.
---
I prefer classic go the current game because I don't want to raid.
---
And today SSDs are bridging those gaps.
---
&gt;Most the shit that ruined WoW would have gotten YES votes from a great majority of players.
---
Not sure about this. Some of the things yes, but for example many players including me provided a detailed feedback during BfA alpha and beta, about azerite armor, class design and other bad things about BfA. Blizzard ignored most of it.
---
BfA's terrible class design is completely Blizzard's choice. Even Ion said in one of the Q&amp;A they're happy with class design in BfA. And this is just one of the examples.
---
Playerbase isn't always wrong. Yes, LFR heroes complaining about even LFR being hard and Blizzard listening to them is wrong too, but there has to be some kind of balance.
---
Two accounts!
---
That doesnt work and wouldn't work in classic if it had LFG. People do what's most convenient and has the most utility. LFG would be the min/max meta thing to do, thus everyone would do it, thus it would be expected that you would to. 
---
Flying mounts are stupid, but in a world where everyone uses one cause its faster you're going to gimp yourself hard not using one.
---
It's just not realistic and is kind of shitty argument.
---
Can confirm. Work IT in public sector. We use tapes for long time backup storage.
---
I think it's because Classic is still a few patches behind BfA. I fully expect it to be there for launch.
---
Druid rogue combo ftw
---
Not really, no.
---
Not if he was the tank or healer. There's a lot of information he could be leaving out tbh.
---
It will be difficult but not impossible, you just have to pay attention and be quick when mobs spawn. Grouping up will also be a big help throughout the levelling experience.
---
It will, you're wrong. So so soooo wrong.
---
Yes, yes I fucking would. Now!
---
Pro-tip to people wanting to level warriors and tank: don’t do this
---
Legion engine? What are you talking about? Classic is using the BfA client.
---
Warlock Pally is the bees knees.
---
Who says anything at farm status? There are new bosses and new raids that open, progression to be made every week, better execution, higher DPS, fewer people.
---
Assuming, now that's one way to hinder yourself.
---
NEXT!
---
Lmao "I dislike how there are other people in the same place as me in an online multi-player game. Gib solo game please"
---
Wouldn't surprise me if people actually tried to ask for this
---
Classic is running off the BfA client. The Legion client was months ago, what rock have you been living under?
---
Layering still keeps starting zones over crowded. Your thinking of sharding!
---
Na

---
Your not only mixing democratic socialism with socialism, your mixing up socialism and communism, friend.
---
Overall its leas efficient than solo leveling, but it's more fun imo and if your play on a PvP server it has the benefit of deterring ganks. At least for the first week of release when there aren't level 60 Rogues.
---
That’s literally loading the image into photoshop running 2-3 gfx algos over it and saving it. 2 minutes worth of time.
---
Could do it once I get home (just in case you give a shit)
---
Oh, k
---
mage is life, mage is love.
---
Vanilla have problems with itemization for certain specs of some classes at certain stages of the game.
---
Just make difficulty and gear rewards tiers the same tiers as MC / BWL / AQ, make different resistance requirements and make that gear suitable for specs that lack gear. Boom.
---
It would have roughly the same effect as addition of Maraudon had. At the time it was released it was low level to "actual" content. But it has some gear that is useful at some point of your level 60 experience. Just like that ring with +hit% from Princess.
---
In case of these new raids they would be lower tier than Naxx but useful at some stage of your progression through the game.
---
No need to power creep beyond Naxx level if all you want is to see content. Fill the gaps.
---
Sharding my man, 2000 players per shard
---
The name reservation is not going to 100% translate into longevity of the player base, but it 100% gives Blizzard a clear image of the POTENTIAL. And I was talking about the POTENTIAL.
---
Six months into Classic is MORE THAN enough to know how will is go, in terms of player base.
---
I was arguing against WAITING until Naxx, which is 1.5 years into Classic.
---
My problem was not with waiting...but waiting longer than needed.
---
Reserve name is the first step, and that is for Blizzard alone, because we won't know how many people resub on August 13th for that alone.
---
And 6 months of Classic is more than enough time to have a clear picture.
---
I would say that the end of Phase 1 will be enough for that.
---
&gt; The worst geared warlock in the raid will be specced into imp Imp.
---
Human priests get extra spirit for pve and better stealth detection for pvp. The 10% rep is a great one too.
---
No utility. I've never been able to play Rogues because I feel like I cant actually help anyone outside of hitting the thing their hitting.
---
It doesn't work the same though in retail it isn't possible to shift when you are poly'd.
---
Have you actually done that, or is that something you think would happen, I don't doubt it would take more time to find people, but remember the classic experience is about relishing all that time spent on things, plus, you could always make a post here on this subreddit looking for a few people to play with, and they might know some, too
---
Yes. Battle.net will be connected.
---
An easy way to keep track of people not to play with, ninjas, scammers, people who slack and ago constantly in dungeons etc I'd guess, I use it for the first two at least, rather than using a notepad.
---
No shame in playing the game on easy mode.
---
damn this will be alot of deletes
---
you can mount in booty bay...afaik that wasn't enabled until wrath
---
I use a brilliant method I came up with where I don't watch them and scroll down to the next post.
---
Don't try to be so efficient. Get lost in the world. Quest if you like to quest.
---
AoE levelling at the start of classic will be very hard as most areas are going to be really congested. You'd have to be ahead of the curve to  be able to even attempt it. I've been levelling a mage on a private server over the past 2 weeks to see if it's the class I want to play and Jesus there's so many people, tagging 1 mob is hard enough! Spent an hour and half killing Quilboars for their damn tusks and that was with a group! 
---
Pve servers may be a little less congested though, but still i can see it being rather difficult.
---
It's weird how people would compare Classic to the only frame of reference they have.
---
Fuck those guys
---
Honestly OSRS approach isnt good. One of the main talking points before bringing old school runescape servers back was that there was no grand exchange which encouraged player interactons. Guess what the community votes in for a like a year later? Yeah exactly that, the grand exchange which has now drastically reduced player interactions.
---
Hehe... Yes.. keep thinking you're safe. 😉
---
you can do decent aoe grinding with just frost armor, arcane explosion and frost nova
---
There are no accidents
---
 - Master Oogway
---
Not true
---
I hope you love Gnomer: MCP is bis weapon for druids from pre raid to post naxx. You need about 40000000000 of them if youre try harding. Bonecrusher and crystal spiked maul are good second options if you want to enjoy playing druid lol. Hit is what it is, as druids use claws which cap at 305
---
Correct. But beta testing (which is more often a PR stunt these days) is different than a community poll.
---
1) You were actually playing with the implemented feature. It wasn't just some white-board idea for you to think about. It would have been easy to make azerite SOUND cool enough to vote for.
---
2) Azerite was already deeply in development by the time beta hit. They already had pressure to release the expansion from the business side of things. Making extensive changes at that point was not possible. They knew they were launching with a broken system... but some folks with calculators determined they would make more money by launching early with a FUBAR system than delaying launch. So they launched.
---
3) It would be a waste of resources to spend development time on features BEFORE the vote... so you would only be voting on concepts. A lot of things sound nice on paper... I would guess all of the following would have gotten a resounding YES vote by the community, at the time: flying mounts, removed reagents and ammo, LFD, LFR, hard mode dungeons/raids, arenas, removed weapon skills, removed ability training, quicker leveling + gear catch-up mechanics, nerfed racials, homogenized classes (obviously not worded this way but over time all the voting would result in this)...
---
The only things I can think of that would maybe not have passed a vote are PvP gear, the cataclysm (and ruining the old world), and dumb-ass simplified talent trees. I am sure there are more... but that's what jump out at me.
---
I'm just asking because I see all these streamers aoe grinding and idk I never played vanilla myself
---
Yeah but you couldnt summon untill like 2.0 or smt
---
I’ll be playing casually. I doubt I’ll want to raid, but am interested in some rep grinding and solo play... I don’t like mages and would love to counter them if the world PVP situation came up... Some casual griefing sounds fun too... I’ve thought about a Nelf Priest (Shadowmeld MC)... I’m hesitant on a pet class because of the pet management. Rogue sounds fun, but the farming for their consumables would likely take up lots of my time... Warrior seems cool, but as I’m mostly going to be playing solo I doubt that’ll work...
---
Any help would be much appreciated! :)
---
I was arms warrior, later specced for fury. I did offtanking In raids (was like 3rd or 4th tank if needed) but mostly dps. Worked great for pvp also. Was no need to switch specs. I did dungeons 2man with a pure healer to farm gold for elixirs. In tbc I changed to tank spec. It still Worked for pvp in battlegrounds. No point playing so that you need to change spec twice a week.
---
This is a conservation project...FOR NOW. It will die without no new content.
---
There I typed like THIS.
---
I am still right, even if I use CAPS, because people like you are unable to understand simple logic.
---
Maybe CAPS will help you do.
---
Weapons are just stat sticks, so whatever has the best attribute bonuses. Your weapon damage doesnt affect your melee damage at all when shifted.
---
On hits dont do anything. Windfury for example does nothing. On equip still works.
---
I saw a group of mudcrabs down by the river today, I steered clear of them.
---
Filthy creatures.
---
Why would you not go fury and just keep a shield in your bag and save yourself a lot of pain?
---
You are correct that layering is continent wide, but it's a minor fix to the issue were the entire server wont be on the same spot as soon as Blizzard allow us to get into the server.  
---
Group up with others to make it more smooth, less people to fight for mobs, also more people that can tag different mobs.  
---
The first few levels is just a small portion of the game that it's a non-issue.
---
Weebs are disgusting.
---
That’s was the case even back in retail Vanilla or any game ever really.
---
The client is based on a fork of the 7.3.5 Legion client my child. There is no update and never gonna be.
---
I don't think the dailies were as big a problem as people make them out to be in tbc and wrath. The rep grinds weren't particularly long, many of them were voluntary, there was a cap to how many of them you could do in a day so you got to pick and choose, and people didn't have ten capped alts that needed to raid before heirlooms became a thing.
---
That's what I did in Vanilla. Well... From lvl 10 IIRC since that's when I got my first talent point.   
---
And I'll very probably do the same thing in classic.
---
My opinion :
---
* It's completely useless. I do it for the fun and the nostalgia, not because it's beneficial. And it's a pain, because you spend one minute to kill a mob and then you need to eat.
---
* It's not a proof of toughness or of [goodness.](https://goodness.It) It's just a proof that you're the right kind of smart to play a prot warrior. &gt;&lt;
---
You mean level 10 
---
How embarrassing for you to make that minor mistake.
---
Unfortunately I don't have access to the official beta yet which makes it difficult to make it work 100% but I think I've come pretty close already given the limited tools available to me.
---
I was pleasantly surprised that despite a newer lua version being used, due to the framexml and api being similar to the classic one, I will probably be able to make most of aux compatible with classic.
---
I have also managed the same for bagsort and cleanup (retail branches)
---
Some other addons will unfortunately probably not work like the "notoggle" addon because for example the UseAction function is restricted unlike in true vanilla.
---
In vanilla, all that matters is that you enjoy the journey you're on.
---
Would you like to now more?
---
Youre going to have more than enough quetss dont worry. You may want to AOE farm at certain points just to speed up the grind points of the leveling experience
---
My only disappointment is that I barely played wow back in the day so none of this means much to me. You don't know much about the cool shit when you only made it to level 25
---
What about Sap/Blind/Gouge/Kick? These are all utility skills that you are guaranteed to use all the time.
---
I think reddit posts in general have over-hyped Warlocks. 
---
They'll still (probably) be underrepresented vs mages on most servers. 
---
Warlock will do better in PvE as phases progress, and hunter doesn't really scale well until a lot later. 
---
I'd recommend Warlock (I'm a diehard warlock player so I'm obviously biased). 
---
That said, go with your heart. Both are loads of fun in PvP
---
It's not that hard people the faster to 40 the more content can be shown that's it. Equivalent of 30 shit everyone just did. First to 40 first to new content
---
Congratulations my guy, this is post 1000 today with this exact topic.
---
Everybody thinks about the healers during raids, but forgets about us once the raid is done.  Either we getting stuck out here as Smite-spammers and Shockadins when farming or we're blowing gold on multiple respecs per week.
---
Playing like a streamer is a disservice to the game. If you like to do the quests then please do so!
---
Are you currently in the beta?
---
Essentially that.
---
They could even pilfer assets from WoTLK and BFA. Both play on the planet, at least.
---
&gt;free mount
---
Only for lvl 40, epic mount is still expensive. But yah.
---
I think what Soda is looking for is a pve server....? You can't just ban people for pvping an a pvp realm.
---
Dont stand in fire or the tail
---
Because its legion client.
---
Yeah, if you have a good tank and healer, the run is ~guaranteed to success. Thats raiding guild warriors+healers do the runs, reserving 1-2 orbs and flask recipe.
---
None of those are utility. Buffs, portals, food/water, summing portals, health stones,  soul stones, totems, etc.
---
Do you have an add on for vendor price on the tooltip? I thought an add on was needed in vanilla.
---
https://www.vanillafriends.com
---
If you're willing to put in a few hours of research to learn how to tank well, you'll be fine. 
---
It's not hard. You literally just need to read how to do it well and then practice it. 
---
Warrior is a beast in PvP &amp; PvE, but the leveling experience is difficult/slow if you're leveling alone. 
---
If I could go back to Vanilla's release and do it all over I'd level a warrior and main tank dungeons/raids. It's a very satisfying role if you're willing to challenge yourself a bit. The stuff you can pull off via stance-dancing &amp; general abilities makes the class feel **super** powerful.
---
All stupid bitches
---
Really? Thats would be weird.
---
I dunno what your loads are like but I need a fucking towel.
---
Depends on when you last played the game. Imo retail will give a new player the wrong idea of what WoW (Classic) is, so if you're aiming to play classic when it's released don't get too familiar with how retail is played.
---
The father of a friend of mine is a builder. In the bathroom there always stood some kind of special cleaning paste to get rid of oil stains on the hands and stuff.
---
But the last time I was there, there was no cleaning paste, but a small container with **30% hydrochloric acid**. 
---
On the bathroom shelf. 
---
RIGHT ABOVE THE SINK.
---
Thank you :)
---
Any particular 'on equip' I should keep an eye out for?
---
Guildies should always help a healer out with farming and quests. It's common practice on Pservers.
---
Same. I'd like to see the parts of the world that are locked off opened up. That's something cata did right imo although the execution was what it was.
---
If not I'd rather stay with no content at all than have TBC.
---
T3 already destroys pvp balance
---
I know I probably sound like another boomer mad because I didnt get into the beta, but it really triggers me how every single streamer, is basically doing the exact same thing. How in any way shape or form is this testing of the beta or showing new areas? They're literally just racing to 40, and there's 0 experimentation. Personally it would've been nice to see some more specs. Secondly, half the bugs these people run into just get laughed off, so I doubt those will get fixed, let alone however many haven't been seen because everybody's only in scarlet monastery. Rant over
---
adding a new 5man / 20 / 40 a few month after naxx would be nice. but dont raise the ilvl over naxx / aq20 / dm respectively. Mix and match gear between different raid tiers and 5mans kept all of classic viable and fun. no qol changes or other "gimmicks".
---
This vid made me switch alot
---
You Sir sound like a perfect NE Hunter... dont be afraid of Pet Control
---
No its not. DX12 comes with bfa client and classic running on 7.3.5 legion client. No dx12 support on legion. Even bfa beta has dx12 support.
---
&gt; or you can do dungeons, cant have your mobs stolen there.
---
I'm gonna heal the shit out of some dungeons.
---
Yeah, me in private servers naxx raid like 3-4 weeks ago, lets chug that Greater Nature resistance potion. Oh fuck, i accidentally drank a wisdom flask (while wearing titans flask and it had 1h+ left).
---
I prefer grinding over quests, I  think because my first and only serious mmorpg was a Korean mmorpg named helbreath and I loved it. old Korean mmorpgs were famous for their grinding
---
&gt;Orc has the BIS racial though.  If mages could be Orcs, I would 100% be an orc no question
---
From a PVP perspective I'm taking wotf all day long unless it has been modified from the way it was in the classic patch
---
And later fury prot.
---
It's not an axe. He's using a mace and a sword. The mace just looks like an axe. You can tell when he pulls up his character sheet in Spheniscus's clip.
---
Way back in vanilla on release when mechanics weren't well known or defined I actually levelled my warrior 15 points down protection to get concussion blow, the plan was to then cookie cutter spec myself down fury to get piercing howl because I assumed a "daze" was the same as a stun.
---
The tootips within the talent screen didn't display cooldown back then so it made a lot of sense in my mind that there would just be a cooldown for piercing howl and I would essentially be building a stun lock warrior.
---
A long time later I discovered this definitely is not the case.
---
Fair. Still was probably to oom the druid though.
---
Sorry for my lack of knowledge, what's MCP?
---
Atiesh?
---
Thank you for the answer :)
---
I've heard of bone crusher in the few guides I've read
---
Yesssss
---
Is Blizzard at fault for people abusing the in-game mechanics? The same could have been done by a group-leader in vanilla anyway.
---
too* means over or also
---
to is for destination
---
Look up joke for me.
---
&gt; It won't necessarily be boring for someone to have a character at max level since they can take the game more casually with an alt if they want to experience the game that way as well.
---
This is what I've been doing for ages. Power level a main to max and then chill level an alt reading the quest text. It's fun because what you were doing on your main leveling starts to make sense.
---
Duo is best xp wise.
---
Classic running on 7.3.5 client. Once they run it with that client they can’t update it. They are gonna stick to legion client also in future. So there is no dx12 support.
---
This will probably happen, we killed the servers during the stress test, they won't learn from it anyway and it will repeat on launch lmao.
---
Manual crowd pummeler. Its hands down the best druid weapon because it has an active that increases attack speed by 50% for 30 seconds, but it has 3 charges. Seriously dont do this to yourself and just farm like bonecrusher. Atiesh is a staff from naxx, wouldnt worry about it too much for a while
---
I see what you mean
---
TB AH is my favorite. So close to Mailbox/bank and right next to the forge!
---
I started playing in TBC, and I've always played Alliance. Going horde in classic, it's basically going to be a new game to me, HYPE
---
Was totally expecting the first chapter to be discussing the actual tournament and what consumes/specs were banned and why lol. Other wise another banger of an ep josh.
---
Wotfs is not as good as +25% stun resist in a meta of grenades, rogues, paladin stuns, impact from mages, pet stun from hunter, tidal charm, etc.  It’s so much more valuable than the undead racial.  That being said, wotfs isn’t bad at all but I would put it on the same par as escape artist due to that being 1min cd
---
I like fire mage for questing too... just sayin
---
There is nothing quite like that millisecond of realization and the anime style conversation your brain has as you hover over the drop   
---
"Does that drop that?" "What is that icon" "Wait is that" "I'm rich" "This is basically a mount if it's good" "Is it?" "IT IS" then you try to say it all at once and gasp so all you really get out is HURGHFHH
---
Are You playing on eu or na? Currently looking for a guild :-)
---
Join druid discord or lookup Taladril and Shedo
---
Well as a non sl lock ull get zerged by warriors or hunters easily
---
On average I kill 1000-1500 people on my way to 60 which makes it likely there could be streamer kills in there.
---
Now if he reports me despite me not knowing any streamers at all I'm suddenly blacklisted by my own faction for pvping on a pvp server?
---
Just go play on a pve server? Why does everyone else have to change their playstyle because you have boogeyman syndrome about streamsnipers?
---
That sounds like a rather unpleasant experience to be on the receiving end of!
---
Do the charges reset?
---
Bonecrusher it is!
---
Why would you not go Arms*.
---
No reason to go fury for levelling. You're using a 2h, can even pick up defensive talents like parry, and BT is shit compared to MS.
---
There's a discord?
---
They're the people who run it? :)
---
For teh Epixxxs!!!11
---
Do you realize that some people enjoy being efficient? Stop trying to force your RP ideology on everyone.
---
And the view is quite nice. I wish we had more transportation options like that, where you just wait a few minutes and soak in the scenery.
---
Most of my questing was done in a group, we'd round up 5-8 quest mobs, I'd tank them while my dps buddies burned em down.
---
Yeah because these people are nameless faces from another realm that I won’t ever encounter again. If someone did this to you in vanilla you’d have your whole guild blacklisting theirs.
---
Hi, /u/Altnob
---
Fury prot will create more issues than it solves for like 95% of the playerbase. If youre on top of your consumes and gear threat wont be an issue unless you have a few dps either no life minmaxing or people that can’t wait a few seconds on pull
---
I mean you're also forgetting the homogenization of class design. 
---
I have almost every class at least at 110, and they're all so similar that I've got my keybinds as "7 self-heal, 8 big attack/short cooldown attack, 9 another big attack or ability on CD, 0 stun, - slow, = spell disrupt" 
---
2 is my spam attack, 3 is the like 6 sec cooldown attack, and then all my minute-long cooldowns are on shift+buttons. 
---
Efficiency isn't frowned upon but what happens is you get these groups that nobody cares about and ninja loot and are on different servers so nobody cares. 
---
Honestly a decent compromise would be 1) that character has to physically discover the dungeon first, and 2) the Dungeon Finder only counts for your own server. 
---
That's the best compromise I could think of that keeps the exploration, community, and convenience all in one bundle.
---
Its random. You are correct into your idea to use ran 1 buffs though. Druids will often throw rank 1 rejuvs on themselves while fighting a shaman to bait him to wasting mana.
---
Well that escalated quickly. I hope you have a good day and a great cup of coffee!
---
Ya arms is for sure the better choice, i have more fun with fury but w/e. No matter what plz dont level as prot unless you truly hate yourself lol
---
Dew it.
---
ｕｎｉｔ
---
Yea but at least the Horde has Thrall. Alliance is run by Onyxia.
---
Yes, there's a druid Discord with some good theorycrafters you can Google. Taladril/Shedo are authors of nice in-depth guides.
---
Unless they changed it from classic it's on a separate cool down from the trinket and it will also give a 20 second immunity thereafter.
---
It has exactly 100 hp, but it seems to take reduced damage. Also the priest shields the eye, Dakkroth pulls one group with it (the aggro range seems bugged, he has to literally stand on top of them to aggro enemy mobs) and then he just runs through the instance and the mobs following him aggro the other groups. So the eye doesn't really take a lot of damage.
---
Since WoW PvP died with classic, at least a lot of it, a lot are extremely scared, I would guess.
---
Others are just extremely conservative. They view any change as bad.
---
well, but youre objectively young. And never forget, youll age far better than a female so you got that atleast. Youre not going to look any worse with 36, so dont worry I guess? Mb itll take a toll on the joints tho
---
They do not reset, hence you needing to farm like 10 a raid. You dont need to do it unless youre trying to join cutting edge guilds as feral
---
Been seeing a lot of shaman hate on here lately. Kinda sad to see because I’ve been really looking forward to playing one. If the hate is real I’m leaning towards priest
---
I'm with you. I also didn't burn myself out on private servers and don't only enjoy hardcore leveling because of it, like a lot of people did. :)
---
The DPS increase doesn't exist for every fight though, making the other races preferred for maximum dps output.
---
The outcry would be amazing. :'D
---
Thank you friend :)
---
I'll keep an eye out online for them as I research
---
Hey, no problem!  
---
I got most of my numbers from this 2006 comment:  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11040/morrowgrain#comments:id=2650456  
---
It's a small sample size, but you gotta start somewhere. I calculated it like this:  
---
You get a random amount of 1-5 Morrowgrain from the transmute (average 3) roughly 1/3 of the time, so on average around 1 per transmute, or 6 per hour.   
---
The Feathermoon quest gives 25 rep for 5 Morrowgrain, the Darnassus one gives 50 rep for 10. Either way, you gain 5 rep per Morrowgrain, at 6 Morrowgrain per hour, that's 30 rep per hour.  
---
It's a high estimate for that comment's sample without 150 Herbalism, but a very low one for the sample with it. I just used it to have a rough middle of the road number. The Human racial is not included, but that's simple to calculate, it just adds 10% extra rep.
---
All that said: the cloth turn-ins are currently in the beta. If they stay for release and aren't held back until the BWL phase, just do that, it's wayyyyyy faster and cheaper:
---
The repeatable Runecloth quest gives 150 rep for 3 stacks of Runecloth.  
---
21k rep divided by 150 rep is 140 turn-ins, or 420 stacks of Runecloth. At 2 gold per stack (high estimate, although prices might stay high for a while initially if the turn-ins are in game from the beginning), that is 840 gold, and farming at 30 gold/hour (low estimate, any class can easily get that much) means you'll be exalted after 28 hours of farming gold, or 25.2 hours as a Human.
---
Doing 21k rep with Morrowgrain at 5 rep per transmute is 4200 transmutes. Not only does that take 700 hours (not 70, sorry to say lol) but it also costs you 420 gold in Packet of Tharlendris Seeds (4200 x 10 silver) plus ~170 gold in Un'Goro Soil (4200 x 2 per transmute x 2 silver, assuming you can even buy them this cheap) = 590 gold just in raw materials. Add in *seven hundred hours* of buying 8400 Un'Goro Soil, micromanaging your inventory and auctions, never forgetting to do the transmute every ten minutes.... the 4200 10 second transmute casts alone take more than 11.5 hours, lol. In that time you could easily farm 300 extra gold, which puts you at 890 gold, already making Morrowgrain the more expensive and headachey method. Depending on your gold farming ability, it becomes even worse. Soooooo...
---
TL;DR: Hope to god cloth turn-ins are in the game at launch and forget about Morrowgrain
---
Do we know if there are going to be RPPVP servers as well or not?
---
Nope. You have to run gnomer thousands of times so you can keep using it.
---
Lol that was before we had decent dmg meters. We allowed some freedom with specs and roles until we got to Vael the guild killer. Then we started getting serious about people not pulling their weight. Had to start forming “proper” dps groups with “proper” raid heal groups.
---
You have posted that now 5 times on this thread, show the proof of that. If i remember right the closed beta was based on 8.01 (BFA optimizations were in 8.1 ?). Havent gone through the files myself.
---
It makes literally NO sense for them to keep updating two different clients. Yes, the blizzcon demo was 7.3.5, because they had to start from somewhere.
---
When I see the opposing faction out in the open, I feel bad for killing them and I don't enjoy world pvp (I love BGs tho), so I see no reason to go for a PvP realm
---
The other day we wiped 10+ times in DM. It took us 4 hours to complete the dungeon. All of us were strangers and still no one left. It’s a matter of determination.
---
*a group of lvl 30 twinks that literally had the most skilled players behind them who spent 3 weeks getting BiS gear. And they still died quite a few times during bad pulls.
---
Thank you! I love it
---
Anyone know of a good comprehensive list of easy to melee mobs after level 30 or so?
---
-t autismo who can't read human emotions
---
Ignoring the other two responders: if your guild has a slightly higher number of Warlocks than average -- a SPriest will absolutely get a slot and will help the Warlocks match / slightly under-perform vs the mages. It's a useful position if your raid makeup makes it so.
---
I don't think I'll end up high end raiding - maybe I'll try it for a time but I don't think I'll be a historic feral player. Just one who will give you buffs as we walk by in the world :)
---
Yes, but of you add people as friends in-game with character name and not battle tag, it won't count against the limit (and you can see them only in-game in your friend list). I think that's what you're asking?
---
Levitate for priest?
---
You won't be able to solo aoe grind for months
---
Love it!
---
But yah no point subbing again and stuff, just wait it out and play the real game when it releases. I've been trying to stop myself playing another private server because... like the beta, I would be wasting my time on something that won't stick around.
---
But the wait is kinda killing me at this point, I was already super excited when they announced classic was going to be real.
---
Sorry to disappoint you but I've been playing till mid-late vanilla. BfA carebear
---
Well this thread is just complaining about there being too many players really...
---
Man you really are something else. Dataminers have confirmed that it's using a 8.x version and will likely keep updating along side BfA but you just keep on living your delusions, don't let me interfere.
---
Na I'm not you are
---
Partially yes, My friend list is full and i dont want to find friends in classic and deal with the issue that the list will be full.
---
Www.meatspin.com
---
Yes but you can do that in Arms spec with a sword and shield and not be useless to your group.
---
Servers will most likely have reasonable population caps, which makes AoE lvling much more viable
---
will suggest you fight mobs as you move from point a to point b. 
---
That said you're gonna probably want that least temporarily group up around areas that spawn mobs for your kill X number of mobs quests. You'll also need to group for elite quests.
---
Duo leveling isn't so bad. Its safer, you die less, and it has the added benefit of deterring woild be gankers. I certainly wouldn't permanently group with more than 1 other person though.
---
It’s not 20 seconds, it’s 5 seconds.  Also your trinket doesn’t get you out of stuns either.   You’re underestimating the power of stuns in vanilla and only certain classes such as hunter can get out of stuns with their insignia trinket.   Orc racial is one of the most broken passive abilities in vanilla wow.
---
Why not? They got the code, they could merge them in a new patch/branch. Or am I wrong?
---
Every class brings unique abilities to the duo that there is no bad or best option, play what you enjoy playing most and you'll be better at it than playing a class that isn't your primary choice.
---
I guess if you're an idiot or an overly dramatic baby
---
This guy Warlocks.
---
They said no, but people are still demanding it though. I feel like there ought to be enough people who want it to justify at least one realm per region.
---
I started on Alleria. Was too much of a noob to know anything.

I played both horde and alliance in classic (I switched to the server of real life friends after my guild imploded halfway through AQ40), but never really at the same time (maybe an alt for an afternoon which I then abandoned). I really wouldn't want to switch constantly, the two factions have very different vibes about them so for me that wouldn't work. Maybe you could do it if you consider it just a game, but immersion for me is important.
---
Both are great, I loved the starting zones as a NELF, but I also really enjoyed Mulgore etc. I'm sure you'll miss your old stomping grounds if you switch, but making new experiences and exploring new, different but still great areas can be a lot of fun as well and creating a different story this time around might even be more fun and not wear off that fast as doing the same things again. You just have to let it happen and not constantly worry about it, that is a sure way to regret and doubt.

Source: Playing the beta rn
---
I agree, but also think if blizzard opens up 20+layers just for the first day to accommodate the starting area - and then after the first day condense those layers into 4 or 5, then we might be good. 
---
But that only works if they can seamlessly open, merge and close on the fly.
---
I'm under the assumption that the starting zone will take 3+ hours with the amount of people there. Who knows if blizzard thinks that's okay...
---
You can look at the code for auctionator or auctioneer (can't remember which one) there's a work version for Classic.
---
a lot
---
Is this a serious question? You're going to poison the minds of all the other idiots out there asking dumb questions like this my friend.
---
You dont have to explain why you bumped the difficulty down. Some people have lives or kids and just want to experience the game even if it's a fundamentally different experience.

Thanks--your post and the one you linked were really helpful!
---
The point about mobility in BG's is interesting as well. I think ultimately the decision comes down to whether you'd prefer to be more of an immobile "turret"-style player in PVP as a lock or a highly mobile, hit-and-run player with a hunter.
---
Let me know which one you end up picking!
---
the love i'm getting from this subreddit is wholesome &lt;3
---
Fuck that I'd keep it. Sentimental value.
---
Fucking hell, the game isn't even out yet. Better yet, be glad if there are a lot of players
---
I’m sorry but you are wrong. They can’t even use legion client. They are constantly changing it for classic settings and you are saying lets do it with bfa client too. Its huge work they are never gonna do it.

&gt;It’s not 20 seconds, it’s 5 seconds. 
---
looks like they nerfed it then because I believe in the classic patch originally it would still be 20 seconds.
---
&gt; You’re underestimating the power of stuns in vanilla 
---
no I just didn't know that they were going to keep the nerfs to wotf even though, if memory serves, those Nerf's happened well after the classic patch we are using.

Being on reddit doesn't make someone a nerd. Bitching about how 'you feel' old graphics aren't outdated and trying to make everyone conform to your thoughts is. Want me to be more specific? You're a turbo nerd. You are the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons incarnate.
---
Yes that sounds like a jealous crybaby boomer. LOL.
---
Yea! Surely there’s enough demand?! Why would they not? Fingers crossed they do - I always used to play RPPVP back in the day
---
To be fair that is a dick thing to do
---
The issue with TF is the threat it generates, and i think thats why in todays meta it will always go to a tank or a fury/prot.
---
At least it's still cheaper than normal epic riding, especially if you find another warlock with the mats for the final quest. Although the lengthy quest chain is a decent amount of work, so that offsets some of the cost.
---
Even compared to Gressil/Hungering cold? I doubt
---
You’re saying wotfs lasted 20 seconds as of patch 1.12?
---
&gt;Hi! I've decided that I'm going to roll mage and do some AoE lvling for the classic.
---
In a few months, sure :)
---
Respawn rates (if it's an empty area) can be up to 5 minutes. 
---
If there are a lot of people in the area killing the mobs at the same time - it gets reduced to 2-3 minutes.
---
Almost every aoe spot is known, aoe leveling is faster, mage is a popular class - only way I see anyone aoe leveling is if they are super ahead of the pack, or grouped and tagging everything.
---
Yes, I think it was some Scipt that just removed access from everyone that created a character on the Alpha realm, and accidentally removed not just Alpha privileges but Beta aswell..
---
No. Classic uses the 7.3.5 client as a base.

What is dumb about this?
---
They have a cash shop...
---
I believe Classic will succeed and that TBC is inevitable, I always played a hunter but never raided vanilla in 2004-6 and only did like half of TBC. I'm gonna find a great raiding guild now so that when TBC rolls around, I can be in a spot to raid everything and eventually get Thori'Dal. That's the \~4 year goal. I think that counts, right..?
---
Looks like it was nerfed in patch 1.6
---
I guess that almost everyone will have access in like the last week or something
---
Ugh, fuck Vael. We spent more time on Vael for the first kill than we did on Prophet. But when we were learning Vael, there was no strategy for it on the net yet. We were just throwing tanks at him till they died, then send another, lol.
---
The 40 mount is the important one I'd say, improves levelling speed drastically from 40-60 having your mount at 60 you already have the 60% mount and the 100% is just a "Bonus" that will take a lot of grind no matter the class
---
You can still get out in less than a minute if you have a friend invite 2 of your characters. If youre done with the dungeon you just log into the other one, use a reset instance macro and log back in. This should be possible in 30-40 sec depending on your PC.
---
It stopped stacking in one of the big equalization pushes blizzard did in later expansions I think.
---
I'd guess even more because each server will have a couple thousand? Were still talking 50+ in each starting zone.
---
Good point but does it really matter when you use vanish? Haven't played rogue yet
---
This is peak wow community right here, holy fuck.
---
You dont even got inv stress test. I bet. Take this note. I’m gonna send you a message after classic launch. There is no dx12 on classic. You are saying they are behind on bfa patch. But i play bfa alpha and beta. Even there bfa has dx12. There is no dx12 on classic beta. BECAUSE ITS LEGION CLIENT. And you guys no clue about game development or programming.
---
I still remember this word for word to this day. 😂
---
&gt;I'm going to be playing cat form
---
If you're a cat, you either tryhard and do decent DPS, or you're getting carried. MCPs, mana pots, runes, flask of mana regen, dragonbreath chili (not yet certain whether how good it is on Classic) + usual melee consumables.
---
If you're fine with tryharding *or* with getting carried, weapons are stat sticks; enchant them with agility because +weapon damage won't work (don't know for sure if there're situations when Iron Counterweight is better).
---
Druids in vanilla are a lot different than the druids in the expansions. In vanilla they were a true hybrid that suffered from the "jack of all trades, master of none" curse. What is your end goal in Vanilla? If its mainly PvP, 5 mans etc then feral is great, you'll have a blast. If you are planning to be a hardcore raider though you may find it harder to find  a welcoming environment as feral-I'm not saying it may not happen but it will be more challenging.
---
Now if you do wish to stay feral there are plenty of guides outlining the BiS gear for each form. When it comes to weapons they are basically stat sticks-their actual DPS, speed, damage range do NOT matter. With that said the Manual Crowd Pummeler from Gnomer is amazing due to its "use" effect. You wouldn't be using it for general mobs but in situations its simply amazing.
---
What do you mean with the "to hit" in shape shifting forms? Do you mean what is your hit cap? If so that's 9%. If you mean items(and enchants) with a chance to proc on hit effect then weapon effects wont proc in cat/bear form (so for example Crusader enchant will NOT proc and neither would the chance on hit on Sulfuras) but proc effects will work if its part of your armour/trinkets (hand of justice will proc in cat form). As to what the best enchant is it depends on your gear, your current stats and your primary role-mainly tanking or dps? Strength will give you +2 ap per point and agility will give you +1 AP per point.
---
The thing is it's going to take quite a while to design, get approval and then develop such things as a 1.13 considering the size of blizzard. I think bug testing and launch should take priority at the moment but preparing for the future in a timely manner now will save us a lot of grief years down the road. Beta testing the new content will be something to consider too.
---
I get people don't want to put the cart before the horse but if we wait until post nax there could be an immensely long content drought . The hard core fans will be fine with this but the casual flock and some hardcore raiders will want new content to consume. It's pretty healthy for the long term economics of the game and opens up the possibility via gearing for less used specs without changing game balance via lateral power specs.
---
On private servers, undead account for over 50% of horde characters. 
---
The orc racial may be op but don't disregard the importance of looking cool. Undead have the best animations for casters and rogues.
---
Damn this just got me really depressed. I hope they don’t force our upcoming classic characters back into expansions :3
---
Yes and iirc was also on a separate cool down from the trinket
---
so Seals, dont match the weapon normalization ? (3.40)
---
My first server was aegwynn eu. I didn’t know much about anything when I started, I didn’t know proplay existed at that time. But I believe it was home of the guild „Refuge“ which was really high end - so was I told at least. I just did a bg with their guildlead once and everyone recognized him.. like meeting a celebrity in the streets. 
---
Other than that this server was a shithole for horde players since the A:H ratio was really bad for them.
---
They could have a side entrance near Redridge where Horde players could enter. Alliance players would also be able to enter here for an alternative route through the dungeon.
---
Great comment, thanks! Immersion is very important to me as well, that's why I'm so focused on picking 'the right one' for me. Anyway I think you're right and I should just let it go and roll with it.
---
They're all doing their part. Blizzard obviously gave streamers access to the beta more for the marketing purpose than the testing purpose.
---
It is interesting that they took the time to reinstitute the nerfs on one of them but not the other
---
There are scammers. There are idiots. There are people who post dumb shit every day and you don't feel like reading their dumb shit again. I'm not a particularly sensitive person. I just have limited gaming time and not having to interact with idiots makes mine more enjoyable.
---
Rogues are one of the last to get thunder fury. It's almost never going to happen
---
I think that might be the case as well.
---
I also think people overestimate the power of incremental shifts in the class population. Realistically, I don't know how noticeable it would be from 9% to 12% for warlocks. I could see that happening, though, given some of the surveys/polls that have been floating around.
---
Thanks mate, hoping to cover the actual tournament soon :)
---
How do you know about summoning doomguards in capital cities? It was a common practice. Every. SINGLE. DAY. What makes you think that would suddenly change? Dont answer that. That is my answer. That is why your question is stupid.
---
haha this meme always make me laugh.
---
Anybody know what the guy is actually talking/laughing about?
---
Nah, they won't. Otherwise they'd just have people asking for classic back again, it'd be pointless.
---
But if Classic succeeds TBC servers are almost inevitable and I'd wager about 40% of the remaining vanilla population will move/copy to them, plus everyone else who just wants TBC. Should be a pretty even population split between the two.
---
1.14 is a whole other can of worms though...

---
No its not. Should I ask everyone nearby everytime I mine something, to make sure they don't want to mine it too?
---
Thank you, you answered my questions :)
---
On hit is what I meant rather than to hit 
---
So what on hit effects would you recommend for armour/armour itself?
---
I'm thinking more PvP/WPvP as I enjoy the mindset of stalking prey with absolute utility to back me up 
---
Is agility best for cats or strength?
---
I guess they are the second best option after the tank, right?
---
Not at the start atleast. You have a far bigger advantage trying to get tags with 5 people instead of only 1.
---
I was in a guild that cleared all the vanilla content prior to TBC.   
---
We personally did respect, some people say lie at times but it meant you were quickly replaced.   
---
Because damaged meters existed in vanilla. Low tier players with pvp specs would do sub par dps for their class. So we would just rotate those players out for players with the correct specs for progression.   
---
For example, minus like ignite stacking for mages etc etc, most of our classes were within %s of eachother, with a common mini game between the top dogs of DPS openly taunting and trying to one up eachother, but if you were a rogue doing 30% less damage then the next rogue you would be rotated out for another class that was more competitive. 
---
Also I want to point out that there was like no guides really at the time, like went we went into AQ40, one of our guild members got Scarab Lord, just means we opened the gates; and our only real beta was a dude with a horrible mic sharing starts with our guild leader in a private Ventrillo server. There was nothing like some dude with multiple clears of C'thun holding your hand. We just had to wing it with the information we had and go from there.   
---
So it was like, if I was raid specced, flasked, potted etc etc etc, trying my best; and you were PvP specced for your Warsong and Alterac Valley fun times but were too cheap to spend 50 gold for a chance at some of the best gear in the game, I wouldn't want to do progression with someone like that and I wasn't even an officer or a leader. 
---
A lot of us just kept PvE specs if it was PvP viable. The only thing this was kinda a problem for was warriors in a way, but most classes could PvP very well in PvE specs with raid gear. PvP stats didn't really become a thing on PvP gear till TBC.   
---
So for example, one of the first items we got off of Kel Thuzad was Soulseeker,  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=22799](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=22799) \-  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=18874](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=18874) compared to r14 staff, its just better in every way. Also negative resists in vanilla just meant bonus damage, so there is that as well. Nobody ran MR gear in BGs. 
---
It went to one of our Warlocks and to celebrate we went into an Arathi Basin. The warlock was insanely geared with plagueheart gear and fully speced for pve dps, So Conflag etc. I don't remember his exact stats but it was well over what rank 14 gear gave you. Particularly in the realm of spell damage and crit rating. What did raid locks have at that time? 30-40% crit raiting? I cant remember. Combine that with gear you didnt replace till like level 65 in TBC at the earliest and hilarious memes happen.  
---
Me, my warlock friend and a guildie druid just rushed blacksmith, I remember just dancing on the flag and the druid put hots up on the warlock and he... he just went ham on the poor poor unsuspecting players. Insane damage.   
---
Prior to the introduction of resilience gear, raid gear was legit part of the PvP meta and will be in classic as well unless they make changes.   
---
So your best bet is to be the best raider you can be and get into a top tier guild and PvP with friends on the side. Not only that, most raids will be done back to back or the following day, meaning you should only have to respec twice per week, which is expensive but not really that difficult actually.   
---
Even raid geared/spec combat rogues with  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=23221](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=23221), which was a trash drop, would melt most players in seconds.   
---
But that is naxx gear, which will be the highest end gear we know we will get in classic, but is true for BWL as well, which is easy enough for most people.   
---
Chromatic Tempered Sword/Chromaggus -  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=19352](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=19352) vs High Warlords Sword R14 -  [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=16345](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=16345) . These are pretty much the same weapons but trust me killing Chromaggus on the regular is a lot easier then getting r14.   
---
The same is for BWL casters and warriors with Staff of Shadowflame and Ashkandi being R14 equivalents.   
---
TL;DR - dont suck at raids by not speccing, reputation matters in classic and top tier players will be attracted to other top tier players. Get so much amazing damage gear that your PvE dps specc overpowers most players in PvP.
---
I dont recall ever seeing doomguards in IF, only an Inferal once in Kharanos.
---
WoW 2B.

---
Probably as pulled an extra pack
---
Blizzard has the possibility of opening 20+layers for day 1 in order to thin out the herd for each server... at least I'm hoping that's what they do, and then condense those layers into 4-5 over the next couple of days.
---
Legion client had DX version picker. In this one it's disabled.
---
Realistically the time it'll take to farm gold as resto, it'll be worth respeccing over to Ele/Enh.
---
Shamans don't have great AoE at all.
---
Solo farm as resto? Sure, herbalism and alchemy.
---
Oh thats sweet!
---
Thank you for the information :)
---
I read somewhere trinkets or rings with +weapon damage work well but I would need to clarify it
---
You'll never get them on a real server. Sorry to burst your bubble, but any raidleads are passing it to main tank.
---
He's spouting some 2006 meta. We have Feral tanks nowadays, you wont pull threat.
---
r/meatpants
---
They said that the game will be as it was in 1.12.  So warlocks will start in their buffed stats. Rogues won’t be able to do all the stuff in that world of rogue craft video.    They are still doing stage progression. But mechanics like bosses being able to have 16 debuff slots will be in the game.
---
sure ofc you can "hold back" or vanish/feint. But wouldent it be better to have it on the tank then ? so you can push threat harder, and get more DPS ?
---
Tank raids as shaman
---
I don't know if it helps, but you can check the quests for each zone on classicdb, including cities. Go database &gt; zones &gt; eastern kingdoms &gt; stormwind, and you can see all quest that starts in stormwind
---
I remember Staff of Jordan dropping for me from some mobs in swamp of sorrows. Such a cool feeling. Don't know what i did with it tho.. probably sold it to a vendor or something, lol..
---
Streamers have tons of gold to buy it tho, and their followers will just give them even more
---
At the end of the day, request invites makes wPvP infinitely easier to organize, so I hope it comes back. Muh socialization isn't a valid argument against it, since nothing is stopping you from talking to people you invite in this way.
---
If it's demoralizing to say hello to people who join your groups, maybe you're the problem. I have never had issues with mute runs in retail WoW, I have never had that issue on private servers, and I won't have it on Classic WoW.
---
I don’t play retail but u sure they removed the made by... and it’s not just made by a character that now no longer exists ?
---
alright I'll play along.  
---
Yes, you are allowed to cast your spells in WoW. Yes, you can summon a doomguard in the city. Lol...
---
Doubt they will... the people excited for tbc or wrath is considerably lower than that of Classic.
---
Wouldn't be worth their time unless modern wow hit sub 100k players - and that won't happen (no matter how bad the expansions get.
---
Live to win!
---
Here's the original story:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDiB4rtp1qw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDiB4rtp1qw)
---
Yup, 4 wings that take you through quite a few levels - real good instances (only drawback is for Alliance to travel there).
---
RFC for alliance :)
---
CN F J F K I think was no a n a l not sure if it was all caps or altered tho
---
I'll probably get crucified for saying this but I really enjoy the addition of new classes shaking up the meta, so long as they keep the same "rock, paper, scissors" mentality they had before. 
---
I want to see demon hunters who are caster killers but also weak to other melee users.
---
I want monks who are like druids but less focus on HoTs and range dps and focus on more of a rogue meets paladin. 
---
Death knights could fill the "melee caster" roll that we never really got from paladins or shaman in classic.
---
My first ever server was Bloodhoof EU (alliance side) and I can't remember anything of note happening on there. I switched to Outland not long after.
---
I usually have 2 max 3 of them while lvling
---
Awesome. By far the best/easiest to use AH addon for wow.
---
Serious raiders yes. Healers and tanks in progression guilds all roled alts for that purpose.
---
Rogues were rampant as alts back in vanilla, anyone grinding for consumables had one.
---
There were also a lot of liars who would pose as a certain spec but were quickly found out on progression fights where small details really mattered.
---
I want to try and get a Kalimdor's Revenge. Always wanted one back in vanilla and never got one even in TBC.
---
[Heh, heh! Pile on!](http://everyonegetinhere.com/)
---
I mean the guy is obviously good in retail. He just didn't show that at all in the beta. I totally forgot that really good players never make mistakes, that's my bad, totally on me.
---
What's interesting about that though is that the nerf to wotf came well after 1.12 and yet it is going to be in the game apparently.
---
Have they said if they are going to put dr on cc? If stuns have dr that could change things as well
---
This is high quality memeing. Take the updoot!
---
No, because just like battlegrounds, they come with their own set of rules that are set by the game. Some of which, iirc, are that CDs are reset between matches and that certain CDs we're unavailable.  
---
Besides, arenas -just like battlegrounds- requires a different approach to pvp that is unlike WPvP. You are able to go in it with a general plan based on your comp and can adjust based on what you're going up against. You can't really do that in WPvP. It is for this reason that I feel duels should reflect WPvP; because it is a better gauge of how one would react to WPvP. 
---
I fail to see how this red herring has anything to do with my opinion on how duels should be conducted. I gave my opinion and backed it up with my thought process. Since there is no real facts that can back up **any** opinion on the matter, all we're left with is the potential for some type of circular argument. One side has to be wrong because the other can find an argument that fits what they want that contradicts the first argument.
---
They do! According to WoWHead comments anyway. Might of Cenarius is a good thing to farm for some "semi-tryharding".
---
I used that a lot to get a free teleport, speeds up lvling
---
Omar always made the best mix tapes.
---
Lol yeah, each layer will hold something like 2-5k players... even on the lower end that's 1000 players split among 3 starting zones.
---
Stater zones will have hundreds of players.
---
*unless they want to super cater to the "tourists" and make it to where there are sub 100 players per starting zone.
---
Classic beta 7.3.5 and classic also gonna be. This is blizzard announcement not my personal thinking. I need to explain to you guys game development process and programming in general but no i’m not gonna do it. They choose legion client for rebuild.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881587/dev-watercooler-world-of-warcraft-classic
---
You can read and try to understand here. I’m just the programmer who are trying to give you right information. Not fan boi of any thoughts.
---
Why is it called "try harding"?
---
Bigger bags while leveling will directly translate to more gold.
---
Even if it was irrelevant. Which is not the case. You now have M0 instead. This whole Argument is based on ignoring other aspects of the Game.
---
Don’t worry friend. I liked your joke.
---
No 1.6 patch came before 1.12.
---
I know it’s dumb because 1.6 is a larger number but the progression went like this:
---
1.1
---
1.2
---
1.3
---
1.4
---
1.5
---
1.6 - wotfs nerf
---
1.7
---
1.8
---
1.9
---
1.10
---
1.11
---
1.12
---
AOE grinding won't be viable on launch due to how busy the zones will be. Just do questing with a few dungeons thrown in, there's nothing wrong with that.
---
I was originally planning on playing Hunter for all the usual reasons: fun and easy leveling experience, easy farming, great world PvP, great BGs, high skill ceiling; but now I've got a buddy that wants to level with me as a priest and he's ready to go as hard as I am in the initial weeks. Would playing hunter waste an opportunity to play something with a slower start but bigger payout in the end, like a warlock? We have different goals for the endgame so by 60 we'd likely part ways, making me less concerned about class synergy.
---
This video has been posted on this sub quite a bit.
---
U grinded hard cash / vendor trash at lvl 26 or AH sellable loot. Because ah wont sell for shit at start.
---
Be known on my server as a good Warrior Tank that has a lot of Enchants.
---
Also would like to complete everything to do with fishing and win the tournament a few times.
---
If someone is kiling a mob near a node, they’re killing it to get the node. Taking it just makes you a douche.
---
The main factor is that the aoe proc can fuck with threat and hit cc'd targets afaik.
---
I don't know, we really have different experiences. I have my moto G 2 since 2015 and he's still going.
---
It’s not fast than a flight path but it is faster than flying. Pus you can jump of anytime.
---
It's a damn good question, but idk, English isn't my native language :D
---
Im the opposite, I need to clear the 25H version. But I occasionally have similar feelings when I end up clearing a new raid for the first time in LFR “huh, I guess I saw it all - why even come back”
---
I miss the mystique of the dungeons.
---
Correct, SoComm isn't a normalised attack, at least not in the way yellow attacks by warriors are (mortal strike, bloodthirst, etc) and is instead normalised around it's 7ppm. Making an ideal weapon speed of 3.8, anything 3.4 or less you should be using SoR
---
Agreed. It’s why I like levelling paladins and also why I like playing on PVE realms. I just load up a Nobbel video or similar and chill.
---
...What hate?
---
As I said, I have a really good game to suggest to you. Retail WoW.
---
It has all the "advantages" you want.
---
In my opinion wotf is the strongest pvp racial after hardiness so UD will still be a great choice.
---
Is go with ud if visuals are important to you
---
Full stacks of each scarab out of AQ.
---
I bought a cheap cloth headscarf juts to wear something!
---
I am still looking for a hat
---
Or people can be mature. I'll happily report all y'all.
---
Nice binds m8 :^)
---
I remember wen this dropped on my hunter and I equipped it, those were sad times
---
To be fair, every private server with that population had near instant-respawn on mobs due to Dynamic Respawn. It won't be like that on launch.
---
Will be interesting, but could foresee it being an absolute disaster with 5 minute respawns.
---
To answer your question, mages are top tier levellers when AOE grinding, but still pretty good at levelling as single target.
---
The main issue is the major need to drink (after 3 or so mobs), so there’s a lot of downtime. Still, you won’t be slower than warriors, priests or paladins at levelling. Around middle of the pack in terms of levelling speed.
---
You’ll want to be frost specced, with points in frostbite/shatter. Basic rotation is to frostbolt until mob gets close, frost nova, get further away and frostbolt/wand until mob is dead. Personally, I’m intending to roll a single target frost mage to level, because I just love seeing those massive shatter crits.
---
It’s pretty much 1/3 ever so slightly under
---
ive never understood this argument. grounding totem, earthshock and windfury will wreck you alot faster than any pally will as a lock.
---
How retarded are you people?
---
Even in the clip at 22 seconds you can see its a mace.
---
Fuck me this sub has some real idiots.
---
Snowflake PC losers like you should be perma muted
---
You know what, you are right
---
I was reading that as 1.1.2 and not 1.12
---
Nope. Being forced made classic forums unbearable and full of whiners.
---
You guys forget that a lot of QoL things we have in the game today is because people were not asking but demanding them with the most horrible forum posts imaginable. It will soon be very similar, about 2 weeks into classic release it will be full spread.
---
Do you know about a CM who completely lost it and went off on players on the forums and lost his job because of it?
---
Personally, I don't want TBC. I just want TBC's "actually hybrids can do more than just heal without getting laughed at" talent design and "here is *very slightly* more buttons to press" combat.
---
Fully agree
---
It's missing "and then we only invited half of one server population! EEEEEEEHHHHEEEHEHEEE"
---
This song is suddenly relevant again!  CLASSIC WOW INCOMING.
---
Yes it was what game did you play.  In wpvp the warrior would get a charge.  The only way to avoid it would be to chase after the warrior after duel request which is petty and stupid and not in the spirit of the duel.  
---
Manners?
---
Sure, but only if they make dungeon content difficult. As it stands now, that's pointless, there still will be no social interaction because there's 0 need to unless you're on high level mythic +, in which case you're already manually grouping.
---
Touché :P
---
Interesting, something that I haven't heard in the years of periodic play
---
Exploring for Xp til they're high enough for dead mines
---
Ahahahah, I'm glad to meet some like-minded people sometimes. Some weeks ago after reading some disturbing threads here I made a post stating that maybe 14 years later is not worthy to jeopardize loved ones for Classic Wow.
---
God I was eaten alive.
---
I will be a tank and sure the first one will go to the MT, but with the second and third rogues will start to discuss
---
Unless you have access to the original unmixed tracks this ain’t a remaster.
---
You level up faster, farm more easily, and even get PvP ranks more quickly.  Plus there should be a lot less trolls on PvE servers.  I understand that plenty of people like ganking lowbies, and it is funny to watch videos of people getting trolled, but I'll definitely enjoy a PvE server more, lol.
---
Same, I started in vanilla and dont even remember it not being there.
---
I didnt play horde until Cata though.
---
Not sure on this one but I heard TF won't break CCs
---
Legit I got kicked once for saying "hi".
---
Retail WoW is pure cancer.

Cheeky bastard.
---
The funniest thing is, when you go to bed and wake up the next day and the first thing you do is log on, just to see whether you actually only dreamed it.
---
Can't be the only one who distrusted great drops with a "This is too good to be true"-attitude :D
---
I disagree for pve. Fearward is good for only a few fights (admittedly ony/nef are serious early on) but the 5% spirit scales much better with gear, and the longer fights. Pvp though id say dwarf is better than human
---
It's missing "and then after getting hundreds of thousands to resub, we only invited half of one server population! EEEEEEEHHHHEEEHEHEEE"
---
Well, stupid people deserve to be laughed at I guess
---
It's kind of sad how irritable retail players are when they've already had the process streamlined to the point where they get teleported to the dungeon with a couple of clicks.
---
Like just the other day, I was doing timewalking with randoms and not halfway through there's a vote to kick the tank. True, the tank wasn't doing a great job, I spent a lot of time healing the mage instead of the bear, but it was fine. We never wiped once and I think maybe only one of us ever died. But this dude would rather kick the tank than try to help them out, or just finish the dungeon since it makes little difference in the end.
---
I hope Classic is better, I missed the chance to play it the first time around, but one thing I feel like retail lacks is any sense of belonging to a community.
---
These videos make it seem like regular questing is literal hell where you need a tank and a healer or a class with unlimited CC.
---
A rogue partnered with any class will fuck shit up. Same goes for any duo really as long as they both do decent dps.
---
The LFG system makes the concept of an MMO useless. Might as well be playing a phone ap at that point.
---
Do you work at Blizzard? ;)
---
Let's wait and see. I think they'll incorporate the DX12 code sometime.
---
&gt;The beta is pretty freaking dead
---
For you maybe. When you have 50,000 people watching your location in near real time it's different. You can even see this if you watch them, groups of players from other factions show up all the time to kill them and then camp their bodies. They had to get a warlock to summon Esfand yesterday but cause of this.

I did the same thing when trying to get BACK to Mulgore from Orgrimmar during the stress test. I ran back and forth outside of Org trying to find that blasted tower I could have sworn was there before the revamp of the city. 
---
Had to result to patch notes to discover that it was added in Wrath...
---
Hey that's me!

I'd like to say I think they upped the droprate of BoE's since the level cap increase. Since the patch, I've played for \~30-ish hours and I've dropped 6 blue items and 2 purples (Staff of Jordan + Dazzling Longsword). The longsword went to Fyzicul the Shaman, but still seen them drop. I've also seen another person that I've played with drop the Fiery War Axe, another purple all in just 2 days. Maybe it's just super lucky RNG, maybe not. Thought I'd share :)
---
As a resto shaman I make tons of money from fishing/herb/alchemy. Killing isn't good, although I went to the cave for greater nature protection potion recipe and with shocks and WF few green mobs die and excess recipes also sold nicely. Gold farming is not the only way to get it. 100g has no value if you can't buy things because they aren't listed ;)

noic, he can cover many months of subs when it finally launches

Good bot but... Bad bot. *rolls up newspaper*
---
I get what you mean in a general sense, but it doesn't apply in this particular instance
---
The equivalent to ZG became 10 mans. That's a bad argument.

Addiction and an over abundance of narcissism and self worth make people believe that they are special, that they will be the ones to get in, because they above all others DESERVE beta. 
---
That, my friends, is what we call a fool. And a lot of people enjoy taking them for all they have without anyone asking if it was wrong. Blizzard exploited a lot of hyped up folks, and like always they fell for it.
---
We were always trying to steal other guilds strategies. It was like it was a trade secret. It was tough to figure out most of bwl without having some idea or plan. Our very first pull in bwl half the raid was still outside the gate. We sat and watched as our friends ran around dying. Good times. 
---
Suppression room was hell. One person would always lag out or dc right in the middle.
---
I think it's a self-irony of the similar kind as "elitist jerks". You don't actually need to be a jerk to be interested in theorycrafting the mechanics. Likewise, people who like making their chars as good as possible don't need to perceive it as (futile) "hard" attempts.
---
And after all these years it’s the parents computers that I am constantly getting rid of virus’ on. That computer I played WoW on? Hasn’t had an anti-virus or a problem and still runs today..
---
Depends on your class. 
---
My rogue I pretty much stayed combat swords all the time.  It wasn't the 100% perfect PvP spec but it was good enough.
---
My Druid I respeced a lot more because you can't really do much efficiently out in the world as full healing spec. 
---
But most people stayed 1 spec because 50g a respec is pretty expensive.
---
Why would you care that much for a beta invite ? There is a  good chance you get burned out before it comes out or you loose interest fast . Unless you wanna test quest/grind spots/routes
---
Makes sense :)

you're looking for "emphasis", not logic. though I mostly agree with you.
---
One of the best hunter weapons in the game.
---
Well, I loved TBC but if they plan on going 1.13+ route it's fine too. If they never add fly mounts, and they add arenas, I'm happy
---
This move was again half soulless marketing strategy and half exploitation of the weak gambling genes of most of the nowadays well conditioned gamers. I just find half of that repulsive...
---
Duo leveling is great until you go to sleep, your partner says he will only stay logged on for some more time to catch up on proffesions then you come back the next day and he hasn't slept, got 3 more levels and it ends there.
---
Don't expect to be duo leveling too much. It will happen here and there and you'll be grouping up quite a lot if you want but the only way to make it work is if you both agree to playing at the same time all the time a d actualy filllw through with it.
---
Grinding with very specific quests that are right in your area, that's the fastest xp/hour, and also generates more gold. Though you tend to run into gear issues.
---
Nice, I didn’t play on DW till BC, but I recognize the guild name and the hunters name.
---
You don't need to walk. You can fly to Org without having the flight path, at least if you're doing the quests in Mulgore.
---
Awesome site! Any chance you can add ratings and the ability to sort by them? Also, it would be good to have category filters/tags, so that you could look into all the add-ons that are marked with a certain tag. Basically anything that allows for easy sorting/filtering as the list of add-ons gets really long. As if now, it seems like I am only able just able to scroll through the entire list of add-ons?
---
Ill be playing as a priest aswell.
---
I plan on leveling as a shadow and respec at level 40(wandspec into shadowform) and level 59/60( depends if im going to hit 60 grinding dungeons as a healer or just queat/grind it out on my own).
---
Theres really no benefit of respecing more than that as you can perfectly fine heal as shadow keeping in mind 5sr and downranking the spam spell, especially higher levels when you start investing some points into disc dor stronger shields and extra mana regen.
---
Opinions. I couldnt disagree more.
---
It's excellent for any caster aside from locks, the spirit is a bit of a waste.
---
Honestly, just getting 60. I don’t know if I can commit to 1 character for hundreds of hours. It would be nice though
---
Didn't they do a bunch of the 30-35 quests so they pretty much had to grind somewhere?
---
I'm not sure the chance of world PvP vs sitting around waiting on mob respawns would be more interesting but could have been
---
It's missing "and then after getting hundreds of thousands to resub, we only invited half a server worth! EEEEEEEHHHHEEEHEHEEE"
---
So, link to the blizzard announcement. Because that link didnt mention anything about what the client is based on. It was early post from a year ago talking generally what they are doing.
---
It's ownedcore. I'd be shocked if they haven't already reverse-engineered a working sandbox.
---
Yeah do that with your party at Launch :)
---
I created a spotify playlist for wow pvp music, let me know if I need to add anything.  https://open.spotify.com/user/phocasqt/playlist/0FDE85YiO7NSq27LKE31w9?si=mk5n9UzVTWOSvXcK6_MLoQ
---
Dude, it's Chromie...
---
Complete every single quest in the game with my main, and then level every character to 60 😊 will probably take me a couple of years.
---
It's.. a lot more cerebral.
---
Still better value than an apple monitor stand.
---
In a 40 capped server too. Wow!!!
---
Following yours
---
He didn't elaborate. Just to say that the community sometimes comes up with ways of bypassing mechanics in the game that were not conceived to be solved the way they were, and it was not intended to force guilds to gear up 8 tanks.
---
It blows my mind that a company like Blizzard doesn't keep backups for life. They have the means.
---
It's just crazy to me that they don't have backups for every major patch (1.0, 1.1 etc...).
---
And every dps blasts a different target
---
Hey Fellow KTer.  Played horde in ViolentSin, well known for Shiektal's pug AQ groups.
---
Thank you I feel the same way. I mained a female nelf rogue when I was 13 - 16 from BC to WotLK and always thought those excuses were bullshit even back then.
---
It's not a bad faith argument at all. New raid = new patch. Some people would rather see the integrity of Classic completely preserved and not even chance having that fucked up, especially with TBC is pretty much guaranteed to be good. 
---
You are making a bad faith argument and projecting it on people that you know are legitimately concerned with Blizzard fucking this up. 
---
I think most of us would be happy with either TBC or 1.13 whichever they chose, TBC is just the surefire way to success where 1.13 would leave the door open for them to do irreparable damage to the game.
---
One is enjoyable to use, the other is a piece of crap imo.
---
Thanks for the reply! Mate, I have the same issue. I rolled 2 Mages on naughty servers and I never made it past lvl 20, feels boring indeed. I did play a Mage on a lvl 60 vanilla naughty server for a few days and it was alright.
---
My reasoning for not playing Warlock is:
---
1. I already leveled a Lock to lvl 60 before and done some endgame stuff
---
2. The raiding was quite boring to me. Curse + Shadowbolt, sometimes Lifetap
---
3. You can never go full-throttle because of threat issues
---
4. Leveling is great, but again you'll pull aggro from the Voidwalker lots and lots of times - which is annoying
---
5. TBH I don't even really like playing with pets. Yes I know the DM/Ruin spec for raiding, but during other activities it's best to have a pet out
---
6. I like Warlocks in world PvP, BG's not so much. They feel slower and less dynamic than mages 
---
7. Soul Shards. Not as bad as people make them out to be, but still. Not the greatest mechanic in the game
---
8. Summoning lazy people is annoying. It really is. The first few times you feel helpful and all, but it gets old fast. I helped a lot with world bosses like Azuregos as well, being there early and summoning people 
---
9. Their tier sets look amazing, but the only one that's actually good is Plagueheart. Nemesis is my love, but there's so many items that are simply better. Guess what I'm trying to say is: they have cool sets, but it's not rewarding to wear them
---
10. I don't have \*that\* much time on my hands playing Classic. Farming gold, Soul Shards, getting to the raid early to summon and then not even really enjoying the raid experience itself because of boring rotation, just doesn't feel right to me. 
---
So, those are my reasons. Typing them out helped me a little bit extra in solidifying that I don't want to roll a Lock I guess :)
---
R10 or higher, considering i dont have endless hours anymore. Clearing some more casual raids is expected but i would really like lt. commander or higher
---
I think it's the increasing complexity of class design over time. There's an engagement sweet spot where you're doing more than nothing (so it's still stimulating and not boring) but don't actually have to pay attention (it's not difficult or demanding).
---
Just dont make a gearscore addon
---
For me it was that the games are generally not designed for long term playability. I got to a point in blade and soul where I can go grind for nearly useless upgrades or just pvp within 2 weeks, if i remember correctly. They are successful in korea cause the arena style combat keeps a steady playerbase + hype content trailers with shitty final product draws in western fans.
---
Well if you go human you don't even need Maladath if i remember correctly since the racial weapon skill is enough .But if as we see it now giving it a prot warrior is probably the best thing to do, rogues will do dmg anyway but the advantage it gives to threat generation is beyond godlike.
---
See how awesome this is? This is why Classic wins.
---
Laggramar eu...
---
Yeah, but conflag locks have way better peels than SM/Ruin
---
Well, yeah, but you realize this is fan-made, vs blizz's CGI trailers literally cost hundreds of thousands to make?
---
cant wait to see it in action, AUX is a staple in private servers.
---
The game was made to be played how you like, streamer or not.  It's wrong to be efficient and only doing dungeons?  So a streamer can say wasting time doing quests and sitting at mobs is a disservice to the game.  
---
If you like to grind dungeons, please do so!
---
Gamers: "Beta is just the finished product used only for PR now, I miss finding bugs and being able to see the game early on."
---
Also Gamers: "WTF THERE'S BUGS IN THE BETA THIS IS STUPID BLIZZARD SUX"
---
raiding is harder on classic compared to the private servers from what we have been told.
---
Private server raid bosses hit less often or something? i dont remember exactly what the difference was
---
Except thats only teue for normal and heroic dungeons. Everyone does mythics, not even counting M+ so everyone will know where all the dungeons are. Im not defending BfA by any means but this is just a dumb post
---
If you people don't have the patience to wait out a fucking BETA for the full release in 2 months, you have much bigger problems on your hands than a videogame. Bunch of entitled fools.
---
He won't have a link, because he's either a retard or a troll
---
&gt; I've had plenty of runs that were going badly become easy as soon as the bad player left. 
---
I once went along with a group as paladin healer. The Warrior was a total asshole, constantly overpulled and rushed when others were OOM. When the third boss in ZF didn't drop what he wanted he left.    
---
Group asked if I wanted to tank while the druid took over healing. I admitted to never having tanked and they still were okay. We finished the rest of the instance as a 4 man group and it was smooth sailing all the way (when I finally got the hang of the threat mechanics)

Warlock and Shadow Priest work well as a Duo. Warlocks shadow exposure only helps increase both your DPS and your pets later come with a built in tank.
---
That way, whilst your pal is offline you can continue developing your Hunter.
---
they know if they added a shop they’d insta lose a massive amount of subs and therefore make less money. don’t worry it’s not gonna happen
---
wow that 3.90 speed is sweet
---
I played on EU-Magtheridon. Famous for The guild Nihilum and for The elitist player thtat refered to all other realms as lesser realms.
---
I keep trying to find the video again but my realm maelstrom Was famous for beach troll sex. In a video a paladin came over and saw them on the beach.... killed them both...he zooms in at the end of the video of them first making out...and the caption is "did i mention they were both dudes" cant find the video but it was made by frumps or something like that i think.
---
Yes, that´s the main point I have. TF might be viable for rogues, but for Tanks it is way beyond everything else. Without any question.
---
Weaponskill cap is 8 in Classic so it will still have a slight increase but it´s sure worth more on non humans.
---
&gt; Hand that bad boy over to Snutz or Venruki for max beta fun times.
---
ZOOM ZOOM
---
As an owner of a resturant that follows this ethos, i totally agree. Keep it simple stupid. K.i.s.s
---
Enjoy the game, goof around, level up, play with friends.
---
total mad pleberino. stahp already my nibba. go get some fresh air.
---
Classic will not have dynamic respawns.  If the respawn is 5 minutes, it's 5 minutes if 1 or 10 people are there.
---
Classic will have layering.
---
Yeah ... sure is.
---
Wrong but I'm not going go spend the time looking for a source, a good day!
---
Because no one wants legion DX9 / DX11 switch. They want only dx11 so they can work 3d imlpementations and bug fixing only for dx11 not both lol.
---
So basically, great for heavy bulk storage of data you won't use frequently, poor for data you'll use every day and read/write to often, e.g. gaming.
---
Dropped for me once when leveling with a buddy, I didn't know jack about it though or it's worth so I undercutted whatever was on the AH for a quick buck.
---
Ended up making 400g and split it between us.
---
They destroyed the original backups?
---
I distinctly remember getting a quest to deliver some meats in TB from X-roads and having a 45min timer on it. You were expected to walk there in that time-frame. They added the dialog to ask the flightmaster to give you a ride later I think but I might be mistaken.
---
I'm a simple man, i see a me and the boys meme, i upvote.
---
u got some more bleach to share?
---
I like money a lot (which is why I am doing it) but I'm also 2 meters tall, do you have any recommendations for BiS lists?
---
2 meters = 6,56168 feet for all our american friends
---
Oh for sure. IF everyone actually knows them and has BiS. This doesn't mean I will necessarily end up with a group of such convenient individuals though ;P I like your optimism and confidence though haha
---
Can you get Ip ban for selling account?
---
Bigger than bfa?
---
Sending this clip to Kevin Jordan asap
---
What is your twitch username
---
I think the prices are fake. I doubt anyone pay that much unless he has brain cancer or so.
---
True. Personally I'd definitely rather do a quest chain than grind though.
---
Wow, I didn't know that! Thanks!
---
Wasn't there a quest reward for a dagger or something with +Dmg to beasts? Sounds like a niche use
---
It actually seemed like a knee-jerk reaction to me and probably what my exact reaction would be. He just looted it and realized after what it was lol
---
Umm i cant say but is there a website or something?
---
Which is why eventually we get Naxx, equivalent to high level mythics, but without an easy mode.
---
Your "easy" mode raids are Onyxia and MC. Enjoy them. But you don't deserve access to harder raids just because you're a sub. Go **earn** victory and prestige in your **community.**
---
Because no one wants legion DX9 / DX11 switch. They want only dx11 so they can work 3d imlpementations and bug fixing only for dx11 not both lol. They are implement 2006 graphics, even dx9 new for that. So you need to pick one if you want quick deadline for the project and why you even bother with dx9 in the first place. Its outdated. Dx11 right choice because of that.
---
And that company would be wasting money and should probably get someone else to make decisions about what hardware to buy for it. 
---
I don't care who you are, rich or poor, individual or company, professional or amateur, if you buy a $200 vesa adapter, you are a moron and should be laughed at.
---
Dwarf is pretty much universally accepted as the best priest race. Fear ward is much better than healing a handful of points more.
---
Humans are good enough already, they are the top race for all melee dps. And the rep bonus is pretty much the best possible passive effect one can get, so humans might even be preferred over gnomes for mages and locks, as the 5% int isn't that big. But forgoing fear ward solely for a few points of spirit and a rep boost is not optimal.
---
The stealth detection is nice in pvp, yes, but the person you run around in pvp with is, most likely, a warrior, who will be human anyway and protecting that person with a fear ward is also really good.
---

Oh does it now?
---
Where in there they say they will not use newer BFA clients, EVER ? Like you claimed. BFA was released 3 months before that blizzcon show. They had a demo ready for the event (that i played).
---
That demo was 7.3.5, yeah. But you claimed they would NEVER update it to BFA client and that you had announcement of it from blizzard ?
---
The people buying it want beat so they can work on their bots.
---
Some people just have a lot of money. Believe me, there are way stupider ways to spend $1400 that people do every day.
---
Point taken and I apologize, this probably should have gone on the main sub. I know classic === vanilla but it was more of me just reminiscing on twinking back in a more "classic" period of wow.
---
dew boeth
---
you can get hardware ID banned, of everyone involved.
---
&gt; Lich King was a major lore pay-off. Putting him behind a giant barrier and hiding him away from the masses would be a disaster. Many people remember WOTLK fondly because *THEY* killed the Lich King. 
---
Watch it on Youtube then.
---
**You** didn't achieve victory if you did it on easy mode.
---
How your comment is upvoted in a wow classic subreddit is beyond me. Everything you said is the antithesis of the WoW Classic Ethos.
---
TBH I don't fully understand what you mean :b
---
A. Would you like to know more about why this is my name? 
---
B. Do you want to give me new name suggestions? \^\^
---
You don't make basic mistakes like that. Not repeatedly.
---
They probably are second best. Maybe fury warriors but without a threat dump its probably a pain to use it. It takes so long to get a thunder fury chances are you've got better options by then.
---
How is that a disappointment? I would kill to be in your shoes, experiencing Azeroth for the first time again!
---
It won't be added until it's added
---
For now i am just excited for the actual release. But thinking of the future, there is only one thing i wanna see and that is 1.13+
---
I loved BC 100%. But i want to see more classic style Content. I loved that MC and stuff kept viable for so long even u were raiding newer raids. I dont want to expand the map with Outlands, making Azeroth feel more empty. No flying and so on.
---
I prefer them to do more Content for Azeroth, no big power creeps. Awesome and challenging questlines and atunements like Onyxia or AQ. The sense of community in classic and just everything about Vanilla is so awesome and i'd much rather explore a new raid, new quests, slightly better gear etc than going into BC.
---
I loved the Raids in BC, the atunements for it, the heroic dungeons and everything. But flying, shattrath, more power creeps, lvl 60 content and gear irrevelant, azeroth getting irrelevant, BC probably dividing the community once again more into "casuals and hardcore pve'rs", battlegrounds will be laughed at cuz you "only compete" in arena. Nah, fuck that. 
---
I hope Blizz will continue on Vanilla and maybe for those who want BC, give them what they want but probably all together would be too much, no idea.
---
First day on the internet? Have you not seen how much some people pay for *pets* in WoW, let alone months of beta access?
---
these things have been developed by private servers already, of course owners of a private server have access to gm and dev tools.
---
... you're literally proving his point?
---
I know a guy who paid 6000 euro for hand of ragnaros on a pserver ...
---
you’ll be able to get groups as either, and as for leveling once you’re 60 you’re done. think what playstyle you prefer and what is more pleasing for you mechanically. what class would you most enjoy going to help your boys clear a dungeon?
---
Damage well
---
Heal well
---
Pick one.
---
As a Shaman main in vanilla, you can only do one well at a time.
---
P sure blizzard recently confirmed that they have forced respawn within 20 seconds as well
---
I was a rogue back then and in our guild we had only one human rogue and in total we were 4 rogues in raids if i remember correctly with almost the same gear. The human rogue was like 1% ahead of the rest of us due to the weapon skill racial though he tried maladath combinations aswell but the diminishing returns made it not worthy. 
---
After a while we recruited a Nelf rogue with TF and the dmg difference was huge between the rest of us but as i think of it today i would totally give it to a prot warrior rather to another dpser because the advantages of having a really good tank are more than having one dps higher than the rest. Just a personal opinion after 15 years have passed :)
---
It's a scale. WoW was more casual than EQ, a bit. That doesn't mean you swing all the way in the other direction. It's a small incremental step, and we shouldn't take two. We're going back to classic, not WoTlk.
---
others have had active bids from fairly big ownedcore members for over 1 grand, i wouldnt say 1400 is impossible.
---
  From seeing threads of  the few that have sold, that multiple accounts have sold or rented for $1000 USD. intriguing stuff but very sad for both parties.
---
Ty! Then with r1 rejuv I shall roll

Deleting posts like madman, answering to comments all day long with nonsenses. IQ64 right here, chimpanzee have like 70 and can even eat bananas properly.
---
I mean its a problem very specific to the launch day. But without insane respawning rates, some classes like hunters with near instant tagging will jump way ahead of the pack. Melee would be completely screwed.
---
You speak truth, but this subreddit is already infested with an endless stream of casuals who don't understand the essence of classic. 
---
Clearing dungeons was about the prestige of seeing the content, not just the loot. You don't deserve access unless you earn it, period.
---
Freedom in restriction. It's a funny paradigm.
---
The relog reset was definitely in vanilla. I used it myself briefly (iirc it was - invite someone, promote them to leader, quit party, relog, and you would be at the beginning of the instance again).
---
From what I understand, it works differently, but I could be way off.
---
Sounded like it'd respawn a boar, if the zone is void of boars for example, but nothing like the super quick respawns of pservers.
---
Guess only time will tell. It'll be fine to play either way, if people aren't easily deterred by a bit of inconvenience early and if they are, well that solves the problem too :D
---
Well but the real sale values on most Threads are 300-500$ from what I aknowledged. So I dont think 1450$ Is the real Bet, it is prob. between 500-600 $ which is sill much :D

Not a capital but Feathermoon Stronghold (Feralas) has always felt special to me.

---
That's your issue for not cultivating the community you want to be a part of.
---
Mythic yeah, but if this guy just leveled or has only done heroic, then he may very well not actually know where the dungeons are. The LFD system was the beginning of the drop of retail wow.
---
tbh hopefully layering wont completely annihilate this, it’s such a hype moment. i don’t mind taking a while in the starting zone because of huge populations, once you’ve done it that’s it. it will be a memorable moment and everyone will be excited!
---
I know right. If it’s not on the main bar, I probably didn’t use it much.
---
Gotta score those likes and smash that subscribe button, and have you tried Audible?
---
in a warlock MT meta rogues get TF priority, remember that when deciding who gets to MT
---
Agreed and I don't believe they are touching respawn rates - that's why it's super interesting as to what their "layering" is capable of and if it's fluid enough to change on a large scale on the go.
---
We'll see, I'm just not looking forward to trying to log in for 1-2 hours while steamers get in within 10 minutes :)

What happens if you change hardware? :D
---
People are stupid. I know a guy who sold his s4 r1 gladiator retri on pserver for 800 euros.

oh yeah! I forgot literally everyone's class quests were there so you had to go over what everyone needed to do when you got in.

Good, fuck paladins and their dumb blessings.

A man is allowed to dream, he should not live in it.

i think so
---
So is classic wow using the modern API rather than the original API from vanilla?
---
They didn't catch on in the mobile market.
---
If you're filling the ignore list that fast then the problem is you.

low supply, high demand = this :)

stay away from sugar my friends!

I remember sending people to dalaran crater on my mage. Not a vanilla story, obviously, but it made my heart happy to explain to someone who demanded a port to dalaran that sometimes the portal just malfunctions, nothing i can do about it.

tbh I would do the same, if I have spare Accounts, I mean Beta who get deleted vs 1000$ for what ever no?
---
Ya'll can find fucking anything to complain about I swear.
---
I think the renting thing is hilarious...
---
May have been a skill issue, +5 weaponskill shoud be much more then 1% if equaly equiped and skilled
---
then you would have spent a pile of money buying new hardware, and your account would still be perma banned. You can spoof hardware ID bans, but really why bother unless you have a bot army.
---
Clear every single instance in the game multiple times
---
Get full dungeon set 0 and eventually upgrade it to tier 0.5.
---
Google is your friend
---
Naw, thats totally fabricated as a joke.  There was way, WAY less going on back then, you didn't need all that info at all.
---
I don't know. I click the app icon, the app opens, and it works.
---
No need to spend 2k USD on something that does basically the same thing in a sparkier way
---
This post is the peak of laziness.
---
not true man, stoneform is unbelievably good against rogues, warriors, and UD shadow priests, as well as hunters to an extent
---
perception can be useful.  sword/mace skill is awesome.  5% spirit and 5% intellect are really good.  escape artist is incredible.   Shadowmeld has it's uses.
---
desperate prayer and fear ward are both very good
---
really i think horde racials are a little bit more pvp-oriented and alliance ones pve oriented, but there's not much in it.  If it wasn't for will of the forsaken i think alliance ones would be better overall
---
Honeatly,dont roll warrior (or nelf for that matter).
---
Seeing how warrior will be the most played class by far rolling literally anything else will be much better than rolling just another crappy warrior
---
It will be very close to vanilla  1.12
---
These are not mutually exclusive. The devs are based for restoring the old game, but that doesn't say anything about their ability to make changes that are good for the game.
---
Ye, I know what you mean have also thought about selling, seeing as blizzard are equal scumbags  but at the end of the day I guess it comes down to is $1450 dollars is worth the account that has provided a lot of memories.
---
lmgtfy.com
---
That's only 11 days played assuming it takes you 60 seconds to kill a mob, eat and move on.
---
Not including travel + vendor time.
---
Laziest post of the year?
---
itt: people learn wealthy people exist and that people spend money on things they like
---
I'd say there's a difference between "an invite is not guaranteed" and "getting an invite is basically like winning the lottery." It's a fair criticism. If they're going to invite almost nobody - and close to literally nobody outside NA - they have an obligation to mention that. Instead they totally neglected to say anything whatsoever that might compel some people not to resub. It's extremely scummy at best, and borderline fraudulent in reality.
---
They were also outright dishonest about something:
---
\&gt; While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test
---
We now know that being a streamer or on a streamer's F&amp;F list is how most people got in. Opting in is not the primary way, that's simply false. People who merely opted in and weren't on some kind of list had a chance so small that it's not even worth hoping for. They deliberately made it sound like simply opting in and subbing gave you a reasonable chance when in fact the chance is probably one in a hundred thousand.
---
There's clearly room for way more beta testers. There's enough right now for one medium-sized server, but spread out across two servers. It's not like this is the limit. While Blizzard wouldn't want millions of people in the beta, requiring a sub and then saying literally nothing about the fact that it would be an unusually tiny and exclusive beta is frankly a scam. That's raw, unadulterated bullshit that honestly shouldn't be defended like that.
---
It's hilarious to me the mental gymnastics that people employ to rationalize why it's fine to require subbing for a chance to get into the beta and then almost nobody gets in. Like, what? The kind of absurd apologist nonsense that we're hearing in this sub is just beyond bizarre. People make it seem like Blizzard were impeccably transparent and the beta is bursting at the seams so they couldn't possibly invite any more.
---
One of the few exceptions here are talent trees. The feeling like I'm building my own character is much better than an a la carte ability menu.
---
that is the retail approach to the game, lots of people are going to be doing just that come August. They will be the first ones to bitch and moan that the game is boring at max level. Classic is about the journey!
---
imo this is partially why (and cause... easy blizzard bucks) blizzard required you to have an active sub to get into beta, avoid people making mass accounts and selling any that actually got a beta invite.
---
I'm playing on a private server and I grouped up with 3 others for that barrow den quest in Teldrassil. We got lost a couple times and wiped twice but it was fucking great.
---
twitch culture is weird af, I think I am finally reaching that age where I "dont get those keeds"
---
I disagree with the meeting stones allowing teleport, this is a key function of the Warlock class (and a in some respect the Mage teleport) it starts to remove class diversity and this becomes a slippery slope
---
Iirc the instance gate in Stormwind was supposed to lead to housing. But it was never implemented.
---
Here's my 2 cents, ok so say your going to do 1.13, what about the fucked specs? TBC fixes Boomkin, Shadow P., Feral Tanks, Ret, Prot, Enhancement, Elemental. So do you add those fixes or leave them gimped?
---
Agreed, pet management can be done entirely with macros and isn't as hard as it looks.
---
Unfortunately I live in the UK :(( would’ve been nice to have some WoW friends! Cheers for the offer, message me if you ever move to Europe ahah
---
i used to use the tram a lot in vanilla &lt;3 i like it
---
also boats and zeppelins aren't exactly faction specific ;)
---
It probably won't in Classic. People are selfish and just don't care about harmless think that do not benefit them.
---
It's for the same reason that most hybrid mains will tell you that they would be fine with dualspec / cost reduction, while raid-only players / pure spec class players will tell you to go to hell.
---
Honestly, the only consequences having respec that cost so much are having many people suboptimally specced for raid and having to lie, or players not playing the spec they really want to because of social pressure and being broke. Why is that a thing? I don't know.
---
Not everyone has the time / class to farm 50-100g 1 or more times a week strictly for  respeccing (because gold is needed for other reasons as well).
---
No thanks. Mtn Dew is pretty nasty, and  I wouldn't want to incentivize drinking their swill.
---
Laggramar us!
---
What headphones do you use, if you don't mind me asking? 😀
---
me too
---
Oddly enough one of our vendors offered me a job in the UK, but after talking with my wife we turned it down, so it’s not far out of the realm of possibility! Cheers, and enjoy classic!
---
The stuff that hurricane makes would be cool, and I heard some rumors he's been hired by blizzard so...you never know.
---
Gotta love clicking those pummels :D
---
Imagine being a melee class in a world where every time a mob responds someone is casting a spell at it before you can tag it. Human starting zone will be OP because no hunters To steal all the tags.
---
 And I'm not even touching the conspiracy theories about streamers
---
I don't know what that mean, but anyway look at the tag. :P
---
For pvp you want agility for sure as it gives you crit, ap and dodge. Strength was for plate wearers. When I played my druid back in TBC, all I did were battlegrounds (so much that I became exalted with the Horde forces and got the Conquerer title), and used to tear shit up with stacked agility.
---
Would be interesting to get a combined poll, for faction and class. Even more so faction/race/class but there would be a lot of options...
---
Ha! Always knew filthy Alliance was dickless
---
Reported
---
Agility it is!
---
yes, limiting this limits the issues reported due to DX12 differences. DX9 isn't supported by the modern client. It needs certain amount of DX11 support (Tier 3 or higher Resource binding support) and already warns on Fermi (like GTX 570) that it's not a supported GPU. If there won't be any blockers then they should allow for DX12 before the launch too. Would likely improve performance on modern APUs.
---
Also why they didn't give out keys. Keys can be bought and sold.
---
/train as a male gnome, the worse sound in the world.
---
If they allow us to use our ancient codes I don’t think that the mount competence will be granted. Otherwise yeah I agree with you : that would be sick AF and completely a game breaker
---
We  will have layers.
---
Shaman healer is perfectly viable in all aspects of the game including endgame raiding. Chain heal is the best raidheal option and NR totem is god in AQ20 (and don't forget agi/strength/wf).
---
Sure if you wanna stack healers you will end up stacking priests but your average raiding guild will NOT be benching good resto shamans.
---
Sure thing man, good luck and have fun!
---
They may technically be able to, but no. No they can't.
---
You too :)
---
This. If they were just upfront and honest about the beta being exclusive, really more of a PR exercise, then a lot of people wouldn't have resubbed. They knew exactly what they were doing.
---
No red eyes on the bloodfang hood!
---
Grinding DM:E lashers as a mage is therapeutic, I hope that's kept in.
---
Yes... my god yes.  I've always played alliance, but I made a Horde alt account for the soul purpose of little people slaying.
---
His dad **AND** uncle are Blizzard
---
Except nobody at that level will have a gold by then to pay you.....
---
Well when it was released you couldn't just get all the flight paths for free.  So if you made a new tauren the best way to org was to take the zepp and then get the flight route when you were there.  It was for new characters.
---
I'm 99% sure there's a breadcrumb quest
---
Nordrassil Radio!
---
tape storage is still around!
---
1h and change by salad bakers on lightbringer is the record. with everyone geared to the teeth on naxx gear. most builds will get rekt on naxx for awhile, 100%.
---
Winterspring Frostsaber grind.  The mount looks great, and if they don't change their mind about the unarmored mounts, that mount will be the only unarmored 100% tiger.
---
It was more like 750 USD and mine came with a phone plan I needed anyway, I wouldn’t buy it outright.
---
$200 a year for a really good phone, that is aesthetically pleasing and still works after 4 years. It synced up with the iPad i got from my last year in school.
---
Shit on it all you want but Android phones in 2015 especially the budget ones were hot garbage.
---
I would love 1.13 myself, but to be fair to those against it, you'd need many, many more developers than just Omar and crew. New content would need art assets, story, and about a million other things done.
---
I've tried and every link I can find is either "unavailable" or wants me to download some "MEGA UPLOAD APP" that I refuse to do.
---
Frostsaber is basically the original daily. Netherwing was an improvement if anything.
---
When a quest takes awhile via low drop rates I’m usually happy because I know I’m getting a bunch of extra xp without traveling place to places.
---
I just used the zep from grom gol to UC on a private server a few days ago. I dont remember ever using that one in vanilla. There are no words to describe my disappointment when a loading screen appeared.
---
You can't always escape in vanilla. 
---
You don't have cloak.
---
probably legit price, everyone knows that blizzard wont do many beta invites anymore, and if you're not on the F&amp;F list there is a really low chance that you'll get in, and some people do have alot of money
---
Depends how popular classic is. You can't judge the success of a game that hasn't been release by hype alone.
---
Developing a game that has to backwards engineer its old code would be hard to "build" upon and require lots of resources/investment.
---
Imitating old code that has proven to work is simpler.
---
I also just want TBC, in my eyes it was superior with its content and balance.
---
Auto fly camp t? That's not on the flight path. It's just tb-xr-org
---
This is a perfect example of why Classic makes Azeroth great again.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
If they want dx12 they are gonna build it into legion client. I dont see any logical reason to switch to live (bfa) client. Because its so much work and what about dx13, dx14 or next expansion?, are they gonna built classic again again and again for every expansion or new client? Ofc not!
---
Congrats on your new item, friend.
---
correct. it is walled off and while you can cleverly jump over the wall, the only way to get to northern barrens from there would be to run along the lava chasm, go to the human keep, go up the hill and into the horde encampment, follow the road until you come out outside of ratchet... and then go to the durotar-nbarrens bridge bc that's where you start questing now.
---
I AM AUCTIONING MY ACCOUNT, PLEASE SEND BIDS IN PMS
---
IVE JUST HAD ONE FOR 1K
---
NOW 1.5K
---
HONEST
---
No chance lol
---
So long as we never get wrath I'm Gucci whatever they do. Wrath is what started wow down the dark path
---
And more importantly to the low level people it's indented for you don't have to cross the barrans to unlock the FP
---
Lets be honest. We all would like to be in the beta, most of us would use it just to play the damn game. Big respect for people who actually use betas to test and report bugs tho.
---
I really hope when they go live there aren't higher drop rates. It'll be too much like the retail slot machine they have now.
---
Played on EU-Frostwhisper which was famous for the WPvP guild &lt;Zylos Hand&gt; and the guild leader Zylopfa
---
But you do have sprint, vanish, blind, prep (if specced), etc. you do have a plethora of abilities to use to get away - sure, it’s not a guarantee, but it never was even with cloak, it’s just stuff that increases your chances of getting away
---
- mobs drop non colored items that actually help and matter
---
- gaining exp is fun because leveling is fun
---
- mobs can drop colored items which are actually useful
---
killing mobs matters and is rewarding!
---
Anyone who has beta access, if you allow outdated addons the retail branch should at least partially work and I would appreciate if you coud report any bugs you encounter here or on github and I will try to fix them asap. Currently I do have the beta client but no beta access and I'm using arctium to emulate a server but it's quite limited and the auction interface doesn't work properly.
---
If bidding isn't public he can say he received whatever bid he wants, thus pumping the price even higher. I doubt he'll sell shit
---
early on i would use the herbs to level your own alchemy, people might buy the potions at least.
---
Yes indeed we've known this for almost two months, whats the point of this post?
---
Some people yes, other's no. Back then people were much more lenient with what spec you brought to raid... alot in part because people didn't really know how the game worked and people didn't know what optimal play even was especially for other classes.
---
If you don't know how rogues work how the hell are you going to tell them what to spec for raids? Ofc in the better guilds that were pushing the harder content your spec mattered more and people would call you out if you came to raid as Arms spec, but in most guilds it wasn't called out.
---
Today people know what is optimal and the at least the in the private server meta you are mostly expected to come to raid with a pve raid spec.
---
Weather or not you wana respec between raids is up to you, it depends on how well you can make your PvE spec work with what you are doing outside the raid and depends on how much farming you are willing to do for the sake of optimal play when you aren't raiding, but I can tell you if you are planning on playing in a progression guild you will be expected to show up to raid with a proper spec.
---
Agreed. Could just be all in my head but it does feel a bit too high.
---
&gt; It's a fair criticism
---
No, it's not.  
---
The only thing you should criticize, is your own fantasy, somehow telling you _"an invite is not guaranteed"_ means _"there is a pretty good chance I will get an invite"_.
---
&gt; they have an obligation to mention that
---
Do they now? According to what law exactly?
---
&gt; We now know that being a streamer or on a streamer's F&amp;F list is how most people got in.
---
Sunshine, if they decide that they want to get in people good for marketing, they can do that. The invites to streamers were not regular beta invites, they were done specifically, on purpose, and have NOTHINg to do with your chances of getting one.
---
&gt;It's hilarious to me the mental gymnastics that people employ to rationalize why it's fine to require subbing for a chance to get into the beta and then almost nobody gets in.
---
Even more hilarious are the mental gymnastics of people who think they are somehow entitled t participate in, or get a chance at participating in, a closed beta test.
---
**No, you are not entitled. Get that into your head.**
---
tbh i never leveled tailoring. i raided, so i was able to get my gear that way. alchemy is a lot more valuable with raiding since you need to craft high end potions for the most part, at least you did in vanilla. mana pots will always be valuable though
---
lmao
---
Problem with streamer dungeonfarming was that because they got stuck at 30 for a while they had WAY better gear than a fresh lvl30 would have. A bunch of fresh thirties could probably not run SM as smoothly as the streamers did.
---
Same. I don't know if it's a conditioned response, but grinding is extremely relaxing. I've often found myself missing it after I quit wow.
---
Misses information on how to play around main hand swingtimer to actually get use out of your sword spec and HoJ. PM me if you don't know how to do this and need info/explanation.
---
true
---
Aaaaand another guy who thinks that his definition of fun is the correct one.
---
played out meme
---
In pretty much every poll I've seen, pally druid shaman have been the bottom 3.
---
The changes to hybrid classes were probably one of the greatest improvements in TBC.
---
Are they supposed to apologize now for assuming their audience is capable of logical thought?
---
It's a closed beta, on Servers based in the US.
---
Who do you think they invite? People connecting from the other side of the planet, with a ping of 800ms, and a base knowledge of 2000 words of the English language?
---
All that for a little over a bar. That's probably a good third of the dungeon so you get about 4 bars per run. You can only enter 3 dungeons per hour, right? So that's 12 bars per hour (at that level) so on average 2 hours per level, decreasing in speed the higher you get.
---
Torn between Warrior, Mage and Warlock for both PVE and PVP.
---
Warrior: Seems pretty fun, desirable throughout the content as both dps and tanks and I am willing to do both, also capable in pvp with a pockethealer. But the time and gold that needs to be invested in a warrior seems quite daunting?
---
Both mage and warlock seem capable of pve and pvp, farming doesn't seem to be an issue either.  I'd imagine farming soulshards before a raid is not that bad compared to farming gold for the expensive warrior items, repairs and other consumables. Or am I wrong?
---
add a few decimals after that 99 mate
---
As a casual player, I totally disagree with you. I leveled casually as in WotLK as a 13 year old, however I never had enough time to hit level cap. I leveled in Cataclysm all the same, but still never was able to reach level cap before I got bored. I tried to play again during MoP. I eventually got to actually quest in Pandaria itself but got bored and quit again before reaching level cap. 
---
The leveling experience in WoW at the moment is a long, dull and very lonely experience. It truly gets kind of depressing after a while. 
---
Compare that with my recent leveling experience on a vanilla pserver. The world felt alive. Every city, every region, had people running all over the place going about their business. And while leveling was grindy, it didn't typically feel 'dull' and it was never lonely. I really feel like an adventurer slowly making your way through the world that's alive. I don't think you understand how much that enhances the leveling experience.
---
I saw a streamer blacklist someone in his own faction because the poor guy was killing mobs in the same area as him. The streamer tried to steam a mob the other guy was going for and failed. Blacklisted.
---
honestly blizzard are one of the few companies that still use beta tests as beta tests and not PR stunts, blizzards expansion betas and alphas can last over 6 months (not that they always listen to feedback though)
---
Well, everybody have different needs.
---
I payed 200 usd for my phone and have a pre-paid plan that I put like 20usd per year just so my chip isn't innactivated.
---
I don't usually use 3g/4g and don't like taking photos so I really don't mind using an old phone.
---
You're 100% right, the problem is not what people I play with will think of my choice. 
---
I am a competitive person, I won't go and grind 24/7 to race first to 60 or rush through the level but at 60 I want to be somewhat optimal for PVP. So Dwarf/Gnome is the best choice to give a slight edge over someone vs NE. 
---
Anyway I still have plenty of time to decide XD
---
Ok i never played a warlock so this didnt even come to my mind but thinking about that you I agree with you actually.
---
&gt; This was just a really lame way to get people to sub.
---
No, it wasn't.
---
They specifically warned you that this is not a good idea.
---
It's not their fault if peoples stupidity, greed, and sense of entitlement cause them to abandon logic and rational thought.
---
That’s genuinely really embarrassing
---
Do you also go around spewing insults at random strangers in real life or are you only a despicable shitstain on the internet?
---
That’s a really cool idea and would fit classic really well. I’m looking forward to something like that
---
Paldin and shamans are faction specific and lower by nature on undivided polls
---
Mobs behave differently, are little bit faster so not everything from Privates is same.
---
If you have a good friend that you know will be with you from 1-60 then sure, it's great.
---
I wouldn't even attempt to pick up somebody random in a discord or something.
---
during Overwatch closed beta a lot of access accounts went between 300 and 600 $, I’m not surprised someone would pay that much for classic WoW
---
You can add shaman and pally together. They are only available on each faction. Obviously it's dependent if you roll horde or alliance... That puts them literally 2nd in popularity for each side.
---
Blessings of Akatosh upon you then :D
---
My guild did tanked Crone with four people
---
Did you just walk all the way to UC from grom gol for the first time at level 30 or something?
---
- people generally want fast paced games (see why FF has been using real time combat systems instead of ATB)
---
- it may sound less daunting but it's not. you can get to 120 anywhere from 2 to 6 days /played time. most people's first 60 in vanilla was around 12 days /played
---
- can't argue with this point
---
- i don't think this is a major factor into why someone would play classic over live
---
- classic is absolutely not more player friendly. classic is slow, requires a brain to play, and has overall harder content. retail is incredibly approachable as you can log in for an hour or two a day and get everything done that you need to in a given week. i'm not sure if you're remembering vanilla wow correctly or if you played it back in 2004-2006
---
One thing I have learned about Vanilla/Classic is that people figure out pretty early whether they want to be playing or not, and the ones who decide to stay are usually willing to adjust and learn as needed in order to further progress their character.
---
In real vanilla it was an addon called KoS ( kill on sight ) it was designed for people you wanted to add in a “black list” for ganking etc maybe they make it for classic
---
And if something drops it might be an upgrade or sell for a lot on the AH. I once grinded 31-48 on my Hunter with only a very few quests in between. I Just watched a podcast in the background and vendored when I had to. :D
---
I was writing a humorous comment. How mature of you to attack people on the internet for that.
---
But there is a bright side to your comment: I can now improve the quality of my inbox feed with one simple click on Block.
---
So who got the staff or what is the going rate?
---
But both subs and tokens are more than 7.99
---
They aren't rushing to 40. They're playing the game the only way they are capable. When you unleash your entire beta playerbase upon level 30 zones, every mob is contested. Now add on top of that the attention seeking children who watch the big streamers. Both of their faction and opposing. They'll likely take 8 hours to level once and provide a shit viewing experience for their viewers.
---
This isn't the most efficient way to level at all. It's just the most practical for big streamers.
---
Gotta go with the horde my man.
---
yes, someone has to beat it first, and can then set up the rope
---
This meme his never failed to make me laugh!
---
The problem is that they don't test, I had no problem with streamers getting beta keys, because they can show the game to a bigger audience. They always talk about how fun vanilla questing was and the community, but in the end they only care about rushing to the max level and getting world firsts...
---
Lol no. Seems like you think that my desire for having less than optimal specs, viable = i want retail.
---
Obtain Rhok'delar and faceplant a lot of people in pvp until the end of time.
---
Considering those "fuckers" will, at that point, own a sum total of 5-10 silver (if that much), that doesn't sound like much of a business plan to me :P
---
&gt;Some people would rather see the integrity of Classic completely preserved and not even chance having that fucked up
---
People are vastly overestimating the chance of classic being "fucked up," though. That's the point.
---
&gt;TBC is pretty much guaranteed to be good.
---
And many of us see TBC as a guarantee of Classic being "fucked up." TBC started the downward spiral towards BFA with daily quests, flying counts, obsoleted oldworld content, boring dungeon design, and an overall "casualification" of the game. So if the option is between that, and new content that will only expand upon vanilla WoW without any of that crap that we don't want, the better choice is obvious.
---
&gt;You are making a bad faith argument and projecting it on people
---
Are you going to explain what that bad faith argument is and how I'm projecting or did you think it'd just sound smart if you used these words?
---
&gt;I think most of us would be happy with either TBC or 1.13 whichever they chose, TBC is just the surefire way to success
---
TBC was terrible for the reasons I listed above. I'd rather reroll on a fresh vanilla server, or play a new game.
---
Losing 50# before the launch of Classic IRL, combining WoW with fitness.
---
Losing weight is about as far away from the meta as you can get.
---
They dont necessarily have to be lvl 60 content?
---
as long as its ONLY the Classic team that  handles it
---
I'd argue it's because Classic is structured in such a way where they already have what's needed in order to fulfill those goals. They're just applying it to a newer version of the engine and then dialing it back to form Classic.
---
New content requires new, well, everything and comparing how much of an amazing job they're doing with Classic is apples to oranges. I can do a great job if I trace an image but tell me to free hand draw something and the quality could be awful or it could be great depending on the complexity and that's why some are hesitant especially if they don't take an OSRS approach which heavily involves the community.
---
Personally I think it would be a great idea since there's a lot left on the table but I also don't want Classic to be the reason Classic sucks in case they draw outside the lines which ruins the experience.
---
I'm still sad what happened to Blanchy. We took [Old Blanchy's Feed Pouch](http://classicdb.ch/?item=1537) and 6 years later the poor horse is dead. They told us some lies about the Defias* but we all know that it starved to death because a ~~hero~~ adventurer took its feed pouch...
---
*) Defias are WoW's version of the Russian hackers.
---
Well, someone cannot deal with facts.
---
We will not be hearing from you again.
---
It may just be to account for fewer people being on beta?
---
I played on Dalaran. I dont remember much except an awesome horde rogue named Xerxes.
---
When 2x2=4 you dont need say its not 5 its not 6 or its not 7 if no one asking.
---
Why they randomly say we are not using bfa client after they say we are gonna hard code it to the legion client. Why even they say “legion” in the first place. They are not copying legion addons folder to the bfa addons folder. Its not that easy. They are working exclusively (hard coded) on legion client over a year and still have so many bugs (no water dm and many visual bugs, flying gather nodes etc) which they are client based not database. 
---
If they want dx12 (why? For 2006 graphics?) they are gonna build it into legion client. I dont see any logical reason to switch to live (bfa) client. Because its so much work and what about dx13, dx14 or next expansion?, are they gonna built classic again again and again for every expansion or new client? Ofc not.
---
I remember KoS, and was hoping there was something similar made that I can also add positive experiences to (instead of just adding them to Friends and hoping I remember who they were later, which has it's purpose as well.)
---
EU Frostwhisper too! Alliance side here (albeit from the start of TBC when I started playing)

So a quest that wasnt limited to once a day was the original daily even though the name daily comes from the fact of it being only doable once a day. Okay. Im not saying that one or the other is more enjoyable but they arent comparable. Never in my life during vanilla i was forced to do something, sure i had plenty to do but i could do whatever the fuck i wanted whenever the fuck i wanted. One day i could ignore doing X to do Y and then the next day do more of X. While later you always log in to do X every single day for a while. Yes yes i know im not 'forced' to do it either, but thats just like im not 'forced' to do lfr/d. I'm not forced sure but you'd be stupid of you don't.

Retail WoW is going to be a smartphone game in 2 years.

He probably went Org to UC and Org to Grom gol
---
Of course, there needs to be a balance that is struck.
---
Frankly I wonder if you've ever worked in a large company.
---
The amount is laughably small and will be paid every single time. What would actually be moronic is spending hours researching alternatives while still facing the risks of compatibility issues and poor overall quality.
---
In addition, as a buyer, no one will even look at a $200 purchase for a workstation that will last at least 5 years. If an inferior product causes issues because you wanted to save a hundred bucks on a $15k setup though...
---
Is anyone else kind of wary of the types of addons being added? I know blizz has said that LFR-esque addons will be deleted but even stuff like questhelped or DBM kind of ruin the spirit of classic for me. And before anyone says "just dont use it", not using them puts you behind everyone else who is using it.
---
No, i took the zep from OG like everybody else?
---
I ask because you can clearly write and formulate yourself well enough that what you say can't be excused as mere stupidity, so instead you seem like a legitimately terrible, condescending and hateful person. I hope you don't go through life speaking like that to everyone whose opinion differs from yours.

There was a massive gold duping scheme on my server.  Our GM was mailed 50,000 gold, others I know had the same or more mailed to them.  We all figured that they would revert the gold but not take away what was bought, so everyone in the guild bought epic mounts.  And, sure enough, the gold was taken away but the mounts stayed.  
---
One time we were doing a Friday night MC PUG and the last ten members couldn't make it to the zone because this Horde guild notorious for camping people, especially this hunter in that group, camped the entrance that entire night.  We all came back from AFK, while waiting for the raid to form, said "fuck this shit", stormed out 30 strong and wiped the floor with Horde scum, then went about MC and had a binding drop.  Fun night.
---
This poll needs more votes. I doubt there will be so few rogues.
---
Just torrent it, I downloaded it last week and never had any of the issues you're describing.
---
I have to say I agree to that statement. TBC did really bring up the Hybrids in a good way. I'm sorry fella :((
---
Considering for USA, servers go live on Monday,  Tournament expected on Sunday, 
---
There are some spots that the old level 10-19 twinks would use to fish,  No Idea on how layering affects the tourney, so we could be looking a server with several layers of people competing against one quest turn in, or each layer could have their own.
---
so in theory, even the first tourney could have quite a few people more people than you would think.
---
is that the Hulk????
---
His comment is much less insulting than yours.
---
Also, he's right.
---
What's the point of having a warlock in your group anyways?
---
You earn LESS experience from grinding dungeons then doing quests
---
Leaving the knowledge of what performs well aside:
---
Lord of the rings is now *years* behind us. And the movies played at least some role IMO. The amound of NE hunters named "lëgõlâsxx" was only - if at all - surpassed by the undead rogues named ""Šhådōwkîllèr".
---
They may have upped it for hype or to test things with gear, or test drop rates.
---
I personally think it would be fine if it cost some absurd amount of gold. Something high enough that only the people who spend 100 gold a week on respecs would find tempting. It would be a great long term goal for the people who already have their epic mount.
---
You deserve every single $ you sunk into that.
---
&gt;While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test **it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test.**
---
How much more obvious does a warning have to be?
---
I can't imagine a sane setup that would make this require a lot of work
---
Can you not set a note for each person on your friends list?
---
There might be somewhere.
---
That is some vintage YT right there. 👌
---
Also you can jump off mid ride if your destination is somewhere in between! Just don't forget your noggenfoggers...

You just be fun at parties
---
Crone?
---
Your feeling is correct, true classic experience
---
Really, I played a lock and rerolled when the first blue reward from a quest chain replaced my t2.5 chest piece.
---
TBC and wrath were the most played eras of the game.
---
TBC had arenas, which i loved. world pvp still happened a lot. can't mount while in combat. and most wpvp encounters occurs when ppl are question in the same zone. can't fly before Outland too. flying impact on pvp is massively overrated. wPvP is vastly overrated because of some cool clips that happened once every year or whatever. most people were sitting beside the Battlemaster queuing for bgs, farming consumes, raid logging or levelling a alt. TBC doesn't make that any different.
---
TBC also had a mount/rep/attunement grind even worse than classic. but had better raids, better dungeons, more "viable" and "well defined" classes. LFG weren't even a thing. and LFG itself isn't even bad, is just the teleport thing that is.
---
25 man raids also opens up the content fore more guilds, which is not a bad thing. 40 is just too much, a lot can go wrong IRL for 5 ppl that ends up fucking 35 ppl which is pretty annoying and makes a lot guilds disbanding. and pls don't come up with the elitist "it's not for everyone!!!! if you can't make it then you don't deserve it!!!!". 25 is more than enough.
---
That's not correct. People are earning 5000+ exp in 10 minutes, while also not having to travel around between quests, deal with PvP or struggle to tag mobs.
---
I think the easiest way to duo level is just being in a guild and asking the people leveling in your area, or just inviting people that are doing the same quest as you then striking up a conversation and sticking together for a few more of them. If you’re planning to sup level with someone you don’t live with, it will most likely be a pain in the ass.
---
actually it is already better if your goal is quick runs or making gold
---
The oz fight in Kara
---
Dude what are you saying? Live wow has been completely bastardized to cater to low skill gamers.  It's why raid difficulties exist, it's why dungeon difficulties exist, it's why queueing for raiding and dungeons exist, it's why piss easy content like world quests and warfronts in bfa are stupid rewarding for how hard they are, and most Importantly, it's why the world itself is no longer dangerous.  I can't believe anyone thinks the game has been changed too much for hardcore players, the exact opposite is true.
---
How many of these threads are we going to see popping up I wonder?
---
**No, dungeongrinding is NOT an efficient way to level.**
---
Except if you somehow have groups consisting entirely of people who were stuck at some arbitrary levelcap for the last 200h played, and maxed out the shit of their toons.
---
Which won't be the case in live.
---
as in people who doesn't have the beta can watch streams and still look for bugs through their perspective.
---
Wrath
---
I main a warlock in Vanilla and this is one of the best ways to get a tank for a dungeon.  Just whisper every warrior in the level range "Lf tank for &lt;instance&gt; once you join we will run there and can summon you.  You can keep doing what you're doing until we get there."  A major reason to not do an instance like Mara is that it can take an extremely long time to get to.  If a group is offering a summon and the other isn't it makes a huge difference in your time efficiency.
---
At least there was a pretty view whilst you were running around. :)
---
Is not a joke to find the zeppelin, they were not jocking but the zeppelin still there.

You absolutely cannot unless you're an orc or troll. Pretty sure every race starts with their faction's Capitol fp

&gt;How about graphics
---
How about using google, going to the officla home page, or watching the official video about classic?
---
Follow your dreams my friend , fly free, show them what arcane power is for!
---
I'm baffled by how some people treat money. 1500$ to play a beta account for 12 weeks before the game releases anyway?
---
That's basically paying 18$ a day to play a beta.
---
celebrity culture is toxic
---
Naxx isn't anywhere close to "high level mythics" nowdays. The Dungeon part is completely ignored. 
---
And then you went straight to rambling about prestige Gatekeeping. That nobody was talking or complaining about, what the hell. Are you allright?
---
They should pay Mark Kern to join them as an external advisor honestly. He stands behind the true values of vanilla
---
Look up Clan Battlehammer from Emerald Dream server.  They are an all dwarven guild that routinely does amazing rp events.
---
True. Personal opinion, I don’t think LFR/LFG should leave the option to kick anyone.
---
Yes but they're also all wearing BiS level 30 gear. In reality, you're going to still be rocking level 15 gear when you're 30 on the live game. Real players wont be near as efficient.
---
I don't think you can on WoW Classic, but I'm not a lucky Beta Tester. Also, having a subtle marker show up on their nameplate would be cool so I can recognize them in the world.
---
hardware bans only go by NIC and HDD, easily replaced for cheap or free.
---
What are they working on nearly 2 years? (Annoucement was 3 nov 2017)
---
I'm surprised there are so many Warlocks tbh.
---
Why do people keep posting this, and no reference as to why anyone would think otherwise?
---
It's all about the journey! People often complain about grinding mobs in vanilla but as you said, is one of the great things about this beautiful game. Grinding mobs is a great awesome videogame experience. I hate grinding in BFA tho, classic good.
---
&gt;I was wondering if there was an addon that let me easily add people to a list and I can put a note next to them so that I can remember my experience with them. 
---
Yes, this addon exists.
---
It was first released in 1983, and has been a part of Windows ever since 1985.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad
---
Yeah but the instances aren't nearly the same and the travel time is negligible in comparison.  M+ is a competitive environment and some people take it very seriously.  They will leave if they feel like you're wasting their time.  If it's just a mythic (M0), finding a person to replace them is extremely easy or you can just finish with just 4 people if that person wasn't the tank or the healer.
---
I like that solution. Can that be the solution to every problem?
---
Me too! I finally found my old cd and cd key lol
---
In cataclysm was the biggest change for this.  Because dungeon finder didnt just get you a group, it also ported you to that dungeon. Out of convenience, a PvPer as myself, would do nothing but dungeons to grind for exp and gear, and once I reach the highest level cap for a bg (they changed from 10-19 to 10-14 and 15-19), I would do nothing but pvp completely destroying everyone in it. Then when i reach the next bracket, i will do dungeons for 2-3 levels until i get all my gear and repeat the process all the way to 85. 
---
I hated questing.
---
classic is running off whatever retail has  
---
when we get 9.0, classic will be updated to 9.0
---
j c € f ™
---
I think the dungeon runs were expected in this case when the goal is only 10 levels and everyone started at 30.
---
layering will ruin it
---
I really want to get an undead mount on my troll priest. STV Fishing Contest is also another goal.
---
Benediction too, but that is meta i guess
---
Well, then I'll have to stick to AoE lvling in duneons with a bunch of mages I guess
---
But who knows, maybe they'll layer the hell out of the game and it will be viable in the open world after all
---
Well, the Night Elves before becoming druidic were arcane masters. The High Elves that taught the Humans were the same generation that escaped Kalimdor after Azshara was beaten.
---
I'm triggered by the damage meter and mini map not aligning properly.
---
One time I found Freezing Band and Stockade Pauldrons inside like 20 minutes and it took me like an hour to really believe it wasn't some kind of bug that would get rolled back.
---
I prefer to grind while leveling and mainly quest when it's practical and not too far out of the way of my favorite grind spots.
---
I just like having money I guess.
---
it's a vesa adapter, I doubt apple's will last for much longer than anyone else's.
---
gtfo with your bullshit
---
I kind of want them to finish a bunch of stuff that was clearly meant to be in the leveling experience.
---
Finish the class quests (Druid quests just stop after travel form) give out the other tier one epic class weapon quests aside from priest and hunter ect...
---
the animations being gone, literally! they never fixed that
---
I can tell the exact difference between the two. Layering isn't wanted or needed. This is supposed to be a classic server.
---
Vanilla *changed the face of MMOs and is the biggest selling game of all time.* Why do they need to change it to what *they* think we want?
---
What we want is already there. Blizzard has shown, with literally every decision they've made for the last 3 years, that they are out of touch with the player's wants.
---
 Their entire game philosophy is "We're right, you're wrong. Why do you think *you* know what you want? Sit down and shut the fuck up."
---
Look! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd-yRVtNBuI&amp;t=28m16s
---
"We know this isn't what you want. We know this isn't what the game was. We know this is in no way in the spirit of re-releasing a classic server. But fuck you, we're doing it anyway."
---
Layering is just sharding. People will be disappearing from your gameworld during normal gameplay. *That is not Vanilla.*
---
BfA and Legion and WoD have convenienced the game to death and now they're doing it to Classic and people are not only bending over for it, they're *praising* them for it.
---
I'm tired of playing a lobby game where you queue to have a brief flurry of activity with strangers and no community, that's why WoW is dying. That's why everyone has quit BfA and people are so hyped for Classic.
---
The only good bug, is a dead bug!
---
Yes, but if it is seemingly perceived as the "right way" by the players then it is still bad game design. Of course you can always just throw the "you just don't get it!" bullshit around, but that doesn't change anything.
---
Nah I have it bound right there to 0.
---
Congratulations, not just the entire beta population will see you backpedal, but the entire bloodthirsty HoW dIdInOtGeTiNiWaSrAnK14iNnAxXgEaR people too.
---
...and there are people who drop $100,000 on a single night out, nothing new, just people using the resources they have for personal happiness.
---
I mean... as a retail player... no. Play something else. I've been filling a lot of my time with Pillars of Eternity and Divinity Original Sin while i'm waiting, and with new Fire Emblem coming before classic i'll have plenty to do.
---
Why? Its pretty dumb for us for sure but if i had 10 million dollars on my bak account and wanted to play the beta then why would i care. It would be as impactful to ne as something like 2$ is right now. Im sure the person knows that its a lot of money for an account, it might still be virtually no money at all for him. Now if the guy who spent that money isnt actually rich and he just bif all his savings thats another story.
---
But they're still opting for the most convenient option for themselves, so surely it still lines up with the theme behind my post?
---
This guy knows well.
---
Yeah this is what I'm thinking, some light commentary and no giant picture covering the screen every time a donation is made.
---
Used to love Let's Plays in the background back in the day but most Twitch streams are a little too loud and obnoxious now for my taste.
---
im sure wand shooting gives you a global so you can not shoot between casts. This fact and Top10 Dps as BM hunter in naxx i call total bullshit post. Sorry mate, but what you wrote sounds like a fairytale
---
The main reason you see so many people power level through dungeons, is because they did many quests as lvl 30 for the higher level quest rewards. So they simple don't have quests for their level anymore.
---
Also it's a big difference between forming groups yourself from people of your server than it is getting matched by randoms. If you're a ninja in these groups it will spread even faster because just on message is enough and several people will know that you are a ninja.
---
People will always cap as fast as possible in the todays age, classic overall is not nostalgia. The exploration of Azeroth is! If you played wow for several years you will know all the areas and have a general idea of the story and what happens in there. That was not the case 2004.
---
In addition to all that SM is a big exception because it covers a wide range of levels. If you would grind dungeons from 1-60 you would have to do a lot of traveling and it would not be that easy. Now everybody is lvl 30 and looking for a group for SM. In classic nobody will start heading to the entrance without having a full group of people.
---
Hand of Justice gives you extra attacks. There's also one of the darkmoon faire trinkets that are pretty good on ferals.
---
&gt;I’m just the programmer
---
A programmer who's never heard of git merge, apparently
---
Shift, CTRL and ALT all follow the same pattern as the bottom bar. The extra Right action bar has keys of its own.
---
Nope, nope, nope
---
One of the main things I'm looking forward to is having a single version of dungeons and raids
---
it's not the same at all. you have to find a group by speaking to other players, travel to the dungeon, and even though you're chain running the dungeon, you're doing it with people you know instead of random people every time. how is that an heirloom like experience? even in wotlk my guild chain ran dungeons because there was too much competition outside the world as far as getting quest objectives, and we wanted to hit max lvl fast enough to raid. this isn't bad for the game. people thought LFD was convenient at first but then realized the consequences of LFD was one of the major downfalls to what made WoW special. Blizzard even said it was a mistake to use LFD but they can't take it away now that people are used to it.

I think the main problems would be the incentives/gear/rewards. How would you want loot to work?
---
Supp room was rather easy for us, I don't remember many, if any dying there. But we had some really awesome rogues and great healers. Chromy gave us our next fit in BWL. Everyone was trying to read off the debuffs mid fight over vent and figure out wtf what was going on. So much panic!
---
Retail wow is so easy.  Just read all your skills before you go into an instance.  I would asked you if you were a bot before I kicked you though.  And if you honestly said you were trying I would try to help you, but I like helping people.  I understand if people just want to move on because you can reque and get into a new instance really fast anyways it's not really hurting you.
---
I say either hold out waiting or play in a private server. I tried going back to BFA this weekend, after quiting in January. I did 5 2v2 matches and waiting for my m+10 group to fill for 30 minutes before logging off and having absolutely no desire to log back in again.
---
you are an idiot  
---

Maybe when dx11 outdated. Also you are stuck with 2006 graphics or maybe cataclysm (grass etc). Why you even need dx12 for that btw?

Very similar to what I use on all characters. Furthermore - interrupts are always E, gap closers are always Q, etc. etc. Very easy to remember, would recommend.

---
You still cared during green jesus and panda days?
---
You didn't need 10 real tanks there. If I remember correctly one needed to be tanked, one kited, one had random aggro and ... I forgot the last one.
---
That can't be right. If you have a dedicated group for farming instances it has to be way faster. Running the same instances over and over ensures the best gear while fast clears give tons of xp.
---
If you're finding a new group every time then it's slower for sure but a single group with good players just cleaving their way through dungeons has to be the fastest.
---
Would be nice :) 
---
Just might happen if they open a ton of layers for the first couple of days!
---
That would be seriously amazing
---
female nightelf healing cast animation looks absolute trash though
---
onyl reason you see streamers farm 5mans is that they are 5people geared to the teeth destorying the place  
---
after release, during leveling, noone will run those dungeons more than once, just for the quests
---
But I haven't got to that part of the course on brilliant.org yet.
---
Dynamic respawning doesn't solve anything, if anything it breaks immersion just as much as sharding.
---
Layering is the best option :)
---
Oh shit you weren't kidding
---
Yeah.... with insane gear, beta is very artificial in that way
---
&gt; The main reason you see so many people power level through dungeons, is because they did many quests as lvl 30 for the higher level quest rewards. So they simple don't have quests for their level anymore.
---
Most of the streamers i've seen didn't really have any quests ready to complete. They just started to run the Dungeons as soon as it became evident that questing wasn't as viable, because they got ganked a bunch in STV or spent ages walking around looking for mobs that they couldn't find.
---
Some people would respec for a long weekend of pvp, if you were raiding high end content you didn’t really have to, I pvp’d on my lock in my raiding SM/ruin spec and simply one shot people off their mount: succubus seduce, curse of elements, trinkets and soul fire always did the trick :D our MT was a mean FC with 12k+ HP buffed for midnight  after raid pvp sessions, just simply unkillable
---
I think that there will be. Blizzard will have been gauging the interest in Classic during the Beta, and the level of hype indicates that they will be able to support RP-PvP. The fact that they haven't released server names/numbers is confirmation itself that nothing is yet set in stone.
---
#MIX TAPES ARE COMING BACK, BAYBEE
---
I'm doing my part
---
Then go worry.
---
It's not my problem if you ruin your own day :D
---
No because on live servers that technique would not work
---
It is supossed to last only a couple of week so, fingers crossed
---
You’re just wrong dude. In vanilla, most priests were human and 2nd place was night elf. My raiding guild had one dwarf priest and it was someone’s alt. 
---
Dwarves are going to be people who feel like being a dwarf and not many else. 
---
If your guild can’t succeed because they only have 1 or 2 dwarves, they probably don’t deserve to be considered hardcore anyway.
---
The issue with that is you’d be screwing over a lot of DPS classes just to bring a warlock in a 5 man group, simply because they can get everyone to the instance. In larger groups this wouldn’t be an issue. Summoning stones basically give your group a warlock even if you don’t have one. 
---
I don’t feel too strongly either way though. Imbalance was one of the good things about vanilla imo.
---
When were the summoning stones (that actually summon) introduced anyway? End of vanilla or during TBC? Can’t recall

not true actually. the reference 1.12 client's assets had to be adjusted to fit the 8.x client. if blizzard makes a change to the way art assets interact with 9.0+ versions, it could break classic wow when that client is updated. classic client will forever be 8.x

It's made by the same people who designed the display itself without having to resort to reverse engineering, probably in expensive alloys and good manufacturing because Apple has a brand image to protect contrary to chinese vendors on AliExpress.

It's not revolutionary or super special by any means but it's sure to get to job done for a one-time payment that is irrelevant to large companies.

I'm not surprised to read you are as well-mannered as knowledgeable on design and management.

Yeah maybe I just get too caught up in min maxing, the tailoring robe is best in slot until tier 2 I think. It sounds much more fun to go alchemy though so I think I will do that :)

&gt;That can't be right
---
According to people who have worked this out for 14 years, and know a lot more about the game than you ever will, yes it is right.

But hey, if you wanna slowlevel, and drag down some other guys along with you, no skin off my back =) Just don't complain when I'm running UBRS preraid farms, and you are still dreaming of doing Sunken Temple one day :-)

Yes but in this case, pick can only be used as a verb in the context of plants. You don’t “pick” a vein, you mine it

I play a Tank Warrior since Vanilla all through the expansions.  I wanted to keep playing Warrior but part of me wants to pick an underdog.
---
Maybe I'll just become my servers Prot Paladin and do nothing but 5-10 man's and make a name for myself.

I’d like to sell it, not sure how much it’ll actually go for though since people are focused on going for their mounts.
---
With rogue at 9% I have many doubts
---
I haven't had Mountain Dew in about 25 years. I might buy it though just as a collector thing.
---
&gt;we wanted to hit max lvl fast enough to raid.
---
Heirlooms increase experience gained by upwards of 50% and make the leveling process easier and faster. As you said, you ran dungeons because it was faster. That is why I referred to it as an heirloom-like experience.
---
It’s possible. There’s a few wonky things I’ve found so far that could just be possible tuning errors.
---
If non pserver people will ever hear about Wmane they will shake their head for one week straight. They got no clue how willing people are to get fucked over just to get what they want.
---
Warlocks were underrated in Vanilla but it seems people caught onto their power and potential now.
---
He's never been to one. The false sense of friendship displayed by participating members of said party is reason why a lot of us don't like parties.
---
I’d figure if they did it intentionally they would say something. But anything is possible
---
* I would want the items to be completely new, not higher item level versions of the normal dungeon. 
---
* There shouldn't be a lot of them.
---
* They should be close to BRD items in terms of power, and for classes that don't have any slot options in that tier.  
---
Just a first thought.

Mob grinding is not particularly exciting, but it is steady, which is more than can be said for quests having you run around all the time.

I'm torn between playing an Undead or Orc rogue, mainly for PVP. I feel like the Orc racials are a bit stronger, but Undead look so cool as rogues.

---
Why not just not layer? Oh right Blizzard needs to cut costs

Not likely they will mess with those assets

and they need to patch up all the new exploits, cheats and battlenet features that come in the upcoming years, so doubtful it will stay at 8

My original realm was Thrall Horde. Ascent was a guild known for world first ragnaros kill and I believe the first aq opening? Not sure... they moved servers and renamed to “The Gong Show” because of the gates of AQ. Besides that, there was an infamous player named Racerx, a 60 warrior who was known for being obnoxious, trolling and ninja’ing loot. You would see people fighting with him everyday in trade chat. 
---
I’m sure this happened on other servers but I remember lord kazzak or something attacking undercity for days, killing everyone who entered or left the ruins, but once most players went to sleep one night Ascent got all their players to kite him away and kill him so he didn’t fully heal off us  noobs.
---
That doesn't matter. They're taking the path of least resistance, opting for convenience over gameplay. They want the fastest leveling experience possible, to the point that they are ignoring 10 level's worth of questing in favour of running the same 2 dungeons over and over and over for an entire day.

Isn't this pretty much what everyone does?
---
Was in a Noodle-Shop in Japan once, they had exactly 3 items on their menu.
---
I went there 9 times in 2 weeks, because it was so delicious :D
---
Not sure if its quicker especially in the later levels. But it you would be making bank doing that. No need to worry about level 40 mount or even 60 mount if all you do is dungeons. You should have plenty of gold from vendors alone.
---
I'll take the mana potion since I can just heal myself.
---
BE *Laughs in mana steal*
---
I get what you're saying. Yes people will always look for the most optimal way to do things. That doesn't make it the *right* way to do things though, and it doesn't mean that Blizzard should have encouraged it by making it an "official" way to play the game. It was also extremely efficient to get a large group of people to follow you around and kill things you tagged quickly. Again, that doesn't mean that Blizzard would be *right* if they added some sort of NPC mob that followed you and killed things for you.
---
The big question is: Do the streamers look like they're having fun grinding dungeons like they are? Maybe for the first hour or two, but after that they all get the same glassy eyed look on their face. It's not a *fun* way to play the game, and the *fun* way is the route that Blizzard should have endorsed.
---
nobody needs the same pieces of gear in ilvl10 ilvl50 ilvl300 +-20lottery ilvl, that is part of the reason why retail turned so shit
---
&gt;lolol I used to play with a guy who donated for BiS gear + Shadowmourne...what is that like $1500?
---
How do you mark targets with icons?
---
The average Joe will not stream his classic leveling and people will not go out in STV with their only goal being killing Mr. Joe for 5 seconds of twitch fame. 
---
Also streaming dungeons is much more enjoyable as content than questing and walking from A to B. Not everything is black and white.
---
Arthas - Eastern PVP - videos and great faction balance 
---
Pat, Maydie, World of Roguecraft, Ioneye, Hulksmash, Rovell’s, roaming PVP nights, Aurora, Ret, TG, Sold Out, Hidden
---
Yes but it's only possible because they have Max gear, it would be super slow normally. You can't really compare that to real servers
---
I recall summoning people to Deadmines on my first character. I remember BC came out when I was leveling in Wetlands. So it was definitely in the pre-patch, if not before.

Hello, only classes i dont want to play are Druid and Hunter.  Since there will be lot of rogues/warriors on Aliance side, im looking for class strong against them. I have spot in hardcore PvE guild where we already have lot of warriors/rogues so thats also not an option loot-wise. I will level in group, so party utility is more usefull than solo leveling capability. I tried warlock and shaman on pserver, but im not a fan. (Nightfall Enh shaman spot in our raid is already taken) Bonus will be same spec for PvE and PvP, so options are:
---
Undead Frost Mage
---
Undead Shadow Priest
---
Is there something else im missing?
---
&gt; People are vastly overestimating the chance of classic being "fucked up," though. That's the point, and I explained it.
---
This isn't something you can just math out and expect other people to just agree with the objective truth you explained. It's completely subjective and you can explain it all you want, it doesn't mean everyone is going to buy your explanation. The same people who designed Cata  through BFA would be in charge of designing 1.13. It is certainly not a given that this will end well. 
---
TBC is not Classic. You can't fuck up Classic with TBC, it's a different game. What are you even about? Most people disagree with you and see TBC as the superior game even to classic. You are in the minority, which is fine, but stating your argument like you are coming from a place where everyone already agrees with what you are saying is incorrect. You aren't making a new argument that people haven't already thought of, your just stating things people already know and disagree with. The 'better choice' isn't obvious and pretending otherwise isn't going to win anyone over.
---
&gt; Are you going to explain what that bad faith argument is
---
You are making an argument you know is not true. That is what a bad faith argument is.
---
You know people who are advocating for TBC have legitimate concerns about devs designing 1.13. You know they aren't making the concerns up. You are making a bad faith argument and projecting it to them in an attempt to incorrectly invalidate their concerns for the sake of making your argument stronger. It's a sad attempt. Stop it. Either address their concerns head on and quit pretending they aren't real or you will never get anyone on that side to agree with you. 
---
&gt; TBC was terrible for the reasons I listed above.
---
*In your opinion*. You are the minority. Most  people have a very favorable view of TBC and some even view it as the superior game.
---
I see kakapo, I immediately think MARLAAAAAA
---
Not disappointed.
---
An addon would be great because currently I just use Notepad for that kind of thing
---
&gt; honestly i think it should be the community

Tell me, if I asked you to chose between two planes, one designed and built according to rules set forth by popular vote on some online forum, the other one designed and built according to rules set forth by highly trained aeronautic engineers, which one do you want to carry you across the Atlantic ocean?
---
I definitively agree with your sentiment of the ridicolousness on the Beta servers right now, obviously people won't be as geared out their buttocks as they are right now.  
---
But from all accounts I've heard on the subject matter (which - let's keep in mind - could just be people talking out of their anal cavities) it sounded like at least the efficacy of just grinding mobs for XP was rather alright.  
---
Then again, I haven't really looked into it at all or dug into any sorts of numbers pertaining to grinding.
---
Aggro range on Eye of Kilrogg has always been super tiny in vanilla. What's the point of a scouting mechanism if it you can't scout with it?
---
A lot of players didn't respec back in vanilla, but keep in mind that people sucked at making money in game back then.
---
The attitude of players has also shifted quite a bit over the years. Back in 2005 most players were unwilling to spend a large portion of time farming a battery of consumables, but these days that's basically entry level stuff for raiding.
---
It's possible to get away with not being PvE spec if you're a healer, but I think basically any DPS who's not actively ranking will get called out for not being PvE spec immediately. Everybody runs a DPS meter these days and the nature of raiding means you're already under heavy scrutiny from other players.
---
It's like the Deeprun Tram. Great at first level, pretty cool flavor after that. The zeppelin gets a bonus point because it's cool to see it flying around, vs the deeprun tram that is kinda forgotten about.
---
Lol not surprised you are also a white supremacist.
---
Haha you only think that's 180 sweet nectar
---
Well, they will do another public Wave. That is a save bet, sadly F&amp;F is also so low chance to be in. You can have max. 10 people on your F&amp;F and only top 1 is in atm. (Top 3 seems not to be right, since I am Top 2)
---
She gets extra points for signing it 'Maiev'
---
Well, you can wait few days before playing. Yes, yes, I know - most people want to play as soon as possible, but honestly, there are quite a lot that enjoys these initial few days. This is literally the only chance of that experience and it will only be a few days, so I'd say it is fair to just keep it and let people enjoy it - if someone don't they can wait.
---
You might consider the experience yourself. Do some low level duels, try to find creative ways to level up (for example make a group and try to get to higher level mob ahead of the curve and together kill them), some classes might find it fun to try and "snipe" mobs fast (hunters are good at this) and then of course socialize. All the time standing around means fun in chats and is a great time to find some new friends. Maybe you already have a guild, then find some other people from the same guild and get to know them. Or simply enjoy an MMO that looks alive as any MMO *should* be.
---
Mega works fine, it's legit.
---
&gt;so surely it still lines up with the theme behind my post?
---
No, it doesn't.
---
No one on live servers will have full BiS gear at lvl 30. The premise for your conclusion doesn't exist in the live game, therefore your conclusion is False, simple as that.
---
Refreshing this sub every 4 mins and sorting by new.

I'm still mad at this. There was no explanation why the people of Darkshire suddenly decided to join up with the Legion. At least Ladimore remained pure but only after protest on the forums.

Practice your 1-10 route on private servers.

Laughing skull: PALS FOR LIFE and Leeroy Jenkins.

And who suggested that?

Playing league of legends and working out
---
We know where McConnel got beta now
---
I would like to think new players or people who haven't got to keybind watch streamers with all unique UI's and keybinds that often doesn't makes sense for the eye but instead for the muscle memory.  
---
My thought was to show an easy way to setup your abilites and still be able to easily cover all action bars with keybinds.
---
Meh. The points into shadow aside from spirit tap dont really help outside PvP. Honestly, it wouldn’t be bad to get the +15% absorb in Disc either. The priest leveling rotation of MB, Smite, Sw:p and wand doesnt really change, so points in shadow dont make much of a difference.
---
Laughing skull and Leeroy Jenkins

Gap closers on e, cc on q, interrupts on f, oh shit buttons on z x c
---
&gt;Neither of those fix the problem
---
Because there isn't a problem.
---
Can you give a few examples of wonky things?
---
then don't use it. questhelper and dbm were used in retail vanilla
---
I'm just providing numbers. I'm not arguing whether or not he's right.
---
It's likely both clients will share a common base. Retail and beta already install into one WoW base folder. If they want Classic to retain compatiblity with what at given point will be "current server infrastructure" then having both games use the same client components will make it easy. Freezing client version gives more work when backporting fixes and will case with time the same problems 1.12 client has now.
---
They're doing it because they're streamers that have become obsessed with competing in a 30 (now 40) meta that never existed before, getting to that level as fast as possible to they can get 40 BiS. 
---
There will for sure be groups of people in retail that farm dungeons to 60, doesn't mean it's "right" or "wrong", it's just one way of playing. It may be faster but it may also be considerably more dull. Many, many, many people will just want to quest to 60 and enjoy it, and do dungeons randomly for a bit of loot.
---

Just read all the comments below this, shows how much I know 😂 obviously haven’t done a BG in a long while with an alt. My bad
---
&gt;  I dont see any logical reason to switch to live (bfa) client.
---
And you are a programmer ? Dont see logical reason to only update one client over 2 clients when you are using the same databases and server ?
---
They have already plans for doing the first expansions into classic later on. This isnt something thats "ready" at launch.
---
You're looking at the mechanics of it, and saying it won't translate over. I'm not arguing with that at all. Nobody is going to be level 30 BiS on Live.
---
I'm looking at it from a different angle. The fact is, the same people that hate on retail WoW for having dungeon finder, easier leveling, super convenient/casual gameplay etc. are the same ones taking the path of least resistance in the beta and spamming dungeons over and over because it's easier.
---
  respawning speed is already ingame i think am i correct ?
---
you when you want the same dungeon with different difficulty levels  
---
relax, it won't happen, so no further stupid questions, thanks  &lt;3
---
Playing BFV, just trying to get all the guns gold. Not as bad of a game as alot of people say
---
Because TBC is TBC, and will definitely appeal to TBC players, and Classic is Classic, and will definitely appeal to Classic players. These are known facts. You can project out and say over 12 months Classic will generate 160 million dollars in revenue. Then you could probably make some sort of similar forecast for Burning Crusade, saying it would make, I dunno, 80 million dollars in revenue over 12 months (being extremely conservative in my estimates here - I think BC would be more popular than Classic long-tail but would not have the initial short-tail burst, especially since it would be coming out later down the line once BFA is no longer a thing). How much money would Blizzard have to invest to generate that revenue for Burning Crusade? They don't have to bring in any raid testers or designers, it is only solely engineers, maybe like 20 million dollars between the engineers, support staff, CMs, etc (I literally have no clue how much support costs now since a lot of that has been outsourced to India IIRC)? Worse case you're talking about a four-hold return, best case maybe a ten-fold return?
---
Now, how much money do you have to spend designing new content? And how much revenue are you going to generate? It's risky business. Burning Crusade players playing your 1.13 patch are not a sure thing - you may alienate them (not Burning Crusade-like enough). Classic players playing your 1.13 patch are not a sure thing - you may alienate them (too much like Burning Crusade). You may spend tens of millions of dollars, and then actually decrease revenue you had previously locked in revenue. That's an absolute nightmare. That's literally "fire the dev team" level of bad decision-making at that point. And even if you have an upswing, most patches only last 6 months, so the absolute best case dream scenario you're probably talking about like 60 million dollars of revenue - maybe a two-fold return on an insanely high risk. It's just not worth it. 
---
It's so risky. God damn, the fact that you're actually arguing about this, **YOU** are arguing in bad faith. **BURNING CRUSADE IS SURE MONEY AND CAN'T FAIL. 1.13 IS NOT SURE MONEY, AND EVEN IF IT IS THE BEST VERSION IF ITSELF IS NOT HIGHER PAY-OFF THAN BC. WHAT ARE YOU NOT GETTING?**
---
Why in the world would you play a beta of a game that takes sooooo much time invested to get to 30 and now even 40 just to watch it get wiped, even if they gave a title at launch it's still wasted investment unless your a power House streamer that gets the hype money for playing in such beta. You want to play so you can stream it's really what it boils down to. Streaming has screwed up the point of betas. 
---
You want in on the beta go play on a private server.
---
Thank you for this
---
You dont understand and it really shows.
---
Pleas give me ONE way it “cuts costs” to have layering.....
---
Go holy the second your 60. Go do dungeons to get gear, and accumulate gold at the same time. If you're going to stay shadow in order to farm some gold, you're not going to be a better geared at the end of it.
---
Theres an easy solution to that. Skip the quest that needs that mob.
---
Try out different games. Ideally different genres so you don't burn out on MMO's itself.
---
I just bought the Disgaea for my switch. Amazing game if you are willing to play something very different.
---
You could try out Monster Hunter World if you haven't already. Dark Souls of course is amazing (start with 1 and maybe skipp 2) 
---
There a ton of games out and I'm sure you can get them very cheap through g2a or steam etc.
---
So funny how people downvote, because they Pay2Win players as well xD
---
I never liked Varian anyway.
---
His return coincided with Wow's decline.
---
Both are absolutely viable for pvp.
---
For professions you need Engineering to be a serious pvp player, and the second one is up to you. Alchemy is very helpful both at 60 and with pvp generally. You can also go Mining/Engineering to earn more gold and spend less on mats.
---
Brought to you by the same people that complains about retail feeling dead because there isn't enough people around you.
---
Mainly masturbating and watching beta streamers..... sometimes masturbating while watching beta streamers.
---
&gt; According to people who have worked this out for 14 years
---
You do realise private servers have been wrong this entire time and that dungeons are even easier than they are on privates, right? And that it all needs to be recalculated in Classic?
---
For me, I have always been marking targets with:  
---
F5 - Skull
---
F6 - Cross
---
F7 - Moon
---
F8 - Square  
---
For when Classic will release I will probably find keys easier to reach for that.  
---
The stances can be bound directly in settings, just like pet commands. However, I put them out as Z X C (Which will be my stance dance keys) out in the action bar to the right just for show.
---
It helps for starting zones, but could possibly be abused with regards to rare spawns. You could potentially drag an entire guild to a specific zone to force certain spawns to farm their drops.
---
PServers are literally keeping me sane right now - Give it a try, if you worry about burnout as you say then play a class/race you would NEVER play usually. Keeps things different and lets you pretend your in the beta lol.
---
That's what I meant. The "attunement quest" for MC isn't really an attunement it's just a shortcut. I see how the wording could be interpreted as the attunement WAS to jump through the window rather than FOR as I meant. Was basically trying to jog the guy's memory that MC didn't technically have an attunement since he was on the fence about it.
---
Can confirm, it is slower. I never understood why anyone would take it instead of the flight path.
---
Don’t forget that what the players we’re seeing in beta are mostly interested in reaching level 40 as quickly as possible.
---
Streamers will want to get to 40 so they can churn out content at the current max level, while powergamers want to learn as much as they can about leveling quickly before release.
---
These two groups of players don’t represent the majority of WoW players. Not all of us want to rush to max level.
---
&gt;  it sounded like at least the efficacy of just grinding mobs for XP was rather alright.
---
The efficiency is alright, and grinding will be a big part of my leveling process.
---
But that will be SOLO GRINDING.
---
Dungeons are not good for grinding mobs. It simply takes far too long. Unless of course, as pointed out above, if you have a lot of people who are for crazy reasons way more powerful than they are supposed to be at their respective level.
---
It's a private server thing if I remember correctly. Got no source for that though.
---
keep telling yourself that buddy.
---
I've moved on.
---
To cocaine. 
---
Gamer cocaine.
---
Thank you for understanding layering! :)
---
Holy shit lmao, I wish vanilla had that many npcs there.
---
I bet you’ll remember them better than you think if you friend them
---
They don’t seem triggered at all
---
They are in bis gear that took them 6 /days played to farm and enchant with 225 engineering.
---
Also, not all classes are invited to those streams, just the aoe classes
---
Haven't played since 2011, so I hopped on live servers with the starter account last night to mess around with low level characters. Can't wait for classic because I hate the starting areas now lol
---
Not sure what their respawn tech is or how it's supposed to work, but I know valley of trials on the last stress test was absolute hell.
---
I can see the thread won't get anywhere, but I find it amazing that people read this and rush to the conclusion that "I want Heroics in Classic".
---
is this loss?
---
You do know the difference here, yes?
---
In vanilla, nobody knew the priest racials beforehand. Everybody picked the race they wanted to play by aesthetics, which of course would be night elves and humans over dwarves. Now, everybody knows dwarves are by far the best race for priests. So, you will certainly see a shift amongst the raiding population.
---
&gt; If your guild can’t succeed because they only have 1 or 2 dwarves, they probably don’t deserve to be considered hardcore anyway.
---
What kind of argument is that? A hardcore guild wants to clear content as quickly and easily as possible. Dwarf priests make clearing content easier, so hardcore guilds will use dwarf priests. You might as well say "a guild doesn't deserve to be called hardcore unless they do Garr, Geddon and Shazzrah or Firemaw, Ebonroc and Flamegor simultanously". Artifically making things harder for yourself for no reason isn't an attribute of a hardcore guild.

Karazhan 🕶️

---
Who's the Tank.
---
What's the Mage.
---
Idk's the Priest.
---
You know that they developed that system just for the launch. It did not just appear out of nowhere. 
---
They spend time (=money) developing it, just to remove it in phase 2. 
---
If they wanted to cut cost, they would either do nothing or just use sharding. I am happy that they did none of these two.
---
THE AGING PROCESS SHALL COMMENCE
---
Me and my brother who never have played games together are planning to play together. We are torn between double hunter and hunter/priest. Any options would be welcome.
---
Play what seems most fun to you. Farming gold for mats and gear is going to take longer on a warrior, but it takes longer still on a class you don't want to play and don't log onto often.
---
Farming soulshards, specifically, is not as bad as it seems, and if your raid is competent you will likely not have to leave the raid, farm, and rejoin often if at all.
---
I'm not contesting that people will or won't have BiS gear at 30. It's obvious that they won't. What i'm saying is, the people that have hated on retail WoW for years for adding convenience options/dumbing down the game are the same ones going for the most convenient option in the beta. It's ironic.
---
But the healing feels nice...
---
People will always strive to do things in the most efficient way.... is this news to you?
---
Maybe, but I'm generally bad with names. :(
---
This is what im in favor of. How about a new raid between MC and BWL that has gear sets for enhance shaman, feral druids, ret paladins etc?
---
Testing out my 1-15 route on Pservers and playing monster hunter world.
---
./ignore 😅?
---
My server got famous for becoming an empty shell after spanish realms were opened. Killed it all. Ungoro maffia gone, wpvp gone, remaining english speaking player base gone. Oh also Shadowpie, Deadlyblonde and Alius Orbis I guess. 
---
Agamaggan was the server.
---
Did you ever read the Blackrock realm forums? There was an undead shadow priest who continually said "smasht" to people who would complain about him ganking. Any idea of their name?
---
Do ALL quests for Horde. (All three starting areas, all zones, all dungeons.)
---
Get Pre-raid armour/weapons.
---
Exalted in Alterac valley.
---
I haven’t touched vanilla in a very long time. So to scratch my itch I started up on a pserver to pass the time and to re-familiarize myself with the starting zones and quests so when the official servers kick off I can have more of a game plan and know what I’m going to do next also helps me figure out what I’ll actually play come launch.
---
"Quit liking what I don't like!"
---
As a druid, if im polymorphed that mean im in human form, if im in human form its most likely to heal myself 
---
By polymorphing me you allow me to get health for no mana cost, you wont oom me like that.
---
You could also use an actionbar addon to move the right action bar above the left ones so its more intuitive knowing which number + ctrl you have to use. 
---
I addtion I only use numbers from 1-5 and Q, E, R, F, V so my fingers never go far away from WASD
---
&gt; As I said, I have a really good game to suggest to you. Retail WoW.
---
that the stupidest argument one can make.  
---
more so considering the fact that I was at no point advocating for anything like this.
---
only because you prefer an automated system over not being able to participate at all does not make you want a different game.  
---
especially not a vastly different one. 
---
&gt; It has all the "advantages" you want.
---
given time there will be addons that do just this.
---
&gt; Don't you realise that bringing those things to Classic will make it... well, just like retail?
---
it won't.
---
same as upgrading your muffler on a ford won't make it a ferrari.
---
&gt; So why bother remaking Classic at all then?
---
its the gameplay that matters.  
---
getting into a raid with an automatic interface does not change how the game is played.  
---
the only thing that happens is you replace spamming the chat channels with an addon (or interface) that does the search for you.
---
That's the "downside" of having keystones infinitely repeatable though. A lot of people do not view it as a big deal.
---
Looking forward to other things to cut down on time, NBA finals, NHL finals, ufc 238 this weekend, spider man far from home in a few weeks, ufc 239 around the same time.
---
After mid July I'll probably be fiending to play classic though.
---
That sub 30 day count will be hard :)
---
Would you give us your opinion?
---
The correct answer is zero. Because a rogue won't (Or should not) get one.
---
I understand... for some people is just too hard and tiring to think outside the box...  
---
So, instead of discussing things carefully for a long time, let's just place everything in a dozen Blizzard devs' hands again. Classic+ **will** happen.
---
Combat rogues are some of the most under-appreciated dps  classes. Absolute monsters
---
It's the highest dps 2h sword in the game. Will of the ashbringer does nothing stat-wise - it just discolors your character to a darker shade of colors (like the disgusting oozling aura) and makes the sword whisper stuff to you. It also makes the scarlet monestary cathedral friendly to you and there is a RP event. Look up "ashbringer scarlet monestary" on youtube for people doing this event.
---
sucks to be you boy  
---
disgrace to your father and mother
---
There won't be. The people browsing this subreddit doing polls are not an accurate representation of the population that'll be playing wow classic. And many of those who decide to initially play warlock will switch, because of how unrewarding it is in the early stages. 
---
Dotting stuff up to watch it die before it even ticks twice is not a good feeling. The reason Warlocks were underrated in Vanilla was for this very reason. They aren't super valuable early because dotting something up to have it die in seconds is pointless. Then, once you get geared, you can't even dot stuff up in raids because of the debuff limit. So it neve really feels like the potential of the class 'unlocks' and you end up shadowbolt spamming through all content.
---
Doesn't mean it isn't good. But tons of people won't play it, thats for sure.
---
You seem to just ignore what people are saying though. Yes, people will always look for the fastest way of leveling and that's questing. The only reason people are doing this now in the BETA is simply because they have the best possible gear for level 30 AND the grind ends at level 40. So they don't have to worry about stuff like gold, important quest chains, gear improvements, etc etc.
---
When they hit 40 their gear will be obsolete because they ran the same 2-3 dungeons for 10 levels, but that doesn't matter in the BETA because the cap is 40 and not 60.
---
I can promise you that you won't see a single person grind dungeons when classic releases, it's literally not worth it.
---
Let me tell you from leveling in the Orc starting zone during the stress test, it was anything but smooth. Even in a 5 man group the first quest (kill 10 boars) took nearly an hour because it was so hard to get tags. God forbid you try doing a quest that require drops. Quests for named mobs had like 5-10+ minute respawn timers with 5 groups fighting to get the the tag first.
---
STV is a warzone even without streamers, especially at the fresh launch of a server. Especially around the Nessingwary quests. It'll 100% be that way on every PvP server, regardless of streamers.
---
Come the fuck on. It's just a beta. A closed beta. You got in? Sweet. You didn't? Tough cookies crybaby. They have an obligation to make testing possible so we can get a good game come August, not to give neckbeards that played since 1804 the ability to have fun a few months before everyone else.
---
Spirit is actually one of the best stats if you're wanting to speed level.
---
You know I just remembered that the very first day 1 character I created was Horde on Blackrock because it was "The aussie server" but the Orc starting zone was truly ridiculous so I switched servers. It really was full.
---
I never thought it was that interesting; you're fighting mostly non-Forsaken undead, worgen and some remnant humans. And the whole "you woke up and you're undead--i guess we're evil now! Show us how loyal you are to your evil undead elf queen" schtick never really appealed to me. Tirisfal and Silverpine blend together in my mind; the undead corruption and gloom aesthetic overpowers the fact that Silverpine is supposed to be more of a forest.
---
They're going to be one of the most popular classes. Remember, since they're only available for one faction, you gotta take all the class populations and just about half them to see the number on each side.
---
Exactly, thats why i made a seperate poll and shamans are on the top along with the warriors. Even at other demographics they are never below 4th.Quite popular
---
Thanks
---
This better be a druid named Pabloescobear.
---
Welcome in this sub. I've read your last sentence and knew people will freak out about it.
---
&gt; Classic+ 
---
This triggers next level autism on some people. 
---
Which I understand to a certain extend since it gets posted like 5 times a day
---
Really hope the drop rates are not higher like this in classic. That would be devastating to the economy
---
As been mentioned before. The main reason they do this, is because they are very overgeared for their level so they can. 
---
Blizzard definitely won't have the feeling that all those convenience options they added are the correct ones.
---
If Blizzard was the employer and every player an employee who have the task to level up and do your daily grind/quest. Then yes, the convenience options might have been a good addition because it makes everything more efficient and streamlined. New hires will learn their job much quicker and start to contribute to the business a lot sooner.
---
Luckily, we are players and not employees. We want to get the most enjoyment out of our playtime, that doesn't always mean the most efficiency in doing a certain task/quest. Having options like 1. level through dungeons, 2. level by questing, 3. level by killing millions of boars, etc... give you possibilities to choose your own road, which is what (at least I) a lot people enjoy in games.
---
Whats this BFA double marriage license? 'Fuck every previous girlfriend once more before you can get flying, I mean your 2nd marriage training'
---
FUCK ION lol
---
Towards the end of TBC
---
Not news at all. Definitely not news to Blizzard either, seeing as that is exactly why they changed the game.
---
Do you have some info on this? I didnt think really any of the original game designers were working on classic. Most arent even at blizzard anymore. Mark Kern, John Staats, Kevin Jordan. Even guys like Chris Metzen...all gone.
---
The dps was nice, but it had no stats except for the negative stamina. You needed lots of stam in naxx40 because of several bosses aoe dmg. 
---
Theorycrafting at the time could explain the math better. Maybe if someone could dig up an archive of elitist jerks website to prove it cause that life steal is nothing to write home about. By tier 3 that 200health steal is like 1-2% of max hp on a 1-5% chance to proc.
---
Why would you need a new one? Itll run on anything.
---
terrible sense of math you have 😂
---
Damn that's a great idea. He was called Viperx because I was watching Black mirror at the time.
---
My lil brother saw that poll and was extremely sad.He would roll a shammy but now he doesnt want his clas to be that popular lol
---
Warcraft 3 was pretty much rpg first, rts second. Starcraft I I didn't really have hero units as far as I recall.
---
Why you even update classic? For what? If you dont want to change any of battle.net friends system etc? How you are not gonna broke classic when you release new expansion and how not classic gonna limit you on those working fields? 
---
They are not using same server and database. Structure is the same. They just need battle.net interactions to be same when you think.  Which is cross game &amp; platform. 
---
I mean i dont think they are change anyting on their system just for classic. Even ptr files are seperated from the game. And next expansions beta/alpha also. 
---
If they want tbc there are different servers. Otherwise they are gonna do same mistake twice. Which there is no connection with our subject.
---
Nwm. You are gonna see. But probably gonna forget this topic :)
---
And then downvoting all the streamer posts

#MAAAAAM POOOOOOPPPP TRAY
---
People leaving will be rampant the first couple months until the retail players either leave or figure out its not a Zerg fest.
---
Can’t wait to ask a hunter to pull a mob into a trap and them having no idea what I’m talking about.  At least Mages will know how to sheep....
---
I’m expecting a HUGE learning curve (with me as well) so going into it knowing that, it’ll be much easier to deal with.
---
Best way to pass the time waiting for people to get to an instance is to fish!
---
If you're looking for something to counter rogues and warriors, [this short video should be helpful.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX1dPTAQ5_U)
---
Yeah, but if you get polymorphed the mage can reset both health and mana. So you will just avoid that and morph, spending mana.
---
Not sure that questing instead of dungeon running indicates an "RP ideology". I am into just wandering around, questing, farming mats and at no f'n time am RPing.
---
druids can MT raids
---
I raided as a healer, and I would occasionally respec for other things, but the cost kept me from doing it too often.  
---
I would run a hybrid spec if we weren't doing progression though.
---
Boy? What the fuck am I reading?
---
I'm talking more about later on, yeah no low level Taurens or Undead can pay me, but there are plenty of people who just can't be fucked waiting for the zep or flightpath, so they'll happily hand over 1g to get to their dungeon/quest faster
---
I've used the mega for the mac client a couple times. Worst part is having to wait for it to finish your download since the file size is above the free download limit. If you still cant find one get Soulseek and PM me. Might be able to basically transfer it directly.
---
based
---
Damn. He’ll find his own class for sure. Tell him to try hunter, they wont be that popular this time
---
IMO in the first few weeks in which leveling is super important, if a rogue is that lvl they will most likely keep leveling to be one of the first 60 rogues and then start ganking the shit out of people. Just my opinion though
---
Most of them or at least similar ones have been around since then (and let's not forget that there were much "worse" ones), so I don't really know, where you are coming from with that sentiment.  
---
I believe "just don't use it" is exactly the best response to give because a) if someone's idea of classic contains a complete celibacy from addons, then that's only because said person chose not to use them/didn't know about them and b) if someone is vehemently against the use of addons, I highly doubt that person would have the intent of playing at the high-end (which is fine, everyone should be able to play the game at their own pace and their own level/kind of investment), which does make me fail to see how "putting themselves behind others" would matter anyways.
---
...players will always pick the most convenient and easiest option.
---
The point is that the developer shouldn't necessarily give them that option.
---
Well, there are several ways to go about this. The two obvious ways are either stay in your optimal raiding spec or respec for raid nights (which requires you to farm some gold per week to afford).
---
Another way to do it is with a hybrid spec. For example for MC a mage will run frost, which is also the spec used for PvP and AoE farming. So you can just do a spec that has the most important dmg modifiers (which you want in PvP as well anyways), but still take some extra utility talents instead of the lesser dmg modifiers. It won't impact your PvE dmg by that much and you can do PvP and AoE farming with the same spec. Some classes does this easier than others (for example a hunter below hit cap will play MM/SV in raids, which is also an excellent PvP spec, only really a few talents you might change, but nothing major. Other classes might need more tweaking and have to settle more in between optimal PvE and PvP specs.)
---
Now, the biggest problem is when you want different roles. A prot warrior might want to go arms or fury for everyday playing and PvP, so they can't just do the hybrid thing.
---
Also, remember people can't inspect your build in Classic. You will see a lot of guilds preaching that you *need* optimal spec to join them or even PuGs demanding it. Seriously, if you spend a few points in some utility for PvP instead of 1% extra damage they won't ever know.
---
I'm thinking about going healer again (was a priest for most of vanilla), horde side.
---
I know about the priest, so my questions are about druid and shaman.
---
Considering I'll probably be raid specced most of the time, how do those classes do outside of raids/instances? Stuff like farming, interesting ways to use your class special abilities (stealth?) etc. Basically the flavor of the class when not performing raid duties but without respeccing all the time.
---
You do realize that this process started in Vanilla already, and got refined on PServers that did not inflate HP/dmg numbers in dungeons, right?
---
But again, same to you: If you want to grind dungeons, because you think it's faster have at it :D
---
Tagging mobs is gonna be rough. It took over an hour to get to level 6 during the stress tests, that was in Durotar and Deathknell. I usually leave the starter area close to lvl 7 from the small grinds to and from quests. This time I barely dinged 6.
---
&gt;Break up with her just so r/Classic can marry her
---
There are multiple reasons to why “everyone” is leveling this way. Which I assume only means the people you see leveling, which are streamers and youtubers 
---
1) They are “BiS” - majority of the people you probably watch/see leveling this way in the beta from 30-40 have been at cap (lvl30) for some time now. This has given them time to get more gear and/or money and well, everything. This immensely increases your effectiveness in leveling through dungeons.
---
2) They have an instant and “infinite” supply of group members - anyone streaming has followers who would love the opportunity to play with them. For average players you will need to go back to town way more often to refill groups and also you won’t always end up with competent players and things happen. This makes dungeon grinding super inefficient in the long run. Even if you have a “squad” you’re leveling with, chances are you won’t all have the same gaming times for the week or two or three that’ll be necessary for the average player to hit level cap.
---
3) avoiding fan interference - If you happened to watch the stress test on twitch via asmongold or esfand (probably other streamers too), you’d notice that it was nearly impossible for them to level in the open world due to the attention and flooding of players to be around them. Now, this was an isolated incident because many people had nothing better to do than join the masses during the stress test. Even so, there will always be “stream snipers” that will either target them for PvP in the open world or try and mess with their tags, etc while leveling.
---
NOW, even if you are not referring to content creators well, numerically it is just less efficient to level through dungeons unless you have the quests for them when you go to run them.
---
TL;DR- you have a skewed perception of the leveling experience due to the content that a small majority of the player base is release which doesn’t reflect the masses.
---
Still good money to make at that lvl ^^
---
A worthy trade.
---
also having hundred thousand ppl watching streamers actually helps, who knew
---
Spirit is one of the best stats regardless of leveling speed, for locks however they still want to prioritise other stats, spirit isn't good for them.
---
The average wow raider now is far far more skilled than they were in Vanilla and it isn't close. I played everything but cata and Vanilla is my favorite time but if you honestly think anything in those raids compares to even the first tier of mythic raiding this expansion then you are delusional.
---
What you mean solution to layering? Layering is a solution to overpopulated starter zones at launch.
---
I wasnt aware that we need solution for the solution
---
I think I remember timing it in wrath when it was released. If I'm remembering correctly, during wrath, fp was faster by a small margin. Might've changed later on by increasing the zep speed or idk if fp's were upgraded again
---
In other words u mean that in the end-game(60)we will see way less shamans than my strawpoll indicates?They are literally topping the list right now and some others polls had them on top2 aswell
---
My thought on Orc was for the stun resist paired with SL.
---
I use the following keybinds for the main bar:
---
1,2,3,4,5,6,R,X,Shift+X,Shift+T, 9, 0 (last two are non combat binds)
---
left hotbar I use: F,G,H,T,Z,V,B,E,Y,C,Q,Mousewheel click
---
right hotbase I use: F1,F2,F3,F4
---
I used some of these keybinds in Dark age of Camelot and I carried them over to WoW and made some new ones.
---
I also bind strafe left to A and strafe right to D. I don't know how anyone can leave those as turn left and turn right.
---
People always take the path of least resistance.
---
I've come to appreciate grinding mobs since joining the r/woweconomy sub and taking up gold farming in WoD. Every mob is a chance for rare loot. Same as it ever was in Vanilla.
---
My hats off to you if you k ow your way around Gnomer and ST.  Those place still confuse the fuck out of me...
---
That's just wrong... People don`t like the dungeon finder because you simply Queue - get ported - Queue - get ported. Do different dungeons and move to the dungeon that fits your Level the most. You even get extra XP while doing Dungeonfinder. It's a completely different Thing. 
---
And simply because a handful of streamers does it doesn't mean that it was the right decision. They are trying to rush to 40 and get good gear on the way so they don't have to farm as much on 40 anymore.
---
There is plenty of People that don't want to rush and take their time. Dungeonfinder is just a Little extra Thing for People that don't even want to move out of the City and walk from dungeon to dungeon...
---
You are simply just trying to piss People off atm just get out of here
---
Corsair void wireless is one of the cheaper wireless headsets. I absolutely love mine also use Corsair strafe silent keyboard and with g502 mouse for FPS or Corsair scimitar for mmo. Love them all
---
A douche with more copper though.
---
&gt; I don't know if I'd call it a hardcore guild, but we'll probably be raiding two nights a week with a DKP system.
---
Don't call it a hardcore guild then.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmDRt_QwJfU
---
Same keybinds I use. 
---
Except my ctrl1 and ctrl2 are mouse wheel up/down and I use them for interrupts.
---
Sounds amazing! Have joined the dicsord :) see you in august
---
The Stockade is already kinda that, albeit higher level.
---
I could see this conversation happening in the executive meeting room for sure
---
Yes I know all that, my point is that if there are addons that become so integral to PVP for example that not using them means you are literally at a disadvantage and worsening the experience for yourself by not having it. But if it wasnt available at all then we would simply have pvp in a purer form. You can't simply not use addons in that case. Furthermore, addons have in my opinion contributed to things that have led to where WoW retail has gone. 
---
Things like DBM led to raids and dungeons becoming even harder so that people using DBM wouldn't think they were easy. Whereas if you didn't have an addon telling you what to do you would have to think for yourself and it wouldn't be so easy in the first place. Gearscore definitely had a considerable effect on the introduction of iLVL and the mix of ilvl and LFR is pretty much how we have a minimum requirement now for dungeons and raid lfr.
---
Again I don't think all addons are evil or whatever, but there are ones that fundamentally change how wow is played and that is why I say some of them go against the spirit of classic. And I can't just NOT use them because wow is afterall a social game and if we are all gonna be on non-sharded servers and every pvper is using some addon that gives them a clear leg up and every raider is using an addon that gives them a clear leg up then I am left as the sole individual who is lagging behind and that DOES affect me even if I am not using it.
---
#BUT DONT THEY KNOW THEY COULD BUY A [MONITOR STAND](https://i.redd.it/mi5mkurbrj231.png) FOR THAT MUCH MONEY??
---
Just play on a private server. It'll help you get your plan sorted out for when you actually play. If you really think you're going to get 'burnt out' on 2 months in a private server then I guess it didn't really matter anyways, did it?
---
Does it make Scarlet mobs in EPL friendly too?
---
Is there gonna be a single server of each type( pvp/pve/rp) and just work with how many layers gonna be active?
---
Why would you walk from UC to Grom'Gol when there's a zep from both Org and UC there?
---
Cool Idea, I don't see many EU guilds in here, most of them seem to be US. Keep up the good work!
---
BTW: You should get in detail in which region server you want to be and which language is preferred in the guild ;)  
---
I am looking for a guild like this but I will 100% play on a german server (&amp;Guild?) because of IRL friends
---
Stinks

How do you type  § ?
---
There's another instance located in the tower that looks almost identical to the Stockades tower.
---
I was on Alleria. Risen was a pretty bad ass guild. Pretty sure we had the world first AQ opening as well.
---
Lots of crying.
---
Druid's can MT raids if they are geared to the teeth and have 39 other people that are okay with adapting to a Druid vs Warrior MT.
---
Basically you're asking 39 people to raid with a sub optimal tank just so you can play feral.
---
I'd rather OT as a Druid anyways.
---
Since Horde/Alliance split is relatively 50/50, this works pretty well. Another way to think about it is to cut all the other classes in half by 50%, since your faction will only have half of those but 100% of your Shaman/Paladin players.
---
It would be better in the hands of an offtank than a rogue. You're talking like 3 to 4 thunderfury's deep in a guilds raid progression. By that time, given the drop chances, I reckon Kel Thuzad would have to be on farm status for raid group B before rogues would be getting TF.
---
There are people in Ibiza/St Tropez/Monaco etc spending 40K on champagne daily... is that embarrassing too?

Dude, mistaking Flask of the titans for Limited Invulnerability potions is a past time of mine. Probably done it at least 3 times. We should petition to change the icon of flasks. 
---

---
Is rolling on RP-PvP realm also up for discussion or what do you mean exactly with “realm not decided yet”?
---
Spent nearly 30-40 minutes pickpocketing mobs that have a ~10% drop chance for a junkbox and didn’t get a single one.   
---
Rogues diaries require 5000 (???) lockpicking skill to open (also ???) and only vendor for 2.5s instead of 45.   
---
You can also sneak an auto attack in every time you sap without breaking it.  
---
Just to name a few, I may think of more when I wake up
---
Yeah, this process started in vanilla, when 99% of the playerbase was shit at the game and nobody fully understood it. It then got "refined" using private server data which has now been proven to be wrong. Yes, even the ones that did not inflate the numbers. They're all wrong, even if they're pretty close. Sorry to burst that bubble.
---
I'm not saying dungeon grinding will be better, I won't be doing it anyway because it's boring AF, but we currently do not know what is truly better at what point, until somebody does the work in Classic.
---
You do
---
oh cool, see ya in disco
---
Dynamic respawn is a game breaker.
---
Some mobs take time to respawn it should stay as it is. You should just look at layering like multiple server on 1 main server and after phase 1 it merge all thoses servers into 1 server.
---
I already responded in depth to the other person but wanting to play at a high-end level and not wanting certain addons that give a competitive edge in the game are not two mutual exclusive ideas.
---
Why not both?
---
Blizzard has never done that.
---
I'm in the market for a new game, preferably single player, preferably cheap.
---
Everyone thinks this.  Even a week after launch it will still be jam packed in starting areas.  Goos luck with that
---
Warlock main tank meta?
---
Uh yeah, sorry but if the supposedly cooperative makes me COMPETE with other players(with whom, again, I'm supposed to be cooperating and who are "friendly" towards me) - and compete in the worst possible way, that is indirectly - then that's a complete failure of design.
---
Ehhhh, I don't know about that. I have a Samsung  Ativ book 2 - It has an AMD Dual core E1-1500, 2gb ddr3 RAM and 500gb HDD + Integrated graphics card that I don't even know what it is and to close it off about 6 years of use. Lmao
---
Had to go to the comments to remember it, but goddamn that's genius.
---
&gt;Better FP in STV which makes 30-45 soooo much better
---
An extra FP
---
&gt; take you an extra 20 minutes 
---
and thats being optimistic
---
As long as you have a wow subscription you're good
---
E3 soon, music festival after that, CTR remaster, stress test days, some smaller gigs and movie releases, refreshing this sub every 3 minutes.
---
It's not enough. It's never enough.
---
Pretty sure I was in that guild after rerolling from Ally to Horde on Frostwhisper. Remember names like Plaguetongue and Lolflay,  that's about it though!
---
I don't even use WASD so I'd say more opinions are better so others can adapt to their liking.
---
It's just a design decision. There's usually more than one way to solve a problem in classic WoW - but the problem is always solvable. Bad design would be pre-nerf C'thun, which was completely unsolvable until it was shown to be impossible so they fixed it. I'd be careful about blaming Blizzard for how the community decides to solve a problem, if you expect them to guide players every time a problem comes up the game stops being fun.
---
Could probably do that with an addon.
---
Can you link the poll? I haven’t seen one that had shamans anywhere near warriors or mages
---
Its what degraded the game into the modern wow in a first place. While convenient for some people its definitely bad for the game as a whole
---
What class/spec takes the hammer?
---
How did they dupe the gold? anyone know?
---
Yes? Things can still be a waste of money even if you can afford it.
---
I’m not going to stop them, but I don’t have to respect them for being so wasteful and vain. 
---
Look at Johnny Depp. His extremely expensive wine habit has been a huge source of embarrassment and mockery for him. Getting caught up in unsustainable spending has also tanked his career by making him take shitty roles.

Saw someone locked out of dungeons yesterday for too many in an hour.
---
20mins at best. God forbid if it was any other role than dps.
---
No. I use 1 through 12 (keys at the top of the keyboard) because I have a mouse that has 12 of those keys corresponding with those 12 keys. Then I use q e r t f and sometime t and g I never use z x c or v and b because it's more of a stretch for me to use those. I'd rather use w  and s than those keys. Also I don't use f1 through f12 because they are a little outside the reach of my fingers for quick button presses. Of course that's just me personally
---
*Says the russian*
---
yeh, warlocks are secret best tank
---
I think it was going through an instance and having it selected, then it would double.  I really don't recall, and never did it, that was just what everyone was saying.
---
 We're gathering alliance people who'll be playing on EU servers and who'd like to raid. I don't know if I'd call it a hardcore guild, but we'll probably be raiding two nights a week with a DKP system. On top of that we were thinking it'd be nice with a guild full of reliable people for helping eachother and doing dungeons during leveling and for pre-raid-gear dungeon farming.
---
Exactly which days we raid, what DKP system, what realm we will be playing (probably PvP), and even the &lt;guild name&gt; are yet to be decided. You can very much take part in this, we all just want to have the decision-making done and ready for classic launch.

All classes rotations seems so boring, is there any class with a more complex/quick rotation, similar to rogue and warrior in legion?
---
Well a lot of folks double shammy and pally numbers, because they are one side only and thus make up a larger portion of that sides population.
---
I agree with you. I even like dipping into disc for the +15% shield absorb and PWFort buff +30% while leveling, makes a difference. Shadow is overrated.
---
I feel like Warrior and Warlock will have a lot of switches to Rogue and Mage respectively. They do have a lot of deterring features, compared to Rogue/Mage IMO.
---
Blizzard Scheming to get higher subs???? Next you'll tell me they released a 6 month mount right before a drought!!
---
anti-cheat, BNet integration up to creating and managing the whole game world. The only thing they could differ is lack of support for Vanilla specific features in the retail client (or just have them there just unused). All the work for Classic was converting old data to the new format and then fill missing support of old features in the current client. And in 2-3 years they will very likely implement TBC specific features just to follow it by WoTLK specific features another 2-3 years after ;) There is no point into freezing the client.

I somehow have the weird feeling that reddit was once designed for that exact reason. 
---
Because all of us neckbeards who know every information available of classic scroll through new now, we kind of sort the shit out for the hot page. Noobs come in here ask a question, after less than 4 mins they have an answer. People who have recommendations for classic+ get downvoted to hell. So all the HQ content gets approved by us and is allowed to be on hot/top
---
Been playing BDO on Xbox waiting for classic

We don't know the pop cap, you just need a sub to play

Honestly I've been stressing my ass off on what class I should roll as. Been looking at polls, watching videos on strengths and weaknesses etc. But in the end I realised it doesn't really matter too much, it's a huge mmo and I never bothered looking at this stuff my first time round, pick what you want and have a good time that's what the game is for :)
---
Assuming a few thousand (maybe 3k) have access and that is 1%, means 300k will eventually play classic.
---
Adding “a few decimals” would mean 3 million or even 30 million will play classic. I think 99% is a fair assumption to be honest.
---
Don't bother with this idiot. He didn't even read your other comment about how the items could be completely new.

I’ve been a clicker since BC. Keybindings seem too daunting to start now.

Thats so sick lol, so in SM you're just chilling with the boys

I will be honest with u..i always play the least popular classes usually hehe.It feels better in a way

Yea bois, the *monitor* is 6k.

Incorrect. https://youtu.be/XLmMHQErD88?t=413

There you go
---
Just download BfA and level to 20 as a trial, see how it plays. Assume Classic will be 15-20% lighter. If you can run at like 3/10 comfortably then you should be ok.

it was a good weapon. might of menethil was the highest dps 2h in the game at that point though (which dropped from KT)

Was a total huntard (Yeah i was one of those who bought the PvP arena axe in BC, thinking melee was an option) and noob when I first played.
---
Really keen to see how I compare now to back then and to see how far I can get.
---
What im tossing up atm is professions. I was a big pvper before so engineering/mining is high on the list but I cant recall so details. Did hunter tracking stack so would i see ore (hell did mining even have ore tracking in vanilla?) and same goes for Alchemy/Herb.
---
Otherwise it's enchanting or skin/lw but I cant recall a major benefit to lw
---
Half-Life 2 is great. But I can't play it again without being reminded of one of the biggest and most unjust unresolved cliffhangers in gaming history. It's almost as bad as Megaman Legends 2.
---
&gt;Bad design would be pre-nerf C'thun, which was completely unsolvable until it was shown to be impossible so they fixed it.
---
That one was simply overtuned like a lot of bosses. Usually not to a impossible degree, but still. The issue with the 4HM is that the actual required tactic (or at least what people used) was ridiculous.
---
&gt;I'd be careful about blaming Blizzard for how the community decides to solve a problem
---
Blizzard is creating a problem for the community to solve. Of course I am blaming Blizzard if the problem they created isn't clear enough and thus fucks up the experience.
---
Really only every 4?
---
https://strawpoll.com/r58fd7hw
---
No one will die because of community choices in WoW. And its not comparable anyway, im not asking for the community to writd the code. Im still saying that blizzard should do what the fuck they want but some rules wouldnt hurt. Aeronautic engineers have rules too. Its called physics. Something that doesn't exist in WoW.
---
Doesn't matter... They still did the dungeon without kicking anyone as soon as they fucked up, which is quite different from retail.
---
mannoroth was fun, chair and tiberius trolling all day. we had some good pvp players too noxn, menismyforte, nobodyseven etc.
---
Drinking, playing wc3, living on this sub lol
---
Or a lot of people trying to meta-slave by playing things like lock and warrior because they think it’s good will be the ones to quit the game.
---
Another thing about warlock - it was underrated because it was specifically unpopular back then, the general opinion being that it was less viable than it truely was. It’s not like it’s absurdly overpowered and people just didn’t know.
---
Same with people leveling warrior. That shit is rough, and come level 35-40 people are going to realize just how damn long they have to grind with this slow ass class and they will just quit the game.
---
This exactly...with that being said. they were usually 4th-5th in odler demographics..but so many it will feel weird
---
Have you played on a private server? They’re infested with literal /poltards spouting alt-right rhetoric. Racism and sexism are the norm on worldchat.
---
"Your own Stupidity" the hardest of Raid bosses
---
&gt; for regular use they were about the best. 
---
https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life
---
just roll whatever you want to play. don't not pick a class because you think it's going to be popular. skilled players will always trump non skilled players
---
I'm not trying to be mean here, only state the facts:
---
That Ret Paladin is in Full AQ Gear using Sulfuras, a weapon you might only see a few of per server... and he finishes the basically *one minute* test doing only 500 DPS. That's 300-400, sometimes even 500 DPS LESS than what a Warrior or Rogue will be capable of in similar gear.
---
Remember, fights last 5-10 minutes and in the video you linked that Ret Paladin, in some of the best gear in the game, burned all his mana in under a minute and a half. I know people want to play Ret and great! Do what's fun. But please realize you will *never* be competitive on DPS and that any guild kind of serious about raiding will only bring you as a niche roll and will only gear you with what Warrior's don't need or want.
---
That's a lot of work to compete with Rogues and Warriors who are already doing
---
Where is the option for "I still haven't figured out which of the five classes I am practicing on a  pserver will be the one I finally go with"
---
While this is true, Classic is *not* capable of utilizing DX12, which is where the confusion has come into this discussion. It's NOT running on an identical client as the BFA client, although it might be some form of 8.X. DX12 was added in 8.1 I believe, and with it the multi-threaded improvements. Those improvements are not found in the Classic client right now.
---
No, only the Highborne were arcane masters and 100% of them either became Naga or Blood Elves. All the Night Elves are “lowborn”.
---
Plus it's the best looking mount in the game IMO
---
It's pretty well done, however, as I read the pablo meme, it is more about loneliness and regret than boredom, did I miss something?
---
ok its once a minute, you got me
---
Kinda sad... dont you guys have gfs or jobs?
---
It’s such a small benefit to make up for a problem that any skilled guild has already solved without it. 
---
People don’t want to play dwarves unless they like dwarves because they think they’re ugly and they waddle instead of run and whatever other reason. Just like not every pvper on the horde is an orc or undead. 
---
You can pretend that everyone is going to be meta gaming all you want, but you’re in for a surprise when you get in to the game. Look up the group comps for some of the world first kills.
---
Wait there is actually a zeppelin that takes u to org?
---
A man slighted never forgets!
---
Sounds like envy to me.
---
These posts are tiresome. Chain running instances is NOT an IDEAL way to level, nor is it EFFICIENT in any sense of the word. 
---
Questing was the BEST and QUICKEST way to level during Vanilla and that will hold true in Classic. The ONLY reason these streamers are running instances so quickly is because they are in full BIS level 30 gear. 
---
While leveling up you won't have anywhere near the amount of BIS gear they are wearing now. Sure you may get lucky with drops here and there, but by no means will that give you such a massive powerboost that you can EFFICIENTLY grind instances to level.
---
By all means if anyone wants to grind instances go for it, do whatever you want. But at the end of the day it will NEVER be quicker than questing. 
---
In reality the only times it's really "worth" running an instance is to do the quests or if you have a large amount of rested xp built up.
---
Forming a group for a single run can take awhile depending on what you are running and the time of day. These streamers can form a group without issue because no one is doing anything else and being at the level cap already there is nothing else to do.
---
When Classic goes live the vast majority of people will want to hit 60 in the most EFFICIENT way possible, which is QUESTING. 
---
As someone who leveled as shadow and arms during Vanilla I would often take a break from questing to run a few instances back to back, not because I was getting more experience, but simply because I really enjoy healing and tanking. And it just felt good hoping into a group that has been looking for that tank/healer for awhile.
---
How is this a question?
---
Obviously it’s the one built and designed accounting to popular vote on an online forum.
---
Seriously though people have been waiting ~13 years for this game. Do we really want to open Pandora’s box just to have everyone clamoring for WoW Classic:Classic in 10 years? Cause ultimately that’s where this leads.
---
the 2% crit and 1% hit is pretty nice as well though, and yeah assuming the proc rates 5% which is in-line with a lot of other procs that would make it fairly decent
---
Now you're speaking my language lol
---
Imagine it dropped for him on his stream
---
Reminds me of one time back during Vanilla when a high school buddy of mine brought his computer over to my place and we played together. We were both on our mages doing stuff in the Blasted Lands and suddenly he lets out this huge gasp and starts freaking out. I thought maybe he’d been 360 noscope turboganked or something, when I got up and ran over to his screen, it turned out that a **[Glowing Brightwood Staff]** had dropped off a literal boar not too far from Nethergarde Keep.
---
That dude was hella lucky with his BoE drops — a month or so later he won an** [Elemental Mage Staff]** that dropped in an UBRS run we were both in.
---
I didn’t include the base resist because everyone has that.
---
Yeah, I'm asking since I play warrior as well and use F1-F8 for all the icons, was just curious what other fellow warriors do.
---
Z, X, C is pretty good for stances, maybe I should incorporate that.
---
Ah, the greater version do indeed.
---
I know what you mean, I feel similarly
---
I generally quest until 25-30 ish then grind mobs. I enjoy it and it's a lot of gold.
---
We should wait first of all for the release and after that, wait for phase 2 and see how many people are still playing and just taking a look
---
I miss Oxhorn :(
---
I just don't actually work at my job.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
MoP was not amazing lol
---
There is no point for me in browsing /hot because i see every single thread in /new anyway with the time i spend there
---
Nothing is better than UC. I was a level 30ish NE when I discovered UC for the first time and wanted to explore it so bad. Haven't played Alliance in years and UC is still my favorite city by far.
---
The culture of the Elves at that point revolved around the use of arcane. Yes the current nelves are/were the lowborn, but I was trying to say is the culture at the time revolved around the arcane, even if some elves didnt use it. Just like after they became druidic/worshipers of Elune
---
funnily enough I even start to recognize  some names in this sub. 
---

Sulfuras? Ret pally probably.
---
Meats to orgrimmar is race specific for Trolls and Orcs, and a bundle of hides is specific to Taurens, even if Taurens could take the quest for Trolls and Orcs, they would still have to traverse southern Barrens on foot, and the road from Camp Taurajo to Crossroads, can be a bit rough, with an elite group patrol included, whereas from Crossroads to Orgrimmar is pretty safe even for level 1 chars.
---
You’ll also have a subset, the same subset that flocked to pservers and ultimately led to us getting WoW Classic:Classic when you implement changes. You can’t appease everyone. The goal is a faithful recreation, so why not leave it as a faithful recreation?
---
Nothing wrong with playing how you like but the top streamers don’t really do that. They play whatever is the most efficient way possible bypassing anything that could be enjoyable so as not to play less efficiently. 
---
There is a good size chunk of players/streamers that only care about beating the game and doing it as quickly as possible. All I’m saying is don’t play that way because you see a streamer doing so.
---
It's true any idiot could make a raid but it would take a lot of thought to design new gear that doesn't ruin everything in vanilla. As it stands, t3 is already way too powerful. If it's not atleast on par with t3 there won't be any reason to run the content. There's plenty of room to add raids in between pre-raid-t2.5 but adding anything after naxx is playing with Fire.
---
He never asked about rogue races, only mage.
---
Macestun+prep rogue with Ironfoe and Felstriker
---
&gt; When were the summoning stones (that actually summon) introduced anyway? End of vanilla or during TBC? Can’t recall 
---
My first recollection of summoning people via stones was Karazhan. That doesn't mean they weren't there before. My memory might just be worse as I am getting older.
---
Most tanks will be warriors. As a warrior I’d be happy to take hunters because they don’t *really* compete with me on gear, a few weapons notwithstanding, and are probably the best levelling dungeon DPS along with mage.
---
I don't know about you but I love dotting stuff up and watching it slowly die. Specifically in PvP.
---
Sure, but he had to literally run multiple times through a mob to even get his attention and was sometimes just unable to aggro some of them. Also he said that after leveling up it seemed to be easier to pull... so my feeling just watching it was that something is off/it is working inconsistent.
---
People do know you need an active sub to be able to play Classic once its out right? Unless that changed?
---
Wait wait wait... who pays a lot for which pets?
---
the Scarelt Crusade is a racist group doe
---
They could decrease the layer size to 500 for launch day.
---
Same for me. At work I browse reddit. As soon as i come home I focuse on learning for my exams. 
---
Basically I'm spending my time at work with fun. And me free time with working/studying
---
If you get to 34-40 as a warrior you've done the hard part already.
---
I mean they were never underrated in pvp
---
Oh yeah, 3-6 months in and blizzard will start planning on a cash shop. Activision will be down their throats to make more money
---
I really like this idea. As I played both tanks and healers during Vanilla I ran with a lot of people and my friends list just didn't cut it so like others have said I had a notepad file that had a running list of names.
---
People I blacklisted simply had an "X" next to their name.
---
Hand of Ragnaros ? Both in vanilla and pservers it has been an OS roll thing, its very expensive and some people just dont want it because its a 3000g + investment.
---
Except they wont buy it because its limited to only one type of output.
---
Vanilla flavored Mountain Dew sounds absolutely disgusting.
---
Absolutely. Plenty of reasons there will be sudden changes to their choice after launch.
---
Noob question. Won’t the actual friends list work? I have added some toons with notes.
---
I think you know the answer to the girl friend part lol and do you not spend all your time at work on reddit?
---
I still remember back in the day if it wasnt for this drop i was never going to join enough money to buy my lvl 40 mount. I  ended up selling it for quite alot of gold.
---
I haven’t. I played BfA a bunch at launch and still play some now. Skipped heroics and went straight into Mythic dungeons week 1. Never use LFG and never just got ported to a dungeon.
---
My definition if fun is the only one that matters to me. So it is the right one. 
---
For you you're definition is the only one that matters.
---
dynamic spawns are bad when the zerg leaves. solo players cannot kill fast enough to be able to leave an area without dying. this was already proven on Pservers.
---
If you've been there before... then you know that you're gonna get burnt out raiding content you've done....
---
In my opinion
---
i will pay in blood
---
Level 42-44 is considered the halfway point to 60 and those who have worked so hard on warrior at this point are likely to get exhausted when they realize just how far away they still are.
---
No shit
---
Theres a trick to bypass the google drive limit. Click on the link and press "Add to my google drive", go to your google drive and right click it and press make a copy, then download the copy.
---
&gt; Of course I am blaming Blizzard if the problem they created isn't clear enough and thus fucks up the experience.
---
That gets into a subjective area - I don't recall anybody in 2006 having serious problems that it was an impossible problem to solve, guilds just went out and got some extra tanks. If the entire community was up in arms over this particular issue, then they might have gone back and tweaked the encounter somehow. The fact that Naxx was a fairly exclusive raid and there was a lot of anticipation for TBC probably had a lot to do with it. Plus a lot of guilds had stopped raiding, so there were probably some decently geared tanks around who didn't mind coming to a Naxx fight.
---
In 2020 it will be interesting to see how guilds handle the 4H encounter, will they experiment with different strats or just prepare 8 geared tanks ahead of time?
---
Howdy to all my fellow new browsers xD this is becoming kind of a meta joke
---
Ok?
---
I was just stating my preference
---
For all we know it was most likely the correct drop rate, which is 0.02%. Just because he happened to be streaming when he looted it doesn’t mean the drop rate percentages are skewed.
---
Llane-Us Horde. There was a Warrior named Gauss. Who owned the enchanting mats on the server. He had enough gold to constantly buy out all of the shards and throw them back up doubled in price. Even ended up with a guild Called Army of Gauss.
---
Army of Gauss
---
Entropic Order High end Raiders on our server pretty sure they killed naxx bosses not sure how many.
---
are the only guilds i really remember from vanilla. Doubt ill ever forget.
---
Yeah, you are right. I guess before release is too soon... even those who have something to contribute may be a little sensitive now.
---
I wouldn’t recommend private servers to pass the time for a few reasons:
---
1) it feels completely different from the actual game, I’ve played private servers and the beta client for stress test and ever since the private server looks and feels wonky as hell.
---
2) you ever hear of edging? If not that’s okay. But the point is that if you don’t touch WoW at all until August 27th it will feel even better when it’s released.
---
3) if you go onto private servers to practice, a lot of the data is simply wrong. The amount of damage you deal, the health of mobs, exp they give, drop tables, etc. 
---
To answer your question, I’m just refreshing this reddit and watching beta streams... nothing else seems to bring me enjoyment in terms of video games, I’ve been enjoying golfing and drinking beer in the meantime.
---
Assuming the joke is how obvious of a move this is for Blizzard?
---
Apple fanbois will never listen.
---
Is "Sunshine" an insult now?
---
There's likely way less of it going on now compared to peak WoW, but as an example, [Here's](https://www.ebay.com/itm/World-of-Warcraft-Classic-Collector-Edition-mit-Diablo-Zergling-Panda-Loot-WOW/321702400165?hash=item4ae6f510a5:g:29cAAOSwBahVOppD) someone who bought the vanilla collector's edition pets for $500 at the weekend. That's just for some *pets*. Makes it easier to understand why someone would pay triple that for the very coveted classic beta access.
---
I disagree. Hybrids should never be as effective in damage or healing as pures are. That's the sacrifice of being a hybrid. It doesn't make any sense otherwise. When they made hybrids on par with pures in terms of output, a significant portion of the population in modern WoW started maining hybrids. I think hybrids are even the most played classes in BFA. Pures deserve a bit of extra oomph for the lack of sustainability that hybrids get to enjoy. I like that variation. Does more to make each class distinct in style like the class lock on pallys and shamans.
---
Or any content past lfr/lfg systems.
---
Where is the raid? I have no clue. Tells me the only raids you have done have been lfr. Which tells me you’re gripes that BfA is bad are based on a lack of playing any real content.
---
Don’t forget most these polls are just sampling the population on Reddit.  Fair assumption that the Reddit population may not be an accurate reflection of Classic WoW player population.  Also ex ante polls can’t capture the possibility that many players will reroll when they discover leveling priests &amp; warriors is not as fun as rogues &amp; mages for example.
---
Ah.  I have stuff like the wrath and cata collectors pets and since I’ll be sticking to classic I won’t need that stuff.
---
Yes. Absolutely.
---
"Players will always find the most boring way to play your game, and do that."
---
People act like the design principles that moved the industry away from Vanilla came out of nowhere. They didn't. They came from people like that doing things like this.
---
You should definately level how you want. The problem is when people ask for genuine advice on how to improve but get responses like ''it's about the journey'' or ''vanilla is not meant to be rushed''.
---
Don't kink shame.
---
Seperate database. (Retail/classic) some seperate files on same folder (Retail / classic) So when next expansion came out are they gonna change classic database structure too? What if they need radical changes for next expansion? Is classic gonna limit them some of the subject? 
---
Why we are installing 60gb on every new expansion beta/ptr etc if wow actually have framework-like base client like this? 
---
You can’t freeze client because you need to improve your game every expansion. Which means you need to change your client every expansion. But you have static content like vanilla. How is gonna work? My mind can’t handle sorry :)
---
Did I understand correctly: You got 2 epics, one of them being a sword and you gave that sword to a shaman who can't wield swords?
---
Most people can’t though let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Sure you can do it in all greens, a majority of the playerbase (this sub including) would have a serious wipefest in any Mythic dungeon in greens. Especially the harder ones.
---
Ah. See, I did the opposite. I had Blazing Emblem drop for me while leveling in STV, and didn't know what it was good for raiding and worth. Ended up seeing multiple of them later in the AH for a couple hundred gold each.
---
running old raids for transmog/mounts on live, maybe trying some of the new 8.2 stuff when it comes out. but then once Classic launches I’m gonna try to no-life the shit out of it.
---
Bro that Cdew guy is apparently the "best shaman in the world."
---
The dude didn't even purge the mage at the beginning of the duel and continued to not purge frost ward.... while using frost shock...
---
All while calling earth shock wind shear....
---
I was getting extra annoyed seeing the Lonzo Ball of the classic wow world
---
The issue here is that what “we” as players wanted seemed to be clear - Vanilla WoW.  But now it seem that even before the release of it we look ahead. 
---
There are two ways: old expansions or now lvl 60 content. 
---
The problem is with the first that when it is released we will divide people to lvl 60 stayers and be content progresses. Or all will get TBC and next day somebody will ask for Classic server of classic WoW
---
The second one seems to power level characters changing the game with new items. And we will have different problem of power creep. 
---
Very hard dilemma.
---
To be honest I never played a caster, just hunter main and prof war alt. I’m lot going by what a mate said for wands, I didn’t realise that it caused a GCD. Going caster this time as I’ve had that experience as a hunter so want something different so gonna go lock. You are right MM (which I usually used) and survival is better but like anything in wow things are doable. Don’t you remember the feral Druid tank that MT onyixia? Yea was only onyixia but he main ranked it and it was a revelation to what right gear and set ups can do.  I know hunters and they were capable of doing much more than you think if you didn’t clip their damage
---
It's for the mitigation. 10% slower attacks, plus helps keeps aggro. Besides stance dancing keeps long runs interesting.
---
They don't have to be vertical tiered raids. You could add a Naxx-level 20 man. You could add another 40 man raid at the MC level with supplemental gear. Gearing up a raid took a ton of time because the vast number of people competing for VERY few drops per raid boss. Later raids upped the loot-per-player number so you could gear faster. Adding another raid to the lower tiers gives you an extra opportunity at loot for that tier.
---
/r/classicwowplus
---
I worry the drop rates of items like this will be inflated on Classic
---
???
---
Read OP again. His question was about a priest-warlock matchup against a warrior-paladin duo
---
Indeed
---
Yep, it’s stuff like that which the classic PvP pros get down easily.  All the retards in Reddit lick their arse though cause they are NPC morons that can’t think for themselves
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
who cares, just block someone if you dont like them. why are you so spiteful
---
honestly ive went back to LOTRO until then, figure play it casually until early august, then relax for a couple weeks to get as much energy as i could to powerrdrive when launch happens.
---
Having a bank alt day 1 is autistic.

This is said like once a day bud
---
Your 5 year old brother isn't killing LK on his own merits, he is being carried, just like he would be if a heroic guild took him to heroic LK. A raid full of people with his abilities could have no greater chance killing LK lfr than jaina mythic.
---
Go to a different city
---
Thats what im talking about! False accusations from the op.
---
Nope, this question gets posted 5 times a day (btw you are number 3 today congratz). And the people in here are getting sick of these kind of posts. I just had a discussion with a fellow redditor (shoutout to  /u/[k1rage](https://www.reddit.com/user/k1rage)) that we (the neckbeards of this sub) don't want to hear any plans now what happesn to classic after naxx. Since it's not even released yet. We have no clue how successful it will be. Also a lot (I mean A LOT) of people who played vanilla seem to think that wrath was the beginning of an end in many points.
---
Blackrock! Anyone remember what the infamous guild with all the ninja looters was called? The leader had a 3 letter name, he was famous across severs. 
---
I also remember going onto the argent dawn server whenever blackrock was down and we would just fuck with people, it was amazing. ‘Trolling’ back before that was a thing.
---
There isn't a single arcane using elf that became druidic elves. It was the elves that couldn't use the arcane that banished the ones that could.

Night Elves have zero claim to "we're the original mages". They don't have a single drop of mage blood in them.

A "bleeding edge" monitor stand. Jesus Christ. It goes up and down, rotates 90, swivels. It's literally no different than the stand attached to any high end monitor. And it's supporting a 16lb screen, we're not talking about the Pinnacle of engineering here.
---
Illidan - the Serenity Now funeral raid
---
They are grinding dungeons because everyone on the server is the same level and completing for quest mobs would be insanely difficult.
---
Night's
---
Should indicate the large amount of support the concept has.
---
Not sure why that's seen as some kind of negative considering groundswell support is how we got Vanilla.
---
Hey all :) I actually never played classic, played late TBC, as shadow priest. When wotlk came, I switched to DeathKnight, and stayed there till now (except Pandaria which I was active only on ToT and played enha shammy). I had many alts of course different classes but really can't decide what to pick. I'm between rogue/enha for melee, mage/spriest/hunter for ranged. (never been a good healer or tank xD )
---
Private server bosses hit harder and use their abilities far too often. They also have too much hp and armor.
---
I had 2 main servers, Boulderfist and Blackrock. Blackrock was the ‘aussie’ server and had a huge population. Boulderfist was home to ‘shamans r teh overpower’ who are considered the best pvp guild in vanilla and the reason I am very, very much for cross server BGs.
---
Yes, but DM isn't coming with the launch for obvious reasons so you'll have to find a different grind spot until then :D
---
You should main Boomkin, it’ll be great then! Lol
---
Same as in 2005. They're going for authenticity and listening to the community when it comes to #nochanges
---
Only thing this guy "influences" is a shit ton of misinformation lately.
---
The guy is clearly very sensitive and Insecure , he's writing a book for every response to try and prove his point.
---
Read his comment in this thread, he said a lot of people are getting a lot of epics......
---
I really like orc female rogue look. Feels right to me.
---
Anyway, I think WotF is overrated on rogues. Warlocks are one of the easiest classes for a rogue to kill. You can kick, gouge, blind, and vanish their attempts at fear casts.
---
It's no dilemna. The answer is you do neither. No new content. No expansions. Vanilla is vanilla. Perpetually.
---
Lothar - US
---
Suprememan - Alliance R14 and his harem of healers in BGs.

Thunderstomp - Horde R14 rolling premades all night in WSG
---
Ming - Undead Rogue, was pretty much all but confirmed to be a Chinese gold farmer. Was never in a guild, and was always found out in the wild grinding mobs while flagged for PvP. Was a really skilled player despite the farmer status and even made some friends horde side and attended a few guild runs into MC/BWL.
---
&lt;M I G H T&gt; Alliance Guild - Was number one guild on server for the longest time.
---
&lt;RUIN&gt; Horde Guild - Was made after a few top Horde guilds split and reformed. Became a top raiding guild on server and eventually became &lt;Tyranny&gt;
---
I'm sure there are more but, if you were on Lothar during Vanilla/TBC, you knew those names.
---
Draka.
---
  We had a server wide famous ninja looter. Stormwind got Kazzak-ed by the roaming Kazzak type boss they added after the famous Kazzak incident. Can't remember the bosses name. Also, my guild ran a level 1 tauren raid on Northshire Abbey as celebration for killing Nef. That started a big horde-alliance rivalry for who could pull off the best level 1 raid.
---
In sad that I ruined your day :(
---
But on the other hand shamans are extremely feared since they have purge and can basically kite any melee using frost shock. And if you take the time to master totem dancing you are basically golden!
---
I remember hearing that it was possible in vanilla, but I was sure they fixed it so she was immortal before she ressed mograin. The only reason I think it worked in this instance is that she dies just as she completes the Res of mograin. I honestly think it's another spell batching incident.

How does that solve the tourism issue exactly?
---
Looks like we found the account owner xD
---
While I agree that difficulty modes take away that fuck yeah moment, because you usally do it on "easy mode", and once you've beaten hardmode / heroic / mythic, it still feels great but you essentially beaten the boss allready. On the other hand, classic is undertuned dungeon-wise, so I wouldn't mind tougher 5 / 10 mans. And raid wise, only AQ and naxx will provide some form of challenge, which is kinda sad as it will take a while til we reach that phase.
---
Not including raiding and some PvP, I want to obtain every hunter pet spell rank and all the rare pets I can find.
---
One of the appeals of vanilla is that if someone has cleared [raid] then they have cleared [raid]. I.e. if someone has Death's Sting then holy shit they were in a raid that killed C'thun!
---
Painfully accurate, especially as a hunter back then who definitely snuck off to the bathroom during fights.
---
Making fun of some one liking pornography? Are you 10?
---
&gt;Good thing reddit lets you upvote and downvote content.
---
until the twitch zerglings show up. anything critical that is an actual issue is downvoted, like streamers telling their group and audience to not report bugs, or streamers giving out bad advise like "goblin paladins on horde are OP." while their "world 1st" bullshit gets pressed to the top.
---
On August 12/13 you can login to your account and create up to 3 characters. That’s the only news we have so far. They may release server list before then, but you’ll definitely know by Aug 13
---
The game is so much for fun when you just press buttons. Just force yourself
---
Work
---
Confirmed: 2 weeks prior to launch you can log in (if you have the game time) and create 5 characters on the all the servers (not 5 for every server 5 in total) to reserve your name.
---
Speculation: Many people speculate that about 2-3 weeks prior to this there will be a list with just the server names released. 
---
Since you need a server to create a character, the list will be at least 2 weeks prior to launch released
---
What about Lupus/Lupos? Do we know if it'll be "fixed" right off the bat or in a patch later on?
---
For those who don't know, this wolf pet was the strongest in the game for a long time since he dealt shadow damage instead of physical, so it went right through any armor in both pvp and pve.
---
Wpvp and gathering professions allow any spec to at least compete for gold.
---
Please no wotlk. If they release TBC I want them to change flying mounts and gear (so t3 isnt outdated at 61). Other than that Im good with it.
---
I don't recall them being that strong in TBC. I do recall it in WOTLK though. TBC I remember Druids being ridiculous, but mostly due to Cyclone. That was just arena bs, so meh. It's hard to remember hybrids in Raids in TBC and how effective they were or weren't. 
---
I mean you're right, obviously if it's to the extent you're describing it offsets the balance/design of where hybrids should generally stand. In Vanilla I recall Druids being pretty damn strong. Ret Paladins. Didn't see or fight a lot of Shaman so I'm not sure. I was also a Hunter main back in the day too, so that could easily alter my perspective.
---
Are there any articles or videos in specific you recommend I check out?

i know there were a few routes where the Gryphoon touches the water with his claws! Majestic!!

No you did not.

You can't add new content to Classic WoW. The fact that heroics, **one of the objectively best and most obvious additions to gameplay**, elicited this response... you can't deal with these people.

---
#1.13 is destined to be a mistake.
---
Yeah, that would be the drawback of it.
---
Yeah all these polls are being skewed by the websites they are done on. Doing it on reddit seems to always have certain results like having warlock higher than mages and rogues. When a specific class streamer does some of these for their community suddenly their class is far higher. I think one of the better representations of statistics is the private server census things, but I think even that is wrong because it is harder to reach by very casual players, which often have a certain kind of preference. My guess on the real values would be warrior, rogue, mage on top followed by the faction specific class and hunter, with warlock and priest to follow and probably druid at the last spot.
---
Yeah I actually loved Cata to WoD - literally enjoyed WoD too. All for different reasons though: i was hardcore until MoP but the scenery kept me around, and in WoD I was a full-blown Goblin with 11 capped characters on the same realm whoring gold - so Garrisons and Professions made me enough gold I had a recurring sub til BFA warfronts without even playing the game. 
---
I wont be paying for Classic either and potentially will have a second account just to whore the AH full-time on a second screen.
---
Cata and WoD had amazing dungeons and raids imo.
---
ive read the rest of your threads and im not sure you understand
---
The players in the beta, had a max level of 30, they have all had a lot of time to get the BiS for that level, warriors getting a lvl 40 axe, people maxed out professions such as engineering which have a huge impact with iron grenades and other perks.
---
Dungeon grinding is not the fastest way to level, this was only possible because there was a pause at lvl 30, i time where people like warriors could essentially skip ahead to a lvl 40 weapon, the best lvl 40 weapon. And when SM is most relevent. 
---
This wont happen after 40 because there isnt a nice string of dungeons really to run. SM is 3 dungeons and it has a lot of neatly packed mobs.
---
at level 40 you have ulduman, a more annoying and longer dungeon. Maybe people could grind RFD?
---
But level 30-40 has the most possible dungeon, SM being one of the more exp per hour of all the vanilla dungeons.
---
also you forget all the people who arent streaming and probably went to questing.
---
It's really not, just start with one or two at a time till you get used to it. Even if it's a couple of abilities you'll still see a big improvement
---
Azgalor, home of the reckoning bomb that got the ability nerfed within 24 hours.
---
It's just the beta, calm down.
---
Thanks for the video I guess I was misinformed, doesn't mean you have to downvote me though.
---
Then the question becomes do you do a reset? Or release fresh servers?
---
If Classic+ was something different than these currently releasing classic servers whatever. These are meant to be as close a recreation as possible, nothing more nothing less. 
---
Also, I dount the devs will go the route of OSRS. They've already said in interviews they'd be open to TBC servers etc in the future. Which means that's the easiest cost effective way to do new content. Blizz is a company and that's the most likely path they'd take then
---
What if the answer is you have perpetual vanilla and then BC servers launching separately from that?
---
It has loot which can last you until 60 though so for warrior and hunter it’s essential
---
I think if Blizz wants to treat Classic as a new timeline where the draenei never landed on Azeroth and the black portal didn't reopen after Naxx they could just slowly add content patches for a while after Naxx of small areas. Like open up a classic style level 60 version of Silvermoon that's a neutral city being threatened by the Amani (or rebels against Kael'thas call for the Alliance and the Amani call for the Horde with a raid on Silvermoon or something), or let us go to classic versions of Kezan, Kul'Tiras, or Zandalar. No flying, no new levels, just some new content with the old art style
---
I'd wager more like 10+ times
---
I let my sub lapse. I'm taking a break until probably September 3. I'll be on vacation starting the day after release. 
---
I'm gonna play other games. Maybe try to beat some in my backlog, or continue to get pounded in MTG Arena.
---
Are you serious? Do you actually know anything about Vanilla?
---
In PvE you were pressing one button.

Ok, thank you :).

T3 doesn't get replaced until heroics and raids.
---
One does not just "skip" SM.

&gt; and a base knowledge of 2000 words of the English language?

You realize the english language originates from Europe, right?
---
Cool, thank you :).

If you pussy out on a PVE server you remove a huge part of the "world" of warcraft.
---
Racerx was always a treat to be around. He was always able to make you feel better about yourself. I wish I still had the Racerx soundboard downloaded because it was some funny shit. He was in one of my guilds during cataclysm(?) I think and we would fuck with him constantly cause he was so easy to get started.
---
Oh wow first time I'm seeing a Aggramar player since vanilla! I hated our server and that I rolled on a Pve server.
---
They both portray a sense of longing/sadness I’d say
---
Thunderfury is the best weapon in the game, so good tanks used it till TBC raiding
---
I want to see the classes eventually migrate into their TBC designs. That was the pinnacle of class design from the Vanilla Dev team and made so many specs really enjoyable to play, while still having a ton of flavor.
---
Yes, devs have confirmed that dynamic respawn was in the game in vanilla.
---
Ah Illidan. So many fond memories. The server I decided to pick when I had zero knowledge of the game because it sounded cool.... as Alliance. Stranglethorn and Tanaris were constant war zones.
---
If I dislike it but I still HAVE to run it for BiS gear it would turn me off a dungeon even more.
---
Back in Legion, before they nerfed M+, my social skills from Vanilla got me into ab M +17 group, even tho my Prot Warrior had only +13 as highest done, and the gear was not exactly top notch.
---
I got in, and we finished that +17 with 2 minutes to spare...and we only had to talk ONCE, before starting the dungeon.
---
That moment was the moment I realized that raiding was completely useless for gearing, and except VERY high M+ (like +20 and over), the entire game was a joke. Certain dungeons were a joke even at +20.
---
By the end of Legion, I was the best geared player in my guild...doing M+15 and above only. No raiding whatsoever.
---
I would say that 90% of Retail WoW, in legion at least, was A COMPLETE JOKE, with close to ZERO need for communication between players.
---
BfA is probably worse.

Basically reserving those items, that way you can make gold off of these runs. Probably easier than trying to farm in tank gear.

Bleeding Hollow - we had Cauchy the lvl 30 twink orc rogue who would gank in STV.
---
&gt;What if they need radical changes for next expansion? Is classic gonna limit them some of the subject?
---
It's additional cost of maintaining old content. If like they change a file format they have to change it for old stuff in retail as well as in Classic.
---
&gt;Why we are installing 60gb on every new expansion beta/ptr etc if wow actually have framework-like base client like this?
---
Classic is few GB, retail is that large because it has all the content from every expansion. Like you still have PvP resilience gear and pots in the game and it "has to work".
---
&gt;But you have static content like vanilla.
---
Content may be static but the servers aren't. MMORPG high costs come from devops and infrastructure. The less additional work Classic will require the more cost efficient it will be. Like they said after BfA launch that at some point the AH backed will get a rewrite as it doesn't scale and the performance at the launch of BfA was attrocious - when they get the new backed it will go to every version to a) not have to keep both implementations running which would cost more b) make Classic AH also perform well.
---
Even the 1.12 old client can be used to run the game but what is killing it is the modern hardware. It's not very stable and especially with Nvidia GPUs the amout of glitches is annoying. Latest Nvidia drivers update caused weird glitches in retail and if it would require changes in the game for some reason - it's better to have one engine to patch rather than current engine and the "not so current" for Classic.
---
Curious which classes and specs feel they got screwed over by their 2.0 rework.
---
There'll be one disguised as holy. ;)
---
You’re right about mages, their AoE damage won’t change by getting more gear. 
---
Their ability to sustain mana definitely will, though, and arcane explosion spam is mana intensive. 
---
I suppose dungeon runs aren’t as bad as people make them out to be - I long suspected this anyway - but I feel 100% confident the fastest levellers will be those who can minmax their outdoor levelling.
---
SO the Apple store?
---
Not just the neckbeards, even us dudes with jobs are sick of these posts.
---
Yeah, Mining is fine while leveling, it isn’t worth it for me because I want to level as fast as possible.
---
Emeriss-EU. It wasn't my first server, but was the one I settled on with friends and actually got a character over level 20 on back in vanilla. Athene was pretty big on the server late vanilla before moving over to Stormscale (I think) back in TBC.
---
skill cap is not 8, theres debates on if the softcap is 308 or 315. but there is no hard cap

omg, please stop

Bc is cheaper. Blizzard is cheap. You aint getting new content lol
---
&gt;  Something that doesn't exist in WoW.
---
Wrong.
---
Rules do exist in MMOs. Example: Inflate currency income and your ingame economy breals down. Allow power creep and your progression is kaputt. Allow too much convenience and social play breaks down.
---
Thsse are some of the "physics of MMO" if you want. They are true, regardless what game you design.
---
And now we come to community design decisions. The community doesn't design with these "physics" in mind. They will vote for whatever they think will benefit themselves, at that moment, the most. They will also vote according to whatever their favorite ~~streamer~~~ cult leader thinks is best (at that moment).
---
In short, they won't make informed decisions, they will go by emotions, herd-movement and gut feeling.
---
And that is a surefire way to crash the plane.
---
&gt; $30,000 monitors that also don’t include stands. 
---
Yes because reference monitors only have 4 TB hookups ٩(\^ᴗ\^)۶
---
Haha this is on point. Truest shit ever!
---
Looks like that spirit build is pretty debated with fair arguments for and against, I'm not a warlock expert by any means but I'll stand by what I said, spirit is still trash for warlocks.
---
Did you understand correctly: I got a shaman, 2 of them being an epic and you sword that wield to a swords who cant shaman swords?
---
I feel like you're more interested in name calling that having a productive discussion so this will probably be my last reply.
---
&gt; The same people who designed Cata through BFA would be in charge of designing 1.13. It is certainly not a given that this will end well.
---
Cata through BFA were designed with the intention of changes and new mechanics to bring in new players to the game.
---
Post-Naxx development would be designed while maintaining the design philosophies of vanilla WoW. They would be designed for completely different reasons, for completely different gamers.
---
You're comparing apples to oranges. That's the bad faith argument that I've been referring to. You know that developing vanilla WoW is nothing like developing Cata or WoD, so why make the comparison?
---
&gt;Most people disagree with you and see TBC as the superior game even to classic. You are in the minority
---
I'm not sure how you can claim this since I don't think there's any statistics on this, especially not on this subreddit where people constantly praise elements of vanilla WoW that were destroyed by TBC. 
---
&gt;You are making an argument you know is not true.
---
You can't just claim that the things I'm saying are factually insufficient without proving those things to be untrue, which you haven't. I've presented a mix of facts and opinions, but I've never claimed anything to be true that I know to be otherwise.
---
Again, I feel like you're just trying to take my argument and use it against me, but you don't bring any sort of explanation as to how that makes logical sense. I explained this once again in the first point, and I've explained it throughout this thread.
---
&gt;You are making a bad faith argument and projecting it to them in an attempt to incorrectly invalidate their concerns for the sake of making your argument stronger. It's a sad attempt. Stop it. Either address their concerns head on
---
I find it ironic that you keep making these claims about me, yet at the same time avoid explaining any of these claims when I question them. But once again, I'm not doing any of these things.
---
&gt;You know people who are advocating for TBC have legitimate concerns about devs designing 1.13. You know they aren't making the concerns up.
---
I'm not quite claiming that, but I think a lot of those concerns don't make any logical sense. Again, I've explained why several times. You're kind of just saying the same thing over and over and ignoring my counterarguments.
---
&gt;In your opinion. You are the minority. Most people have a very favorable view of TBC and some even view it as the superior game.
---
People view BFA to be the superior game too. But it's a fact that TBC introduced a slew of features that people who prefer *Classic* consider as having tarnished the game and began the downward slide to LFD, LFR, lack of meaningful accomplishments, and dozens of other things that people complain about modern WoW today.
---
lmfao
---
Congratulations, you're the 5th guy today to bring this topic up.
---
Yeah meant mana spring.
---
I'm 29, and this is deep.
---
Exactly this. Female dworf rogue. 🥴
---
Rogues will still be extremely popular. And for good reason, it’s a fun class!
---
Just laughed my ass off. Thanks a lot. 😂😂
---
And TBC was the same Vanilla dev team, so those talent trees and abilities are legitimately what the proper vision for the game was after 1.12, from all the same folks.
---
Yeah! Finish class quest, finish unfinished zones, level 60 classic-style Karazhan, Hyjal, Grim Batol,...
---
The dream.
---
Same. Also home of Deus Vox who got a few world firsts if I remember correctly.
---
This is very true. The 60 lvl demographics could be way different
---
no u
---
So people aren’t allowed to have a discussion? Riiiight.
---
I really liked the concept of heroics.  Throughout the leveling process you got to see these dungeons, and now you have a lot of endgame dungeons to run instead of just a few.  The gear was meaningful, the quests were interesting.  Some of them were decently difficult so it wasn't such a cake walk.
---
However, there was a lot wrong with that design.  Nonlinear dungeons were special in Vanilla.  BRD will always be one of my favorite dungeons, even Maraudon was fun with its multiple approach.  TBC got rid of that in favor for instances on wheels.  Looking back that was a bad decision.  There should have been a mixture of nonlinear open and expansive dungeons, and shorter heroic dungeons.  Had the developers cut the amount of leveling dungeons in half and made more endgame dungeons only it would have improved the experience.  Also there was the bade system, which I very much dislike.
---
All in all, it was fun to run heroics in TBC.  Even when I was raiding Hyjal and BT I still ran heroics with friends that needed them.  Despite this, I strong believe the game would have benefited from no badge gear and more BRD style dungeons in TBC.
---
I have both, but it takes no time to sort by new, downvote the trash and leave rude comments.
---
Ppl forget that LFD was originally supposed to be a solution to **low level** dungeons.
---
By mid to late WotLK subs had stalled around 10mil, but at lower levels especially for classic content it was virtually impossible to find enough people to run a dungeon on even medium pop realms. You could do a /who and you’d be the only person in the zone.
---
On low pop realms I never had s problem getting a dungeon for WotLK content.
---
I think that’s where LFD was an issue, it was a good, albeit imperfect, solution for low level players to get dungeons in vacant content but at current content it just allowed players to bypass so much and then it was amplified by the badges giving almost a full set endgame set of endgame raid gear.
---
A proper lfg system and more aggressive server mergers may have been a better choice though.
---
I honestly feel like we will have a much more balanced population class wise compared to vanilla.
---
Looking for a casual guild (read: raiding to start after the 2019 holiday season and 1 or maybe 2 nights per week) with hours that are MST friendly (start times between 7:30-8:30 MT). Alliance preferred. Fridays preferred. Non-PVP preferred (unless RP-PVP is confirmed). If this describes your guild or you are interested in starting one that fits this description, please message me.
---
The actual client Patch is called “1.13” but it is based on 1.12’s data. I imagine Blizzard will have an official 1.13 Patch Notes on release, explaining Phases, etc.
---
Laughing Skull - Leeroy Jenkins.
---
We perceive it to be higher because the entire population is locked to a level bracket. At no other time will these mobs be farmed this much. On private servers you would see tons of rare boe items in the auction house from different level ranges on a fresh launch.
---

Well to be fair, PvP and PvE are different scenarios. In PvP, it makes more sense that hybrids would do well or on par with pures as their sustain would help them survive suboptimal pures. They might struggle with a well played pure but should theoretically have a chance at beating them if they played well too. PvE is where they should struggle just in terms of output. Their PvE contribution should come in the form of supportive abilities. From what I've read, vanilla was like this for the most part. I'm not at a computer right now but I wouldn't mind linking something when I get the time. I dont hate the idea of hybrids being on the same level as pures but I think it makes class selection more arbitrary. I think it's better, all things considered, when a class has a specific thing or things it excels at where the others do not.

I grinded from 40-60 on my warrior back in vanilla. Put some metal on Pandora and plug away at satyrs. It was awesome. Leveling was sooo fun back in the day. Every pull was a puzzle that you could screw up. Every pull you’re checking to make sure you’re not about to get ganked. Every pull you’re trying to kill the next mob faster than the last.
---
ya'll are right, i'll probably run SM too :)
---
We use loot council to reward the most dedicated members(have consumables,world buffs,pre raid bis, etc) which is something DKP doesnt do simple as that.
---
There actually isn't.  It will go the way of the Apple Edition^tm
---
There's like 20 posts a day about this. None of them are going to have an impact on the eventual outcome
---
You can NEVER have too many shamans but you will always have too many hunters.
---
Layering solves two issues. Overpopulation at launch and server stability long after long (dying servers and lopsided factions). The second one is the biggest issue the most important to address.
---
Dynamic respawn only addresses the first issue.
---
There is no "solution" to layering. *Layering is the solution*. The problem is keeping servers healthy long after the hype dies down and the wheat is separated from the chaff (as they say).
---
Probably gonna end up side leveling a rogue when my friends aren't on, honestly.
---
Then I can raid resto, PvP as Ele or Enh, and use my rogue for end game
---
Rose gold*
---
What about the ingame "friend" systemn. Wasn't it possible to add a note to each friend?
---
Imp SW:P, Shadow Focus, Silence, and Shadow Weaving are all great buffs for leveling.
---
And then once you hit 40 you get Darkness and Shadowform. Huge buffs.

RemindMe! 11 Weeks

Yep, and no-one's written a guide for dungeon grinding in Classic yet. I'd be impressed if you can find me a 2004-6 guide that compares questing XP rates to bringing 4 mages and a priest to SM Arm to clear it in like 7 minutes.
---
But they have 30 BIS gear! Yep, they do. But even if you double that time to account for worse gear, is there legit evidence for someone trying it in 2004-6? Do we have that data crunched? The fact is people know more about the game now that they did back then, everyone is better at it, and privates are completely unreliable. Which means that **nobody knows** that dungeon farming isn't going to be more efficient than questing at some point during 1-60. Not you, not me. I'm just not claiming that I do.

Damn. Makes me excited even thinking about it. I need help.
---
I was a dot spec warlock in vanilla and was always fine. Of course volunteering for elements or shadows duty probably made them like me more.
---
I play pvp servers. 
---
I guess the mentality is a bit more cutthroat. 
---
If you’re killing an npc near a node I’m definitely taking the node, whether you’re alliance or horde.
---
Going enhance is tempting but i'm 100% going to be the support in my friends circle. Bag space being limited when levelling I don't want to have to carry 2 sets of gear around. Also forget what I said about fishing for clearcasting procs with melee swings it dosent work that way.. i'm just retarded..
---
SHUT
---
Have you seen retail?
---
Yeah. I came back for legion, then I subbed two months into BFA with only about 20 hours played. Legion was a step in the right direction, then BFA doubled down on all the bad parts. Idk how their take away from that was to up the RNG.
---
As the guy below me (immoral) said, celebrity culture has always been toxic.  It's just that Twitch has more or less made it more apparent.  The funny thing is, streamers aren't celebrities.  Many celebrities are very good actors, or public images, but others are just..stupid dumb inbred idiots who did nothing really to get to where they are (\*cough\* kim kardashian \*cough\*).  Then again, some streamers also fall into that category.  They aren't genuinely skilled at something.  MANY streamers are fairly mediocre at what they do, and the streamer culture has cultivated this act of over-exaggerated reactions, interactions, and playing to the point that I imagine older generations of gamers are turned off by it.  
---
I don't necessarily blame the streamers, it's the same reason "rise of the clickbait" youtube videos took over Youtube.  But it doesn't mean it's a good trend, nor does it mean it should be the status quo.  
---
I'll be honest here.  Reading the threads, seeing a few of the streams, and the insanity behind the inane complaints, I almost don't even want to play Classic at this point.  
---
I'm not in the beta, but knowing that there will be hordes (no pun intended) of people following streamers around, giving them shit, etc just so they can have their name said "on-stream" is sickening. 
---
Seeing people complain about literally EVERYTHING in the beta, makes me not want to interact with that community.
---
Seeing people bitch about retail and how it got to where it is now, and then turn around in the same breath talk about speed leveling to 60 in classic makes my mind boggle at the idiocy.  As if they can't comprehend that the instant consumption of content is what made classic follow the path to retail.  An old saying comes to mind when I think about this situation in particular "Those who wield the devil's toys, come by degrees to wield his sword".
---
I love classic (and the 2 following expansions BC, WOTLK), but seeing the over-hyped, over-eager, and honestly cringy sound-bytes from streamers (We're home!) \*yuck\*, posts by streamers or streamer fan boys is a huge turn off.
---
&gt;  why is the 1000 dollar stand any different to 10k dollar office chair?
---
Answer: You wouldnt defend the office chair unless it had an apple on it.
---
I was thinking about having an “advanced” section of the Guide to cover topics like this, as well as Macros, Addons, etc. I want to wait until Classic release to be certain on all of these things
---
I feel like you're trying to be tongue-in-cheek right now because you actually don't think there's an Ah in TB. Am I wrong?
---
Because there's totally an AH in TB.
---
Ehh not like the minority of people are doing anything productive on this Reddit.
---
Sure you are but wrong sub /r/classicwowplus
---
You say you don't care about RP, but RP is more than "/e puts on his robe and wizard hat"--I've honestly never really cared for that either.  RP is why we yearn for the "real" AV with its weekend-long slugfests, even though the new AV provides more honor per hour.  RP is why we celebrated the removal of LFG/LFR, even though it means slower loot progression and less consistent gameplay.  RP is the models, textures, spell/ability names, all of it.  It's the *World*.  I suspect you would take issue with any of that being relegated to RP servers.
---
I'll be rolling an Arms Warrior at launch and tanking dungeons to 60 with my group of friends, and depending on the guild I join I may just bring that 31/5/15 spec into raids and offtank/craft Nightfall or I may respec.  Haven't decided yet.  To your point, I know tanking is a demanding role, so I'm also planning to level a Mage to help pay the bills.
---
Dual spec opened the door to the attitude we've seen in Modern WoW, where everyone reallocates their talent points before every boss fight, because being suboptimal is unacceptable (or at least they did when I stopped playing, honestly can't speak for BfA).  At that point, why even have talents?  In Vanilla, players had to accept that they wouldn't be perfect for everything without paying through the nose for it and that that was okay.
---
Oh boy here we go again
---
Oh my jeez. I remember when these came out, I live in the UK and stomped around all local shops looking for it, never had any :( Re-release please so I can finally fulfill my dream of classic WoW drink thanks to Amazon!
---
Haha I refused to group with that guy purely because of his reputation. Was always a pleasure to see his rants though hahah. I forgot about the soundboard if you find it let me know!
---
Maybe Assassination rogue?
---
If I remember correctly, the spec is just under combat until phase 4 rolls out, then it starts to catch up and eventually surpass combat.
---
The rotation is a bit harder to manage than hit hard because you want to keep your poisons, rupture, and slice n dice active, while throwing in Envenom.  It ends up being a judgement call every rotation.
---
Multiple difficulties and sizes of the same raids is part of what turned WoW into shit.
---
actually druid needs less gear than warriors. especially in MC/BWL. they also will generate more threat. only after T2 that warriors definitely pulls ahead.
---
Alliance LOL = BER to a horde
---
Horde LOL = KEK to alliance     
---
    
---
IIRC
---
I already have started playing on pservers despite having similar concerns.
---
On one hand it's really tempting to just play since the inaccuracies don't even bother me at all and the game actually is great fun. But then I think how pointless it is to sink all this time into one or several characters I won't be playing anymore once the game is out.
---
Also the population on the pserver has gotten quite insane since the beta started. /who returns something along the 13k mark. This results in things like you have to make 5-man-groups for doing level 28-quests in darkshire and it still takes a long time since it's a Mob-tapping-competition. Then I had a look at the starting-area and of course it's even worse.
---
Grouping with people to make it a bit easier is nice... but being forced to group as otherwise your chances to even get a mob at all is very slim... ugh.
---
But it's impressive from a technical point of view. 13k players and the server still just works fine. :D
---
I’m mostly looking forward to my guild and friends doing end game preraid gearing and instances. I am excited to do BRD Scholo UBRS. I’ve taken my time to enjoy beta and leveled 3 characters to 30 already. I didn’t think out my 30s cause that didn’t interest me. I’m getting that enjoyment now. I see leveling as a problem solving game, and I enjoy that aspect of it as well. Smart macro plays are just as if not more important than micro plays. Getting ahead offers benefits and rewards unto itself just like any other part of the game.
---
I see no problem with this.
---
Is your company hiring? I am young, motivated and skilled ofc.
---
Just use the search function... (Yes I'm serious reddit has a search function!) and type in 1.13 there are like 1 million posts about this, and we are not joking about this you are the 4th person, just today who posted this. It's getting out of hand that's why it's raining downvotes. People don't want to hear it anymore
---
At the end of the day look at Blizzards goals and endgame and tell me they are going to invest in redesigning Classic WoW when they have a low-effort sure thing for another 5-6 years?
---
When I realized that I stopped worrying about the people asking for change, I hope it doesn’t happen but it’s not very realistic anyway.
---
I remember in Wrath there was an "obligation" to complete at least one dungeon daily to get a few badges, and I didn't like it because the heroics were boring and easy. Was the badge system the same in TBC?
---
addons = free labor
---
blizzard wanted most of the stuff that addons provide, but instead of wasting your time with it you just release the API for the community to do the work for you.
---
not using it doesn't make it "purer", it was always intended.
---
Jeff Kaplan and Kevin Jordan.
---
Bring those 2 and I'm down for everything they come up with.
---
I was an arms warrior. I had recruited a rogue for our guild and he ended up being in like full t2 soon after. He topped the charts and left warriors in the dust.
---
Yeah, I think they've improved on this with Legion + BFA. 
---
I think its only applicable to MoP + WoD, I couldn't tell you where those dungeons are. (I didn't play challenge mode in MoP).
---
&gt;  this is spec-for-spec competitive in that market
---
Except it's not.  Well done Apple fanboi.
---
I like binding shift space for gap closers or movement abilities.
---
Rolled a Warlock horde on the second Beta pvp server
---
&gt; spec-for-spec it’s well-priced
---
Nope.   Meme more.
---
/new is where I live... it's a dark place.
---
But i've read everywhere that combat is by far the best dpsser out of the three, and im kinda competitive haha. Also, arent u forbided to use ruture because of the debuff limit?
---
Whether or not it translated to classic isn't even a point of contention. It's obvious that it won't, as people won't be in full BiS at 30, with full enchants and nades. The design principles that slowly changed over the years and moved the game away from Vanilla are born from people seeking the most convenient option to level up. Stuff like this, is the reason the game is in such a sorry state these days. Catering to the people who want to take the path of least resistance. 
---
On your streamer note. There's an influx of non-streamers joining the groups readily. The outside of SM GY constantly has 20 odd people standing there, many of whom aren't streamers, and thats not counting the countless others inside in the Dungeon at the exact same time.
---
The average WoW raider isn't doing mythic. And if it does, either mythic raiding is AVERAGE, or the players are not average, but above.
---
If the AVERAGE player in BfA is doing mythic raiding, it is not because they are better players...it is because the raiding is EASIER, due to a MULTITUDE of factors like :
---
\-raids are flexible
---
\-ALL CLASSES have a heal
---
\-ALL CLASSES have 1-2 speed movement skills on short CD
---
\-ALL CLASSES have powerful defensive abilities....again, on short CD
---
\-both factions have access to ALL CLASSES
---
In Vanilla, except couple classes, everyone had to run outside shit. Only healers and hybrids had healing. The defensive abilities were on a VERY LONG CD. Horde didn't had Paladins (LoH,blessings) and Alliance didn't had Shamans (totems).
---
If you think that 10 boss abilities in Retail that can be countered by EVERYONE, ALL THE TIME, is what makes the  raiding hard...you clearly don't know what hard is.
---
Vanilla raiders had to use their brains, the Retail players reflexes.
---
I would say that using your brain is HARDER than using your reflexes.
---
Vanilla IS an MMORPG (brain usage), Retail is a single player shooter basically (reflexes usage), with a fake label as being an MMO slapped on its face.
---
Do you realize that tbc will come out in 2 + years ?
---
There’s a flight path directly to all of them and a summoning stone at the entrance and you can be summoned from within the instance if there’s a lock and they don’t have soul shards so it’s free and all they have to do is create a lock closet anyways. I had to physically run to only one mythic dungeon in BFA and that was underrot
---
Linus doesnt know shit about anything about TV and Film crews.
---
Especially greens (-1 level mobs).  Finding it surprisingly enjoyable.
---
No one has seen it since they hit 110
---
Then you a bitch
---
If dynamic spawning was handled correctly then I agree. Put a limit on respawns so it’s not literally every second but maybe 75% faster. It wouldn’t “break immersion” for me because sitting there waiting for a boar to spawn every 2 minutes isn’t more immersive than sitting there waiting for a boar to spawn every 30 seconds.
---
&gt; Do I look like I want to be celibate? /pelvic thrust
---
My company has a turnover rate of like 55-65%.  It's the kind of company where people go to atone for their sins before moving on.  Good for me because it's a 10 minute commute, I get paid a fuck load, and work, quite honestly, maybe two hours a day.  Somehow I've just fallen through the cracks and no one notices.  Too bad I can't play WoW here.
---
Blizzard was obviously "right" in all their decisions. It's their game. There is no objective truth in game design (except bugs and broken code). There is no right or wrong. They are designing a game -- YOU, the player, are choosing whether to play it or not. Where did all this right and wrong BS come from?
---
I do not like LFD and LFR. I have not liked many decisions Blizzard made. I also had a lot of fun in many expansions. I do not plan on spamming dungeons to level come August. I will choose to play Classic for as long as I'm having fun.
---
It's not complicated, folks.
---
Chill, its enough time between release and naxx clear. Maybe more than 1 year, until then they will decide how to continue i guess.
---
Bro are you me? Exact same setup
---
It's probably because there are so few of us that we tend to see more of what's happening, especially with streams and YouTube videos tracking everything. Until they confirm drop rates are up I will just assume it's what I said
---
You’ve gotta be correct. That would be insane RNG if not.
---
Having a 12 button grid on your mouse really has in MMOs.
---
Gotta add the /s at the end bro
---
And for most people buying it, that system would be outdone for roughly $1200.
---
Keybinds are for noobs. I use Guitar Hero guitar and Dance Dance Revolution pad.
---
I wonder how much of an uproar there would have been if a mmorpg had items like this that would let you consume them but would have death and other long term debuffs. Not that death is not also a long term debuff.
---
The problem is that "influencers" are already bashing the thought of new horizontal content added to Classic. If Blizzard has any plans to develop a follow up for Classic WoW it will probably begin months or a year before the last phase is released.
---
If Blizzard thinks the community already agreed on the idea that TBC would be a better follow up, they might start working on that in a couple of months from now and we'll have no opportunity anymore of changing the course on what Classic will lead to.
---
I haven't played WOW since Pandaria. Logged back in and sold some rare items and some plans/patterns that no longer drops in-game like the Blue Dragonscale Breastplate and Deepdive Helmet. Already made enough gold to purchase 2 WOW Tokens and possibly a third one. 
---
Playing WOD and Legion for the first time and trying to work out if I can set up some sort of passive gold income with the Garrison and just keep buying WOW Tokens with gold.
---
I started in TBC so I'm stretching the question and I'm not sure we were known for anything in particular but the server I spent the bulk of my WoW career on was special.
---
I started in February 2008, about a year after TBC launched, I rolled on a server whose name I forget now but it began with an 'M'. I got my warrior to around level 20. This was the time when WoW was expanding at a tremendous and Blizzard was opening new realms monthly. About a month after I started they announced a new set of realms. One of those new realms was going to be special.
---
Cairne opened in March 2008 with a key difference: No transfers were allowed IN for four (IIRC) months. I thought long and hard about abandoning my warrior but in the end I decided to roll a Tauren shaman on Cairne. And I'm glad I did. I got to experience what was probably the closest thing to Vanilla that Blizz has offered since TBC came out. No one had anything, nothing was on the AH. My first green item came from a boss in RFC. We opened the gates to An'Quiraj. It was glorious.
---
he was a fucking pussy ass bitch, didn't have the balls to do something and just look away
---
I didn't realise that was added in wrath, kinda makes me sad. I liked that zepplin, not having a loading screen and flying over the barrens. It was immersive.
---
Can we save these idiotic discussions for 2+ years from now when it’s relevant?  Besides nobody gives two shits what Tips, Asmongold, or especially you think.
---

---
Fair enough lol
---
I like having my PvP separate from my PvE, so it's a lot better for me personally.  I can chill out after work with a relaxing grind for whatever I need, but still have all the fast-paced PvP combat I want in a BG.  And if I change my mind later, I can just run around flagged for PvP.
---
r/classicwowplus
---
I think it's a bit inconvenient to have anything with a cooldown on the right action bars. I mean, you want to be able to look there quick.
---
As long as they work towards the TBC class and spec designs, I'm happy with any content they put out. They absolutely nailed every spec in TBC and made them all super enjoyable and viable to play, and all in such different ways.
---
Iced &lt;Fun and Games&gt;?
---
It's called fashion, look it up
---
in vanilla this only worked if the pet was not on passive.
---
A passive pet completely ignored all attacks and taunts until given the command from it's master.

It was a very easy way to mess with noob hunters, but this didn't work on any experianced hunter.

Alleria baby here too!

Why is reddit obsessed with patting themselves on the back
---
Struggling to win in Dota 2. Feels warcrafty. Hits the spot.
---
Do you realize that this decision is not set in stone and they need development time to be able to launch it after the last phase, right? So if they intend to do that, they will start working on it as soon as Classic is launched.
---
Cause you can’t just assume that blizzard won’t add any systems. Especially if they go the OSRS route and allow for a community poll on changes or additions to the game.
---
 Do you realize that this decision is not set in stone and they need development time to be able to launch it after the last phase, right? So if they intend to do that, they will start working on it as soon as Classic is launched.
---
PvP isnt live at launch. Just like Vanilla WoW.
---
I seriously hope they just leave at least a few servers even if they are just "my" PvP server alone with Patch 1.12. I have no interest in additional content at this juncture and a good point someone made is why waste resources in anything but bringing the game into TBC? They might as well take their resources and create WoW 2 with some better design philosophies that make classic so great and modern WoW so meh. That would make far more sense.
---
On my own
---
Interrupts and gapcloser like blink always on mouse4 and 5, easiest to reach and best to manage since its on the other hand.
---
You never played Vanilla
---
I’m asking more about if you were still on board with the lore. 
---
The PvE content was fine, but Cata felt like an ADHD fanfic to me, and the eastern themes and Sha stuff of MoP felt super out of place in a western fantasy game about fighting orcs and dragons.
---
&gt;  There's plenty of studios using $35,000-$40,000 monitors. [Substantially cheaper than Flanders ($35K for 4K equiv), Close in price to Atmos NEON 31"]
---
Only a retarded TV studio would replace a flanders with these.
---
I remember one of the Horde guilds put out a pretty good recruitment video because of how badly they were out numbered.
---
I would say 4-5 years, but no longer than that.
---
And it is already clear that this is what will happen, and it will become crystal clear next year, when Classic will have 3 times the BfA numbers.
---
Do you have a source for that with reliable numbers? Or is it just your personal opinion that people excited for TBC or Wrath are fewer than those excited for Classic? Because I must say, I have a different opinion.
---
There is
---
Fake News
---
Just unkeybind Q and E for a few days until you don't miss keyboard turning.
---
Long term goal? Have a lot of fun and meet nice people!
---
Also, some hardcore guilds will "raid around the reset", where basically they clear MC + Ony + BWL Monday before the reset + Tuesday after the reset (T + W for Euros), and then they have 12 days off to respec to PvP.
---
combat still wants to use rupture, bleed damage ignores armor so it ends up being better dps than eviscerate
---
but if you have to limit your debuff slots as combat, you can switch your poisons to instant/instant, where assassination has to use deadly in order to access envenom
---
Sunstrider-EU better known as Lagstrider ... was known for its lag issues :D
---
I want to complete every quest in the game.
---
6's were $600... 
---
iPhones today are $800-1200
---
Okay yeah I was a little fuzzy about Camp Taurajo.
---
Maybe fresh servers. Never a reset.
---
Probably the best way to go I agree
---
They would be stupid for not listening to their community and we know they're doing the opposite of that now.
---
I think in wrath there was some daily dungeon quest.  I fucking hate dailies.  I hated them in TBC, I've hated them in everything.  They inject too much gold into the economy and ruin everything.
---
In TBC badges were looted from bosses only.  There was a patch when they upgraded badge gear and started having them drop in Kara (I think, memory could have failed me).  I don't like catch up gear or mechanics, and this is coming from someone who was involved with guild recruitment and attuning new poached recruits to BT/Hyjal.  I lived through that hell, but even then I prefer that system to a no attunement system.
---
But, the way badges were handled in the beginning (only a few pieces of gear actually mattered, and you could only run the heroics once a day) was a decent use of that system.  It did take away from gear feeling tied to a mob, and thus added that extra flair.
---
Y eah people play Diablo and CS for that kind of time.
---
I played on vashj, during BC it was pretty underpopulated and was frequently referred to as trashj in trade.
---
As for what it was famous for, during BC a pug TK run had ashes of alar drop and the master looter ninjad it to himself and left the raid. He would often be seen flying around shattrath on that mount.
---
Loot needs to be well thought indeed.  
---
Also notice my suggestion is not heroic versions for all the dungeons.
---
&gt; What I was thinking: could heroic versions of **some lower level dungeons** be part of a possible Classic+ future? 
---
It is pretty much impossible to complete Deadmines in a challenging way when level 60, for example.
---
Oh you...nice one.

The community of 2+ years from now is the one to listen to.  Not the idiot streamers and future sheets of today’s community.  The game will be in a very different place in 2 years.
---
If clogging up the meme feed for one thread means somebody can't feel like their opinion has been expressed I'm fine with it lol.
---
It sounds rewarding enough.   I mentioned I've never healed before, always cares about top dps or tanking the raids.  I think I want to be the vital member people only care about when I'm gone.   Healing sounds fun
---
okay you keep saying that its somehow the path of least resistance but its not.
---
Idk your poiint really, beta created a artificial situation. Idk if its proof players take the path of least resistance. Or if streamers took the path of most excitement for the viewers and to team up with other streamers.
---
Any non streamer that joined a streamer group could of simply joined because "omg its a streamer"
---
Let's see: what's your Pyroblast bind!?

Yeah but horde has a boat to booty bay

He could have a dedicated trinket keyboard !

I've tried. I like being able to play one-handed and it's nice if I click some things
---
Personally, I like to bind marking to the NumPad. Way out of the way so you don't accidentally hit stuff. I also put my character sheet on Num+, as an example.
---
You are a sad man.
---
Mental gymnastics is more like assuming your going to get into the beta when they said nobody is guaranteed and then crying about it. 
---
I was already subbed to retail but I just assumed I wouldn’t get in from how the statement was worded
---
There's nothing wrong in taking the path of least resistance. However, the game should offer variety of fairly similar paths.
---
female character doesnt look badass
---
That happened in Vanilla A LOT. And it will happen again in Classic...and the reason is DAMN POWERFUL : next time, it could be you that need the help.
---
Beta, not beta, it doesn't matter.
---
The Classic player is a SOCIAL BEAST (some for the worse, but the vast majority for the better). And this will never go away.
---
As a druid main, this. If you're going to play an underdog spec you should at least acknowledge the drawbacks.
---
Druids can tank some raid stuff, but you usually need to be at that raid level in gear or above it. Off tanking is much more realistic and doable
---
/new is life.
---
Because DX12 is awesome for things like Alterac 40vs40 and open world pvp, it scales so much better than DX11. Alone this is reason enough.

Spoof

I was considering getting herbalist and another gathering profession to start.  What I hadn't decided was to store all my ingredients to lvl another profession, let my items sit before I sell so they're maybe .ore valuable or just sell at beginning for early game gold
---
I don't think you need to worry about this stuff. Blizzard will first wait a few months to a year to see how popular Classic will be before they start development on any new content. They have explicitly stated that they will first gauge the community for what type of content people want, and only after that will they start production.
---
They are listening to their community. That's why we're getting Classic WoW. Now if you classic+ crowd want them to listen to you and make your version come true, you can lobby for it for years and make it so like classic fans had to do.
---
But until you do that, leave Classic alone please.
---
I got almost all the way through "The Insane" and decided I was never, for the rest of my days, going to grind any mobs again.
---
What about the healer? :D
---
There is a weekly post Looking for Group Monday. It is only stickied on Mondays and Tuesdays. You can find a link in the side bar that will take you to the most recent one though.
---
Nah, you’re not going to outdo 4 GPUs and 1.5TB of memory for $1,2000.
---
Classic isn’t even out yet and you guys already want to see stuff added to it? Man... y’all fuckin crazy as hell
---
:D
---
I don't really like the obsolete argument. My train of thought being, "Do you go back to MC when you hit Naxx? Do you go back to BWL if your entire guild is fully geared from AQ and some of Naxx?" I'm sure lots of raids do, because there are mats to grind for legendaries, and other mats/boe's to sell for money. Naxx still has Atiesh, which every caster will want, so that won't make Naxx obsolete because there's another raid above it.
---
Plus, there's other content that was cut from production that weren't raids. Ashbringer story arc in SM, Hyjal, and I'm sure there was content to help flesh out some zones that feel empty. Probably a lot more that I can't think of this early in the morning. I'd love to have more world building content and stories to discover.
---
Fair enough.  From what I've gathered druid is to flex with style and your utilities. Then pally and priest in alliance side is flexing numbers.
---
I'm going to enjoy crafting my UI with weakauras. I prefer making as much of it match the blizzard UI as possible. Its tedious but I like the process. It's a lot like building gummy ships in Kindgom Hearts for me.
---
&gt; ld heroic versions of some lower level dungeons be part of a possible Classic+ future?
---
I think the only rewards could be mounts, toys, and titles. Not sure if that's incentive enough.
---
Hi, /u/Siebolic
---
Yeah, you're kinda crazy. 
---
Anyway, they won't invest in a WoW 2 because the company focus is not the same anymore and that would consume an unthinkable amount of resources and 3+ years of development time at least, as we know it takes for any big sized AAA game nowadays. (being fair most great games takes 5+ years of development nowadays)
---
The "new Blizzard" would probably focus way less resources in a game with a mobile-system focus for a much more reliable return than investing in a new MMORPG, which is a genre that is losing ground year after year in this size of the globe.
---
But Classic+ is what Blizzard should do along with TBC AND keeping regular classic servers up.
---
I don't get where these expectations come from. Keeping up with Retail and three other forms of WoW is just not something Blizzard will do.
---
I keep my Reddit addiction hidden from my gf
---
I’m a bit scared because I saw people posting on twitter about getting SoJ as well, I pray they aren’t doing the retail thing of everyone’s a winner super high drop rates. I’m so afraid of Blizzard.
---
please post in  /r/classicwowplus thanks
---
Classic won't be sustainable if they don't progress the content in some way.
---
Well, everyone hates hunters.  So, there's that.
---
thats great fucking news!
---
It's kinda like that, but not quite the same. The appeal with RFC is that it's the lowest level dungeon in the game. Stockades have several alternatives at the same level.
---
I agree, and would like to add that there are streamers out there that aren't horrible monsters from the land of Reee.
---
One of the odd things about BC is that nobody actually seems to want to play it. 
---
Every BC private server has failed spectacularly. Even tho it's called the "best version of wow" "the golden age of wow". When it comes to voting with their boots, nobody shows up.
---
There's some succesful wrath servers but no really succesful BC servers. It's like people like the idea of BC not actually playing it. Maybe it's just a string of bad private server mistakes but I kinda wonder about that.
---
I can smell the virginity through my computer screen.
---
The sword is Bind on Equip so my guess is neither of them could use it so they rolled on it to see who gets to sell it on the AH
---
I understand min-maxing, but one thing I would always recommend is picking the faction based solely on which one you enjoy more (races, feeling, appearances, etc)
---
That being said, for primarily PvE, humans get a boost to sword skill, and the go to PvE spec for rogues is dual sword spec. It's quite strong, so that would be my recommendation.
---
Do you realize the classic+ crowd is the same crowd that wants Classic, right? lol
---
Same. Get an alignment grid addon for fucks sake!!
---
Whoa. Are you my /cast Mirror Image?
---
Level 1 Argent Dawn Gnome raids.
---
first
---
&gt;  It will be very bottlenecked, and say Teldrassil and Auberdine may be a much better idea than Elewyn and Westfall. 
---
They are using layering to get rid of the bottle necks.
---
Rest XP stops after two levels, I think. It's not strictly time dependant.
---
As a Resto Druid these were the two options you had available to farm the 100g of Potions / Reagants you needed for the raiding that week: 
---
1) Trick your guild into thinking that 0/30/21 was better than 0/20/31 because 20% more INT is more valuable than Innervating the Priest once every 3 mins 
---
2) Pre-farm the 200g you needed (100g for the mats, 100g for the respec cost) and then spec into Feral to go farm
---
* You realize that I am European, right?
---
* What does that have to do with anything I wrote?
---
* There is no point in the US from where Europe is on the other side of the Planet
---
And yes, please do educate me on the fact that a language belonging to the Indo-European language-family originated in Europe. Because, that totally wasn't obvious to anyone.
---
Yeah, damn Warlocks and their extra bag space! /s
---
Just out of curiosity, why do people keybind professions and stuff. I use keybinds for spells and abilities but see no reason to overcomplicate it by binding things that would never need to be used in a hurry.
---
I would argue that blizz is clearly going to do something after the money stops trickling in, it would be foolish to think they would just let the hype over classic die. Starting fresh servers every 3 years would have a dminishing player base over time. The only thing that can keep a healthy player base is new content.
---
I am also not sure why the 1.13 threads get picked apart, there is always a shitty post and repeat question. This is reddit, any sub that doesnt have a policy on low quality post will have a lot of... low quality posts...
---
PvP servers are pretty tolerant of this stuff. 
---
They will generally just get another account/character to kill you if you steal their nodes. 
---
Hence why I love pvp servers. 
---
Make an alliance and horde account and you can kill anyone who pisses you off.
---
I rolled a few different classes on a PServer just to refamiliarize myself with the starting zone and the quests. I've done about 4-5 characters so far, in different zones, different classes.
---
Not sure which I want to stick with yet.
---
Jesus, he got a full bar of xp for that pull, not too shabby.
---
He's a t_d poster. He's just mad at there being le women in his vyda games.
---
I don’t know how you can say that. The vanilla iteration is closer to a group finder system than BC. Join the queue at innkeeper or stone, no option to disable auto join, and you are automatically grouped with others.
---
If you’re going to distinguish with lfg and group finder. Than I would say that BC is the only true lfg system with vanilla possibly being one. Every other version being a full blown group finder.
---
Mages are popular for groups. You get free food, polymorph, and a portal back to the city when you're done.
---
I have no delusions that they will create a "WoW 2". I also don't have any delusions that they will be doing much with WoW classic as well. I would be fairly amazed if they went the TBC route even but that seems more likely to me.
---
I am fully well aware that they will milk retail WoW until that well dries up in profitability.
---
Yeah, I hope Blizzard keeps a slow content release schedule. 
---
People will realize that speed clearing is unnecessary.
---
I'm sure it won't be. It makes sense to buff drop rates in the beta so that people can have a chance to find bugs in rare drops.
---
Blood and thunder. And MasterCard.
---
Well some people do, it's very hard to speak for all people
---
I'm just speaking on what I remember from raiding at the end of Vanilla.  I haven't played hardcore since the release of Cata, so I'm sure a ton has changed.
---
I'd take what the other dude said and go with that.
---
Either one is fine. Just be aware of the "Huntard" slur and it's meaning. You'll have to constantly prove yourself a good Hunter due to so many really bad hunters out there and the \~14 year old reputation that follows. Pet Management is just as important as your rotation/trap placement, etc between dungeons and pvp and open world whatever.
---
Why do we continually ignore 2007 Runescape’s model for post-classic content? I know it’s a different game but Jagex created a polling system to create new content that allows a legacy game to thrive with a strong community and faithful new content.
---
So sm ruin is just dot, then drain life or Searing? That's what someone else recommended
---
Thanks, definitely cleared that up
---
Wotlk is out and then what?
---
Oh, you think you have some idea about how you would do 1.13, friend? Tell me, what does your patch have to offer these groups of players?
---
* Players who want 10-man raid content.
---
* Players who want skill-based PvP rating systems. Also, players who are sick of raid-or-die mentality and want their PvP gear to be among the best gear in the game.
---
* Players who want to make meaningful progression and acquire epic-level gear for 5-man dungeon content in a timely manner based on that challenge of the content. Also, players who want a variety of 5-man.
---
* Players who want their Prot Pally to be able to meet and even exceed Prot Warriors on a per-encounter basis. Players who want other DPS specs to be viable and/or provide unique utility on a per-encounter basis.
---
* Players who want meaningful daily content that progresses towards a goal they care about.
---
These are all things Burning Crusade offers. Can you honestly say you can meet these demands, while simultaneously meeting the demand of Classic players who want raid-or-die, 40-man only, no "welfare" PvP gear, who hate the idea of 5-man giving epic quality loot, who think that "hybrid tax" is a legitimate penalty that should be enforced, who hate dailies, etc? You can't. It's a paradox.
---
You cannot release a version of WoW that appeals perfectly to both the vanilla fanbase and the BC fanbase. BC fans know what they would be missing, you can't tell them that a 1.13 that doesn't deliver on what BC delivered is "good enough". They will rail against your content, boycott you, send all sorts of harassment, etc. All this, and classic fans may not even like the patch. But if you deliver a version of 1.13 that appeals to BC fans... many classic fans will rail against it. Fuck, look on this very sub - people are railing against heroic dungeons in Classic even though it is a feature that almost anyone who isn't staunchly #NoChanges would probably love.
---
#There's no way that 1.13 does what you want it to do and it isn't strictly worse than maintaining separate pristine Classic and pristine Burning Crusade servers. You can't do it. And maintaining four versions of the game - Classic, BC/WOTLK, Retail, and Classic+ sounds like a huge pipe-dream. It isn't happening.
---
Uhh me too

This is a post I made for Patch 1.13 &amp; 1.14

Awesome, I'm so glad this exists.  Thanks!
---
Yeah thats not going to happen with most of the people that play WoW. You got lucky with that group.
---
Remember Staff of Jordan dropping in Uldaman and winning it with a 94 greed roll...sold it for 500g and lived like an absolute king for a few months levelling through the 40’s and 50’s. P.s my names Jordan...it was fate.
---
Absolutely agree, some of my favourite WoW memories are just grinding mobs in hearthglen and tyr's hand and the pvp that ensued due to fighting over respawns.
---
You could go there pretty much any time of day and you were guaranteed some action.
---
Perhaps try Shift-A/D for turning?
---
&gt; given time there will be addons that do just this.
---
You know it won't, as I explained couple posts before. The only thing the "LFR" addon will do is facilitate group forming.
---
&gt; getting into a raid with an automatic interface does not change how the game is played.
---
If by "getting into a raid" you mean being teleported to the instance, then Yes it does change.
---
&gt; the only thing that happens is you replace spamming the chat channels with an addon (or interface) that does the search for you
---
Yes, As I said before, that's the only thing the LFR addon will do. And this is waaaaaaaaaaaay different from what the current (retail) LFR system does.
---
Forget about the economy, purples lose value if you see them a lot. Epic loot is one of the biggest parts of an RPG and having it be more common than “common” items is one of a million things that is killing retail, in retail you can get an epic from doing a daily quest easier than the starter zone in classic.
---
My post is directed mostly to the argument people that is against this idea is already spreading out. I think its fair to try to combat that argument as it's based on a fallacy. 
---
They're trying to shut down an idea based on fear alone, and that's not good because later this can be excluded of a poll of possibilities if people think it's too risky. (which it's not)
---
and you'll need an active subscription to reserve names.
---
Sadly, the things you describe present coordination challenges for many players .
---
That's okay, I rather watch the first matrix over the second.
---
I made a post that suggests some 1.13 &amp; 1.14 content
---
It doesn’t have 4 TB hookups. It has 1 and 3 USB-C.
---
Thanks, mate.
---
The real question you should ask is how many will be resto and have many resto shamans do you need in a raid and how many hunters do you need.
---
The answer to that question is: There will never be enough shamans and always to many hunters.
---
Huh?
---
No? I want classic and would be perfectly fine with nothing being added or tacked on to the end?
---
Or just go to PS ...
---
I'll look into it. :D

Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
---
Damn, somehow  this became even more cringeworthy over the years.
---
If you click all 4 braziers at Kelris at the same time you deserve to be kicked from the group for trolling, no group at that level could handle all of the adds.
---
Eventually, but I don't think so in Classic
---
mythic is the highest raid difficulty, m+ is an infinitely scaling difficulty mode for dungeons
---
Planning on doing pvp or pve mostly?
---
I posted a reply to this just a minute ago, but you do realize that every single mythic has a flight path yards from the entrance and a meeting stone at the entrance that two members of the group can use to summon the entire group for free? Very rarely did I ever run to foot to the dungeon, except for underrot and temple of Seth (usually got summoned).
---
Additionally, mythic + is literally the best non-raid content in retail. However, it gets repetitive, the rewards are too transient and unpredictable, there’s no time to communicate because it’s a timed run, the list of downsides goes on. Some may say it’s the only good PvE content outside of raids. And it’s certainly not for everyone. I actually enjoyed mythic + a lot of the time but I disliked that you couldn’t talk outside of communicating mechanics.
---
Ye I am from Sweden too so perhaps it's not too many keyboards with that symbol on it. It's an easy access to mount up for me.
---
Well, leveling in SM is pretty interesting
---
Ok. I misspoke, and you misunderstood what I said. I meant that the night elves _before_ the WotA. The confusion being in the name “night elf”. Wow.gamepedia still calls that civilization “the night elves” despite the radically different culture from current NE’s.
---
What I really like is how everyone selling 1.13 discusses it as an inevitability with all the insane conviction of the same people who just knew what all of Blizzard's other games would be like.  The same people who were so sure of No Man's Sky's success.  They knew.  They fucking KNOW.  That it will have the Emerald Dream, and Hyjal, and Kara.  It is known!  
---
You're delusional.  Think like a businessman and not like a fan.
---
I love heroics. I think it’s a great way to let more casual players feel a sense of PvE achievement without having to commit to a fixed raiding schedule. By virtue of the fact that it’s 5 man and much easier to get a group going.
---
I don’t see the difficulties others have raised as a reason to not have heroics. Loot issues? Just make it similar to tier 0.5, pre-raid BiS. Dire Maul did this and it’s not a bad system. Don’t do badge gear, which I agree makes early raids pointless. Linear dungeons have nothing to do with heroics and more of how dungeons in general are designed. It’s very possible to have sprawling dungeons that are still heroic content. I don’t think calling them “heroics” are bad, but we don’t even have to call it heroics, if people are offended by an immersion breaking increase in difficulty . It can be implemented in the same way hard-mode Ulduar was done, would be bad ass.
---
To me, more content is better, so long as it doesn’t invalidate earlier content. The LFR stuff in BFA is distasteful because they pose no challenge, and are frankly there only as a catch up mechanism to get into mythics. If we are smart about the way we do loot for heroics, we won’t make the same mistake as retail.
---
&gt; I know you're all tired of these posts but I don't want to reroll my first character.
---
While I hope you won't have to, it is very hard to decide this based on peoples' opinions alone. In the end you will have to play that character to 60 and beyond and see if you really like it. Might be that something in the class design is bugging you and you won't have much of a choice other than reroll. Or suffer through it. But really, gaming should be enjoyed, so I wouldn't recommend going the suffering route.
---
&gt;is there legit evidence for someone trying it in 2004-6?
---
Yes, to me there is.
---
Because I played back then. And neither I, nor the people I played with, were inexperienced at MMOs when we started. And we tried powerleveling alts by dungeon-grinding. And it didn't work.
---
So, now you have 2 choices:
---
* You either believe that what I said is correct, based on Guides written by people who played Vanilla, and the anecdotal evidence of players who tried both ways 14 years ago...
---
* ...or you believe in your opinion, which is based on...your opinion.
---
I don't care what you believe. Have a nice day, this discussion is over.
---
Thanks to Wheel of Time, I love to play my mages and priests as female, warriors and paladins as male (I’m not big into warlocks, but the one I delved into was male, although a female Black Ajah would have worked as well). As I have a bad case of altoholism and especially like fire mages, I play female characters all the time. I am a guy who is secure in his sexuality and doesn’t find WoW toons to be erotically interesting in any way. I simply keep to Aes Sedai and Warders as my own personal theme when playing.
---
Whatever the reason is that trips your trigger, play the toon you want to play, and don’t worry about your friends.
---
Talent trees are more like toppings or ice cream flavours you can choose between, of course you would want more there!
---
&gt; **BURNING CRUSADE IS SURE MONEY AND CAN'T FAIL** 
---
Yes...for 2 years only.
---
I am sorry, but a lot of WoW player have 10+ years under their belly. If you are happy with 2 years of Classic and 2 of TBC, and don;t give a fuck on the longevity of the game, fine. Just don't force it on my throat.
---
I want Classic for 2 years...and than I want a CONTINUATION of Classic for AS LONG as possible. If I want to take a break from the game in 2022, and come back in 2025...I want to come back in CLASSIC, not Mists of Pandaria or Cata, because the MOMENT you go TBC, you have to repeat the same shit all over again.
---
TBC is a sure bet, YES, and this is why there should be AN OPTION for TBC...but in the same time should be a Classic+, because the former will last 2 years, and the later will either go bust, or will be the mother of all MMOs.
---
I do not want TBC only...I want TBC as an option, as long as there is Classic+ available as well.
---
And it will be exactly as I am saying : BOTH options will be available. There is no other way.

I've played plenty of private servers and I stand by what I said

You cannot trust them to suddenly understand why classic is better when they are making change even in the upcoming patch that go further away from it.

I was on the server illidan. I was in the guild Serenity Now, which was the guild that was famous for raiding the funeral in winter spring. I soon left that guild to join Warpath if anyone was from illidan and remembers any of this. But our server was also known for a lot of other drama. We had so.much that we had our own website dedicated to it called Illidrama.
---
&gt; I heard that gearing a hunter is quite easy.
---
Hunters compete for gear with Druids, Red Paladins, Rogues, and Warriors.
---
Mages compete for gear with Warlocks and sometimes, but not often, healers.
---
Don't overthink it man, use this https://justflipacoin.com/
---
I want to make a part 2 where T4 would be karazhan (to make medivh's staff relevant). But the attunment would multiple raids in the caverns of time where you can only use the gear given to you IN the caverns.... so your T3 gear wouldn't be replaced until you got into karazhan.
---
I played Hunter in vanilla and Mage in TBC. A good hunter is rare. Hunters are not. The skill ceiling is quite high for a hunter. You have the potential to be really good, but you need to be great at your class. Mage is easier to play and to put out the big numbers at.
---
But I don't think I'm the only one farming materials.  Idk how valuable these things are which is why Im asking.

I’m an ethnic nationalist, not a supremacist. White genocide is real and the evidence is there.

Enjoy autistically going through people’s history and commenting on old posts.
---
there is barely any gear for bear druid in mc/bwl, everything is from dungeons, that's why they are strong early, so you will always be at that "raid lvl". plus MCP for enhanced threat, which warriors can't use.
---
guess you just didn't mained enough
---
yes, blizzard frequently hwid bans people who fuck around in the games memory, and other semi-serious hacks. Look around on ownedcore sometimes, I dont think they have a reason to lie about 1 out of dozens of their bots getting HWID banned.
---
Those are both keybound to spells

I remember in Vanilla it happened a few times when they discovered it.

I was so much in the tank mindset at the time, I didn't even think wtf is this : just popped def stance taunt and then start sunder the thing.
---
Everybody else started to DPS, it died pretty fast iirc.
---
Pretty much a non event if you ask me. If you really want to get a good chuckle go in the newbie zones.
---
I get you. I guess it's the same way with spell book, honor page and character panel. No need to get there instantly but we still press P, H and C (original binds).
---
The community cannot have an informed opinion as of now.
---
Shaman, have fun.

Once the streamers level up a bit, 95% of players will be too low level to mess with them.

On beta, people are much closer together.
---
I second that notion. All in favor...
---
Its a forum for ideas. I honestly wonder why BC private servers never do good tho. 
---
It seems like wrath and vanilla have good followings. You say something about BC everybody talks about how awesome the party is gonna be. The next day they are all asking each other how it went because nobody showed up.

---
I'm just here for the shit posts and the hardliners losing their minds when a new person unwittingly reposts a question that was asked 3 months ago.
---
No? I don't want any of your, Tips or Asmonshits ideas tackled onto my game. And I am very much a member of the classic-crowd.
---
One of the things that kind of put me off playing a hunter was, that they do have one of the more complex (some say, most complex) PVE rotations, yet don't do a great deal of damage. I feel like that'd demotivate me; knowing that I pulled it off perfectly and I'm still nowhere near even the top 10. TBC spoiled me in that regard, though it was the exact opposite then, because you literally only spammed a single-button macro and were topping the damage meters easily.
---
You can tune the numbers or shut it off after the Zerg leaves. Blizzard isn’t a small dev team for a private server
---
I should try that, hopefully it's not too awkward stretching your left hand over there.
---
* rebind movement to ESDF, just like good old Quake days before some kids started doing WASD. Bind QWRTYAGHZXCVB for easy access.
---
* remap caps lock to some key and bind it too, I like to rebind caps lock to =, who the hell needs caps lock anyways - easy to reach key wasted
---
* you can also bind mousewheel up/down, I always but charge, shadowstep, sprint, blink and other abilities on mousewheel up.
---
* ~ (tilde or w/e key left to 1) is also semi usable, bind it. I use it for /petattack macro mostly
---
* now you wouldn't bind space to a skill, but you can bind shift + space.
---
Novak ninjas tiger mount.

Duo with a prot warrior, both of you should reach the dps of an undergeared rogue \^\^
---
I actually agree with you on this, but I think it's useless to try and argue with these people. You're unlikely to convince them of anything and ultimately their voices don't really matter anyways. Ultimately, the choice is with Blizzard and I trust that they will make the right decision in the end.
---
Well to be honest it is a daunting thing, but if have been playing since BC, then you should have the first part (teaching your brain how to react to situations in an unknown environment, as in knowing which spells to use in the first place) down already. Now comes the second - and arguably the hard - part, teaching your brain to associate the spells with pressing certain keys. A couple of things I picked up on on the way to keybinding, which might make it easier are:  
---
1. Start simple; just bind your core rotation, none of your cooldowns or utility spells. Just do a couple until you've got them down pat and then add a couple more.  
---
2. In a similar vein to the first one: Take it easy, don't rush it, rewiring parts of your brain can take a long time and the end result will be much better, if you can do that at your own pace.  
---
3. Hide your action bars: Can't click on things you can't see. This might also make it easier to remember which keys are which, because you can't check on it whenever you want, meaning you have to know it beforehand:  
---
4. Unbind your movement keys, if you are like most people (including me) you will quickly grow tired of not being able to move and use instant cast spells at the same time.  
---
Especially the latter two might be a bit extrem and for all I know maybe none of these will help you. Keybindings are an incredibly personal thing, from the stuff we have keybound and the keys we use to bind stuff to. It's all about what is more comfortable for you and you should let nobody tell you how to play a game.  
---
With all that in mind, I do implore you to give keybinding a shot, as - at least in my opinion - the game feels much nicer to play with your spells keybound.
---
They are going to make maintaining the Classic client very easy on themselves in that the base will be a single code source that has two forks, one for retail and the other for Classic.  Any data management changes implemented in the future will, in all likelihood, be rolled into Classic as well as retail.  They will adjust the Classic data as necessary to keep up with that.
---
Classic is not a set-it-and-forget-it type deal; the client needs to be maintained.
---
Is there any good method of avoiding servers with popular streamers on them? They really fuck up the population Dynamics. I don't follow any and it seems like personally tracking where all of them decided to go will be difficult for one person
---
I don't want to pick a server, only for two months later I for it to be a ghost town because we had the bad luck for it to be a server a few popular streamers picked at first, and when they got bored they took their fans with them 
---
It's fine for people to like the streamers but their existence has it's downsides for the rest of us. I get that there are good streamers out there and some of their fans are decent folk, but there's also the hordes of immature "lolrandumb" streamers and their legions of 7 second attention span fans. Not saying all the fans are like that, but nowadays they are a problem to contend with.

I figured I'd ask in this thread because the topic is talking about streamers lol.

Wouldn't really be as relevant in classic because you can't see people's specs and people will have multiple gearsets for different things
---
* You want someone who can stealth
---
* You want to be able to tank
---
* You want a natural flagrunner
---
* You prefer melees over casters
---
Seems [Obvious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY2d5CQuTdg) to me.
---
Playing bfa. Having great time strictly playing arenas with friends, fast paced and fun. 
---
Fuck you rmd with fire mages tho.
---
In Vanilla we gave hand of rag to a veteran holy paladin so she'd have a sweet weapon to level to 70 with.
---
Nice
---
Cata was a revamp of the old zones with new stories.. they didn’t further develop any of the current stories. That’s what I meant. Sorry it went over your head.
---
Its not, its people who neec contant new content to say enganged with a game, i dont need, i like my games stale, just like diablo 2 that i still play.
---
Sorry it went over your head. I’ll try to keep it simple next time :)

Burning Legion. Zeksonic Legion. Teh Pact is Seald. Here's an ancient copy pasta guild drama we got because I raided a vent server spamming death metal to a rival guild. 
---
&gt; So,
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; It's obvious that we have a problem.
---
&gt; Here stands two guilds - who represent two completely different sets of rulesets and beliefs. We manage things differently, we operate differently, we speak differently and act differently.
---
&gt; Here's where the problem lies;
---
&gt; Personally, I don't like most of you. In fact, you seem to get the majority of the folks who don't fit the behavior rules of the Black Label Assassins. I suppose it's only natural that the "Destach hate-club" would emerge from the place where all our troubled ex-guildmates have gone. However, the reality is, this isn't a fight we started. This is a fight that's emerged because I represent a guild which attempts to set a moral precedent concerning people who "don't fit in". Basically, we're 99.5% adults, and things like spam, immaturity, and the kind of horseplay you guys find entertaining.. we don't. Vice versa, you guys seem to mistake the way we enjoy our game for roleplaying or something to that effect, from what I gather. Well, because of this difference between us, your folks seem to think it's ok to publically bash us (if not me, specifically), and so being the vengeful prick that I am - I've reciprocated this nonsense on several occasions with some verbal bashing. However, thanks to the social ineptitude and inability to deal with conflict maturely over on the Zeksonic side, this situation has escalated dramatically, with Aleta's orchestration of a cybersex session in our guild chat, Rhythmic's sexual harassment against one of our female members, and just today - a felony attack on our Ventrilo server (for which I've contacted the appropriate law-enforcement agencies).
---
&gt; You guys are entitled to have fun in any way you see fit to, as long as it's not stepping on anyone else's toes. If it weren't for Zeksonic being the most notoriously loud, obnoxious, aggrivating group of folks on the server, BLA and Zeks wouldn't even know who one another were. BLA only suffers problems from those who decide to start problems with us. There are at least a half dozen other guilds on Burning Legion who are riddled with idiots who we refuse to deal with, but they're at least smart enough to talk about us behind closed doors. What's been happening here is there are a few Zeksonic who are completely fed up with my existance because I run an adult/closed community guild, and they're too personally attached to leave well enough alone. I'm pretty sure there's not a day that goes by where the folks we've kicked out of the guild and sent your way don't cry about me. That's ok, though. I couldn't possibly care less about the people outside of my guild. The ones who've been kicked out were kicked out with good reason - usually for reasons of being completely unable to fit in with an adult crowd. Now, these people are creating an "I hate Destach" bandwagon, and using your entire guild as their meatshield. Of course, there's other folks in Zeksonic who don't like me for their own inane reasons, but virtually no one has any personal beef worth noting over me. In fact, most of the people who hate me haven't ever spoken with me or heard me say an ill thing about them personally, they've just gotten caught up in the mindless guild drama and feel personally affected by it. B.L.A., nor I, speak publically against ANY guild in the game unless someone goes out of their way to antagonize us first. The same can't be said for Zeks, you guys START 90% of the smack-talking on Burning Legion in the first place.
---
&gt; The question you have to ask yourselves is; Are you prepared to have your guild disbanded, and any number of your personal accounts banned/suspended, for a few chumps who can't seem to obey the rules? The reality is - we won't put up with this shit. It's nice to dream about pushing the big red button. ..but dreaming about it, and actually pushing it are two different things. It's a big red button for a reason. You guys are pushing buttons that ought not be pushed.
---
&gt; This stops here, or I will ensure that every person involved with Zeksonic Legion is held accountable for the irresponsible actions of the few who orchestrate this crap. You guys have the opportunity to cease this madness by showing a little PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY - in minding your own business. It's really easy. All you have to do is just keep it to yourself and your guildmates concerning the people/organizations you don't like. The rest of us don't want to hear about it, the rest of us don't care. There's an entire server full of people who don't care for Zeksonic because of the way you guys act/operate. If no one else, perhaps the administration of Zeksonic Legion should take that into consideration if they expect to stay in business, because the rest of us aren't having it. You'd be naive to think that your problem is just with the Black Label Assassins.
---
&gt; I have in my hands enough evidence to dispel Zeksonic Legion. A compendium of violations of the game's code of conduct. Screenshots, threads, and now - evidence of criminal activities. I'll give you guys a very, very short frame of time to straighten out your act, and decide if you want to play ball with the rest of us. If the harassment AND the spam/other ToC violations don't cease, you've "sealed your own pact". I personally don't care which route you guys choose. If you continue to harass us, and inconvenience other people, it just makes my job easier in seeing Zeksonic wiped from the face of WoW.
---
&gt; You're welcome to hate me all you like. It's just a display from the people who lack social coping skills. ..but, hey, some people just feel better about themselves when they've got people to hate on. As long as it's not bothering me or my people, you can hate-parade on me like it's going out of style. ..but do excuse me while I say to those people,
---
&gt; Grow up.
---
&gt; P.S. - Personal attacks on me, or my kin, or the resources outside the game which we use to enhance our gaming experience will be met with legal consequences. IP addresses, timestamps and logs tell all. Juvenile or not, we will prosecute to the full extent of the law.
---
As a massive gold sink, sure...but who will actually use it if it's that expensive?
---
You can't implement it and say that it costs 500g. People will INSTANTLY ask for lower prices, because why only rich players should have access? "Aren't we paying the same for the game?"
---
You see, it would be stupid to do in Classic. Once you are implementing it...people will ask for LOWER prices, and in the end, it will be accessible to everyone.
---
So, we will be back at square 1.
---
Not, it shouldn't exists in Classic. Ever.
---
Well I fully agree... on the other hand we have thirsty desperate guys throwing the same amount of money at girls (thots) on twitch...
---
Shaman all the way
---
I agree it seems obvious but I really want to shaman I think 😐
---
Pretty sure the beta is a test run for everyone
---
Ye I have strafe aswell as many other players. Imagine dropping right-click and start turning!
---
I don't have big hands but also never had struggle with reaching 6.
---
Don't like classic? Don't play it. Why do some people find this so hard to understand?
---
says the chinese
---
Progging naxx on a private server. 5/15 atm.
---
They are better right?
---
I dunno, I just went from 323 to 362 on Monday on a fresh 120 alt in one day of world quests.  Granted as a new 120, I had 3 days worth of emissaries up, and two of those were gear, so those initial hits boosted enough that yes, you can get that much in just one day's worth of WQ.
---
I enjoy tanking. I tanked in vanilla (autocorrect tried to change that to ‘I yanked in vanilla’, which has me almost rolling in my cube), I tanked in BC, I tanked in WotLK. Then Blizz tanked Cata but hey, we’re here now on the verge of Classic. Point is, I want to tank and I’m going to tank, I really don’t care what everyone else is doing. You shouldn’t either.
---
I will say that I remember it was common for people to be all about tanking DM and Stocks at lower level, but suddenly it was harder and harder to find tanks, especially good tanks, the higher you went. 60’s dungeon pug groups especially. I really had zero problems finding groups when I wanted one.
---
I can shift 13 times before OOM, not to mention innervate and mana regen over a long fight.  There's also a trinket that makes shifting free for 20 seconds.
---
Frost mage and Hunter are the only fights that I even consider conversation of mana due to excessive shifting.
---
I can straight up shift into travel form 30 times in a row.
---
Where are you drawing your opinions from? Beta streamers?
---
&gt;I remember exactly how it was and I was as good at the game as the current beta players, it "didn't work" for us
---
You're right, there really isn't much to discuss. My "opinion" is a fact, no-one's recalculated this stuff on accurate 1.12 data with 2019 players so no-one knows if the current theory is correct. Looking at how quickly people have gone 30-40 by AOE farming SM, even after 30 BiS gear becomes just okay gear after a few levels, either one of us could be right, I'm just the only one admitting that.
---
 Have a good one.
---
I’d pick druid. Everyone and their dog will be playing shaman.
---
I can get to 40 in half the time /played if I can take 25 IRL days.
---
Another one of these posts huh...
---
Summoning in Classic required:
---
A) a warlock in your group
---
B) the warlock to have a soul shard for each summoned member
---
C) the warlock to be outside of the dungeon
---
D) two other group members to be outside of the dungeon with the warlock
---
Meeting stones didn’t summon. Summoning wasn’t free. Also you didn’t want to be the asshole who expected others to walk their dumbasses to the dungeon while you continued doing whatever you wanted.
---
I personally agree the iPhone XS is excessive.. I wonder if they intended that.
---
At the end of the day I take phone calls and am constantly on my phone. A light estimate of 6 hours a week lands me at 312 hours a year on my phone. 
---
Spending a minimum of 300 hours on my phone a year I don’t see how it is any different from investing in a nice car or bed. Its a daily user!
---
Kel'Thuzad US. I am one of those goons. :)
---
Then we've had like 5 years of steady content released and the ecosystem of gaming is so wildly different it's hard to make calls.
---
But definitely stop at Wotlk, cata classic and onwards isn't gonna play all that well.
---
The rare mob Lo'Grosh in Hillsbrad Foothills drops a 4.0 speed mace ([The Pacifier](http://classicdb.ch/?item=6327)) on a ~50% dropchance with a 2h respawn. It's not as good as Pendulum Of Doom, but still amazing, especially since you can equip it at lvl 32.
---
Man, I can remember to this day on my first character, a priest not yet 60, running through EPL and a random zombie dog attacked me and it dropped a Glowing Brightwood Staff. So much screaming.
---
no, magic is a large part of combat and lore
---
Seems odd to bring up Feral Druids and Ret Paladins (niche/rare classes in PvE Raids) against Hunters and then ignore Shadow Priests and Balance Druids against Mages.
---
So, it is illogical that MMOs die if there is no new content?
---
Try it out! That's why I made this post. If it made you press one spell instead of clicking that's progress!
---
I have half of one, asshole
---
Most of the horde will be shaman.
---
99% of retail don’t do above +10 mythics lol
---
Pick a race you like the most, if you dont enjoy looking at your character for days on end then youll end up falling out of loving the game possibly
---
Get out of my head. ***Get out of my head.***
---
Finish leveling one of every character to 120. Have 64 total levels left across a FK and DH. Once done, busting out my PS3 and replaying Final Fantasy 6 through 9.
---
Hi Guys!
---
After Experiencing Classic with loads of great friends,  we have decided on making a discord community for all those interested in discussing information regarding classic wow. In addition to this  we Will also be remaking a guild for all EU members, only requirement is that you are active, respectful. It is also recommended that you bring a mic and hop on voice everynow and then.
---
The guild will mainly be social oriented and will be doing everything ranging from the leveling experience to dungeons/raids and also plan on making a battleground group for all those who love pvp!
---
If you would like more information feel free to join our discord community on [https://discord.gg/muAXrsg](https://discord.gg/muAXrsg) you can also message me here on reddit for more information
---
Chronicle
---
Yeah I don't think they'd do that any time soon, certainly not within the first year.
---
However I'll say this...I think it could breathe a lot of life into Classic if they were to make the move towards TBC class designs at some point once the first batch of guilds is starting to clear Naxx.
---
And I only say that because anything sooner would poke the beehive, but I'd actually love seeing a move towards TBC designs out of the gate so that we could still experience Classic, but not experience it with a completely stale meta for an entire year+
---
Back in Nov 2004, the classes and itemization was wildly different than it was in 1.12 and things were ever changing. There was no such thing as spell power, the talent trees were way different, and you never re-rolled characters because a new patch for you could always be right around the corner.
---
I think this is a very unhealthy version of Classic considering we all know exactly how the power balance of every spec will end up in the final raid. If they were to shake it up by moving us towards TBC talent trees then I think Classic would be way more fun since we'd all have to discover this new meta together as we go...just like we did back in the day.
---
Most of the t3/naxx items got replaced like in Kara/SSC or so not 61 lol. Legendary staff can last you , well until BT.
---
Ah yes... I mark mid-combat, that would made me struggle with it.
---
I'm looking to buy new headphones for this reason alone. As well as making a list of new podcasts to check out.
---
I hope this is the case but this sub alone is full of examples of the condescending arrogance the classic community is capable of.
---
It's nothing that its known for exactly but Stormreaver EU had some good shit going on. 
---
First Grand Marshal got catfished by a guy claiming to be a girl and it turned out the r14 herself was a himself too. Double catfish fun!
---
I believe there was a Grand Marshal/Scarab Lord who sold his account and the buyer just went on in the same guild as original owner for way too long, it was fucking odd. For outsiders he was called "Fake Scorpion". 
---
Opening of AQ resulted in suspended accounts over death threats and what not.
---
A raiding guild fell apart (or almost) over Bottomless Bag Pattern but was saved by one mans thirst for vag.
---
I like this
---
once u start playing there's no escape
---
Agree 100%.
---
But...you made a grave mistake : forgot about Warriors :D
---
My 12 years old self would like a word with you
---
The sad thing about this drop is its almost wasted, realm will reset in like 3 months...
---
Engineering is overpowered at every level.
---
Honestly I don’t think they will be overpopulated even if they somehow turn out to be the most popular class. The good thing about shamans is that they’re amazing for raids that every group benefits from them.
---
In a dungeon scenario, you'll see more Feral Druids and Ret Paladins than you will Shadow Priests and Balance Druids. And even when you do see them, they're more likely to be healing, which means they shouldn't be rolling on DPS items.
---
Ah all right... Well, try put your mount there if you haven't found a good key, it's a nice QoL.
---
You can actually use a regular keyboard like a Guitar Hero guitar. Just flip it over so your one hand is on the arrow keys for moving and then your other hand is on the number keys and the F keys for easy spamming of abilities.
---
Perfect example of my above comment
---
I don't think you can just remove that feature. Pandora's box has been opened
---
&gt;That gets into a subjective area - I don't recall anybody in 2006 having serious problems that it was an impossible problem to solve, guilds just went out and got some extra tanks. 
---
I was actually there and it was a huge problem. Tanks were already rare, tanks on a level to tank in Naxxramas were only found in other raid guilds at that level. Which means you had to actively "steal" them if you wanted to progress.
---
&gt;The fact that Naxx was a fairly exclusive raid and there was a lot of anticipation for TBC
---
Which is the reason why Naxx didn't got much changes after its release. No one cared about it anymore because it was released way too late.
---
People hate bad hunters (and most of them are bad), but good hunters will actually really stand out and be respected.
---
Never played SAO, you can tell us features you're looking for or what you would describe a good MMO is to you and we can tell if you WoW Classic will be that for you.
---
VISA it’s everywhere you want to be.
---
But was there in Vanilla? I never played horde so I'm not sure either.
---
Amen.
---
No.  We pretty much just hate all hunters.
---
Is it confirmed you don't need BFA and just a sub? I looked and couldn't find anything from blizzard.
---
I tried ESDF but it felt so weird. It's a nice minmax though.
---
Lol everyday i hear each class is gonna be overplayed. Not worried about that
---
That's a lot of hash to lose.
---
Nah, retail is set to be on mobile only in 4-5 years.
---
And there will be new Classic content...and TBC.
---
Gotta be both, only for everyone to see how much TBC will fail compared to new Classic content.
---
Getting some serious Arya Stark vibes right now...
---
IMO Azshara is the most prettiest and atmospheric one. At the days of BC/WotLK I used to just came by and walk around enjoying the visual beauty. Too bad, it got changed in Cata.
---
Swift Zulian Tiger mount.
---
You don’t want to be just another one, you wanna be the one.
---
Haha no its an anime bro :)
---
Well it's fantasy. You will have professions. You have to level each weapon skill. WoW gets it pretty close. IMO even closer than the SAO games (friend of mine played all of them). You cannot marry and you ain't got player housing. Also the fantasy is more american fantasy and less japanese fantasy. There is no official VR Support, but there are mods to make it happen. In WoW classic you are the random traveler in wow Battle for Azeroth you are basically the superhero but still work for Fedex as a post man.
---
If you have never played wow before, try it out. Don't watch many guides, well even unsubb this subreddit. Try to go in the most newbie you can be and you will have a blast. Just be social and ask question ingame when it launches! ;) 
---
Read quests, take your time, pick a class based on it's class fantasy and take your time while leveling. Just try it 15$ is not much, you just need game time, no need to buy any boxed version of wow
---
Specs and prices don’t lie.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/akoomj/reputation_gains_in_vanilla_wow_did_they_diminish/ef8p0hj/
---
Oh, really? Who's "we"?
---
Literally it is. Not a debate.
---
Don’t matter the class I’m the chosen one
---
Im sorry.
---
This was epic.
---
That could definitely be it!
---
This. Outside of modern WoW all the games I play are old ass games. Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and 3. Ultima Online pservers. WoW pservers. Etc.
---
I've been a fan of **Warcraft** since **WC2 releeased**, so don't talk to me about time scales. The only breaks I've taken from the **Warcraft franchise** since then were from WOTLK's Trial of the Crusade through to SoO, and from the Nighthold patch until now. I'm aware of these time scales - I've been with the franchise a long time. 
---
But four years is still "long enough" for Blizzard to shift their weight around. I could be happy with four, maybe six (with WOTLK) years of gameplay from Blizzard. That's long enough for Diablo 4 to come down the pipeline. That's long enough for Blizzard to put out a worthy retail expansion with "pristine" servers (no LFR/LFD, no X-realm, no flying in current expansion, etc). WC3: Reforged will have been out for years at that point (given it releases this year) and we may have Warcraft 4 or at least its release would be impending I imagine. 
---
1.13... what does 1.13 even DO for the franchise? The future is not in the past. I don't know if I agree with "WoW2", but I know that the rebirth of the franchise to a dominant force in the industry is not delivering a raid that 10,000 people play. It's not. That's a drop in the bucket. Gaming is now the biggest form of media in terms of revenue in the world. You don't win that back by releasing a god damn 40-man raid for a 15 year old game for 1% of a fraction of the people even playing WoW. That's not the winning play. That does nothing.
---
Wait there is a zepelin to thunder bluff?
---
Except it is. This is not a debate. 
---
I build my own PCs. I’m just not delusional and jumping on bandwagons without actually considering facts.
---
Jet Li?
---
Really? I think Hunter T2 is one of the ugliest sets in game, along with hunter T1. Mage T2 is possibly the nicest looking in game though. That being said, I'm considering playing a hunter, as a like to be strong independently, and they are the funnest class to DPS with along with warriors (IMO). Also, this time around I probably won't ever get far enough to think about T2.
---
I didn’t like the lore of WoD or Cata but MoP was decent in terms of the landscape and lore there.. i fucking hate how predictable the Garrosh situation was spelled out though. Such a great family lore-wise reduced to a quick and shitty story. The Sha / Mantid storyline was ace.
---
Honestly as much as I love the lore of this game, its a footnote to me. It just pisses me off the way they led certain characters such as Sylvanas and Jaina. 
---
It reminds me of why I don’t see movies, shitty example but the first movie I saw this decade was Aquaman (awful I know - with the family) and from the start there was no sublety in the story. The female protagonist appears out of the water in the first scene - instantly leading to predictable outcomes.
---
Im not saying the Arthas line was amazing, but it definitely wasn’t as “played out” as the future games were. You could see a vague outline of a descent into madness but it wasn’t like the second he picked up frostmourne people knew “he’s going to cull lordaron and kill his father”
---
It seems pretty tame to me. It also explains why I saw so many ERPers on retail WoW RP realms with "Healslut" in their RP profiles...
---
Hunter is great but you have to be the best you can be if you wanna till hunter, the difference between a good hunter and a bad hunter is bigger than with every other class and no other class comes under scrutiny as much as hunter.     
---
You need a thick skin and a belief in your own abilities to play hunter or you just need to not care because even if you are the best hunter ever you are still getting blamed for the wipe.
---
That's the thing. People that want TBC to be released after Classic is sometimes the same people that wants Classic now. That crowd is the one that 1.13 would address:
---
The crowd that want's something to do after Naxx and the crowd that just wants to stay on Classic, because new **horizontal content** would **NOT change** the experience in which people who loves Classic rely upon for loving it. People that want something to do after Naxx is out for a while but is too afraid to ask for new horizontal content go to the safe route that is launching TBC, this is a mistake in my opinion.
---
Things like new zones to level/farm, quests added to empty zones or new dungeons and raids that won't go further than Naxx quality cap would just add to the game without breaking what made vanilla be the game it was.
---
To the people that enjoy TBC more than Vanilla, then it's a problem. I think TBC has a way smaller fanbase than vanilla have right now, so it would be unfair to the vanilla players to be put aside for a TBC release in the future as it's not the same crowd.
---
Its a shitty anime where the main character is so overpowerd he can tank 5+ people and regen enough to negate their damage. Also the main character gains cheats somehow. 
---
But to OP no this is nothing like ASO/ALO. If you want a game like that i would recommend looking more into eastern style mmo's like FFXIV.
---
You’re as stupid as you are disgusting, I see.
---
White genocide. Lol. Whatever you say, Chud.
---
Kid cudi
---
If F&amp;F is also really low chance to be in now we know why that account is going for that much
---
Pvp servers are. Rewards and BGs arent. Camping a streamer will be its own reward to some.
---
Heroic BRD, you only get loot if you kill all the bosses.   Let's do it!
---
Probably not. Shamans sound amazing on paper, but most people get tired of constant totem weaving and having to redeploy totems everytime they move 40 yards away
---
&gt; In a dungeon scenario, you'll see more Feral Druids and Ret Paladins than you will Shadow Priests and Balance Druids.    
---
Seems about equal in five mans.     
---
&gt; And even when you do see them, they're more likely to be healing   
---
Same can be said of Feral Druids and Ret Pallys.
---
&gt;they will start working on it as soon as Classic is launched.
---
Why would they do that?  Sounds like a risk.  Will Classic have a monster opening?  Of course, no question.  People will be flooding back to experience all the nostalgia.  Private server folks will be armed and ready.  Retail players will be curious to see what all the fuss was about.
---
But after the first 3 months, I guarantee you: all the nostalgia people will have had their fill and return to their life.  I would say somewhere near 90% of the retail players will run straight back to their retail character within the first hour of play time.  The only people that will stick will be the private server players.
---
When it is all said and done, Classic will not be &gt; Retail in regards to popularity.  
---
So this idea that they are planning a life after the initial timetable for Classic is extremely optimistic.  The most probable outcome is after all the content is released and the servers are stable, they will keep a small team to ensure the life of the legacy servers the same way they do it with Diablo 2 and starcraft.
---
To go beyond that notion at this moment is crazy talk.
---
Best tip of all.
---
Yeah, there's always been banks and AH in all capital cities.
---
Oh.  Um.  Pretty much everyone.  We hang out and make crude hunter jokes all the time.  Without you guys.  Sorry.  It's just a thing.  I can't invite you.  Sorry.
---
How many people do you think are going to be begging for cheaper mounts. They are never going to change the mount price. They would not have to change the price on this. People would pay 5k for it just because it exists and would give them a benefit. Classic is more gold driven and having a massive investment on the horizon is good for long term game health. Either way I doubt they would ever add it.
---
I think its also strong for warriors / shamans cause of the dps and swing speed
---
We get the "shit" version. where NPC and guards are nerfed/removed.
---
So you've basically said you don't want to play druid or hunter, can't play warrior or rogue and don't enjoy warlock or shaman. 
---
So yes that leaves mage and priest.
---
Also, to the people that want other builds to be viable, as I said before: this is a problem that can be addressed with new gear only, without going further than the quality cap of Naxx.
---
Realistically you can google all of these. Off the top of my head I believe my Rogue at least have a quest for some poison stuff.
---
Then so is grouping up with people to complete quests...is anything other than solo leveling to 60 an heirloom like experience?
---
1.12, the Zerg version.
---
Mobs respawning after 1 second? Sounds like a nightmare. GG Hogger quest
---
I do that too and end up on druid. It's an ok lass but I'll be switching to something actually good this time around. Not just 'ok'
---
Feral Druids can tank dungeons, they'll be rolling on the same gear as a Hunter, and they'll be far more of them than Balance Druids because Balance fucking sucks for both leveling and end-game.
---
Not anymore: she had a bad run in with some Russians and had to move to Reno.
---
didn't know that, it'll be great fun to test how far you can take aoe grinding in the actual game
---
Generally just some of those big, class-defining abilities. A couple of druid forms, warrior stances, shaman totems, Hunter pet taking, warlock demon summoning. Also pally rez I believe.
---
Yeah it's so hard to find videos from anti-capitalists who want to dismantle all corporations, youtube included, and violently kill their owners.
---
I remember playing "Frets on Fire" back in the days before Guitar hero even existed or was planned atleast. It was basicly Guitar hero on PC with keyboard flipped over. Awesome times.
---
I'd rather have server merges than several low pop servers. I get the feeling that blizz is more likely to underestimate how many servers are needed, though.
---
Nice, thanks captain!
---
Yeah, I have the same feelings you have towards what route Blizzard will probably take. But I have hope they will change the mentality after Classic is launched. 
---
The TBC route is way more likely and easier to do, I'm sure, but the safe route is not always the good one. Launching TBC would fragment even more the community that Classic is trying to create.
---
I remember grinding in AV back in the day when they had pve mobs and the Stockade Pauldrons dropped for me. The loot was on FFA so I just looted it and immediately 2 other people started calling me a ninja looter for not rolling on it. I had to leave the AV and just log out before the heat got too hot even though they had no right to the item it was still people on my server getting pissy.
---
*rogue stealth sound*
---
Guilty as charged.  I do it from work so I'm not on my acct but it's still pretty satisfying.
---
&gt;If it's demoralizing to say hello to people who join your groups, maybe you're the problem.
---
How the hell is that what you got out of what I said? What's demoralising is when you have to initiate the conversation *every time*, because nobody would talk if it weren't for you. That probably means that nobody is really wanting to talk in the first place.
---
You're just twisting this into some issue with my personality or that of others, when it was never about any of that. It's simply about generally incentivising people to actually put some effort into socialising, rather than having the process be automatic. Automating social interactions is bad for an MMO like vanilla WoW and I really don't care that you don't find it a problem. Socialising is the core of vanilla and any aspect that automates parts of detracts from the core gameplay. Simple as that.
---
You can put the entire rotation on a single button macro in Classic.  Doink, doink, doink.
---
I doubt they wanna hire a tech monkey to sit there and tinker with spawn rates all day though
---
I can't find a place to download the client -_-
---
we get the rush version, but can still turn it into a long game if 10 or so players defend and turtle....great fun :D
---
But Shadow is the default class for leveling and you ignored that in your comparison.
---
Hunter Pet Training, Lock had quests for some of their minions and their mount, Pally mount, and a bunch more I am sure.
---
You Tube has some great videos on stuff like this, I personally recommend Mad Season Show.
---
Everything is cringe haHAA
---
You wouldn't, you'd be stealing from the Nightswatch in darkshire snitches get stitches
---
Your post made you come across as a stereotypical self-centered american, please forgive my misjudgment. (800ms really? More like 150 tops to east-coast servers, not even australia would have 800ms. I don't know who taught you geography but Europe is hardly "the other side of the planet" either. And what does people's proximity to their offices matter anyways? Historically they've always invited people from EU to their betas..)
---
Also, you seem quite worked up. Maybe you've had enough Reddit for today? :D
---
I think something that a lot of people asking for changes fail to acknowledge is that a lot of people coming into it will never have played Vanilla or TBC and going and tinkering with it is really going to destroy the point of Classic for a lot of people.
---
I started playing in Vanilla at 12 years old, I experienced that and TBC but wasn’t old enough to play with it the way I wanted to experience it..
---
Bringing back Classic and TBC lets people who missed out on that to come back and experience the glory days and if Blizz went and tinkered with Class balance are those people truly experiencing Classic or TBC? 
---
I don’t think people who experienced it are being fair by calling for changes, it undermines the purpose of what Classic is.
---
...? Did you reply to the wrong comment? I can't really tell why you have a somewhat hostile tone towards me when I'm literally saying Blizzard **can't** change classic.
---
there are lots of them.
---
Hunters need to do a quest to tame pets, 
---
Shammy's have to do quests for their totems (fire, air, water, earth)
---
Rogues have poison quests,
---
Pally's have specific quests too.
---
Get 60 on my undead mage and farm gold. I love frost mage aoe pulling to farm random things.
---
With a handful of servers and layering there should, in theory, never be low population servers.  But we shall see how it goes and if they fuck it up.
---
Poor Druids.
---
I'd say it's still faster to quest efficiently but it does show that dungeon grinding isn't all that bad in classic as it's on pservers. Maybe for a good group of players knowing each other playing bad leveling classes like warrior or rogue it's the best thing you can do.
---
You do you man but holy fuck there’s no way QWRTAGZXCVBY is more convenient than a simple shift or ctrl modifier.  Mind you I just have 12 buttons on my mouse plus QERF but still.
---
Price of that specific setup is unknown I thought? The $6000 version is much worse than that, no?
---
Dude, you need to chill!
---
Well you won this one!
---
I always found rogues to be great flag carriers as they had sprint. Throw in a swiftness potion and picking up the boots in the tunnels, and rogues can cap so quickly. 
---
Druids are awesome though.
---
I am not skilled enough to be good at using shift, alt, and ctrl. I got a 20 button mouse and bind everything to it
---
Idk who you're talking about here, but on private servers good hunters were very respected and considered essential for raids and BGs. But I guess it's cool and funny to hate on an entire class because the majority of the players who play them are noobs.
---
You can do the exact same strategy on both versions, it hardly makes a difference. But we are getting the zerg fast version.
---
But if pservers are any indication, people won't do this strategy unless it is AV weekend, at other times the games aren't full enough and people aren't taking it serious enough so you get long games. Hopefully we get a bit of both like this.
---
While I'm being extremely optimistic you're being extremely pessimist. Popularity wise I think the people playing Classic WONT be the formed by a majority of pserver players.
---
Besides that, everything we say is a gamble at this point, it can really shrinks down in population and be a Legacy thing forever as it can give some spark in the opposite direction.
---
It's human nature to always go back to old good working habits. But take notes that what we're seeing here are competitors, bis and hungry for views players. We'll have that in classic but along a huge numbers of standard players.
---
Yeah, as a healer, getting 4-5 spergy dps in every game... Can't wait or Classic to come out so I can uninstall that  thing :V
---
If you master totems ure a god
---
Yup just a sub
---
Oh I got the diet on lock.  I've been working at it for a couple weeks now.  I can DM you a link of the first episode if you like
---
I know I won't be able to raid(married with a baby and no way I can dedicate 3-4 hours at a time) so I am just planning on taking my sweet time and enjoying the leveling entirely, maybe becoming a gold baron by spending what time I do have grinding for rare crafting materials. Rushing to 60 just feels like a waste and a great way to burn out and quit playing entirely.
---
Would you add a requirement to clear naxx to access the new content?   
---
Do you think Blizzard would put that effort in for the 5-10% of the playerbase that would even see it?   
---
Do you think it’s more likely they will make the gear from their new raids and zones a lot better than naxx, do you think it’s possible they could completely invalidate all of classic end-game content by making the new content accessible for all level 60’s.   
---
Blizzard believe in play the patch, it has been a successful formula ffor them to time-gate content rather than have player work to it.   
---
You cannot trust them to mess with classic, TBC works.
---
Once a mage, always a mage 🧙🏻‍♂️
---
I think classic will fix the lack of community the most by not sharding together completely different realms. I can't wait for the "oh you want x enchant? Then you'll wanna whisper Happyfeet." Or whatever. Seeing the same people and knowing who can help with what, God I'm excited!
---
the only thing 1.12 AV was good for was honor. you could farm honor so fast especially as alliance.
---
That blows, was excited for that.
---
Nice. Prouda yoo.
---
God damn I wish this topic would fuck off already.
---
Any Mage ones?
---
What are the arguments against?
---
i use 6, but ctrl+6 is tough for me
---
Just play whatever you like and get into a good guild with good players early. 
---
I played a hunter main from release to Wrath, and my next favorite alt was a resto shammy, which I raided in TBC and Wrath with.  
---
I'm still unsure what I will start in classic. I loved healing and BG healing was brilliant fun on a shammy.  
---
But I am now already in a nice guild with good players (despite not even playing yet), and will be looking forward to leveling once classic is released, knowing I'll be raiding regardless of what class I decide to roll, once I get to 60.
---
That's a pretty even split. Wait until everyone starts grinding in Hillsbrad and STV though. People will start rage rolling rogues then
---
I’m genuinely curious cause I don’t know and have never seen :/
---
Yankey dankey doodle shite
---
First of all, thank you for your reply. I upvoted for the bloodninja reference :-)
---
Regarding your points:
---
There is always a middleground which doesn't lead straight to bfa.
---
I'm perfectly fine with the removal of dungeon finder for example, but some assistance like lfg rooms would still be great, as opposed to spamming chat.
---
Having the new models and upgraded graphics as a toggable option would be amazing. I like some graphical fidelity, others don't, the option to choose wouldn't hurt either party.
---
The same goes for dualspec. You have exactly two specs from which you can choose, and if your one pvp spec needs another point in enhanced harmstring, then that will cost you gold. And if you feel like the newly invested skill isn't worth it, it will cost you again. You wont have optimal speccs for every occasion, you'll be having two speccs for two very different kinds of content.
---
Everyone and especially the \#nochanges people always act like the slightest deviation from the original will lead to it's unevitable doom. That is simply not true. You can add changes which fix or improve certain aspects of the game while still staying true to the core phylosophies of vanilla. Stuff can still designed to be timeconsuming and rewarding without being a huge pain in the butt just for the sake of it.
---
And i feel this is especially true for things which don't affect everyone equally.
---
I’m like 90% sure there’s no AH in TB in vanilla
---
I know my rogue was using it until Kara.
---
WoW Instant Messenger still not confirmed for beta; if it doesn't come through, does anyone have a good alternative?
---
Personally I would prefer 1.13+ content. I think releasing TBC will just start a slippery slope of re-releasing old expansions. If WoW Classic is a success I can see 1.13+ content being hugely popular.
---
The zeppelin to TB is super cool. The first thing a few of my friends and I did in cata was ride the TB zeppelin to see how the world changed. It was like taking a guided tour or something lol.
---
Hopefully in some games people will summon Lokholar and Ivus, I miss those epic AV battles
---
No one knows
---
Many people *want* Blizzard to release the names before August 12th, but there’s no argument or evidence that they will.
---
NO ONE CARES ABOUT A SINGLE VIOLIN
---
r/Freefolk you'll find him rather quick.
---
Only thing I'm worried about is that hugr Alliance advantage at speed running through AV
---
Boy you are really gonna dislike Classic WoW, then.
---
So much hope into Classic as the savior of a dead game.
---
Yup.  Sorry.  We're just enjoying a good chuckle over here.  Don't get your panties too twisted up.  It's just a game.
---
Yeah I don't mind summoning from meeting stones at all. Having to manually form a group is good for the game ultimately, but needing everyone to spend 15 minutes flying there is just a time sink. I don't see any gameplay benefit.
---
*Was. 
---
Actiblizz is a whole different company man.
---
Pve probably
---
&gt; I think TBC has a way smaller fanbase than vanilla have right now
---
I'd be willing to put $1000 on the table that more people want Burning Crusade than want whatever you pitch for 1.13. I have that much confidence that you are full of shit. A huge number of classic players want \#NoChanges. A huge number of classic players want Burning Crusade Servers. Every single 1.13 thread has been downvoted to oblivion. Every single video for 1.13 has been ripped apart by streamers. The people who want to take Classic and make it into something it isn't are such a small minority it is laughable.
---
Flagcarrying can be a lot of fun but you need to remember that flagcarries are NOT feral. They are deep resto something like 8/11/32-ish. 
---
Ele shaman is really amazing, and it's not nearly as overplayed as people say it is, most shamans are just healers, they hardly do any pvp.
---
That's fairly disappointing, class fantasy is a factor for me.
---
I use mouse 4 and 5 for auto run and push to talk
---
Gotcha, thanks a bunch : )
---
Correlation does not imply causation, though.
---
If the Horde commits to playing defense they win pugs.
---
If the Horde commits to playing defense pugs take 1-4 hrs.
---
**DAE** tHis iS OnLy tHe BeTA and you shouldn't be excited ???
---
SO much text i cba read. But i cant do ctrl + 1 and 2. If ur on a class with a pet, u know why! :)
---
This motherfucking topic is like the shit-stain that just won't let itself wipe off, no matter how often you try.
---
One of the best feelings! even if you cant use it, just the fact an world epic drops means $$$
---
All I remember from AV were my two favorite AFK spots.
---
Well this became toxic quickly.
---
Agreed. When hybrids aren't on par with pures in terms of output, it kinda balances shit out. Everything is good at something and nothing can do everything optimally.
---
You're not as funny as you think you are mate.
---
This is false. Layering is going to boost the maximum population of every server beyond what it was in Vanilla.
---
Always upvote comments that mention UO because that was my first mmo and I'll never forget those experiences. Truly a game with NO quests (when I was a member, they added them later). You want an RPG? Bam, there's your character, have fun with zero direction whatsoever. 
---
How do you increase magery skill to Max? Cast spells. Cast spells and never stop. Find something to cast spells on. Friend, foe, monster, critters. Good times.
---
I'm after a fury warrior clown suit.
---
Probably because in Mythic+, a wipe or two means you've failed the timer and completing it is nearly pointless. On to the next one. 
---
One more reason I don't like that system.
---
I’m trying to get him to watch the clip on his stream lol
---
dwarf is OP but the rest kinda suck, humans have nice pve tho.
---
Yeah that was a big one. Also home to Blood Legion and the first player to complete the Warglaives set.
---
40y range would be cool, but its actually 20 or 30 with talent ;)
---
I made one for professions yesterday. Quite some participants here aswell https://www.strawpoll.me/18109846
---
Hunter T2 on certain races/genders looks awful. Looking especially at Dwarves here. Female night elves, especially with purple hair and no helm showing, really pull it off. T3 thankfully looks great on pretty much everyone. I'm with your that T1 is maybe the ugliest set in the game though.
---
Some tower in Westfall, I think.  Or maybe that was just a class quest for fun.
---
Are you reporting all this?
---
Oh did not know that (never got a T in Vanilla). I always see people bitching about how gear was easily replaced in TBC even if you had a set of epics. Thought that was one of the major problems with TBC.
---
More people will roll mages and warriors than hunters this time around.
---
I like heroics as a thing you have to clear to enter raids like you did in tbc then never really touched them again, they were difficult fun and it was progression.   
---
Today’s dungeons with m+ is just mindless loot piñata.
---
Thanks for clearing that up. That was an interesting article to read!
---
Agreed. I'm a salty fuck but now I see your point.
---
You try the search function before posting the thread for the 600th time today?
---
Am considering priest, though would you go UD or Troll? 
---
Both sets of racials seem quite even honestly.
---
Good for 2hand fury on horde, pretty mediocre in pvp ( I mean ofc it's a big fucking weapon, but the -stam hits hard).
---
The hardest part about running a raid guild is finding 40 people plus standbys who are reliable and skilled in their roles. This is doubly true for tanks and healers. In terms of finding raid slots, hardcore non-dwarf priests will have no difficulty at all.
---
Lol. Its reddit. Forgive them for they know not how salty and impatient they are.
---
No, you're just ridiculously lazy and people are getting bored of saying the same thing 600 times a day.
---
Thanks mate! Do i only need a subscription to play classic when it launches or also need to buy the game (cds)?
---
It's probably not that simple. It would produce more bugs and intended visual effects and it's probably the reason why they didn't go for it in classic, because the game isn't demanding enough to justify it.
---
Maybe for you, but some people have fun doing that
---
Its not personal /u/pelzanator it's just that a lot of people ask this question and nobody knows the answer so people just get frustrated when it's asked yet another time. Sort posts by new or use the search filter so you don't end up getting yelled at :D
---
The only correct answer anyone can give you is "no because nothing is forever." As far as speculating on shorter-term-forevers, it appears that Blizzard's intent is to create a sort of museum that will last. Now, they may make additional museums (TBC, WotLK). They may start producing a WoW2. They may do something else that hasn't been discussed a million times already. But whatever they do, things they have said have led me to believe that they will keep at least one Classic server available.
---

---
do u really think this song is good? nobody can deny that it’s iconic to wow but the song and video fuckin blow lol
---
bro I'm dying
---
What happens after WoTLK? People start posting "Will classic come back again?"
---
horde or ally?
---
I honestly didn't think too much about them in TBC. I ran them as needed to key/attune myself and other guildmates.  As a mage they didn't feel that much different since there were normals you had to carefully CC for anyway(such as Shattered Halls) so you basically just gave them a bit more face/respect.
---
Honestly I never cared for Heroic dungeons or mythics for that matter.  If anything I'd rather see them skip out on Heroics entirely and just do scalable Mythics.
---
Hell I'd rather see a Greater Rift system(which Mythics were based on) with proceduraly generated floors, random mob groups and random bosses(both taken from instances and GR-only).
---
Well.  Okay.  Sorry you think so.  I have some great hunter jokes though.
---
People are mad that they can’t play yet so they’re taking it out on you for asking a question instead of searching for it (since it’s asked everyday).
---
Which one is more appealing to you aesthetically and lore wise?
---
We need a much larger sample size than 3 epic drops to make any conclusions. RNG is RNG.
---
If it's random that's a bug or what? I remember at some point from vanilla to and including wotlk that it was LIFO, ie, you could protect buffs with other buffs because later applications were dispelled first. Maybe it was changed somewhere in tbc or wotlk to that, and then back to random?
---
Wew, people are touchy.  I'd bet they will keep a 'pure' version no matter what they do, so people can transfer to whatever comes next or not.
---
That shit don’t matter to me I just like winning pvp games haha
---
If the ONLY WAY to follow up on Classic would be what you describe (that is exactly what Blizzard already does) , then yes, it's not a good idea, leave Classic as it is. But you're basing your opinion on what they did and not what they can do if they follow the mindset of not messing with the vanilla experience. This goes in the oposite direction of what they're thinking for Classic and we know it based on what devs said, they want Classic to feel like vanilla. 
---
If the community starts to be vocal about wanting it in that way, they are surely capable of doing it.
---
Raid, I want to get good and be able to raid, and not just Onyxia and Molten Core. I'd also like to get multiple level 60s.
---
Scarab Lord would be nice but having a full time job and other commitments I feel like that literally cannot happen
---
Sheeesh. Thanks for the good and bad comments guys. Questions was answered to say the least xD
---
And then every time you see a person in game you have to shift f search the name?
---
Cmon dude why put in the effort for this shit.
---
Hey Shamans, WW axe is pretty great.
---
Sylvanas realm with Method guild. Don't think it needs explanation.
---
When they first added meeting stones, I was leveling an alt and we were summoning people to the platform above the lava in Blackrock mountain for a brd run. I remember I summoned myself with the stone and once everyone was there I jumped off into the lava and then accepted the summon to teleport back to the stone. I then said "oh cool they made it teleport you back now", immediately all 4 other members of my group jump into the lava and die lmao.
---
I use a similar set up, but leave ctrl + # to it's default bar (pet control) as well as shapeshift bar for druid
---
I just remember whispering Lars from Blood Legion one day to ask him some itemization questions and he ended up writing me like paragraphs of advice and even helped me get my Kara attunement. Dude taught me how to rogue.
---
Have a couple kids then come back and check :)
---
Yeah? Well let's hear 'em then.
---
Omg please tell me how to do this fake out thing! I want to do dagger hemo PvP build with prep and cold blood...how do I put up raid numbers?  Also won’t there be an Armory so people can just lookup your character???
---
Not to up on the theorycrafting for druids in TBC, but from some google searches it seems like it. It's also as you said really good for pvp due to the burst. 
---
Some other items that were good:
---
[Styleen's impending scarab (really good)](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19431)
---
[Darkmoon card: Blue dragon](http://classicdb.ch/?item=19288)
---
[Scarab brooch](http://classicdb.ch/?item=21625)
---
They also nerfed Shaman T2 3pc set bonus (Increases the amount healed by Chain Heal to targets beyond the first by 30%.) in patch 2.1.
---
Manuel Crowd Pummeler was nerfed in Wrath as well so that was still really strong for feral if you wanted to spend your life farming them.
---
Basically items that gave % increases instead of flat stats.
---
Thats a silly idea. What happens if there is a lull in players, would we have 100's or 1000's of low level mobs spawned at the same time? What happens if you pop afk, do the mobs juts keep spawning and spawning?!?! 
---
Layering makes leveling possible without any fuss.
---
I played on Thorium Brotherhood, it was a high pop RP server back in vanilla and actually had a pretty great RP community. I'm not sure it was 'famous' for anything, but as RP servers go it was one of the better ones I ever played on.
---
The RP community died and everyone left the server near the end of Wrath. I ended up transferring to Moon Guard. I think everyone knows what Moon Guard is famous for...
---
My advise would be skinning and vendor everything so you csn buy your lv. 40 mount. Early no one has gold to spend and skinning is worth a decent amound vendoring all. They also stack in 20 so you dont need to make that many backs to vendor.
---
If you want an annie may mmo /r/ffxiv is that way
---
But it's working for me so well where I'm at!
---
Perhaps bliz will consider trying the other version for those of us who missed it, and since it was 'vanilla' for some time.
---
You’re taking this so literally, it was hyperbole.
---
 I didn’t rage, I typed out to them how it’s not cool and if you have a problem with someone you should say something first. It was the second pack of bogstroks in Slave Pens to be exact. Takes more than 5 seconds to kill that pack but it was literally in the first few minutes of the dungeon.
---
I have been learning greek on duolingo and its been great to pass the time.
---
i saw this guy killing mobs near the dalaran bubble a couple days ago. when me and a few others got near him (we were questing there) he proceeded to tell us to leave cuz it was “his” grind spot. I just /ignored him and did as I please of course, but I thought i’d share.

At low levels the output is comparable, if not better, with AM.
---
If you don't worry about min-maxing why do you want all the good gear ? :p
---
I never understood this question. Is it worth to play a game? What do you mean? You play to have fun, not to create something of value.
---
My favorite private tell just after he linked it: "Give"
---
Guy certainly got right to the point.
---
I believe Mediocrity's kills of the first 4 bosses in Rag were world firsts but don't quote me.
---
You only need a sub
---
You dont have to play a certain class to win in pvp. If you play the damage, someone else will fail at healing and vice versa. That's why the appeal of the class is all that really matters. Just play it well and you'll carry your weight in pvp.
---
I'm saying if they made it exclusive to the point that only 1% or 5% of guilds killed the Lich King, it wouldn't have made the expansion worse for the other 95-99%.
---
&gt; Just be social and ask question ingame when it launches! ;) 
---
Don't, google shit but don't spam trade chat with your useless questions.
---
World first gold cap (214,748 g 36 s 47 c) without buying anything with IRL money.
---
Soloing things out in the world for mats of gold is not really a common money maker and it's not something you should worry about. As a restoshaman you have plenty of ways to make money without doing that. Like professions, Stratlive farm(or other dungeons), DME 2man with a warrior/rogue(this one is crazy good). 
---
But yes-ish. You can do some aoe tho it's really shit, for single target killing resto shaman does fine if you have some sp gear (which you absolute should get for rinsing people with a quick respec to ele).
---
&gt; I feel like you're more interested in name calling
---
Show me in my last response where I called you a name. Untwist your knickers, people disagreeing with you is not disrespectful name calling. 
---
Post Naxx content would certainly be designed with Vanilla principals, I agree with you there. I even agree that it would probably be good. Nobody is arguing against that. The argument is that nothing is guaranteed and nothing is a given. They can tell you until they are blue in the face that they will stay true to Vanilla, but the end these people didn't design Vanilla to begin with and these are the people responsible for the game turning into the shitstorm that it has become today. You can't expect people to trust them wholesale.
---
It's not apples and oranges and I think you just have a misguided definition of what a bad faith argument even is. A bad faith argument is not an apples an oranges argument, a bad faith argument is an argument somebody makes that they themselves know is *not* true. You even admit that you think they aren't lying or making arguments they don't believe, you just think it's wrong or illogical:
---
&gt; I'm not quite claiming that, but I think a lot of those concerns don't make any logical sense.
---
This idea and the idea that they are arguing in bad faith are at odds. Either they believe their argument and you think it's illogical or you think they are arguing in bad faith. It can't be both. 
---
&gt; TBC introduced a slew of features that people who prefer Classic consider as having tarnished the game and began the downward slide to LFD, LFR, lack of meaningful accomplishments
---
Literally none of these things existed in TBC.
---
Just use 1-5 (or however far you can comfortably reach) for your most commonly used spells/abilities.  Don't feel like you have to bind every last spell.
---
Once you're used to that, I recommend binding/macroing shift 1-5, as pressing shift still feels fairly natural.  If you get comfortable, control and alt modifiers are next easiest to use, generally speaking.
---
In Vanilla, I don't think any classes really NEED more than 10 key bindings.  Sure, there are more than 10 spells/items/etc that you will use, and if you become comfortable with keybinds then go for it, but 10 probably takes care of 90% of the clicking you're currently doing.
---
I am thinking like a businessman.

Classic is a sure product by this point, TBC is not and pservers are there to prove it. If they want to keep people engaged in Classic for a little more than 2 years, what they can do about it? Realease TBC who is less popular than vanilla and won't bring back the Classic playerbase that already left or promise new things added in the same design philosophy that vanilla is based off, promising that this new content won't mess or invalidate what already exists, but just add new lands and possibilities to explore?
---
just do both until lvl 20/30, then pick one to push to 60 first.
---
Stay classy Warcraft.

The first comment on that link, from 2007, says he has a 21-32 hour timer.
---
I wonder how many horde people will bring up the "Alliance Bridge is superior" for AV.
---
That's fan culture.
---
I've used middle mouse button click to auto-move since 2004. I recently tried changing it while practicing my leveling route and it feels completely wrong. I've never had trouble accidentally scrolling, but then I also use my scroll wheel to control my camera zoom.
---
No it cannot. CC targeteds do not take damage from the windfury proc because blizzard was too afraid of the epic TF being bad bc of this.
---
Indeed. The people in this place are incredibly bad-mannered and hateful as a general rule :\
---
Personally, I think it makes most sense to have Vanilla, TBC, AND Wrath servers all running in tandem.
---
I've played Stellaris for 20 hours the past 2 days. If you're into that kind of game it's pretty good
---
Doesn't even make sense. When I'm healing, I'm the one that chooses if you live or die, don't fuck with me.
---
I replayed through Warcraft 1 and 2 and now I'm going through 3 for the first time ever. I want to get a better understanding of the lore before classic launches. I've been watching lore videos too, just trying to make sense of it all!
---
*resist*  
---
**dead**
---
Unless you’re sole purpose is class synergy to optimize leveling speed, why not just play the class you want to play?
---
Its not that bad.
---
Debating between hunter or druid
---
My only fear with druid is they get such a bad stigma about them and I always feel like I have to explain my reasoning for picking one to my friends
---
It's just as sad if you let a loud, comparitively miniscule number of players turn you off the game.  Many of us plan to easily avoid those communities and not let it affect us at all.
---
I have no idea but there's plenty of ways to find out. The searchword is LH repack.
---
Same reason I love STV and Nagrand. Those quests have you grind a ton of animals and then top you off with a nice quest boost.
---
I should be given temporary mod powers to help purge the endless "what happens after naxx guys?" threads.
---
Didn't even realise I was doing it until this post pointed it out... I just need a daily taste. I feel like Cartman waiting for the Nintendo Wii.
---
Yes that kind of conversation was invented in anime..
---
Funny thing, on retail I made a new Tauren, went to take the Zepplin because fuck, zepplins are fun. Turns out it was broken, waited 20 minutes and nothing showed, but the goblin was calling out saying it arrived and was leaving.
---
In WotLK, we were raiding ICC, and our main hunter was drunk.  She burned through **FORTY** flasks trying to feed her pet.
---
&gt; there is barely any gear for bear druid in mc/bwl, everything is from dungeons, that's why they are strong early
---
no offense but I don't consider that an advantage, warriors get big upgrades in MC and druids are stuck on pre-bis for a while especially because they need to fight warriors for the defense ring in MC
---
&gt;guess you just didn't mained enough.
---
Sure you can think that if you'd like. Bottom line is most people will take the path of least resistance; gearing and using war as main tank
---
I mean if you are taking leveling easy then aoe farming is going to be hard anyway, you need to be alone so it's a tactic for tryhards at least on a server launch. If you are leveling a month or so behind maybe it'll be do-able.
---
No Envenom in Classic.
---
where the fuck i am?
---
Lololololol
---
I only read these type of posts anymore for the replies.
---
We had the world’s first scepter but got beaten to opening the gates by mere hours.
---
Legion
---
Well the reason we are getting this one, is because it the version they have data for. its better than them guessing, like pservers do.
---
He means horde excursion to gnomeregan!!
---
This is great advice for hardcore pushing Naxx, so thanks for that seriously. That being said, there are far more casual players that won’t be anywhere near Naxx and as long as bosses are going down to meet whatever casual or semi-casual goals a guild has, it’s a different kind of game, don’t you think? I’m not saying being potatoes but there’s a very large gray area here for non-nolifer guilds
---
And that’s why you go ele sham Bc u can play the damage and play the heal and increase ur warriors dps with wind fury totem. It allows you to adapt to the situation and switch up ur role. Some games you’ll be healing heavy, some games you’ll be dealin, and some games will be so intense that you’ll be dropping mad totems, cleaning poisons purging friendly players targets, tossing heals, tossing shocks and even r1 shocks for int when low on mana, tossing lightning bolts all at once. Great class to try and master. Tons of fun and impactful when mastered.
---
If you are serious about pvping as a druid you'll probably wind up with 31 points in resto. Heal/Cap/Defend monster in AB and AV and best flag runner in WSG.
---
Both ;)
---
Aegwynn US was pretty small. The top horde guild was SSDD. They were highly respected by us Alliance guilds because they were the best at progression. It was a typical struggling server. My guild had to merge with another guild to fill raids reliably.
---
/u/RuffneckFlex3 I saw you disappeared for 30 minutes from new posts and was wondering if you got mad, but here you are making quality wowplus memes :D
---
Bottom Line: Nobody knows. Nobody thought Classic was going to be a think not many years ago and here we are.
---
Blizzard will take whatever route is profitable. In my opinion Classic only exists because Blizzard finally realized after being poked and prodded that they would protect their bottom line and please a great amount of gamers. I have no delusions that Blizzard has turned a new leaf back into a great company again, in this instance things just happened to work out well for the community.
---
People want to find a group manually not automatically.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if they had the drop rate higher on these items in the beta to get people to test them and their effects. That might not necessarily be a bug but a feature of the beta. 
---
But seeing 2 purples.. damn, if that’s how it’s going to be that doesn’t seem right.
---
ctrl+1/2/6, alt+5/6/T are really uncomfortable, I wouldn't even use 6 at all. You dont use C which is very fast keybinding, also X and V are good. I personally use side mouse buttons as modifiers instead of ctrl and alt.
---
Player retention in Classic is unproven.  Private servers are also a metric I would never use for making a business decision.  The cost to develop new WoW is far greater than the cost to turn on TBC servers and milk another portion of the player base.  Both server types could function simultaneously, whereas profits from everyone's "NewWoW" could likely not be justified in development cost.
---
White theme tho? Seriously? Literally unreadable.
---
I had a resto back in vanilla, and you cannot damage farm anything.  Best way to make money as a resto shammy is alchemy &amp; herbalism. you can gather your own mats easily enough, just go farming and get what you need. Another great way to make gold is cooking and fishing. Fishing makes stupid gold as most players cant be bothered wasting time doing it. the stonecalse eels needed for stonefish oil is a great money maker. These are needed for flask of the titans, great for tanks.  
---
The other / only thing you can farm is the lashers in Dire Maul, but not till phase 2.
---
I played on that server most of vanilla.  Was in Vile, and Pretty Pink Pwnies!
---
Oh and you're not going to get bored of the mind numbing and soul crushing raid grind that you've already done? Please explain how that works.
---
This subject is the most hated and most spammed subject by now. Most of us neckbeards read every single post and get bored by it. While you propebly search by Hot and never seen this mentioned. 
---
We could use a sticky post about banning this subject untill classic releases.
---
Mythic raids in retail are obviously far more difficult than anything in Vanilla, and Mythic raiders will have no issues completing Naxx.
---
However, the average player in retail doesn't raid at all. Probably 5% of the population or less does non-LFR raids. The rest only do content that they can queue for, of which only Mythic+ is remotely challenging. 
---
Mythic+ is difficult but requires a very different attitude and skillset from Vanilla PvE. Pretty typical for players to rely on overgearing Mythic+ in order to faceroll it, instead of playing skillfully. I see the AVERAGE retail player having major issues adjusting to Classic.
---
haha you ask them are you going to raid feb 2020, they say i dont know. But asking what happens in 3+years, they know and got ideas.
---
You know Blizzard can come up and offer three paths, right? Something like:
---
\- You guys want TBC some months after Naxx, Classic Legacy servers that never changes or horizontal content like Karazhan, Hyjal, Emerald dream added to Classic in a way that it'll not change or invalidate the content already available?
---
If **Blizzard said** with all the words that they would not mess up with systems or invalidate what exists already in Classic I'm sure people would prefer the 1.13 idea. What most people have against those ideas right now is **fear** of what Blizzard could potentially do based on retail, that is a different game from what Classic is by now, but if they guarantee a design philosophy I don't see why people would be afraid of changes anymore.
---
People keep forgetting that many of these streamers did the 30-35 when they were capped @30 so they are stuck picking somewhere to grind
---
It is comical that so many chose SM and it basically comes down to a question of whether the chance of world PvP + waiting for mob respawns in the open world would be better.
---
I got some more ideas for the next couple of days, stay tuned haha
---
I do use XCV which can be seen in the picture to far right.
---
Back then I had [NoteIt](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/project-378). (I think that's the one, it stopped working a decade ago.)
---
It was also useful to write down notes about mobs in TBC heroics where it useful while figuring out a way to beat the instance.
---
[Uhm.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Molten_Core)
---
I was a huge dead by daylight fan and was playing lots that. But the same studio just re released a game it dropped last year called deathgarden. Boy let me tell you that game is the shiiiiit.
---
Also have my first legit live gig this weekend, hopefully many more over the summer... at least until the 27th
---
And refreshing this sub periodically
---
And thinking about the inevitable heat death of the universe.
---
You know, the basics.
---
Bolvar was a better badass than Varian imo. They ruined him too
---
I'm working on completing Super Metroid (on the SNES) in less than 50 Minutes, real time, which is equivalent to 00:32 in game time. Right now, my personal best is 50:43 Real Time (00:34 IGT). That will probably take me all summer, because this game requires a ton of practice. I've already sunk over 500 hours into this!
---
Vanilla conditions you to grind mobs, because grinding mobs isn't the goal.  The goal is:
---
* Grind mobs until this 1% item drops
---
* Grind mobs until I hit Friendly
---
* Grind mobs until I hit level 34 and can unlock the next round of quests in the zone I'm in
---
* Grind mobs to get these drops off of them so I can vendor/sell them
---
Grinding was rarely ever the goal, but the means to an end.  That end usually had a finite quota you could look forward to (item drops, reputation gained, level gained, or filled your bags).
---
I'm honestly not sure. Pservers say each missiles can proc, but there's been plenty of issues with clearcasting on pservers and people say it won't work, and obviously things like blizzard can only proc once.
---
I think this needs a bit of beta testing, ask some mage streamers when you get the time will you?
---
I would say that's because there's no Dungeon Finder. Without DF, replacing someone is usually time consuming so leaving group or being kicked is used as a last resort, also dungeons generally takes much longer to clear.
---
I don't mind you liking it, but if you can do the same on both versions, why are you calling it the 'zerg version'. Did a patch update the players mental attitude?
---
yeah its always been Emperor Thaurissan, but you could have 2 equiped very early vanilla. Thats the only change that i know of happend to the item.
---
DDR pad is actually a solid idea. At the very least I think I need to get some pedals.
---
agamaggan came back to life in BC, never had any good guilds though, pve or pvp
---
How many times do we have to do this? How many expansions, content patches, tweaks, balance changes do we have to go through, until people like you realize that Blizzard.is.not.the.same.company.anymore?
---
Do we need to fuck up Classic, then ask for Neu Classic in 2030 again, then people like you can push for changes, and fuck the game up again? When does it end? Will 80 year old you finally admit "ok guys you can have classic, we tried 5 times and it ruined..im sorry"?
---
When can we just play the fucking game people love? 
---
You are not optimistic, you are fucking delusional. Blizzard has not made a great game since TBC, that is more than 10 years ago. Everything they create these days is middling, competent, passable games that are liked by seemingly everyone, but loved by no one.
---
You dont like Classic, this is just you using the game as a reset, a clean slate, to push the game into a direction you want.
---
Medivh was the first AQ gate opening and Mannoroth was second.
---
Well I'm at work now, and the dark theme kind of gets to much attention in office. On phone/home I use the dark one, don't you worry
---
That would be a much easier way to farm 😁 it was as far as I can think always the endboss
---
The only problem is you spend an hour and a half in queue in order to do 20 minutes worth of dungeon.
---
Haha, how many of y'all are there? The AH tents are totally there, west of the giant totem, right by the bread vendor. I even used it during the Stress Test.
---
Every single website / archive shows it as emperor drop
---
Unless you want to read from the patch notes ...
---
It’s an emperor drop
---
Yea, but no flying makes a difference.
---
I use to mail bleach to people I didn't like..
---
Good way to be absolute dick without saying/doing anything to violate TOS.
---
Ah. I stand corrected. That was a long time ago.
---
i have also noticed some lists saying t2 drops in MC
---
however this was moved later so it was dropped in BWL. I feel with 1.12 being the patch on release t2 wont be in MC
---
this would mean most items would be where they ended up, not where they started
---
What a god. lmfao, how did they not notice the dps decrease
---
Oh sorry I should've made that clear. No it did not change peoples mental, it is just that a lot of the obstacles to rushing was removed making it a lot easier, and as it is the best strategy for honor/rep, it obviously was done a lot more.
---
I don't follow any streamers.
---
Yeah shaman it is then!
---
lol no.  Classic is at least going to suck at least 1/3rd of retail players away permanently, and a large amount of people who stopped playing at some point (myself included).  We hunger for what was lost.
---
90% will run back to retail after an hour?  Absolutely wrong.
---
Actually, this items is more useful on a beta thats lock at level 40 for some time than it ever will be at launch for level 60's. This is just a twink item for level 39 or just something you use while leveling if you lucky enough, but it's outclassed by many options once you hit lvl 60.
---
As a warrior, I didn't have much trouble marking inbetween auto attacks, and it helped me a lot when running groups with unknowns or unpredictable DPS to get into the habit of marking before the pull. For emergency targetting, when shit is going off the rails I had a macro bound to shift+m3/4 that would mark with a specific symbol and tell them all to down it first, which helped coordination and saved us from wipes many times.
---
How do you mark while moving then?
---
Tichondirus is not for you
---
Go mage since ur pve focused. Otherwise it’s a toss up since both r great pvp classes and great at farming gold. Portals r nice as is water/food.
---
The streamers are wearing best in slot gear and twinked the fuck out you know? Using Engineering and the best specs for their class...
---
Also inside an instance they avoid stream snipers and being grief and harassed.
---
Do quests and grinding mobs was and will still be the fastest way to level.
---
ps: OP just Google  Joana the Speed Leveler and stop being such a n00b!
---
#r00fles
---
Yeah If every F&amp;&amp; would be in lol. But Servers are still very dead
---
There's also the one about how all hunters think all the other hunters are noobs.
---
T2 Legs drops from ragnaros, and T2 helm drops from onyxia. This has always been the case.
---
No, it's clearly hunter loot.
---
Noggenfogger and Savory Delight also help protect important buffs against purge.
---
there's a guy in camp t who sends you to the crossroads.  also one of the follow ups in mulgore sends you to the beast killer quest lady
---
I think three wipes is the threshold for most people. 4 wipes and the group probably falls apart.

I never heard about any zeppelin from TB, when was that introduced?
---
Oh man I wish I could forget it all just to live it all again. Although if that was the case, I'd have to lose my job and fiance to play as much as I did
---
Cycling through my games. Finally got around to playing Stick of Truth like 6 years late. Not sure what's next.
---
Sounds amazing! See you in Azeroth!
---
Left hand move and/or hit tab, right hand select and/or mark? Alternatively, you can double hold mouse buttons and move with the right hand.
---
Maybe they changed it very early, maybe you confused HoJ with FoW? https://classicdb.ch/?item=11810 another very nice trinket. Memory from 15 years ago isn't always the best.
---
But anyway, in 1.12 you will have to kill emperor for HoJ.
---
Great times.
---
Some redridge in there too
---
Did this on retail yesterday btw. Finish the quests in Mulgore and you get sent to Orgrimmar via flight path. So yeah, you absolutely can.
---
Many of us were on EJ way before Kara.  People were getting their tactics from there very early on.  The info was less available but I don't expect today's average player to be that much better at staying out of the fire than they were in Vanilla.  You're not doing astrophysics in current WoW either.
---
You didn't......
---
I agree that they should work On mythic+ much more especially since its so popular. 
---
&gt;Very rarely did I ever run to foot to the dungeon, except for underrot and temple of Seth (usually got summoned).
---
Your teammates must love you ^^
---
You're full of shit. What the fuck are you talking about? Did you even read the post where I said about the design philosophy? Do you even understand what that means? When did the player base fucked with vanilla WoW? lol
---
Who are you to say people like or dislike Classic?
---
just wow
---
The fast version where everyone rushes to the bosses was caused by a patch that nerfed the NPCs. Classic is based on 1.12 which came after the NPC nerf so we will most likely be getting this version. 5-10 players defending base is usually enough to prevent the zerg and cause a long lasting AV like before the patch, though. 
---
Also, iirc, the horde zerg requires a wall jump for anyone that doesn’t have slow fall. So depending on how blizz handles wall jumps, zergs may be less viable than they were in vanilla 1.12.
---
Your going to level at the same times? Not to burst your bubble but mobs level are not dynamic, leveling is long, your opportunity to level when you will all be together are scarce. Level alts together.
---
Layering is why.
---
They've confirmed that all items will be their final 1.12 forms, stat-wise, but reading the itemisation post again it's not clear whether or not things will be in their final *places*. I could see some T2 being available in MC at the start.
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/news=291443/itemization-in-wow-classic-items-to-use-1-12-versions](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291443/itemization-in-wow-classic-items-to-use-1-12-versions)
---
Well fuck, it seems like I missed 2 classic+ posts in these 30 minutes...
---
&gt;Now, they may make additional museums (TBC, WotLK).
---
Splitting the community even more? I would be surprised.
---
Did they mentioned a "lateral" expansion without increasing the level cap or changing the "core value" of the game?
---
I think the drop rates were actually that high. When I played during vanilla during the leveling process I had 3 boe epics before 45. While that may not be telling because it's only personal experience I think people underestimate how often a .01% rate actually is when you are killing thousands of mobs during your leveling process.
---
Oh boy, that one had me rolling.
---
If you were usually extremely lucky, then sure. I never saw an epic Boe drop in vanilla, and I leveled 3 chars to 60, nor did any of my friends get one.
---
Still prefereable to a raised level cap
---
you level 30-60 from mob grinding alone?
---
Well maybe some of you bored people can answer a couple questions for me.
---
1. Is xp shared in a party, like for kills?
---
2. How "easy" is it to level with another person if you make 2 different races on the same faction? (think dwarf and human)
---
3. General advice for a duo leveling together
---
paladin isnt even on there guess that was from a horde only source
---
You can knock out Emp runs in ~15 minutes a pop with a decent group through lava jumping.
---
I wish I hadn't found out about it a couple weeks ago.
---
I'm usually a Horde player, but a friend who plays a lot on vanilla private servers wants me to join him as an alliance player when vanilla launches. My main problem is I want to play a Mage, however i'm told it will be silly to not roll Gnome.  
---
No offence to Gnomes but I can't get on with them. I dont like their cast animation and gear looks pretty poor on them (in my opinion) Are people right? Am i silly to play Mage and not play Gnome? Is the passive difference that huge? I'm hoping I can get a addon which makes my character look Human, on my screen.
---
#\#NoMeansNo
---
#\#NoChanges
---
No Changes means No Changes. This is literally a brick wall that you cannot in any way argue against. No Changes crowd cannot be appeased unless you give them EXACTLY what they want. There is no 1.13 that meets the No Changes crowd's demand. 1.13 must be its own server. 
---
So that out of the way, you've already lost a good chunk of players to their "pristine" versions of the classic. Now, after those guys leave, the vast majority of the remaining people want Burning Crusade. That's a fact. Without the no changes crowd, the dominant majority is the Burning Crusade crowd. The only way to appease them is to give them exactly Burning Crusade. Got it? 
---
So now you've got this tiny sliver of players... maybe 50,000 players at most. Is Blizzard going to design premium content for that subset of players? No, I don't think they will.
---
Funny meme but all the people complaining about not being in the beta are cringy as fuck.
---
I had a friend test windfury resetting swingtimer on beta, that one is confirmed. Also, can I ask why you recommend 2 sinister strike into SnD on opener for combat swords? I personally SS into SnD and was wondering what your reasoning was.
---
Until she shot a man just to watch him die.
---
if it is totally zerg fest, with tones of players everywhere, my plan will be to get to about level 10, then get a group to go to into Ragefire Chasm and just farm the mobs over and over again to grind up. We can do this without any issue and any grief from other players. Will be able to level easily to about level 15-18 doing this easily enough.....then aim to go to the Wailing Caverns.  
---
Alliance can do this too. Get to level 10-12 then hit the deadmines, level in there over and over till about level 18. Then they can pop off to Stormwind and do The Stockades till about 25. 
---
Both horde &amp; alliance can then go to from early level 20's and head to Shadowfang Keep. 
---
While it may be a bit boring cos questing the early levels will be hard, this way can allow us to get nice blue drops and keep leveling up too. 
---
If the layering helps, then I'll quest away solo like all others. :D
---
Ok
---
good mobs to kill 45+ for Alliance
---
Ugh, didn't even think of that.
---
But I want the honor system to be in the game when I am lvl 25ish, which should be in about a week, STV just won't be the same without it.
---
I think mage is actually the only class that doesnt learn any abilities via class quests while leveling. You do need to complete a quest for max rank conjure food/water at level 60, though.
---
TBC private servers, which are notoriously poorly scripted and broken mechanically, is a poor argument.
---
Wow. How do you plan on doing that?
---
This right here
---
They shouldn’t report spell batching. That was in vanilla
---
i had a suspicion that was the case so i googled it and it was in classicdb. scratched my head a bit then moved on i guess
---
Shiiii play what you enjoy or you'll regret it!
---
I personally didn't enjoy druids, but druids are awesome imo
---
Obviously they have the stigma that they don't excel at one portion of the game during raiding, but if you really wanna drood you can find a raid group that's ok with you even playing feral (prob gunna have to heal and OT sometimes tho cuz feral dps is pretty hot dog shit)
---
If u love druids, play it! If your friends complain , don't heal them!! Haha jk
---
My two main classes since 05’ are Mage and Hunter. Like others have said, if you play hunter and don’t weave abilities around your auto-shot, let your pet taunt in group situations, or accidentally pull something by right clicking and auto-shooting, you will be ridiculed. 
---
It’s easy not to fuck up as a hunter though. Just make sure you know how a hunter plays. I suggest watching Raziya the Ravager’s videos on YouTube. He is a very experienced and seasoned hunter, and has made many general guides on how to play hunter most effectively. 
---
You’ll hit 60 faster on a hunter than a mage. With mage however, you have many utilities such as Portals, and crafting food/water, so other people will love you. You have arguably the strongest cc in the game with all of your frost abilities(cone of cold, frost nova, blizzard, or any abilities with slowing effects) and polymorph. 
---
I would say play a hunter if you want a somewhat fast and easy play to 60, they for sure can be a blast running around tagging every mob you see and not having to ever really worry about dying. 
---
Mage has a lot of downtime drinking in between pulls, so if you don’t mind a slightly slower pace to 60, Mage could be the one. 
---
Both are very different but exciting classes to play, both excel in PvP, and Mages are #1 ranged dps at 60. If you learn how to play either class effectively, you will have a blast. 
---
Personally, I am maining mage, and will have a more casual hunter alt.
---
Your version of PVP is not PVP, it's just taking lowbies.  Sit your low rank ass down.
---
escape artist does not suck in the slightest!  there are even awesome plays night elf hunters can make with shadowmeld
---
No one seems to be saying this but you're completely right man.
---
Because it is not part of Phase 1.
---
PVP will be in a different Phase - we start on Phase 1
---
Warriors and mages will be. Also a sea of child playing rogue.
---
Maybe the buffs every fail did.
---
I played 3 chars to 60 in vanilla and only seen 1 epic drop in a party in uldaman. Ive seen Some boe epics at 60 tough
---
True, people will still fight but not be pressured to... sucks but phase 2 should be in before October :)
---
No, beta has created an artificial environment where an unnaturally large concentration of players are stuck in the same level band due to the previous level cap. Any conclusions you are reaching based on what youre seeing now are dead on arrival due to this fact alone, but you also made a handful of other assumptions that are false on top of that.
---
alt+A/D?
---
Yesterday I was planning on playing an Undead Priest, so I went on a private server and started planning my leveling route. But then I'm like, fuck me do I even want to play Undead? I kinda want to go Alliance for the new experience (played UD Lock in classic). However there is half of me that wants to play something I am familiar with so I have a PvP/PvE edge and half who thinks I should go ballsdeep into the newness and go Alliance with an unfamiliar class, which for me would probs be priest, paladin, mage, or hunter. If anyone else is also experiencing this issue, please be the deciding factor in my mind and choose for me because I am a indecisive little bitch. Thanks! =)
---
Most of them don't even know which class to play in classic, but hey have you ever thought what will happen in 3 years from now?
---
It's like asking a girl after a tinder match, what kindergarten their kid is going to attend.
---
Many of them tried the zones first, but they were so over populated that questing was nearly impossible and things usually devolved into massive ganking and pvp, which while fun, doesn't give you xp.  The streamers being in the leveling zones made the problem worse because of the high number of stream snipers.  Streamers grinding levels in SM actually improved the beta testing ability of everyone else.
---
Don't let your dreams be dreams.
---
There were rogues that had it back in vanilla... usually guild leaders.
---
Fallout 2 Restoration Project. I had never heard of it before. Added a whole bunch of new quests and content that was just sitting in the game files waiting to be completed, but the developers had to rush the game out. 
---
That might keep me busy for another week or two, and then I'm looking at God of War or Sekiro. I'm also close to finishing NG+ on Dark Souls 3. Keeping busy until the end of August is going to be a struggle, though.
---
The end of the day, gold buying existed in Vanilla.  I'm more worried about gold sellers returning!
---
Thanks for sharing your thoughts
---
I’d hate for fans to beg for vanilla wow servers for over a decade only for Blizzard to deliver and then a year down the line put Activisions taint all over it and ruin the experience for everyone that has just been asking for Classic Wow all this time.
---
Yeah can't go wrong, both are useful racials.
---
If you were alliance I'd say dwarf has fear ward and NE has that faster movement speed during death but on horde it's a bit more of personal preference I don't think there's one that's definitely better
---
No, ganking lowbies doesn't even give honor, its my lvl 20-30 ass shitting on alliance shitstains in Ashenvale/STV and even in Desolace (which is usually where the people who  doesn't want to PvP try to hide)
---
Same here
---
You can still PvP as much as you want
---
They likely have data for anything changed during the course of vanilla - I imagine the internal database format didn't change much within that span.. perhaps I'm wrong but I'd bet they could at the least run that old version on their old client.
---
It's not a new WoW, just new content.
---
Think of it like that: They can invest a lot of development time to convert all of TBC assets to the a playable state like they did with Classic OR they can invest little time and effort and add, lets say, a new dungeon, using assets already existing in different expansions and watching how the community reacts to that. Which would be cheaper and faster to do? Ok, new content patches are bigger than that, but even so less work than converting an entire expansion I think, as we are witnessing right now with Classic.
---
Unless people actually enjoyed playing the content. That would be crazy though. People playing a beta of a game they genuinely have fun doing what content there is by themselves or with others.
---
Yeah, even if it isn't a launch server this time around we should try to congregate to one spot. What are the gonna name the servers after former developers? Blizz made so many servers its hard to imagine that they have anything original up their sleeves.
---
I played wow from Vanilla through most of Wrath and only had one Boe Epic drop. If I recall it was the Bow of Searing arrows? I think. Luck is a cruel mistress.
---
Rogue get the guarding the flag job. Rogues are not the 1v1 kings anymore.
---
Hand of rag kinda sucks though
---
Or you can make a macro with any icon you want /use Flask of the Titans
---
It's weird... I hate the wait, but it feels somewhat comfy not being the only one in pain.
---
TBC was the pinnacle of WoW... it was the best!
---
TBC was last time WoW was hardcore and you earned and worked for your gear and respect from others.
---
WotLK was good and the peak of WoW, but it was also where WoW started to slip and by the end of WotLK... WoW was going downhill and has been going downhill ever since sadly.
---
I personally would love to see them offer servers that go on to TBC and still keep servers that are pure vanilla.
---
Holy shit Nobbel. Is his channel still going? I watched basically his entire youtube library when I worked a shitty nights job, this must have been 3/4 years ago
---
The problem for guys like you though is that like I was saying earlier there...you're missing all the patch cycles and idiosyncrasies of all the classes and specs from 1.0 through 1.12.
---
WoW Classic will be more like joining a WoW expansion in the last 3 months where the power creep has set in and the only real challenge left is the final content. I don't know if you've been watching Twitch streams, but people are AoE pulling entire dungeon wings while at the appropriate level. It was never like that the first time we leveled.
---
I also think it's not terribly fun for people like yourself to be thrown into a game where people have been dissecting and analyzing every single min/max option, gear option, etc., for years on private servers. You won't get to really do any experimenting or discovering for yourself.
---
The biggest thing though is that unlike my naive and young self in November 2004...you won't get to choose your class and race based purely on the fantasy aspect of it. You'll be making your choice based on what every expert, streamer, and the general knowledge base dictates.
---
If they shook up the class specs and balance, moving more towards TBC, then suddenly it once again opens up the possibility to pick any class and spec that sounds cool to you, and have it roughly work out in the end in terms of being able to play the game.
---
Back in Nov 2004, you just assumed that would be the case. After all, what kind of dev team would leave over a dozen specs as basically useless?
---
I'm biding my time researching off-meta builds. :)
---
This post hits home hard. Subreddits like /r/classicwow is why I wish reddit would update their /hot formula. Shit stays on the front page of subreddits for too long imo.
---
There better be a server called Pepperidge Farm
---
I think 1.13 is shaping up nicely from what I've seen in the beta
---
That is fair! All classes look interesting but I am not sure how much of a commitment a warrior would be, I like the idea of the warrior gameplay but making the economy works seems a bit more complicated.
---
Usually guild leaders. Almost ALWAYS loot masters/ninjas.
---
Warlocks have death coil or something like that. 
---
It's a terror spell, not a fear and that can't be resisted. It's a pretty short duration though.
---
Your best bet is to incapacitate the paladin then focus the warrior.
---
Because of staggered PvE raids. Only MC and Ony will be in phase 1, and PvP won't, just like vanilla. Once people have enough time to get MC geared PvP rewards will be introduced that roughly match them. Phase 3 then exceeds them in terms of power.
---
i remember all the hit and crit percentages being changed to rating and my warrior twink going from strong to extremely overpowered overnight #nostalgia :D
---
So I’m fine with either direction, but it would have a serious impact on the class I want to play.  I *love* shamans and never got to play one in vanilla, but once alliance got them I got to roll one in TBC, and played one ever since.  This time around I’m rolling horde and could play shaman in the place I missed them, but if they go to BC well then it’s a full on repeat of my life that I don’t necessarily want to relive.
---
I love support characters that focus on buffs/utility first and healing second.  I could get a similar result with druid (my original vanilla character) or disc priest perhaps.  The safest bet is Priest because it’s all new either way while druid/shaman have some level of repeat.  I just like druid/shaman more overall though...
---
I know its not planned to be in phase 1, but why isn't in phase 1.
---
Imo it should be phase 1 as it makes lvlng more enjoyable, even without WSG or AB.
---
they way Blizzard has done updates to WoW, has been to override. Like: 
---
1.9 is on live. 
---
1.10 is on PTR. 
---
1.10 gets pushed to live, and 1.9 is gone and not saved.
---
i love this meme
---
When there’s a dagger to your back you’ll feel pressured to.
---
I have quit WoW plenty of times since I first played in 2005 &amp; whenever I return its always to "Level a new character". I never think "I really miss raiding on WoW" it's always levelling.
---
Shaman totem quests made me laugh.  First couple are these ridiculous long chains that take you all over the place, then it's just like, "k here's your next one."
---
And I remember being so disappointed back in vanilla when I went to Ravenholdt Manor for my rogue quest, and then there was just nothing to do with them ever again.
---
It's just not the same, alt is a weird modifier to reach. I actually only use shift as a modifier.
---
It's fine, I just make do with 2 less keybinds
---
The issue is what kind of gear would heroic versions of dungeons give? Right now, some drops in dungeons are better than many epics in MC and BWL, and that is from normal dungeons.
---
If heroic dungeons gave gear equal or better gear than MC and BWL, then that would eliminate MC and BWL from the game.
---
Classic WoW has a linear progression system, where dungeons are placed between fresh level 60 and entry to the first raid.
---
The skill ceiling for being good at a hunter is the highest of any class.
---
Hunters are the easiest class to play... and the hardest to master.
---
Again, it is astonishing how people in this delusion talk about how easy it would be.  It's probably not happening.
---
&gt; While I'm being extremely optimistic you're being extremely pessimist
---
No, I am just having realistic expectations.  Why?  Because Blizzard is not going to compete with itself for players.  And really from a sales perspective, there is a cap on how much Classic can even make.  Because there is no store or boost available.  If not enough people are playing retail, I means they aren't making money anymore boost, mount sales, pet sales, etc.
---
So really, this idea that Blizzard will try to make Classic bigger than it is, would actually be extremely dumb on their account as they would be putting a whole in their own pockets.  And private server players don't need new content.  Those people are fully locked into this state of mind that change is awful.  All they want are their meat and potato's and to be left alone.  So those people won't care.  They will simply repeat the gearing process over and over until their die.
---
And the reality of the whole thing is... casual mmos make more money than hardcore mmos.  They just do.  People don't have as much time these days to play videogames.  Hell, kids even don't.  That's why twitch became so popular.  So many kids these days would rather watch videogames then play them.
---
Not gonna happen.
---
Pretty sure most Horde raids will be looking for like 6-8 from what I understand, so going shaman should be extremely safe.
---
I’m lucky enough to have RL friends who have been really close and have played on and off since BC. We are in the same boat as you. All 4 of us took off a week for launch and have a schedule already laid out for maximizing rest/playtime without getting fatigue. Here is what we have decided to play starting with me.
---
Warlock: tailoring/skinning - undead
---
Priest: enchanting/tailoring - undead
---
Mage: alchemy/herbalism - undead
---
Warrior: blacksmith/mining - Tauren 
---
We are still not sure how we will level together but most likely will be in pairs of 2 for maximum xp. We have even done testing on p servers to get a idea of what route to take And where to meet up.  
---
I think the planning aspect is very fun and we are very excited to start this adventure together. We want to be efficient as possible without trying to speed run through it as we want to enjoy the experience.
---
I actually decided to not sub until September 3 even though I'll be able to play on release. I leave the next day for vacation. I don't really want to waste a week of playtime just to get in on launch (yeah right, will be nothing but queues).
---
Willpower, baby.
---
Badlands has a lot of wildlife to kill , the rock elementals are good for money but take much longer to kill than the wolves.  
---
The wolves and owlkins in hinterlands are also abundant and easy.  
---
Feralas yetis are also good depending on how they are on classic, they arent too tanky but hit pretty hard so its class dependent I suppose. 
---
Azshara has some good spots in general due to it being an incomplete questing zone so not many go there.  
---
Arathi also isnt too bad either considering its usually not as populated as stv or desolace when level 30 and forced into pvp zones
---
Loot in bg raids isnt on a roll in Classic only if u created a party before stepping inside the av Will u have group loot on with ur party members
---
This is a list I frequent from time to time. It's not well done or comprehensive, but it gives good insight from players:  [http://capnbry.net/wow/gspots.php](http://capnbry.net/wow/gspots.php)   
---
Here's a video StaySafe did that gives some good info:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg8F74QnDYg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg8F74QnDYg)
---
Honestly, they have something in BFA with this exact functionality. But they limit it to questing (LOL) and Mythics. Or you could copy EverQuest and have their function but mostly barebones LFG system. It flags you as LFG and puts you on a list that other people can see. It’s not perfect, and I believe Blizzard should put a little more work into their version if they do it and it would probably be at least functional. 
---
WoW should have a similar LFG system. You would still have to find people, it would help reduce spam in chat channels, you don’t get instantly teleported to the instance, you would still have to maintain a positive relationship with other players if you want to keep finding groups, and it allows players to inform others “I’m down to party.” Without having to constantly typing 40 War LFG Ulda in 3 different chats.
---
No problem I'm in your same boat, indecsisive as hell. Tmrw I'll have new classes and races in mind
---
I will say, alliance priests have some great perks. Dwarf priests get fear ward, basically an instant raid inv . NE priests have the improved move speed during death, very nice while leveling.
---
Alliance overall is actually very welcoming to newbies as well, dun morough (dwarf/gnome starting zone) is super chill and my personal favorite of all starting zones.
---
Teldrassil (NE starting zone) is ok, usually less populated, and spits you out right into auberdine which is the best questing for 12-17.
---
About the classes , there's too much to say about pala mage and Hunter, but they are all extremely strong at Max lvl. Pala will be a slower leveling process than the others.
---
Good luck!
---
The main reason I think is that the PVP honor system introduces a ton of new items and a gearing progression that would invalidate a large number of items early on (thus feeling less like vanilla). For instance, I know that if you are melee the weapons gained via the honor system are better than anything until after BWL as such but not having them in the game and accessible you give a more honest progression through the content for the first phases. 
---
Also if you believe that no honor system will detract from WPVP in phase 1/2 of classic you, my good sir, are most certainly mistaken. In a world with no PVP honor system and battleground, you will find a thriving WPVP scene that is what some of us are most looking forward to.
---
Human memory isn't as awesome as our egos think it is. We're all quite flawed like this.
---
Actually I’m not sure. I though they tweeted the 4GPU 1.5TB setup at $6,000, but I could be wrong. It would make sense that Apple would have the barebones be $6,000 and the top-end be “TBD” haha.
---
But if they are doing that, the entire honor system will be delayed for months until people are 60 and already starting MC clearing, which sucks.
---
There are so many PVP rewards for low levels that were always fun to obtain, and now they are just going to gut that entire aspect of the game for "raid balance", although they still enable the 16 slot debuff cap?
---
Thats stupid, if they can launch with 16 slot debuff cap then they should also launch with the honor system at least.
---
He mean guilds will just give it to holy paladins for them to have some fun outside of raids.
---
You didn't need it, but people still did it. It's a joke because it's real. These UI's happened
---
Sure it was rare at this scale, but it doesn't make them less real
---
Again, the #nochanges crowd is based entirely on the fear that Blizzard will fuck up if given the chance. That's the whole idea besides #nochanges. lol
---
Do you really think the #nochanges crowd would go against Hyjal existing in the game as a leveling or high level zone if that didn't change any core designs of the existing game? You're the delusional one here, dude.
---
You're gimping yourself
---
The non relevant threads get removed. You want a sticky for all repeat threads and you end up with a front page of only stickies and people will still make new threads asking the same questions cause they feel like no one visits the sticky threads. Just ignore the threads you don't want to read. It's a very old game, it's not like there's a ton of new content to be discussing anyway.
---
Only two threads can be stickied at a time.
---
I think your concerns/complaints are overblown at the moment anyway.
---
Going down the only road
---
Fully agree! I think I didn´t experience leveling without the honor System... Started too late!
---
Will be interesting to experience. Although I guess killing alliance will still be great fun :D
---
Did the same in EQ.
---
We need a sticky for this topic... erry damn hour.
---
I think so as well. On private servers theres a ton of warriors, at least on horde side.
---
Same, might also just be a side effect of virginity perhaps
---
Oh damn you forgot the everlasting queue to enter
---
I refresh new every 10 Seconds and I approve this message!
---
yeah or like a search function
---
Can you pm me the server's name ? I'd like to try 1-10 leveling on a crowded server.
---
Depends on what you want to do. 
---
I can tell you any top end (or even middle ground guild ) would love to have 8 shamans per raid, because of totems. As a druid it really sucks
---
What makes you say that? Honestly curious.
---
If you're talking about the changes already done to the vanilla game that would make the Classic actually be a 1.13 in a sense, yes, I have to agree.
---
This post is so dumb. Are you trolling?
---
I want a sticky thread regarding demands for sticky threads…
---
Well that is something I did not know about Reddit haha. Thankyou
---
Such an accurate description!
---
Ya this is why I didn't care that they were pissed, it is just he way BGs are. They were just annoyed because they could see me loot it in the chat window and felt entitled to a roll.
---
all I kind of read was "I dont like" " I dont want to" "i'm not into"..... 
---
maybe you should stop whining and just look forward to playing. Its not all about you!
---
Yeah we could use a few, particularly one redirecting people to 
---
/r/classicwowplus 
---
for those discussions
---
I dont mind the class talk to much
---
the beta questions could use one as well
---
Hi, /u/Eurothemist
---
But arent there many others much more valuable debuffs than rupture that make u unable to use it because its low priority?
---
Honestly, if you are getting so hangry for action, now is the time to take a rest from Classic. We all know most of us will OD on the game when it comes out, so take some time to relax in the calm before the storm.
---
And you now understand why WoW used to be referred to as "World of WarCrack" and "addicting". Both of which I haven't been true for me since the End of WotLk. 
---
But for me, it is also nice knowing I have 3 more months of being a normal, productive, member of society before I absolutely destroy my life with WoW Classic.
---
I don’t look at streamers but I watched the beta final between Snutz and Venruki, if that snutz dude is famous for being a good warlock 😂😂
---
the rest of us keep watch, brother, worry not :D
---
I hope one is named Mal’Ganis. What a great name just sounds so spooky and evil and lichy
---
Plus I always considered Nagrand  a beautiful area.
---
Does anyone else feel that the health totals are too high for the 30-40 level cap compared to vanilla?  Maybe I am too used to private servers and they were bugged?
---
&gt; But if they are doing that, the entire honor system will be delayed for months until people are 60 and already starting MC clearing, which sucks.    
---
Vanilla problems.   
---
&gt; There are so many PVP rewards for low levels that were always fun to obtain   
---
And overpowered ruining the challenge of the game.   
---
&gt;  although they still enable the 16 slot debuff cap?    
---
Because raid composition will be built around the debuff limit. For example you'd never bring a Shadow Priest for 8x slots but might for 16x. They don't want raiding guilds to have to kick people/add people when they go from MC (8x) to BWL (16x) later.    
---
What I am saying is, they're doing it to solve legitimate social problems that it will cause.
---
I actually lurk around in here quite a lot too.
---
I'm excited. But I also feel how my answers become more and more passive aggressive. 
---
I think this is mainly due to the same 7-8 questions being asked multiple times a day. It's sickening. Where are the stickies? Where are the mods telling People to actually use the fricking search function? :D
---
Huh? I'm afraid you lost me. The current build is 1.13.2
---
 I've ever known
---
Do yourself a favor and uninstall it today.  After I quit playing it, I feel so much better.  
---
Overwatch brings out the absolute worst in people.
---
What?  Utility is the single best asset about rogues
---
First I've seen on the matter. Unless they get flushed out by admins
---
Yep, some people find repetition very relaxing and calming.
---
Damn, my guild pulled c'thun twice before we just went to naxx. I wish I had gotten in a pserver years ago to finally see all the classic bosses. Now I want classic even more
---
The diet changes have been easy for me... It's changing my activity level that's hard as fuck.
---
Not really a skill, but the warrior quest at 30 gives you the BiS weapon for a really long time. If I remember correctly it’s something around level 40ish when you can get a replacement. So it’s essentially a must do.
---
Druids have aquatic form, shamans have the notorious totem quests. I think to tame a pet the hunter has to complete a quest? I can’t remember on that one, I haven’t played a hunter in a very long time.
---
wait until you have to grind like 15+ levels 1-60.
---
The penultimate neckbeard who can't even neckbeard right.
---
When im done getting my pre-bis my focus will be on getting the frostsaber mount (alongside raiding &amp; prepping for raiding...)
---
Dark Iron, home of the PAA which was a fanguild for Penny Arcade. Outside of that we were probably most famous for the Everything Must Die raid on every horde warleader at once.
---
I mean, I couldn’t care less what streamers are playing and while I understand 1.12 isn’t perfect its the closest thing people are going to get in terms of experience. 
---
Im sorry but changing class balance undermines the integrity of Classic. If I play Classic and for example - Warriors don’t become the dominant force with full tier gear, I will personally feel cheated by Blizzard. 
---
I think leaving it as is would be the fairest way to get the most players what they want, the people asking for balance changes IMO don’t want to play Vanilla, they want to play their own game.
---
All of them, because lets face it they are correct
---
Attempt at humour.
---
Thanks for the info. So say 10 players def, do they need to do that the entire game, or will an initial def of the zerg halt the tempo and force a longer game?
---
&gt;The main reason I think is that the PVP honor system introduces a ton of new items and a gearing progression that would invalidate a large number of items early on (thus feeling less like vanilla). 
---
Yeah, but so will the 1.12.1 itemization do anyways, which is far better optimized than the earlier itemization. And yes obviously some of the honor rewards are great, altough a lot of them require WSG/AB/AV (I am pretty sure), and if some nerds want to min-max  by sweating their ass off in PvP, then fucking let them?
---
I think warlock had like 2 pre-raid BIS items from honor PVP, and they were like rank 8-10 or something which was quite the grind.
---
&gt;​Also if you believe that no honor system will detract from WPVP in phase 1/2 of classic you, my good sir, are most certainly mistaken.
---
I think it will partly detract from it, because there isn't a reward incentive, like getting the sergeant cloak which was one of the first long-cloaks in the game etc, or other rewards. Yes there will still be PvP, and bitch-fighting. But it would be more fun if the titles were added imo.
---
Yeah thats what i thought. But i mean, i've searched and combat rotation seems SO boring, like keeping attack speed buff up and spamming sinister strike and eviscerate.
---
Not always. Stormwind didn't have AH at first which is why Ironforge was the main hub for alliance in vanilla ... once SW got AH, people started to migrate there more. AFAIK when the AH was added to SW it was also added to other non hub cities (UC, TB, Dal, etc.). If there is an AH in TB in the beta, there shouldn't be ... but most of my vanilla memories are from launch, and I'm finding out that 1.12 was actually quite a ways after launch, so my timeline may be mixed up.
---
personally, i am for tiny changes to old systems but nothing more at least for the foreseeable future.
---
For an example: I would want people to have 2 spec options they can switch between for a decrease cost to encourage pve and pvp.
---
something like 10g to switch specs between 2 options same respec cost for if you want to change one of those specs to a new one. 
---
not a huge change but allows people to more easily play pvp and pve each day if they want to.
---
1. Xp is shared, but at a reduced amount when grouped. So if you would get 100xp for killing a mob solo, you would get about half that when duo.
---
2. It's easy once you're actually together. You would just need to decide if you wanted to group up from the very get go (which means someone has to make a trip), or group up at a slightly later level. 
---
3. Do all the quests, and grind on the way to each quest. Leveling together is a lot more entertaining for me personally, and its a bit easier. But if you're not smart about it, it can take longer.
---
Warrior was always the second highest played class in Vanilla, after Hunters. The number of them at 60 was MUCH lower though.
---
Mage quests just sort of stop around level 40 I want to say?
---
And none of them really reward anything meaningful.
---
But yeah wind totem being a "go to thousand needles once" quest after all the bullshit water totem put you through was insane.
---
I'd say that's fine and within the scope of the game as designed. The game designers could easily have leashed those mobs if they wanted to. Plus you could say you are RP'ing being chased by a dragon. If there is a reasonable combat solution to the problem, it's probably fine.
---
I think my definition of griefing is extremely narrow, and just happens to catch this particular offender. 
---
I also find it interesting that you and many others keep bringing up the streamers, and I can't help but think some of this is backlash is really reflective of some sort of jealously or anger at them. This definition has nothing to do with the streamers themselves, though the fact that +100k viewers is relevant.
---
Wow, that sounds like a really good idea!
---
I'm saying exactly the opposite of that. I'm affirming that Blizzard is listening to the community like never before.
---
Sure, but what are you going to do with the gold in beta?
---
Good point.  People would cry hardcore (we wow players are good at that) if high ranking people were found to be exploiting layers.
---
Yeah, I'm still trying to decide whether I'm going to tough it out at launch or wait a while so that I can level in peace.
---
Trying to finish my MSc dissertation before launch, and messing about on pservers a bit.
---
Deadline is 2nd of September, so it's actually quite nice having a bit of extra motivation to finish it earlier.
---
Only after being AQ geared. You can't really even get a complete ele set until ZG is released. Ele was originally my first choice, but I don't want to have to wait until half way through the classic timeline before I can play how I'd like to.
---
Stay salty.
---
IIRC correctly in Classic mages actually have to go to the portal trainer in the city they want to learn the teleport/portal for. In current retail you can go to any portal trainer and learn any teleport/portal for any city.
---
hahaha. I k now.. can't wait to relive that again.
---
Ignore and friends list
---
Okay, that's fair. I played Vanilla late in its life. But yeah, Classic is Patch 1.12, so that makes sense.
---
no mention of smite priest? they are significantly higher dps than shadow priests and there's so much more to them than people realize. As an experienced smite priest, perhaps I could stop by the show and "enlighten" people on the matter?

I was talking about 1.13 in the idea of adding content before the vanilla 1.12.
---
Feral lol
---
Also, not sure if vanilla was this way, but on p-servers the Quel'Danil Lodge in Hinterlands is by far the greatest grinding spot in the game. I grinded there from 42-49 once on a druid. The mobs have almost no armor.  
---
Also, does anyone know if the silithids in Tanaris that gave full exp from their little offspring was a p-server thing or actually on live? You basically got EXP for 3 mobs from killing one. I think it may have just been a p-server bug.
---
Cody switch out of berserker stance ffs this is the third time now.
---
Wolves / owlkins in hinterlands  
---
The northern section of azshara and the beach area in the middle  
---
Harpies / hippogryphs in feralas
---
I think there will be an influx of mages or warlocks if anything.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
I prefer dual spec but with the high barrier to obtain ie: 1000 gold
---
Isn't the Tram way faster than the flight path though?
---
I'm on team "examine everything on a case by case basis and don't use a single generalization to explain how I feel about every single aspect of the game"
---
lol
---
Im just comforted by the fact that I won't burn myself out too early on the beta.
---
The point was new users come here without searching for previously answered/discussed topics
---
I wouldnt use this poll as any sort of real indicator. Hunters are going to be very popular when classic launches.
---
I'm guessing that leading into the temple room caused at least one of them. Maybe one was underwater under the temple?
---
:(
---
Sweet. I'll definitely do that.  Is it worth keeping herb?  I'll be playing a druid if it matters
---
Hi, /u/greenview1
---
I’m not, I wish classic would come out in October or something. It’s not cool to play games when it’s sunny and lots of stuff to do irl and outside
---
Shadowmeld mind control.
---
Yeah the same shit is coming up all the time and it's starting to make people irritable
---
Putting on an audio book while grinding for epic mount is my jam
---
I hate those 10 different versions and some shit achievements you get. 
---
I like TBC version. 
---
All dungeons having hard mode so they are relevant at top level. 
---
And one raid difficulty. 
---
I am not much against hard mode for a raid, if the gear has different look and if some items only drop in hard mode. Just getting 10 ilvl for hard mode is crap.
---
TBH I’m watching a shit ton of anime. I’ve got JoJo’s on Friday, attack on Titan on Sunday, and OPM in Wednesday. It helps have mini stop gaps throughout the week to make the time go by faster. Outside of that, I spend an hour learning hiragana (typically before work) just to make it so I’m not wasting time waiting for a game.
---
I’m also playing around with builds and I’m 100% positive I found a dank ass shadow priest build that will be excellent even in 40 man raids.
---
11int 11spi 26 spell damage is actually pretty good, there aren't many option even at lvl 60 outside raids
---
I should probably take a break and focus my thoughts somewhere else, but my real life is boring as hell. Also, the obsession runs too deep man, it's too stronk
---
Well...the layering right now for each continent I believe is already similar to the original vanilla entire server population cap...
---
So out the gate it would be at LEAST twice the original size...
---
So this seems wrong...
---
About time... jesus.
---
depends how your raid is comped, and it depends how many debuff slots we get at launch tbh. generally debuffs that help the tank stay alive or help multiple people do more damage are going to have priority over one person's dots, but, if there are 16 debuff slots at launch (speculative since the devs said they were starting from 1.12) there's a solid chance a few dots could be fine
---
I am on team preserving the game called World of Warcraft. A game that deserves to be preserved for everyone to enjoy, just like every single player game is.
---
Awesome! I wish I had that luck. All my RL friends are either arguing over which faction/server to be on or pretending they never played WOW but will do it in secret.
---
It's not me flippi g out about the price of something not aimed at me, why would I give a shit about Bentley's 700 dollar umbrella, a 10kusd office chair or a 1000 dollar monitor stand when none of those products are aimed at me?
---
Why the fuck do you even need  have an opinion? Why should anyone care if you think it's too expensive, apple don't because they don't expect you to buy it.
---
I dont own a single apple product - infact I was the one who convinced my boss to allow employees to buy none Apple products as work telephones/laptops/pcs.
---
I just don't understand the outrage about the one of many many many items that are retardedky overpriced and aimed at the professional market. It's like complaining you can't afford to buy the side mirrors for an F1 car because they cost thousands of dollars, they aren't for you and they won't fit your fucking Prius so why the fuck do you care?
---
Which is why I included "with reasonable effort".
---
Since its one of the best slam weps ingame id say warrior prio on alliance side. When it comes to horde enhance sham and warr will usually have the same prio
---
For some its the only Fun they can find in Raiding "old" Content, comparing their speed with others doing the same. The challenge.
---
Thats the case for me.
---
Im on team no changes but can we please have a guild bank lol
---
No changes and 6 hour queues when they remove layering because of they expect player dropoff to be massive.
---
I know right, this is why I loved Vanilla. Every server had these kinds of stories and you had to be a part of it to understand. Every server had famous and infamous people and competition against guilds, factions and other servers were really common.
---
There is really very few level ranges if any at all where pure grinding out performs questing/grind mix in XP/hour. All speed lvlers are mainly questing to 60 because it's faster. Exception being things like mage aoe grinding.
---
Patches/Dates of initial implementation and changes seen here:

https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Meeting_Stone
---
Appreciate the response. Would love to go Dwarf priest honestly, not entirely sold on there character model, but I do love the perks so I may just tough 'er out.
---
Started playing path of exile for the first time ever
---
U sure can but, it has no cool down.
---
Please don't be sad, I didn't mean it like that
---
Also doing a lot of this. Play league, get frustrated, take out frustrations at the gym, repeat...
---
So ready for a fun, slow burn with a more friendly community in classic.
---
What is this "real life" you're talking about?
---
Here's the thing I'm against any QOL changes because something like this might seem a small rebalance to incintivive cross play but what it would really accomplish is greater inflation and stop people from trying to create innovative specs and playstyles  that work for them in both.
---
Play what you like. Racials only matter if you're in the top 5% of guilds. So unless you plan to seek out and push content at the highest level, don't sweat it.
---
how so? 
---
my proposed idea is still a good amount of money to change between only 2 specs and if you want to go outside that you would have to pay even more. and i understand as a hunter that makes sense you would only need one spec for everything but other classes arent so lucky.
---
Some of these posts are 6+ months old. Whats your point?
---
Yeah, I suppose with some useful emissary gear bumps you could probably make it, although I think you got a bit luckier than most.
---
Although I also just now realized you're only talking about 360. I dunno why, I thought you were talking about a higher ilvl than that when I first responded. 360 is doable, but you'd pretty much have to get no overlaps on gear from WQ's and a couple emissaries, like you did.
---
Either way, we agree that it's too easy to gear up on live. Along with the class design, the fact that there's so much high ilvl gear thrown at you is one of the reasons I'm not a fan of BFA. I lose a lot of my incentive to go do dungeons or raids when the gear in there is only a moderate upgrade over what I already have, or in many cases weaker.
---
sphh, it's boe, so everyone rolls regardless if you can use it.
---
Does anyone actually use that zeppelin? It's sloower than just taakinng the FP
---
F interrupt gang rise up.
---
You're way too serious.  The best DPS in my guild was a hunter during TBC.  Hating on hunters is an old vanilla throwback.  We have to do it.  It takes joy outta the game if we don't!
---
Is LOTRO any good? I played it when it first came out and couldn't get past the bugs; wasn't even aware it still existed.
---
Darkspear was a sleepy little server, but we had Swifty. Always had fun trying to gank him.
---
I remember my best mate who was a rogue used to do this, message rogues from top guilds who farmed content and ranks for advice and most of the time they were happy to share their class craft.
---
I slid my movement keys over to ESDF, but removed E from movement. I run with the mouse and also have side keys on the mouse that are bound to strafe/backwards movement. I also have my alt/shift/ctrl keys bound to the side keys as well.
---
i use QWERTY for the main attacks, Alt +QWERTY for extras, 1-6 for specials, and A,G,Z,X,V available too.
---
Durotar music is amazing
---
They either add content for the small % of players who will clear naxx or add catch-up there is no in between.   
---
Classic ended when it did for a reason, there was big gap between 60 and naxx raiders it needed a reset, tbc is a better reset than anything they can do, it’s just not possible.
---
Undead arent people
---
is best answer
---
Oh c'mon! You don't love those dwarven models?
---
 "Interest ya on a pint?"
---
If you give your female dwarf pigtails they spin while casting !! 
---
Tbh we might have to have a duel now just for your blasphemous remarks about my dwarven brothers  and sisters!
---
We dont know
---
We are not clairvoyant
---
They were in a 5 man group in RFD. The sword dropped. Everyone in the group rolled need. Shaman won it. Tank of the group nearly lost his mind about a shaman needing a sword.
---
No changes. For two reasons :
---
1. Many changes seem small but have the potential to upset the game balance. Dual spec for example seems like a small change but has massive impact on class distribution (for good or bad).
---
2. (this was raised even when Classic was first announced) ANY change opens the door to ALL changes. And before you know it we're back at Cata.
---
Lay off the twitch bro.
---
I think this discussion isn't worth having until way into the future. Like Classic isn't even out yet, let's play that and as we near its end we can discuss what comes next.
---
Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month at the start of Classic WoW, in order to balance the huge influx of players in the same zones. Once the situation reaches a controlled state, it will be completely disabled and realms will once more have one instance of themselves. Layering also will not happen after Phase 1, the importance of that being that Phase 2 is planned to introduce the World Boss Kazzak, with the Green Dragons being released later on, both of which would make layering a tool to disrupt the flow of World Bosses in Classic.
---
Straight from wowhead. Absolute zero need for a god damn layering solution. You understand that layering will contain enough people for you to feel like you’re playing with enough people, right? Look at the streamers, they have a vibrant community in the BETA! Jesus Christ, layering is not going to be the death of classic because it will be out for a few months at the latest. There’s nothing to fix. Absolutely nothing.
---
Its gunna depend on the game and the people in it, but usually once the initial zerg is wiped and loses momentum its much harder to form back up and get another push going.
---
3 million is the best of those bets imo, for the first month-ish.
---
Tons of people will play, even a lot of current retail players with an active sub will try it cuz it's free.
---
Helm from Ony. :)
---
&gt; We could use a sticky post about banning this subject untill classic releases.
---
I'd sign that petition.
---
So here is the thing about vanilla and classic, there is not usually a huge difference in talents between, raid spec, world grinding spec, dungeon spec, and pvp spec, as such unless you care about what is often a \~&lt;1% difference in potential than stay in raid spec. 
---
It's also completely possible to raid with a non-traditional raiding spec either. I distinctly remember we had a priest healer that raided 100% of the time in his Shadow PVP spec and had no problems.
---
I don't know.  I like trash talking private server scum, reminiscing about Vanilla, beating some rationalization into people, but I want no part of the beta.  When I level in Classic I want it to feel fresh and permanent.
---
All about the state of mind bro
---
This is why I'm not upset that I can't play the beta. These streamers are making insane hours and once Classic launches they're going to have to do that stuff all over again. Some of them are going to burn out quickly for sure
---
lol, just to be clear I'm not saying you can't win. I just saying people that play 8+ hours a day. Aren't going to be easy sauce. Can honestly say. I plan on streaming classic myself. I've been told by all my friends I should be doing it my whole life but, to be honest I don't like video games. 
---
Now I'm at the point where I plan on streaming because I wanna be able to justify to myself about how I'm playing 8+ hours a day lol. Super happy to have a brother whose going to be as addicted as me. So my warrior gets a shaman partner to 60. I'm so hype for this I can barely contain it lol.
---
In theory, yes. But it often doesn't work out like that, especially on a fresh server. The questing zones are often packed of people fighting for the same mobs, as they all need them fore their quests. In these cases, you're often going to be way better off if you just find yourself a quieter little grinding spot.
---
&gt; Oh, but you didn't think the 1.12.1 talents and itemization + 16 slot debuff cap already reduces the "challenge of the game" significantly?    
---
I do, and I'm very sad about it. Classic is currently too easy. Which is exactly why I don't support making it even easier yet still.       
---
&gt; but then they should also allow part of the PvP game to be present at launch as well imo.   
---
Maybe. But I'm not sure how that would work in practice. For example, you cannot have the existing rewards (too OP), so they'd either need to offer no rewards (?) or new worse ones (and they'd get hit with "NOCHANGES" complaints for introducing new rewards).    
---
&gt; What about the PvP players "social problems" if their favorite part of the game is delayed by months?   
---
As far as I understand PvP will be in the game at launch. The rewards won't however. So you can PvP, you just won't get a title for it.
---
BlackwingLair was my first server during classic. We were an interesting server because we were created less then a year before BC came out. A lot of the players that rolled on BWL were already experienced and were rolling alts. This made it pretty interesting because there were no legendariesfor a while. Infact I think if I remember correctly once the 6 month mark hit and they allowed transfers on BWL thats when we got the first person with hammer of rag.
---
DBM was definitely around and used during classic. It was mostly for timers - which weren't always timers to let you know when something was going to happen but more when it could happen.
---
I remember a lot of raid guilds required DBM, mine certainly did. AQ40 and Naxx are still two of the hardest raiding tiers in all of WoW, even with the use of this addon.
---
5% rocket league 95% consuming classic wow content. Videos streams this sub.
---
I did not down vote anything.
---
Why? What if I dont care about BiS gear?
---
Yeah, great idea. Like a "FAQ" or "Frequently discussed topics" megathread.
---
Links to /r/classicwowplus
---
Perhaps even a labelled paragraph on each class with reputable YouTube videos containing levelling info, talents etc.
---
Would take a lot of work for admins, but if this Reddit keeps growing at the rate it is, especially getting closer to release, it will save time in the long run I reckon!
---
10 gold per switch would just encourage people to play those things more though. i would imagine people would switch way more often and roughly the same amount of golde would be drained from the game. if someone were to propose dual speccing with no cost to switch i could understand your viewpoint but simply reducing the cost isnt the same thing.
---
Basically this.
---
There will be but he will have nightfall not sulfuras.
---
&gt;90% will run back to retail after an hour? Absolutely wrong.
---
You underestimate the power of casual my friend.  People hunger for the nostalgia, not the hardcore experience.  There is a reason why casual mmos exploded the market while every single hardcore mmo failed miserably.
---
Depends on the person. I was a Warlock that did a lot of pvp and some pve. I'd respec for raids but only if Iknew it was going to be a decent run. I had a golf farming spec I'd switch into and keep until I hit a certain amount of gold. Then I'd swap to pvp or raiding.
---
If someone really wanted me to raid and I didn't want to, I'd tell them I'd come if they paid or I could stay my normal spec. Often they'd pay. I was pretty decked out though, so they'd often want me in my raid spec.
---
On a serious note, it's good that some enjoyed that one.
---
I remember almost every time in the first few seconds, someone would nope out.
---
Lmfao this guy
---
This video is so funny like I don't speak a lick of Spanish, especially not a Basque variation where the guys speaking 100000 mph and crying laughing in between words, but it's still fuckin hilarious
---
Amazing how laughing like this can just be contagious, you don't even need to know what was so funny
---
It's a joke because it gets posted a lot.... 
---
The searching was not so easy because of the different headlines, if you want to search for yourself try out:
---
* 1.13
---
* Whats after naxx
---
* Classic +
---
* Whats next
---
That's the spirit!
---
WC3, second Red Dead 2 run, checking this sub and logging into battle.net 14 times a day... and sometimes a good hard cry.
---
But this is supposedly just at launch, would that mean blizzard is selling more tickets than the server has seats?
---
Yeah if I ever got into the beta i'd prob play a class I wasn't intending on playing in live just to keep it fresh.
---
Oh, this was just amazing.  Well done!
---
Yes would be quite helpful and could clean up the sub as well
---
You probably got into beta
---
Btw todays count is at 6
---
You can browse through /new and count for yourself :)
---
 [/r/classicwowplus](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/)
---
I havent heard of that , do you have a link
---
I’m surprised so many people want beta access so bad, I’d rather just wait a couple months than start now to have my progress wiped.  Watching streams and videos has me content for now while I still plan out my race/class/professions and what not
---
I’m considering waiting for the off hours the first day, and then start there
---
Most of the people who plays at that time, are very likely to be hardcore enough to have started earlier, so they are out of the first 1-2 zones by that time, and few people are likely to start at that time, so starting zones are probably more open
---
Just a thought, dunno what I think by the time Classic finally releases
---
Hunter walks into a bar.... BAM he's opened on by a rogue and killed in 5 seconds because he has no room to kite.
---
:P
---
You're a gem. Thanks.
---
Everyone is so "TF TO TANK!!" here, as if every guild has infinite amount of *reliable, dedicated and loyal* tanks.
---
To answer the OP, since TF is an offhand, I think most of the DPS increase comes from the proc damage. The procrate in 1.12 is 10% I believe..? Now multiply the damage by average proc per second and gg. 
---
Can account for the white offhand hits too of course.
---
It wasnt always emperor , i dont know when the change was introduced but i also remember it beeing droped by the general.
---
dont take it to seriously its just been asked at least 5 times in the last two hours or so and people are very tired of it as you witnessed
---
A good 40% of my day is spent thinking about which class to play.
---
Thats why they made layering. :)
---
Yeah I can easily ignore them, but I can definitely sense frustrations building from users when there's the same topics/questions every 20 mins.
---
There could be just 1 FAQ stickied thread, and when we see repeated questions, we as a community could send the new users to this stickied thread that will no doubt cover any and all questions they have about classic.
---
On the flip side. My BFD group got to the trash before Kelris and we wiped because our tank face pulled. The healer and one dps left immediately. After shouting in guild and world chat for about 30 min we decided that it wasn’t going to happen. Not all things end happily in this version of wow because there are still selfish players who expect no wipes ever. Hopefully they don’t make it to 60 but I know at least some will.
---
Most of the time pure grinding is straight up worse xp/hour than quest/grind mix though. All speed lvlers are mainly questing to 60 because it's faster. Exception being things like mage aoe grinding.
---
Don't worry about it. I am sure i will find something to do while we wait...
---
I only killed him 4 times before naxx opened as due to classic the content schedule was sped up. Have aq40 and spider wing tonight then whatever else of naxx we can do on Sunday.
---
The most ridiculous part is that I almost play casually. 2 days of raiding (I no longer need bwl) and 1-2 days of farming/herbing but if not no biggy. Guild are good at providing things if needed. It's the only game I play so I don't compromise on work or friends at all.
---
This is how you use memes properly. You take them and put an own twist to it.
---
&gt;Maybe. But I'm not sure how that would work in practice. For example, you cannot have the existing rewards (too OP), so they'd either need to offer no rewards (?)
---
I think this could be solved if Blizzard to do pre- 1.12.1 itemization which is what Nost did, where for instance there is no hit chance in the game for casters, so they are way weaker than they are in 1.12.1 or something.
---
And yes, some of the PvP gear is pre-raid BIS, and the rank 13/14 gear is obviously quite OP. But these items are nowhere near free, and takes weeks or months to grind, so if some people want to bust their balls of and no-life for a period to obtain these items, then let them.
---
And I am not even a massive PvPer, I just like it mostly while lvling and if you don't have those rewards while lvling its a big bummer for me, because I probably won't lvl and alt and experience it with the system.
---
&gt;and they'd get hit with "NOCHANGES" complaints for introducing new rewards)
---
We are way beyond \#Nochanges already, I just want them to make the game as good as possible as its already a custom version of 1.12.1
---
&gt;As far as I understand PvP will be in the game at launch. The rewards won't however. So you can PvP, you just won't get a title for it.
---
Yeah, I will still shit on kids trying to steal my mobs etc, its just a shame without the bonus reward for murdering them.
---
there's thousands of players that hop to the next server when a fresh one launches, a lot of people on pservers have played on multiple servers. 
---
I'm not part of the former, but the latter I am, have played maybe 5 servers over the years, mostly just leveling while listening to audiobooks or podcasts, but also sometimes ranking and raiding. 
---
It never will get boring to me, or at least only for a year, then I don't have a good game to play and I come back hehe
---
Mass Dispell?  lol. It seems like you know heck of a lot more about retail than I do.  last time i really played was early TBC after Kara then I burnt out.  
---
You guys really have 0 idea how watered down 1.12 is.  Not in terms of difficulty but in terms of time taken.
---
I'm on team No Changes for Classic, simply because a clean starting point is needed. But from that point on, I find "No Changes" to be... less than thoughtful. If we remain "No Changes", and if content is added, we'll end up right where the call for "Back to the roots, no changes!" became so deafening that Blizzard *actually heard it*.
---
So, since Classic - No Changes is already established, I'm all for carefully examining the trajectory and impact every additional design decision had on the game. WoW is a pretty unique case here, since they already implemented all the changes that led to BfA, and thus, has some benefit of hindsight of what to hopefully avoid. With that knowledge, and a strong set of design principles they hopefully derived from going back to the roots, I would not mind re-examining any addition to Classic before putting something "back" in. I'm all for changes from the road that led to WotLK and beyond (and of which a few bricks even TBC already laid).
---
Shadow Mastery only increases the base damage of Shadow Bolt though, while DS gives Shadow Bolt a flat 15% damage increase and therefor scales with SP. Big difference
---
42
---
Yeah and someone told me that There isn’t really any great ele gear until ZG or later so would have to wait for updates for months to reach its full potential
---
I’m browsing reddit on the toilet during my break from the 16h shift, I’m gonna be 27 in december. This is not what i needed to read brother
---
That one's pretty good actually (and true as well)
---
Interesting :)
---
It sounded like an ability or spell rather than a trinket, thank you for clarifying
---
Adding more content to Classic is the move my heart wants to make, but wants and wishes are often wrong.  Blizzard would have to create Classic servers that exist in 1.12 forever, and then make more that move past 1.12, since the entire point is preservation.  There's only so much real estate in Azeroth before we need to add another continent.
---
My personal selfish opinion is that Blizzard should take class and raid design from TBC and incorporate it into the old world, add new zones, new quests, more content.  But, my vision, and your vision, and everyone else's vision will not be the product we receive.  The only thing I know for certain is that I want Classic as it is.
---
Hillsbrad for sure. In the yeti cave specifically 😆
---
I dont think the obsolete argument is a very good one. You can easily ensure that every content has something that makes revisiting worth your time. The actual problem is scaling / power creep. The difference in power between naxx and dungeon/MC gear is absurd. It never was that big of a problem in Vanilla because so few people had that gear.
---
Is there any plans for server transfers/name/faction changes? Will probably miss the launch and have friends scattered around different servers.
---
True, fresh launch changes things. Though even then, i'd say it's always optimal to do at least some quests, the type where you aren't competing much/at all with other players. And on fresh the grinding spots will often be highly contested as well.
---
I haven't, and won't, because I don't get conned.  Suckers.
---
#But what if Blizzard released 1.13 though? &gt;!/s!&lt;
---
Enjoy the ride while it lasts. Everything dies. Nothing lasts forever. Stop worrying about the longevity of classic and just enjoy it for what it is.
---
Shattered Hand
---
Multiple World First raid boss kills including Nefarian by Drama. The server was unplayable when they hung the head up in Stormwind because so many people from other servers were rolling lvl 1 alts to come look.
---
Was also the original home of Death and Taxes and home to multiple world class guilds throughout Vanilla.
---
Was the home of Skyfang with Jubei, world first Hand of Rag.
---
I was a gnome warlock on Daggerspine - US.
---
Best known for having a feral druid, Kuroma, who held rank 14 for like a year. Rumoured to be multiple people playing the same character because of how no-life he was, constantly doing BGs. He would never speak to anyone but his priest, Angheuol.
---
Also we had a horde guild who was undefeated in WSG before crossrealms.
---
I miss dear old Laggerspine
---
Leave us to our hunter hating ways and join the fun.  Level a mage!  Imagine all the ice block fun!
---
Some number of item drops will be delayed as well. Also some crafts.
---
Don't underestimate the power of chain heal rank 1.
---
I had 3 60's in vanilla and only had one BoE epic drop ever...
---
I'd probably be on that band wagon as well but ill probably treat it more like summit is treating it. Play every class to about 20 so i can make a better decision as to what i want to play. I only played pally and rogue in vanilla.
---
I miss the days of yore when AV used to last for days... goto bed and get up and the same AV would still be going... 
---
That shit was awesome and was like a real war was going on and you really got to know the people on your server back then really good because of this.
---
&gt;Reply
---
Seems the most accurate IMO. This is pretty much in line with the census on P servers.
---
I started playing in 2005, I did not sub to BFA for a "chance" of getting selected to the Beta, but I understand the humor. It's sad that Cata babies with active subs are in the classic Beta while experienced Vanilla players aren't there.
---
I've opted into the beta, but have no intention to subscribe to a game I don't like for a small chance of getting the beta, its  probably a good thing in the end as well so I don't get burned out before release.
---
there is an intrinsic reward my friend
---
I guess it's more of a what type of changes do you think could be good 
---
So you arent on no changes but would you be ok with whole new content or tbc? Or you dont care specifically but just want it to be good.
---
Besides working and other hobbies?
---
In retail I'm leveling a Zandalari Troll Paladin. Because Trolls are my favorite race, and I love dinosaurs, and being a paladin that draws his light from dinosaur spirit gods makes me giddy.
---
That dude put out a ton of content. Ah, the college years nostalgia.

You remember wrong then. Summon on meeting stones is a TBC feature.
---
&gt; Classic running on 7.3.5 client.
---
It's on the 8.0 db client right now.
---
Western and eastern plague lands. Love the atmosphere of the dilapidated zombie stricken farm folk, plus it’s always full of both factions.
---
Every race at level 1 has their city's flightmaster discovered. Tauren get Thunder Bluff, UD get Undercity and Orc/Troll get Orgrimmar.
---
Past this you need to get flight paths. The quests you mention do send you to cities and back, but the quest sends Tauren to TB and Orc/Troll to OG.
---
So we should play together, but not be grouped?
---
Conned into subbing for the small chance at betting into the beta?
---
That might be right, i remember farming him back in the day, but that could have been after vanilla. Anyway, it's a cheaper and great alternative for those who want to see big hits. You can enchant it with crusader as well.
---
I could be wrong but I don't think it stacks
---
On that case I'd be on team "let's wait and see what we have with classic before we worry about what comes after classic"
---
Name is a work in progress
---
A lot of the reason to do most dungeons (especially at end game) is gear. You will end up running EG Dungeons a lot if you keep playing the game. I can't imagine you will still like Scholomance after the 10th time you have run it.
---
This extends to some raiding as well. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think MC is fun. And it's definitely not fun after the 10th time you have run it. The reasons to do it:
---
1. Fuck around with 40 other friends
---
2. Gear
---
Because getting gear is fun. Using that gear to pwn noobs is even more fun. If you don't like getting gear from dungeons, I predict you will burn out pretty quick.
---
STV is where the best of times were had.  A four hour war between my guild and horde guild broke out all because my girlfriend was ganked three times.  So 40 people in full tier 2 were going at it all across those green hills.
---
If I play 10 hours a day and follow joana's guide how long would it take to level to max?
---
I do love Gadgetzan. Just people waiting just out of the guards aggro range waiting to gank someone. And the arena in the middle was ridiculous on some days.
---
Those guards dont fuck around either even as a druid I have difficulty escaping because of their nets.
---
So...couple of things. 
---
Server technology is SIGNIFICANTLY better now than in 2004. Population limits were put in place due to literal hardware constraints. 
---
Most of the devs have stated it’s likely there will be higher populations than in the original game.  So this whole #nochanges bullshit when it comes to every little thing is already out of whack so I wish people would stfu about that already. 
---
Additionally, layering caps and tuning is definitely not finished. It’s possible they could raise or lower it. I believe on the stress test it was around 3000 per layer per continent. 
---
Blizzards line of thinking is probably pretty simple - huge portions of people will not make it past level 20 (they’ll just realize classic is not for them) - you’ll have your regular burn outs over the first month or two. I’m guessing blizzard is erroring on the side of caution and betting for larger, over populated servers being the issue they’d rather solve (free realm transfers) than dead servers they have to completely migrate.
---
I'm a bit weird as in I prefer to defend in world pvp than to attack so for me it's Red Ridge I have a thing for killing (or trying) lvl 60 hordes that camp our lewbies there
---
It's annoying but it's really not that bad tbh. I played a druid for 70 levels and it was never more than a minor annoyance
---
False dichotomy. The Devs are awesome, and that awesomeness is because they decided to make it as it was and not change or add to it whenever possible.
---
Why sad? It's a hunter weapon.
---
Yes.
---
Also watching 5-6 twitch streams at the same time while leveling on a private server. The pain is real.
---
BTW the version number of the Classic WoW Beta client is 1.13. So we would possibly be talking about 1.13.X or 1.14 for additional content.
---
Here is part you are missing and we will use this quote:
---
"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."
---
Expanding on classic won't be profitable in the long run.  And lets say that by some miracle that Classic beats out Retail in popularity... that means blizzard makes less money.  Because that means less people are buying boost, mounts, pets, etc.  It means people aren't interested in expansions so less sales there as well.
---
So then if there is no one to spend on the store on retail... guess what happens?  The store comes to Classic.
---
So whereas they are able to continue adding meaningful new content without killing the game, IF Classic becomes big enough to warrant new content, there will new features added that people will hate as well.  Bottomline is always money.  Activision isn't a gaming company, its a stock.  And the stock always wins above all else.
---
Took me to long to click lol
---
The hype train is real. Can't wait to see you in bgs!
---
It’s not even a joke that 90% of hunters are retarded, i’ve seen so much retarded shit from Hunters its not even funny, there is however a few good omes that really stand out, shoutout to Barki at LH u are a boss man
---
I mean the answer is crystal clear right?
---
Release Classic, let it go through it's content cycle, do the same for BC as separate servers to keep eternal classic servers. Then after Sunwell do Wrath of the Lich King.
---
Rebrand the rerelease as the "WoW Trilogy" and sell special editions that unlock all the old special edition stuff.
---
Absolute maximum return on investment for minimal work. BC and WOTLK private servers already prove the audience.
---
Developing new 1.13 content is a nice thought, but is orders of magnitude more work than continuing the remaster process, which that team is now trained up in.
---
They didn’t really care because they weren’t doing anything anyways I suppose.
---
I dont think double hunter is good for endgame stuff, unless you dont care as much for endgame.
---
I know its like groundhogs day round here lol
---
And for all the Paladins out there, don't forget to macro some long /y screed about the Light and smiting evil and all that jazz to EVERY ABILITY.
---
&gt; If I play Classic and for example - Warriors don’t become the dominant force with full tier gear, I will personally feel cheated by Blizzard.
---
See, this is the part that doesn't sit right to me. In real Vanilla, we had no idea Warriors would become a #1 DPS class, #1 PvP class, and honestly everyone assumed the entire time that actually would NOT happen since they weren't one of the "pures". In 2004 you figured every class and spec would have it's own strengths and weaknesses, but that none would be objectively the best. This was all based on Blizzard's great track record in Warcraft 3 where all of the Heroes were very well balanced.
---
Not a single person in Nov 2004 chose a Warrior with this mentality here that they would feel personally cheated by Blizzard if they weren't the top dog in the game.
---
In an MMO you really aren't supposed to know with 100% certainty what the final metagame is. It's bad for the spirit of the game and really takes a dump on player choice and the RPG aspect.
---
&gt;the people asking for balance changes IMO don’t want to play Vanilla
---
Vanilla was all about balance changes, that's really where I'm coming from on all this. Every month or two there was a small or major patch, sometimes doing full class overhauls and redesigns. The meta was always changing and shifting. That's healthy for an MMO. We really shouldn't be playing one single arbitrary patch, frozen forever in time.
---
I agree with you that the player base will drop off sharply after release (like 99% of games), but I also think there will be a decent amount of people who will stick around for a while that have long quit WoW or never tried it in the glory days. There’s just something about the grind of these Old a school MMORPGs that make them extra rewarding. Personally, I have played vanilla, BC, and WoD...I was turned off by a lot of things in WoD (LFR, easy mode dungeons, easily attainable raid level gear, etc. and I didn’t  really stick around for more than a few months.
---
Despite my general lack of interest in WoW the last decade or so, I am very hyped for Classic (even though I know firsthand about  all the inconveniences in the game) and intend on sticking around for the endgame content I couldn’t see back in Vanilla.  I would be even more hyped for a TBC server  if that happens. I think There is a real possibility that classic wow will reinvigorate the entire franchise,
---
Haha I agree on the fire part. My guild had maybe 10-15 people that knew what to do. The rest was additional dps till they died :)
---
Just for like a few years. Then classic classic will release.
---
Make Mine a Noggenfogger!
---
I bring up streamers because they shouldn't get special treatment. The average joe dueling and having a third party jump around them isn't going to attract attention.
---
It's specifically because streamers made a high profile event that got their community rabidly demanding GM attention.
---
And that's really the problem with streamers: their community. Streamers give up advantages by giving away their location. It's a choice they make.
---
They shouldn't get a GM team devoted to giving them special treatment because their massive fanbase cries.
---
I watch streamers too, doesn't mean I think they should be playing under special rules.
---
My favorite part was the we don’t even do anything anymore part lol. So accurate nothing but minor fixes and story content that they call content filled patches.
---
Problem with GS in classic is ilevel doesn't necessarily correlate to strong items.  For example, dungeon blues are better than a lot of T1 items.
---
for me, it a win win mentality 
---
on the other hand i’m grinding but i’m getting xp to then learn new spells and talents 
---
plus i’m getting money to then buy strong equip
---
wow vanilla seemed to understand how to make grinding fun and not a chore
---
No save yourself from wow until launch, it will be worth it
---
Yeah, I agree :) As I said in my comment further up, I think the best route is a combination of the two
---
I like free exp :D
---
Sticking with the new.
---
its helps that it actually gives decent xp. in retail mobs give shit xp so it’s only worth it complete quests / bosses
---
Google retro wow dl there and play whatever server u want
---
Man if only there were people other than streamers in the beta /s
---
Nope cause I got no time to play it.  I will likely resub for a money just for the nostalgia thing... but I will be out after that.
---
No no... Wait til you start making RANK 3 water...
---
Two years since I've been at least lurking on reddit, and this is the first time I've seen people analyze a meme. And I'm here for it, boys. Carry on.
---
Yeah warlock and priest have been suggested as very smart picks in every what should I play thread on this sub for a while.  I like to think people who come here are upper end of casual to streamer/pro raider level and the desire to play a useful fun and potentially different class is going to higher in this group vs people who are aware its coming back and might look into when its out.  
---
I think the first few months of classic will have slightly different representation when compared to vanilla, but still in the order you laid out.  Strong dps like rogues and mages will be popular to everyone where tank/heals and support type can be strong and useful but maybe not as fun in pvp or top of any meter.
---
Ashenvale for sure, because that's when shit gets real for the first time.  I have a ton of memories of my friends and I fighting the horde at their FP near the shore.  Back and forth beatdowns, wasting tons of time but having a blast basically barricading them to their camp.  Good times.
---
wPvP ranking is going to be pure cancer. I already see groups of Horde slaughtering stuff in e.g. UnGoro, while Alliance ranking heroes clear e.g. Searing Gorge. They'll of course avoid each other to get more honor per time.
---
On the other hand, I as well 'd be glad to get some ranks while leveling, but it'll have to wait for until I roll an alt.
---
omg, there's always a cult to suck Blizzard's balls.   Don't worry, we hadn't forgotten about you.
---
Good work. My personal favorite AH addon.
---
Depents, if you are planning on rerolling skinning later on to Alchemy I would look up an alchemie leveling guide and keep all the herbs you need to level. Extra's can be given to friends, guildies on sold on the AH.
---
I couldn't disagree more.
---
Flying mounts suck cock, Paladins ought to be Alliance, Shamans ought to be Horde. Draenei need not exist, and Elves should never ever have been Horde. 
---
What's the point of factions even if they are the fucking same? 
---
And making Hybrids as good as pure classes is terrible, too. Having support classes is just fine. If a Shaman can't dps or heal as well as a Rogue or Priest, that's fine. Shamans have stronger buffs and more utility.
---
Haven't Blizzard themselves advises against subbing just for the chance of getting into the beta, because there's very small chance that you'll actually get in?
---
Leveled a mage to 60 on a pserver... never doing that again haha (Drinking Simulator 2019)
---
I don't drink soda because I don't want to be a fat ass so... I don't care what they do?
---
The warlock in that video is demonology specced. If the warlock was affliciton spec, he would have taken 20% more damage due to lack of SL, his shield would have been -30% in effectiveness, allowing me to not be rage starved, his healthstone would have healed for 30% less, and so on. I would have completely rolled over him.
---
So what I'm asking of you is imagine if that warlock was a good player: all those wasted fears, not using fel domination, no engineering etc. The cards are completely stacked in the Warlock's favor. The only chance the warrior has is recklessness, which he doesn't obtain until 50.
---
By some polls I have seen shamans will be the most common class. Take any number and double it and that is the number you should compare to the other classes. Paladins and Shamans are incredibly versatile so would expect strong representation.
---
Idk what he said as it got deleted, but blizz basically confirmed it's only people on FF lists at this point. they definitely are still putting out invites though, seemingly not to randoms though :(
---
*Cries in random*
---
watching kargoz and playing sea of thieves
---
So fucking true xD
---
Man, you're going to burn out before the game is launched. Look once a week until mid august.
---
Awesome, thanks that eased my mind. I doubt ill reach that level (mainly due to time constraints) So I'll likely go Human :)
---
Hi, /u/MrKrazyKarl
---
Correct, teleport at 24 I think? 
---
Teleport alone is sooo nice can just leave your hearth in kinda obscure spots to avoid flight paths
---
Or people will start rerolling Hunters and Frost Mages to kill said Rogues :D
---
I'm replaying to 20 on pserver just to make sure that grinding mobs is something I am excited for and over the past couple days I have enjoyed it immensely but I have no intention to pay 15$ to enter a lottery
---
Planing BC now is basically planning what you are going to play in 3 years.

---
I think your memory is probably correct! [Classic Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=11815/hand-of-justice#comments:id=3036552) has multiple comments implying that it’s a General drop. Seems like it may have been moved around 1.10.

Vanilla friend finder (http://vanillafriends.com/) is listed in our [Community Resources &amp; Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/discords) page. We don't remove threads to redirect, however. In reality, as someone who goes through *all the threads submitted ever* there aren't many posts like this, but they are very similar so they seem like they pop up a lot. 
---
&gt; are there more beta invites
---
This is covered in our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow), and we tend to remove these and redirect to the FAQ. The FAQ is listed in the sidebar, for anyone wondering. 
---
&gt; comparing pserver stats to live beta
---
This is typically fine, unless obviously it's comparing a custom server or some such. 
---
A lot of these get removed as reposts, and we do miss some things, typically because in these situations we prefer to not remove things (if conflicted), unlike for example situations involving Rule 2, 3, 4, or 5, where we remove it if we're conflicted (rather than leave it up). 
---
The biggest thing you can do to help is report them, and be specific - using the other field is the most helpful option. If you report it with a generic "It's targeted harassment at me" and it is clearly not targeted harassment, 99% of the time it'll get re-approved and someone will tick 'Ignore Reports' (meaning no further reports will notify us) - this goes double for threads that inappropriately attract reports such as "what happens after Naxx" posts, or any post that proposes any form of changes. You can also modmail, if you want to be really specific - we try to answer all modmails, but some do slip through the net. We're working on improving in that regard.
---
I also do that with the Blizzard client to see if I have received the beta. No progress at the moment.
---
I always found it best to start slow. And for fucks sake learn how to run right if you're not familiar with it. I saw so many people in the military that wouldn't run correctly just because they were too lazy. AND THEY WERE TAUGHT HOW. It will make or break running for you. It's like pulling a boss with no raid buffs or consumables. Makes it that much harder. Running actually gets fun if you do it optimally.
---
I resubbed for the first time since 08 and got in, great sucess
---
/hot is /new's 9gag
---
Never played end game classic as i was around level 30 when bc came out on my huntard. Ive always either tanked or played huntard since then so i want to do a caster this time around. I love pve and pvp equally and plan on doing pretty much everything under the sun and am stuck between playing a warlock and a priest at the moment. I have very little experience with playing both of the classes and also want to play something in classic that their arent a billion of. Is disc/holy leveling actually doable? Thinking about eventually getting a weapon like benediction really makes me interested in the priest as well as being invited to groups easily. Also with warlocks i love the class fantasy and feel like it would be a lot of fun to level but would it be difficult to raid possibly due to debuff limit? I would play undead regardless of the class. Im just looking for one thing to tip me to one side if anyone has anything lol. Thanks
---
&gt; You'll have to constantly prove yourself a good Hunter
---
It's worse than that because *everyone* apparently knows how to play hunters perfectly so you will be constantly berated by others.
---
Melee hunter PvP.  I pulled it off in vanilla, it was crazy fun.
---
&gt;Crendor 
---
Thanks for this.  I've had trouble finding hunter streams and I'd like to see the class in action more. 
---
I've personally been watching Esfand and Venruki mostly and have really enjoyed them.  StaySafeTV is another great Warlock stream, but I mostly don't watch just because I don't have interest in the class.  Sodapoppin can be overly dramatic but he's a damn good druid so I have enjoyed watching him now and again.
---
Got my motorcycle license, thinking about getting a bike now lol. There's always something new to obsess about.
---
Neither was the 16 slot debuff cap, 1.12.1 talents, 1.12.1 itemization, probably not the ST qusts (they will probably be in the game on release, not sure yet tho), Silithus and Winterspring didn't have quests I believe etc etc.
---
The \#nochanges 'argument' is null and void, this classic WoW is a custom version of 1.12.1
---
You realize they can just expand the team right?
---
Ive added several sites mentioning it dropping from angerforge in my edits.
---
Come on now man.
---
Speculating about the obvious path of a companies release schedule is not some kind of weird outlier. It's a very obvious aspect of the conversation.
---
All you are saying right now is that you don't want to talk about the flow of time. Sorry, but we are able to think into the future.

Hunters should stomp all the casters. Just viper sting them and then kite them until they are oom.
---
Depends on how quickly you can get ahead. A lot of people know about his guides, a lot of people will use them. If you are getting away from the pack, with 10 hours a day, it‘s going to take approximately around two weeks, prolly a bit less.
---
Without mentioning 1hand+offhand combos and just comparing staves, there's a [rare staff](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18534) from DM tribute that's better in every way.
---
But DM won't be in phase 1 so it might be the highest SD option for staves til then. It's a shame that plenty more options were added during the scourge event but most likely we won't have access to those til a much later phase if at all.
---
Well, I'm partial to Rogue.  Although it seems the most difficult to play well.  And I suck at PvP, so I'm something of a laughing stock.
---
LOL sounds about right... I am excited to raid but not expecting a "new skill standard" til I actually see it for myself, at least from avg players!
---
I loved this show.
---
This is so obviously wrong. Theres thousands of people in the beta, there arent thousands of streamers. Not even hundreds of streamers. If the server is, let's say 3k people ( considering the biggest guild is already full this is quite likely since it's also the number they want to maintain for each layer on live) even if there are 100 streamers in that's still only less than 4% of the players as streamers. Absolutely absurd to say it's mostly streamers.
---
It's a beta, it's not suppose to be full or even mostly full. They have stress tests for that. They dont owe it to anyone to have a large open beta. And while I dont think they should require a sub, I do think they're entirely within their rights to require a sub and invite as many people as they want.
---
I think it's hilarious the mental gymnastics people perform to justify why they should have beta. Fact is, nothing was promised and no one had any right to expect anything. This isnt even new content, beta is strictly for testing their code, they dont need multiple casual people, they need focused players and streamers provide exactly that. People testing large raids. Questing. Battlegrounds, all under high stress from multiple players.
---
You're not entitled to anything here. If you paid for a sub, you have your sub. That's all.
---
Ive added a few old sources and stuff i could find mentioning HoJ from angerforge.
---
Well this got out of hand! All i suggested was that it wouldnt of been so hard for them to say that majority of the beta testers would only be from the US, it is that simple.
---
Bnet integration is here to stay.  It has an appear offline feature(finally took blizzard long enough to add that).
---
They can't mention every little tweak or else they'd probably be spending more time telling us about their testing tweaks than actually focusing on testing and tweaking the game.

Aha, so it's sacrificing 1.5s of SnD at the start for a good outcome on CP/energy then, thanks for taking the time to reply.

biggest blue balls trying to watch opm yesterday....
---
NA Gurubashi Horde guild &lt;Void&gt; was repeatedly banned and stripped of items for instance cascading, an exploit allowed by the first iteration of instance ID binding. Void would pay an individual from another guild a huge sum of gold to betray their brethren. The betrayer would to zone into Molten Core then invite the Void raiders, allowing Void to clear MC a second time (or third, or fourth) within a single weekly lockout. When the betrayer's guild would zone in to raid, MC would be clear. There were ytmnd's about Void and their shenanigans.
---
After realm transfers began, Gurubashi somehow became a defacto NA spanish-speaking server, and remains so to this day.
---
The thing is, most raids will be cleared within a few hours of release. They don't require much gear and we already know how to run them.
---
What are you going to do in between that?
---
Yeah your right! also dont make a LFG tool either

It really crazy to me that Trillian is now a direct IM program marketed toward businesses now. It almost hurts.

Trillian was so amazing when it was just a sexy ass container program for all the standard IM services at the time.

Yeah that’s pretty stupid

I'd like this, but I use QWE as movement and RTASDFGZXCVB..

Shift is too far for me to use ESDF because I 66kinda use a claw hand placement.

But I dont really tank so I dont have back bound, frees up a really convenient key, gets me to 36 binds with just shift as a modifier

---
It is also very different feedback. Classic feedback is "it doesn't match the old version", which leads to a verification against the reference server, and then they fix Classic to match the reference server (or tell us our memories are incorrect).
---
BfA feedback was "we don't like this". Okay... that is nice... but you can see where there isn't a clear discrete solution to feedback like that. They need to make design decisions, and ceding to popular demand is not always the correct choice for the health of the game. "Blizz caters to casuals" and "Blizz ignores feedback" both get said, but are contradictory.
---
What does this have to do with boredom?
---
Its funny how you retards are fucking triggered with dislikes btw.

HF in retail sitting in bench :)
---
Grinding and watching a movie in the background is a very nice combination to me, if I aim for something I really want with the grind.
---
Not really. I’ve played a mage since Vanilla, and I can tell you first hand that AoE leveling at launch is not viable unless you’re able to get ahead of the pack. It’s hard to get ahead of the pack unless you play for 24-48 hours straight immediately following launch. 
---
Even then, there will be so many people trying to level quickly that there will be lots of competition. Having just one other mage at an AoE grind spot makes it less effective than quest/grind leveling due to mob pack size and respawns.
---
If you don’t believe me, ask the mages in Method about their experiences with AoE grinding on beta.
---
Sorry, male gnome is forever the best.
---
A 2tb HDD costs about $50, a 1tb SSD is only around $100.
---
How many times are we gonna post this?
---
Thank you! I was questioning my sanity there a while
---
Companies put warning labels on addictive products all the time, but those products are still purchased by addicts.  Paying for a chance to get into the beta is nothing more than giving your gambling customer base a fix.  It would have been sufficient to require accounts to opt in to the beta manually.
---
The issue isn't that there are people who would want to grind their pvp items at the start but the issue is that there are a number of guilds that would make this a requirement for PvE early on and they do not want to make that a reality for players. I don't think there is a way to make everyone happy here and they are doing this in a way that they feel will make the least impact to players in the long term. 
---
My assumption for not just including the titles and honor panel outside of the items rewards is that they don't want people to farm the titles or honor lever early on and get the benefit as soon as the PVP system launches in phase 3. I think we can also all agree that resetting the titles and honor at the start of phase 3 would also feel bad for people who had done it. 
---
To you point though about there not being a reward incentive and that detracting from WPVP again I would argue that often the WPVP experience is enough of an incentive to get people to do it. My favorite PVP memories have literally nothing to do with rewards (titles or otherwise) and I think that will carry through into Classic especially for those of us that are rolling on a PVP realm day one. I would also point out the number of people who have such great memories of the 'tarren mill vs southshore' days prior to the PVP honor system. 
---
I would also argue that one of the coolest pvp titles you could ever achieve is just having people know your characters name because of what you have done; in fact to this day I still remember the Human Rogue 'Wambulance' because of this and the number of times I died to their hands in WPVP, as well as how exciting it was when I got the kill on them. This is actually one of the biggest things that has resonated for me from Classic, that in 2004 so much of this game was great regardless of its reward structure, and truthfully that is what I am most excited about for its re-release in August.
---
Ya I may try and join the odd raid, but without any type of dkp system it will be a while until I get a decent shot at any drops once guilds are mostly geared out already. I plan on maining a healer though so I would have an easy time joining a few pugs. I was mainly talking about joining a raiding guild that raids a few nights a week.
---
&gt;I played 3 chars to 60 in vanilla and only seen 1 epic drop in a party in uldaman. Ive seen Some boe epics at 60 tough
---
Hunters and SPriests will succeed the most is my guess.
---
Interesting there is so many skinners but then leather working is at the bottom along with blacksmiths. I guess skinning is easy money while you level though.
---
Locks are going to be insane too.

-New Legendary Ranged Weapon

-Few Class Balance changes

(Being very careful not to powercreep too much in the new raid,zone,dungeon. Add quest chains to revisit old raids: ex: defeat ragnaros in x amount of time/more powerful version of ragnaros to get a new permanent sfx/visual upgrade for an ability or a scroll to add a special fiery glow to a weapon. Collect playable epic/legendary cards from all bosses to add to your collection.)

Never got this in the UK :(

So I'd like it this time please.

Beta servers are layered. Players still don't want to get out into the world with that many other people around because its just not worth the hassle.

Even if they took it out of the Classic client... does it really make a difference when you can just alt-tab and see your friends on the [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher itself?
---
I think it will, but it wont
---
And the whispers... "What boss dropped that?"
---
Hell, I remember when the quest reward for 5-manning Scholo brought all the boys to the the backyard asking where the +spirit staff came from; and when you told them it was a 5-man Scholo, they were floored that you could 5-man Scholo.  To be honest, so was I; but I was bound and determined to become a good player of my class.
---
Yeah, Orgrimmar was the shits.  You'd answer questions and then get on your guild alt to review strats and data if available.  Whispers started as you landed in the mage quarters, and you couldn't hide in the bank.  If you needed an enchant for your new gear, it was "drop whispers, get on alt, get enchantment items, hand to enchanter, get back on main and just be bombarded with whispers.  
---
Or PVP, we would always PVP and get our frustrations out.

Roll protection. Bitches line up to group with you.

Ok buddy
---
What is tanking like in classic? I have the thought of prot warrior but I just imagine dungeons are going to be a nightmare with retail players acting like they are doing MDI while in scarlet monastery. I just want to play standard wow not diablo 3 zerg aoe fest.
---
Thanks for the reply, still wont be able to have totally anonymous AH/bank alts though... I used to farm eye of shadow for gold, would donate it to friends on the benediction quest but after a while the guild kinda saw it as a service i provided free of charge and i just sent them to my bank alt to sell.
---
Explain the  Bottomless Bag Pattern things, sounds hilarious
---
Oh man, I have missed the "its a hunter weapon" memes. Good on you, sir.
---
When you're grouped you can both tag the same mobs and get credit. This is a massive bonus and makes it easier to pull more mobs and kill them as a group, making leveling actually faster. If you're just playing together without grouping you would still be competing for mobs.

I played on both stresstests and it wasn't -that- bad. Got a Nelf and Human to lvl 5 (stresstest#1) and 10 (stresstest#2).
---
Yes it was busy, but not undoable, just group up and get your sniping skills ready. Aven as a caster you can auto attack (bind autoattack) to nearly instantly tag mobs.
---
the only way i can see them doing TBC and not annoying a horde of people is to release a calssic TBC server where you either start at 60 or can import your 60 from the classic server, down side to this is you start to split your player base and then you will get people asking for a classic wrath and split the base even further
---
Its not a raid.  Which just exposes your lack of vanilla experience and why your retail expectation of 90% of people being toxic is exactly the point of this post in the first place.

People will always look for efficiency despite anything.
---
I think it's especially appealing to fans of classic mechanics. There are more active items and things to know/be aware of in Dota compared to other games of the genre.
---
Ha ha yeah memes
---
&gt; those arguments failed
---
Too much a good thing is bad. Just because Classic (and maybe Classic+) can work alongside the running expansion, doesnt meant multiple re-releases will.
---
Man g4 was such a good channel back then.
---
True, but that's not why i was asking, with the [battle.net](https://battle.net) functionality it becomes quite easy to track down what person a certain alt belongs to.
---
Didn't they say no new people would be added anyway? I mean yeah you could stresstest, but meh to that.
---
In pserver I had a goal (mostly because I was poor gold wise) to never get a mount as a druid. I ran around travel form everywhere. It was pretty funny.
---
Then I decided to start herbalism. That was rough. Finally hit 300 herbalism and just farmer away... and after some time I had enough gold to get my regular riding and my epic riding training and mount .

Hi, /u/MalachiJunior
---
I mean I opted in, but do not expect to receive an invite but I am also honest enough with myself to know that if I did get into the beta there is literally nothing that would stop me from playing it. I've been going through withdrawal for 14 years and know that would make no difference if I am giving the chance to relapse.
---
classic life
---
I honestly think that every day when I go on reddit lol
---
Yup.  Most melee as well.  They have a stun now, beastial wrath, flare for rogues.... 
---
Really the only thing I can see beating them is an enhance shaman who resists stuns.  Even still... that pet is going to be wrecking that shaman so he is going to have to close the gap ASAP.
---
Me, dont want to burn out then having it wiped. 
---
I stopped playing wow in 2012 when I had kids. they are now older (7 &amp; 5) so I can play at night. I've not even got myself a good gaming laptop yet, so will do that at the end of July/Start of August in prep! :D
---
do they serve drinks?
---
Nightfall would be better off on a warrjor as the have  instant strikes.
---
Paladins would be the slowest applicant of nightfall
---
on Ely hillsbrad was so much fun, there were constant skirmishes and battles.  STV is the famous one but it does get quite crazy around nesingwary's camp.  I do kinda like the whole thing of approaching stealthily and scoping the situation to see if you can hand in quests though
---
The fun part is trying to pull as many mobs as possible without dying, watching venruki and Ziqo aoe farm together was cool
---
Going to be going Night Elf if that makes any differences. I'm totally OK with using Rhok'delar for a while, its one of my favorite weapons and something I never got the first time around.
---
We'll maybe not the place to ask, but is there a guide for best professions for each class or maybe something that tells you the pros/cons of each profession?
---
I think there is a way to only have people add a certain character to [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) (but I could be mistaken as I haven't played a lot of wow since Cata)
---
&gt;The issue isn't that there are people who would want to grind their pvp items at the start but the issue is that there are a number of guilds that would make this a requirement for PvE early on and they do not want to make that a reality for players.
---
The most hardcore guilds maybe, getting rank 8-10 can take months, so I severely doubt that will be a base requirement for most guilds. AV requirement might be one when that BG is out, but its still way faster to get AV exalted than rank 10.
---
And I will probably grind Cenarion Circle exalted before AQ release for the instant AQ 20 rewards (this also takes a fuckton of time btw), but should Blizz skip the Green dragon boss release patch because it can affect progression in the next content update?
---
and even if, so fucking what? Why does Blizzard need to babysit the playerbase, isn't that what cause BFA in the firstplace? Convenience, instant reward and the entire game being made for the worst players imaginable.
---
&gt;To you point though about there not being a reward incentive and that detracting from WPVP again I would argue that often the WPVP experience is enough of an incentive to get people to do it. 
---
I will still wpvp and feel good about murdering disgusting alliance players, but having the titles and lvling rewards makes it more enjoyable imo, its like the cherry on top.
---
That sounds awesome, thanks! Assuming the best bow to use would be Rhok'delar? Unless there's a bow later in the game that's better.
---
I miss G4's show Portal.
---
There already isnt flying.
---
This is how much i've read from your post
---
&gt;Wrong.
---
Rules do exist in MMOs.
---
because no one said there weren't.
---
Luckily, I have other things that I want to wrap up by August. Time is flying so fast.
---
The real answer
---
What's the add-on that tells you how much spells heal?
---
But that argument is so common that its not easy to tell whether  its suppose to be sarcastic or not.
---
Is there any way to make an addon for classic if I don't have access to the beta?
---
I want a journal addon where I can write and copy the books I read in-game. Its something really niche and I haven't found any addon like that.
---
Don't be silly.
---
to be fair i mained mage in vanilla and played about on warrior as a tank until TBC and pallys were a thing for horde, i'm thinking of going mage again but depending on population and demand for tanks i may go warrior and tanking at 60
---
I did really like the original Heroic dungeons in early BC until they ramped up the rewards and dropped down the difficulty, hated all the Heroic raids.
---
Heroics were implemented as a very hard version of the dungeon once you had decent gear and a very well coordinated group. PuGing a heroic was suicide in early BC. Regular versions of dungeons, as they were in Vanilla, were sort of an easy grind after a while, Heroics gave you a real challenge. Until they changed that challenge into a simple gear requirement and heroics became an absolute joke in WotLK.
---
Raids however, are meant to be the endgame itself, the only version of the raid should be the hardest version, because its the final challenge.
---
I might just have to go through my friends list and purge it :)
---
some people will have over 50 keybinds, basically 1 for all skills including buffs, food/drink, mounting, consumables etc
---
Keep in mind though, at higher ranks purge removes two debuffs, not just one. So eventually you won’t be able to keep up if he is spamming
---
It's a scam if you sent a check to those companies with the hopes that they might, maybe, could be send you something for your money.  Those vices risk your health, Blizzard is exploiting hope.
---
Amazing that you narrowed it down to one weapon given that the available pool to choose from was "every weapon in the game."
---
Silithus and the absolute blood bath that is going to occur at the gong.
---
I would really love to use Rhok'delar, I think its one of the coolest weapons ever. I know there probably will be a good deal of competition to get it considering Hunter will be one of the most popular classes, but I'll manage. I'm not planning on going crazy in PvP but sounds like I should be OK there as well. Thanks for the response!
---
I have a list of about 900 items that will vary in price based on the phase we're in and how long the game's been out, mostly thanks to old Auctioneer data from Vanilla, but also some Pserver data.
---
No no no, level 40 grind in SM is peak Warcraft.
---
i want a switch that can toggle new models and hd textures. thats all, if somebody dont want to see it, soo can paly on classic mode. it will be the best solution.
---
Not counting the epic BoE weapons, the Jackhammer ([http://classicdb.ch/?item=9423](http://classicdb.ch/?item=9423))  is probably Bis for sustained dps at level 40. Although it probably isnt the preferred weapon in PvP since slow weapons are better in most scenarios. It should be good for druids though, and shamans when facing other melee classes (fish for procs and switch to a slower weapon?).
---
It’s not something to deal with. Just let them play whatever they want.
---
They serve cookies.
---
I'm OK with that. Thanks for the response!
---
For future reference most arguments don't have bla blabla in them.
---
Rubix' Force of Nature 3 has a special place in my heart.
---
Aw tyty
---
Interrupts on R for me, slows on Q, defensives of F, short combat buffs on E
---
I have no friends that play wow :(
---
But personally I love healing. Feels much more rewarding to me in a raid than just being one out of 30 damage dealers.
---
The druid and shaman are in for a rude awakening at 60
---
I suggest joining a guild personally
---
Don't all classes have something at 10, 20, 30 and 40?
---
make the lowbies walk! There's line ONE lv 20 Thunderlizard that MIGHT kill you.
---
Builds character.
---
Yeah Hand of Rag and Atiesh were tied for second
---
Thanks. I'll see if I can get some time and do that today.
---
Ridiculous, I know.
---
Be the change you want to see.
---
&gt; This might be an unpopular opinion, but I don't think MC is fun.
---
I don't think it is that unpopular. I think if you anonymously asked most people they would say Molten Core was trash. People just say they like MC out in the open because they want to signal that they want a return to the "epic" scale of raids, not anything specific to MC. 
---
Same with dungeons in vanilla. People like to say they love BRD even though the instance is really pretty shitty in terms of design/layout, simply because it is "epic". Return to Karazhan was a smash hit, easily the most popular dungeon of all-time in terms of popularity per percentage of player-base, and Mechagon is poised to deliver a follow-up to Return to Kara. People love those "epic scale dungeon crawls" and want to signal to Blizzard that is what they want, but I think for the most part if you stacked up BRD to Return to Kara, BRD would lose because it's a massive trash-filled slog with tons of tank-and-spank encounters. 
---
People are really bad at articulating what they like or don't like on a mechanical level. They can point at at thing and grunt "good" but for most folks they can't separate the thing they actually like about it from the thing itself, so the thing must be good because they like an aspect of it.
---
but surely there must be drinks...
---
they are a bar after all
---
I always wanted to be that one guy on an apic moubt in the midle of og that gets inspected by low lvl players for my gear
---
Actually that's exactly how it works. If you're lvl 60 then you can easily tank five lvl 20s
---
instant rich man
---
I've always liked this in games. It's one of the main reasons I love Diablo 3 still. I like being able to put on music or a tv show I want to binge and get some gaming in. Not all the time I like when a game demands my attention too, but it's a key thing I look for so I can fill some time.
---
mage is a hell of a lot of fun but the demand for them in raids is fairly low due to population so fun as it is ii want to raid and i want to raid higher end content not just MC/ONY
---
Funny story, I and a friend rerolled for tbc on Aggamaggan because it was the least progressed guild by far xD (we ended up transferring out after a while)
---
i played 2 years of vanilla, some TBC, almost all of WoTLK and a like 5 different 60s on private servers - and i have STILL never had an epic world drop!
---
Tanks are kinda hard if they are aware of what a massive undertaking it is, i mean you basicly promise to 100% attendance and always be there for your guild.  
---
Now saying that, most of my friends are going to play pretty healthy mix of DPS and Heal, i had 1 friend who wanted to be Druid tank, but when he learned more about it. He said he is going resto xD
---
I mean I am. I’m planning on either tank warrior or priest healer.
---
I opted in but am ultimately glad I didn't get in. I did get in for a stress test or two but felt no will to play. It felt like empty progression. No need to level to 10 when you'll just have to do it all over again. 
---
I let my sub lapse and won't be revisiting any stress tests should they be held. Feel like I could actually get burned out if I had a full beta to mess with.
---
Man, the salt of viewers will be hilarious :D
---
That's why I'm tanking, my group is full of dps
---
Yah cause its 100% human nature to always rationalize every situation. I'll just brb. Gonna make a few casinos and sell some drugs to kids. But I'll just make sure I warn them first of the consequences because then it's totally legit. To fan boys anyways. 🤣🤣
---
Your logic Haha. Oh man.
---
It should still be kept rather simple. Vanilla talent trees are good. BC was good too. Wotlk allready became a bit too much. Making them simpler again in Cata was a good idea - the implementation sucked though.
---
I played on Arthas and gorgonnash,
---
I mostly remember story from gorgonnash aka gonnacrash
---
There was a in retro stud muffins a orc warrior with full t2 and thunderfury, one night he blown all His dkp for a chromatic tempered Sword because its "was better than thunderfury" 2 week later he stole the guild bank and left the server.
---
Lawson, pretty cool ne rogue playing the Rockstar cards. He has couple of youtube video that were great back then
---
Legion of deathwings/them/Dogma - pretty Much all the pvper horde side were in those guild, lod being the elite pvper of the horde.
---
Guerra - pretty cool r14 warrior helping ppl with quest and would reply to any question about warrior.

Theres was ton of troll.

Hunter racism is real. If im forming a group I wont invite a hunter unless I know them. I see hunters as a liability tbh. (mage main here.)  However, I dont want competition selling portals/water so im in favor of anyone in your situation rolling hunter :D . make friends and gl
---
Dreadlordy\*
---
Same problem here. So I'm running a warrior. I tanked in wotlk as a pally &amp; loved it. Gonna take some adjusting, but I think itll be worth it.
---
100% agree
---
hybrids are in a great spot with interesting balance and jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none
---
TBC was the beginning of the end where they started equalizing / normalizing everything, power creeping shit, and of course flying mounts.
---
That’s why it’s my favorite class. Either you are shit and hated, or good and highly appreciated. No real in between
---
I was planning to raid on at least the paladin, the hunter too if I can find a slot. Rogue... maybe? I might just use the rogue to wpvp or gank, not sure if I can raid on 3 separate characters. And yeah I heard paladin leveling is a bit slow but that was why I was thinking about doing him first, since the ganking wont start until a few weeks after launch and hunter and rogue I feel would be less likely to be screwed by heavy ganking.
---
flip a coin, it will reveal your true desire &lt;3
---
but yeah i'd say only play the tank warrior if you definitely plan on joining a guild and raiding.  farming gold and consumables is going to be tough and you will probably need to level an alt anyways
---
hunter isn't the best scaling dps but it has one of the more interesting rotations to do so its more fun than being a mage and endlessly pressing frost bolt!
---
Yup mass downvoting is much worse than cults that commit mass murder and/or suicide.
---
Yeah hybrids shouldn't be, but we have warriors that are literally the best at everything...
---
There is a cap for rank based off level, as well as bonus honor scaling with level bracket. 
---
If you enable PvP ranks right from the start you give a gigantic advantage to all the power levellers more than they already have. People who hit 60 even 3/4 weeks behind the curve will be severely outgeared and outmatched.
---
I feel bad for the “I only dps” warrior. Gunna have a hard time gearing up in 5s.
---
I skip that warrior weapon and grab the sword off of the level 28 quest in darkshore I think it's the tower of attrax. Mainly because I level solo. Also because axe is poo poo sword is happiness
---
Hey hey, a pretty looking shield decorates my inventory space. Need roll 100
---
It's always been exclusive by virtue of being a closed beta. Bfa was also a closed beta. And legion too. Closed betas are normal. They were already honest in saying it was not guaranteed to get in.
---
People just want to feel victimized for their poor choice and I say this as someone who subbed for the chance to get in and didnt. I wasnt owed Jack, it was a lottery and I lost.
---
I change my mind every 2 weeks, so I don't bother to do these anymore.
---
god yeah i was thinking of nelf hunter but im going dwarf because the male nelf animations are god-awful and i dont want to play a female with all the other hunters and rogues!
---
Hey guys i couldn't wait for release so i decided to edit my first PvP movie today.   
---
Any Feedback appreciated (especially editing related). 
---
Hope i was able to make the wait a little less painfull. &lt;3  
---
PS: I don't have beta
---
The way spellbatching is made on classic is not how it worked in vanilla, the system was changed too much, they are currently just simulating spellbatching so reports like this are crucial to make sure that this is how it actually worked in vanilla too.
---
In phase 1, with mostly pre-bis and probably a deep resto spec, you'll rely on your professions to make money.
---
Come phase 2, you'll be able to duo DM east with a tank to make some good gold/hour.
---
And once you have enough +healing and +damage gear, you can probably switch to a 30/0/21 build and can farm DM east lashers with 1.5 second chain lightning, fire nova and magma totem.
---
the sole reason im not playing a male nelf hunter right here
---
Water my dude dont fuck around with sugary waters. Also its nice to start slow with running when i started losing weight i ran 8 km/h for like 8 mins and i was almost dead now i can comfortably run quite fast for over 30 mins before i start to run out of stamina
---
I'm still not following, do you want them to add new content to the current build? I'd say that something like that wouldn't go down well.
---
It's 1.12.1. Blizz has an old 1.12.1 server and client running as well to compare beta bug reports to similar situations on their reference server to make sure the beta client is behaving correctly.

It's straight 1.12.1 for the most part. No true patch progression, though content will be unlocked in a series of 6 "content buckets". Itemization and class balance patches aren't going to happen, they'll all exist in their 1.12 state. This includes threat generation, class revamps, 16 debuff slots instead of 8, etc right from the start.
---
Overall they're putting in a lot of effort to make sure it's pretty authentic 1.12, though.
---
It's there for characters that don't have the flight path yet.
---
Or either you are the biggest troll ever 😉
---
Definitely Hillsbrad.
---
Rogue / Hunter / Mage are the only 3 classes I've mained 50+ and I can say, rogue should always kill hunter if he gets a stealth open. Mage is the only class that gives rogue trouble since blink removes stuns and ice mages have crazy survivability.
---
I think you're mistaken and that it's easier to level warrior than rogue.
---
Not when I’m rolling orc ,’:^)

Can't remember his name but pretty much every main tank from detheroc horde had their helm crafted by the main tank of TKT

They told you it was not guaranteed. It's a closed beta, not a lottery prize. What do you want, the odds printed on the side of your subscription receipt?

#BetaClub
---
Honestly I trust the devs about my only issue with the devs is this dedication to #nochanges. I personally think 1.12 is one of the most nerfed patches in comparison to dungeon difficulty and, it features the most buffed loot. I would like them to up the anti of dungeons by at least 20% and Molten core by 100%. Not sure on the other raids.

streamers as bug hunters also have the advantage of footage for every bug they find
---
Lol yassssss
---
Yeah his fantasy is playing a badass dual wielding bull warrior. I dig it, no complaints that’s what he wants to do. However, if I end up tanking for us I’ll be getting first pickings :)
---
&gt;If you enable PvP ranks right from the start you give a gigantic advantage to all the power levellers more than they already have. People who hit 60 even 3/4 weeks behind the curve will be severely outgeared and outmatched.
---
So what? They will be at a disadvantage anyways when people are doing MC before they are even 60.
---
and if they are rushing 60 before anyone else, they will struggle with obtaining honor as there will be less players to grind.
---
WoW is not a competitive game either, its not a fair PvP game, its an RPG. And people getting is kinda what we want right "Epics matter".
---
Is that a joke?
---
&gt; . I don't know who taught you geography but Europe is hardly "the other side of the planet" either. 
---
I don't know who taught you geometry, but where I come from, "the other side", in the context of a spheroid, usually refers to the single point on the surface that is r*2 +- epsilon away.
---
&gt;Also, you seem quite worked up. Maybe you've had enough Reddit for today? :D
---
This may be hard for you to swallow, but there are people who are doing quite well in a confrontation. Also, there is no better way for you to admit defeat, as telling me to go away based on your emotions :D
---
Healers I can maybe understand if you haven't played one before, but as a tank you're still doing a big chunk of the group's DPS *and* holding all the mobs. Have you reminded them of that? Warrior tanking is fun as hell.
---
&gt; Server technology is SIGNIFICANTLY better now than in 2004. Population limits were put in place due to literal hardware constraints.
---
No that's not true I'm afraid. Both Mark Kern and Kevin Jordan has confirmed on multiple occasions that the realm sizes were a design decision. They could run higher caps than what we had in 2005, they just didn't want to.
---
The debuff limit on the other hand was a purely technical limitation and they're even putting that back in.

Retail is that way -&gt;

Probably for the better too...theyll be more useful as shitty mage/rogue than shitty tank/healer.

Was also KT in Cloak and Dagger. I remember those events and guilds quite well. Good times.

Just a few counterpoints:
---
Twitch streaming is a free entertainment. That isn't an industry standard, usually when someone provides entertainment for you, you are paying him for it. Big streamers provide entertainment for thousands of people and most of them are getting it for free. That's quite wonderful. And that's why a lot of people subscribe, donate or otherwise support them. To give back. To allow them to continue doing what they're good at.
---
Some people are watching, want to support a streamer in some way, but money is not a viable option. And what easier way than to donate some in game goodies you have?
---
I'm not even brushing what effect that has on economy, fair competition or even the enjoyment of the streamer. It's obvious it has some negative impacts. I'm just saying it's a pretty understandable behaviour.
---
That's just a part of the people though - a ton of people don't care about supporting anyone and it's for example a way to make them feel worth, either thanks to lack of self esteem or thanks to a pathological need to "be in a spotlight" which I indeed view as sad too. But as a token of appreciation for someone who gives me hundreds of free content to enjoy? Why not?
---
IF was the hub because it had the big square tiles that you could run around jumping from for hours while you "played".
---
druid and hunter in pvp are both pretty complex and have a lot of tricks and options
---
also shaman is very underrated in most aspects.  i think it's a very strong pvp/duel class and has lots of tricks itself

As a horde player I always thought Ashenvale was a crazy place to go. The first time I went there you really get a feeling of "I don't belong here" because it's so clearly a Night Elf area, as if your very presence in the area is an abomination. One of the first moments was a handful of weeks after vanilla launched a good portion of our server formed a literal horde and just ran through all of Ashenvale and NE areas and slaughtered everything and everyone right up into the capital city. It's not my favorite area but it's the first area I remember going outside of The Barrens were it so clearly isn't a safe zone both aesthetically and otherwise.
---
Overall probably Hillsbrad because of all he memories. If I am honest though most of my great Level 6o WPvP battles happened in Eastern Plaguelands or any area in or near Burning Steppes.
---
Exploiting is for the weak and defenseless. This was not exploitation. Its marketing, but no one has any right to claim they subbed because they were guaranteed a beta. All it took was rational thought to avoid being baited, the irrational decision is purely on the co sumer here and I say this as someone who really hates loot box and FOMO design.
---
If we waste all our time dispelling and rebuffing out dots will eventually win so that's ok

You'll definitely see fewer non-healing Shamans at endgame.  Paladins are similarly pigeonholed, while popular.

What am I looking for here, I'm on mobile so it's a bit of a cluster fuck
---
Or you could read the tooltip before drinking it, or you could put the one you actually want to use on your actions bars and put it on a hotkey so you are that much less likely to fuck it up.
---
If their only goal is to level up, hit 60, and then go back to BFA, which is their choice, then that's fine. Not everyone wants to raid in Classic. I know I'm going to level up another Shaman and then wait until Burning Crusade servers personally, I have no interest in raiding Molten Core ever again. If they're not going to raid, why give them a hard time about it? Makes you look like a fat nerd.
---
You will fight over this gear: http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
No, I didn't.
---
As a European player, my chances to get into the Beta are next to zero. And even if I weren't, I am not dumb enough to throw money at Blizzard when there is no guarantee that it will give me access.
---
the beauty of classic is that the people who stayed  in the party put that healer and that dps on their ignore list.   Then when you encounter them again you know not to group with them.
---
A few weeks later that healer applies to your guild, but you say, hey wait, that guy left us after 1 wipe in XXXX.  and another guildie says, hey i remember that name, he left us too and called us idiots in Scarlet monastery the other day, I vote nay. And the 3rd guildie  says, i know that guy, &lt;That Other Guild&gt;  kicked him, so I think he pulled that shit there too, lety's ask them...

---
I did, but im not subbed. I want to go into classic and just enjoy the experience again. I doubt i would use beta if i got it.
---
Im not racing for it. If it takes me a while to get to 60, thats fine. I can only go through classic for the first time once so I plan on enjoying it.
---
&gt; some people will have over 50 keybinds, basically 1 for all skills including buffs, food/drink, mounting, consumables etc
---
Do they have them?  Maybe.  Do they need them within combat reachable range? Doubtful.  They also would still be better off with modifiers vs excessive buttons

This is why I made my first shaman, well this and [my fav Ragnaros kill video] (https://youtu.be/oju6cjG3vJM)

I've been lurking in this subreddit for a year, and I have seen how it changed so much.
---
At first there was a lot of discussion about how X &gt; Y, if there was a way for Y &gt; X, etc.
---
Then, when 80% of endgame content was already discussed, the subreddit became a circlejerk about wow vanilla &gt; retail.
---
Now its full of drama. People crying because streamers/streamer haters(?), 20% of the subreddit loves everything a streamer do, other 20% hates everything they do.
---
But hey, at least its fun to see new discussions.
---
played a warrior in classic ages ago. z,x,c are stance buttons, don't @ me.
---
also, mortal strike/bloodthirst/shieldslam on G. G is the money key. it stayed the money key throughout every iteration of wow for me. stormstrike for shaman, starsurge for druid, conflag for warlock, flurry for mage.
---
ouchhhh random mob?
---
Poorly designed? Really? Think you are in the wrong sub......
---
Wow, can't wait to have a look at this when I'm on a computer, thanks!
---
Yeah I’ve been told that, I love just about anything vanilla 🤷‍♀️
---
dont worry my friend.
---
Who knows what will happen after Naxxramas, but whatever it is, it'll make Blizzard a shitton of money.
---
There's some plate, some mail some leather some cloth, and you will wear a fucked up mix match of all of it and be happy looking like an absolute idiot. But ofc you are gonna steal all the tier gear so when you sitting in IF all day you can look like a baller.
---
I stay in my PvP spec when raiding, does that count?
---
That's how I interpreted OP's piece - I guess it could mean to show sadness over the fact that the zeppelin wasnt in classic.
---
I didn't say anything about leveling. I just said there are a lot of deterring features.
---
Wow.
---
Yes you did.
---
&gt;Something that doesn't exist in WoW.
---
Nice selfown btw.
---
They're just trying to get to 40 first so they can show off their epeen
---
IIRC it's literally 1 or 2 plate items that are holy pala BiS until Naxx. And even they aren't there until phase 4/5.
---
However, if you don't care about being the absolute best, just wear the tier sets and look cool. Standard raiding guilds won't care that you're not taking cloth from other healers.
---
For me it's "maybe I should go back and finish that insane grind". For some reason I have fond memories of spending a good amount of Wrath in Tanaris punching pirates.
---
ah i cant relate
---
While it was a long time ago, if my middle age memory is reliable at one point you go to Theramore and fight an unkillable person at a tower ? Or if wrong ...never mind. I recall this vividly as I had a guildie who asked for help killing him at one point ...which was rather futile
---
I am hoping that all the great old, long quest chains are still there and I look forward to completing them all
---
Why would you have Distilled Wisdom and Titans?
---
I remember a salty hunter spending all of his dkp on talon of azshara ( ssc drop 1h sword with ARMOR and 2.7 speed ,arguably one of the better tank weaps of the expansion) only because it had agility and ap aswell..
---
Man i miss those times
---
That's a retail attitude. 
---
You can pretty much fill roles with any class. Sure there's minmax efficiency, but it's not impossible to find a guild as a DPS shaman or druid, just like it wasn't impossible in vanilla. I hope more people drop the item level achievement restriction mindset that plagues so many raiding guilds now.
---
Damn right you will! And you'll take your 10% reputation gain and your 5% increased Spirit _and you'll like it!_
---
I jumped on bfa and am close to maxing a toon for the first time since wotlk. So much has changed.  This game feels more like diablo 3 than the wow I knew.
---
So is there no instance where, when wearing all that gear, I would dominate in a certain build? :P
---
This is false. I've played on such servers, and even lower pop, multiple times with no issues. It sounds low, but it isn't.
---
&gt;Yah cause its 100% human nature to always rationalize every situation.

Ofc it isn't.

Yes, it did drop off General Angerforge originally. As your edit says, it was moved in patch 1.10. My guild would regularly help dps farm it. Your memory is correct.

If you’re doing level appropriate content it is not going to be a zergfest. One group pulled at a time with CC on troublesome mobs. If you pull even a second group you’ll probably wipe. That’s my experience at least. It depends on gear and the players though.

You’re assuming I’m giving them a hard time about it. We also don’t play bfa. Not all of them want to raid, but we all want to do dungeons together. I really was just trying to see if others are in the same situation as I am, creating a discussion besides the usual 6 topics we see. Sorry man.
---
Great excuse to take advantage of people. Grow up man. They knew exactly what they were doing.
---
Warriors are OP in vanilla. I can't deny that. I don't think it was perfect by any means but was a lot better than how the classes are in BFA.
---
Thanks for sharing.. truly amazing pics
---
Thats the thing!! Thank you
---
If you think Agamaggan came back to life in BC, you never witnessed its true shine. Honestly.
---
played warrior all through classic and BC. ZXC  stance keys are where it's at.
---
also the stance specific cooldowns on shift+z,x,c : retaliation shift+z, shieldwall shift+x, recklessness on shift+c
---
&gt;There's a lot of talk about adding extra content to 1.13
---
There is also a lot of talk of the earth being flat, I don't take that serious either.
---
It’s interesting to rewatch someone commenting on vanilla not through nostalgia. Obviously he loved wow but definitely highlighted some things that weren’t GREAT about it.  
---
Good call back though, haven’t heard this in a long time
---
Did you cut most of your sugars and carbohydrates? Or I should say excess carbohydrates?

I am truly balancing my marriage to classic and my marriage with my wife.  I might choose WoW haha

i dont agree with most of the choices for pre raid tank

I have done betas before for many games, I no longer care.  Even for new games let alone one I played in 2005
---
However, I have been thinking about resubbing to get in touch with my old guildmates and see what their plans are
---
Then you'll have to think how many races can druid be. Only 2, and there's 8 in total :P Oddly enough I see a lot of people saying they'll roll Druid. Though we'll see how it is when it launches.

Same, four lvl 60 characters and not a single BoE epic. In fact, I didnt even find my first one until my Cataclysm.

With the exception of a few pieces like [Peacekeeper Gauntlets](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20264/peacekeeper-gauntlets) in ZG and [Legplates of Blazing Light](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21667/legplates-of-blazing-light) in AQ, all your best-in-slot gear is cloth and leather and your off-hands are all flowers and other weird items.
---
None of your tier pieces are best-in-slot until Naxx, and even then you'll be wearing a couple cloth pieces.
---
That doesn't mean you won't be wearing plate, as they'll be high competition for all the gear you actually want. And you'll want a plate set for PVP.
---
Was hoping to be able to heal/buff and then when people are mostly good, run in and wack enemies for a bit, then repeat. I'm relatively OK with healing as long as I can wear mostly mail/plate and juggling gear sets isn't an issue either. I think the 20/0/31 build is good enough to heal like you mentioned and that way I can still run Ret in PvP, which I think is a good trade off. Might do this since it seems to be the most viable. We'll see what happens at the end but at least I know this is an option.
---
FWIW I haven't had this experience in retail. There's been a frustrating exchange for words, but I've not been kicked or witnessed someone be kicked Since maybe early Legion. I was in a group that wiped three times on a boss in Mythic +2 underrot due to misunderstanding the mechanics, but everyone still stayed and finished even though we were like ~10 minutes over.
---
The only thing that makes Gnomes better than others is it is harder to click on them. Actually their Handle Mustache facial option is also pretty cool.
---
Just throwing it out there if you want some peeps to join we got some long lost friends and some life long friends and some completely unknown future friends that are playing with me and you are welcome.
---
This. Having such high player counts is UNSUPPORTED. It's contorting the game into something it was never meant to be, and the game suffers for it. The mob spawn time problem is one good example of the negative consequences.
---
The downvoting of every opinion that isn't in favor of super high player counts shows that this subreddit doesn't know the game whatsoever.
---
So if I follow this thread, there will be too many warriors, hunters, shamans, mages, warlocks, maybe too many paladins as well, pretty sure rogues will be legion on pvp servers, if you want to be original you can only be priest or druid??
---
At some point you have to decide for yourself what you really want to play without being too affraid of what other people will play, especially since you would have to wait months to choose your class as many people will start a class and change their mind in the middle of their leveling.
---
Not mentioning the fact that your server might end up underpopulated or faction balance could be bad...
---
In the end maybe you should not even play to be sure you make a decision to be regretted later on!
---
Or you choose to play what you like, enjoy the game and if you feel like change to another class later on. I know the "but I won't have to start over from scratch" argument but keep in mind leveling is a nice part of Vanilla experience as long as you don't level alone, and I am confident it wont be the case with Classic!
---
One of them will keep coming back...
---
God some hunters are so dense. Memes aside, Ashkandi is actually BiS for hunters before ZG (til fang of faceless and warblade) but trying to get a weapon like  that is just ridiculous
---
It's okay.  Writing a check is more 2005 than a WoW screenshot.

This meme is supposed to convey two seemingly mutually exclusive concepts that the person is having a hard time choosing between, but the two button labels placed aren't mutually exclusive at all.

"Summon Omar" spam is inside joke, MMO silliness crowd think. It has absolutely no bearing  on whether people have confidence that Omar, or any other dev, actually has the capacity to develop quality content past 1.12. You can absolutely have fun with someone while not having any confidence in their capabilities. If not, we'd have far fewer friends both IRL and in game.
---
I played on Sylvanas EU.  
---
The one thing my realm was famous for from what I remember was an undead mage named Vurtne.
---
The wait is killing me, I've been trying out classes on retail and playing them to level 20-30 to see which ones I enjoy. That's really helped scratch my itch for now.
---
All the steamers spent a week or two getting BiS at level 30 which is why it’s easier for them to spam run it. It won’t be that easy as a fresh 30 chilling in quest greens, so questing and just progressing that way will be more beneficial
---
ok, i get your point, so you can play that, but for me it would be great to have a choice :P

If you are full prot... play with a dps so they can carry you.

warlock is the only one that's on the 10's  Voidwalker at 10, succubus at 20, felhunter at 30, inferno at 50, then doom guard  at 60.
---
Some classes get a ton very early. e.g. Druid Bear quest at 10, cure poison at 14, aquatic form at 16. and then nothing much after that.
---
Some classes don't get much at all e.g. hunter tame pet at 10, then nothing really after. Mage, Magic wand 30, and polymorph pig at 60. Priest, racial quests at 10 &amp; 20,
---
Yup, 30 to 50 hours for each book :)
---
That's how you make friends that'll last til 60
---
sure....
---
The initial design was to allow rogues and hunters to use shields(bucklers)
---
I have never thought about doing that instead of normally binding them....
---
I can reasonably use shift modifiers. But I can't for the life of me use ctrl for keybindings. I don't type in the traditional sense so it's a difficult stretch for me to do.
---
It'll just depend at the time and what the area looks like. You'll probably need to decide on the fly. It's not a matter of "this or that" it's a matter of how much of a clusterfuck it is or isn't at the time you're playing.
---
Not for healing no. But you can however look like a full on plate baller (tier works fine) in pvp healing, because you want the high stam and armor that plate gives. 
---
I think in later stages of the game you can look alright in full healer like aq/naxx, but before that you look really stupid.
---
In classic, Earthshock was always bound to Q because people got so salty over the interrupt. R1 disrespect was real. And being a tauren shaman, I'd also bait Counterspell's with my hearthstone because the heal animation was the same as the HS one.
---
It's a very even matchup when players are even skill. You'll be able to run away generally as well.
---
It’s what I plan to do. Yeah a lot of competition 30-40 right now so instanced are much better just because you can reset and go again without trying to tag mobs vs 20 other players. I am 32 so far but I’ve been messing around and doing world quests. People that have been grinding SM have hit 40 already. I also have had to sleep and work a 8 hour job. So miles may very

If they were planning to take advantage of you, they wouldn't have specifically warned you that there is no guarantee you get into the beta. A casino will not put up huge signs warning you of the potential negative effects of gambling (unless they are required to by law).
---
And even if they were taking advantage of people...wow, what a complete shock...a business does business things. How extraordinarily unexpected. What's next, you gonna blame cows for eating grass?
---
If you feel like they took advantage of you (and judging by your saltiness I guess you resubbed and got disappointed ^^) then you have only and a lack of rational action and self control to blame.
---
Lightning’s Blade US had Ming (the big one) and Aedak (less huge, but fairly well known warrior).
---
Most likely not. By the 30-40 range most people should be spread out enough to where it’s not completely flooded in those later areas.
---

You can enjoy the same content on a pserver. An the question is investing time into a no invest back beta. An the beta is more PR than anything. The problem we have is people are seeing it from the streams which is making people ster crazy

it will depend on the density of the questing arenas, and how much pvp there is.

People of the Capital Wasteland, it is I, Three Dog, your ruler! Hear me, and obey! Oh sorry, that's that other radio station.

Yours is more of a retail attitude.  Finding spots as dps shaman or Druid is hard as fuck in vanilla.

You can see its from 09 because the streets are empty.

There will definitely be weekend raiding guilds with family life and career scheduling in mind.

Cigarettes are a scam. Paying money for an addictive substance with no benefits and lots of negative side effects.

Source: I am a smoker :(
---
Never had this problem me and my mate always run healer/tank duo no matter what game :)
---
Obviously the BiS gear makes a big difference as well lots of people on the beta had done high lvl quests which massively fucks up their questing route.
---
I don't think dungeon spamming will be the best method, but it might be a really good method for rogues/warriors and other slow levelers if you are in a premade group.
---
I decided to make a toon on retail, turn off all quest tracking, no BoAs, zero help from my mains, keeping up fairly well with professions as i level, lvl 69 right now and havent used a flying mount yet (did train the skill, will need it for Icecrown/Storm Peaks if i go there), etc.
---
Im reading every quest, finding the objectives on my own 99% of the time (have googled a couple, or turned on the tracking for a quick second if i was going to tab out and google it), and in general just exploring a lot.
---
Its been a lot of fun.  Still maybe a bit 'easy', but a mage with no BoA gear is actually a tad squishy, and with dynamic respawns ive definitely gotten into some trouble if theres 120s around farming.  Hell, even normal respawns if youre in a cave after someone cleared it gets to be dangerous at times.
---
I joined some random guild that invited me in the mid 20s.  Its been nice chatting with some new people, and being in a guild thats actually active.
---
Thats sad

I made a lot of gold in vanilla from ports. While spamming my enchanting sales pitch in trade I would occasionally port to different cities to see if anyone was asking for portals. Probably made more from the ports than the enchanting. The key was to always get a few people to all pay for the same portal. I found it particularly lucrative to open a portal and announce that I had opened one and that it would close in 2 minutes so they should hurry. Sort of like stores to flash sales, it encouraged people to buy my services for fear that they would miss their chance and have to wait.

Correct. Tape drives are excellent for data that you will write and read infrequently from. But because it has to literally spool the tape, it's fetch times are terrible, and so if you are trying to access a ton of small files that are all over the tape in different locations, it slows to a crawl.
---
pre-emptively dismissing people as trolls because they disagree is weaksauce.
---
Check out www.vanillafriends.com and save yourself the $15 :)
---
It's because DPS players are narcissists.  You need new friends.
---
They go without saying ;)
---
OSRS I guess comes close but I don't think they had the whole beta streaming thing.
---
Be a top dps as hunter.
---
Aresden or Elvine?
---
I always have interrupts bound to my space bar. Like a big fuck you button.
---
Not at this scale, no.
---
This is a pretty unique occurrence on the gaming industry, and you can bet that not just Blizzard is watching how it turns out.
---
this is so me
---
Do you know what the preraid-1, preraid-2, 1, 2, etc mean? Like fresh 60, then geared 60, then MC, then Ony, etc?
---
it would be better if you mods had less lame rules
---
While gear is playing a large part in these streamer runs, I feel the communication is the biggest factor to their grind.  
---
If you can get four other people and coordinate it, you should have a similar effect, albeit not a fast as these streamers.
---
You wouldnt say "I getting the guild back together" you'd still say "Me getting the guild back together" so it would be the boys and me.
---
this guy gets it
---
You're like 12 judging by your posts. Don't pretend that you ever played vanilla in its heyday.
---
I'm not gonna get burned out from playing the beta, but I did the same. I'm not paying for a small chance to play a beta version of a game.
---
if u have a good group with mages/warriors its worth it
---
Exactly. You dont get heals unless you do what I say and I say get out of the fucking fire
---
Holy shit, I couldn't agree more. I actually had an argument with several of my friends about this and none of them seemed to understand what I was trying to say. Being able to experience a raid on an easier setting to me ruins the experience of feeling like you've achieved something when you are finally geared enough to take the raid on. Imagine taking down Illidan or the Lich king in a fucking LFR group. You don't know anyone in your raid, and everyone just leaves right after he dies. You aren't even able to celebrate it with anybody. Even if you go and beat it in HC25 afterwards, who the hell cares? You've already had the experience of seeing the final boss fight, the boss room, the dialogue, and everything else thats comes with raiding. Completely takes away from the experience.

https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.4.0#Raids_.26_Dungeons
---
&gt;Prior to this patch, Molten Core boss creatures could drop items from one of two different tiered sets for every character class. The loot tables have been changed so Molten Core bosses will now only drop items from the lower tier class sets. However, some of the items from those sets were not previously dropping in Molten Core. These missing class set items will now drop in Molten Core, allowing players to complete their lower tier class sets. The higher tier class set pieces that once dropped in Molten Core will be found once again in Blackwing Lair, the next raiding zone scheduled for release in a future patch.
---
&gt; Future patches will include even more item rewards for these raid encounters, as well as improvements to the statistics, effects, and set bonuses for both tiers of the raid armor sets.
---
Tier 2 was added back in 1.6 at which point Tier 2 Legs from Ragnaros and Tier 2 Helm from Onyxia were appointed.
---
I've just started playing private servers. Blizzard doesn't want normal players in their beta so I'll just have my own.
---
You can find groups with no issues on a 3k server. This worry is unwarranted.
---
&gt; but it's outclassed by many options once you hit lvl 60.
---
Not in phase 1
---
But but but but but ... the self-styled-progamers on this r/ have told everyone that every other char will be a warrior or Dwarf priest?!?
---
How do you mean, what other games could see success from a relaunch like this?
---
Ok, listening to the old episodes, I have to give Scott credit where it's due; he says in episode 8 (this is early 2006) that a thing he hates about hunters is having to use a quiver to hold only arrows as it's taking up precious bag space. He specifically says "I hate that". So, I can see why he liked the arrow change in Mists, and why that will probably be a barrier to entry for him back into Classic WoW.
---
I'm not his shill, or a fanboy, but the proof is there that he has hated that since the earliest days of him playing WoW. At this point in his podcast, he still did not have a max level character either, for what that's worth.
---
Nah I didnt resub. I'm not salty. I'm just not a fan of blizzard doing this shady shit.
---
I suppose we can call it matter of opinion at this point since your logic is that of, if you can warn people it's ok.
---
I dont understand the analogy to cows eating grass. That's in one way beneficial to your point. Anyways. Done here. Peace fan boy.
---
No bubble to burst. We are aware of all these things. We're not ALL leveling at the same time. What we're attempting to do is most leveling when at least one other person is on. That won't be too difficult. In the process of leveling our professions we'll gain XP, and focus on getting gear and making money when we're alone - all those things give us XP, but at a much lower rate. 
---
I don't know what it means for mob levels to be dynamic.
---
That entirely depends on what the warrior is doing. If you are wasting all you GCD's trying to do that. It's not going to end well for you. Keep in mind to at any point if he's getting over run. He can pop bub and laugh.
---
Why male models?
---
We are very excited.
---
Pirate yup. Maybe I’ll get a couple hundred gold, but it would have been really great on the real deal.
---
Again you're focusing on the streamers themselves, claiming they are getting "special treatment". If there were no streamers, but the game enabled some sort of native third party viewing, the issue is exactly the same.
---
Lolokay. If you say so.
---
Is it possible that there's a loot per server function to items? I mean to say that since nobody has gotten these items the server is primed and waiting to give them to people. But the drop chance will normalize now that they are able to drop finally.
---
I’m playing a Pserver and doing just that to hold me over, also relearning the questing zones cause dem quest are so much different than retail after cata
---
You are mistaken.
---
The retail attitude is that every class can do pretty much everything.
---
And while guilds definitely take on Ele shamys and Ferals, if you try to "fill the roles" with these specs, instead of taking Warlocks, Mages, Hunters, Rogues and dpsWarris, you are gonna have a problem.
---
I found a streamer, I think his name was asmongold. He streams classic.
---
I agree that it's not impossible.
---
but
---
it's pretty close
---
you're\*
---
I have a blast reading and commenting here, and I am happy to wait until Aug 27th.
---
No idea what you're talking about.
---
No, but ez mode /face roll content -= retail
---
It's a hell of a lot better for them than mages while leveling, since their pet lets them abuse how op wands are.
---
Yeah, that’s fair. I don’t think you’re shilling him. I’ll give him a pass on arrows but there’s still plenty more reasons he hates classic. Lol wait, doesn’t have a max character in the beta or he’s never been levelcapped in any expansion before???
---
It will probably be faster questing/grinding honestly. Unless you get a dedicated 5 man group like the streamers and can all tolerate the same dungeon over and over. For your own mental health, just go explore and quest/world PvP and have fun. Do every dungeon once, unless the group wants to run it again right after. This is usually still worth it.
---
ONE CONDITION: they use the original game fule recipe, none of this reduced sugar or alternative sweetener bull shit. 
---
I prefer the original, exceptional.
---
The only time I would kick someone was if they refused to listen to criticism such as a healer focusing on dps when the tank keeps dying or a dps pulling instead of the tank and wiping us. Outside of higher level dungeons a team of properly leveled people with a tank/healer should be able to clear anything, even in crap gear.
---
UT2k4 all day everyday
---
Rift is one that could if they produce enough hype
---
Exactly!
---
We think we're gonna do the pairs idea too, at most groups of three, except for instances. The goal is to be playing at the same time, not necessarily in the same group.
---
So far, the mains people are picking are:
---
Paladin - me and one other
---
a warrior
---
a mage
---
a priest
---
a rogue
---
a hunter
---
Other people will pick when others have made their decisions, or closer to launch. We're all taking time off.
---
Please don't do this to me
---
I'm aiming to have fun throughout my entire time playing instead of just the endgame so having a partner to level with changes things. I was avoiding warrior for that reason and I read warlock is in a similar position.
---
I guess it's not really a question other people can answer for me.
---
Friends are overrated and annoying in an mmorpg.
---
It's not a good dps increase for rogues because it's so fast.
---
The proc is the only thing that would help it out in terms of dps, but it would also likely make it so you have to stop dps as a rogue even with your threat dump.
---
The only area that gets overrun between 30 and 40 is STV. Otherwise everyone is pretty spread out.
---
If you dont want to risk the pvp slow down in STV you can plan an  other route.
---
However Dungeons will not be as fast come launch. People wont have maxed engineering and BiS and warriors certainly wont have whirlwind axe at lvl 30
---
Its often better to straight grind specific mobs for a few bars.
---
I'ma do this. Been trying to think of what to do and drawing a blank. Thanks.
---
unlikely that it will optimal but its not without its advantages
---
I mean we had to discover dungeons like that for Cata, then we could queue for it, but yea I don't mind it at all, the game is either going to progress or become stagnant, so I'm all for it
---
Hi, /u/Wienerhorst
---
you are not alone! I want it too!
---
Ohhhh well in that case absolutely. Obviously I misread oops!
---
this was my memory too.  wasn't sure if i was having a berenstein bear moment since i didnt play melee so i wasnt 100% sure
---
Well good for you mate. I enjoy the drama too sometimes
---
Wasn't as 'neccessary'. They had a back up copy of the game from that time so the hype for release wasn't as long and drawn out. The hype in the community and YouTube scene was real though
---
Aegwynn was also known for the guy that multiboxed 40 shamans and took over STV and SW for hours because he could. I ran into him while I was leveling my first character. I had to quit for the day because he would kill the quest givers and then just gank you to no end.
---
I've been playing Mordhau and Sekiro, and waiting patiently for Friday for the new Path of Exile league to start. Should help hold me off until august I hope.
---
Yeah I've been doing a bunch of research on paladins, i was always super jealous of them during vanilla.
---
We're all been trying to practice the classes we've picked, through various means
---
No talking about those servers that shall not be named
---
Ooph. Force consensus!
---
has anyone checked if this quest is doable?   [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3129](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=3129)  level requirement might be 40
---
Your portals alone will make you rich. People pay 1g per portal
---
Its hit or miss for me. Mythic + is cancer cause only like 6-8 specs are even viable when pushing higher keys. Some raid groups are really pleasant, at least at normal difficulty.
---
It doesn't get much more hardcore than the work you have to put in to raid dps as shaman or druid.
---
Working a full time job, spending leisure time with friends and family, spending quality time with my friend THC, playing video games, reading reddit. Watching the occasional movie.
---
Plenty of stuff to do before I lose my life like it’s November 2004 again.
---
Yea. I was so hyped for it because I know it’s gonna be a great episode. Too bad I gotta wait a whole other fucking week.
---
That would depend on the class you’re playing. For example. Warriors / rogues are great on whelps. Hunters love the jaguars in sos because of the low hp. Mages and warlocks better in more condensed areas. Paladins on undead mobs. Etc etc
---
Put it in on day one and it will be hell getting to 60 since honor kills are going to be worth just as much as skinning or herbalism or what have you. It will be constant Kill on sight for everyone all the way to 60 if your going for the pvp gear. At least this way we have a chance to get to 60 on at least one character with out it being world war Warcraft.
---
IMO the biggest adjustment from Retail to Classic will be the necessity of CC, proper threat management, and smaller pulls, along with harsher punishments for additional pull.
---
When I compare my experiences between then and now, I think it's no question that dungeon mechanics have become much more complex and sophisticated than they were Pre-TBC. I'm not saying one is any better or worse than the other, I would say I enjoyed Classic-era dungeon runs more. But by all accounts by experience as a Mage in classic dungeons was mostly hand out water, don't pull aggro and don't pull adds. For better or worse, I have a lot more involvement in dungeons today.
---
For the record, I'm not sure what bosses you are referencing who have 10 abilities that all five players can counter at all times. I just ran a Mythic last night with a boss who had three abilities and debuffs that 4/5 players didn't have a dispell for.
---
Some players deserve a fate much worse than /ignore.
---
There won't be any services that didn't exist back then so definitely none of those you mention.
---
The notion is that name changes and transfers are going against the server-community aspect of vanilla WoW.
---
I'd bet they leave them roughly the same then, but with the launch layering they'll probably have to do free server transfers (like Meerkat said) because I don't see how some servers don't hit above cap.
---
exactly its not gonna play that well. In fact, wotlk is beginning of the end. I personally would leave after the end of TBC, because Wotlk already has too many mmorpg flaws compared to vanilla and classes in pvp feel dull compared to tbc. But you cannot just stop the progress. If you are going to release TBC and wotlk after, you cannot just stop, once you started and you must continue with other expansions. Now, if blizzard will take this path, smartest thing to do, would be define clearly all the important aspects, that makes vanilla great and release all these expansions with major changes to keep that "vanilla feel". Or, they will continue with 1.13. Third option here is to keep releasing expansions as they were, but thats highway to hell or 4th option, they ll continue with tbc and open fresh vanilla servers, but this seems like a terrible idea to me. That will give players feel like they are rats running on a spinning wheel to nowhere, since after the end of vanilla 2y later, they can start all over. People will eventually get fed up with it. So 2 options here are left: 1. 1.13 or improved/changed expansions. After all, its too soon to discuss it anyway
---
If mostly plan on just leveling together and doing dungeons, one of the DPS warriors can tank while you heal. They don't need to switch specs while leveling. If it comes down to not doing a dungeon or a DPS switching to a shield, someone should step up. Maybe by the time they reach 60 they will have changed their mind about tanking.
---
Same but it's staring at the talent calculator moving like one point every hour...
---
Catching up on my PS4 library : Spiderman, Kingdom Hearts 3, some old DLC I never played from Ni No Kuni 2, Tales of Vesperia.
---
Is Hunter actually hard or is it just the hardest class? Because that's a big difference. 
---
Pressing a button between auto shots vs just spamming frost bolt is harder but how hard does it get?
---
I'm a quite competitive player so it might actually be a plus. Trying to be top dps Vs the other 2-3 Hunters in a raid could be fun.(going a mage would basically be "I got worse gear so what can I do…") 
---
Basically what I'm asking is if Hunter is actually annoyingly hard or is it just harder than the rest?
---
Yeah, but nobody has tricked you into doing it, have they? Unless you started smoking about 70 years ago, you must have been well aware of the lack of benefits, negative side effects and addictiveness.
---
This is for sure the reason. At no point on live server will this many people be hyper-farming these mobs lol
---
I do ESDF, it's great, you get way more keys to play with.
---
As for Caps Lock, you should rebind it to Ctrl, its life-changing.
---
He’s not wrong tbf, anyone with info worth sharing on classic doesn’t need beta access to share that info, add-on devs need access to test what they’re making.
---
First they had OnlyWatch and now they have World of Streamers
---
Wish I had friends to play with tbh, going to be a lonely healer.
---
ive always played alliance for the most part, so i am definitely more familiar with it, but i dont mind a change
---
same. also deathborn/deathbourne spamming 'PUNKS' in trade chat, unfadable/end-game/banana boyz beef, my friend being EXTREMELY hated by half the server for a gold scheme : buying the winter present packages, putting a blacksmith hammer in them, mailing them COD to people for 50 silver (curiosity is a powerful incentive), BOOZERS/TheLastCall raiding, getting a week ban for exploiting diremaul tribute runs, summoning random people to the bottom of the well of eternity in un-finished hyjal (i miss wall walking), stv arena nonsense... man i hope i get even a small % of that with classic re-release :D
---
Lots and lots of water, and occasionally a lo-carb monster if I need some energy.  Not doing any running for this one as it's hard as fuck to vlog, and tbh, I fucking hate running.  I'm doing circuits of pushups, situps, and squats, the number of which depends on the amount of activities completed in a two-hour play session.
---
Please give us unarmored mounts blizzy
---
as they were, permanent or super expensive ill still buy one.
---
There’s an addon called ring menu that lets you pull up a circular action bar when you press a set keybind. As someone that uses 70+ keybjnds this is very helpful for me. You still have to click it but it’s pretty efficient since it opens the menu wherever your cursor is. In my opinion, the only thing more efficient is using really good binds like: E,QR,F,G etc... but that would be a waste. It’s also really nice to use for mage portals, consumables &amp; professions.
---
Dual monitor ?
---
Just get a second monitor, cheaper and faster :) (Obviously you already have the phone but seriously, 2 monitors is amazing)
---
Sounds like retail players. The Warrior Druid and Shaman will all learn how to play WoW eventually, they just need to put some time in.
---
OSRS also doesn't have as much plot as Vanilla does. Playing will be fun, but I think the nostalgic entertainment factor is the strongest thing.
---
You don’t need to be subscribed to get invited.
---
Hunters will get some stigma for falling off in later raids too so in either case you'll have to support yourself with good networking.
---
As for your friends - what's not to like about leveling with a druid? You tank, you heal, you hardly fight for gear unless they're rogues and hunters. Only real problem is you don't have a normal resurrect. 
---
Ran a druid as my first character and I made a lot of friends PvP healing. It's really fun in BGs.
---
Yea I have no doubt that it is better for leveling, similar to the talent point system. You can absolutely see the impact that those blue and green drops have. I'm more curious about at endgame where I intent to spend the vast majority of my time. Not trying to knock it or anything, it will just be interesting to experience and see for myself.
---
I didn't even think about that even though I do have a second monitor setup by me. Even better I might actually make use of my iPad.
---
No it's a matter of having a full bis set at lvl 30 or not. Sure you can do sm in greens but not as fast/efficiently as you see the streamers doing it.
---
Nope, and it's because what other mmorpg hit 14/15+ million subscribers at $15/month?
---
The reason people pay for the cost is ~ quality of content.
---
Wow blew up and died out because of the quality of content.
---
Classic represents this starting point, the root of that crazy # of subscribers - only a small % of that really remembers the first couple of years of vanilla and those growing pains.
---
The best part about Classic is that those little things that made Vanilla special won't be able to be recaptured or experienced in 2019.
---
So anyone that started after Vanilla will be able to experience a polished Vanilla morso than experience what we (anyone that played vanilla) experienced.
---
So while I believe that classic is going to be the superior game to any of their expansions - I'd say most people will enjoy Classic but still have those fond memories that won't ever be written over, while newer players will just be able to enjoy wow in it's infancy :)
---
not so loud
---
you dont need to yell
---
OR you can have dual monitors! 
---
I heard Apple just came out with a stand for a new one to.
---
But really dual monitors is the way to go. Go to your local community college and see if they are going to be getting rid of any and see if you can buy one for cheap. May need to get an adapter depending on how old they are.
---
The gaming industry kinda cornered itself, design wise. Games nowadays all rely on providing instant gratification to keep players attention against a huge number of other games in an oversaturated market.
---
14 years ago, things like "Achivements" and other "Rewards" for basically just playing the game, didn't exist. The benefit of playing a game was...well, playing a game. Today, those design elements are ubiquitous, because even AAA studios took lessons from the success of mobile and browser games (where these mechanisms originally became widespread).
---
The problem with this is, it creates games that burn people out quickly, and since games frontload their content on the player, and make everything about YOU being the greatest thing since sliced bread, it destroys the sense of community, and with it any chance for social- aka. player-driven gameplay, resulting in an era of what are essentially Theme park games.
---
Despite all that however, all this virtual attention whoring, the industry stagnates. They are looking for ways out of this trap.
---
And Classic WoW could lead the way, by showing that a AAA title that partakes in none of these design philosophies, that is unapologetic, doesn't frontload its content, is not monetized other than by subscription fees and relies heavily on social interaction, can be financially successful.
---
That, for me personally, is the primary reason why I hope that classic becomes a huge success...to wake up the gaming industry.
---
Lots of weapons out-dps’d hand of rag
---
Alt-F4
---
Getting paid to post right now, jealous?
---
Blood elves and draeni and their starting zones plz
---
Same old bs rehashed over and over and extended into just-about-10-minute-long-😉 videos packed with filler, by wasters hoping to cash in on the hype.
---
There are exceptions of course, but few and far between.
---
Dragonmaw. Great guild drama between Horde and Alliance. Sunshine Squad, Hellmonkey, Silly Hats Only, Prominence. Also, some major playaz like Grievous, Zizek, Warla, Joeh, Loganz. The forums were a real fun place
---
It's not impossible but improbable.
---
Why not just ignore the post then?
---
Lol dual.. casual
---
Why make it so confusing? Just click your abilities with you mouse when you need to use them.
---
please, rift went F2P 1 year after launch, there isn't enough fan base to warrant a server from the original Rift in 2011.
---
/dnd sorry no shards
---
I'm absolutely torn between an priest or a mage. I never played classic, but I played mainly healers in WotLK (priest, shaman, druid)
---
I like the idea of being a mage and it seems fun to level, but are they fun for end content fun as well?
---
Day 7 or 8 people will probably be forced into SM or just sit on their hands while trying to quest.
---
First wave of 30s and 40s will be fine, second wave probably too - once the core group of people get there it will be a bottleneck just like launch.
---
Kinda strange that this comment is so far down.  Reading through others, people dont seem to understand that at all lol
---
Not necessarily a relaunch. Classic WoW is wildly different from most modern mmorpgs. If developers notice that classic is a success long term, it’ll force them to review their games. What makes classic wow so good? They’re gonna have to take a look at that to be able to compete, which is good for the gaming industry as a whole. It’s a chance to step away from predatory business behavior that has been growing rampant these last few years. But then again, little will probably change.
---
People ask repetitious questions because they want human interaction and connection over a topic they enjoy...or because they're lazy af. Majority ain't gonna look for the questions.
---
How else do I convey my excitement.
---
Thats the nice way of saying 'its shit'
---
It's for my pet.
---
“I want to shit on kids while leveling and be rewarded for it”
---
Such gold haha this is great
---
I’d say anything + engineering and drop the ‘anything’ when ZG comes out to go tailoring for the bloodvine set bonus.
---
I remember back in 2006/7 when G4TV mentioned the nude addon. First think I did was MSN search for it and install.
---
The fastest people can move, the fastest world gets empty
---
Skinning/leatherworking are just money makers, not good in pvp. You definitely want grenades to cover your deadzone.
---
I remember seeing a decent amount of hunters with Zin'Rohk, Destroyer of Worlds, back in vanilla. Iirc it was quite the huntard weapon cause it have flat out AP but not much else?
---
Azgalor, where Kazzak got one shot by a paladin with reckoning and resulted in a hotfix to reckoning stacking.
---
LFG-tool will not make it classic, dunno where you heard that, but it aint true.
---
Alchemy. You want mana potions.
---
This also means that if you get a shit group and keep wiping you're locked in this dungeon with them. Something keeps doing wrong, maybe the tank or healer are shit and you just can't get it right. But what can you do? Leave, waste everyone's time and be seen as a dick? Or stay and wipe endlessly in a group that just doesn't cut it? There are two sides
---
Cleanse costs 8% of base mana pretty sure which is still less than dots but not that close to free. If we cycle dots between the warrior and paladin we can easily have 5 to 6 debuffs that are dispellable, up to 8 or 9. It would take 9 secs to dispel just the warriors in that time we can full dot the paladin and then switch back to the warrior. He cant keep up with our debuffs. Eventually he will have to heal. Between the two of us we have a 2-6 second counterspell/silence from the fel puppy and 4 seconds from my priest silence. Plus a 2 second death coil we can easily blow his bubble then continue to out dot him will kiting the warrior
---
Too bad its beta and doesn't really matter lol
---
We did have dual monitors back then....
---
They never work honestly. I have never seen a large subreddit where a sticky answering questions even put a dent in the number of repeated questions.
---
If the actual raid/dungeon doesn't change then I don't see where there would be a problem. It's about as innocuous as blizzard using the new loading screens for the classic raids/dungeons and I haven't seen anybody complaining about those yet (though I'm sure they exist).
---
fair enough lol
---
I'm just not a fan of the mentality that one fanbase has to rip the other experience to justify praise. I'm probably going to sink a lot of time into Classic, but there are aspects of Retail I'd like to keep doing. I've immensely enjoyed running Mythic+ dungeons and would like to continue doing so, especially because I don't often have time to dedicate a couple hours+ to the game.
---
Is there a realistic chance this will drop for a casual raider
---
This is unique because the MMO genre is fairly subdued.  There aren't a whole lot of A-list games in this regard.
---
Other old games that get re-released, are usually in one of a few categories:
---
1. A port to a new platform (i.e. releasing for Switch what was available on Wii-U or on N64)
---
2. A re-master of an existing game (Starcraft Remastered) which comes with graphics updates and a new aspect ratio
---
3. A patch for an old game which makes it playable on modern graphics cards (i.e. a patch for Descent which allows it to be played on a 3D graphics card without speeding up the game to an unplayable level)
---
In most cases, the re-release is about taking a game that people can already play, and making it playable in more places.  You could build an old computer and play Descent.  You can play Starcraft on a computer with a 16:9 aspect ratio, and just play it with a 4:3 resolution and just not use the sides of your monitor.  You can play Mario Kart on your Wii-U after buying a Switch.
---
These ports, re-masters, and patches are not the same as re-releasing Classic WoW, because nobody can legally play Classic WoW.  For those that play it illegally, even on the best servers, there exist several issues that make it not quite Classic, such as bugs with player abilities, NPC AI, dungeon triggers, and even mob abilities.
---
So even though I can play World of Warcraft, it's not the same because the game has changed.  Starcraft players can play Starcraft without Brood War, but WoW players can only play BFA.  Even though I could log into a Private server, there will be some things that aren't quite right.
---
Classic WoW is more than just a port, a re-master, or a patch.  It is a unique scenario to a unique market.
---
So true 😀
---
I live in a studio apartment, already pretty strapped for space.
---
Says the dog pretending to be a human on the internet.
---
i would go alchemy instead, you make up way more spellpower and buffs with that, than you can do with proffesions as a moonkin.  
---
After all at the end of the day, even if you instance or raid you will need on cloth dps gear.
---
Thank god i love Path of Exile too, new league tomorrow hype.
---
So no turtle mount?
---
Obvious fake. Neither "Linkin Park", nor "Disturbed" as background music, 100% no Vanilla confirmed :P
---
I was that warrior in vanilla. Because everyone turned on me because i loved to dps as arms i went pvp. 
---
It was best time in vaniila for me. I  was rank 13 and everyone respected me. I was even invited to raid now and then. To be honest for last 15 years i played arms warrior mainly pvp :D 
---
So yeah you can play as yo uwant but you need to work ekstra hard if you want to be invited to raids.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only person doing this...
---
So we don’t know exactly yet?Doesnt the phases they are doing indicate that they will slowly release the raid bosses from one expansion at a time?
---
Honestly tabbing out of game and looking it up on your computer is faster.
---
It's not like computers these days take 2minutes to open up the game again.
---
&gt; If there were no streamers, but the game enabled some sort of native third party viewing, the issue is exactly the same.
---
An irrelevant hypothetical doesn't really make a good case.
---
Streamers didn't exist in vanilla.. and vanilla wasn't built to cater to them.
---
Now I actually don't mind changes to vanilla to make it better, even ones that help streamers produce better content, but it's not my fault the nochanges crowd exists. What pisses me off is when the nochanges crowd selectively ignores their doctrine for the benefit of streamers.
---
You can't have it both ways. You either take vanilla with its warts, which means streamers don't get special treatment, or you allow for changes to make the game better so streamers don't *need* special treatment. 
---
Like you could make an instanced arena area to hold arena tournaments and it would have no effect on the world. No problem, but hey nochanges-warts-and-all amirite?
---
Useful before you have the FP, swag after you have the FP
---
The rank 13 PVP gear was better than raid stuff
---
Yes, but I am a diplomat (lying bastard) at heart.
---
You gotta merge those by tricking her to join you playing Classic!
---
Nope my crew are running a good mix thankfully. Warrior -me. My brother is playing a paladin. Wife is playing hunter (probably) other friends playing priests, mages, lock and Druid. At least that’s the current plan. Launch day we could have a guild full of rogues heh.
---
Alchemy, you will need mana potions and alot of em
---
My friend once bought gold for real money and received an email from blizzard with a ban. I don't remember the duration, it was in cata.
---
&gt; Quest reasonably - I agree if that means we'll be able to complete the starter zone in 3.5 hours.
---
Fedex does 1-10 in about 3.5 hours.
---
Alchemy, as you will always be OOM
---
Well, you're going to be drinking several stacks of Mana Potions each raid to stay above Hunter pets on the DPS meters, so you might as well go Alchemy.
---
Have the 2nd one on top of the main.
---
Is that with or without a flying sombrero?
---
This is my most favorite part of playing wow. Podcasts and farming. Or discord with an active group/guild and mindlessly farming. I even enjoy fishing. I can’t do this with other games.
---
Hi, /u/SC_x_Conster
---
Came here to basically say that.
---
I am pretty sure you need an active sub to get beta, unless you are a streamer maybe.
---
Garithos
---
Was named after a racist.
---
Wonder how many of them warriors gonna make it to 60 lol
---
If it weren't for "private server scum" you wouldn't be getting Classic in the first place.
---
&gt; Yeah, but so will the 1.12.1 itemization do anyways
---
But nowhere near to the extend as the PvP sets.
---
I'm thinking of trying a new class once classic comes out. I was thinking of trying feral. Is it even worth trying, or is it that bad?
---
The only reason these zones are so congested is because everyone is already lvl 30. On actual release everyone will be hitting lvl 30-40 zones at very different times so congestion shouldnt be expected.
---
Go up to the address bar in your browser and delete the /r/classicwow portion or this site address and click enter. There are many other things out there to browse.
---
But you just have the fp to org by default, even before zeppelin came to TB
---
I would prefer in-game sound and maybe some commentary instead of this, music?
---
If they do this I hope they do a zero version for the 30 yo boomers who got the beetus from too much code red in their 20's.
---
working up some flextime for vanilla.
---
But wait maybe I'll want blessing of sanctuary on my tank...
---
But wait maybe I'll want holy shock for the emergency heal...
---
But wait maybe I'll want blessing of sanctuary for AoE grinds...
---
But wait...
---
Last point of Paladin spec is hell
---
No, definitely be grouped. The main thing is just grinding to and from quest locations. Just kill as you go, and you shouldn't be getting behind. You can also pickup all the early dungeon quests and run those together to get a level or two.
---
 &gt;my lvl 20-30 ass shitting on comparable lvl alliance shitstains in Ashenvale/STV
---
Thanks for showing everyone what a mature person you are, and how serious we should be about anything you say.
---
Got any tips, video links or something?
---
8% of base mana translates into like 40 mana. Iv'e played a paladin the spell is basically free. Your also theory crafting a mythical fight. I'm not saying a paladin can't lose. So I'm not sure why you are doing that. My only point was of all of the support classes they are the most resilient to getting CC'd.
---
How is that any faster than just simply alt tabbing?
---
Phases are to split up the content patches the game went through originally and give us the opportunity to gear up through each raid. It doesn’t have anything g to do with tbc or beyond
---
I sure hope WildStar comes back to life. That game as fun as hell. The combat was amazing.
---
That’s odd because I thought it was specifically Kevin Jordan who stated that he fully expected blizzard to have higher realm caps this go around than previously.
---
The hardest time you’ll ever have playing a hunter is in PvP like any other class. When someone is coming at you it’s easy to choke and not use your best abilities to deal with the situation. Hunters are like this. It’s easy to be bad at hunter in PvP, backpedaling etc. Make sure you know how to use traps effectively, poison rogues so they can’t go back into stealth, kite melee classes and even some casters for that matter. 
---
It’s not like it’s rocket science. Spend a day fooling around on a hunter and you’ll be better. Spend a few days and you’ll be good. 
---
Hunter is more engaging in end game PvE content, where as mage is (kind of) frostbolt spam. 
---
I would honestly say pick Hunter. It seems like you will have more fun overall, just make sure to have control of your pet, use traps, and understand all of your abilities and how they can be used against each class (wingclip in melee range, when to feign death, etc.) 
---
You’ll be fine either way.
---
1. Just the engineers
---
2. yes they do. wiped on them last night
---
Change that monster to coffee, do yourself a favor lol
---
Ha! I don’t have that problem! But that’s because none of my irl friends play.... *despair*
---
Preraid 2 is stage two when world bosses + Dire Maul are added.
---
I generally have that problem, and that is one of many, many reasons that I heal.
---
I've looked for hours on end, but can't seem to find this anywhere..
---
I got into the Beta, I really only use it to test things we weren't sure about on Pservers and to work on addons.
---
Most of my guild's time is spent on Pservers still, practicing my route. Being able to copy characters is much faster when trying to stay under 100 hours /played to 60.
---
Grab your sword and fight the Horde!
---
I've never even heard of either of them. WoW Classic is the original World of Warcraft game, based on patch 1.12. When WoW released it was designed to be a more casual counterpart to Everquest.
---
It's a fantasy setting with magic, orcs, dragons, and elves. It's typical western fantasy fare, rather than eastern. It can be grindy, you have to level weapon skills to use weapons effectively, hunters have to bond with and take care of their pets, you have to have reagents in your inventory to cast certain spells, quests are more spread out rather than existing in convenient hubs on rails. It feels less linear even though it is in fact rather linear. There's quite a bit of RPG though clunky by today's standards (wow has always been clunky though).
---
At $15/month it's a pretty cheap source of entertainment. I suggest giving it a try.
---
I can handle the male animations for hunters and rogues. I can’t for a warrior. I don’t know how I leveled my warrior in vanilla looking back now.
---
Ald! You're remembering everything there correctly, we were a boss or two behind Pantheon for most of classic, we were usually a top 5 guild while top 3 was Adrastus/PoorPlay, Union, Pantheon.
---
We have a pretty decent collection of vanilla Uldum players we still game together. Toutprest, Falkuron, Atalanta, plenty others. I'll PM you a discord invite if you're interested.
---
Good to hear from you and glad everything is going well. Completely understand not playing classic, but selfishly I hope you change your mind!
---
Things were different back then, I never got close to 50 when playing Vanilla thru WoTLK.
---
On pservers it didn't even take me two weeks to get there, relentless spam can mean a number of things.   
---
If they're begging for handouts repeatedly in the world/trade channels - they get blocked.  
---
If they're spamming text macros non-stop and making it difficult to read any other messages in the game - they get blocked.
---
Then I also block people for ninja looting, or intentionally causing wipes in dungeons, those are the most common reasons.
---
Just above that is a link to click on that explains it...
---
I want toggle. personaly i want hd models but i know that some of players want old ones. It is not a crime.
---
Some of them get paid 100s of dollars a day to stream, I think they will be fine. Classic is about grinding, if you burn out in a couple of months it’s probably going to happen at release. I’m in the beta and just see it as a 3 month league (I’ve been playing PoE since it’s beta) so it’s not so bad.
---
i enjoy some of the streamers a bunch, one has my prime right now, but i still have some issues with them.  
---
the big one for me right now is the fact they are trying to trap people on their servers. Planning to hide their server choices so people can't consciously avoid them.  
---
One could make the argument that they deserve an organically populated server just like any other player, but that arguement falls completely on its ass when you realize they are purposely avoiding each other for the same reason we're trying to avoid them.  
---
Its a total dick move.
---
This is a really great drawing tbh. I couldn't come close to it
---
Yes please. The other guys UI looked like such a clusterfuck of spells. This is nice
---
I honestly don't understand why you keep turning this into a discussion about the streamers. It didn't hurt or help them that this happened. All it did was screw Cdew and all of the viewers. No one left the streams. The griefing rules I threw out have nothing to do with benefitting or catering to streamers. It feels like we're talking about different things.
---
And not that it matters, but I'm far from no changes. I just want a game that feels like vanilla. I've been playing on private servers so I've played literal classic to death. I'd love to see an OSRS situation.
---
It’s the last boss is BWL (Tier 2) that drops this bad boy. BWL is definitely a lot harder than MC or Ony but it’s definitely not as hardcore as AQ40 or Naxx. I would say if you’re okay with raiding twice a week then you shouldn’t have any difficulties with killing Nef weekly. At that point it’s just luck. More time you put in your guild and towards raid contributions (damage, consumes, not dying, etc) then it could increase the chance a little. It depends on the guild.
---
I decided to roll Priest now in Classic but sometimes I would change my mind due to these polls. But what the heck. I realised I want to play the damn class very much and it really doesnt matter what the polls say, because if you're having fun and want to be good at your class I dont see why you wouldnt find a like-minded guild.
---
I played a Nelf Hunter, lol, probably the most over saturated class there was on that private server I was on and I still got into a good raiding guild. Dont worry about it too much, if a pserver hardcore guild can take a random Hunter on a 10k pop server then Im sure you will find a guild regardless of the population of said class. People always come and go for the first few months; you will be needed and if you're active, you will be rewarded. 
---
The demand is always there, especially for Shamans, just be nice person to be around, try to always improve yourself when you make mistakes and you WILL find people that will take you.
---
In a world of Chads, be a Gamer Dad
---
Ah the good ol days when your healer rage quit because he didn’t know a patrol was going to come up behind him while he was drinking.

---
Mountain dew Bourbon blast? Now we're talking...
---
Awesome!! I recognized it right away, you definitely didn't need the label. Really cool, I love how you didn't skip any of the little details.
---
Hahahahaha
---
IMO it's not just the relaunch of a old game that's stake here. Other developers will be closely watching the numbers for a different reason. For years now many players (though not all) have been lamenting the lack of truly engaging gameplay elements and the intrusion of micro-transactions &amp; cash shops.
---
Game sales have slowed recently and a number of AAA releases have done very poorly and not just in the online category. Devs, and investors, are keen to know if the players who are demanding a better gaming experience will actually put their money down when the product they've been asking for is on the shelf.
---
I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating when I say I believe that the future *direction* of online gaming in particular, and gaming in general, is riding on the reception we give to WoW Classic.
---
Thanks :D
---
Ah, that Wetlands bag quest...
---
Currently working on my MBA part time...I'm cramming two summer classes in before August 27th so I can take less classes during the Spring/Fall :)  taking 1 class in the fall/spring (1 night a week, less work to do on the weekend) will be 100x easier than taking two classes (two nights a week, lots of work on the weekend).  And playing league of legends when I have some spare time 
---
I wont have as much time to play as most people but plan to enjoy the leveling and just PvP.  Rolling hunter for pet rpg elements/epik 1v1 outplay potential/high skill ceiling.  I'm not concerned with PVE dps killing dragons doesnt do much for me anymore.  R1/Gladiator in retail hoping to have fun by just outskilling people in wpvp/bgs
---
The corpse run on BRD is insanely long so a druid would want enhancement shaman/shadow priest with them, unless it's an expert group that rarely dies.
---
Stealth, humanoid tracking, aquatic form are all extremely useful in world pvp. I remember chinese gold farmers were often druids because they could use acquatic form to farm underwater nodes quickly.
---
Shaman's 30/0/21 build puts you in a unique position to solo farm/pvp and still raid heal. Not having mana tide should slide for a while as long as your guild tolerates it.
---
It might be a few weeks for the in-depth Mage guide, but DPS warrior and warlock should be up very soon!
---
Yeah, I have beta and already stopped playing. Submitted a couple of low level bug reports. Hopefully it helped.
---
Good call out. Thank you for bringing this up. Although they have already confirmed it won't be in, doesn't stop them from changing their minds a year and a half from now.
---
#TeamNoCashShop
---
It's just for fun. Cant play yet so I'm imagining fights against different combos. I've just heard a lot about the cleanse meta and how it shuts down spriests and stuff. Seems reasonable in big team fights but not small isolated fights. You would spend the whole fight casting cleanse and nothing else. And if you show that will cleanse anything and everything then you can start casting rank one spells. 
---
I agree that paladins are hard to cc. I used to play a pally as well but not as holy. I know that their strength is basically being unkillable and just annoying to deal with. Since we will be horde I thought it would be best to plan and be prepared for them
---
Difference between mages and warlocks....
---
Mages are anti-social miscreants who push party members away from them.
---
Warlocks are kind gentle beings who bring distant party members closer together.
---
Thank you very much for your input. One of the concerns was the "difficulty". 
---
As long as it's not annoying to play and I don't get a feeling of "I'm putting in all this work for nothing" I think I'll have fun with a hunter.
---
Yup!!! Had to keep your eyes on the patrolling group who reapawn quickly 😂👍
---
With more data inevitably down the road... I'm sure we'll find out haha
---
#nobetaclub and not even subbed ? No way!

Alleria US home of Risen, Premonition, and massive fucking server lag.

Just play tank and screech in voice chat. I thought zach just did it for the stream but it seems like there is something about being the guy willing to mt+yelling at people that at least gets you the semblance of a team comp together

There's already at least 2 that I know of.  I think a LFG addon is pretty much going to happen at this point.

alt+tab ...

So happy that xmog is not in classic. Thats partially what made vanilla-wotlk so awesome. Your gear truly reflected how much work you put in.
---
Just appear offline before logging on to your bank alt...
---
Kinda sad to pay a double sub for that
---
Yeah the EXP is around half + X with 2 people (so if mob gives 100 XP you get ~ 60 XP with 2 people) &lt;&lt; estimate.
---
I would recommend doing the start zones solo (Dwarf can do Dun Morogh + Loch Modan, Human can do Elwynn + Westfall) and then meetup around that time.
---

yikes

Holy shit

What exactly is bad besides rule 2? Rule 3 is against reddit's rules themselves. Rule 4 is the only way the official company, in this case Blizzard, will have anything to do with the sub. Rule 5 is here so we don't have to hear about Trump or Anti-Trump shit in every thread. Rule 6 is here because this isn't a porn subreddit and Rule 7 is a basic rule to keep a subreddit from being a garbage pit that only five people ever visit. Not having something similar to Rule 7 literally kills subs and causes multiple alternates to pop up, splitting the community.
---
I love insulting people too, so I think rule 2 is just fucking ridiculous, but all subs are doing it now, the ones related to games anyway, so it's pretty standard fare. If this was the only gaming sub that did that, I'd understand, but they aren't doing anything different so I'm not going to get upset about it.
---
Or soulstone, or paladin bubble, or shaman self rez, or parachute cloak, or levitate, or ....
---
I've started to lay this foundation....
---
Thanks I am a fool
---
I used to use an addon Called playerNote back in the day, but all I could find was something called ct playernote, might be the same thing, it does exactly what you are looking for.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyAddons/comments/5r3db6/addon_to_set_notes_on_friends/?amp_js_v=0.1&amp;usqp=mq331AQCKAE%3D
---
Yeah because of mods removing the trash
---
Your guild will only bring one shadow priest so mage is a safer bet if raiding with a pvp spec is important to you.
---
Put this in perspective, I’m on the beta doing the same thing (no quest guides, keeping up blacksmithing and mining, haven’t played Vanilla since Vanilla no private servers or trips through during new expansions) and am at around 2 days 4 hours and am level 26....
---
Tailoring and herbalism, find an alchemist to make potions for you.
---
I answered that on my last Post. You speedrun it, perfectioning your Route and Pulling. Compete with other Guilds for the fastest clears, fastest boss kills, as an individual the highest DPS on this particular Boss or overall the Raid.
---
Also in Vanilla you won't run out of things to do. Alone grinding Silithus and AD Rep is huge. (Preparing for the next Raids), Scouting for World-Bosses is a 24/7 Task that is done in Shifts
---
Well obviously the apple stand! Then I can start saving for the monitor to put on it! Then I can start playing wow on an apple monitor. On an apple stand! How fricking cool is that!?
---
Or are too cheap to pay for the flight point.
---
Are you sure about that?  In an age where remasters are ever increasing you think no one would have run the numbers and proposed the idea a little bit down the line?  I don't doubt the exposure from the Nostalrius shut down had a little nudge, but believing that this entire endeavor was set into motion because of private server players is nothing short of preposterous.  Companies don't make decisions based on wishful thinking, they run numbers and look for profit.
---
Oh god, please no.  Story time:  When I was about 7 years old, I was playing outside my grandma's house.  It was a hot day, so after awhile I came inside to grab a drink.  My grandmother liked to drink her coffee, black, out of a Ball mason jar.  You know, the clear ones with the handle?  Well, to a thirsty, chubby 7-year-old, black coffee looks a LOT like Pepsi.  Dying of thirst, I grabbed the glass, and proceeded to chug.  After about 2 swallows, I realized that this is certainly not Pepsi, and instantly projectile vomited back into the jar, and across the kitchen floor.
---
From that point forward, I vowed to never drink coffee for the rest of my life.
---
Well, we now know Tips will do just about anything for money, including defraud the government, and since the final duel had to be restarted because he was running ads on his stream... yeah, I'd say there's a good chance.
---
Yeah. Google search runner's knot or "heel hook". Run on the balls of your feet. That's the padded part or the fore foot. Do not roll back on your heels. Running this way will make your calves sore for a while but once they get conditioned, you'll notice that it takes that wear off your knees and you won't tire as easily. Breathe with a rhythm and breathe steadily. You also want to smooth out your steps and try not to bounce. Keep your strides even in length.
---
Studies and mainstream media coverage doesn't mean shit to me. People say everything is bad for you these days. Who knows what to believe?
---
All I know is, I'm not gonna stop eating and drinking everything I've liked my whole life just because we're now living in an age where studies apparently show all this stuff is bad for you.
---
Alcohol is literal poison you're pouring into your body, and people haven't stopped drinking alcohol yet.

Priest and mages share bis items in the following slots in phase 1: legs, boots, neck, 1 trinket, bracers and realistically shoulders as most mages will not bother to get the boreal mantle. So that is 6 items, which is not an insignificant number of items.
---
I have a PDF version of this one and other art books too, if anyone is interested just email me at [rosenbergwatson@gmail.com](mailto:rosenbergwatson@gmail.com)
---
Having twitch is amazing going back to vanilla, being able to mindlessly grind mobs while watching an entertaining streamer on your other monitor takes a lot of the mind numbing parts of the game away.
---
I read it as if you get an invite you'll need a sub to play. Seems clear as day. Opting in is the main way to get an invite. They had to say main way because they knew people would bitch about streamers getting invited. You lot really think that a few dozen streamers bumped your invite out of the pile? Get real.
---
I like key binding everything, this is especially important for any ability or action that I may use in combat. But even for things like professions it’s still faster to keybind even if it doesn’t matter that much. It feels good to be able to use any ability or action or whatever quickly. Also keybinds aren’t that hard to memorize once you get used to them so for me it doesn’t over complicate things at all.
---
Thank you!

Just create a macro:

That would be a pass from me.

i woulda told him to fuck off.

Be careful to not fuck your productivity living wow classic through streams all afternoon. I noticed i was doing that after 4 consecutive days of zero productivity
---
After accidentaly pressing alt+f4 I never key bind alt again :d
---
Personally my goal is r11 for the mount, not even gonna kid myself about going for r14. I’ve heard mixed things but it seems like the grind up to 10/11 isn’t nearly as bad as 12-14, but I have no idea. I hit r8 playing very casually back in the day.
---
Pikachu face. :O
---
Play what you want.
---
But don't expect other to want to raid with you.
---
I looked at old census info from 2005 and it appears, other than mage/hunter it’s only a 1%-3% variance across the classes. A lot of that is due probably to spec pigeon-holing. If you are a warrior and want to raid you are MOST likely rank, a priest is MOST likely not shadow, a shaman is MOST likely resto etc.
---
Also races play a role - if you are horde and hate taurens then you are not a Druid, if you are alliance and like gnome you have 4 choices etc.  
---
Be a female troll warrior and you will be the rarest of them all though!
---
Aye! The last league. After that, I'll be able to say I quit Legion to play Classic :)
---
Yeah tons.
---
This is my goal exactly :)
---
So what you are saying is I should sub for more than 1 month at a time for classic's launch because Blizz/Activision will notice us more?
---
Yeah, HoJ moved to the final boss because a couple rogues could solo Angerforge and farm for it.
---
*”Tuyo” from Narcos plays in the background*
---
Just seems kinda sad:(
---
Having to get tranq shot as a DROP! Lol.
---
I think it does, the feeling of meeting up with your group at the FP in EPL and all mounting up and moving together, having a few opposite faction encounters on the way is quite likely. The constant battle of the gate at Stratholme. It gives time to form bonds with the pugs your about to play with before delving into the dungeon imo; then if somebody DC's and you need to find a new 5th, 2 or 3 of your move out to the front of the instance, maybe meet the guy half way. Its a much more involved version of grouping, and is one of the many reasons people say classic is a more sociable experience.
---
This will be in vanilla?! I did it in t

It's from the WoW Mosaic ( [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Wallpaper#/media/File:WoW\_Mosaic.jpg](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Wallpaper#/media/File:WoW_Mosaic.jpg) ).

The other big problem with trying to keep up with professions on retail is you cant just go  quest for a few levels and then go back to farm stuff easier.  With level scaling youre fucked on all stages of vanilla professions until youre past 60, BC/Wrath until after 80, etc.
---
Keeping up with the professions is also harder than it 'could be' because you are spending less time in the level range you need to be, so theres a lot of supplemental farming (depending on what youre doing for professions...tailoring/enchanting has sucked that way.  Not enough quest rewards to DE) to keep the professions up to par.
---
Blackrock Mountain. Best place for rogues to hang out before raids.
---
I've also had 3 60s during retail vanilla. The only epics I ever received were gut rippers. And I remember correctly I had 8... Lulz
---
Eng. is mandatory, yes. You need to have the additional stun that bombs can bring. As well as the added damage. My advise would be, especially in a dual or BG scenario is just to make the battle as long as you can. You can live longer than he can.
---
As far as when someone tries to run, they will be successful alot of the time. Gap-closers like those found within ENG. help a ton with that.
---
That's all?
---
yep, you head it here first, alts is cheating.
---
Don't mind the Shimmering Flats grind too much due to this!
---
Unfortunately.....the leeeerrooooyyyy video lol. Laughing Skull NA baby 😋
---
The entire thing was set in motion over the Nostalrius drama, ensuing petition/private server player outrage, and the team who developed/ran Nostalrius giving a multiple-hours-long presentation to Blizzard executives making a case for the business-viability of re-releasing Classic.
---
It was the retail players who were perpetuating the "wall of no" if you don't recall. As well as Blizzard's continued stance over the years every time they were asked about it, up until the infamous Brack quote.
---
At the end of the day, the private server community shoved the issue into the fore and pushed it over the edge in a big way.
---
Why you feel the need to call these people "scum" , players who love Classic as much as you, is beyond me.
---
It's fine. Raiding guilds can easily afford one bear tank since they use unique gear and offer some utility with Leader of the Pack, but you'll likely be last in line for dps gear behind all the rogues.
---
On the way to 60 you'll be peachy too — druids are fast levelers, desirable group members (you fill all roles as a feral/resto hybrid), and have a fun world pvp toolkit (stealth, track humanoids, aquatic form).
---
The one thing I remember about Paladins is that god awful 8 second(or whatever) Stun, followed by a good ol butt hammerin' while they just stayed nice and healed up. &gt;\_&lt;
---
They had the entirely of the beta with everyone screaming about the dumb shit they went live with, then blizzard pulled a surprised Pikachu and didn't understand why people were upset.
---
BfA was a fucking disaster they could have easily averted.
---
Interrupts on R masterrace. Gap closers on F. Gap creators/cc on V.
---
&gt;buying the winter present packages, putting a blacksmith hammer in them, mailing them COD to people for 50 silver (curiosity is a powerful incentive)
---
that is brilliant lmao
---
If it is supposed to happen in 2+ years, it's a bit late to discuss it at that time.
---
I ran RFC last night, 2 shamans 2 warriors 1 Hunter.
---
Why would it be bad? Gearing them isn't straightforward, but they make amazing off tanks and can do average dps. They can do two rolls in one spec.
---
people will play shaman till level 10, change class, its like that all the time lol
---
Holy shit that is some beautiful copypasta. That guy really lost it. I love the guild beef between the trolls vs the tryhards
---
feeble peasant, tri monitor
---
People think BM Hunters will be strong, but Mages get Ice Barrier and Shatter. Last tourney a Mage won it without either of those. The Mage can Ice Block the Bestial Wrath duration and then easily win the duel.
---
The real problem is an extreme lack of communication from Blizzard. They are choosing to keep us in the dark. We get an advertisment disguised as a beta and they can't even keep us updated by spending 5 minutes on a weekly or even a monthly update
---
Shadowmoon PVP
---
The word "Prayer" strikes a special kind of fear into the horde...
---
&gt; Just loud annoying music that doesnt sync with the content is lowering the experience.
---
Thanks for helping me skip it.
---
Really good for hunters in PVP even after ZG is out
---
Better story, saw a guy extremely drunk and depressed slamming bourbon at a bar. Hours passed and he eventually confused his bourbon with his cig/dip cup. Slammed it back, paused, said "This isn't bourbon.", puked, then downed his bourbon. What I'm saying I think is never be afraid to climb back on the horse.
---
He pissed his pants later while sleeping standing up. ;D
---
Unfortunately it's real. They are really charging 1k for a damn monitor stand. (And it's not even made with/out of gold.)
---
Won't you have to spam the noggenfogger? i remember it being a random chance of slow fall, skeleton mode, or shrinking you.
---
that bearshare icon got me dying
---
It dropped from Angerforge for a long time. I stealth ran it with 2 other rogues.
---
You're*
---
Common man. Literally had to stop reading and downvote.
---
If I knew it was just going to be privileged streamers and people on the F&amp;F list, I wouldn't have bothered.
---
No chance. :(
---
Awesome!  I know it might not seem like much, but Deadmines is where my heart is, and no private server has done it right.
---
So they spawn when the boss dies, and spawn at the beginning of the dungeon?
---
Beta spots aren't limited. They can invite everyone they care to. No addon makers were refused by Blizz "because there wasn't enough room".
---
Blizz invited everyone they wanted to to actually work as their free quality assurance team, then they invited streamers to work as their free marketing team. It's as simple as that.
---
This is the first ‘am I the only one who’ thread where my first reaction was actually ‘yep, I think you are’
---
It sounds like paladin might be a good fit for you then. The good news is that you'll be doing a lot of that while leveling, in fact it's the most efficient way to play in leveling dungeons.
---
If you can stick with it at 60, eventually you will be geared enough again to pull it off. I would try to be the dedicated pally to judge wisdom if you want to throw in some attacks.
---
As for wanting to only wear plate/mail, most raids won't care as long as you're not healing in warrior gear. 
---
Finally, in pvp you have quite a few options. Even though I was deep holy, I still had seal of command and a spinal reaper. Small scale pvp always felt good since you didn't need to spam heals. I could freedom a warrior, pop a huge seal of command crit on his target, and then divine favor a holy light to heal someone to full.
---
I'll take that over my friends arguing over which faction and server to be on.
---
That being said, the warrior, shaman and druid are in for a treat when they hit 60.
---
I don’t know much about pvp but I’ll take your word for it. People usually underestimate hunter melee damage hella hard
---
To each their own, but IMO one button is easier to press than two :)
---
I only have two extra buttons on my mouse (+two standard and mousewheel), but I don't want more, my right hand is already too busy moving the buttons, and pressing the correct one would be too much for it :D
---
Ragefire Chasm That Goes Very eXtremely Zealous Quiet Everyone
---
by far my favorite zone in the game
---
yeah if they dont rework classes and only add in new raids/dungeons/bgs then I would personally want TBC. If they do classic+ they absolutely need to rework classes
---
Theory crafting 2v2 scenarios against different class combos. Fills up a lot of my time. Have to go and check spells and talents a bunch
---
not if your partner will play wow classic too!
---
I will have 9 cheat alts.
---
He still drops a decent pair of legs and sword for those stealth farmers!
---
I only played one in TBC I have no idea how to play one in classic I just know cleanse is basically free. Shadow priests generally get spanked by Paladins for the reason that. To play a shadow priest is like playing a Demigod. You are an unstoppable fuck machine right up until you run out of mana. The reason a Paladin winds up being your "kryptonite" pretty much just comes down to the fact that if he uses LOS and plays efficiently you will run out of juice. A shadow priest hits a big wall against a pally for the simple reason that SWP cost is like 450 mana, Vamp touch is like another 400 mana. Shield is costly as well. So you just kinda run outa juice.
---
Having Arena'd heavily in tbc. I can tell you for sure. Your best bet is to force the bubble then kill the paladin. Never make the mistake of thinking it would be easier to concentrate on the warrior. You'll run outa juice long before the Pally/War combo.
---
Because of lacking time ive switched class from Warrior to Warlock for the start of Classic. 
---
Going to play 40/60 PVE/PVP the most of the time. So some raids, a lot of dungeons, a lot of openPVP and BG's.
---
Is Warlock still fun when youre not t3 geared? Does it require at least t1/t2/etc. for him to stand a good chance in BGs and Dungeons? I guess I will raid MC/BWL/ONY and maybe AQ20 at least - not going to have time for the "time consuming" stuff. Maybe you could help me out, classic warlocks. :)
---
It has almost 300 hp/72 AP plus 25 agi enchant makes for a very good PVP weapon for hunters.
---
I used to like to fully gear rogues from deadmines.  Made a few characters specifically for that purpose.  By the time I'd hit level 24 or so (because you need 4 pieces off of Van Cleef alone, and more than half the group is rolling on those pieces) I'd get to the point I'd just go back and solo them.
---
I assumed you were coming from retail. Mobs can be level 40 for one player and level 60 for another player. I just installed retail to get a couple character to 20, to try and feel different classes. I only played vanilla and BC. I was really surprised by some of the new features. The dynamic mobs are kinda fun to level with friends and the players didn't disappears. I did not enjoyed the group finder and all the motorcycles and weird pets. Really broke the immersion. If you are aware on how leveling works that's fine. It will be a couple months to level this way. What is your experience with wow expansions?
---
build her a cool gaming computer
---
That's because the other businesses realized people are fucking stupid and will spend ungodly amounts of money for literally anything at this point. Even if something is a slight upgrade they'll throw money at them. It's ridiculous.
---
Feral is insanely fun to play.
---
&gt; I like the idea of being a mage and it seems fun to level, but are they fun for end content fun as well?
---
People make fun of their raid rotation but they're useful raid members especially later on. In dungeons they will always be desirable for free drinks and reliable CC, and they're one of the best classes at 1vX pvp for the same reason.
---
I cant really see it but it looks like it could be earth shield
---
Hybrids are great in dungeons though...
---
get a fucking house. Do you have any idea what is happening in roughly 2 and a half months? The greatest game of all time is coming out. You will need at least a 2 thousand square foot house so that you can store the months of food and mountain dew required to game for 18 hours straight. And have atleast 3 toilets so that as they break (from just the unholy shits you will be taking due to low quality prepackaged frozen foods) you can just move to the next one. Thats when the big yard also comes in to play, cuz if you wanna have any hopes at rank 14 or scarab lord you will be shitting in the yard eventually.
---
You also will need to tear down walls and make one mega room so you can just put your drinks aside as you finish them, maybe during flight you can clear the clutter
---
I mean, i wouldnt call this "good" but it's better than I could do so gj.
---
yeah im just jelly lol
---
If you don't understand context not sure what i can do about that. cya
---
Hate H and f1-12 binds they’re too awkward to hit tbh
---
Thanks for the reply. I know engineering is 100% THE pvp prof, but I was just hoping maybe there was something I was missing in the pally's toolkit.
---
The RP idea of an engineering paladin doesn't fully sit well with me, but to be honest, none of the profs really seem to fit paladin lore really, maybe enchanting... but you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
I'm just playing on a private server to get the rust off so im ready to level once it hits
---
I'm not 100 % sure on it , saying it mainly because i played a warrior. I did A LOT of BRD runs , from prequests to gearing myself and tanking it for nearly every guild member for prequests or gear. That beeing said i think Angelforge used to drop it early vanilla and it was swaped wit the tanking trinket that Emperor droped later on, due to it beeing quite op. Im saying that cause ive got this memory of rogues usualy leaving the group after you kill Angelforge...
---
maybe just on my server or something idk but the majority of progression in wrath was 25 first, 10man second, maybe outside of naxx.
---
some of the 10 man fights in ulduar were near un-beatable, and people switched to 25 man instead (the forgemaster guy and the dragon across the street specifically, i remember the 10 man version had to be patched)
---
idk about ICC, i stopped playing after ulduar, but the 25 man ulduar versions being easier, i thought, was widely accepted.
---
It's a scumbag thing to give people warnings and tell them they shouldnt do a specific thing because its not a great idea?
---
Just. Wow. I can only pray the rapture comes soon.
---
If you get a mage who keeps pulling when you/the group isnt ready just let them die. They will learn.
---
Alexa.  Did someone say Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
Fixed, sorry!
---
ekstra = extra in Polish ;d
---
Engineering, you can get mana potions through other means and Moonkin DPS is subpar, engineering can help to make up for this.
---
I never burn through /hot and rarely through /top.

I prefer /new all the time. This way I can avoid most stupid meme posts

TIL
---
Factorio!
---
The Staff from ZF doesn’t outclass Staff of Jordan, but it’s almkst as good. It’s so close that I would never consider buying Jordan.
---
Plus leveling slows down so much as you crest 20 and head to 30 that if you can make it to 30, you might just go the distance.
---
Yes. Yes we do. Excellent use of the throwaway account fellow redditor! Don’t forget to smash that upvote button.

Oh thats cool! Did not know that :)

Happy Cake day!

I've never heard edging used in a gaming context lol.

I bet 1g that it’ll be around 185k

What class do you play? Those are my raid times, Tues /Thurs and optional mon for progression

&gt; I don't know who taught you geometry, but where I come from, "the other side", in the context of a spheroid, usually refers to the single point on the surface that is r\*2 +- epsilon away 
---
You know that puts you somewhere in the ocean between antarctica and australia right, given you start from europe? Using mathematical terms only actually makes you look smart if you're actually correct, otherwise it makes you look like a dumb clueless kid, which you probably are, judging from the rest of your reply.
---
&gt;This may be hard for you to swallow, but there are people who are doing quite well in a confrontation.
---
&gt; Also, there is no better way for you to admit defeat, as telling me to go away based on your emotions :D

Did you copypaste that line from a star wars movie or something? Defeated at what? Acting like a moron?

Way to prove my point lmao.
---
Yes, we accept Discover.

As an "Every quarter refresher" I really think its not that bad.
---
Dual? Is this 2011? Do you not have 4+ with a VR headset?
---
I mainly cut energy drinks out of my life and other sugary drinks like coca cola etc. Food was never a big problem only thing i changed is basicsly no fast food.
---
So what should Blizzard have done instead?
---
So accurate it actually hurts lol
---
Should be able to do it in 2-3 weeks. Problem with Joana's guide is alot of people are going to use it. So when you have a quest that you need a certain npc for it may be better to just skip it and grind a few bars to make up for the XP
---
I just need more, now.
---
Just buy a house 4Head
---
one is talking about lvl 30 dungeons and one is talking about naxx/AQ
---
bad meme
---
Thank you! :D
---
Molten core it’s basically one button as frost spec. Pvp is a bit more involved. Later raids mage go fire which is the funner pve spec but there’s so funny business in terms to fire mage dps on the metres which can be off putting.
---
I will be entering my final year of college as well as playing Classic with three of my IRL friends.
---
 Our squad is 
---
Undead Mage - me 
---
Undead Warlock - friend 1 
---
Troll Shaman/Priest/Warrior - friend 2 
---
Troll Hunter/Priest - friend 3 
---
Only me and friend1 know our Race/Class combo for sure. It would be ideal if the two Trolls went Warrior/Priest. But knowing us we will probably be looking for a tank every time we want to dungeon lmao. 
---
Not sure for professions yet, but we all plan on getting different ones and using combined assets to craft each other gear, pots, enchants, etc.
---
I started playing a bit late and rolled on a newer server, Altar of Storms. Honestly, I don’t remember any interesting info about our server. Excited to start over again and be a part of the F R E S H server experience
---
It's not that you can't clear raids with hybrid dps. It's that most people want to clear their raids as fast as possible and don't want to carry
---
Hello!
---
I'm a russian player looking for the duo-partner to play at least 1-60, mostly for leveling.
---
Mainly looking for Vanilla player, since I've started playing at the end of BC.
---
As well as I highly recommend reading through the whole post, since I mention that my english is sub-par at it's best, so communication can be a bit off. The main thing why I'm looking for a partner in the reddit and english speaking (and not russian), because I want to improve my english. If it is not a problem for you - hit me up ;)
---
\- EU/NA, hard to say since I've no idea how ping goes for NA, but if it is decent -I'm up, otherwise EU (As for NA please, pay attention to my timezone below)
---
\- PvP
---
\- Honestly, I'd like to play H, but if my duo partner wants to play A, its no prob for me
---
\- Since I have a full-time job, my schedule is weird:
---
Monday to Thursday: 9/10PM - 12/1PM (UTC +3)
---
Friday: 9/10PM till the deep night, 3/4AM (UTC+3)
---
Weekends: w/e you up to, usually I'm not busy with something which can prevent me from playing 
---
\- Since I've not played Vanilla ever (I started playing at the end of BC), I'd like to play with the experienced Vanilla player, so he can teach me some tricks and such :) 
---
Not very fun fact, but I myself from Russia, so my English might be off and communication will not be that smooth, but we will improve through the time.
---
\- Hit me up in

WC3 is so good. I'm playing through it again, finally mustered up the will to just dive in and have my will broken (playing on Hard mode and I'm not really a big RTS pro), spent two hours on the TFT NE final mission last night. It's actually pretty straight-forward once you figure out a good strat for it, but god damn, controlling two different races with multiple different bases and fighting on three fronts at the same time... it's pretty friggin tough. It's so damn epic once it comes together though.
---
You rated warrior dps 5/10? 
---
I stopped reading at this. Dpsing as warrior is the most fun you can have in vanilla pve, and they are amazing at it.
---
You'll pay for it in layering
---
Our main start was going to be cc the dps and just mana drain the healer. Cause like you said my mana issues will be critical. But a priest/warlock could drain someone's mana real quick and basically make a paladin useless. That's when I remembered that fearing a warrior wasnt too reliable. I know that priest and pallys can dispel fear but it's a random dispel so with our other debuffs it's not guaranteed. As long as we can keep a.few debuffs on each person we should be able to reliably fear someone at least some of the time. 
---
Also I wont be full shadow unless I'm playing solo more like this https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMGsVboZfZVMgz0to
---
Should be able to maintain my mana a bit better like this and keep us both alive through most single dps combos while we slowly kill people with dots
---
Love this! Apparently poop socking isn't efficient enough for the new age of gaming.
---
How many warnings do they need?
---
My brother isn’t bothered about endgame but I am. That’s why I am tempted by priest.
---
I’m also tempted to just double hunter as it sounds fun to do together then use the end game for gold farming and using it for a alt character.
---
Sounds like this comment should be on r/me_irl
---
On second thought, let's not go to "New". Tis a silly place.
---
You do need to be subscribed to be invited.
---
I only see one realistic case for them: they need an awesome warrior tank as a friend. If a really good tank says this feral and this enhancer are my support to boost aggro generation, it would work out, I think. Everything else would be luck getting into the raid simply because they are warm bodies.
---
Stop yelling at me
---
It's more about the HP than melee damage. There are a few talents in survival that can give you increased crit chance on raptor strike that goes well with a big sword like ashkandi or zin'rokh though.
---
no it was in vanilla 
---

---
And the reason you don't bring hybrid isn't even about not being able to clear content, it's mostly just that you don't want the unnecessary difficulty just to carry some snowflakes through content.
---
Well, that's something. IDK what, but definitely something.
---
Requires lvl 46, says on the site (top right)
---
Horde and alliance competing for the same quests in a populated area. Simple math equation here. :)
---
To combat this, me and my duo partner will have alts. If the other person isn't online, you play your alt (or level professions, etc) It's doable!
---
Same. It's definitely a 10/10 DPS in (most)Raids when you're going Fury / Duel Wield with the right gear. Early on it might not be anything crazy, but later it's absolutely nutso assuming the Tank can keep their threat up enough.
---
time is money, friend
---
this was mostly because of lack of content. The start was amazing &amp; so was the game
---
You don't think that the hype will go insane-o mode as we get closer?
---
He can dispel a fear if he gets lucky. We will have anywhere from 5 to 9 debuffs on a target and cleanse/dispels are random so he wont always be able to stop fear
---
I've been dabbling on one even with the inconsistencies. Your points are all valid but let's face it I'm jonesing hard for classic so the pserver will do until then.
---
Stunlock Warrior was my jam
---
There's lots of dicussion about this since dps warriors are the definition of minmaxers, they take dps very very seriously.
---
Yeah at one point in time i was addictet to normal monsters it was like a fucking detox getting of off them but it was worth it. I know running can be a fucking pain but a few minutes before your exercise and over time you build up stamina. 
---
“Every day it gets a little easier… But you gotta do it every day — that's the hard part. But it does get easier.”
---
The meeting stones can still be used to summon with 2 players. It's always been a group finder too, but it never worked. The problem was two fold: first you have to click on the stone to join the dungeon group finder, second there is no role setting so groups would be made with 5 dps, no tank, no healer,  etc.
---
$1 Bob.
---
Huh! Never realized that was Azgalor.  That was my original home before my whole guild migrated to Mug'thol when they opened free realm transfer off of some of the most populated realms.
---
 [https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/classiclfg](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/classiclfg) 
---
This one seems to already be working.
---
Honestly I hope nobody does this unless they want to be labelled a madman.
---
If that is your strat and, I can't tell you if it would work. Make sure the dots you are putting on the warrior to "hide" your fear. Are all rank one dots. If they are going to be dispelled anyway. Don't piss away your mana. Hiding shit in rank one spells is a good thing to do in classic.
---
I think priests level disc/shadow for wand damage and minimal downtime. You can heal instances just fine with that spec.
---
If by "difficult to raid" you mean hard to get raid spots no, warlocks are very desirable raiding members because of summons, healthstones, soulstones, and banish. Later on their damage really ramps up even with the debuff limit.
---
For your style I'd say warlock will get you the best returns. Enjoying the class fantasy is reason enough but if you can tolerate raiding all the way to Naxx you'll become unstoppable. Priests can earn shadow gear very slowly while healing raids but it will be hard to get anything done outside of them with your raid spec, and you won't want to blow 100g respecing all the time.
---
At first this looked like the entrance to Strat dead, but now I see it.
---
I truly have not seen all this toxicity everyone keeps talking about.
---
i know but classic db has shown to have incorrect required levels on a lot of chain quests.  [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7541](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7541)  this quest for example is doable at lvl 30 on the beta and gave bis ring for lvl 30.
---
I'd think the moral of the story is "always read tool tips". After all, they show up for all of the bleach/water/portals/etc.
---
Ah, true. Believe it or not, it's been a while since I took that flight. :D
---
Try no carbs for a while and see how you feel. Stick to leafy greens and meat. Throw in a good bit of dietary fat with it like olive oil. Bread, potatoes, sugary fruits, etc. are a big part of weight gain. Overeating is worse though.
---
Yeah the fears would get used up quick but we also have 2 silences for caster healers with fel puppy and priest silence. Plus deathcoil is on it's own DR right? Beyond that we would have to work with curse of exhaustion and mindflay to kite melee
---
Yeah, me too, but its really bad.
---
Icy weapon and engineering.
---
I have that key as my auto run toggle and 1 as my mount. Should probably change that...

Y’all are my entertainment leading up to Jesus walking earth again ok Christ

---
This isn't class specific, people in high warlords gear and naxx gear are going to steamroll people who never go past BWL, warlock is no execption.  
---
In terms of rating it if you knew you were going to be behind your opponents gear, it would be medium ranked.  Mage, rogue, paladin(holy) least gear dependent, warrior, priest(for tanking) the most.  Warlock is somewhere in the middle.
---
This is so wrong if you really want to min max pvp. A lot of consumables need to be binded, need to bind your items lots using item rack to easily use trinkets, rocket helm, rocket boots, spider belt, skull if impending doom etc, as a mage I need need many r1 abilities binded for their utility in pvp, r1 buffs for purge protection etc... the list goes on. Some people that are truly trying to maximize their play style in certain environments require a lot of binds. Though even if all you did was PvE, every class needs a lot more than 10 binds If you are trying to play as effectively as possible.
---
Everyone has a lot of nostalgia for WotLK but that's when they implemented LFG and when new raids invalidated the previous which is what broke the community. I believe that's also when ilvl came out and gearing became a much more linear process.
---
It can be a nightmare to level there on either side as on a PvP server. When the dungeon set was king, I would camp my full dreadmist warlock there to protect my alt and friends. I remember trying to level a shaman there and this group of players camped at every angle. Icame back on my lock and murdered them.

If it's a true rerelease then sure.

Hard to be close to this scale when no other game was ever this scale.
---
Music and dragon whelpling pet grinding was how I spent all my non raid time, until my roommate and I rolled alliance pve alts to raid with other school mates.
---
Yes and no. Like I said the dispel is random so isnt really hiding them. Even if fear is cast last when a paladin casts cleanse it could dispel one of my stacks of shadow weaving. It would give us a huge amount of free time to mana drain if the paladin has to cast 3 or more cleanses just to get an 8 sec fear off
---
Adding "my opinion" won't save you from being criticized :P

But thank you for putting the effort, it's an interesting read.
---
I think melee weapons will suffice until the wands come down in price.
---
Yeah but you know where the dungeons/raids are. If you are clicking a flight path you know. If you are getting summoned you should be able to tell by the surroundings what zone you are in. If you can’t you either don’t pay attention or are absolutely clueless.
---
So the argument that “I don’t even know where the raids or dungeons are in retail.” Is one that someone who only does autoqueue content would use.
---
????   
---
Is this your first PvP Movie?
---
You won't be dps'ing as a Shaman, sry.
---
You can heal or heal. Sucks, but that's the attitude most are going to take.
---
Engi talior
---
I go out of my way to do retarded things on my hunter. All spirit, strength and int cloth/weapons.  Because it really doesn't matter for leveling, the hunter is still better solo than any other class
---
Pretty solid rundown for anyone not familiar with classic. 10/10 for effort. My only comment would be that the balance between melee and caster is skewed towards casters early and then toward melee as gear gets better, and I didn't see that brought up anywhere.
---
well that leaves rule 1!
---
Nice work, I’d be quite game to set up an anti-ganking squad protecting my factions lowbies.
---
Ares ofc , pl raiding was the best
---
This is also the same rule I follow. I use 1-5, shift 1-5, shift E, shift R, shift T, shift F, shift spacebar, ~, 
---
the back button on my mouse is ctrl because I hate having to reach ctrl 5. My pinky and pointer finger really have to stretch does that so I just have the mouse do ctrl and every thing listed above has a ctrl macro for it too.
---
I’m sure it’s just my twisted mind, but the inside design of the sword looks like a veiny erect penis.
---
Just skipped through the numbers and didnt bother to read after that since to me it seems wrong.
---
Appreciating taking your time and passion tho
---
Become Grand Marshal as a Ret Paladin.
---
This one, I'm sure, is a joke, it circulated around as a joke a lot before today.  Since MoP though, my UI has been looking pretty damn close with the sheer amount of stuff I need to track on my druid + fight specific mechanics though.
---
My dude Nogard getting some love. Good to see.
---
Gonna be a lonely journey for me. Lost touch with all of my friends that played back in the day. ☹️
---
&gt;My train of thought being, "Do you go back to MC when you hit Naxx? Do you go back to BWL if your entire guild is fully geared from AQ and some of Naxx?" I'm sure lots of raids do 
---
So, I'm curious, how much research did you do before you came to the conclusion that a guild raid would still regularly visit MC when they are in full 2.5 and partial Naxx?
---
40 man raids aren't super easy to organize, so I guess it's possible, but there is practically nothing of value in MC to anyone who is in 2.5 gear, and so very little incentive to run them.  I know my raid leader, by the time we were doing Naxx, was bored to tears in MC/BWL, and simply cut them out of the schedule to concentrate on AQ/Naxx.  As a main healer, I was totally down with that as well, since there was no gear left for me in either place.
---
Legendaries can't really be farmed for a whole raid, and the idea of a guild farming Naxx because one or more casters still want Atiesh is ridiculous, the pieces were rare drops, you might see, on average 1-2 a run and you needed 40 of them, that's 20-40 weeks of Naxx for a single staff.  Atiesh was something that a whole guild cooperated to give to a single, valued raider, not something that everyone could or can hope to obtain over time, unless your timeline is very, very long, and you are very well liked in your guild.
---
So if a hypothetical, classic 1.13 raid is giving out better gear than Naxx, the answer to your question is no, a guild already Naxx geared would probably stop running it.  Because you can only raid so many nights per week and with new content and gear available, people will switch to it almost exclusively.
---
I'll say three fiddy
---
Yeah that was my point of reference. Not the best idea
---
Some of these old videos are golden.
---
My favorite about druid -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kfr3602ANI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kfr3602ANI)
---
You're going to need a wand while leveling a priest, period. That said, some of the early wands that Enchanters can make aren't too expensive to craft and after you get past that point, many of the best wands at each level can be found as quest or dungeon loot such as the Gravestone Scepter. There will be a few wands you may want that are BOE but they aren't going to be mandatory.
---
Love this
---
Alright scientist take it easy ok
---
You'll most likely get stuck as healer with both for high end raiding. You might be able to get away with elemental shaman. Shaman is a great raid healer with healing wave. Priest is better at main tank healing.
---
Your raid damage healing is better than a priest, but your tank healing is not.
---
"They really thought playing since 2004 would mean anything!"

*Doesn't have a sub*

in depth
---
Oh good point
---
I'll be playing a priest at launch.
---
Im grabbing tailoring and alchemy so I can craft one asap.  Speeds up your leveling a good amount
---
The only rule I follow is rule 34
---
Except that most people who say hybrids hinder the raid group, aren’t just talking about AQ40 and Naxx, they are talking about all raids.
---
Play one handed without a keyboard, not without a mouse.
---
Oh yeh my bad, went straight over my head haha
---
Just buy one at level 5
---
depends on the guild
---
Are you referencing Daughters with the Let me in?
---
This is false. Guitar hero 1 came out before frets
---
1-2 weeks
---
How so?
---
So basically, use the Mythic dungeon method of making a group and having to travel to the instance, but apply it to all levels of dungeon?
---
But I think that'd just make dungeons get used less often, unless they went back to having quests that are part of the questing experience head into the dungeons.  Back in Classic days, you'd having multiple quests for each dungeon.  Now it's pretty much just one quest to kill the last boss, *maybe* an occasional profession quest.  Heck, they don't even have someone standing at the entrance to hand you quests anymore.  Without quests, dungeons aren't going to be an efficient means of leveling, it's just grinding for better ilvl gear (though the game as a whole needs to do a hard 180 on that system and run away from it), so a lot of people would just avoid the inconvenience of having to travel and would instead just continue solo questing.
---
A few weeks
---
I had just finished fighting the dead in crypts and black forests for what seemed to me days.  There was not must left to do in that desolate down, with the townsfolk having the misfortune of trying to carve out a life so close to the undead.  On I went.
---
It had been quite some time since I had seen the sun, and I recall with acute clarity the sudden burst of greenery as I crossed that brittle bridge and turned to into that interminable jungle.  I wanted the heavy sun across my head to burn away the webs from sepulchers and ramshackle hovels.  The sun indeed did that.
---
Across a stream I saw an encampment at the bank of the river, from the high hill on the northern side.  I was taken aback by the sights I saw.  There were more corpses than I had ever seen, bones piled upon bones in a sea of alabaster, surrounded Poor Old Papa's tent.  I thought I'd need fear the rhinos, lions, or kudus, but it was the enemy in which all who come to those green hills must fear.  They rode upon Zepplins, hid in poorly constructed outposts, and when they came for slaughter they always found the weak.  
---
Papa gave me many quests to kill the beasts of the land, as he was not sure he would get all the hides he needed before the rains came.  Each time I returned to him new bones laid on top of the old.  There was always fighting there by the river where the six legged crocs wandered.  That was in the beginning, when the fighting was constant, and the hills hadn't taken too many lives.
---
EVVVERRYONE
---
First raids not going to be out until like 3 months after launch so you'll have plenty of time. I think 4 days played to 60 is considered pretty damn fast.
---
That's not at all what bfa feedback was like. I can say from a shaman perspective I know there was a large amount of very detailed feedback and suggestions given to help shamans which were essentially ruined by the removal of artifact abilities, traits, and legendaries. Pretty sure the main shaman guy from the Shan discord had a write up he submitted to them and it was ignored. So yes there's no reference database to check but it's not like all the feedback was simple.
---
NE Females have incredible animations. It’s quite literally one of the main reasons I’m rolling Alliance again.
---
It is zero percent weird to play a female character in a video game.
---
I also transferred to Mug'thol but immediately regretted it. Most of my guild quit as soon as we moved. Rolled a new character on Azgalor as soon as BC dropped.
---
Joannas record using that guide is 116 hrs.  Assume you are not perfect, catch more competition, but get a slight boost in extra rested and that would put average good leveler at 150hr range.  If you've never leveled vanilla and will need to be learning quests, your class, and mechanics I would add 20 to 50 hrs based on how quick you are to adapt.
---
Resto is required in raiding as much as you can say anything 'required'. Raids may take an enhance shaman for melee buffs and you can even tank instances that you outgear but you'll definitely be sought out for shaman heals more often than dps. 
---
In saying that, 1 shadow priest is also all most raids need so the DPS side of things doesn't have much of an upside with priest either.
---
All healers were fine.  Totem buffs were solid and reincarnation is basically you having your own soulstone at all times which is always invaluable for a raid.  Shamans most of the time were put on as the aoe healer, or raid healer where as most guilds preferred a priest to the be MT or OT healer.  However, it doesn't really matter.  Both classes can heal anything just fine.
---
Priest back then didn't bring too much raid utilize besides for Fort and Spirit buff.  They were really good, but you only needed one priest to cast both.  Beyond that, you were basically just a healer.
---
Shamans on the otherhand were shifted between groups a lot depending on what buffs you need to provide.  Totems were group only back then so usually, they would stick you in a group with 4 dps since shamans gave pretty hefty dps buffs back then.
---
I would assume 12-15 days they'll want bis, with leveling done under 10, but that's just guessing - since mc and ony are up day 1.
---
You would walk away from Classic because other people are playing Burning Crusade? How does that make sense? Following that logic, you are forbidding yourself from playing Classic in the first place, because other people play BFA.
---
I played druid in vanilla and thought I'd do it again. I'm remembering though how shitty lvl 60 was and how I wasn't really good at anything. I was also only 13. Bc came out and I played druid and it was amazing so something in my head thought "oh bc druid is vanilla druid" not true...
---
I'll be playing mage now, since that's always been my secondary class
---
Ive seen some guilds asking for  3 weeks  to 60 and working on BiS. So I assume if you want a cutting edge guild somewhere within the first month of release or ealier
---
So you mean you're getting enchanting then?
---
I've been playing a free Steam game called Minion Masters. It's fairly simple, not pay-to-win, games are quick, content is fun and addicting. It's something to do.
---
For a second i though my eyes just died.
---
both are fine raid healers
---
some poeple think its dated, but since i started in 2010, it really grew on me. they just released the 64 bit version yesterday and it runs and looks much much better. highly reccomended as a casual mmo until wow, i started two days ago and im about to hit lvl 40, and endgame is lvl 60 so you can even casually raid in lotro until classic.
---
Hybrids are fine in dungeons. There’s less pressure, each class uses more of their utility toolkit to help their group, and the fights are considerably shorter in raids. I’d even take a boomkin if they have the water to make it through a dungeon.
---
But raids? Why take a spec that could be totally fine as a healer, but they refuse? If they’d rather be the one thats OOM in 1.5 minutes and essentially reduced to a melee that does no damage but continues to soak damage and curses? That’s on them and I hope they find a home in a raid guild, but if I was raid leading I wouldn’t take the more whacky specs, beyond something like shadow priest for Shadow weaving.
---
id say joining a guild now through our monday threads or some other recruiting place would be your best bet. see when they plan to start MC and thats your answer.
---
Top end guilds ive heard as bold of claims as day 6 or 7 they plan to down ragnaros, i do not think this will be the case, world first maybe but most server firsts would come after the first week
---
I just dont think its healthy if a guild does 6 days as you wont really have a good team, just the classes and specs that are good at zerging. You can zerg mc and ony, but not BWL, and certianly not aq40 and Naxx
---
I feel a guild that doesnt have the aim of downing MC in a week is gonna do well in the long run
---
I honestly dont know if youre joking lol
---
What? I've heard it's going to take over a month to reach 60, are people in this thread saying that you'll want to be maxed and pre-raid BiS ready in a few weeks or am I misinterpreting?
---
Don't let your memes be dreams!
---
Cutting edge raiding guilds are completely skipping pre-raid BIS and going straight into Molten Core with greens.
---
??? MC and Onyxia day 1 baby!!!
---
wouldnt the attunements for ony take a good while? kind of delay it after MC?
---
I think it's because how black-and-white the DPS role is. It's 99% the more damage you do, the more useful you are for the group, full stop.
---
It was barely last week that we hit 100k. I’d wager 250k+. But my real number estimate is 283K.
---
This confused me also, seemed like the. Xpacs brought alot of new flight paths but now that I'm leveling it seems like most of them are original.  Guess I dont remember the game perfectly after so many years
---
&gt;Another downfall for a rogue is agro management
---
Rogues have some of the best aggro management in the game? Have you ever heard of feint and vanish?
---
MC and ONy are out at launch
---
It just encourages the "Go! Go! Go!" idea with dungeons, which is what's made a lot of dungeon runs painful.  That attitude's going to get people wrecked in Classic dungeons unless they overgear/level the place.  (But it does make for an amusing character in a wowcrendor video.)
---
Since he had a void out , he took 10% less physical damage on top of it.
---
You also only (had to) pummel once and it did not even hit. Yet the warlock is never attempting to cast anything (immolate, drain life) but fear - apart from the one drain life attempt at the very end. You are essentially beating on a warlock thay could have been afk for &gt;50% of your fight WITHOUT dealing less damage to you
---
So in conclusion: yes you would have rolled over *him* if he would be affliction. My point is that any somehwat decent warlock at that level range would destroy a warrior.
---
Came here to say this. Moon Guard was my first server and I didn’t know. No one warned me and my sweet little human priestess. Pornshire taught me everything I know about being a virgin still.
---
You aren't mistaken. It was originally dropped by General Angerforge. I distinctly remember this as well. BRD must have underwent some loot changes. I also distinctly remember that The Golem Skull helm was also originally dropped by Phalanx in the BRD Grim Guzzler Bar, and not by Magmus.
---
Shamans generally get more spots in raids due to their totem support. Nevertheless both classes are almost always needed.
---
Shaman is 99 % of the time resto, you can probably find a guild taking you as enhancer, but don't expect too much
---
PvP blue set is pretty easy to get, and likely before you get MC gear.
---
This isnt the exact image but it should suffice in such a large mosaic
---
[https://i.imgur.com/SM3Yc24.png](https://i.imgur.com/SM3Yc24.png)
---
Im not joking. My immersion was broken. You cant fuck up a comic strip and leave it like that lol. Edit that shit.
---
You give warlocks a 10, 7, 8, and 10...then an overall 6? Must be a mage main.
---
It's faster if you hit the timing right. Slower if you barely miss the train. (Assuming you are going from Stormwind Trade District to the Ironforge Bank area, so you have to walk across both cities to get to the tram).
---
I remember once some alliance were raiding crossroads. On my warlock I tuned into World Defence and head there from Org with a few others. We killed the raiders and camped them all the way to ratchet, sure enough more reinforcements arrived from booty bay and were attacking us. My friend called for aid on trade chat and we soon had a 15 man strong raid group. 
---
We beat the alliance back to the boat, a few more had arrived, and every time the boat returned more alliance got off and attacked. We beat them back and got the boat to booty bay, just to be met by a raid group of alliance and some angry guards. It was chaos! So much fun though.
---
An hour to get to level 6 isn’t too bad tbh
---
casuals will take over a month to reach 60. You will find that the people who take that long to level dont have a burning desire for end game so much (otherwise it wouldnt take them 1 month to level when it could be down in 168 hours)
---
See rule 6.
---
Pugs were always filled with idiots in vanilla and we managed. Just make it clear that it's the tank's job to pull and designate CC and it should be fine.
---
Tanking is fun because you're much more the group's leader than you are in retail, and trying to generate and keep threat is a fun challenge that keeps you busy.
---
Part of the issue isn't fight difficulty, it's fight length.  A boomkin will pull their own weight in a dungeon where they can drink every pull or two, but can't pull their own weight against a multiple minute raid boss.
---
pvp trinket = x sorry mate thats just how it is
---
That would likely help yes. Just re-subbing at all is going to get noticed though. I'm subbed currently because I got a stress test invite. I'll be letting that sub lapse and then re-subbing for August 13th.
---
This made me laugh really fucking hard
---
Hell yea!
---
Considering that most people are still in the guild, they just play off and on over the years it's easy for me to talk to them in game.  I don't have to "find" them.  As such those who did drop out in Vanilla know where to find us.
---
And I don't mind resubbing anyway since I haven't played since around bfa launch so whatever's been in the patches since then would be new for me.  It's just a question of now or later
---
&gt; i’ve seen so much retarded shit from Hunters its not even funny
---
There are bad players in every class, and good players in every class. Hunters is memed for rolling on weapons they can use, but rogues and warriors roll on bis weapons for other classes, and nobody bats an eye.
---
The problem with the hunter meme, is people like you think it's real.
---
Show me on the doll where asmongold hurt you.
---
I bet you are, though.
---
False.  Elemental wasn't that bad of a raid dps back then.  Also gave a nice caster buff.  And most raids would take 1 Enhancement Shaman as well for the melee buffs.
---
Of all the hybrids, shaman gear was the most versatile set which allowed them to progress a little easier than feral/moonkin, ret/prot paladins, and fury warrior.
---
/spit
---
you do realize i didnt make the original comic right? the "your" part is from the original artist, you fecking idiot lol
---
I recommend making an alt later down the road after classic launches. I played a character using the following rules:
---
-no use of the auction houses
---
-no trading w/ players
---
-no groups w/ players for quests/dungeons
---
-no bank alts
---
If you’re familiar with OSRS’s version of “Ironman” account, it’s very similar. Makes for an interesting play through.
---
linked above in this post
---
I don't even know what to say to that
---
I thought about doing this but I figured there will be so many people the route won't matter, everything will be killed as it spawns.
---
If you want to be taking "seriously" get Tailoring (Bloodvine set) and Engineering for DPS (bombs)
---
I'm not sure, I've noticed that on a couple of different private servers though, and on those servers other summoned minions do not give full xp. This leads me to believe its been done on purpose. But I guess we won't know until they rise the level cap further(which I hope they don't do), or we get in.
---
Hunter weapon.
---
Also in finnish!
---
You got me there. I was talking more in the sense that people feel they need to play the classes that will perform at the absolute highest in order to have fun in the game, rather than play they characters that they like. I applied to a guild the other day that told me there plan was to run with mostly warriors and locks as DPS and that I could join if i wanted to be a part of a competitive roster and play one of those two classes. Not for me. I'll have fun in a more casual guild that has a little bit of everything
---
I'm not sure if you can completely disable them, but I know for a fact that on the lowest setting they emulate the 2004-style shadows with the static dark spot under your feet that never changes shape, just like the old days.
---
I was curious about doing the same! Lemme know when you get it remade.
---
mayhaps we will start to see a minimum required in slot list. Kind of how retail has ilvl requirements and suggestions. I would kind of hate that but oh well.
---
Rift tried to jump on the classic hype train with their Prime server, but they rushed it and pretty much failed miserably. If they would do an actual classic server instead of just locking the current server to classic levels  I think it would be more successful.
---
Hey I’m 22 cheers to us young bois who experienced classic at age 7. Wouldn’t want any other childhood.
---
Certain class combos work much better than others. Kargoz has a video about it on his youtube channel.
---
You'll want to prioritize certain quests i.e. kill count quests over material gathering, and especially look for elite quests. When you stop to grind look for a place that spawns humanoids so you can gather silver and cloth.
---
Try to pick classes that don't fight for gear. Co-ordinate your professions so you don't fight for those either.
---
For someone who dont have the time to put in for the best pvp gear, which pve gear is about the same as the best pvp gear?
---
Cheers!
---
If one levels solo, they rarely meet equally geared solo opponents of the same level.
---
If there're two, chances that you meet a similar gear/level duo are almost non-existent.
---
But yes, in theory, a good warrior with a good pocket healer can destroy most of the duos.
---
Ah, then I understand what you mean. Ye the range is tiny, but not super tiny
---
Razer naga and blackshark if you can still find one.
---
to be fair, drawing SW is not easy with all that detail.
---
This doesn't seem right. To my recollection, dungeons were much more difficult in Vanilla.
---
Great idea! Thank you for finding that :) It'll be a small easteregg or something (y)
---
You can get a wand easily within the first 10 levels with tailoring and enchanting, just save all your cloth and DE some greens from tailoring.
---
&gt; Raids will want more than 2 warlocks
---
Here's the thing though, not really. I mean yeah once we get past BWL you want more than 3 really but I've run all the patches twice now as a lock and usually in most guilds you'll only ever need 2 until we get to the later stages when the curses get more useful or you will need more utility (HS, SS etc.). I don't know where it comes from that people think locks are so sought after, it hasn't been my experience at least (few exceptions i can think of).
---
You should start calling that idea 1.14, since... we’ll, we’re lready getting 1.13.
---
If I'm running in a priest/lock combo, the worst thing I'd want to run into is two rogues xD
---
Nope.
---
Thanks! From what I gather shaman doesn't really main tank heal, so is being the totem guy an option? From what I've seen totem weaving is quite mana expensive, so I assume I can't do it while healing? If I was to be the totem guy would that put me in more of a dps spot?
---
I love grinding in Vanilla, my go to leveling regime for any MMO is:  
---
Listen to Yogpod's original episodes.
---
Listen to Blue Plz radio show by the late great TB.
---
Maybe Mike and Joe if I cba.  
---
Been doing this pattern since actual Vanilla (Well listening to Blue Plz and WoW Radio).
---
And now for a public service announcement!  Don't feed the yaogui, that is all.
---
This. If the Tank hast some good Blues You can clear it
---
MC/Ony are so easy that you can use basically any raid comp, but no one wants to waste time gearing hybrids that they can’t bring to stuff like BWL or AQ
---
yes or didnt u make friends while playing?
---
Ur not going to have anywhere from 5-9 debuffs on a target when a paladin is in play. That’ll take you forever to get those dots up just to have them removed while the warrior is the only person dealing damage.
---
The difference is tiny compared to the variation in player skill.
---
&gt;I'm hoping I can get a addon which makes my character look Human, on my screen.
---
[There is a food that will magically make your character look like a human pirate and it's inexpensive enough that you can pretty much have it up all the time.](https://www.wowhead.com/item=6657/savory-deviate-delight)
---
this is the only correct comment, there's no info in the internet
---
Well-played patron.
---
In vanilla you play your class, not your spec, so if you can heal than you most likely will have to sometimes
---
In a raiding guild you are expected to do whatever you are needed to do. The me, me, me mentality of the types of people who think they are just gonna do whatever they want is much more of a retail mentality IMO
---
TBC changes a lot about the classic experience just by existing. it changes where people hang out, and it changes which high-end content people focus on. TBC lets you in at 58, so that's where everyone would go as soon as they hit that level. greens in hellfire are better than vanilla raid gear, so no one would waste time in MC anymore.
---
The DK one really ties it together.
---
Haven't played in ages and probably not gonna start now either. Other things to do, like refreshing /r/classicow and checking the calendar every 30 minutes to see if the launch is any closer
---
this just in... people playing the sandbox game however they choose.. more news at 11
---
At the end of the day, the streamers want the same thing as the non-streamers - to be anonymous.  It would be better for the overall health of the game, and it's players, if nobody knew who the streamers were.
---
At the end of the day, we all want the same thing - streamers don't want their followers giving them benefits, and they don't want their haters griefing them.
---
Worse, it butchers the respect for the boss. When I first saw Lady Vashj, KJ and Illidan, I was in awe. I was literary in a fucking awe, I was full of respect to these bosses. When I killed Lich King I felt nothing, but "meh". Killing him on overtuned to hell heroic mode wouldn't fix that. It's a one-time thing that either leaves great memories, or it's a "meh".
---
I walked ascandy so badly for PvP on my hunter.  It was my dream weapon in vanilla.
---
OSRS is the closest thing to it.  
---
Main difference is that OSRS’s backup was from 2007, so it had a lot more content in it.   Jagex doesn’t do expansions like Blizzard, they do weekly/monthly updates so it was ever changing.   
---
There was tons of hype, because the backup was from a time period prior to a massive change (think a pre-Cata build) that drastically changed the game.  It doesn’t really compare though, their peak players are under 200k, but it has consistently grown from updates.
---
Nova, blink, poly, run.
---
At least that's what I did when a rogue would surprise me when I mained a mage in TBC.
---
I deserved my ban, keep up the good work.
---
Do they look remotely simolar to you?, :D
---
I see. I’m fine with the fact that better geared people can kill me easier. 
---
My question was if i am able to have fun in casual gear (beside of getting ganked by better geared people)
---
I remember 2 man farming the General countless times with my Warrior and a Heal Pala - it never dropped, eventhough thottbot database showed it in General Angerforge's loot table
---
Maybe if you have a premade group. But having a group that wants to grind 30-40 purely in SM is unlikely, as it’s boring as hell.
---
If you don’t have a premade group, you’ll be wasting a lot of time looking for groups.
---
i thought about it but i want to reserve the full extent of my erection for august 27th. that is if the servers don't crash non stop for the first 24 hours
---
No chance they down rag in 7 days lmao
---
Oh my god, I didn't even think of that, we got ourselves a private BFA server player, oh fuck!
---
SWG did this and it was pretty neato, this is definitely one of the cooler ideas if they decided to do special-rules servers at some point.
---
What was your main source of income as a warlock in vanilla? 
---
When I played in vanilla I enjoyed using aoe farming to get gold but I am not sure how effective aoe farming as a warlock is because of the lack of slow.
---
So give em a slice or the mage can hit em with a bit of ice
---
Holy priest the new ret meta!
---
Hunter has bad stigma too, so that's no reason to choose them over Druid. ;)
---
4 days to 60 has never been done before. 5 days to 60 means you are one of the best levelers the game has ever seen.
---
Well, I play Heal or Tank, if there are at least 3 people who heal/tank. Otherwise, I just switch to dps and practice. It helps me learn and games also end more quickly, so I have another chance of getting a decent team. Win win scenario even with the defeat screen.
---
Nice Username
---
You seem set on shaman but priest input wise, you get Benediction which is great for a long time and overall have a very competent healing kit with shields, hots, quick heals and group heals.
---
I dunno what you end goal is but both healing priest and resto shaman are great in raids but dps specs well, lets just say we only had 1 shadowpriest in our raid back then and that wasnt until a raid was on farm.
---
casuals will take multiple months to reach 60
---
Was this is on an unmetionable server? I had this exact experience Tuesday night
---
I don't think I've noticed a single persons posts so frequently. First it's "holy shit theres another girl in this sub!" then I mouseover your name and it's "oh snap it's the one who hates slayer!"
---
That's truly taking MMO upside down.
---
That's TBC bro, try again.
---
Fun idea.
---
T2 does drop from MC, rag. And early vanilla, they all did.
---
Alliance side, you can get your first wand from the bashal aran questline in darkshore. You can do that quest chain at like, level 12, so it's not a huge deal.
---
Warrior DPS wasnt that great early on and you didnt have much choice but to be a tank.  Fury picked up late game and by later i mean 2,5 and 3.  Yes their DPS was nuts then but you got to look at the whole.  The effort to get a warrior in full t3 and a corrupted ashbringer took a long time.
---
Everybody thinks *they're* going to be their guild's Enh shaman.
---
"what do you virgins offer" LOL
---
It's originally vanilla, so yes.
---
Similar, yes. Brown hooded cloak, green face. They have similarities. I searched through every single WC3 icon / thumbnail and every single WoW icon / thumbnail. This one does not exist. I also did three reverse image searches, 0 results each time. This image is most likely on some internal database and was never released to the public other than in this mosaic.
---
I needed on the healing staff in Sholomance I think by accident as a mage. I saw int and spirit and auto pressed need. The item had some healing green text effect I missed.  I won. The priest went livid. He refused the my apology, refused (a lot) of gold for my mistake and refused to contact GM to sort it out. He just wanted to give me shit about it. Broke the group too. I vendored the stuff out of spite.
---
As Enhancement spec, you might be able to get in the raid.  Having a single Enhancement shaman was common back then for 2 reasons.  Windfury for melee plus Nightfall procs.
---
Enhancement was a really bad dps option back then... all you did was auto attack and wait for windfury procs.  Stormstrike and shocks you would use, but because intellect and spirit was not optimize well on enhancement gear, you would run out of mana before the boss was dead if you spammed stormstrike and shocks as soon as they were off cooldown.  So most of the time, mana was conserved for totem drops until the boss was almost dead.
---
But Nightfall was the bigger reason to bring an Enhancement.  As a dps weapon, Nightfall was pretty trash so you didn't want a 2h fury warrior running it.  But the 15% additional elemental damage proc was massive for your casters.  And since Enhacement dps was going to be trash anyways, it made the most sense to have your Enhancement Shaman use it along with their totem buffs.
---
But like I said, raids only needed 1 Enhancement.  So, you will have to fight to be that guy.
---
Now we just need the pepper and we got ourselves a meal right here boys!
---
Farming water elementals in Felwood. You can grind through them pretty quickly. I'd just chain them up with my void walker and dots.
---
Warlocks do have a slow in the affliction tree, curse of exhaustion.
---
Way back in March 2005 my first character was a human paladin on a PvE realm because I wanted a "warrior that could heal themselves" and a couple months later I created a Tauren Druid on a PvP server and was hooked. I was split maining between them. I created other toons but they were my mains. I think this time I'm going to make a Tauren Druid and stick with it. I'm doing this because:
---
* I had far more time back then than I do now. So I need to pick a toon and invest in that one. I may have alts but will only have one main (at least that's what I'm telling myself now...)
---
* Out of the two I had more fun with my druid than my pally (even though I will always have a special place in my heart for my first toon). Might have been the people I played with but I felt Horde was more fun and laid back (on the most part).
---
* Cat is 4 fite!
---
Same I haven’t played in a few years, just check their discord like once a month. Still of all the mmos I’ve played I only enjoyed wow (a lot) more
---
These guys are geared to the teeth though. Full lvl30 BiS. Makes a big difference.
---
I just watched an hour long video with Monkeynews who said he did it in 5 and others have done it in 4. That was on private servers though but as far as I know the leveling xp wasn't tweaked.
---
Did you watch the blizzcon dev video? Watched it last night, gave me chills
---
We're talking about having Classic servers and TBC servers separate from each other. The existence of TBC on another server would stop you from playing Classic? No, it wouldn't. 
---
Lack of TBC will cause people not to play in some cases, but having TBC servers would not cause people not to play classic in the same way having BFA servers would not cause people not to play classic. 
---
Altering classic could drive people away from classic, so any implementation of classic+ probably has to be a separate server. If you are doing a separate server, it just makes more sense to do a TBC server than a Classic+ server.
---
I'm still deciding but could use some clarification on the debuff limit in raids.  I'm assuming sunders/coe/shadow weaving and stuff will always be on the bosses, but for the dot classes/bleed classes are any of them allowed to have debuffs up?  Can a warlock use a dot, can priest use their dot, can rogue/feral use a bleed, is fire mage allowed since they have a dot, hunters with serpent sting?  And how does the limit work, if theres already 16 can no more be applied, or will applying a new one knock off an existing one?
---
I'm interested in priest, lock, druid, shaman (if i go horde) so would just like to know how these debuffs work.  Would a feral just shred/ferocious bite?  SPriest Mindlblast/mind flay (how does mind flay debuff work too).  Any info appreciated.
---
If the warrior attacks me (the undead priest) and I shadow word pain and vampiric touch he will have 4 debuffs. Two global cds. The warlock can put 3 debufs on him in 5 secs at the same time as me so that's 7 not including fears or devouring plague in 5 seconds. In that time if a paladin I instantly started cleansing he could have gotten rid of 3 debuffs. By the time he gets rid of the other 3 we can full dot the paladin. By the time he cleanses himself we will have already full dotted the warrior again and switch to harder dps
---
&gt;This is a conservation project, not a reimagining.
---
Isn't that just speculation? You don't know what direction it's going to go in.
---
It might be clown suit, but god damn if it's not an intimidating clown suit.
---
What are you talking about? Everyone keeps saying warriors do the highest dps.
---
I did stat it was 9/10 after a certain point.  This is very true in Vanilla.  The 5/10 was nobody wanted you to play DPS when tanks were so scarce and it was no secret warrior tank was the best.  Finding 4 tanks to raid a 40 man dungeon for a few hours took work on its own.
---
4 days will definitely be doable by the people that have a good route and play alot to stay ahead of everyone else. People are getting 7-8h 1-20 runs while Joana took 10h in his 4d20h run.
---
Mueller is looking into this.
---
I'd be interested to see the data for these graphs. Especially with all the neck-beards on this sub saying "every guild only brings 1 druid"
---
Warlock got a 10/10 7/10 8/10 and gets a 6/10 overall wtf is this
---
You do you bud!
---
Level fast as you can and be good.  Guilds will pick you up for raids due to stragglers.
---
Argent Dawn US. Any time multiple servers were down, suddenly there would be a mass of level one characters running around saying “rp servers are teh suxxorz”.
---
Yeah I imagine if I get caught without pws and dont have a trinket yet I could get eaten alive by two rogues
---
Right, but as a mage you have a slow tied to your aoe spells. Is chaining siphon life on several mobs at one an effective strategy to farm 5-8+ mobs at once?
---
Yea it was a lot to type.  Every word adds a chance to be skull bashed.  Thanks.
---
I was about to oppose tajuaro doesnt have fp :D 
---
But than i remembered its just cataclysm fuked or brain due rewamped barrens.
---
There is a talent in resto called "Healing Way".  Grab all three points in that for healing main tanks.  Allows your downranked healing spells to heal more and your Nature's Swiftness + Healing Wave max rank is gonna be your giant lay on hands big heal with 3 stacks of Healing Way.
---
This talent was introduced later on in Vanilla as part of the resto shaman buff.
---
That is insanely fast lol
---
To much consumables...
---
Fair enough fella. .
---
Yeah but it was never meant to be a masterpiece, it's just a funny song that pokes fun at class stereotypes in WoW. ''Cringe'' is something that's bad but completely unaware of it and takes itself seriously. This obviously doesn't do that.
---
Priests are better healers for most of the game, but shamans get really good in naxx gear.
---
You'll be healing. They are decent enough at it.
---
What was your main source of income as a warlock in vanilla?
---
Why? Only warriors, shammies, pallies and huntards can wear mail. Shammies and huntards not until 40, where you switch to plate as a warrior anyway. Paladins shouldn’t be needing on any plate that doesn’t have int.
---
Just roll with a druid tank and you’ll be fine.
---
but everything but head and legs were moved to BWL eventually.
---
will these be the case in classic or will they be where they ended up, that is my point
---
So much for the narrative that mods don't do shit around here.
---
&gt;It's definitively impressive than even 15 years after vanilla was released that people still find new builds to play.
---
Ya that is impressive. I'd like to see how this turn out. It makes me excited for vanilla.
---
The closest is the Everquest progression servers. That probably it. But even they did not revert system changes made over the years. I WANT MY BARD ZONE KYTING BACK!
---
In TBC, sure. They give no unique buffs in vanilla and oom way too fast. Also, nature damage is not good for raid dps. No debuffs for it, and its pretty bad in aq.
---
I mean bruh yeah wheneverything in the game as well as actually exploring / living through the world is a meaningless time sink people are going to be pissed when you add an extra hour at least onto their old content farm or just general daily/weekly routine. Its not classic where the world is alive present and ever changing. Its a mess of phases and layres and scaling and lag without anything meaningful changing between zones. Its not like im bei g rewarded for anything other than spending half an hour hoping to hit tripple 7s on the 16th slot machine that day.
---
They didnt mean a 20 man naxx, they meant a new 20 man raid at the same tier as naxx
---
No one is talking about mythic 0. We're talking about how heroic dungeons are irrelevant. In fact, Mythic 0 is part of why heroic dungeons are irrelevant. By the time you can queue for heroic dungeons there are better ways to get gear, and if you're forming a group for heroic dungeons you might as well just be forming a group for mythic 0.
---
Your right ill fix that.  The point was they had to slow down a little when the class is all initial burst.
---
What was your character named?  I'm always curious if I played with or against anyone on here back in the day.
---
but i barely post here and i haven't posted slayer hate like at all on the rs sub in 2-3 months.  u sure ur not just stalkin me?
---
Yep. General etiquette imo is that everyone gets to roll on a low level BoE epic.
---
Usually it's a party of 40s rolling on a lvl 30 BoE epic. It's kind of a waste to equip it and then replace it with a blue or green in 5 levels. Better to sell it to a twink or a fresh level 30, especially if everyone needs money for their mounts.
---
idk, i think world first will be 7 days. but that doesnt mean thats when everyone else will down him.
---
id say most guilds will down him in the first month
---
“Even middle aged gay men will enjoy evil dead” hahahaha
---
Convincing my fiancé to play with me so I actually still have a fiancé after launch.
---
She's showing interest too! Watching some streams, and she recently told me she wants to roll a shadow priest (granted she has about no idea what that means...) But since I wanna roll a lock I'm down!
---
I prefer looking at it like creating a new game within an existing one. Self imposed game mods.
---
I'll keep you updated! :)
---
Nightfall.
---
The devs said at one point I believe they are going with 16 slots throughout classic. Id have to search up the blue post where they said that.
---
All of my friends haven't unlocked that part of their brains either. They think it's because I'd like to be a women irl.
---
Mages will be even stronger, no doubt, but if a Mage decides to double Ice Block and sit out the duration of BW, the Hunter can wait in max range and drain kite the Mage when the Ice Blocks are over.
---
You're going to find out that there is no one spec that's highly effective at all of those things. 
---
[Here's about the best I think you can do.](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/AvAwAAU_P1400A) 
---
When you're raiding, you'll have WC and a little imp blizzard. But you may have mana issues and need to spend more money on mana pots. And also you won't be able to help silence hatchers in suppression. You'll also have lower resistances although it doesn't matter much.
---
In PVP you can do shatter combos but you don't have frostbite or improved CoC so you won't be firing on all cylinders.
---
In AOE farming you'll need to meet a higher threshold of int+stam at the outset because you'll be reliant on CoC kiting rather than using blizzard -- it'll be less safe and slower. Doing lashers for example, you have to spend more time close to them for CoC and AE rather than far away using blizzard because you don't have enough points in imp blizzard.
---
And then once BWL is on farm and you get into AQ40 you'll be fire spec which sucks both for farming and battlegrounds.
---
&gt;Very well done meme...the subtitles perfectly fit his behaviour, excellent meme!
---
 Very well done meme...the subtitles perfectly fit his behaviour, excellent meme!
---
I truly wonder if I’ll show up at work once my PTO runs out at Classic’s launch
---
I loved healing back when it was a real thing. I hate the auto heal spam zombie healing right now. So i will probably heal in classic. can't decide between druid - priest
---
I was really hoping you were trolling about the upcoming WoW Classic: Mobile app....
---
But yeah, dual monitors....
---
You can get a $10 monitor from goodwill or something :D
---
I'm trying my best to keep my hype at a minimum. It is not working that well. The end of August feels so far away.
---
R1 earthshock, R1 searing totem. Talents for 5s CD shocks. Maybe R1 frostshock for extra lulz.
---
All shamans are totem guys. Totems arent optional. You'll be dropping them all the time as resto spec, depending what group you are in. If you don't drop totems you are horrible.
---
&gt; BFA is the worst expansion to date
---
What?  Did you miss WoD?
---
hahaha I guess no one really posts here and most of us are viewing all the /new posts that come through.
---
If you mouseover your name the slayer things comes up, you must have written it somewhere in your profile.
---
I also farmed this in my rogue with bother rogue and druid doing stealth runs. I think this was part of why it was moved. It might have been a bit to easy to acquire since it’s a trinket used all throughout the game.
---
inferior imbecile... tri monitor with overhead wall mounted tv
---
This is me ... T_T
---
I was haha.  The overall 6 is fun factor for me personally not how they perform generally.
---
C'mon*
---
Literally had to stop reading and downvote /s
---
World record 1-60 is 4d21h on hunter, which VERY few people will be able to come to close to. Efficient leveling for serious players will mostly be 8-10 days played time for 1-60 when including extra time to begin collecting pre-raid BiS starting with maraudon.
---
Alot of people still dont think fire res gear will be needed in MC because it wasnt needed on private servers, but I would expect you'll need it in classic since a lot of big time mechanics never worked on pservers (Including large fire aoe's requiring fire res gear). So I think you should expect to have to not only farm normal pre-raid BiS but also fire res gear. 
---
Adding on organizing this for 40 people, rep grinding to get the group through all of MC, topping off professions all easily adds another 5 days played time.
---
So all in all, likely around 15 days played for most of the serious 'cutting edge' raid guilds.
---
You have made a very convincing argument.
---
Wait no you have not done that at all.
---
Care to tell me how much spirit is required to match the HP regen of demon armor and then tell me it is worth getting that much spirit instead of stam or int?
---
Thanks. I didn't want to have to be that guy this time!
---
Damn, that's very interesting to see. Especially the spike when the Beta was released, thanks for sharing!
---
Stormstrike also pushed a better debuff off the boss, so enhance didnt even use that.
---
I'm referencing our boy Andre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-m41SMtn_Y&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
*hop hop*
---
The best part ks is had GoT been that popular they would all be named after GoT characters.
---
116 was the fastest, and as a hunter. Raids need warriors, and priests and paladins and will have to wait on those players. and that leveling speed is a bit slower.
---
When i say 168 hours thats if someone focused on leveling as even the slowest class (warrior)
---
I hate when people ask how long will it take to level and you give a number like mine that takes into account that the person is only focusing on leveling and then they shoot back in your face that its way too quick because what about *list of detours and distractions from leveling*
---
melee did start strong doing good numbers in blues.
---
It would actually be useful for people who find themselves making excuses to make alts and never reach endgame.  Assuming they have that goal.  I remember back in vanilla I couldn't get myself to stick with a class to 60 because I would try out a new class when I started to get bored usually mid 40s or 30s.
---
I really wanted to try out raiding so I convinced myself to pick one class and dedicate it to reaching 60 and raiding on the next batch of new servers which I did successfully do :)
---
Perhaps a "No new characters until every char is 60" rule(ie a max of 1 non-60 at a time).
---
It was solid feedback my man. Personally, for me - I enjoyed the music although I didn’t finish the movie. It was cool how you made it like an old school pvp video, which is why *I* enjoyed the music. 
---
Made me consider shaman, thank you.
---
I'm stoked for classic but I have been playing dk for so long I'm not sure what to do when classic releases. I love playing frontline caster classes in games which as horde there isn't one of those.
---
ohyuckie deserved his ban, keep up the good work.
---
Technically shift + spacebar for interrupt and just space to jump
---
Get a logitech mouse and you have 3 scroll wheels (or an extra 2 buttons)
---
I was thinking more along the lines of this:
---
** Omar locks himself in the closet again for a week.  **
---
** Next Week **
---
** Omar presents Classic WoW is now coming on smart phones **
---
Meanwhile...
---
NoChanges folks have a melt down but someone from that group suggests they can level up in WoW at work using the good 'ol bathroom.  NoChanges folks rejoice and new Omar memes are born!
---
I'd definitely be interested. I love having an identity and knowing who else are good at their class, or can provide certain profession services. I think it would be damn cool.
---
Yeah, we've got several players that have sub 90 hour routes, but I haven't posted good enough times on my own to have access to them yet. I've got 30 in under 24 and 40 in under 45 down cold, but 50 in under 70 is killing me. Currently on my 4th level 40 to 50 rogue run. If I can get to 60 in under 100, I'll get access to the repo and start over to try and squeeze out another 10 hours. We need enough people to hit 60 in under 90 so we can douse the runes and get a few key pieces of gear.
---
Heh 😎
---
Crazy numbers! I expect it'll continue to climb as it gets closer and closer to launch of Classic. I know I had given up on WoW a few years back and would just sub to level a couple characters and unsub within a month or two. I think there's going to be a lot of people like me coming out of the woodworks to come back to Classic.
---
Because a private server is 100x+ more irrelevant than the beta.
---
That's literally it.
---
not sure about this, and again(private server experience recently) every server I've played in if you are actually pre-bis you can top MC dps charts pretty easily...
---
I thought wingclip hit for like 100 damage
---
fun factor on a personal level, that overall is my score not the average score
---
Sounds like you are on pace to beat the world record
---
LOL I'm so glad to learn I'm not the only one.... Literally refreshing this subreddit all throughout the day hoping for more info on Classic... read through every Classic guide, even for the classes I have no intentions of playing...
---
AUGUST CAN NOT COME SOON ENOUGH. STAY STRONG MY BROTHERS!!!
---
Ele is a terrible raiding spec. OOm then auto attack. Does even worse than the already terrible enhancement.
---
Why do you feel the need to be hostile when discussing the game? You don't *have* to insult people when you disagree with them, you know. 
---
My point was it would make the problem worse, not that T3 wasn't already bad.
---
OMG the memories hahahaha
---
GIVE ME A 1 DAY BAN. I WANT TO JOIN THE COOL KIDS.
---
That might be a cool thing to do, once a lot of the important stuff on my main has been completed. I did know OSRS had an "Ironman" thing, but didn't know the details :)
---
Thank you for posting this, makes me love classic 100x more :D
---
Ye i tried to get some of that oldschool touch in there, thanks!
---
Yea, if alliance got a low level one horde would have to get a level 25ish one to match stocks
---
going to be an enchanter so the basic ones I will be making
---
You won't put up raid numbers in a Hemo build spamming SS or Backstab (particularly not without improved backstab or improved SS and the hit talents).
---
Cold blood prep is likely going to put out less dps than a rogue completely ignoring finishers, including SnD.
---
UD is the traditional choice, but troll is lowkey better in every situation.  
---
Troll gets berserking, shadow guard, and hex of weakness
---
UD gets wotf, devouring plague, and touch of weakness
---
So in pve raiding, UD is actually quite bad.  Will seems useful because of how many fear fights there are, but typically every healer group on horde should have a shaman for tremor.  The other two racials give you nothing.  
---
Troll on the other hand is a haste buff that directly increases your HPS, on a short enough cooldown to use literally every fight.  Shadowguard is passive damage, that costs you no mana since you precast it going into a fight, and while typically not worth it, situationaly hex of weakness can be used on healing mobs if your group lacks MS, or as a weaker curse of weakness if you are short warlocks.
---
PVP shadow:  Devouring plague is great no doubt about it, but in group fights will get dispelled quite frequently.  Dwarfs will stoneform it, mages will iceblock it.  The only classes it is great against are classes that cannot remove your debuffs to begin with, and those classes you tend to dominate.  Also while devouring is a lot of damage, shadowguard over a long fight works out to be more raw damage.  
---
In addition shadowguard is amazing at procing blackout on random cleaves, or rogues opening out of stealth.  It also builds up your shadowweaving faster adding dispel fodder and increasing your damage ramp up time.  Berserking is quite good on shadow, and helps gives a bit of burst to a class that isn't typically a burst caster. 
---
 Devouring plague is so overwhelmingly expensive, people typically combo it with inner focus, but as troll you gain inner focus back, so you can use it for the crit effect on a berserking+innerfocus+mindblast to maximize burst.  The real shining jewel of troll, you can hex everyone every fight.  Everyone at -20% healing received is kinda nutty.  Even when there isnt a healer present it nurfs pots and whipper root spam.  
---
PVP Healer:  Basically the same arguments for shadow, except that gaining hex means that in situations where you are able to be offensive you can do a hell of a lot more then a healer build undead priest.  Berserking is even better as a healer then it is as shadow.  If you are the focus target, and taking lots of damage Berserking scales with your missing HP, and allows you to squeeze in heals that otherwise would have got kicked.  If you are ignored, you can use it for damage, or my personal favorite in stalemates where both sides have too much healing, combo imp mana burn and berserking to delete enemy healer mana bars.  
---
In pvp you will no doubt miss will, but remember priests or horde have shamans, have passive 15% fear resist, and their trinket removes fear.  Also priests are typically the focus target in group pvp so you are far less likely to get fear spammed then other classes.
---
Not a great reason. Nightfall is much better for the offtanks. Even hunters are better users of nightfall. Wingclip spam is the highest uptime for that debuff.
---
Buy your level 40 mount and then your epic mount when beta cap is 60 so you can test the game more efficiently
---
It's pretty much human nature.
---
Not possible at 40
---
There's hundreds of us, hundreds !
---
I’m rolling a Horde toon with my brother and his buddies and I’ll roll an alliance alt on another server. 
---
I’m playing both sides so I always come out on top.
---
I would have hoped that some guilds would prioritise material etc for their enchanter to disenchant etc so that their members could have wands. With a few people contributing, it should not take long.
---
no he knows what he means, it's not going to be a good wand and the magic more pours out than flies but it will have lots or pretty ribbons
---
Well the thing is about every stats bar maybe spirit is useful for a ret pal. str agi sp melee crit and spellcrit, everything increase dps on a ret.
---
Yeah im going with this... mage will probably win again
---
Most people do attunement after 60...
---
Kings Honor, friends.
---
Ok.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/3QjRrw7.png](https://i.imgur.com/3QjRrw7.png)
---
Warriors in MC regularly beat out every class for top DPS. You often have to be scared of pulling aggro and wiping the whole raid. They are nuts
---
It's clear that you have not done any serious Warlock PvP. Spell damage is *everything*.
---
My first Milestone is lvl 30 after 24 hours.
---
I'd say between 4-6 Days is fast.
---
These are P-Server values, since i don't have Beta access i can't verify it.
---
Maybe Joana tried to Speedrun 1-30 in the Beta yet?
---
i feel anything manual pummeler can do ironfoe can do better, yeah ironfoe is super low drop but you need to farm a shit ton of pummelers if you want to base your dps around them
---
Feral tanks use them to cement there threat at the start of the fight and even then they need 3-4 per raid. 
---
However i can agree that vanilla ret players did try to hard to play like a warrior and that just isnt the case.
---
https://i.redd.it/5n33p84chr231.jpg
---
The record is going to get smashed in Classic. Once we're well into the game, someone is going to compile all the twink BoE gear, all the potions, all the summons, all the rested XP, etc and just destroy Joana's time by at least 36 hours.
---
Just assuming a guild will even have 1 is frankly wishful thinking.
---
Yep. 80 something more days of this lol
---
Look up the trainers on classic wowhead or a similar website.
---
Skin everything you kill and you won't have a problem meeting the level requirements.
---

[WoW with a DDR Pad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxCfhSdWPc)

Pretty sure some cleared Dark Souls 3 with a dance pad as well. Bonkers.
---
Just mention a pserver name and then you can be apart of the club!
---
Damn, so much misinformation here.
---
I played priest on private servers, but I'm leaning much more to shaman now. My only goal really is to stay up to date on raids for phase 1-3 at the very least. I want to pvp a fair bit, but not past rank 10 if that gives you a good idea. Really wanted to see what shaman can bring to the table vs a priest when it comes to the raiding scene and if I'm gonna need to fight for a raid spot as a shaman.
---
At the time of that podcast (ep 8), in early 2006, he still didn't have a vanilla level 60. 
---
I think he may also hate Classic for reasons mostly outside the game. The private server community turned him off, and I kinda think he believes that the true desire for the classic game is low, that it was just a vocal minority of butthurt neckbeards. Couldn't be further from the truth in my opinion, and he'll see, but for now I think he's just uber-skeptical.
---
What's-her-fish also commented along those lines, that boobie-pinkhair streamer - her statement was something like "I don't think anyone really wants to play it" when in fact I think she meant something quite different. These people, for some reason, are afraid of it getting popular again. Financial? Personal? It's a mystery to me.
---
I think it would be really annoying seeing people do this.
---
[try](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/28966)
---
Most games have a hostile player base in my experience. 
---
I've missed real wow for so long. People tend to be the person they aspire to be in games like classic. I've met some truly good people over the years, some of whom are still friends who have visited my home and family. 
---
He will make his friends.
---
well, there are always some gear you can craft that is very hard to replace.  Hide of the wild will be the BiS until phase 3 for the shroud of pure thought from flamegor.  Nightfall is never replaced.  one person will always need to have a nightfall for the debuff.  Tanks need to have a specific resist set which a majority is crafted by armor crafters.  but yeah, i see your point about crafted gear becoming obsolete. 
---
as far as sustained value and will never go out of style, its enchanting or alchemy.  
---
Herbalism will have fierce competition.  keep that in mind.  
---
ah and remember, flasks can only be crafted in 2 places in the whole game.  Scholomance and BWL.
---
Seals get different coefficients with 1hands so manual MCP is probably still better.
---
huh.  i knew something popped up when you hover over names but i don't think ive ever really looked at it before.  forgot i set up a profile pic and things, it doesn't show up on old reddit lol
---
Not going to be the best answer, I remember reading someone saying you don't get rep for grey (gray? worst word ever) quests. I don't know if getting enough reputation by 40 will be realistic, but at 60 you can farm reputation with the major cities with cloth turn ins. Might be your best bet, just get a ram at 40, and a nightsaber at 60. :)
---
Played on mannoroth I remember it being the first pvp server to open an Gates (2nd overall) and medith(spelling) the pve server that was first server to open gates, would come into our forums and mock use for being 2nd. It was pretty funny because mannoroth had massive pvp battles constantly and hindered the progress by alot and medith was carebear with both sides working together to open gates. Much trolling back and forth.
---
The guild drama between macabre and vodka was well known at the time. Both guilds trying to steal each other tanks for 4 horseman because they didn't gear enough tanks for it. 
---
Mannoroth was also known for the illegal Danish videos and the mc raider vid by forbidden donut.
---
Making new builds isn’t very impressive. Making new builds that work is impressive.
---
Did you Google that error code?
---
Especially if they get a drop on you and hit you with double ambush, pretty sure you'd just get deleted.
---
Most of those DoTs you listed are no-no's and would push older debuffs off. I think there's a debuff heirarchy so certain debuffs wouldn't get replaced even if they're old (i.e. sunder armor). Mage ignite is applied automatically from the first mage to get a big pyro crit, after which all mages try to keep it refreshed.
---
Many of those DoTs could be safely applied to secondary targets and would need to be to trigger effects like warlock's nightfall.
---
I loved Ashenvale because of the scenery. after 10 or so levels in The Barrens I welcomed the color green. It always felt more dangerous than StoneTalon aswell even though both are roughly the same level (Stonetalon being slightly lower I think).
---
&gt; See y'all at 150,000! 
---
That would be on June 15th or so? 
---
:D:D:D
---
One thing I will say is that as a druid you should avoid hunters more than you'd originally. You expect to be Feared from warlocks, but if you are shapeshifted hunters can use Fear Beast on you, and it (from my experience as a hunter in PvP) has a much lower propensity to break than a warlock's Fear.
---
I’m pretty sure trolling existed then
---
That makes sense. I'll add that the skill level of the players is top notch too.
---
please enlighten me, what is so misinformed?
---
Erm, spammable frost show slow which is powerful in Vanilla. 6 or 5 talented CD interrupt. 15 sec or 13 talented CD spell absorb. Insane burst damage in Enhance. Poison, Disease, and fear removal in totems. Access to natures swiftness which is an A+ talent. 
---
They uhh, kind of had some of the most tools in Vanilla IMO. Only thing they lack is CC but who cares when you can completely neuter casters AND melee.
---
Isn't that why Tinder exists lol
---
and those same people who sit on reddit and talk about how vad hybirds are, are likely either trash at playing their "meta" spec, get carried all the time with underpeforming dps, or havent even killed Razorgore lmao reddit is AIDS
---
Guild enchanter.
---
Just gimme your account data 
---
I will figure it out for you within three months only :)
---
YOU THINK YOU DO, BUT YOU DON'T
---
Lies. Deception. Every day more lies.
---
This will be the first launch event (missed every other expansion for whatever reason even though I've been playing since Wrath)  I will be able to play and I am so HYPED.
---
I wouldn't pick a class primarily because of their levelling potential. It's honestly not that big a deal. Admittedly I've never taken a warrior to 60, but I've (apparently) taken the next worst thing: rogue. It was completely fine. It's not going to set world records, but I was never frustrated at any point. Top DPS in dungeons, good grinding on mobs (feel extra happy when you find a low-armor mob area!), easy time in wPvP, fun class quests, etc. Worst doesn't have to mean bad.  
---
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe warrior is just way worse than rogue.. but I doubt it (especially after 40, warrior is said to be better, and that's not even halfway to 60)
---
If you can get it done in less than 7 days IRL, you are among the .1% 
---
Some people will take 3+ months IRL.
---
Ooooh, good perspective.
---
Yeah a lot  of the binds will very rarely to never be absolutely essential ofcourse, basically I boils down to preference I guess, beyond the main combat actions
---
Is that the warlords axe?
---
I use it to toggle auto-run.
---
I leveled a Warlock, Rogue, and three Shaman to 60 during Vanilla. The only character of the five I spent serious time questing with was the Warlock. Questing is annoying in vanilla WoW. Grinding is chill. It's going to be even more chill now that I have a multi-screen setup at home, so I can watch TV while grinding. 
---
Almost certainly going to play a Shaman again. The class is just so chill for grinding. Reminds me of that "Paladins are for masturbating" meme.
---
Bleach OP
---
This is exactly why I have no problems mindlessly killing things in Vanilla, even was okay during TBC as well. After that, not so much. It was cathartic - got to detach mentally and emotionally and just keep the rhythm.
---
Thanks a bunch had no idea Wowhead had added a classic version with this now

Warriors are always the most popular. Paladin and shaman will likely be second you gotta combine their numbers as they are faction locked
---
Please stop giving advice.
---
I've had my heart set on druid for so long, due to the flexibility and I love the theme of the class. I love healing, and raided on a shaman into Naxx in vanilla, so I don't want to do Shaman again, but now I'm thinking about priest, and really just being the best healer, but losing some of the flexibility of the druid. Guarantee I'll end up rolling an alt one way or the other, but I feel like a priest will carry a group easier.
---
Im 17 y/o have the same feeling. I started playing in cata but even though I’ve grown up on wow I’ve  never felt like I had the same experience as others who started playing in vanilla. I’ve never felt that modern wow has been as social (for me) as everyone is saying vanilla was. This might partly be because my English wasn’t so good when I was 6-8 y/o but I would still love the experience what everyone else has.
---
Does anyone have a higher rez for 16:9?
---
Server: Kel'Thuzad
---
Class: Paladin
---
Character name: Hopegwyn
---
I remember starting off raiding with a guild Glory and Beer. They always did a pug MC. It would take 6 hours to maybe kill the first two bosses. They were a great family guild though and good people.
---
Farming AV for 12 hours a day. I remember a horde rogue named Chowdur he became my arch nemesis. Also a horde warrior named Brocksampson, he would always terrorize the alliance.
---
I eventually made it into better raiding guilds like Red Circle, The Great Han, and Aftermath. My first Rag kill made me feel like a God.
---
This was one of the best servers to be on imo. We had a pretty balanced horde/alliance.. Maybe favored alliance a bit but so many high end guilds and dedicated players. I may play classic again but I feel like I'll never experience those days again. Also I want to keep my job.
---
It's different kind of hype for me. It's hype about knowing exactly I am going to have fun. Whereas new games it's hype about potentially having fun. You can't ruin this type of hype, it's the only hype that makes you happy in the end with no disappointment.
---
Thanks for the very detailed assessment. But, uhh...  I'm just gonna play Warrior like I always do and bitch about having to respec.
---
a lot of the info is either wrong or extremely outdated  
---
basing this off your memory from 10 years ago wasn't the best idea  
---
too bad too, this would have been a great post otherwise
---
I'll take the crab juice.
---
There are Excel Spreadsheets where you can calculate when BT overtakes Execute and such.
---
You should find some stuff on Google
---
I have a difficult time having any of my friends even want to play wow. They played it back in BC and Wrath and loved it. But now all they want are "action combat" titles and instant gratification games.
---
I mean I play four accounts at once on Oldschool Runescape.  Not a big deal to run two on WoW.
---
I do not believe you can swap trinkets in combat.
---
This is me!
---
Well we both learned something today. You discovered exciting things about your profile, and I learned I can come across as a stalker! Hopefully we're both better people because of it
---
Thank you. I always was happy when people donated to a streamer I liked, money or bits or a sub. But for some reason when people gave items in game it frustrated me because damn well they should work for it like everyone else.
---
You completely changed my perspective on that.
---
Seeing twitch chat terms outside of Twitch is just cringy AF. I think it’s so dumb. It’s like saying “LOL” in real life.
---
Sub 90? LMFAO, this shit is getting out of hand.
---
Apparently my post was removed because it linked to a private server's forum, wherein they discussed the ideal stats for a leveling warlock. The TL;DR was essentially: you stack Spirit to take advantage of Improved Drain Soul and to diminish downtime between mobs. It's for the mana regen boost, not the health gains. 
---
When leveling, you can usually kill 2-3 mobs at once. Voidwalker tanks one mob (with corrupt / CoA on it), you wand another mob (with dots), and you could also have a feared mob with corruption / coa. You use drain soul as the mob is a about to die, and get a spike to mana regen when the mob dies. You can also use a Drain Soul / Delete Item macro to automatically delete a soul shard in your bag to ensure your inventory doesn't overflow.
---
Obviously the guy is a scammer, lowest common denominator type. Trash content and advocates scamming people in game. He is the worst.
---
Jaedenar US was abnormally full of hackers, ninjas, trolls, and any other kind of miscreant you could think of. The World of Warcraft server equivalent of a ghetto, but I still miss it :(
---
The mods around here have brittle egos and are quick to ban abrasive posts, but falter as soon as the task to curtail nonsensical posts is before them.
---
No. Swp will give you two debuffs and vampiric embrace is a curse so that won’t be cleansed. You are speaking as if having a warrior in ur face as a clothie is something you can just withstand for a long period of time. The warrior could be doing big damage to you while you do minimal dps. Also devouring plague is a big no against a paladin team as you will lose a ton of mana for nothing. 
---
You are also forgetting paladin bubble to remove all of your dots in himself while free healing the warrior.
---
Burn him at the steak!
---
Stopped reading at "DPS warrior 5/10". You have no idea what you are talking about sir.
---
I doubt retail will be as elitist as pservers :P
---
What was the damage proc?  I never actually got my hands on one in vanilla.
---
Dang that sucks, all my friends tried bfa and hated it, luckily they’re all excited to play classic.
---
I'd rather walk then ride that terrible ram (worst mount in the game in my opinion).
---
This is why I'm asking this now, when beta is up so one of those people can actually test this. And definitely answer the question. Honestly not even that hard: whatever level you are, start by going to one of the noob zones and grabbing that first (likely) grey quest. Finish it in 1 minute, turn in and screen shot the reputation gain. Post here. That's the first test. Second test, go to classicDB, check the reputation gains you should get for that quest, finish the quest, and compare. Post it here. 
---
Please note I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you. You could be right. I played vanilla and the original beta and I can't remember exactly how it works either. I do know my gnome had that mount at level 43. But I wasn't as efficent then as I would be now.
---
Might have something to do with the simplicity of the dps rotations combined with the freedom of choice when you aren't forced to kill a specific type of mob to complete a daily quest.
---
While you might be farming for something specific the main "quest" is to fill your bags with junk to vendor. It's quite simple and requires minimum attention but every stop by the vendor feels rewarding.
---
I remember right before Cata launched, there were a TON of low level 'prophets' on my RP server screaming about how the world was going to end. People were really annoyed by them. 
---
Personally though, I thought it was neat. And if you would be doing this on your main rather than a lowbie alt I think you'll probably get more respect. If you're the only person doing this it could be fun but if a thousand other people on your server have the same idea then it's likely to annoy some people. Just something to think about!
---
Retail Modern WoW is designed as a MULTIPLAYER game, just like Retail Classic WoW is designed as a multiplayer game.  You can opt to play it singleplayer, just as you can with Retail Classic WoW.
---
It's not "the mobile gaming mentality."  It's not the players.  It's that the game got pushed too much to be like Diablo.  Grind, grind, grind for loot, then grind some more, with random boxes to open all over the place, and random upgrades.  You can't just target a piece of gear to get and know that you have to do a certain boss to try to get a BiS item.  And of course a lot of that loot treadmill involves playing with other people.
---
The game is TERRIBLE as a "single-player" experience, which makes me assume you aren't playing it right now.  I'm pissed because I boosted a character to have one on a server with a couple friends, but their guild fell apart and they hopped to another server and didn't tell me, and I have no idea where they're playing, only that they keep talking about doing Mythic raiding while I'm stuck in gear that wouldn't be allowed to do Mythic raiding because I need to run multiplayer content to do it, and they're never available to help run me through it.  So all I've got is the experience of daily/world quests and basic dungeons that don't provide gear upgrades.  It's boring.  I don't play right now because it's a multiplayer game and I have no one to play with.
---
Retail Modern WoW is an "actual MMORPG."  It can be improved, sure.  But pretending it's not an MMORPG... holy smokes, there's nostalgia goggles and then there's just knowing you'll sound stupid but saying someone anyway just to bash the experience that is more modern (kind of like when the last generation tells the latest generation that their music "isn't real music").
---
As for the portals, the issue there is that they dropped kicked them from places they didn't need to, and some didn't make sense.  If you're going to put portals up in a shrine, leave them there.  You want to put them in Dalaran, leave them there.  As it is, most cases, you're just doing an extra loading screen, so it's not like it's some kind of huge change to the game... which makes it so bizarre.  It's like it just wants to funnel people to the capital cities between expansions (though that might be why).  But I'm just annoyed about the lack of Caverns of Time portal in old Dalaran.  Yeah, I can port to Uldum and fly over, takes a couple minutes (maybe 3-5, can't recall), but why go into old Dalaran and remove that?  How does that "improve" the game?
---
Just making things less convenient doesn't actually improve it.  That's like saying that computers were better when you had to type in every command, but even better when you had to use punch cards.
---
Things that made Retail Classic a good experience included better loot variety (for better or worse), some memorable quest lines that spanned the globe, useful professions, reasons to run dungeons...  Those are things that would actually work well in a game that isn't brand new and relying on the hype of newness or the nostalgia of being old enough to be in high school itself.  You don't have to make a game more annoying to be "better."  Hell, people bitched about some of that stuff when it was the way the game worked.  Like having to level up a new weapon skill to use an item that might be an upgrade.  Fun fact: In no edition of D&amp;D have I had to dump points or anything into my weapon proficiencies, at least not since AD&amp;D 2nd edition, which I'm pretty sure didn't do it, either.  You pick a class, you're proficient in certain weapons.  That's it.  If you have a +1 sword you've used a long time but find a +2 axe, you can swap without suddenly missing most of your attacks until you swing the axe enough times.  Borrowing the Elder Scrolls method of weapon and armor skills doesn't make you more of an RPG than using the D&amp;D method of weapon and armor skills.  Spending masses of coin on respecs doesn't make for a better experience, it just makes people more likely to use subpar setups in some content if they made a mistake or do different types of content.  (I'd still have a cost, just not one that gets higher than about 5-10G.)
---
Actually, more than 8 is way too many.   Also, people are less concerned about getting a raid spot, and more concerned about getting gear.
---
No you don’t. Please show where it says you need to be.
---
but weaving spells in between ranged shots was a thing for hunters back then, and it made a hell of a difference.
---
They will be in bwl :)
---
but one great thing about being a lonely healer, is walking past a guy off in the trees, running  from 2-3 mobs of different health levels, and his health dropping fast.  
---
You stop and throw a heal or 2, to top him off, and seeing the rush of life come back into him as he stops, turns, and with new hatred, destroys his former attackers.   Then as you continue down the road, you hear the audible alert of a new message in chat, and you to see a familiar word in that "whisper pink" colour.
---
"Thanks"
---
I feel like that's something that varies from group to group and should be discussed up front, not just assumed.
---
Well, the difference between a real dps spec and a PvP spec is likely 30-40%.  As much as a hybrid vs dps.
---
A few of them won't rank the raid necessarily, but, keep in mind that it's a creeping issue.  Further, it's compounded in fights that are functional dps checks like Vael, etc.  
---
So if one or two dps are in a PvP spec that does 60% of the damage of a PvE spec maybe it makes the kill take 30 seconds or so longer or something.  But if everyone does it on progression expect to get walled on something like Vael or even Rag.
---
Not only that, even if you *can* clear in PvP specs, it might be the difference between a 2 hour clear and 3 hour clear of something like MC, and that's even assuming no additional wipes.
---
Amen
---
The best video ever made honoring the best mount ever released:
---
https://youtu.be/koSq-KecPm4
---
Its been done before and likely will be done again. MC is stupid easy, people that have been practicing and nolife can get it done under 10 days for sure
---
Hands down unbreakables enhance shaman pvp. Watching him quick drop people is timeless.
---

---
i really wonna play human paladin like i use to but all my friends are going horde so think im gonna go shaman
---
It's not climbing. It peaked at 20th May and then declined again. I expect it will peak again around launch and then will decline again to the norm above the prediction line as growth will be larger when people can play the game versus when they can't.
---
Have fun in STV in level 20/30
---
Good question. I'm interested in knowing how many of those warriors are going to be tanks vs DPS.
---
A game in hindsight is a completely different game.  When a game is live you exist with constant fluctuation of talents, mechanics, values, and content.  Now, everyone knows everything, or near enough.  People hoping to get the Vanilla experience back will be disappointed, but Classic will probably be a new and unique experience, because although the game rules will stay the same and knowledge is known, the server communities will dictate how players interact.
---
I'd rather spend 2 hrs with friends having fun than 1h 30m with a hardcore mim/max guild who treats the game like a literal job. Now if it gets to the point we literally cant beat the enrage timer... something has to change.
---
You actually think any guild will have 40 players even at level 60 in 7 days? Let alone with bis?
---
When I played SWG (it was my first MMO) you could have two characters per server. IMO it did impact the way people played. Like not having the LFG tool in Vanilla forced players to actually talk to each other.
---
I'm going to the hardware store!
---
You don’t.

---
In Vanilla you only get the mana buff if drain soul gets the killing blow. You don't get it if your pet or any of your dots get the final blow. It is a waste of 2 talent points.
---
Sounds like another thing that private servers got wrong.
---
But I'm glad you admit that you're getting your info from some private server source that got their shit wrong, and that you don't actually have any experience stacking spirit on a Warlock in Vanilla.

---
In vanilla any decent rogue would stun lock a Warlock to death. So yes stamina was the most important stat. All you needed is to pop off a deathcoil to have a chance but to do that you first had to survive long enough.
---
I thought this was known a decade ago?
---
its 10 vs 12.5 I wonder if 3 hits with a stronger weapon (ironfoe does double the damage as pummeler) vs a weapon that hits faster all the time but you need to equip a new one every minute and a half and can have an off hand that would boost stats further (spell damage for one)
---
I think this will depend bigly on the proc rate of ironfoe
---
Hi everyone, my group already consists of a shaman, warrior, and a hunter (my first 2 choices) and we live together and intend on leveling 14+hrs a day and then gearing quickly during the first month (we all saved our vacation time so I will have to return to my boring job after). I have changed my mind on them for what I want to play to basically every single class. Obviously everything has drawbacks, but my priority is basically   
---
1. Don't compete as much for gear/less popular class (this includes raids)  
---
2. High mobility  
---
3. Fun for group pvp (our main focus)
---
I could really use a decisive answer or I will just keep switching.  
---
PS: I have played basically everything once on a private server at one time or another and I will not roll druid. I simply cannot play it well no matter how much practice.
---
staff of jordan dropped on me in western plaguelands. I was running to a stratholme group and decided to kill trash to kill time. It drops. Huntard in my group was close enough to trigger a roll. Won it off me the mage. I was already 60 at the time but yeah it triggered me.
---
I sused to play on a basic 2006 Dell Latidute back in 2007. I feel like just about any modern day laptop will do. Just my guess though.
---
Hello friend. I too was on Draka.
---
Speedrunning is the only hardcore gameplay left in Classic besides PVP, if that's your thing.
---
also,I remember it getting the reduced aggro range later in the expansions
---
&gt; I would say that 90% of Retail WoW, in legion at least, was A COMPLETE JOKE, with close to ZERO need for communication between players.
---
And you'd be wrong to say it.  Raid bosses in Retail Modern WoW have more mechanics and more to communicate with each other about than raid bosses in Retail Classic Wow.  Heck, dungeon bosses in Modern have more mechanics to deal with than raid bosses in Classic.  That's not a slam of Classic, it's just the truth.  If you think there's no challenge in Modern WoW, why are you interested in Classic WoW?
---
Or were you just interested in saying something outlandishly wrong just to take a shot at Modern and say "Classic is so much better!" even though in the process you just gave a reason to avoid Classic?
---
Me and my buddy used to hide in the bushes and behind trees to ambush alliance. We would do this every time we completed quests just to keep things interesting.
---
Great read that said some points seem odd, for example Druid leveling, 5 of of 10? they level incredible quickly (level 1-10 aside) and easily up there with Warlocks and Hunters. Not to mention the flexibility to approach any situation you come across leveling in multiple ways. I mean hey its your opinion, but it still had me scratching my head as i otherwise agreed with you on the rest of it.
---
Following along on this as well.. thinking of selling my high end gaming PC i built two years ago and picking up a cheaper laptop. I haven't played a single game on it in the last year. Anything I try just does not interest me and my only concern is running wow classic at this point.
---
the only reason it woujldnt work is because of stigma against dps paladins, this build is nice and maybe a lot better for the community cuz it would allow some of that nice spell power plate to be utilized

I was a holy paladin who helped a hunter like this - were you on aegwynn or anubarak? Always so cool to see different stories with lots of similarities. 
---
One of my favorite things was using my UBRS key and getting everyone attuned for Ony. I ran so many people through that jailbreak quest. But i was a holy pally who just spammed flash of light lol. My groups rarely died tho. So much fun.

Skullcrusher had [Wray](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=109496/wray#comments) from &lt;Immortality&gt; get the world first Thunderfury and was eventually made into an NPC as part of the Shaman Order Hall. 
---
Other than that, we had &lt;Nightmares Asylum&gt; and their GM Fura who eventually merged with &lt;Curse&gt; that made a couple of [raid videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBbuUK9RbpC14fIpUYb40g59Ukz85Td3T). I'm not sure what hapened to that guy afterwards.
---
Other than that, the player population on the Alliance started to dwindle after a free transfer to Smolderthorn was introduced. It wasn't so bad in Vanilla but there was definitely a problem that got worse in The Burning Crusade. By the time Wrath came out, it was almost 3-1 Horde to Alliance and supposedly it got even worse over time but I haven't played there in almost ten years.
---
really good hunters are valuable though, because of how few and far between they seem to be (i think the lack of raid dps also paints them in a different light) but they can really be wipesavers in some situations
---
that's not right, there was an auction house in every major city since launch. since patch 0.8 according to the internet.
---
the thing was, auction houses weren't linked between cities. so every server basically had one active AH and 2 dead ones. trying to sell anything at the Thunderbluff AH was futile. that's probably why you don't remember anyone using the SW AH either. but it was there, for sure.
---
except maces
---
BIS wont be needed for MC.
---
And yes a think a guild thats sole purpose is to world first will down MC in 7 days
---
Players can't be hostile when they are force to work and play together either it'll affect their progress.
---
When a game force the social interaction without escape it lead to amazing things. Perhaps 5 to 10% of the time but it's better than now where it's NEVER happening.
---
still can't decide between troll or undead shadow priest
---
shadowgaurd is OP. DP is OP in 1v1 world PVP. WOTF is decent, berserking is decent. Hex of Weakness is huge. Touch of weakness is not but still blackout proc chance.
---
Undead has shit character appearance customization compared to trolls but undead mount looks dope for shadow priest compared to a dinosaur
---
ugh i cannot decide
---
A thing to consider was Joanna’s time was also a server first.
---
Path of Exile for me
---
I don't think anyone's done a census thing to know for sure, but it feels like what you would expect. Lots of warriors and mages, very few druids, with everything else somewhere in between. Seems like a lot fewer priests than I would expect though.
---
Haven't had any trouble with mining, the population is fairly low and the respawns on the beta server are pretty quick.

Just glancing at it was enough to colourize it in my head, feeling warm.. Feeling home, at Stormwind. Great drawing.

Yes because warriors were reworked later in the game, but this is classic, this is 1.12, meaning warriors will be amazing at all stages.

It will be interesting to see how low people can get on live servers without outside help cheesing. I suspect private servers are going to be different enough to change the speed a fair amount. I think anyone who breaks 100 on live servers without cheesing (rested exp, boe, mob tagging, etc) is a God

I always found it weird/annoying that there were none in Durotar (except org). A little bit of a nice edge for UD/Tauren having it at their level 5 town, since you want to pick it up pretty much right away.

Depends on the class and the phase.  Early on there isn't a ton, but the gear the add in later patches to dungeons is often purposefully catchup gear and is quite good.  For a lot of classes there are several pieces in dire maul that is better then MC or the blue pvp gear.  For some classes the pvp gear is ideally built.  
---
If you are talking about the epic pvp gear, there isn't anything equivalent to that in terms of item level until late BWL or AQ40.

A random forum post and nothing from a dev saying it.  Read the website where they announced it. Says you need s sub to play beta not get invited. There’s been post on here also of people  getting invited without a sub.

Just buy a 12 button MMO  mouse, then shift and ctrl bind everything to those buttons for a total of 36 extra buttons. You still use the easy keybinds like 1,2,3,4,q,e,r,t,f,g,s-1,s-2,s-3,s-4,c-1,c-2,c-3,c-4.
---
EZ.
---
I did a huge amount of research and my highest recommendation goes to the Logitech G600 MMO mouse.
---
It sounds like druid to me. If it's what has been on your mind, and priest is just an easy option, you should definitely go druid. They may not top heal meters, but once you get the hang of it it will be very rewarding. And the pvp elements are just so fun
---
It's funny because it's not even piss easy.  Have any streamers beaten Uldaman yet?
---
Was in the same boat until i saw the argument that DP happens over 26 seconds, can be dispelled and is on a 3min cd
---
Fuck all y'all I play in a holodeck.
---
Oh shit, I forgot Runda.
---
That’s what I said, at BWL you don’t want the useless comp which is why you don’t waste time gearing them in MC/ony. 
---
So you’re not going to waste gear pieces on 10 hybrids when you need to gear a real raid comp for those raids.
---
Higher level players will handle the totems and that interrupt/slow share cooldown. The interupt is also very short. 
---
They never do that great in tournaments. I think the class is fantastic, don't get me wrong, I just don't think they are amazing for duels specifically.
---
Hi m8. What region / server type / faction you gonna play? I'm looking for weekend raiding guild atm. 
---
If its eu pvp horde - I will gladly join your guild )))
---
I've played more characters to 60 than I can count and the only boe epics I've ever seen were bow of searing arrows and gut ripper
---
Lol yea. The only reason this won’t work is because of the community. Not because it’s a bad spec or anything.
---
Do you have any source to back up the "increase the base damage" mechanic. You may very well be correct this would be like the only mechanic in the game that ignores stats. Even weapon procs benefit from plus spell damage.
---
Met my two best friends in 2005 on Zul’jin, we still have an ongoing group text and try to still play when we can. One guy got married 3 weeks ago that I flew across country to attend, the other is engaged and I plan to do the same next year.
---
Never came close to that kind of online social interaction, really grateful I can relive it with them while other people try it out. It’s a great time to be alive.
---
Shadowmeld + mind control someone into lava/off a cliff
---
Cutting edge guilds will aim to do MC within 1-2 weeks maybe 3 if they have some issues on the weaker players. But that won't require full prebis. The most hardcore guild I've been in on pserver did MC on day 10 and onyxia on day 12, and we were expected to get full pre best in slot within 1 month, so something like 4-6 weeks to get full prebis I'd guess.

I’ve been pretty dead set on playing rogue for months, but after talking to my group of friends that will be returning 4 of the 9 people said they are going rogue as well. So now I’m debating paladin but I just don’t know if I can auto attack my way to 60.
---
You *can* bring just about anything... doesn't mean it's good or competitive. And I mean, throwing an enh with nightfall means they're really there just to buff the locks, so it's not like they're there for flat DPS numbers. You could put that same axe on a hunter, why not.
---
No chance he's downed in 7 days. World record leveling time is 5 days and on a hunter, many other important classes really struggle to match that. World record leveling times also include 0 time for professions and no dungeons so no early endgame blues before you hit 60. Also, no one has had to deal with the aoe fire mechanics in MC for 13 years and people are still going around thinking people in vanilla wore fire res gear for no reason. If somehow people do actually manage to have 40 players level to 60 in world record times (and not get caught account sharing by blizz which is much improved), that leaves 2 days to get enough rep, max out relevant professions for flasks/potions/cooking (at the very least). And then I think alot of people are in for a rude awakening for all of the raid mechanics that bosses had in vanilla but never had in pservers and how that effects gearing and contradicts the gearing beliefs that people have from pservers.
---
Warriors are the best DPS endgame. Period.
---
36 minutes? Yikes.
---
I'd expect the mages to be significantly more popular mid game (not necessarily long term) because of the massive difference in leveling speed and utility. Back in the day, warriors were the go to because of there very obvious and essential role in every other MMORPG made up till then. And of course, mages were right alongside them. 
---
Nowadays, I'd imagine that a lot of people will START a warrior, but give him up early because of the difficult grind associated with them. The race to 60 will be a real thing and I think most will think short term (roll a mage, lock, or hunter) with the goal of getting to 60 superceding all other considerations. I predict there will be a very real main tank drought in the early end game. Once this happens, people will go back in a flood to restart their warriors and then we will have a massive overpopulation of them.
---
In the end, in my opinion, the ratio of classes won't be stable until at least 7-8 months in.
---
If I remember correctly it’s 5 skinning skill points per level of the mob.
---
one thing idk is if pummeler can be activated and swapped to a different weapon and keep the effect? if thats the case holy fuck ironfoe and thunderfury
---
That's very true in my experience. One can build bonds of friendship which last a lifetime. The other destroys any desire to be friends.
---
Not thunderfury...

TF rogue with some good editing (for its time) and he shows the Hakkar plague at the end :D Really nostalgic for me.
---
I think the moment he lost his humanity was when he grabbed Frostmourn and it proceeded to fuck his mind. He was broken when the undead attacked Hearthglen and was ultimately destroyed when his mentor and former lover did no back him. The men who fought with Arthas in Hearthglen knew what must be done because they survived the attack. If Uther really wanted to find another way he wouldn't have run away with his army of knights.
---
Fuck you.   Who is your GM?
---
Bullshit. Leveled 2 characters to 60 in vanilla and 4 others on private servers since. I only ever got 1 epic while leveling, Hurricane.
---
Yeaaah we sorta got carried away 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Neither, at least right now.
---
That stand doesn't interest me at all, but I suspect I'm not the target audience.
---
I'll sub to Classic, but unless it gets new content added, I'll only be subbed for 66.6 months because it's the same sub for Modern as well, and I'll do the latest content and blow up old raids for fun and transmog while watching TV.  But I don't see many people, if anyone, still farming Naxx for four years straight.
---
I thought vampirc embrace was magic my bad. It's still more debuffs than a paladin can keep up with. And we can kite a warrior between curse of exhaustion and fears. If a paladin bubbles just to drop dots we can silence and fear long enough to kill a warrior. 
---
Most devouring plague is used with inner focus so it's free. 
---
If a paladin wants to spend a whole fight cleansing we will eventually kill them both pr drain the pally mana
---
Not with that attitude they're not
---
Rep rewards differ from classic db to wowhead Classic. One of which is actually data pulled from classic/tbc the other is pulled from pservers. So you can go ahead and think/hope they’ll be the same as pservers but they aren’t and won’t.
---
Have fun getting used to things that aren't in classic + getting burned out
---
Rift already did a "classic" style relaunch
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but does this guy have autoloot? If yes, how? I thought it wasn't in classic.
---
Hunters can effectively CC 3 mobs. Why wouldn’t you want one?
---
No, you divide all the non-faction locked survey answers by 2.
---
While I never made the statement that I didn’t know the locations of dungeons and raids, I can understand not knowing them. My brother, with whom I almost always did mythics, never knew where any dungeons were. “Oh cool looks like we got invited to the +9 freehold, should start heading there” “Which one is that again?” “Don’t worry looks like they’re already there, they’ll summon us” gettin summoned to a place doesn’t teach you where the place is unless you take the time to look at the map and memorize it. 
---
Besides, the downside to the retail model isn’t that you don’t learn the location of the dungeons. The downside is that, because the world isn’t dangerous, because there are so many easy, quick ways to get to any dungeon, there aren’t many interactions with other people and/or the world. There’s less collision. It’s less engaging. The world feels smaller and less consequential.
---
The "not allowed to call private servers by name" rule comes to mind. The topic obviously comes up often and we have to do stupid shit like "the really popular one that made people *nostalgic*" \*wink wink\* in order for the post to not get removed
---
What's more fun to you? Please don't listen to people telling you that you'll only be healing if you do this or that. Play how you want, find a guild that let's you be yourself. If you can't find one, start one.
---
Is there a meta/streamer reason why druids are so low right now?
---
The only guilds doing that are speed clearing the raids stacking world buffs and flasks.  They kill bosses so fast that they are cutting healers for more dps.  The issue is a lot of those world buffs and items won't be available on classic at the rate they will be on classic, and they are only able to do it after clearing the raids for months stacking gear.  On first pull progression, people will have multiple druids.
---
You can start the chain early and if you're in a guild gunning for a first month kill then they'd be making sure everyone has groups to get attuned quickly.
---
Tbf, this may be problematic at low levels, but once you hit 35-40, a couple hours really won't set you and your partner that far apart.
---
Unless he takes a full day or two off, we will be within the same level range 
---
Not to mention I do eventually have to sleep and eat, giving home boy time to catch up if he would like..
---
All this said, I am definitely the guy who gets left behind not the one who stays up all night to get ahead haha but I don't think it's too big of a deal once you get around the level of first mount
---
Tis a noble woe.
---
Hunters literally only use aimed and multi shot to dps in raids. Doesn't get much easier than that, maybe mages spamming frostbolt
---
So your points solidify my thinking, even if I didn't convey it properly before. If the obsolete argument is to carry weight, then why aren't the purists mad about BWL, AQ, and Naxx? Each one makes the previous obsolete after you raid is fully geared. The only reason to go back to any of those raids is for mat/boe farming, and while that does take place, I don't know the percentage. 
---
I know that not every caster is going to get Atiesh, but a guild will go back to finish one, maaaaaybe 2. I'm sure guilds that were in BWL went back to finish a Sulfuras for someone. Same for Thunderfury. 
---
So why so much hate over putting in a raid that was planned for vanilla but cut due to time constraints? Why is Naxx the raid to be protected when the issue being fought over already occurs in game? The 1.13 content, as far as I understand it, is way way way in the future after most people have either quit or hit the hard top on the content. I understand not trusting Blizzard, seeing what they have done the past plenty of expansions, but let's argue over that point instead of nonsense point over making a raid obsolete.
---
not really. was just hntil lv 60 that was it. No other changes
---
You can see the very detailed results of my reputation tests, both before and after the WSG update to the Beta, in this thread:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bshono/regarding_rep_gains_on_grey_quests_closed_beta/
---
Before that Beta patch, there was no rep decay, but ever since, I have confirmed that rep decay is being implemented. Both rep and experience values are closely matched by Classic Wowhead, and are not in line with ClassicDB or any other classic databases I’ve seen.
---
I am still slowly working my way through the Beta, testing every single Alliance quest (I’m currently at level 22) and you can see all rep values (calculated with the 10% human bonus and including any spillover rep when applicable) in my quest completionist guide: https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm
---
Thank you! That pretty much matches the expectation
---
I still think about this video probably once a month or so, and when they announced Classic my first thought was "That's the World of Warcraft that you plaaaaaaaay play-ye-ye-ye-yay!"
---
I'll put my hat on 300K.
---
If they drop any more major news or advertisements, I think it'll top out at 182k.
---
I don't think or hope anything, which is why I asked the question. It is good to know where that data was pulled from though!
---
So out of place the new alliance race. I didn't know that Warcraft had gipsies from outter space.
---
The Scarabs that have the two spawns are level 49-51 I believe. So maybe we'll find out in a month or so. I'm guessing they will raise the level cap all the way to 60 to have people troubleshoot all content over the course of the beta.
---
Nah you can't, would be too op.
---
The Internet is for Porn! (Ave Q remake) Even before Classic was announced this would randomly creep out of the depths of my mind and I'd start humming it. When they all dance always had me rolling.

Ready normal people?

---
&gt; doesn't mean it's good or competitive
---
What does that even mean in the grand scheme of things?  Killing bosses?  Finishing raids?  As long as you do that, does anything else really matter?
---
I had 2 epic parrots drop within 45 minutes of each other off of random mobs in STV at like level 40-45. RNG is just that, random.
---
This would be me also, if it weren't for the fact that the new PoE league starts in 26 hours.
---
Perfect! Thanks for your hardwork!
---
They surely can, have you ever played LoL. People who legit care about winning, so much so that they end up raging at their teamates, hinder their own progression forward due to rage and toxicity. The thing that keeps people from being toxic is accountability. In LoL its unlikely you will ever see those players again so you don't care as much. If your reputation on a server of only a few thousand means something, you are less likely to be an asshole.
---
You will still heal but 30/0/21 is decent healing in raids and absolutely disgusting strong in PvP.
---
It's cool. You don't have to be a try-hard. I'm going to, though... so this looks great.
---
Uther is a Paladin in service to a King, he doesn't have the luxury to throw a hissyfit. If your King tells you to jump the only response you should be giving is, "Yes my liege." Any other response is literal treason.
---
When can we ban fanart and shit like that?
---
Leveling as 6/10 on Druids? 
---
They are one of the better levelers. Speed boost at level 20 (if speced) and Travel form at 30. Also getting the forms isnt difficult at all. For Bear form you have to kill a level 12 mob. Aqua form is abit time consuming because you need to go across the sea but you just need to swim in the ocean and then teleport back to moongalde. Cat form and Travel form are just trained so the hardest part about that is having the silver to get them.
---
Shaman will be a raid healer. Only reason I was able to dps during Vanilla because they allowed me to. (I initially was resto then transitioned once I started to do the PVP grind) We were an established guild and had everything on farm, so this was when everyone else was bringing their alts.
---
There will be exceptions to the rule but don’t expect DPS Shamans to be a priority once Classic hits. On that note, if you want to try, give it a try and play what you want to play. Have fun with it!
---
I don't live in a hole, I live in a house. 
---
If you would be so kind to post an actual link to the said "no chance" videos, that would help your argument a lot. There is a very good reason why Orc were the best for PVP. Because rogues were warlock's worst enemy. And I am not talking a duel with a blueberry sack. 
---
Literally undead rogues were virtually unbeatable by non Orc warlocks because of the charm and fear break.
---
You are using a quote for the wing reason. Your quote is talking about MMR. That's different than SR, which is your actual rank. Nothing in your quote says that placement matches affect your SR. If you have a quote where they say that, please link it.
---
And no, I'm not misremembering it or lying. I remember it very vividly because remember having a chance to go 10-0 in placements with two games to go, and I was quite pissed off about it after being placed lower than I finished.
---
Kid, it was in the EU Beta in 2004 /facepalm
---
Same situation as me. Either a priest or a Druid. Druid sounds super fun and involved since it’s a true hybrid class so you can utilize so many skills.  
---
But priest is the most fun I’ve had in non-vanilla wow. Will be easy to find groups and gear up. And I love MC/levitate for world interaction. 
---
I will be creating both. Question is, which one first.
---
The more you know! 💫
---
Were either of you in Ravens of Stormwind? My guild (Brethren) had a lot of friends we were sad to see go to Mug'thol.
---
Shaman has the lowest nightfall uptime, you're still going to be the last possible choice with it
---
If you're leveling with them you won't have to do much damage as paladin. If you're not leveling with them you may as well go rogue.
---
The rule is mainly there to not promote ongoing private servers. I'm fairly sure I have seen Nostalrius mentioned here before and not get removed because it's dead and can no longer pull people away from official servers. If my comment gets removed, we'll know otherwise.
---
You don't even need 40 level 60s to kill Rag, let alone 40 60s in pre bis gear. World first will have multiple 57-59 players
---
I think it's more the desire of impermanence in a game world.  The theme park design of brief moments with strangers leads to "fuck this guy" without consequence too often.  Classic will bring back the kind of game where a healthy amount of banter, failure, and overcoming trials for success will build the bonds of friendship.  The most memorable time in WoW was when I was leading raids in TBC and I would mess up a boss pull in BT and I would hear endless shit for it for the rest of the week.
---
I don't recall being able to do that. I think they prevented that for abusing trinket buffs.
---
Imagine being able to pop a trinket right before a fight and swap it out, but keep the buff. Hahaha that would be amazing. Some trinket buffs last 20+ seconds. I think there's even a bad mage trinket that lasts 1 minute or something. It's not good but it would be with that mechanic lol
---
I remember the social aspect being what kept me in the game so long. Chilling out with friends just fishing chatting and listening to music over vent. Running 5 mans without a tank just to keep friends together. Things take longer but are so much fun.
---
The server I'm playing on is blizzlike. And how exactly will I be burned out by casually playing it for a couple months? I've played wow for 14 years and I'm still wanting to play.
---
Well, I mean, first off, why are you buying that junk?  But yeah, obviously you can get more beer for $15, even real beer.  Just not in many restaurants or theaters or other places.
---
"Classic" servers, no - but recall, FFXIV shut down for 2 years entirely to remake the game from the ground up. It saw very large success with that relaunch.
---
Thanks for the answer :)
---
Maybe he was calling him a common man as an insult?
---
Now I'm picturing OP sitting in his castle and being like "you filthy peasants!" in reddit posts
---
&gt; i feel anything manual pummeler can do ironfoe can do better, 
---
Depends on the proc rate of Ironfoe. If it's 10% it's BIS forever. But it's accepted in the theorycrafting groups that it's close to MCP for a lot of situations, again, depending on the proc.
---
Boy, it's almost like these exploitative business models cause player burnout and have no long-term viability.  Who could have possibly predicted this?  Tide goes in, tide goes out.  You can't explain that!
---
I like being able to zoom freely too.
---
I'm happy with my setup, I might just get a mouse with extra side buttons for some more skill slots
---
That makes sense! :) I hope by 8 months in the population doesn't drop drastically
---
I should've specified I was thinking PvP. Melee &gt; Caster seems to be true in pve the whole way as far as I remember.
---
Don't know why it's so hard tbh
---
You're = you are
---
Your = basically anything else (inb4 yore)
---
If your goal is to top dps at endgame then no. If not, then fuck yes. I’ll be rolling one.
---
Your guild was shit
---
Something about big cats and skeletons. The details are 13 or 14 years old and therefore fuzzy.
---
I’ve warned my gf already. I’ve already got her to play D&amp;D with me now all I have to do is get her to play WoW and I’m set for life.
---
We Have. [Hete's Dexter Bravo in Phase 3 BIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPIwKxBD16E) vs single target dummy (Tier 2, which is BIS forever, pretty much)
---
ok lets make a list of the rest of the classes, if you dont want 2x something. 
---
Mage: fails 1 but passes the others
---
Priest: fails 2 and maybe 1 aswell. 
---
warlock: fails 2 and passes the rest
---
Rouge: better mobility than priest/lock but also harder to gear
---
Druid: is a NO
---
shaman: taken
---
Warior: taken
---
hunter: taken
---
so ether you roll something your mates are or you have to make a compromise on one of your points. 
---
persanaly i woud pick any of the cloth classes they have pros and cons. but also depends if you want to heal or not. 
---
My pick woud be mage if you want to dps and priest if healing is ok.
---
Too many reposts. Yes, we remember. 
---
You suck.
---
Wait a minute, that's genius. For some reason I never thought of binding modifiers with the space bar.
---
\*Figuratively
---
I mean, I'd give you credit for literally having to stop reading if someone was pointing a gun at you and being insistent.
---
Not gonna disagree with the world being less dangerous in retail at all. Even mentioned that in a forum post on WoW forums to which the response was: “turn on War Mode.” Like I don’t always have it on anyways...
---
Priest has the best raw healing, but Shaman brings so much more to the table with totems. Raids bring along a shaman for every single group in the raid because of windfury and manatide, not to mention chain heal spam
---
Well, why should you change class and not them?
---
What if they quit after 3 months?
---
You should play the class you want dude. Go rogue :)
---
Damn you and me have same interrupt but my gap closer is shift spacebar.
---
I use ctrl w for auto run
---
Well, it's understandable. You don't compete with them IRL, but you want to be able to compete with them in the game.
---
But this is a social game and collectives are gonna do much better than individuals, that's obvious. And streamer crowds are basically just very big guilds supporting one of their members. A streamer having best in slot BWE gear is basically the same as the whole guild supporting one member getting a legendary.
---
The playing field **is** fair. They are just better at using available resources. The problem is that in order to get people to choose specifically you to fully support, you have to have a big argument for "why". What did you do so special that you think you deserve such an honor? Yeah, exactly. For streamers, there is a reason - they provide entertainment. And that common cause, uniting people together is what makes them stand out.
---
A fun idea though: an initiative of a random bunch of people. That would choose one of them simply at random. Then they would fully support him in a similar way people support streamers. That way they as a group could be able to "compete" with those big streamers. A people's hero of sorts :D 
---
But then again, most of the people would immediately bail out once they are not the one selected, so this is still unreal. And if it actually works, it's just a matter of time, before said person would simply become a streamer. Because people would want to know how their champion is doing and streaming is a logical way to ensure that. Aaand you're back at the beginning, becoming what you tried to fight.
---
You are correct and I stand corrected on the shaman argument. That said I am simply answering a posted question "pros and cons" I am not assuming or presuming anything, I am simply stating possible pros and cons. 
---
I am sure as a Warrior tank you would only be reluctant to have a paladin healer in a dungeon while leveling since they will most likely roll on DPS gear. I am not saying you will be against it I am just suggesting that some people will be more reluctant.
---
Yeeeeeep.
---
It makes me sad, the whole graphics department where I works has them, and they don't like me calling them toys, but seriously, they have less power and capability to do things than the computer I have that the company paid a lot less for.  You're just paying extra to get a pretty computer and pretend it's impressive.  And yet people eat that up.
---
Only reason I own an iPhone is because when I first was getting a smartphone, the main competitor was Blackberry, and I couldn't use that keyboard, but I could tap an iPhone just fine.  Easier now to just upgrade the phone every few years (basically when it's about to literally die) than try to transfer everything and buy all my apps again.
---
Population wise, I feel it will be stable by then. 
---
But, if you are on the fence about what class to play, and you think you can MT, sticking with a warrior early and pushing to 60 will massively pay off. You will likely be in very high demand.
---
E3 soon is pretty damn hype. Looking forward to seeing what the deal is with Halo. Another franchise that peaked back in 2007 and is set for a revival of a sort. 
---
Also, we should get some news on what new Smash Bros character is coming down the pipeline.
---
Also the data from wowhead Classic has been proven to be higher than beta at times as well. So you really won’t be hitting exalted at 40.
---
Not much free exp at max exp?
---
&gt; But it's accepted in the theorycrafting groups that it's close to MCP for a lot of situations
---
have these theories been tested anywhere?
---
'Y' was bandage. Always. On every version of WoW I ever played.
---
Waiting is part of the fun for me. The nuggets of info. Reminiscing. The anticipation. The planning of what to play with friends.
---
At first I was a bit bummed that it wasn't an earlier release date, but now I realize that I get to actually enjoy my summer and go outside instead of just playing WoW.
---
&gt;Most people
---
I like the way you say false things haphazardly and with absolute conviction. You’re forgetting power infusion and fear ward. The two most sought after utility buffs in game. On top of spirit and fort...
---
some of my closest friends are from games going back to 2003. Met them IRL too eventually.
---
Fucking care bears man

They’re keeping the vote kicking system?  F that

They're good at leveling and carrying the flag and not much else.

&gt;14/15+ million subscribers
---
12 at peak during WOTLK.  At the end of Vanilla they were around 6.  
---
You’re spot on that WoW blew up and died because of the quality of content, but the problem is that vanilla was *not* quality content.  Vanilla is a mess if you absolutely look at it:  hard to raid (40 players), going backwards to get sub-standard gear just to be able to survive some raid encounters, long TTK while leveling, long travel distances in a world that isn’t really full of anything compelling, poor quest design, etc.  
---
I don’t think Classic will fail (and can’t, because it’s just piggybacking regular subs), but I expect a huge surge and a huge recession shortly after.  Everything about classic stinks of antiquated concepts.
---
Now, if they had remastered Classic with *some* injections of modern WoW the game would likely be magic.  As it is, it’s boring to play (just like it was), boring to watch (it’s a testament to the streamer that they’re pulling views, not the game), and frankly is not compelling.  
---
Want a compelling game?  Go play ESO, or WoW, or FF14, or X.  Classic is a 15 year old game and it shows.
---
If you’re efficient with mana, you won’t have to cause blunt trauma
---
Druids have it kinda rough in vanilla. Except healers, I guess?
---
Back in the day I would run *random people I didn't even know* through dungeons for hours on end, even though I could have spent time farming mats or BGs or whatever instead, just because it was fun and those people were cool and needed my help.
---
I can't think of a single game where that sort of things would happen nowadays.
---
im pretty sure you can swap a trinket and it triggers a cooldown for all other cooldowns.
---
Ive done this on retail as a tank you need lots of trinkets for situations and i awlays noticed it would start a new cooldown for w.,e item i just equipt
---
if you remove pummeler for an item that doesnt have an effect why would the buff go away?
---
I spent so many months trying to decide between 2 classes and last week I realized that there is actually a 3rd one that I want to consider aaaaah it's even harder to decide now 
---
Send help
---
Yeah I used that as an example but more commonly see it as like "the server that's opposite south and the chipmunk that isn't Chip"
---
Well, you can use the undead mounts as a Troll. Either as a rare drop or as exalted rep.
---
So I guess you can go Troll :)
---
If I were a horde priest I'd roll Troll over Undead. Way better racials IMO
---
It makes sense that the new subs would top out right around when Classic's release date was announced, followed by the inevitable decline.  But those are some kickass numbers. :)
---
My original call was 250,000 subs by August 26th.  We'll see if that comes true!
---
So you are saying that the honor system would be uselesd to you anyway.
---
Ill be filling the off healer roll with bandages.

Lots of the younger generation prefer extremely long videos. Even stupid ones like vlogs that are a fucking hour long. If it’s good content I’ll listen to a longer video with my headphones while I’m working. Otherwise I’m a 1-2 minute video person myself.
---
I can't wait to equip a 2 hander as enhance, slap windfury on it, and just auto attack between earth shocks.
---
Did you ever play City of Heroes? There's a really well made private server called Homecoming that is packed full of people right now. Everyone is having a blast (no pun intended).
---
It uses a launcher called Tequila, that functions sort of like a simplified Bnet launcher. Just Google "City of Heroes Homecoming" and the forums link will have a "getting started" thread with directions.
---
Shift-Spacebar has always been special boss buttons.
---
Good point. That would require a very proactive shift to avoid (IIRC, shifting before the cast goes off should prevent Fear Beast, right?).
---
I prefer to play on the game the way it was intended. You enjoy easy mode tho
---
Well. You want a druid :)

Raided as a Resto Shaman in a mid-tier guild. The good news is this will probably be more common to see, but it’s still a meme spec, it’s not sought after.

The irony of the throwaway makes this post
---
Wait, really!? Wow! I don't think I've taken a flight path without being alt tabbed since like wotlk, so I never noticed they removed the animations. I thought the gif looked perfectly normal haha
---
Lmao guy made an honest mistake and tried to:
---
* Apologize
---
* Give gold to make up for it
---
* Contact GM to fix his mistake
---
and the idiot healer just wanted to give him shit. Their fault if they just want to bitch about it instead of trying to fix it.
---
&gt; Kingdom Hearts 3
---
*Indeed.* I gotta hop back on and finish Kingdom Hearts 3 Critical Mode at some point - I stopped due to the Hearthstone adventure content and haven't played since. It's a really solid game though, even if the lower difficulties are a bit too easy.
---
i've done this to my front page and the front page of reddit, and then found this post on my front page. 
---
how do i get off this site
---
Thunderfury is good because it generates lots of threat, no point of giving it to a rogue.
---
Oh know the grammar nazis found me
---
I know... they really fucked up the lore with Draenei. One more argument against doing TBC Classic over a new WoW Classic fork with 1.13
---
Hardcore raiding in retailllllll
---
I can't recall a single Vanilla era video that didn't Rick Roll me.
---
Special boss buttons? Like what pops up in the middle of the screen on specific encounters?
---
That's how item buffs work like trinkets. I'm not talking about the cooldown being shared. I'm talking about using the buff and quickly swapping out the item so you can use another one 30seconds later. It will removed the buff once the item has been removed
---
This guy I'm responding to literally clicks everything.  Do you really think he's a min/max PvPer?
---
And I raided fairly hardcore in Vanilla.  Yes, I used far more than 10 spells, but I guarantee my 10 most frequently used easily accounted for 90%+ of my inputs.  That was my point.  Letting a guy know that he doesn't need to literally keybind every last everything like OP.  Telling him (or implying) "use 60 keybinds or you suck" is so daunting he's just going to accept that he "sucks" and he'll stick with zero.
---
That is not at all unexpected, it's also not out of line with druid representation in vanilla.
---
If you use the US international keyboard, it's Shift+RightAlt+s. You can also just type Alt+21
---
Probably, because I don't like to PVP that much as 60, and go full PvE speccs. I will go AV exalted for sure, but PvPing beyond that besides the occasional world pvp skirmish, I doubt it.
---
But for lvling, its super fun.
---
/drool
---
Might have to see if I can pick one of these up second-hand! Thanks for sharing!
---
Personally, I've never cared about leveling quickly. While all my friends were 70 in BC, I was literally doing laps in Org just talking in Trade and guild chat at like lvl 50. I've always been a slow leveler and really like to just take it all in. Trying to optimize my leveling just seems like such a chore.
---
I was planning on doing the same thing with nelf mount, so i briefly tested this in the last stresstest to compare the values. I was mainly comparing to this list that someone compiled of the Darnassus reputation quests, which is based on priv server data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1spD5vcf5vt3CIVd_rJIfERlOs_4o1xYRcTUkIW8RNag/edit#gid=134288223 
---
First of all, the rep values are definitely off, and most of the Teldrassil quests gave way less reputation than stated in the classic databases. For example, many of the 250rep quests gave 100 instead. Although, some of the 75rep quests in the database gave 100 in the classic beta instead. Main point being the values are indeed different, and mostly way lower. Also, the grey quests do seem decay in reputation once they turn grey. Although i only tried that with one of the starter quests that i left uncompleted until it had been grey for 2 levels: it granted 80 reputation, whileas on another character and yellow it granted 100rep.
---
Not very thorough testing, but i hope it gives some indication.
---
I wish there was this much excitement in a single retail drop :(
---
Priests are better for carrying a group.
---
Non-CD resses and way better healing options.
---
Druid's mobility is fun as hell but it'll help yourself more than your group.
---
Yep like Gul'dan or what have you.
---
Fragrant Branch of Yore
---
If you’re playing a priest, you need a wand. 
---
The wand drops and quest rewards that you’ll get at between lvl 5-10 are no where near as good as the enchanting wands (Lesser Magic Wand at level 5 &amp; Greater Magic Wand at level 10). 
---
If you don’t want enchanting as a profession, then I’m sure you can find them in the AH, but that could cost you depending on supply/demand. So keep that in mind. 
---
You can always progress to make those wands and them dump enchanting.... and AH any leftover mats or create as many wands as you can and AH them to make up for money you’ve put into enchanting. 
---
Otherwise, the next upgradable wand comes in BFD.
---
Real healing warriors bandage while summersault-charging
---
As good as this news is, it doesn't belong here.
---
It's called a joke.
---
The person you are replying to has probably never played a private server and probably thinks they are instant 60 and pay for gear.
---
i thought you just cant swap trinkets in combat anyway so these wouldnt be able to be super abused?
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/28966

nothing is stopping you from doing that. honor system or not
---
I tend to keep my pinky on shift almost all the time, so more keys on the left really doesn't benefit me. I don't even use caps locks with WASD.

Halberd of Smiting : Equip: [Chance to decapitate the target on a melee swing, causing 452 to 677 damage.](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25669) 
---
Still wouldn't be 1k damage tbh, I'm pretty certain that guy meant Raptor Strike. Also from my experience the proc chance of that thing is fairly low. It's one of the ebst looking Polearms in the game though.
---
But how is you're guild going to smash it? If you're going for a week 1 rag kill, you'll have no rested exp, no one feeding gear potions or portals. World record vanilla time of 5 days is for a hunter too. We now know all of the pserver records are because of incorrect exp so all pserver times are unreliable.
---
World record leveling times dont include time spent on professions or dungeons either (hell Joana barely even looted dead mobs if they didnt have quest drops). Is your guild planning to skip potions/flasks/cooking/enchants/etc? if so, how do you guys plan to beat world record times while adding on the time consuming task of maxing out professions?
---
Also what is your guilds plan for the aoe fire mechanics that required fire res gear in vanilla but never existed on pservers? Do you guys really think that fire res gear won't be needed for mechanics that no one has really dealt with for 13 years?
---
Also based on your earlier comments, seems like your practicing on pservers. How reliable do you guys really think that is given all the significant differences we now know exist between pservers and classic? Differences being incorrect exp, incorrect spawns, denser/dynamic spawns, 
---
Further, blizz now auto bans account sharing, does your guild have 40 people that their system won't flag? Such as people in the same households are geographically close enough that it may not consider it (even though this still gets flagged as account sharing at times)? If people are sleeping, does your guild really expect to have 40 people simultaneously beat the world record?
---
I'm not entirely certain a week one rag kill is even possible with account sharing.
---
Patience is key because one or two gamebreaking bugs found in the beta could really save the live server integrity. But yeah I can’t wait to slaughter some noobs with the boys too
---
Sorry OP, but if you don't read the rules, your shit gets deleted:
---
&gt; 1. Content must relate to World of Warcraft: Classic.
---
People forget that unless your in a hardcore top guild you can really play any spec you want.  Yes they are less effective but overall when a guild needs 40 people they will take whatever they can get.
---
I had a blast in wPvP with rank10 gear using a Warlock.
---
Even with lesser gear you can still kill people 1v1 and even 1v2+
---
If I roll warrior I'll be a tank.
---
Theres reasons why it may not work, but alot of those need to proven at level 60. So far we are at least doing passable dps
---
Doesn't compare to prot paladin consumable list, still tho just play holy.
---
But what finger do you use? If you use your pinky, you can't use Shift+ spells, and if you use your ring finger, you can't strafe left. I tend to use alt since all my thumb does is jump.
---
This meme is why I don't feel bad needing on Blackcrow.
---
My girlfriend of almost 3 years will be playing classic launch with me. It's all about that give and take, she tries to play as hard as she can (she just progged mythic mekka with the guild I'm an officer of). On the other side of that coin I make sure theres a few nights a week where we so whatever she wants, such as movies, go out somewhere, ect. Try to find something for them to get excited over and talk about that. Dont overload them, let them come to you with questions and give small helpful hints. My girlfriend a year ago was not the best player, but right now she's competitive in a 6 hour raid team. Hopefully this helps someone get a significant other playing!
---
The invest back is the time spent playing a game they want to play legally and to help produce a better quality version once it is released.
---
Journey before destination.
---
it gets real good when you go to /controversial :D
---
"Youre not my king yet, boy, and I wouldn't obey that order even if you were!" Arthas pulled the prince card like a dick, and it's unknown if he even has the authority to demote Uther because technically Uther is his "superior as a paladin". Even Jaina tried to explain that he can't just do that but Arthas is like IT'S DONE because he's a spoiled brat.
---
I agree but they asked about beta so just giving input. 
---
I will say most people I have talked to in game are playing what their main will be with a few saying they are saving that for full release. All anecdotal of course though.
---
Right now is probably the best time to figure out the ratios since most people are leveling their mains again instead of playing alts when everyone was stuck at level 30. Just the wrong time of day
---
SL is only good for dueling, and any dueling tournament will ban SL
---
I specifically remember actually being in Vanilla WoW and dueling outside of Org ALL the time. Shamans were constantly doing the best. People complained about them all the time (especially alliance on forums). Especially when leveling, I had a shaman at 30 and could easily win duels with any caster as much as 9 levels higher sometimes just because of how dominant they are vs them. 
---
You can "handle" totems but they still then require the opponent to focus away from you. If a caster is spending time trying to stomp a grounding totem, it did its job giving you 2ish seconds of them being off you. Also, why would you care if interrupt and slow share CD? You likely never need both. Even if you do you have a totem that slows and even when killed the slow lasts some time
---
Their only weakness was mana but you had to fight tooth and nail to keep them off you long enough to not die before their mana pool did.
---
How old are you?
---
Troll is better.  
---
You deal basically the same damage over a fight with 2 shadowguards as one devouring plague except you have x6 the blackout chances.  Since you don't use inner focus on devouring plague you get to combo it into a mindblast for added burst.  Also, shadowguard is useful every single fight, whereas DP is only good against 2/3 of the matchups.  
---
Hex is amazing, particularly useful against people who have already limited healing like enemy hybrids or pure dps that try and potion spam during a fight.  
---
Also I would suggest as troll shadow, to go Imp mana burn.  Combod with berserking, imp mana burn can often be more advantageous then pure damage.
---
&gt;So why so much hate over putting in a raid that was planned for vanilla but cut due to time constraints?
---
Oh I can't help you there, I have no idea what those people are on about.  People will be screaming for new content 6 months after Naxx goes live.
---
Grinding in Vanilla is, somehow...enjoyable. I have no idea why is that, but I never hated it or loved it.
---
I simply like it more than dislike it.
---
Just upvoted every post on here. Wedding in 2 months, just started a new job, and all I can think about is what streamers are doing today, looking up different class guides and thinking hmmmm Mage, lock rogue Druid?!??! THEY ALL SOUND FUN
---
What’s your experience with the fun factor from dot dmg? Does it feel slow at all? I’ve seen a post around here, where the OP says it’s not fun at all to do dot management and it doesn’t feel strong...
---
I built a new office/gaming area and set her workstation up between mine and my brothers (he rents in my house).  She likes to binge watch shows so I put a 55 inch above the computers for her.  She can lend a hand in keeping the boredom away during that grind to 60
---
I was thinking rogue as well as im loving mine in retail.
---
But i think im gonna go paladin for main, and thief for alt when i have some cash and  hype slows down.
---
Also if i get ganked il go play on alt  rogue till it clears out.
---
More people will roll warriors but you will bring more warriors than any other class.
---
I seen on pservers the hunter population is second/tied second behind warrior population.  You might have as many mages but you will use more mages in a raid.
---
Imagine wishing you were 20 years older for classic wow. It’s a dumb post and you should feel dumb
---
Yes, time spent killing it.
---
Why spend 1hour clearing MC when it can be done in 45?
---
I had my account hacked a couple times from Curse addons back in Vanilla. There were quite a few that had key loggers installed in them. Took me a while after that happened for me to get back into addons again.
---
Outward is good fun if you have someone to play through it with. I didn't enjoy the solo play, but duo play feels great
---
&gt;There is a very good reason why Orc were the best for PVP.
---
Except they weren't.
---
&gt;Because rogues were warlock's worst enemy.
---
Rogues are guaranteed kills for Warlocks.
---
&gt;Literally undead rogues were virtually
---
I like how you immediately disqualify your "literally" statement by saying "virtually"
---
&gt;unbeatable by non Orc warlocks
---
No one rolls Orc Warlock unless they are RPing.
---
&gt;because of the charm and fear break.
---
Bruh you have never done any Vanilla Warlock PvP. Every word you say is a testament to that fact. Almost everything you have said is the complete opposite of what is true. You sound like a 100% "Wrath Baby". You are in for a very rude awakening when Classic lands. I'll keep my eye out for the only Orc Warlock and /wave when I see you.
---
It's okay to criticize and make fun of streamers
---
8 per raid, yes.
---
That's a lot for a class. Hunters 2-3 per raid
---
I completely misread that. I thought he was still talking about Ashkandi. I was like wtf
---
Compiling the data from a vanilla wow spreadsheet I got from here, which is derived from classicDB, I have close to 22k darnassas rep just from Teldrassil and Darkshore. Obviously, those numbers are WAY off. 
---
Can we at least presume that the total amount of quests in each zone are correct?
---
Two rogues - sap one and delete the other 
---
Anything with a hunter - the amount of kiting and pet harassing they can do is insane and you have no mobility
---
Anything with a mage till warlock gets felhunter and even then you are not likely to have one out while leveling. Sheep priest nuke the lock
---
Your combo really lacks mobility; However, at 40 with shadow form and Soul link it will become better.
---
yep, if this wasnt the case then explain pewdiepie

i watched a video to see what all the fuss was, i still dont know cuz like nothing happens for 5 to 10 minutes..

I tried using my two other monitors but the 50 is so big I never bothered to turn my head to use them anymore.  It was easier to just use windowed mode on games I didnt in full screen mode.
---
Hahaha yeah I totally thought he was still referring to ashkandi. I misread his comment.
---
Yes. Specifically Northern STV, centered on Nesingwary's Camp and radiating from there. 
---
It's really the lowest level area of the game where Horde and Alliance have a significant overlapping quests. Almost all Alliance players go there because it's the only real zone in Eastern Kingdoms with significant content for the 30-35 bracket. Desolace is too far away, and Thousand Needles has almost zero Alliance content. Northern STV is real easy for both Horde and Alliance to reach; it's a short flight from Stormwind and there's a direct Zeppelin flight from Org and Undercity.
---
The result is (1) it's a wild zone for same-level world PvP as Horde and Alliance quest each others run into one another; (2) it's a target-rich environment for high level gankers; and (3) counter-gank squads can mobilize and respond quickly because it's so easy to reach that area. Absolutely insane and entertaining area to play in. Hordies who leveled 30-35 in Desolace and Thousand Needles miss out on a lot.
---
I started playing in BC whenever my cousin wasn't  playing on his account. The rarity of being able to play made it so much more fun. I leveled an undead warrior to level 18. Now I play alliance
---
Not in the begining I'd imagine. Which is probably their point.
---
In a top ranked guild that's coming from a Pserver? Yeah maybe.
---
Anything below that is going to have a hard time gearing that many Fury warriors.
---
I'm just picturing every rogue, war, hunter just becoming raid ready trying to get BiS. It's going to be a huge pain in the ass with how popular fury is.
---
Obviously those that make it and as time goes on with alts, yeah, fury is sick though.
---
Yeah kinda figured. Making sure I’m not missing some big secret. Wouldn’t be the first time lol
---
You won't get a ban for mentioning them - it just gets the comment removed. You'll get a ban for repeatedly telling people to play on them, after receiving a warning. :)
---
I like the way you say false things haphazardly and with absolute conviction.  Because he is talking about shamans and priest meaning he intends to play horde.  Meaning, fear ward was not on the table.  Power infusion was disc spec only.  Not everyone played full disc.  I played 21/30.
---
Nope. Just going to use elvui and move my action bars. Everything is 1 to 4, q,e,r,z,x,c,v then shift mod to the right then alt mod right of that.
---
Better hoof it.
---
Even there you are better off taking a holy/disc priest who specced into shadow weaving and uses r1 mind blasts off cd.
---
Yeah mobility will be an issue. But our survivability will be strong once we hit 40 and on. If we can survive the initial burst of melee we can kite and out live them.
---
The world record for 1-60, by Joana, is 4d20hr /played, or 116 hours. The vast majority of players, even cutting edge players, will be notably slower. If we add 24 hours to this record (being fairly generous to players leveling speed) we’re at 140 hours. For a 3 week period, that comes to about 6 hours 40min of playtime every day.
---
That’s not super unreasonable, but most people don’t have that time consistently for 21 days, and most people will probably be slower still — especially as breaking your playtime up into multiple sessions slows you down even more due to travel time between inns and questing areas. 
---
On the other hand, you could take 2 weeks vacation from work and play 10hr/day every day and hit 60 a week early for that 3 week deadline.
---
Yeah for sure
---
That's without using "vs undead" cooldowns and consumables too, from what I can see.
---
They spawn at the beginning of the section you just finished.
---
I never said that, I just said it would be more fun if you could gain titles and PvP rewards, as you could back in 2006.
---
I remember watching this ep back in the day. Man, G4 was the tits!!!
---
I think Classic will get a lot of players who currently aren't subscribe to actually re-up their sub, thus generating income for blizzard that they would not see otherwise. 
---
However, financially, I just don't think it will ever be as successful as retail or other AAA games all because it doesn't have micro-transactions.  Good games are good games but it's the money that has driven design in the recent years, and games with MTX generate more income. Look at GTA online success for example, the single player is great(along with RDR2's single player) but the online versions are riddle with greddy designs to force MTX.
---
I honestly wish MTX didn't exist because they alone have had huge negative (IMO) impact on game design, and I think Classic is one of the last games not affected by that. Until people stop spending money on MTX, they'll continue to ruin game design and the gaming industry.
---
I've been playing with broken ones for so long, I can't remember if that was normal or if they started all the way at the start.
---
I remember it took longer and longer for them to sneak up on you.

An amazing machinima, one of the best. The voice acting is decent, the heroes feel pretty alive, and the story is nice. And i think the movie is done within the very spirit of Vanilla WoW. Of course the animation is not as good as in modern machinimas, but hey, this was so much time ago.
---
(I think 1st and 2nd chapters were released during vanilla, and 3rd during early BC)

I will be a ranged weapon only warrior that identifies as a cloth wearing caster while also prioritizing spirit/intellect cloth gear.

---
I was paying attention to it only for myself so didn’t screenshot or anything, but can guarantee in the last stress test that 1) the classic db values are wrong, 2) the rep reward for a typical quest was 100 (instead of 250 on classic db), 3) green quests reward the same as yellow, 4) races start 100/6000 friendly with other races and 1000/6000 friendly with their own, 5) there is no spillover rep gain, and 6) when dinging 10 my human was just shy of honored with the dwarves and I definitely had a bunch of the starting zone left to do (leveled to 4 in human area then ran to dun morogh and started w/ 1st quest there when it was green.

Don't chat shit

Holy shit. I don’t disbelieve you, but I “can’t believe” people can hit 60 in under 4 days /played
---
I will put up with the waiting, because it will be WORTH IT.
---
It is indeed infuriating and frustrating to count the days until our world will be whole again...but it's all that we can do. I am on this sub every single minute of daylight...can't play other games, they ALL seems so irrelevant.
---
Bought FFXIV, all 3 expansions, played for 3 months but only played 2...and I realized it's just another BfA, but with an anime theme. It's so damn easy, making gil is absurdly easy, just like in retail WoW.

Every single game icon on my desktop is met with me thinking "There is no point clicking on you...o you...or even you".

The wait is killing me, but, it will be well worth it.
---
It's actually pretty good for hunters in pvp.
---
Trying to stay away from pservers and get into Diablo 3 by playing a hardcore Sader for season 17. Doesn’t stop me from browsing /new every 5 minutes.
---
Nah man. They are THE company for putting players first.
---
Hmm I see.  So would a trigger effect like nightfall (i think thats corruption right) be able to be on the main boss target?  And how would you handle 5 locks, only 1 gets nightfall?  So if you have 8 fire mages theres only 1 ignite debuff?  Thats pretty crazy and does that just count for damage as the initial lucky mage (so the other mages are just boosting that mages dmg)?
---
Same here! I either want to play a dwarf hunter, a human warlock, or an orc warrior. I’ve played each one past 40 on private realms and enjoy all of them equally...
---
Ya fine dude make a shaman and show us all how amazing it is.
---
So a hunter vs a enhancement shaman with nightfall saved the raid 15 minutes?  Ok.
---
I havent played any expansion after TBC and my RP thaught was to create a mage with ambition to become a wizard of the Kirin Tor, and my friend that is possible in later expansions?

Hitting rank8 is casually, and typically the minimum requirement to run with a farming premade. 8-10 is work, but you can get there over a couple month by just binging on your weekends. Finally, a rank13 player who does not make the top 0.08% of players in a given week will actually drop in rank. 0.04% is needed to increase, and they must do this for 5 consecutive weeks to hit 14.

I have played Vanilla and the only reason I wanna return to Classic is to participate in some World PVP. Ill be satisfied with low rank PVP gear.

Yes exactly, it’s like a while faction pooling resources to have one person, their “hero” ring the gong to open Ahn’Qiraj!
---
Didn't miss it :) cata was the best xpac I got it.
---
Totally strange how this has changed. My stepbrother, who came to the US when he was 11, basically learned English and made his first American friends by playing classic WoW.
---
Well, PvP is really more complicated. Geared mage/warlock may just two-shot with crits. Undergeared hunter may just kite until the T3 target dies. 
---
I've also seen a video of a rogue opening on a T3 paladin, barely scratching him for those 10 seconds of stunlock, and then getting oneshot, lol.
---
Probably you're right because melees are more weapon-dependant, so having access to raid weapons gives them more advantage than casters.
---
Did the same thing, except I skipped to the bottom to read what he had to say about hunters which was equally flawed.
---
Cool. Some people rather not carry and rather min/max. 
---
When content is cleared and on farm - have at it.  
---
Different styles and tastes man.
---
Online gaming used to be a social, happening place to meet a ton of people, for better or for worse. Then toxicity got old and voips became freer, as well as console services implementing party chats. I remember when party chat released on XBL back in the 360 days, in game lobbies went from bustling trash talk zones to one 12 year old talking to himself overnight. It was like night and day. Why take the chance of getting called a racial slur by some spazz when you can relax with your buds? But, the comfort lost us something special. I love my online friends, but the amount of people I meet online now are so few and far between, let alone people I connect with. I'm looking forward to Classic alleviating this and meeting new buddies, too!
---
I've seen streamers reject "gifts" in the game because they want to experience the game as everyone else would. Madseason's stream comes to mind. It's not that they don't appreciate the gesture (they certainly do), they just want to give the perspective of what the leveling/playing experience is of a normal play through.
---
Other streamers accept gifts because it makes for a different yet still enjoyable experience that people want to see. They want to see the streamer get most kills in a BG and win in pvp.
---
This is the kind of thing that prevents me from upvoting an otherwise decent meme.
---
It's basic English, folks.
---
Yes, Nightfall was vanilla.
---
I was referring to the whole "solid raid dps", caster buffs and melee buffs.
---
Sure they give some buffs, but resto does just as well.
---
Shamans dps being solid, and spec specific enhanced buffs are all TBC.
---
For what it's worth, enhancement is probably the absolute worst spec to craft a nightfall for. They can't proc it enough.
---
By all means play it, I've raided as elemental my self. Just don't expect it to be any good at all.
---
Gnomes are never worthy.
---
Oh cool I'm awaiting your solution they are implementing
---
lol no
---
Do you not have a phone?
---
And that's a perfectly valid way to play. But then I would say your opinion on dungeons is kinda moot.
---
and wrong.
---
Rogues and hunters can drop combat. It's up in the air how cloaking device works too. It may drop you out of combat as well. 
---
That's not my point anyway. The buffs get removed when you swap. I was saying it would be good, in PvP for example, to use a trinket and swap it out but keep the buff
---
&gt; But how is you're guild going to smash it?
---
We don't need to smash the record for a week one rag kill, but many of us will.
---
&gt;  no one feeding gear potions or portals
---
Not true. We have several people that want to be involved but can't rush to 60. They'll be summoning, farming potions, etc. We have one guy who's only goal is to get to level 25 and fish/farm in Stonetalon for Fire Protection Pots for us.
---
&gt; World record vanilla time of 5 days is for a hunter too
---
The record is 4 days, 20 hours, 52 minutes, 34 seconds
---
&gt; We now know all of the pserver records are because of incorrect exp so all pserver times are unreliable
---
This isn't true. The experience values are correct, we've confirmed them for at least 1-40 thanks to the Beta. Some mobs are missing abilities and there were a few exploits on a few private servers that allowed faster times, but we're not using them.
---
&gt; Is your guild planning to skip potions/flasks/cooking/enchants/etc?
---
No, for a raid team of 40-50, we have another 50+ supporting us.
---
&gt; Also what is your guilds plan for the aoe fire mechanics that required fire res gear in vanilla but never existed on pservers?
---
What Pservers have you been playing on? We've been doing weekly practice runs on our own server and the fire mechanics are definitely there.
---
&gt; Do you guys really think that fire res gear won't be needed for mechanics that no one has really dealt with for 13 years?
---
Of course not, but consumables will help. For the few that absolutely need resist gear, there's a team leveling them round the clock so they can get to 60 with a couple days to farm it out.
---
&gt; How reliable do you guys really think that is given all the significant differences we now know exist between pservers and classic?
---
If you play on the right servers, these differences are small and avoidable. We've been doing speedruns on the beta and on these blizz-like servers to test our routes with a high population. There is some issues with the 1 to 20 routes, but we're working on them. This is why getting to 30 in under 24 hours is so crucial, you'll outpace everyone else and be left alone.
---
&gt; Further, blizz now auto bans account sharing, does your guild have 40 people that their system won't flag?
---
Yes, we've setup local VPN systems so that all the account sharing traffic will come from one IP. This has been tested extensively.
---
&gt; If people are sleeping, does your guild really expect to have 40 people simultaneously beat the world record?
---
Well, we know that sleep is going to suffer that week, but yes, we have more than 40 people dedicated to it. Many of us are sharing and using performance enhancing drugs such as Adderall.
---
You only need lvl 10 enchanting for the wand and I leveled it in the stress test, it costed me about 70s for lvl 10 enchanting.

My favorite video is a [Ninja Loot Parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMylc2Or1Ic)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NbBpp90coQ) and infamous and also hilarious [Molten Core Ninja Loot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMylc2Or1Ic&amp;t=1s)
---
It might be optimal to “holy weave”. But aside from of the highest raids, shadow is “viable”, with 4 warlocks. Just not optimal.
---
i didnt realise that longer videos were back on the rise until recently. We never intended for this video to go on for so long we just got carried away talking about wow classic.
---
I can only guess, but i would assume number of quests is correct, unless the priv servers actually missed entire quests as well. I'm planning to just use that list as kind of a guide to make sure i don't miss any of those quests and see how the reputation looks at around lev40. Right now it seems like the cat mount has got to wait until (or close to) lev60 though. In the very least it's less cloth farming later on.
---
Yeah I don't particularly agree with a lot of it
---
Also we won't have this problem in classic because BOPs will be traceable to anyone who could have looted it for 2 hours like in retail I believe.
---
misery loves company after all
---
Mmm yes. I concur. Reddiquette is important in a circlejerk such as us! Something something narwol bacon.
---
the amount that will swap from Classic to TBC if it releases in 3 years or whatever is going to be so much higher than 40% lol
---
Dear ~overlords~ mods, what was the most hilarious reason you banned someone?
---
Yeah man I remember being on both sides of that coin too. Your comment brought back a ton of memories and I'm sat smiling like a crazy person.
---
Didn't thunderfury come with class restrictions? Not sure if paladins can use it. If so, it would probably be great with the speed and proc that probably scales with sp.
---
as someone that played a bit in vanilla tbc and wrath and a good amount in cata.
---
the game changed drastically in every expansion and cata was a massive downgrade as far as im concerned.
---
&gt;Are pservers not scripting certain abilities?
---
Yea, pservers can't get a lot of boss mechanics to work. The primary one for MC being the huge fire pulse that required entire raids to be in fire res gear. Not being able to get alot of these mechanics to work and having other incorrect values like 5% parry are why pservers raised dmg across the board.
---
&gt;you under estimate the will of guilds like Method
---
I don't underestimate that at all.  I think for too long people have thought of pservers as truth, and that 3 days 1-60 and running right into MC with an entire raid in greens is vanilla like, when it's not. We also still have no idea what these raids will actually look like, and I don't expect raids to be accessible in the beta. Given how many important min max related differences have been found between the current beta and pservers, it's pretty easy to assume we'll be finding plenty more differences in classic raids. Given how little time players will have after hitting 60 to down rag before end of launch week, the unknowns alone could be entire stoppers for downing rag in a week (such as finding out that vanilla players got fire res gear because the fire aoe mechanics are really powerful).
---
The only time I did it in Classic it was me (priest), 3 paladins and a mage, and we were all in there for the first time ever. It took us about 4 hours as we got lost several times.
---
Autowalk on mouse4 = GOAT
---
Humans are still pretty OP with racials and the reason to why so many choose humans.
---
If you’re looking at being world first, then go gnome. If you just want to have fun with the game and still be damn good, go human. Pick whatever racial you would like to play the longest.
---
where did you get the "time to level in an interesting way" part from, your own preference or baseless expectation?
---
My buddy and I watched the original Druid PVP video "Gimped" by Ferahgo in early 2005, we were both in 10th grade at the time. We were so blown away by the video we both made druids on the "Frostmane" server when it launched and were on that server for years.  
---
Some time in 2005 or 2006 Blizzard opened transfers from Frostwolf to Frostmane to help with overcrowding on Frostwolf. Frostmane was behind on raiding/progression by MONTHS. When the players from Frostwolf transferred over, nearly every single major guild on Frostmane imploded/disbanded and the best players immediately joined raiding guilds from Frostwolf.   
---
Ferahgo had played on Frostwolf, and transferred to Frostmane but his name was taken. I forget what he changed his name to, Cyrix or something. My buddy and I at that point were both level 60 and had been playing the game religiously. We got to duel the legend himself on multiple occasions in front of Iron Forge, and beat him quite a few times. It was a pretty cool full circle experience.
---
In addition to the Classic Wowhead database, we also have a skinning guide with the trainers and maps!

---
I remember being dismounted upon entering. I also remember that being a bad thing because I was being chased by a ton of mobs that I ran through because I just needed to get to the town. I remember getting destroyed by the bruisers because one of my abilities had an AOE effect on it. 
---
But I also remember riding through there mounted at some point.

The solution is to roll 5 different paladins.
---
Hah, xerxes, what a guy
---
you mean nothing happens in this video for 5-10 mins or just longer videos in general?
---
just my personal opinion really
---
Tarren Mill and Southshore. What a war that was, also Booty Bay and Ratchet that boat was a loading screen race!
---
The optimal horde raid brings 8 resto shaman, 3 holy priests and 1 resto druid. You definitely won't have trouble finding a spot as a shaman
---
Bloodthirst on cooldown. This is your highest priority.  Always plan to have enough rage to use bloodthirst as its coming off CD. 
---
Second highest priority is whirlwind. Hit this as soon as it comes of CD. 
---
Rage dump with heroic strike of above 80 rage. 
---
Once in execute phase you will only execute (do not build up rage - just hit it as soon as it’s available) - this is until you have about 2k attack power in which case you’ll want to start bloodthirst back in the rotation.
---
There is some debate about stance dancing for overpower procs. General consensus I’ve seen is that once you get even a little bit of decent gear - you just ignore this all together.
---
Until that point you can stance dance if you are less than 40 rage and do not already have flurry procced to try and fish a flurry proc through over power. 
---
Again this last bit is such a minor dps increase I’m not entirely sure it’s worth it after just a few upgrades into raid gear.
---
Only in raids, not dungeons.
---
Neither have I. This is going to open up a whole new realm of easy key bindings for me. For years I used the "R" key to reply because "that's what it's for." 
---
I was such a noob.
---
I can’t imagine upgrading to white gear.
---
I played on Ysondre for most of Vanilla, they were not famous for anything as far as I know. No high-progressing guilds (although one of the Top 10 guilds went there in a later expansion) and not remarkable in any way.
---
You’re right that it will take more time per day than people think... BUT, I think you should also take into account tested XP. Especially when you’re nearing the last 50-60 stretch, getting 2-3 bars of double XP every day is worth something.
---
One last question then: do you think it would be safe to assume that, although the exact values of rep are off, quests that are shown to give high rep do in fact give higher rep and quests that are shown to give little to no rep follow that pattern?
---
Can these databases help you determine in advance which quests to SKIP?
---
Its not working for me. Just gets stuck on searching when i search for a item.
---
That isn't the problem though. We all know that good and bad players existed for all classes. For some reason, a specific demographic really gravitated to that class, especially the ones that had a variation of Legolas for their character name.   
---
There was some serious entitlement issues with a lot of hunter classes, regardless if the item they were rolling on mattered or not. My typical experience with hunters in Vanilla was usually met with no logic in their choices and was always a "me" "me" "me" kind of mentality. Sure, other classes did the similar things, but not on the scale as hunters. The hunter meme didn't just appear for no reason.
---
Well, I mainly PvP'd with destruction spec. Seduce-&gt;Nuke.
---
I only played around with dots during TBC, with the godly SL/SL spec. But it was fun going into a BG and spreading diseases all around. So many numbers popping up on the whole map
---
i agree, sorry to distract form the point. Im justr trying to grasp how attacking once ever 1.5 seconds with a weaker weapon, would be better than attacking every 1.6 seconds with a stronger weapon, which on top of that has a decent chance to proc 2 more swings.
---
Which with a 1 hander you can have the offhand for more stats
---
Xerxes and the DOOM/UNLEASHED drama was the best
---
hahaa this is amazing
---
Druid dps leather is different from rogue leather i thought? Feral scales off strength and AP, not agility (since even in cat form, agi gives no AP). 
---
I may have heard wrong though.
---
Again, I never said that they said blizzard was wrong, just that they compare constantly which is pointless and tiresome. I think you’re too concerned with trying to win a conversation than using your comprehension skills.
---
“Playing Despacito by Luis Fonsi”  Alexa no!!!
---
is there a typical ban type that you see consistently? Like a certain type of post or behavior.
---
Hi, good luck figuring out what class you want to play. It can definitely be a challenge. Here's my two cents.
---
Because you are playing Horde, don't want to play Druid, and you avoiding your friends' class choices, that takes Warrior, Hunter, Druid, Shaman, and Paladin off the table. That leaves Priest, Mage, Warlock, and Rogue.
---
In terms of mobility, Mage have Blink, and Rogue have Sprint. Priests and Warlocks don't have additional mobility. Significant mobility isn't super common
---
Generally speaking, Mages and Rogues are more popular than Priest and Warlock, but Shaman / Healing Priest and Hunter / Rogue do have some gear overlap if that concerns you. Depending on what kind of group PvP you're interested in (World PvP, Pug BGs, Premade BGs), different classes will have different strengths.
---
Generally, Warlocks excel at staying back with fears, DoTs, and direct damage. They can be a great option depending on what your group wants to do.
---
Mages just have so many tools in group PvP (Counterspell, Frost Nova, Sheep, Cone of Cold, Improved Blizzard, etc.) that their slows will always be useful regardless of how much gear you have.
---
Healing as a Priest in PvP is fun. Being able to dispel allied debuffs and enemy buffs and using Mana Burn while not healing gives you a lot of utility - not to mention Power Infusion. Shadow is also an option, but I don't have enough experience with it to advise you on it. From what I understand, Shadow does well in 1v1 and small fights but struggles in larger groups. I'm not sure where the limit of "Group PvP" ends.
---
Because you don't sound too interested in healing, and your group already has a Shaman, Priest may or may not be a good for for what you want to do.
---
And I don't have enough personal experience with Rogues in group PvP to be able to comment on them. Constant Windfury, Battle Shout, and Trueshot Aura though. Good group for Rogue =)
---
If I were you, I would play a Mage for the quality of life abilities you can offer your group (Food, Water, Sheep, Portald, reliable CC) and your utility in PvP. They have burst and decent mobility for what's available. That's my decisive answer. Good luck =)
---
I played both classes.
---
Priest is great because of their OP:ness and versatility. If you choose Dwarf the racials are insane with an Instant self-heal + Fear ward.
---
Shaman is great, but a big con for me was that healing 5-mans is a nightmare until you have MC/ZG gear, which can take a while. I did this back in 05 so things probably changed but still.
---
Also, there are less paths for customizing your character abilities. Strength totem is always going to give X amount of stats, and there only 1 way to spec with Resto. Maybe 2.
---
With priest, you have a lot of flexibility, you can make your Shields more powerful, you can make your casters do more damage (power infusion).
---
If you get really good, you learn how to take mana naps, never go oom. That’s what separates the pros. Every 5 seconds that you’re not casting, your mp5 increases exponentially. So if you time your casts right you never go oom, but many people are unaware of that because it doesn’t explicitly state that anywhere.
---
A lot of people may disagree with this one, but I did it in AQ40. For example, I specced in order to make my Renew as powerful as possible, then used it in bursts on the whole raid. Took a mana nap, rinse and repeat.
---
Because I’m using it in bursts, I have more time to regain mana. This strategy depends on the raid behaving like normal healers, which they usually do, and the strategy is meant to “lighten the load” throughout the entire fight, so that other healers can better conserve their mana. 
---
It’s very in-depth but shamans don’t have the luxury, it’s just spam spam spam. Chain heal, greater heal, lesser heal. Only options. And of course which totems to use. Very 1 dimensional imo
---
It won't be the vintage WoW experience without seeing SusanExpress spam in trade chat!
---
like ill put on a video and for the 5-10 minutes i attempt to watch it idk whats going on
---
think of all that extra time you'll have to play wow classic now...
---
That doesn’t mean you can’t get invited. If you read the FAQ. All you need to be invited is opt-in. You need a sub to log in though.
---
I enjoy watching some of the beta streamers do Amish mode. Only gear from dungeons you run totether or craft in your Amish guild, and permadeath. It was really sad seeing Wowcrendor wall up to the enemy horde Flight master and click it out of habit, only to get two shot.
---
hunter, rogue, warrior, paladin.
---

---
I’m almost positive the auto attack before sap was a thing in Vanilla!
---
"Off-tank" isn't really a role. All Fury Warriors should be prepared to off-tank.
---
What I've been doing is doing [this route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntBxBqcFQeg&amp;t=52s) right off the bat at level 1. I'll take the Hidden Path, jump into the river between Ratchet and Durotar ([check to see if there's a chest - up to 10s from the trash sometimes!](https://puu.sh/DBLQF/9c719877c4.jpg)), bank my gear in Ratchet, take the flight path and die between Ratchet and the Crossroads, Spirit Rez at Crossroads and learn the flight path. 
---
At this point, you should consider pulling a mob near a Crossroads guard and have them kill it (tag it!) and try looting [10 copper worth of trash](https://puu.sh/DBMFZ/141eda575b.jpg). After you've done that head south and die around where Mankirk's wife is located to spirit res at Camp Taurajo. Learn Skinning there and learn the flight path. Head east into Mulgore and make it past the third torch on the path and die to respawn at Bloodhoof Village. From there, stay on the road and make your way to Thunder Bluff, retrieve your gear from the bank and [learn the flight path](https://puu.sh/DBMb3/9caa6a058e.jpg) before finally hearthing back to Durotar.
---
@ /u/UbiGeofram Runda was added in Cataclysm. There are no Skinning or Leatherworking trainers in Durotar.
---
I plan on playing a Druid.
---
Main reason they struggle is that they suffer from the "hybrid tax" which was an actual design philosophy back then.
---
You have to be willing to play any role as a Druid, and that means collecting quite a few different gear sets and keeping them on hand (during a time frame when bag space was actually something you had to manage).
---
Druids can tank, but they'll never be the MT. They can heal but they'll never match a Priests output. They can DPS, but will never match a Rogue/Lock/Mage.
---
Main advantage to a Druid is add fights. There's a lot of trash pulls in raids where this is actually relevant. Also fights like Garr or Majordomo (where you want a LOT of tanks for a short period of time). We can off-tank an add until it's dead then pop out of bear form and off-heal while dropping an Innervate on the better healers. IMO, the major advantage here is that Druid Healers make better off-tanks than Warrior off-tanks makes DPS (thus freeing up your Warriors to actually roll as DPS in raids).
---
If you want to be the star of the show, Druid isn't a strong pick. If you want to play a true support role, Druids are awesome.
---
They're also amazing in wPvP and BGs. I always wished I'd played one the first time around, stoked I get the chance.
---
Ah yes. 1-2 minute person like myself. I too only view 1-2 minutes. Especially in my porn habits.
---
Nah, see this here is where everyone is thinking with their emotions, that is why they are wrong and will die. Arthas for as cold blooded as he seems is the only one thinking with logic. Regardless of what Jaina thinks he can and cannot do and regardless of how hurt Uthers feelings got there were only two choices.
---
Cull the city before they turn or die when an entire city turns and charges you. If there are any other choices besides those-- or running away like Uther and Jaina did then feel free to enlighten me. If they truly cared for Arthas or the inhabitants of Stratholm then they should have done anything other then turning a blind eye and running away.
---
I noticed this with the recent MK11 release. People were very upset that they had to actually put a lot of time and effort into unlocking everything and it was not basically given to them in the first week after release.
---
Keep in mind streamers have Bis Gear, won't be like that while levelling.
---
Yeah, I know it goes against #nochanges but I would have absolutely no problem with there being a group finder so long as literally all it does is find you a group.  In fact, I would welcome it.  No insta-travel or anything like that.
---
a cutting-edge guild wont wait until their raider have pre-raid BIS to smash molten core.
---
get enough defense gear to get 2 or 3 tank capped while another group is AoE farming hydraxian waterlord rep.. everyonelse will be in quest gear.
---
Warlock is great. Summons are nice when someone leaves the dungeon early.
---
I bought one a few days ago, no regrets, it's an amazing piece of WoW's history.
---
Nope. Hes going tailoring to make greens to DE because it is incredibly cheaper to craft tailor greens than buy boe off the AH. Once you have enough uku can drop tailor pick up enchanting. 
---
Leather working is actually faster than tailoring cuz you level while farming mats for crafting greens.
---
Ah I see you also are a man of taste
---
This is my go to. 1-5, a few letters (this depends on style), and then same combo but with shift, then ctrl, then alt
---
Like, I can listen to Sam Seder or Michael Brooks waffle around something for a half hour, but they are talking about serious stuff and reflecting. A lot of these guys are just rephrasing the same point over and over or doing livechat stuff.
---
It literally says "participants must have an active subscription"
---
Woosh
---
can you post the macros youre testing?
---
On one server, absolutely, they will have 40 bodies to toss into Mc. But on most servers, it will be hard finding enough people to do MC week 2 even. Keep in mind, Private servers are up to 10k turbonerds that already have to jump through hoops to install the game. Regular servers are (should be) 2-4K people of varying degrees of fandom.
---
Hmmmmm
---
&gt; So would a trigger effect like nightfall (i think thats corruption right) be able to be on the main boss target?
---
Unlikely. Debuffs like curse of elements will accomplish magnitudes more than single-cast DoTs will.
---
&gt; And how would you handle 5 locks, only 1 gets nightfall?
---
You'd want to organize your specs so not everyone relies on nightfall. Warlocks can also go demonic sacrifice + ruin.
---
&gt; So if you have 8 fire mages theres only 1 ignite debuff? Thats pretty crazy and does that just count for damage as the initial lucky mage (so the other mages are just boosting that mages dmg)?
---
That's right. Keeping track of true mage DPS becomes difficult.
---
pretty sure this is the wrong comment you replied to
---
Or even more interesting... only one character at all.
---
I've rerolled very often in Vanilla. And mostly that was on a new server. There always was something other classes had that I wanted to have...
---
I started with a warlock but eventually I was overwhelmed with all the things I had and wanted something more simple.
---
Then I played a warrior. It fulfilled the simplicity-criteria well. But I felt so weak compared to basically any other class.
---
Next I thought hunters where cool. But I felt too restricted in what I could do.
---
So I rolled a druid. I really liked being able to fulfill several roled. But then I saw a mage killing like 10 mobs at once with improved blizzard...
---
...and rolled a mage.
---
Now I actually switched back and forth between the mage and the druid... but I got jealous at our maintank, who did not get the comment "unhealable" when tanking Hakkar.
---
So I ended up making another Warrior.
---
BC came out when this Warrior was at about level 50.
---
I could have reached so much more had I stuck to one character. :o
---
I have no claims to remembering vanilla 100% accurately lol, I was 10 when it first came out. There are German Shepards out there that are smarter than 10 year old me.   
---
* I can't disagree with people generally liking those kinda games more now, in the span of the 15 years gaming has gone from a relatively niche thing to something that is entirely mainstream. With that said, that doesn't mean there still isn't a market of old and new players alike who crave a more real MMORPG experience.  
---
* I didn't intend to claim that it is actual easier, just that 60 sounds way less daunting to someone who has never played any of the WoW xpacks. But IMO an argument has to be made for 1 world with 60 levels of slow grind vs 120 levels and 7 expansions with of content that new players just breeze through in 2-6 days /played.  
---
* Even though it may be slower and more tedious, my argument is that players are more appropriately rewarded along the grind to 60 than they are at any point from 0-120 in retail.   
---
* It may not be the deciding factor in whether a newer player decides to pick Classic over BFA, but still in my mind it's undeniable the difference between a new economy and one that has been over saturated with basically everything since cata/mop. One game you're logging into something that is a relatively even playing field, vs the other where players have hoarded millions and millions of gold over the course of the years the game has been around.  
---
* Call me a dreamer, but I don't think that just because easy and accessible games are the norm in 2019, doesn't mean that old and new players alike won't get hooked (again) on a game that actually requires time to get good at. A game that rewards you for using your brain. Don't get me wrong, I don't think Classic will overtake League or Fortnite in terms of players, it won't. But I really believe people have been craving a MMO that isn't a complete pushover. My argument isn't that Classic is "New Player Friendly", as Classic isn't really friendly at all, in the sense of holding your hand through content. My argument is that it appeals to both vet and new player alike. And it does.
---
Having both strafe and turn keys allow for greater mobility when moving and changing targets with the mouse or keeping targets in your camera's view at the same time. Doesn't matter in PvE for the most part, but I'd definitely feel limited in PvP. There is still plenty of keys without E and Q.
---
You will need to do cloth turn in’s if they are available, or turn in many pristine yeti hides which you will have to be above level 40 for. I am pretty sure it is impossible without these two.
---
Good for you man!
---
You aren’t bringing a boomkin to any raid for their “omgdeepz” so...
---
Good to know. Do I need different gear for destro than dotlock?
---
I plan on being both Arms PvP and PvE Fury.....I can't remember the Vanilla respec system...pay a lot of gold?
---
Weird I had an account banned for mentioning one. Though this was back at 30k subs or so
---
I am both appalled and intrigued 🤯
---
&gt; level 60 classic-style Karazhan
---
nerdgasm
---
I was playing on a different server during BC so I wasn't around for the Warglaives. I remember fighting Blood Legion and Team Ice all around Blackrock though. Good times.
---
Private servers already proved the nostalgic factor wrong.
---
OT and fury can kind of be rolled into one. I plan on being fury DPS and offtanking raids/tanking 5-mans.
---
I can almost bet that the people complaining were probably hunters, :P
---
Fury is the best from pre-raid to naxx. You’ll have no trouble being top dps in MC
---
Literally the same ratio either way.
---
😂😂😂👍
---
None of your damn business bro
---
From What i've heard 1660's are not really worth it.
---
Makes me debating actually leveling leatherworking for devilsaur crafts.
---
Maybe the fact that no sane person would want to farm hundreds upon hundreds of the same poorly-designed, shitty weapon from fucking Gnomeregan just to be viable?
---
Why would anyone do that when they can just go Holy and still contribute more?
---
That has less to do with modern games and more to do with modern social media. People talked a lot in old MMO days because they had to, and there were no other means of communicating unless you were already in a group/guild that use voice comms. In general, a lot of people are burned out on the whole social media thing so Classic is like a breeze of fresh air essentially forcing players to communicate to accomplish goals. We're just bombarded with social media today that some people just want to disconnect and focus on alone time - especially with how fake social media truly is.
---
dat CTRL 6 is for Taurens only
---
Warlock has really minimal downtime, same with hunter and druid.
---
But in endgame, your best bet is probably druid. You will get dungeon groups far easier as a healer!
---
Beavis was a beast but he has wotlk videos. Early wotlk 2 hander enhancemrnt
---
Reading comprehension isn’t a strong suit is it.
---
[Read this.](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/breaking/22988589) notice how it says to get invited you need to opt-in. To participate (aka be a participant) you need active game time. So you can be invited without a sub, however you won’t be able to log in and play the beta without a sub.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN8puAGksfo
---
Not really, they are few and far between, MOTW is amazing, and having a raid healer is really helpful! (Yes you can tank heal, not as "efficiently" as a priest or paladin)
---
a lot of people dont think fire res gear will be needed in MC because it wasn't needed back in 2004.
---
maybe 2-3 juicy piece per person for ragnaros... but getting that buff from UBRS take care of the FR requirement. And except ragnaros, nothing in MC have ''large fire AoE''.
---
Also, a cutting-edge guild wont bother waiting until everyone is in pre-raid BIS , nor do they need everyone with hydraxian waterlord rep, nor do they need everyone with maxed professions.
---
Are you mashing the button to get all those commands through, or is it a single press that's shifting, charging, returning all at once?
---
DrakeDog 6 is probably the pinnacle of classic PvP vids imo
---
[Watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPjngFs8dOg)
---
I’m going to level my first warrior, and instead of worrying about raid, progression...I’m just gonna do it for the feels. Once you get past BWL you pretty much gotta give up your life and I have no plans on getting past BWL, but after a few years who knows.
---
Pixar doesn't change the point at all. What we're you thinkin?
---
Would also Take a other GPU, but other than that it Looks good
---
Hello darkness my old friend... I've come to talk with you again...
---
I’m surprised it didn’t get needed!
---
Its definitely doable but to be raid ready in a month is difficult especially since you need other max levels to help with that. I hope to have a level 60 within a month of release but I dont actually expect it. I expect to be just above 50 after a month.
---
Thanks for the sub :) got tons of vids coming really wish i coulda got into the beta....LET ME INNNNN !!!
---
At least in the starter zone quests there was variation in both ways (low rep quests giving a bit more in the classic beta), so you could expect the same thing later on as well too. Also many of the little to no rep -quests seem to be parts of chains that eventually lead into a bigger rep reward, so personally i wouldn't skip any of them just to be sure.
---
So yes I have not played as a warlock during 1.12; however, I did play shortly after that and remember dueling my Hunter friend during his High Warlord grind. (sadly he only made it to Warlord)  
---
Yes orcs warlocks were rare because ppl didn't know how to even play this new game, there was no information about anything, no statistics like we have now. I remember healing on my first character (Paladin) and nothing made any sense.
---
There was already a server named Mal'Ganis right? I think its a US server. Blizzard stated that the Classic server names will be different and have new names than the current servers.
---
Make sure to have spammable abilities on buttons close to your movement keys. Ex. Sinister Strike on E.
---
Fast-reaction things should be either on a single key or at most a shift+key bind. Ex. PvP Trinket. You want to minimize the amount of time it takes to press it.
---
Those are the important things to get right.
---
Its okay, you can be wrong.
---
Yeah years ago someone coined a WoW Ironman mode which is different than what I previously described, so I wanted to be clear. 
---
I’ve also considered gathering a group of 40 to work as a guild in this format. No trading/grouping with players outside of the guild, no auction houses. Now... to get an entire server playing that way would make for some real entertainment/competition/immersion.
---
I remember some top guilds like Doom and Pie on horde and Gaia on alliance.
---
It's not new.
---
stuff being easy won't stop people from min-maxing the heck out of it...
---
Luckily plate drops are one of the few things they can't claim are hunter items.
---
My account is from 04 and I don’t have beta. I also noticed I never cancelled the reoccurring subscription when I quit (mommy’s cc ofc) for a couple years after from 2007-2011. Give beta
---
&gt; In Vanilla you only get the mana buff if drain soul gets the killing blow. You don't get it if your pet or any of your dots get the final blow.
---
As long as the final source of damage came from one of your spells, you got the buff. If your pet got the KB, you did not get the buff. The tooltip even says "...if the target is killed by you while you drain its soul."
---
You too.
---
No it isn't. Adding the Paladin and Shaman populations together assumes they'll have equal representation. Nearly all the polls show that Shaman is more popular than Paladin.
---
I'd love to see the conversion rate of success chance of "if you reached level X on at least 1 character, your odds of reaching 60 on at least 1 character was Y%".  I bet that would be awesome data.
---
But these days with the amount of theorycrafting done, a boomkin can easily sustain their mana through a fight with an acceptable rotation.
---
That build is OP for WoW. My build is a couple years old now and less powerful than that and it kills WoW.
---
It's not genius...it means that you can't jump while holding shift for any of your other shift-modifier keybinds.
---
Can confirm. I mained a gnome in 2005 and it got me nowhere
---
I already have a bad knee from squatting too much weight. My roommate who is the same age has a bad shoulder. It happens sooner sometimes
---
Runecloth, herbs, leather, farming elites in winterspring/EPL/WPL.
---
AOE grinding is harder for warlock as the voidwalker isn't the best at AOE threat, as such farming harder targets is better.
---
Said nobody.
---
I thought about that ofc, but from my experience there’s always a few specific warriors who fully intend to have a tank set to offtank.. and there’s also those warriors who will only have a sword and board for those moments
---
Too bad It's in Beta... right? You won't have it after the release, assuming they will not keep characters and do a full wipe.
---
yep
---
the dungeon/raid finder made people have to like the game, not like the community. 
---
when you have to interact with others to find a dungeon it isn't as much about the dungeon as about the people you are fighting with.
---
when you just match up in a finder you better have the most fun and addictive dungeons that exist.
---
That's neat, didnt realise it had a key binding
---
Whats the Wetlands skip?
---
Back in the days when I bought my first Kodo. Hell, ive been literally crying.
---
Yes, shadow form and Soul Link offer an enormous boost. Keep in mind though, World PVP is less about surviving and more about harassing especially while leveling. Just be prepared.
---
If you bought all those that’s a lot of money! I’m on book 10 of the Wheel of Time Audiobook right now and I’ve really enjoyed it.
---
Wait for the new 2060.
---
One thing I didn't even think about till now: never logging off in an inn. If you didn't log off in an inn, and therefore very, very slowly gained rest experience, maybe then you'd be able to get a reputation mount at level 40.
---
I remember playing in vanilla WoW. I had a few characters that I did nothing except for grind mobs. No quests, no dungeons. Just grinding mobs. Those were my collector characters. Gathering professions only. Mailed all the materials to my mains, a tank and a healer. I never worried about leveling them. They stayed in the zone that I put them in because I needed materials from that specific zone.If/when I get back into WoW, which I probably will once classic is released, this is exactly what I will be doing again.
---
Poopsock 
---
?
---
That's retail. You may as well be comparing classic wow to fucking prince of Persia
---
fair
---
The crowd pummelers should have 90 seconds of up time since they have three charges. It's probably better to swap to an ironfoe after you use the first pummeler tho
---
no sharpening stone ?
---
There are people in this thread with less than that that on Nost https://old.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/454zpf/vanilla_what_is_your_fastest_solo_160_leveling/
---
That's literally what old school PvP videos were though. That's a classic experience. Except maybe big blue dress by cranius.

I always used R as interrupts too lol

My main CC is 5, my gap closer is 4, my secondary cc/slow i N.

According to [this BiS list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#) you're right, the overlap pretty much ends after pre-raid.
---
Doing random quests with other random people in Tanaris back in vanilla, this dropped, we all agreed to just roll greed for it, random warrior waits for us to roll, needs it, then leave group.
---
So when listing the requirements to get invited they list having a subscription?
---
OSRS is the closest I can think of.
---
Yea but the game is punishing to people who have zero attention span. Its going to bleed the community of much impatience. Thats the point, people who arent into one style of play go and play a game that suits them.
---
Its a cycle, retail changed the community just as much as the community changed retail. 
---
Plus, id take occasionally painful (classic) over constantly empty/lonely (retail) any day.
---
I think you missed OP's point. In a sprint Boomkin aren't terrible, same with Ele Shamans. The issue comes from mana management which both classes are atrocious at. A Boomkin can keep up with the mages for the first 30-60 seconds, but after that they're stuck meleeing because they're oom.
---
1:12
---
I mean umm, I already was. Also, way to back up your argument there. Are you basing this all on what the coolkids are saying, or having actually played Vanilla?
---
Definitely post at a prime time if you dont mind. I find that distribution very interesting. Was surprised to see the top 5 classes so evenly distributed. Still surprised how low the warlock count is. Makes me want to roll a warlock now haha.
---
&gt; I honestly don't think I'm exaggerating when I say I believe that the future direction of online gaming in particular, and gaming in general, is riding on the reception we give to WoW Classic.
---
This feels right.  Gamers have an opportunity to show Blizzard in particular, but developers as a whole, that we aren't kidding when we say we quit because of the garbage of mtx and cash shops.
---
Because they changed their design philosophy over time
---
Establish a philosophy of what made classic good and keep to it, shouldn't be too difficult
---
Yes, respeccing 1-2 times a week will be expensive
---
This sub reminds me of the Wii episode of South Park.
---
All y'all Cartmans need to chill the fuck out, man. 3 months go by in a flash at our age.
---
Was hunter disengage a jump back in vanilla or just a threat reduction? I distinctly remember using it in wotlk to survive jumping off a cliff in icecrown.
---
I’m my guilds main off tank, our MT is the guild master and he works from home, I work late 1 week a month and won’t be able to have 100% raid attendance. So yes I’m planning to be an off tank.
---
Keep in mind fire mage = much worse in MC and BWL due to fire resistance, so that is also another thing to consider, WHICH raid you are talking about!
---
Well, basically you get the best peice you can get and don't have much choice in stats.
---
But usually I liked +crit. Which is useless for affliction because dots can't crit in vanilla.
---
You could do that in vanilla.
---
I fixed some of that, thanks.  You are right Feral could switch to OT immediately if needed.
---
The 1660ti is fine. The 1660, not as much.

This is what layering is for.

Ashenvale/Barrens border is one of my favorite spots to gank. Watching the little hordling cross the border for the first time and then immediately oneshotting them from stealth gives a nice little "welcome to the real game" effect.

gnowhere*
---
i feel world first guilds will know how much fire res gear they need and can probably acquire a good amount of it in 1 day, along with some nice other items, even if they level up in 6 days max they can then do MC on the seventh day
---
Would you say in certain areas I could get away and still stream/handle WoW perfectly fine?
---
You mean wait for a card that's been out for a few months?
---
No they should not, not in fury spec. they will kill your main tank
---
does everyone not realize that the classic client they are using on beta actually already is 1.13 ?...technically we should be talking about 1.14
---
That wasn't what j was saying at all.

Well... if you think about it: Bleach is mostly water. And we're mostly water.

So... we are bleach.

That cave is possibly one of the most tense spots in all of wow. Everyone there is always super on edge, and you can feel it in the air.

no, if you can just throw your garbage, then you dont need to take time away from the computer to  clear the clutter
---
Don't cut yourself on that edge

No, the Super line is rumored out soon.
---
Refreshing new pays off. Love it
---
aaah yes, the 'difficulty' of having a 90% resist rate / miss rate because the boss level is much higher than yours.... which will totally happen in MC at release... and is totally the same thing as dealing with 12 mechanic at once like retail mythic raider do...
---
I've heard people use the term but didn't really understand what it meant.
---
This is false. Taurens do not get the Org flight path by default.
---
I feel like me and you would be good friends. I took a week off work to level at launch with Wildstar. I was max level the next sunday but I had played the beta and knew where to go. I also grinded the content nonstop that entire week. Wildstar will always be my vanilla WoW experience. I'm pretty sure classic launch will be similar for me since I never played vanilla.
---
My vanilla guild had terribly bad dps players and we cleared vael + the rest of bwl and up to twin emps in aq40.
---
If you can get the Corsair 3200 ram for less than a $10 difference do that .

---
from a value, longevity standpoint? what are some interesting options to replace?
---
Layering will help with that. Best advice though is you are having to wait for a mob to spawn then you arnt getting XP. Just move on to the next quest instead of waiting and come back to it another time.
---
You're bringing up your memory of when you dueled people 15 years ago. What's the point arguing with that? 
---
I could say good warlock will kill your tremor with their pet and fear you anyway, and that the shaman PvP trinket is one of the worst in the game, but what's the point. 
---
Making up some theoretical scenarios where one class beats the other is pointless. Nobody wins tournaments on shaman. Maybe the lvl 40 one will suprise me but I doubt it.
---
Nice. But that speed is with no competition for mobs and such. 
---
Are u grouping up, or just solo questing?
---
Appreciate the answers!  Vanilla raiding is so different from what I'm used too lol.  I raided in BC/wrath, then much more in legion/BFA.  In vanilla I was a level 30 shammy noob with 6 level 20 alts by the time BC hit.
---
Honestly I'm all for playing hybrids and don't really care what people do either way, but this constant acting as if guilds that optimize don't have fun, or that ALL the fun and sociable people play subpar hybrids is annoying as fuck. Yes, if you meet a cool guy who plays balance druids it can be fun to let him raid with you, but there will be just as many cool people playing warriors and priests, plus plenty of miserable people playing weird hybrid specs.
---
to have fun?
---
Feral tanks aleady farm pummeler.
---
I am also doing some research into if Ironfoe would be better or damn near the same
---
I also remember looking back and seeing all the healers that just stood around, imagine being able to have more spot healers like a spelladin, someone who would heal when they need to, but then do some good burst damage.
---
Same, i cant wait for not being handed everything over so easy as retail does it. Also no lvl boosts.
---
Both spellings are okay. It's grEy for England and grAy for America! Fuck yeah!
---
Felwood, had some amazing fights while farming felcloth and those consumable things that spawn there.
---
I had 3 level 80s by the time I quit, all having farmed a fair amount for rep and stuff, and I only saw 1 world epic drop, ever.
---
The fact that we have this discussion and the meme shows that one thing changed compared to previous betas... the fact that you have to be a sub to get in.   
---
Please elaborate, what do you think made this change necessary?
---
Absolutely! I definitely enjoy questing, but some ranges it's just too fragmented and the quest rewards aren't worth all the traveling. In specific ranges, I'll do specific quests that I know will be worth the travel, but for the most part I simply grind mobs. Really looking forward to doing this again.
---
This is just not true. Warriors are heavily gear dependent.  They don't really start scaling up until BWL gear. MC they will not be top.
---
no no not at all, in fact mage is my main.  That didn't change the fact that you spent the first 20 minutes of a raid giving out food/water and casting int buff.
---
I really want an undead warrior with a wolf.
---
like this?

---
Sorry, misread original comment. I meant doubling the faction specific or halving the non-specific classes for comparison would be the same.
---
I enjoyed it all the way up through WotLK. In Cataclysm it started feeling like even my best abilities didn't hit hard enough or in a satisfying way. Really hard to put my finger on it exactly, but like they just averaged out your damage too much over too many abilities. Instead of one thing every 3-4 seconds hitting hard as hell, you had something hitting every 1.5 seconds that felt more like a dream where you're throwing underwater punches.
---
Frame it man! Keep that paper safe! I love that it looks a little weather worn. 
---
THAT'S HISTORY RIGHT THERE! PRESERVE IT!
---
Surprised Rogues are so low, aren't they usually just behind Warriors? Maybe there won't be as many as people are thinking like it usually is.
---
I'm torn between a few options.
---
In vanilla, I mained a human warrior. I was terrible at the game, so part of me wants to reroll my warrior and play the game right this time. 
---
In TBC, I mained a human mage. I loved the free food/water, portals, teleports, blink, AOE, etc. 
---
In Wrath, I mained a human death knight. I loved absolutely everything about this class but obviously I can't make one of these in classic.
---
I never played Horde so I'm tempted to make a shaman for something totally different, but I'm worried I'll miss the Alliance zones too much. 
---
Warlock always interested me...from the first time I saw someone drop an infernal in Goldshire.
---
Priests also interest me because they're always wanted and can mind control.
---
I love the lore behind paladins, but the leveling experience sounds boring as hell. 
---
Rogues also sound badass but they'll be everywhere, especially since I'll be on a PVP server.
---
I think I'll drop warrior and mage from consideration since I've already been there, done that. Paladin too since the leveling process isn't very exciting.
---
I probably won't be raiding much, if at all. Dungeon set 1 and 2 is probably the furthest I'll go in PVE. 
---
I'm so damn indecisive &gt;_&lt;
---
given how its a WIP im not sure how much they are certain pummeler is better.
---
Surely for the amount of effort of having atleast 9 pummelers a week wouldnt be any fun, on top of the extensive consume list (which is doable, typically tanks already do this sort of stuff)
---
Every one reads stuff in bed. Newspapers, books ext. But its the "NEED" to check social media, as a morning priority that is unique to the younger generations.
---
Bingo
---
Poe league tomorrow
---
It most definitely is real. Source played at Light’s Hope for a long time now.
---
Oh shit that's amazing
---
Interestingly enough I never got ganked at the border as a horde player. I even had the "balls" to quest in Ashenvale because I liked the area and had little issues, if anything I use to gank Alliance there. I guess when you are a Rogue yourself you can usually avoid that kind of crap and cheese it.
---
I probably avoided the area while leveling my Mage.
---
I could be misremembering, but the fraps watermark means this is the trial version and I think had a limitation on fps is could record, so you probably played with something a BIT smoother.
---
Who cares about the number the thought is what matters.
---
(Not opposed to 1.14 tho)
---
That means you need to have a sub to play it if you get invited. Read above where it says what you need to do get invited.
---
it's the difference between player having nothing to do except open world PvP, and player having the option to PvP where level and number are equals (aka, skill is the factor)
---
Thanks, its been almost 3 hours since someone mentioned 1.13.
---
You can be specced fury without tanking DW. Fury threat MT is a totally different thing and a different spec.
---
It will be a slog. The servers will be overwhelmed, mobs will be overrun and quests specific items will require queues. I feel bad for anyone who took that week off thinking it will go smoothly. I still think if you're going to take time off for a video game its best to aim for when you hit 60 for vacation time.
---
They do not. When listing requirements for invite it is opt in only. Notice how it says to be invited you need to opt in..  To participate aka log in it requires a subscription.
---
Notice how it’s two separate sentences. Which means to separate things. If it required sub for invite it would read something like: to be invited to the beta you need to opt-in and have an active sub.
---
i assume that would be 1 press. Like how you can 1 press macro to shift out of a form, drink a potion, and shift back into a form instantly
---
"you need X to do Z. You also need Y to do Z". I'm not going to conclude from that that Y is completely irrelevant to getting Z.
---
this is ace you should deffo frame it!
---
Yep!
---
https://youtu.be/ghrENzVM1vA
---
Haha thanks, that's a really good idea actually, I might just do that.
---
Yet they still offer things to the group/raid even while oom.
---
agreed
---
Spelling Nazis
---
They're different.
---
I really only just started the game like maybe an hour played so far but I heard a massive DLC is coming in a few months, so I might just wait for it. I'm not sure which difficulty I am on right now, but yeah I am looking forward to it.
---
No. Because that wasnt in vanilla.
---
this is all part of the fun
---
They’re the same kind of terrible.
---
You will not generate enough thread really without dw.
---
Rather have a druid tank then since they get most of their rage from attacks unlike my fellow warriors.
---
"You need X to do Z. You also need Y to do Z". From that I am not going to conclude that you do not need Y
---
It'll die off whenever everyone starts telling them to fuck off back to retail then if they don't like it.
---
Yep. And this is why I don't think worrying about post-naxx or BC is important.
---
Classic is classic. The most important thing is proving that people want games designed with this philosphy. Developers will notice this.
---
They had the right idea at the start, shame it took a few expansions to get druids right.
---
I'll be rolling a druid aswell as alt to help tank for my friends but i realize they arent first pick in terms of roles sadly.
---
rogues are suprisingly low down on the list, usually behind warriors
---
Even though we'll have Layering i think it'll be a huge Deathmatch / Free for All :D
---
Keep going till 60 lol
---
Y'all need to go outside seriously.
---
I don't understand the anger for resubbing and not getting beta. You gambled and you lost. It happens, just move on!
---
I stopped raiding after BC but from everything I hear you'll have an easy time raiding in vanilla. People say raids got much more complicated with time.
---
So you dont want any more content. Forever?
---
Blizzard already said they are open for more content in the future if the community wants it :)
---
Bullshit. Current WoW is a steaming pile of horse shit compared to classic. The injections you are probably talking about would turn it into the same pile of shit again. No thanks. Raids are supposed to be hard to accomplish. Resistances made sense. You use the word "compelling" as a shorter way of saying instantly gratifying.
---
I would start with just 3-4 keybinds (attack abilities) and just get used to that against mobs for a week.  Then, whenever you are comfortable, add one new keybind.  Repeat.
---
You will come to the point of getting frustrated that you don’t have more abilities keybound once you start enjoying the ones that you do.
---
But it is. They listed the requirements and having an active sub isn’t one so don’t chat shit if you don’t know how to read.
---
I have a feeling that Classic is going to absolutely pop off and get insanely popular in the 4th quarter of this year, as well as retain most of the sustained popularity. It's gonna be so popular/relevant again, that there will be contrarions disliking it 'because it's too popular'. At this point I don't think this is just an overshot prediction, it seems entirely plausible.
---
If I'm wrong, that's fine - Classic is a Niche game, and I'm ok with being a part of that.
---
If I'm right, however - I can't wait to tell every doubter in the world "i told you so!"
---
haha wasnt expecting porn to pop up in the comments
---
Super...
---
If you're talking about what to do during the level cap in beta, farm your BiS gear, make an alt, take a break?
---
If you're talking about post-release, I'd encourage you to work towards level 41
---
Just on the stress test it was pretty bad, so yeah, although layering will *help*, the design (which a lot of people apparently want, because "no changes" and "the world feels full and alive when 6,823 orcs all need six boars, and there are only twenty up at maximum") will yield dozens of players or more competing for the same exact objectives in the same exact locations for hours.
---
Faction-tag-sharing in modern WoW was created specifically to alleviate this problem. There are still collection quests in, say, the Barrens that are awkward in a group, let alone when the area is popular, but it's better. It's something I'm not looking forward to, much as I'm still looking forward to Classic.
---
Nobody wins -what- tournaments on shaman? Specifically?
---
I know what warlock can do. I was a warlock most of Vanilla. It was that experience that made me feel this way because while I could take a Shaman, it was the most difficult fight I had back then.
---
I’ve been a paladin aince Vanilla through BFA and love the fantasy, I also have a paladin tattoo. However, shooting a bow is so cool and leveling as a hunter is the best experience out there imo. I keep getting torn. Could someone give me some pros/cons of each class?
---
Great post.  I hope Classic WoW has enough magnitude to make a change.  The commercial success of games like Dark Souls have always been a ray of hope as well!
---
I meant no offesnse I just didn't see it.
---
Anyway quite interesting. 1100 dps is pretty decent on single target will full worldbuffs debuffs. Though I'm a bit worried about the perma nightfall up . Also you take one debuff (well 2 with the mana thing but that probably won't be neccesary), but still quite impressive.
---
Sounds awesome, looking forward to it!
---
I feel targeted
---
hit 60, get lots of decent gear, then start raiding to get the best gear. You could also start pvping if you wanted
---
Proudmoore-US. World first Sun’s Reach event during Burning Crusade, heavy Alliance side population imbalance, and lots of gay people.
---
They always stuck a shaman with the healers when i raided in vanilla. They had mana totem up and would get yelled at if it went away for more than a millisecond. 
---
I raided as a holy priest where 3 max rank greater heals meant you were out of mana. 
---
fun times.
---
This was legit hilarious. When the chest is down in the arena and everyone jumps down fighting at 100 miles per hour oh my god hahahahaha.
---
i totally get that with some people on youtube
---
What region are you planning to play in? I have a couple real life friends that will be playing alliance North America (PvP server) if you’re interested.
---
Sounds like Warlock to me..
---
The book of yore
---
Worlock are great for solo play but yeah when it comes to group content mages beat them in put numbers
---
DW tanking wasn't even a thing in vanilla, and yet people managed to clear all the content with dps spec OTs. 
---
DW tank is a pserver phenomenon, and a recent one too, it has only become the new meta in the last year or so.
---
Hahah, happy you enjoyed it man
---
You could say the same about the many OSRS private servers, but the general reaction to them vs. the actual launch of OSRS is completely different.
---
I thought the balance is still roughly similar isn't it?
---
Where do they list all of the requirements and not mention an active sub?
---
That makes literally no sense. Why would you want to spend more time playing something if it doesn't bring you more fun. I personally don't want to carry some Ret Pally through MC/Ony to have him become useless in BWL and beyond. Just because you've paid the 15 dollars a month doesn't mean I want to spend an extra half hour in raids twice a week because someone demands they be able to bring a non-viable spec.
---
I watched this guide I liked it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-OsvFBiXE&amp;t=2036s
---
I also started on a private server just to test them out while I wait since I have nothing else to do.
---
Some of us are solo, some of us are groups, mostly depends on the class. We have a few people who are going to be running a few key dungeons round the clock even after they stop getting experience from them so those that need/want them won't have to find a group.
---
Shift-W for autorun
---
On purpose. It's more delicious that way.
---
Now this is quality content creation right here!
---
If you like Warlocks then definitely go that way. Also, Undead &gt; Humans, don't @ me
---
In queue? What is this queue you speak of in Classic?
---
Maybe level 41, then possibly level 42 after that.
---
That's just...dawwwwww.
---
I have a razor naga and its amazing for wow.
---
Not terrible
---
Wow priests are 2nd highest?
---
It doesn’t say also. It says for invite you need x. To participate you need y. I’m going to conclude comprehending English isn’t a strong suit.
---
What would be funny if they used classic as the "Reset" they were always talking about needing. Specifically if they plan on future content patches
---
Basically using classic to reset the game and start from scratch again. Turn all the other expansions into "Classic" and retire them and move forward with classic as the main game.
---
Classic WoW launch will be THE BIGGEST launch in MMORPG history. No other game will even come close to the numbers that Classic will pull in Day 1.
---
I am sure that a lot of people are expecting 2-3 millions on launch day...it will be at least twice that number.
---
We will see Blizzard announcing the numbers at launch, even if they wanted or not, because as it stands now, they NEED a big win in the gaming market.
---
I am personally expecting more than 6 millions at launch. I might be crazy, but hey, there gotta be some crazy dudes out there, so why not me :D.
---
The Classic launch will be akin to the Second Coming (Vanilla was the first) in MMORPG genre.
---
EVERYONE is preparing for this, not only Blizzard.
---
The word TSUNAMI will not be enough to describe what will happen on August 27th., 2019. A.D.
---
You should probably play Hunter, they're the only class that can level [blind](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).
---
You would bring along a  hunter normally, just give them the nightfall as well and have the enhance shaman go resto. You get all the utility, and you save a dps spot for a good dps class
---
Right in the article you quoted.
---
 Asscandy as we called it
---
Warlocks are amazing
---
Mages are amazing
---
You should go Gnome Warlock, if you go Warlock. Undead Warlock are great. Troll Mages a great also. For Alliance Mages, Human are good.
---
Enjoy and we welcome you, in advance, to the old Azeroth.
---
But then what do we do after level 41?! It's a neverending cycle.
---
Yeah... Because that's totally not what every single damn hunter in my guild ever said on every single 2 weapons that dropped.
---
I remember some hunter named some variation of "elf" I can't remember who would say it AT LEAST twice a night on every raid. I remember my guild leader being both amused and annoyed by him after a while.
---
Ohh so they may not actually come out?
---
To be fair, the cats launch event did let people become raving doomsayers
---
Yes it was mostly a pserver thing because of wrong parry haste. But they existed back then (plenty).
---
Regardless of non dw fury not generating enough threat back then and for offtanking my server always preffered a druid because it meant less damage stops for tank swaps (because horde, not having fear ward)
---
No way dude! The boomkins will be super cool and chad and the warriors and priests will be all lame and virgin. :D
---
Of course you being a nazi, you feel that way
---
Undead are just Humans that have been upgraded.
---
Swimming down the coast of Wetlands towards Dun Morogh, then drowning and rezing at the Spirit Healer in Kharanos.
---
Interrupts on R for sure.. but I keep my gap closer on W
---
Some people do, some people don’t. I just hope they offer both options if/when we get to that point. Like a server that is frozen in time and another one for further progression.
---
no wtf are u insane? you hit 43, then 57 and then 34
---
Pretty unrealistic to have so much player interaction in BfA though
---
... What do you mean? That's where the fun begins.
---
I'd imagine you stop at 40 for a few, or all, of these reasons:
---
- Can't afford a mount and are tired of running around
---
- Get burned out of your class and want to try something else
---
- Can't find quests/new zones to level through
---
I'd say the biggest hurdles to jump through in WoW are level 20 and level 40. Level 40 is in the middle of the slowest leveling period in WoW, IMO. I personally always struggle finding quests from 35-45, because there are so many zones that offer few quests, and oftentimes, require you to jump from zone to zone to finish them.
---
My advice is to just keep pushing through. Follow chains a bit further than you usually would so you can get as much quest XP as you can. Make sure you're doing all dungeons/dungeon quests. Grind, if you have to. Grinding at 40-ish if you're running low on quests is actually smart, since you probably need gold for your mount anyways. 
---
Also, perhaps you could try following a leveling guide, if you're nervous about quest drought. Really, you just need to push through. The dungeons alone past 40 are worth it, and I think that's when the game really starts to feel different. Every class really comes into their own once they can spec all the way into a tree. 
---
There's a perspective that endgame begins at 60, which I think is a bit reductionist. To me, endgame starts at 55, or even 50. Those are the levels when you start picking up your pre-BiS gear, cap your professions, grind gold, and spec into your non-leveling spec. 
---
Just keep pushing through, and think through some things. Good luck to you
---
Oh god I'm going to have to get out of bed to review my build before going to sleep all over again.
---
I will be partying up with a group of friends, item drop quests will suck but kill X quests should be quicker. I played on Khronos 1 when it first launched and it was packkkked, I think it took me like 2 hours hit hit level 4 just from fighting over mob tags. 
---
Really wish they put that feature in from wotlk to share tags but what can you do.
---
Zeppelin or not TB is still the best.
---
Lol why would not everyone just need :(
---
as you post a few times today......
---
Gnome is best for both mage and worlock
---
PHahahah, sorry man. I... I didn't have another choice..!
---
it’s my turn to post this tomorrow
---
No they don't
---
Enjoy the world. Its not a rush to 60. Make friends and community.
---
Thanks man, means a lot :D
---
Or you know... you could actually try to test and find bugs.
---
Sounds like you made up your mind in your post, they both bring something unique, mage gets free food and portals and locks stones and summon
---
&gt; Who could have possibly predicted this? 
---
Anyone with 2 working neurons.
---
I think that might splitt the community too much (especially since I think they will release TBC or Wotk).
---
I actually wouldnt mind more questlines that are just about skill/lore that will not introduce more items.
---
The tournaments people had in vanilla, the ones they have had on private servers and the one they had on the beta. Do you want me to compile a list of times they didn't win?
---
One thing to consider if you are a casual player is that a raiding guild may expect you to farm soul shards before a raid, which can just be a time sink
---
Sounds like you should roll warlock. 
---

---
[Helpful class-picking resources here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/index#wiki_archives.3A)
---
Warlock brings a lot of utility which mages lack, like summoning and health stones. I wouldn't worry about competing with mages for raid slots, because raids will need both. 
---
It sounds like you want to play warlock, so go for it! At the end of the day, you should be playing what you enjoy :)
---
I just tell them to google their question instead, it promotes research skills for the workplace and school. Imagine that!
---
§ mount bros ww@
---
Yeah I’d totally be interested! Was thinking about rolling Alliance and will be on NA!
---
Layering is like this: Say you have 5,000 players roll on a server. Well, this server actually has "layered sub-servers" within it, and would assign, say, the first 2,500 to log in to sub server 1, and the second 2,500 to sub server 2. Now, these 2 subservers are *actually* still one server, but almost like a split phase. Everyone can still chat in general, everyone is still online, they are just in phase 2. Grouping brings them over. Now, the difference between phasing and layering, once logged into a layer, you stay on that layer until log out, so you don't phase randomly.
---
Eventually layers will be merged into a zero-phase-esque situation in which everyone is on the same layer (or single server with no sub servers). Layering will be completely phased out, according to Blizzard, either during Phase 1 or Phase 2 of the Classic release schedule. It's only to help with exactly your concerns.
---
TL;DR: Layering is phasing but less ridiculous and is per server, not shared amongst servers. It will be gone "shortly" after release. There to help with exactly what you voiced as a concern.
---
Oh sorry I didn’t even know that was a thing.
---
Even with layering there will be a lot to deal with playing at launch. Picking the right server, dealing with over and under population, auction house prices will be crazy. Ill be waiting as long as I can manage before joining in. At least two weeks.
---
why not both?
---
1 week for launch, other week 1 year later lol
---
The most experienced players can hit 40 in under 40 hours. The record on Live servers is 37 hours and 51 minutes, but we're almost certainly going to see that broken on launch.
---
Opt into the world of Warcraft beta and opt in to the world of Warcraft classic beta. That’s it.
---
Hopefully Blizzard will allow us to use store mounts in Classic.
---
Probably not the answer you were expecting, but, Arathi Basin.
---
both are solid choices
---
How do you open the console? :/
---
But then you’re changing what some people would like to not change. 
---
If anything I’d prefer a split timeline with new content that isn’t the tbc/wrath progression. 
---
Also what do you mean by skill? Are you talking abilities or qlines that require skill to do?
---
imo they should report anything they think might be wrong. Better blizz gets too many reports and has to filter out duplicates/non issues than they get too few and miss real issues for launch
---
As an upocimg Ret Paladin main and Enhancement Shaman alt I say YES, thank you.
---
Can you please do something about the endless spam of 10 second twitch clips and YouTube montages that are just using this sub as an advertisement platform?
---
I dont think you know what exponentially means
---
That isn't the list of requirements, they list them below and it includes a sub
---
Escort quests will be a breeze! 
---
Exploring areas at a lower level will be a breeze too!
---
Maybe take a few alts to the places you want them permanently
---
i picked human lock because a friend was playing alliance...... if i had known that 40% of the enemy faction on a pvp server would be immune to my classes only cc i would have never made the choice (death coil was added a long time after launch)
---
never again
---
I couldn't help but read this in the Goblin voice
---
That first week will be hell for the reasons I wrote above. Unless you’re racing for world first or you have the demeanour of a Buddhist monk, you won’t have a good time.
---
Is that you TIPS?
---
oh duh, I'm a dumb dumb
---
Thank you. My main concern with warlock is lower damage compared to mages.
---
Aspect ratio of that print is beautiful.
---
It is though. Mage and rogue might pull past you, but a good warrior player can be top
---
This sub is low iq.
---
The games easy. Bring as many hybrids as you want
---
I think remeber his guild was xD I think. He went to rank 1 in 2v2 braket with a priest called fatherly i think and people were like naw 2v2 dont matter so no competition.
---
I think a blizzcon level pvper was on Azjol in vanilla and xrealmed off when arenas came out but I cant remeber the name
---
Awesome! Just put a reminder to reach out closer to launch so we can make sure you get on the same server.  Take care!
---
That naturally occurs while playing the game. How is leveling an alt or farming gear preventing people from beta testing? Makes no sense.
---
Will do!
---
His name wasn't a derivative of Legolas or Drizzit?
---
Are there still people who play without them these days?
---
yeah I always say roll need on gems recipes boes etc because everyone needs gold and it prevents ninjaing
---
The sub is only to play if you get invited.
---
I bought ESO elswyer, then got a beta invite. I may as well have just flushed that money down the toilet.
---
Dude you are my spirit animal 😂 I thought I was the only one!
---
Well you won't be vulnerable in WPvP because you have your bubble and healing but it will be hard to catch anything because of your inexistent mobility. Engineering is mandatory for that, and even then it's hard and needs to be learned. Watch Savix's Vanilla Ret Paladin PvP video for example.
---
ele/resto shaman build would fit this criteria quite well. One spec and you can literally heal dungeons, raids, as well as PVP while also being able to 1 shot burst people in PVP with the same spec
---
Because of AP normalization and arms warrior talents its one of the two best dps weapons in the game with Dark Edge of Insanity.  MoM is great damage but the mace spec is garbage in vanilla.  If you're a human, Ashbringer was bis, if you were an orc Dark Edge was bis.  If you do the math on white hits alone they are both within 2 dps of MoM and only fall behind yellow attacks but make up for it with the specialization talents.
---
I hope you don't blame me for this but I'm going to go off of what blizzard says over you
---
Can't tell if you're serious or trolling lol
---
This is brilliant. Can't wait for the Stranglethorn chaos in classic.
---
That’s honestly a good idea but I don’t want to burn myself out before classic starts
---
Yeah oh wow, that looks so jarring when you actually think about it. Really glad they fixed that!
---
POG!!!!
---
No use arguing pretty clear from reading the [FAQ](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/breaking/22988589) only an opt-in is required. Also clear the reading comprehension is really poor.
---
What was it before?
---
well I have the first week off in September, because I needed to use it up so why not, I know it will be slow going but still going to have fun doing it, the whole reason Im playing to begin with is no mmo is a mmo anymore, just seeing 1 other person will be nice, seeing 200 will be amazing!
---
Cool. I'm going mage. Any tips for me?
---
While impressive no matter how you feel about it you are mistaken if you think this subreddit will specifically celebrate that lol
---
I've been dual or triple monitor on every home and work PC since '00 maybe. For sure the PC I built for college in '02 has dual 19's. I recall because they were HUGE and HEAVY to lug into the dorms. Most people rocked laptops, my setup was P.I.M.P. If I can dig out an old photo I will, but didnt have a smart phone back then. Still think I had a digital photo or two.
---
I think the difference between "a buncha friends jus havin funz" and "40 man hardcore" is gonna be a little more than 30 minutes in a raid.
---
Not saying you're not allowed to for-funsies it, but I think you might be under the impression that the floor and ceiling between those 2 things is closer than it is.
---
Ha ha ha
---
Durotan??? 
---
Anybody??? 
---
Guess not.
---
Also doesnt understand marketing. These streamers are marketing to the players that started after BC.
---
Lol wait till your quest rewards are whites.
---
I'm in the Beta, what people are playing is not going to be representative of Classic release.  I've been leveling every class up for example.
---
Shit! THis is how I grind to 60 while losing weight!
---
I'm playing Alliance this time around, and the only thing I'm going to miss is having a good race for Mages and Warlocks; Human and Gnome casting animations are so bad.
---
I've been doing the 2 credit for $25/month since 2013. So got them for $12 each. It's the only way to go. I still read books too, own over 1000 paper and ebooks.
---
Such a pure screenshot
---
Gnomewhere
---
I think their current plan is to just focus on classic.  then from there they will probably just roll out new servers once the old servers run their course.    If TBC is super popular among the players they will probably work on TBC
---
Paladin Pros:
---
+ Highly desirable raid and pvp healer, excellent warrior pocket heal
---
+ Free 40 mount &amp; cheaper legendary mount
---
+ Plate armor, 5 health bars.
---
+ Bubble hearth
---
- Tedious raid blessings
---
- Ret is a meme
---
- Slow solo leveling
---
- Susceptible to Purge spam, Viper Sting spam
---
- Immobile
---
Hunter Pros:
---
- Very fast leveling, high independence, low gear dependence
---
- Can solo elite content — fast farmers
---
- Powerful world PvP
---
- Mobile
---
- Ammo bag
---
- Dead zone
---
- Ultra-late-game fall-off
---
- Minimal raid slots
---
- Arguably weak against warlocks and shadow priests
---
Yeah I see a lot of them when I'm on.
---
That’s fair, I hope it is smooth for all our sake. I played through the opening of a certain pserver that had 6k+ on alliance side when it opened and it was a struggle so I’m definitely jaded.
---
Ok I am starting to think these influencers have unleashed a plague upon us.
---
Hi definitely jaded., I'm dad.
---
What does a Ret pally or a Boomkin offer to the group while OOM that a more optimally spec'd pally/druid offer?
---
Enjoy it, be nice to people, don’t get infected by the toxic guys.
---
How was retri PLD in Vanilla? looks awesome by the way.
---
Improved windfury totem is not even that great (like a 2dps increase) and it's really far down the tree to warrant investing that many points. If your guild allows you to raid as enhance, by all means get it but if deep resto, I'd just skip it.
---
Yeah, I would understand their frustration if they just earned a viewer base for retail and now the hordes are migrating to classic, no pun intended. If you’ve ever heard of PWNcast they fall into the same group. Except their podcast is steaming hot trash since they
---
&gt; Want a compelling game? Go play ESO, or WoW, or FF14, or X. Classic is a 15 year old game and it shows. 
---
ESo, FFXIV and retail WoW are ALL THE SAME : a putrid shit, ridden with MTX, and zero immersion, in a shiny package designed for the low IQ kids.
---
This is WHY the MMORPG genre is dying, the design is flawed in it's core.
---
Blizzard saw this, and they are re-releasing Classic.
---
Wait and see what will happen on Classic launch day and the reactions from the media (not only gaming media).
---
They will be as puzzled as BBC was when Brexit vote took place and like CNN was when Trump won.
---
They will NOT UNDERSTAND how an old game will be the MOST popular MMORPG launch in history, by a long shot.
---
Well said!
---
What is the macro?
---
19,999
---
Do patches on live take 2-3 years to develop?
---
Huh? Death Coil was a spell at launch. The first patch that adjusted the spell was 1.2 which went live like a month after launch.
---
Who the fck cares about this bald fraud.... hes an annoying entitled guy that whine all days about not having any safe space...
---
Did it? I don't remember that, but it's been a while. I do remember the Cata launch being insanely fun for RP with the people playing doomsayers and the elements attacking the city.
---
And you can bring them off-site, so you have stores of your date elsewhere in case your facility were to be destroyed.
---
I only use alt for lower ranks of spells and things of that nature. Ctrl is generally my PtT key.
---
What's your point?
---
happy to help. pm me on reddit anytime if you want any lock/mage advice for both pve and pvp
---
Same dude. We shall die in glory... and shattered gear.
---
I miss a lot of those friends I made in WoW. Wonder if I can find any of them if I reinstall Xfire (if that’s even still a thing lol) 
---
My favorite WoW friendship was made when my online friend and I were going through Hillsbrad Foothills and ran into a duo of Horde players. They ganked me at first (lower level hunter, I was an easy target lol) and it quickly turned into a back and forth of messing around and emoting. My friend made a quick horde alt (yes yes, PvE I know) and messaged one of the Horde players with our Vent info. 
---
Pretty soon we were chatting with this incredibly nice and funny married couple, who decided to roll up new alliance characters and play with us! They even made the jump to a new server with us when the time came.
---
Yea, thats why I reinforce my thighs etc, and lower back and so forth. I dont want to have these problems later on. Thats all. I already have a knew problem which doesnt allow me to kneel easily without it hurting a  little, but i was born with that. So currently im training my thigh muscles to help that
---
Hahaha it’s funny because hunter can find benefits in almost EVERY weapon. It’s just when those weapons are actually worth it to the hunter over a warrior or rogue. It’s usually circumstantial. Safe to say Thunderfury is definitely a hunter weapon.
---
We are being trolled at this point, right?
---
Spoiler alert, but playing the game as it's intended to be played is the best way to discover unexpected bugs. I like where your heads at though.
---
I’m literally tell you what it says in the article. Which is what blizzard said.
---
Orc warlock or gnome warlock.
---
All other races are inferior.
---
I want to main tank, but the guild Im rolling with, the GM is the main tank. Am sad. Its all I want to do, really.
---
Hi, /u/michixlol
---
This reminds me of when I blew all my DKP on Twinblade of the Phoenix from Kael'thas in BC.  
---
I couldn't understand why the Ret Pallys and Dps Warriors refused to speak to me after that.
---
Im new too, joined a private server 3 weeks ago and made lots of mistakes, when classic comes hopefully the training makes me better.
---
Can't tell if serious.
---
what you referring to here?
---
Find a different guild? Sounds rough
---
Yes, I'd love this.i think they should focus on fleshing out the world rather than abandoning it like they do for each expansion. There's so much stuff they had planned for vanilla that they never got a chance to implement until now.
---
Definitely the illegal danish series. It's one of my favorite wow videos to this day. 
---
https://youtu.be/FUsF8weJJWs
---
I'm not sure what kind of answer you're expecting. 
---
yes, you can deviate from the spec but you will be less effective.. hence why they're called the most effective specs.
---
If you don't go for SM or DS you lose 10% or 15% of your dps. If you don't go for ruin, you might as well go afk.
---
ye
---
No you aren't, you are telling me your odd reading of a sentence that blizzard put out. Instead I think I'll just go by the information blizzard have put out, which is that you need both X and Y to do Z
---
I don’t know about that. People have been playing on pservers for 14 years without any expansions.
---
If feels kinda selfish though, they're good people and I would love to be involved
---
Always watched the Screensavers with Leo and Pat.
---
Or is actually ninjaing
---
Thanks for being the only one to provide any real information.
---
I mean, is this even a serious question? What makes a class competitive is how they fare compared to other classes in the same role...
---
/facepalm
---
Karthak. My brother was Ilthel, definitely more likely you knew him than me since he raided in Maelstrom and Onslaught before that.
---
Pouring one out for your mom's ink cartridge.
---
Maybe just go a whole different route / class. You can still fill fulfilled in a different role.
---
Otherwise just focus your tanking on Dungeons / UBRS, and offtank when needed in Raids.
---
“In order to be invited to participate in the WoW Classic Beta or the initial WoW Classic Stress Test you must have opted-in. You must have active game time (either a recurring subscription or non-recurring game time) to participate in any WoW Classic test”
---
Oh wow I never knew there was a 2 credit option. I’ve been on the 1/$15 and enjoying it but I run out really fast. I’ll look into this. I read a lot on my kindle while flying but love audio books for my commute.
---
are you me? Just play on Pserver ;)
---
I think a lot of it has to do with the games themselves. So few games really require or emphasize player communication in a meaningful way.
---
For all its faults, the Friday the 13 game made excellent use of player voice communication and it was like a whole new world. I’ve never made so many friends on PS4 in any other game, but on F13 I was always chatting with random players and having a great time.
---
Both are equally needed.
---
Shut the fuck up
---
You don't need hundreds, you need one per boss, maybe two if you're on progression content
---
300-400 days /played I would guess.  Maybe 500.

Leveling farm.
---
I got a few more on my channel just check it out :)
---
56 linen, tailor and enchanting you can make your first wand.  I had it by level 7 on beta, just kill extra humanoids at quest areas.
---
Terrible is relative.
---
Its actually the best Enh shaman weapon in the 39, 40, and 49 bracket. Hitting a Windfury with this thing is lights out for basically anything
---
Moonkin aura. I never mentioned Paladin so no idea why you bring them in.
---
Everyone ruined their videos with terrible music in those days.
---
Don't listen to all the elitist tryhards here. Take your time to learn the game, don't be afraid to ask a question, and just enjoy leveling.
---
ooh look at this orc... I will play an orc!
---
no! no! Look at this Humans, I will play Human!
---
Oh sh!t. Looks at this Nightelves... fuuuuuuuck
---
I love how vehemently you opened the book and start turning the pages.
---
“Look at THIS cool shit!
---
And THIS cool shit!”
---
Name checks out.
---
Have they confirmed the amount of layers per server? Sounds like they'll still need like a shit load of layers to make it work.
---
This is the wrong place to celebrate that, it's full of boomers who hate streamers for having an opportunity they didn't.
---
I came here for this salty comment.
---
He’s playing a character if you weren’t aware,
---
Thanks, to be honest I don't really remember much about retri I was a little kid after all :)
---
They say that to participate you need to opt in.
---
Then they say that to participate you need a subscription.
---
And you read this as you don't need a subscription to participate.
---
Interesting interpretation there my man
---
This is hogshit.  You either are remembering incorrectly or literally had the luckiest string of drops of any player in the history of the game.
---
I ruined my teenage years playing about 12+ hours a day of vanilla from the original beta through to TBC and across all of my characters I only ever saw one drop (Brainhacker off winterspring furbolgs).  I was in a large guild and had an active friendlist and I rarely heard of anyone finding a BoE epic, it was a rare instance.
---
I would love it if people on this sub would fucking stop with this topic.
---
Only choice is to play them all...
---
Ninjaing would be rolling need on things when you were expected to roll greed so the item goes to you instead of other people. If everybody rolls need, it's not possible for somebody to do a higher priority roll.
---
Holy crap I was just thinking of this video, so good
---
Thank you for the advice,I was just wondering if ruin was truly that important
---
Are you seriously trying to use this satirical video as evidence to back up your statements? Have you become a parody of your own ignorance? Be gone troll.
---
You're*.
---
I feel better.
---
Dmaw Alliance represent!
---
30-40 in general is awful for alliance. There are barely any quests compared to what horde have, and the dungeons are far away in horde territory. You could do gnomer for a bit, but so can horde since they can just teleport to the instance.
---
WHAT IS THAT!? WHAT IS THATTT!?
---
This is the main reason I want to play classic. I loved that experience so much. These days in retail you get kicked for any little mistake and it’s a constant rush with no talking.
---
Just thought I'd share. Like him or hate him, he's been a big part of classic's exposure.
---
To participate means to do actual be involved in it.  Just opting in doesn’t make you a participant.

---
meta streamer content does not belong here
---
I think people who assume every guild is going to even have the ability to recruit 15+ Priests is kinda being silly.
---
The content isn't like retail WoW. You're much more rewarded for your effort, and a geared/commited Druid can compete with a Priest, while covering either tanking or dps gaps.
---
People aren't going to choose to go to a raid with 35 people when there's 5 willing Druids sitting idle in guild.
---
Some of the super hardcore groups are sure to min/max like that, but I won't be trying to join those guilds.
---
I started in Vanilla but never really raided and I have played every expansion at their release since then for at least a couple months. Over the years I've gotten an alt of every class to at least level 90. I was a hunter for the majority and In Legion I mained Rogue and in BFA I have mained a blood DK. Blood DK is by far my favorite class, as I love to tank but that isn't an option really. 
---
I'm really open to any class but it just feels like there is nothing that will be as fun as Blood DK has been to me. I'm the type of player who enjoys PvP and want to be semi competitive with that. I love AOE and I love tanking huge groups of mobs. I also enjoyed not having mana to worry about. I also am preferential to DOT  than to like a burst then wait type play style. 
---
My initial thoughts were to main a warrior because they are the best tank, its by far my least most played class so I have very little understanding to how warriors work internally, which would be fun to learn too. The thing is that my favorite parts of Blood DK was being able to pull a ton of mobs and AOE tank and heal myself. Warrior really does none of that, so I'm not sure that I would have fun. I also tried to level one on a private server and the first 10 levels have been super slow and boring, literally just heroic strike and auto attack a bunch and wait because there is never any rage. 
---
Other option is to just play rogue, one of my other favorite classes. I've always been one of the more 'hardcore' members of my friend group so I do well at maximizing my DPS and have experience raiding with rogue. Literally my only concern is that everyone will be playing rogue and it will be tough to get groups and gear. 
---
I thought about mage too just because of the AOE aspect, and good PVP viability but i'm not sure.
---
Poor kid didn't know about key binds back then.
---
Hey, do you have an example of this on Classic Wowhead? I've been comparing values recently on some quests after the Wowhead Client was working, and they seemed more accurate after the addon update.
---
They have mentioned that Layering is on a "per-server basis". So if a TON of people roll on one server, there will be more layers. What I do not know, is whether or not they have stated how many players they will place in a layer, like if the layers have a cap or not.
---
Best piece of advice for rolling on the new servers? Group up with people! It's going to be chaotic and it's going to be amazing. Enjoy the struggle :)
---
Pretty sure Taurajo was added later and not in at launch
---
Well, to be fair, if they went to TBC/WotLK, they would also probably use their latest, most polished state. Similar to how Classic is based on 1.12 and not 1.0
---
Haha thanks. That is sort of what I did. And I didnt even show all pages ;-)
---
I'm pretty sure it's the god awful CSS theme. It's packed full of high-res images and terribly optimized. Even if you hide it, your browser is still loading it.
---
This is how we got into the mess we're in now.  Quit trying to re-ruin World of Warcraft.
---
ive never seen this topic before
---
Not even remotely. The streamers not only spent weeks getting bis level 30 gear and enchants, they also have expensive engineering consumables that we will not have a plethora of.
---
Yea, there are definitely exceptions. But like you said, the weapons seem to scale harder, benefitting melee.
---
Although that seems unlikely, it's an interesting thought.  Imagine if such a thing existed and was somehow tied to layers.
---
They will be the second needed class in numbers for raids, just bellow or equal to Warriors.
---
Happy to see so many Shamans:)
---
Hopefully they understand that they will all be Resto for raiding in Classic.
---
Did you make this video? The classic pvp half of the video reminds me so much of old school machinimas. It was really well done!
---
What happened to the staff? You sold it?
---
Its free real estate
---
No alts? Impressive!
---
Ay as long as I have bloodseeker we good. If not, that’s not fair because the world should revolve around ME
---
People should be worried about player retention two years from now, not what Blizzard is going to do with the game.
---
This is kind of a pointless argument since you just keep interpreting this however you want to
---

---
4 minutes from Brewnall Village to Menethil Docks.
---
This seems like way too much time.  You could reasonably do near all the achievements on retail in less time.  2000hrs is probably a more realistic estimate with pretty chill play.  If you try harded it i could see it being done easily in 1000
---
Form your raids! Form your raids!
---
Sons of Anduin, of bitches, my PVPers,
---
I see in your eyes a Warlock's fear that would make me flee.
---
A day may come when your CC break fails,
---
when we forsake the obvious stealthed rogue
---
and break all bonds of shit-talking Horde in chat,
---
but it is not this day.
---
An hour of wolf mounts and High Warlords,
---
when a wave of "KEK" comes crashing down,
---
but it is not this day!
---
This day we gank!
---
By all supplies you hold dear in this good BG,
---
I bid you stand, Men, elves, dwarves ~~and gnomes~~ of the Alliance!!!
---
Collect every mount is gonna be pretty tough considering they'll only be a few Scarab Lords on your server.
---
There's the pig polymorph quest I believe.
---
FF14
---
IMO, it does what retail WoW does but better. If you're into heavily instanced/group-based MMO content, FF is a great game. The class design is leagues ahead of BfA. Doesn't really scratch the adventure-y itch of Vanilla WoW though.
---
Naxx will be insane. Exorcism, Strat holy water scaling with spell power.
---
Bananas.
---
wrong sub
---
Only for 20/40-man raids. Not for dungeons, not even 10-man dungeons like UBRS.
---
If you don't pick up Ruin you go from 200% damage crits on your damage spell to 150% damage crits.  
---
If you don't get shadow mastery or demonic sacrifice you lose 10/15% damage off of everything.  
---
I would expect a 10-20% damage loss depending on your crit rate considering you're likely looking at getting either SM or DS with your specs..
---
That's the real reason she left him.  His meme is just the fantasy he conjured up to convince himself otherwise.
---
He's not skilled because he's not sure if there will be a glut of shamans horde side?
---
Honestly I could out dps folks on my ele shaman back in the day, just had to down rank to no go oom.  Also, was not hard when most people were a bunch of clicker idiots.
---
Hahah glad you like it :D And yes, the video is made by me
---
Ok, I shouldn't have hesitated about having photos :). I'm way too organized to lose photos.

Blasted lands had a set of quests like that too (at least in TBC, not sure what the status was for that in vanilla as I didn't play then).
---
That is false. Just go try it on the Beta. If any of your dots get the final blow then you *do not* get the buff.
---
Stick to topics you actually know something about instead of reading some bullshit on private server forums and then pretending that you know.
---
It will be stable at the end of Phase 1.
---
Why? Because most guilds already set up their roster for BWL, and those who will PvP will already have their goals set.
---
7-8 months is waaaaaaaay to long.
---
You just don’t understand what participant means.  Go look up the post of people who got invited that weren’t subbed on here and also tell them they are wrong.  And also tell the other people that commented and said your wrong.
---
Spreadsheeting a ton. Few people on discord with beta access are testing out what the levels allow. Ravager testing soon. Dragonbreath Chili soon. Fiery Blaze enchant soon.
---
SM RUIN can pretty much be used for all content in the game and excel at it pretty well.
---
how can people justify playing these specs. you guys love gnomer that much?
---
Exactly the kind of answer i was looking for. Thank you!

Honestly as popular as he seems I thought he had alot more than that. Either way this dosnt concern WoW in anyway. But while we are on meaningless topics that dont include WoW NF came out with a fuckin awesome song this past week called The Search. For any of those who are in to rap.
---
For me, keybinds only make sense when comparing to your hand. In other words, when I do keybinds I ask myself "can I actually reach this button in the middle of combat without moving my hand?"
---
My final result is that I break two bars down into halves, and use others for mostly non-combat things.
---
**Bar 1:** 
---
* keys 1 to 5 (primary rotation)
---
* keys alt+1 to alt+5 (support skills &amp; pots)
---
**Bar 2:**
---
* keys ctrl+1 to ctrl+5 (finishers or aoe)
---
* keys shift+1 to shift+5 (utility skills like sprint, interrupt, etc.)
---
**Specials like stances, stealth, etc.**
---
* \` (button next to 1), ctrl+\`, shift+\`, alt+\`
---
**Misc. Utility &amp; Mounts**
---
* Num 0 (usually my mount), Num 1 - Num 3 (short-medium duration buffs), etc.
---
* Rebind auto-run from numlock to \*
---
Rest of the bars for things like food and professions.
---
Hahahaha! You poor soul, at least I knew what I was getting into! I didn't move to Moon Guard until early Cata. Was it like that in vanilla too?
---
Honestly, I have more fond memories of the server than anything. There was a lot of quality walk up RP to be had there! There was a lot of smut too, but it was mostly isolated to Goldshire. Personally, I found the public RP descriptions on that crowd pretty damn funny.
---
I only recall a few instances of it. Would have to find the exact quest when I get home. Also possible since wowhead is updated frequently that they aren’t really off anymore with beta being played and all that.
---
My shit was blue paste for 2 weeks, because of these.
---
YES! This is what got me to pick up wow. I went straight for that fucking chicken man, I wanted it so bad.
---
If they do anything, they need to have the different expansions of the game on different servers and allow the player to step through the game how they want.
---
&gt; 5) there is no spillover rep gain

That is true for all starter zone quests except for Tumors (not sure why) and the three low level Stormwind City “fedex” quests. However, once you start getting into the level 11+ quests in Westfall, Loch Modan and Darkshore, some, but not all of those quests begin giving 25% spillover rep.
---
&gt; At least that way we don’t have to guess at which quests will give rep for the faction we want.
---
No guessing is required. I have recorded all rep values (including spillover rep values) for every single Alliance quest in the Beta up through level 17 quests and I’m still actively tracking that information as I go. Now if they stealth nerf/buff those values in another patch (like they did in the WSG patch), I may have to start over again.
---
Sent that dude a personal invite obviously.
---
You definitely want to be grouped. For duo leveling class choice some classes will complement each other better but if either of you really wants a certain class play that and don't worry as much about the comp. (If you're between multiple classes or undecided you may find this video helpful for class comp suggestions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4 )

Speaking of BRD, I ran that dungeon one time back in MoP and had the absolute best time ever!  We queued in for Lower BRD and our tank got lost after the first two bosses.  Rather than correcting him, we just tagged along as he traveled all the way up through all the bosses and most of the trash in the dungeon (except for the like 3 bosses we were "supposed" to do in the basement).  It wasn't until we had killed the final boss of BRD that we told the tank he actually forgot to do the three bosses back at the entrance so we went and did those and half our group left.  It was just me as the healer and a hunter who decided we wanted to finish off the last two quests in the zone so we explored for another hour or so, only giving up when we found out that some of the quest items vanished when you zoned out (we would warp out and in to teleport to the beginning).  And thus, after around 2-3 hours of the best dungeon run I've ever done, we parted ways and logged off for the night.  I can't wait to do this dungeon again on classic so we can explore everything it has to offer again!
---
And that retribution stigma I bet will totally carry over to classic. Or maybe i'm being pessimistic
---
Lol calm down. Go take a walk.
---
His name is roastie hate, take a guess
---
BIG TRUE
---
I've used a private server to try and help me figure out what to play.  Haven't spent a ton of time.  Nothing passed level 6 I dont think.  I still cant decide.
---
Well if it takes around 2 years to clear nax(I know the content is locked and if you forced it maybe you could do it faster but still) I would say 3-4years of irl time.
---
I'm starting to think this is the only appropriate reply to these threads.
---
I'll take the 3rd slot for Monday
---
Same here..
---
I hope so.
---
Raids will want 8 shamans...so, the more Shamans, the better. They don't NEED 8 Shamans, but it's what they will WANT.
---
I really love tanking but I'm not sure if I will have enough time to be a guild's dedicated MT. How many spots are their in raids for warrior dps players willing to offtank and collect two sets of gear? Any info is much appreciated.
---

The way I look at it grinding mobs in vanilla was actually a main part of the gameplay, mobs were harder to kill, you had to stop eat and drink.  Im always someone that looks to be the most efficient in something so I found it challenging and enjoying to be as efficient as I can, learning the best paths/routes, min maxing my usage of eating drinking.  It also provided a lot more in terms of what you required. Money items, mats.  Now you just show up for some camps decimate everything in 2 seconds.  Its no longer a really useful thing to do.
---
Mages can ice barrier all they want it’s going to be no good when their don’t have the mana or damage to deal with the mana drain kiting a hunter will do
---
Ah, okay. Thanks for all the info!
---
Rank 14. It won't happen because I don't have time these days and classic ranks are more about time invested than skill.
---
On the one hand, we don't know.
---
On the other hand, it's been asked about 50 million times on this subreddit.  They don't know either.
---
There’s a grandma who streams skyrim. No one missed any opportunities
---
You think you want classic but you don’t. 
---
OSRS was popular because people wanted the old game with new content. 
---
Classic is popular because people want the old game with old content. 
---
Turning classic into retail isn’t the solution.
---
214,748 gold 36 silver and 47 copper
---
That and a week one rag kill are the only goals I've set for myself.
---
Shadow oil scales 56% with spell power. 15% chance on hit, with a 1 second weapon = a 200+ damage shadow bolt every 6 seconds. If SoR ends up proccing it too, every 3-4 seconds.
---
Much better than a +8 damage or 2% crit stone
---
I think it's too early to start discussing stuff like this but I think in a few years this will hopefully be the way the game goes.
---
Eviscerate has static damlaget, no?

wait so am i reading this right.... Alt +f4 will bring up your cooking menu.... um......
---
tbf stress test basically shows us nothing in terms of how actual launch will go
---
Sorry, didn’t mean to make it sound like you were wrong in any way. Just wanted to add a disclaimer for anyone looking at the spread that it might be skewed compared to live stats.
---
I want to be the MT and clear all the way through Naxxramas. I don't need to be the first or the best, as long as I get to clear it while it's current content, I'll be thrilled!
---
I'd love to get the Scarab Lord title too, but that one might be unachievable.
---
Ninjaing, is a "social construct", based on the "social contract" that Need rolls are for those whom the drop is a needed upgrade, or the BoE recipe is one that you actually can learn for your profession. 
---
You are saying, that every one needs every thing, because everyone needs gold. In your version, litterally every drop should be rolled need on. Because regardless if you as a priest cannot use that Ironfoe, you use the 5 g it vendors for. 
---
Every one in the group would freak the fuck out at you. I would add you to the realms Ninja looting black list,
---
Assmonface pisses me off. Like a shitton
---
That's been the case since... forever. 
---
Only like 1% of the population (or less) want to do these things. 
---
That is why it is always much more difficult to find them for PUGs or Raids. 
---
Even with dungeon finder in retail, you get 3 dps instantly and wait for tank &amp; heals.
---
With a friend is always good

Bonechewer, famous for trains of horde heading to Zg, and pulling a pit stop on my level 40 alliance rogue.
---
looks like everyone is main tank. best of luck
---
It was the longest journey to hit 60 and had lots to do after that. I made tons of alts after tbc and other expansions but hitting that max level never felt this good.
---
It is yes if you have the spot available, but that's easier said than done.
---
Ahem... OWLchemy
---
The difficulty, if we even want to call it that, came from knowing how to weave.  Weapon upgrades weren't straightforward for Hunters like with most classes.  The speed of your weapon determined how your rotation played out.
---
I guess a better phrasing would have been Hunters required more homework.  Once you figured out how you were to play it was pretty straightforward.  
---
Though... with watching shot timers, CDs, and controlling your pet you still had far more to do than the majority of other dps classes.  All of that and if you did it perfectly you still were just middle of the pack dps.  :-/
---
I want to lead a gaggle of 39 tipsy to drunk adults into the depths of Molten Core, and the the peaks of Black Wing Lair, one or two nights a week so we can escape our soul sucking significant others and our high stress careers.  Nothing in Classic sounds better than drunk banter and raiding on the weekend, for those few hours of reprieve from responsibility.
---
Proportions are a little off.
---
Most people don’t get emotionally invested in private servers because at any moment (especially with wow) they could be shut down and all progress will be lost. I played on like 3-5 different OSRS private servers way back before actually OSRS released and never got nearly as sucked in as I did when I eventually started playing jagex official OSRS
---
He smashes Soy before each video. It helps with his retarded soy smile.
---
Depends on what kind of person you are.
---
If you like single player story games then enjoy your time leveling and take it slow while exploring everything there is to explore.
---
If you're competitive and want to be the best binge watch a bunch of classic videos and prepair your self before the game comes out.
---
I would say definitely watch some "what class should I chose" videos if you don't know anything about wow. They would be helpful even if you don't want to try hard.
---
Unless you have some reason to rush to 60, you're going to enjoy playing with your friends more.
---
This is basically how I played older MMOs that only had grinding... get some friends to chat with or listen to music and get at it. It's almost like electronic meditation.
---
Are y'all for real? That's hard for me to grapple with.
---
'Always' being fairly relative since vanilla didn't have special boss buttons.
---
Being that we don't know when the phases are coming out, not sure how we can predict this. I agree that most high-end guilds will be setup by earlier then that, but I think that the vast majority will barely have started MC inside of 6 months. Don't confuse extremely dedicated players with average players. Most agree it takes 30 days to get to 60 or 720 hours. If casual players (which will make up the majority) play 4 hours a DAY (which is crazy), it will take 180 days played to get to level 60. Not geared, just 60. I think 7-8 months is actually conservative..
---
It all depends on how this layering thing works out. If there's tons of mobs available it could be a bit faster. If not, being in the same level range as your buddies could make it a lot easier to level. You will be able to do specific group quest for items etc. 
---
Honestly the thing that's going to slow you down most in group play is scheduling.
---
About questlines that require skill to do. Like the hunter weapons from MC or the green fire questline
---
Hell yes. I am good with the new Gfuel too but put out them in the classic bottles the whole nine yards and I'll be drinking them in a heartbeat. I'll even make sure to get the Alliance one even after I was spited last time (only place in my town that sold it only got the Alliance one cause the manager ordered it cause he was Alliance I was Horde at the time.)
---
Wow that really makes me want to play a shammy
---
Reading Word Up magazine
---
&gt; Blizzard already said they are open for more content in the future if the community wants it :)
---
Source?
---
I never set goals. I’ll play until I get bored like I always have.
---
Exactly. I played Dodian for a few years, but everyone knew it would get shutdown eventually like the rest of them.
---
i get ya :/ i wish my friends had the same mindset with me. i am gonna play with 3 irl buddies but i am certain i am gonna outlevel them pretty fast. we'll see how it goes
---
I don't think you're replying to the right comment.
---
Same here I made more friends and was part of some of my favourite guilds in Vanilla and even part of BC. Can't wait to play it for that reason.
---
That's certainly possible, but the lag only just started this week. Before then it always loaded up just fine. The only thing I can think that's changed or I've done differently is I dusted out my tower this past Tuesday, but I've done that before without any adverse effects and, again, it's not doing this anywhere except the Classic sub.
---
It's really driving me kinda' bonkers here. I need my fix, man!
---
With hunter it is very obvious if you know what you do because if you don’t you are utter garbage and if you do, especially in pvp, you will shine.
---
If your up for that I’d say go hunter. I certainly will.
---
Quoting this in a letter to my future GM. Solid theorycrafting ;)
---
Yeah I fucked up a lot especially at the hilt. I didn’t have a pencil available so I just went with it
---
&gt; I'm the type of player who enjoys PvP and want to be semi competitive with that. I love AOE and I love tanking huge groups of mobs. I also enjoyed not having mana to worry about. I also am preferential to DOT than to like a burst then wait type play style.
---
&gt;The thing is that my favorite parts of Blood DK was being able to pull a ton of mobs and AOE tank and heal myself.
---
It actually sounds like you'd prefer feral druid.
---
\&gt; I'm thinking at least 200 days played 
---
Definitely a wild approximation.  
---
\&gt;Exalted with all reputations
---
 You'd spend half that just getting Timbermaw Hold up to Exalted fighting mob tags with other groups doing the same, not to mention getting some of those Hated reps in STV from questing all the way back up.   
---
\&gt;Collect every mount
---
If RNG is in your favour than I can see getting some of the rare boss mount drops like the Baron's mount pretty good, but if RNG hates you......
---
The mount drop in Winterspring would definitely take a fair time since that one is farmed constantly, so mob fighting is prevalent.   
---
\&gt;BiS gear for all specs
---
In retail I'd say this would be simple to do, but again RNG could kick your ass and keep that hours/days played ticking upwards
---
\&gt;  Get High Warlord / Grand Marshal 
---
I've never PVP'd in Vanilla to have any idea what this would entail, but from what I hear, you'd best clone yourself to take over while you sleep
---
\&gt; Complete  every quest (including dungeon quests) 
---
This would be the easiest as most could be done while you level, leaving the rest of the grinds for max, but it would slow down your leveling process a bit if you go back to do grey quests in each zone, but this would help with Rep.
---
IMO, you're being fairly low in your estimation, granted this is basing it off a 5 hours played per day, but if you no life it to 18+ hours per day than maybe it could be closer to that number.
---
wow has no console?
---
These already kind of exist, Via Priest and Hunter from the quest items from Major Domo. As well as the shorter quest for Quel'sarr and Atiesh. Bonus point for Thunderfury and Hand if Rag, there more of a materials grind. But the one thing that all of these and warlock green fire have at the end of them. Is they actually felt rewarding when you completed them.
---
Other games have launched classic or progression servers before but WoW basically holds rockstar status in the genre. Sure, there are plenty of people that never liked WoW but it became so popular that Classic servers are a much bigger deal.
---
he wants to make a ton of money streaming while being a little bitch and having the anonymity of not streaming. he cant have it both ways and that will never work. he said no players from good guilds will play with him. no streamers are going to be in "good" guilds, they will get into guilds that dont care about what streamers think and still get gear.
---
Err me neither - I thought it went kill boars, wake up the peons, and go into that cave?
---
The discussion was about recent WoW you Fucking Muppet. The zeppelin isn't there in classic to begin with.
---
I group them by usage, which I find helps with learning new classes too.
---
Bottom left of row is all abilities in rotation(I like the default 1-5 keys for rotation), less used abilities go to the right in the area of the bar that would conventionally be 6 through to = (bindings are reverse mapped on my naga so numpad 1 on the mouse is = etc)
---
Above that are cooldowns, with highest priority on left: eg. tanking would be shield wall, as a hunter stuff like rapid fire and as a healer things like nature's swiftness(. The further right you go the lower the priority in combat so things like your crowd control spells, buffs and mount/consumables.
---
Personally I find keeping this theme and then putting the applicable abilities in those bar slots makes it easier to switch between specs and characters.
---
I can explain my bindings in a bit more depth if anyone is interested. Over the years I've gone from only having my rotation keybound and clicking everything else like i did in vanilla to having almost every ability keybound.
---
It doesn't extend to BoP drops obviously, the gold you get from vendoring them a pittance compared to how useful the item would be for somebody who could use it. When it comes to BoE stuff though, the gold you could get on the auction house is much closer to being even with how useful the item itself is.
---
Also, if a BoE drops that I can't use and I sell it on the AH, I can use that gold to buy a different BoE that I *can* use. Therefore, I (and everyone else in the group) should have the opportunity to roll on the item.
---
Did it just start recently for you too? I haven't had any trouble with it until this week, but suddenly it's lagging like I'm on dial-up. Damnedest thing.
---
IMO this shit is so dumb, we have a sub here already with a whole community and people don’t wanna just shoot the shit about this game we’re all waiting on and are excited about?
---
I played on gurubashi and remember void and their shenanigans being talked about by our GM to the whole raid.
---
I use shift-w for run and shift-s for mount.
---
Natherzim and then Scilla 
---
&lt;WHAR LEWTZ PLZ HALp&gt;
---
Abec and Jackslammer :)
---
i agree, but I think part of player retention will ultimately fall into what can they provide to get people to stay?  New content? new seasons of servers?
---
As my raid was at the end of AQ40 we did MC once a week to equip new raid members (and see how they play) and farming set pieces (many wanted them for the style) and Sulfuron blocks. With high equip MC feels like a good party. People joking around and having fun. Also we were seldom nearly 40 players at this time as it was not mandatory to take part.
---
But I've played on a RP realm and so people there were a bit different than the usual WoW normie perhaps.
---
Was never bound to anything before being bound to special boss buttons, so there's that. :)
---
&gt; sl
---
Thank you for the interest, unfortunately your raiding time won't really work with my scedule, if you would not mind, i'd like to keep you as a backup, i am a fan of friend based guild simply for the social aspect of it, however i do feel that it can also have some holdback at some point whereas seriousness and punctuality will fail to uphold.
---
I do hope you and your friends manage to have the classic experience to the fulest.
---
Cheers :D
---
I tabbed out of my Beta client, as I was making 60 Silk bandages to read this thread. 
---
Thanks for entertaining rhetoric, while I wait for my crafting queue to clear..  Should just about be done!
---
As a future GM, you can use me as a reference. Totally reliable 100%
---
Semantics...
---
1.13, 1.14...either way, I am not worried.
---
It's going to come, and nobody can;t do anything about it.
---
8-piece netherwind set bonus baby
---
Chad Enh Shaman coming through!
---
Right there with you. Love having a slender and agile female character. But I do have trouble maining them because it does feel harder to immerse myself. Orc warrior for life!
---
It's more rewarding than constantly opening/closing blizz launcher to see if I have beta access maybe finally now.
---
No, please ! I have the Tuesday fully booked !
---
Wanna swap?
---
We have a long time before Naxx becomes dull.  If there are only 50k players that's probably not enough to justify content.  Pray it is a million and new content for Classic will happen.
---
And my Ax!
---
Oh yeah I forgot about them adding that.  I feel like that was a 1.8+ quest.
---
I got turtle polymorph on my mage.  Was really proud of it too.
---
Or more likely is that they've made the CSS even worse and/or the increased traffic is causing bottlenecks.
---
If he is 17 and he is saying that I dont think he need classic
---
Paladin: Full T2 + Ashkandi, but I'm pretty sure a Hunter would be given Ashkandi before a guild would give it to a paladin.
---
Just wanna experience and clear all the raids eventually
---
3% crit to 4 players is really nothing to even consider bringing the class for...
---
Tinder exists for the spreading of STDs.
---
&gt; there was no information about anything, no statistics like we have now
---
We have almost the exact same information now as we did back in Vanilla. Why do all you people who never played Vanilla think that 2005 was some kind of Dark Age. People were mining information from MMOs YEARS before WoW even came out. Where do you think ALL of the "Classic Wowhead" data came from? Where do you think they got the information to start creating private servers?
---
Use your damn head.
---
That's simply not true, they all attack the ranged one.
---
Player retention 2 years from now FULLY depends on what Blizzard is going to do with Classic.
---
You can't be that dumb NOT to see that, are you?
---
Short answer:
---
1. Be as social as you can
---
2. Play a DPS character to start with
---
3. Don't be afraid to run away from a fight you can't win
---
Long answer:
---
**Social:**  The game is challenging throughout, mainly because multiple enemies can destroy you.  Grouping up with people makes it easier to get through these challenges.  
---
There are also a number of quests where 3 people who are ungrouped can get in each other's way.  For example, if you need to kill 10 Thugs, and there are only 12 of them that spawn, then the 3 of you will be fighting over them when they spawn.  Or you can group up and share the credit.  This is especially true of named enemies.
---
Eventually, you will want to do Elite/Group quests, Dungeons, and Raids, where you will need other players.
---
**Play a DPS:**  There are three main roles in an MMORPG - Tank, Healer, and DPS.  The tank's job is to get things focusing on it, the healer's job is to heal the damage taken (mainly the tank), and the DPS is then free to destroy the enemies.  The DPS role is better for newer players because:
---
* It has a lower learning curve in groups
---
* It is faster in the open world
---
* A dungeon run usually has 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 DPS, so if you underperform while you're learning the ropes it's easier to carry you
---
As you learn more about the game, you may decide to continue playing DPS, or you may want to switch to Tank or Healer.  With some classes (Warrior or Druid) you can switch from DPS to tank, and with others (Druid, Priest, Paladin, or Shaman) you can switch from DPS to healer.  The other classes (Mage, Hunter, Warlock, Rogue) you would need to level a new character to make the switch.
---
With that said, the easiest class to level is the Hunter, and that's a good place to start.
---
**Run Away!**  Escaping no-win fights saves you from a really long corpse run (running your spirit from the graveyard back to your body).  Learn how to escape.
---
This is actually a really good thought that I hadnt considered too much because my best friend is planning to main druid and we will play together a lot. I had an alt druid in Legion and really didn't like bear form much though. DPS as cat was a ton of fun though. Which also plays into me liking rogue and maybe not enjoying warrior.
---
Since the zeppelin mentioned is long past Vanilla, all the fall mitigation measures aren't required for jumping off said non-existent zeppelin. And since you mention disengage being changed to a jump back, it would be perfectly usable for fall mitigation, same as paladin bubble was available to horde starting with Burning Crusade.
---
Awesome! 
---
D1 paladin gear was amazing.
---
I 100% agree, one of the reasons I wanted classic so bad was not because I thought it was a perfect game, but because it was just way better than retail wow. Besides the neckbeards, people will eventually burn out and there will need to be more content. But this is where things could go differently and they keep adding content with the vanilla wow philosophy while avoiding the mistakes they made in the past.
---
Pretty easy to reconcile actually
---
- Video games are easy
---
- People are terrible
---
Enjoy myself in a 2 night a week raiding guild with any of my buddies that make it to 60 and wanna keep playing. We've got a solid group right now, still working out the logistics of who plays what. If I end up being the MT I'd like to get Thunderfury. If I end up going rogue then I'd like to get better at pvp as I've never really done it before.
---
I just saw a clip of phase3 paladin doing 1100 dps is optimal situation so maybe it's not that bad. But the consumable requirement is retarded the spec isn't that fun and it won't be good outside of raiding so yeah..
---
pserver? no bug report icon
---
There's a rather interesting coincidence. One of the top stories in russian tabloid media right now is about a rather famous music producer who drank plumbing liquid thinking it was juice. The guy almost died and the story is still developing
---
Im going pretty hardcore for my 2 weeks off and then semi hardcore after that
---
Vanilla went from 2004 to 2007. Classic needs to go at least that long before a next step is implemented one way or another.
---
Orc warlock says hi.
---
Only 1 char lol noob
---
Personally for me, Star Wars: Galaxies.  SWG was my main game from day 1 in 2003 until the NGE (new game enhancements) ruined it for me in 2005, and that's when I found WoW.  I played a little WoW on the side in 2004, but it was just for a breath of fresh air from SWG as my main game.
---
So....I'd love to see a relaunch of SWG - I'd be in there day 1 again and would love it.
---
I want the story about him defrauding the government. What is this from?
---
Well the player base has doubled and reached the prime years so it's pretty impressive even the numbers are not in millions
---
Actually I disagree. Discussing this now is important, as development would take a long ass time. They'd have to start designing things on the release of Classic, or we might face content droughts.
---
I mean, at 30% crit, not going ruin is a 15% drop in DPS on direct damage.  Don't think that's to the level of "might as well go AFK".
---
Last I checked 33% of people choosing Main tank
---
You've been proven wrong and your response is to try to belittle me by insinuating that I need to take a walk instead of graciously taking your L. You are pathetic.
---
I want to full clear Naxx this time around. My guild in vanilla made it through the first few bosses of AQ40 shortly before breaking up due to the TBC changes that were coming. 25 man raid cap broke up a LOT of 40 man guilds.
---
You’ll do fine damage was a warlock.
---
For the Horde  
---
Making a new Hunter, as it was the first i came to lvl 60 with, just before BC launched.
---
Looking forward to Alterac valley (Horde as underdog always feels fun when either slowing the alliance down or winning somehow.), and to play with the old talent system, i was fairly ''decent'' with the hunter in pvp back then, looking forward to seeing if i can recreate that.
---
Gonna try engineering, always heard lots about it, and i'm looking forward to tossing grenades at anyone who tries to get in my deadzone.
---
Gonna do all quests, gain lots of repu, get the pre-raid gear and probably just do casual PvP afterwards, maybe lvl a alt.
---
hey i recently posted one of these and didnt realise it was such an issue. sorry

My dream is to run successful company and being able to sneak 3-4h/day playtime into that
---
A few months after Naxx is released...
---
He/she called someone a meanie. That's definitely a 10 day ban.
---
I'd rather see elements of the philosophy applied in other areas like in 9.0. Classic can just be classic.
---
It's tantalizing it's right in front of your face but classic is forever out of reach (until august 27th)
---
Yes please. I’m tired of the comparisons. They are two separate things with different player bases.
---
Why such a specific number?
---
Why?
---
Link the clip?
---
Real talk, it doesn't matter what spec you run pre-AQ40 because your damage will be low regardless. Show up with bags full of shards to perform your utility role; you aren't there primarily for your damage. By the time the server is far enough along that your damage can be competitive, you'll understand the class well enough to answer your own question without asking us.
---
"pretty good"? it's the best one until Naxx.
---
&gt; I have close to 22k darnassas rep just from Teldrassil and Darkshore
---
I haven’t completed Darkshore yet, but after completing every single quest in Teldrassil, including the Sathrah questline and all other quests which end in Darnassus (but not Encrypted Sigil or the Nessa fedex questline which are blocked to humans), I received a total of 4,939 Darnassus rep. Adjusted down for the human 10% bonus would mean 4,490 rep for your dwarf.
---
&gt; Can we at least presume that the total amount of quests in each zone are correct?
---
ClassicDB has been a very useful resource for tracking where almost all of the quests can be found, along with historical comments to assist you in completing them, however the XP and rep values on that site are definitely off. You can check my work, but I’m pretty sure I haven’t missed a single quest, including all breadcrumb quests, dungeon quests and PVP quests (but no seasonal/holiday quests).
---
Weird flex but ok
---
My theory was that the shaman air totem questline got scrapped because of warrior bias. Blizzard LOVED warriors, they loved them so much they decided that instead of making an epic questling for air totem, they'd rather give that questline for warriors to get their whirlwind axe.
---
Attack it. FOR THE HORDE!
---
thats basically everyone
---
Depends on a lot of things.  Mainly how the population is spread out and if you are able to get a spot to yourself.  
---
Also, you can start aoe grinding as early as lvl 14 if you are skilled enough.
---
No problem, it's more than easy for someone to miss topics, especially with the activity this sub's been getting recently!
---
Don't get me wrong, it's something I've thought a lot about. I just think it might be a better idea to keep those posts collected into the same subreddit if at all possible
---
Same. I honestly don't know if I could still play the game without it.
---
Basically
---
Heads up, 3000 series Ryzen's are out in 1 month.
---
Imo swap rogue for mage. Below 40 at least mage can kill pretty much anything with a healer by his side.
---
Same
---
If Classic turns out to be a flash of interest followed by dismal numbers before the Naxx phase even releases, I doubt announcing 1.14 would bolster the numbers back up significantly.  So pray people beyond your brand of insanity stick around to justify such development.  Then sign another prayer that Blizzard doesn't take the path of less resistance and put out a TBC server.
---
and no one on the beta could summon an infernal lol
---
right? I mean people been asking for classic wow for how long?
---
if we wait till naxx how would what we say matters? Blizz would need to begin development well before naxx..
---
So my goal is to play primarily pvp casually aiming for rank 10 gear.  
---
1. Which version of the rank 10 gear will be in classic?  
---
2. Which class/spec scales best with the stats on their rank 10 gear? Priest, Hunter, shaman?  
---
Since rank 10 is my goal I don't really want to pve at all. The shaman set stats seem wonky and priest is a shadow set only? How well would you do healing in those sets?
---
It's not. 
---
This guy is just whining.
---
Throw yourself into water on private server and learn to swim, before you are thrown into sea
---
Try the blizzard forums......
---
You want to discuss a game after the game that’s currently in beta????
---
Do you know how long it’s gonna take for us to even get through all the stages in classic? How you gonna talk about a sequel before the first one is even done?
---
&gt;Can't experienced players hit level 40 in a few weeks?
---
40 takes about 50-60 hours. However long that takes you.
---
&gt; But currently the sub is getting spammed with posts that probably serve to simply make people frustrated with the volume of this topic, and actually drive people away from wanting it.
---
Don't project.
---
"Will yae look at the bones man?!?"
---
Getting Benediction and my priest T1 from MC and Ony again

The volume of low quality posts is always greater than high quality posts
---
i dont know why people asking about post classic is worse than posts about what class to play or streamer hate posts
---
Nope
---
The maximum value for a 32 bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647. That's how your character's copper value is stored in Vanilla/Classic, thus, that's the maximum amount of currency your character can hold.
---
The only context is that you were wrong, and your ego doesn't allow to admit that.
---
Just play a hunter if you want to. When 2 players go together it will be a faceroll regardless. A shadow priest and a hunter will be tearing through everything.
---
Oh, I know man.  I can still remember the day I hit max level and then a few months later when I got my first epic mount.  Can't wait to do it again!
---

---
maybe that?
---
however that is clearly a pserver.
---
We wont know a lot until live comes or atleast an ironfoe proc rate is confirmed
---
Lol at people acting like they will actually be in the game day 1 fighting for boar kills. You will all be at the login screen with an EXCEPTION HANDLE. That's the real first day experience.
---
To be real though, when Vanilla first launched over a decade ago, my friend and I started on Tichondrius, but Tich was down for the first 3 days. When we finally got in and started our characters, people had been incrementally logging in so there was never a real bottleneck. I imagine things will be similar on this launch.
---
Oh god pserver screenshot how will we mentally cope with this
---
That's actually a one thing Blizzard should / could include without hurting anyone's feelings.
---
* Its still not teleporting (meanwhile mages can still teleport there)
---
* Those zeppelings could use the same textures as other zeppelins so nobody would care
---
Oh nice man! what race are you going to go? yeahh i do have a soft spot for alterac valley! I seem to remember that alot of hunters went engineering back in vanilla days. I never made it to max level in vanilla so really looking forward to it in classic. and like i said in the video getting back with the old talent tree. Really appreciate it you watched/listened to the video and us waffling on about wow classic 😅
---
Awesome pic of darnassus great job!
---
I don't agree with this analysis ... sorry :(
---
You spend lot of time writing it but still ... sorry ... I don't agree with most of it ... of course it may be your opinion:)
---
I'll be going with flurry axe in a similar set up on my to be prot paladin until I can get iron foe. Even then, flurry axe may come out on top on TPS, but also results in more damage in due to the faster attack speed yielding more parries by the boss.

Finishing an argument with calming the other party is a troll, not very convincing.

So far you yet to produce a single shred of anything except attacking me. Show me ANY video where a Warlock as you said "guaranteed kills" a rogue.
---
Before I respond, I'd like to know what you mean by " I'd rather see elements of the philosophy applied in other areas like in 9.0. "
---
Are you talking about picking which features to add by a poll?  Or going back to a Classic philosophy, but with some added conveniences?  Or are both of these missing the point?
---
They were originally doing g it for everything, but people brought up abusing it with groups or 3-4 people needing on stuff and sharing it with each other and screwing a pug out of loot.
---
ironically this means all that paladin tier gets wasted
---
Wait what how? Dont you get blizzard at like 23 or something
---
The difference is a classic level 60 vs a retail 120 with a flying mount. The retail 120 would most definitely be able to complete it faster than a classic level 60. Sure the estimation may be high, but it probably isn’t that far off.
---
Respec caps at 50g per

Nothing like that really. Warr and hunter are probably your best bet but raiding in vanilla is all about lasting as long as you can with minimal resources. So something like rogue even is strictly sinister strike into finisher. Debuff limit takes away a lot of options so no bleeds or dots mostly.
---
Warr can be interesting with good rage generation and hunters need to focus on weaving things between autos so at least it's something more interactive to think about. Plus pet management of you like that.
---
But most of classic is all about lasting as long as you can in raids.

Are you familiar with the concept of the paragraph?
---
Projecting? I was actually reading through the general comments those sort of threads get, or when streamers get asked about it for the hundredth time that week.

I'm actually an incredibly huge advocate for Classic+ content. Just think it would be better to contain those ideas within one thread or even better, its own subreddit until it has more relevance.

I'm not going to doxx him on Reddit as it's a bannable offense, but he *was* doxxed, people looked him up and found all sorts of records of a construction company he and his dad ran that never did any work and sent massive invoices to the government. They were banned from ever receiving contracts again. The entire company had some other really shady dealings, but this was the focus of the video that got made.
---
That’s not true at all though, for the first 2 years of osrs people were very against any change. When people started to complete all the endgame, that’s when the flood gates opened for new content ideas.

that's the spirit

Theres 15 years of content in retail.  Theres like what, 2 or 3 in classic?  Flying mounts aside, theres an astronomical amount of content in retail that classic just doesnt have.

Yeah, they’ve even broken the peak from the initial hype of 2013 when it launched.   OSRS is really impressive.

I'm going nuts too, which means my more casual friends that want to play with me are going to be left in the dust, but it's all towards accomplishing a week one rag kill.
---
What's your purpose in going hard?
---
|What will we do? What will we do if a month into Classic, all of the Phase 1 endgame raid content is cleared?
---
I don't think you understand, Phase 1 endgame raid content will be cleared within 1 week of classic release.
---
All of phase 1 raid content will be cleared by the end of the second week at the latest. That doesn't mean everyone will have cleared it.
---
Was expecting vendorstrike, sorely disappointed...
---
Spent some time playing in Enternet, good times. :)
---
name checks out
---
To everyone's chagrin.
---
Do you guys just think up the most negative scenarios and dwell on it all day? That can't be healthy.
---
Many, many encounters require at least two main tanks. As in literally every boss in BWL requires at least two tanks, and several also require an offtank to eat wing buffets.
---
So one of the worst expansions was made during one of the best expansions?? Sense a pattern?
---
That’s the one item I would deny as a hunter
---
I'm glad you talked so much about feral. That's really where I'm leaning for my second class. I've mained Druid for the past 4 xpacs in live as boomkin (guardian/resto in WotLK), and I'm kinda thinking of keeping that druid-love going. Leveling as feral with Furor in resto tree and Natural Weapons in balance.
---
Whats the go-to spec for PvP at 60 for a feral? Is it a hybrid?
---
You can tank AND heal instances (same player) up to 40 as a shaman.
---
My group did in vanilla. Especially with all the mage/rog/lock/hunter cc
---
you can still grind mobs and group up to do so just invite everyone you see doing the same stuff and youll level up to the point where you are behind/beyond other peoples levels and youll be able to run dungeons without a hitch

Like I said, optimal condition with full wbuffs phase3 BiS and debuffs on target.
---
Oh man I remember Brock. I also remember Driller just wrecking people....
---
The pattern is that you don't know much about the time investment of game development.
---
You would get more mileage out of another mage, even with the aura.
---
Many people have plans for a 11 or 10 day clear time of the raid.
---
No, we did not have the same information as we have now. Its like saying we know now the same as we knew 10 years ago. Just stop and think about that.
---
The private servers actually had to go and watch old videos BECAUSE there is no information about Vanilla. Watch some youtube videos of ppl who spent years on Private servers, the reason private servers had a lot of mechanics wrong is because there was no information available. 
---
Just using my head.
---
Not true. Osrs was a failure all the way until new things got added.

Was expecting a thunderfury.

I remember jumping with mount while running through the cave to stay mounted for as long as possible.

Dude this is what I do all day. It's mental!

Because we were talking about non optimal specs.
---
Making a new thread to make fun of all of the people who make new threads about the topic is just as bad and annoying.
---
Maybe you should play it as an exploration game which ESO does do better.
---
100% agree, most people won't because "changes != classic" but you can have new an updated content while still staying true to the core aspects of vanilla/classic, Just cause they add a new raid doesn't mean the old raids will become dead content, it all depends on HOW new content is added. You can add new content for years to come and avoid massive powerscaling
---
www.vanillafriends.com and cross your fingers
---
I completely agree. I jumped on Legion and BFA for a while and remember thinking exactly the same thing. Looking forward to the uniqueness of the classes.
---
The hunter didn't turn off cheetah for the whole duel :(
---
I mean this was pretty much the average player back then at that level though, but still.
---
I know that it was around, what I am saying is that it influenced the path of how raids and dungeons worked in later expacs and thus when there is a chance to "redo" classic for the stuff people loved vanilla for, DBM is part of the problem in my eyes. And you proved my point, if you didn't have the addon people didn't accept you *because you were behind*
---
*gasps*
---
People here don't appear to want to 'shoot the breeze' about what comes after Classic. For a number of reasons. One of which is that it is at least, at least, two years away.
---
Anyone who does want to shoot the breeze about it, and I'm sure there are literally dozens of them, is quite welcome to head over to the other sub.
---
And until we have some concrete numbers on how many people are playing Classic and what their future desires are all these posts are just spaffing up the wall.
---
Throw shade all you want but if you want retail then sure, follow the patterns of retail.
---
Well let me know what realm you play on when you make a character, so I can go a head, and avoid you in my groups.
---
Oh, streamer "knowledge", how cute.
---
You know the difference between me and 90% of the streamers? I played in Vanilla, in a raiding guild that cleared the entirety of the content.
---
And I played a Warlock.
---
So I have first hand knowledge of going on par, and above, Rogues, Mages and Warriors on numerous occasions, and consistently.
---
**But please, do not change your beliefs! And keep trusting the "knowlegable" streamers with their cute "rankings" and other attention whoring videos.**
---
Because, if you, and a lot of other easily influencable people do so, Warlock will once again be an underplayed class, and our raid spots will be pretty much guaranteed. ;-)
---
How does being subjected to those posts take away from anyone's experience, enjoyment, or the essence of this subreddit?
---
You literally have to actively want and choose to have a negative reaction to those posts in order for it to be an issue.
---
It's akin to people that get pissy about reposts. I can't take those types of people seriously and it makes me wonder how they make it through the day without giving themselves an aneurysm.

Pick a race that you like the look of and get in there! As long as you're polite, people won't mind helping out a newbie and answering questions. It's been forever since I played classic, but here are a few etiquette rules that I remember which might not be immediately obvious: 
---
1. Don't need on an item unless you're going to equip it. Ask before needing on a rare BoE drop. This is extremely important, people will forgive you if you mess up and wipe the group, but ninja looting can often get you kicked.
---
2. Don't pull mobs unless you're the tank, or someone has asked you to. Some tanks get mad when you pull for them.
---
3. Don't loot chests if you're in a party. If I remember right, the group will usually roll off to see who gets them.
---
4. If you are a miner, don't mine a vein that someone else is already mining. 
---
5. In dungeons, make sure you always attack whatever the tank is attacking so you don't pull too much hate. AoE threat is more difficult in classic WoW than it is in some other MMOs. 
---
6. This one isn't mandatory, but buffing random people is always appreciated!
---
I'm sure there are other etiquette rules that I'm not thinking of right now, but don't worry too much about it. Even if you do slip up, people will generally forgive you if they know you're new. Other than that, I think it's best to learn as you go. 
---
Happy questing!
---
Three ideas off the top of my head:
---
1. Play one of the less "optimal" specs, and work on getting the most out of it (scratches the min/max itch without breaking the game)
---
2. PvP (your opponents never get trivialized)
---
3. Reduce the number of players participating in the dungeon (four man scholo/strat, 8-man UBRS, etc... increases the amount of loot per player!)
---
So a double all nighter and some change. That's entry level no-lifing
---
Sit and complain
---
Work, gym, family, friends, guitar, and Jesus Christ.
---
.
---
Jesus Christ is my cat's name.
---
Join a guild that wants to progress slower. Take your time and enjoy the game. I for one will be running my own raid group of people who want to clear, but not take the game so seriously. I am in it for the adventure, not just the raid. I will be leveling with my battle buddy and she is a quest reader, so we will be taking a long while to level which is going to be a good time.
---
So edgy with your sick taste in music brah.

SM is being farmed right now for 3 reasons: 
---
1. Characters are over-geared due to initial level cap, and thus can more easily speed run instances like SMGY. 
---
2. Players have already completed many of the quests they would be doing in the early 30's as nobody really expected the level cap raise so soon, if at all. 
---
3. With a large % of characters having hit 30, there is a lot of competition for mobs to grind outside of instances.
---
Pfff, I could afk half a fight and beat any warrior on my mage in MC.
---
how else are they supposed to complain / prepare to complain about stuff
---
Classic servers should stay intact. Remember the whole reason we are here is cause you can no longer get that experience.
---
If they decide expansions (be it same or new) or to add content to classic. It should come on different servers. This would avoid people requesting WoW Classic:Classic in the future and also appease those who want either expansions or new content.
---
Found the incel
---
Find another friend IRL and get them to play with you. No guides, just group up and go
---
Powershift macros were very much a thing in vanilla.  If you didn't see them very often that's just because you didn't see many druids.
---
Having been thinking about this a lot today I realize the issue with adding additional content after Naxx is raid tiers. If they add new raids do they make them harder than Naxxramas? Do they add some kind of catch up system so that casual players are able to get geared for it? Not sure how that would go over with the classic fanbase.
---
You could also do nods to WoW's other expansions without actually doing them. Like Kezan as a level 60 zone with a raid where Trade Prince Gallywix is the final boss and the raid reputation is the player character goblin's company trying to overthrow him. Or have Quel Thalas be an outdoor PvP zone with large scale battles to take settlements with Silvermoon being the Alliance reputation and base and Zul Aman be the horde version. But again I don't know how that kind of thing would sit with the no changes crowd
---
That is a solid list.
---
Most quests are just grinding sessions in disguise.
---
Because i like to nerd out and also once my 2 weeks is up i will only have about 3-4 hours a night to play so im hoping i can ding 60 and at least have my pre raid bis farmed and can start working on proffesions
---
Yea. This community is pretty fucking toxic.
---
Can’t wait for them to magically turn into a tight nit community once classic releases./s
---
As a former vanilla raider i hope that aq40 and naxx will be the "bulwark" and be as hard as i remember them, so that things dont get cleared too fast. Non-hardcore/non-premade guilds will hopefully still need a bunch of gear on  their members to progress.
---
But ony mc bwl will be no competition i think.
---
In your last post you say that everyone is getting miserable waiting in this sub because the same questions keep getting asked over and over....
---
And then you ask the same recycled questions that you were just talking about.
---
PvP: Dwarf or Gnome (stoneform or escape artist)
---
PvE: Human (Sword/Mace spec)
---
Ease: Human I guess?
---
PvP: Orc (stun resist)
---
PvE: Orc or Troll (Axe spec for Orc, the haste racial for troll)
---
Ease: Tauren I guess for more health and aoe stun.
---
I will keep mousclicking like I did back in vanilla. True exerience 😂
---
So who exactly works on the new expansion for classic then? How do you start hiring people for a game that’s Year’s away?
---
Blizzard has already pretty much said tbc is next. You want them to also deveop another game on top of that? You want them to put out two classic games at the same time?
---
MTXs have not managed to revive stagnant revenues however. They are part of the problem that burns players out.
---
A consistent game, that is not polluted by such things, could have a market niche and audience loyalty, that more than makes up for the lower monetization.
---
There are people who eat their own shit after they freeze it in condoms. So it wouldn't surprise me.
---
I rocked a Druid in vanilla but wasn't allowed to raid because of my refusal to heal.  Swift Kitty was the only thing that kept me playing in my first couple of months of not knowing what the heck I was doing.  I think that when classic releases, I will probably roll a Rogue, find a good group of people to play with, and see if I can get into some of those raids that I never got to try.
---
keybinds were reserved for shocks only!
---
&gt;getting burned out
---
This is the one thing that's stopping me from playing the certain pserver right now. I also played Nost through the current popular pservers and have characters there i can work on, but honestly, i want to wait for the real deal come August 27 and start over with everyone else, which is also just 10 days after my birthday! I can wait and want to be hyped to the max!!
---
As someone who usually rolls priest, I'd much rather have someone be full shadow and puts in the effort/consumables than force someone into a bastardized spec that is useless outside of raids so the min-maxing raidleaders can feel better about themselves at night.
---
And pretty much every shadow priest I've ever raided with knows what is expected of them if they want to keep their spot. They don't slack off, unlike most mages I've seen.
---
Why would it be an issue if it's disclosed before the run starts? Sure if you don't like the loot rules don't come along, same deal if a raid leader says x item is reserved for y player.
---
i said, poopy butthold
---
That's very true.
---
That’s exactly what I’ve been doing. In addition to that, I’ve limited myself to only killing gray quest mobs whenever possible and completing all Alliance quests for maximum spillover rep. As a level 22 human in the Beta, having completed every single Alliance quest at the appropriate level up to level 17 quests, I’m currently at:
---
Darnassus - Honored 2,762/12,000
---
Gnomeregan Exiles - Honored 45/12,000
---
Ironforge - Honored 906/12,000
---
Stormwind - Honored 3,464/12,000
---
Revered is still a long way off and Exalted seems unlikely before level 40.
---
What do you mean? Not using all 12 buttons or something?
---
good day sir scrubbles
---
Bosses drop very little loot in raids. It takes months of clearing MC to have a guild geared up for MC. Even afterwords it'll be run for the rest of Classic to grind out bindings and gear up alts. 
---
Just about every post phase 1 raid, if not every post phase 1 raid, will be cleared within 24 hours. The real challenge is maintaining a raid roster while gearing up the entire guild. 
---
Not to mention pvp is always a blast. I can't speak for anyone other than myself, but having better gear for pvp is a pretty massive motivator when it comes to sticking out raids.
---
Unless there is some kind of monkey wrench from the pserver meta. Like say FR actually needed by all in the raid.
---
No more needs to be said. Unless you want to consider Tauren PVE for tanking

You have no first hand knowledge of anything that you have said, and almost everything you have said has been wrong. Then you post joke videos based on peoples feelings and say that it must be true, and you are too lazy to Google "vanilla wow rogue vs warlock".
---
You got what you wanted, troll, you have wasted other peoples' time. You will not have any more of mine.
---
Fuckin troll.

don't worry I hate myself more than you ever could

Oh buddy, you will never get alone recharge time. You need some space.. so you move to your little man cave to log into Azeroth, but le gasp! Shes there too!

I've been just wasting my time on Lightbringer Private, or whatever it's called. Just need a taste!
---
I feel like I say it a ton, but shadow you are the man
---
Wow, this is really inspiring.
---
I've mained a paladin since Wrath and I really like the class, but it's just so broken in classic. I've been thinking of rolling a Warrior, Pally, Hunter and Shaman and then continuing with the one I like the most, aiming to keep the paladin as a kind of alt.
---
But no, you did this as your main character and you got that lightbringer set! 
---
Maybe I'll just throw caution to the wind and roll a pally anyway.
---
What a ride. Its for this reason I have only one main and one alt planned. It will be nice to have a second chance.
---
he was red to me too, poor troll :(
---
Video is copyrighted, cant watch.
---
Yeah nevermind about that, you're literally not listening.
---
The cycle must continue
---
The closest you're probably going to get is Fury Warrior or Rogue again.
---
Warrior has stance dancing which can increase APM, and is one of the best end game DPS in 1.12.
---
Raided mythic in Panda and Legion as dedicated ele shaman, which I loved. But I want to do something a little different this time around, so I was thinking mage or warlock.

I like that mage has solid leveling and farm capability. I also like that there isn't an insane rotation to learn (frankly the only reason I was able to mythic raid is because I was with my buddy who was a server best monk) so I can focus on more holistic aspects of playing and be competitive. But on the same side of the coin, I was leaning warlock because it seems a little more engaging to play. If it matters we would probably roll horde).
---
Yes, afaik it only had 1hp
---

---
I would love a BDO stagnant basic server that would be pre-pri/duo/trio. The impossible grind release was way too much for me and if you don't match their gear fairly closely you get stomped in pvp.
---
Despite what people will tell you, Feral druid is very much bottom of the barrel in terms of specs / classes in vanilla.
---
Not to say they're useless and the things people say do hold *some* merit. But theres a reason druids in general are considered a meme outside of raid healing and flag carrying in WSG. (The only other thing would be their nigh-unkillable status in a 1v1 but they're not killing shit themselves.)
---
Yeah I have a hunter or shaman alt in retail that's wearing Herod's Shoulder, which is now a plate item.
---
No, the setup I used to run just had me doing two at a time constantly without having to stop unless I got ganked.
---
On one hand we have some statistical data from multiple sources, on the other hand we have an anecdote from a single person. 
---
Just because you saw a couple of black cars get into accidents doesn't mean all black cars are more prone to get into an accident.
---
It's not.
---
Speeches are epic if their content is epic, or their context is important.
---
Some annoying guy being idolized by hordes of herd animals is, and rambling about it, is neither.
---
5 day MC clear seems like stretching it to me. Already shown that leveling takes more time than pservers and the record speed time to 60 remains 4days 20 hours.
---
Could be possibly wouldn’t be that surprised but would be surprised.
---
good rebuttal. really showed me. sodapoppin can bitch all he wants but no one gives a shit about some stupid bitchlist that he thinks hes gonna have work.

Okay, cya?

Hi, /u/trent295
---
Love watching this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0MuQitfFkM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0MuQitfFkM)
---
&gt; I do not remember if Blizz would restore a deleted character fully back in Vanilla.
---
they did.
---
I love the idea, but things like this are easily faked.
---
So would that just be running either DS/Ruin and SM/Ruin? Or is there a different spec for PvP at max?
---
DETHECUS:
---
famous for being full of gankers and scumbags.... and i say that proudly. 
---
LLD: loser leaves dethecus duels where the loser had to leave server
---
famous players included: Outbackjak , Ver, Vikesboy, Bas, Crouton, Moobaca, liquidsnake... and of course... the infamous "Angwe"
---
My Character: Twokings
---
Guild: Eclipsed
---
pvp rank: 10 :(
---
Performance is part of it, especially for the harder raids and progression kills of even easy raids,  but the whole hybrid thing is made far worse by how messy it makes loot distribution. 
---
Hybrids specs are almost all actually pvp specs, and hybrids will often try to demand a monopoly on that type of gear because it is their “main spec”. A lot of regular raiders respec for weekend pvp, and are just as enthusiastic and skilled with it as people who try to raid like that. It can tear a guild apart to punish the people who respec constantly to make sure the raids can actually happen. 
---
I like method esfand the famous streamer, and I liked esfand when he was just a humble private server gamer, but the amount of different 2h weapons he wasted was absolutely criminal. His guild honestly did better than I would have expected, but they struggled terribly to find warriors and holy paladins, because in a guild like that, they did not get to enjoy vanilla wow the way they would in any other guild.
---
Philosophy =/= features.
---
The WoW team as it grew didn't underatand that there was intent behind some of the design decisions made in classic, and they didn'tunderstand the importanceof those decisions. The slow pace encouraged social interaction.  The difficulty encouraged teamwork. Demand drove the economy.
---
Players are so self-sufficient in BFA. I think the devs need to learn a thing or two about why classic was so good.
---
Hunter ammo is a specific example I'll use; some of the best bullets come from engineering. It gives engineering more value. Demand drives an economy just as much as supply. In BFA, its mostly just supply.
---
And no, i dont think players should be voting. I think the devs should re-evaluate their design philosphy and apply it to the modern game.
---
If you're melee weaving that is. Otherwise Brutality Blade and Core Hound Tooth are better...but good luck getting those over Ashkandi.
---
Yes which is why I think it's a joke to bring a class for such a meager aura.
---
I’m asking you questions... I’m sorry for asking questions. I thought this was a discussion but it seems like you just want people to take your OPINION and nothing else. 
---
The fact you’re ending this conversation when I’m asking you questions kinda makes me wonder how much you actually stand behind your opinion.
---
Yeah, but enough about the Oscars.
---
This. My guild wasn't bad, but they weren't good enough to get in original Naxx or clear all of AQ20 or AQ40. I'll take my time, but I'll eventually want a guild who is actually serious about downing content.
---

I want to relive my first character I ever made but my cousin deleted when he was at level 50. Was a night elf warrior, my first character when WoW launches. Went through a lot with that guy. I started off leaving Darnasses at lvl 7 and making my way alll the way to storm wind on foot/boat, having to ask in general char for directions and dying a lot. I plan to redo this journey again and hopefully get this character past 50 to redeem him for his loss all those years ago.
---
Yea it's pretty crazy.  Seeing Cdew go from 500 subs and like 1-3k viewers, to 3.5k subs and over 8k viewers last night is great.  Esfand pretty much doubled and is at 10k now.
---
I've seen shockadin dps specs that stack spell power and BC ret specs that used spellpower, but this is the first I've seen mostly ret build that used crowd pummelers and seal of righteous in pve. I'm curious to see if it gets tested more with on proc items that benefit spell power or enchants like life stealing.
---
Inevitably we will see the spell power melee shaman spec pop up after this.
---
Yup. I'm doing 30 hours at launch. Then 9 hours sleep. Then 18/6 for the rest of the week.
---
Aside from the inital push, it's just my normal M-F, but wow instead of work during the day, and wow instead of Gray's Anatomy reruns at night. Ain't bad.
---
Thanks for the response. I’ve got a further question for you- As a dagger rogue in PvP do you still use +7 wep dmg/+15 agile or do you use crusader for a heal?
---
My naga broke not long after I quit during WoD (thanks League of legends) and I've been practicing my leveling paths on Pservers since then, it took a while to get used to but I can live without one now. I'll be getting a new one for classic release though.
---
Why would you ever use firestone?
---
Yeah taking Ashkandi as a hunter and not weaving melee attacks is a sin
---
“I have given you money, give me beta” isn’t the strongest argument I have seen.
---
&gt; some statistical data from multiple sources,
---
So far you posted a video by a guy who never amounted to anything in Vanilla. If you think that constitutes "statistical data", I pity you.
---
I just spent 10 mins looking and for the life of me can’t find it now, it was a Shadow Priest in Naxx going through trash and bosses and appearing between 1st and 4th regularly on the meters. I was shocked and I swear I’m not making it up haha, going crazy now that I can’t find it!
---
Yeah but this is toxic wow community where people require you to have a gear score higher than the content gives.  People aren't going to take hybrid dps unless they are super desperate, or you are in a guild where you are an officer and can get away with it.  
---
I was lucky enough to dick around on my shaman in MC/BWL/ZG as Ele.  It was fun.  Did I do great damage? No, but I was also healing some and dropping buffs for the group so there's that.
---
The joke is that they'll just have my sub in two months. No need to take it seriously.
---
Man the struggle of keybinding before I got my mouse with 12 hot keys on it. Not it’s just bar 1 (0-9np,-,+), bar 2 (shift 1-6np, 1-6 kb) and bar 3 is just odd stuff I don’t even need hotkeyed like professions and portals and whatnot. Bar 1 basically all my regular rotation and a hot key for my mount, bar 2 on shift is cooldowns and trinkets and on kB is defensive stuff (mage so ice barrier iceblock invisibility). Before this mouse it was like shift, alt, ctrl and a struggle to do everything I wanted to do.
---
you highly overestimate how quickly a group of 40 people can hit 60.
---
it will take at least a week to HIT 60. 
---
the fastest speed run of vanilla at the time was over 4 day play time. 
---
break that into 16 hour days and you have 6 days from release before people hit 60.
---
I have played ESO a lot, and appreciate it for what it is. My point is that i really dont care about progress or upgrades because I feel as if i dont need any of it, and that classic wow scratches that itch better than modern games.
---
oof
---
If you are using Dagger, as any spec, for PvE or PvP, you get +Weapon Damage on Main Hand, period. And +15 Agility is good on Off Hand for the increase to Crit Chance
---
So a person who never gets personal and presents evidence is a troll but a person who throws insults, never presenting a single shred of anything except supposed "first hand knowledge" is not a troll??
---
In that case I am proud to be a "troll".
---
You are asking questions about topics I answered in the posts that you respond to.
---
&gt;How do you start hiring people for a game that’s Year’s away?
---
You don't. The development would have to start now to be in time.
---
&gt;Blizzard has already pretty much said tbc is next.
---
&gt;You want them to also deveop another game on top of that?
---
That's what game developers do.
---
&gt;You want them to put out two classic games at the same time?
---
Did I ever say so?
---
Reminder that talking cross faction is punishable. Not recommended.
---
Not a fan of heroic versions of encounters, but I do like the idea of having optional bosses that are "heroic" within dungeons/raids.  It gives better players something more to progress on, and doesn't detract significantly from the amount of content lesser players get to see.
---
so... no source?
---
going paladin again ?
---
I've had this problem for a few days now too, the only thing that fixed it was turning off the custom CSS.
---
Take my energy and sinceres hug, dear US based WoW players.
---
Greetings from someone who will play on the EU-German realms, where this problem doesn't exist :P
---
I don't overly remember people saying classic wow was going to be hard, I think what makes classic wow 'a hard game to play' is the level of commitment for certain tasks, the challenge might not be the raid itself, but I assure you, getting 40 players together and trying to organise the raid will be the challenge, grinding will be hard and time consuming.
---
As for gameplay being 'hard', such as mob damage or boss strategies etc, I don't think World of Warcraft was designed with this thought in mind, after all, World of Warcraft was advertised as a casual friendly version of ever quest that all types of people could enjoy.
---
Ah my bad, you must be super fun at parties.
---
Just to add:
---
Ally PVE tank: Human
---
Horde PvE tank: Troll but tauren also good.
---
[Here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/loot-trading-in-classic-updated/131586/111)'s what Blizzard said:
---
&gt; The answer to the UBRS question is: loot trading will be available in content that has a raid lock. UBRS will not have a raid lock.
---
&gt; A big part of loot trading (in a 2-hour window) as a solution to a concern is that raid locks require you to wait a week (or 3 days) before you can try again for the loot that was accidentally given to the wrong person.
---
Levelling definitely takes longer on pservers. Pservers intentionally buffed pretty much everything.
---
As a paladin raider since vanilla, I agree. Dawn thy robe.
---
We have VASTLY different definitions of 'legendary' and 'epic'
---
People have also been banned since wows inception. You’re not supposed to communicate cross factions. You typing gibberish so that the other faction sees English is 100% direct communication.
---
Before the, you know, fire.
---
Hmm you actually got me thinking now.... let me sleep on it and ill get back to you
---
Streamers can suck a tauren ballsack.
---
Yea, untill there is no content.
---
More than you for sure.
---
You would have to be quite naive to think that their viewership will take a drastic hit, sorry to say.
---
he literally mentions a black list? what are you saying.
---
nope guess the post is dumb
---
It’s funny asmongold always got in. He never has a q to wait to get into the server
---
For structured pvp Tauren doesn't seem half bad as a warrior. If I had to choosen between them I'd go orc though. The bigger hit box makes it harder for druids to escape hamstring spam and war stomp is pretty useful.
---
ill be maining a lock and rolling a druid. i think both classes fit to the same type of person. the nuance of each class and the multiple pools of resources what with mana and hp with lock and rage/energy/mana with druid. if you dont want to be delegated to heals only youre only other bet is offtank. as an off tank druid you will always be able out dps an offtank warrior(NOT a fury warr) and most of the time offtank druids have more hp and armor than the offtank warrior. however dpsing as a cat is doable and can preform very well on the dps charts it takes a lot of try hard mode farming manual crowd pummelers, elixirs and whatever else im not super knowledgeable. all three roles are doable but youll always face the naysayers just do your research and farm.
---
From a player from 2004, feelsbadman
---
All vanilla rotations are simple. The difficulty is in the preparation
---
what part are you confused about?
---
They're one of the fastest levelers next to hunter and warlock when played right. Travel form + almost no downtime.
---
I think warrior is definitely more what you're looking for if you want to push end game.
---
but there isnt hybrid dps, its all hunters/mage aoe/grenades, with twinked characters that blow through potions and use elixirs.
---
very, very few actual classic dungeon groups will meet this standard. more than likely they will be people in some quest greens and white gear, short on pots, no engineering. when they huge pulls because they saw a streamer do it they will get slaughtered.  then they will realize that they need to slow down, use some CC, etc.
---
Tier 1 and 2 are just for looks anyway. Bad for healing, not the best for dps. Tier 3 is straight healing.
---
aw, someone’s jealous. :(
---
&gt; and you’re left being bored after a few days of play time because you already conquered everything.
---
And all that remains to do after that, is grindy, shitty, repetitive boring pseudo-content to drag out the game.
---
The prime example: The Rift-Bullshit in Diablo III
---
I didn’t think I had to do 2 seconds of googling for you but sure I’ll continue to hold your hand. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291725/burning-crusade-and-wrath-legacy-servers-possibly-in-wows-future
---
Now go ahead and reply about how “it’s not 100% hurrr durrr” even though you said they should be developing the next game by now. Since you know how game development works :).
---
Why is this a good thing? Had some guy last night who had to leave during the dungeon, which is totally fine, but taking 20 minutes to find a replacement DPS and walk back to the dungeon kinda sucks. I feel like a lot of quality of life improvements are viewed negatively when they simply remove time wasting inconveniences.
---
That’s awesome.  I mained a Shaman through some of WOTLK.  Glad to see they’re going to be popular.
---
I don't really care if they blacklist actual snipers but what seems messed up is if they accidentally blacklist someone who's just playing on the same realm and kills them because well its a pvp server, that's what you do, I hope they aren't careless about it.
---
This is correct with the one exception being Troll is better  for PvE if youre certain you’ll get TF
---
"Can you please alter the entire sub because something stupid and unimportant bothers me a little." FYFY
---
What soda wants is never going to happen. There will be guilds on both sides at the forefront of progression that actively encourage streamsniping. This just makes me wish he wasn't rolling on my faction so I could gank him too.
---
Don’t know where you’re getting that info from. Sure they may have buffed mob damage but it’s already been talked about by streamers and pserver players in the beta that leveling in the beta is longer.
---
Chances are pservers have not only rep rewards from quests off but also experience as well. I mean hell I can say for a fact that leveling speed is slower just from the little play time I had on the stress test and that was to lvl 5 and 10.
---
im100 percent down to join the blacklist
---
No content?? There’s always more content. After naxx you have TBC. Like blizzard has already talked about.
---
I'd be interested in additional servers that represent a "Classic+" experience that has new content, but doesn't make any core class/game changes. Instead of the Dark Portal opening as it did for BC, maybe have it destroyed by some mysterious entity - creating a new alternate timeline.
---
Survivability isn't an issue so you either go for more threat with Orc/Troll or easier anti fear with Undead.
---
My dumbass thought you were implying your brothers warrior was High Overlord Saurfang
---
I am glad most of these streamers play Alliance so I don't have to even give a shit about them and even better that it sounds like a good deal will play on a PvE server because of their high profile, which is even better.
---
I actually really enjoy watching streamers and have no problems with them on a personal level but I really don't want to play on the same faction or even the same server as them just based on the annoyance of it all.
---
I was an active member of the Stormwind Guard and I attribute Moon Guard RP with some of my fondest teenage memories. I miss it every day, and I actually just resubbed last month to try and get back to it. I look forward to immersing myself in the world again!
---
Interesting. 
---
Also, god damn it now I have another choice to think of. 
---
Think I'll narrow it down to warlock, priest, and druid...then I'll probably make all three and become an altoholic like I was in vanilla.
---
No. With the clowns. Woop Woop!
---
Everyone should definitely play on them though 😉
---
Yikes! A child with a toddler's attention span crying over a 30 minute video.  Stick to BfA, zoomer.
---
No, not at all, just the first 10 levels till you get bear form and when you get cat at 20 and shred (you'll be 'frontshredding') at 32 (I think it's 32). You'll be third fastest class after hunter and lock. You'll have none to very low downtime since you can just get out of form and throw yourself some heals.
---

---
I agree I'm sure I'll get downvoted, but QoL improvements have slowly killed WoW.
---
Yes many improvements have benefited the overall health of WoW, but little by little we have lost what made the game so great during Vanilla.
---
LFD/LDR tool killed the sense of community/reputation building/server identify. 
---
Flying killed the sense of immersion and to an extent world PvP.
---
Blizz and their "Bring the player, not the class" killed class uniqueness.
---
Like I said I agree with many changes that have been implemented and WoW has come along way and the fact it's still around shows Blizz must be doing something "right" even though a lot of people disagree.
---
I'm personally really looking forward to a much simpler time where playerskill and a person's willingness to invest time in their character actually means something instead of every class literally being a carbon copy of the other.
---
Good ol Lagonmaw.

You *could* argue that, but it's a pretty weak argument and I don't see anybody making it. Getting somebody a tiny bit closer to something they can buy and getting somebody all the way to something they can buy are very different situations.

That's literally what he said. Can you present any convincing word acrobatics to make it seem like he doesn't? Or is it ad-hominems all you've got?

You need to have Crowd Pummeler for every pull to get those numbers. I think Flurry Axe ended up being the best item after that.
---
I would not level a paladin just to do the spellpower build, but I would 100% try it out if I leveled one.
---
Destroying the Horde is better. So many smug brats played Horde on my server.
---
Good. If you don't want to be seen, use an invis potion.
---
I think that last part was a bit funny
---
Well it won’t effect the average joe who’s just casually walking around. They won’t blacklist someone that kills them once and never to be seen again.
---
Nah I was and still am on Windrunner- US. 
---
People with the UBRS key were the real heroes here! We had a few kind souls like yourself that liked helping everyone else get attuned. I miss that atmosphere that was present in the game then.
---
I'm not miserable
---
how many times are we gonna see this damn question?
---
It‘s not wow classic related. Go delete that post.
---
What do you mean? There have been people that directly compare the mobs from classic and pservers. The info is available to anyone. Experience rewards are correct, but mobs have more armor and resistances, deal more damage, and use abilities much more frequently. How is it possible that it takes longer on the beta?
---
Getting very interested in rolling a druid at launch as my main, and I've heard both sides of the story. 
---
1. Druids are weak except for resto, and it's near impossible to get a raid spot unless youre rolling resto. You're used for innervate and Rebirth. Theyre weak in PvP except as flag carriers, other classes can do what they can but better (minus flags)
---
2. They're very satisfying to play, and have a great kit in PvP. You can whittle your opponents down while ignoring slows and poly's. You can heal yourself, utilize your different forms depending on the need, and while you won't be getting top HK's, you'll have a lot of fun.
---
So I know balance is just straight garbage, to my dismay. Feral is decent in PvP and mediocre at best in PvE? Is getting a raid spot an option as a feral, or would I need to run a full resto spec to get into raids? I'm looking to PvE so I can PvP in good gear, but I don't want to be re-speccing twice a week to have fun.
---
i am predicting some people's almost manic hype for this game is gonna crash hard
---
Nah I find that really hard to believe. I've seen too many old people addicted to Facebook.
---
Do you also leave the party when no one laughs at your joke? Deleting your post shows how much fun you are.
---
Any level 60 with a pulse can be viable in raids with zero talents because the raids fit 40 people and only require about 25 people to complete.
---
That said, most guilds won't accept people that can't pull their own weight and there are plenty of specs that will NEVER be able to pull their own weight.
---
Vanilla has been theorycrafted to death over the last 15 years. There are no surprises in store for any of us.
---
Was a orc with my first hunter that i got to lvl 40?!?  
---
Then i made a troll hunter and lvled him to 60.
---
So gonna make a new Orc hunter, The Rake as pet and my best friend as a mage to lvl with.
---
Now just gonna raise my kids well the next 2-3 months, finish my Masters degree and then say farewell, and probably return to play WoW casually and rejoin the world outside of warcraft.
---
that's what the cooks are telling me - thanks mate!
---
Uhh fair point; I actually don't have any concrete sources. It's just how I've always remembered it and I've seen others make the same claim. Wish I had beta so I could test it out!
---
Exactly. If a DPS druid/shaman was in my raid, I'd hope they came fully prepared; full consumes and pre bis to make sure they can pull their weight. But if they're sitting at the bottom of the DPS charts every fight, for weeks on end...why not get an extra mage or rogue? Or get them to respec into heals? Like, yes...these specs can work but you have to be seriously committed to acquiring the best shit to play a mediocre spec. Maybe heal and collect a offset when you can, would be best imo.
---
Also because shifting rapidly uses a lot of mana and has few practical applications.
---
Hunter is named because it was the only class that could claim anything as potentially an upgrade. Intellect gave them mana which they use, spirit gave regeneration, aging gave crit and scaled off their talent, strength gave AP. Spell damage for the spells, AP for the abilities. Everything could potentially be used bu them so selfish or ignorant hunters would need on anything they could even if it really wasnt meant for them.
---
Come on, be honest with yourself
---
I will be camping streamers....
---
if you can't take the heat gtfo the kitchen
---
This. Soda normally seems pretty switched on from what I've seen but this is just pure stupid. Maybe it's some next level troll but he seems serious to me. Yes we get it you're a big streamer and make millions from playing computer games and big celebrity okok. Do you think the top raiding guilds on the other faction give a shit? Lolno. If anything this stupid video is practically guaranteeing there'll be top guilds on the other faction that go out of their way to troll him whenever they can.
---
crap now I have to roll tauren.
---
He has actual information from Private Servers.... so does it matter who he was or was not in Vanilla? Just because someone played Vanilla that does not make the an absolute expert. Again, you are basing your information on your personal subjective experience.
---
Baron Rivendare's steed is and i will hear nothing further.
---
Lol....
---
Still an ungodly amount of farming. I personally would hate the feeling of wondering if it's "worth" burning a pummeler for X fight or not. I'd want to see how bad the spec DPS is like without pummeler for comparison.
---
AOE leveling is not advantageous until you get CoC at 26. While you can do it earlier, it's not efficient and is more like a party trick than a legit leveling strategy.
---
Then after that point you have to be so far ahead of the pack to possess the AOE leveling spots that's not something you can realistically expect. You have to remain in each spot for multiple levels, meaning that even if you're a couple of levels ahead of everyone else, they will invade your AOE leveling spot before you're ready to move on to the next one. AOE leveling is not for server launches, it's for making alts after the leveling population is sparse.
---
For example, I exclusively AOE leveled a mage after the launch of ZG on a server, and I still had to share AOE leveling spots with others roughly half the time. Commonly it was another mage AOE leveling -- sometimes two! You can try and find some rando spot to grind undisturbed, but be aware that everyone knows the good spots and if no one is using one it's because that spot is not more efficient than questing.
---
There are exactly two places you can AOE level in peace during server launch: Mara (requires lots of invis pots) and DM:E (requires a special spec to start there at level 54).
---
Bottom line, stick with your friends.
---
Lol said hunter is easy. One of the more difficult to classes to play well
---
Yes! His name was Lard. Wonder what became of that bear.
---
I hope he gets extra stream snipers after this.
---
That’s right! I forgot about the BRD entrance to MC. But yeah definitely wasn’t nearly as drawn out as the Onyxia attunement line.
---
How exactly does one accomplish this?
---
Asking for myself so the mounting frustration doesn't finally manifest itself in violence and hurt myself and/or my PC.
---
That's a quick swift boot and a bad reputation. 4 other players would very quickly spread that around.

The thing is that streamers and their viewer are only new potential players Blizzard is trying to reach. I get it, the more the better for everyone but I'm sure most of these fans will be new to vanilla. Their 100k+ viewers are a drop in the bucket of millions of subscribers that were here before twitch was a thing.
---
2 damage! 2 damage!
---
The melee damage is not to be underestimated.  People try to close on hunters and dead zone them.  Being able to crit for 500 with a strong 2h is a really nice response to that tactic.  Particularly with the points in survival that most PvP hunters get.
---
Soda is definitely gonna get popped if I see him :)
---
Spellbook drops for upgrading spells...the NOSTALGIA!! WTB Classic ASAP
---
From what I understood, people weren't happy with MK11 not because there was a lot of grinding involved, but because it was only such a grind in order to push microtransactions more.
---
The classic was rly good. The bfa was not accurate.  It’s either mount past each other or the rogue would go in for a kill just to have someone phase. Or an army of the opposite of the opposing faction would phase as you come up to the world quest. 
---
You had me in the first half though, not gonna lie.
---
Hes not that wrong tho, a 2tb hdd is 50-60€ and a 2tb SSD is 210-240€ so a bit more than 4x the price, ssds are still a lot more expensive per gb
---
T2 is godly PVP gear for Paladin.  The only thing that beats it is t2.5
---
He’s going off Vanilla memories, not private server stuff. We’ve come a long way since the vanilla days with warrior dps. It certainly wasn’t normal to see fury warrior do big dps early on in Vanilla.
---
I mean, if you camp anyone expect to have backlash. 
---
If you honestly think a horde person can blacklist alliance players for ganking them then idk what to tel you. 
---
What kind of alliance players will blacklist their own kind for killing horde? No one.
---
A lot of stuff on pservers is wrong so the idea that they've shown us what is and isn't optimal/viable is a bit of a joke.
---
Suboptimal and not viable get thrown around like they are the same thing and they are not. 
---
The big glaring issue with vanilla is in a lot of cases classes really only have one or two viable specs. Anything other than that is just miles and miles below the normal “standard” that it doesn’t matter how much effort you put in - it’s just stupid imo. 
---
If we were talking 15-25% dps differences that’s one thing.  But what we are really talking is 75-100% sometimes even more in damage differences. That’s being carried no matter how you look at it. 
---
Time is money - and the game already sucks enough time from you as it is. 
---
Trust me I’m all for having someone have a good time. And if the content is on farm and we are just deleting bosses in under a minute wtf do I care if someone wants to go balance Druid or ret paladin?  Like that’s fine. 
---
But when raids are taking significantly longer (sometimes not even doable during progression) because I got 10 dudes all wanting to play meme specs then no fucking way. 
---
I’ll wager Onyxia and MC can be done with a pretty retard friendly group. BWL has some niche fights that require some more optimization but can still probably be done with a handful of meme specs - but after that AQ/Naxx...yeah no. 
---
You’re hurting the raid as a whole because you want to play a spec that you KNOW is far below what you could provide in something else. 
---
I don’t get what is so hard to grasp about some people not wanting to deal with it. 
---
If you want to play balance Druid or something that’s fine. Play it!  Join a guild that will take you and have a great time!  But don’t get upset when some guilds tell you no. 
---
That’s all I’m saying.
---
Feral Druid DPS in PvE is certainly on the list.
---
I tried leveling using warmode in BFA.  I had to turn it off because there was no one in my shard either alliance or horde.  So empty.
---
Last time I tried level in vanilla wow I stopped leveling for a week in STV as I did nothing but gank and be ganked. Epic fights all around. 2 v 1s, 5 v2s, 1 on 1 against a pally who pulled out all the stop, just non stop fun.
---
He suggested creating a server where it was a known rule that you don't streamsnipe so streamers can play the game like normal human beings and that the community would enforce it by blacklisting streamsnipers. There's a big fucking difference, and it was just a fucking idea he had while stuck in server offline..
---
It's not hard to understand.
---
Even if it's easy that doesn't mean you are wanted versus someone else playing something more desirable. The bar isn't the boss. It's the other person competing for your raid spot.
---
If soda's on my server and any Alliance post a screenshot of his body, I will add them to a whitelist and never engage them in PVP ever. And I'll post any Horde exclusive stuff they want on the cross-faction AH with no markup.
---
If by chance I get on this guy’s realm, I will make and gear a rogue just to stream snipe him
---
Well... It was mostly burnable. Someone should really have seen it coming.
---
and most of those mechanics are made pointless because of massive aoe healing, and every class having mobility/defensive/self healing cooldowns.
---
There's a checkbox below the submit link button
---
its sounds so dishonest doesn't it
---
Seeing a feral Druid per raid isn't uncommon anymore - maybe even 2
---
Ooooooh he is gonna feel the full extent of the Barbara Streisand effect.
---
It isnt about life it's about numbers. No one has ever gone faster in vanilla than like 4 1/2 days in game time. That wasnt just no lifeing either that was practiced and planned leveling. 
---
If 40 people on the same serger willing to work in a raid together all hit 60 in that time you still have to account that they need at the very minimum 6 hours of sleep for the slowest person in that group. Nevermind that that leaves no time for farming or doing professions that an underdeveloped under farmed group would need to clear a raid. 
---
If the slowest person only needs 6 hours of sleep that means exactly 6 days after release everyone is 60. If you cut out the last couple levels you might have people clearing it the first week of release but that would be the absolute fastest people could do it. 
---
I imagine its gonna be the Wednesday the week after release at the earliest all raid content in phase 1 is cleared unless everyone is account sharing.
---
I really think people have forgotten just how long leveling takes in vanilla.
---
So salty.
---
I find him entertaining and I'm not the equivalent of a herd animal...
---
Boomkin in the Mages
---
Its true. My guess is MC is cleared within 10 days
---
Yeah, I don't believe you mate
---
What's bound to stances?
---
I used ESDF instead of WASD and bound stances to Q,W, and R
---
Alchemy. As a Druid you can gather herbs in travel form and having potions will be really beneficial. It also just fits the whole aesthetic for druids. Have fun with being a boomkin. So ducking silly and fun, just wish they wouldn’t oom so fast. Good In pvp, annoying that people want you to heal all the time.
---
Yes I am aware that has a vanilla player myself. The issue is not that it wasn't anything but that to press a button once and have it complete the action is very different
---
But my rage! The streamers get play and I don't!
---
Be one of the rich guys on my server.
---
yup, People seem to think that hybrid dps classes are just a bit worse. They are not. They are way worse. They simply cant pull their own weight in Naxx. Can you take them with you? Sure, you can. If you are willing (and able) to carry them. Some people dont want that.
---
The second spec looks very close to the leveling spec that I found! You're making me want to just roll Druid straight-up, lol. 
---
What's the PvE side of this? Can you go feral and find a group? I'd like to think I'm an above average raider in any of the live xpacs, but not sure if vanilla gives any wiggle room for less optimal specs to perform decently, no matter your skill level. Would I just end up speccing resto or a resto hybrid to get into raids while still being able to PvP?
---
Leveling to 60 alone takes 120 hours for Joana, so probably 200-250 hours for the average person.  Longer if you’re trying to do every quest.
---
Collecting every mount required a Wintersaber (300-400 hours), and ZG mounts, which are rare and have 20 people rolling, Baron Rivendare’s mount, which is a 0.2% drop.  That’s over 1000 hours just for mounts, if you’re lucky.  Not to mention you have to farm the gold for each faction mount and the rep.  That’s over 10,000 gold, so that’s easily over 1000 hours.  Oh, and getting the Scarab Lord mount takes the support of your entire guild as well as close to a thousand hours of farming in Silithus, a hotbed for world PvP.  So getting every mount would take multiple thousands of hours, probably 5000 hours I would say, maybe less if you are lucky.
---
Clearing Naxx will require a year of profession or more for most guilds and tons of consumables, amounting to over 1,000 hours of raiding for just that.  Realistically between farming consumables for raids and gearing / enchanting a character who is good enough to be in a guild who can kill Kel’Thuzad is a 3000-5000 hour time commitment. M
---
GM probably takes 16 hours a day for 7 days a week for at least 2 out of the 4 months.  The first ranks take probably 2 months of pvping for at least 10-15 hours week.  You can do the math on that one.
---
Doing every quest takes who knows how long.  I won’t even try to estimate because I honestly don’t know.
---
There is no possible way you can do what you described in 1000 hours no matter how tryhard and no matter how much help you have.
---
My rogue had about 300 days /played at the end of TBC, about 150-200 of that was in Vanilla.  Didn’t clear Naxx, didn’t get GM, got a few cool mounts (Wintersaber) and got exalted with a bunch of factions.  I accomplished a ton and was regarded as one of most geared and grinding fanatic (not skilled, lol) rogues on a server which had multiple world firsts (Drama killing Nefarian and Death and Taxes killing Ouro first, 4 HM first, and CThun second or third)
---
Vanilla takes a LOT of time, luck, and relationship building.  If you plan to accomplish all this, it isn’t impossible.  Roll Human for the rep gains 😂
---
Nice, I remember that guild, you guys were really active in the RP scene. I used to RP a priestess with the Cathedral. I forget that guild's name, but we frequently interacted with the Guard. Is there still a lot of RP on Moon Guard today?
---
Gonna just post this here again but wow classic is gonna be easy. Technology was different back then, in 2004 there wasn’t step by step video guides for everything and there wasn’t these super popular sites that cover top builds and talent choices as well as what buttons to hit to be successful. I didn’t raid during the time I played vanilla, but even in 2007 or 2008 when raiding in the burning crusade when it was considered “hard” it was trial and error, a lot of dying and trying to figure out strategies, people drawing maps in paint and trying to say this is where the Dps stand, this is where you go during this phase, etc. by Woltlk things like dbm were standard and would call out boss attack’s and tell you to move and do all sorts of stuff that makes raiding easier so to counter it blizzard has had to make raiding a lot harder mechanically than anything that existed in the early game. Anyone who can raid normal mode raids in retail can do any of the content in vanilla, it wasn’t harder, it wasn’t tuned tighter, all I’ve ever actually heard from friends who raided up through naxx in vanilla was that with a decent raid lead and half your party auto attacking you would clear the content if people just didn’t die to dumb things. Classic and burning crusade get glorified as these like insane periods of difficulty and it was just lack of information. When I did swp it felt so damn impossibly tuned at times but looking back on it after doing hardmode raids in wrath and cata the content in tbc was brain dead easy. I’m so excited to relive vanilla but it’s not gonna be hard.
---
You'd never get all that done in 200 days played in game if we're talking truly "beating the game" with everything.
---
/r/thatHappened
---
I posted recently how I would love to gank these guys and got a ton of support and hate. I want to avoid their servers as much as possible to avoid their impact. However, if by chance I do end up on their server I will dedicate a lot of time to ganking these guys.
---
 I will try to avoid them, I am saying this again because I got called out on saying I want to avoid them but will do the opposite and hunt them down. Most of them are apparently keeping their realms secret so we do not have a choice to avoid them.
---
You see the difference with BFA where an epic doesn't make you even blink an eye.
---
I listened to a lot of moe. during my 150 days /played in BC.. and listening to it now i do feel more relaxed
---
I agree 40 is tough but I used it as a 'slow down and twink out/get your mount' phase. 
---
Run SM ARM + Cath to get all desired drops, and RFD to do the quests and get drops
---
Farm for mount $$
---
Farm a little bit extra if necessary for good gear upgrades
---
It's especially easy as Horde because both instances are very convenient to flight paths.  And there are decent farming spots in Dustwallow, Desolace, or Arathi that are a breeze for level 40 players and drop things that are valuable.
---
Id rather spend 1h30 with friends where we respect each other’s time than 2 hours with people who dont give two shits about each other or the raid. Funny how we can construct scenarios that favors our own view point.
---
Most of us would just pay for two accounts, hell I already do.  People would have 10 accounts and the rest of the population would scream at blizzard for cheating the poor 😂
---
Mining 24/7, playing the AH while leveling slowly and eventually raiding :)
---
That’s just anecdotal “hmm it seems to take longer than pservers” when data and extrapolation shows that pservers take longer. Make no mistake, pservers have experience values exactly correct as well as player damage values. The only variables are mob values, which are harder on pservers.
---
Usually dedicated main tank and offtank.  With another 2 to 4 warriors capable of tanking for trash.  By naxx guilds need 8 warriors capable of tanking for 4 horseman fight.
---
That doesn’t even function like the LFG tool in live. It just looks the chats and everyone using the tool to LIST a group. Literally just an add on version of the LFG channel in classic
---
You should play Hunter, they're the only class that can level [blind](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3AWSIP%2BWednesday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).
---
If he doesn't like it then he can play on a PvE server
---
&gt; It's basic English, folks.
---
I find it funny that grammar nazis and idiots who spell Boy, B O I exist on the same subreddit
---
Z X C
---
I really thought I didn't want to play on the same server as a streamer until I heard Sodapoppin mewling about this. Now I do!
---
Glad you appreciate it.
---
I thought people were saying how great it is that your reputation on the server mattered. Well this is the other edge of that sword. People have more say over your reputation than others.
---
&gt; Why take a spec that could be totally fine as a healer, but they refuse?
---
Cause you already have your healer lineup done?
---
Man it has to be hardware store. Was addicted to the song
---
Contrary to popular belief PvE for Horde is Troll. I was watching a stream with Tipsout deep dive, and, because it’s all about maintaining threat, and very few orcs are tanking with axes (mostly swords are used) the trolls are the winners
---
bitching about streamers makes people sound so jealous
---
Powershifting will also be very easy from now on.
---
Get some engineering goggles IRL!
---
I can only stomach 35 minutes of Asmongold per week and already reached my cap, sorry
---
Druid leveling is second only to Hunter in speed. a 6/10?  /facepalm
---
TBC has a lot of problems and blizzard has also talked about new content.
---
It shows us more than anything else we can compare it to atm so atleast thats something.
---
That doesn't explain why he has individually seen 6 blues and 2 epics in 30 hours though.  I had a 60 mage and 60 rogue in vanilla and never saw an epic BoE in all of my vanilla experience.
---
Preach!
---
Its not and if the theorycrafting is correct and boss armor is much lower than pservers dps is gunna skyrocket and things will die much faster
---
you can hide them, you do realize that?
---
Nonetheless its still pserver
---
You're talking about a streamer who has an audience of at least 4 or 5 times the expected size of any single realm... Now, it is a fact that viewers give stuff for free to streamers (be it gold, gear, mats, etc). 
---
Do you really think none of them will play on the opposite faction?
---
Even if I was to grant you that nobody on the opposite faction will do anything to help him, do you really think none of his streamer friends will roll and lead a guild on said faction? 
---
I don't know how you could think they don't have the influence to do that and much more.
---
Maybe not sure but all phase one content was his comment. Which includes onyxia and marudon as well.
---
This is correct. It really comes down to maintaining threat endgame. More threat faster = more deeps
---
Barb is significantly better, from AQ.  2 less stam, but 41 agi instead of 86 AP.
---
I gotcha. Or you could need on an item and then ransom it to the person who's been waiting for weeks.
---
Nax will def still be a wall for the majority of people. AQ will fall to most guilds who are actually trying I think
---
Revered with the water lords is only for the eternal essence
---
Whoa, I've never heard anything about claws capping at 305. Do you have a reference for that perchance?
---
You can get over the wall from Mulgore into the Southern Barrens now. There are two big problems with doing this however :
---
1. The Alliance on the other side are hostile and many levels above 10.
---
2. If you're a dumbass trying out MoP during a free week and you hop over the wall it's nearly impossible to get back over.
---
The good news is that ~~if~~ when you die it's possible to rez on the safe side of the wall.
---
Go back and watch kill vids from Nihilim or Curse or any top Vanilla guild.  Rogues and Mages on top every fight.
---
Doesnt layering create "virtual" servers, out of one to reduce the number of players at a given spot? If it works like that it sure does help how can u say otherwise?
---
Vanilla is extremely time consuming. Meme specs will be welcome in many guilds until wipe nights become regular (anyone who has been through this on progress will know the mood can drop) or when AQ is open and your guild are raiding 5 times a week and they take 3 hours each when it could be FAR less.
---
Not everyone is a streamer or NEET with unlimited time in bis with full consumes. Most guilds will find classic raiding more of a challenge than people realise.
---
&gt; an acceptable rotation.
---
rightclick you say?
---
Thats a fair idea I could see that the other guy was saying all phase 1 content within a week of release which is what I was replying to.
---
I think you might be on to something about the personality fit.
---
I definitely get off on the resource juggling.
---
I somehow managed to click my way to top raid dps and Gladiator rank in arena.....only had charge bound to 3rd button on my mouse. I plan on upgrading to a gaming mouse but click away! 
---
Once a newborn always a newb.
---
I hope you were ironic when you said this was a completely original idea.
---
But then who do I hate?... oh, myself... well played.
---
Am mage, can confrim: lazy af
---
For pvp, they’re both good and really fun. Better at different things. For pve hunters have pets and traps and weaving shots while mages literally just hit frost bolt over and over and over.... but they got better dps haha. I’m gonna play a hunter for ease, fun in pvp, and some what interesting pve play
---
Just speaking from my anecdotal experience from vanilla, but I knew quite a few cat druids running around in raid groups. I'd say resto was more common for sure. Balance was pretty damn rare.
---
It should be entirely possible to raid as cat dps if you want, but some guilds will shy away from adding more mdps than they have/need. Resto is a solid choice for raid spots.
---
Just remember, aside from being hands down best flag carriers in WSG, druids are a jack of all trades, master of none, regardless of pvp or pve. They can handle dps, cc, healing and tanking well enough, but they don't excel at anything but mobility.
---
I don’t understand this mentality. The only thing wrong on p servers are mainly numbers. And that isn’t even that far off in most cases.
---
Hahaha you’re right. what the hell
---
There are multiple guilds that are planning on a day 7 clear. And they will achieve it. These people have practiced their levelling routes and efficiency for years. They’re much faster than the fastest people in real vanilla. They will reach 60 in 6 days or less, they will farm gear for a good 8-10 hours and then they will clear MC.
---
And its forums [Sunstrider.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20050713075214/http://sunstrider.net/)

---
Why don’t you get to play...?
---
Imagine having banana gear for the looks.
---
*Hello darkness my old friend.*
---
See ya
---
Wow is not a hard game. This applies to both retail as well as vanilla. If you actually think mythic raiding is comparable to something like playing a FPS/MOBA at a high level you are delusional
---
"There is nothing new under the sun"
---
Spell damage Ret was a thing back in the day, iirc. Maybe this time around the builds can be improved or the groups will be more flexible with specs.
---
This one of the things that makes vanilla so cool though. The game gives your class a basic framework and sends you on your way to figure stuff out and experiment. Retail is so rigid you can't even experiment with different weapon types, let alone something like a spellpower melee build.
---
I believe what they use to say is, It isn't griefing if there is a PvP solution to the problem. There is a clear PvP solution to his problem, so no.
---
Hahahaha holy shit I’m screen shotting that. 
---
You think “we’re always open to community feedback” and assume they are talking about new content and not TBC?
---
The votes clearly show which content the community wants already. Stop acting like new content after naxx is a majority opinion.
---
Yes it most likely is, which should show the window is too big but I’ve reported it so we’ll see.
---
Then enjoy your boring ass German realms, lmao.
---
You act as if having a guild with streamer events, drama, civil wars and big PvP scenes are a bad thing, it’s a pretty common thing among many EU posters on this board. It’s like you guys take pride in rolling on servers that are fucking barren wastelands LOL.
---
LE EPICKK
---
I was never attracted to WoW by the complexity of the raid bosses and challenging mechanics. If you are into that I guess Wrath is the way to go. Although I hear the new one with Jaina is pretty wild.
---
I guess there will be a few guilds on each realm that clear MC within a week or 2 from release... But that won't be the norm. And they can only do it once a week. 40 people sharing limited loot will not give them a massive advantage. Most other guilds will struggle along getting 40 people together and pushing content. 
---
Either way. I am not planning to be a world first guild. Just enjoy the game at a steady pace. Raids will occupy one or 2 nights a week in my play sched. The rest of the time I will enjoy all the stuff I have missed for over a decade. Community, professions, farming items, ganking ETC
---
And that makes me curious about tbc, I still remember it fondly however...
---
Like you said flying and I said shattrath city both seemed negative imo.
---
On the pro side, tbc seemed like it didn't cross the edge of too much homogenization while helping balance classes a bit better
---
Did they all say they're keeping realm choice secret? Really frustrating to hear. My friends and I want don't wanna be on a server with anyone that pulls more than 200 viewers if we could avoid it
---
moonfire ftw
---
I played druid in vanilla and experienced the 2nd side you listed. For feral raiding you might end up bear tanking if you can secure a spot early on in a guild, but resto is more realistic. Since the really great druid healers don't cast anything but various ranks of healing touch you might be able to get away with a hybrid build. If I did it again I'd try very hard to make the hybrid build work because being full time restoration blows.
---
I'm not sure it even does. An exclusive release that's invite only with a careful number of players chosen?
---
get a friendly enough guild you can go with no spec at all.
---
They can't inspect your talents, but everyone and their brother will be running a dps meter,  If your not able to keep up, you may find a different warlock going to the progression raid next time.
---
I had 8/8 for lulz, only wore in IF.
---
yeah no, streamers will be big after release as well. Much as hes not my style at all, Asmongold is/was a big retail wow streamer and was constantly surrounded by fans in game. I can't see Soda being any different in Classic.
---
I hate that teleport. Its literally easier for a leveling horde to get to gnomeregan than an alliance. Doing STV and get a group filled, cool ill just turn in this quest. Alliance get to run back to duskwood, fly south a zone, then north 5 zones, then run half a zone. 
---
And dont get me started on shimmering flats.
---
As someone that’s going to multibox 40 characters, it might be fun to roll on the same server as this guy so I can ruin his life 🤔
---
I always go straight from 39 to 45.  There's a level warp pipe located in the basement of Old IF, but don't tell anyone.
---
Respect!
---
Then you should focus pvp or something , feral won’t see much action in raids , unless your guild likes you very very much

Of course. I’ve filed nearly ~40/50 reports so far. I’m actively testing everything I know about rogue (since that’s really all I play). I want everything to be fixed before launch so there’s no issues when it’s open to the public.
---
The raid content in classic is not harder than the current raid content in retail. The difficulty in Classic stems from the journey to get to 60 and the preparation it takes to get into those raids.

I am talking pvp so Barb has lower dps and lower min-max dmg. And 41 agi is 41 ap (82 rap) compared to 86ap/rap  so you hit way bigger with Ashkandi in melee which is the purpose of a hunter pvp: get a big raptor strike at 40% crit and leave melee.
---
&gt;I’m real interested on what I should look out for.
---
The Nessingwary quest hub is usually a nightmare. Both factions go there, there are no guards, and the quests range from level 30 to 40. That means you will have enemy level 40s at the same quest hub with no guards when you are only level 32.
---
Typically you will approach the quest hub and see that there are 2-3 enemies there. You can then gamble and decide see if they are KoS or you can wait until they leave. If they are KoS then you're basically out of luck until they leave, OR if until enough of your faction show up to overthrow them.
---
The rest of the zone is just like any other contested zone.
---
Absolutely true. Why? SHADOWMELD. 
---
I also level Herb and Alc, which gives me a steady supply of pots/money from AH. Mining is good too, but I wanted to experiment wihh atypical builds and love my flower warrior.
---
DS/Ruin or SM/Ruin work well for PVE environments, but for PVP, I always found going deeper to get conflag was useful for more burst damage. Since sitting there and channeling shadowbolt after shadowbolt left you open for kick/shield bash/counterspell/etc. And would lock you out of basically all your damage. Something around these lines: 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/AjDAAcwEzz0w3Q
---
(2 points can be moved from imp. lash of pain -&gt; intensity or imp. searing pain depending on flavour choice)
---
(People who are playing warlocks currently on private server please feel free to chime in with thoughts, I am pulling from long time ago)
---
With this you are looking at conflag (burst), as well as shadowburn (more burst), 10% chance to daze when casting any destruction spell (immolate, shadowbolt, shadowburn, conflag, soul fire, searing pain) which can help you kite people, as well as some utility from demo tree to boost your survival. Instant cast corruption is nice once your initial seduction is over and you are actively engaging that target. 
---
Immolate is only a 1.5 second cast, followed up by a conflag (instant) is pretty good burst, 10 second cooldown on conflag. Shadowburn is 15 second cooldown and costs a shard if it doesn't execute the target, but shouldn't be ignored for an instant cast spell. 
---
Ruin also boosts the damage of all destruction spells, and there's a bunch, if you fear a target you aren't limited to just shadowbolting someone's face off, searing pain can be useful.
---
You'd be surprised.  They had to do a ton of guess work.  The beta is showing that pservers made some pretty bad mistakes.
---
Not terribly familiar with playing as druid back then but if this wasn't possible in vanilla then it needs to be blocked...
---
Wow, you're a special kind of idiot aren't you?
---
Occasionally clicking objects instead of mobs.
---
You should see YouTube.
---
To be fair, T2 pally gear is the bomb.
---
This 100%.
---
I can respect this because my best gaming friends are all my 2004 wow friends.
---
I agree that the discussions should be had years before the stuff happens, but perhaps a better time is after the launch? Perhaps now our focus should be bugs in the beta?
---
Once the game is launched and we get going we all have a better understanding of what the game is and isnt. Now we just rely on what the streamers show which is never the same thing as truly experiencing things firsthand.

It’s not spellbatching that’s the issue, it’s the window of time in which it exists. I’ve kicked fears and nearly half a second later I still get feared. That shouldn’t be.

Fair point. Though I'd assume a large portion of the people on here didn't actually get into the beta.

&gt;from Private Servers
---
Yes, those would be the same private servers which, until recently, were convinced that the parry chance for lvl 63 (boss mobs) is 5%, when in reality, it turns out it was 14%.
---
But hey, off by almost 200% ... not that bad, amirite? :D

---
Probably not, it's not like we didn't have plenty of time in vanilla to figure out what was and was not viable.
---
I don’t hate you, so it’s not saying much.
---
How can I be reading a bit much into some meaningless words when you just took the link I sent you and used that back at me? Are you really this confused?
---
There are certainly spots for capable dps warriors that will off-tank when needed. Most guilds try to bring along a handful of tanks, depending on the fights they are doing, so being able to OT on the fly is handy for sure, but the key to straddling the line between a primary DPS raider and occasional tank/healer raider can be hard to do. If you excel at dps, suck at tanking, you become a liability. Like to DPS, but suck at dps, and are actually competent at tanking? You'll be pressured to switch to tanking full time, politely or not.
---
I raided ret in a 10 man heroic during WotLK, and just the nature of a 10 man raiding team requires flexibility. So, while I LOVED DPS, I had to tank and heal when necessary for the sake of the raid progression. I struggled with the healing bit starting out and nearly lost my spot raiding with them until I put the work in to make sure I was up to snuff.
---
All that to say, it's a lot of fun to be useful and flexible, but it can also be very demanding.
---
Tanking 5 mans with Tauren is pretty fun.  War stop is decently useful as an interrupt.
---
No problem. Have fun being downvoted into oblivion for your ignorance.

i dont see time wasted here though, love fiddling with specs
---
Not many affect the endgame hardly at all.
---
Of course anything is possible behind the scenes at Blizzard, but as I said in another comment I’d hope they’d tell us about something like that so at least we’re aware.
---
Viable just means it is capable of working. Almost everything is viable. You can run Scarlet Monestary Armory as a group of level 30s even though the final boss is level 40. Groups have done it, it is viable.

Thanks, it’s a mixture of my name (Zach) and Ekans the Pokemon.
---
Can you link to where he said that? I just re-watched the video and nowhere does he say that.
---
If anything, he says that he knows blizzard is not going to create a special streaming server, hence, what they COULD DO is have said horde-alliance blacklist where if one player is a jerk by the streamer's judgement, they will just blacklist him, from both factions, effectively isolating him from the community. 
---
Then he closes it up by saying "let's fucking make a list".
---
I'm pretty sure you definitely need to go to that westfall tower for something with poisons or lockpicking or something
---
It will not take ANYONE??? That's pretty definitive. I imagine it will take a person like yourself 10-15 days, just because of the fact that you are on this subreddit and therefore will likely use manuals and guides. But I'm not going to call you, or anyone else on this subreddit, "average". I specifically used the words "casual player" for that reason and, whether you like or not, casuals will be, by far, the largest player count and that will reflect the averages overall. This is, as I said earlier, my opinion based on playing vanilla wow both at launch and in beta.
---
And yes, it is insane but, that's vanilla wow for you.
---
Haha ok now I’m done. This was a discussion until you thought saying “u mad bro” was a good reply.
---
I’m all for following your dreams, but realistically no one in this thread is going to be playing seriously enough that they can keep up in gear, levels and skill with a former Rank 1 streamer that can dedicate 16 hours a day every day to playing classic lol
---
doesnt work? like its always gibberish and i cant change the listener ever
---
you said all phase 1 which is more than mc
---
also do you have a source on that?
---
since it's so many multiple id love to see it.
---
Also considering that private servers dont have speeds less than 4 day in game time and they are supposedly easier than classic will be and have dynamic spawns I would highly doubt that a group of people over 40 will all be able to achieve those times.
---
k
---
Although there are some “hybrid” pieces that are straight up in the game for those hybrid classes.
---
Some mail shit that is way better for enh shaman and wouldn’t be useful for hunters at all
---
That's probably exactly what is causing it.
---
you can check out this thread I started last week

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bv7qp3/once_servers_names_get_announced_can_we_have_a/
---
Few guys really hated the fact that we want to snipe streamers even though they will impact our game experience.
---
No UI addons, I don’t personally like them. You can move your frame and target frame, which I have centered in my screen.  The swing timer is called Attack Bar, super useful.

Considering that I make enough money to be able to afford all I ever wanted to have in my life while still building up savings en masse, hold 2 MINT degrees, work successfully as a software developer, have a wonderful girlfriend and a loving supporting family, I really don't see why I should be jealous.
---
Because, I get all that without whoring myself out in the persona of an annoying man-child to a bunch of teenagers trying to combat their small egos by projection.
---
It’s actually less then that. For a 7 minute fight (enrage), 26 dps members alone need to do 352.6 dps minimum to kill him just as he enrages. This isn’t even counting any damage the tanks do as well.
---
Hunter is easy to level, what part makes it difficult to level?  Have you actually ever played a hunter in Vanilla?
---
Hey, it's me, your rogue friend.  I'm on the beta, buddy.  What's the method, friendo?
---
full tier 2 warrior set, quel’serrar, and the elementium reinforced bulwark, then i can finally play the game
---
Enhancement is the way to go if you want to level as fast as possible.
---
Maybe this video will help you out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhJ78qfgrK4
---
Tons of good info in there.
---
Boot licker right here. 
---
Keep using mommy and daddy’s card for the streamers :) 
---
You will grow up one day
---
Fair point. Streamer hate is prolly my least favorite thing here (not to be mixed with fair critique), the "what will I play" is just meh and I tend to skip those without thinking.
---
Reason why I kinda dont like the current flood of the what next posts is I like discussing the subject and I feel like the small nuggets that can be found on the threads are all over the place now that those posts are so numerous. (Also too much of a good thing is bad)
---
message the artist :P (i know you want to)
---
&gt; You get the perks of being a streamer, and one of the few things we get out of your perks is the ability to hunt you.
---
Word.
---
I'm aware and it's sad people watch that.
---
Leveling enhance is good.  But max level,  if you want in on raids you will mostly be resto and moved around groups to better utilize your totems.  If you want tp pvp,  then enhance works but you need specific gear to make it fun.  As in getting the damage burst ofwindfury. I love shaman but back in vanlla they just couldnt pump the numbers as well as other classes.  Slihtly better than druid heals just because ofthe revive spell.
---
More of this shit really? It was still just a random suggestion, it's nothing something he's persuading and normal players would obviously be allowed too, there would just be a well known moral code enforced by the players to not streamsnipe holy fuck you are actually so blinded by hate
---
Yeah I’ve never twinned at this bracket but I’ve gotten attention from mages/priests atm. I believe it could also be super useful for druids as well.
---
I loved it, yea
---
Sounds like that guy PreparedWoW on Twitch. He is a multiboxing hurricane.
---
mobs may be easier but there are less of them and drops are different.
---
This is the default Nelf character portrait (it's what you get if you set all the character style properties to index 1.
---
In Vanilla, the game doesn't load a characters style properties, until you are within visual range, therefore, it falls back to defaults until it gets the correct information.
---
world pvp in bfa is actually quite fun.
---
Eh, neither one of them were wrong, honestly. If we're doing things truly vanilla, then the group would decide need before greed *or* need all BoE's before pulling the first group of trash. Generally speaking though, on the server I played on it was practically always need before greed on all drops. If someone rolled need when they shouldn't have, oh boy, they got put on blast.
---
most people never use any sort of search, someone thought there are no wands and what is he gonna do now
---
i googled "classic wow wands"
---
top result is a compiled list of wands and where to get them ordered by level
---
Sure troll is good for tanking. The problem is even out of 'pve warriors' it'd be like 5% that are strictly only ever pve tanking - the vast majority will be interested in dps or pvp at some point, and if that's the case orc will be much better.  
---
Put it this way - many of the top PvE warriors on Alliance are going gnome. That's because they still want to be good at pvp, and even the best pve racial in the game is still only a relatively minor dps increase, whereas having a good racial in pvp is game changing.  
---
So yes, troll is probably best for strictly tanking - but if you care enough about tanking to forgo every other aspect of the game I'd hope you're better researched than asking a question that's been asked and answered every week for the past 6 months on a public forum for advice.
---
Not to mention clearing it once means nothing outside of being a nice accomplishment. You still need to run it for months to gear your guild. Even the fastest guilds won't be done with P1 content until well into the later phases.
---
I mean even ingame I’m checking the AH and less than 30 hours after the patch is launched there were 3 epics on the market. That seems high but who knows
---
Hi, /u/Toxif1
---
I mean sure, but I’ve played classic wow for years on private servers and even when it was on retail, I’d much rather play in the clown fiesta and mess the streamer servers will be versus playing the same old experience that will be around forever for me to play anyway.
---
I guess I’m too young to understand that though thanks for letting me know I need to grow up.
---
Diversity matters. Roll with a Troll.
---
Oh no. He said he will do something. 
---
But what can he do exactly? What kind of power can sodapoppin have across factions?
---
To be fair, if Hearthstone had chat I’m quite sure on a number of games I would have said things to my opponent that would make a snuff film connoisseur blush.  But I blame that more on soul crushing game design.
---
true, but i would say that if over a number of play sessions the same person repeatedly turns up and ganks you within minutes of getting online and continues to camp you, you have a fairly strong suggestion of what's going on. Wouldn't hold up in court lol, i get that, no proof but... yeah.
---
starts at 45-50seconds
---
It is not. It encourages communication about logistics  cooperation. 
---
E.g.: from my personal experince we got one guy coming to SFK and he met gang team on his way. So we had to get and help him to to the instance having some random pvp on the road. Yes, it took longer to start the dungeon, but added nice "world is alive" experience  and honstly i remember this encounter better and more fun than the cleaning instance itself.
---
&gt;People have more say over your reputation than others.
---
You don't want to group with people who listen to e-celebs as if they're prophets in the first place. I think I'll willingly blacklist myself from playing with them. Makes passing all the content easier and more successful.
---
&gt;are mainly numbers
---
And guess what determines a classes viability?
---
I give you a hint: It ain't the color of their tier-sets.
---
Im not really looking for minmaxim or how u guys call it. I just want to level in my own pace and then join a casual raid group where my spot isnt about full dps/ full heal. Hopefully i will achiev that
---
Plus proof is in the pudding.  How does one prove stream sniping was happening?
---
It’s too bad that guy is such a weirdo
---
&gt; What will we do if a month into Classic, all of the Phase 1 endgame raid content is cleared?
---
It probably will be, by top guilds anyway. But most of us won't be in those top guilds, so most of us will need 3+ months just to hit 60 and then another 3+ months to actually clear that content with a guild. And just clearing the content doesn't mean you're done - you'll be fighting against a lot of people for loot, so you're going to need to grind raids and dungeons for multiple months before you get close to BiS status. 
---
And if you're bored, start some alts and redo the process. Or take your geared character into battlegrounds/world pvp.
---
Isn't a sub like $15 per month? You're really paying $600 a month in wow subs?
---
If Blizzard creates such a server, then I wouldn't have a problem with it. That's their business. But I seriously doubt they would.
---
I'm honestly kind of thankful it's 3 months away. I have so much IRL shit to do, that I should (barely) be able to get it all done before settling into the comfortable embrace of ~~death~~ Classic WoW.
---
Tauren will be the best PvP warrior for horde, due to the increased melee range. (Private servers didn’t have that feature).
---
Yeah he's totally going to be able to easily deal with the 12 rogues perma camping him because he's supa skilled lol
---
My contact Just told me that F&amp;F recruits are also Closed. So yeah, doubt we see a Wave soon but who knew.
---
I'd be happy if it just stayed Vanilla forever. I never liked any of the expansions as much as Vanilla content. Sure, it was more to do but it had none of the soul of the original.
---
People who say that everything was theorycrafted to death in '05 haven't been following Feral Druid PvE. The discoveries that have been made since retail vanilla (MCP wasn't really appreciated to its true potential until very recently; like the past year or 2), have been massive gamechangers.
---
Excellent retort to show that your argument was circumstantial at best, have a good one pal.
---
Yeah sorry I didn’t make that clearer. The Dazzling Longsword dropped in an RFD group and they decided to all roll need and he won the roll.
---
It may just be for testing purposes. The game isn't released yet. I'm sure if they make an official change to the game that will for sure be in at release, they'll tell us.
---
Same. I am hoping to find out where they are, so I can avoid them.
---
Fortunately I'm practically forced into druid by my situation so I have a clean break from obsessing over which to play lol
---
During the first couple of months with levelling yes, no life-ers will reign supreme. After 4 months though someone in a decent guild that plays 3 hours a day will have just as good a gear as someone that plays 12 hours a day.
---
I disagree. I do not consider "Gather 10 raptor horns" to be a "grinding session" even if you have to kill 30 raptors to get them. You spend more time running (from quest giver to mob area, from mob to mob, back to the quest giver) than you do actually killing mobs.
---
However there are some areas, like the Quilboar part of Southern Barrens, where there are tons of mobs in a relatively small area and you need to kill 60+ of them to fulfill a few quests. That's good grinding.
---
I follow now. I missed the part about the mats needed to DE and do it. I feel foolish. Which item did you make and DE by chance?
---
It's terrible. I was a warlock main in vanilla. I thought it would be good. I think I made it twice and then never again.
---
As you, recently.
---
Ammo Pouch/Quiver was a pserver bug though apparently in the vanilla code it does not increase wand speed.
---
The game has never been extremely hard. The main danger comes from not paying attention to what you are doing.
---
Yeah I’m sure a top mage would like it. I was going to sell it to Ziqo for a bit of a discount since he’s fun to duel with but I don’t know if he’s got enough yet.
---
Atieshhh
---
*Splooge face*
---
Except it isn't.
---
You’re right if a boss has 5 less nature protection than private servers balance druids are viable!
---
Honestly the big thing is the mods need to do more to tear down the anti streamer neck beards. I don't even always think they are wrong but, they normally are but, the constant unending stream of wahhh streamer privilege is getting real fucking old.
---
I wont lie, I dont play on PvP servers but I might roll on one if this is a thing, sounds fun!
---
This is not to say that you guys are all wrong to be mad but rather an alternative perspective.
---
These guys are entertainers and they are not meant to be taken seriously. Most of the things they say its for the sake of engaging with their viewers and making content. This is their work, they are showmen and they constantly alter their characters based on the viewers' demands. Blizzard rarely takes them seriously (except in occasions where they provide legit feedback and these often happen off-stream) and will never implement such a system. Soda has been around long enough to know that. You also should know that. 
---
You might say that you hate them having streamer privileges (beta access). Put yourself in the shoes of Blizzard. This is easy, free marketing and in the end, it will strengthen the community, which will drive Blizzard to invest more in the game. Trust me; what Soda said will be forgotten in two days, but the exposure and hype that he created for the game will help us in the long run.
---
And if you are still not convinced and somehow believe that these guys are hurting the community acting the way they do, I don't think it makes sense giving them additional exposure by creating posts like this. Just ignore their channel and be excited for the game, rather than being mad for a demand that will never be taken seriously.
---
Is stream sniping essentially just ganking a streamer? They really want a server where they're above being ganked? That removes an enormous part of the game.
---
And my tell back “vendor trash”
---
What tailoring item did you make and DE?
---
I remember my first level 40 mount. Chestnut Mare. It broke the bank but it was worth it.
---
That's a fair compromise. 
---
Just seems strange to talk about it before most people have played the actual game is released, even if I understand why people are keen to discuss it.
---
Yup
---
That your wrong about the world record, and that 4 days played will be considered "pretty damn fast" which is what OP asked.
---
Has this been tested on the Classic Beta? Or was this just a private server thing?
---
Also do you think this justifies the priest taking the cloak? This is what the world chat was arguing about.
---
This is how WoW worked back in the day. Every race male and female have default portraits until you actually see that person in game then it will switch,
---
well yeah no dw and no flametongue and instacast lightning bolt mechanic yet
---
Entitled little bitch wants to have his cake and then eat it too. Play on a PvE realm. Don't stream. Show an ounce of capability for responsibility.
---
Streamers are the new chinese gold farmers of vanilla wow.
---
Classicwow.live has a section which is basically a dating site for people looking for a duo level partner. You should check it out.
---
Heh. Solid evidence there Mr. Bandwagon blindhate
---
That's because we might hurt someone's feelings
---
&gt;You're talking about a streamer who has an audience of at least 4 or 5 times the expected size of any single realm... Now, it is a fact that viewers give stuff for free to streamers (be it gold, gear, mats, etc).  
---
&gt;Do you really think none of them will play on the opposite faction?  
---
&gt;Even if I was to grant you that nobody on the opposite faction will do anything to help him, do you really think none of his streamer friends will roll and lead a guild on said faction?  
---
&gt;I don't know how you could think they don't have the influence to do that and much more.
---
Quote to my post directly above, since you didn't read it as well as you didn't watch the video.
---
I’m probably just looking for raw gold since this item is probably one of the better things that could drop. But I could use your tailoring and pay you for some mageweave boots if you want to PM me ingame.
---
I am 100 percent sure I used a summoning stone at Onyxia before TBC
---
&gt; The second spec looks very close to the leveling spec that I found! You're making me want to just roll Druid straight-up, lol.
---
DO IT! Seriously druid is a blast.
---
As feral you are still able to find groups, I healed for a very long time as feral in 5-mans and raids.
---
Vanilla unless you are in naxx-40 gives wiggle room for specs, there were quite a few whacky specs out there, the major stumbling blocks were usually gear issues. (Resist gear for some fights SUCKED)
---
Also remember people can't inspect your talents so how are they going to know what spec you are? Hell when I was playing on [Redacted private server name] over 2 years ago, I was raiding BWL as the flag carry spec, as we were on the pvp grind, and I was tired of blowing 25g every night after raid to drop into WSG. Sure I wasn't crushing meters, but then again I was bottom of the druid food chain for gear, (3 raiding druids including me, I was #3 as I was hybrid)
---
Today's game has very little wiggle room for a lot of things in super high end raids, everything has been optimized to hell, because it has to be. Information is everywhere, addons alert you to everything that is going on, back then we didn't have the information share we have now. Mostly just tanks have issues with going "janky" specs, because of how much damage they take, and how much threat is an issue. Healers, your potency comes from how much wak-a-mole you can play, as well as your mana bar. Mana potions are 2 minute cooldown, even during combat, so you can chain pot, innervate is a godsend, but usually is reserved for priests... jerks taking my cooldown for themselves..., and your mp5. (Get mindtap talisman x2 and you're laughing)
---
AQ40 and beyond, the wiggle room for things gets smaller, (sidenote: did heal as feral in naxx 40 for a while, only saph did I have to swap to a "REAL" heal spec groan)
---
To be honest, just talk to your guild when you find one, let them know you're a hybrid druid feral/resto, most guilds WANT some kind of feral druid around. There's so many trash pulls that get significantly easier with a feral druid around (less you have 3+ warriors with thunder fury). Also decent offtanks for quite a few fights. And like I said, how is anyone going to know your spec? The only things you lose by not going super deep resto, is swiftmend and nature's swiftness.

Sidenote: hot stacking SHOULD be in the game for the patch we will get but even then, unless you have crazy high +Heal Power, hots are going to be worthless for you. They are super expensive mana wise, and only are viable, for someone with high heal power to offset the mana cost. Most druids are going to be whacking the heal touch rank 4 all day. (While bouncing around cleansing people of curses/poisons, b-rezzing and the like)
---
Not weird since a few classes can only DPS
---
Moreover, in raids, you need far more DPS players than tanks and even healers
---
This is partly why I was disappointed that they just went with 1.12 for everything. I understand the practical reasons behind this and actually think it was a smart move given what they want out of this project. But this is one of the consequences--a lot of early content trivialized because the game will not be tuned around early content, but rather based on later content that straight up trivialized much of what came before.
---
That said, I think we're jumping the gun on the doomy doom talk. Okay, leveling is easier than we remember. That's a downer. But it doesn't destroy the entire game, and it's still not as faceroll easy as modern dungeons were (at least as of WoD when I stopped playing).
---
I think it's a bit early to discuss "what if it's too easy". Watching a bunch of people level capped but still accumulating gear and overgearing content isn't a precise indicator that there's a real problem just yet. Remember that by 1.12 a lot of the game was easier due to cumulative changes to classes and other mechanics. At some point, though, I would like it if they were given the resources to recreate a little more patch progression with some select tuning changes so each content bucket feels "relevant".
---
I never played any of the 3 warcraft games so I'm trying to get through those.
---
TIL half of this sub will play on the main streamer server
---
Server reputation is a thing. If you're on a server with a population that happens to not like it if you stream snipe and it ruins your reputation, then so be it. Part of the meta
---
I will probably receive a lot of backlash or negativity for this but my opinion:
---
I’ve personally always frowned upon stream sniping. They do make a living off gaming, but that’s because people enjoy their entertainment and influence. A lot of sodapoppins influence kind of helped the resurgence of classic wow. I remember doing his first project 60, was pretty fun. It was nice to join a community.
---
Bc streamsniping is legit targeting and grieving a players gameplay I think there should be a form of consequence for that type of behavior. They, the streamers, provide a lot of fun to their community, so why be so hateful? I’m not saying you can’t gank them or camp them if you see them in the world: and that’s where it becomes tricky. You can’t really tell if a person is stream sniping or actually hunted you down. 
---
With that I don’t think there is anything wrong with trying to find a way to prevent this: maybe streamer modes for people where the minimap is distorted or map layouts become distorted when hotkeyed. It’s obnoxious to see stream snipers in games like pubg, and same with wow imo. A blacklist seems too far fetched and too “he said she said” to be able to implement.
---
If you want to stream snipe I guess that’s your prerogative but it’s kind of scummy to be that person. In reality you’re only doing it because you seem insecure and distraught that they are better entertainers and gamers than you so... you have to snipe? 
---
However, I think it’ll play out with : fanboys helping the streamer and 20 or 30 neckbeards playing 24/7 going to war while the streamer just dips and minds his own business. Could make for good gameplay and fun times.
---
I will probably be playing on a German server for classic. I’ll be working in Wiesbaden for a couple of years.
---
Horde! 
---
Yes i know Malevolence was Alliance eheh :)
---
As a social-diplomat officer i came to know many people in many guild.  I was there at the server birth!
---
He's not suggesting blizzard to create the server, he's suggesting the community would.
---
"I'll post a pic on the forums"
---
Ughhhh, nostalgia rush!  I'm not going to use imgur or anything to show off screenshots in Classic, it's all going to be Blizzard or guild forum posts.
---
Whys it gotta be a BlackList? CmonBruh
---
Maraudon is a leveling dungeon and onyxia is just one boss. It will all be cleared in the first 10 days guaranteed.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Extracting_interface_files

You know it's really easy to be able to play like anyone else, don't tell you are a streamer and don't stream your play on that character.
---
Multiboxing is complete aids
---
18hrs play, 6hrs sleep?
---
Are you breaking up that 18hrs at all for like moving or eating or showering?
---
What Soda doesn't realize is he has no power, people would rather Blacklist him than blacklist people who gank him.
---
Yeah this sub is super cringe. Its even worse than the main WoW subreddit.
---
I'd say human technically has better leveling as they get the faction bonus which can impact the rate they get certain faction items but it's not a direct impact.
---
Hi, /u/Xeyu89
---
When i see this what comes to my mind first is : use macro modifier ... damn...
---
Ok thank you for the explanation, I’m new to hunter played one till 43 on ND for the first time ever and enjoyed it a lot. Will be rolling one in classic and want to know the ins and outs.
---
So what?
---
Does it have any impact on my game if some nolifers somewhere in the world rush through everything in week one?
---
Numbers are clearly important if you're deciding on the opimality or viability of any given spec.
---
The problem with arena was what it did to the rest of the game. It was when PvP went from a relatively well-balanced^1 macro-level affair (wherein the smallest organized conflict was still 10v10, meaning you were virtually guaranteed to have plenty of role overlap within your party) to a tightly-tuned micro-level esport that threw into stark contrast the shortcomings of the rock-paper-scissors design of vanilla class balance.
---
I'm gonna' quote u/JuanLob0 here (again) 'cause he [summed it up ] (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a7ctcf/survey_what_would_you_like_classic_to_be_and_to/ec2h4yn/) pretty neatly several months back:
---
&gt; On the one hand, arena is one of my absolute FAVORITE past times in WoW.
---
&gt; On the other hand, I think we can really trace the complete erosion of class identities to balance changes forced onto Blizzard by how much fun arena was / is. Arena is what ultimately required Blizz to give just about everyone an interrupt and hard CC, and for balance purposes blizz had to bar many classes absolutely iconic abilities (like bloodlust or warlock infernal).
---
&gt; Finally, and the absolute worst, arena really forced blizz to stop making weapons/trinkets with really fun effects and had to limit just about everything to flat, predictable, and homogenous stat boosts. RIP Thrash Blade and its ilk, RIP windfury, RIP RPG.
---
^1 ^I ^stress ^*relatively* ^here. ^It ^really ^wasn't ^well ^balanced ^at ^all, ^but ^the ^scale ^of ^the ^action ^in ^BGs ^helped ^smooth ^over ^the ^glaring ^holes ^on ^which ^the ^arena ^shone ^a ^spotlight.
---
I have SS on E now, but thinking of moving it to mouse. I can’t hit it while strafing right
---
It is tons of fun.
---
Yeah that isn't really true.
---
RP-PVP is gonna be your best chance.
---
Mage and warlock endgame are all about 2 things:
---
- Vending Machine
---
- Whacking 1 button for dps
---
(Sadly, the truth)
---
Warlock you mash shadowbolt all day as SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin, and mage you are whacking frost bolt ove rand over again.
---
"Why don't you just play on a PvE server?"
---
"Fuck that."
---
If you don't like the solution, don't create a worse one. If streamers that are worried about getting constantly sniped don't play on PvE servers then they should anticipate the consequences.
---
He's allowed to "blacklist" if he wants, a lot of people were known in a bad light back in Vanilla/TBC by word of mouth - within their own faction. That's a dirty way to play the game, using your streamer influence to tell THE OTHER FACTION ON A PVP SERVER TO BLACKLIST PLAYERS FOR PVP! Good luck with that, buddy. 
---
Soda needs to watch Sonii's video about this topic: https://youtu.be/kGdYWsHQ3yE
---
There's no bonus seals, no free weekly chest, you can't get fully geared in one day after hitting max level. There resides the beauty and "difficulty" of Classic. There's gonna be 6-7 mages and 6-7 wars and 6-7 rogue's to gear up per guild. Getting your whole guild fully decked in BiS will take quite a while, even if you clear MC during the first week (which definitely is happening).
---
Cartoonish graphic is why we play it. You fill the rest with your imagination - hence the immersion factor. Make it super shiny, super animated and people would drift off.
---
Not all is gold that glitters.
---
That's why you make 2 toons. One to play with your friends and one to level when they aren't around. Assuming you aren't trying to race to 60 that is
---
It's not going to be easier to farm Classic gold in Retail. Whatever the gold-per-hour is in each game will dictate the exchange rate.
---
What evidence would you like? This conversation hasn’t come up to my turn of providing any.
---
I play wow on the lowest setting a can. A selling point for me actually is that i can make it run on my laptop. I don’t care about graphics too much though. 
---
But my boyfriend won’t play WoW because he plays ESO and hates the graphics of wow compared to ESO. 
---
I think they story and mass amount of content and community and everything else is what sells it more.
---
I’m pretty aids myself

So... you want to form a hate group that exists to prove a null point and grief people while they do their job?
---
Don’t you like... have something better to do?
---
I guess we shall see in 6 months. Then my estimate will become fact or fiction.

But even playing on a PS, which is definitely NOT authentic, it took 12 days to get to level 55.

Thanks bro I didn't even know that was a sub. Fuck yea. I'm in there.

I knew he was an entitled prick all along. He felt entitled to Lea (even though she is very much annoying herself) and now he feels entitled to dictate who enjoys what.
---
In short: Cry more, bitch.
---
They aren’t getting any more special treatment any other Guild Master on the server would get, I don’t mean to insult your intelligence but I made that pretty clear in my post.
---
I played on Dragonmaw in vanilla too! Can't say I remember your name though.
---
Wow that's even more encouraging
---
It's a turn of phrase....
---
I totally understand that, but i dont think all guilds/groups will invite only based on the bigger numbers. Then we will all create rogues mages priests and warriors. Im not that hardcore guy who wants to have pre bis in one week and clear naxx as fast as possible. I was just wondering if the community will accept a few meme specs like feral, enhancement, retribution
---
ty
---
Furthering that thought, I think it’s critical for anyone playing a dagger rogue to bind backstab to a mouse button. Only way your movement is not hindered at all
---
I think gibberish *is* the tl;dr
---
You'll still be doing different quests, maybe even different zones
---
Yikes, the cognitive dissonance in this one.
---
No I’m not trying to turn a profit or anything lol. I mostly just want to be able to run the early raids solo and make it easier to get scarab lord.
---
There's a ele enhancement hybrid spec (use 1hand weapon flametongue) for good leveling, needs you to learn to kite between swing timers.
---
In endgame you play resto in PvE, ele/resto in pvp.
---
But will it be effective? I bet epl/ wpl have spots like this.
---
Ah, the /new experience. Here, let me recreate it for you:

should i play hunter or gnome?

how streamers will cause a rise in infant mortality

what class should i play?

what professions should i have?
---
is night elf priest playable at all?
---
lol asmongold died, look at this vod
---
16mm film reel of 2004 tree
---
is anyone else excited for classic?
---
WOTLK enhancement was awesome all the way through. Definitely the most fun I've had with the shaman class.
---
:( i dont really like ele :(
---
The flaw in this argument, is the misguided belief that somehow, people will acquire thousands of gold in Vanilla in a very short time, and be willing to trade it for retail gold.
---
This ain't happening.
---
Acquiring gold in Vanilla takes a much much much longer time than in Retail. No one in his right mind will invest a huge amount of time in classic, just to give it away for retail gold, when he could, with the same time investment, farm the gold directly on retail.
---
Echoing this.
---
Druids are a giant pain until 10 because your mana pool SUCKS, then you get bearform and your downtime decreases to minimal levels, then you hit 20 and get catform. Once you get catform you get 15% move speed while in cat (1st point in Feline Swiftness, 30% at second point which is 21). Between heals and having rogue energy you'll be blasting through the levels. Add in stealth and you can go anywhere you want.
---
So he should play on a PvE realm and not on a PvP realm so that it's harder to be sniped?
---
Retail is not open world MMORPG anymore as many remember it - it is MOBA and this is to attract fans of instant gratification. You can't mix these two. Either one will quit.
---
No, stream sniping is using someone elses stream to track them down in-game.
---
Damn I was 13 and I already had a ton of online friends hahah....but I guess that's just as the top comment said...people dont really talk in online games anymore unless its in a guild or you're playing one of the best.
---
I’m literally debating the same thing right now. Love both classes and created each on a private server to try and figure out which I wanna roll on launch. 
---
So far my wins for Druid are easy access to dungeons, can easily tank, dps, or heal. Good for group questing, and solo questing. Cat form allows you to stealth if your caught by yourself in some unfortunate world PvP situations. Travel form at 30. And also skinning and leather, my working fit the class. 
---
For warlock, you got solid dps. Easy solo- lvling with your own tank, mana tap, and drain life combos. Plus it’s super fun to pull mass groups and throw up your dots and fear. Warlock also gets a free mount at 40 so you can save some gold and then end game your also not stuck being forced into healing. My first max-lvl character was a paladin so I spent a lot of time healing and it will always hold a special place for me, but being a raid healer is more stressful than dps, where you are only responsible for yourself. 
---
I also have a group of friends who wanna lvl together and one wants to heal and one wants to tank so warlock seems like a shoe in, however I know both of those friends may not be committed to hitting 60 so playing a Druid and having that ability to be a jack of al trades while lvling maybe worth it.
---
How does your fury warrior carrying around a set of tank gear kill your main tank? They're there to fill in on fights like Garr and Sulfuron Harbinger. I don't understand your comment.
---
First off why so much hate on "streamers" and why you assume they are idols to me?
---
Not sure how Parry chance matters in a raid DPS since you are attacking from behind but same argument may be made for spell based differences that we are not aware of. 
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Ranking/Default.aspx
---
Select different classes in drop down.
---
Now you have a single anecdote on your side. You were best DPS in your guild and I agree it may be true but in general an average player will perform as the graphs showed.
---
Interesting tactic. Instead of providing anything useful to a conversation go off on a tangent with a personal insult.
---
This is the funniest thing ever posted on this sub. Hands down. 
---
It’s also funny how many people are still crying about not getting into the beta... relax guys clearly WoW isn’t going anywhere. Maybe you can get into the next classic beta after they re-release everything again-again.
---
Fury warriors who don't have a tank set are called lazy.
---
There's a quote that I think relates well to this post. Something about Sherlock Holmes and defecation, but I can't remember it exactly.
---
This should be a fun and interesting discussion with no flaming.  *grabs popcorn*
---
You're doing something \*really\* wrong if you have to heal your ass off fighting a mob while it slowly dies to your ret aura.
---
fun if you are the faction in the raid group the 1 guy from the opposing faction just got phased into out of nowhere
---
Oddly enough, I was born there back when Lindsey Air Station was still a thing.
---
If you're prot specced you're considered a main tank. Most raids have 2.
---
" **makes it less intimidating to keybind**  "

Cons: Duo hunter is very unattractive in the world pve

Duo mage would be equally fun and always get you group invites
---
I really want to win the STV fishing tournament.
---
Good post.
---
Yeah I agree with you on most parts. I really don’t like how arena shaped the way PvP is today. But when you’re talking about TBC arena was still fun, and most classes had vast different toolkits (Tbc only differs abit from Classic in terms of PvP) No added interupts nor selfhealing that I can think of right now. Comps like mage rogue was alot of fun to play, you could 100-0 teams in full CC’s if you played right. That kind of inbalance was fun imo. 
---
Yes it may have ruined ”the rest of the game” but here we’re talking about TBC and bringing it back how it was back then?
---
TL;DR - "Classic’s economy will be quite different from Vanilla’s"
---
The gold still has to be farmed. The gold will still be spent. It will still go into the economy regardless of which person is spending it.
---
I get the point that you're trying to make, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't make a difference. People were buying gold in vanilla which is, essentially, the same thing.
---
It may give people a slight advantage due to not having to farm the gold, or have a mount sooner, or XYZ sooner, but in the end it's no different than buying gold in vanilla.
---
The economy will be volatile at the start and balance out as time goes on. Just as it does with any other server.
---
Instacast lb is dumb really. Kills the vibe
---
Brother, it did not take that long on pservers or vanilla. 12 days I can buy to 60, but that's still pretty slow. I leveled my warrior in much less.
---
Anyone who spends 720 hours getting to 60 is barely playing, he has hundreds of hours of afk time. You would have to go out of your way to make it take that long. That is like "world record for slowest leveling" stuff.
---
The problem is, they couldn't do that.  They couldn't do that before WoW Classic, and they definitely can't do that after.
---
You see, Blizzard  has created what is essentially a different game.  WoW is now an Action game.  It's lost the RP and it's lost the MMO.  There are so many things that push towards this accessible game with hardmodes for the hardcore, that they can't go back and make it like the game it was.
---
If they change it to be more of an MMORPG again, then the people who like the way it is now will leave.  ***The players who liked the game the way it used to be might not come back.***  This is the opinion that I had a few years ago, before the Nostalrius drama.  There is no way to come back from WOD and Legion to get back to Vanilla.  That ship has sailed.  Now with Classic coming out, those who like Classic definitely won't leave for 9.0.
---
Oh wow! Thank you!
---
About 100 million people have played WoW since it came out. The sweatiest nerdiest 1 million of those of those are going to come back for Classic. The sweatiest nerdiest 1,000 of those will make hardcore guilds to race to 60.   
---
The absolute sweatiest and nerdiest 100 of those will easily play 18hr/day for the first week. They will easily hit 60 in under 5 days on every class. They will easily clear MC within 7 days.  
---
You bet on common sense and decency, I'll bet on the 1 in 1 million 30 year old neckbeards everytime.
---
&gt;A lot of sodapoppins influence kind of helped the resurgence of classic wow.
---
Streamers did nothing to build the classic wow movement. That shit has been grassroots for years before they hoped on to profit from the hype.
---
On privates you had 2-3000people in a zone at launch, you group up with people of 5 to go outside and farm lvl 4-7 mobs or go get flightpoints (explore experience), level some fishing for a day etc until it cools down.
---
You can do what you want to do, simple as that.
---
that's dope, wish i would still have any screenshots from when i started playing
---
parryhaste??
---
Besides on horde they are there for every boss fight that has fear aswell
---
Mained enha and survival hunter back then
---
I'd also like to know the method, buddy! rogue on the beta.
---
4 months into classic you think it’ll be simple to camp someone who’ll have full BIS pve and pvp gear? Even if somehow you managed to get the same level of gear playing 3 hours a week (you won’t), you still have to realise most of them are better players than you, especially at pvp
---
ITT: Yeah thats neat but here are my keybinds and why i think its superior.
---
I still only use like1-6 and clicker everything else  :) probably why i have RSI pain in my hands now
---
The guy has a commie shirt. Nothing he says will ever be of value.
---
I'm looking forward to killing alliance.
---
Yes i do agree totally that that's a very usual occasion haha! Exactly my experience that prompted me to make this video is constantly passing by horde on my mount and see how they act like I don't exist, so I kind of got the idea and now I do it too. It's crazy to me! But I thought this was a good way to represent it, from my view :D
---
The stuff of nightmares
---
possibly unpopular opinion:
---
I want Guild Banks in classic.
---
also, wildly unpopular opinion: 
---
Im not against small balance changes
---
It still works this way in bfa actually. The portraits just look a bit less mentally handicapped.
---
finally! moonkin now viable again!
---
I never did that in classic. Actually only started fishing for the first time on a pserver. What does the tournament consist of? I see it mentioned from time to time. I assume its best to be at max fishing aswell for it.
---
Holy fk ppl here are toxic!
---
Lol the only retail attitude is yours expecting every spec to be even remotely usable in progression raiding. Good luck.
---
As Bill Gates said, the best computer graphics are in the mind... 
---
Now, that might be dated.  But 'looking better' isn't always the best aesthetic.  Personally I thought the model/skeleton re-do a few years back made things super cheesy.  I prefer the low-poly look of original wow.
---
Because, and this is something you should know if your major is worth anything, a game is not its graphics.
---
Minecraft was one of the most popular games of all times.
---
You play the entire class, ele rest is not really a dps shaman. You shock to interrupt, totem support dispel poison and purge, heal, provide on demand burst.
---
It's the shaman class basically, if you dislike that don't play shaman.
---
Maybe, I just soc, hoj, jud, soc, swing until it is dead. I have slow 3.5 2h mace etc:) I fight mobs around my level max +1 or -1.  And usually I will take quests and go to quest related grind spot and kill around 100 mobs or more .
---
The time frame might not be correct, but it is fairly true.  With the Phased release of content, high end guilds will cap their equipment levels quickly, while low-end raiding guilds will do it more slowly, but the gap between them gear-wise will close over time.  If the time between phases is long enough, there will be parity in the gear levels.  
---
The only thing completely locked off from more casual players are the higher end pvp rewards.
---
Ahh yes, White Grape and the Pirates.  The heros we deserve.
---
&gt;Surely he is just blacklisting people from playing with HIS guild and HIS friends, no?
---
That was what he said yes. 
---
If someone harasses Soda or other streamers, they'd put those players on a "blacklist", which them and their friends would simply refuse to play with. Since a lot of people/guilds on the server would be streamers themselves or friends with streamers, the 'blacklisted' players would basically have a hard time doing group content.
---
This will happen on every server in Classic and is what happened in Vanilla, if you were known as a douche, many people would avoid playing with you. The only difference would be that streamers and their guilds would be such a large part of that specific servers community that a bad reputation would be a lot more severe.
---
/Cast cat form aquatic form 
---
I keep wondering why noone talks about the giant elephant in the room that is PvP gear. We'll get the 1.12 version which was originally introduced with the opening of Naxx and designed to be competitive with PvE gear at that point. But we'll get it in phase 2, during MC/Ony. The R12-13 sets are basically AQ40 tier and people will start to have this gear around the time BWL opens. This was never part of vanilla and it's going to create huge balance issues.
---
Your right in comparison to EQ it was simple to get to 60.
---
You'd have a resto shaman in that group for totems anyway, so your enhance shaman is not adding anything, that was my point.
---
Even if he wasn't dead weight, which he is, he adds nothing above what you'd have regardless.
---
I mean, whatever, if they find a guild that doesn't care what class they are, great for them. But just making it clear that there's no upside to bringing them beside feral aura.
---
Yea I can say I also enjoy it! But for me personally, I rarely feel as in-danger as I would feel back in the day on a pvp realm, and that really made me excited for it. Just my opinion though!
---
I thought ele is a "caster" magelike dps. Whereas enha is melee and thats what im looking for mainly
---
I might have to roll Hunter. Sounds fun
---
Occasionally I guess. But most of the time it's just going to be everyone AFK while taking the flight path, and summoning stone or no summoning stone, PvP can happen in front of the instance.
---
I sold my 12/12 Naxx warrior for $9,238. It was hard to let go of him I think his name was “Kungen” or something
---
It was middling. They were okay-ish in smaller pve content and pvp. Pretty much useless in raids outside of buffs. Granted even in dungeons they were easily outshined by classes that could bring actual damage rather than buffs and cleanse.

Sodapoppin Leaks His Total Donation Amount by Accident | Sodapoppin Total Donation Amount Exposed
---
I did like Guild Banks. It always brought the guild closer together it seemed. And as a Druid Im up for Balance changes. Id like to try moonkin but dont want to waste the time to get all the mana pots I would need lol For now Im ok with everything how it is though. 
---
See what Classic is like then make judgments from there.
---
So you could essentially reduce the challenege of early raids through PvP, or did I not understand that correctly?
---
Add-on user CHEATER
---
Hard class to be awesome with, imo.
---
They have difficulty in raids because most groups want to min-max hardcore with little or not flexibility. In PvP they can be ludicrously difficult to deal with if they've mastered their forms, timing, etc. Druid specific PvP gear back then came with some of all the stats but I think the PvE gear was more focused.
---
Would be nice for pally, druid tanks
---
Soda: you can be a completely normal player 100%. Don't stream the game.
---
Not according to posters on the threads about the troll(s) during the streamer duel tournament a few days ago, and even a GM who Asmongold talked to. They claim there is a limit to how much "griefing"/"trolling" is allowed. You don't think Blizzard will bend over backwards just to please the streamers and let them decide where the line goes? If streamers stop playing classic, thousands of their fans will follow suit. Blizzard would not want to let that money/publicity leave them...
---
Yes definitely. Also i'm curious to see what else will pop up.. You know, Some things might've been working differently on Private Realms and now we'll truly see how some things might work.
---
The argument that everything was theorycrafted to death is a joke, Considering we still see new viable specs of classes pop up out of nowhere.
---
&gt;Sodapoppin claims that he himself camps players but that this is because he is simply an asshole.
---
&gt;Please refrain from any name calling in the comments
---
🤔
---
Honestly I like all rare mobs. I feel a certain pride and accomplishment when taking them down.
---
With regard to other topics, I'd like to see a big old PvP thread. Start off with a couple of cookie cutter specs and class/race combos and let the conversations happen. Talk about the ups and downs and all the areas you look forward to fighting in. What quirks you'll pull, like using fireworks when you win a wpvp encounter.  Maybe you think troll is better than orc.

I would create one myself but it would be down voted immediately due to lack of memes and drama.

Look what happened to pubg many players got banned that didn't even streamsnipe for streamsniping

Sure people wanted the resurgence, I think private servers proved a lot more worth in it than streamers. I think when ppl are discouraged from blizzcons that say “you think you do but you don’t”, but you have a streamer who literally fights against it for years, it’s encouraging. Soda profits from being soda not from the hype. Hell half the streamers profit from just having a genuine community and entertainment. Sept a few I can think of that recently popped up (tiiiiiiiiiippppppppssssss)
---
So I think that argument is invalid...
---
1) I don't think we have official confirmation, most likely blue version -&gt; upgraded to purple in the later patches once we have AQ and beyond
---
2) Can't speak much to this, hopefully someone else has some better answers. But from memory hunters scaled decently, with the pvp gear, shaman I think was better if you went Ele due to it being spell power from memory.
---
The only thing wrong is numbers... well shit. Not like numbers are used often in the game right?
---
Paladin, lol
---
He's actually delusional.  Even Asmongold is smart enough to realize he should play on a PvE server if he doesn't want to get constantly hunted.
---
I said 3 hours a day. You will level slower, but after 2-3 months you will still hit 60 just fine, and you will still clear every raid every week just fine.  
---
Every single character in the game can only get raid gear once a week, and that's the best gear in the game. People that just raid log 4 nights a week will easily get full BiS through raiding. You're going to run out of stuff to do at 60 in about 2 weeks if you keep playing 12 hours a day on the one character (unless you consider exalted bloodsail rep and winterspring frostsaber *essential* content).
---
Wouldn't that just be % of accounts with a character with 60 vs % of accounts with a max level of X?
---
first person to get the  
---
Nintendo Power Glove + Power Pad + Zapper to work, I'll upvote your post on 3 accounts.  ;)
---
Grinding can be considered hard if you get bored.
---
Like I said I don't really care and just hope they don't carelessly do it. Like oh I'm having a bad day and this guy annoyed me once, fuck him.
---
You can.  Just not in the first month or so. 
---
I’m not even sure what you’re bitching about. You’ll get what you want. Just level an alt when the honor patch comes through. There ya go. Leveling at 30 with PvP system.
---
What?  The exact opposite is true.
---
Wish i could upvote you so many more times. I keep seeing that the streamers we have now are the reason classic wow is going to be popular and i just have to fucking laugh. These people have hopped on the hype train since the announcement and have no idea how long this shit has been going on.
---
You only need honored and you only need like 8 players to get there. Mages can AoE farm that rep in a couple of hours at most. I don't think Sunday is happening, but I would put my money on within the first lockout.
---
I was going to say the same shit. Thought it was a strange mistake to make.
---
Because "boring ass German servers" and "barren wastelands" without any substantiation besides subjectivity are excellent additions to your "discussion" right?
---
Hm, didnt think about that. What about ele in raids? Like as a dps and pocket healer
---
You don't need to farm raid gear to clear MC and you don't need a full group of 60s. I'm not sure if world first will be within the first raid lockout, but I can guarantee you that's the goal for the guilds gunning for world first. My bet would be on them achieving it.
---
Man, I gotta up my bind game. I've gotten so many bad habits during these years and I've never even used control or shift. I hope I can change that in Classic...
---
Being constantly followed by a horde of screeching kids so socially outcast and desperate for a sense of belonging that they'll latch onto anyone who calls them "bros" or "streamername army" sound like a personal hell, thanks.
---
Another game that had this exact idea was RuneScape.  Many people with maxed accounts in the main game could farm more gold than its equivalent in oldschool.  So theyd just transfer wealth until their new oldschool account was self sufficient.
---
I put interupts on capslock. Half the time I sound like a retard in chat but it's worth it.
---
Lol everyone responding to these so densely is amusing
---
Leveling rogue is more fun than priest?
---
A GM can have a good network on the server, yes.
---
Never heard of this before. I know R12-13 are difficult to get so hopefully that will slow down any inbalance but yeah if that gear was meant to be on par with AQ40 then I can see a few guilds getting ahead of the curve with it.
---
Yeah because guild masters have a posse of dozen people following them at any given time who give them whatever BoEs/consumables/enchants they may need. Totally not something they have to facilitate, it’s just a perk of being a guild master or streamer!
---
I saw the crossbow drop only once in like 30 BWL runs and another hunter got it.
---
My new dream is having the Halberd of Smiting with the Crossbow of Smiting.
---
I doubt they would ban someone for killing another player 2-3 times is what I meant. Consistent griefing of the same player streamer or not over a long period of time surely does deserve some form of reprimand though?
---
The mage can never reset. You dont have to avoid the morph you can just sit in it for a couple of seconds to regen hp if you aren't full,  then swap out of it and hit the mage so he doesnt get a drink off.
---
Time investment, and lack of available resources / info made Vanilla hard.
---
&gt; What can they do? 
---
They can shun you from every half-decent guild in your realm, effectively preventing you from doing relevant content.
---
&gt; What’s the worse that a horde guild that’s alliance do? 
---
&gt; What kind of influence will they do? 
---
Simple, streamer will have his streamer friends (who are leading most if not all of the decent guilds who can actually clear raids) blacklist you.
---
&gt; You can just say how bad it will be but not actually say any of the actions. 
---
Except I just did, for the third time.
---
Now, do you really not think his ... what 50k viewers are enough to fill up both of a realm's factions?
---
Perhaps you're right... good thing we know they will play on the same realm than other of his streamer friends, making a much bigger audience, thus strengthening their influence.
---
Theres going to be almost 0% chance you'll be able to find room to AOE. Count on it being packed to the gills. Since you already have A tank, healer, and a mage. My recommendation is to recruit a warlock and another mage and commit to tearing through aoe dungeons.
---
i made my hunter mount money in vanilla by getting some weird purple ring off of a murloc in swamp of sorrows, i wish i knew what item it was
---
those people are leftists....they are part of youtube.
---
youtube only censors conservatives
---
You need to explain what you are imagining here, because it makes no sense. Off-tank means tanking adds and such.
---
Both that and the fact that nobody will be able to compete at all if they don't also get to R13/14. R14 isn't that big of a deal, it's one item and PvE weapons tend to be sort of a tier ahead so BWL already contains equal weapons. But the R12/13 sets are so broken when available at such an early stage. Originally they were on par with T1, but in patch 1.11 they were upgraded to be on equal footing with AQ40 gear.
---
&gt;Blizzard catered to casual and bad MMO fans with vanilla
---
MMO fans didn't exisit before vanilla.  Before WoW, games like DnD, Everquest and Ultima were the loser, fat virgin kid games.  WoW put the genre on the map and essentially, made the genre cool and broke the stigma.
---
There were no MMO fans before WoW made it so.
---
No, but that’s also not what’s being suggested here and it’s not hard to understand that, you just want to cherry pick an extreme example of something that won’t happen because it follows the narrative of this thread and the hate circlejerk towards streamers that has ruined a subreddit that was once excellent for differing ideologies and modern impacts towards classic wow and now it’s just posts like yours with desperate grabs for karma.
---
fire pulse works for ages, what shitty servers have you played on?
---
Thought you guys were complaining about the legion of fanboys that would do anything for their beloved streamer? It won’t be hard for them to raise more people to help than the original campers, in fact it’s probably the single greatest benefit of being a popular streamer.    
---
I’m all for acknowledging that some streamers are whiny and promote bad behaviour, but there are some extremely delusional people on this subreddit that think they’ll be able to make a dent in their play
---
Hey it’s me your brother, what’s the method, brother?
---
Oh boy, I'm getting the popcorn
---
I know. But maybe you aren't low and he is, so that still wastes your mana.
---
A good shaman can twist totems, so the tank in my scenario has the crit from the druid, agi str and WF from the shaman. This adds up and should not be ignored if the raid is threat limited.
---
I will play most likely a feral druid and you better believe I will plan ahead of each dungeon to make sure no one "needs" an item I can really use.
---
Holy paladin + anything is a strong combo. Rogue is a 1 man world pvp army. Not sure you could have a stronger combo.
---
Ok can you also answer me this - I SWEAR that when Warsong Gulch first released you had to be level 21 as that was originally the lowest bracket available but I could never find a good source on this or patch notes. I could of just been flat wrong but I specifically remember grinding to 21 because I wanted to play WSG so bad the day it came out.
---
Yes that's totally up to you, but don't get mad if they try to stop you by talking to their friends etc so your rep on the server will be bad. Fair
---
Soda acting like a baby? :o
---
Every Sunday at 2PM server time, a bunch of Tastyfish pools spawn all along the coast of Stranglethorn Vale. The first to catch 40 of them and turn them in at Booty Bay is the winner and gets to pick between the best fishing pole in the game or a gimmicky trinket that turns you into a fish. There are other rare fish to catch that can be turned in for various fishing items, like a hat and a fishing line enchant for your pole. You need 125 fishing to even catch a Tastyfish and 225 to make sure none get away. It’s a mid/high level zone and PVP contested, so make sure you can defend yourself.
---
his opinion does not matter , being an advocate against it just makes you a target. 
---
im against that shit but id treat it like i dont care snipers want some reaction if you dont give a shit it takes a lot away from it.
---
i bet plenty of streamers will level on pve servers then transfer to pvp like true bitchboys
---
If only the limit was way below 12000 per realm and they test their servers.. Ob wait.
---
This comment section is going to be very entertaining.
---
You know the donations are just gravy, not the core income for streaming right?
---
Getting 24/7 protection and having an army doing whatever you want whenever you want isn't special treatment? Do you think that streamers should not allowed to get camped unlike everyone else?
---
Thats frickin great, wish I had one too!
---
You guys sound real jealous lol. What he said wasnt that he doesnt want people killing him, he doesn't want people specifically targeting him non stop. You guys are talking about making a guild specifically to target soda and other streamers and  that sounds like targeted harassment. Sounds like soda just wants to experience the game that everybody else is going to experience with all the ganking and world pvp but just not targeted harassment. Imagine playing the game and having a whole guild of people out there that only play to camp you and stop you from having fun. 
---
Not saying his idea is good but seeing everybody complain and say ignorant comments like "go on a pve realm" is annoying.
---
Are you wearing cloth or something? I've always had to maybe heal once after a fight if I'm fighting one mob at a time.
---
No it does not, it does on alliance side.
---
Horde has no fearward so they need a second tank for bosses that have fear that need to temporarely tank the boss (such as Onyxia) while the main tank is feared.
---
Hmm good idea ill discuss with group tonight
---
If you get banana pvp gear and a good weapon it is an interesting class :)
---
&gt;wtf does streamsniping have to do with "the spirit of classic"
---
Like everything involving streamers, absolutely nothing.
---
My bro is a 40 rogue, and he has a small stream on twitch. I can share you his twitch or I can pass it on to him for you. He's tested a lot of other stuff for /r/classicwow and I'm sure he wont mind spending some time on your farm.
---
Can't wait for it to ruin my life again. I really hope that they eventually fork classic into it's own game with new content based on the vanilla formula.
---
Hybrid dps doesnt mean playing a weird spec, it means playing Paladin, Shaman, Druid, or Priest for DPS AT ALL.
---
Blizzard can do whatever they want. 
---
They have the ability to make 4 raid difficulties. High mythic keys are dramatically different from normal LFD. They made it so that you have a different toolkit in PvP.
---
What is stopping them from making realms that have MMO elements? If they wanted to, they could have classic realms with LFD/LFR. Im not saying they should, but you know what I'm saying.
---
No in no way shape or form is a ret a viable dps end game. It or Enhance is the worst pve anything. That being said be social and be friendly and people might just like having you around. Just like they enjoy having Esfand in their raid. Being likable opens a lot of doors.
---
Not saying that i agree with what Soda is saying but he didn't just hop onto the hype train, multiple times he has ditched streaming for fairly long periods of time to play on vanilla private servers.
---
I'd watch Esfand. He's a little more mellow. Plus, he's got beta keys.
---
34 year old me is using the exact same thought process in 2019.
---
I'm a little frustrated because I wanted to try speedrunning 60, but I don't have access to beta and won't be able to compete with other speedrunners that do have access.
---
This makes me want to play ret Paladin but it's a bitch to gear if you dont spec holy and heal dungeons and role on ret gear
---
Good luck
---
I wonder how much $$$$ gold will cost
---
Ragnaros is expected to be dead within the first week.
---
A 40man raid team is supported by another 20-40 farmers to provide consumes, e.g guild members who expect to progress raid but cannot take time off due to important work etc stay in lower levels (20-30) to farm fishing for fire resistance potion mats to funnel it to the week 1 team. 
---
You can kill ragnaros with level 57s in green gear, the only "mostly" pre BiS people will be stuff like the big tanks who have teams leveling them to the max 24/7 via acc sharing, vpn and shadow, or the healers responsible for tanks. Maybe some super efficient dps.
---
You get to lvl 60 in less than 90hours if you know the routes, plus minus 5hours due to variance of competition.
---
Portal was a ton of fun. With all the machinama today, I wonder why we haven’t seen anything like it again.
---
RuneScape had the same thing going on and it was extremely profitable to transfer wealth in the early days because of the disparity in inflation.  im willing to bet that many retail players would play classic for the sole purpose of exchanging the gold.  After a year or two of a stable 60 population the exchange rates will more or less level out but until then gold on classic with be worth more than what you could farm on retail.
---
I 100% believe Guild Banks are coming to Classic, at least before ZG and AQ. Without them, account sharing will be rampant and we all know Blizzard’s stance on that. Blizzard just hasn’t announced Guild Banks yet because they’ve got a lot on their plate and the marketing hype of “#nochanges” is too strong. But once Blizzard has everyone addicted to that Classic tit, they won’t care.
---
Thanks for another detailed post. I actually agree completely if cloth turn ins are available, it is definitely worth doing as the time saved could pay off the gold and more. 
---
The 70 hour figure I got was from a comment from ClassicDB. ClassicDB also says that each 10 Morrowgrain is worth 75 (not 50) rep. Unsure which is accurate. I will copy/paste the comment from the person on ClassicDB. When I first read it, his math sounded fine, but he may of missed something.
---
His comment was:
---
"Based on drop rates and reagents needed..
---
for Revered to Exalted you need 21000 rep
---
21000 / 75 = 280 turn-ins
---
280 turn-ins = 2800 Morrowgrain
---
Morrowgrain drops approx 37.9% of the time according to wowhead stats, but drops 1 - 5 morrowgrain each time it does.
---
at 2.5 morrowgrain per drop, 37.9% of the time - you will need roughly 425 Evergreen Herb Casings.
---
Casings are made from 2x Un'Goro Soil and 1x Packet of Tharlendris Seeds, so this means 850 soil and 425 seeds.
---
The seeds are sold by a vendor in Darnassus for 10s each (is this affected by rep?) therefore the seeds will cost you 42.5g
---
Un'Goro Soil drops most in Un'Goro Crater from the Gorishi bug things, roughly 1/3 of the time, maybe a bit more. This means you will need to kill around 2500 of these mobs to get your soil, assuming you don't pick any soil up from the ground. If anyone can estimate how long you'd be killing mobs to get that done and how often you'd come across a pile of soil that'd be wonderful.
---
Last on the list is the 10 minute cooldown on cultivate seeds, this means that once you have spent your 42.5g to buy packets of seeds, and killed your 2500 Gorishi mobs to collect 850 bits of soil, you need to spend 70 hours and 50 minutes cultivating them. I suggest you do it while you grind tbh."
---
He is assuming you will grind the Soil yourself from Ungoro while making the seeds.
---
First: I don't watch streams, I've only seen a few clips for various streamers playing various games.  I'm not even sure who Sodapoppin is, I got to this post because I browse reddit by browsing r/all set to top/hour.  
---
That being said, is there some reason why he doesn't just put a delay on his stream so that he can't be sniped?  I used to play with people who streamed PUBG and that's what they did whenever it became a problem.  I haven't played with any of them since January though, so maybe something has changed?

Hi, /u/SoulSharer

/u/RemindMeBot RemindMe! 1 year
---
Dunno what you're referring to specifically with the hostile takeover part since ATVI is valued at over 30B, but I agree with the sentiment of the rest entirely.  IMO we're looking at Pokemon Go-level ubiquity initially, but with legs like OSRS. 
---
I don't think Blizzard markets well, but I think the organic snowball is going to help this reach the otherwise uninterested masses. It's going to be Pokemon Go. People will feel like they're missing out if they're not a part of it. 
---
I hope I'm not wrong on the longevity piece, because you're probably right that the market needs this win. If it's a loss I think we're looking at a more aggressive pace away from PC/Console gaming investment, even beyond the current levels of mobile-centric path forward.
---
Normies rise up!
---
It is hard compared to the tutorial level of difficulty most retail content is. I think actually containing some challenge would be the better description though.
---
Yep, hunter in my guild was dying to get that weapon. I would say it was lucky for them that the warriors in our raid were filthy casuals or full-time protection, we were actually willing to pass it out of empathy (I was personally very content with my Halberd of Smiting, just cause it looked really cool). It never actually dropped for us though, not until they got it from another raid group.
---
True, you are right. I will annalise all the classes and find out which one fits my style. Thanks a lot for the comment
---
I remember standing at the mount vendor for at least half an hour trying to pick a mount, couldn't get the wrong colour haha
---
That's basically a ninja isn't it?
---
Is there a clip?
---
How DARE YOU, sir!? Where's my pitchfork!?
---
Honestly I kind of hate how quickly people posting 'unpopular opinions' get shot down around here. I'm very #nochanges just because I worry that they would take those little changes too far, but I still think the discussion is healthy. Neither one of those ideas are all that crazy imo.
---
Yea thats my brothers and, my plan. I'm gonna be a warrior and he's on a timer. We been doing dry runs of 1-20 to try to get a break away going but, failing that. Dungeons it is. Right now our 1-15 is faster then Joana but, no telling what it will look like come game time.
---
We haven't seen what elite damage looks like in raids yet. The curve could be sharp between 30 and 60
---
who knew that you could stream classic wow without getting banned
---
I just they go through the phases, release naxx, and that's it. No need for any further updates.
---
Do you really think everyone gets camped for hours like streamers will be?
---
Someone literally jumped around in front of duels on a Tauren for *HOURS* to fuck with them. And that was on a server of people who were known in some capacity to get in and not even the average population.
---
Also to insinuate that their weren’t guild masters that will receive the same if not more protection is just a flawed argument and it’s really not hard to see why it’s just blind envy or outside influences that’s making you think and say that.
---
With how questing works after 30, you bounce around a ton and go back places at later levels to accomplish the harder quests.
---
I never said it wouldn't be a pain in the ass, but it shouldnt stand in the way of playing with a friend. That's what vanilla is all about! The journey, the connections &lt;3
---
It’s just people relating to each other.
---
I was agreeing with you, just responded to the wrong person.
---
&gt;im willing to bet that many retail players would play classic for the sole purpose of exchanging the gold.
---
I think you underestimate the time investment required to even be able to farm seriously in Classic, let alone farm sizeable amounts of gold.
---
Unless you are nolifing, leveling is going to take most people who aren't already familiar with Classic a month or more. That's just for leveling up to a point where you can BEGIN to farm gold.
---
No, there's no vote kick system :)
---
I think difficulty can be applied in a number of different ways. 
---
Mechanically the raiding was simpler and the PvP is arguably a little more clear cut (not every class can do fucking everything etc) retails dungeons go from faceroll to incredibly hard via the mythic+ system. 
---
Same for raiding via LFR and mythic difficulties. 
---
But vanilla doesn’t have that. The difficulty from vanilla originally was a complete lack of knowledge and sheer time investment required from a huge population that had no experience in MMOs before. 
---
Some people had Everquest or Ultima etc but the vast majority this was the first MMO so it was an entirely fresh experience.  
---
Lack of experience + limited wealth and sharing of knowledge + high time requirements = hard 
---
It will be easier this time around. 
---
Still a lot of fun though.
---
\-\_\_-
---
I think this problem is specific to the PC community, as they tend to view themselves as “elite” given their preferred platform. Most of my friends when I play on PC are IRL friends that I have to text/call to bring into a game. Meanwhile on PS4 I’ve added probably over a dozen people playing games like Overwatch, Apex Legends, and Fortnite because they were friendly and communicated properly. Granted, most of them are 5-10 years younger than I am but they still hold a level of comradery that I haven’t seen from PC players (outside of the classic community) in years. I still talk to people I raided with back in TBC/Wrath but I couldn’t even tell you the names of the guilds I’ve been in since then. Hopefully classic helps to restore this openness to making new friends that your brother wants!
---
I don’t think it has anything to do with social media. Many gamers don’t really care about social media anyways.
---
Yeah I mean overall I liked the quality and it cracked me up. I think it would have been 10/10 if you went it for a charge on the warrior while a paladin was questing and then the pally just vanished. And then the orc cries from being alone in this vast and abandoned world... of Warcraft.
---
But that’s my 2 cents overall 8/10 :) - plus you actually went and took the time to make this not me. So take my critique as you see fit friend
---
I meant 3 hours a day sorry.   
---
They’ll still have pvp gear, more people to call upon and less reason to Ben out in the world in the first place. Might be able to annoy them for a bit but it’ll be more like swatting a fly than anything consistent or long lasting — hence why people in this thread (and sub) are delusional about how much they’ll be able to impact on steamers
---
And, ironically, one of the best dps also has the remaining 1% in decurse.
---
The German playerbase always has language specific realms for themselves.
---
They get to keep their practice and route testing though.
---
because he wants a blacklist across many guilds that enforces it from a officer level. if your in any of his friends guilds on either faction and you play with someone on the blacklist he wants you kicked
---
Well the last one was a rollercoaster as well xd There were people who appreciated it though, so I say mission accomplished.
---
&gt; Within this video, Sodapoppin claims that he himself camps players but that this is because he is simply an asshole. Down with Soda, and down with anyone else who believes they should be able to dictate who is able to enjoy the game. 
---
Was trying to say exactly this the other day in the Duel Tourney thread. Nothing but downvotes from his sycophants. He was calling for account wide perma ban on the Tauren that was trolling, even though Soda was camping a guy on stream a few nights before for no other reason than he was in a bad mood from losing WSG. He's a complete asshat, and the fact that Blizzard did anything to the Tourney troller has me worried about the influence these shitlords will have on Classic Live. 
---
Should just go for it and call it &lt;Stream Snipers&gt;.
---
Yea for real I need to ride bikes with the boys and get my first kiss this summer.
---
Is there a specific reason you hate streamers? I don't watch them myself but I'm just curious as to why you would be willing to pay money to ruin somebody else's enjoyment.
---
If you wanted to dps, then just go full elemental.  You still have access to all of your heal spells to pop a few when shit hits the fan.  Should be back to back up heal or raid heal if someone doesn't log on just fine as well.
---
Aren't those the same hardcore guilds that would have rolled through BWL, AQ40, and Naxx regardless? This doesn't sound like it'll be an issue for 99.9% of the playerbase.
---
all this will end up doing is causing guilds on the blacklist to ninja from any member of his or his friends guilds just to send the message
---

Private servers literally buff boss damage and health by 30-40%
---
I don’t think you’re entirely wrong but I do believe you are underestimating the benefits streamers get from their community that Guild Masters only see a small part of.

Sp, I started WoW on Cataclysm and went up all the way to Legion. Raided up to mythic.I mained an assassination rogue, wich had a very fast and active, kinda chaotic dpa rotation, that i enjoy a lot. In classic, it seema like all classes have a very very slow pace, with very few abilities to press, wich i find very boring. What is the best class to play to fill my fast paced style? I want to be a competitive dpsser also, so i'd prefer it to be viable in a raid enviroment. I don't plan a lot on PvPing.
---
A huge bulk of what killed wow was killing all the social aspects (group finder, making all content too easy).  Outside of that I really wouldn't mind minor quality of life upgrades such as dual spec (although I know how much and why people are against those things).  Either way I'll take it the way it is.
---
It's almost as if the 130,213 people here have different opinions. 
---
Also, I'm confused, you seem to be against playing classic wow, which is fine. But you also complained about the release date being in August because it's killed your hype.
---
I think you're just a bit upset having to wait so you're looking for negative aspects to try and take away your own enjoyment. 
---
I'm keen to play as well, I'm sure we all are. It's only 81 days and 10 hours to go. But who's counting?
---
You keep bringing up parry haste as if that's supposed to explain anything about fury tanks or their viability
---
You have tremor totem instead of fear ward hordeside
---
I appreciate your opinion regardless man, thanks for watching!

I like more open zones (Barrens, Tanaris, Stonetalon, Arathi) and I don't particularly like the dense wooded areas so no, I'm afraid Feralas did not appeal to me. Dire Maul was good though and I think Blizz basically forgot about that Nelf island place.
---
Maybe he meant rain of fire and not hellfire? Either way warlocks spamming hellfire with spam heals on them is the best aoe damage in raids.
---
I had two pieces of paper taped to the side of my computer tower in Vanilla.  One was a list of people who ninja looted items or rolled need on something they shouldn't, and the other was a list of people who camped me.
---
Hey now, its just that this sub shouldnt allow posts about the game, or future speculation, or streamers, or current content...
---
Wait what can we post again?
---
Oh he shouldn't be so dramatic. Streamers can play the game like a normal person at any time. Of course, it would mean they wouldn't be making money for it, or have a rabid league of followers to carry them through every situation. But, you know, that's the normal experience.
---
The fastest anyone has gotten a warrior to 60 on the pirated realms, which are basically ez mode, is 5 days played.  The mobs in classic will be a bit harder, and there's no more sit/crit macro shenanigans, which will slow things even further.    
---
&gt; You bet on common sense and decency, I'll bet on the 1 in 1 million 30 year old neckbeards everytime.
---
lol.  I might be wrong, but I just don't see it.
---
Does this mean Classic will have the fp because it's 1.12 base?
---
I call it Lead Guitar Syndrome. EVERYONE wants to be soloing center stage playing lead guitar. Nobody wants to play Drums, nobody wants to play Bass. Same thing happens in Shooter games. EVERYONE wants to be a Sniper, nobody wants to be Medic or play Defense, EVERYONE wants to be on offense. To be fair these types of people are 99% of the time terrible at the game so they would suck as tanks/healers anyway.
---
Fury tanks are all the rage on pservers. However, that's only because they are able to get away with nuke heals on them keeping them up.
---
With the actual Parry chance that will be in classic, there is more than a significant chance that a few parries in a row is going to make bosses swing extremely quickly, and blow them up. That means the meme spec dies, and it's back to sword and board, and DPS watching threat, and slower fights and healers needing to heal like normal again.
---
This one change that we know of changes raids a lot.
---
Vanilla WAS hard for an average gamer. It was much easier than other MMOs but by that day standards it was still insane. You had this paper guide that came with the game and I remember even buying the actual book guide as well. Didnt help.
---
An analogy would be use of computers, older folks still have hard time understanding how computers work while younger generation just gets it. 
---
Only thing is, it does require a lot of running and traveling, I honestly think that one part of the game will literally separate the men from the boys.
---
The servers can handle that no problem, even more, but not all in one area which is why its going to be there just at the start, after the players spread trough the world it wont be needed. When AQ opens tho, thats where the server will really suffer.
---
You have my sword
---
Does it work with cancel form, natures swiftness, healing touch?
---
What a little bitch. But to be fair, it must be a very rough life making millions of dollars to sit home and jerkoff playing video games all day 😭
---
the problem is most of the people "stream sniping" the streamers arnt, its just pvp happening naturally so they whine and cry and blame it on sniping
---
I can understand this, my first online friends I ever made was in Vanilla Wow. I still talk to quite a few of them even though we stopped playing the game at the end of Cata.
---
Modern Wow, I only made friends after joining a guild. The only way I found that guild was because an old friend from Vanilla found me online and offered me a spot.
---
And calling an entire community "toxic" because you disagreed with one guy, is not toxic at all of course...
---
My main is a hunter. I spent the first 20 mins of the raid using eyes of the beast to rub my cats ads in everyone's face
---
I'm between Warlock and Shadow Priest.
---
I like world PVP, healing and raiding. I think warlock has lots of room for skill &amp; does good in PVP + PVE, more than SP. People say warlock is easily one of the hardest &amp; SP is one of the easiest. I would love to raid as Shadow, but know I won't get gear or spots like a warlock. I like DOTs, but I'm not super excited about having a pet so I should go DS/RUIN I guess. But then I couldn't heal dungeons like a priest can :(
---
Typically when you make a claim you provide evidence to go along with it not just “heh, everyone here is fucking stupid besides me” in all of your responses.
---
I think the cost is your job, degree, and/or marriage lol
---
&gt; I am glad most of these streamers play Alliance so I don't have to even give a shit about them and even better that it sounds like a good deal will play on a PvE server because of their high profile, which is even better.
---
A lot of the ones that seem to be whining about this the most are horde, though.
---
Yeah...they did test the servers and the stress test was hugely unstable when there were maybe 400-500 people visible.
---
If 10 raids make the server ms shoot up to 200-300 then any Tuesday raid night Orgrimmar and Stormwind/IF will nuke the servers from orbit. 
---
I wish this was discussed more on this subreddit but we’d rather focus on streamer drama instead and getting upset that people have more privileges than us.
---
In oldschool RuneScape alot of methods took upwards of 500 hrs of play to get a decent gold farming method.  Didnt stop anybody serious about it.
---
I like the idea of a server with only one character per account, but the reality is that people will just pay for multiple accounts for alts, and then you end up with a scenario that is unfair for people who don't buy multiple accounts.
---
Another big thing for me is that in classic all drops are worthwhile. TBC and onward the lvl 1-60 drops became completely useless outside of twink items. With the cap being 60 again even grinding lvl 40 mobs you get items that can fetch a decent price or have value to other people. Even just dropped crafting mats can be a steady thing to grind and make a decent profit towards your mount.
---
I noticed that too lol. Just wants to be a miserable fuck. Let him.
---
That's what I'm saying. Even if they don't level ahead of you, the moment they keep questing without you none of that matters, they're doing different quests, perhaps in different zones. No matter how much you bounce around, they won't be doing the same quests as you again, unless you play without them and catch up.
---
That’s a dangerous level of irony my dude.
---
Imagine being so blind and angry about something because it is against the rules.  Do you even understand the numbers that are off?  It’s minimal numbers for NPC’s such as protections and damage numbers.  They are pretty close on private servers and you obviously are uneducated on this.  Using the 8% parry difference is so naive to think it would change anything in what classes can compete.
---
Sure, but I think you still have a chance if you do enough research. You can also practice on private servers if you want
---
Turning perma nightfall into a more reasonable uptime percentage is ~50 dps difference. However the dummy is also being attacked from the front meaning parries could happen (i didnt go through the video checking if it does happen) so it might even out
---
I always tipped 50s until a mage blasted me for 5 mins for not tipping 1g... I just assumed double the rune cost was acceptable... players can be assholes whether they are giving or receiving lol it goes both ways
---
Whelps, ogres, or bog beasts anywhere they are.
---
I always felt ogres died easier than other melee mobs, and whelps objectively have less stats than other same level mobs with the same XP.

Stream sniping for the purposes of griefing via pvp servers should be considered targetted harassment and reported as such.
---
Thank you, this really helped a lot!
---
I hate it when I accidentally leave my checkbook in a box at the back of a closet. ;)
---
Yes it is in
---
i completely understand the stance of the #noChanges people, but on the other hand, i one day would like it if there were more viable specs.
---
No server/faction/race changes in classic.
---
It's gonna be a *huge* issue for anybody who cares about PvP. Getting the high ranks is something most players don't even really have the opportunity to attempt, so it's not like they can just be told to do the same when they complain that PvP is a joke because premaders have gear two tiers ahead of the current raids.
---
I’m wearing mail only :) keep my gear updated
---
Your edit say it's not about witch hunting, but every other comment is literally talking about camping him, which feels a little like witch hunting lol
---
This was in beta, so I don't know if it will translate to release, but the community is spectacular so far.
---
I made a friend back in 2007 in TBC and we have remained such ever since. I hope he gets to experience what I did.
---
&gt;That's a dirty way to play the game, using your streamer influence to tell THE OTHER FACTION ON A PVP SERVER TO BLACKLIST PLAYERS FOR PVP!
---
Why is that dirty? If both Horde and Alliance streamers play on the same server and they both want to discourage stream sniping or harassment, why wouldn't they work together to shun bad behavior players? Having a bad reputation on a server was very common back in the day, my guild had an internal 'ignorelist' in TBC, if streamers do the same why is that somehow worse?
---
I hear ya man. Tanaris is amazing I agree with you about that. Can't wait to run ZF multiple times in a row haha.
---
Could you define "over a long period of time", because no blue posts ever have afaik? If memory serves me right theres one that deals with the issue of when pvp becomes harassment, and just says something along the lines of "...over a period of time...".
---
It just seems like it's up to Blizzards discretion, and if you ask me, they will be more likely to side with the streamers over the average Joe whenever an issue crops up because they have a finacial incentive to do so.
---
What an asshole, he doesn't own the game he should be banned from streaming Blizzard content with that attitude.
---
It doesn’t. It means you take 1 more mage and 1 less warrior lol.
---
Does this have something to do with rfd and picking pigs pockets?
---
Feel like it was for sure worse the first week after announcement and as beta opened, but yea.

yet alone figuring out attunement quests and so on. it was hella fun to get to know how to get bwl attuned back in the days.
---
also - dmg contribution. sure there were not that much raidmechanics or pvp allrounders. but there were combos classes and other stuff. many bosses had insane gearchecks and dont forget aq 40 unpatched cthun
---
Cant and wont please everyone. Personally I say they should leave classic as is until players tire out before bothering to add content. The no changes crowd will always make a fuzz about any kind of change so may as well make distance between the launch and the change so it's less of an uproar.
---
Roll a warrior, get it to 10, and try pulling 3 mobs your same level.
---
Now do the same in BFA.
---
That's what is being referenced.
---
Tremortotem functions completely different as fear will still reset the threat of the maintank.
---
The offtank has to obviously tank the boss until the main tank is not feared again and regained the threat as taunt does not put you on top of the threat meter.
---
Fury tank hast to dw until he has to tank or he will not gain enough threat as warriors gain most of their rage from getting hit in classic.
---
Streamsniping is against the twitch tou, just fyi.
---
Is this a troll? I'm confused my comments here. Obviously stream sniping is bad for content turns the streamer to be more negative and then viewers feed off that. To keep the experience more positive is a good idea and i believe that is Soda's intention. He is just not that smart so his solution is immature.
---
Lol it's not it's called having a fake persona and scamming kids money.
---
If they're blacklisted they won't be playing together, so what would they ninja?
---
I want damage and healing done shown on Battleground Dashboards.
---
niiice duuuude
---
I don't understand how anyone who rolls on a PvP server can be upset when someone from the opposing faction tries to kill them, LMAO.  That's just life baby.  Furthermore, if you are a semi-famous or famous player, people are going to be more likely to mess with you - again just life.  And if you choose to stream your World of Warcraft gameplay on a PvP server, guess what - yup - people are going to hunt you down and kill you every chance they get.
---
Yea, 12 comes after 6. They probably didn't expect to go into double digits with patch numbers so read the 1.6 as 1.06
---
Stream snipers are the saddest pieces of shit and who cares their punishment
---
Don't know if you've already checked it out but https://www.vanillafriends.com/ might be just the thing you are looking for
---
Absolutely but to sit here and stew in anger because someone is apart of a bigger army than yours is dumb, this thread introduces a great idea to create a guild to counter streamers but falls short when it comes to the actual point of that guild. 
---
A guild like OP is suggesting would probably just have toxic shits who do sit on top of streamers all day corpse camping them, but a guild to go against streamers and contest Devilsaur spawns etc would make everyone’s classic experience even better.
---
But instead, this subreddit has fallen down the internet road of toxicity and jealousy due to insecurities others share in their own lives versus just trying to play the game and have the most amount of fun possible with a wholesome community.
---
I was unsure, I mean, the pants don't look the same as a Forsaken. (from what I can recall at least) But I agree, the bottom yaw seems to confirm this.
---
I was confused by some talent choices, until I realized this document was about how to be minimize how much you burden your raid as a ret paladin
---
r/titlegore
---
Theres such a large difference between camping and stream sniping that I think its pathetic people are getting upset about this. Imagine going in to Subway and deliberately stopping people from making sandwiches for hours and then getting mad when you get banned.
---
There was a post about this where I mentioned that. Classic servers should stay and classic+ or xpacs (new or old) should be on other servers. It was downvoted before the post was deleted.
---
I agree that would be a great compromise.
---
&gt; Unless you are nolifing
---
So obviously people ARE going toi no life this game. And it really isn't as hard as you are making it out to be to farm in this game. It will be VERY easy to farm gold at release when 99% of the pop will be trying to level to 60 ASAP. YOu can easily farm mats that are req to lvl eng and make a lot of gold early on selling them. There are already people setting up groups to do this on release so they can transfer the gold they make for retail gold or sell the gold for money over paypal. You do not need to be lvl 60 to farm these mats. If you think gold selling isnt going to be a massive thing especially at release you are super naive. I am 100% going to do it and there are forums of 1000s that you can find who have similar plans.
---
10 years together and 6 married. I learned back in Cata that I should not push the spouse into buying a copy.  =P

I know the beta is an above-average sample size of players, but I honestly haven't met a single useless player on there yet
---
Really goddamn funny and well made, cinematography is way too good for a wow shitpost! Really reminded me of old WoW machinima, in a very good way :)
---
&gt; Of course, it would mean they wouldn't be making money for it, or have a rabid league of followers to carry them through every situation. 
---
Or he can just you know.. play the game while streaming, not have people follow him, not have people streamsnipe him? That is what he's asking for, he knows he can't have it but that's the dream.
---
He literally says the opposite, but okay.
---
Even easier to spot if the streamer is playing a rogue and the griefers in question knows exactly where that person is stealthed at all times. Crazy obvious at that point.
---
Pet wel belangrijk jajaja
---
Only? 
---
That's 33 days of grinding 8 hours a day.
---
lmao. Well you've done it. Druid is likely the classic main, continuing the legacy! The guild I was looking into also said theres an opening for a feral druid in raids.... so things looking good!

theres tons to do in phase1 for top guilds, probably the busiest all around because of leveling alts and then split running mc for thunderfurys for a insanely long time

Cata is when the Social aspect of the game finally came to an end. Towards the end of Wrath is when it started but Cata put a nail in that coffin.

You're a fucking scrub if you couldn't compete in MC/BWL.
---
Random green +shadow wrath gear thats over level 50 is more than enough to pull aggro from tanks and get everyone killed.
---
Yeah, half of the post is a nonsensical analogy that actually is more confusing than just explaining his PoV in literal terms.
---
So does that mean the PVP whiners should go to Super Weenie Hut Junior's?
---
part of classic is if you are a douchbag you can't get a group sure there is some flitering out when it comes to ally v horde action but even that wasn't limited back in the day since of forums.
---
trying to ratify an agreement of systemic blacklisting is wrong however. saying you will personally look into cases of bad players on your side of the faction and not play with them and tell your follower not to play with said person is fine. but making an agreement of that in return is too far.
---
Man...it’s almost like I have my own data points that aren’t limited to this one post.
---
Fucking wild, I know.
---
Servers didnt crash i think it was more on players pcs\internet, that the actual stability of the server.
---
It was hard because we didn't have 15 years experience looking up information.
---
On a PvP server? Come on now. Your ignore list was probably for players that your guild chose to ignore for reasons other than someone on the other faction crying about being camped. They CAN do this, but it doesn't mean they should. Playing on a PvE server is the solution, not trying to change how PvP servers work for everyone else.
---
Are you talking about party members? If so yeah there is a generic portrait untill you get close enough to your party.
---
If I was part of the US server shitshow I would start a guild called Blacklist doing nothing but ganking streamers.   
---
Luckily I will be playing on EU servers.
---
They could, yes.  My point is it would be a bad business decision to alienate current fans, with a low chance of recovering previously lost fans.
---
Believe what you want man. I literally spend all day talking to Psychologists, Social Workers and counselors about behavior trends. But I am unwilling to spend additional time changing your mind.
---
First off I’m not mad about anything. I also partake in pservers. I can just admit they are flawed, and not a little flawed either. 9% parry. And it’s changes a bit about the meta alone.
---
Never heard of a DW tank until pservers. DW tanks won’t be a thing with 14% parry rate even though weapon skill lowers parry rate. Let’s also talk about weapon skill. Most pservers have it so glancing blow dmg reduction can be completely negated via weapon skill. Something that wasn’t possible in vanilla and won’t be possible in Classic. So tell me again how it doesn’t affect anything.
---
I've always played Horde and my highest level Alliance character was like level 20. In Classic I'll be rolling Alliance for the complete new experience. I'm gonna miss facing free kills, the ret pallies, on battlegrounds.
---
The thing is, it is actually the *hardcore* guilds and players that will have an easier time making meme specs work. Feral DPS is a perfect example; there will be a handfull of people who will try to make it work and go farm maces all day just to prove a point, but that is a fairly hardcore proposition. It is casual raiding guilds where there is the most pressure to conform, not reinvent the wheel, use cookie-cutter specs and strats, etc.
---
Eh, idk man hundreds of people lagging at the same time probably isn’t an isolated incident.
---
I want to be optimistic as well, but Blizzard has sold their audience the short end of the stick multiple times and have come up short endlessly.
---
best video i've ever seen
---
Elon Musk's supposed goal is to get to mars by 2024 or w/e.   That ain't gonna happen either.
---
You are not walking in to MC and clearing it with some greens that you collected while speed leveling to 60.
---
Dragonmaw server! Though I don't remember your name going in TBC (I started at the start of TBC).
---
False. Boss damage and armor are quite a bit higher on pservers. Parry rate was lower, but its not a big deal. What will be a big deal is if the theory that you can get boss armor to 0 on classic is true, DPS will be hugely increased

He’s playing a character that some people find entertaining and they choose to pay him for the entertainment.

I love the aesthetic of the zone, although I'm not as big a fan of the layout. Still one of my favorite zones though.
---
heh, try getting a bounty on your head. it's the most exhilarating thing i've experienced lately. especially as a rogue.
---
Sure but if someone is asking "what do I even do" in a beta... its a good place to start.
---
Hahaha. Man I still put a little list on a sticky note and ponder it throughout the day. Inevitable cross something off only to add it back on.
---
I did the same thing, That was back when I had 2 accounts, I would take my low level alt through WC to get gear for lvl19 BGs and would invite other low levels to pull them through the instance, just random people that wanted to run the place or I saw needed gear.
---
This is a horrible idea. I can't see entire servers actually backing up a stream-sniping blacklist. Officers of a handful of streamer guilds and then the streamers themselves will avoid these players, but not really anyone else *IMO*.
---
If i need a player for a dungeon, especially at 60, i couldn't care at all whether or not they've camped Soda, Esfand or Asmon. Even if I'm in their guilds, even if i watch their streams, i just could not care at all. Some people will care, i won't be naïve, but i don't think that *enough* people will care for any real difference to be made. Especially with how many people are going to actively avoid streamer servers, including many fans of the streamers themselves.
---
Besides, we have all seen clips of how soda can be when he PVPs. How long will it be until some random player catches Soda in a bad mood and gets blacklisted. Camping is camping is camping, lets call a spade a spade. There is no elevated form of it. If you want to play classic WoW and you want to stream, you have to accept certain realities. You cannot brigade players to avoid this, the community will only tolerate it for so long. Like i said, even fans of these streamers are going to avoid their servers, and i myself am included (i only really watch Asmon though).
---
And how do you decipher between them and spawn campers? Or just someone that recognizes the name of a player on the opposing faction? This is what PvP servers are all about, not whining to the opposing faction that someone is killing you. You either want to play on a PvP server and broadcast your location to the world, or you don't.
---
How about the part where he says it's ok for him to camp people, but it's not ok for people to camp him because he's a streamer? Do you have the brain capacity to comprehend how outrageously hypocritical that is? Or do you want to suck on his teat some more?
---
Lvl 40 rogue and geared
---
Also home to Mia Rose, of the "Whorecraft" adult film. She was in my guild for several expansions cause we had enough officers who would boot anyone trying to cause drama.
---
Yeah, well personally I would love to see TBC after Classic so guess im biased hehe. Tbc was the perfect continuation after Classic Imo 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
They'll probably just nerf the gear in the first couple phases.
---
Having recently run gnomer with 2 Warlocks that thought Hellfire + Life Tap is the best way to go (while mobs are attacking them)...I assume he was talking about Hellfire.

LOL, this is so delusional

IRL celebs hire bodyguards. Maybe he needs to hire bodyguards for 1g/hr.
---
Whatever makes you sleep at night kid
---
No reference but its how it was on pservers. Im p sure you get the extra 5 to even out hit rate but cant get to the perfect 308
---
I had it on my hunter, but that was because all the warriors in our group didnt need it
---
&gt;We've all cherished our memories of this game for over a decade because we believed it to be punishingly difficult 
---
That is not why I cherish my memories of WoW. I cherish them because I had a fun time playing the game, playing with friends, and meeting a lot of interesting people.
---
&gt;But from new data it seems like the game is almost trivially easy.
---
What "new data"? I've played with people in the beta who can do Armory as a group of level 30s, and I've played with people in the beta who rage because of all the times they died to mobs while questing in Thousand Needles. Just because a group of "professional gamers" thinks the content is too easy does not mean that everyone thinks it is too easy.
---
If you're following someones guide step by step then of course you're going to find it easy and boring, just like if you looked up the answers to a crossword puzzle.
---
&gt;So what do we do if classic launches and the naysayers were right
---
We do nothing. The people who have fun will stay and the people who don't have fun will not. Classic WoW is for people who want Classic WoW. It should not be changed to appeal to people who do not enjoy Classic WoW.
---
It’s almost like it will make the game play as intended, a world of war(craft). 
---
Other than Swifty and a couple others these streamers didn’t even actually play vanilla.
---
Sounds like Soda should roll on a PvE server.
---
Ming raided in my guild for a bit in BWL. We all knew that he was more dedicated to PvP, but it definitely lit a fire in our regular roster rogues. Think he also had an alt warrior for a bit.
---
Discord?
---
I think the big dissagreement here is that blacklisting for streamsniping is not a good idea.
---
This was prior to a lot of things being figured out with fury
---
I have no idea what you’re talking as I never will watch another person play a video game.
---
Yep. When n.....dale launched, it wasn't hard to find BoEs on the AH. My first character at server launch, I bought Twig of the World Tree when I hit 53.
---
I think it could still be decent without, using some of the lifesteal proc weapons. Those scale 100% with spell power up until like wotlk.
---
Part of the job, if you can't deal with it, then find another job, just like anyone else who is fed up with theirs.
---
you wouldnt ninja from him directly. but anyone associated to him or any of his friends guilds. there will be TONS of people in these streamer guilds most of them wont be up to date on who is or isnt blacklisted
---
Yeah, exactly.  Everyone keeps saying how hybrids are bad in Vanilla, but they're like the most popular classes when you break it down per faction.
---
eh I think if streamers stick together on the same server I think they can influence the majority of the good guilds.
---
Yes hybrid DPS is way worse, but that’s because they bring more than just dps. It isn’t right to compare them to a rogue or warrior based solely on dps. If you bring the negatives then also bring the utility positives.
---
Nothing in life is hard if you grind long enough.
---
I used to always attack those giant elites thinking they'd drop huge loot.
---
Most people are really bad at the game. They don't even raid. When they mean the game is "hard", they mean actually leveling up is hard. Obviously it is a given that retail WoW has more challenging top-end content. But "difficulty" to them is when grammy wants to go collect rabbits pelts and accidentally aggros a Defias Pillager and gets killed because she doesn't know what kick or counterspell are.
---
I've been doing 1-20 runs for every class trying to narrow down my choices; can't really do it passed 20 as every level 60 on those servers just sits in 20-30 zones.
---
Every time I think I've decided on my main class, the next class I play takes its spot. I think the game is just fun, and I'll probably enjoy it no matter what class I end up as.
---
Easy of Leveling(Horde): Undead. Corpse are delicious.

Some people say...

Can you use the Xbox guitar hero controllers with it?
---
I really gonna miss my EU pals from the private servers. But fuck that, wir gehen wieder nach Hause. Rather have me some medium populated German realm than a overpopulated one where everyone wants to be a elitist.
---
Is Human's Sword/Mace specialization that much of an upgrade over NE's +1% dodge in PvE tanking role?
---
/s? cant tell if youre joking but soda is and was probably one of the biggest voices for classic servers in the first place. Without him advocating for classic and other streamers like him we wouldnt have a wow classic at all.
---
I’m on the beta, but this fucking job I have doesn’t let me play WoW all day...somehow I still find time to shitpost on reddit constantly
---
I support this and believe it is an excellent test of maturity. I'll get the popcorn.
---
Basically, yeah. This post assumes no other method of gold trading, or other games to trade to, was available in the actual Vanilla days. Which is false.
---
Just because one WoW is "Retail" and one is "Classic" doesn't mean suddenly new gold trading avenues are created that never existed before. Cross-game trading (or real-money gold trading) has existed forever.
---
I just want better bags
---
Because it's too much power and they have a responsibility because of it. You're comparing the aggregate actions of hundreds, (old vanilla server populations that would make those ignore lists you mentioned), to a handful, (streamers). Being able to organically gain a bad reputation and being blacklisted is positive feature of vanilla that people want back, being targeted by a dude with thousands of fans is an instant execution. I don't watch streamers but god-forbid I unwittingly camp one one day and become blacklisted.
---
I really hope all the popular streamers stick to one server. I just want to play the game to go on an adventure, make friends, gank a few people, and get ganked too along the way, it's all in good fun. Some of these streamers are really toxic and want to run the game, that's just silly.  :(
---
Healing in BG's is a blast, I play feral druid primarily, and I do heal in bg's often enough because heals can turn the tide of battle quickly. And if everyone is good on health and we are just needing to chase down the stragglers or cut off reinforcements, cranking out damage is great.
---
So yeah shaman would be my best choice, hybrids are really strong because they aren't pinned down to just being a DPS. Few heals (even if they aren't the strongest) is better than nothing!
---
But the gold would still be in each citys economy. Its not leaving it. Its just exchanging between 2 people.
---
There are people with jobs that basically let you play at work.
---
Wut
---
It's going to cost more resources and development time. Does blizzard want to commit that to classic. Will that mean pulling resources from retail? How successful will classic even be to justify it.
---
Realistically classic wont beat retail in popularity. Retail has 15 years of history keeping people  playing. Itd also much more catered to today's market. Fact is classic is niche within the mmo niche. 
---
So the balance of resources are important and we're going to wait and  see what blizzard does. It's not It's not so simple as to just expand the team. Lots of things to consider
---
&gt; the benefits of having streamers (who by the way curated and pushed forward the movement for these servers on top of the private server scene) 
---
These BFA streamers did absolutely jack shit. Classic WoW is a direct result of the Nostalrius shutdown and the petition that got signed by over 100k people.
---
Well that would be griefing and against TOS. What he is suggesting is that anyone who wants to engage him in PvP while he's streaming and uses that info to find him should be blacklisted.... 
---
Which is just absurd.
---
Them: "what does your class do?"
---
Druids: "EVERYTHING!"
---
All terrain class. (INCLUDING WATER!)
---
Hahaha I have done this exact same thing! Except I was an orc hunter
---
This subreddit has a serious problem
---
How exactly are Retris are a burden? Even if we don't have the same damage as a warrior (when considering equal gear and skill) - and I'll be the first to admit that - we are still close, and we bring so much to a raid. We have the best BoM's in the raids since no Holies spec into it, the basic Paladin utility(bubbles, lay, DI, blessings, auras, heals, magic cleansing), melees actually benefitting from your resistance auras because you are close to them, and quite some gear won't get vendored / disenchanted because Retris can actually make use of them.
---
If I was a Guild Master in an extremely hardcore guild, I would rather take a Retri who puts in his A game every time than a Warrior who puts in his A game every time. It's not just "you dps, you tank, you heal", you also have to count in utility. Compare that to a Fury Warrior, they only have Battle Shout, meanwhile, compared to that, we can provide: THE best BoM, BoS, BoW and BoL if there are not enough Holy Paladins in the raid.
---
There will definitely be server transfers available in classic as confirmed by Blizzard.  I believe it was an interview with Omar where he discussed how they put it in the in game shop and they aren't recreating the website that was available for server transfers in vanilla.
---
 Look what happened to pubg many players got banned that didn't even streamsnipe for streamsniping
---
Can you state what you actually think will happen rather than talking in shitty similes and metaphors?
---
I wonder if blizzard is gonna weigh in on this shitshow at some point. They should have dedicated streamer servers.
---
Did they have profession restrictions per class back in the day? I was 11/12 when I was playing late Vanilla and I don't recall this. Granted I only made it to mid 40's on my Lock before I discovered Pservers lol
---
Is there data out there? I wouldn't be surprised if donations played a bigger part than subs.
---
the only problem with what sodapoppin is suggesting is blindly trusting each party on the black listing since of the agreement.
---
i mean if i am streamer and i hear about a guy on my side of the faction is a massiv stream sniper of an other big guy i am not going to want to play with him so after checking things out i put him on my ignore list and go on stream to tell other people do the same.
---
From my experience, going hard for the first ~48 hours on release will put you far enough past the bulk of the wave that you won't have to compete for spawns much anymore. And from the stress/test beta and a little of my pserver time, I feel pservers values make things a little tougher than they were if we assume classic is 1:1 with original release.
---
There are definitely groups out there that have been jumping from fresh server to fresh server for years that can and will get their 1-60 very quickly.
---
I've been through, no joke, 5 razer Nagas since I started gaming in Cata. Completely game changing for literally any games. Weapon swapping, skills, abilities, you name it.
---
Over time the snapdomes within the buttons will wear down. I used to bind ice lance to '2' on my mouse, and over like a year of playing Legion the 2 button wore out. Open the mouse, swap buttons 2 and a lesser used one like 12 Then youre good to go.
---
Happy you liked it man, much appreciated :D
---
You're salty as fuck dude. Imagine being so bored that you have time to actually hate streamers.
---
If all the streamers want to get together and blacklist people who spend their whole day trying to ruin theirs, fuck it idc. No skin off my back, as I'd actually be busy playing the game instead of spending my energy hating someone so much that I'd streamsnipe them all day or make salty reddit threads.
---
True, I remember ganking and being ganked people talking crap on the forums with each other. Meeting each other in the world or in BGs and having a fixated target on each other to try and get one up on each other.
---
But it was all in good fun, talking with them over vent. Meeting some of them IRL. 
---
None of what we did to each other in game was ever seen as being personal or had any animosity towards anyone. 
---
Unless you ninja'd something, then you were a dick.
---
tbf feral wolfshead specc is known for years tho. i think we can say that we know a good amount of the frame of what is possible and what not.
---
Autistic?
---
As long as some scrub is actually sitting behind a computer and farming/earning that Classic gold, there will be no problem.
---
However if it's going to be botting 2.0 as it was with gold farmers in Vanilla, then this could become an issue. However Blizz only needs to fight the bots (or any other actual cheats).
---
Like I mentioned already, the original PvP gear wasn't that powerful. It was upgraded in patch 1.11 (Naxx release) and that's the version we'll have from the start. Instead of the stats that they originally had up until Naxx, the sets will have the stats they had post-Naxx. From the beginning.
---
Right so it already changes the pserver meta but that doesn’t matter cause it’s the hybrids you were talking about?
---
It will. You’ll see when classic bits that pservers have a lot more off than you’re willing to admit.
---
You underestimate the no-lifers.
---
Ah my bad, I thought it was revered for the regular water too.
---
When I was 17, I met a kid in-game who lives in New Zealand, and he became one of my closest friends before we ever met face-to-face.  
---
I'm not sure that it's possible to do that in 2019, but I wish him the best of luck
---
no one in this thread? have you seen the posts here? the people here have no jobs and breathe WoW lol
---
I just want to play with my RL friends and raid/PVP casually as a Shadow Priest when I can (Willing to heal anything, but would prefer to be a gimped DPS). I'm in no hurry to accomplish anything; I just want to have fun. I'm looking forward to maxing out Alchemy again, too.
---
It’s about the circumvention of the faction border. You can be an utter jackass to the opposing faction, but still be good to your faction. Creating a blacklist to exclude players from content in this way would take the community out of the reputation players has for themselves and make it into a popularity contest for who is allowed to play the game. This is especially true for if someone is a dick one day, then gets off and decides to be agreeable from then on, they aren’t blacklisted from a guild or a spot. They get on and they’re blacklisted from playing. Additionally, this would let Chance be the arbiter of who was a stream sniper, meaning that you could be minding your own business getting gear, see a person from the other faction on the horizon, decide to kill them, and then never be able to raid because Chance decided it was targeted rather than some random dude. Reputation is communal, a blacklist should be kept personal or within a guild unless what the person is doing is particularly egregious and repeated in a widespread manner (such as ninjalooting from multiple guilds). Even then, it just becomes common knowledge that the person sucks and a given person who talks to the asshole isn’t locked into saying no or yes like the idea is with a blacklist.
---
Well it’s just awesome to be playing and see someone else and think “I wish I could do that” because at the same time, if the tables were reversed, I’d still be thinking that same way,
---
&gt; I'm curious to see if it gets tested more with on proc items that benefit spell power or enchants like life stealing.
---
Already been done, but only like 1% of players will get to do it due to having to take items from most other classes.
---
Stream snipers shouldn't get banned lol.  It's Classic WoW man, that's how shit is.  Put yourself on an hour delay and level faster. 
---
I do think people should get banned for EXCESSIVE griefing though.  If 20 people are standing around him killing him for hours, they should probably do something about it.  Not a ban, per say, but maybe port him out or something.  This goes for anyone though.
---
I like to use bongos so that my action buttons are in a matching 3x4 grid.
---
My old GM was the one calling hunter weapon =(
---
Literally just 'That's mine'd Betrayer of Humanity (Wrath) from my Fury warrior...
---
Then got pissed when I outbid her for the ranged wep Kel dropped the following week.
---
I don't think so, no. I expect he means repeatedly doing the above. Anyway, who knows what he meant, as he didn't say clearly on the topic of what he would consider sniping Vs not.
---
I can attest that this can be stressful when done too long.. I’m not sure about the making millions of dollars part though
---
Exactly. The community. Not some asshole and his friends of more assholes that have a religious following. God I am thankful I am not from NA and wont have to deal with that crap.
---
It wasn't hard, just more time consuming, people can easily get those mixed up.
---
I'll admit I didn't use keybinds until level 50 or so, everyone was new to wow and a lot of those people were new to mmorpgs in general
---
I personally only use 1-6. This let's me do like what's in OPs screenshot, except the main action bar is 1-6 and then shift1-6.
---
I had to look up what stream sniping is. Your comment is all that this is about.
---
What does it mean to be blacklisted by a streamer?
---
EQ wasn't "hard" either. No MMO is really all that "hard." They are always just grind-based "difficulty."
---
Writing a good book, that's hard. Loving your neighbor, that's hard. Mining coal for a living, that's hard.
---
No MMO ever in the world was or will be hard.
---
Good news! You might die tomorrow afternoon from a brain aneurysm you didn't even know about!
---
Streamsniping is doing something unintended by using outside resources to find players instead of naturally coming across them.
---
Camping is an age-old tactic for multiplayer PvP games to "conquer" an area.
---
I hate the celebrity-ism around streamers but streamsniping them is far worse than camping because they'd be at risk of endless griefing by any/all players watching them, not just one camper.
---
IKR, you could use them for typing numbers into a spreadsheet.
---
All posts of streamers on this sub becomes a massive circlejerk against a someone, probably because they think they are more entitled to a beta key than the streamers or something like that.
---
So you want to force people to play with you, even if you act like a dick to their friends? That's not how classic worked.
---
Don't be a dick and you won't end up on anyones shitlists
---
This is next level streamer obsession...
---
I really do hope that Blizzard or the streamers get together and try to designate certain servers as streamer servers, so naturally the streamers and fanboys will flock there. I’m going to be extremely PO’ed when Asmon or Soda accidentally slips about what server they are on and it’s my server and I already have a level 40+......
---
I think you're underestimating the fact that people have been playing Vanilla for the same amount of hours, without getting paid, just for the heck of it.
---
Oh man, 1v1ing a pally is intense, we used to say it was a 3 stage boss fight.
---
that's not true... at all
---
Retris are kind of a wildcard. They need RNG, but also a lot of retris build their class so bad- which contributes to why they are treated as a meme. Most of them completely skip over agility and crit, which is essential. It's an RNG spec, but with skill + engi, even if you dont have good RNG, you'll see kills. Oh, and, you'll also miss the braindead Orc random stun resists :p
---
The only bad things about Paladins is that they're the worst class in terms of leveling speed, and if you want to raid you're going to be healing. Retribution is good in PvP, Holy pallies are the best healers in PvP &amp; best tank healers in PvE, and Prot pallies make perfectly viable tanks for 5 man content. Paladins bring soooo much utility. Everybody loves having Paladin friends and guildmates. They have the best class lore and all their armor sets are cool as fuck.
---
Well questing in vanilla does suck so I can see why you grind. It started getting much better in TBC, especially since you actually got decent items.
---
&gt;  Soda wants to play on a PvP server, and socially bully the WoW community to cater towards streamers like himself.
---
Yeah, that's not happening. That's not even remotely the PVP mindset. I'll be rolling PVE (probably), but I've levelled a char to max on a PVP server and "If it's red it's dead" was absolutely the mantra we lived (and died) by.
---
The opposing faction is not going to give a rats arse about his so-called Black List.
---
"Hordies Iganksoda keeps stream sniping me you have to black list them!" - Can you imagine how well that will go down in Org? Iganksoda would be swimming in gold.
---
This is why it's impossible to have good faith conversations about MacBooks.

&gt; very similar to macbook pro

3-generations-old processor, 1080p display, half the RAM, no discrete GPU...

To get anything comparable you have to look at the Odyssey Z series, which start at $1800 MSRP.
---
&gt;If I was a Guild Master in an extremely hardcore guild, I would rather take a Retri who puts in his A game every time than a Warrior who puts in his A game every time.
---
Thats probably why you're not a guild master in a hardcore guild. If everyone is putting in 100% a Warrior is just an objectively better option. 
---
Ret just isn't good. You can make it work, you can clear content as a Ret paladin; its all been done on pservers. You can also clear all the content as a Balance Druid if you want to be carried. But if you're trying to min-max a run, you're not bringing one.

I've used this one for years. Great price here for one! Also the hyper x headsets are fantastic for the price. Clouds 1 And 2 and flights are great
---
Thats not really the reason. German is im pretty sure the most spoken language in europe (natively ofc, in total its english). Besides being a wealthy country. There is money to be made by having german realms, more so than any other european language besides english. It was never a factor who can speak which language, its all about where the most money will be made.
---
I don't follow at all. You said fury offtank doesn't work because of parry haste.
---
I don't know whether fear really resets threat (it can't, or you would never be able to catch up and get aggro back. But I bet it temporarily drops threat while feared!) in vanilla, but I'll assume you are correct. I still feel that doesn't explain what you're talking about...
---
Taunt does put you at the top of the threat meter, but I think that may be a moot point as many bosses are taunt immune.
---
Nobody dual wielding will be hitting the face of the boss, thus there will be no parries... The bosses can only parry attacks that come from their front.
---
If you have a fury off tank, he will only stand in front of the boss when he is tanking, no?
---
I think it's a pretty smart solution to griefers, if you act like shit then your rep on the server is gonna be shit.
---
A simple way to avoid this problem: Don't play on the same server or don't streamsnipe constantly.
---
You also have higher crit, slightly higher armour with barb, and a bit more dodge. 20 health and 6 damage on your raptor strike won't make as much of a difference as the better stats on barb.
---
I kept a notepad file of the same two lists.
---
omega lol
---
Google have them all
---
TIL those guilds play on german realms /s
---
A lot of players want exactly that though. Just vanilla. After max it's done, they go level something else. Again, cant please everyone ever so just wait and see.
---
It's almost like they wanted to test their servers, put it at capacity and find the bugs during a stress test and not at launch...
---
I don't want to wait but at the same, waiting is giving me time to get a new set up together
---
My first time through black fathom deeps was on a potato of a computer, and through a combination of fps issues, latency, and my keyboard turning I couldn't make those jumps for the life of me. We probably spent a good 30+ minutes trying to get me across.
---
Not even the smallest chance of this ever happening so why spend your time and energy by getting upset over it? It's just as ridiculous like Soda's suggestion.
---
Yeah i might have translated it incorrectly, and meant classes. That would make more sense i guess
---
The blacklist idea is dumb and will not work, those two clowns won't have a fraction of the pull they think they will in live. Most of the current following won't care to support when they never get into raids, they will be to busy joining and forming new guilds.
---
Well I do but that has nothing to do with my dislike for the over exaggeration of streamers.
---
It's like being blacklisted from Narnia
---
Yes. +1 dodge is very weak. You’d probably take +5 wep skill over +5% dodge as a high end MT.
---
Insinuating that Sodapoppins large influence didn’t matter when that petition was going around is just plain ignorant my man, I’m not a huge fan of the guy and it makes me sound weird reassuring that but when someone like that uses their influence for a good cause like this they deserve praise, unfortunately, this subreddit and people such as yourself lack the maturity to understand that.
---
Regret not doing that. Can only find screenshots back to 2009, anything before that is lost on some old hardrive.  
---
At least this time around I'll put everything in cloud storage
---
dat tabard son
---
How so? Because I'm not 12?
---
I do not think that raids will be that hard really. Bringing 20/40 people together might be harder tham the raid itself, thats what my last argument was based on
---
Actually, this one I'm having trouble finding.
---
Says the 12 year old.
---
Level 30 will give you a much better indication about how a class will be. You will have most of your trainable abilities at that point, and you can get a 21 point talent which is often the defining feature for a particular spec.
---
It's like people never learnt that the apostrophe just takes the place of the missing letter.
---
#nobody cares
---
Dont hate the player, hate the game. If they are worried about stream sniping they can make it so whatever is showing live is already pre recorded 30 mins or so in the past, but i guess that isnt an option for a pampered streamer
---
Now here is a real unpopular opinion.
---
It requires MCP farming which is a neverending grind only the sweatiest of neckbeards will be able to stand
---
I know, he know eveyone knows. He's just speaking about the frustrations of being a streamer that many people overlook and says he wish it wasn't like that. Of course he can deal with it he has for all this time.
---
I'm not sure whether to call it pretentious. The opinion of many game companies however is that bad experiences with chats can scare off newer players. If you add a chat and not add a reporting system then some will complain as well. So basically you're adding a bunch of costs to the game for a feature that might just scare off players.
---
Worst part is that someone can walk up to the guys funding the games and give exact numbers on just how much they're spending extra on customer support. In contrast, nobody is able to give any numbers for how much impact a chat has on longevity/appeal. It's a fight between abstract numbers and concrete numbers, the winner is obvious even if it isn't necessarily correct.
---
Although i agree that the red menace must be countered, the thumbnail is a photoshop
---
Not even remotely the same lol
---
i wasnt even planning on playing classic but soda just gave me a reason to resub, ill be looking for your guild haha
---
im not playing on their server regardless.
---
im saying the people who will pay for this in the negatives is everyone but the streamers. and most people being on that list wont be for streamsniping itll be for just random pvp that they claim is streamsniping. people have already gotten banned for it
---
Adding games to my Steam wish list in anticipation of the upcoming summer sale.
---
Stream snipers use a 3rd party resource to do their dirty work.
---
Campers are natural.
---
I firmly believe that WoW became so popular because it was so much easier than other MMOs at the time. I played EQ2 before WoW, one of my quests involved killing a mob on a FORTY EIGHT HOUR spawn timer that had a 30% chance to drop the quest item. I wasn't a raider or anything, this was just a regular high level quest. You couldn't even get to max level in that game without a group, soloing was next to impossible after a certain level. And ALL of the people I know who played EQ1 and EQ2 say that EQ2 was a cakewalk compared to it's predecessor. 
---
And then here comes Warcraft. You can easily solo your way to max level and quest mobs are readily available. You don't have to wait 45 minutes for the boat to cross the ocean, just 5 minutes max. The dungeons only required 5 people. I distinctly remember being constantly amazed by how easy the game was. It felt so much more accessible than the MMOs that came before it. 
---
But when you compare classic WoW to current MMOs, I can understand why people who didn't experience MMOs before WoW consider classic hard. Now we're used to having cross server dungeon finders and multiple difficulty levels for most raids/dungeons. 
---
Of course a lot of it is that the player base as a whole is better now than it was when WoW came out too. I played a rogue in classic and always just assumed I was doing it right until one day a guild member linked a damage meter and I was near the bottom. I didn't even know what a damage meter was before that, the idea of trying to max my damage output just hadn't occurred to me. It seems stupid now, but at the time the mobs were dying so I thought I was good. I'm sure many others went through something similar. 
---
So I do think dungeons and leveling in classic are harder than retail, but probably not the raids. I don't play retail so it's hard to compare, but I remember the raid mechanics in classic being fairly simple. There were other difficulties back then though, the internet sucked and so did our computers! I remember rethinking our strategy for certain fights because we knew our MT was going to DC. Things like this aren't any issue any more and it means that Blizz can design more difficult fights. 
---
TL;DR I agree that raiding is harder now, but I do think the leveling and dungeons were more complicated in classic than they are in retail.
---
Yikes. We went from “stream snipping” to “steaming their node”. 
---
Griefing is against the ToS. I highly doubt any streamer will want to do that with tens of thousands of people watching. 
---
Do you have a list of the streamers he is working with? Do you know how many of them are alliance?
---
He doesn't mind getting ganked, he does mind getting streamsniped.
---
Sounds like you want to play BFA if you don't like there being consequences for your actions
---
shit players trying to boost themselves up  
---
they think retail is easier because they never stepped out of LFR yet complain about it
---
I haven't watched the video yet. But what does one expect. There were no streamers in Vanilla. In classic, you are going to constantly broadcast your position to everyone as a streamer. Even if there aren't gankers, you are going to have people that just constantly follow big streamers around. I plan on playing a PvP server, but honestly, if I were a streamer. I would probably play PvE, just so I could get things done.
---
Don't forget, server rep matters. And progression can take a while. If you are an ass on your server. You will quickly find no one wants to play or associate with you. I cant wait for that aspect to come into play again.
---
Mods, please ban this shit. We should have like a different subreddit for this stuff.
---
Dragonmaw was the SHIT!!
---
oh man! i remember this!
---
Casters have very VERY basic rotations traditionally, Mage - frostbolt spam, Warlock - shadowbolt spam. Debuff limit sucks for this, so there's not much wiggle room unfortunately.
---
You probably want to be looking towards a rogue. They do have a decent amount of abilities, mostly revolving around keeping slice and dice up, while using other abilities for combo generation.
---
Or play a healer, you will never be bored when you're playing wak-a-mole with people's lives.
---
Everyone complains about how this sub hates on streamers but when I give a valid reason why I dislike them I get hated on. 
---
I guess this sub just hates everything.
---
Doesnt help you when you lack dps. You act like nobody has ever thought about it.
---
Aiden, Brayden, Hayden, Zhaiden, Kaiden
---
It's because a lot of people take offense to anything other than literally worshipping a 15 year old game and close their ears about retail because they don't like some aspects of it.
---
Naxx wasnt hard, you learn mechanics just like anything else you want to do, what was "hard" was investing time in getting gear for it.
---
People on this sub mostly only see dps numbers. I agree with you, but it won’t change minds here. :/
---
&gt;most people being on that list wont be for streamsniping itll be for just random pvp that they claim is streamsniping
---
proof?
---
&gt;people have already gotten banned for it
---
who?
---
I had the Orc model but with Dwarf texture on it at one point... Now that was some creepy stuff.
---
That didn't answer the question at all.
---
People organizing raids on the opposite faction is absolutely not anything like somebody having 24/7 bodyguards that give them whatever they need. I don't understand what you're trying to prove here.
---
WE ARE THE PEOPLE
---
Weapon normalization doesn't work for MS/SS/etc I thought, it's just (swing damage + bonus) modified by AP? I.e., swing damage is very important even in 1.12
---
Imagine streaming your every move on a PVP server and then complaining when you get killed. Jesus.
---
Every class to 60 is only about 45-56 days /played depending how quickly you level.
---
&gt;don't get mad if they try to stop you by talking to their friends etc so your rep on the server will be bad. Fair game. .
---
Then I say one simple phrase to the streamers... "git gud"
---
That just sounds childish so I doubt that's going to be an issue for streamers tbh. Unless they're somehow ruining other people's experiences but unless you go out of your way to be mad that streamers exist I don't see how they'd do that
---
*At launch.*
---
I wouldn't be surprised if after a while they want to capitalize on their returning players and sell race/faction/server changes.
---
Please don't think I'm advocating this, I am not. I'm just saying corporations are fucking scummy and if they eventually do this it wouldn't be the least bit surprising.
---
Dragonmaw had some legit well known PvPers back in the day. Grievous the paladin, Zizek the undead priest off the top of my head.
---
I've heard a lot of people talk about Germans being worse at english compared to other Europeans due to dubbed television. That is just not true, Germans are among the best in Europe, when it comes to english as a second language, only the Nordic countries, the Dutch and Luxemburg scores higher.
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who loves Tanaris and ZF. I honestly never knew what it was about that zone and instance, but I always looked forward to hitting 40 so I could run it and quest there. 
---
It was also a pretty hot wpvp spot on my server so that was always something to look forward to.
---
Reflection. Thought it was censored.
---
He never says that it's not okay for others to camp him.

He suggests a server where the comunnity agrees that it is not okay to specifically streamsnipe. To streamsnipe is to watch a stream and use that information to do harm, by say camping him. Obviously it can be difficult to know whether it's just him being camped by a random indiviual unknowing of his stream, or if it's actually streamsniping, but trust me most streamsnipers make it clear what their intend is.
---
It’s hard to compare.. In any game where you play against other players you’re only as good as your competition allows you to be. A high level MOBA match can be one sided and piss easy so can a CS match and so can a high level Starcraft match. 
---
Mythic raiding is honestly very difficult before any of the nerfs start to roll out and you start to overgear. If you wipe 100+ times on the same boss I would consider that pretty difficult maybe not for individual skill as for me personally if I don’t have any important responsibility go on auto pilot after 20-30 tries. It’s hard to coordinate and make 20 people react and dodge mechanics, do the freaking tactics and still play optimally.
---
Blacklist me, I’m coming for your heads streamers!
---
I totally agree.  and on another note, I like having social dynamics in the game.
---
what  I don't want is streamers to have too much control.  they already have sperg armies which do their bidding.  
---
I want Soda to send an emissary to my guild, and request that we blacklist 3 members in our guild,  Then, I want my GM to make an actual guild decision, without it having to be Soda's decision.  I would be happy if my GM held a guild voting to see if we blacklist our own guild members.  and then I would LOVE for the guild I am in to respond to Soda with "QQ grow up, we like playing with these people.  you're not in our guild, and you don't deserve to participate in our Guild Politics".
---
I’m sorry but most of them actually did, Soda is one of them
---
And all the extra help they get from fanboys following them around doesn't count as special treatment?
---
For the most part I think it should be pretty clear who is and isn't a stream sniper tho
---
I mean, if you don't like to be killed by other players in general, play on a pve realm. Shouldn't be hard for them to have players guarding them if necessary  and maybe it turns out to be funny and rewarding for them to have big fights on stream on regular basis. Isn't that why you go for a pvp realm in the first place? Being hunted down constantly isn't fun and I can understand why you  would get frustrated quickly, but it is how it is, there will not be anything they can do outside of the game itself.
---
Soda’s a fuckin’ whiner man. He was whining about shit back in project 60 like this too.
---
devs play shamans
---
Anything from Oxhorn.
---
Nobody is doing Deadmines with a group of level 10s and 12s what the fuck
---
Examples?
---
I think it required an add-on utilize a powershifting macro due to its size similar to other complex macros at the time. 
---
I would paste the macro here as an example but it's massive, I'm sure an original powershifting macro can be found on Shedo's list / other druid guides if anyone is interested. 
---
I'm so glad that the modern macro system is implemented, I didn't know prior to this post. Thank you for the heads up OP.
---
what kind of a psychopath has a geared out level 60 and no alts?
---
Just flexing his beta access.
---
Can confirm. We used to be a group of four friends playing alliance. 4 of us started as rogues and one was picking a gnome mage. We used to go to sw and use the gnome as bait. Whenever a hordi tried to gank him he would instantly pop iceblock and four rogues would jump on the poor horde guy. Btw gnome was not wearing startet gear just for the lolz. Good times
---
There is a difference between ganking someone in-game, without any extra information, and ganking someone who's position you'll be able to see all the time.
---
Everyone who's ganking someone in the way you're suggesting is going to get banned.  
---
If not, you're wasting your time to make thousands of people feel worse.
---
The stuff that the streamers do for content (pulling skull elites into the cities, PvP events, random bulks of people, ...) is what made WoW interesting and great. 
---
I'd love to have them on my server. Even if I wasn't watching them.
---
Why are you (going to be) on their server anyways?
---
I'm not entirely sure, but I might have experienced a bug during the stress test. Reported it, but never got confirmation from Blizzard. Curious to hear your thoughts.
---
In my memory, I could always hear /emotes from other players in Vanilla while standing at the appropriate range. Even when these players were not in your party.
---
I was literary walking the exact same path, on top of another player, who I could tell from the mime was spam /train emoting. I confirmed with the player that he was, but I could not hear the "choo choo" sounds.
---
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to test other emotes. Any of you experienced the same thing? Think this actually is a bug?
---
Gold farmers were pseudo-celebrities and were constantly snipe/gank/camped by opposing factions.  They were also from China.  I also ran instance groups made up of 3 farmers, me (tank)  and my China friend (healer) who translated loot rules (ninja looting gets you banned from our ez money train).  We even fed some of them epics in raid so we can gear them to smash loot farming easier so we had ez cash flow for more raiding.  
---
The failed white knight failed.
---
Yeah that'll be something I need to research.. Assuming it's similar to catweaving as resto in live. I've laid claim, hopefully it sticks once classic goes live!
---
Honestly I love WoW's graphics, even the old vanilla zones such as Mulgore still hold up to me.
---
That being said I did play Morrowind recently without graphical mods, so maybe I'm not the best judge.
---
&gt;Broadcast all information regarding your gameplay to the word
---
&gt;Complain that someone uses that information against you
---
 I'm out of the loop, what's happening?
---
I really hope you're right.  I like this game, I want everyone to have fun.
---
streamers don't need to stream.  it's a voluntary choice, and they make a lot more money than I do haha.  streamers playing 16 hours a day is literally something that I cannot possibly compete with.  nor can any normal human.
---
If they're on a pvp server and streaming and get sniped that's their own fault for giving away their position.
---
It's like live streaming CSGO and having your opponent watch your stream to see where you are. You're giving the competition an advantage by doing so.
---
I made a mage for the sole purpose of aoe farming cloth to sell on the AH.  Made some serious bank.
---
Stream sniping is a fucking cowardly way to play a PvP based game. But to literally blacklist and not allow them to play because some streamer gets camped because he has a love, active, gps reading for thousands of people to see, is super elitist and entitlement that deserves to be camped even more. I like soda, been a lurker since he started up, but his opinions on subjects like this are just so right wing that it’s difficult to agree with him on it.
---
I won't join such a guild because I already have my own, but I will definitely join in their hunts for streamers.
---
it doesnt matter who IS or ISNT if they run the list. everyone who ganks them in world pvp they claim is sniping both soda and asmon.
---
I’d say osrs was pretty similar they released it as a new game and everyone started at lvl 3 (their beginning lvl) and everything started at scratch. Any character you had prior to the release was now on “runescape” aka rs3 aka the version that killed what runescape (classic-runescape2) was. 
---
Obviously it never had as many players as wow once did but it’s the origin of inspiration for classic and proved it could be done re releasing an older version of a game that was considered to be dead. Except they went the patch 1.13 route and slowly released new content based off community polls.
---
At the beginning of osrs everyone was anti change much like it is here with classic, and slowly as time went on people liked the idea of small changes and that snowballed into what it is today, where they have multiple things including items/quests/raids(not like wow raids they’re basically 5 man dungeons in wow) 
---
Id be interested to see if the community has a shift in allowing certain changes over time, the osrs community is much smaller and has more dedicated players and not as many casual players so I think it’s easier for the polls to accurately represent the players there
---
Were they better around 2004 :o?
---
How about he gives me all the money, have his entire stream camp me and he can play the game!
---
Imagine not knowing that you don’t need a stream for someone to track whatever zone you’re in on a toon of the same faction to find where you generally are and camp you
---
Brown linen robe
---
R for me
---
Especially because I'm 100% sure most of them haven't even played Vanilla or private servers (even though they are not the best reference due to lacking proper knowledge), all they did is just read up 2 guides or heard from people who actually played Vanilla. I'll be the first to admit, up until 1.10 retris were horrifyingly bad. But since we are running on a fixed patch (1.12), retributions have become quite good.
---
dude I know!   I am really hoping that the WoW community stands up and polices itself.
---
similarly, I also love how Summit1G is protected by the ooga crew or whatever they are called.  I like that!  I just don't want Streamers to think of themselves as gods.  They are mortal.  we shall demonstrate that to them.  over and over.  until the switch to PvE servers.
---
He's not afraid of getting ganked. He doesn't want to get ganked and you be able to see his every move even when he's in stealth. Basically he wants a fair fight. Or as fair as a gank can be.  He's explained this too.
---
Who do paladins need a guide? Just bubble hearth your problems away
---
We started a discord group of people who were big in our server's pvp scene back in vanilla. People who havent touched wow since BC/Wrath are chatting it up and the server is lively and a lot of fun. While I like coming here for the memes and information, speaking with folks I havent spoken with in over a decade has been incredibly fun. It really helps with the waiting when you have 10 years of catching up to do.
---
I would advise doing the same - reach out to some old WoW friends if you've kept any contact method open.
---
It's easy, but people want to get through Molten Core for the 85th time in 1 hour not 2 hours
---
I suspect that if blacklists get formed with the original intent of only putting stream snipers on the list some streamers will abuse that list and put people that didn't stream snipe on the list.
---
I don't have a list of streamers that would participate in the blacklisting Admin. Soda doesn't have a blacklist yet, right? It's Beta....
---
This is all hypothetical so step into the hypothetical my man. You think it'd be acceptable for streamers to work together to damage other players because of slights imagined or real? You think every name that gets put on this theoretical blacklist will have solid evidence of stream sniping? C'mon  man - nobody is being mean to Soda here. What he suggested was a bad idea.
---
To rattle all of the rogues in the guild when you keep talking about how you can't wait to get Perdition's Blade to complement your firestone spec.
---
Yeah, there was the interview with ion and I forget the women's name that said it's possible for server transfers depending on what people think or something like that
---
Yea we definitely know Acti-Blizz will never turn down that sweet, sweet MTX $$$. I won't be surprised either if paid services find their way into classic but I really hope they don't.
---
MG horde goon here.  did level as alliance for a bit with you guys, though.
---
Hey, the goldshire dog memes were the golden age as far as im concerned!
---
armies of turbovirgins surrounding them
---
https://vanillamage.com/pvp-frost-spec/
---
Hey just a quick question, are you 12 years old?
---
You think English eu realm will be playable from US?
---
Look, all everyone is telling you in this thread is, don't set yourself up for disappointment. A raid leader is not putting you on boss as an enhance in 19 out of 20 or more guilds. Fair warning. These problems are not made-up.
---
They are already alienating current fans. Not everyone who wants classic quit at the same time. Not everyone who wants classic quit. Look at the flying debate. They had to find a middle ground because the community even on the live game is split on this kind of stuff.
---
My point is that separate realms will allow them to make strong design decisions in both directions.
---
So their job should be at risk because somebody else wants to cheat?
---
Yeah, virginity status is definitely something twelve year olds talk about.  You got me.  I've been found out.  Sick burn.
---
Pretty sure some kind of server transfers came late vanilla? My server had a new guild appear during Naxx progress.
---
I plan on Multiboxing 5 Shamans 
---
I cant wait to just own people in world PvP till a raid group is formed to camp me.
---
I plan on doing Dungons by myself with the full Shaman team as well I expect it to get hard with the lack of CC and the need to tank as a Shaman.
---
I always wanted to Multibox back in BC when I discovered it was possible.  Sadly I didn't have the income back then.  But now I do! I am currently setting it up on retail as a test run to figure things out.
---
It half works the way you describe. It is like mirror servers on top of one another but it's designed to reduce the total players but not by zone. Sharding would reduce the players in let's say Durotar buy sharding will check spread them across the whole planet even though it will be all in three zones. It's not going to help day 1 issues.
---
I really can't imagine wasting monitor space and bandwidth to keep 24/7 tabs on internet celebrities to camp their characters. I don't care about streamers and I'd kill them if I saw them while leveling, but stalking people is just dumb.
---
"I'D pUt $25-50$ a MoNth" we got our retard of the month
---
Yikes, the sub for those doomed to mediocrity.
---
Well, maybe Spelladin has a chance, actually.
---
Of course. They make a lot money on services, makes no sense to not add it.
---
This is a fact. I’ve played both extensively and mythic raiding is significantly harder than even naxx. People act like classic leveling is harder when its just a longer, mindless experience
---
It's because you can't. Seriously. Unless it's like he's in stealth in bumfuck nowhere, you can't have an obvious "he's sniping" answer.
---
There’s a difference between carrying a friend of yours who you know and enjoy playing with and choosing between two pugs when one is meta and the other is a mediocre hybrid spec.
---
I once did this just to show off to friends in middle school. Picture a little nerdy kid showing a full print out like this of his character so proudly! lol
---
It was spores from one of the Oasis around there. The quest came from the apothecary
---
Yeah and I was just saying what I saw during the test, if all they were testing was 400-500 people in one zone then that’s a bit concerning to me and I feel like it should be a bigger concern but meh, Reddit isn’t made for actual discussions.
---
That's like saying your ferarri can't fit more than 2 people so good luck fitting more than 2 in your mini van. Current servers aren't designed to handle 3-4 raids in one zone, Classic is.
---
Don't worry,  they will pay their taxes come classic
---
Oh yeah on twitch, streamsniping is against TOS because it ruins games which is fair. I'm guessing you have no proof on that first point you made?
---
Soda just won a free stream snipe from me :D
---
End game there is a lot of better alternatives for tanking, damage, and healing. So the min/Max guilds tend to only take a small handful for their buffs.
---
It's still a fun class, don't let what people say decide what you think is fun to play.
---
Why don't women avoid wearing revealing clothing so they don't get raped?
---
That's the equivalent of what you're asking right now.
---
There can be a healthy world PvP environment without players using 3rd party resources to cheat.
---
Man people are obsessed about streamers. It is kind of like the Howard Stern effect, people seem to either live vicariously through them or hate their guts.
---
Play the game. Have fun. If that means being an asshole, you better be ready to face the consequences.
---
My bad. I worded it poorly, I meant to agree with you. As in it hasn't been confirmed
---
Playing through Diablo and Hollow Knight. 
---
And randomly hopping on Twitch to watch other people play, but then getting disappointed that it's the 498th Scarlett Monastery run.
---
Will this work for gold farming? Doesn't Frostbite mess things up? And will it be ok with only 1 rank of Imp Blizzard?
---
But if the title is "Whad do we do after level 40?" maybe we should start with answering that
---
On the flipside, dont you think there is an opportunity for streamers to misuse their power? As much as you are saying that there are people on this subreddit blindly hating on streamers, I would argue there is an equal amount of people out there willing to blindly follow these said streamers. I think it would be very difficult to hold streamers accountable for their actions when they are surrounded by an army of yes-men. I could definitely see people getting screwed over, because of something stupid and arbitrary.
---
There is nothing wrong with having a blacklist on a server for assholes. But I dont really know if having streamers run this list is the best idea.
---
Streamers will need to be careful about staying within the confines of the law. A line could be crossed where they start a witch-hunt that leads to real world violence. On some level I almost want to see that happen, just that an example can be made and perspective given to these people.
---
Sounds like Soda wants to play BFA if he doesn't like there being consequences for his actions.
---
His actions being streaming and being on a PvP server, you kinda should choose *one.*
---
Yeah he is trying to have his cake and eat it too.
---
Finally, some useful information on this sub
---
&gt; I agree I'm sure I'll get downvoted, but QoL improvements have slowly killed WoW.
---
This is like one of the most popular opinions here...
---
Lol you literally can't answer the question, can you?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=17193
---
Do you really think they aren’t going to use the same servers as they use for BFA?
---
Do you really not have concern for getting railed through the coals of Blizzard marketing once again like a complete sucker? 
---
Idk man, this is definitely good concern but I guess you have optimism that Blizzard won’t do the same shit they’ve been doing for years but go off bud
---
1. Don't stream the game
---
1. Don't ever use VOIP
---
1. Don't ever let anyone else know the name of the character
---
It's not as easy as you think. As soon as somebody knows the name you can be tracked down to the zone you are in.
---
Looks like undead over elf.  Should’ve been an option.
---
People will find out what server Asmon is on before you're level 5. Don't worry about those 25 minutes lost :)
---
Can we get this with less analogy? Seems like you have a great point to make but you board the shit out of me by the 2nd paragraph.
---
I would rather have meaningful discussion on the game itself, instead of the pointless screenshots &amp; memes that are half the posts currently. Can we have all the memes &amp; screenshots moved instead?
---
Yeah. One of the things Blizzard did to ruin their game was to give every class every ability.
---
It wasn't enough for warriors to have mortal strike, they had to give it to rogues. Couldn't leave bloodlust to shaman, had to give it to mages and hunters. Suddenly we're all playing the same thing, and we're all totally interchangeable.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Powershifting
---
There's the basic rundown.
---
There's some macros floating around, waiting until I get my hands on classic to try macros until I find one that works.
---
Cat weaving while resto does work as well. Used to do Strat Live with a highly geared tank and I used to catweave fairly often on bossfights, stack 2 hots, and catform for a while. Spot heal as needed.
---
But if you are DPS, you are power shifting quite often. Combine that with having omen of clarity and you are having a good time.
---
Opening on a target quite often I would open pounce (4 second stun as I had brutal impact) -&gt; shred *POWERSHIFT* shread and they were pretty much toast at that point, or in such a place I land a rip and can easily back off and kite them while they bleed to death. Did it against warriors to great success. (After opening on a warrior doing the powershift shred, get the rip off and go bear before you get clobbered and tank them for a while)
---
I always wonder if these people actually believe that or just want even more upvotes...
---
Why do you need threat for offtanking adds that no one is dpsing?
---
That's isn't total amount, it's the amount he's been donated since he switched to StreamElements.
---
Except in classic you can't make horde and alliance on PvP server.
---
1. EZ
---
2. Voice changer
---
3. EZ
---
It pains me to say this, but the dude looks unreal! Very nice and For the Horde!
---
Black lists were a thing in Vanilla. I'm sorry that you never played it or don't remember, but we did it back then too. Just adding  streamsniping cowards to the list offenses.
---
Depends on what you mean by "most European countries".  Swedes, Norwegians, Danes, Dutchmen, Luxemburgians, (Dutch) Belgians, Maltese probably score the highest averages for non-native English. Heck, I can only imagine them being second to maybe Israel or Singapore.
---
So no, most European countries are (and were) very good at English when compared to other non-native speakers.
---
thats literally an example of proof. the guy was streaming and not sniping at all, he got BLAMED for sniping because the people he ganked happened to be streamers.
---
Our pull strat ended up being a single mage blinking right after the dismount lag kicked. Pretty sure we tried lots of permutations, but since we had an excess of mage officers to hold accountable, that was the most reliable.
---
Except regular players don't have protection from being camped. Blizzard's stance on that has always been that pvp problems have pvp solutions.
---
A guild sharing resources is not really the same thing as one person getting everything they need. You don't get free things just for being in a guild, you're expected to contribute like everyone else.
---
A good Lyceum run is all on the tank tbh. Gotta use the pillars to LOS the guys with the guns and keep the mobs grouped together.
---
Are you saying streamers shouldn't get any of the benefits only the drawbacks? Seems kind of hypocritical.
---
There would still be a guild that forms just to grief the streamer in PvE by swarming them, tagging all mobs, nodes, killing questgivers (where allowed) etc.
---
BTW I'm not defending soda at all. Just saying that rolling PvE isnt going to prevent streamers from being constantly harassed.
---
Why is the 6th set shield for prot warrior a holy paladin shield..?
---
Yeah but that's the same argument Blizzard uses for why people with 21:9 aspect ratios can't get the full field of view in Overwatch "because other people don't have those monitors". That is not a valid reason if you ask me, if I spent money on my pc for a better monitor, cpu, GPU or stuff like that and it gives me an advantage so what, not my problem my pc is better than someone elses
---
I really loved the feel of Feralas. 
---
For whatever reason as a level 40-44 priest I found it easier to level up on the Gnolls in that zone than quest in other areas. I would just sit in their camp farming them, listening to comedy streaming on SiriusXM radio. Youtube and free streaming content  wasn't really much a thing at the time, so radio was the best way to get a constant stream of comedy. It was peaceful in a way.
---
Damn, I feel old. However, it feels good to be able to return to a simple pleasure in life.
---
&gt;Why don't women avoid wearing revealing clothing so they don't get raped?
---
This is not even close to a fair comparison
---
lmao so does whining about stream sniping.
---
What he said made sense. Sounds like no plans for faction/race but I can understand server transfers. Now that I think about it though...in vanilla you could transfer from a PvP server to a PvE server but not the other way around, right?
---
&gt;That's a bit naive in a game where the major selling point is community.
---
No, it isnt. The vast majority of players dont stream so they dont care about soda getting camped, they care about them and their little circle. And a vital part of the game is ganking and world pvp unless you roll on a PvE server (WHICH I GUESS, ONCE AGAIN, ISNT AN OPTION EITHER?) Theres nothing unreasonable about him trying to blacklist, but there is also nothing unreasonable about him getting camped. He is trying to act as if we should change for him which just isnt going to happen
---
Please make sure this happens.
---
lol why would they use the same servers? They're very difficult structurally server wise.
---
How to recognize them? I can't.
---
However, I'm talking about the part where you talk about broadcasting your location to the world. Just because they're successful making money doing something they enjoy doesn't mean they should be griefed for it. That's the point I'm making.
---
I think you really nailed it, it's a massive time sink, not because the encounters are super complex, there's a lot of sinks in terms of resist gear, gear thresholds, trash pulls that last FOREVER (seriously, some of those AQ hallways can FK OFF)
---
I never said that. If they get the benefits then they should get the drawbacks.
---
No Streamer has enough pull to effectively blacklist anyone.
---
Streamers only have pull in their guild and outside it no one gives a fuck lol.
---
So you're against people being able to choose who they play with?
---
I mean they could've all rolled new characters on my realm but I don't think that's what happened
---
Mythic raiding is pretty much 19 people waiting for the dumbest person in the raid to figure out the mechanics of the fight. The difficulty is all pretty much artificial. The actual gameplay of wow is not difficult, and I say this as someone who has played WoW my whole life and loves the game
---
&gt;but not the other way around, right?
---
I have no memory of this at all, lol.  I played on a PvP server and had no interest in changing =\\
---
Twitch isn't Blizzard... Two entirely separate things and it's against twitch TOS, so they're entitled to ban for it.
---
There was a belief that if all the streamers banded together and played in one faction then there wouldn't be competition on the other side. An incidental response to this post will now motivate people to beat them. Thus, making the game challenging and not a steam roll per say.
---
There's no secret build. Frostbite is necessary for a pvp build and it screws up some aoe grinding. You're going to have decide which is more important.  You have the same problem levelling.
---
Haha.
---
If you’re 27 with a job, one that seemingly can afford to pay your OT, or one you care about enough to put in more than 8 a day if salaried, you’re doing pretty well.
---
It’s not so bad, your body just changes. Sleeping for 2 hours, working an 8, working out, eating burgers and pizza then going out drinking as a normal day starts to catch up with you. 
---
Fuck I’ve even got joint problems from years of swimming year round. I’m 20 fucking 9 and I go to a specialist where 99% of the other patients are geriatrics.

Either start eating a lil better now, or build a strong habit of physical fitness. You can still slack for a few years after 26, but if you don’t have the habits—I hear the 30s will kick your ass.
---
Well no, he wants to PvP, he just does not want spergs to grief him 24/7.
---
ICQ in 2008? Something isn't adding up &gt;_&lt;
---
The whole universe is against me, what am I doing wrong?!
---
Watching someone create their own problems and catastrophically fail to fix them is some of the best content the internet has to offer.
---
Uh we don't speak of those kinds of *changes* here, bro.
---
It's still way closer to the correct amount than "Millions" assuming he means USD. Then again, I assume the guy who said "millions" was doing so as a hyperbolic.
---
Pure dps classes were doing less than modern hybrid players that are knowledgeable and trying to do well.
---
Why? Streamers are not bad people because they have opinions and say dumb things at times, anybody whose been in a guild before can agree that there are thousands of GMs more arrogant and selfish than Asmongold, soda, or others.
---
And as far as holding them accountable goes, their living is tied directly to their reputation as a person, some of them may exaggerate some minor toxicity to play it up for their stream but realistically it’s nothing worse than the average internet banter. Also there will be other streamers on the server with their own guilds to keep a decent system of checks and balances from streamer to streamer.
---
i think he has some insecurity issues. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bw380w/venruki_wins_classic_wow_tournament/eq0pony/ probably better to just ignore.
---
&gt; Not some asshole and his friends of more assholes that have a religious following.
---
I mean in this instance, they are a part of that servers community, aren't they?
---
40 DRUID MOLTEN CORE!
---
&gt;It wasn't enough for warriors to have mortal strike, they had to give it to rogues
---
Rogues had wound poison in Vanilla.
---
Yes!
---
Well, you're suggesting them to do something to avoid a problem, that isn't a reasonable solution.
---
So, yeah, it kind of is.
---
Go ahead and black list me then, Ill be happily raiding in my normie 0 drama guild and will continue to stream snipe you till you logoff
---
It's hard for threads like these to survive. Some streamers will just use their discords to influence opinion. "@everyone Look how stupid this thread is." That kind of thing.

There is something special about Tanaris and ZF runs in the night time. Can't wait!

I've been called some pretty nasty names in the Discord for daring to suggest there are reasons to roll a non-dwarf Alliance priest. There is a very active and very vocal subset of people on this subreddit and in the various discords who are trying to impose their views of 'proper' raiding as evolved on pservers onto everyone else and good luck even doing MC if you don't entirely agree with them.
---
so he will be playing on a PvE server and he won't be playing with the best players from his community?
---
I'd go back to a private then
---
Not all who wander are lost
---
No, you couldn't. Not unless you were experiencing massive lag.
---
Well it is. Have you not been 12?  Are you even younger?  Is that why you're so into streamers? You haven't yet developed to social skills to tell when someone is acting and doing it poorly?
---
I'm not disputing that, though I didn't see. I'm talking about your _first_ point.
---
Good pics and good descriptions, thanks!
---
For warlocks they have access to [Soul Harvester](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=20536) from the Sunken Temple quest (which should be in the game in P1, if I'm not mistaken).
---
It also is the perfect mobile game. It sounds insulting, but it’s a brilliant decision on their part that takes advantage of their simple controls. I love osrs and the fact there is tons of content to do on the computer and on your phone.
---
I MEAN
---
It's not about 2 hours vs 1h30min. It's about "we cleared this dungeon on week 3" vs "we spent 8 weeks wiping and it caused huge guild drama".
---
I'd be terrified if that came at me in game!
---
The long and the short. Go cry a river.
---
Worth it.
---
i mean whats the point of reddit if not edgyposting
---
I played alliance on DMaw. I can’t tell you how many damn times Zizek feared me into the lava in BRM.
---
Good times...
---
When we're talking about a blizzard game and people acting in certain ways in that game and someone mentions getting banned... You have to assume they're talking about Blizzard. Who gives a fuck about a twitch ban. No one is denying anything.
---
The guy thinks you can pickpocket beasts for leather.  What a noob
---
Hate to tell ya but i single handidly made the horde bad ass in vanilla, and im playing alliance this go around
---
He isn't complaining about being ganked. He wants to be part of that gameplay.
---
He is talking about being sniped.
---
If you're able to make six figures streaming classic content, I feel like you should be able to tank the occasional trolling and ganking better than this. I don't have a horse in the race either way.
---
Yeah did you not wanna include the people in that thread mentioning the rubber banding and lagging or because it didn’t support your narrative or are you just now realizing your argument is faulty?
---
People rarely unsubscribe, they just stop visiting and engaging. As we're a fairly new subreddit, that is rapidly growing, that doesn't really apply to us right now.
---
Pretty much this is the answer. The encounters before AQ are going to be pretty much a joke, with gear thresholds we have to hit to get past. (Reason: resists. No matter how much you throw at it, if your tanks are getting globaled because of elemental damage you can't do anything about it but get more gear)
---
So two years ago when Twitch as a platform was smaller, he wasn't as big of a streamer, and not counting sub money which has gone up massively with twitch prime being added.
---
Yeah, I'd say he's over 7 figures from streaming.
---
Bruh the fuck
---
if there was a game like classic with only mtx purchases i wouldnt mind as long as it has the super rewarding feeling and social stuff etc what we love a bout vanilla - path of exile is a good example hardcore, rewarding, mtx doesnt hurt
---
PvE servers aren't for streamers.
---
PvE servers are for players that don't want world PvP.
---
Mass griefing isn't what world PvP is about.
---
I put 2 weeks *max* specifically to avoid the argument of whether it could be done in a single lockout or not, but it happened anyway.
---
World PVP has never been against TOS. Same-faction griefing is against TOS.
---
Blizzard wasn’t wrong when they said what they said. Fans have no clue what they actually want. That’s why retail ended up the way it did.
---
Sounds like a personal problem to me
---
You can tell who is a sniper or who is just organically there, its really easy to spot the difference. Might be un popular opinion here  but If I was a streamer i'd find it annoying too if people used my stream to see me in stealth and kill me, or just kill relentlessly to the point I can't play because hes gets some LULS in the chat. I can see where soda is coming from tbh.
---
Central Europe was using it for pretty long time.
---
Okay I found it lol
---
&gt; QoL improvements have slowly killed WoW
---
What specific QoL improvements have killed WoW? The examples you mentioned (LFR/LFD, flying) are not related to QoL. Were the QoL improvements in patches 1.1-1.12 also bad in your opinion, or just the ones after 2.0?
---
I wish he would roll alliance so I could snipe him lol. Too bad Im horde. Lok'Tar OGAR!
---
Yeah cause of the glass, i framed it so it wont get damaged it's 15 years old :)
---
I know right....
---
Do we get Alliance colours too. I think every wow player waiting for classic (and some of those not) are aware of the quote and might understand.
---
Pve servers might be worse because people from both factions can grief you.
---
Not until wotlk
---
Start small... I managed to stay a clicker all the way up to tanking server first Algalon on my server. (with a Wacom tablet.. so its way faster than mouse)
---
Eventually had to bind my taunt key while doing Yogg+0 since the time it took me from clicking on a guardians title-bar; to clicking on taunt was enough time to have it one shot somebody. I bound it to shift +spacebar
---
Still use that bind for my taunts or any other important abilities on dps toons.
---
ill join The Blacklist with the rest of you spergs
---
Respec to holy
---
end of guide
---
&gt;Zizek
---
*sniff* THISCH IS PRECHISELY  PURE IDEOLOGY
---
&gt;proof?
---
i just showed you an example of a guy who wasnt sniping and they went out of their way to report him to twitch personally, you dont think theyd simply add him to the blacklist?
---
Can't you have a second trial account for free to /who people?
---
entitled andy's need to roll on a PvE server if they're upset about being ganked
---
When you stream, you knowingly provide your location and become an in game target. If you dont want to get sniped, then dont roll on a pvp server.  Simple solution.
---
Dont have the audacity to compare that to women getting raped because of what they wear. That's an incredibly misogynistic statement you made.
---
If a football team shows you their playbook while you're playing the game, would you not use that to your advantage? It's not cheating. It's the victim being stupid and placing the blame on someone else.
---
Usually Rule #2 violations, especially hate speech, are the most common bans. I'm personally very quick to ban if people toss around the F-bomb (derogatory term for a gay person) or really any term that specifically is offensive to any group of people.
---
As an example, if you tell me to "fuck off," well, we'll remove it and issue a warning. Often people can get a couple warnings for something like that without getting banned, but we'll eventually ban for a short length of time and then escalate eventually to a permaban if it's a repeated/common issue.
---
But, if you tell me to "fuck off, f****t," you're getting banned ASAP for a length of time that may be permanent.
---
A fury warrior is probably going to be the most engaging PvE rotation. But remember that you are supposed to fill all that extra time by paying attention to your environment and the situation you are in. Classic is much less about staring at your action bars/rotation. Outside of healers that is, they spend a lot of time just starting at party/raid bars lol.
---
Oh good another warrior then
---
Nah, MOP/Cata was the beginning of the end.
---
IMO WoW up through WOTLK is flawless.
---
B.C and WotLK changed the dynamic yes but I think the game style changes felt natural with the narrative of those stories and the way the MMO was progressing on the whole.
---
I think after they took out Arthas in the story line that the whole series lost its direction.
---
Arthas, imo, is the culmination of the Warcraft 3/FT story line that WoW came after. Once he was done, the story lost its steam.
---
We just send the tank in and heal him while everyone else runs in 3 seconds after.
---
I have 3 letters to say to you: STV.
---
Druid is the ultimate STV assassin. IF you are going on a pvp server, you want to be a druid.
---
Also remember druids are the ultimate exploration class. Stealth wherever you want, solo elites, etc.
---
Druid isn't an endgame DPS class unfortunately, too much emphasis on bleed damage, with debuff limits can't do the best you can do.
---
We *do* discuss this, but haven't made any decisions to change our current stance. It's not something we're ignorant of, is all I'm saying.
---
The private server I am on at the moment (I am not a private server player I just checked one out to fix my nostalgia and get to a decision on what to play) handles it like this: you have a lfg tool and can enter what instance or quest or whatever you wanna do. Then it shows you every player who also is interested in the same things. It works really nice and you still have to contact them yourself and manage everything it's basically just /who with only players that want to do the same thing
---
hell yes it should be. fuck em.
---
You don't have to level tailoring until you reach 60 - just make sure you save all the cloth you get, and mail it to a bank alt. You will want Tailoring when the Bloodvine set becomes available, since the set bonus requires Tailoring. Tribal Leatherworking is pretty useful for Druids, not so much for Moonkin gear (which is mostly caster stuff) but you will be able to make other things that are in demand for Resto, and the Warbear stuff which is useful to Ferals and possibly to Rogues who can't afford Devilsaur gear.
---
Otherwise, you are better off leveling with gathering professions like Mining or Herbalism, since they provide good income.
---
That's not true, I spoke to someone in league of legends just today. He strongly advised for me to uninstall the game.
---
Yes, the tank that has the good enchanting recipes to share and also provides everyone in his group with stat food from fishing/cooking.
---
Actually my point is that you would have to know about the shirt beforehand to understand why someone is using it. That's what I meant with inside joke.
---
Heck, before BlizzCon, we barely hit 30,000.
---
wait so you think streamers will go out of their way to get ppl who arnt stream sniping banned off twitch but not blacklist them? makes a lot of sense...
---
Can’t tell if serious.
---
Okay call me an idealist but nobody is going to be so dedicated to a single player who isn't already popular/notorious and hunt you down on two accounts. 
---
If you are just average Joe, they'll gank you for 10 minutes and move on. 
---
Or they'll camp Wetlands and become a WoW legend.
---
Oh my gosh I must not have tinkered with the menus enough to see those options! I love that same framing you have and it's built in now?! YESSSS
---
Attack Bar, thank you 😊
---
Sure. Its not like their opinion shouldnt matter. It shouldnt be matter as much as it will thanks to braindead followers though.
---
Told my friends I just assumed ppl just play with mouse and no keyboard these days, as 90% don't even bother to greet you back...
---
I have never understood why stream sniping is considered a punishable crime. Rare never came knocking on my door when I looked at my cousin's screen in Golden Eye.
---
People take games way too fucking seriously these days.
---
I'm playing on an Instant 60 server.
---
I'm an altoholic so I've been basically just playing the max level characters in different situations to really figure out which one I want to stick with once the game comes out.
---
I dont think 1 server could support all streamers being on it. Remember fans too.
---
I mean, it is, getting your character killed doesn't really effect anyone else.
---
But in classic, if you mess with someone then you're also messing with their friends ;)
---
It's all fair game, honestly.
---
I wish I had the wherewithal to take screenshots back then... I was just a 13-14 year old playing a fun game, didn’t think it would ever amount to this.
---
now there is a good point
---
I'm mobile so can't conveniently link a build. But if you want the build to be aoe at all, you can't take frostbite. Breaking up the grouping because one gets rooted will happen enough and cause enough problems that it will negate the benefits. 
---
But you can take that other build linked and move the three points from frostbite. Put one more in imp blizz and the other two I'd put in either elemental precision since resisting nova sucks or one more in piercing ice and maybe one in arcane meditation. More about covering any weaknesses you might have in gear while aoe'ing.
---
Frostbite is mandatory for a bis frost PvP spec, but that's not what you're looking for in a hybrid build. You'll do absolutely fine without it.
---
&gt; You can tell who is a sniper or who is just organically there, its really easy to spot the difference
---
i agree with you but it doesnt matter. i 100% agree there are tons of obvious stream snipers. the problem is theyve gotten people banned on twitch who WERENT sniping and blame anyone who ganks soda/asmon as sniping so actually sniping or not isnt relevant at all
---
Like play wow?
---
Idk man you obviously don't watch enough streams. People like him have been playing private servers for years and advocating for this to happen.
---
I think you could make the case at least the end of wotlk was getting bad
---
I agree
---
Are you me?
---
Though i dont think i use V.  Well, its the default activate/deactivate enemy bars, which i actually use a fair amount.

https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/player-vs-player-server-policy
---
&gt; Ongoing Harassment
---
The Ongoing Harassment policy does not apply when there is a PvP resolution available on a PvP realm, as physical confrontations are considered a facet of PvP combat and players in opposing factions are unable to communicate verbally. Characters have the ability to address their conflicts through combat and GMs will only involve themselves in extreme circumstances.
---

&gt; and GMs will only involve themselves in extreme circumstances
---
&gt;extreme circumstances
---
They have banned people for corpse camping for a ridiculous amount of time. Streamers are players and will get the same rights as one, all their live-streams will be is evidence, being upset about this is pointless and will only ruin your classic experience because you aren’t on the same level as others.
---
Its easy to tell if someone is stream sniping or just organically there. you can spot the difference.
---
Eh youre just pulling that out of your ass honestly
---
&gt; Arthas, imo, is the culmination of the Warcraft 3/FT story line that WoW came after. Once he was done, the story lost its steam.
---
This is the only reason to remember WOTLK with any fondness. Over all it was a truly dog shit expansion. TBC was good for the first half before people figured out PVP gear was better and, all classes started their march to homogenization to please the e-wieners of e-sport fans.
---
Does the man sound like a casual to you? Of course he's racing to 60
---
Sorry, no funny ban stories. Best I can offer is that once someone reported one of us on a meta subreddit after he got banned for reposting a removed thread, and a while later OP deleted the thread because it was full of people telling him the ban was right and that he was an idiot. 
---
&gt; How can someone become a mod in this sub? Blood rituals Application via a modmail?
---
We open up applications occasionally, but typically we just dip into the pool of people who expressed interest either by that application or by modmail and pick someone based on experience/attitude/timezone.
---
Bro this is some real “the bacon narwhals at midnight” shit
---
Do it yourself.
---
Not from mob grinding alone. I just only do certain quest chains at that point. In between I usually grind Whelps in Swamp of Sorrows or other mobs with good loot table drops.
---
I'm not in a race to hit 60, but I am in a race to get a jump start on the AH when I hit 60. People will be jumping to get Fire Res potions and other things that require mats dropped by certain mobs.
---
Also the Elementals in Arathi drop Elemental Fire/Earth as well as the crests for the Warrior weapon quest.
---
It's not cheating, read the TOS.  
---
Just because you don't like it and want to make analogies to rape because your logic is completely fucked and you've forgotten how to carry a conversation, doesn't make it cheating.
---
Here's the funny thing (in my mind). This could totally be fixed by OBS or competitor software. Simply be delaying the game scene and not the camera/mic setup.
---
oh i suppose that automatically means that's why it's happening. all sorted then!
---
Calling it not namecalling doesn't make it not namecalling if what you do is namecalling.
---
Also:
---
&gt;If you do not want people to be able to hunt you, perhaps consider not constantly telling others your up to date location. 
---
Man, if only he'd just stfu for one second about his damn location, how on earth would anyone be able to find him?! 
---
Joking aside, I can understand Soda's problem here, but I don't think one guy should have the power to ostracize whoever he wants. What if Soda has a bad day and the same guy happens to kill him twice? He might be a filthy stream sniper, or not. Does everyone encountering Soda in the open world have to fear the emperor's wrath from then on?
---
Yeah it's one of my favourite zones
---
You haven't shown me, could you link me somewhere with the full story? I'm not super surprised for Twitch though honestly.
---
Won't someone please think of the streamers.
---
That would be a guild of pathetic losers
---
Yes, but he didn't use his influence to do that. So there's that.
---
I saw that post too! It was made in early 2007 IIRC, either during TBC prepatch or TBC proper. Either way, the 75 rep he uses (and that classicdb lists) is very likely not accurate to Vanilla/Classic, but from a point in time after TBC prepatch buffed all quest rep values.
---
However his and my math are the same up to this point. I need 4200 Morrowgrain, which is 50% more than his 2800, because he gains 50% more rep per turn-in. But he messes up the next step: 2.5 Morrowgrain per drop at 37.9% chance should be 0.9475 Morrowgrain per transmute, and (ignoring the fact that he used the wrong average 2.5 instead of 3) that should make his transmutes needed *2800 / 0.9475 = 2955,* not 425. I played around with his numbers for a bit and it looks like he messed up his percentage calculation - if you take the 2800 Morrowgrain needed and divide it by 2.5 (his alleged average per drop) you get 1120. If you then take that 1120 and *multiply* it with 37.9%, you end up with 424.48, but that's wrong. You have to *divide* the 1120 by 37.9%, resulting in 2955 transmutes needed, the exact same number you get from 2800 / 0.9475 above.
---
Funnily enough it works out to be off by almost exactly a factor of 10, which is why his calculation results in 70 hours to exalted and mine 700. Sadly I am pretty confident that he is wrong.
---
HWL grind is about 4 months (I think), 16 hour days, taking into account having a premade with high win rate and being in top bracket week after week.
---
Collect every mount? Have fun, baron's mount is a pain, then you have to make sure you are scarab lord (skipping that) all AQ mounts (especially the red one), there's not many outside of this.
---
BIS gear for all specs? Can take a very long time, and this is time locked at Naxx.
---
Complete every quest? Loremaster won't take that long, few hours per zone at max level depending on class.
---
The exalted with Ravenhold/Darkmoon fare will be a wild ride.
---
Shift 4 and shift 5 are my int/stun but the f and v are spot on.
---
Pre raid BiS for a Druid Tank is still at a disadvantage compared to pre raid BiS as a Warrior Tank.
---
I'm really failing to see your point. I love Druid's and seen them tank certain fights but there is literally no point at all after level 60 that a Druid is better or more preferable to a Warrior.
---
Threat and even AoE tanking is better on a Warrior. The numbers have been set in stone for this for 15 years.
---
I think it will be a little different now that there is no free trials or anything that people will be able to do with classic as of yet, seeing as a subscription is required. But I am sure some rogue who wants to gank people just to annoy them would pay for two accounts.
---
This, the amount of gold in vanillaville is still the same, it just switched hands?
---
Germans have absolutely been one of the worse developed European countries at English. They have just improved much more than similar countries like France, Italy and somewhat Spain over the last 10 or 15 years. 
---
On top of that, even to this day, many seem to have this obsession of speaking/writing german in groups, when they figure out there's other germans in the group. I don't usually see Danes, Swedes, or about any of the other dominant European countries in video-games do that.
---
Hell yeah. I had a lot more time back then and we still didnt let moonkins or rets raid. My time is more important to me than 30 people who think I will carry them.
---
And you know what? I wish them the best, just not on my time.
---
I think asmongold is awake by now, go hurry to iron forge and trade him the rest of your stuff! mabye this time heel thank you or possibly even say your name ON STREAM!
---
ZERO ALTS! Well I never...

---
With no one else taking any action and the mage generating some threat (another ice barrier, usually a pot shot when in range), C'thun would focus on the mage for at least two hits, enough time to get everyone else in the room and separated into their range packs. 
---
We tried the tank pull, but some fool would heal and suddenly that person had non-zero threat. C'thun would take exception to the giant pack so we stuck with the mage, since the ice barrier/PWS would absorb enough to keep trigger fingers at bay. Think we also did druid for a bit with our resident feral.
---
This isn't a new concept lol. If you were a toxic player in classic, people didn't invite you to groups because of your reputation.
---
Streamers are complaining about a self-inflicted problem and suggesting that people who target them should be shunned out of being able to play. How is anyone supposed to tell the difference between a streamer getting ganked, and a streamer getting stream-sniped? Most streamers tend to just assume anyone who ever attacks them is a stream sniper, which would mean that any time someone happens upon said streamer and defeats them in combat would very likely be labeled a stream sniper and (if said streamer got their way with their ideology) subject to a blacklisting.
---
I say streamers shouldn't get any special treatment whatsoever, and if they're keen on broadcasting their location in a PvP enabled multiplayer game, they're going to be subject to the metagaming intel their own actions are offering unto those looking to hunt for them.
---
If they don't want to get sniped, they should utilize the methods in which they have available to them to obfuscate their location (eg: stream delay). Otherwise, it's no one else's fault but their own.
---
I don't know to be honest. But why shouldn't you be able to do so?
---
Any reason to not play a PvE server? I imagine I will only get killed by pvp geared and specced players. I really like PvP, but in battlegrounds! In pve i just like questing and dungeons. I have friends that want a pvp server but since I have like 1.5years /played on my shaman, I really feel I didn’t miss anything
---
It's usually pretty obvious why you got banned after you check
---
Soda was an insufferable twat after losing the duel tourney, and tends to be a carebear when it comes to him getting the short end of the stick, but won't hesitate to do the same to others.
---
Just your average entitled gamer.
---
I have pretty good luck. Got my very first boe mid 40s in Maraudon then found a Krol Blade while leveling and that monocle epic.
---
Just leveled on a private server and found the flurry axe as well in ZF
---
Only with having two separate accounts could this be accomplished. While possible it did come with extra costs.
---
Like play video games?  Are you dense?  Do you know where you are right now?  Should I send help?
---
If you look at the phases, Phase 5 says dungeon loot reconfiguration alongside AQ release. Not saying that the PVP gear will be adjusted but I could see them rolling out the lower tiered pvp sets and then with phase 5 releasing the true 1.12 gear. Otherwise like you said if you get high enough rank players will be able to just blast through all the starting raids
---
This is until their followers corpse camp you and ruin your year.
---
It was a dark time for me, all the wow streamers had moved over to dark souls and i was being bitchy about it...
---
&gt; this is about challenging the ideas presented by sodapoppin and other likeminded streamers, not witch hunting
---
&gt;one of the few things we get out of your perks is the ability to hunt you
---
Hmmm interesting, thanks!
---
What happens if I report a mod? For example if I report you, will you be able to ban yourself? :D
---
Reroll and name your character Johncena
---
Yes grassrooted and immobile. It was streamers attention that got blizzard to actually pay attention to this and you're delusional if you think playing on private servers for years and bitching on forums did anything to change blizzard's minds.
---
Don't tell me it's not cheating because I can practically guarantee you've not read the TOS either. Even if it's not, the actions taken by the streamsnipers are 100% in bad sport. So blacklisting them would be entirely acceptable if the former is.
---
I'm talking about the jump in logic. Of course it's not equivalent to rape. Jesus christ, I know we're on the internet but use some critical thinking.
---
Paladin healing is great. They're the most amazing efficient single target healers. Arguably the best healer for throughput
---
&gt; We should have like a different subreddit for this stuff.
---
/r/twitch ?

Some of the playerbase was terrible, a good bit knew how a simple game played out but enjoyed the atmosphere.  Vanilla, however, was harder than private servers and classic will be, because raids existed in flux with talents and values. Vanilla was not often mechanically difficult, but it used to be mathematically more difficult than classic will be.
---
fyi camping is technically griefing according to Blizzard - yet Soda said he does it in front of an audience while streaming
---
It is and he’s right. 
---
It’s an extreme example and usually when people use them to make points it’s easy to just derail the conversation and focus on that and that seems to be what you’re going to do now because, he is right.
---
I'm sorry.
---
Haha well played
---
I leveled on this server and had several fights with Angwe at 60.  Guy was no joke when it came to PvP.  Very good rogue.
---
One of my favourite things to do is head down to Azshara and spend a couple hours farming Satyrs and Bloodelfs. I always liked farming
---
stream sniping man children is part of twitch, deal with it
---
IMHO it shouldn't be of anyone's concern what happens to streamers. Self-inflicted problem. If they want to stream their gameplay, they live with the consequences of it. They're raking in fat fucking stacks of cash playing a video game all day without having to hold down a real job, they can live with getting ganked a little bit extra. ;)
---
Sometimes you have to take a step back. Im excited af for Classic but I dont wanna burn out from the hype.
---
Are you sneaking up behind them? Mobs have a higher chance of seeing you from the front. Rogue stealth is pretty bad if you don’t talent into improving it regardless.
---
I'm not sure either. But I would be very surprised if trial accounts are totally unable to try Classic in August. I think it is very likely that they activate something like the first stress test for these accounts.
---
Don't play on a PvP server if you don't want to be camped. Problem fixed
---
lmaooo how is it cheating, if you dont want to die then dont broadcast your location. if you wana stream and make $ deal with it or play a different game or server.
---
No, thank you.
---
i dont think you people really understand the point he's trying to make. he's not talking about gankers. he's talking about spergs that keep following streamers around all the time.
---
In vanilla you'll need improved stealth and you need to distract them so they're not looking in your direction.
---
You sound like a normal reasonable person. Any idea what type of server and faction (or what server specifically if the names have been released) you will be playing on? I'm going to be playing an off meta class (dps shaman or moonkin) and I'm going to take my sweet time. I want to be on a server with people like you.
---
So, if the opposing team looks at your playbook, it's not cheating but it is entirely in bad sport. Therefore, if blacklisting isn't cheating, it should be acceptable, right?
---
"Mass griefing" isn't a term used but I can't be asked to find a more updated article where they directly address this but [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20111006074209/http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20456) is where Blizzard directly states that ongoing harassment where a PVP option is available (i.e. harassing your own faction doesn't have a PVP resolution) does not apply to their Harassment policy. Corpse camping, killing lowbies, getting players flagged. It is all part of World PVP. If Soda doesn't like it, he can roll a PVE server.
---
It's also hard not to think that it's just satire when his guilds "secret mission" is to literally stream snipe guilds and grief them due to his earlier raid times.
---
If corpse camping in a computer game ruins your year you may have larger problems.
---
I don't give a hot shit about PvP so I don't do any keybinds beyond the default. Clicks for days. Never had trouble raiding as a result of this. 
---
Hell, it took me a few years of playing WoW to stop keyboard turning.
---
Sounds like they don't enforce rule 7 at all.
---
*cries in left handed*
---
Who cares why it’s happening, it’s happening. Soda isn’t hopping on the bandwagon, period.
---
I disagree, this type of grass roots toxicity is what I'm all about
---
Agreed their single target healing is solid, but when it comes to raids it gets a bit tricky
---
Private servers just cranked it up to dangerous levels
---
For what it’s worth what else did you expect from someone who has basically been handed the keys to the kingdom personally by blizzard. At this point classic is a streamers playground with their restricted beta access and if you don’t expect this toxic attitude to exist past the beta you are uninformed.
---
At this point the best we can hope for is streamers declaring their severs early so community beyond them don’t deal with their child like behaviors and cult followings. 
---
My question to blizzard is 5 months from now when the streamers have deserted their servers and left behind a wake of damage was it all worth it? The obvious marketing scheme is only going to get worse the more entitled these streamers and their followers become. Good luck at the opening of aq, or god forbid another guild taps the open world boss that a streamer’s guild was after. The entire “community” focus of classic wow will sit sidecar to the outside influence of content creators. And blizzard not only let this happen but encouraged it.
---
Cheat??? LOL
---
They CHOOSE to stream their location. Soda can easily quit streaming forever and live comfortably for the rest of his life.
---
If we got by when the items became available, bindings won’t be available to drop until phase 3. Hell, the elementium ore drops in BWL, so at best they may have a person or two waiting for those to become available.
---
That is not what’s being argued here and you’re stupid.
---
Sitting and corpse camping for an extreme period of time is a bannable offense, players have a right to be protected from this, and streamers are players.
---
Your way of thinking is literally why societies have crumbled in the past due to misunderstanding of equality.
---
Yeah, streamers having hundreds of toadies prepared to rush to their aid is all part of a healthy world PvP environment.
---
I think people are just overreacting to one streamer's comment, but if any streamer complains about getting ganked or people streamsniping them, I'd have no sympathy. They are the ones that chose to play the game while broadcasting. If they don't want to be streamsniped they can play off stream.
---
Probably just entirely stop coming here then. I barely look now that there's a release, and I wouldn't play beta even if I got it. I don't want to burn out until after I'm 60
---
Since you're German. Can you answer this question for me.
---
How come even though Germans are supposedly so good at English, I often see them randomly starts typing german in party/raid chats, when they figure out there's other germans? I don't see many other developed countries doing that on European servers, but many germans seems to not give a shit about the rest of the group/raid, and resort to their own language.
---
No hate, this is just an observation. I've seen French people do it as well, but I always figured it was because they're notoriously bad at English. And I thought Germans were in the same position, but according to people here, they're supposed to be decent to good. So I don't understand why they're doing it. It honestly seems like a shitty thing to do and pretty disrespectful.
---
I played Dragonmaw Horde to. Good times.
---
I don't know if I can be banned, but I can also unban myself. If you report a mod it shows up same as any other report, but please don't report removal notifications - it clogs up the queue and we tend to just auto-approve them. Instead send a modmail and we'll discuss it there.
---
Listen I don't get this whole - blah blah you go on a blacklist if you stream snipe me, 
---
listen buddy. In life, everything good comes with the bad! And that's just how it is.
---
If Sodapoppin is so annoyed with streams snipers I suggest the man to go create a "stream" character on a PvE server and go have his full vanilla enjoyment on a PVP server when he's not streaming! 
---
You can't dictate how a game should be played! Yes, I know Stream Sniping is scummy and a stupid way to gain attraction! But PvP is allowed and you find yourself on a server where it is allowed! That you create a character on one of these servers and expose yourself to the "harm" that you describe is a problem entirely up to you to decide on! And it's pretty simple! 
---
To roll on a PvP server or not to. 
---
I don't think a player should be blacklisted because he's killing you. 
---
I see streamers everywhere complain about stream snipers, and again the good comes with the bad, 
---
the good being -"free staff of Jordan" - "20 gold here and there" - "Stack full of mats" - "Free raid and dung spots" - "And so much more" - There is no complaining in that and you happily agree to accept the stuff provided, BUT as soon as someone starts to kill you because you're an open target you start complaining. I don't see the logic here. Yes, I know getting sniped is annoying as fuck, and you can't really do anything against it. Except for gathering an Army here and there to fight it. 
---
You want 1v1 pvp, 
---
Well if you wanted that you should never have become a streamer! 
---
You're famous, shit like that comes with your job. You can't just choose what you want and don't want. 
---
You have either of 2 options and that is - PvP or PvE 
---
1 might end you up getting stream sniped
---
2 is gonna make you not get stream sniped.
---
\--------
---
I don't see this "meh I get stream sniped, this guy needs to get blacklisted and never to be allowed in any good raids - guilds - dungeons - etc. And you know most of this guys fanbase is gonna jump the same server as him! And therefore is gonna make the "blacklisted" guys life "hell" 
---
You need to realize that your job Sodapoppin comes with stuff like this! 
---
Life would be awesome if we all could just choose what we wanted and didn't want!. 
---
And just so you know, I really like Sodapopping, I think he's a great guy all around! And just enjoys World of Warcraft just as much as the next person! But this streamer vs community thing is getting on my nerves now, so I needed to vent.
---
Loktar forever my guy
---
Farming the Deathchargers Reins in Strattholme, listening to music and shooting the shit with my guild party. Good times. Almost everything farmable nowadays is behind a weekly lockout, there’s no reason to just mindlessly grind, and no chance to build community with other people working towards a goal. Just single serving friends that disappear forever once you leave the instance.
---
This might be the most concise and to the point explanation for layering ive seen on this sub. Nicely explained
---
Get out of here with your "numbers" this is a hate only post \s
---
Depends in Ironfoe proc rate. It might be as good as MCP if it's high enough.
---
Wait a second does this means the streamers are going to play on ONE server *smile*
---
Because only way it’s going to work is IF you got streaming friends on the same server. 
---
And sure I had my own KOS list when playing and I shared it with my guild members.  But that was from serious grieving and corps camping.  One guild on my server was KOS because they had members running in to IF killing bank alts in ah.   
---
Over and over again.   
---
That KOS list was not shared with the other 4+ raiding guilds I knew on ally side on our server.   
---
So good luck enforcing anything like that I can tell from my own experience Not going to happen.
---
I only look at /top and most of it is garbage. Do your job better.
---
I was a female mage named Kandi.
---
Self-inflicted only as an unforeseen consequence that was never designed to be dealt with by the game since streaming is an outside platform. The problem is that they probably are getting sniped most of the time if you just look at time spent in PvP engagements. So a blacklist would probably capture more true positives than false negatives.
---
I don't think they should get special treatment, good or bad.
---
I agree that stream delay is one of their best tools. It shouldn't *have* to come to that but people will be pieces of shit, that's just human fact.
---
This is absurd get over your self.
---
balance/resto is actually really good in WPvP. In BGs it isn't as good as the HotW spec. Balance/resto in the world is so good because you have endless space to kite people around as you keep your dots up and occasionally throwing out a wrath here and there.
---
The true difficulty in Vanilla was
---
1. getting 40 players to shop up every raid night and stay for hours on end.
---
2. Learning how to do an encounter
---
3. Working around shitty communications tools and terrible internet connections, including blizzards connections. And most people (almost any non gamer) had a PC with less power than your toaster oven.
---
The only difficult part of the game will come with AQ40 and Naxx, everything else will be fairly easy for any guild.
---
Yeah I don’t know what that guy is on about lol
---
It's different when you show the opposing team your playbook and if you sneakily look at the opposing team's playbook without their knowledge.
---
How does allowing you to buy race/faction/server changes make a company scummy?
---
Or just pick a different realm and you will never hear of them in-game. If you dislike streamers and their plans then rolling on their realm would be a horrible idea.
---
Then don't stream the location you are at to the world
---
Went from cheating to being a bad sport so fast my head spun.
---
Are you going to pretend like people weren't lagging or rubber banding?
---
I was rocking a J!nx Mölten Cöre LF39M T back in the day. Might see if I can encourage them to do a reissue.
---
What a sad post
---
No, his logic is correct, but people with lower levels of IQ will mostly focus on the extremity of the example versus the logic of whats being said and that’s exactly what you’re doing.
---
Player grieving is against the TOS, streamers are players.
---
Kind of sounds like you are against there being consequences for your actions.
---
Streamsniping and being mad to be shunned for it or just play the game like you would normally. You probably should choose one aswell.
---
Reputation has always been an incredible huge thing in classic, if you choose to ruin yours, it's not Soda's fault for having a way to handle your ass.
---
PS: This isn't necessarily pointed at OP, more at people who probably only can win in wPVP by using outside information and then whine about any consequences.
---
you sumbitch!  back in vanilla i farmed a rare spawn bear in winterspring for ages because it had the highest drop rate i could find on krol blade (i was a rogue).  Never got it.
---
just as well i soon wised up and realised dal'rends was just as good... if ugly as fuck
---
Of course it would cost more resources and development time, but why wouldn’t Blizzard do that if it meant keeping subscriber numbers up? They are going to support Classic long term if it means they will keep profiting from it. It just makes financial sense.
---
It's between Druid, Paladin, and Warrior (and maybe possibly hunter). I've always played DPS throughout my WoW history since I've been too afraid to take on the other roles but I'm tired of feeling like I'm missing out on healing and/or tanking so I want to try one of them for Classic. My absolute favorite race is dwarf, so that would be a con to playing druid, but I do like their versatility. I've always kind of wanted to play warrior, but I don't know if I'll be able to commit to a raiding guild and playing warrior tank at 60 seems like it would be really difficult without a dedicated raiding group. That leaves paladin, which doesn't sound bad to me, although it would pretty much mean I couldn't play tank in any situations. Overall I would like to be desirable in dungeon and raid groups and playing dwarf is a plus. Anyone have suggestions?
---
These streamers are legit cancer. They’re toxic and they harbor toxicity wherever they are. Streamers don’t belong in MMOs
---
O\_o ???
---
I would laugh but it’s so true that it pisses me off beyond measure.
---
My experience is whenever some starts saying how a lot of QoL improvements damaged WoW they are instantly raged on by people who blindly follow every improvement as a step forward.
---
A lot of people here don't listen to the reasoning on how something while good intended did in fact cause more harm than good. 
---
So yeah I do believe a lot of what I say generates more downvotes than upvotes.
---
&gt;Your way of thinking is literally why societies have crumbled in the past due to misunderstanding of equality.
---
Lmao. I'm glad my opinions on WoW streamers complaining about being ganked WHEN THEY COULD ROLL ON A PVE SERVER TO AVOID IT can be compared to women getting raped and societies being collapsed. What the fuck is wrong with you people?
---
No wonder, he watches swifty.
---
How? 
---
I can log onto that big pserver and ask in chat where any of the high reputation PvP folks are and within 5minutes I will have a location.  
---
Grinding in Felwood? Found within 5minutes.  
---
Last seen in Winterspring? 99% chance he's farming e'cos at furbolgs or giants.
---
EPL? Doing circles for Rich thorium veins/black thorium/strat entrance, so just load up classicdb for spawn locations and ride into him.
---
Ungoro? Devilsaur.
---
You get the gist. If you want to hunt down a player like Soda even without streaming you'd have the position in pretty much an instant.
---
Yeah I remember when XBL had party chat, I never went in lobby as much on Halo 3. Maybe occasionally for custom game shenanigans but I'd rather not be cussed out by strangers.
---
More like "you like to make stuff up and then say 'data' to appear smart when someone calls you out on your BS".
---
BC was pretty well balanced, but I do agree with the arena thing. Personally I feel like mid-late Wrath was the "beginning of the end".  
---
Early-mid Wrath was pretty good, but when we moved into the mid-late Wrath period things started slipping and just kept continuing downward.
---
BFA should have been chasing somebody and phased out
---
I really don't see how this would be widely enforced, honestly. Some streamer on the opposing faction getting sniped isn't going to rustle anyone's jimmies
---
Lmao you think your guild won’t be plagued with streamers? 
---
You’re not gonna have a good time.
---
They got invited to classic beta purely based on their twitch numbers.
---
They're raking in hundreds of dollars on a daily basis because they got acces to a game that many others didn't because they were unlucky. They are the only people who actualy benefit from getting hooked on the game and play all the time.
---
Compared to all the benefits they got, getting corpse camped is a very small drawback. Most of us will get corpse camped on the regular without getting paid to play this game.
---
These streamers just can't handle what they don't like. It's an age old tale among "pro" gamers who think they're hot shit because of their online status but can't put a coherent sentence together IRL.
---
Play on a PvE server and you can't get ganked.
---
Ehm you need the treat to tank the boss when the main tank was feared and lost all of its aggro
---
if someone stands still for 5 seconds, turns towards the streamer and walks directly over them while they are stealthed, and does it multiple times, that's sniping
---
There really isn’t anything to talk about. The game is already known. The people just want to play, and because they can’t play they want to dream. Other people here like to crush dreams. And thus the cycle continues.
---
Any examples of this? I mean yeah it can happen, streamers know that ofc sometimes you get ganked randomly, that's part of the game, but when it's actually streamsniping the players usually make it very clear by doing stupid shit.
---
That is fair. I think most people feel this way as well, it's just that they dont like the attitude of soda. Some people call it privilege, some people call it jealousy, i just think it's weird hearing someone demand special rules apply to them with a straight face
---
Stop projecting
---
Why do people care which server the streamers are on lmao it's every other post.
---
All that color...
---
If you raid with a streamer they will probably demand bis gear first
---
I actually love your solution. Guild sounds 10/10
---
Tinfoil hat much?
---
I mean, retail is an arcade game. Classic is an RPG.
---
"Don't play on a pvp server" is such a cope out arguement. they want to enjoy the game like everyone else. try to see it from both sides man...if you where a big streamer I guarantee you would be bitching about it too. Stream sniping is a new  thing to gaming, it hasnt been around forever. Everything else I can agree with. Like I said it isnt hard to tell if someone is blatantly stream sniping for "clout" or LULS in chat and if they  are doing it for that reason I agree with Soda.
---
You do realise that's not actually an insult right?
---
You can't think of a counter to my argument about streamers over acting badly so you pretend that you have sex with women and say that I don't.
---
(Note that I'm only assuming that you're pretending that you have sex because I haven't heard anyone older than about 16 talk like that)
---
I guess you win.
---
Are you retarded? He never says it’s ok to camp him lol. He blatantly says that if he gets ganked or camped its “stream sniping”. And how does he know if they’re stream sniping? More importantly, who gives a fuck? You really think a server community is going to bow to the whims of an entitled streamer?
---
“Rules for thee but not for me.” Fuck off.
---
frostbite is a big No for AOE farming
---
Dibs on titsout.  I can't stand that guy.
---
Just because vanilla was relatively casual compared to other mmo’s in 2004 doesn’t mean it’s casual by today’s standards.
---
Did Soda not realize he's showing his location on a pvp server on the jumbotron for the entire server to view?
---
&gt; If 20 people are standing around him killing him for hours, they should probably do something about it. 
---
If he rolled on a PvE server, they might've. but if he rolls on a PvP server, Back then shit like this example happened pretty often. PvP happened, Call for friends/guildies, or in his case viewers too.
---
Saying you do something is not the same as doing it. 
---
Notice how soda says he played on a private server? Saying you have done cocaine in front of a cop won’t get you arrested.
---
I can hear the sounds of him whimpering from here. What a crybaby.
---
They have specifically said this won't happen. If you honestly don't think Blizzard understands what 'Vanilla' is about at this point, you got to be stupid. They know what Vanilla stands for, we know what Vanilla stands for. We've played the game once before, there's no way they can get away with changes to the core game, like that.
---
Why everyone so mad he only got one char? He too busy F U C K I N.
---
Yall have fun fuckin ya pale fat chicks that cosplay as elves
---
Aye you could, with a group who know what they are doing.
---
What it's called doesn't change the fact that heroic dungeons as they are in retail don't really have a good reason to exist. I'm not comparing heroic dungeons of today to heroic dungeons from TBC, rather I'm comparing heroic dungeons of today to normal and mythic dungeons as well as all of the other avenues to get gear.
---
TipsOut did a video on this very thing; and Pally comes out on top (by a substantial margin) in each category. Pally was the OP healing class in Vanilla.
---
I did this and wound up with a new main... the beauty of wow
---
Banana shoulders
---
Straight up, FFXI. I'm excited to play WoW Classic, for a lot of reasons. I didn't play it much, I know it's a bit more difficult than current WoW, a sense of community, etc.
---
But, FFXI was my first and biggest MMO love, and if they re-tune a server for 75 cap, w/ the first 2 expansions (Rise of the Zilart and Chains of Promathia) I'd resub, in a heart beat, and begin again my experience. 1200+ play days before!
---
I hope this brings back MMOs as a distinct genre again, with a focus on personal effort equalling progression, communities, and thriving economies, I truly do. But I'd kick a baby for a return of the game I fell in love with, much like what the Classic fanatics are going to be getting in 2 months.
---
Still possible today, dont worry.
---
maybe... at very low settings
---
its a bit of a turd
---
Yes but he only reads donations... And sub gifts
---
I completely agree. As a rogue, I was PISSED when Hunter's got camouflage. Completely killed my sense of class identity as a stealth unit. 
---
I started playing at the end of Wrath so even then there was a lot of class homogenization happening so it will be really refreshing to be playing Classic and being NEEDED because I'm a rogue who can pick locks, stealth, etc.
---
Except it isn't separate. It's the exact same argument, you're just pretending it's a different one.
---
Would it be viable for the devs to designate a couple/few pve and pvp “streamer realms” where if a streamer is found in any non-streamer realm they’re character gets deleted?
---
Godspeed ret brother.
---
My cheeks hurt from the the massive grin on my face! LOL
---
And what happens when someone isn't Stream sniping and just happens to gank him/Piss him off and gets them "Blacklisted".
---
Please inform us of how, oh wise one.
---
As a ranger, wouldn't aragorn be more of a hunter than warrior?
---
I LIKE THIS
---
I know what they've said, I'm just not naiive enough to believe everything I'm told. That's especially true if what I'm being told is by Activision, lol.
---
You're giving me flak for being *skeptical*? I didn't make any guarantees or even predictions.
---
Good reason for Blizzard not to re-invite him the next round.
---
TBC and WOTLK
---
SIMPLY a Shadow Priest? My good sir I will mind control you off a cliff for that.
---
Killing someone / camping them for a few mins is a lot different than what people do to those streamers. But they get paid to play WoW so no one feels bad for them. I don't really care either way.
---
/thread
---
Hmm Zhaiden, what a nice name for a wow character
---
Taunt does not put you on top of the threat meter. Taunt only forces to attack you but will not set your threat above anyone else.
---
And fear does resets you thread for a substantial amount.
---
You will also not have the fury tank behind the boss because you dont want the boss to ever turn in to the group at all. E.g. Onyxia because your group will immediately wipe.
---
DW will make the boss hit too hard because of parry hate, non dw fury tank will not generate enough threat
---
Hybrid tax is totally fair, ~~change my mind~~ change my vox!
---
No, it's not.
---
This situation is that *many* people are using a 3rd party resource to hunt down a single player to continuously kill them.
---
Camping is one person finding a single player *in-game* and continuously killing them.
---
Im pretty sure almost all systems can run classic if its anything like the og system demands, if not then blizzard have once again ruined vanilla
---
Ive played pretty much every new mmo thats come out, and i vastly prefer the graphics in wow to all of them. 
---
On a side note, moving your character around in wow feels so much better and less clunky than any other game I’ve played. I don’t know how blizzard is able to do it when i haven’t seen any other studio even come close.
---
TipsOut isn't a credible source.
---
Oh, it's in-game? Sure it's fine then.
---
I enjoy just killing/grinding mobs even in BFA, but BFA cut out most of the incentive. Like, Island Expeditions and Warfronts have a ton of mobs to fight, but they don't drop anything and don't give rep, so why bother instead of just zerging to the final boss?  
---
Grinding mobs in classic, theres a chance you could get a green drop thats actually pretty good, or even a blue or purp world drop that was great/ (staff of jordan anyone?) Heck, nearly all the mats back in vanilla were worth a little something too. If you were a warlock, you needed to grind mobs for shards. It had a leveling purpose too as you got a pittance of exp.
---
But my favorite era of WoW was Timeless Isle. I honestly think its the best piece of content they have ever created, period.
---
You could go grind really hard mobs that dropped their own currency and a pittance of rep, while rare spawns with a chance to drop awesome toys, mounts and pets spawned all over. Meanwhile, you might run into third-faction PVPers who were using the bloody coin. Then there were buffs and junk littered all over the island.
---
I really can't believe Blizz never tried just taking the Timeless Isle formula and just straight recreating it. Tanaan, Argus, Broken Shore, whatever all feel like drastically watered down versions of Timeless Isle.
---
&gt;You don't have to min/max, but you're kind of a waste of space if you don't," 
---
This is actually true with some specs.
---
Now stream sniping is griefing?  Another amazing leap in logic and IQ.
---
German on my mothers side. My father is Finnish, and we live in Finland :D
---
As to an answer to your question: **Germans have a very strong sense of community towards each other.** When there are two players and they recognize each other as Germans, or even just German speakers, such as me, it's almost expected to at least drop a greeting in the language.
---
There is even a word in German for that: "Korpsgeist".
---
Hard compared to what though? that's the thing.
---
compared to BFA the difficulty is drastically higher in vanilla wow, its not even comparable.
---
I'm leveling a warrior on retail right now and i'm level 97, i have literally never had to stop once to eat or bandage myself, ever. I am never in danger of dying, i face roll absolutely everything. its a joke in comparison
---
If you actively try to destroy someone's ability to enjoy the game, you're inviting the other person to do unto you the same. If you don't want to have a shit reputation as a stream sniper, maybe you shouldn't be stream sniping. The idea that streamers should be responsible for the people who antagonize them (because somehow people found out their location) is really dumb and is straight up victim blaming.
---
Yeah, that's why I don't understand everyone saying "it's so easy, just pick one of the existing builds".
---
Sounds like I have to trade AoE farming for optimal PvP with Frostbite vs Imp Blizzard. My choice.
---
lol what kind of world do you live in when "data points" is "smart"?
---
Personal experiences, anecdotes, history...whatever is easiest for you guy.
---
I'm sorry, what's the problem? I thought this subreddit loved the idea that server reputation will matter. 
---
Their voice will be disproportionately listened to? Yeah. So were top-end guild members back in the day, even if they were toxic, entitled bullies who would make shit up or lie about someone they didn't like. This problem existed in Vanilla. 
---
As some of you constantly repeat to streamers, you gotta learn to take the good with the bad. :)
---
I had seen a different version in game last night... can't remember which one of my addons had me searching through every thumbnail...

Found this one with a quick search though, I hope it's what you were looking for

Nice sarcasm, Its common sense man. Someone literally runs at you while youre stealth and kills you? You find the same exact person happening to just "appear" in every zone your in and continue to gank you relentlessly? these are just a few and i'm not going to sit here and right paragraphs that you should be able to figure out with common sense. I'm talking about people BLATANTLY stream sniping, not where its questionable.
---
who the fuck knows the names of the chipmunks
---
He is legitimately the only Classic personality I cannot stand. The others are meaningless because I don’t watch streams. But that fucking guy!  Clickbait in the beginning with lies about leaks. Claim he played Vanilla etc etc. So many fucking lies just to con people into watching him. Then he gets other people to join him to fill in his blanks like he’s a fucking transgender African frog that wants to be a dinosaur.  He is just a low quality con man. And what really pisses me off is a group of fools fell for it. I just can’t even. Fuck.
---
On my vanilla server we had Starsky and Hutch an alliance shadow priest and rogue who ganked lowbies all the time, they were pretty much KOS for all level 60 horde players and if they showed in barrens they would be camped till they left. We all hated them but pretty sure the Alliance players didn't give a shit they ganked lowbies all the time.
---
Not directly, no.  OP is suggesting players will cut deals like "I'll give you 50g in Classic if you give me 500g in Retail".  And this *will* happen to some extent, but it won't distort either economy; no gold is leaving either game, it's just changing hands within each.
---
&gt; is such a cop out arguement. they want to enjoy the game like everyone else.
---
It's the perfect argument, because the people sniping are effectively PvP'ing, which is what PvP servers are for in the first place. People fucked specific people/guilds up in Vanilla, by scouting where they were going/flying/running on their mounts, to remove their buffs.
---
&gt; if you where a big streamer I guarantee you would be bitching about it too. 
---
I wouldn't, because I know it's part of the game, and partly what that specific server was made for.
---
&gt; Like I said it isnt hard to tell if someone is blatantly stream sniping  for "clout" or LULS in chat and if they  are doing it for that reason I  agree with Soda. 
---
It definitely is hard to tell, because you're going to turn into a whiny ass kid if you get camped for a long time, at least some people will, and they won't be able to look at it objectively. If I camp Soda for 2 hours, I can guarantee you he's going to call me stream sniping. Meanwhile, people are camping people in Redrige for 5+ hours and they're not even sniping anyone streaming. How do you know it's not just some level 60 who loves to gank lowbies and camps people all day?
---
Seriously dude. I played HotS the other day and they literally have built in comms and no one fucking talks. Even better no one types in chat! So stoked to have a community again
---
It should run the game on low to mid graphics settings. But not much else, it will most likely struggle if you have any browser tabs open while running the game.

Within 50 seconds of the video he said he'd prefer not receive any of the streamer benefits along with none of the disadvantages too.
---
I don't believe asking to not be sniped is a special benefit, all of us non-streamers will be going into Classic without a massive following who know exactly who we are.
---
It's fair enough that if you use your advantage over the streamer to know exactly where they are even while in stealth, you also accept the downside that the streamers will blacklist you from their own groups, and from their friends groups.
---
It's basically like playing a game with a bunch of friends, but then cheating, and then getting mad that they won't let you play with them anymore. Feel free to cheat to gain an advantage, but people won't want to play with you.
---
It wasn’t an op ed, it was a numbers crunch. So you’re basically saying math isn’t a credible source.
---
well any alts need to be leveled in phase 1 because ranking is out for phase 2 and they wont have free time for a while
---
Unfortunately, as with most popular streamers, his bodyguards will pay HIM 50g/hr just to be near him.
---
I wish &lt;Goon Squad&gt; would make a comeback with the sole purpose of doing this lol.
---
Found the streamer fanclub.
---
You can unban yourself? Ooooh i would abuse that so hard
---
If I may ask one last question: what happens if a mod has a tantrum and goes nuts? (Bans everyone or spams) Is there somekind of highlord GODOD that could remove the mod status of a mod?
---
Even a simple comma would be nice.
---
You still haven't given us a way to magically determine the difference between a sniper and a camper, so it's the same argument until then. You can't tell us you can't determine the difference while also pretending it's a different argument, lmao.

I remember doing Shiektal's Pug runs in the weeks leading up to TBC.  Killing Twin Emps in a pug was the talk of the server!

In PvE I'm pretty sure hunter is considered to have the most complex rotation, but I have no experience with it myself.
---
I just had a thought. What’s keeping you from leveling 3 classes, Healer, Dps, whatever you want. Then you play and raid that night with whatever one you feel like? The game is never going away so...you’d have the time to gear all 3.
---
People are really underestimating how hard people maxed their 30s on beta, especially the streamers grinding gear, and what a difference that makes. Combined that with the time it takes to get alchemy and engineering up to a significant level as well as groups specifically made to aoe grind....as you said people will be in for a wake up call.
---
and I'm saying they're still testing and tuning things, there's a reason there are more stress tests scheduled. Assuming the servers are going to fail when Blizzard is doing specific tests (multiple) for server capacity is pretty absurd. Like, do you really think they're going to test 500 people in one area than just dump 12,000 in live?
---
laptops ew
---
If you’re playing on a private server, then they are known to have wildly varying aggro ranges for stealth detection, depending upon the server. In the Beta, stealth detection is much more forgiving. You can stealth right up to same level and below mobs, from the front, and not be seen until you nearly run into them.
---
&gt;Player grieving is against the TOS, streamers are players.
---
Yeah that’s what I said, lmao, have a good day man.
---
Mods with 'Full permissions' can remove mod privileges from any mod added *after* them, including mods with 'Full permissions'. Thankfully that's never happened though.
---
Except one completely stops then playing the game and the other just stops them playing the game with a bunch of people but still enables them to play it with many others who don't give a shit, or don't know it exists, etc.
---
Even though I'm fed up with these egotistical ragebots freaking out about the fact that streamers exist, there *are* two legitimate reasons why one would wish to avoid streamer servers:
---
1. Even though the streamer is not in control of it, a sufficiently large fanbase means that some non-negligible fraction of their viewership will harass players who "slight" the streamer in some way, be it taking an item in a dungeon that the streamer wanted, or corpse camping the streamer on a PvP server (but let's be honest, most will roll PvE to avoid this scenario). Getting death threats because you offended someone's unrequited love is no bueno.
---
2. Sufficiently large streamers will warp the Ahn'Qiraj race by employing their viewers to help them grind Brood rep and/or try to sabotage other people from doing the same thing. People already leap hand over foot to throw items at popular streamers just in beta, let alone when they all have accounts. And by the time AQ hits, even the slowest levelers will be 60. It will have a seriously warping effect on the AQ "metagame" for one guy to be able to summon a thousand, or even merely a hundred, people to farm carapaces for him at all hours of the day.
---
r/funnyandsad
---
What situation is this?
---
I may be a fucking idiot but I'm not sure the point you're trying to make? I'm not arguing whether its  easy or hard to spot/know where a streamer is. I'm merely saying It's easy to tell if someone is stream sniping to be funny for the stream and farm some omegaluls or if they are organically there just pvping for fun.
---
Does it become ingame when some people watch the jumbotron and then go ingame and spout the current location? Yourself wouldnt watch the stream but you would benefit from the information still.  
---
Genuinely curious.
---
And then he forgets the name of the guy dumb enough to give him money five minutes later.
---
No one outside of streamer run guilds is going to give a shit honestly
---
Yes please a griefing and camping based guild please
---
then dont
---
Hope they only make 10 servers with 50 layers each, and then at phase 2 each server has a 15 hour queue.
---
i mean leveling is much harder in vanilla, its no comparsion. the top end stuff like mythic + and mythic raiding is definitely more difficult then the top end stuff in vanilla, but everything else including the leveling experience is drastically easier in retail
---
Can confirm, am German and no one can properly speak English here.
---
His issue is not with dying in organic world PvP. His issue is when people use his stream to purposefully hunt him down and harass him. They aren't the same.
---
&gt;I know what they've said, I'm just not naiive enough to believe everything I'm told. That's especially true if what I'm being told is by Activision, lol. Words are wind.  
---
&gt;You're giving me flak for being skeptical? I didn't make any guarantees or even predictions.
---
I'm giving you flak for being skeptical about Vanilla, because Blizzard have shown they actually care for it and understand what made Vanilla what it was. I think Activision/Blizzard is handling retail like idiots, but I got to give credit where it's due and so should everybody else, based on what they've seen them do, in terms of blue posts and listening to the community.
---
If you want versitility look no further than the druid. You do basically.... anything. Heal? Check. Tank? Got you. DPS? Spell or melee. Hump dead people in raid? Bearform is perfect. (especially this last part)
---
Playing a warrior tank at 60 isn't a terrible life, you slam through tons of dungeons as a tank, always be invited because you're a tank and they are always in short supply, high demand. But getting a pick up group as a tank, not the easiest. Since you are the literal backbone of the raid, they usually pick up their raid tanks, or raid offtanks to run with the pick up group so they can feed them gear. (Perk of being the tank is you get priority on things)
---
But absolutely, give a druid a close look. Watch some videos of druids (Here's one of my favorites - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EekNxwQ7izg ), if you are a pvper or not, you can still see the hybrid capabilities of the class and how interesting it is.
---
Ty! This was exactly it!
---
A the content would become trivial if they added TBC class changes.
---
Plus the gear would be way off.
---
Just play Vanilla and eventually you will be able to continue into TBC when they progress into it, which they will.
---
Lol. You can run classic on a toaster.
---
A combination of that, jealousy, and occasionally justified anger.
---
List the class/specs and tell us your thoughts on why they aren't viable/good. I only played a mage in vanilla so I can't comment on other classes but at various times I played around with and had fun with all three specs and mixes therein.
---
Too real
---
He should watch what happens to people who stream live on Eve Online, and learn from it. Run a delay, hide your location (bit hard in WOW). Because if you don't in EVE, you will get ganked, blown up, and all the stuff from your wreck taken. He needs to HTFU.
---
Streamers unironically wanting a personal server for themselves is such high level of egotism I don't even know where to begin.
---
"Zha-ee-den"?  Is that how you pronounce it?
---
what do you think this thread is about? and do you think 1 person should be able to control who can and cant play with 80% of a server
---
PJSalt
---
Question: Will all the characters be wiped on release or do these guys get to keep their characters and have a headstart over everyone who didnt get into the beta?
---
You can't prove I was stream sniping, that's the obvious problem with banning people for it in the first place.  I'd have to admit to or in some way self incriminate.
---
So what does the black list do other than "list of people Soda doesn't like?"  Streamer gets ganked and recognize a name, they get put on the list.  Now we're just going to falsely accuse someone and attempt to ruin their experience?  That reasoning is so obviously fucked, that now people want to camp him just for making these idiotic statements.  He should have just kept his mouth shut.  That's called the Streisand effect.
---
The core of your misunderstanding here lies in the first post of this thread: " Well it won’t effect the average joe who’s just casually walking around. They won’t blacklist someone that kills them once and never to be seen again. "
---
You run into the same people all of the time in this game. If you get sideways with one of them you tend to run into each other even more. I probably had 100 real world pvp incidents with just 3 chars on my opposing faction in vanilla. They weren't stream sniping me and I wasn't stream sniping them. If you didn't know who Soda was and he ganked you while he was 5 levels higher than you, you might make a point of bumping into him whenever you can from then on. If Soda then puts you on a blacklist "for stream sniping" with 100 streamers with 100k followers, players on all servers on all factions, and for no more effort gets to make your game lame that'd be a shame.
---
Yeah, phase 1 is honestly best for getting a main and a farm alt up and decently geared. Getting a solid base to continue the rest of the game from. That way you can grind what you can in p1 and have a good alt ready for DM farming when p2 drops (for any time you aren’t farming up pvp ranks to fill gear gaps on the main).
---
It does not.
---
And you have to because you will tail swipe your group if you move the boss just a little bit too mich.
---
There’s a line between a hate group and a pvp guild.
---
&gt; and good luck even doing MC if you don't entirely agree with them.
---
No luck required, these morons can play in their uber-hardcone-l33tguilds gimping their own fun, while I go play with real people rather than a bunch of basement-dwellers.
---
[This picture](https://i.imgur.com/fGuvxQ8.png) sums it up perfectly ;-)
---
What did you end up with?
---
Your questions have mostly been anwsered, so I just wanted to contribute what I can:
---
At level 60 as a min/maxxer, or at least as someone who wants to play at a competitive level, you only have one real path (at least in the first few months or year):
---
1. Heal in dungeons and raids, collecting resto healing gear. You can't output high, **sustained** damage as a fresh 60 Shaman. 
---
2. Once you have decent healing gear, you can heal in PvP premade groups and possibly get some items for elemental or enhancement.
---
3. Once your guild has some raids on farm status, you can collect items the DPS classes don't need anymore. This is especially true of enhacement gear like melee weapons.
---
4. Keep PvPing and raiding as a healer, and you'll eventually collect a damage and DPS set. Then do whatever you want. You'll be good in whatever spec you want. You'll also have the flexibility to play as whatever spec you want, the best thing about hybrid classes! :)
---
If you don't follow this path as a healer it isn't the end of the world, but it means you'll only get scraps of gear and invites to groups that are desperate (and likely not good). It will take a LONG time to get decent enhacement and elemental gear if you don't play as a healer.
---
Look, not saying he has a point complaining about this,but the guy makes a few hundred thousand $ a year streaming no one in his position would stop streaming.
---
So he two choices, getting ganked, or roll PVE.
---
Good Lord, I can only imagine the shit show if Blizzard was dumb enough to give streamers' their own special server.
---
Where are you getting your 80% of a server from?
---
Streamers are players.
---
If they get corpse camped to the point of where it’s too extreme for Blizzard to need to get action then they should.
---
If that’s too upsetting for you to handle then you live a sad life my man.
---
What do you mean? There's plenty of streamers with high views that didn't get a beta invite.
---
Even the ones that are playing Beta are probably on another account that was given to them.
---
Popular streams don't = instant invite. Blizz confirmed that.
---
Lol this reddit is filled with pussies born in the 60s and it absolutely disgusting. Just because you are retired and have nothing to do in life anymore doesn’t mean you need to shit on people who are more successful than you on the internet.
---
I have no qualms about slow levelling. I’m just not so much into healing.
---
To be honest if you want to have a class which is solid as DPS and as tank, then Warrior is your only real option. Fans of Druids and Paladins try to make them work in every role, not without success necessarily; but warriors just work out of the box, no weird questions by the rest of the raid or people ignoring your whispers.
---
You think someone would do that? Make shit up for karma?
---
You can make 20-80g/hr grinding mobs. I'd say 50 is fair.
---
I guess it would be built upon trust and favors and also if you want the other faction to do the same for you.
---
i think he more means higher levels coming to his level area and stream sniping, if the same level is fighting him then i dont see a problem
---
Yeah they are trying to cover enhance and ele, rather strange for sure. Sure Enhance uses all those at the same time, spell power and spell crit is useful, and has some wasted stats. The extra stats (increase ghost wolf speed or something on boots or some part can't remember) is quite helpful.
---
And why not? Corpse camping is done to raise a reaction from the camped one.
---
You only ever going to get a reacon by either getting flamed by a level 1 char or by him logging off.
---
By camping a streamer, you get a live meltdown instead of a vague feeling of pissing somebody off.
---
god damn this reeks of jealousy and idiocy lol
---
Sigh... Here we go again
---
This is what the community is for.
---
While I get his perspective, its just entilted and you personally have the choice to go on a PvE realm. There is not a difference between you ganking someone and someone stream sniping you, that cant be argued in favor of it being relatively the same thing.
---
There is a very real chance I might get laid off from my job in the next month or two.
---
And I feel nothing but excitement.
---
Can you name your char the same as your reddit account so I can laugh when they farm you?
---
Stream sniping isn't griefing you mongoloid.
---
yep, freezing band
---
Silvermoon I generally don’t remember anything memorable. I was very young when I started playing, so to me I wouldn’t have been able to contribute much that time to anything that could have been memorable.
---
This time around, much older, and can finally take the game seriously off the very start, I am taking this “classic” server as a second chance to represent a realm, and contribute what I can do this time the realm I’m on is memorable.
---
How much fun if Blizzard kicked him from the Beta? :P
---
Yea I’m sure 100 of streamers and 100K followers will totally blacklist a person for ganking someone. 
---
Let’s just ignore the camping streamers are already doing to other streamers. I bet Esfand will really shed a tear when you kill his horde friend.
---
Holy shock is a ranged pull not an emergency heal.  Its great for a tank.
---
reee this spoils my kneejerk reaction
---
Wait but thats retarded
---
And in a game where people kill each other for fun, it doesn't exist.
---
&gt; I want Soda to send an emissary to my guild
---
Hey just a quick question, are you super into RP?
---
This guy has 40k viewers on his live stream at this moment. Bliz doesn't give a shit if he isn't reporting bugs. They're probably paying him to be a beta player.
---
These aren't new numbers for a new game, we know how long leveling takes. It takes nowhere near 720 hours to 60.
---
If I had the golden ticket I would snipe him just because this is such a stupid idea.
---
Jesus christ just don't play on streamer servers, must not be that hard since they'll probably play all together, mostly.
---
Probably because it’s not classic if you’re on one of these servers and people want to play classic.
---
Alex is that you?
---
"Beginning May 15, select WoW players will be invited to participate in a small-scale, focused closed beta test."
---
You’re gonna level 4 characters to 60 while keeping up with end-game content?
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
The problem is that streamers with inflated senses of their own importance get it twisted and immediately assume anybody who kills them is stream-sniping. People kill Tfue or Ninja once and are declared stream-snipers. And if Ninja declares you a stream-sniper on stream, you are guaranteed nasty tells at the very least, and possibly worse.
---
The issue isn't necessarily that, all these streamers call out stream sniping and other bullshit with little to no evidence. What if you get blacklisted just because you are in the wrong place, wrong time and kill a streamer? They have too much power, and they are trying to ruin the game for others.
---
dude the guys entire plan is to have every big streamer on the same server to have this blacklist, asmongold alone could fill a server with 10k ppl
---
Yeah, after some thought the last few days I think it's really between either druid or paladin. I feel like I'd play a druid if I didn't love dwarves so much. Anyways, it's not like classic is going anywhere for a while, so I guess I could play both. Might try each class out on private servers until release to decide on the first choice. Thanks for the response

Honestly I'm still pissed about it
---
I'm not trying to argue im  just saying I see where hes  coming from. If someone was literally trying to make in unplayable for you because you're streaming and they have absolutely nothing to gain from it I'd get upset to. Im fine with camping  my ass for hours so I cant get a world boss or your guild hates our guild so you want to annoy us/stop us from progressing etc, or if I'm taking your farming spot so you're going to kill me over and over so I don't contend with your nodes. All of this is fine and what is to be expected. Again when its just killing for no reason but to obviously be funny for the stream and this wouldn't happen for any other reason I can see where streamers would get salty. I think we agree with a lot of things but may just be misunderstanding each other. I'm talking about knowing they are stream sniping for the memes with 100% confidence. If youre not 100% sure I dont think its right to bitch about it or put  them on your arbitrary "blacklist"
---
implying its not stupid all on its own, kek
---
I much prefer watching Soda over Asmongold but damn sometimes he's a bit delusional. I understand the desire to be just a "normal" player but I think he still wants all the benefits that come along with being a huge streamer, such as getting priority in his guild when it comes to raiding and pvping, people randomly trading him gold/items/etc.
---
You can't taunt onyxia anyway so idk why you brought it up
---
Just makes me doubt you even more
---
I think I will be making another toon in the streamer server just to gank them. Hopefully a guild like &lt;Stream Killer&gt; or &lt;Stream Sniper&gt; is created and it's sole purpose is PvP with focus on streamers for the lulz
---
I do look at it from both sides. That's why I like people like Sonii and his stance on sniping, and can't stand little bitches like Soda who wants to be catered to and ban players that hurt his feelings. 
---
Also, that shit happened organically all the time in vanilla/TBC. People would look for specific targets and higher-profile players constantly. Or they'd be leveling/playing at the same time and see each other often. 
---
The point is that it's not against the rules to hunt the opposing faction, and any streamer using their influence to blacklist someone when they are knowingly sacrificing  anonymity and refusing to play on a PvE server is just ridiculous.
---
 Cmon buddy you can do it, you can think of another reply, here I’ll help you out.
---
I never said stream sniping wasn’t griefing :)
---
What I'm talking about is seal swapping like mentioned. You can procc soc+sol in one swing for example. Which made me wonder why SoC+SoR doesn't work as the only combination out of all
---
Totem twisting, windfury and Grace of Air.  An enhance can utilize downtime in their rotation to drop WF for the buff, then immediately drop GoA for the agi buff, then repeat before WF falls off.
---
A resto shaman doesn't have the spare time/globals/mana to do that.
---
Its a marginal threat increase for the cost of a dedicated DPS spec.  If a guild wants to make that tradeoff because they think its worth it, thats on them.
---
They will be wiped. Won’t be much of a “beta” if they weren’t
---
The graphics are amazing and still hold to this day, that's the point of it. I don't know how you could think like this as a "design major".
---
Let’s not even try the farce of thinking anything I said was or is not close to the mark.
---
dude I agree with you with basically everything. if you're killing someone because you don't want them to contest you're nodes, good. If youre killing someone because they are in a guild you hate or a player youve encountered before and youve established a rivalry, good. The problem I have is when its literally killing you for the memes and chat and you're getting absolute nothing out of it but satisfaction of ruining the stream. In my opinion these differences are easy to spot. Like I said before its probably best they just agree its a double edged sword to be a streamer. I'd be fine making millions playing the game and getting free shit if it meant the occasionally bullshit stream snipers, after all it wont be hard for them to get people to help them with said stream sniper. This was a good conversation, and its nice to see both sides of it :)
---
Been there with you too, rerolling every fresh. Got stale after a while. Would be nice to finally have ~20 ping and no China players.
---
Are you tight on space? If ~$300 is your budget and you already have a display and peripherals I'd suggest to you buying a used desktop computer. You'll get so much out of it. I recently sold my i5-2500k, 32GB ram, 2TB HDD space + GTX 670 for 350€ (with motherboard, I forget what and a case of course). That computer would run even newer games on medium graphics.
---
Gl with that
---
Understandable.
---
Did they Disney up the portraits in BFA too?
---
&gt;If someone was literally trying to make in unplayable for you because you're streaming and they have absolutely nothing to gain from it I'd get upset to
---
I don't think you understand the fact that you can't determine if someone is doing it because  you're a streamer or not, because of the nature of the game? Vanilla got people ganking each other for many hours, just because they can. How exactly are you going to determine if someone is stream sniping Soda for 1 or 2 hours, because he's a streamer, or it's because the guy ganking Soda just likes to gank and camp lowbies? You and I both know Soda and many other streamers will scream "Steam Sniper" when this happens, and in reality, they got no way of knowing if that's true or not.
---
&gt; Again when its just killing for no reason but to obviously be funny for  the stream and this wouldn't happen for any other reason I can see where  streamers would get salty. I think we agree with a lot of things but  may just be misunderstanding each other. I'm talking about knowing they  are stream sniping for the memes with 100% confidence. If youre not 100%  sure I dont think its right to bitch about it or put  them on your  arbitrary "blacklist" 
---
This applies to what I wrote above as well. You can't prove they're doing it to fuck over people because they're streaming, because in Vanilla, there's people ganking people all the time and it happens for hours sometimes. And for no reason.
---
The entire point is that we can both agree on it not being right to bitch about stream sniping unless you 100% know it. But fact is, in a huge majority of cases, unless you got logs of people saying they're doing it, because of that. You got no way of knowing they're stream sniping.
---
they are nor balanced around 51 talent points.
---
as much as i would like a dw enhancer shaman in vanilla it was just broken. (vanilla had a few weeks tbc talent trees before tbc release)
---
Honestly I totally understand why people don't care about this, but it does belong in this sub. It's about Classic WoW.
---
We have Classic WoW, but in 2019. Streaming is not going away, you know? That said I watch these streams and their ideas about this are terrible.
---
No, this happened far before streamers were a thing and will happen now that we have server communities again. Back in ye olde days, you'd have famous/well-liked people on the server that you'd get screwed over if you fucked with.
---
I played on Emerald Dream during MoP before sharding, and there was this guy called Himanshu.
---
If you fucked with Himanshu, 3 full raids of Horde would camp your ass for the next few hours. No joke, you can still find the forum posts on it. There were also people on the forums offering big amounts of gold for timestamped screenshots of people camping people they didn't like.
---
Then cross-server play and sharding came in and destroyed that part of the community, for better or worse.
---
This is nothing new and is a part of the game thats developed organically within communities. It's just been framed in a different way now because streamers are so popular now.
---
You also have to pray to rngesus. Our guild had neffy on farm for a good few months before I got mine as a warrior. The only one that ever dropped for us too.
---
I like how you think I said you can taunt her, I never did.
---
I also like how you doubt me but dont even know how fear or dragons work
---
In the first of few dungeons I did in bfa this one guy literally just spammed /laugh at me the whole time even during boss fights for completely unknown reasons.  And that was the only social interaction that happened in any dungeons I did.
---
I mean he did outline his reasonings for caring in the post.
---
I actually just hit 20 on a druid on a private server but I haven't done paladin yet. I'll shoot for maybe level 25-30 on each class, hopefully that will help me. Thanks for the help
---
Idk stream sniping in any game sucks... blacklisting might not be the answer to the problem.
---
turn off the stream. its his responsibility to stop the ganking, not everyone elses.
---
No, priorities. Stream other games and then play WoW on off time.
---
You Have more Sword.
---
where can you buy this???
---
&gt;Streamsniping is part of twitch, deal with it
---
Well it is, but it's also against their ToS and gets you banned.
---
All i hear is: "I made thousands of dollars of the people and now im gonna decide how they gonna play the game just so they won't ruin my streaming content and in doing so preventing me to make even more money". Jesus christ if you don't want to get stream sniped just don't stream.
---
I think you're friend is eating a lot of whats in the picture to make something like that lol. I like it really nice color blend.
---
Gname
---
Everything he says he contradicts himself later on. Saying its shunned to stream snipe  which will mostly involve camping but doesn't want to be shunned for  his own camping. Or when he says he blacklists a stream sniper and tells  him hey you could have picked a different server but instead won't pick  a non PVP server. he could've been the one to pick a different server.  
---
Accidental killings of streamers is like assaulting the king or  something and he starts crying and complaining he got streamsniped while  farming herbs because the other farmer killed him so he could get the  herb instead, then that guy gets blacklisted for playing the game in a  nonpacifist way.
---
 This guy just wants to receive little priviliges  without facing the downsides. At the end of the day, you know what  happens for his stupid human nature? Blizzard creates war mode. There's  your solution. Right? Oh wait, are we just appeasing to people's desire  for convenience over necessary and natural hardship so you can enjoy the  game more? Let's add a dungeon finder too so you don't get stream  sniped trying to get to your dungeons. Aw you poor little baby, you  can't gear up enough because you can't even get to raids? Or your  premade bg groups keep getting stomped by stream snipers? Let's add a  weekly pvp/pve chest so we can make sure you gear up while putting in  the minimal effort.
---
 Soda, you're going down the wrong path. You need to  realize your fame will bring in good and bad. The only solutions that  are true to classic is to play on a PvE server or realize you can't  control a whole server of BOTH factions that WANT TO COMPETE against  each other in the open world, PvE, and PvP by blacklisting people that  end up making you their bitch.
---
 You have to man up if you're on a PvP  server and gear up and play with groups to not get ganked and camped.  Otherwise, you might. At least you can play a stealth class and possibly  avoid that. You have every right to blacklist people on your own  faction with whoever will agree with you and even the other faction, but  should you? No. Enjoy an arbitrary PvP server if thats the case, with only organized pvp brawls or else the entire server is afraid of actual world pvp for blacklisting each other then camping/hunting each other. Or we have another solution, phasing! No one can stream snipe you if they  don't know what phase you're on. In its entirety, RIP sodapoppins for such a stupid idea that caters to your base human nature that led us to Retail WoW the way it is.
---
At the very least, if a player is breaking ToS by continously camping/ganking/harassing/etc a streamer or any player of course they deserve their due punishment.
---
Lfm moonbrook mines, need tanker, dd, cleric
---
No one is going to give thunderfury to a paladin, ashbringer isn't until naxx and the hungering cold doesn't drop until the last boxx from naxx
---
Definitely seems easier to just open twitch
---
If he was being paid to be a beta player he would have to announce it or else he would face legal issues.
---
the more clips I see of soda the more I dislike the guy
---
he's gonna throw a tantrum at regular innocent players that wreck his shit in pvp, just because they smoke him, and he'll try to get them blacklisted. I guarantee it
---
Should at least have a bank alt
---
Streamers don't want to do that. Interaction with the chat is HUGE with streaming and keeps the viewers engaged/wanting more. If you see the top streamers on twitch if they are personality streamers they are very active with they're chat the majority of the time. Putting a 5-10 min delay will completely eliminate that. Also either way its easy to find  with /who. You'll eventually find the person you want to kill and probably will give the stream sniper even more satisfaction because they stream sniped someone who took active precautions to stop it.
---
Think I remember in 2013, during MoP, when sodapoppin was playing WoW everyday, there used to be a guild which i don't recall its name specifically to kill streamers while they were live, i say this because they used to camp sodapoppin everyday on stream as soon as he exited bgs or arenas they were waiting on him. I remember this one mage called 'coneofcool', not sure if this is accurate but I think he was the GM of that guild, i know him since he used to streamsnipe soda a shitton and he also streamed. I can definitely expect something like this to happen in classic, especially because in vanilla there are not many ways to escape gankers; No fly mounts, no toys.
---
It's a beta test, you report bugs. It's common sense you dip shit
---
Good luck on your quest! Once you get both to 25, I would commend leveling them both to another benchmark (like 30 or something) and see how things are over time.
---
Paging /u/Theloras.
---
I see now. I didn't do the math regarding the drop rate percentages (I assumed he was correct, because from a glance it looked reasonable). But a factor of 10 is a huge difference lol. Looks like the Morrowgrain route is very inefficient, but is probably better than nothing if cloth turn-ins are not available. 
---
I have read a lot about rep values, and that even classicwowhead values (or the values of pre-TBC patches) are likely very wrong. Most people agree that it is impossible to reach exalted if you do all the quests from a faction by level 40. They mostly agree that the highest you'll get is halfway to revered. That's how stingy rep gains were.
---
On the other side, there are people who believe the databases and private server values and believe that getting to exalted by level 40-45 is more than do-able (this is all assuming no cloth turn ins btw, all by questing).
---
I'd like to see people play the classic beta and do a questing route for darnassian rep and see how much rep they can get by level 40, now that the max level has been raised to 40. At the end of the day, rep values on the beta will be the same on launch. Even better is if there were people with access to beta to do side by side comparison of rep gains versus private servers, just so we know how different classic will be compared to private servers when classic is released.
---
Thanks for the write up again. Bottom line is: Pray for cloth turn-ins.
---
Damn, and I thought I was the only one going through this issue.
---
While I will agree that they seem to be listening to the community attentively and doing a great job with Classic so far, don't think for a minute that they're doing it to be nice or whatever the fuck you claim. They don't care about the game or you or me or anybody else but their shareholders. They're doing a good job because they need to do a good job.
---
&gt; I got to give credit where it's due and so should everybody else, based on what they've seen them do with Vanilla
---
That's what I've been doing. I've not been critical of Blizzard at all, I'm just not giving them any credit for things they haven't done yet. I'm not a fortune teller, I just pretend to be one on TV.
---
If we’re the Blacklist can I be Dembe???
---
what's the issue with a sperg ganking a sperg?
---
real nice
---
- pve server - he wants to play regular pvp content
---
- stream delay - that goes completely against the point of streaming (talking to chat)
---
&gt; No one is forcing him to stream, so the "in my world we would act as if no one is streaming" talk sounds disingenuous. It's all self chosen pain
---
Imagine you went to a restaurant as a meat eater and vegans would come over and push food off your table every time you went to eat. It's self chosen pain! You could choose to eat at home! Or eat vegan! You have loads of options to prevent this!
---
&gt;he is seriously advocating a social credit score for "non streamers"
---
Let's put it bluntly: He is advocating for him and his friends to create a list of players who they will not play with, in order to discourage people using their stream as a GPS to hunt them down even in stealth, essentially cheating (because it's not possible to do that with other random players in classic).
---
But the good news is you're completely allowed to use any streamers stream to hunt them down, but you'll have to face the _social consequences_ of not being able to play with the streamer or their friends.
---
Being upset about this is like playing a game with a bunch of friends, but then cheating, and then getting mad that they won't let you play with them anymore. Feel free to cheat to gain an advantage, but people won't want to play with you.
---
&gt; if not then blizzard have once again ruined vanilla
---
This post is hilariously ridiculous. The fact that people are defending players(stream snipers) that intentionally try to ruin other's experiences is so so sad. It baffles me that these streamers are being griefed bad enough to suggest a blacklist. And we are only in the BETA. Spending your time trying to bother and grief other people is pretty pathetic, and defending those who do is just the same.
---
I will join such a guild, and roll rogue specifically for the sake of ganking streamers. 
---
Just name the server and faction.
---
&gt; They simply cant pull their own weight in Naxx. 
---
Naxx shouldn't be the benchmark since most will never ever set their foot there
---
once again?
---
The text above (in bold) makes it sound like you will be using MCP **even if** you had those weapons.

---
I don't know if you mean me, but I'm not a streamer... I just see how disruptive that shit is. Not the streamers themselves, just the drooling fanboy masses what will follow them around constantly doing dumb shit hoping senpai notices them. There are definitely a few streamers' fanbases I can see NOT acting that way. But they seem more like an exception IMO.
---
Loltyler1
---
probably because this is VANILLA and not TBC? that might be a good reason to not add it.
---
I understand that, but do you think some of the hardcore guilds won't also be doing this? You're essentially saying "it's not fair that they are more coordinated." Back in vanilla I remember trying to set up ventrilo, that was a nightmare. Now it's easy to use twitch/discord/you name it. The entire game is changed because we can *all* communicate and organize better, streamers or not. I understand they may see a heightened version of this organization but I'm a filthy casual so don't care who get AQ first, I just want to play on a PvP server and hang with the boys. I actually like seeing the crazy speed runs and creative ways people are working together.

That's not what it says at all, it specifically says "these weapons perform better IF YOU CAN GET THEM" but you will be mostly using manual crowd pummeler.

I just bind my stances to my mouse wheel.

1g/hr to protect a streamer? He's going to be well off enough to be paying 5-10g/hr.
---
Im gonna be honest, my aim was to play on the same server as Asmon, join his guild and "enjoy" his pvp/stream events and stuff, my goal is enjoy wpvp as much as I can... but now that I see this video of soda. Im totally down to join a guild like this to camp this entitled idiot who thinks he has the power to decide what you can and you cant do.
---
For the people saying soda is just trolling, its not that hard to imagine him crying to other streamers to get something (he wants) done, its actually sad.
---
I really pity the US WoW community for having to deal with this bullshit.
---
Greetings from Europe :-)

Streamer drama will be the best thing outside of classic.

"WAAAAHHHHH FUCKING STREAM SNIPERS"

*Camps a level 15*

"This is Ok because i'm just an asshole."
---
What the fuck is wrong with his brain?
---
I think some of it will be forced to try to recreate old socialization, then over time it will normalize. In the stress test there was quite a bit of socialization, however.
---
Jfc, I want to play vanilla like everyone else but I'd rather it look modern. You purists that want 2004 graphics suck.
---
While i havent watched the vid, if hes referring to stream sniping it is asshole behavior and if he wants to make a blacklist for people that do it then that's fine. You're free to follow him or not. It's an open world, it's kind of the point. He blacklists people who do things he doesnt agree with, you either play along or fight him. There's always been guilds that do similar things, usually just leads to good fun world pvp so just roll with it. I remember on emerald dream a few years ago there was an anti lowbie gank guild on alliance. They went after specific horde they had blacklisted. Also entire guild wars happened and that's basically a massive blacklist.
---
This whole thing just seems like worldpvp. Theres always people enforcing "the law" and people causing chaos and being assholes.
---
Competing against other people is always hard, no matter the game.
---
The top level of ANY competition is going to be tough.
---
I bet you there's a competitive knitting scene that will blow your socks off.

TL;DR: Game might be easy, being the very best at it isn't.

Name checks out, can confirm this is OP.

Then, when they inevitably kill you because you don't have good weapons or armor equipped, YOU WIN

Nowadays laptops are beginning to be a reality for gaming. Non-mobile versions of GPU's in laptops are starting to be common place but better than that. Thunderbolt3 ports and external GPU's are a thing.

Other than that I would much rather buy a $1500 desktop computer which is faster than your $3000 laptop and then just buy an $1000 Ultrabook for travel.
---
If Gnomes could be Paladins or Priests I'd be called Adorabubble
---
No, however the ingame sociability will be alot higher comparatively to other mmo games where there are queuing for everything and what not.
---
Less social than vanilla, more social than any expansion after BC probably.
---
It's not 2004 anymore. Sounds like you're gonna be disappointed either way.
---
I mean, it’s a reasonable thing to want, but he has to accept that with his chosen profession, this just comes with the territory. Pretty much every other online game takes the approach that if you stream, you’re knowingly giving your enemies an advantage and the consequences are on you. I’m pretty sure his attempt at blacklisting people will fail.
---
thank you!
---
So tell me, what's in the top of the totem in TB?
---
Yeah, wtf. I’m 25 and I write like that!
---
and 100% uptime, save
---
THat pally obviously is out of order. Its, Loh, then if not winning, Bubble + hearth + rude gesture emotes
---
Can you maybe give an example as I have only slighy insight into this topic?
---
People spamming emotes or translating shit has been in the game since the dawn of time.
---
the ooga gang for example writing c c a f to translate that to "ooga" for the alliance could very well just be PvPing for their next funny PvP video like verycoolguy:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUAI6ABS3-U&amp;t=174s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUAI6ABS3-U&amp;t=174s).
---
Purging world buffs from raid attendees is just random fun to piss people off.
---
I'm really not quite sure how you would be able to make a distinction between an asshole troll and a streamsniper because both are here to get a reaction from his victim.
---
I would say Soda would accuse Angwe of streamsniping if such a guy would emerge on his server:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dkyd/i\_am\_angwe\_the\_ganker\_god\_of\_world\_of\_warcraft\_ama/](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dkyd/i_am_angwe_the_ganker_god_of_world_of_warcraft_ama/)
---
Haha boosting imagination
---
Definitely.
---
I do grind a lot while leveling though. Mostly as a Warrior to keep ahead of my quest mobs in level to make things flow smoother.
---
I usually only stop and grind if I find a good spot with good enemies that I can kill quick with low downtime.
---
If I find a good one, like Whelps in Swamp of Sorrows. I may just spend a whole play session or two farming there while watching Netflix. Then go back to questing another day.
---
The drops at 30+ are valuable at 60 so it's a good way to make money as well.
---
Yeah but 20-30 is hard on the server.
---
&gt;  whats the problem?
---
That people will counter with their own communities and guilds that promote stream sniping and reward based on it. I actually love this tho, it's sort of like a bounty system where pissing off the streamers earns you rewards.
---
If you're only looking to kill mobs and don't anticipate questing, make sure you're killing mobs 3-4 levels lower than you. The idea is to have zero downtime drinking and sustaining minimal damage. Rotate between wisdom and light if you need to regen. 
---
Look into investing in a skull flame shield when you get to mid 50 because AOE grinding becomes trivial after that.
---
I’ll give you the same response I got on the forums when I mentioned this.
---
Play with war mode on if you want to be in danger.
---
I fully understand, I used to play when my ex-wife slept. WoW is not a thing I want to keep separate in my new relationship, it’s part of me that I want to share as it’s where I spend my free time. 
---
I won’t be able to put the hours in I used to, I’m not 19 anymore. Gotta put those hours in playing princess superheroes and doing grown up stuff.
---
There’s plenty of free time to be had on Thursday evenings and the occasional Saturday lunch time.
---
&gt; You think all 50k people that watch him will roll on the same server as him? The dude didn’t even have that much effect on retail and he was much bigger then. 
---
You do realize that only 10% of that makes up a realm, right? You do realize that more of his streamer friends will join the same realm, so it's not only HIS audience anymore, right?
---
Besides... you can't do that in retail because of cross-realm play. Not even mentioning in retail the individual server size is much larger than in Classic.
---
&gt; You think you’re going to join one of soda friends guilds? 
---
Why would I even try to join one of those guilds? LOL does the fact that I won't do it, automatically mean that nobody will?
---
&gt; You think asmon will blacklist you from the guild because you killed his horde friend? The same friend that kills him every day??? 
---
I don't know.. I don't know the guy. I know that soda's friends will
---
&gt; You think half decent guilds won’t take you because you ganked a horde streamer? Wake up. 
---
You keep ignoring the fact that the streamer audiences will make up a ridiculously large portion of the server population.
---
Math done by someone who isn't credible isn't credible, indeed.
---
I wouldn't trust Alex Jones to calculate the circumference of his own ass, for instance.
---
Those names all sound pretty familiar, I'm sure I saw you guys around. We used to bring some War Front people along to MC/BWL farm raids but I wasn't very close with many people outside of the guild. I was Outphase, a human priest. My first character was Orangerange, a night elf rogue, but I abandoned him after the transfer.
---
The fact that it's classic.
---
&gt;but there are so many TBC QOL improvements
---
Did it occur to you, that the reason Retail has become the shitfest it is, is BECAUSE of the "QoL improvements"?
---
&gt;I have a hard time believeing there is a reason they shouldnt be added.
---
Here is your reason:  
---
The game is called "CLASSIC". Not TBC, not Classic+, not Classic-Balanced. CLASSIC.  
---
That is what we want to play.
---
ok, leave zone and they don't follow you. Good he wasn't sniping. Leave zone he follows and continues to try and make life hell, obvious sniper. Like I said when its OBVIOUS 100% that they are sniping is where I see they are coming from. I really don't think its as hard to tell as you're making it out to be. Yeah their are times when its questionable and during those times they should be given the benefit of doubt. Also you'll recognize names and start getting the gist of who is a potential sniper or not. After a few interactions with the player it really isnt that hard to tell.
---
I played since closed beta, but sure thing sally.
---
Are there any addons that support that kind of thing? If not, I kind of want to make one.
---
he wasn't complaining about getting killed but streamsniped, you people who upvote this crap without having full context are the cancer of gaming
---
Then he can’t talk about the game anymore.
---
No. I think in general socialization will occur, but Classic won’t be as communicative as Vanilla simply because it’s a different time.
---
Pretty much what I previously said, yeah. He aknowledges that blizzard won't create an official streamer realm, so he proposes doing this blacklist thing a widespread rule across one realm of their choosing. Effectively imposing their rules to players who don't give a shit about streamers, why? Because they've got the numbers to do it
---
If you don't know now, you will soon ... they're making a rescue Rangers movie soon.
---
I was more scientific. I stuck a pin in a series of charts and let the universe decide.
---
Cx
---
I never knew a man could stick his head that far up his own ass
---
Make this happen, i already identify as a member of the ruthless guild "The Blacklist"! Let's go!
---
Just exchange bnet tags now in a PM. Also PM me yours if you are going to be in a PVP realm! Always down for more friends!
---
Sad part is, thats probably true. Make it 100g/hr if soda says his name ever now and then
---
I’m not worried about it, but the people who are are certainly justified. That’s like saying people shouldn’t worry about them adding flying in classic and telling them LUL JUST DEAL WITH IT.
---
That's because this game is like heroin and most people here are going through withdrawal
---
I hope everyone on this sub knows by now that he and other streamers say this shit to trigger the anti-streamer crowd.
---
Yeah I’ve only seen it drop once with months of farming. And for a HUNTER to get it is even more rare. But it would still be put to good use tbh
---
I get it :) but you don't get the org fp til you run there first
---
If you gank someone, do not be upset if you are socially outcast from their groups. That's part of the game. I really honestly do not see the problem?
---
Who cares about weapon type when the spec is 2H fury?
---
I believe most of the socializing is moved to platforms such as Discord instead of in-game but there will be a higher amount of social things to do than in retail.
---
lol i guess, but classic has both if you play on a PvP server, and we actually have been leveling with warmode. We got griefed at low level quest hub by some 120s but thats about it so far. Everyone just has it shut off so theres not even other people to fight it feels like, at least so far.
---
Between Discord, YouTube and Twitch I think a lot of the social aspects of the game will happen OUTSIDE the game.
---
Even ways to form groups. I fully believe there will be a "social norm" of using a 3rd party means to better effectively for a group, be it Reddit, Discord or an App. 
---
Much like how for a while there "Gear Score" was a must have to get groups formed.
---
&gt;ok, leave zone and they don't follow you. Good he wasn't sniping. Leave zone he follows and continues to try and make life hell, obvious sniper.
---
You can't prove they're doing it because you're streaming. It's not unseen gankers/campers choose a few people and focus on them.
---
Dudes a dickhead.
---
Mate ... this is asmongold if you hadn’t realised lol
---
I mean, if they wanna make a blacklist, let them. its up to each individual raid leader to determine who comes and goes. At the same time, there is no difference between canping a level 15 and stream sniping. He is just pissed because he gets targeted more often. Just take it or deal with it. Blacklisting people for that is just ridiculous imo
---
Germans are certainly one of the worst when it comes to english. You don't have to search for evidence. It's everywhere.
---
Or you know, stop caring about stream sniping him and play the game instead? 
---
But that's non of my business
---
Something tells me you’re more successful in life than I am.
---
By far the best thing about official servers, in 5 years the characters i make in a few months will still be there. Awesome.
---
Yes, asmongold is a moron, this is news.
---
can you confirm this works as of the latest build? (after level cap raise)
---
this bug might have been fixed since then.
---
judging from the beta it will be about the same as it is now
---
Honestly dude hop on retro-wow, get some prebis, go out to burning stepes or epl, somewhere with mid 50s-high 50s mobs....and try them out.
---
That's straight up History!!!
---
The game is using latest API/LUA or whatever system that's in retail but it will be more restricted than we had early on in Vanilla. No auto de-cursing etc.
---
level 2 warrior. Accidentally pull 2 mobs come back and tell us what happens. Then go pull 3. No need to come back though we know how that one ends. :D
---
Trudeau smiles upon you.
---
Ever since the date of wow classic was announced, time had moved so slowly for me. I’ve got Blizzard to thank for my new found immortality.
---
Hardcore guilds will in fact be doing that. But that's a team of people who agreed upon a particular designated target and worked for a long period of time to get there. A streamer will be able to leverage their popularity in a guild to demand the Scarab Lord role, and they'll have a *lot* more farmers than the typical HC guild will be able to put out. Instead of the race for Scarab Lord being viewed (in my opinion, correctly) as a "guild versus guild" race, it will instead be a "single externally popular guy versus guild versus guild" race, with the first party being able to deploy three times as many farmers at all hours of the day.
---
That's not to say that they will succeed in outracing the progression guilds, and they'll likely be part of a progression guild themselves. But it nevertheless perverts the base dynamic of that fight from a team competition to a solo-player vanity parade. [And before you say that streamers wouldn't resort to using their public leverage in order to demand items, this was Sodapoppin in TBC after losing a Warglaive roll.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWAdB8IEb_o) I'd like to think he's a more mature person now. But This is still a serious perverse element of the Classic metagame that, unlike other external changes such as better voice communication programs, unilaterally favors streamers.
---
Personally I can tell you that during MoP there was a guild on his server to specifically kill stream snipers.Nothing ever happened to them. He used to get ganked every single days after doing arena, for hours on end.
---
Yes man I know that there are people that are just assholes. It's still easy to see who snips though man. Like if youre a stealth class and they just run to you and know where you are, sniper. Constantly killing you in a zone, you switch zones and they follow you, sniper. Things like this where you're 100% sure its a sniper is what Im talking about. If they are not  100% sure  then Id say give them the benefit of the doubt. Since its vanilla you'll recognize names and start getting the gist of who is a sniper/potential sniper. It really isnt as hard as people are making it seem to spot the difference. Its fine if they are killing you so you dont contest their farming spots, killing you because there is a guild/player rivalry that has happened organically, or kill you because they dont want you to tag world bosses. This is all fine and I love it, again im speaking for the blatant as fuck stream snipers lol.
---
If you don't want to deal with streamers, don't play on streamers servers.
---
I don't want to deal with Asians, so I don't play on Illidan.
---
I don't want to deal with Aussies, so I don't play on Frostmourne
---
But how can they impose rules on players who don't give a shit about streamers when the rules are literally about you know.. people who cares about streamers. Some random dude who doesn't know of twitch isn't going to be affected by any of these rules, unless if specifically there is mistakes about who is and isn't streamsniping. I can somewhat understand the fear of randomly killing a guy who is streaming and being accused of being a streamsniper, but honestly I doubt that's how it's going to be, and it is certainly not the intention. The intention is to get rid of toxic streamsnipers who spend absurd amount of time specifically hunting down streamers by watching their stream.
---
I doubt anyone know's how much soda makes except himself and whoever does his taxes, but I'd be surprised if it was less than $300,000/year. I know the big streamers make millions a year, and soda is one of the bigger streamers. Considering he's been doing it for 5+ years now i'd say it's very likely he's made at least 2-3 mil from streaming and quite possibly 5+.  
---
Yes that's USD. Yes it's pretty weird that 20 year old kids make millions from playing computer games all day. Welcome to 2019.
---
I’m impressed by the quality of this, that was a nice printer considering this is probably 15 years old.
---
Mind passing that info on once you receive too?
---
Yeah because I’m the one targeting people trying to do their own thing and nitpicking every little thing they do and gather to bully them.  You people are gross.
---
I wouldn't mind it being filtered out until all Phases have come out for Classic.
---
Raid leaders in vanilla needed warm bodies more than anything so all this shade being thrown at pallies is silly
---
You said "they actually care about the game," and I inferred that you were trying to claim they were doing this out of some sense of benevolence stemming from sentiment they hold for their product or playerbase. I assure you there is no such sentiment.
---
&gt;Adding anything outside of the very set 'rules' and understand of what made Vanilla good, is ruining one of the core aspects of WoW , and is going to lose them a lot of money.
---
And after a few months/years if they run the numbers and determine it will make them more money than they will lose they will do it 100%. That's all I was saying. I wasn't saying that they are going to do this, only that they potentially *could* do this.
---
Me too LOL
---
Why wouldn't I ?
---
I understand having a problem with stream-sniping, but I do not understand having a problem with World PvP, even ganking, on PvP servers. How are you going to police whether or not you're being ganked by a stream sniper and not someone who managed to find you by other means?
---
This is unenforceable and therefore pointless.
---
They always catch me as I’m sneaking around them
---
Maybe we can hope for the best and see some awesome world-PvP. Imagine streamers beeing guarded by their followers etc. Building up some PvP and fun interactions, remember Classic WoW is soo much fun because of the social interactions :)
---
Every streamer on every game has people trying to fuck with them, it's part of the job description. Streamers trying to actively influence and undermine the in-game community because they are salty is pretty fucked up.
---
Hah sounds about right, bloody bubble boys.
---
Yeah it was a server name, I had a few characters there.
---
Scum? For pvping in a pvp game. If you were playing counter strike and got owned over and over by someone because they were better than you, you'd call them scum?
---
Welcome to pvp my friend. I'm going to terrorize lowbies on my server :)
---
Gnomes are often named after their invention.
---
Fizzspanner for example
---
Basing my time on the stress test and on retail, it is night and day difference. From what I have seen it will be, at least very close
---
That’s how I thought it would work. Higher levels see you easy and lower levels you can sneak circles around them. But yes it’s a private server
---
you are correct.
---
Eye should have 1 hp and not transfer aggro to the warlock, according to patch 0.1
---
33 year old me just feels old as fuck seeing this kids hand writing lol.
---
I am currently playing on a private server since I got no beta invite. And yes, yes it will and for me is just as social as it was back then. You play level and see the same people over and over again as you level up so you naturally get to know each other.  It’s not the lfg tool itself that killed the social experience it’s the server linking in and out of lfg that killed it.
---
Shh everybody enjoy uys spending hours into a raid just to  gear a few peoples
---
Honestly only something time will tell. I for one am hoping that everyone becomes more social to really bring back the glory of the game. Even now a days on retail when you have to do group activities I feel like no one is social, maybe because they’re bots? I feel like there might be whole lot more negativity throughout classic for an example let say you don’t know a certain mechanic, chances are you’ll get trolled on cause you should of known about it since it’s been there since vanilla. Almost like a lot of elitism since a lot of the player base will be veterans.
---
Basically I have 2-6 friends playing wow depending. Myself and other other reliable guy are wow vets, and he's rolling a priest. 
---
Our other friends are noobs, so if we want to get geared and do dungeons together someone has to tank. 
---
So I was choosing between warrior and druid, and I wanted to pick warrior, but I'm really afraid of having to farm pots for threat AND mitigation for every fucking raid. 
---
So my plan is to tank all the way until our group has pre raid BiS then switch to healing raids. 
---
I'd actually rather be a fury offtank but I'm worried about getting a spot like that, do you think I'd be fine?
---
Why would you want to run around autoattacking things?
---
I’m already addicted even though I haven’t played it yet
---
Yeah, I'm surprised viewers didn't show up.  I watched highlights from streams and one was from Summit 1G who had like 5 rogues popping out of stealth everytime he got attacked.  He wasn't even grouped with them or anything, they were just viewers helping him out.
---
Wait what numbers did they use? Original classic data or private servers?
---
Wondering if these are accurate if from private servers.
---
you got a few good years left if you don't get hurt! I want to get into climbing, gotta sort this fucking shoulder out...seems like a dislocating shoulder may not be a good idea in that sport.
---
The gaming culture has changed a lot. If you look at the private servers they are not so socially engaging as back in the day. It's still a huge difference from BFA or any other modern MMO.
---
There is just too many hypothetical/anecdotal arguments people can pull to try and prove their argument. There is  really no changing opinions on this in my opinion. With that I guess we will agree to be on board with 90% of what is being discussed lmao. At the end of the day we both love classic and can't  wait for its release so take care man, this was a fun discussion :)
---
boo hoo?
---
Corpse camping is and the ones that do it will get banned, and you’ll still be mad bro LMFAO.
---
Lots of streamer collected information of their streaming opponent via spies when PvP clashes happened.
---
You can easily log in and have the name of any high profile PvP within couple minutes. 
---
You log on, open your kill list for today and get going on killing each 5 times before moving on to the next.
---
You do that ever day for an hour as this is your wPvP driven content and I can assure you people will start to call you a streamsniper for having open world fun.
---
Considering hes mentioned that some sponsors offer him 10k+ per hour to play their games, I'm sure hes made bank. Hell he made 17k in a single sellout sunday once where he had the dono counter on screen.
---
Streamers are not gonna roll on PvE servers. In the video he actually says no to the idea (scoffs even).
---
If the Vega 3 in that CPU performs like Vega 3 in Athlon 200GE then yes, although the value on such laptop won't be the best.
---
I hate streamers.
---
On multiple occasions I've had them not wait their turn for a named mob when our party was full, and they attempt to ninja the mob, ask for special treatment, etc, their response is always "but I'm a streamer". They seriously feel like they have an entitlement.
---
You’re missing the point that it is Soda’s choice to broadcast his location at all times, play on a PVP server, and stream without any delay. No one has a gun to his head forcing him to do any of those things, he can make obscene amounts of money on stream just reacting to media once a week if he wanted. Additionally, along with gankers, streamers also have tons of people on their faction willing to protect them and help them in world pvp. 
---
What about people who don’t want elites pulled into the city? Do you care about the fact that streamers are “ganking” them without permission? It’s well known that tons of low levels will be in all major cities at any given time.
---
You're just a piece of shit, it's okay. Fuck you and fuck asmon too.
---
Go Ret bro, go Ret.
---
AQ is going to be warped because everyone now knows what they need to turn in for the war effort. I intend to farm the shit out of rune cloth to make rune cloth bandages. I want the 3 characters i intend to play all be exulted with undercity so they can have the undead horse (coolest mount in the game!) I hope to turn in 1000s of them on day one of the war effort. 
---
In vanilla you didn't get  to prep like that. Your server was just one day asked to turn in 400000 runecloth bandages and millions of other items.
---
You know Blizzard will never add flying to classic, not really a great argument.
---
It's an objectively retarded view to have though, regardless of whether not he's tRoLlInG this dude has a lot of sway and needs to watch the stupid shit he says.
---
Placenta
---
Oh i see, thanks for the intake
---
Install, pick the class and race that most appeals to you, and have fun. Explore the world. Do lots of quests. Form groups to adventure through dungeons. 
---
If you get through the first 10-20 levels and find yourself not enjoying the class you picked, dont worry about starting fresh with a new character. It's a long journey to 60, so you want to make it count.
---
As a veteran player my one wish would be to experience the game for the first time again. Soak it all in.
---
Nice argument grandpa. A couple insults that make no sense. Hahahaha
---
Then he can toggle pvp on in a pve server.
---
Private server. I doubt it would be possible to obtain reliable data from actual Vanilla content.
---
Hey everyone! Everyone! It could be worse.....there could be, goblins or werewolves.
---
&gt;You said "they actually care about the game," and I inferred that you were trying to claim they were doing this out of some sense of benevolence stemming from sentiment they hold for their product or playerbase. I assure you there is no such sentiment.
---
You can't prove there is no such sentiment, though. Just like I can't prove they might actually care about it, because they have said things like, they want it to remain as close to how it was, with the right QoL features, so people could experience how Vanilla was. And want to continue having the game online, so even though it isn't popular, people can still play it. 
---
&gt; And after a few months/years if they run the numbers and determine it  will make them more money than they will lose they will do it 100%.  That's all I was saying. I wasn't saying that they are going to do this,  only that they potentially *could* do this and I'm not wrong. 
---
I can't argue against you being skeptical. I just honestly thought people weren't going to be that as this point. You do you, though.
---
&gt; THE OTHER FACTION ON A PVP SERVER TO BLACKLIST PLAYERS FOR PVP!
---
Will just get people to help those "blacklisted" even more.
---
I had a streamer I had no idea existed complain that I followed them around ganking them in eso. Ah yes, a max rank PvPer is following around some literal who with 200 viewers. The narcacissm streaming can breed is astounding.
---
He will make it legal
---
I mean, dungeons are a very slow way to level after the initial quest run. But if you have a good group and patience, anything is possible. At least you'll have be geared to the teeth for the next 10-15 levels before you start replacing gear.
---
Technically nothing is stopping me from doing this. But time, ambition and burnout are all factors here. 
---
I will be leveling an alt mage most likely for farming and profs for money generation, but ultimately I won’t be going to the lengths I go on my main for Alts, things like rep grinding, pvp ranks, rare mounts; It’s a lot for one character let alone 3-4. 
---
Power to anyone who does it but my main will be my breadwinner character, the one I identify as, so to me it’s a big decision. It’s part of what I love about vanilla. Yeah I may have a mage alt and possibly another character a year or two from now, but I will always be a priest to anyone that knows me.
---
No alts? 
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Been told by about a dozen people that they're gonna camp wetlands on classic. I have a feeling wetlands are going to be the new tarren mill this time around... Or until blizzard boosts the guards to the point that it's not feasible.
---
I can almost garantee you lose some reaction speed by having everything on mouse buttons. Since you use only 1 finger to press them (your thumb, also it's your fattest finger, so gl not fat fingering the wrong keys from time to time. 
---
Better to use all of your fingers.
---
Because the gaming culture is completely different in Europe.
---
"Gamer" in the US is nowadays a person who participates in a subculture that is all about gaming merchandise and following "community idols" around in social Media. This participation and community interaction has become more important, than the actual act of gaming itself. This subculture lends itself to exploitation by companies and influencers.
---
Over here on the other hand, a Gamer is...well...someone who likes playing videogames. I am a bit older, in my mid-30s, but the people I meet at conventions and LAN events, 12-15 years my juniors, are no different then me at their age: Nerds, who like playing games, who like playing games WELL, who build, maintain and upgrade their own rigs.
---
This is not meant as a diss towards the US, but when I see people from the States asking questions like "will this computer run WoW", I always have to chuckle, because it's unfathomable to me, that a Gamer is incapable of answering such a simple question for himself.
---
Sounds like you want a safe space then. If i see a player named skillgodx, im attacking to see if hes really good. 
---
If i see "famous streamer name" im attacking him for playing on my realm. Red is dead if you dont like it go RP
---
You know you can't make  xfaction characters on pvp servers right?
---
Yeah, that's also a problem. But that is, again, a problem that's multilateral. Everyone is dealing with the same thing, and nobody really gets an advantage over anybody else.
---
It's not that streamers change the dynamic of the game. It's that they specifically change the dynamic of the game *in their favor* by mere virtue of existing. Many things about Classic won't perfectly approximate Vanilla for many reasons, but at least those inaccuracies don't, on the whole, give an advantage to specific handfuls of people.
---
This anti streamer hate is really bullshit behavior. Its like toxicity and envy rolled into one.
---
A lot of socially well adjusted people in this thread. /s
---
I know how taunt works, but you brought it up as if it was relevant...
---
You also falsely claimed it doesn't give you top threat while it does. It *also* forces the mob to attack you for a few seconds. It does both! But it would be largely useless if it didn't also put you on top of the threat table.
---
I do know how dragons work. You don't need to stand in tail or face. They have sides
---
I don't know how fear interacts with threat, clearly that invalidates the whole argument. But you also don't, because it doesn't "reset threat for a substantial amount" because that's an oxymoron. :\^)
---
Btw, how does the feral druid hold aggro when he also gets feared by onyxia? It's an aoe fear. I don't think you have any clue what you're on about, but I am open to the possibility that I am wrong. Wouldn't the tank just pop berserker rage, instead of all this offtanking business?
---
I can’t stand streamers.  Every time I’ve ever been in a group with one or seen one in the wild I can’t help but roll my eyes at these people, especially their fan base.  If you can’t handle stream sniping then don’t stream.  Just because you stream doesn’t give you some extra privilege or special rights over normal players.  I say we start a list to black list streamers and all the weird twitch kids.
---
On twitch guidelines RIGHT here at the bottom https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/ 
---
*Any activity, such as cheating, hacking, botting, or tampering, that gives the account owner an unfair advantage in an online multiplayer game, is prohibited. This also includes exploiting another broadcaster's live broadcast in order to harass them in-game, such as stream sniping.*
---
It’s not a matter of whether or not they would actually add flying to classic, it’s a matter of what would classic be with flying? Not classic. The same if you have to deal with some of the streamer communities. The core experience isn’t anything close to vanilla, and that’s the entire point of classic.
---
I remember brethren. Think y’all were like top tier on the server. I was in XISSOU.
---
Which streamer are you cock guzzling atm?
---
As social? Depends on the social aspect, more whiny yea. But like others have posted the culture is just different now, people are more easily offended and will let you know right away.
---
Seriously. Want to monetize? Start a Youtube channel. Record, edit and post.
---
I tried leveling for fun on a well known private server and I just couldn’t get passed level 10 knowing this is all going down the tube 2.5 months from now
---
My hero.
---
serious, its like he didn't know you could mail items to your alt or something XD
---
No I agree streamers will have stupid weird Dynamics accompanied by them. But I don't think Blizzard should do anything about it. I think if they make "streamer only servers" it'll kill it. Or whatever measures. I'm a favor of Blizzard taking no part in interfering with the game, asking them to opens too many doors. And again I'm a casual and I'm sure I'll never even see AQ40 so maybe I shouldn't have a say? I just don't have the time to commit but I'll play casually and hopefully have a good time
---
Good luck with what?  No one ever said I was rolling a shaman with the intent on playing enhance in raids, and no one ever said I was bringing an enhance with me to my own raids.
---
I'm just giving you examples of why its not the end of the world if you brought one because your bestie is a fucking derp but damnit you love him and he can come to your raids.
---
Holy Pally FTW
---
Remember Mr. Grimmmz and his like 3 seconds of fame outside of H1Z1, and people realized how much of a giant douchebag he was since he reported everyone under the sun for "hacking" or "stream sniping" ?
---
This is just a different version of what would actually happen in Vanilla. People on certain servers would gain reputations as ninja looters and such and thus would be left to the wolves. I’m not saying I agree with him, but acting like this won’t happen is ignorance.
---
Exactly my thought. a boomy in the mage group increases 4 mages crit chance, and DPS by more then 3% per mage. I dont know that a mage is more then 12% better dps then a geared boomy. ANd then the fact that you get a battle rez, and an innervate.
---
The melee group needs some derp to drop a battle chicken, using a trinket slot, why not let his dude play his Ret-adin, grab that +15% spell damage axe, and use his trinket to make the team of rogues go hard? while increasing spell damage for the mages
---
Warrior for sure imo. I mean, he rarely uses a bow (in the films) and the hunter class in WoW is very much tied to the pet fantasy, something he doesn’t have. 
---
I’d say he’s an arms warrior
---
I've always lobbed him in with XqC and Pewdiepie as the biggest entitled douchebag toxic asshole streamers out there. Screechy kids in grown men bodies, passin along the shithead mindset to the younger generations.   
---
It's pathetic.
---
Feed him a bit more even after he gets happy, and feed him higher level meat if needed, he should stay happy for a while before going neutral, obviously if he dies he becomes unhappy.
---
Did you not see my reasoning to why I don’t want a streamer on my server?
---
Just to name a few issues:
---
1. HUGE queue times. Asmon has 40k viewers at a time. Imagine the queue times for his server. I don’t have time to sit in a massive queue.
---
2. If the big streamer stops playing, your server could possibly die due to follower count re-rolling elsewhere or moving to the next game to follow the streamer.
---
3. Scarab lord and the such will pretty much be handed to the streamer. I will get nowhere near this, but I’d rather it be someone deserving .
---
4. Streamers using their power to blacklist you. Soda actually just had a stream talking about maintaining a blacklist for people who camp him.
---
Being rolled by a streamer isn’t even on my list. That is a non-factor. It’s all the other stuff that comes with them.
---
As soon as you raise the level cap, all of your end-game content (MC, BWL, AQ, ZG, Naxx, Ony, several world bosses) immediately become pointless. Why raid molten core for rare level 60 epics if you can get a level 70 green with better stats?
---
If I had to list the three big things that hurt modern WoW the most, it would be raising the level cap, free-flight, and cross-realm/teleportation for dungeons and raids. TBC is what, 2.5-3 out of 3 on that list?
---
The only way to add TBC to the game without damaging it in the exact same way that happened last time would be to squash all the stats on everything down to 60.
---
Hey! Your guides on Nost are amazing, have helped immensely. You are doing the god's work, my friend.
---
&gt;It's self chosen pain! You could choose to eat at home! Or eat vegan! You have loads of options to prevent this!
---
Or i could call the police because there is someone breaking the law? What a dumb analogy 
---
&gt;essentially cheating (because it's not possible to do that with other random players in classic)
---
What part of him streaming is his own choice did you not get? It's not even close to cheating. He made his bed as they say. This is the sort of entitled attitude that people dislike. At the end of the players arent doing anything wrong and he is encouraging a target to be placed on his back by acting like they are.
---
I literally watched the fucking video. You have to be an absolute gaga-fanboy to think he wasn't saying exactly that.
---
"I camp people because I'm an asshole, that's different." Literally what he fucking says.
---
In his retarded mind, it's ok for him to camp people, but not for people to camp him i.e. "strem sn1p1ng".
---
Ya, I don't know who he is. I can name 5 or 6 streamers for WoW but he's not one of them.
---
That's what world pvp is thought arent any rules. If you gank someone and they want you dead so be it. That's world pvp. Making a hate thread is a waste. Just kill em if you want or dont. Actions have consequences.
---
None of this is new btw. There've always been blacklist pvp guilds on pvp servers. Guild wars are still things that happen.
---
A large streamers ego couldn't handle that, especially the launch of a big game. 
---
It's what would make sense, but then they wouldn't feel special when playing without their stream.
---
There's honestly no other option for them to take if they don't go PvE.
---
They'll cry about getting ganked. Their mindless loyal sheep will cry louder, and they'll make bank doing it.
---
Is this not in English?  I can't tell if another language or just illiterate...
---
Scroll forward, Scroll back, Press down? I feel like I'd always press down when trying to scroll in a panic.
---
I’m not referencing streamers. I’m talking to streamers with big viewer counts. Like Asmongold, Soda, etc.
---
Leveling definitely takes longer. Not sure I would call it harder. Its more immersive as well without a doubt in vanilla
---
plus his name is inappropriate
---
Zalgradis Paladin pvp
---
people who work and then donate to streamers who play video games all day for a living are a special kind of stupid.
---
That's so fucking sad.
---
Make it into a mousepad man
---
Never said they should, mind you. I was merely stating that there are two reasons why *players* would want to avoid streamer servers, not anything about official Blizzard policy.
---
You can raid up to AQ40 casually. I don't think item level will be a thing, it wasn't on private servers, usually the recruiter would inspect you and ask a few questions in discord.
---
You gotta raise their loyalty up and then the need for constant feedings will go down.
---
Either stream and don't complain about the things that entails or don't stream and get to play the game like everyone else. I'm sorry they are whiny children who don't want to have to deal with game mechanics, but in that case PvE servers solve that problem 100%. If they are having pvp problems there is a pvp solution, and blacklisting people and fucking with the community to try and punish people playing the game is cancer.
---
All the more reason why streamers are fucking worthless garbage.
---
he doesn't need/want the money
---
he want the attention
---
There is more socializing in the Beta than I have seen in Retail.  However it seems that the majority in the Beta are old-timers from Vanilla or earlier, so it may just be the demographic of players that is making it more social.
---
Ask world chat.  
---
Ask your guild.  
---
Pay a bounty.
---
Pay people 2g for a heads up where the player is lounging about.
---
Use Opium to insta target once you cornered the vague location via same facion comms.
---
just in time for school to start back up and all the kids to flunk out
---
So basically there will be guild wars. A normal part of world pvp. Nothing happening here is anything to be outraged at
---
I never even watched his streams. But there's a big difference between streamsniping and camping but you are too blinded by hate to see the difference iguess.
---
Really beacuse I can kill 10 mobs at once as my warrior in BFA by just spamming whirlwind and i dont even lose health with bloodthirst / victory rush  but if i play a warrior in vanilla and pull 3 mobs im completely fucked
---
Me too. We had back in the day, The Blacklist addon where you can see the blacklist of your fellow guild mates.
---
We were a veeeery aggresive pvp guild haha and even help people when it got ganked except if they were in the ninja list
---
On a PvE server they would have a case in some scenarios where it could be considered griefing under blizzard's own existing TOS.
---
PvP server is different. Being killed by the other faction you have the option to kill them back and the line of griefing has way more gray area. 
---
If they want Blizzard to solve their issue they're better off rolling on a PVE server rather than a PVP server. 
---
Like, if you stream and you get benefits from all your fan boys, you have to deal with people hunting you down in PVP. That's the price you pay and the risk you take.
---
But soda has always been a little bitch and streams his personal drama for views and sympathy $$$. Itll never change.
---
If streamers want to create a blacklist, cool. However, advertising the persons name on their stream is where I get tripped up. Because there are mindless drones watching these people and will do whatever the streamer says. They even will go overboard and harass said player.
---
&gt; Player grieving is against the TOS
---
Yes but corpse camping, graveyard camping, ganking, and PKing repeatedly are explicitly NOT against the TOS.
---
Welcome to the bad sad of Twitch and streaming. Any game developer with a hot title on Twitch and any multiplayer open-world element will be constantly berated by these streamers that want to be babied/catered to.
---
I like a lot of streamers but the entitled crap that comes out of them is ridiculous. If you're broadcasting your gameplay, people are gonna stream snipe you, and unfortunately that's part of streaming, sucks, but you gotta deal with it.
---
Doesn't seem like you're cool.
---
Thanks for replying, I was just curious. I can imagine 5 surprises people sometimes when you have to do it.  Thanks for taking care of this sub, I enjoy coming here.
---
Remember in PUBG where if players killed streamers without even knowing they were streamers, they would get banned because the streamer would claim they were stream sniping? I'd really hate for Classic to become like that. 
---
I feel like this could be resolved if streamers simply streamed on PvE servers and when they wanted to play on a PvP server, they could just play an undercover, unstreamed character.
---
Oh boy you really just did that?

So basically 50% of the bigger streamers played in vanilla.
---
The irony of people loving classic wow because of the community it creates and prevents people from acting like assholes because they will gain a reputation and be punished for it.
---
He basically advocates this very thing and everyone shits on him.
---
I don't think you people realize the type of stream sniper he is talking about.
---
Casting bar is too high up on the screen. Without special action bars(pet bar, auras, stealth etc) it is very close to the action bars. With special action bars it should be a bit higher, but not as high as it is in the beta. The beta has retail casting bar height.
---
Proof: [https://youtu.be/X6LxyDL0nho?t=26](https://youtu.be/X6LxyDL0nho?t=26)
---
Ziqo PvP'ing in the beta, watch the cast-bar location. Quite high up above his bars.

As you can see from retail vanilla wow videos, the casting bar location is wrong.
---
Shout out to all my fellow Mac plebs who use command+R instead
---
Raids are 40 man first off lol, and yeah you’ll likely need a guild to consistently raid past MC. More elite players will def be checking your gear/spec as some are pretty deadweight.
---
For real. That's their thought process. Ego maniacs. 
---
Everybody should know who they are and they can't comprehend that someone is just playing the game the way it's played without any outside malice intended.
---
Okay so in this super hypothetical scenario it might be possible that you get flagged idk. Is it something to worry about? Probably not. And the entire clip was just him making a suggestion lmao.
---
Yes but that Ultrabook doesn't allow me the processing power I need to run certain programs and tasks when I'm out in the field for work.
---
When I get home I could set my laptop down and sit on a PC but all I do is plug my HMDI in and sit on my couch and game.
---
No need for the PC in my situation.
---
Streamers are kids that never grew up because they basically never had real life responsabilities
---
This is why I wont be playing classic. I have good memories from vanilla and if I played classic, my experience will be ruined because it basically turned into a streamers backyard.
---
Think I can learn German in 80ish days?
---
What a glorious damage machine! But seriously, didn't you get the memo about the only viable end game palydan configuration being healing (and buffing) ?
---
SCNR. I played a def tank all though vanilla end game. High crits man! PvPing like hot knife through butter.
---
And then have that army following them everywhere for hours on end? Don't underestimate the patience of a bunch of gank happy rogues who don't need to exit stealth to track you.
---
i'm actually surprised this has been downvoted so much, i completely agree with you.
---
it's amazing to see how divided the pro-streamer community is compared to those  that don't watch streams, it is not as if we are hating on the streamers, we just want our own experience to be without that intensive cult following.
---
here's hoping they bring out some oceanic servers for my Aussie ass, as the Australian streamer base is incredibly small.
---
This. During the horde pvp tourney he lost because of a resist (I think or he missed a grenade or something) which allowed the fight to go on long enough for the warlock he was against to resac which won it for the lock.  
---
Soda - piss raving mad and acting like a child  
---
Then the next fight between two others (I think a different lock and a shaman) some level 1 horde is running around in the duel blocking the tremor totem so the non-shaman can't target it which cause the non-shaman to lose the best of 3.  
---
Soda - laughing his ass off about how funny it is and how he hopes the non-shaman player is pissed.
---
I feel like I'm going to get downvoted to hell by the echo chamber, but it needs to be said that he makes his money by streaming the game and the people sniping him are abusing the fact that they can tell where he is at via his channel. It's not right for those people to endlessly camp him. It's exploiting twitch and should have some sort of penalty. Maybe not a ban from raiding, because that seems like too much, but something to keep them from endlessly killing him. Make him unable to participate in world pvp for a little bit or something, if need be. How would you feel if your paycheck depended on people liking to watch your content?
---
Or he has to realize that being a well known streamer just has its downsides. He could not stream the game. He could play PVE server. There are options.
---
"He emoted, yup he's stream sniping! Blacklist him!"
---
&gt; What if someone just ganks anyone he sees and it then happens to this guy? 
---
Nothing happens, because the type of player he is talking about isn't someone who just ganks other players.
---
Sure. Its faster because you can press 1, 2, 3 and kill 10 mobs instead of 1, 2, 3 and kill 1-2 mobs then eat. Vanillas not difficult, the community is 90% of the game
---
That sounds like a you problem, not a them problem.
---
But what could Blizzard do to stop this? Streamers won't self regulate. And creating arbitrary rules like "no streaming on these three servers" will hurt real players. I don't like streamers, I've never watched a twitch stream in my life. (Actually I usually watch DeepMind and OpenAI streams on YouTube)
---
But I'm a casual so I don't care about the endgame stuff as much. Im pretty sure day one if your server has 100k+ wait queue because 3 streamers (by your count) are on it, that'll be an easy way of knowing which server to *not* roll?
---
I didn’t say ninja’d. I could come up with tons of reasons for “legitimately” needing the staff on any character that can wield it.
---
It's a shame people still use hate speech this day and age. I am glad i don't see much of it here,  I appreciate you doing what you do so I don't see it. Thank you.
---
Back in the day it was The Blacklist (somthing like that), to share your own with your guild. It had two tabs: Ninja and Future Prey.
---
I brought this up yesterday.  Everyone is sick of watching streamers play and not being able to play themselves.  I don't know if you all realized yet, but Classic is still over 80 days away.  That means we won't be able to play and level our characters for two and a half months.  
---
All I am is being bombarded with information about the super fun times other people are having and it's kind of making me want to just ignore reddit and all classic wow content altogether.
---
Good find, though neither of these sets are the original ones that the OPs image is a part of.
---
The mid tier guilds are actually the most hostile to meme specs in my experience. If you go Holy as your main spec, get 3 easy AQ40 clears in the first 3 weeks it opens, then a good guild will have no problem with you going ret for easy farm clears after that.  
---
It's the low-mid tier guilds that get stuck wiping on twin emps for 6 weeks and then c'thun for 8 weeks that will ban anyone not in main spec and bringing for consumables.  
---
If you really want to meme spec I'd be joining a super casual social 'planet fitness' guild, or join a high end guild that isn't interested in speed running.
---
If I wasnt tethered to my horde friend group, I would be doing this also. Paladins have some of the best class fantasy of any class, and I would totally run a Holy Ret build.
---
&gt;"I'll give you 50g in Classic if you give me 500g in Retail"
---
That seems like a horrible deal.  50g would be worth more like, I dunno 10k?
---
Retail wow had sharing and the top servers still sometimes had que times. Imagine if all streamers and their fans were on 1 server
---
&gt; But then I read about this clown bitching and moaning about getting PvPed on a PvP server
---
Except that isn't what he's bitching about. Maybe try to understand what he's actually talking about instead of complete misrepresenting what he is saying.
---
Well, the one beta server we have right now does a good job :P
---
Honestly, just shut the fuck up about the streamer hatred. Holy Jesus Christ. Outside of the (very few) that have a massive following, streamers will have a near negligible impact on you and your gaming experience.
---
Classic isn't going to be just like  Vanilla though.  
---
"Times Change"
---
Layering won’t be permanent
---
German is a pretty complicated language compared to English, and mastering it takes most people years.
---
But if you are dedicated, you can get the basics down...ask for directions, memorize terminology important to WoW, say hi, thanks, ask for help, etc.
---
Jugs
---
that would take 2 presses. HT would generate a smallish GCD. But, yeah, you could totally set up a cast sequence to do that.... I dont have a leveled druid in the beta, so I can't really make one for an example. but, in theory!
---
You're dwelling on what-if scenarios. Either way it won't be the same as what vanilla was. You'll never get it back from how you remember it either. 
---
Look at OSRS now compared to 2007. You don't see noobs just doing whatever in the sandbox game anymore. It's all about efficiency today.
---
There's alot of information about the vanilla/classic now and a lot of people with more than a decade of wow experience. You think the core experience will be the same as vanilla?
---
You’ve articulated it so well. I can’t tell you how much I hate the culture over here that you described. I miss the old days.
---
Slightly off topic but I think part of that shitty gaming culture encourages people to look up the ‘best’ build in every game and “what gun/build/talent does my favorite streamer uses?!?” My roommates won’t even come up with his own key bindings and looks up what the pros do in every game.
---
I can’t wait to roflstomp these streamers as a Fury Warrior or a Shadow Priest or maybe some weird hybrid mage build.
---
I'm German and I agree, television plays a big role. A lot of younger folks have started watching shows in English so we are getting better at it, but overall we're behind most other European nations. Merkel holding a speech at Harvard in German was a bit awkward.
---
On the latest big pserver some guy got banned for griefing a player over the course of 4 weeks right through a name change and GM intervention. He followed him from Redridge to Wetlands to Ashenvale back to Redridge.
---
He got suspended once, twice, griefed another week and got perma banned. Even the *game masters* were at their wits end because of the griefers persistence.
---
Griefer and wPvPers get crazy good hunting down their victims without 3rd party crutches.
---
Bounties, 2nd account, world chat information gathering, opposing faction can just give his location via Discord.
---
Would giving his location via discord actually considered streamsniping as you dont use twitch but a 3rd party program? Like the paladin crying about Unbreakable nuking him:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w)  (10:45)

---
And there'll be members on his own guild who will go out of their way to defend him. Then world pvp happens. Soda still sounds switched on this is how a pvp server works. Reputation and association is important in classic. Part of a guild known for stream sniping? If someone disagrees then you've got a fight on your hands.
---
That's probably fine.  Nature's swiftness doesn't trigger GCD.  I think it'd only be a problem if you tried to reform after healing touch.
---
Console pukes that converted don’t know any better?
---
imo sometimes in these discussions, hybrid classes and hybrid/off specs get rolled together.
---
A raid-friendly off spec being something like Holy/Disc Priest, but with a handful of talents for farming or PvP. Or a Holy paladin healer with 21 points in Ret. It's not the optimal raid spec, but the difference is pretty negligible.
---
imo the difference in clear times between "must have optimal raid spec" and "eh close enough" is not very large. The difference in solo farming times can be huge (or PvP viability, if that's your thing). Farming as a pure raid spec priest sucks.
---
I have a little bit less patience for dps that don't want to "carry" a healer with a couple of wayward talent points. Especially if y'all are just farming content and not doing progression raids. And especially if the dps classes aren't willing to help the healers farm for raid prep.
---
Isn't it equality if he can gank / camp someone then with that logic, I should be able to do the same with him?
---
Is that feasible? Not sure how long it would take to farm up a token
---
Get after him. But don't go on a form of social media specifically to find him so that you can harass him. That's targetting.
---
Yep it was upgraded to purple quality later in the timeline, as when we had access to better gear (between ZG and AQ from memory) the PVP gear was starting to fall off, so it was upgraded to higher quality.
---
If we had access to that kind of purple level gear (which is better than BWL) so early in the timeline, would crush anything you could get from raids and would carry us all through BWL with ease.
---
For the journey - the tank will be the best bet. They're a bit harder to find than healers. Worst case scenario - you'll respec for DPS if/when you all hit 40 mans. 
---
But in the long run - Paladin. You'll never need to re-spec.
---
I think it's pretty obvious at this point that blizz nerfed elite mob damage sometime between 1.0 launch and 1.12 but since they don't have that data any more we'll never be able to prove it.
---
Still got PTSD from the sound of a rogue stealthing near you to this day.
---
Cant wait.
---
I absolutely despise forest zones, that is a nay from me.
---
Tank if you guys plan on playing together regularly. Your friends are dps so you wont have problems killing stuff while questing, so that works out well too. Tanks are by far the hardest slot to fill, and even hard to fill with an actual (competent) tank. You should try to get one of your friends to go heals too so you can can just grab a couple of dps and are g2g.

This isn't classic anyways, it's a shell of its former self. People are always going to cry and say classic is the hardest, etc, just because things took more time in general.
---
I'm all for classic servers but they're already night and day from what it used to be. So the nochanges crowd already has to think of a new hashtag
---
Why are people so concerned with streamers. Like it's getting pathetic. Who cares what they say, you seem to hate them then don't watch them yet you seem to be aware of what they're saying.
---
Lol maybe. Im stoked to see so many people wanting to play this game. But Jeeze come on i had a 2007 Gaming Alienware laptop... and was running BFA on it (i'd lag horribly in a RBG BUT I DID IT)

I was in a guild named "those boat camping jerks" and all we did was camp boats for pvp rank. I wouldn't mind joining a streamer camping guild who's sole purpose is to camp streamers.
---
I think there will be guilds on Classic that intentionally don't care about some specs not being able to do good DPS. Such guilds will take you, especially if you're reliable and put efforts. Further, even casuals will be able to clear Naxx this time around.
---
So ye, follow your heart. It's not that arms is good anyway.
---
If you are stream sniping, you are cheating. While noobs might be annoying, it's very much a part of the game. Just play the game, why do you even give a shit? Stop fucking whining
---
I put together a DPS spreadsheet to try and compare damage output with standard rotations, and a full Ret paladin with Sulfuras and full BWL BiS gear with ToEP active had less DPS than a pre-Raid phase 1 fury warrior wearing crafted devilsaur/black dragonscale pieces.  :/
---
What? How are they not going to be affected when they apply to a guild they want to join to push progress and they get rejected because they're flagged as "stream sniper", only because they once camped an opposite faction player who happened to be a streamer?
---
I don't think they have to add new raids. That's just a mindset we're all used to because Blizzard has put so much emphasis on them each expansion.
---
But in any case, if they did add a new raid it doesn't necessarily have to be above Naxx. It could be in between AQ and Naxx for example. The content is what matters, not the rewards, keep that in mind.
---
A simple example is they could add the card game Mark Kern talked about and give inns their original purpose. Is it a raid? No. But it would help with the RPG parts of the game much more than a raid would, and I'm not even someone who likes card games!
---
I'm hoping they flesh out the world rather than adding to it, personally. But I'm not opposed to that either
---
I am pretty sure every better guild on each server will have at least 1 streamer who will stream their raids, pvp etc
---
classic vanilla-style item, it was awesome
---
&gt;Isn't PvP on a PvP server.
---
It is. It's by definition still PvP, whether or not the guy you attack is attacking you back. 
---
&gt; Or just black list people who choose to go out of their way to make your experience miserable. 
---
Probably won't happen, because it's one of the things which people roll on PvP servers to do. They did it in Vanilla, it'll happen again.
---
The whole “well if they don’t like it then they shouldn’t create the problem by streaming /playing on pvp servers” argument is valid, but only barely since a lot of them get their paychecks from streaming. They could arguably move to youtube, but that has its own issues.  
---
Besides, a better argument would be: Unless they are stealthed or hiding in an obscure location, how easy would it be to even determine if someone is stream sniping anyways? It’s not like Hearthstone where you can tell by your opponent playing around certain cards they don’t know you have (on top of trying to queue into you) since you’ll be too busy fighting to pay a ton of attention to the screen. On top of that, they may not even use the same name as their twitch name for their character, making having evidence be even harder to prove in most cases.  
---
So you then get people accused of streamsniping on the word of the streamer alone, meaning people could wind up ostracized and harassed for simply wandering around, encountering, and beating a streamer.
---
tyrion
---
You're approaching this from a poor angle. Classes in Vanilla are not played solely by spec, you have every option on the talent tree to choose from. You can play 15/16/20 if you really want to. 
---
If your question is paladin vs warrior, that's more apt. Warrior will have more options for **dealing damage** in PvP and PvE while Paladin offers much more **utility** and the ability to **heal**. 
---
Again, how you place your talents is NOT "Ret" vs "Holy" vs "Prot" vs "Arms", you can do whatever you want.
---
I'm personally rolling a paladin, and I'm going to spec such that I can heal raids while tanking 5-man dungeons so that I have a lot of group value. 
---
If you want to roll into a raid full ret spec then by all means, but you're really limiting yourself and your group by doing so. Why not do something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sExuogoxZEb0t) so you can heal your raid and provide imp. BoM while still being fully capable at dealing damage outside of raids?
---
Also, fulls arms is pretty bad for damage and is mostly for PvP.
---
You said "a guy" there will be obvious outliers of people....

---
I.... dont know. 
---
I enjoy both as they are a hotter comodity than DPS characters or niche classes like Warlocks.
---
I like tanking because you sort of lead the pack in many ways and are central to any raid or 5 man. I also really enjoy my character being in the thick of the action like a badass.
---
I like healing because it's such an important role and even though healers get shit on if they do poorly, they are the most wanted role and often get a lot of attention for that.
---
I enjoy the aesthetics of both, huge fan of the paladin horses, but not sure which is gonna be better overall
---
Both are a chore to level from what I remember which is why my alt will be a mage.
---
well its not exactly the same as it was in 2004, its based on the 8.0 version so the requirements are indeed higher that in 04
---
What? The game is still happening... Every streamer who refuses delay says that they dont delay because then its hard/impossible to interact with chat. You cant carry on a conversation with a 15 second lag in communication.
---
I don't recall this either.
---
You could be a mage blacksmith of you *really* wanted to.
---
except you got the time and gold to prepare propper. a feral can top the dps. pummler + flask. but if someone goes for that, he needs a huge amount of time only preparing for the next raid.
---
It's similar item level to tier 1. I don't think the blue set is better than tier 2
---
its not super hypothetical. its being used all the time on pservers when it comes down to e-peening at world bosses.
---
People spamming the location of an enemy factions guild in the 5hour fight for Azuregos isnt really different from targeting your victim.
---
Spamming world chat to warn people of BRM campers is the opposite of it. 
---
Various channels are used always for different PvP purposes.
---
Classic is running on the retail client, the specs required are similar to retails.

Whew I saw "queue" and almost went berserk, nochanges man

Its happened already. Hunter kills asmon, gets mad and says hes a stream sniper. Hunter gets banned on twitch. So you think theyll email people st twitch but not add them to a blscklist? Unlikely.

No. Watching someones stream to see where they are when they're stealth isn't pvp on a pvp server. It's cheating.
---
Dire Maul mace?
---
This, OP. That and the improved stealth speed/reduced stealth CD make stealth much smoother and easier to use. And as a rogue you'll be in stealth a lot.
---
I think you overestimate the amount of streamsnipers and the amount of people that would be put on such a list. Either way the most egregious people would simply be remembered, just like they were back in Vanilla, and if nothing else a simple addon could just be made.
---
Higher level meat? 
---
Ah, this might be where I’m going wrong. I thought meat was just meat...

So if I kill a level 6 boar for example is that only “level 6 meat”...

One thing people forgot to mention is that Enhancement Shaman can actually be viable in a raid environment, that is if you have the Nightfall 2 handers with you.  
---
It has a proc that increases the magic damage dealt on the target by 15%, which is liked (but not essential) to buff the raid dps.  
---
Be aware though that you will still and **always** be considered as a support class. You will be there to keep the windfury totem (which is already possible as a healer) up for your group and get that Nightfall proc, and also there's only going to be 1 spot for Enhancement per raid.
---
haha I actually didn't see that until now either thank you.
---
the implementation of LFG Tool and the advent of so many popular 3rd party social sites/apps (Reddit, Discord, YouTube, Twitch). 
---
are you thinking about wotlk? 
---
like it wasnt like that back in vanilla/TBC, first time i encountered LFG or Gearscore was in wotlk
---
OFC people asked looked at your gear in tbc before inviting you to BT raid, but thats expected you cant expect you join up with full green just because you did the attunment
---
There are four themes.
---
Those who think that Classic is run on the old 1.12 engine.
---
Those who have not read the Blizzard minimum specs.
---
Those who have read the specs but hope that, despite them, their machine will work.
---
Those who ask without searching or doing any research.
---
&gt; It doesn’t. It means you take 1 more mage and 1 less warrior lol. 
---
So after the fury tank dies, mage tank ftw? :D
---
Not happening.
---
No?
---
Just downvote.  That's how reddit works.  This is like streamers asking stream snipers to get banned.  It's dumb.
---
Visual design is the result of wanting your game to run on as many systems as possible with a low barrier to entry.
---
They are all 40 man, I guess UBRS isnt but thats not a raid
---
Ok, so you're basically out of arguments and are now telling me that I should pay close attention to which servers these guys pick so I don't happen to choose the same one?
---
I don't see how anybody could avoid streamer servers without being a follower of said streamers themselves (unless someone takes the job to compile a list and make it public knowledge or something).
---
...So you're basically saying that if you are a player who just wants to play the game and you don't do a full research on these guys, you might get screwed by them in the future because they've got complete control over the realm and there is nothing nobody can do about it.
---
It makes sense.  Otherwise many names will be claimed by people that don't even play the game.
---
Then don't stream, or stream using a delay.
---
Or you can get corpsecamped for being a doofus and broadcasting your location in a game with PVP in it.
---
This makes a lot more sense...
---
Well I wish I hadn’t spent 3 hours farming low level boars just to stock up on meat now!
---
Well, the more you know :)
---
Fair enough, but we can sure hope it will be a better experience than most games.
---
There are different tiers, not just the level of the mob that drops it.
---
Think of it like food for your character.  Some heals more at higher levels.
---
For meat it also can generally be cooked and cooking generally raises meat's level as well.
---
I don't watch stream(ers). No offense to those who watch them, but I just don't find watching someone play the same game as me for hours on end just to catch a handful of notable moments time well spent.
---
I am looking forward to some highlight videos of this guy whining like a baby back bitch. I've seen some of them in the past and the guy just has this absolutely pathetic whine he does, and I'm sure when he's ganked 24/7 it's going to get a lot of usage.
---
Best of luck to him and his blacklist idea. I'm sure it's going to work /s
---
He was a classic player before everyone jumped on the bandwagon, he was from the future
---
I'm going resto shaman to raid and will from time to time go elemental for some burst pvp fun.
---
&gt;Or i could call the police because there is someone breaking the law? What a dumb analogy
---
And the streamer can report you to twitch, I'm sorry you didn't understand it.
---
&gt;What part of him streaming is his own choice did you not get?
---
The good news is you're completely allowed to use any streamers stream to hunt them down, but you'll have to face the social consequences of not being able to play with the streamer or their friends.
---
Beutiful my friend u sad it all
---
 Resto shammy master class
---
Stream sniping is for pussies and cheating imo. If the Pvp happens organically, I don't have a problem with it.
---
It should totally get you blacklisted. Like you said, it's a pvp server. Players make the rules. The blacklist only applies to whoever wants to follow it. So what if he puts you on a black list? Let him. Some people will care sure. Some people also wont and some people will even be happy to let you into their guild and kill soda together.
---
Honestly let's blacklist streamers lol. They're all toxic pricks except a few of em.
---
Other unpopular opinion, I would not mind at all if they added in more holidays that weren't in classic.  I did all the holiday achievements in WotLK to get the violet proto drake, but I still had fun killing the horseman in SM:GY and all of that.  
---
Also, adding mounts.  The mounts in Vanilla are boring.
---
Option 3: Add a delay, it is a standard feature on all streaming platforms that I know of.
---
These people are complaining about a self imposed barrier. They are literal scrubs.
---
Yeah I guess leveling is a bit harder. Once you hit max the game gets much easier
---
Vanilla is all about social policing and I don't see a problem with it. People who care about streamers tend to be losers so I really dont mind if people want to black list some of the rejects
---
Hi, /u/Vlaed
---
Will you be returning home to menethil harbor in late August?
---
Lmao very true, and if anything when suggested a fix for the problem by just not playing on a pvp server? “Fuck that”. If you don’t like the consequences that comes with streaming then just don’t stream. But he won’t do that because he makes too much money
---
I bet you all the cheese in my pocket. Against all the cheese in your pocket. That MC won't be cleared in the first week.
---
We;re taklking about sodapoppin and his statements. Not Asmongold.
---
&gt;No. Watching someones stream to see where they are when they're stealth isn't pvp on a pvp server. It's cheating.
---
How are you going to prove they're cheating and just wasn't lucky, if they do it once? - Like me finding some random ass rogue with Flare while leveling?
---
&gt; Watching someones stream to see where a flag carrier is isn't pvp on a pvp server. It's cheating.
---
How are you going to prove this isn't just being scouted with abilities, which can cover the entire BG?
---
How are you going to prove that they just knew you were there, because it's the typical spot for flag carriers to stand?
---
&gt; He's not talking about "pvp on a pvp server". He's talking about toxic stream snipers. 
---
Problem is you can't prove shit in a huge majority of the cases and guess who's the judge of that? People willing to donate thousands of dollars to streamers, and the streamer getting ganked, now imagine someone like Asmongold or Soda getting salty. There's obviously a huge interest of conflict.
---
Caen Apathy.
---
 don't ask what will happen when Vanilla content runs out.
---
Side note, would Vael actually be a good fight for boomkin/ele shaman? Since their biggest weakness is going oom so fast
---
I would use thunderfury as a mage if a mage could wield it just because it’s one of the only legendaries in vanilla lol
---
Any real reason why I should stop taking his information on good faith, or do you just not like him?
---
There is a difference between griefing/harassing and corpse camping that I don't think you quite understand. The Tauren dude who was trolling the duel tourney is a classic example of griefing/harassment. Being annoying/obstructive just for the sake of harassing others. Corpse camping on the other hand is intended and fair. PvP is fair. Killing others in PvP (even if repeatable) is not harassment. 
---
I'm glad if what you said about that Tauren asshole is true. I'm glad blizzard enforced their rule against griefing/harassment and made an example of a little shithead like that who was just after attention. Those people don't deserve to play this game.
---
If only the game is delayed, then anything that they encounter in-game they can’t mention instantly, as the viewers won’t see it until after the delayed gameplay catches up.
---
Also, 15 seconds is very far from being enough, it won’t stop any ganks. He’d probably need at least 3-5 minutes of delay if he wants to be gone by the time the gankers get to his position, and they’d still be able to intercept him while he’s traveling (or wait for him at the place of his next quest)
---
Soda can blacklist whoever he wants
---
it will have little effect though
---
Lol yes. I ran out of arguments. You win. You’re right. Soda will really get hundreds of streamers to ban together, both horde and alliance, and will follow a blacklist of people. And if you steal their node they will ban you from do anything in game because they have complete control over the realm.
---
Do you mean when you max out your level in vanilla?
---
Wrong, I can still /who your zone at least :)
---
Hilarious self-own.
---
Remind me! 80 days
---
He never asked blizzard to fix it. He said it could be a community based thing on the server, for people that go extremely out of their way just to annoy. 
---
Which would be like asking your friends from the opposite faction to stop inviting or doing anything with those people.
---
Organic world PvP=Great
---
Stream sniping= Shit players who are borderline cheating.
---
Pretty simple.
---
Take pirates of the pancreas for example
---
Yikes! Interesting. I think I kind of like that tbh (I'm a healer and that sounds fun!)
---
Hi, /u/Chili1179
---
A gathering profession collects materials, the crafting profession uses said materials to make useful items
---
This dude uses hypothetical/anecdotal shit for his arguments man just give up tbh lol
---
There's a lot of misinformation in that video from private server data so have many grains of salt ready
---
I get it but quest saying normies you fucking neckbeard
---
&gt; everyone who ganks them in world pvp they claim is sniping both soda and asmon.
---
This is a super disingenuous argument because it's not happening.
---
Destiny
---
Sure blacklist people then. I just don't think it's going to work, because one of the fundamentals of a PvP server, is camping/ganking lowbies, huge amounts of people do it. And we seemingly live with it. I don't think it's going to work outside of that streamer's community.
---
I watch streamers and have a few that I like, but I don’t want to interact with them in game and deal with the headache they come with.
---
lol he wants streamer only servers. what a fucking crybaby.
---
With that mentality you still have the same race. Just you are cheering for and helping streamers instead of guild leaders. Nothing changed but your opinion of streamers vs guild leaders.
---
Was assuming pvp/world stuff.  If you're a horde tauren/undead or a shaman sure mom is better for fury.  But honestly with AP normalization MoM is a bit over rated.  Or Dark Edge of Insanity is under rated.
---
Well, sadly the Suits do notice, but also notice that Zynga, Tencent, and Supercell makes tens of billions, vs hundreds of millions. 
---
There is a viable market for $60 games with no MTX for those of us who hate them. But the grand majority of -people- not "traditional" gamers, love blowing money on time unlocks and a faster farm up grades.
---
This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. I'm interested in hearing his reasoning on how he's going to distinguish between a stream sniper and someone who's just an asshole that likes to gank people.
---
The problem with this is who exactly determines who is stream sniping? How many times have you watched a stream and when the streamer gets killed he starts blaming hacks or sniping. Chat is a mindless hivemind of scum and villainy that then enables and encourages the streamer. Nah dude, you got killed because the other player was better or just had the drop on you.
---
Your arrows show that all the weapons are superior to Mcp.
---
Haha yep! Eventually I believe they even won't eat it. You get an error message saying that the food level is too low for your pet. Farm beasts at your level for meat. You get a little xp for yourself while you feed your pal.
---
Realistically you need 25 people doing their job, the rest can auto and you’ll probably clear. Healing is interesting, a lot more prehealing as youre not saving people from mechanics
---
That's funny wotlk is my favorite version of elemental (Finally got lavaburst and thunderstorm, and elemental overload was their mastery)
---
You’re still here? Could of swore I heard your mom yelling from upstairs to let you know your pizza rolls were ready.
---
Ok, ok... that makes sense!
---
Shit, I need to find me a guy who does cooking haha!
---
Wait, this isn't a thread about you recovering an account or asking what class, spec or profession you should level?
---
Huh.
---
I only saw this a couple of times before so hopefully people know more about it now, it was funny
---
Yeah, one of my pet peeves is when people focus on the meta and ignore the individual players in front of them. Like complaining that your guild allows a cat druid, but not a word about the mage at the bottom of the dps meter who keeps standing in the fire. It seems shitty to bitch about the cat druid when there are 5 players below him in the meters.
---
This is a good way to look at it, comparing it with our own characters and the higher level food. I like that.
---
But what if we added in the lich king to classic? Is it still classic? 
---
If you have to “add” anything to classic, it isn’t classic.
---
I will legit camp this snowflake all day/everyday.
---
Streamers deserve it.
---
How are you going to prove? When it's the same person doing it over and over and over again, that's how you prove it. He's talking about toxic stream snipers. Not someone who kills him one time.
---
&gt;Problem is you can't prove shit
---
Absolutely false.
---
Mort
---
Not defending Soda, but if you watch his stream just to go find where he is and kill him you are scum and should be blacklisted. Stream sniping is childish beyond belief.
---
Ok so gathering professions are basically professions that allow you to pick herbs, skin leather, mine ore, even fish for cooking although fishing and cooking aren't really main professions but still very useful! Primary professions are ones like alchemy, leatherworking, and blacksmithing that utilize the items you gather with mining, skinning and herbalism. Some classes have professions that suit their class better than others. Being a caster and having tailor isn't a bad choice, but other professions may provide other benefits.
---
Can't you set a stream delay?
---
Having a level of ease that lets rets and arcane, and balance be viable, does not automatically mean retail level of ease.
---
Work is not supposed to be fun 😘
---
WTS 89 Boar Meat...
---
Tis' but common sense to analyse fine art, sir.
---
This guy will never cease to be hilarious.
---
There needs to be a subreddit with just memes using this video.
---
Wish I had a rogue gank squad to protect me when I go into a warzone like STV or Stonetalon Mountains. I'm just a BIT jealous.
---
except 99% of those were actual streamsnipers. and no, your 'but i just happened to be there' excuse doesn't fool anyone, including the devs
---
I would say something like original Star Wars galaxies could make a return, Ive always thought that may be on the cards.
---
I mean, so you dont play with that streamer or their guild. Blacklisted isnt some official blizzard designation. Just a  guild putting you on their shit list. So what?
---
Don't stream 4Head. Yeah i can see how its easy for you to say because you're not in the position they are in, its their job. Steam with a delay and stop all chat interaction which is a big negative for personality streamers.  I gurantee if you where a big streamer you'd bitch about the same shit. I'm talking about stream snipers that are making it blatantly obvious they are sniping.  Anymore mind blowing arguments beside JUST DONT STREAM BTW 4Head???
---
I know, earlier in the text (I didn't quote this part) it says from worst to best but uses the same arrows, so I was going by that. But apparently it changes during the second section (the part I quoted).
---
Server death = EASY rank 14. Quit away.
---
I'm not saying the hunting down people is hypothetical, im saying that specifically hunting down streamers on this specific "no streamsniping" server with means of not streamsniping and then getting blacklisted because they think you are streamsniping is VERY hypothetical
---
What a stupid idea lmao. 
---
Why would I not work with someone on my faction because they camped some streamer on the opposite faction. 
---
If they're on my faction I guess we should blacklist them because they get handouts from fans.
---
He's just an entitled tool.
---
So loyalty isn’t happiness?
---
They different things?
---
congratulations youre the first one with working brain cells in this thread
---
Eventually these MTX games will get legislated away.  It’ll be the best thing for gamers in years.
---
Well, PvE servers are literally just the game with an aspect of the game removed.  Its literally easy mode and thats fine for dads and moms and stuff.
---
Docken
---
I played lock from vanilla into arena in TBC up to 2k rating.
---
I only pvp'd since I hit 60 on vanilla while Naxx had released and I found it much more engaging that dungeon DPS.
---
While I wasn't initially drawn to affliction dot builds I ended up using it almost exclusively over your destro cast builds in favor of Soul link/siphon Life  (I believe it was still a thing before TBC)
---
It wasn't boring at all for me. You still have the squishyness factor of a clothie but your health pool and innate survivability from all your health drains made fights super engaging. you don't want to sit in melee but then again you don't need to be afraid to take a single melee hit.
---
I found dot damage builds for PVP to be extremely mobile and and dynamic feel while instead of exclusively creating space for big casts. Instead it felt like an intricate dance leveraging a TON of abilities  (oof the keybindings required lol) where you continuously straddle the line of instant death or masterful toying of your foe.
---
Regardless I loved it and would highly recommend it, very unique and rewarding
---
You literally described what I was posting about..
---
This plus professions are a lot more impactful in vanilla. They're a good source of making and saving money if you make/farm the high in demand items. Also if OP is planning levelling with her bf probably don't have conflicting gathering professions as sharing nodes isn't that fun
---
Its a non issue in that case. I do think you will not find many people happy to group with you and your loot policy.  But, sure man. Go for it
---
Yes it does. WTF are talking about? Those specs are legit garbage in vanilla.
---
Go play retail
---
&gt; You're literally showing the exact problem of this,
---
No, I'm not showing any problem. If a single player is ALWAYS where you are when you stream, knows exactly where you are when you're stealth-ed, knows exactly where the flag is when you are playing bgs, then he is obviously a stream sniper. 
---
&gt;In a huge majority of cases, you absolutely can't prove shit.
---
With the type of player he is talking about, it's incredibly obvious. But they do it all the time and make no effort to hide it.
---
Usually boomkins go melee to trigger Omen of Clarity procs, so their next spell cast is free.
---
Don't you mean "They think they can, but they can't."? Sorry, I only speak WoW terms.
---
People did then and they will now. Don’t know if you heard but not everyone is a hardcore min-maxer.
---
You’d get wrecked most likely
---
The completely obvious distinction here is that stream sniping is for pussies.
---
&gt;And the streamer can report you to twitch
---
How does that work if the sniper doesnt have a twitch account? lol. Trying to dig yourself outa that one eh
---
&gt;The good news is you're completely allowed to use any streamers stream to hunt them down, but you'll have to face the social consequences of not being able to play with the streamer or their friends.
---
And then they'll have to deal with the "blacklist guild" and friends. Actually this sounds like its going to be fun
---
Ya'll complaining like some hoes
---
If you don't want to play with streamers, JUST don't play on their server
---
People are a bit too obsessed with streamers...
---
it all started like this and then we got bfa
---
It really isn't clear. And many streamers are quick to say people are stream sniping even if they only die once or twice to a guy.
---
If I am leveling in Stanglethorn, and the streamer is doing the same thing, we are going to run into each other a lot. And then if we happen to run into each other later in Tanaris he will just say I am a big stream sniper and try get me black listed before ever hitting level 60.
---
I don't think they will ever get the power to black list people, too many people on the server, but it is fucked up that they want to do this.
---
Keep their happiness in the green and they’ll eventually get higher loyalty. 
---
Happiness: 3 levels (red/yellow/green), damage output changes depending on this. 
---
Loyalty: 6 levels (1-6), need for food changes depending on this (aka the rate at which happiness goes down). 
---
Freshly tamed pets are lvl 1 loyalty and need food extremely often. Lvl 6 loyalty pets very rarely need to be fed outside of after dying.
---
Except if you get caught doing this while playing on FACEIT or ESEA (the 2 main competitive clients), you literally get banned  forX amount of days for stream sniping.
---
I understand the opinion that streamers shouldn't roll on PvP servers if they don't want to get ganked, but it still doesn't change the fact that you're an asshole if you load up their streams *specifically* to see where they are and target them only because they're streaming.
---
If the PvP/camping happens naturally, so be it, but being able to initiate the PvP just because you were able to get their location from a livestream is sort of bullshit.
---
There's definitely a gray area with it, though, so I honestly can understand the arguments from both sides.
---
Wows an open game. If he wants to make a blacklist let him. Why is it okay to stream snipe him but not okay for him to make a blacklist against them?
---
This is dumb and I've lost IQ from reading this post, especially this, "... one of the few things we get out of your perks is the ability to hunt you." So you've simultaneously demonstrated that some streamers have privilege and some viewers also have privilege and that both people are entitled as fuck. One side for thinking they're special snowflakes that deserve to be preserved and left to their own devices, the other for thinking they are allowed to "ghetto hack" and stream snipe/camp people for hours. 
---
Both sides have to realize that the amount of people who give a shit about all of this compared to the normal players just playing the game and having fun is minuscule. His ideas about all of this are dumb as fuck and nobody would adhere to them, and the people who intentionally grief streamers are also in the same category of "loser" as this guy is for suggesting this. Here's an idea: play the game, have fun, be the best you can be, and if you happen upon a streamer of the opposite faction either beat them down or go about your own business.
---
What some people say. Streamsniping is a autistic and shitty thing to do. But it’s an allowed autistic shitty thing to do. Fortunately your rep on that server is gonna be an autistic streamsniper and you’d be a huge liability for raids and probably not get much traction outside of your autistic stream sniping guild 🤷‍♂️
---
I personally wouldn’t mind if streamsniping was considered a bad offense. I wouldn’t want ingame punishments. But the only people who support sniping are snipers themselves are straight assholes. 
---
Because I guarantee if they were to be camped by 10 rogues for weeks on end you’d be making some
---
Bitch ass post about it. Or stop playing entirely. 
---
The clout chase for stream sniping should be punished. Which I don’t have an answer for. Other than just ninja loot them or kick them from raids whenever someone from
---
“This guild” joins a raid or group 🤷‍♂️. 
---
This shouldn’t be a supported behavior. But it should be an allowed behavior it’s up to the community to do that bit.
---
"I don't want the perks of streaming, or the downside."  
---
That's... called \*not streaming.\* Don't stream and you can't get stream-sniped. Is it not this simple?
---
Totally.  It was just one example.  I’m more curious if there’s current AddOns that can track stuff like this
---
You're right in terms of min/maxing but you're wrong about unviable specs. The two biggest ones are Boomkin and Ele Shaman. If I was told I had a Boomkin and an Elemental Shaman or a Ret + Enh Shaman, I'd go the latter every time. Best of a terrible situation.
---
Feral DPS druids also aren't that great, especially if your Horde. You can sort of make it work on Alliance.
---
1. No, you just choose a server.   
---
If you have a problem with him on your server, check which one he is on and don't go there.
---
2. In the beginning of WoW they got suspended for days or hours IF they kept people from playing or abused game mechanics.
---
3. You can already see that stuff is worth more, things take longer, bag places are rare. Streamers will have benefits. Some might not abuse it, to preserve the vanilla feeling (soda mentioned something like that). There is only a specific demand (low amount of bag places).  
---
If known farming areas are overfarmed, people search for other areas or wait.
---
Or the human racial ability 'perception'
---
Or Catseye elixir
---
Or Bloodvine Lens
---
Or Catseye Ultra Goggles
---
I get the point that you're trying to make but there are any number of innocent answers to your example, especially on a PvP server.
---
If someone gets salty because another player popped them out of stealth and stopped them farming the 5 plagued bear buttocks that they need for their current quest then the default answer isn't guaranteed to be 'OMG sniper lul'.
---
Fair, but to see someone react to a kill in world would be sweet.
---
Who's complaining? He says hes going to blacklist them. Act like am asshole. Get blacklisted. Wows an open game. If people dont want to play with you cause you stream snipe that's fair too.
---
Please don't act as if I'm defending their choices. I absolutely disagree with the choices. Pretentious is just a really crappy word for this. Being pretentious has nothing to do with this, it's just the short-sightedness of investors and the crappy way of how stuff tends to get funded by people who have no clue about the shit they're throwing money at aside from what the statistics say, regardless of whether the statistics portray an accurate image.
---
At best the only ones being pretentious are the employees attempting to justify the decisions from higher ups (as is their job), but those higher ups had not a single pretentious idea in their mind.
---
Ok, so I feel I may have missed that part of the UI then. 
---
Are the happiness and loyalty levels shown in game?
---
Didnt blizzard disallow players from rolling new characters on "full" servers? I played the tail end of vanilla (got to do ZG, MC). IIRC, servers were listed as "full" when you pull up the realmlist.
---
10 followers, last game league of legends. Why should this person get a streamer privilege invite? Mate, I have 10 followers.
---
Only feed him again after the eating buff expires
---
Then he can deal with his choices and fame? Iunno. This seems like a pretty easy thing to ignore. Stream sniping is only against Twitch TOS, and soda wants to play on a pvp server. If he doesn't want to adjust how he streams, he can deal with those consequences. Obviously nothing will make him of his audience happy
---
&gt; You do realise that's not actually an insult right?
---
Saying you lack the ability to attract, form meaningful relationships, or even remotely trusting relationships with women is an insult.  
---
&gt; You can't think of a counter to my argument about streamers over acting badly so you pretend that you have sex with women and say that I don't.
---
Oh, streamers do tend to overact.  But this didn't appear to be an example.  If I'd gotten an epic off a random cheetah, I'd be pretty excited too.  I'm assuming you're just butt hurt because you didn't get beta access and you're upset about "streamer privilege".  That fact that would make you made lends me to think you're a certain kind of person.
---
&gt; (Note that I'm only assuming that you're pretending that you have sex because I haven't heard anyone older than about 16 talk like that)
---
I mean, most people tend to not get butthurt about 15 year old videogames or people enjoying them.
---
&gt; I guess you win.
---
I "won" the moment you first posted whining because somebody was enjoying a game that you couldn't.
---
They won't realize shit and will keep trying massive pulls until their gear is broken.
---
DW pvp is shit but yes of course thunderfury is good.
---
Looks a little cold in there.
---
&gt; I can tell the exact difference between the two. Layering isn't wanted or needed.
---
I'm going to stop you right there. It is needed if you want Classic to have a good launch. Period. Otherwise you're going to have people being unable to ***play the game*** because they can't get in. 
---
Or you're going to have hundreds of people trying to do that one quest that has a really poor drop rate and you won't actually be able to progress. 
---
While you might like that kind of thing, the majority of players will be turned off and likely not continue playing. I can already hear you saying, "Good! Fuck em." because you're closed minded and uninformed. You want as many people to want to play the game as possible so that the game will succeed. And overall you won't be sacrificing much of anything for "mah immersion." 
---
&gt; Vanilla changed the face of MMOs and is the biggest selling game of all time. Why do they need to change it to what they think we want?
---
Because of player feedback. Because they look at the data, make appropriate changes, and see if that change improved things - IE more people play / buy the game. Which is the general trend so clearly they were making proper changes that people reacted positively too. 
---
&gt; What we want is already there. Blizzard has shown, with literally every decision they've made for the last 3 years, that they are out of touch with the player's wants.
---
Out of touch with what ***you*** want, maybe. Out of touch with the majority of their player base? No. 
---
&gt; "We're right, you're wrong. Why do you think you know what you want? Sit down and shut the fuck up."
---
To some degree, yea. Keep in mind you and people that think like you are a portion of the players that play this game. On top of that you're a ***minority***. It makes no business sense to cater to a minority of your player base because you'll lose money. 
---
Then consider the data that ***YOU DONT HAVE ACCESS TO*** that Blizzard does. They probably roll their eyes countless times reading threads like this. Before they redid the world in Cata, they had ***DATA*** that said that a ***majority*** of new players to the game quit at level 10. 
---
Do you know why? Because the starting zones are ***garbage***. The quest rewards are bad. The grouping of those quests are often schizophrenic, and some of those quests were designed with a populated zone in mind. Meaning that some quests are harder than they should be because it is designed with the idea that other people will be "around you" too. However, a couple of months in to Vanilla and TBC, most starter zones are more or less ***ghost towns***. Most of the player base has already reached max level and will likely never go back to those starter zones. Making an alt is often too tedious and time consuming. 
---
And to go on a tangent here for a second, this is ***exactly*** what will happen with Classic. The release day and the first couple of months will be a lot of fun for people playing the game. Anyone that comes in 5-6 months after launch thinking they're going to have a really immersive and populated world while leveling is going to be disappointed. 
---
&gt; BfA and Legion and WoD have convenienced the game to death and now they're doing it to Classic and people are not only bending over for it, they're praising them for it.
---
They haven't done anything of the sort. 
---
&gt; I'm tired of playing a lobby game where you queue to have a brief flurry of activity with strangers and no community, that's why WoW is dying.
---
LOL. People have been saying 'WoW is dying' since fucking TBC. 
---
I'm getting a sense that it's all just pure emotion and rage coming from you rather than any understanding of how the game works or worked back then.
---
It’s been happening in the Beta and it’s just like killing anyone in the world...
---
The streamers don’t react, they know it’s what stream snipers like yourself are wanting.
---
Has there been any testing done on where to grind low level mobs?
---
I mean, so many people talk about the dreaming whelps and the crimson whelps, but I feel like it would be a lot more useful to the average player to talk about "okay, you are in goldshire. Should you grind boars, wolves, or defias cutthroats? and similarly, around level 18. The times when you REALLY need vendortrash money, so you can afford to start mailing around mageroyal instead of vendoring it, ranking up your professions, and buying nice bags. 
---
I really wish that sort of data was around, but I feel that I cannot get it myself, because  private servers are likely to be wrong, and databases like wowhead and classicdb don't seem to record every kill of the mob, only those where the mob actually dropped something (Which means the beast data is not useful, whereas humanoids and anyone else who carries money is bang on). 
---
I feel like I need a hero with beta access. Because I somehow can't imagine I am going to actually get to grind crimson whelps on a fresh server uninterrupted, and I certainly don't want to wait for level 30 to start getting my finances in order. Secondary professions add up quite a bit, from my private server testing.
---
Play PvE?
---
&gt;  I'm talking about stream snipers that are making it blatantly obvious they are sniping.
---
So what? If they aren't doing anything against _WoW_ (not twitch) ToS, Blizzard shouldn't intervene.
---
I hope to god they stick to their mantra of "If there's an in-game solution, we will not intervene" rather than cater to frankly preposterous needs of people who put themselves at a disadvantage.
---
PS; You should really try to remain civil.
---
One of the funnier memes on this sub, I laughed my ass off. 
---
+1
---
You're trying to have you cake and eat it too.
---
You want to stream snipe him and suffer no consequences. It's a social group. If a group of people decide not to play with you because you stream snipe they can choose to do so.
---
That’s very false
---
&gt;There will be guilds on both sides at the forefront of progression that actively encourage streamsniping.
---
That actually sounds like the best case scenario for Soda. A bunch of douchey snipers will be stuck in the same guild together so it will be very easy to identify them.
---
I'm not gonna argue that it's optimal but, as long as you stack enough gear lol. Even memes can leave you dusted lol.
---
Sheep need a shepherd, simple as that. It's sad and very common now compared to when this game was first released, but it happened a tad with you tubers, just not to this extent. Don't worry, there are sites and hopefully addons going up for people to put bounties on players, streamers are players, too, even though some pretend to be a God instead.
---
Then STV will trigger you even more with all the stealthed panthers.
---
Thinking a rogue needs weapons or armor to kill people, hah.
---
I'd give you gold if I had one, well said
---
This is a great idea. My initial feeling was wanting to gank him more. I've never even stream sniped but I want to now.
---
Killing bosses and clearing raids IS fun.
---
And it IS harder the more anchors you drag through the raid.
---
Why do people hate streamers so much? Is it a jealousy thing or what?
---
[This is the reason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSEw_AVfJBY) Blizzard are doing it.
---
They start pulling in subs two weeks early with only minimal strain on servers.
---
It also might help give them some idea of real launch numbers since chances are if your creating a character two weeks out your going to want to play on launch.
---
It’s funny because you called him out for it, and his only back up was personally attacking you.
---
That’s how you know you won 😁
---
Some folks back in the day only focused on dungeons or raids. The raid would pour mats into a guild bank instead so that one person was making pots. I know I had Max alchemy and herbalism back in the day but poured all of my other mats and items to several bankalts and just crafted stuff when I needed it. Seems kind of silly now that I think about I but they provided all pots and gear when needed plus we did very well so I didnt care.
---
&gt;No, I'm not showing any problem. If a single player is ALWAYS where you are when you stream, knows exactly where you are when you're stealth-ed, knows exactly where the flag is when you are playing bgs, then he is obviously a stream sniper.
---
The only thing I agree on here, is the Stealth one. You can't hide anywhere in BGs with popular flag carrier spots being obvious. With Eagle Eye and other vision abilities, which can cover the entire BG.
---
Him knowing where you are, could be him guessing where you are, or having a secondary account for scouting, chatting with the opposite faction or something else. It was done in Vanilla as well. Even [Angwe](http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/) did it in Vanilla and used the secondary account to pick up what they were saying about him.
---
Rank 10 set is iLvl 66-71 tier 1 is 66.
---
Rank 13 set is 71-74 and tier 2 is 76
---
considering asmon got someone banned from twitch for stream sniping when he wasnt it definitely is happening
---
It's not toxic to be upset that some random people are dictating how I play the game because they're famous on twitch
---
Funny how both sides argue at the other "Stop telling us how we have to play". I'm not going out of my way to accommodate someone's choice to be 70% as effective. Who knows, maybe more people will end up happier having heard the harsh wisdom "if you want to do X, you're better off playing Y".
---
Sure would've helped me out if people didn't accommodate my plan to level as a destro lock. I was level 40 before I conceded that people were fudging the disparity, just to be non-toxic.
---
yo i heard home depot is having a sale on ropes and stools....u should go buy a set.
---
Right,  but the OG shaman didnt have the proper scaling to be flexible.  Thats why it was fixed alot in tbc and later wotlk.  Shamans are fun,  but in vanilla you have to realize the limitations of that class.
---
Menethil is the city in Wetlands and it's a travel bottleneck for traveling between continents as alliance. If you want to avoid menetil your only options are mage portal or booty bay. It's also a very good leveling zone for mid level alliance.
---
Basically lots of low level foot traffic, no impossible guards and periodic high level players with their guard down.
---
Yeah, it's a little much. Put up a megathread or something to discuss it. It's just the same threads over and over with every OP seemingly thinking it's a new cool idea he thought of in the shower.
---
Soda is at least good at his class, Asmongold is in trouble
---
Shamans have 2 more specs though.  
---
Also Paladins have the best single target healing and mana efficient spec.  
---
That said, a contest in 2005 wouldn't hold a candle to a contest in 2019/20 having all the knowledge we know about the game now.
---
asmongold is in his blacklist group, who do you think hes talking about when he says the other faction?
---
obviously he cant group with ppl who camped him theres no faction transfers in classic dude
---
&gt; It is even more funny, when you are participating in online threads and people start to grammar nazi your comments, instead of appreciating, that the world came to the conclusion to speak your language.
---
This is such a German thing to say, bravo.
---
​
---
&gt;Or the human racial ability 'perception' Or Catseye elixir Or Bloodvine Lens Or Catseye Ultra Goggles
---
The anecdotal examples I gave included none of those racials/items and were very obvious on the beta. After ganking, the person would then typically not go anywhere or jump for the camera before returning. It's fairly obvious, though I understand if it's hard to register and/or your cynicism.
---
I actually feel sick that if you do something Soda decides he doesn't like you could end up blacklisted. It's sad that any other streamer would give him this power that just because a player doesn't want to adhere to HIS rules and how HE wants Classic to be that they arent allowed to be in a good guild. 
---
Pure and absolute bullshit. I really hope Blizzard defines rules on this. Because if I camp someone I don't realize is a streamer I'd hate to get fucked over.
---
As it once was? No. 
---
Better than current retail? 100%.
---
I'm going RPPVP server, if they make one, doubt a Streamer would choose that.
---
There's no real need. Streamers can level to 60 fine entirely in dungeons if needed. They only have to venture out in to the world with a guild posse.  
---
Sounds like a kinda sad way to play the game but that's the reality of a popular streamer.    
---
If he really cared that much about experiencing pvp vanilla properly he'd have a separate off stream anonymous account/character that he plays for 3-4 hours a day that no one knows about. Even if he *only* played it for 3 hours a day he could still easily play and raid at the highest level and experience the game just like a normal person would.
---
Is that 1.5 years on a pve server? If so you missed out on 1.4 years of fun.
---
Imagine obsessing over people playing videogames on twitch THIS much. Who fucking cares about streamers, holy shit
---
&gt; or having a secondary account for scouting, chatting with the opposite faction or something else
---
So cheating? That's fine. He can be black listed in that situation as well lol
---
Why felhunter? Thought rogues dumpstered on locks that aren’t SL
---
Upvote to the top with you. All this is about server rep and world pvp. Dont be a butt if you dont want a reputation as a butt.
---
OR be a butt and make a guild full of butts and have fun hunting them down. Who cares about your reputation with soda's friends when you have your own.
---
This is world pvp at its purist. This is what's awesome about world pvp.
---
booleans are just that, booleans, 1 or 0, true or false. there isnt very true or very false. you're a fucking moron.
---
What really blows my mind is people are already asking about whats next. Dude whats now isn't even out yet. Imagine going to Blizzcon and they announce Warcraft 4, you interview the developers and ask "So whens Warcraft 5?"
---
I wasn’t siding with him, just pointing out that there’s no real solution to the problem (besides adapting)
---
Yeah I know right, it's like all this sub is as of late.....
---
If your're implying that I'm apart of the "obsessed streamer server group" you clearly didn't read my post, where I said I don't want to be associated with them.
---
Angwe. [A ganker so notorious](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11dkyd/i_am_angwe_the_ganker_god_of_world_of_warcraft_ama/) that someone actually made [fanart of him](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JWoTLtPNLSb7RV9QvqWMSj-650-80.jpg)
---
Well, streamers weren't in classic so I'm surprised the no changes crew hasnt blown this up more
---
it should be a excuse for wpvp sure. but theyre trying to blackball people from a massive group of players (and getting streamers who kill them when not sniping banned from twitch)
---
All this salt aimed at streamers kinda makes me want to become a streamer so I can know that I'm contributing to the salt mining at least a little bit
---
sure I understand. But yes thunderfury is BiS offhand you can get for DW pvp
---
I can't be miserable when I'm dead inside.
---
Stop acting like Streamers have never been on a WoW server before.
---
That's a stupid argument. Your solution to people not socializing is to tell people they should be socializing. Well, they aren't and they won't, that's not how humans work. The game doesn't require or encourage interacting with others so most won't do it. It's human nature to pick the path of least resistance. Even if you do stuff with others, you're just doing content that you might as well do alone. It might be a bit more fun, but it's nothing close to the experience of a game like WoW Vanilla, where teamwork is essential and you get a strong sense of achievement when you beat a difficult quest or dungeon with a group of friends.
---
Yes, only PvE server, once shortly did pvp but only got killed up to lvl 15 by other people and couldn’t progress :)
---
I am choosing priest over mage. Change my mind.
---
:( awwww womp womp. Well thanks for letting me know man.
---
He is complaining about people playing the game. Play the game in a way some streamer doesn't like and he is going to try to ruin your ability to play across faction? Seems like collusion to me, a bannable offense under blizz ToS. 
---
Streamers are cancer for the community in the first place, but this entitled crybaby mentality is just making it worse. "Do the thing I want you to, play the game only in the way I say or I will weaponize my fans to punish you" It's acting like a child and should not be something a normal person supports.
---
It's an open game, he can stream if he likes, but the consequences of that action are his own fault.
---
always loved Feralas, have a pretty cool world pvp memory from there as well.
---
If you're farmiliar with the zone you might remember when you're running down the main road you will come across a tree that is knocked over laying on it's side about 10 feet above the walking path. 
---
I was being chased by two people on my hunter and I couldn't shake them, as I was about to run under this tree I got off my mount, dropped a trap and quickly climbed up above the road. The two guys chasing me showed up a few seconds later and i demolished them with my height advantage and them not being able to get into melee range without climbing.
---
I dunno why I still remember that all these years later, i guess it was just a cool way to use my enviroment to even out a 2v1 situation
---
Currently when I play vanilla and group with people I tend to keep typing until they respond.  I will force social interactions upon you!
---
Aren't the stream snipers the ones obsessed with getting attention?
---
&gt; asmongold is in his blacklist group
---
He doesn't have a black list group. It was a random fucking idea he was talking about off the top of his head lol
---
Assume that every food item has a level bracket just like vendor items (lvl 1, 5, 15, 25, etc). 
---
Feed Pet gives a buff over time to your pet that increases its happiness each tick. Happiness will increase by 35/17/8 per tick. The lower level the food, the less happiness per tick. If the food is too low level, the pet will refuse to eat it. 
---
Example: level 5 food will give 35 happiness per tick to a pet until it’s above level 20. Lvl 45 food will do the same for pets 60 or below. 
---
IIRC lvl 1 (no lvl requirement) food starts giving less happiness at lvl 11. If the food is uncooked (boar meat, wolf meat), then you feed it to your pet and check how much happiness it gains.
---
He didn't say wow in general hes talking Classic, giving people a chance to dodge the sperg of streamer followers
---
I made a post on this subreddit about CoH being back for people to play until classic and it was deleted my the mods....
---
That clown is Melderon, he's been playing shaman for some time and is also one if the admins in the classic wow shaman discord, that doesn't mean he's an expert, but he's not entirely clueless either.. i don't get the complaint about the time, can you elaborate why it's a problem?
---
Soda makes coin for griefing leveling players.
---
Soda gets paid for whining about stream snipers who are griefing him.
---
Drama means more views.
---
More views means more coins.
---
I'd just pocket him.
---
&gt; Why do you get to determine what's fine and what's not fine?
---
Griefing someone for literal hours is not fine. This should be obvious.
---
&gt; Why are you telling me that killing someone lower level than you has nothing to do with skill? Of course it doesn't?
---
Because you made a false equivalency to counter-strike which is a completely different situation.
---
im not playing on a streamer server? and ive never said i dont agree with punishing snipers?
---
Yet you made a post and thus associated yourself with them.
---
Windfury would be very simple to measure because it's literally listed separately in the dmg meter.  
---
Everything else would be very hard too impossible to work out exactly, but you would get very close just with estimates if you cared that much. Like you could say BoW is a 3% dps boost for every DS/Ruin warlock in the raid, and you have 5 in the raid doing 1,000 dps so it's 150dps.  
---
This style of measuring probably wouldn't make shamans look that impressive because they can only buff their group.  Buffs that affect the whole raid like Curse of Elements, Sunder, Blessing of Kings would dwarf everything else.
---
Were they on servers in vanilla?
---
How how does it hurt people who dont want to pplay with potential stream snipers.  It's all about reputation. It matters in classic.
---
If you've never played 'Path of Exile' the new league literally comes out tomorrow (6/7) and should keep you busy until classic releases. Free game btw, may as well check it out if you're bored.
---
Paladins are a healer class in Classic. Don't let anyone try to tell you otherwise. They don't tank and they don't do dps.
---
Yeah, that's not Blizzard and you won't get banned in WoW for Twitch policy, Obviously.
---
This is the ToS that matters.
---
https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/fba4d00f-c7e4-4883-b8b9-1b4500a402ea/blizzard-end-user-license-agreement
---
That's my whole point, streamers have been on the same server on Retail for many expansions, and there were no complaints about that.
---
Literally all the top pvpers, and all their followers, and all the others that follow whatever the top pvpers are doing, have been on the same servers already.
---
I'm super confused what you mean by this. Twitch cared enough to find some random person's account and ban them from the entire platform? Source?
---
Fairly certain getting ganked constantly would make for more interesting content.
---
His problem is that he forgot that he made gaming his 'job'.  If people want to see you screwed with, then give the audience what they want.  He is trying to have the best of both worlds... and sadly life typically doesn't work like that.  
---
Anyway... I have to wonder how he thinks this can even be proven?  
---
Even if Blizzard started enforcing such a stupid rule, or he played on a PvE server... people can still go to the zone he is in and kill the quest givers over and over again to screw with his progression.  Honestly.. taking out quest givers hurts a lot more than camping someone till they accept res sickness.  
---
There is no proving stream sniping in that scenario... at all.
---
&gt;then they will realize that they need to slow down, use some CC, etc.
---
Thats not how you spell, get pissed off, complain on the forums and quit the game.
---
lmao, yea. Paying customers get privilege
---
It's really, really clever tbh. 
---
Gauge server load. Create hype. Make money.
---
&gt;Oh so you mean NOTHING WILL HAPPEN? lol. And with your analogy, what would happen if i called the police on a vegan snatching my food? Something will happen and im sure it would stop. Im glad we could dissect this together
---
... Yeah? If they don't have a twitch account nothing will happen, because you don't have an account. Twitch can't ban non existent accounts, because they don't exist.
---
&gt;I already said it's fine to make his blacklist, and that his attitude and entitlement was more of the issue
---
His entitlement to making a blacklist? But you just said you're okay with it? Or what entitlement do you find bad?
---
&gt; Well, PvE servers are literally just the game with an aspect of the game removed.
---
PvE servers add a feature to the game: the ability to be unflagged for PvP. You can still run around with "please force me to stop what I'm doing and PvP" mode on if you want though. And in the end, having world PvP on doesnt make the game harder, it just makes everything take longer. But if that's what you want then I'm glad you enjoy it.
---
no it's pretty evenly split between pvp and pve servers.
---
don't worry about it and when classic comes closer and we get a server list there's gonna be some paranoid mongoloids on this sub that will make a big "avoid these servers" list.
---
Happiness level is shown next to the pet frame with the green/yellow/red icon that’s smiling/frowning depending on the pet’s happiness.
---
Loyalty level should be displayed in the pet tab (I think it’s Shift+P?) as well as whenever you go to a stable master. 
---
The green “happiness” icon in the pet tab is NOT the happiness bar. It’s always green no matter what, and only serves to know what food types your pet will eat when you mouseover it.
---
I've read through multiple comments of you saying people are obsessed with steamers . I feel you're obsessed with pointing out that people are enjoying being around or talking about streamers as if it's a bad thing ?
---
They were on the same servers during many retail expansions, didn't see any complaints about "streamers" ruining the game.
---
I see your mistake.
---
You're rolling Alliance.
---
Go Horde!  :)
---
My opinion on it is this: You shouldn't stream snipe. Just because they are streaming out their location to the world, doesn't mean you should sit there and watch and hunt them down and wait for opportunities to take them on when they are low so you can get your bragging rights of "OH MY GOD I KILLED SODA" when he is sitting and drinking at 30% health.
---
It's a courtesy thing. Like players at 60 who don't gank level 20s because they know they can't fight back and it's just cruel.
---
Obviously you can play the game how you so choose and do what you like, nobody can stop you, but in my opinion, this is a very minor form of cheating.
---
What a baby, makes millions of dollars streaming but can't handle the one downside
---
How about Tanaris.  
---
Tan-R-iss  
---
or, Tana-riss
---
Please don't remind people of this
---
So you would recommend me not going the paladin route, as what I am used to does not exist in Classic?
---
I liked playing hunter, but it seems that they are the butt of  every joke in Classic and aren’t well regarded in PVE. 
---
Warrior, maybe?
---
Everyone in this thread cannot tell the difference between PvP/ganking and stream sniping. Instead they are jumping on the "hate streamers because they're rich, famous and have beta which I don't" bandwagon. Like holy shit. Peoples pettiness/jealousy is so obvious. Is fair treatment to others out of the question because they are so rich, famous and have access to beta?
---
I am being civil. I can tell I wont change your mind no matter what I say so there is no point
---
Now every time I gank a streamer, someone has to decide if it's PvP or hate.  Doesn't sound like a ME problem.
---
So not in vanilla...
---
Perhaps I misunderstood the post. If the streamer and his followers want to blacklist someone go for it. That's the name of the game. If they mass report people to get them banned, then that is wrong.
---
I tried to find subs in a similar situation, like /r/borderlands3, but they fell in the 1% range too... Do you know a not tiny and not too new 4% sub?
---
I expect this to be patched out by next week
---
good bye unlimited free drinks and portals
---
Explain the differences and Ill tell you how youre wrong.
---
This is an excellent point - A PvE server essentially removes the "in game solution" part that a PVP server provides.
---
Makes me worried about people being mass reported for "ruining" a streamer's event by lagging into the ironforge canal...
---
So would a warrior be closest to what I am accustomed to? Or is there just no equivalent to retail pally in Classic?
---
If you do not want to heal, I do not advise it. 
---
Blizzard eventually realized that paladin's lack of mana generation, coupled with low mana pools and underwhelming prot tree, made them subtier tanks, and eventually fixed it, but that came later.
---
If you play pally in raids, you'll be a single target healer and blessing dispenser... period. You can also save 1 person from time to time with divine intervention. But that's it.
---
Thankyou! I had a hunter on a pserver but I could barely keep up with his blackhole of a stomach so I decided to stop playing him. Now when Classic comes I might have a Hunter alt if the feeding eventually comes down.
---
Honestly, seeing how the game plays level capped, I almost want progression servers that unlock like, 10 levels at a time, month to month, just to see how it plays.
---
rookie mistake
---
While bitching at the tank/healer/DPS about how shit they must be for not handling it.
---
You mean you’ve read 2 comments... lol
---
2.
---
Not criticizing, just genuinely curious why is MCP so great for this build? 
---
Wouldn't something like Quel'serrar or Lok'amir il Romathis be a better choice when combo'd with a decent off hand?
---
Even if Soda tries to do this, it won't work.  As if only the streamer guilds are going to be able to do content and all non streamer guilds will respect the wishes to blacklist people who trolled them.
---
Even if somehow, the streamers controlled every guild on each faction and did this, if name changes ever come out people would be fine still.
---
This sounds like empty threats coming from someone who's just pissed at the snipers.
---
Hell yeah. Oomkin here I come!
---
Faster weapon=more procs. The whole build is maxing out proc/min and increasing damage of said procs.
---
Haha heck yeah man that's what's classic is all about. Goodtimes!
---
This post is in an odd limbo of ‘you care enough to say you don’t care’
---
 Thanks r/Minkelz. That’s exactly why I’d love to see this...As my initial example referred to BoK.
---
I don't think this is going to work in the way that blizz thinks it will.  I think they think it'll give them ideas of numbers per server but in reality if the server you reserved names on is low pop on launch (or has obvious faction imbalance early on) you'll be going somewhere else :p
---
Yep! Happiness is the little face icon raised by feeding your pet, it's the general mood of your pet. It'll go down if the pet dies and goes down slowly while the pet is out.
---
Loyalty is how much the pet 'likes' you. It raises from feeding your pet, fighting with your pet, and keeping your pet out. The higher the loyalty, the less you'll have to feed your pet.
---
TF is fine for damage output, and in a world where it wasn't limited in its availability, most Rogues would use it in both PvP and PvE. So yes, it's good for Fury Warriors, too, even if Fury Warriors aren't good in PvP.
---
If you're going to be respeccing for PvP anyway, you might as well play Arms.
---
I don’t really want to play on a server with a  big streamer but I don’t care enough to try and find out where they will be or re-roll if I end up on one. Nice to know the really paranoid people will do the work for me.
---
Dude just wait until release to make your character by then we will all know their server
---
Can I join your guild? Lol
---
You underestimate 50,000 8th graders
---
Grende 
---
Big
---
Anklebiter
---
You might need to read again. 
---
You are saying they cannot impose those rules onto those who don't watch the streams and don't care about them or their community.
---
I'm saying they CAN, and any such player will be unaware he is blacklisted until he attempts to join a progression guild.
---
You: "They can't"
---
Me: "They can"
---
you won't find a faster pace than rogue
---
Yeah man just go pick up your ironfoe, ezpz.
---
90% of the responses on this thread are pretty damn stupid. I'm only here on the sidelines because its entertaining as fuck to read.
---
this is slightly an inaccurate take tho, if he denies help from dickriders, then getting sniped constantly by a sniper guild would require him to break that.
---
when sniping gets bad enough, only a team of dickriders can actually help
---
No. 6 months of studying (textbooks, not WoW) and sure
---
Just play the game man, don't focus on what others are doing. Pick a server and play.
---
I hope streamers get sniped on Classic Wow.  Maybe we can have a game that avoids their cancer.
---
Destiny isn’t the same. The classes aren’t nearly as different in that as they were in WoW.
---
Smaller world, community interaction matters more, no one in vanilla had a giant mob following them around almost all the time they were on.
---
&gt;PvE servers add a feature to the game: the ability to be unflagged for PvP
---
The opposite it takes away wPvP as an element that you're forced to deal with. 
---
&gt;But if that's what you want then I'm glad you enjoy it.
---
I'm glad you enjoy the game with a large chunk of it removed, thereby making it easier. My little sister likes PvE servers too XD
---
The current state of theory crafting
---
&gt; Nice, a lot of backtracking there.
---
Nah, you're just clearly not interested in delving further into the conversation because I got you beat. That and responding to that much text is a lot of work, so it's easier for you to just cop out. I get it. 
---
&gt; Even after my little school lesson for you, you are still struggling with this whole opinion/fact concept..
---
No I understand fully. As I already said, I approached this from the position that people actually had proof or some kind of strong argument for the things they were saying. 
---
Turns out it was mostly straight opinion without much backing it up. 
---
&gt; "my train set is faster" is a fact, because the word faster in that context is objective due to it being a comparison of speed or velocity. 
---
No, that's pretty much what most people on here are suggesting. "Classic WoW is the best version of the game." = "My train set is faster!"
---
&gt; And I'm sorry, but there are absolutely hundreds of arguments for why people prefer classic on this subreddit.
---
And as I said, most of them are purely opinions with little to no fact or strong argument to back up their claims. It was my fault for asking them to delve further and forgetting that opinions don't have to have truth for them to be true for the poster. 
---
&gt; There are also countless YouTube videos explaining why people think it's better.
---
Opinions can't really be wrong as I've already pointed out. They can also be heavily skewed based on that person's experience. But when you look at the game as a whole, you see problems. Oh so many problems. 
---
&gt; But fact is that you just choose to simply disagree with every single one of those arguments,
---
Just because respond doesn't mean you have a strong argument lol. As I already said in the post you didn't read, you presented a decent argument and I pointed that out to you. However, it didn't stand up to scrutiny. 
---
&gt;  because you obviously dislike what outcome they may lead to, hence my mentioning of cognitive dissonance.
---
You are projecting again. 
---
&gt; There is no point explaining anything more to someone who cannot see past his own opinion on any point at all.
---
I can if you can actually present me with something that holds up to scrutiny lol. You've offered ***nothing*** to sway my opinion and most of your arguments have no weight. 
---
Hell, I even offered you to pick a specific topic in my post that you didn't read and you haven't done that. 
---
&gt; I am absolutely wasting my time here.
---
I'm the one that wrote that massive post that you didn't bother reading lol. 
---
&gt; You are a very closed minded arrogant person, and you are not capable of having a proper discussion about this. I hope you grow out of that some day.
---
More projection. 
---
So I guess this proves it for me. Not a single person on here has any factual basis or strong argument as to why Classic is good. Everyone's point of view is purely opinionated and coming from a place of emotion. 
---
That's going to turn this place into a toxic wasteland, I can tell.
---
Lol, did you just learn that word today? The entire post is about a beta tester not reporting bugs because he is an entitled fucking twat that thinks rules don't apply to him by virtue of plebs like you stroking his epeen. But keep it up, maybe if you suck up to his e-peen enough, someday when he is tanking UBRS he will allow you the honor of collecting the sweat from his ballsack in your mouth.  As the entire fucking thread is about a beta tester not testing and reporting bugs, my comment isn't a tangent, it is literally on topic. 
---
P.S. drink bleach
---
You could look up some videos about prot and ret paladin on youtube from vanilla or pservers so you can get a taste of how they play.
---
As for hunters, they are by no means a joke. Very fun to play in both pve and pvp, the only real issue is that there's quite a few of them and there's not that many raidspots for hunters. 
---
Warriors are a buttload of fun too, you probably get the closest to the ret paladin feeling from playing a warrior. Really fun class in pve, in pvp however they are rough solo, with heals/group they are pretty good again. Hardest part is just the leveling and all the effort you need to put in.
---
I can't wait for the big guild wars. This is what world pvp and server rep is about!
---
Talk regularly in overwatch and you get your account suspended.
---
I'm usually For The Horde! And stuff but.... cheering for the Alliance on this one to gank him hard everyday.
---
Yup you've misunderstood it, none of the bigger streamers have mentioned mass reporting people as far as I'm aware, and also the mass report system doesn't automatically ban people (though it does auto mute people)
---
What’s funny about stream sniping, or any kind of disruption of streamer events, is that 99% of us love and romanticize this kind of in-game knavery from the era before streamers were a thing. 
---
The famous raid on the winterspring funeral for example was fucking hilarious. Having a cross-faction spy to gather intel and gank people was the height of oldschool wow awesomeness. 
---
But now we have the zoomer era of streamers where we have people making tonnes of money by broadcasting themselves and their in-game events, but we have to treat them with kid-gloves now???????? If anything their activities should be disrupted way more intensely than some 2005 rp event ever was.
---
I’m not obsessing over streamers, it’s rather the other impacts they will have on the server:
---
1. Server Queues- Asmon has 40k viewers at a time. Imagine the queue to get into your server.
---
2. [Streamer Maintained Blacklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/bx4iac/sodapoppins_streamer_privileged_paradise_server/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) that is ran by streamers that use their influence to essentially ruin you for camping them.
---
3. AQ event will be given to someone for simply existing.
---
4. Killing someone and camping their body to only get hundreds of death threats, reports, and spam because the streamer got pissy with you.
---
5. GMs taking their side when it comes to issues because they are the ones bringing new players to the game.
---
They will control a GOOD portion of the community whether you like it or not.
---
I don't care what anyone says including this kid. If you play on a PvP server on an opposing faction with me and stream I'm going to tune in and kill you whenever possible. I watch twitch streams all the time so this is no stream hate. This is my faction vs yours and I'm gonna do everything aside from harrassment and corpse camping to you. If you're publicly broadcasting your location I will tune in and kill you by myself or with friends. Beg the GMs for help
---
I had two 60s in vanilla, even with all there was to do! First was a paladin too. Farming as a paladin made me want an alt. Lol
---
Yeah, here's a tip: Stop playing retail to prep for Classic. It won't help you a damned bit. The combat is different, the classes are different, the zones are different, the quests are different, the XP efficiency is different, the leveling speed is different, etc. If you want some mildly authentic way of preparing for Classic, play on a pserver instead.
---
This is a great story. I hope you find your friends!
---
I think streamers will be split - some of PvE for the reason you said but others on PvP because they’re PvP players and want to partake, plus their fans expect it. As someone else said, after release there will probably be a list of realms to avoid but equally I wouldn’t deny yourself a high population realm to avoid them, I doubt they will be as big problem as people believe.
---
The irony in this. This thread actually makes me think that’d be a good idea now since a bunch of butt hurt kids are already planning to stream snipe (cheat). Idgaf if people kill him organically but stream sniping is fucking lame on a PvP server.
---
I’m so in. We rolling horde or ally?
---
Streamer servers aren't a thing. It's just what conspiracy theory by people who wish they had fans.
---
That’s what I was expecting. I thought they were going to charge each other and disappear into a different phase
---
I’ve been just toying around on a pserver while I wait for the new Poe league... it’s been really fun and it’s def helped with the waiting.
---
And now you're pulling stuff out of your ass. He never said he would do that. 
---
He will only blacklist if he deems a player as "stream sniper", whatever that means on his head. Which is toxic enough for me, but still doesn't go as far as you say.
---
I remember Feralas being a beautiful change from all of the desert/savanna zones prior as Horde.
---
They track hidden.
---
Few hundred thousand a year?!? Haha yah right, more like over a million, if not millions a year. 
---
There were KOS lists in wow before, and people got camped all the time. You know what you would do? Log off, or go on an alt until time passes and people got bored.
---
And by making this post you become the person you complain about.
---
&gt; unless if specifically there is mistakes about who is and isn't streamsniping. I can somewhat understand the fear of randomly killing a guy who is streaming and being accused of being a streamsniper, but honestly I doubt that's how it's going to be, and it is certainly not the intention. The intention is to get rid of toxic streamsnipers who spend absurd amount of time specifically hunting down streamers by watching their stream.
---
What is ink anyways lol
---
Wound poison reduces healing by ~135. Similar to mortal strike, but not a mortal strike. 
---
(A better example is Hex of Weakness, which the 20% troll racial.)
---
Lets be real, if a sniper wants to ruin your experience on a PVE servers, its very fucking easy. Play druid, moonfire tag literally everything the streamer wants to kill, contest all their mining nodes. The game is now unplayable for the streamer.
---
Nothing quite like being the best, tankiest healer on the field who can also reliable nuke people for 1.2k holy shock crits.
---
Irony.
---
I still make friends in online games but they are almost always over the age of 25. The online culture has changed so much. I used to love League of Legends but that player base went into the ground.
---
It's kinda different. OP doesn't care about the streamer things people are discussing, but he cares that people are constantly discussing it filling up his reddit page.
---
That's hilarious since Soda is one of the biggest trolls. I'd have zero remorse
---
It makes no difference what server they are on. Leave em alone and let them play their game and just play yours. Its not hurting anyone.
---
I hope they are too, but to be fair, a lot of them have probably moved on a lot with their lives and between work and family won’t have the time to invest in classic. Who knows though, I fucking love the idea of Dave cancelling a shoot or show to level a char.
---
Lmfao dude you’re acting like there’s only gonna be 1 server for everything. Find out whatever streamer you have a hate boner for and switch to a different realm before getting invested in a character or some shit.
---
Content creators are one of the best ways to market your game, why wouldn't they take advantage of that? Of course the big names get an invite, which i don't really have a problem with seen as it's more views for classic
---
Who said it exactly? Aren't we talking about what sodapopin said he would do? Why bring up anoth-- sigh- .
---
Well that wont be a problem if he goes on to a pve server. But hell yeah I will stream snipe any chance I get. They wanted a job playing video games all day and streaming it. Thats cool I would do it if I wanted to/could but there is a price to it and that is stream sniping.
---
I have a quite big group of game friends. Most of them never played wow. And vanilla wow I'm the only one who played.
---
My goal is to get all of them to play. It would be awesome.
---
&gt; Can you quote the rules about owning a second account and them stating it's considered cheating?
---
How about we just look at the definition of cheating?
---
&gt;act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage
---
Fits the bill pretty good!
---
much rather they do this made up system then blizzard banning everyone. maybe thats what you want? im confused.
---
Tbh the hunter dungeon set is surprisingly good at least compared to any other of the sets.
---
I myself can’t imagine watching someone’s stream in order to learn their location. That’s what you would do when you were 7 years old and playing goldeneye with your friends, after which you hopefully adopted a tiny bit of ethics in your life.
---
There was a celebrities who play WoW list I read on this sub awhile back. Mila Kunis was on it as well
---
Why am I bringing up the things the guy has said to me? Are you really confused on how a conversation works?
---
I’ll be rolling with 30 other friends. Whatever realm we choose, we are stuck.
---
It's honestly the only part I love about w pvp. I hate ganking but the guild on guild fights are awesome and built lots of rivalries. Back in wintergrasp ibloved seeing these fights go down
---
Dps doesn't matter nearly as much as damage range, and Barb is significantly slower than Ashkandi which puts their single hit damage very close.
---
Ashkandi has more Melee AP but for the actual shooting Barb is going to win out imo because of the crit you gain from the Agi.
---
I get your point but Youtube monetization and Twitch are pretty different. He should just play PVE server.
---
I’m not posting that I care or don’t care about streamers?
---
I’m posting that repetitive, posting streamers every breath, every comment is just a bit tiresome. 
---
I have 0 issue with streamers, I watch a lot of them, but this sub is fucking obsessed with them. Just look at NEW, it’s riddled with the shit. 
---
Low effort karma grabbing bullshit posts.
---
Haha this helped!
---
Desolace -&gt; Feralas -&gt; Shimmering is awesome leveling.
---
The true $100 inkjet experience: rich colors at the start, faded out colors at the end because $100 only lasted 1 full page picture back then.

https://classicdb.ch/?item=12190
---
&gt;AKA no rules are being broken with stream sniping in wow so its not cheating, so stop implying it is
---
Oh you're hooked on this? Sorry, you must have not been able to focus hard enough, I call it "Cheating" because having a GPS of enemy players is not an intended feature for Classic, and streamers do not stream their location for the purpose of allowing others to hunt them down. It's a grey area, but if you disagree with the term "Cheating" then just blank it out in your mind and try your hardest to focus your brain on the greater point rather than the single word.
---
&gt;"DONT KILL ME OR ELSE MY GROUP OF ELITE STREAMER FRIENDS AND THEIR LEGIONS OF FANS WILL HATE YOU!!!" This is a sarcastic TLDW on what he said, but he was 100% serious. If he said it with humor and was humble about it, and not as an actual threat, this thread wouldnt even exist. Its almost like he's offering a challenge "you wouldnt dare camp me! or else!" It is unwarranted self grandiose
---
You have an extreme victim complex if that's how you took it, that isn't normal dude.
---
I can try to explain why it is a bad idea, imo:
---
Your DPS is a cardinal value, aka a number you can evaluate, for example: 200 DPS is bad player, 500 DPS is an average player, 1000 DPS is an exceptional player.
---
Your buffs are nominal values. While they do have certain numbers attached to them, in fact they are binary. You either provide them or you don't. And the raid absolutely expects you to provide them, so it does not measure or represent your skill, at least in vanilla. There is one exception where an argument could be made, the totem twisting technique - but once again, it's either worth to be used on certain encounters or it is not.
---
Well in that tos you are also not allowed, while it doesn't state stream snipping specifically, this Would go against "3" and can go both under cheating, see C, II and C IX
---
Imagine watching this and thinking he's serious. Jesus christ
---
whats wrong with it? i love stream sniping but thats the point
---
Anyone between the ages of 25-35? Rescue rangers was the shit for anyone growing up in the 90s
---
I loved popping Unending Breath and diving into the water to see what's there.
---
Oh of course. It's just that on a pve server, it removes a layer of possible griefing. That being said. I wouldn't want to stream classic. What made the vanilla experience great, I think, could be very much ruined by a gaggle of idiots following you around all the time
---
&gt;Why would I not work with someone on my faction because they camped some streamer on the opposite faction.
---
Obviously *you* wouldn't if you're just some random dude. 
---
But the concept of the 'blacklist' is that streamers from both factions would work together to blacklist streamsnipers from both factions, because all streamers dislike being streamsniped. It'd be mutually beneficial for the streamers to work together to 'blacklist' the harassers. Since the majority of twitch streamers are planning on playing on the same server, pretty evenly split between the factions, with their own guilds, friends, followers and fanboys, they'd make up a considerable part of that specific servers community, which would make the 'blacklist' more effective.
---
Say I roll Alliance and streamsnipe Soda repeatedly, he might eventually add me to the list and suddenly all Alliance streamers and their guilds wouldn't play with me, I can't get invited to group content, I can't get invited to raid pugs, I can't queue for premade BGs, etc. It'd be just like having a bad rep was in Vanilla, a social outcast, only more severe because, in theory, the majority of the server population would follow the list.
---
You’re honestly a dumbass if you think it’s not possible for people to find a specific person at all times to camp.
---
Being a healer is fun in PvP if the aholes you heal actually give a crap about helping you. Most of the time that does not happen. Warriors don't give a crap about you, they just remember you when they are not healed. It's like they are wearing those things horses use in the eyes to just look upfront. So ye, a good healer in PvP is awesome to have but you are also very very dependent on other people. Oh and being called a healbot is always fun too.
---
This guy, he gets it. 
---
Exactly, I enjoy some streamers, dislike others... the same I enjoy some food and dislike other food... but because I don’t like X food but love Y food, I do not feel the need to constantly post about it.
---
Thunderfury, if I remember right, is a Main Hand weapon, so you can’t equip it in offhand.
---
I agree to an extent. You obviously cant tell if somebody is stream sniping just because they are ganking you. But people in this thread have been talking about forming groups and guilds with the only purpose being hunting down and camping streamers. If the same group or guild is constantly camping you then i would say that is stream sniping.
---
But yes for the most part it should not be bannable because that is impossible to enforce.
---
Have you played Vanilla or BC on a well populated PvP server?
---
Because being ganked was normal.
---
An elite or city raid a month was normal.   
---
If you don't interfere you're not on the thread table and it won't attack you. Only a few mobs did AoE, just don't get near it. You can also hide somewhere, get a drink.  
---
WoW isn't about fast fast fast. Getting everything and fast is what made retail unattractive.
---
Soda is a human being. He wants to play WoW Classic. He likes PvP, so he is on a PvP server.
---
He doesn't do delay, because it's stupid (chat interaction doesn't work at all [and it won't help, WoW is slow]).
---
He also dislikes that little PvP fights always end in 40+ vs 40+ raids.
---
He just wants to play. Streaming is how he makes money. You basically say: "Hey work somewhere else. I don't know you, but I hate you!"
---
I bet he's ok with being ganked if the other person doesn't stream snipe (and if you watch him, most people somehow always know where he is even though he's prowling). [Just don't fucking stream snipe. Make things fair.]
---
Soda sometimes seems rude if you only see him for short moments, but he's a really good person. Watch him, watch his brothers and friends, you'll see.
---
This sounds like an unhealthy attitude to have toward a video game.
---
Stream sniping is for garbage players.
---
He’s a commie.  Entitlement is in his blood.
---
Exactly. People have been crying about how theres no community anymore, then when a community does something like this people whine.
---
I am aware of how rare it is. Which is why I X-fingers. I intend on being the guild leader and main tank. So it's not really gonna be much of a vote. As who else are you going to give it to? The off tank? As far as being worthy. I have been a successful main tank through AQ40. Can't say as I've ever done Naxx but, I know I'm good enough too.
---
Buy a base WoW account, and pay the sub. You don’t need any of the expansions
---
No reason at all, just play how you want buddy! If you don't like world pvp then the pve servers should be perfect for you. They still have active BGs on them too.
---
You just need a subscription to WoW, no base game purchase.
---
Commenting so I can watch this later
---
The same reason I don't like 20 screaming kids in a movie theater.
---
You just sub for 15 USD a month, that's all you need.
---
Except that doesn’t prove Blizzard consider it cheating. I could argue streamers getting handouts is cheating as well, since it gives an unfair advantage. Fact is the rule is worded like that, so they can at their on discredition determine what is cheating case by case and so you can’t argue with shit like “That wasn’t stated as cheating in the rules”.
---
Get yourself a Corsair Scimitar mmo gaming mouse from [scan.com](https://scan.com) for £30 i did and its loads better than the cheap plasticy Razer Naga's which i had 2 of.
---
Oh dear... i have a victim complex for recognizing behavior that is elitist? Then you explain to me why there is such a fuss about this? Im just calling it how i see it. Everyone but you and streamers have a victim complex?
---
Imagine being so bad you need to cheat LUL
---
Do you want 500 spergs ganking you in Blackrock Mountain because a streamer is raiding and doesn't want to get ganked?
---
Childhood me had a NSFW image of ***Inquisitor Whitemane*** printed out on a piece of paper.
---
I have a serious question...why do people WANT to play beta? I mean I'm as excited as the next guy, and I'd understand if it was a new game and you wanted to maybe try out the classes to find out what you like or just see a glimpse of what the devs have been working on...but this game has been out for FIFTEEN years...everyone knows the classes inside and out, most of us could navigate the zones blindfolded...whats the appeal of making a character you can only level to 30 and will be gone in two months...
---
The npc respawns will aggro onto you, so you'd either have to kill them or walk in a strange pathing that will probably make it obvious to other players.
---
Besides trying to camouflage as a lock is just strange, instead you should be running around spreading that stv terror.
---
I meant for AoE threat generation *for* the tank. My paladin will be a healer, but I'm trying to work out efficient AoE grinding as a Warrior/Paladin/Warlock/2 Mages
---
YouDontGnoMe
---
From what I can tell a misplaced jealousy
---
That's not true. He reads chat often. His chat gets out of control often as well and he's not a super human.
---
It looks good, nothing wrong with that
---
I don't believe the live players will be any less subtle when stream sniping, because the aim is to typically be noticed on stream.
---
The good thing will be that if the list is abused, it'll all be streamed and people will see. But I doubt many will care outside of reddit.
---
This is the most retarded analogy I've seen so far. You don't get banned for corpsecamping.
---
Thanks dude! Since I have less time to play as a 31yo dude then a 15yo version of me, I expect I can just semi-afk chill play quests and grind, reserve PvP for battlegrounds (even more so now, then back in the day: skipping school as much as I could, lol)
---
I am completely the opposite. Have even been playing through old Warcraft games to get back into the mood and lore. First time playing them in 10-15 years. Can’t fucking wait.
---
Than they should? They're not blizzard. Sure they have fans but they also have haters
---
 This is all balanced
---
world pvp in bfa? lol everyone is unflagged/ or non aggressive
---
Good point
---
This is almost identical to what I use on all my characters!
---
&gt;I get they have a whole entourage around them and stuff 
---
Yeah, which is why people want to avoid them. It disrupts the flow of the game.
---
"wHaT cLaSs ShOuLD I rOlL?"
---
&gt; Except that doesn’t prove Blizzard consider it cheating.
---
I don't really care if Blizzard considering it cheating or not. This discussion has no relevance on what Blizzard thinks. It's about how people view things.
---
Use CC. Lol that’s a good one.
---
Stream sniping is cheating? Lol, and what rules are being broken, exactly? Going to where a guy who is publicly broadcasting his location is cheating?
---
So you think it's unlikely. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
---
I don't know though, why you got such impression, I think it's extremely likely to be deemed an 'stream sniper' without even watching any of the streams to take advantage of said streamer's position.
---
I myself play with an addon which allows me to add players to a 'kill on sight' list. If someone ganks me 3v1 they are on my list, and wherever I find them I will camp them until I get bored, does this count as Stream sniping to you? 
---
If not, will you tell me it would be super rare for said streamer to mark me as stream sniper?
---
Why not just use Atiesh for mage?
---
&gt;i have a victim complex for recognizing behavior that is elitist?
---
You have a victim complex for seeing people not wanting to play with people who fuck with them as elitist, yeah
---
I'm just as shocked as you. He has always been the pinnacle of maturity.
---
Before Shroud joined and made him look like a pleb.
---
i love esfands wow content he mainly focuses on gameplay and mechanics with a bit of fun personality, his IRL and other gaming content is awful though, its almost the complete opposite of the wow stuff he does
---
The scale of things was impressive for the time.
---
Drinking water and eating clean will make you stay up a lot better then eating shit and drinking soft drink.
---
You do remember somewhat right, it was mainhand for almost the entire game but in 1.12 it's a onehander. 
---
https://itemization.info/item/19019
---
Are you actually being serious??
---
Just enjoy it. You will learn as you play, but if you don’t enjoy it, you won’t want to continue playing. Don’t follow level guides and stuff, just take your time, sink into the community and love the shit out of it.
---
Layering is only for week or 2
---
It mentions exploiting bugs, using botting software, hacking the game, and using unauthorized code and software that changes game functionality.
---
I'm not trying to be an ass, I read it.  I don't see where it says you can't stream snipe.
---
On PS I’ve found Warrior and Rogue much slower and more deaths but Classic might be different.
---
Lmao. You definitley have the entitlement of a streamer thats for sure. Sorry friend but this is world of warcraft and people will fuck with you if you roll on a pvp server, rofl
---
Damn, thanks for the info!
---
No fuck you.
---
Streamers need their own leper colony server. They must play on that server and everyone who wants to make a character there is warned that this is where all the streamers and snipers are segregated too. Also, if you are caught streaming on a different server instead of being banned your character is transferred to the streamer server.
---
So.. did I read it wrong? Or was I right? Is MCP better than TF CA and HC?
---
&gt;Lmao. You definitley have the entitlement of a streamer thats for sure
---
Surely you insisting that people should play with you even if you fuck with them is entitled, no?
---
Yeah I still don't understand Twitch culture. I'm 26 but I guess that's old in Twitch age.

Some of this stuff went to healers, but a lot of times it got taken for offspecs or it just got DE'd.
---
Flexmaster indeed! Chiiiiiilllll Winston! I certainly am not offended, nor do I care, nor do I hate nor like streamers. But uh... are you okay man?
---
&gt; The best part of not having a LFG system is that if you want to kick a member of the group out, it will take you an extra 20 minutes (searching for a replacement, the replacement flying to the dungeon, etc) to replace them. 
---
That's not really a selling point TBH. I did Deadmines the other day on beta and the rogue in our group started to be toxic as fuck. They wanted a cloak that our warrior tank got because it had agil on it. He started to name drop us telling us who he was and said that his DPS was higher than everyone else so he deserved that green cloak. 
---
The rogue and the warrior started to bicker back and forth and the rest of us were just like, "can we please finish?" 
---
And so we did. We get to VanCleef, killed him, the boss drops his blue cloak, rogue rolls need takes it and immediately leaves the group. 
---
It goes both ways. You could get someone who deserves to be kicked and you kind of can't really do it. Or you get non-malicious situations where people just have to go because life gets in the way. I used to have entire groups fall apart for that reason as I am sure everyone here can attest to. 
---
It's not about instant gratification and I do not understand why so many posters on here feel the need to have this high and mighty attitude when it comes to this game. 
---
It's about Blizzard realizing that the player's time is valuable to them and anything that can improve upon player participation in the game is overall healthy for the game.
---
I’m in beta, I haven’t seen any mobs of people following streamers. Matter of fact, you can just hop on a streamers twitch and see for yourself.
---
Didn't mean to imply you weren't, just wanted to make sure you understood since your phrasing kinda have that impression.  Best of luck!
---
Yeah but thats just like your opinion man.
---
Fun detected.
---
too bad theres literally nothing to do there :(
---
No that's not streamsniping.
---
Anyway I'm fine with you thinking that "miss labeling" kills like this could be a problem, it's a completely valid concern.
---
What part of
---
&gt;I’m not worried about it
---
Was that hard to understand?
---
Get over it dude lol.
---
You don't care of your own enjoyment of the game?
---
Nope!
---
It's not an enemy to your own faction. It's an enemy to the streamers fans. You can choose who you want to play. I can choose not to play with someone who streamsnipes just because I dont like that he did that. It's my choice.
---
Nothing here is forced so what's the issue?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4U4vr_Ra3o
---
Yeah I think only a few guilds will have the mentality of guilds in vanilla. 40 people is a lot and everyone having stable connections and not keyboard turning is going to make it easier to the point if you aren’t trying to be server first it probably won’t matter much what you play
---
Aside from Runescape, EQ has also released classic/progression servers.
---
People like to think that WoW is doing something new and revolutionary but that is not the case. Just like people think WoW was the first MMO they also think WoW Classic is the first re-release of an MMO.
---
I like it
---
I’m not actually going to play mage, my point was more of: if thunderfury drops, I don’t care what class I’m playing I’d equip it. (Not that it’s possible on all classes, but you get the idea)
---
Aww you still want attention? Please, cry more.
---
Thanks!!
---
then why do people get so upset about them
---
Maybe the duel troll was testing the grief policy for the game? Now we all know what it is. Apparently he is doing more good for the beta test than these 'lel duel me bro' streamers.
---
i mean i love twitch culture and spamming shit, ill use twitch prime for sure...
---
but my actual money? fuck no, why would i give my money to some dude who has more money and plays video games all day while i work my ass off.
---
Yeah I'll be contacting law enforcement for these real life threats.
---
Didn't Sodapoppin streamsnipe Mitch Jones just before Level cap increase?
---
Kind of hypocritical from his side.
---
Can you help 32 year-old me because I can't decide.
---
Trying tactics to level as fast as possible is completely within the spirit of the game.
---
Another mage is still better.
---
But you just deemed owning two accounts as cheating then, you set the rules and determine what is considered cheating? And the discussion was about you not being able to prove someone is stream sniping, even though they repeatedly gank streamers. If someone ganks a level 32 priest leveling, you got no way of proving it’s stream sniping if he’s just leveling in STV the entire day and gets ganked repeatedly by the same person.
---
&gt;Your standing in the community actually matters in classic, Sodapoppin literally wants to make a blacklist that is controlled by streamers to ruin people's reputations so they cannot enjoy the game.
---
What's the difference? It all relies on the enough people in the server community caring enough, if enough people do it's all fair game. Say I'm a guild leader of a major guild, and I'm good friends with the 6 next biggest guild leaders, if I decide some guy that was ninja looting in my group should be blacklisted and tell my friends to do the same. Is that somehow unfair to that guy? This is just how social status/reputation works, if I can get enough people to agree with me, that's the way it goes. 
---
I don't see why it should be different when streamers do it.
---
Open a chat to the Blizzard support. I was able to recover my old account from 2005. I was able to get it back by knowing the original server + character name and then I needed to upload image of my local drivers licence.
---
I dont even understand what you're asking? I have no control over who i play with, and i dont fucking broadcast my location 24/7, basically inviting people to harass me lol... And if i did, i wouldnt cry like a bitch about some social hierarchy needing to be implemented because i understand i did this to myself.
---
LMAO
---
There is not even a paid base account anymore, create starter account and sub and you have every expansion except BFA.
---
I would be surprised if they have done most the quests for 30-40 already forba challenge
---
That and paranoia.
---
I have heard the opposite of this on multiple occasions from different people. Griefing is against TOS and what Blizzard considers to be griefing is at their discretion. 
---
30min of camping? Not likely.
---
10 hours at the graveyard? I could see them considering that a violation of conduct.
---
No problem friend
---
So if he camps, he’s just being an asshole player and sees no issue. But if he gets camped, then it’s inherently streamsniping? 
---
Camping is camping, get over it.
---
Yeah. I remember we had a number of dps players who would regularly be below the tank on the damage meter, and a couple more players with bad connections, so we'd pretty regularly have 2-3 players DC during bosses. We got up to twin emps and two bosses in Naxx.
---
No one is forcing him to stream the game. He could retire today and live happily.
---
&gt; What will we do if a month into Classic, all of the Phase 1 endgame raid content is cleared?.
---
That will 100% guaranteed happen. It will be clearad in week 2.
---
U mad bro?
---
&gt; What benefit does that serve? None 
---
I love this game
---
This is literally me everytime I have access to pen a paper.
---
&gt; But you just deemed owning two accounts as cheating 
---
No i didn't. I said using 2 accounts to gain an unfair advantage is cheating.
---
&gt;you set the rules and determine what is considered cheating?
---
Millions *
---
Oh god. OH FUCK!
---
Imagine making a post because you need to see other people who agree with you in order to reinforce your own decisions.
---
Streamers are doing SM because there's way too many people questing in the 30-40 zones.
---
Lots of people are questing and not stepping foot into SM. STV, Shimmering Flats, and Desolace are crawling with people.
---
Just because the *streamers* that you watch are only running SM does not mean people are only running SM.
---
The game was released 15 years ago but has not been playable sense the day BC launched. They want beta because they want to play now. Also the artifical level limit is introducing a type of play that will never happen again. If you weren't in beta you will never experience a WoW where the cap level was 30.
---
As for some backstory, I mained a dwarf hunter in Vanilla. Later on toward the beginning of the BC, I made a human warrior tank to have a more important role in groups. And then at the start of Cata, I roled a human priest.
---
I've had the constant battle with myself in choosing between playing a Warrior tank or a Priest healer again for Classic. I may end up doing both, but I have made my final decision with this occurence and will be sticking to Dwarf Priest healer!
---
As a person who is a fan of the possibilities of post-Naxx content....I'm kind of OK with this idea.
---
We're definitely putting the cart before the horse here.
---
That being said, if post-Naxx content is something that Blizz is wanting to actively gauge interest in, then waiting till Naxx is out is probably waiting too long. They'd need a large amount of time to not only develop the content, but make sure it remains true to vanilla gameplay and style.
---
that isle wasnt a mmorpg, that was a theme park, disney. I hated it.
---
Well I would define stream-sniping as using the feed to find out the location of the streamer to gank them.
---
Anything beyond that requires specific clarification otherwise I wouldn't assume it is anything more.
---
I'm not a big fan of having a single person on the server that controls a mob of fanatics. I haven't watched Asmongold much lately but consider if he had actually managed to get that black dragon into Undercity - having that much manpower and a financial incentive to entertain will lead to entire areas of the game being completely shut down on a regular basis during their streaming hours. Every world event will become even more of a clusterfuck as the streamer finds some sort of chaos to sew that can only be done with multiple raids of people. 
---
Not a fan of having to deal with that if possible.
---
I had no interest in ganking  streamers but now I do
---
Not really that either. Soda stopped streaming for months because he wanted to play Vanilla, TBC, Wrath etc. and you aren't allowed to stream private servers. He doesn't need the money or the attention, otherwise he would have kept streaming., He owns multiple houses and rents them out. His income comes regardless of streaming these days as well.
---
He definitely acts like a bitch sometimes, but not streaming isn't the answer either. All of his friends are streamers and would be streaming anyway. He will end up on someone else's stream and either hunted because they found him out or hunted as a result of being near his friends who are the targets.
---
I'm not saying it's right for him to cry like he's doing, I certainly don't want to be on a server with any streamers, but it's also a bitch move to stream snipe people. The problem is you don't know when someone is stream sniping more than half the time, so a lot of innocent people would be caught up in any punishments related to it. But anyone actually stream sniping or defending it is just as bad if not worse, it's a completely garbage thing to do. It's fine if you want to corpse camp a random person for days, but watching their stream to see where they are about to rez and making it literally impossible for them to even have a chance to get away is the dumbest shit.
---
Nobody on either side of this argument is right or coming out on top, everyone is a piece of shit for promoting stream sniping and so is everyone trying to punish the people who do since half of them would be innocent is a piece of shit too.
---
I may try, thanks for the heads up.
---
&gt;I dont even understand what you're asking? I have no control over who i play with
---
Hahaha wow, well you struggling to follow the conversation is nothing new, but that's a funny line.
---
Source??
---
Our boomkins/ret paladins/prot paladins would put on their heal gear and heal in raids. They'd just go do the boomy thing between raids.
---
Streamers aren’t doing sm cuz it’s the fastest they’re doing it because it’s brainless easy and then can do it while streaming with no effort.
---
Trying to figure out quests in unfamiliar zones would be horrible when you’re also trying to entertain.
---
Not an argument, ill take it as you found an error in your own logic
---
Funny part about all this is him saying this will only bring more snipers LULW
---
great post, but we are definitely going to be seeing tons of shitters thinking they are the next 'LITERAL RET GOD' or some bullshit like they think theyre all of a sudden are going to "figure out" something new about the class lol its a 15 yr old game these things have been figured out.
---
He doesn’t give a shit about that. More views is more money, and that’s that.
---
Just gonna get my BIS and tier sets. Thanks for the invite, but your starting to be as rapid as their fans in terms of magnitude, but in the opposite direction.
---
It’s a reasonably defense to inevitable steam sniping.
---
I like that.  Couldn’t some skill be measured in buff uptime?
---
what sort of fucking mong says "omegalul"? cringe
---
That sounds like an interesting spec. Anyone have more details on how that one works?
---
Cause and effect.
---
barmans shanker then world pvp is my first major goal (rogue)
---
Private server meta considered dungeon farming a poor way to gain xp so I think it's worth testing regardless.
---
Not to mention leveling in vanilla has no structure other than "get xp" so it's not against the spirit so to speak.
---
Cheating: Create, use, offer, promote, advertise, make available and/or distribute the following or assist therein: 
---
*any code and/or software, not expressly authorized by Blizzard, that can be used in connection with the Platform and/or any component or feature thereof which changes and/or facilitates the gameplay or other functionality* 
---
This can include streams to gain information you would not otherwise have. (3rd party software) And the last sentence especially, you are using streams to changes gameplay/other functionality
---
and 
---
* Disruption / Harassment: Engage in any conduct intended to disrupt or diminish the game experience for other players, or disrupt operation of Blizzard’s Platform in any way, including:

Harassment, “griefing,” abusive behavior or chat, conduct intended to unreasonably undermine or disrupt the Game experiences of others, deliberate inactivity or disconnecting, and/or any other activity which violates Blizzard’s Code of Conduct or In-Game Policies.*
---
Like i said its not specifically stated but you could argue stream sniping is used to gain 3rd party information you would not really have otherwise.
---
So i guess it depends on you interpreted it. i would say it can be considered using 3rd party software to get "enemy location" just like any other map hacks etc
---
Playing on a pserver has been 10,000% more social than retail.
---
There is a chain quest to his right to kill troggs to the east after that then there is nothing lol
---
Take everything people say about classes in classic with an industrial shipment of salt.
---
Were some classes *better* than others at certain jobs. Yes, there will always be a class that's *best* at a role, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't play it. Most of the talk about what's viable and what's not is from people who've spent years and years playing private/free servers of vanilla and min maxing to the exact specification for each class.
---
Is ret the best melee Dps, no, but it's not a detriment to the group and can still bless friendlies and judge bosses while doing decent Dps. Is prot the best tank? Prot isn't the best, but with the right gear can be extremely useful for aoe pulls in places like MC, BWL and AQ. And Holy isnt as purely strong output wise as a priest, but it's no joke at all.
---
Play what you wanna play, there are going to be enough people at end game that being super elitist about who gets taken where will stop mattering once they realize the content isn't actually as mythologicaly hard as it's all puffed up to be.

You still can’t prove in most cases that someone is stream sniping. I don’t care if you think stram sniping is cheating or not. We’re discussing the fact that streamers are yelling stream snipers over getting ganked once or a few times and the fact that you hardly can prove it, in most cases.
---
&gt; one suggestion made by crendor for retail is to remove the instant teleport to dungeons and raids if you que up insted you need to travel there and summon people. 
---
Why? What experience are you trying to add to the game by doing this? 
---
&gt; that barrier makes the people asking should you kick X actually think if they should insted of blindly agreeing.
---
I've been playing this game for a looooooong time. That very rarely happens. 
---
And it isn't that easy to kick someone anyway. 15mins have to pass before you can even start and then three of four (the guy getting kicked doesn't get a say) have to agree to kick. 
---
&gt; a great thing about classic that isn't obvious is that it uses downtime in a really effectiv matter. there are some many lessions of the effects classics systems you could write a book about for game design.
---
Streamers didn't get invited to test shit. Streamers got invited so the millions of people that didn't get invited have something to watch and get hype on. Blizzard would not have gone out of their way to invite a bunch of people with zero classic experience so they can test.
---
You won't encounter a streamer much. However, you encounter their fans all the time - as there're hundreds of. I wouldn't expect to easily kill someone who's protected by an army of fans.
---
Also, they'll get a lot of stuff (like gold and epics and AQ mount) just because they're popular, which is annoying.
---
&gt;There were KOS lists in wow before, and people got camped all the time. You know what you would do? Log off, or go on an alt until time passes and people got bored.
---
Back in MoP there was a guild formed on the opposite faction that did nothing but camp Soda every waking hour, on or off stream, as soon as they had the opportunity. Literally 24/7 for months. All he could do was queue arena and BGs, as soon as he got out, he'd be attacked/killed before he got into another Arena/BG. It's easy to say just get over it.
---
How is this possible though? What is the solution? Streamers are going to stream and people will follow them. I agree it’s shit and I personally would prefer it not happening but equally what can be done?
---
Itd have to be The Brothers Tauren

Can you see when we joined?  Any flare for early joiners? :P
---
classicdb.ch ?
---
Yup keep in mind to the major streamers all intend on being on the same server. So avoiding them will be as simple as selecting a different server. Try to tell them that though. You'll have a full order of tendies chucked at your head before you hear them screeching at their mom to bring more.
---
^^ People will be paying 7.50 to reserve a name and wait 1/2 a month.
---
Don't be dense.
---
Because you are using a third party social media service to find that location. Fucking lame.
---
Ideally, everyone who likes a streamer plays on the same server as he does, while everyone else plays on another server.
---
In practice, idk what's going to happen.
---
So easy compared to really easy?
---
CHARGING BOOMKIN
---
No, I'm confused with the point you're attempting to make, I fail to see why it would be relevant. But go ahead, maybe then I can connect the dots.
---
Was a real good rogue on our server Rank14 BWL gear, Niar Turalyon Eu, he was hunted and hated best pvper on our server by far.
---
He's gonna be followed around by his viewers at all times so good luck with that.
---
No no, its all there, the picture, the description, its a proper fantasy revelation

Question for you: what are the merits of playing Pally in vanilla? I’ve always liked Raiding and PvP equally and I’ve heard that Pally’s are basically useless in vanilla end game on both ends.
---
I only played pally from BC on, so your opinion on it would be much appreciated.
---
Ok ill wait while you reread.
---
Exactly....
---
On your first character it is often recommended to go double gathering. Then drop your least favorite at 60 for one that offers character benefits (BoP items/situational items/etc).     
---
As for inventory, I'd use your first incomes to buy more bugs (vendor or otherwise). It will pay for itself.
---
Yes it is.  Vanilla was capped to 3k concurrent players per server.
---
🤣👍
---
I vote you roll horde. Play priest and follow me around spamming dispel magic. Tell your wife to buy you cards to support that idea...
---
I think there are legitimate problems with blacklisting stream snipers completely, but OP you made some pretty terrible arguments. 
---
Stream sniping is not a “perk” of viewers. Many games ban this behavior if abused. It’s almost never intentional that a game has the ability to stream snipe, they constantly work to help prevent it. There’s also a massive difference between camping a player and stream sniping them. One is playing the game, the other is using a third party site to “cheat”. It’s really that simple and has little difference to wall hacks or similar programs. A streamer makes their location public, but they do not consent to stream sniping any different than somebody not consenting to a third party program tracking their location in-game. I’m fairly certain that the idea behind using twitch to find somebody and kill them in WoW could be determined to be against the TOS resulting in a ban.
---
However stream sniping can be incredibly hard to determine and prove. It opens up the opportunity for streamers to abuse their influence and wrongfully assume somebody stream sniped and get them banned. But if Blizz or any game has solid evidence that a player is stream sniping then I see no reason why it would not be ok to ban them
---
If you look up Kristen and Danny you can watch her outrageous Christian family vlogging. I learned about it from Bert “the machine” kreisher
---
Shit I don't even know what the chat is talking about, ever. I just hide the chat.
---
Was that on a private server? The drop rates etc probably aren't correct.
---
How about we blacklist streamers who are entitled crybabies? 100g for whoever relentlessly ganks a crybaby streamer! We could have serverwide events and tournaments!
---
Our squad created a google spreadsheet in which we can all prepare for launch. Content includes what we intend on playing, leveling guides, addons/macros, etc
---
Going to be an interesting time ahead of us
---
&gt; I don't see any gameplay benefit.
---
There isn't one. It was primarily designed as a time sink and also because "that's how MMOs did it". 
---
Blizzard took the template from other MMOs, added some Warcraft flavor and gave it to the players.
---
But yea, it's a great time sink because they didn't really have a lot of endgame content available when the game first came out. So rationing out good gear, good leveling spots, and XP was paramount.
---
I feel you on the openess of zones. I hate Dun'Morough but LOVE Mulgore.
---
LOL
---
So he reported it?
---
Its not just streamers in the game. We shouldn't assume there aren't people actually questing.
---
Then why are they still running sm? That shits boring now. New content is open. That’s far more interesting.
---
"That desert place from Star Wars."
---
Try symmetry wow
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/9792650621 it's old, but there is blue confirmation.
---
Because they aren't an "enemy". They are just another person playing the game. Sure see a horde/alli go kill them, but know that you are doing it because it's fun, not because you need some kind of tactical advantage in this war. You don't need to watch a stream and be like "LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION THEY ARE GIVING ME, THEY MAKE IT TOO EASY!" Just be normal FFS. Now if you ran across a streamer on accident, sure go kill him. Once, twice, three times I don't give a shit. But camping someone specifically for hours on end BECAUSE they are a streamer is fucking lame.
---
It's a whole different game, for sure.  On PvE servers, you get to play WoW either as a fun single-player/co-op experience (without forced PvP) or as a nail-biting, always-under-threat action PvP game, and switch between the two at any time.
---
As someone who enjoys satisfying single-player games AND PvP games, I like that I'll be able to switch between the two at will while still playing WoW.  I'm surprised you don't see the benefit in that.
---
Seriously, I’m picking pve server this time around because *i don’t want to deal with gankers* and there is no shame in that
---
The difference here is that streamer influence has grown substantially over the years.. especially since cross server was first introduced lol
---
There isn't even a slight comparison.  The bottom line is that he is talking about colluding with the opposing faction to black list people ganking him (too much?) and makes it sound like he is going to assume all ganks are snipers.  Blizzard had rules against cross faction collusion for a reason. 
---
Now... whether or not Blizzard will maintain these olds rules is another story.  After all soda, however deplorable his stance is, does have a bit of a point; money is made by keeping big streamers on board.  The question is whether or not it is worth their reputation for a bit of extra short term sub money.  Sadly, corporations don't care about their rep all that much now days since controversy keeps making them money anyway. 
---
Bottom line is that soda wants his job to be easier at the expense of other people.
---
Tailoring and engineering are the only two professions that would give you a real benefit that you can't buy. You kind of need money too though, so double gather or at least one gather are decent options.
---
I have a prediction that everyone and their mother is going to be mining and it's going to be awful at release.  I don't have much more to ads beyond that.
---
Sorry, thought it was obvious but you do this when you're Lv60 or close to it :) Yes you have a different name and the ??, but when's the last time you checked the details of each and every quest mob in a group - particularly with the added stresses of STV? I played this trick a few times and the only time it failed me is when nobody came along at all.
---
How can I become that one person?
---
Want stuff and people call you a loot whore. Stream while wanting stuff and you are a god!

IMAGINE IMAGINING
---
You're right, you can't make me think streamers are owed any special privileges in moderation.
---
the idea is so hillariously narcissistic that I can't help but laugh at it.
---
Oh please.
---
Pvping is not "griefing". If you sign up to a pvp realm you can't be upset at getting ganked over and over. If you are getting ganked there are ways around it. Hearth and get to a different zone to quest.
---
I made the comparison to show that in cs you are signing up to go into a server vs someone better than you and getting owned. You can leave, you can play elsewhere.
---
In wow you are staying in the same zone getting ganked over and over, not by someone "better" but by someone higher level. You are choosing to be there. You can spirit rez, and hearth, and get out of there. I did not equivocate skill in cs to being higher level. I equivocated the fact that you are choosing to be in a pvp realm 
---
Understand?
---
What faction is he going to be on?
---
I can’t tell if your dense or just have a hard on for streamers. Even when people go out of their way to be assholes, which i’d bet you would think someone camping you for hours is, you still can’t prove they’re stream sniping you, unless you set up these random ass scenarios where you find them randomly in stealth.
---
If Asmongold levels in STV and gets camped for 5 hours by the same person/group and he just takes breaks and tries to quest all the time, you can’t prove hos guys are stream sniping.
---
Nah if you can turn it off it doesn't work because you can't attack anyone you come across. Nice try tho
---
Rusty short sword

I already made it pretty clear in my previous post.  If non-subs were able to claim names, there would be thousands of names claimed by people that will never actually play the game on those characters.

Who the fuck is sodapoppin? I consume alot of game/blizzard YouTube and media and never one heard of this guy. Why would ppl care what one dude says?
---
I feel like so many people have absolutely no idea and just sort of flip a mental coin when confronted with one of these words (your / you're, their / there / they're, its / it's, etc.).
---
Ok, but this didn't happen cross faction lol....  
---
If anything, the opposite was true.  If a guy on your faction camped horde all day long, he was usually someone people wanted to group with because his name was known one way or the other.
---
I suspect soda knows this, which is why he is resorting to collude with other streamers and their followers to force this list to work.
---
Its more for the lack of authentication and classic server realism
---
Streaming wasnt a thing back then
---
So you didnt need to worry about a realm to be completely dominated by the streamers viewer population
---
Whatever realm asmongold joins will be an alliance dominated server
---
Vice versa for Soniidigital all horde dominate.
---
Hopefully the all the mainstreamers go to the same realm so theres some level of balance population
---
But on the flipside whether your a big or small streamer if you kill a streamer in wow its bannable and consider stream sniping.
---
Same with having your viewers gank and camp some poor soul. Bannable, but back in the day It was just putting a bounty on a persons head.
---
So ill be avoiding streamer realms cause i want authentic experience.
---
So was wow. Most people at the time thought of wow as the pinnacle of "loser" and video game addiction media centered around it.
---
So time to start a list of who's reserving what streamers name on what server before they can?
---
What’s hilarious is a guild likely called blacklist is going to own his stream to the point of rerolling pve most likely. Have fun trying pvp with a viewer count above 30k.
---
Well - I'm going to roll on a PVE server for one. I figure that'll cut down a bit - PVE Overworld Streams won't be nearly as popular. NASCAR viewers are waiting for a crash - Stream Watchers are waiting for a Stream Snipe. I'd wager the PVE servers will have streamer "celebrities" in the top raiding guilds with a good size following but  I doubt it'll be more then a large guild's worth.   
---
I can deal with a few raids. I can't deal with 25% of the faction's population.
---
&gt; Probably because in Mythic+, a wipe or two means you've failed the timer and completing it is nearly pointless.
---
Depends on how high you're trying to push the key. A couple of wipes will not ruin the timer for your average mythic+ run.
---
&gt;unless you set up these random ass scenarios where you find them randomly in stealth
---
So wait, you mean there are situations in which you CAN prove they are stream sniping? Ok, thanks for agreeing with me.
---
In situations where you can't, but they're being completely toxic assholes, it's not actually relevant weather they are or not.
---
You shouldn't have had to say it, but I'm glad you did.
---
lol alright bruh whatever you say.
---
I don't see it as any more lame than camping someone because they are from a specific guild. which also isn't handled by GMs (I hope.)
---

---
I don't think this is a profit game release. This is a reach for players to come back. 
---
They lost 9+ million players since wrath. This is the only way they can claw back. If this succeeds, blizz can rethink their whole strategy when it comes to future development. 
---
If this fails, blizz is going to be in a tough position.
---
So because you already have a dwarf priest, you're going Human Warrior?
---
Even if the server was full you could still create a character, granted you hadn’t reached your allotted limit..theeeen you’d chill in a queue until it was your turn to finally enter the game.
---
Success almost always goes to peoples' heads.  
---
He lives a cushy life sitting on his butt playing video games, but wants the best of both worlds... and at the expense of other people not only on his server, but the entire game, because of this crap actually ends up becoming the norm on a few servers, then it is going to spread.  
---
Eh, doubt this will work though.  If Blizzard actually sticks to their guns (probably not), then they should be punishing people for publicly colluding with the opposing faction to punish people for PvP actions.
---
Im an Aussie, and hopefully we have Aussie servers this time around (actual AU ones, not US ones labeled Oceanic).
---
But the fucking entitled opinions coming out from a few streamers I've flicked between (Soda, Asmongoloid, Esfand and Cdew) makes me want to drop an alt on whatever server they're deciding on and just grief the shit out of them.
---
They're the ones stupid enough to broadcast their position for money.
---
Because that's what it is at the end of day.
---
Broadcasting their gameplay of WoW for money.
---
I didint get the joke can you explain english is not my native language
---
For sure! I remember seeing that message when the AQ gates were opened
---
I don't think there will be a single bugged quest to be honest. There're still mechanical bugs to be discovered, with spells, maybe specific mobs, but quests? They're just database values + simple scripts, what can go wrong.
---
I don’t expect Blizzard to do anything about it. I’m hoping streamers will regulate themselves so everyone can co-exist in peace.
---
Day 1 is going to be chaos regardless if you have a streamer or not. I’m rolling with 30+ other friends, so if we realize a massive streamer rolled on our same server, there’s no way I can talk all others to re-roll on a different server after maybe even getting to level 10. I’m just hoping that major streamers will come out and say that they are rolling on X server, but somehow that makes me an egotistical jackass here.
