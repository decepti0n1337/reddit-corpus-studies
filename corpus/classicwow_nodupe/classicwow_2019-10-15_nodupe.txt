If someone is providing bag-crafting services for tips (using your mats), what is an appropriate tip?  Is it based on like 15-20-25-30% for the restaurant industry (based on what the mats/bag go for on the AH)?  Or is there an in-game scale that is deemed appropriate?
---

---
I understand it's a "tip" but what is recommended/acceptable/the norm?
---
---
---
[removed]
---
"pretty much confirmed" ... "not sure if they will do it" ... 
---
Yep, totally confirmed... /s
---
Fury Warrior
---
I would stick to what you're already doing assuming you're having a good time from what you're saying. The grass isn't always greener on the other side.
---
You guys still have the option to spend more and take up a bag slot...
---
It’s not bad at all with an ok group, at least at low levels. Just finished a deadmines run without it and it was smooth as butter. Just keep ‘taunting’ with your judgement and body pull with ret aura. Had to have our Druid off tank on some pulls that got out of hand but I can off heal pretty well so it was actually fun.
---
At least he’s doing it at the beginning rather than right before the end? I got ganked one time right after the final wave of the robot chicken escort quest in feralas and I about broke my monitor.
---
Horde Warrior on Sulfuras (open to rerolling class/realm for the right guild). Currently level 54. Open to tanking or dpsing on the war, or any role if I reroll.
---
Looking for a guild to raid, run dungeons, and pvp with in a fun, relaxed environment. Available M,W,F,Sa evenings and weekend days. Ideal guild would be able to be efficient during raids (members expected to show up on time, keep coms clear during fights), but have fun and joke around during downtime and out-of-raid hours. I can be raid ready in a week or two on the war or about 6 weeks if I reroll, but I'm not in a rush. I want to see all raid content eventually and have fun pvping, but don't care about server firsts or speed runs or anything along those lines.
---
&gt; I have a question too wise one. I play warrior and I’m casual. I plan to get to 60 a month or so from now if I’m lucky. I want to tank, but will I be too late to the game?
---
Nah you'll be fine, Reddit may be full of people posting their 60's getting epic mounts or raiding MC, but from what I've seen the majority of the playerbase isn't anywhere near there. 
---
Add to the fact that tanks are among the most desirable role in dungeons, and you'll have absolutely no trouble finding groups.
---
&gt;Also I’m back from playing vanilla when I was like an 11 yo mess around player. Think groups would be willing to help me learn or should I just start with dps?
---
People will always be there to help and offer advice, the classic community is really helpful. Just let people know you're new to whatever role, and if they have feedback to let you know what you can improve. 
---
That being said, you will find arrogant assholes or people that flame you for being new and asking questions, but in general these people are completely toxic and you should avoid them if you can.
---
don't worry, even if you'd be a veteran pvp-er, you'd still be endlessly farmed.
---
Thank you for the info. I’ll have to look up the stance specific macros.
---
alliance
---
Someone never took a statistics class I see.
---
I used this strategy to get a deadmines group and it was easy as pie and everyone was chill. 10/10 would self deprecate again
---
DWing doesn't help flurry uptime, however, as offhand swings consume charges.
---
Because they itemize differently, its easier to maintain a very high critrate as slamspec, which does translate into more flurry uptime. DW's primary advantage is the extra base damage and rage generation.
---
Pretty sure that’s him placing a filler comment so he can check back later and see if someone answered. Get over yourself
---
Is there a way to disable repeatable quests on Questie addon from showing up in the map?
---
Grey enemies (10+ levels below) don’t count as HK’s so at least that will mitigate some of the lowbie slaughter
---
I wish I could have stayed fire
---
I just get ancy when it's not organized
---
That's literally never happened to me unless I was moving or turning when I use it. If you *are* moving or turning then there won't be an animation and you won't drop combat but you'll still drop threat.
---
Where else do you LFG???
---
I disagree.
---
Man those shaman totem quests were some of my favorite experiences in WoW to this day. I decided to roll priest this time but might alt roll a shaman. If BC comes after this, I had always wanted to roll a Dreanai for BC, could get that chance this time around
---
post to /r/roastme as well
---
There is when one of them is aimed primarily at children about 10 years old.
---
Anyone know a general price for Taran Icebreaker. Just got the world drop but imagine it's not too pricey.

Pretty much in controlled situations all top DPS rotations are just as easy and boring as the rogues. The best rotation for dagger DPS just changes the opener to ambush from garrote and then SS for BS
---
A crit - &gt; parry hasted crit is just as likely to kill a warrior, there's 0 reason to be crit capped on a warrior with double shield block charges, and any warrior who needs that to survive is not playing at a level where the tank choice is the limiting factor.
---
Not to mention the fact that you can literally armor cap a bear right now, meaning that double crit in 1 second (parry haste gives at most 40% speed up, so minimum of 1 second between swings) is barely even doing 50% of the tanks health.
---
A bear is a better choice right now, with exceptions being doggie in MC where frenzy and double attackspeed (both heads "melee" actually can lead to a ~70% HP 2xcrit) and Nefarian.
---
Not to mention that consistent damage is a lot easier to heal, and more threat means bosses dies quicker with less randomness (fury warrior gets sick opener? Well guess you're down a few melees).
---
Druid is a great tank right now, just don't try aoe tanking on them, they'll melt.
---
Demonshear is solid on a paladin. Yes you want to stick to swords or maces if you can help it the weapon skill adds quite a bit of +hit for free.
---
I had a Priest the other night who said that although healing chaotic groups was fun it's nice to have a tank that knows what he's doing and doesn't need much healing.
---
I offered to take off my shield to make things more interesting for him. He declined.
---
And, omg, getting the Aegis of the Scarlet Commander was awful. It took 15 runs and I lost the shield 3 times to other warriors and a shaman. I just wanted the best shield available for a long time that would let me to continue to tank with ease.
---
Nah we love Thrall, why would we want to overthrow him?
---
For most servers it’s only going to suck for alliance.  Some of the servers are so lopsided it’s absurd.  The worst thing for horde is going to be “I can’t find anyone to kill” because the alliance all moved to the 2-4 non super horde servers.
---
Thanks! Makes sense especially compared to, like OP explained, Dwarf.
---
I’m actually really surprised that Blizz never did a chariot mount... They have a lot of brainpower there, they must’ve had a good reason...
---
You're kinda right, you can go whatever you want and clear content, it is classic after all. The spec I mentioned is objectively the best single target dps spec though, but i'm not even using it because I prefer being able to farm dungeons and shit.
---
It's probably due to raid spec being one of the most boring specs for a mage, i cant wait to go pvp spec in phase 3
---
Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games
---
You cast faster if you press the keybind once before the spell ends, the exact timing changes on your latency. I haven't seen this discussed in years,  but you can find old threads about it on elitist jerks in the internet archives. Spamming the button makes you cast slightly slower.
---
Really though, it’s just gonna change time spent drinking to time spent conjuring stacks 2 at a time.
---
Before the census tools broke, that was a good way to look at raw numbers for each server and find a relative balance. I rolled on Kirtonos for similar reasons but I ran Horde instead. I’m not sure if those tools still work though. You may be able to find old census data from before it stopped but the balance for factions has surely changed on some servers since then. Best of luck finding your server!
---
Like the other comment says, rivenspike and bone slicing hatchet is better than the options, purely because of wep skill.
---
It might actually give you more dps to go edgemasters and Dal'Rends, but at that point just buy the axes instead.
---
This is the correct perspective. I think the person you replied to basically meant this.
---
The items and gold transfer can be a potential issue. But I personally liked starting back at square one with my alt. Felt more genuine to work my way back up, instead of being constantly funded by my main. And you are forced to build new connections and friendships as well. It is like removing the crutches of having a high level character and high level connections. Feels more like starting the game new, rather than just starting a character new.
---
Cool! I forget that Cloak of Shadows isn't in Classic
---
&gt;Don't bitch on the forums, crap like this is what created the casual monster we have in live.
---
Hardly the same lol.
---
Enchanting your cloak with +3 agility and then having your 10% crit buff removed is just plain bad design. There's nothing interesting about this.
---
I think Classic+ is a pipe dream, we don't even have a toggle option for the high-res character models or any later upgrades in Classic, and Blizzard has specifically stated they're not even going to have a full compliment of responsive GM services, much less concurrent development for what's financially the equivalent of a second MMO. I'm fairly convinced that they'll do BC and Wrath servers at least, but literally going for a secondary fork of the established lore is completely out of the question. They've maintained, less a few abnormalities and retcons, a consistent story through more than two decades of games. They're not going to go back and shove ogres in edgewise to supplement a revisiting of a previous version of a game that's still going.
---
Jesus christ.
---
:D
---
How long should it take me to go from 20-30? I realize leveling is slow in this game but I'm currently at 23 and I feel like it takes me 4-5 hours to level up which I feel like is slower than average but I don't know. 
---
Part of it is I don't know where to quest. The barrens are pretty much tapped out of quest I can actually complete and I've done the easy quests in stone talon but now I'm stuck fighting harpies and centaurs. Should I just grind out mobs?
---
I (58 alliance hunter) just came flying to chillwind camp only to discover a priest (58) and mage (60) standing at the crossroads. Naturally I stard viper-kiting them both, but the priest was distracted healing the mage to notice that he had no shield and no mana. I pop bestial wrath and intimidation and kited the mage trying ti reach me. Both end up dead and I dtand there with 100% hp.
---
Should have rolled horde
---
RNGesus moves in mysterious ways.
---
Tl;Dr: yu don fukt up somwer.
---
Ive been everywhere man Ive been everywhere....
---
Private servers had no combat drop for this as their own balance change.
---
Of course it's a dwarf. Not exaggerating when I say that 80% of the allies who ganked me from 1-60 were dwarves. All dwarves are now on my KoS List.
---
I did a lower level dungeon with a higher level tank in full pre raid BiS and it went smoothly.  Obviously that player was skilled unlike these shield wearing swine mucking around the bottom of the DPS charts.
---
Yikes dawg, enjoy your mediocrity. You can't even form a well thought out rebuttal and instead resort to cheeky comebacks, how pathetic.
---
This happened to me during my first devilsaur kill. I was level 54 and it was a tense battle. Healing my pet with bandages after using scare beast, watching my doggo die before my very eyes. I got the beast to around 10% health and managed to kite it and kill it. Atlast, after many failures, my first devilsaur skin and kill. Just as i went in for the skin i got stunned out of nowhere and my prize was robbed from me. Now you're thinking, what did i learn from this ordeal. It's simple really.... use the spy addon.
---
You *overlevel*  on mobs, believe it or not, jail.
---
Yeah, I figured that as well (given the unique ID and everything).
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah that abbreviation also left me with a huh
---
My experience with people that are very vocal about what everyone else is doing wrong is that they are not nearly as good as they imagine.
---
The people that post logs despite no one asking are normally the ones that are the worst for this.

Said as you play their games 8 hours a day.
---
Do you have a link?  Not saying you are wrong but this does go against the top end caster meta.  Also, if you for example, have a skinning macro and you put it on key vs scroll wheel, scroll wheel comes out ahead every time even at higher pings.  Have actually tested this on classic.
---
Why does it seem like so many people think it's impossible to have a bad tank? I mean not even bad though, either. When I run with an amazing tank I know it because I can open up right away and not pull aggro. If the tank isn't as good I have to FD. There are definitely noticeable skill levels in tanking.
---
I would just do your attunements if it happens to drop so be it. Work on the rest of your gear and if you have everything else go for it but the MH is super rare.
---
Update: now a level 50 Undead Priest. Still on Whitemane. Blessings to you, heroes.
---
im glad he used the term false dichotomy. made me research what it was. learning something new is always sweet.
---
&gt;holy shitton
---
nope

Mine is "Druid LF MC/Ony. Any roll. Let me take all the gear no one else wants."
---
Times change.
---
*sap*
---
There is still world pvp on pve servers, you just have to opt in. This leads to big fights like tarren mill VS south shore, which I think is much more fun than random ganking.
---
taking a look at shadowpanther right now, is this taking into account the set bonus from dal rend's too?
---
wont change
---
As we were about to skip the boss I quickly looked up the loot table and realized the necklace is really good for warlocks. I asked our warlock if it is his BiS and when he said yeah, I said that we should do the boss. When I didn't get any answer from the tank after some time I asked him specifically again and he said "nope", because it takes him too long to clear the trash around the boss. 
---
I personally don't support antisocial behaviour like this at all and told him that it is his decision, either we do the boss or he can forget it. Group disbanded after this.
---
What's your current setup?
---
Sup homies. Know anything about lengthy felines?
---
It's pretty easily "tested" as well being a rogue while leveling.
---
There's a very noticable difference in how many charges of Instant Poison remain vs. Mainhand while chaning offhand weapon speeds, right down to sub-1.5 speed daggers running out of charges just as, if not faster, than mainhand (with sinister strike).
---
My current questions though are: "What is the true proc rate of Sword Spec (is it actually 5%?) and what is the proc rate of 6-piece Shadowcraft energy proc?"
---
I think you're missing more than teeth, Joe.
---
I grouped with a fire spec today to take down the big bat and the fat bug in plague, he did some pretty sick damage tbh.
---
What did they nerf about being in a group with a 60 to level? What did they change?
---
Have you tried turning it on and off again?
---
Bats in EPL drop lots of stackable grays which vendor nice. Can weave them into a professions route too.
---
Currently playing alliance, I don't like how the horde cities and the areas surrounding the major cities look and that was a turn off for me. You could totally have fun and if you enjoy leveling I would say go for it. I only say that because if you're looking for a different end game experience from one side or the other you probably won't find it. If you're doing it just to try something different and get more lore and see different quests and all the other stuff that comes from another faction go for it.
---
Does it show drop rate?
---
The best for casters is the dagger from library. Which I am going to be rocking until Dire Maul. So it sucks for everyone.
---
That Hunter pets can tank better than every class besides warriors
---
Good thing it only takes 2-3 shots to kill someone (as I've experienced several).
---
When I lost my SGC to a hunter who said he didn't need it.
---
Name me 1 escort quest that doesn’t tbh.
---
Lol you’re funny little guy. Horde are cowards through and through it’s almost laughable that they try to place such a high emphasis on honor.  Also, are you stalking me or something? How do you know I come here to “complain and bitch” every day? Fucking creep.
---
It was abbreviated to VC in Vanilla since Alliance players would get a quest to kill Van Cleef a lot earlier than the dungeon was mentioned.
---
Stack spirit and grind mobs, and warrior leveling is pretty breezy, ha.
---
Scholo is just one giant FU to tanks. Many mobs are simply untankable / drop their aggro table at random. There's also the packs that AoE explode on death, the zombies that hit like bulldozers, and let's not forget shades that are only killable with magic, crypt fiends that root you in place along with ghouls that drop AoE poison clouds on death. Then there's at least 4 different types of knock back from various mobs.
---
Last but not least, at least 3 of the bosses randomly drop aggro. 
---
Scholo is like the opposite of a love letter to tanks. It's hate mail.
---
I am so sick of this. I ONLY hear this from players that haven't played private servers (I ask). I ask because when leveling up a few mages on private servers I didn't hear this a single time. They try and make me feel retarded for not wanting to be restricted to constant dungeon runs.
---
Nope.  They would literally transfer the gear to anybody that was on the drop table for the kill.
---
Silithus has the benefit of having few people there, since it doesn't really have anything to do just yet. It also means that anyone out there is there to farm, though.
---
Even still, I remember having good luck with Ooze-Covered Thorium Veins back in vanilla even after the gates opened and the zone had quests.
---
I oftentimes feel that we either spec into "the pvp spec" or just forget it unless we get the drop on someone.
---
In Zul Farrack when your fighting Ghazrilla, fight him with your feet in the water so when he does the knock up you land in the pool and take no damage. Every group so far I’ve talked had their minds blown.
---
That’s mean. Escort quests suck
---
i left silverpine cus i dont really like it and im only 4000/6000 friendly with undercity, will i get screwed some how when it comes to buying mount at 40?
---
When I'm in groups that are rushing and it causes wipes I quite often tell them that rushing will just make it take longer and despite sounding obvious it tends to resonate with people.

You're not anticipating enough. What if in the future you want rolls to have a decimal component? Better to use
---
roll &lt; = n

Yeah, if you want to spend all of your time running the same boring ass dungeon.

Discovering the deeprun tram at like level 7 is literally one of the most deeply ingrained memories of my childhood. Like I once scored a goal in a shootout to go to states as a young kid of similar age playing hockey and I can honestly remember my first deeprun tram ride with more clarity.
---
DPS MUST SEE DPS!1?1? why so big though?
---
What do you mean? Saying that a comment that got 20 downvotes is funny, a controversial yet brave thing to say.

Classic+ would have to be a comic book style "parallel universe" story. But you actually think adding ugly races into retail isn't a pipedream?
---
lol
---
Damn... that sucks
---
Smolderweb alliance are all pussies and never help me out when I’m getting jumped by 2 or more horde.
---
&gt; in the sense that they generally end up taking less overhealing and thus less wasted mana
---
Less overhealing is only less spent mana if you are actually spending less mana compared to sustaining a tank that takes less damage.
---
In reality, a bigger health pool can simply just mean more mana spent sustaining if you're taking more damage overall. The bigger health pool just ends up smoothing out spikes but still requiring a greater load on actual healing.
---
I gotta wait 20 seconds for you to get enough aggro for my aoe to not pull them, so, may as well drink up!
---
"The Lord yeeteth and he yoinketh away."

No you only need honored for discount. You'll be fine.
---
Not sure if this counts but I will post it anyway.
---
If you are trying to keep the princess alive for the quest in BRD but your group is struggling due to level etc you can have a hunter or warlock pet tank her. Have the healer stand up on one of the side platforms somewhere near to the throne, the healer will invariably pull aggro but the princess has to run for \~10 seconds to get to you, at which point you jump down.
---
I did it with a lower level group the other week and it really made the fight a lot easier. Weirdly, I thought of it from the way you would kite the dragonkins on Razorgore in BWL.
---
You are leveling a lot slower than you could be. 
---
Download the addon "questie". Not only will it direct you where to go to pick up quests and direct you to items/mobs that drop items in your zone, you can open the world map and see what quests are available for your level/a custom level range.
---
You'll save loads of time and know where to go then.
---
Yes, even moreso in a premade. It's also pretty frustrating to watch people zoom off before you can repeatedly.
---
I don't understand how to set keybinds to other bars other than the main one. I use Elvui. Anyone know how to do it?
---
That album on the wall is legit btw.

Solo pvping a lot? Mage

Have friends? Priest

I think that happened in the burning crusade so will not happen in classic.

Download Questie addon immediately

I’m level 45 and still had a white hat because rolls haven’t gone my way and I didn’t ever find the time to buy a green hat. I was running ZF yesterday and we were having no issues in running until randomly the tank stops and starts berating me for having a white hat. He even got to the point where he started asking the group lead to kick me....the group lead was like “wtf, we are running through this fine.”
---
We ended up finishing the run, but man that guy was annoying.
---
You can't post your name on here?
---
Probs 20-30 gold if your lucky. Not sure if Paladins want it as I’m on horde side.
---
I'm not an expert on paladin's forgive me but I believe seal of command procs more often on slower weapons. Ret isn't specifically looking for proc weapons but this one just happens to be a good choice for them. I think it was recently believed that spell power from Ret gear would effect the proc of Demonshear but was proven that it doesn't, It's still good though.
---
Northern alterac mountains killing those mages and shit

Gy is south shore. Like a 7 minute run it seems
---
Psh...I am spec'd fire and I typically out AoE frost mages in dungeons anyway...
---
Flame strike &gt; Frost nova &gt; Blastwave &gt; Cone of Cold is an INSANE amount of burst DPS, especially if you throw in Combustion.  Everything is instant cast after the initial Flame Strike and between the bursts and the two chances to crit on a target for the Ignite DoT, there usually isn't much left of the non-elites and then you simply switch to the high damage single-target spells to burn down whatever is left.
---
The only downsides to a fire spec are that Blastwave has a relatively long cool down and the fact that you need a really good tank to be able to contend with the aggro...Well, and the fact that you can't do the early raids since everything is fire immune.
---
Actually yeah wtf lmao
---
Awesome! Love it....I screen shot most my MMO journeys as well and occasionally look through the photos and have fond memorys.
---
You can fight around the corner of ghaz entrance and you won't go flying up into the air as well
---
Wow that's rough man.  And I am glad you filled in some of the details with names of encounters. I wanted my recollection on here to be fresh, as in from what I remember over a decade ago, but man you weren't kidding about AQ.  While Naxx gets blamed for final nail in the coffin, I firmly agree that AQ set the stage for most guilds falling apart.  I agree it relied on people performing specific actions, but I just think when you have so many people, making so many attempts, so many times a night, and so many times a week, a mistake is inevitable and when it happens it just starts to tear at the fabric holding everyone together.
---
Wow that was really nice of him. Was he naked? Lmao
---
Thx for the advice tho xd
---
Why not both? :)
---
Absolutely. The reason being, if you didn’t already know, is that, from what I’ve been told, the proc is limited to 7-8 per minute. So any weapon that is faster will stop procing if you reach that limit.
---
Sometimes this works, other times it takes 5+ seconds to leave combat.
---
&gt; That's not yer fault as tank. Thats yer fault as a 'leader.' 
---
I explain kill order: 💀 ❌ 🟪
---
And when they don't follow it: you don't quit - you keep suffering. You don't abandon a group: that's just a shitty thing to do.
---
&gt; You are judging too much. Once you have threat, you shouldn't be zapping every 10 seconds. It's your fucking taunt.
---
No shit, sherlock.
---
Yea I was talking about solo tributes
---
Well if we really want to start min/maxing here we should just be using an else.
---
If(roll&gt;n){}
---
Else{}
---
In my opinion, remove 1 point from HOTW and throw it in nature's grasp. Really helps with getting melee off of you.
---
Just farm UBRS until you have everything. It will take enough runs to get painweaver band, shadowcraft chest, truestrike shoulders and eye of rend that you'll end up getting one or both of the dal'rends, at which point it is worth farming the other one.
---
&gt; crit - &gt; parry hasted crit
---
But because you literally can't be crit through 2 charges of shield block its not? (single roll table bb)
---
Maybe look into a lock? I switched from a Mage to a lock
---
you're the stupid here not knowing what "just as good" means
---
Thank you!  As for the sad part,  I keep in touch with most of those guildies so in the end it all turned out alright.    
---
And you are definitely right.  If a guild wasn't destroyed slowly but continuously like mine, it happened like the instances you described: with a single event that just causes a domino effect.  Though, I wonder if those single events just allow things that were festering to come out in arguments.
---
Yea maybe. I’ve been in and out of there the last 2-3 weeks. It’s a chill server. Plenty of times just questing next to alliance. I’m trying to hit 60, not waste time in feuds when there’s no honor system.
---
I believe dots may work on cast, but their damage tick does not proc it. I've had the dagger for about 2 weeks on my warlock and warlocks dot a lot.
---
Did they tell that somewhere? Miss it haha
---
If you dont have friends already playing really just pick one that says high or full during prime time on east coast.
---
And thank you for the comment!
---
Yes it's not optimal for solo pvp but in world pvp or AV it's pretty nice to have the sustain from Fel Stamina or if you got a healer on your ass you can just sac a succu for ultimate plague spreading and just see people die left and right.
---
It's cute how you talk like you know any better.
---
I've made 4k from devilsaurs so far and skull is definitely useful for breaking blind and sap.
---
Pop it, skin, blind, remove buff, reskin.
---
If your server isn't dead the enemy faction is always going to be around.
---
Thank you. I will definitely check it out.
---
I can’t tell if you are being sarcastic. That’s such a shitty thing to do. Man I wish dishonor counted towards grey level players.
---
On that note, certain classes have the ability to crowd control like mages and rogues. Mages can get a spell to turn in enemy into a sheep and rogues can sap an opponent into not attacking for a limited time. This can really reduce the amount of damage a warrior takes when pulling an enemy and can conserve a healer's mana.
---
I realize every mage spellcleaved their way to 60 so they probably never learned of this mechanic.
---
Yep, was going to say my +shadow damage definitely makes it seem like my shadow wand damage is increased on my character sheet.  Sad that it's a bug.
---
When you gain aggro, you react often by running away. When you do this, the tank has to run farther to grab aggro back. In the future, run towards the tank.
---
I've run ubrs hundreds of times and did not know that
---
The only frost mages I met while leveling who could keep up with me on DPS needed to be 4-5 levels above me...Once I got into the 55+ dungeons, the only ones who could keep up were level 60 with good gear...Now that I am level 60 with most of my BiS the only ones who can keep up are mostly raid-geared.

It's about how you play...I Flamestrike, run in and Frost Nova, follow that will a Blastwave, and Cone of Cold while retreating.  That initial burst, especially combined with Ignite and/or Cumbustion, absolutely destroys things.  Then, while my ignite damage ticks away, I focus target whatever is low and still alive before moving on to the beefier targets...
---
Meanwhile, the frost mages are still channeling their first Blizzard with only a couple mobs left alive for their slow damage to tick on.
---
Healers aren't invincible 1v1
---
👌  Whatever you say bud
---
I mean, thats all well and good, but I can't be monitoring /new all day, some kind of mod decision would be more effective...
---
Apparently you don't know the difference between movement delay and regular movement. Here I'll go real slow for you. See, you won't actually be moving, but your shitty game says you're moving. See the problem now?
---
A large number of classic players are older and are back for the nostalgia after quitting retail many years ago due to how badly blizz messed up the game having always held vanilla in the highest of regards. We are not Fortnites target market. Sure there are 40 year olds that play Fortnite but it isn't the norm, it's considered a babies game as far as most older gamers are concerned.
---
Thanks.
---
the one's that are just northeast of Everlook.  The ones south of the road coming from felwood are I think the same stuff, but I don't usually farm those ones so I don't know.
---
Interesting. My warrior is just about ready to tank it. I'll have to keep an eye out for these mushrooms this time.
---
Generally you want a pet with the highest dps. I usually go with a cat
---
Efficiency will probably depend on how many mobs are in the pack and if you're able to charge. 
---
Improved sunder is huge- 12 rage per sunder makes it much easier to tab-sunder. Improved bloodrage is also great to have when you're forced to pull instead of charge.
---
Also the 15% increased threat gen while in defensive stance bumps you up to x1.495 threat while in defensive stance
---
Last stand is extra wipe insurance
---
That being said, I can't DPS at all unless I respec. I haven't found it to be an issue, though. I don't really plan on raiding, and it's extremely easy to find a group as a tank so I figured I might as well sit in prot to make my life slightly easier. Even when I was leveling as arms/fury, I think I only DPSed 2 or 3 times. 
---
Once BGs drop, I'll definitely respec to arms/fury.
---
Interesting what does this add on do? I’ll try that
---
This.
---
It shows in the character sheet but doesn’t actually apply.
---
Agi increased wand damage on pservers (bug) for those wondering. Does not work on Classic.
---
Quivers don’t work with wands.(pserver bug)
---
I’m not sure if CoE/CoS increases arcane/shadow fire/frost wands dmg (from -resist or +%dmg)
---
It’s the Underground Bandit Revenge Ship (UBRS).
---
LF Goat, Sy or Minus och Noggenfogger EU! :D
---
How did you get Teremus inside?
---
My bad on the weapon speed. I thought 2.7 was the slowest a one handers got
---
Honestly the pre-raid 1h axe options outside of the epic boe axes are so crappy. Rivenspike's procc doesn't stack with faerie fire so it's really crappy in a raid setting. If you want to be optimal as a fury from a pre-raid perspective you're either gonna have to cough up money for edgemaster's or for the boe axes. 
---
I'd say the best budget option for orc is to get the Dreadforge Retaliator from Emperor and go 2h fury.
---
Nah, that's just him noping the fuck out of there.
---
Maybe you should help your guild more /s
---
It's so you hit harder on your yellow attacks like cleave, whirlwind and bloodthirst for example.
---
Well the core of the "good players" Split oft weeks ago becaus too many mediocre Players good invited and watered Down the Kill Level of the guild if my info's are correct
---
What’s a a WA?
---
Hey you fixed the previously done badly displayed graph and even included images so we could visually see what those distances are, you are a legend
---
That's because I have to switch to zerker stance, lose all of my rage, hit berserker rage, then switch back to defensive stance. This is several seconds of not generating any aggro and now all 6 mobs are hitting my DPS who don't know how to control their threat.
---
Don't worry, there was no CC because it's faster just to AoE them down.
---
Xp per mob is lower but if ur 60 friend know what hes doing the xp/h should definitely be way better
---
Yea because everyone tanks in berserker stance waiting for random stuns.
---
This isn't "ironman" this is just a bunch of rules made up to make this some sort of challenge because you're too afraid to do it the way every single wow Ironman player has ever done it- on a pvp server.  
---
  
---
You should try something harder next time, like beating Stardew Valley.
---
Why stay away from Fairy Tale? Just curious.
---
Mats in general or just enchanting mats
---
A tribute run is in the Ogre section where you dont kill any of bosses other than the king. Doing that gets you a chest at the end with different loot.
---
Some bosses you can straight skip however others need some thought. 
---
For example, the ice trap. fix that and the guard boss will get frozen as he steps on it.
---
It is but normally it's done on a PVP server, this guy was too afraid to do that so instead he made up a bunch of rules, like an ultra long shitty drinking game.
---
This lmao
---
[This is my warlock's current UI](https://i.imgur.com/Ue2jI0K.jpg)
---
Hopefully someone has already answered this, but based upon my understanding of how it works, math for Ret weapons is pretty easy to do yourself.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(Weapon DPS + AP/14) = actual weapon DPS
---
(Weapon DPS + AP/14) \* Weapon Speed = actual damage per swing
---
On the assumption that you have 1000AP self buffed:
---
**Warblade of Caer Darrow**
---
128.84 DPS
---
425 average damage
---
**Demonshear**
---
125.24 DPS
---
475 average damage
---
**Blackhand Doomsaw**
---
125.42 DPS
---
439 average damage
---
**Fist of Omokk**
---
126.93 DPS
---
418 average damage
---
This makes no accounting for the procs on Demonshear or Blackhand Doomsaw, so their actual DPS will be slightly higher- though you'd need to test exactly how much higher. When I had Doomsaw the proc was only around 2-3% of my DPS if I recall correctly, so real DPS is probably around 128.5 DPS or so. Still not as good as Warblade of Caer Darrow. Lets assume that Demonshear adds 1-2%, conservatively and does 127.1.
---
With a proc per minute of \~7 for Seal of Command, each proc doing 70% of weapon damage, we can calculate the approximate damage gained by each weapon:
---
2,082.5‬
---
2,327.5
---
2,151.1‬
---
2,048.2
---
Over a 2 minute encounter:
---
15,460 weapon damage
---
4,165 SoC damage
---
19,625.8 total
---
15,254 weapon damage
---
4,655 SoC damage
---
19,897 total
---
15,420 weapon damage
---
4,302 SoC damage
---
19,722 total
---
15,231.6‬
---
4,096 SoC damage
---
19,327 total
---
Demonshear &gt; Blackhand Doomsaw &gt; Warblade of Caer Darrow &gt;&gt;&gt; Fist of Omokk
---
Some notes:
---
\-The +5 weapon skill for Swords and Maces significantly reduces your hit cap from 9% to 6%. While you're going to want to use Demonshear either way, if you only had Doomsaw and Warblade, Warblade would be better because you're a human.
---
\-This math ignores armor, and in practice Demonshear will much better than the others because it does proportionately more damage through Seal of Command procs.
---
\-While Fist of Omokk is clearly the worst, +STR is very strong on Ret since you gain 10% strength through talents. A proc like on The Untamed Blade is very powerful.
---
\-I've undervalued the proc rate on both Doomsaw and Demonshear. Relative to just white damage, which we're calculating here, the proc could be more like 4-5% of your damage, in which case both of these weapons are much better than the others.
---
I reported this same thing a month ago and a GM didn't take it seriously and gave me a generic reply that closed my ticket.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Also as a tank: let me get threat
---
And yet you act like I'm crazy when I told you that you won't have a problem if you make sure you're standing still when you use it. Weird, it's almost like I know what I'm talking about.
---
Is there still queues in Faerlina? My characters are on this one and I took a break waiting for the queues to drop...
---
overlevel underlevel.  Jail.
---
https://imgur.com/QHSVr1h
---
Yep I only tank for healers I leveled up in dungeons with (and their friends) or my own guildies. Just had force of will ninjad by a mage the other day. Big rip.
---
Pour one out for for the rogues passed over
---
Question, what lvl should a Warrior tank be before entering brd, lbrs and ubrs in your guys opinion?
---
You need to re-align your priorities. The goblin hut nearby has a rod that rejuvenates their health. With such a device, they're granted a second life!
---
Make sure you pick up the Major mana potion recipie from Scholo, there's a quest where you can gain access to a merchant (it's a ghost by scholo) that will sell you the recipie. It's BOP though, and people will be consuming a TON of them come next raid tier.
---
I'm fairly sure you can't get 100% resist even with cap (like 310 or sth?)
---
If you are close enough to sap why not just open cheap shot and get into it. I use sap for resetting fights. Not as an opener though.
---
Ah.  It still won't be coming but yeah, that's the patch we are playing on.  The Phases are just to stagger the release of content.  All balance issues and item issues like that are already in place so what we have is what we get.  That change was made shortly before the burning crusade even though it happened during vanilla it was an end phase transition as tbc was released a few months later.  Also I think you're correct on the patch numbering.  2.0 or 2.1 would be tbc, 3 for wrath etc.
---
Yeah GL getting Teebu
---
I gank anyone I see 10 lvls lower or 10 lvls higher. I roll with a group. Real horde shit
---
Hasn't been relevant in years, ever since the spell queue got implemented. Cast once in the final 0.2-0.4 (it's a setting) of your cast and the next spell is auto queued server side.
---
Pretty sure we are playing some Legion client changed to look like Vanilla.  I'm confident they could have provided that Vanilla client they claimed to have had and given it to the private server community and we would have had a more authentic Vanilla experience.  Anyone who tanked in Vanilla should be able to immediately tell that Classic is not Vanilla, mobs did not auto-correct their positioning in Vanilla, now they are twitchy af to the point you risk pulling another pack just getting your current pack to face you properly.
---
It's insane to me that you just can't comprehend that you're standing still but the game says you're moving.
---
In deadmines you don't have to fight Van Cleef's guards.
---
Have the healer stand on the wheel, he will aggro the guards by healing and they will be unable to reach. Once VC is down you can clean up.
---
Ganking tauren here. You think I'm gonna hit you with the slash wave but actually going for the mortal strike
---
Im talking exclusively about raiding content though. It’s no question Frost is vastly superior to the other two specs at leveling.
---
Fireball gets 100% from your +spelldamage while frostbolt gets 85%. Fireball has an extra rank you can get in AQ so it deals much more damage than frostbolt, and then we have ignite.
---
When enemies stop being immune to fire it pulls ahead of frost.
---
Wow... I will definitely be able to use this post in the future when I get new weapons as well. This is exactly the explanation I was looking for. Thank you so much!
---
Commenting strictly just to see a responce later. I personally use it right after an auto attack because im used to auto attack canceling from LoL.
---
If you are behind the target why would you sap and wait for energy then cheap shot? That is just giving your enemy more reaction / decision making time.
---
I love quests that require a large amount of items that drop several at a time. Feels so much better to progress through them. They are so rare however, i can only think of the spider eyes one for the alliance in dustwallow, and the thermites for a plague upon thee in epl.
---
“He’s RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE!!!”
---
Fire ze missiles!!
---
Scum class
---
Thanks! If we are not in phase 5 or 6 yet, I will buy it.
---
Dal'rends and edgemaster's is technically pre-raid BiS even for orcs. The +50 attack power can't really be beat. The best budget option is just to go 2h fury until you get a weapon drop from Ony.
---
Replaced that dagger by the Azuresong Mageblade last week. Never saw a weapon from Scholomance.
---
Also, now I know what to throw my crusader enchant on, haha. Thanks again.
---
You really want them to live long enough to see retail and the burning of Teldrassil?  
---
Fuck's wrong with you?
---
Will do thanks
---
I’d swap the mage and the Druid.
---
Hellfire, rain of fire, immolate, conflagrate, soulfire, searing pain. maybe missed one idk
---
Even the fight mechanics seem off too. Check out this video from 2006: https://youtu.be/5uZEpyJDQy8
---
You can see Gyph would freeze you in place, which is why two tanks were needed. Rend would have a nasty WW that you'd have to run away from.
---
Then maybe your connection is too laggy then because it flat out doesn't happy to me. I don't know what to tell you dude other than the fact that it doesn't happen to everyone which points towards it not really being a feign death bug. You're just so absolutely convinced that you can't be wrong though that you won't listen to anything and resort to calling people names instead.
---
yes I am playing the OG Blizzard devs' legendary game, as I will continue to shit on modern Blizzard for all the piss poor decisions they've made over the years such as this one.
---
Not sure, but it's relatively short
---
Long time since I saw someone type so much and say so little
---
Yes it does exist
---
Yeah, but Thrash doesn't sheath on your back and looks like a level 24 green.
---
The town part is true. I use to be a GM. They consider world disruption at that point. Different than ganking or camping. As for killing someone repeatedly on respawn, I've never intervened or seen anyone do it. Maybe if it was something they did back in the day. I worked there from Warlords to start of BfA.
---
Evading mobs isn't a bug. It's working as intended.
---
There are plenty of NPCs who are survivors of Lordaeron, as well as refugees who likely live in SW now. The dead - and especially the Horde - don't have a claim at least in my opinion.
---
ElitistJerks was definitely a thing prior to AQ.  I learned most of what I know about Vanilla WoW through that website.  My time spent on private servers and Classic has only helped to refine my skills using that knowledge.  Anyone who was truly ignorant during Vanilla simply never bothered to look for information because it was definitely out there and easily found through an internet search engine.
---
No problem! Happy to help
---
Might be wrong but I think it's off the swing timer. Meaning it doesnt matter when you use it, your swing time remains the same. Slam is the exception, a warrior ability, whereby it cancels your auto reset until completed.
---
Dungeom grinding at least is fairly fun and engaging. Gets boring fast tho because there's no quests to break up the monotony. But its definitely far from mindless.
---
Questing efficiently is harder ofc, theres so much memorization there, it's not enough to just be good at the game and know the dungeons.
---
Chestnuts would be proud
---
If you go there as a ghost you can see other Kodo ghosts.
---
Is that Pitbull?
---
Damn! That's disappointing
---
That's kinda annoying... Can they still get xp if they heal/ buff you? I've been making some decent gold running low levels through SM and some other dungeons
---
Ask not what your guild can do for you but what you can do for your guild
---
Oh cool thanks for the tip
---
My plan is to literally go Frost until I get the Talisman trinket in MC and immediately going 3 minute mage spec.. never been a big fan of frost spec. Ive been Arcane Mage since Wrath
---
Loving the optimism!
---
I mean, it's utterly insane but I love it!
---
I dont know why wowhead couldnt filter out comments from 2.0
---
Low tier content
---
I’m playing a Druid, and have done some runs with a Druid homie with both of us as tank/heal. Whenever the healer is almost out of mana we switch positions. Usually each of us can handle 2-3 pulls before we have to switch. 
---
It’s crazy fun, and some of the fastest dungeons I’ve ran. It’s easiest with melee dps, but if your spell casters are ready for it and good at mana management, you can make it work that way.
---
Vendor buy the bank some guards!
---
This is yet another thing missing from retail; post quest followups that make us feel like part of the world, like our actions are having impact. Even the letters from the Gubber Blump have an impact, make you feel as if your 'name is out there'.
---
"Fuckin' behind you! Behind you! Behind you!"  
---
aaaannnd ... muted.
---
VC = Deadmines
---
DM = Diremaul
---
Anyone tells you different is a Cata Baby
---
This looks like some got bored on a private server
---
Because Forsaken attracts the insecure, edgy people. When orcs and tauren aren't masculine and powerful enough for you, you roll a male Forsaken with a mohawk.
---
Id love a /played and a /timespentdrinking
---
Very true, but more often than not, I'm the first to the dungeon due to TELEPORTATION POWAS so I'll use that time to make em.
---
Demons in azshara give good decent xp and gold as well as felcloth and demonic runes for your healer friend.
---
That's simply not true, all of the T1 and T2 except the chest (excluding gear with affixes) are better than alternatives when compared in isolation.
---
DB/DB is better. But let's be serious, odds of you even getting one are pretty damn low.
---
I thought the same, but found an old video of a group leaving combat. https://youtu.be/8D61BCUdij4
---
Lies. Slander! HERESY!
---
IceHUD or ArcHUD, I think both are on curseforge.
---
53 Rogue looking for a damn group to do temple of hakar with.  It seems no one wants to do it but I have like 5 quests there!
---
Its a multi sectioned dungeon like Scarlet Monestary. There are some solid items in there as memory serves.
---
Not to mention its a lot easier to get gear in a dungeon as opposed to raids (5people vs 10/25/40)
---
&gt;i-it's not FD it's buggy movement that fucks up FD... checkmate haha
---
Wtf lmao, and you started being a prick first so don't try and take the moral high ground. There are tons of people saying it happens and then they come out and admit there's a movement delay bug that's causing it and you just shove your head in dirt and say it must be lag. 
---
It just baffles me how you refuse to accept there's an issue that's outside of peoples control. For example, a firelord was shooting at one of my friends. I ran up to it, stopped, hit FD instantly, and trapped then moved right after. No issues. However if I got a delay bug then boom nothing happens. Not everyone plays like a shitty statue like you.

The guy you are quoting had it spot on.
---
Yet we can still use Hasselhoof as a tauren (Only thing is you need to heat hamburgers off the floor)
---
Why do you need a capture card for wow?
---
Bloodthirst is based on total attack power and not weapon damage.
---
To be fair, threat meters as they were in classic do not exist. That isn't to excuse people's behavior with threat (I main a prot warrior, so yes... yes I know), but to make sure it's given in the right perspective of the time we live in.
---

Was this probably a glitch given the extremely small chance of it happening?  It wasn’t even the exact same mob type.  It was off spiders in dusk wood, one was a Pygmy spider the other was whatever is next to the pygmy ones (Webwood I think)
---
[Angry wandering healer noises]
---
It is extremely boring to level. It is not particulary hard or anything, you have one of the easier levelers. It is just really fucking boring, because all you will be doing is press 2 buttons and wait for cooldowns of these two buttons. Aside from a heal every now and then. 
---
It is not fast, it is not exciting, it is just stale, as you get no other damage spell from level 6-60. Well and endgame you are a healer. There is nothing else. You can tank dungeons relatively decent at level 60 but in no way can you tank a raid. You don't deal enough damage for either raids nor dungeons to be a DPS.
---
Lets you shift directly from one form to another without a stop in caster form.

That doesn't say anything about movement delay bugs, it says the ability is more sensitive than it should be to your movement. Nothing about delays at all. If I'm wrong, please quote the part that talks about delayed movement bugs.
---
Something similar happened on Ashkandi last week.
---
The level penalties not applying sound like a good thing to me, even if it's not intended. I don't play a caster but I don't think they should be useless vs high level players.
---
What's wrong with the Skull of Impending Doom? I got it ages ago but have yet to use it for anything other than the speed buff.
---
Unless you are dungeon grinding with spell cleave shadow is far better to level with for general questing/killing stuff. And if you have a long farm session ahead of grinding mobs at 60 or want to farm gold in Mara you shadow is the better option too. 
---
Sure shadow isn't great for raids and most priests will have to respec holy but theres a lot more to pve than raids
---
Druids in DnD regard balance as the greater good as well (and it is very important in the setting), so it's not different from druids in Azeroth. You don't really see both going out of their way to fight an evil baron or help impoverished folk.
---
&gt; Neutral implies more that they passively accept what happens and deal/change with what happens. 
---
Maintaining the balance of good/evil/nature is not a passive affair for Druids in DnD. They actively try to preserve the balance, and act against forces that tip the scales too far.
---
Well that's interesting.  Those druids are sexy so I guess I can kinda understand.
---
Edit:  Hmmm I don't know.  The little tick box next to Mature Content is not checked.
---
We did ony twice, first week nemesis helm drops and I was only lock so i got it, the second week we were trying to get another lock incase it dropped cause I was the only one again, we were even willing to take a pug lock whose attuned and give them the helm for some gold to help fund repair bots. We never found a lock and of course, a second t2 lock helm drops lol
---
Unless you get crit by the bomb like i did the other night. Then you die
---
Why though? Just buy them. The price is the same as the material price.
---
trial accounts can, my friend was playing with me on one the other day, wouldn't let him trade tho
---
that sweet meta of sub 1 min fight spamming flash heal. I actually discovered this while going through logs after last raid, and Will try to adapt my gameplay to it.
---
Hmm, while nice, I really only want the unit frames, I have similar ones in retail and havent found a classic version yet. Thanks though!
---
Hahaha can confirm, this was my experience in MC the other night. It was so fun being part of that final charge
---
Kinda unrelated, but if you’re in her melee range laying into her between whelp spawns while she’s in flight in p2, she has a chance to melee you right before casting her fireball at you. Be careful if you’re minmaxing yourself to the top for a free agro reset or you might just eat a crushing 2k+ melee to the jaw.

 &lt;Bourbon Raiders&gt; \[Horde\] \[casual\]\[PVP\] \[Fri, and Sat 9pm to 12am\] \[casual\]\[Loot council\]
---
Hello Everyone I would like to introduce Bourbon Raiders, a casual Family-oriented guild recruiting for Classic.
---
Our Goal: Provide a guild for people that have kids, work 50+ hours a week, and have other real life responsibilities that keep them from joining a hardcore guild. We aim to complete all end-game content whether it is PvP or PvE related, but at our own pace. Whatever your goals in classic we would be delighted to help you achieve them.
---
Faction: Horde
---
Raid times: Friday and Saturday 9pm to 12am EST
---
Website: [bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.com](https://bourbonraiders.guildlaunch.com/)
---
if interested, you can reach me on my battletag: Soulmauler#1583, or on Discord: Soul#6978. (Or here obviously)
---
Totally understand your plight. First time playing a mage past level 10 for me and can’t believe how much time I spend drinking!
---
Warriors, rogues, shaman, hunters. Go rogue for the utility and similarity with stealth.
---
Druid and Shaman should swap
---
Aww lame. Just realized I clipped two of same one together. This dude went off on me for doing something nice. Was pretty fun.
---
Haha I didn't know you could spell batch a hot and a drink. This changes things for my Druid, but I was more referring to still moving from one pack to the next while drinking.
---
You can always keep the archmage to craft water faster. Bloodvine is completely trash stats unless you are hitting bosses to take advantage of the hit chance.

2. Don't spend all your money on your skills
---
3. Get a swing timer add-on or learn how to count between weapon swings.
---
4. Do not level in prot spec, wait till high 50's to change to prot.  
---
Good luck on your warrior and stay the course, warriors get exponentially better with levels and gear.
---
&gt; Ignore people who tell you, "That's not how you're supposed to play"
---
Proceeds to make post telling people how not to play
---
Boo hoo, go power-game min-max meta-farm in an instance. Not near public nodes. If you were an enemy I'd just kill you, but this method is the only retort I have.
---
And it works. They leave.
---
A paladin healer in my BRD group today got 6 pieces of plate healing gear while I and the other 4 people got nothing. It was pretty funny
---
We are in phase 1, dire maul coming out Tuesday which was supposed to be in phase 2 but they are just releasing dire maul for now and not doing honor until phase 2 is official so yeah... if they did do that phase 6... you don't want to be riding slow for the next full year before we get there.  Just speculating on that full year part  before someone starts asking for a source lol.  It should be close to that though, closer to 8 months for my less than educated guess.
---
Then he shouldn't have invited the warlock in the first place tbh.
---
Players: *roll characters on a dead server*
---
Also players: “our server is dead do something”
---
Should I level as a single target frost mage or an AOE frost mage? I want to do spell cleave in dungeons as I'm levelling as well.

I get non-guild members from lfg like this. Has worked 100% of the time.
---
We fool around alot and just mess around but if a pull or anything goes to shit everybody pops and we stop shit talking in DC and actually call out CD's
---
Holy shit man, you win. FD isn't working right because of another issue, not what I said. I was wrong and you were right. LMAO!
---
Supposedly bears only use the Manual Crowd Pummeler on the pull to get a spike of aggro then switch to a stat-stick when the buff ends. Cats are the ones that need to farm up bags and bags of them.
---
But yeah vanilla itemization is weird, and seems to be worse for feral druids and prot/ret paladins than anyone else. Maybe Enhance Shamans too, but I'm not sure. Seems like Hunters lucked out, being the only physical class that uses mana and *doesn't* seem to be too poorly itemized for.
---
**Edit**: Though I do wonder if the weird itemization can work in my favor. I know I heard about a Hunter in either vanilla or early BC who equipped a bunch of +healing gear, basically a Resto Shaman set, and soloed one of the world boss dragons because Mend Pet scaled so well with +Healing that he just had to keep Mend Pet up and his pet wouldn't die.
---
Damn wish i had thought of this! Great idea
---
Yep, and hopefully someone lets the lock know about that item/quest

Is that sarcasm or did you actually realize it doesn't say what you thought it did? Because honestly, I'd be impressed if you are really admitting you didn't know what you were talking about.
---
This particular item is only dropped pigmy venom web spiders with 1% chance. You killed 2 and had both drop it. The chance is low, but not unreasonable. Webwood spiders are in Teldrassil btw, you were in Duskwood.
---
Proposing raid finder on classic wow.
---
That’s a bold move
---
You should have rolled Alliance
---
The ser is trash if you can't take advantage of hit %.
---
As such, it is only useful against boss targets.
---
Dual spec yes. Raid finder no.
---
Why are you freaking out
---
Yeah I wasn't sure on Bear honestly.
---
So few good warriors in classic atm, everyone is a rtard rushing in thinking they are unkillable.
---
That said, a lot of characters are not necessarily part of Horde or Alliance. There are an enormous amount of people who are not even nearly as racist as the player characters or the two big factions.
---
Again, if your day can be RUINED by someone killing you in a video game, you have problems and should seek professional help.
---
You cannot gauge someone’s morality by what they do in a video game. I can’t believe people actually think this.
---
Well with frost aoe you can also quest and solo grind. It’s unquestionably the best spec for leveling. If you want to play something else because it’s fun, that’s fine too.
---
I’m livid
---
Try typing:

---
If you want actual, correct, pedantry, my examples, as well as his, are initialisms. It's just not a phrase you seem thrown around often and most people understand 'acronym'. 
---
All versions of acronyms and initialisms are abbreviations, with the loosest form of abbreviations being words like 'Mar' for March and 'Prof.' for professor. 
---
Point stands, however - insisting Deadmines is D while BWL is in the same game is something he didn't mean to do. 
---
While coming back with such an off-tangent reply is all he could do.
---
have been 60 and i havent world pvped once at all in the 4 weeks that ive been max level.
---
just sitting and grinding mara so i can be ready as possible for phase 2....
---
i should take a night off princess farm grind runs...
---
Dual specialisation is the worst thing to add. Group finder is second worst.
---
Definitely not impossible. We were doing it a month back when we'd all just hit 60 and had fuck all gear and had 1 permanently sheeped, but then had 3 enforcers spawn out in a row. Even with capped stacks my priest managed to keep me up with only a last stand and a mana pot.
---
Ok, but that's all raiding really is...
---
No one gives a f how you parse on trash xD

A hunter (don’t remember which one, but he was from &lt;Hot Tub WOW Machine&gt; kited him there and let Bolvar kill him. 
---
It was a weird Saturday afternoon in the Keep.
---
Funny enough, he wrote with me a bit afterwards and was like "There has to be a better way to do this room" and googled it. Then he said like "ohh there is a quest I can do to make it easier"
---
Running a friend through it and you decided to murder him as a form of payment?
---
People out here wondering why kids are shooting up schools, but can’t see that kids who think people are “basically trash” because they got killed in a video game are unstable and need help.
---
This is like exactly how my character looks lol
---
It's sarcasm because you're going to ride that technicality boner to your grave even though you acted like this whole time there was nothing wrong with FD and it was everyone elses fault even though they came out and said there was a movement bug that needed fixed that messed up FD. 
---
But of course since I called it movement delay instead of movement speed bug you win, what a master of logic and arguing.
---
I can't tell how good spirit is as a stat, deciding between

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6682/death-speaker-robes
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9623/civinad-robes
---
i always thought spirit is the worst stat in the game, because if trying to get hp/mana, you can always just eat/drink to full
---
i'm a frost/aoe mage lvl 35
---
&gt;It was easy to quest and level though
---
*Said the man on the dead server, just before he realized his fate*
---
All I see is the imgur logo.
---
Lifetap is a GCD where you aren't doing damage. Also in less competent MC runs you can't rely on getting any healing.
---
Yeah absolutely, but I was purely talking about raid / boss dmg output (as that's how most raiders measure themselves, not on trash parses or their ability to conjure water )
---
There's better greens that RotAM if you're talking purely about intellect/Mana pool
---
I never played wow before classic released. One of my good buddies played a ton back in middle school and convinced our entire friend group to play. Legitimately one of the best video game experiences I have ever had. Already working on alts, this game has consumed me
---
Would you believe something very similar happened to me lol?
---
&gt; Seems like every rogue I group with is allergic to good builds. Combat swords is just better.
---
For PvE, sure. If you picked a Rogue, PvP is probably a priority for you and Subtlety &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Combat there.
---
Just finished up all the level quests in Un'Goro Crater on my 53 orc rogue. Some of those quests require completion in Winterspring. Should I head there next?
---
Also what level should I be in order to start doing BRD?
---
mace stun is on a seperate DR than kidney and cheap
---
Lol My rogues name is Kilotorr but to be fair it was one of the names I randomed.
---
hes the easiest one
---
I was able to collect 10 BRD quests and complete them all at lvl 52 (granted a guildie 60 tank helped our group). There are even more quests so I plan on going back to BRD multiple times.
---
As for lvling zones here's the order I'm doing: Searing Gorge, Blasted Lands, Burning Steppes, Azshara, Un'Goro, Felwood, WPL, EPL, Winterspring
---
For blink and Frost nova and coc Cooldowns. Do you even pvp
---
The makings of a comical musical
---
I had a guy call me a casual for not flasking for a pug MC run. 
---
We had killed everthing the week before, and suceeded in killing everything this week without a single wipe, and in good time, but aparently if i'm not dropping 50g on a flask for utterly no reason i'm a casual.
---
he also gave me shit for using a shield in a duel, for fun, vs a random shaman healer after the raid. I'm all for tryharding when appropriate, but godamn man there is a line in the sand.
---
killed rend plenty on p servers he was never that tough, the rest of the instance is far more difficult
---
Thanks for the extensive list of shit servers.
---
Well shit. You win. Gg bud
---
WPL, then EPL and WS. 
---
&gt;Also what level should I be in order to start doing BRD?
---
Depends on the run, but for the earlier stuff (Angerforge/Arena) 54~ is good.
---
If you want to do an emperor run I'd wait a few more levels because he's 59 and at 54 you won't be hitting him too often.
---
Shamans can easily top the charts. But then they are OOM after 30 seconds.
---
Whenever I think of rogue, I see Bronn from Game of Thrones (tv series). He gives 0 fucks about anyone but himself (well, he did only like Tyrion... who didn’t?)
---
Sounds like an internet issue to me, I had the exact same. Looked into bit more and upgraded by buying a cheap  network switch and some cat7 cables. Been fine ever since.
---
You’re using it correctly, but it’s because of sword specialization procs from SS reseting your swing timer. SS itself has no impact on the swing timer.
---
I have. 
---
I’m the GM though.
---
What they actually need to do is fix paladins and druids so they can actually tank somewhat efficiently. Duel spec is something I thought about, but ultimate ruins the class fantasy and community. I’m not a priest, im a holy priest, and everyone knows it. It’s the communities prerogative to help me out because gearing me gears them. 
---
As for raid finder, just shut up. That is the nuclear approach to infinitely better options to having more tanks in the game. Druids are stupidly under represented in raids, and there are way too many healers. Giving other tanks a buff so they can actually do it is so obvious it hurts. Doesn’t change the fact that there are only 2 tanks per raid. That is just Blizzards mistake from 2004 that we are living because it’s classic. Out of 40 people only 2 tanks? I was leveling a tank until I realized I wasn’t going to be a main tank so I rerolled. What’s the point?
---
Int matters far less than hit or crit my man, actually it is the least important of the three (until hit capped) because you cannot gain spell damage from int, you only gain Mana and crit.
---
59.5 int/1% crit.
---
2% crit on bloodvine set, that's = 119 intellect  (ofc minus the Mana )
---
As a mage raider, you should not have issues with Mana to the point you're valuing int &gt; hit or crit, you should be using Mana pots and Mana gems off cooldown. 
---
Even with a Mana pool of 5k , buffed, it shouldn't be an issue unless the fight is longer than 3 min
---
C'mon m8 pls don't come @ me unprepared !! Haha you gonna be met with the sauce !  
---
Not to mention the fact that 1 resist is = 0 dmg , basically a wasted spell. 
---
Hit is king until you're capped. 
---
1-2% is a gross underrepresentation of the damage that bloodvine brings
---
I forgot to mention, crit is even more important post-phase 4, as more mages roll fire.
---
I played Pservers and you'd wear bloodvine until you get t2.5 my mang , it's an extremely great set for casters. Even more so for warlocks, as they don't get 6% hit in their talents like us spoiled mages.
---
I regularly tank every dungeon with 2h (all plate gear) it’s much more efficient than using a shield if your healers are geared and I’m always the top dps usually by a wide margin, however inexperienced or poorly geared players absolutely must use a shield. (I’m 5k unbuffed in dps plate gear)
---
Icy Veins has always been a great resource for theorycrafting. Here's the mage stat priority page: 
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/mage-dps-pve-stat-priority
---
Ill try repost with a quick fix to show thumbnail
---
There is a 21.3% chance that you will get that weapon during the 15 kills required for the quest. So the chance of 2 in a row happening during that quest is .22%.
---
Almost like its completely unfun to play when every part of the server is a 4v1 (looking at you stalagg).  Silly Alliance you should be grateful that you get curb stomped by the stupidly overpopulated faction hurrdurr chickens!
---
Or lazy.
---
Thanks, so it might just be heroic strike that benefits?
---
Horde be players be like: Why doesn't anyone stick around? We only outnumber them 9 to 1!
---
Ony isn't a key it's a neck piece.
---
For those who don't understand this concept pf keyrings; its physical keys which have the word "key" in them
---
Scarlet Key
---
Skeleton Key
---
etc...
---
That's so cute haha
---
it means it's just as good
---
If you're not 60, pragmatically speaking, re-spec when you are not able to heal the dungeon.
---
If you are never going to quest prior to 60, then re-spec but that's not really feasible (for most/some of us)
---
Requiring naxx gear for leveling in hellfire peninsula just wouldn't work. Sure, there's other approaches to progression but with the wow model the chain of required progression can't go on forever as they add new content.  At some point they have to break it and they used to do it every expansion. Nowadays it's every patch...
---
Yes, to both.
---
Whirlwind is 25 rage to do an auto's worth of damage. The only other skill you have that can compare to that kind of damage is Overpower, and that requires them to dodge first.
---
Probably makes sense to swap as soon as you're mostly dungeoning instead of questing.
---
When the game was about two weeks in it was voted most balanced server on I believe wow wiki. I rolled on blaum day one and I love it
---
I did say 7/10. Most Rogues aren't smart enough to do that...in the same way many Hunters don't hotkey Flare.
---
Not bugged. Its been hotfixed
---
You get to wear an ogre suit and dance around in it, and that’s not something you see every day.
---
Also, different flavors of pre-raid BIS and a chance of pace in where to farm them.
---
Youre a legend
---
I'm worried about you
---
It already has a countdown clock though. Once naxx releases that's it and it will die eventually.
---
I've had the same feeling actually. It definitely feels like the "cast time" of your instant shots are much shorter than it was on pservers, and you can easily fit your autoshots inside your Multishots and Serpent Stings.
---
I haven't played a warrior in like 15 years, so grain of salt here, but I really feel like I remember some truth to this.  I do remember struggling to generate rage in the lower level dungeons but we were probably doing it wrong back then.  I also remember that the more geared you got and the more mitigation that you had it actually became more difficult to tank dungeons because nothing could hit you.  
---
I'm not a huge fan of the dps tanking either, but I tend to agree with the "I'm rage starved" excuse.  I do agree that st/brd is definitely the cut off point though, and you definitely need a shield in raids.  No doubt about that.
---
😒
---
Ok but those guides were always shit and written by clueless ppl
---
I aaaaalways jump in, even if out gunned its fun to see what you can pull off. Sometimes you surprise yourself, those are the real wins.
---
I play a holy priest with some shadow/disc talents for QOL, and I must admit mana was a huge issue for me to til about lvl 25ish then once you get some good intellect/spirit and get your “spirit tap” talent all the way to 100% mana wont be an issue. And I rock shit at wpvp
---
Yeah if you want a bloated messy monstrosity of a UI
---
Over price on AH? Jail. Undercut? Believe it or not, jail.
---
You don't have to just sit there for awhile and wait to use it. Literally just don't hit WASD or right click for a split second while you use it, it'll work fine. That's all I do to make sure it doesn't fail aside from the occasional resist.
---
It’s how people on a server call a dungeon in a video game, it’s not that deep.
---
Whoa. That Malf vs Illidaddy panel at the bottom makes me feel some kind of way.
---
is it possible to have it calculate spellpower and healingpower?
---
We actually only have like 4 warriors at 60 rn and 3 are fury, just had another prot warr ding 60 a few days ago. Super caster heavy raid team the first few weeks
---
I played similar build in vanilla to great effect but it's very gear dependent. You need a lot of +dmg&amp;heal gear to make it work. 
---
Basically you're keeping renew rolling on those taking damage, using vamp embrace and blasting shadow spells to further heal. 
---
I highly recommend you spec into both threat reduction talents from disc and shadow. You'll be generating a lot of threat multi dotting and healing.
---
https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=priest&amp;t=vhvMvNvOvPvivIvJvKvLvgvCvDvrvvvfvEvFvGvHvuwkwDwEwFwGwBwmwCwjwHw0wIwJwKwpwAwhwLwMwqI0I1wZw1w3wiwrwswtwu
---
Wrong.
---
That's technically an initialism. 
---
Acronyms are the most specific of abbreviations: they have to be pronounced as somewhat of a new word so they roll off the tongue. Initialisms are just taking certain letters into an abbreviation that's now pronounced letter by letter. E.G. FBI, ATM, DMV = initialisms. Acronyms would be more of: POTUS. Laser. Scuba. ACRES. D may be pronounceable as 'Dee' but that's not forming a new pronunciation, but rather the reading of the letter, which is key to initialism.
---
So if we were to do subsets, abbreviations &gt; initialisms &gt; acronyms. 
---
That's the especially pedantic part of it I was not going to go into - to be honest I didn't think I'd have to, because who the hell does that, and it was besides the point. 
---
The main point, if I may steer it back, was Deadmines = D the same way BWL = BL. SG = S.
---
Incendius is pretty sweet.
---
I've kept saying classic is made from a wrath build retrofitted. This supports my claim.  
---
Also plenty NPC's that think this is mid wrath and Varian is king of Stormwind.
---
That which has no life.
---
You can't blade hardcore guilds for doing what is optimal. Like the incoming phase 2 honor meatgrinder.
---
Why would you worry about performance in Strat/Scholo if you're not staying shadow? Very few people bother to quest for leveling past 52-54ish. Which is still before plaguelands and both those dungeons. If you care about farming mobs, Dire Maul the king of all cash mob farms is out tomorrow.
---
If it were anything but endgame content I'd agree I'm off my rocker.
---
Also if you get silenced while casting it you are locked out of shadow spells.
---
I'm skilling my mage 31/0/20 on a pve server because I read it's highest dps in classic pve content? Am I doing it wrong?
---
“I turned 60 today...” happy birthday !
---
Nice.
---
I did this in Ashenvale countering the Horde quest where they take the Silverwing Outpost. It was in the name of the Alliance though and I wasn't outleveling the zone at the time, just in the upper 20s. Ashenvale as a whole was a bloodbath in the first few weeks anyways.
---
Give him time, you'll start hating him soon enough.
---
I mean there wasn’t a phase 1 Vanilla. We have 1.12 talents and blue gear (and nerfed UBRS).
---
"Oh no, it's a warlock ! One of the most malevolent creature on this cursed land ! No one may imagine what insane past he must has to devot himself to such darkness !"
---
Warlock : "Eh ! Look I summon demon and spiky fire horse ! Here's a healthstone pls help me to tp my friendz !" \*enslaved infernal breaks free\* "OH SHIT"
---
it wont sell for much on AH because of the ridiculous attack speed so he decided to be nice
---
everybody learn from him
---
You should google for something like "Classic WoW level ranges per zone" and check that.
---
If you're still learning the game, try to do zones a bit lower level than you are, and pick up all the quests at once then start farming them out, only returning to hand in when you have a bunch and/or you're close to the turn in location.
---
Also, in terms of pure xp rate, quests are  more of a bonus, the real xp is from killing mobs. But you shouldn't focus on that too much else you'll burn out. Make sure you're having at least some fun along the way.
---
I don't mind, we don't have this tradition where I'm from so I enjoy seeing them here.
---
*Forest
---
Oh it can grab search data while you are online in the game client (likely have to have AH open) but it can't make http web requests outside of the game to grab data like you can in retail.
---
Chicken from engineering
---
I re-rolled to alliance between BWL and AQ. I would recommend it for the new zones and quests. I ended up going back to Horde close to the end of Vanilla and have remained horde since  but don't regret checking out alliance.
---
If you have mana issues while levling as a priest you are doing it wrong. Dot, bubble and wand doesnt cost much mana and is the way to go. Its a lot worse as a mage who constantly casts spells and need to drink. Yes you will kill mobs faster as a mage but the drinking downtime makes it generally slower.
---
With a swing timer, you should be able to see when your white shots will happen and move/cast in the window before it does. One caveat though: there seems to be an internal delay where your white shot will not go off if you move within .5 seconds of it reaching the end of the swing timer. I don't know the official math, this is just my personal observation playing my Hunter.
---
Thanks ! No talents indeed, and a lot of other stuff.
---
Mainly because I kept seeing comments saying "if someone does this it will be a hunter or a warlock" so I wanted to play something else.
---
And second, because I don't really like hunter, but I love rogue, honestly. I usually play rogue or priest on my "real" characters and felt really safe as a rogue. I'm not only reffering to vanish but to all my defensive abilities. I also expected my abilities to deal enough damage with low gear requirement.
---
Nice! Good call
---
Ahahaha yeah and you can turn sideways and strafe in the backwards direction and move twice as fast backwards if you need to.
---
Does keyboard turning and clicking skills have its uses too? 
---
I should also put walk/run on one of my major binds because sometimes you just need to move...slower.....
---
Necessary downvote? I have one too.
---
Look up AOE farms on YouTube, there are some awesome tips out there.
---
While you were out partying and having a social life, I specced into Fire.
---
This is why wow became a singleplayer game.
---
You don’t need a reason. Enemies die. It hinders their leveling experience which is the reason.
---
Records drops across all your kills to accurately determine drop rate. And it's just cool to see how your own loots biased.

Except if you read my comment from earlier it stated things like be communicative and clear with your group. Thats being reasonable.

As someone who hasn’t seen a single dal’rend drop after 27 kills. I would pay 400g for the MH unquestionably lol.
---
Inb4 “I see both drop at the same time like 4 times a week!”
---
My favorite group was 2 Druids, 2 Warriors, and a Shaman running SM Cath. Both warriors and the shaman had Ravager. 
---
It was a friggin meat grinder.
---
Shoot run shoot run shoot run
---
I've leveled 6 or 7 frost mages over the years. Always fun. I love AoE farming and being untouchable.
---
Going fire this time around. Feels weird. This die before they get to me and they weren't even slowed. It's all fun and games until a frost nova gets resisted, then I am forced to wand to death since my fireball becomes a 15second cast.
---
Makes me miss frost, but not having the elemental to look forward to just seems lackluster.
---
/s?
---
Yeah I wouldn’t trust it.
---
In SM GY for example they can insta-cast immolate. Sucks to dispel
---
side note, you do not need exalted with Darnasssus, you need "Tiger Riding" which ANY Nightelf can get (at lvl 40). 
---
Other races need tiger riding which is only taught once you are exalted :)
---
You're welcome. :)
---
Arcane Power is a great dps cooldown, that AP Frost spec will be ideal until you can go into a fire spec post-BWL
---
Hm okay I'll definitely have to look into this. Thanks so much!
---
Which also means you're an idiot for actually believing that this is the case.
---
Edit: what did I expect, you play LoL which is an ez mode moba.
---
They’re good because their intentions, they’re neutral because they don’t take part in fractions. Shaman is more chaotic, being tribal and toying with the elements.  Wow lore wise, shamans are way more chaotic than druids.
---
You’re exaggerating how crowded the spots are a bit. You will have a few randos come through for a quest but this late after release there’s rarely multiple mages at 1 spot. Furthermore there’s a couple camps at each place so you can split off
---
Interesting, I've never seen that. Care to elaborate?
---
LOOK AT ALL THOSE MANA POTS DAMNNNNNN
---
Blind, you blind them and reset after they ice blocked.
---
The title of the fucking post is once you get to ST/BRD you need to put on a shield.   I was providing an example of why its not strictly necessary.   So good one you got me..
---
It won't let me search Elitist Jerks or view posts on the old WoW boards, but

---
This old blog talks about it a little bit. If you google "wow key timing vs spamming" you can find a few other mentions of it. 
---
I don't know how the classic client works, but in Vanilla spamming spells would lock you out of casting for a split second due to the client sending errors... you had to receive the errors before you could queue your next ability. At some point they made it so that you can change your spell queue latency in the console to make key-timing easier for people with higher latency, but again I'm not sure if this is in classic. 
---
This never applied to instant cast abilities such as skinning, it's for chaining abilities together.
---
Forever...? Classic has been out about 2 months.
---
Not sure you know what “forever” means.
---
Oh and no one cares about this or any other subtle flex post on classicwow from people who didn’t accomplish anything in retail. 
---
Losers.
---
WTF nobody told me it was opposite day shit
---
By the way, 1v1 ganking is very strong in a BG environment where healers don't have 10 billion "lmao nt tho" buttons.
---
Pressure is superior when you don't have 100-0 kill potential. When you do have 100-0 capabilities, instantly deleting a support player is a gigantic tactical advantage, as opposed to just trying to overwhelm the enemy heal throughput.
---
Step 1. Have friends  
---
Step 2. Have friends who play WoW  
---
Step 3. Have friends who play WoW at the same time as you  
---
Step 4. Have friends who play WoW at the same time as you and stay in the same level range  
---
Step 5. Have friends who play WoW at the same time as you and stay in the same level range and aren't BAD  
---
Step 6. ???

Step 7. Profit

Best mobs in the history of wow.

Don’t know what to tell you man. I’ve helped 3 guildies do it so far.
---
Ohhh cool!

No one cares.

Next.

Girlfriend (Resto Druid) and I (Fury Warrior) questing in STV killing the caster goblins in the North East for some quest. We were around 34 when we past 2 level 29 hunters and their level 41 Rogue friend. By the time my GF started getting hit I was far away. She ended up kiting and I managed to charge the rogue  right as she died. They were all full health and I ended up killing the rogue in a few autos. I was about half health and feared both pets. And intercepted the one hunter and 2 shot him and thankfully I had specced into improved intercept and was able to get a second one off and kill the other hunter living with about 10% health. Basically a 3v1 with the rogue cds popped. I've never felt more like a warrior. At 38 I swapped to arms and wish I leveled as arms. Keeping rage on stance swaps is sexy as fuck
---
My solution as a healer is let that stupid dps die and not heal so all threat problems are once again solved. Only tank has aggro   and he has generated some extra threat while that clown dps was facetanking. That way the dps either learns or leaves
---
Not really. Sounds like you didn't really want to play.
---
At least 4 billion to 1
---
Buff with each and check dps stats in character panel -&gt; pet.
---
May not too. 50/50
---
Wow a flex post about someone else. Not even something OP accomplished for themselves. 
---
LOL.
---
So damn sad.
---
Does seen odd when a person literally named Scamaz is saying you're petty
---
well the 15th everywhere kinda doesn't work due to timezones...
---
I would still much rather that kinda thing be left to the mage or warlock in the group. Besides, the handful of paladins I've run with who insist on doing this do it not just on non-elite aoe trash pulls. They'll cast consecrate even if I'm tanking just a single mob. To me, consecrate does way too little damage against a single target to be worth casting.
---
Do you even want to play classic?
---
You realise he’s trolling right?
---
I think it's so dumb that some people don't like druid tanks.
---
My buddy who is a core raider got put on the back burner over a random pug warrior for off tank.
---
Meta slaves man.
---
Think we should allow extra time just in case XD
---
Agreed! 
---
Alliance aesthetic is so damn wonderful.
---
Gotta love it.
---
Obviously he should kill rag, and then Himself.
---
Oh look the millionth, "it's everyone elses fault" thread for tanks. Some are just bad. Whether it's pulling unneccary mobs, being crappy at holding aggro, or whatever it may be. When you find a good tank it's a miracle. I usually have to spoon feed tanks on what mobs to pull and where to go.
---
I don't mind average tanks, I can still FD to lose aggro if I pull right away. But when I get an amazing tank I don't have to, and it's insane how much smoother instances go. I hate how it's pretty much become accepted here that there's no such things as bad, average, good, or great tanks.
---
At 60 the #1 reason I see people stop tanking is because they already have MTs and OTs in their guild and they really don't need much gear from Strat or Scholo. They're usually plugging away in UBRS. Not because of people treating them badly even though they """"aren't""""(??).
---
If he was continually posting recount that's pretty annoying but otherwise he just sounds like a dude having fun
---
There’s nothing standing out about their loot table to me (not even cloth dropper). You may have better luck with Elementals in Arathi or Badlands (best to play an early morning session to reduce competition if you’re on a high pop server) or Beasts in SoS (also has whelps for Small Flame Sac farm)/Badlands/Dustwallow if you have skinning.
---
No, because i wont be feeling like the gear i worked my ass off for will be worthless as soon as level cap increases. Either way, fun while it lasts.
---
Maybe for you it has, but not for everyone
---
, Friend.
---
"I was kicked" - "Should've just finished the run"
---
I am confused on this. Also, he could be trolling with saying he was warned about you before it started - but typically i have found this is said after someone lets a "less than desirable" member join and they look stupid in the end because of the result.
---
Lvled with a friend, got all the greens for dench, it's been great. We also picked lock/pally so we could get away with doing this.
---
That’s not just any game bro. That’s fucking entropia universe ffs.
---
Miss is a better term because it distinguishes spell resists which work the same way as physical misses do and resistance mechanics. Spell misses should have never beem called resists tbh.
---
For a while, there was a sword/fist hybrid where you held the sword in your offhand to try and capitalize on fist crits from your sword spec procs. That may have been TBC-specific.
---
You could’ve just picked a lower pop server where the queue times were non existent after the first week or so, you couldn’t have been that excited
---
&gt; That’s such a shitty thing to do.
---
? No it's just WPvP. Griefing and corpse-camping low levels is a big part of the authentic WPvP experience.

Hi was this ever solved ?
---
After running into the same issue - even thought beast lore advise it has the skills !
---
From wotlk onwards you held aggro farting.
---
In vanilla and TBC, when aggro was actually relevant, people got called noobs for over aggroing. Now they just don't care and unload everything at pull.
---
Yeah to me I wouldnt see anything wrong with skipping week 1 due to queues but if you lose interest afterwards and never started. Its probably just you not wanting to play.

I’m trying to find a guild that raids 7:00-10:00 PM EST. Any day combination of Monday-Thursday would work best for myself. I work early in the morning and anything that goes later than those times would not work for myself.

I also have a druid tank friend that is interested in the same hours as I am.
---
Run SM Cath 10 times. Sell greys. Sell greens. Need all da blues. AH silk. Get exp.
---
I waited 6days after the launch before to sub. It was less worst for the queue after 6days than the launch day.
---
I did 10ish runs by myself/guildies. Then paid a poor booster 15g. He had to do 9 more to see it drop. That was my 2nd drop.
---
Buy the ring for 15g.
---
as compared to using it for all of the phases?
---
This is one of the funniest videos I've ever seen in my life holy shit what an edit
---
Couldn't get into Classic.... doing something like this might be enough motivation to do it!
---
I have went from 40ish gold at level 40 to 83g at level 42. If you just keep questing and selling your valuable drops on the AH, you will get there passively if you aren't in a hurry. Quest rewards blow up after level 40.

Lil cute cheeky gnome

You sure it’s no hoj/swordspec/ironfoe etc?

I’ve found when she lands the MT pops recklessness and gets aggro back that way.

Your class has nothing to do with your alignment. You could be a rogue who is a highwayman murderer, or Robin Hood. Or a warlock who wants to destroy the world vs a warlock who studies demonology to help save the world.
---
THATS WHAT I NEEDED!  Thanks so much

Filthy and honorless.

10/10 would invite.

You can hit “o” on your keyboard and click on The “Who” tab. Type a level range and zone to find people online that you might want to play with. You can whisper them, and if they are in the same zone as you they will most likely want to play.
---
Aha--not quite! I just think it is a cool interaction, and I didn't expect it to work that way!
---
Step 1: faerie fire and moonfire them.   
---
Step 2: run away until the rogue gives up.  
---
Step 3: chase them down and moonfire them. 
---
Step 4: repeat steps 2 and 3.   
---
It's infuriating as a rogue and hilariously satisfying as a druid.
---
Did the rest of the grp know each other?
---
I waited a few weeks and played retail until my friend got his sub back. We're lvl 30 now...it's still phase 1 and not too late to start :)
---
I would switch Warriors and Shamans as well as Mages and Druids.
---
Oh I didn’t realize it has such a high drop percentage.  That really isn’t as crazy as I thought then.
---
Really? Why are they back up?
---
This happened to me while I was doing the chicken escort quest in Tanaris. I got killed at the very end 3 times by different people. Now I go back to the same spot and camp others doing that escort so they can share my pain.
---
For like 9 quests :(
---
Powered by a need to hit 60 before the heat death of the universe
---
I think people who roll horde already have a tenrancy to want to fuck things up. So it's not surprising that roving death squads is how they get their kicks. Alliance people *could* do the same, but messing up someone else's is generally not what does it for a lot of Alli players.
---
Good job! I’m a level 25 priest that’s working their way through the tailoring grind myself.
---
The one for the goblin in Un Goro. He follows at your speed and only occasionally needs to be revived with the canteen.

I never accepted a Hunter in my arena runs
---
You good bro? Wanna talk about it?
---
Paladins use crit to mana refund as their regen as healers. The only healer who super humps Mp5 are shamans who don't have other options.
---
Stacking Mp5 as a paladin feels like it's barking up the wrong tree. Certainly focusing on it anyway.
---
Please tell me you are joking about the boost

Preach it. We also have the best dance.

Gonna walk up to random people at the lake while naked and punch them. "There's fish over here bruh...just come see."

Shimmering flats is a really nice leveling area, a bunch of quests all bunched together

Oh alright. I only just now got SS so good to know i have a good habit.
---
Oh yeah he was doin both. I'm not tryin to knock someone having fun. Just got over competitive with the other DPS is all. I dunno. I just feel DPS data is irrelevant unless the group is struggling through a dungeon or until raiding. Then again, I'm fairly casual. I just couldn't figure out what all the jumping around was about.
---
Does the damage from skull not interrupt skinning? Legit dont know
---
Never happened to me and never heard about it. Maybe a lag on your side?

Adding to the pike event, Luffa can make or break the event depending on how many enforcers spawn. Dont wanna tank with 10+stacks

It was a pug
---
I'm leveling as an Arms warrior, but I keep being able to replace my 2-hander with a single one-handed weapon. How much more dps should be on a 2H for me to prefer that? 
---
Example from today: [outlaw sabre](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16886/outlaw-sabre) and [this sword](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16890/slatemetal-cutlass) vs [this 2H sword](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3822/runic-darkblade)
---
Assuming the stats work out against the proc
---
From the data it is one of the closest servers at 52% horde and 48% alliance. It might just be your level range.
---
It usually happens after I snare a player or mob as a mage, if I fall into leeway melee range after the snare breaks I’m hit with 6-8 swings if the player or mob is duel wielding or 3-4 if the player is using a two handed weapon.
---
My warrior friend has managed tower this happen where he 100-0 a mob after bing snared by it for a few seconds he scored 4 melee hits with an axe and no wind fury plus a mortal strike. 
---
It almost feels like they score hits when I fall into leeway, then perhaps they score the same hits again if I fall into regular range like the video shows, perhaps that’s what is happening. 
---
It’s to the point now where I want to test it and see if I can repeat it somehow and try figure out wtf is going on. 
---
There is a post on this I’ll try and find it.
---
Edit the forum post

I have the thrash blade, is there any gear/enchant or stats that you feel are must have/meet?
---
EDIT: Could you link your build?
---
The only time you should be using flash heal is when unexpected damage comes in, it literally only exists for when you fuck up your predictions or someone fucks up and pulls extra.
---
I would totally buy a boost if I had the option
---
You need blizzard and enough points in frost to reliably freeze MoBs to keep them away.
---
the fabled proc trinket that is "bis" is also absolute garbage at an incredibly insignificant 2%.
---
&gt;Warrior's with talent "Deep Wounds" will proc it a bit often while wearing Thrash Blade(your group members may ask you for your mental health if they see you proccing that talent with DW spec)
---
What Fury spec would ever skip Impale, which requires Deep Wounds?
---
So this is a remnant of classic and the network/computers back in the day.  There was a larger leniency of what was considered a hit or not. Basically the system accounts for higher latency so that someone at 200ms could hit a target even if it moves on server side. So there is a longer delay on hitbox escape....
---
Obviously completely unnecessary today but figured a little insight into the reason why would atleast help.
---
Id assume after reset but i hope im wrong and it drops sooner
---
I’m new to it too and I’ve found you gotta down rank your frostbolts. You may do less damage per bolt but it also seems to take way less mana in total
---
Hey I've jumped in in skulls before and turned the tides.
---
Can't understand this situation then :/
---
pretty sure this is a priavet server thing. we've tried it in classic and it hasnt worked.
---
I bet he gets his ass handed to him by basically any competent pvper. "Noobmurderer" dear god what a childish name.
---
that's not doubly good. 4 extra hits of rage in 100 swings is insignificant.
---
No thanks, vanilla should remain as vanilla as possible.
---
Thanks for the response, I'll have to keep an eye out for something like that happening during my gameplay... I wish we would at the very least get responses from blizzard on if they intend to keep these mechanical flaws as is, or improve them at some point.
---
Dont even joke about that shit. 
---
Delete this. 
---
If Activision sees this blizzard will be had by the balls.
---
Adequate. Sounds like my wife describing me. Wait thar might be sub par below average I'm thinking about.
---
No I'm not. I tried it in my 30's and ended up switching back because of it, and that was when there was more than 2 layers. I even had guildies to layer hop me. Ended up finishing my 30's out in SM. Somewhat contemplated switching back in my 40's but quickly shot that idea down after seeing Lost Riggers and a few other spots that level. I can't play during off hours either. I've leveled 3 mages to 60, 2 of which were predominantly leveled with AoE grinding. The population of the server I play on is that of active periods on Pservers. If I actually could level AoE spec then I would, but I cant. On pservers I'd group with my competitors because it was more effective for the both of us.
---
However, m 52-60 is going to be DM AoE grinding.
---
how much more efficient is drain-tank compared to SM/Ruin while leveling as warlock? currently Draintank but getting kinda bored of it
---
Level 40 atm
---
Assuming you're already 60 then?
---
You don't even have 1 H in there. No wonder it failed. It's not Aaaaa it's aaaaaahhh
---
I promise it's true. But I also promise that I equip a shield once I establish aggro.
---
In the week of the 15th. Not confirmed when exactly right?
---
Go back to retail little one
---
Could have picked something other than Faerlina.
---
That card sells for a ton
---
I didn't think about that. Good point.
---
5 is tight, I’ve done many runs with 7 ppl, one tank, one healer and 5 dps. Usually very smooth.
---
I think it's going to get old very quickly for the vast majority. I'll give it three weeks. Then we may sit back and watch how the utmost no-lifers find the most obnoxious ways to ruin the game for everyone else.

---
Death Snails truly brought out the stupid in people. LFR? People dying to snails. 10 team full clearing heroics? You bet your ass at least 1 person was still dying to a snail.
---
Why would you level as SM ruin? I would even prefer to farm mobs in the world at 60 with a drain tank spec than SM ruin
---
My Blizzard emails simply say 10.15.19, so it’s going to be tomorrow.
---
And fishing!
---
faerlina, and i feel like the time spent walking from and to quests can  be spent killing 10-20 mobs, which is already better than questing, especially in areas where mobs are super packed and they specifically have low armor and hp
---
That's up to you, do you have friends in your current guild? is your guild able to build relationships with others so that you can obtain regular invites when you do want to raid? Does one have a better tabard? 
---
You know, just the big questions like that
---
For big pulls, target mark the main DPS focus with a skull. Go in with rage(bloodrage if you have to, but you should be bloodraging between pulls to maintain rage while out of combat), ignore skull entirely til you have a sunder/revenge on all the other mobs. Let the DPS for the 2-4 seconds this takes place then taunt the skull target and spam sunders. Mocking blow if you have to. Before main target dies, at 20%-30%, mark next mob in the pull with skull and start building threat on it before your dps swaps over.
---
Obviously the shitty thing about this is making your healer heal the DPS, but honestly it's a necessary evil if your DPS is blowing their load during pulls not allowing you properly generate threat. In a perfect world, the dps would wait 4-6 secs for you to build threat on the pack, but this wont happen.
---
Try to end all pulls with some rage leftover. If you lose agro when a mob is at 20% dont bust your ass trying to get threat back before it dies, it's not worth the rage. Spend your rage on targets with a lot of health remaining or targets that are focusing your heals.
---
You're literally trying so hard to paint him as a villain. There are no police when it comes to guild loot policies. There's nobody he could "tell". The best thing that would possibly come out of leaving or whistle blowing, is the guild just reforms. In case you haven't been paying attention, they literally reformed the guild within 10 minutes of the guy stealing the materials for the weapon. So the only thing that has changed is the officers lost the materials.
---
Your bank example makes no sense. Stealing money from a bank is stealing money from the people with money in the bank. If the bank is insured, you're stealing from the government, which is funded by the taxpayers - so once again stealing from people. This example would be more along the lines of stealing a bunch of money from a slave owner's plantation, and giving the funds back to the slaves.
---
The most important part that you seem to be willfully ignoring is that he's actively been giving back the liquidated materials to the guild's raiders through consumables/money/materials etc. It's probably been said more than a dozen and a half times in this thread. 
---
So, to recap and help you walk through this. A person wasn't in a position to actively change the guild loot policy. He tried to use the power he had to change the opinions of the other officers. If he had left, the raiders would have continued to be taken advantage of. Either of those options leaves the guild right where it was, with 120 people being taken advantage of by less than 10 others. So instead, he takes the combined work of the 120 raiders, and starts working to redistribute it back to the 120 people it belonged to in the first place. And you seem to be mad that he took something from 1 person who was actively working to fuck over 120 people. 
---
You are jumping through hoops to try and paint him as a villain, and you're genuinely coming off as desperate. Not sure what stake you have in the situation, but it's pretty clear you're grasping at straws.
---
Basically it is a 1.5% drop, so you inverse that for the chance of the drop not occurring which is 98.5%, which you multiply by itself for the amount of mobs you kill, 15. So 98.5^15 is 79.7% chance of it NOT dropping, leaving you with a 21.3% chance for it to drop in 15 kills. The chance of it dropping directly after that is 1.5%, which makes it .22
---
Well only the best tanks, and by that I mean bear tanks.
---
What unit frames are you using here?
---
Is it better as in faster? No. Hunters grind mobs while walking between quests to be optimal. Mages are the ones where at times aoe grinding is fastest for them XP wise.
---
Is it better as in you'll enjoy it more? It seems so. Go for it man, you'll get there :)
---
Depending on what class he is, you will get more xp/hr for killing faster, but about 20-40% less per kill
---
Thats insanely smart. I run into this problem, some outposts/towns/encampments etc dont have anyone who sells arrows and its so bizzarre this is a great solution
---
I have a similar group of people also on Westfall Alliance who are looking for the same thing! 1 druid, 1 warlock, 1 mage, 1 hunter, 2 rogues, so far.
---
Nah, you could drink if you killed the waves fast enough.
---
Not soloable at 31 but your best bet is aoe farming SM until early 40s
---
i can vouch. he's my cousin.
---
how is ol' uncle adolphus?
---
Never! I'm here to stay.
---
This summarizes horde players so well.
---
It's more than that. Tanks are expected to know the routes and all the tacts as well. The extra responsibility is why some people love tanking, you're the unofficial party leader, but that's not my thing. I'm a dps player, and I take that role very seriously. My choice of class has never been which deals the most damage, but what do I bring to the table *besides* damage? In Classic I'm an arms warrior, and I'm basically an off tank in dungeons while providing excellent cleave dmg with sweeping strikes, and I can peel aggro off of the healer and if the tank dies I can put on a shield and try and salvage the fight.
---
The constant barrage and borderline demands that I tank instead has driven me away from my warrior at lvl 52. I'm not sure if I'm gonna bother getting to 60 at this point. Ive felt this way pretty much since lvl 30, but the sunk cost fallacy and just how much fun the class is to play is what has kept me playing, but I'm gonna go back to my shaman to try and fill that support warrior playstyle I love so much with totem twisting instead.
---
Agree, healing my way from 20-60 I can say that around 75% of all people don't get this or do and don't care because they like yellow numbers. Honestly I've become so bitter I start letting shit dps and tanks die on purpose now, if I can get away with it and not wipe.
---
I ran these in Wrath 3 or 4 times a week as the lead. I was upfront that I would take 2-3 shares depending on the raid.  I made out pretty well because the USD:Gold ratio on my server was ridiculous. I don’t remember exactly but it was around ~2k USD. Well below minimum wage but it was fun.
---
Wasn’t expecting this kind of turn out haha. Thanks for all of your input!

Stealth ad for your music? That was pretty good. 8/10

Did you make this post to make advertisement for your music?
---
60 boost would be the biggest nail in the coffin blizzard has seen
---
on paper it feels like time spent walking from and to mobs areas can be spent grinding, and i don't enjoy breaking the flow of grinding to go somewhere else, so i guess grinding is better for me ?
---
Personally i'd love a 60 mage, but competition of finding a specific spot for 4-5 hours that is uncontested and the perfect mob type for mage to AOE grind is pretty difficult. Also their gears are really expensive.

I deleted the link just to prove it’s not about my music lol

If you're running UBRS with just one tank, that's on you.  Not sure what tactic you're using for Drakk though.
---
There is always a trade off.

Swap warriors for mages. Arcane magic is magic of order. So I see them as Lawful rather than neutral on that part. Warriors are literally just a class that is based off of being a guy with a weapon. Pure neutrality.
---
Druids are a good race. They protect nature and are one with life. They're neutral good.
---
Shamans aren't simple elementalists. An elementalist is partly what a Shaman is but Shamans use spirit magic. They're one with the spirit world and use their magic to heal and purify their people. As a Horde Shaman you're good but chaotic at best. There are Shamans like Thrall that are mighty fighters as well. Other Shamans that can use their power for more aggressive things. Chaotic for sure.
---
Wait is it really? Seriously asking.  I played hunter through MC in vanilla and never knew it was that.
---
I mean, that's unfortunate. But there is no way they will allow a word to be used that is so heavily related to racism. They would have to un-ban it for everyone and you know the trolls would take advantage.
---
Thanks! Hoping to level fairly quickly so I won’t have to think about it haha
---
I have my real name as an alt
---
Would you like my license photo with my home address instead?
---
I run BRD with my buddy who still uses ravager and he’s way better at holding aggro than any other tank. So, YMMV.
---
No, it doesn't.
---
in pve for short fights (&lt;5 min) +healing is better. Longer fights you can argue having incresaed mp/5 is beneficial. For PVP, stat padding is important.
---
People being carried are still expected to contribute. While some things may be possible to just sit there holding your dick it’s kind of rare that you don’t need to participate.
---
Yeah, so far it’s been a pretty good server. Lot of fun RP and good community on both sides. Minus a few jerks haha
---
My personal preference was/is/will be:
---
Crit, Int, +heal, MP5.
---
I liked having enough MP5 to literally spam a decent rank of FoL if it got that bad in a fight, but that's only truly helpful if you have enough +healing to make FoL strong enough that the few hundred points of healing it can do mean something.
---
Int affects crit and the size of your mana pool, and benefits from both BoK and the int talent, so, 10 points of int is more like 11-12.
---
So, get all the crit you can, then enough +heal to make a downranked FoL hit pretty hard, and then enough MP5 to be able to spam that rank.  Int will come pretty naturally from nearly everything that has those.
---
You should be able to mix in a lot of HL and of course, DF&gt;HL every two minutes, and get into a good cadence where you're basically OOM at the end of big bosses.
---
Honestly, you'll be in ST until 52. You'll have a hard time finding a group until then
---
Rogue gang.
---
Monster
---
Haha just messin’ with you. I’m sure that’s frustrating.
---
That's the thing with hunters. They can grind while walking. Anything they come across while walking between quests that's worth XP they kill while still moving.
---
With diremaul coming out I'm pretty sure mages can aoe grind inside it uncontested. But hunters can do neat stuff too.
---
The game was made for Dialup and non gaming PC's (less than a gig of ram, onboard videocards, shitty processor). Everyone knows what they are doing, their are guides and min max for everything.
---
When I was first clearning dungeons at 60 back in the day everyone was wearing their .5 sets. Now no one wears them because they are worse than brd gear. The game isn't undertuned, we are just better.
---
has it been seen yet in classic?
---
enjoy amigo.
---
if i can go 52-58 with a demonslayer (demonslaying enchant) i think you'll be just fine with destiny. blow a wad on crusader, get mark of the chosen trinket too.
---
It is important to remember itemization [the specific stats on items] is more important than the amount of stats or color of the item. Plenty of blue items and even some greens [green paladin plate healing bracers from DM for example] are better than the raid epics and will last you well into future phases of the game.
---
I get praised a lot when I tank, so what you're saying is probably true and there are a lot of bad tanks out there. Even though my runs are smooth, doesn't mean I don't constantly feel the pressure to keep going at a quick pace and to make room for the dps to go as hard as they can without losing aggro so they don't get bored, which is almost impossible sometimes. I love the playstyle, I hate the expectations people put on me. And the sinking feeling I get anytime I do lose aggro on a mob is the worst, except when it's another warrior, he can facetank one mob.

I mean to be fair that's like 95% of DPS classes in Classic...

This isn't statistics it's speculation.  Your comment makes no sense

Your character looks like Pete Davidson in drag.

I normally kill everything on my way to the quest I'm working on
---
My warlock travels Azeroth with her underdressed succubus BFF and picks flowers. Not an evil bone in her body! She only ever traps sentient souls in gems to perform dark rituals like 10 times an hour or so. It's nothing.
---
Making a feign death macro to put your pet into passive seems to help a lot. Perhaps even is practically necessary. Then I either use a trap macro (modifiers for the type of trap) to also put it back onto defensive, or just activate defensive later manually if I did want to legitimately feign rather than do it for a trap.
---
;-;
---
We don’t deserve kodos
---
Unless you take the spirit rez. Then it’s everything you’re wearing and in your bags. And you also don’t take durability damage if the final killing blow is dealt to you by an enemy player.

I've been playing since week 1, about 2 or 3 days in, and I've never had to wait for a queue. The whole "queue time issue" is a voluntary one.
---
A lot of people will do Princess, jump down to Rotgrip, then kill all the way up and around to Tinker.
---
The faster order is Princess, drop down to the bridge to do Tinker, and then double back and jump down to Rotgrip. At least, assuming you're using someone to reset and don't need to run all the way out each time.
---
Yeah. At this point I think I just need to look into setting a good price point for buying CDs from people. Assuming I really want to be a bag vendor lol.
---
go with the one you will enjoy more, clearing a raid fast feels good but I'd take twice as long to play with a fun group any day
---
Meme specs care.
---
Ya but it's a free spot in a bag.
---
I'm not sure how it worked in vanilla, but in Classic it doesn't quite work if your pet is still attacking. As far as I can tell your pet either MUST be passive or you must drop a trap before their next attack to be properly considered out of combat. Without passive their combat puts you in combat.

It’s not a bad chest piece but there’s other ones around. I replaced it pretty soon after I got it. There is a very nice chest piece from an elite Badlands quest around level 37 with 24 strength and 2 stam which I used until level 60.
---
Another reason to dislike mages /s
---
You’re gonna hit 60, get pre bis and raid each week or wait for pvp right? Most of the content is before 60 I’d pay to not skip it.
---
i'm currently doing mushroom strat as druid. Going inside from purple side, taking all mithirl and mushroom nodes, kill gizlock then repeat. I'm getting about 14 gold per run for all herbs and ores, and it takes 15 mins. I'd imagine with 30% movement speed i can do it in 12 and make much more.
---
Im getting my herb and mining to maxed for diremaul, assuming my strat is killing lasher then wandering around for nodes until the 12 minute mark hits.
---
Find the fightclub discord lots of good info
---
Nah, pugs now are better than Death and Taxes was then. Better PCS, better Internet, better Knowledge.
---
just in case someone reads this in the future having issues with shields/one h not equipping right.  You can throw a /equipitem  with specific item numbers. For whatever reason my macro would equip the weapon (even in the main hand) but the equip by shield name would unequip the main hand.
---
Yes
---
&gt; Paladins use crit to mana refund as their regen as healers. The only healer who super humps Mp5 are shamans who don't have other options.
---
Shaman get a better return on +healing than other healers and should be heavily emphasizing it - to the point where their T1 is almost useless without the 8-set bonus because it doesn't have enough +healing. The mana issue is dealt with by downranking.
---
Pfft... Obviously a troll post. There isn't even a 16th month.
---
It's not normally done on PVP server, funny you're talking down about him when you clearly have no clue yourself.
---
True, but I felt like this song really matched up
---
Yes take enchanting if you have NO OTHER USE for a second profession of course, but don't drop a 300 prof just to get a tiny increase in profits (If loads of people have stockpiled mats on your server and are about to dump them with release of DM you may even lose out on gold)
---
Part of the problem is probably also people watching streamers or tubers and trying to replicate it without knowing what they are doing. Like people thinking every group is a cleave group nomatter the comp, you could put 3 shadow priests as dps in a group, and some of the people I have played with would still stubbornly demand to pull big groups and aoe.
---
Hey, Thank you for the Tip! I'll keep that in mind for my next WOW vid. :)
---
U do realise there is a profanity filter for that?

I call it the BFA island. Some bad zandalar voodoo happened here and changed our perception of reality , but people snapped out of it at the end of August 2019.

And he can die as all three!

Oh yeah I've definitely killed a mob that then killed me due to spell batching or whatever. Had it happen a couple of times even in the same area. Pretty frustrating.
---
Its bis for hunters in phase 1....

is that correct?  wowhead lists much less mats   [https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=7114](https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=7114)

I totally can see the original version being underwater.

I miss Ultima Online

I play alliance on bigglesworth and im probably going to quit playing if i can't hit 60 before p2 comes out. It's already nearly impossible to level in contested zones (currently lvl 54). I actually don't think i will be able to level in EPL/WPL once P2 drops.
---
the icy veins arms leveling guide is excellent.
---
Iirc you vendor them, right?
---
I'm only 48 and I wou never skip most of the game

Play Hunter, can confirm am a wild child.

That's what I thought

Clearly Teremus tried to be the hero Stormwind deserves, only for Onyxia to make an example of him.
---
/spit
---
Yes, and that’s why the word is banned as a name? I’m not sure what point you’re trying to make here.
---
Probably not since it's considered a dot (can't crit).
---
From what I have experienced with blizzard, please let em take their time coding the key ring. Remember what happened with extra backpack slots?

Oh no

Lol I bet you get decent tips too.
---
Which you can turn off?

I moved to Askandi bc I couldn’t log on Pagke wo 5 hour wait. I’ve been happy where i am. Just hit level 50 on my main and working on a few alts. Ashkandi 
---
seems quite alive and robust so yeah op just wasn’t that into it.
---
That's the issue I thinks most ppl have. Everyone feels like when they ding 30 that they are halfway there; 40 is nice because the mount. What ppl don't realize is that, mathematically, half way to 60 is about LVL 44.
---
Because seeing big hits is more fun to me, rather than just spamming drain life
---
Shitpost
---
Probably not, so you could pull anything on the way. However, if a rogue stealths all the way you can probably ride the rogue and try to proc it on the boss. Maybe also doable if there are lots of critters on the way. Anyway, sounds like fun. Actually makes me wanna grind for the dagger now. INB4 I get it and it gets patched the day after lmao
---
I mean I know for me in retail, I was really only in guilds because they were doing mythic progression.
---
While classic isn't nearly as hardcore, there is still probably the attitude of 'I'm only here because you guys are good at wow and if someone comes along that is better at wow, I may join them'.

...didnt even read the post, did you?

If you picked a pvp server then suck it up.

Its the elemengal spec

Hahaha that would be awesome. Man I need to get me this little beauty before it gets fixed.
---
There are literally 0 requirements for tanking dungeons other than having mostly plate armor and a shield. Maybe for UBRS MTing you want 4.5k hp unbuffed.
---
My build is standard fury DPS and is fine for dungeons: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/30305001302-05050005525010051

I am grown. Practically lvled purely from aggravating people, that's why I'm so good at it.
---
99.99% agree.
---
Add "Good" to the Mages Chaotic good.  They're doing *good* DPS.  
---
I honestly wish I could replace DPS meters with Threat Meters.  Trying to explain why certain big damage cleave spells should be closers not openers is a non-starter too often.  The endorphins from winning meters rivals even the harshest scoldings.
---
Yeah I already quit. It was fun for a bit. But I don’t have the time or will to keep going
---
The number of people whining about this in week one, while in westfall, with level 20's forming groups, *with Dire Maul not in the fucking game yet* was obscene. 
---
Like.. what do you think people mean when they say "DM" in that situation?
---
way to miss the point.
---
Why dont you want them to see your talents?
---
robes of the exalted for sure and dm has a bunch of new gear for us tomorrow 
---
its a ballance tbh , you could in theory wear all +healing greens but then you have shit all mana or health 
---
im wearing a mix of epics / blues and 2 +healing greens ill replace tomorrow
---
your ability to use a few different ranks based off your gear is key too.
---
in theory you could just stack a heap of int and down rank less , or a heap of +healing and down rank more
---
we dont have much (other than buffs) access to it atm but personally i feel spell crit is a very high priority to us just because we get mana refund on crit
---
Hit 51 still having shit tons of fun. I missed out on vanilla raids due to hitting 58 a few days into tbc release.
---
You can turn it off... and still report people and get them in trouble for words that would have gotten caught by the filter.
---
Nope
---
How has the hunter experience been for you ?
---
For raids I just stopcast on the tank and spam drink when I do decide to let the heal off. Tossing a Rejuv or something would be cool but idk if it's necessary, MC is just so god damn easy with 25 non mouthbreathers. Hopefully BWL/ Naxx will be actually somewhat challenging, I never really played WoW before this but might actually check out retail cause it seems the boss fights there are more demanding
---
Pservers brought us elemental spec
---
Obviously he has. You don’t need to criticize him for not being level 60, he’s asking if anybody feels like this. Most people who have a job and family are around that point too levels 40-50 and it is taking too much of their time to get any higher or keep their interest. If you don’t relate to this, don’t criticize him for not getting to level 60 before he posted this.
---
Offhand weapons have 50% reduced damage and \~20% miss chance, and increase your mainhand miss chance to 14%.
---
Not accounting for the miss chance, you're looking at 25dps for dualwielding vs 21dps for the 2hander.
---
If we factor in the miss chances, it will look like this for your offhand+main hand damage 0.8(6)+ 0.86(19)  vs this for your 2hander   0.95(21)
---
That comes to 21.14dps for dualwielding auto-attacks vs 19.95 for 2hander; not accounting for any stats.
---
You can do this calculation at any time; 0.95\*(2hander damage)  vs 0.86(mainhand dps) + 0.4(offhand dps).
---
Sounds like a shadow priest who doesn’t want his guild to know he is shadow...
---
Well... their t1 set is an ele pvp set. Of course it's useless for healing (dat helm being the exception, it's sexy). As for plus healing only, that matters most on short fights where your healing capability doesn't matter much. Longer fights (2 minutes) start to heavily value Mp5.
---
It's not like this is a real discussion between all Mp5 and all HP. Your pre-raid choices in p1.5 are 300hp and 80mp5 or 500hp with 40mp5. Accounting for the potential of overheal, and critical fights stretching longer, it's far better to lose the +healing for more total spells.
---
The Hollowfang blade has a 1% chance drop, showing as 1.1 in Wowhead due to it's sample size, so the actual odds of you getting this twice are 1 in 10,000. 
---
The math behind this is simply the odds x odds, and in this case it's 1 in 100, so it's 100 x 100 = 10,000.
---
1 in 10,000 chance for you to get that back to back as both random numbers were generated independently.
---
I'm still not sure what point you're trying to make? Yes you can turn the filter off. The point is that if you don't like the content of someone's chat you can ignore them and not see it. That isn't possible with a name so they outright ban certain words and phrases.
---
I hit 60 on my hunter today. Within 2 hours I was in an MC pug, and won giant stalker belt and shoulders, and strikers mark. Mad luck.
---
Still not evil.
---
Imagine if there was 5 of this guy in a group. Would be amazing
---
As a note, no one was actually bitching. He ninja'd the last chest in Uldaman and that was his excuse for doing so.
---
You get teleported at the entrance is that right ?
---
It does? Do I need to enable it?
---
Also, in elvui there is party frames, raid and then raid-40.
---
For me by default raid is enabled and that works for 5 mans and ubrs. But when in in a raid I have to manually enable raid-40. Is that the same for everyone or should I nuke my install and start fresh?
---
I may have broke it by updating to a new version while I had the game running.
---
I give you this tip as someone who has a lvl 54 warrior, and has leveled every class to max level on retail......if you do not have a pocket healer to level with you every step of the way do not level a warrior. My classic leveling experience has been fairly fucking miserable, and i've kept ahead/on par with gear while leveling the entire time.
---
Go carry a flag
---
The escort quest at Quel'Danil lodge; getting Ren'ji out. You let him out of the cage, he walks about 100 yards out of the lodge, gets attacked by owlbears, and then goes away.
---
Honestly I’m running a prot warrior and holy priest combo with a friend and focus fire targeting results in more efficient and faster dungeons. 0 downtime bc priest is always above 50% mana and we clear every dungeon (WC, SFK, BFd, Gnomer etc) in 1 hour. Leveling my hunter, and it pains me to see 3 hour WC runs bc ppl try to aoe pull and your talking about 1 min downtime every pull. Let alone tank having a hard time keeping Aggro when AOE is happening so healer has to heal more. I’ve found focus firing single targets way smoother and faster. Yes it might be boring to most but as a tank it feels good to have a smooth run with 0 downtime
---
Yeah man. Spot on. Job and family. No time to Raid, I just want to PVP.
---
Then how have I not been banned yet
---
I do
---
Garrote is alright, if I recall at max level it’s like 550 or 650dmg over 18sec?
---
Ambush crits for 1300-1500 pretty easily, instantly. That’s why I wait for 80%, because a crit can chunk 10-15% of an elites HP.
---
Then after the first mob dies, you have like a 90% chance of crit on your next backstab, which usually hits for 780-900dmg on mob number two. This is assuming you have a tank of course.
---
I timed my energy ticks the other day, just before it popped I ambush crit what must have been a fresh 60 mage for almost 1500, landed a few auto attacks in the GCD then backstab crit for 900. Nearly an instakill before he realized it. Lucky double crits, but it’s FUN.
---
If that failed, vanish, try again. If that failed, prep+vanish, try again.
---
It works fine before people are fully geared, then the stunlocking game begins.
---
Exactly how I felt! Hit 40, got my mount. Felt like my classic experience was done after that.
---
Because the item has a 1% drop chance, so you would say it's probably you'd see the weapon after 100 kills. The actual chance of seeing the weapon drop twice consecutively is 1 in 10,000.
---
PSA: You’re wrong.  Tanks generally go Dual-wield fury so they can actually hold threat over competent DPS.  Mobs die faster = less mana spent.
---
AQ/Naxx will require a lot more co-ordination and should be fairly demanding, as they weren't widely cleared on retail when they released, even with 1.12 patch. 
---
Roughly 100 guilds worldwide were able to clear Naxx-40 before 2.0.1 prepatch was applied, and after that, only an additional 30 or so cleared before TBC came out
---
That’s awesome man. All in all, I’m glad you enjoyed your time. I had an absolute blast.
---
How the fuck is that ninjalooting? Its the other faction...when I could I would jump into a random raid encounter and fuck my enemys there up...
---
What do you think will happen when worldbosses are a thing?! Sure I cant loot them but when I have the chance I will join the fight, and not in a good way!
---
Grinding between select quests, as far as I understand.
---
Classic best was via mage with aoe grinding.
---
This is actually accurate for Vanilla, low-level hunters in particular and Twinks could deal decent damage to even a 60.
---
I’m in End Game. They’ve taken so many people in lately :/ Our core raid group is really good. I don’t even know 1/4 of the people in my own guild now
---
I had to check a whole bunch of 2005 / 2006 UBRS Videos to confirm and it seems like you are correct. They were all skull level, even in 10-Man version.
---
Tips on the warrior vs. Warlock pvp match up? I've been getting wrecked by warlocks 3 levels under me (I'm 45) and I can't seem to deal with them. If I berserker rage so they don't fear me, they just wait it out, then fear me. Am I just trash or is that just how the match up goes?
---
This guy's so mad that he's still lvl 52 on his pve server troll hunter, having died in the triple digits
---
Yeah back in the day i don't recall finding it too hard, but i leveled a rogue first so i guess that was pretty similar for the early 1-10 with a lot of melee misses/dodges etc so it wasn't until later i had a hunter/mage/lock to compare with
---
If you enjoy reading, read the lore. It'll pull you into the world and make it more immersive and enjoyable. Also, don't be afraid to play different classes.
---
I must be doing something wrong with my gold farms as I'm not making much. I havent seen 4 digits yet. Ahh well, in due time:)
---
A mage on my server was killing devilsaurs and letting the corpses expire with loot on them was great .
---
I went with the cop from John Wick
---
As such as you seems to be reasonable and I feel for you, this room shouldn't be done without the quest item.
---
 I tank a scholomance with Janice yesterday day with two warlock. The two lock ask me nicely once we zone in the instance for killing the boss. 
---
As tank, I know schololance as the "long ass dungeon" with ton of " line of sight" pull pack, so I promise that if the group are still in good shape by then, why the heck not?
---
As like all the pug dungeon without mage, we wipe couple times when people body pull extra mob because impartience of "Los" pull.
---
After killing the lich boss, the locks mention that we could try "the room". As much as that healer and I tired(3 wipes), I give it a try. These scholomance students has 3+ time the hp, dodge twice more attack than I could spam overpower. After two packs (8mobs), we called it and just move to the last room after accidentally pull 6 student and wiped us.
---
As a group, we agreed that no sane group is expected to clear that without the quest item.
---
Absolutely. I feel the same exact way you do. There was a couple times people were able to quest with me and I would be talking shit and having a good time.
---
It really helped that I found an awesome guild too.
---
DM is for Dire Maul
---
dm is for Deadmines, as it is a lower level and doesn't deserve capitalization.
---
Well a key-ring is flavour
---
Also, it was in classic as well albeit not at the start. A keyring existing does not negate or prevent RP for having keys.

I had a warrior the other day who said they were dps and wouldn't tank, but they used a sword and shield...

Try writing the line to equip the shield first and then in the next line equip the weapon.

I love it. I literally just come in blasting and my pet does most of the damage! Even as a kid I was a hunter just because I thought it was so cool you could get a pet. And I’m not really a social guy so I’m usually alone and a pet makes me feel like I got a partner lol. Hows being a shaman? I’m interested in making an alt and can’t decide between shaman or Druid.

It's amazing for threat (druids main threat gen is maul which occurs on auto swing), after which you can swap to your +armour weapon.

Nah for the most part, fighting is going to end up going specific places.  TM vs SS was popular because of GY locations, apart from that kargath/searing gorge/brm is a big one.
---
&gt;Yeah, like, it's almost as if they are creatures that want not bad things happen to the to they act accordingly ( like preserving the balance), right?
---
The thing is DnD Druids would also intervene in the other direction, i.e. if someone tips too far in favor of good.

They may also favor an unjust and oppressive but nature-loving baron for "ultimate good", which obviously does not jive with Chaotic Good at all.
---
You're not gonna beat a Warlock unless they are horrible, just try to avoid them
---
On mobile. Clicked link no way to zoom in from what I can see. I can’t read it either. Can anyone transcribe it for us?

Just curious why does princeas help with phase 2
---
rupture isn't worth unless you're specced into sub
---
Hopefully youre already questing with questie.
---
I started using a guide when i started to be burned out. Check out guidelime, i use bustea's guide. Helps a lot, he make you do the best quest in the best zone at that level onto the next. Really well done imo
---
Glad I could help!
---
Awesome! Phase 3 can't come soon enough.
---
Just out of curiosity if you play retail, how long does it take to get to level cap? It felt annoyingly long to get even though I picked druid and mage, the consensus 2 fastest 60s (not counting Hunter cause ewww Hunter) and I'm one of those people who hate the story/levelling process. Is it possible to buy lvl 120?
---
i don't think it's better due to not knowing if the group will have a rogue, if the rogue will have a high enough locking picking skill.
---
i can store them in the bank but they are still taking up valuable real estate.
---
I would actually have preferred no keys to exist and either have rogues sell their ability to open doors or become a key group member or have profession/s have the ability to make keys.
---
How do you summon him?  I never figured that out.
---
Looks great! What are you using?
---
HoTW/NS, given the lack of tanks I am going through feral first.
---
Lol I’m in End Game. Petty on both ends, y’all hurt each others feelings. The 150g thing was funny as hell tho.
---
Also being able to aoe pull is nice.
---
Yeah it was a trip down memory lane that’s for sure
---
No, im not even halfway
---
Can i have ur list of low health low armour plz
---
I didn’t have that power, so I just gquit
---
Mage here, I've been doing that since my RFC.
---
Congrats man - great achievement!
---
Is your run going up on [wowchallenges.com](https://wowchallenges.com) for Iron CLASSIC?  
---
I think the only additional requirement is that your kill ratio needs to be over 75% - should be good to go as it's only a yellow flag
---
You must put in very little time to be just 23.  Why are you so concerned about fast leveling?  You have what would take about 20 hrs played over the course of a month and a half.  You should not be concerned about fast leveling if that is your pace.  I mean you can try to level fast but don't let it get you down that you are lower than most because they put in much more time than you do and you can't overcome that.  Find what is fun and you like doing.  If you had fun with the fast levels make an alt and play another class to 20 then repeat until you feel passionate about one of those characters and want to go further.  Point is, if you're not having fun change it up, the leveling only gets slower.
---
He's not wrong though, but probably not completely right either.  You start out with the stoneshield potion up and use your 2h or dual-wield weapons to build lots of threat...but you then switch to 1h/shield once the pot wears off.
---
yeah, for me it would then replace the shield until I specified item id
---
I leveled to 44 on my rogue, really did not enjoy the class, rerolled and yesterday my warlock hit 60. No regrets.
---
Damn bro, your already playing WoW on easy mode being Horde and you can't figure out how to get out with a command?
---
Hey man, mage raid rotation requires technical and mechanical savvy like no other. These frostbolts don't cast themselves!
---
What minimum level should I be for dps in Dire Maul?
---
Ask both guilds about the importance they place on spelling :P
---
This. I waited two days after launch for a new pvp east realm to open. I went benediction. High pop no queues since day one. Sounds like you were following the hype and wouldve stopped playing anyway.
---
If you still want to play, its never too late anyway
---
Best game ever. Just be prepared to never speak to your family or friends again
---
Yeah it’s kind of depressing how miserable some people are that they look forward to bothering other players every night.
---
Thats it, of two jale with u!
---
So this works for default frames, and it's built into luna, and it seems elvui has a similar feature, but do they all talk to each other, and can healcomm work on other frames (like shadowed unit frames?)
---
That's my thought, with DM coming out tomorrow mages can get even more + hit but to get capped will take a few phases
---
Lashers is just fine, you can do dogs and make more money if you like however lashers drop herbs you can make into potions and flasks anyway so it kinda evens out.
---
Indeed
---
Escorting the Night Elf in northwestern Feralas. Follows at your pace and only occasionally needs to be brought back to focus. When I did it she only went astray once, letting me finish it in half a minute
---
Check flair, usually on the side bar
---
It's PvP realm. Not an edgy shithead for fucking with someone of the opposite faction. We're the same level. If it's red it's dead. Why should I gladly let a hunter get a sizeable power increase to further kill my faction? 
---
This carebear shit of ... "Oh he's on the epic bow quest I should leave him be" is the shit for retail. Fuck that. If he's going to continue trying I'm going to continue killing him. He's free to try when I'm not around. 
---
You think this is some isolated bullshit that didn't happen in vanilla? Fuck no. 
---
Be mad idgaf really. Not gonna change anything either.
---
Don't paladins love crit healing for extended fights?
---
Thats a good idea, thanks!
---
That's probably a better record than any of my characters, you did well lol
---
I’ve loved it ever since I started in WotLK and picked back up in MOP. If you choose to play find some friends to play with while grinding! It’s fun solo but nothing beats a group of friends grinding together
---
No, ive just a lot of it online.
---
Classic best also had heavy use of layering though.
---
It’s a great game. It’s just extremely time consuming even in classic there is always something to do. From leveling or farming gear. To professions and gold making. To helping guildies or leveling alts. To pvp. It’s what you make out of it.
---
FWIW, shadowed UF will not support healcomm, as he claims it's based on a copyright violating library (and he doesn't support that).
---
bc will come out, you will lvl to 67 and leave again, so why botter? LOL
---
Whats cringe?
---
If you're entirely sure you turned the quest in. That would be a bug. Under all normal circumstances you should not be able to complete a quest without bring able to accept the reward.
---
Submit a ticket.
---
&gt; obviously a male.
---
yeah...
---
He said he used it for the last 1.5 hours, and it was streamed so you could verify it.
---
I did not care to verify it, but I didn't see anyone dispute it.
---
Love it lol and great audio!
---
Pretty sure raid-40 is the only type of raid in classic.
---
I'm justified cause he's the other faction. If you didn't want to get PvP combat during quests go pve. The realms exist. Getting mad you're getting killed while doing a quest is retarded. I had a hunter rape me in blasted lands while leveling a few times. Know why? I was fighting those stupid scorpids with a 30s poison and couldn't stealth so I'd be eating at ~50% hp and he'd come from the woodwork and kill me. Sucked. I'd get frustrated but it's what happens.
---
&gt; There is a 21.3% chance that you will get that weapon during the 15 kills required for the quest.
---
That is the part I don't agree with.
---
Technically though on 3 targets blizzard IS more mana efficient than frostbolt.
---
Begging for gold
---
Latency was a real problem back then. Most people who died made it through just fine on their screen.
---
Looks like you have your AOE farming shield on just treat it like you’re wowhobbs soloing SM
---
None of these things will be fixed by a tank equipping a shield though.
---
Interesting. My characters name is Cameltoetem as well.
---
No, he laughed all the way to the bank! Mithril Bound Trunks are no joke.
---
This is why prot pally is the tank to go to for groups with mages; their can keep aoe threat better than a warrior and their downtime isn't a big deal.
---
Each night as I'm about to log, I type in guild chat (am alliance):
---
bout to log, who wants to join me for some infernal shenanigans. Who should I drop it on? AH in IF? Goldshire? Anywhere better?
---
yeah, chaotic evil checks out
---
Thanks !
---
I would need to contact the administrator for this, as there is no "tracker" for Iron Classic... But I don't know if it will be possible
---
I have way over 75% kill ratio so that would not be a problem anyways.
---
Exactly. If I don't attack you during a quest make no mistake ... I'm simply choosing to not attack you. A whim or wild change of fancy could flip that. I might see you tomorrow doing the same thing and kill you 3-4 times. 
---
I'm sure as shit not going to let someone walk through and get a major power increase ain't cause it's some "epic solo quest". This is what vanilla was about.
---
Do you get enough essences this way? Weapons have higher chance of essence, armor higher chance of dust
---
I'm a 60 unguilded mage with full preraid bis and have a pvp set but now I'm bored. I want to raid but I always get kicked cause there's too many mages in the raid or raid leader wants to get their guilded mages in instead. The good guilds on my server have too many mages and aren't taking anymore in. I'll admit it was very fun for 2 months.
---
After the main hand swing animation on your character
---
A mage drinking = I finally get to have aggro
---
Is hit % gear a big deal when leveling? Or is that mainly for raids?
---
PSA: Depends on group.
---
If running w/ nubs..
---
Absolute cringe
---
Thank you I will give this website a check :) That looks interesting. It almost seems like you want a balance then between int/+heal as they're 1:1 (in the image anyway).
---
And yes I'd love spell-crit, GIMME IT ALL!
---
Just because they are the enemy doesn't mean you have to fuck them over every single time you see them. Fighting for world bosses is one thing, but killing a mob and having the skin stolen is kinda bullshit. You worked for the kill, so why should it be taken away from you?
---
So then is there a healcomm from SUF author that works in classic?  Or is it only the stolen luna branch?
---
I was a resto shaman healing near the whelp cave and got melee’d by her twice and insta died, during phase 2. 2500 dmg twice in a row.
---
Could swap them and shammys maybe? The chaos of the elements
---
Once you have sword spec/HoJ/Thrash Blade, you should be timing your SS's right after a swing so that if an extra attack is proc'd it won't interrupt a mid timed white swing. Sword spec procs (and the like) reset your swing timer and by timing your specials, you can avoid this.
---
Great to see this quote
---
Yeah good point at least leveling you use all types of stuff
---
Good point. Lol
---
Herbalism or mining imo
---
I've never heard of them getting involved, camping NPCs is why they made Dishonorable Kills a system, but that's about all I've ever heard.
---
We had a priest who got the (similar) Vael ability cast on her right before the fight ended - which you (importantly) got more lead time before dying, and (more importantly) made all your spells instant. After the boss was down, she ran over to the designated death area, insta-rezzed as many people as possible, most of them just accepted out of habit, she blew up and re-killed them all. We couldn't even be mad.
---
Time to either reroll or move on bro. Or wait for PVP and give it a go.
---
oh damn, so you can't even be healed during it? Not that you would need to, i suppose if you are banished you are probably immune to further damage. Didn't realize this, thanks for the info!
---
The game is pretty social-dependent so if you're not making friends to play with it gets pretty boring yes
---
Yeah herb it mining is your best bet.
---
I have never heard of that ever. But I stopped playing in Pandaria. As people said, there's talents in the talent trees for healers that are all about crit. Priest's inspiration procs off crits. 
---
I was just curious. It seems like something very easily disproven.
---
Its either in your bag, you didn't get item for that quest or its a bug. If its a bug, submit a ticket brother
---
Warlocks die a lot in groups. He'll learn.
---
I love the way you've done this. Congrats
---
I'm a no-lifer and my interest waned at 40. I'm forcing my way through, 51 right now. I want to stop but I can't because of how close I am to 60.
---
the place with the trees, *God.*
---
Realistically what can I get for staff of Jordan? I just had one drop at 39 in stv... I'm a hunter (I know, sorry) so it's not super useful. I just don't know value as it isn't on the auction house and Google is saying all sorts of things. I'm on alliance myzrael pve server if it makes a difference.
---
right when it starts filling back up
---
You are absolutely correct, but that second part is completely irrelevant because it's not a guild. There's no set raid team or consistent loot distribution, and there's significantly more guilds that HAVENT downed rag than there are those that have.   
---
If END GAME fills their 3 raid teams and have all content on farm, they would be one of the "strongest" guilds on their server. That speaks to the guilds overall health because it means it's not fracturing over loot disputes and internal drama.    
---
Since we're at the beginning stages of the game and raid difficulty is literally at the bottom, it can't really be used as a metric for how "good" a guild is, but all the management aspects of a guild is still very much relevant.
---
Negative Nancy here
---
How are you liking the shaman? It’s been my main since vanilla and I love finding new players who enjoy it.
---
You're going to have to give up on the sex if you want to play WoW.
---
Do you use thistle tea?
---
Just if anyone reads this - tame a new pet.
---
4 loyalty levels + 1 experience level - still nothing.
---
Goddamn, I just got my lock to 48 and I feel like I’ve been playing forever. I can’t imagine stopping 4 levels ago and then leveling another class to 60.
---
Thats a tough choice...
---
Few days ago questing with random guy see a rogue stealth but didn't catch level. Tell group mate not to pull but he does so anyway, instagibbed. It's a skull rogue and I'm a 24 lock. Immediately casted fear and attempted to dot up. Fear and dots land and the damage doesn't even move his hp bar. He comes towards me and murders my pet then leaves. I'd like to think my attempt earned his respect to spare me.
---
Which would make the continuation scenario "Classic+" that much imperative. Otherwise, its just like trying to turn the clock 14 years back :P
---
It’s normal to pay for BiS runs. Just usually not 400g...50g would sound more reasonable for the Reed. I ran UBRS 40 times to get that and would’ve gladly paid some gold instead.
---
Agi does give ap but it gives 1 per agi instead of 2 per with str.
---
35 runs only seen it once. Lost on that roll.
---
As a rogue the weapon you wield is the most important thing. So grabbing new swords or daggers is always hype. Plus they're great st both pve and pvp. Super fun class
---
Oof, too relatable.
---
I love You
---
I love you both
---
No worries. Good advice though.
---
Mobs will do this to my rogue when kiting with crippling poison. 3 auto hits at once.
---
Same, would love to know what the entire bottom of gold, bagspace, spells, chat and loot menu is
---
This is a weird thing to ask for and I'm curious to know where you got this idea even from? I'm not aware of any RPG game that has a mechanic to stop you from getting xp wth?
---
Why would you take warriors in your groups? If I join a group with a warrior I leave. As tanks we can have whatever group we want
---
those nameplates are dope, how do i get these?
---
&gt;I was just curious. It seems like something very easily disproven.
---
Literally why would I make something so silly up? And why do you feel you have to disprove it? Legit there's no reason for you to talk to me like that, all I did was answer your question.
---
My classic leveling experience as a warrior (29) has been great.
---
I’m prot, so I’ve got last stand. I use it pretty much every 10 minutes. It’s incredibly clutch.
---
I dual wield, and I stack sunders, so my dps is fine.
---
I’m alchemy, so I’ve got more healing potions as backups.
---
I’m undead, so I’ve got cannibalism to regen between fights.
---
I leveled cooking, so I’ve got extra food.
---
I dual wield tank dungeons. In defensive stance, rage and aggro aren’t bad, especially with some blue gear from said dungeons.
---
Also, I took improved revenge. It’s terrific. The dps rotation is something like blood rage, demoralizing shout, sunder x3 or x5 until they’re at half, rend, revenge when it procs, build up rage for the next mob, and when I get it, swap to a 1h/shield and shield slam, then swap back to dual wielding while it’s on cool down.
---
Lastly, I try to stick with green quests and mobs. They’re way easier to deal with.
---
Let me know if you’ve got questions, I’m happy to help.
---

Stack overflow
---
jesus those health and mana bars, why
---
Questing + grinding en route is without a doubt the fastest. All of the best routes have grinding integrated at certain points. Grinding can be most warranted (from an efficiency view point) on classes that lack mobility (grinding mid to late 30s to secure mount at 40). *A properly spec’d Hunter has 36% movement speed Cheetah at 21.*
---
With that said, I still very much enjoyed grinding from 29 to 44 so far on my Hunter as racing for server first or similar was not an option for me.
---
I feel like "the halfway point on exp to 60 is 44" is kind of misleading because, while it's factually accurate, it's almost always used to imply that the last 16 levels take as much time as the first 44 when that's totally not the case. Quest and mob exp also increase as you level up, so you get a lot more experience from collecting ten bear asses at level 50 than at level 30.
---
It helps that, minus perhaps frost warding, every single talent in there is amazing.
---
Nope. They WOULD be if the +15 Agility enchants were available, but they’re not. Peacemaker is better, and come tomorrow Barbarous Blade will be the new BiS.
---
No, but our tanks have no trouble keeping aggro in phase 3.
---
*forever*
---
REST IN HEAVEN
---
Is this with deathwish+recklessness?
---
Rank 3 at lvl 36 I believe
---
It looks fucking cool.
---
How did you have a white hat? Just doing dungeons to level and never had a drop? Because by 45 I had multiple green hats drop from mobs and many from quests. I’m not giving you a hard time I’m just curious.
---
Nah we were all around 40-42.
---
Just have to kite a bit more, but it went fine. My pet tanked pretty well (carrion bird).
---
Do you stay in Berserk stance the while fight?
---
I whisper them and let them know Thrall would be very disappointed.
---
In order to be eligible for loot from Princess in BRD you need to have completed the quest chain to save her.
---
This is because Princess actually does not have a loot table; in an instance where all 5 members have saved Princess will be replaced by a generic Priestess mob. That mob holds the loot.

Lol 60 is where it’s at. PvP comes in soon too. Who stops at 50. I’ve been 60 rogue for like two weeks and it’s more enjoyable now. Raiding, getting best in slot, pvping
---
*You better run through the jungle...*
---
Small brilliant shard are only 50silver on benediction. Should of vendor-ed it, like all those Locks and hunter's solo farming mara.
---
Had a group do that so I told them to do stuck so I could res them and our tank, who felt this was a waste of his time, hearthed back to Barrens and walked back to RFC. I hated him
---
What thinking is there with threat?
---
It's literally "spam Shadowbolt and wait if the number on tiny threat is too high".
---
Channeling that true 2004 spirit.
---
brah you're a druid, even if you're not feral spec or wearing feral gear.... use your bear form.   
---
cast Dots, bear form, bash, jump out/root/heal/dot, back into bear, rinse and repeat  
---
Are you levelling or are you at 60? I am 100% not telling you how to play, spec whatever you want but if you want to make your life easier level as Feral/NS resto. You can heal/dps/tank any dungeon. balance dps is a joke and resto isn't useful until phase 3 at least. You get WAY more mana from heart of the wild which is far superior than imp regrowth
---
Swords are usually slashing weapons. Usually.

What did I miss, exactly? Are we not discussing dungeon pulling and mana management?

---
Sorry Cloth* not sure what happened there.
---
Barrens chat
---
I can, but it's still pretty boring; and it's why I run 6pc shadowcraft even though I have pre-bis. Take distract off your stealth bar and save yourself wipes in every dungeon by distracting patrolling mobs mid combat. That is really about it. Keep snd up, ss/evis only right after a mh aa, use AR/BF on CD unless a particularly important fight/pull is coming up, use evasion to offtank mobs that won't 1 shot you, ks mobs to avoid enrages or shift mechanics like the scholo mobs that become physical immune. There isn't that much to do. But you pump dps and never oom. That's the reality of rogue in classic. Burn hard on mc bosses/ony and vanish to completely wipe aggro and keep burning.
---
This is how I got the Yeti Fur quests done in Feralis. You can skin the quest item.
---
Looks like your character ate glue as a kid in class
---
at the start of classic, there was a bug which made you get extra xp in raidgroups...
---
But in a dungeon, DPS on boss doesn’t matter, you’re thinking of raids..
---
I hope no ones spending more than like 5g on that thing
---
Is it a waste of his time if he's enjoying it? It's no more a waste of his time to gank you than it is a waste of your time to play the way you want.
---
Why
---
If you can get the gear for it, which is the hard part while leveling, there's way more non-dagger options so your dps will probably be higher non-dagger until later anyway
---
I'm not Singaporean a lot of my guildies are though.
---
Before the release of Classic I joined a semi HC guild that has their own private server on which they practice fights before each raid is released and will use it to practice for speedruns later on.
---
Practicing on the private server is mandatory to avoid wasting everyone's time and gold during progression, so that is one major way how HC guilds today will avoid a lot of drama.
---
Makes you think, semi HC guilds are actually more hardcore then HC guilds of vanilla in many aspects
---
whenever i see these things i think to myself, the person who made this has no idea what the alignments actually represent
---
then i try to think about how i would do it, and i don't really get it either.
---
It's a really good trinket, so stick with your plan. Enchanting mats are cheap right now anyways
---
Ahh ok they didnt seem that hard to me. We managed to quite effectively kill 3-4 of them at once.
---
Long live the three minute mage!
---
I got a spot saved for that pvp trinket.
---
Dude butchered the delivery. Nice shop tho
---
So that's what the warlock's eye spell is for...I thought it was completely useless
---
Not sure why the downvotes. I thought the same thing.
---
Classic + is really taking an interesting turn.
---
People finally understand the power of druids, feelsgoodman.
---
Honestly, combat swords is the highest dps melee in all our raids. This is a server first ony/rag guild.
---
Ohh do Kang the Decapitator Next
---
Afaik it's more of a twink item, so it may be worth holding onto it until battlegrounds are closer.
---
Yup, But the whole point is I don't expect them and i'm fine with not getting a tip. But these people get mad if they aren't tipped lmao
---
That’s a bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it pays off for him.
---
Mages don't really have a belief system though, while druids are trying to protect the world, so I'd say the druid is more likely to be "good".
---
He only cares about gold and castles, And as a rogue main i would say thats accurate.
---
The difference between this and blackstone ring is you're paying at minimum four people for their time and that's why this isn't viable. There just aren't going to be enough clients. This is going to work out to 10g an hour for them.
---
ANY BODY SEEN REXXAR?
---
’S all in the game
---
There's a turtle escort quest in Tanaris where you have to escort it across literally the entire map. I got ganked right at the end the other day. Fucking rogues.
---
100% worth
---
Lol what?
---
so wholesome
---
Assuming you have Tactical Mastery, you'll charge first; if you're under 25 rage, switch to zerker stance, if you're over 25 rage, sunder to put yourself under 25 rage, then switch to zerker stance.
---
Then you use Berserker Rage and sunder until the mob has 5 sunders or is under 50% hp. At this point, cast whirlwind, until you can cast execute.
---
If at any time you are dodged and are under 25 rage, switch to battle stance, overpower, then switch back to zerker. If you are over 25 rage, cast a spell to put you under 25, switch, overpower, switch back to zerker.
---
DM would be Dire Mail if I’m not mistaken, thus the “VC”
---
Thing about "swords" is that's it's actually slow sword/ fist/mace MH, anything off-hand while leveling. 
---
daggers is Slow dagger MH, fast weapon OH.
---
So it's a lot more restrictive.
---
Why? Explain the VC?
---
Fair point. Guess it won't really work.
---
Is &lt;Final Boss&gt; the one that was on Dark Iron?
---
He is advertising his personality, and showing he knows his weaknesses. Instant invite.
---
Sinister strike spam is so fucking boring too.
---
Ogra?
---
Yeah but if you had to go with the default attitudes of the people who are that role in the game, it's pretty accurate.  
---
Warlocks aren't ALL evil, they're just more likely to be.
---
Me: Pfff... I still remember my TBC binds by heart.
---
According to shadowpanther's list, Zeal, Dal and Krol are vastly better than Thrash.
---
You can try simming it yourself using ClassicSim, but I heard it doesn't provide accurate results for Thrash Blade (doesn't proc on abilities).
---
"This is super easy but I'd never do it because ~~I can't~~ it's just pathetic to even try."
---
To be fair, by the time most alliance get to hillsbrad they have been in other contested zones and start the quests at a higher level than horde. So most alli that gank in that zone does it out of revenge/spite from the previous zone they were outnumbered and ganked by horde. Vicious circle sadly
---
Named for its final boss, VanCleef
---
Lawful evil is tywin lannister.  Does things they know are bad, don't care, but believe in a system, usually one that puts them on top.
---
this is nice, i should prolly do this on my next alt
---
But that’s not the final boss?
---
Far as I'm aware, the world first leaders were so far ahead that wouldn't be viable.
---
Definitely the people who followed shortly after benefitted.
---
Thanks that would be great. Got crazy lucky with this.
---
3 piece nightslayer is pretty great too, -30s off vanish cooldown.
---
You thought you wanted it, but you didn't.
---
Isn't that a mushroom?
---
It's literally a game about war lol deal with it
---
Plugger is super easy to solo if you LOS his casts around the wall, near the barrels. 
---
Don't stand too close to the barrels as he will bug and run to the middle of the room. 
---
I was soloing him from level 57 when bored to get a shanker. Never saw a shanker after 20+ kills and ended up getting perditions blade on my first rag kill. Still no HoJ after 31 kills on Angerforge. 
---
Don't eat immolates, vanish if you are cutting it close and reset the fight.
---
You're playing in their world where they are judge, jury and executioner. Stop being a whiny shit. They have 0 reasons to appease your idiotic whine.
---
take it that way if you want, but that's clearly out of context. I just wanted it to be fair. Either a /roll or something to say, "yeah we value fairness in our guild"
---
After all the layering bans and alt switching, I for sure wouldn't be doing this lol....
---
Isn't this considered Sexist and against Blizzards ToS?
---
Just link the ability in chat.
---
Dude everyone was 41-42. The fuck are you on about me being carried.
---
Childish and young at heart are not the same
---
With a single treasonous undead rogue. Who would've thought?
---
dungeon =/= raid
---
most of them will be dps as there seems to be a glut of war's. my guild has 5 wars at 60 out of 15 total. granted we are small and still have a lot of people to get to 60 but if that's any indication...
---
&gt; “dps on boss is what matters” kinda person
---
So, frost? Frost is objectively better for raid dps. Even if it weren't just do the math, how much time do you spend leveling fighting bosses vs non elite mobs? You're just slowing yourself and your party down.
---
As far as I know, he used that bug to get ahead and cheated via layering to avoid pvp + the 58-60 grind
---
sorry I'm spamming all your comments :/   
---
100% whoever said this in your guild is a BAD druid player and you should continue to ignore everything they say from here on out. HoTW is hands down the best levelling spec and just one of the best specs in the game for druids for phase 1/2 and 3 kinda.   
---
My homework for you is to:
---
1: respec feral if you are really concerned about survivability and PvP (ps it gets worse the higher your level... so you just should)  
---
2: now you're a feral main spec, get a healing offset (which you probably have) and carry it with you everywhere.   
---
3: learn how to cat form dps - you will spend most of your time levelling in cat
---
4: look up what powershifting is because if you end up going for HoTW/NS resto you will spec 5/5 furor which is mandatory.   
---
5: learn how to bear. you have an interrupt (bash), an enrage (umm enrage, lol), a charge (feral charge, its amazing), a debuff (demo roar), an aoe threat generator (swipe) and one of the strongest single target threat generators in the game (maul). You may not like tanking, but you need to learn the basics. You're a druid and we are a swiss army knife, don't neglect the bear.  
---
6: finally work on your keybinds and macros. For keybinds do stuff that makes sense and is easy to remember. E.g. I have de-CURSE as C and remove poison as shift C. Spammable abilities as E (Entangle or shift E natures grasp) and Q (e.g interrupts), caster skills 1-5 and the mouse over macro version as shift 1-5 (mouse over macros allow you to cast on whatever your mouse is on without having to actually target them. My OH SHIT buttons are F so tranquility (F), innervate (shift F), barkskin (ctrl F). The key to keybinds is tricking your brain into remembering them, I try to have skills that having starting letters relate to the keybind, or I have stuff that is easily reached my spam skills. All of my powershifting keybinds are bound to my mouse buttons so I can shift instantly.   
---
Finally, macros. These are the game changer. you can macro a health pot in between powershifts for e.g. So all in one global you shift out of form, use a pot, shift back into form. Or you use mouse over macros for your heals/remove curse/remove poison so you can stay locked onto your tank but can very very quickly drop a heal  or whatever on anyone else without loosing focus on your tank. You can macro all of your heals/remove curse/remove poison to /cancelform so you that you can cast them when your shapeshifted and it will drop you out. You can macro shifting into cat and immediately stealthing, the list goes on.  
---
macros are easy as. Find someone who has them already typed up in a guide or a list. Go into the menu in game, go to macros. Create new. name it, find the right icon for it and then paste the specific macro command into the box. Drag that macro button from your list and put it into an action bar and you're done.   
---
This is my version of the HoTW/NS resto  
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/01-505001130322214-05501310501](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/01-505001130322214-05501310501)   
---
I drop one point from HoTW to pick up natures grasp. Its a mandatory pvp talent. Thick hide is trash and doesn't scale with bear form, don't listen to people who tell you it does, they're wrong. Feral instinct is much much better and makes bears threat generating monsters - anyone who tells you bears cant make threat should also go on your ignore list. Imp bash is a waste IMO, 3s is already enough. This build gives you the best bear talents for tanking and gives you most of the talents needed for cat dps in the open world - no imp shred makes you worse in groups but its not that bad. In resto you get 5/5 furor for power shifting, 5/5 imp healing touch, tranquil spirit and reflection - all great healer talents. Insect swarm is great for PvP and farming, 1/2 imp enrage is great again for pvp so you have an on demand rage button to pull of a charge or bash. Finally you get natures swiftness for your on demand burst heal.  
---
take your time, learn your keybinds and macros, learn druids strengths (and our weaknesses, we have a lot) and you will become a much better player
---
This looks so clean! What addon you using to get the extra bars? Bartender?
---
Ive tried it at 55 or so and it was ok but I couldnt open all the chests without agroing the boss.I still have a lot of keys I bought cheap from the AH. I should try it again at max level to see how profitable it is.
---
Gr8 b8 m8
---
This is the best way to do it. Muscle memory is a thing and having all of your similar abilities on the same keybind between all characters/games gives you a faster reaction time.
---
There was a mage bitching at me here on reddit that tanks are bad if they can't hold aoe aggro over a mage opening with CoC into blizzard. There are some people who you aren't going to reach unfortunately.
---
remember the pantless tanks?
---
An item that is an upgrade for someone, TRUMPS, your need for gold!
---
That is why people get pissed at you....  You want gold?  Fucking farm it!
---
Is it really 80/20 Herod like you're saying? 
---
Sure as fuck feels like it when questing on prime time.
---
Stable 120-150g item on my realm for quite some weeks now.
---
Its sounds like your still trying to strong arm them into giving you something, also I agree with the other post here there seems to be a ton of missing information.
---
5 levels later: "Guys I ran out of quests"
---
Thanks for pointing this out. Weird, all the runs I've been on have been downing Rend super fast then.  Makes me sad we don't get to see these mechanics because we're too efficient.
---
&gt;you've got a 47% kindness meter based off every comment you've ever left, or a 5.1% controversial percentage overall
---
full retard engaged
---
Blind is huge. I set it up with a mouseover macro bound to a thumb button on my mouse, that way you can blind an opponent in a 2v1 situation without changing targets and losing combo points.
---
Don't sleep on thistle tea either. That shit has won me several extremely close fights.
---
A couple addons like an energy tick bar and a debuff timer are SO helpful for maximum efficient stunlocking.
---
FRKHZMODNNN!!
---
Rogues are fun, but combst rogue weapon progression is mostly this:
---
- Wingblade
---
- Outlaw Sabre
---
- Sword of Omen
---
- Vanquisher Sword
---
- Thrash Blade (later Mirah's Song)
---
At level 60, some rogues farm Dal'Rend set and others go straight to raiding for Brutality/Vis'Kag. But I'd say a rogue with Engi is the most fun class to play, just get a good trinket swap addon.
---
Should see a key bind option in the main menu. Under add one I think.
---
so few good dps in classic atm, everyone is a rtard rushing in and aoeing thinking they are unkillable.
---
at least w/ 2h wars have a chance at keeping threat.
---
lmao
---
I haven't actually knew about both of these, but that's because I've been playing only private servers for over a decade, and these mechanics did not work/exist in a single one.
---
I just use the default
---
This is really a great project, but I don't seem to find a version without a flight line.
---
If you die, you have to start the character over. Read the rules.
---
That works if you aren't hardcore. As someone who got hardcore into PVP way back when (I stopped playing after Cata), coming up with a clean, efficient keybind setup was \*really\* important, and it takes time to build the instinctual reactive memory of your binds you need to compete. Starting off with those binds "right" immediately means you don't have to spend time re-learning them once you have the full set of abilities.
---
I probably had 30ish keybinds, with 20 or so being high-priority ones. Bandages, potions, various bombs (I did a lot of world and Battleground PVP) add quite a few binds.
---
Oh I'm farming it alright :)
---
Is there a list / a table / addon where you see which skills of any class scale with what? The tooltip doesn't help with that
---
Write a book &amp; cry more about it, sounds like you tried to profit off of your former guild after the fact, and cheese a free lion heart helm out of it. If it was a full guild run then gg your guild got the pattern and one of your raid/party members did the right thing and needed on it then donated to ensure it would not be sold off (like I feel your salt is coming from). Get your mats and get it crafted what's the big fkin deal? Ohh yea cause you wanted a handout. Lol good luck with that, ride them coat tails though you do you princess.
---
You're hired! Go be my meat shield
---
I would say warlocks are lawful evil, rogues are chaotic and shadow priests are neutral. warlocks make pacts and treatises with evil entities that they must follow. following the evil laws
---
Did you modify the .lua file according to the thing in the comments section?
---
same feeling I had reading your comment
---
I missed being a literal nobody. 
---
Logging onto retail and an NPC i'd never seen before knows who i am and my whole fucking backstory.
---
There are certain individual items that are BiS over certain other BiS pre Dire Maul release. That's it.
---
I litrally convinced almost all my friends and family to join
---
Yeah people are trying to start witch hunts over really petty things. 
---
  Ninjaing something in ulda and posting it on reddit is like telling on your lil brother to mom about not sharing something. Who cares at all?
---
No, you're just lazy to not farm it yourself.. you lift on the back of others to earn gold where the other person actually needs the item as an upgrade.
---
Stop being a .... and farm gold like the rest of us
---
wtf
---
Nah you can do UBRS as a 10 man.
---
Its ulda too like I hate to burst his bubble but its not important for 2 greens max lmao.
---
It just dropped to 45%.
---
For hunters: If I want my pet to learn bite/claw/etc. I know I have to go out and tame a pet that knows that skill, have the pet use it a couple times, then I'll be able to teach it to my pet.
---
If I have a pet that's lvl 19, and I want to teach it bite or claw rank 3, do I have to learn ranks 1 and 2 and teach those to my pet before I can teach it 3, or can I skip them and go straight for rank 3?
---
I use that feature during the first few zones to get back to the hubs faster. No rez sickness for a few levels, then a few minutes of rez sickness, easily falls off before you go back out.
---
Then when it hits the 10 minute rez sickness, I do it but not for time saving reasons, instead for not having to baby sit auto run reasons. I use 5-8 minutes to take a break, come back and get to runnin to my next destination.
---
I haven't seen any of the speed leveling techs, but it wouldn't surprise me if they used this in strategic areas (before traveling to new zones, before training, etc. any point in time where a 10-minute break from mobs occurs)
---
There is loot better than raid loot. Of course you wont get a better piece on every slot compsred to raiding but there are individual pieces that are better than any MC/Ony piece for that slot
---
From a tanks perspective: if the fucking DPS would let me gain aggro I’d be happy to put on a shield
---
I think you can wave at them as well and they'll wave back.
---
Daggers are better anyway...
---
When you get Core Hound tooth...

If you re gonna gild posts, this is the kind of post to gild not the manufactured karma whoring.

I do, and if you don't, no need to reply. If you do this type of thing, you should be called out for it. Others should know you are doing this type of thing.

Because it's rare that what DPS call a bad tank is actually a bad tank. Bad tanks absolutely exist, but if you dig deeper 9/10 times the things people complain about are not the tank's fault. A good tank requires good DPS, and a degree of luck. On one pull you might be able to open up instantly because the tank got a nice crit and had the rage to really dump into the main target. On the next pull you might get 4 dodge/parry/misses in a row and have no rage or threat on anything. A good tank can hold excellent single target threat on a main target and good aoe threat on the rest as long as nobody is attacking them. If the dps is good, they will notice a good tank. If the dps is bad, they're not going to follow target orders or will aoe those groups and pull aggro. That is not the tank's fault. You cannot out-threat an AoE'ing mage. You cannot out-threat multiple dps focusing different targets. I had a mage earlier here on reddit say that most tanks just suck because they can't maintain threat over a mage opening with a CoC into blizzard. These things are not because of a bad tank, they're because of bad DPS. It doesn't matter how good you are, you're not holding aoe threat over a mage. You're not holding aggro over 3 fury warriors attacking different targets. That's not on the tank.
---
Here are a few that I really liked so far:
---
Deepmoss Venomspitter 17-18 (Stonetalon Mountains)
---
Bristleback Geomancer 19-20 (The Barrens)
---
Dustwind Storm Witch + Elementals  (Stonetalon Mountains)
---
Burning Blade Adept, Burning Blade Augor, and Burning Blade Felsworn 30-32 (Desolace)
---
Adolescent Whelp, Dreaming Whelp 34-36 (SoS)
---
Venture Co. Geologist + Venture Co. Shredder 34-37 (STV)
---
Swampwalker, Swampwalker Elder, Tangled Horror 38-41 (Swamp of Sorrows)
---
Scalding Whelp 42-43 (Badlands)
---
You can do pretty much any non-58 dungeon in full dps gear.
---
Mainly cause there's not enough "tank" gear prior to it
---
The warlock struggle
---
Add their character to your friendslist.
---
Hey! A fellow Bigglesworth unfortunate soul. See, the key is, you have to get good enough to take them when 3 Horde that are &gt;=3 levels higher than you jump you immediately after or on the tail end of killing a mob. After all, they won't attack you unless all of those criteria are met.
---
Yours is just as bad hahaha
---
Did your mate have to call his friends to defend his wrong math?
---
Oh no he opened a box in ulda, the horror. Get over it mate lmao.
---
add him to your friends list, and you can see him in game. add his battletag and you can show as offline while you stalk your friends return?
---
Personally, I have a 12 button mouse (Naga). My main ability bar is 1-12 (these numbers directly correspond to my 12 mouse buttons). The rest of my bars are modifiers + 1-12. So shift + 1-12, alt + 1-12, etc. Then I have my pet abilities bound to control + 1-12 if I’m playing a pet class. And lastly I have one hot bar that has no key binds, which just has things I click that don’t need to be key bound (First Aid interface, cooking interface, pets, etc).
---
From there, all abilities that are similar between characters share a key bind. Bandage is always “F” for all my characters. Health potions are always “E” while mana potions/thistle tea/rage pots are always shift + E. This helps to develop muscle memory no matter which class I’m playing.
---
You're childish. Get over yourself buddy.
---
But what's behind the doors? Where's the exit?
---
Thank you, will try now, sir!
---
He’s half ogre, making him larger than orcs but smaller than ogres, according to lore.
---
He says you don’t have the gear until you have around 15 percent crit. The biggest difference is that Skarm is tanking with all the consumables possible, which makes the shield way less relevant than Joe Blow with none.
---
That being said; I think the fury Prot build is still great for off tanking even with no consumables, just throw the shield on when you need to tank the hard hitters and take it off when you don’t.
---
I wish they kept wall climbing in. What's the harm in exploring these areas?
---
I think the overlap between fortnite players and wow classic players is incredibly small but i might be wrong
---
Warlock is lawful evil, all about contracts.
---
Rogue is chaotic something
---
Again, get over yourself.
---
Well yeah but there is no honor gain, you're mostly wasting time and the fun is over after time (no fight, just a one shot, wait, one shot again, wait longer, and so on)
---
Reading comprehension isn’t your strong suit, eh?  
---
They were also doing a quest in the area. So they were clearly a similar level.
---
I dont agree with this at all. Anyone can tell themselves "well, they couldn't have 4 manned it, meaning they couldn't have done it without me, so I'm entitled to more loot"
---
The mental gymnastics people do to justify taking more than their fair share is astounding. Even if he was lvl 60, you'd still need to tell the group at the start if you plan on taking loot out of turn.
---
&gt;Is that really worth putting someones name out there for a witch hunt?
---
Better question: is it worth getting your rep smeared for ninjaing garbage? Nobody is to blame here but the guy who stole loot and peaced.
---

3 points in spirit tap should be enough with 60% chance to proc. I don't have Mana issues while soloing.

Most DPS in a nut shell
---
At first I was like, come on call cam.
---
Then I was like, "nice."
---
And? Wow is the only MMO i ever played, that doesnt make me interested in battle royals
---
Not having to deal with this is why I tank instead of heal this go around :D
---
Yikes
---
You can skip.
---
You know that shields only prevent crushing and critical blows when you have shield block up right? No tank is getting defense capped and holding aggro, regardless of how many sunsets you let him grab.
---
...or do!
---
Nah I think this post is childish brother.
---
I don't think you get how that works, ... don't sell that items ... learn enchanter and disenchant them.
---
You get SS at level 1 though
---
Wayyyyyy to witch hunty and upset over a chest in ulda lmao
---
That's not what classic is about, homie.
---
is 5-7% mitigation from 2k armor?, cause there is also block factors.
---
This is what guilds are for
---
Oh god, thank you for posting this! I've been trying to figure out which addon it is that's doing it. I've been using shadowedunitframes because I can't stand having my frames at the top left, particularly on ultrawide.
---
yeah, thats the site i am using too, but getting so many different opinions ingame. just wanted to double check.
---
See you say that, but then you run stratholme living side and realise no one brought the scarlet key. Happened yesterday for my guild run lol.
---
Just grab elvui, it puts most of the important info in easier to see spots. Unfortunately, the default UI was built for 4:3 screens so when putting that ui on a modern widescreen things like hp and mana get shoved way up in the corner out of view.
---
I wouldn't say it to the same extent that the above poster put it, but this has been a tendency in every expansion through the game's history. Horde players *always* seem to go harder on the ganking thing. Be it here in Classic where several servers are being vacated by Alliance, or in BfA's war mode where they had to take drastic steps to get Alliance to try world PvPing again.
---
I will have dream of this tonight......the big ball of gryphons
---
Slam suffers spell pushback.
---
Thats good.
---
I forgot to say, f** questing
---
That is a build that cn do all those things at 60. At leveling which is what you are asking for every build can do all those things
---
My response to everyone who says Warlocks aren't chaotic evil is the Succubus quest
---
I actually ran out of powder without realizing and went to vanish and...nothing happened. Died a horrible few death to those Ogre Warlords in Feralas :(
---
Worth it to be out of the blasted lands quicker
---
Yeah, but i mean the gadetzan transporter, that requires gnomish - right?
---
Yes and I will have such a hard time finding any healer class guy to ever want a dps set of gear. Such a hard time. Not everything has to be pre raid bis for anyone to bother xd
---
Please make a new post when the mage in your group rolls need on Hand of Justice in BRD on your 30th run, a couple of greens in Ulda is not post worthy imo
---
I hope you don't mind either being harassed or dealing with guildies who are being harassed all day every day. And yes, 100% you will have guys constantly trying to get in and be creeps.
---
r8 ur b8 8/8
---
You my man, made my day. This happens all the time to me in retail. (The reason why I went to this discussion, and found this gem).
---
I am not sure about the math behind the dps of it, but I used it from 52-60 until I went DW. I enchanted it with cheap +5 weapon dmg. Like someone said, demonslaying is an option too. Or crusader if you want to spend gold on an item you replace fairly quickly. If horde, the slow 2h weapons from emp and balnazzar are great for windfury, for alliance Idk if it matters as much
---
I live for those
---
I have a Thannos too, pretty common name it seems
---
Point 2 is legit why when I was leveling my warrior alt i was happy to bring hunters even if they are 'off meta' because they can just FD and i don't have to struggle to fight them for threat
---
Thank you!

War is hell then? Resurrecting and dying again repeatidly? ;)
---
Considering how fresh the game is even in a group that has been doing MC every week not everyone will be decked out in full raid gear. 
---
More realistically raiding groups will have a mix of people that have lots of raid gear, just a couple pieces, all their pre-bis gear and some that are still missing some pre-bis. 
---
Dire Maul helps that last group. Because there are some items that can drop in diremaul that are great alternatives for some pre-bis items people may be struggling to get.
---
In addition, Diremaul introduces some neat enchantments for head and leg slot. As well as some amazing gold farming routes for those that need to farm up gold for an epic mount or something.

hey feechi, i am sorry this happend to you, first of all thanks for being in the raid with me. thanks for helping win the pattern for the guild. sorry you feel slighted out of the pattern.  I didnt mean to slight anyone, i felt as an amorsmith raiding guild member i had a right to need the pattern.  You say last second, i disagree.. I linked in guild chat. told people i hadnt won it yet and had to still go win it... and then still told the raid i was an armorsmith (post roll).  I can understand the edgy nature of greeding as an amorsmith and watching a fellow guildy need it....   
---
i can understand being upset... i can understand feeling jipped out of loot you think you should roll on... I also felt it wasnt my place to learn the recipe and dontated to guild leadership to their choosing with fondly advising it be giving freely to those in most need without regard for greed or myself.. I at no point wanted money or a helm... you clearly asked multiple times for one... i asked for one never... i didnt want one... i donated my mats to the guild for others to get one.... i still feel you are as much a part of bringing that recipe to the guild as i am and the whole group....  
---
Personally i felt attacked from my Ubrs group (that you were in).  I recieved no grtz from anyone but called a ninja for needed a war BIS as an active raider in the guild? and a warrior tank??? and an armorsmith....furthermore i was the one that decided not to learn the recipe and talk it out in discord after the run such has been the Loot dispersion methods ive enjoyed about invicta... lets get thru this-- worry about loot later:)) ... dont get hung up .. were smart .. we think... well make a good group choice....  
---
I didnt learn the pattern.... i didnt beg for a helm... i didnt want it....I wanted to help everyone... the loot gods came in and blessed me and this guild.. greed has no place here... teamwork ... friendship... cooperation.. patience... those things will always be held at the core of this organization of gamers.  
---
Or at least this one &lt;&lt;&lt;  
---
Sincerely dont need screenshots.  the truth   
---
i am sorry and wish you the best homie :))

Those Berylline Pads are unchangeable.

In the Araj and Scarab quest, elite can be attacked by a hunter from one of the run down buildings without pulling all the mobs around him. He will reset if he runs out of mana tho.

So much this

---
not your fault mate, i dont put any of hte blame on you. i beleive you were only trying to do the right thing.
---
The  biggest difference is the consumables Skarm uses, the gear doesn’t matter too much.
---
I dual wield tank in BRD/LBRS/UBRS because I have about 6k Health walking in to it with buffs, and we can Zerg everything down before it really matters regardless. When we’re fighting Rag, I’m rocking the shield when I’m tanking because it starts to matter how much health I lose because healers can actually go OOM before the big guy dies

You need to whisper mage as soon as you log on and buy 6stacks of water from them for like 1g instead of spending 45s for 5drinks (which is a huge money sink) win win.

You can make a bar with your keybinds and hide that bar.

Don't assign keybinds on the bar where you move your abilities around.

That is how statistics works on indepent chance occurences. It's called the [Bernoulli Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process). With a simpler example: a coin is a 50% chance for heads, so the probability of the outcome of heads is 0.5. If we were to flip coin 4 times, there is a 6.25% chance we dont get a single heads outcome (0.5^4=0.0625), alternatively a 93.75% chance we do get heads on at least one of them. Now instead of looking at coins, if we say the blade, which old mate says is a 1.5% chance, then we would do 0.985^15 (98.5% chance to not get the blade, multiplied over 15 independent occurences), which comes out to 0.797, or a 79.7% chance of not getting the blade after 15 kills. Therefore the chance of having received 1 blade after 15 kills is 20.3%. 
---
The odds of receiving two blades in a row is just the chance of the drop\*the chance of the drop (1.5/100*1.5/100=0.000225, or 0.0225% chance, or about 1 in 4000ish). 
---
Old mate here just isn't very good at math so he fucked it up a bit along the way lmao
---
I see what you did there.
---
Don't know why this made me laugh so hard, but true.
---
I'm not defending him, he fucked his math up, but he was on the right track. I just think looking at someone's fucking "kindness meter" is stupid
---
Classic is about whatever I find fun in classic, the fuck are you trying to tell people how to play.
---
Actually fuck off with that nonsense.
---
brd is long, you can clear "lower" brd at 52, but you cant even land 1 sunder on emp at 52, he is red until 54.
---
When I was 41, a 36 warlock attacked me and I barely killed him with enough time to take off curses and heal. After that, I just try to avoid warlocks. Only class that I really struggle fighting, even if I get the jump on them.
---
For BRD it depends on the run. 52 is plenty fine for the lower portion, but once you get past Angerforge I’d say you want to be around 54/55 just to you can aggro the boss reliably
---
I just lost it right there :D
---
Sounds like you don’t have what it takes then. Enjoy your “sex”. More boars for me.
---
Lmao
---
the tooga was one was long but not annoying, no stupid scripted rp walk where he runs back 100 feet and slowly walks up, and if you did the quest last you basically get to turn in all of tanaris
---
comparing players in a guild run to players in a pug is stupid and has no merit.
---
From one altoholic to another, I recommend rogue. It’s just SO much more flexible than Mage. My mage is only lvl 32 and my rogue is only 47, but I love my Rogue so much more. I have a ton of CC, so I can often easily handle multiple mobs at once. Blade flurry is awesome and let’s you pump out some insane DPS with Rank 2 slice and dice and Fiery Weapon enchanted Daggers. You absolutely melt mobs your level or slightly below. When things get too sticky, you can vanish or use evasion. 
---
Speaking of sticky situations, you can very easily 2v1 in PvP with a good use of mouse over macros and Blind + Gouge. You have a ton of control over fights and can do something like Cheap shot, auto attacks, Kidney shot, auto attacks, gouge, stealth, cheap shot (slight DR), Auto attacks, Eviscerate, and most classes bar Warrior will either be dead or a sliver of health away from dead. Or VS warrior you can open with Garrote and then use your other DoT and just kite in their dead zone.
---
You’re a monster in PvP, you do great single target dps in PvE, you can choose your own fights in PvP and skip trash in stealth in PvE. It’s just great fun.
---
Mage is nice too but to me it felt too 1 dimensional. I AoE things down, or I spam frost bolt. No elusiveness, PvP isn’t as fun for me on mage since it’s just sheeping until I have the mana advantage and then frost spell spam, it just wasn’t as fun for me personally. I def recommend Rogue.
---
&gt;Until BC comes out, of course
---
Well you would still have to level from 50-58.
---
What good areas/dungeons are there that a 60 prot pally can solo AoE grind for a good amount of gold/hour?
---
Oh ok if sodapoppin who plays a druid for years says that it must be true. Dude... Playing a rogue good and mastering a rogue is a difference and the second one is extremely hard.
---
This video was specifically crafted for maximum cancer.

give him some credit, he read the title...
---
Im new, Trying to level a rogue, I see on icy veins that its recommended that I use two swords, but i cant even equip wrods, is theres something im missing?
---

thanks
---
the fun they derive is from knowing the annoyance/anguish/anger it causes, that guy getting a post about him on the forums was probably such a fucking hype for him, bet hes out there right now in the same spot having a blast
---
I mostly solo levelling but if I'm invited to a group and I know it makes sense of course I will accept an invite and on the mob's death or quest completion I will drop group. Its astounding to me that someone will play an MMO and refuse to engage at all. Play a solo game if that's what you want.
---
If you're worried about that, try finding out your personal stat weights and/or use Shadowpanther. Alternatively, sim it yourself using ClassicSim.
---
Here are some general weights for combat as far as I recall.
---
- 1 AP = 1 point
---
- 1 STR = 1 point
---
- 1 AGI = 1.8 points
---
- 1 Hit = 20 points
---
- 1 Crit = 24 points
---
Lol 😚
---
Already splitting the costs, between 10+ locks... here we go!
---
&gt;raid group 3 
---
Xd
---
i could've sworn that Spirit Tap didn't work at 60 because mobs didn't give you experience, but, maybe i'm misremembering it, or they "fixed" it at some point and i'm thinking of a different version of the talent.
---
Sounds fun but it might be tough raiding with all resto druids.
---
This phase, there's not enough hit gear to justify DW tanking, that's just reality. As well, there's not enough plate gear with crit or agility this phase to justify DW tanking.
---
Yes having a shield block up prevents crushing blows, as well as crits which is true, not hard to hold aggro with a shield between shield slam and heroic strike if you are playing correctly.
---
Invicta is full of stuck up brats who are inclusive to a few select memebers, its why a guild was formed from people who split from them lol.
---
Thanks for the advice. I just got a shadow priest to run me princess for 20 gold, super worth it. I got it on my second try! I look into the quest for those shoulders you mentioned, definetly doable soon. 
---
The mask from scholo could be tough, I'll have to work on that.
---
Just the ring alone is feeling better, though :)
---
Why put FD + trap on a macro thou? 
---
Back during vanilla I just FD, set pet to passive and then wait till the icon for my trap shows that it was available to be deployed.
---
That is so sexist. Imagine I make a guild and I say "sorry you are a female, we dont want you". There would be a feminist outbreak.
---
mine shows the total and then in brackets where it's at i.e. bags and mail and maybe bank.
---
i have bagnon so it might be that but there is also an addon that lets you see the bag and bank of all your alts as well, so it might be that one.
---
Legend thanks for that What about post 45?
---
Numbers in wowhead Classic are not correct.
---
&gt; I have friends that have higher leveled characters but they say running me through Deadmines isn't worth it because I won't get XP. 
---
It's not really worth for a lvl 60 to run you through just for XP. You'll still get some though. However it is worth it to get the quests done and get the rewards. So if they don't want to do it it's because they don't want to help you, not because it's not worth it for you to do it.
---
The other side is in STV, north of Yojamba Island
---
Yeah what
---
My mage is named Nah, I feel you
---
Forget the name. Lets talk about these keybindings.
---
There are so many NPC factions that have horde and alliance races in them (and goblins which are neither at this point). Even the group in ZF is an elite fighting group with orcs and humans.
---
I always wished we could kind of stray away from your faction and work with other races, especially being a druid. I was hoping in Legion we could work with other player characters of the same class, but unfortunately we could only work with NPCs, which was still cool.
---
The quest either didn't award an item or it consumed an item whilst it did so and the item is in your bags.
---
Am a bear tank and ended up losing a DPS in an RFD run the other day.  We were still cruising as a 4 man and I suggested I could almost go kitty and make it a bit faster.  The Shaman healer declined with "no thanks, I'm enjoying doing nothing".
---
I know the post didn't directly say it, but the first line sums it up, everyone should be able to play in a manner they deem fun, naturally it's different for everyone
---
No it isn’t lol
---
I'm gonna see if I can figure that out. For normal Mara, it's not a huge deal to just spawn into purple entrance and leave to re-portal, but for a hunter farming, entering in through the purple instance actually counts as separate, so you could go over your 5/hour limit.

Forgot to switch accounts.
---
Yep, I don't need much excuse to indulge in wpvp. People fighting nearby is more than enough. Two friends and I took down someone who was at least 10 levels above the other day. It was heaps of fun.
---
you forgot to log on to your alt
---
stupid mistake. lesson learned. too much faith in humanity.
---
I'm leveling as fire until I get high enough to respec and take improved blizzard. Slowing enemies has nothing on stunning them at ridiculous range and Fire crits until the.
---
Thanks!!!
---
I. Each major city, there is a weapon master (talk to any guard to find him). Diff masters teach you how to use weapons. (Costs some silver)
---
It might be "exists"
---
it either will drop or it won't, so any drop that you are looking for is 50/50
---
haters gonna hate
---
People forget you can stack flamestrikes
---
Paladins can't even bubble out of it.
---
For sure, dungeons don't equal raid, but even with that why make your dungeons 5x harder because you can't walk into the AH and pick up a shield. 
---
Just because you have a shield, doesn't mean you have to go respec 31 pt prot, you can be fury and tank just fine. A shield allows you to use most importantly, shield block. (Or even just block in general) That's massive in big pulls it helps mitigate a ton of damage. As well it allows you to use another important ability shield wall.
---
I don't expect every warrior to be 31+ points prot, but at least carry a shield and mitigate some of the damage.
---
r/classicwow: Classic is not about endgame- the leveling and social aspect is the majority and the best part of the game.
---
Also r/classicwow: how can't you level to 60 if you leveled to 50? You haven't even started the game.
---
The problem with any class AoE grinding is that when you have 5+ mobs hitting you, you die 5x as fast, and your casting time is basically infinite if you're being spam hit by melee / damage.
---
Mages are able to avoid this by freezing and slowing groups of enemies, in addition to dealing AoE damage.
---
So you'll probably want blizzard and/or frost nova and a decent amount of AoE slow before you do this effectively.
---
for EU yes, as allways
---
US has patch day on thuseday and EU on wednesday
---
you do you
---
if it makes it easier/enjoyable re-spec when u see fit :-)
---
Plus he did other strange thing like death skips
---
While only having grey/white armor...
---
Wtf is retri?is that only for vanilla ret paladin?
---
leveled to 60 in sm graveyard?
---
I see you don’t read the quest text
---
It's worth noting that the 3 levels lower requirement applies to DPS in this case, the requirement would also be higher for a tank, and lower for a healer.
---
Yup. I am a fire mage and poeple are asking me this question almost every day. I am doing a LOT of damage. I am leveling fire because I love it, I am playing the game because I love it and I will not change anything just because it is "more efficient"... Maybe I will respec when it comes to the fire-immun bosses, but until then, let me enjoy my game.
---
I thought the shamans from Nagrand believed that the elements where the true balance of nature.
---
Azerothian shamans also believed the elements where the natural balance. Which is why the elemental Lord's battled each other over each other's  plane to gain supremacy but leading to natural balance.
---
Rags is deliberty trying to break that balance by shifting the fire plane into the world of azeroth which is why he is stopped. The black orcs where just evil and harnessing the destructive power of fire because it's linked to violence and destruction which in itself is not evil but the way it's harnessed and used is.
---
Shamans to me are more neutral than druid's because they have no agenda other than the elemental balance of the world.
---
But druid's worship actual God Elune and the other dude.
---
Granted I could be completely wrong
---
So was the mom or dad an ogre

You can reliably quest from 1-60 if you stick to green quests, I do recommend doing each dungeon a few times to clear our the dungeon quests though.
---
Outside of "cleave" and "farm" groups, the xp/hr is better for quests than from dungeons.

Large raw mightfish and winter squid.

Good effort for salt! Alas, I got this in my first run at 60 tonight  *laughs in orc*
---
I prefer to heal.
---
It's definitely more difficult! The questing experience is not as "smoothed" out as retail, I personally like this because it leads to natural variation and makes it more RPGish, but I can't deny that it still isn't polished enough in many ways. Hopefully questie can point you to some good leveled quests for you.

Mana issues as a Priest?? I mean mages can make their own drinks and all but man priests never even need to drink while leveling..
---
Both Shadow Priests and a Mages are **very** strong in PvP, so you can't really go wrong with either one when in comes to that, Shadow Priests suck at PvE though and  people usually just bring one for their shadoweaving. 
---
As bonuses mages can make portals and consumables, priest have the ability to heal which makes is easier to find groups and finish dungeons quests while leveling, can easily solo elites and have mind control so you can fuck with the opposite faction.
---
So does anyone know if Hand of Justice will be moving to emperor with this patch or not I haven't found any info pointing either way.
---
Entering Maraudon through Orange/Purple vs using the Inner portal takes you to identical but technically separate instances. If you were to start a party of 2 and both tried to meet at princess, one entering via inner portal and one via purple entrance, you'd be unable to find one another. For this reason, a hunter/lock/etc that dies during Mara farming and needs to enter through purple or orange to spawn and reportal will need to count it as one of their 5/hour.
---
&gt;Women often do prefer playing with women and that is okay.
---
Sounds like I want into that guild, too
---
That's the kind of comment that brings absolutely nothing to the discussion. 
---
A mage could know a lot about tanking and a tank could know nothing about the mage class.
---
But you remember it right? It was a hidden portal that tossed on you back into inner Maraudon
---
Agreed, never found AOE to be a particularly good method unless the mage is very good, which the majority aren't. The once or twice the mage was actually good it was in fact very fast.
---
I recommend switching early as you have a chance of being invited to raids and such, and it's much easier to get your healer gear if you're healing dungeons since there's no competition mostly.
---
Problem with daggers is you will go through gaps of like.. 10-15 levels without a good upgrade...there are very nice swords or 1handed non dagger weps from quests, dungeons, etc.. not so much for daggers. I do well with daggers (currently have shadowfoot stabber and scarlet kris) but It honestly is hindering some possible dps output since I could easily throw dal rends on which is bis for swords and spam SS... Compared to a 600g heart seeker and felstriker
---
Ironman... btw
---
sadly the dungeon experience is classic will never hold a candle to the pre nerfed dungeons.  Over itemized gear and whole pulls with only 1 elite are too easy for modern gamers.  Gimmi dat throne room where every mob in there was elite and lets see the mages aoe those and live.
---
The Details! add-on helps a lot, you can have your DPS *and* a threat meter together. I also wait until I see a couple Rends up or other dots/debuffs before I fire away. 
---
It also doesn't really hurt your DPS either, I find it's the exact opposite. When you let them get a nice Threat cushion, you can just let those Shadowbolts fly, climb the DPS chart, AND everybody loves you for it because everything is going smoothly. 
---
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast!
---
I suggest reinstalling. I have been running with ElvUI +VuhDo + HealComm and so far I haven't had any errors (or other problems)
---
Not my video, but damn I've lived thru all of this.
---
Don't forget Searing George.

Hopefully you can get in their face, hamstring, and use berserkers rage. You’ll have to eat the death coil, but that’s honestly it. They annoying, but they are also squishy so you might get lucky with crits.
---
Eh I can understand it. Until WoW came out out I literally only had one hobby. Rocket League. I didn’t play other games because I didn’t like other games. I tried them all. RDR2 lasted me about 30 minutes. Apex a few days. Other games much less. So for about a year and a half I only played Rocket League. I had no other interests until WoW cape out. Even now it’s hard to invest time in WoW because at the slightest inconvenience I kind of automatically Alt+F4 and open Rocket League. 
---
Some people just find one thing they really enjoy and for whatever reason have a hard time finding a second interest. Part of it for me was being so busy with work I could only invest in one thing, or half ass a couple things. Part of it was just genuinely not enjoying anything else. I don’t think there is anything wrong with that. 
---
Same goes for the people who’s only interest is WoW. I don’t see a problem with that and it’s totally reasonable if they don’t enjoy other games or other hobbies in general. Whatever makes you happy man.
---
Hey, just write a really nice letter with a nice ale attached.
---
It is a sad day when the wow video's i watched in 2004 are better quality then this shit that gets posted to reddit today.
---
I didn't say 80/20, someone else may have, I know before the census addon was shut down, it said 63/37, and it feels worse now.  All I can say for sure is it's really bad.
---
It's not even possible, you need 5 people to open a guild and that's more than double the amount of girls on a typical wow realm
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
The tooltips do tell you. If it says frost/fire/shadow/nature/arcane damage, then it scales with +damage of that type.
---
If it says weapon damage, then it scales with weapon damage. If it says AP, then AP.
---
Is that dominos or bartender4? And which one do you prefer and why? 
---
Thanks man!
---
His father iirc.

I knew where it started, but found a lone mage in tanaris by happenstance. It was my most satisfying PvP kill.

I'm playing dagger/dagger gutripper/shadowblade lvl 51 arm. 21 assassination and 21 combat.

I feel the DMG is very good, but most importantly the gameplay is not just sinister strike and eviscarate which is plain boring.

If it doesn't backstab, it ain't rogue.

Okay, I use the ultimate methods, but I conjure health stone to aid my teammates, I bound soul stone to save our healer. Help to summon people if they are afraid of long-distanced traveling through hostile territories.

hm...havent even thought of that :D only ever saw that as scholo, never as SM
---
Cant do fuck all in bear form.
---
I got mine right at 30 with the few gold I had and having some local high levels help and it did significantly help me get through to 40. I totally avoided STV though and did some SM runs instead. Now I did RFD for 2 levels which burnt me out a bit so I'm taking a little break
---
Rolled a hunter alt today, having this issue.  has anyone resolved it?
---
I don't understand this comment. All the mobs in UBRS are elite.
---
Unlike a healer a mage needs to always be casting (except when wanding) to maximise their output, which means no pause for mana regeneration. This makes spirit a fairly bad stat overall for them.
---
It is however more useful than Strength and Agility, and the Civinad Robes has more overall stats than the Death Speaker Robes.
---
I doubt you'd notice a large difference, but it would significantly improve your passive mp and hp regen outside of casting. (Just try it!)
---
/slap
---
To be good enough for spellcleave, put 3 points into improved blizzard, and the other talent that increases the effect of you slows. It’s not a huge investment so it won’t really hinder you single target damage.
---
Skinning is such an incredibly great profession. I’m furious I didn’t pick it first time round back in the day. Places like that yeti cave or that Blasted Lands quest or Ungoro are just strewn with free cash lying everywhere

Tf? He wanted to ***/roll*** for it not give it to him for free.

They are all good in their own way I bet. In my experience, Bigglesworth has been a pretty solid experience. Decent faction balance though horse outnumber alliance. Still two layers, so good pop. Cool people for the most part.
---
His father was half orc half ogre and his mother was an orc so he's technically a quarter ogre rom memory.
---
Just wait for me to get aggro! 
---
15 seconds later you 'have' aggro, and your healers have half mana and the mobs are full health. DPS engages and mobs run all over the place. Pally throws out a stun and heal. A mage died. Time to Rez and mana up. Oops, pally buff fell off. Time to rebuff. Can I get some water? Ok next pull. 
---
Time elapsed: 4 minutes.
---
Mobs killed: 2
---
I don't group with paladin tanks.
---
You think that - and everyone in the group is /telling each other “fuck this guy”.
---
Either pass out argent dawn water to the healer or deal with it.
---
I saw a guy who managed to fill his Onyxia raid despite reserving the head for himself.
---
I would not be surprised this worked as well
---
If you’re on a PvE server , then transfer to a PvP server. And then suck it up.
---
Thank you.
---
Thing is if you are recruiting for a strat live youd think you had the key yourself...
---
I had this happen and the group got super angry that I was all the way in UC (even though they grabbed me from world chat)
---
If they said anything I would hage grabbed mine out of the bank... LOL. 
---
we did an undead run instead but it was meh
---
Depends on who you'd ask but currently there's not really any extended fights where crit can shine. Paladin healing is mostly about finding the right balance of your gear that fits your playing style.
---
Generally I prefer healing over crit for progression or when shit hits the fan so you're pulling the biggest hps possible instead of praying for rng. 
---
If you're worried about mana on a paladin you're imho doing it wrong and you need to start using SoW/JoW more and coordinating with your other healers.
---
Isn't there the Ravasaur trainer in Un'Goro for Horde?
---
You will NEED a new group if you pull that crap in my group.
---
Imagine leveling with frost
---
Chad Fire Mage is the way to go
---
I 2v1'd a priest and shaman around my level as a cat druid in thousand needles today. Hunters fuck me up though
---
I’m using a software called ISboxer, you should check it out if you haven’t already. This is imo like the ultimate multiboxing software and makes it easy af to control anything you want
---
I'd say you should let them die peacefully their way. I'm sure you would like to not be one shotted in your last days either.
---
Well I come from a background of heroic(then later renamed to mythic) raiding so I’m used to raid nights and farming and stuff it’s no big deal when I can find the time to adapt a schedule to it again lol
---
Yeah but you cant do it on your own as well or as easy as with frost.
---
The point of frost aoe mage is aoe damage and control.
---
Fire has much better burst but you gotta kite like a god to farm as efficiently as frost on your own.
---
If I'm playing on multiple computers, and assuming that my addons do not need to be updated, can I simply move over only my WTF folder? Does that folder contain all my changes and stats (kill count/auction stats/changes to UI/...)? or are some things also stored in the Interface/Addons folder as well?
---
Even destro spec pretty much just means ruin shadowbolt.  They are just doing something fun together.
---
Nope, you'll eventually end up doing more quests for them.
---
Make sure you head back for Hillsbrad + Arathi when you're level appropriate.
---
Chars/players and guilds evolue, make progression. Sometimes at the same pase, sometimes one goes faster. Their is a guild for everyone's progression.
---
Another side of guild to take into consideration is the social side and if you are committed to your actual guild?
---
You should try healing in leveling dungeons then. I am lvl 39 resto druid and usually make 2-3 dungeon runs per 4-5 hours. It takes me about 60-75 conjured mineral water per SM A+C or Uldaman. 
---
I usually clear my inventory by selling greens on AH, sending to my disenchanter/bank alts, then ask several lvl 50+ mages for 6 stacks of water usually giving em 10s/stack (Moon Berry juice costs 72s/stack), because lvl 45+ mage mages are doing 20 pcs of lvl 35 water unlike lvl 35 mage who do only 2 pcs per cast.
---
So average mage drinks about after every big AoE pull or intensive fight. When group is fighting 3-4 mobs and one is CCed he can even go on just shooting with wand, regening 30% of his mana in process.
---
Healer is another story, especially if there are too many melee, warlocks or tank is a bit low for his dungeon. Yester day we had lvl 40 druid tank in Uldaman and boy he had a lot of HP, but at the same time mobs critted on him like mad beasts. Our dos were lvl 45 hunter, lvl 43 mage and 43 warlock. We cleared all instance but it took me about 86 bottles of mana.
---
My strategy is move to the front once last mob of pack is about to die and drop my ass on cold floor starting drinking ASAP. Every second out of combat between pulls counts when I am below 40% of mana.
---
If you don't want it, stop whispering me asking me to Tank.
---
Good on you. The amount of minmaxing I see is unreal. Like it's fucking classic, everything is already ridiculously simplified and rudimentary, yet all I see is "LFM Ragefire Chasm, Spellcleave only"
---
It feels like a lot of elitism is pouring in from retail...
---
Are you sure about that? I thought ?? mobs behaved 3 lvls higher than the higher person on the threat table. So a ?? would be lvl 60 to a group of lvl 57s but if a lvl 60 joined them everyone would be attacking a lvl 63? I'm not sure if it was this way in vanilla, but I've definitely run into this issue in an expansion where I couldn't hit bosses at all because the person I was doing it with was 10 levels higher even though the raid was on level for me.
---
Nobody cares about leveling items. He ninjad 4 gold worth of items oh no call the FBI, I bet if you spam LFG with "THIS dude is a NINJA" more people put you on ignore because you are annoying instead of putting that "ninja" on ignore.
---
It only requires 300 to make. You can wear even after you drop tailoring. The bloodvine set, however, requires you to be 300 tailoring.
---
only for tanks
---
In daoc you could return to your grave, /pray and restore some lost xp.
---
Bartender :D
---
Yeah... while you get more exp per mob and quest you also have more exp to gain to level, and it dramatically outpaces the rate at which quest/mob exp scales lol.
---
Ahahahah naked male night elf
---
That's not true. In raids where you can't perfectly coordinate your heals with other players makes over-healing inevitable. They are correct to a degree, using smaller heals reduces the amount you tend to over heal.
---
Flash heal is actually both less efficient, and less hps than greater heal. The issue with greater heal is that the heal is too big. If you actually get the heal off at 100% throughput, you're actively allowing your tanks to get lower than 50% health. In a 5 man, this is fine. In a raid, it's typically not good.
---
I was in hinterlands
---
"tip" whatever, if they say thanks you did well.
---
Some people tip 5g, some people tip 20s, most people tip nothing.
---
I dont see why they wouldnt. Even streamers would benefit from a config of their binds given to viewers if they donate or sub.
---
Levelling a druid hurts my coin purse.
---
Levelling a hunter hurts my hand. So many more keybinds needed!
---
Chaos is like the Spriest theme. I can't think of a better word for shadow priest besides insanity and chaos.
---
If you intend on raiding mage is easier to get groups for.
---
Exactly. I am sick and tired of "you go AOE" here, no sir, I want to spam them frostbolts at the raid boss making sure I don't get oom. Let me see how your imp blizzard will have any significant impact on good ol' Raggy while I clearcast my way to success. 18/0/34 is the only way to fly, like it or not.
---
I was doing something similar with the character selection screen every time I logged out but then I switched mains and I forgot about it until I was already level 16. :/. Your execution is far superior to how mine would have turned out though lol
---
Warriors as lawful neutral?  Yeah no, they are somewhere in the Neutral column or at the very least Chaotic Neutral.  Priests with their shadow spec should be occupying the Lawful Neutral slot.
---
Is guild drama magnified in such an echo chamber?
---
But is it true?
---
Same here as a gnome lock. They look so ridic on horses imo. Going to horribly ignore this one for the time being and keep chasing my Nightsaber!
---
There room in brd
---
Forget? I've probably killed Rend a houndred times and never seen it or heard about it.
---
Gonna do it every time from now on tho.
---
100-200g depending on the server.
---
to bad print screen is not a thing. that you have to take a up your phone
---
At 60 there isnt much to do except extremely dull MC and onyx raid. There isnt any difficulty in those. Looking forward to BWL to see if theres just a slight bump in difficulty.
---
I'm sure it was on accident, I mean it's not like he did it by purpose.
---
There are some good guides out there for paladin. Kargoz I think it was made a really nice one, along with guys like Esfand. 
---
It is true you don’t use a lot of buttons when just grinding, but who does?
---
Paladin grinding/leveling is about management of your mana resource, pulling the right number of mobs, and using your cooldowns/blessings/heals effectively. Always have a sword and board, as well as a set to heal with and you will be able to take on most dungeons while leveling as any role.
---
No offense but maybe learn to play mage better? There is more downtime than other classes but if you play right the difference is negligible. 
---
Use lower ranks of spells, use your mana wisely, don't CoC a single target, wand ennemies when they have little health left instead of casting an other spell, don't use mana shield and learn to kite (ise your gcd downtime to build distance with the ennemy), use mana gem and evocation, don't stop to drink to full mana all the time (unless you k ow for sure you will need all your mana, i.e. if you're AoE-ing), make loads of water when you log in and drink whenever theres downtime (i.e. youre stopping to chat, might as well be drinking)
---
Mana management is easier as you level up imho, I barely have to stop to drink while leveling now.
---
“2 or more” if it is more than 2 why would they help you? I help out people all the time, but if the result is most likely both of us dying, I would rather just you die...
---
Do you think insulting people on Reddit is gonna make them less likely to corpse camp your ass?
---
So I’m kinda thinking ahead about this. How many engineering keybinds would you say a rogue should plan for in PvP? I’m still leveling so I haven’t picked it up yet, but eventually I will.
---
I'm showing him how much of a prick he is, people need that when they can't be civil.
---
That's right there is currently no tracking. As far as I know the only verifiable way to prove your stats atm is to have the video available in its entirety.
---
Lol poor hunters, not only they are still clunky sometimes, they cant pre-trap or flare against rogue... Just give a rogue an opener like its ambush, its instantly a loss, if rogue doesnt fuck up
---
As a guy that did this for a long time....  I really don’t recommend it for PvP. 2h is the best for it. Dual wield is pretty solid for pve.
---
I use dominos, actually use bartender on retail and I couldn’t get it work on classic but now I say prefer dominos
---
Phase 3 for bg:s.
---
if i ever have the choice between classic+ or TBC, i will take classic+
---
and as far as i have seen, the mayority thinks the same way, 
---
i dont think TBC is most likly, i would give it a 40% likliness now i think
---
Em? Locks do have instant cast to tag mobs
---
Shimmering if not done, STV until 40 at which point Badlands is great. Back to STV and to that + dungeons until 42-43, when Tanaris opens up.
---
What's the addon in the top left corner?
---
I get 2v1d a lot and ally just run right by me instead of helping. Dont know why people rolled pvp if they wont even help their own faction being ganked
---
Good luck with threat
---
In heroes of the Storm alextrazsa admits that she copied sylvanas's outfit.  "Leggings, thin boots, cap, sports bra, and cloth shoulder pads" 
---
1:08-1:14 in the linked video 
---
https://youtu.be/e5xtaX6flb8
---
Yup
---
I love blowing my mana on non downranked HoTs, but I do it in a way that I spend as much time not casting, in the 5 seconds after casting regen state, as possible.
---
I've got pretty good mana efficiency, and I get a lot of compliments on my heals. The better armoured the tank, and the better the DPS is at not taking aggro, the more amazing efficiency I can get from healing this way.
---
But even in bad groups, I can still perform well.
---
crime ? Whats the prison sentence for selling wow gold ?
---
Because it promotes grouping and camaraderie, the need to find a good guild that truly backs you up, and it can be just plain fun? Sure, it can be frustrating too but it adds an ever changing element to being out in the open world and helps break the monotony of mob grinding endlessly. Not for everyone though, thats why it’s optional.
---
Yeah as was said below, just vendor. You can save one or two and try to throw them on the AH.
---
Yeah but most boss encounters are just positioning and spamming frost bolt, you have more fun doing trash than mobs :(
---
I didnt play mage in vanilla, only from wotlk, and I kinda regret doing mage now.
---
The levelling and dungeon experience is amazing though, and it's so overpowered in PvP, so Im sticking with it
---
It's really nice huh?
---
Before you ding again, type /played in chat and you can see how many hours you have spent at your current level, btw
---
can be counterspelled too right?
---
Combat swords for raids. Dagger for pvp. See a big difference in dps between dagger rogues and swords rogues in raids.
---
Firstly it depends on what class you are, but spirit is (20%) better for priest mages and warlocks than it is for paladins, druids hunters and shamans.
---
As a very rough approximate you divide spirit by 2 to convert it to MP5, but note that spirit regen only applies if you haven't cast for 5 seconds, whilst MP5 always applies.
---
Some talents / abilities allow spirit regen to continue whilst casting.
---
Talent trees. I've only gone really in depth for Priest but trying to decide non "cookie cutter" builds is so interesting.
---
Power Infusion? Spirit of Redemption? Searing Light?
---
I particularly like the idea of not maxing a tree out to get odd dual tree combinations.
---
so basically every pull from my experience :S
---
We have had only priest tiers drop.
---
Check AH, cheapest I've seen it for is 71g, goes for around that to 100g on my server.
---
stalagg
---
We have killed the 6 times and gotten 10 T2 mage heads... We have 6 mages, so naturally we are not happy about disenchanting these.
---
Not sure exactly what the crime would be but you're breaking a contract you accepted when creating your account and agreeing to the ToS, plus making money off of someone else's property.
---
Interesting - ty for the info
---
I mean phase two implies that you have access to the raid gear from phase 1. Why wouldn't they display the best in slot
---
It’s not real you muppet
---
I recall this being a pretty common occurrence. 
---
Still a better ruler than the Wrynns.
---
Honestly i was just curious, and isnt there a guy that has something with eliminating yp in retail i think its only with pvp tho right?
---
Yeah this is not right. From what I found the drop rate was 3-4% depending on mob when I was researching it
---
I saw a horde guy jump someone then lose and tell me we could of won together liek dude im 49 your 60 and the other guy was 60 im not jumping in that fight
---
Fishing buddy
---
there is no legit option.
---
It's classed as RMT and as such it could get your account banned as well as whoever you are selling to.
---
&gt; Druids also operate outside of faction and have their own neutral zone
---
kind of like a...neutral?
---
I know you have learned a lesson already, but why all agree to roll greed, instead of all agree to roll need? If all needs instead of all greeds the end result is the same. Guild gets it. However it eliminates the risk of ninja.
---
As you mentioned a druid rolled need as well, so it was a potential ninja.
---
Also did you meet all of the 10 people in face? Do you know them for long? I can’t even name 10 friends from real life who would I 100% trust to not ninja from me (if they played wow)
---
You are aware that skarm is doing it now on his fresh 60 warrior right?
---
Id reccomend 20% crit atleast and 9% hit before doing though.
---
The closer I get to 60 the more enthausiastic I become.
---
also if you do the nagmara quest (sucubus in bar) you can talk to her and she'll open the door for you without having to fight the golem
---
Is the west fall chicken quest reward shareable? If so lookup how to get a west fall chicken it involves /chicken multiple times to a chicken in westfall then to go to the vendor and feed it and bam you get a pet Chicken.
---
Was this on Incendius?
---
I farm graveyard inside zul farak. Good place to get 50g an hour. It takes time to learn but is worth it once you know the basics. There are guides on YouTube about it
---
This sounds like, "you really want to use a regular mount in PvP/BGs for these reasons."  The guy should have said something like that.  When you open your statement with "getting your class mount is extremely detrimental" it sounds idiotic.
---
There’s this nagging feeling that I’d be having a whole lot more fun running around on my shadow Priest as undead compared to dwarf. 
---
Seems a great majority of Ally on Smolderweb has the “do not PvP unless attacked first” mentality.
---
k. Have fun playing world of peacecraft. Sorry your video game upset you.
---
I have had 1 bad experience with a tank so far, and that's just because he left halfway through the dungeon. And I'll tell you why I don't have problems, it's because I know what my responsibilies are as a dps. I focus priority targets (whether they're marked or not) and weak targets for example. And I don't make it the tank's fault when I get aggro while I unload on a caster mob with all my cds!
---
As a dps I can play in such a way where as long as the tank is generating just more threat on every mob than the healer, everything will be fine. I don't mind tanking my focus target as a fury warrior, in fact it gives me more rage to dps it!
---
Like really, the only time when the tank's skill isn't enough for me, is when the healer manages to consistently out aggro them OR if he just dies too quickly
---
Does it fire a special beam cannon?
---
Will DM be released tomorrow?
---
Noggenfogger EU
---
some overlap yea, Dreamweave are blue items, and more costly to make. Shadowweave's are greens, all equippable around 40. I'm levevl 56 now and still wearing the blue/greens and keeping up on DPS in BRD and the likes! solid investment!
---
How much gold did you finish with?
---
There is a difference between participating in PvP with other people you come across in the world and sitting around camping low level players because the only way you can feel good about yourself is if you are ruining something for someone else.
---
God damn horde
---
DBM: Cat is the bomb!
---
Raid: Who the hell is Cat?
---
Hunters need to be careful in that fight, or they WILL cause a wipe.
---
That makes total sense since the experience of male gamers and female gamers are equivalent. 
---
/s
---
So many bugs in this client. Occasional blue posts but no patch notes at all. Kinda disappointing after the great communication they had at times pre launch.
---
I'm not. When I roll PvP I accept that sad little losers will kill me.. I feel bad for them and move on.
---
Nah, Warlock is much more interesting. There should be corruption slots for most if not all locks. So you are managing that. You also may have a curse assigned. Death Coil is a solid option to use if you either need the heal or need to do dps while moving. Shadowburn is kind of like a pseudo-execute to use when you can't get another bolt off. Or you can even just use it like an instant nuke that allows you to move (like DC) if you got shards to spare.
---
I would pay money to watch loot disputes.
---
Oh hello, it's you, CHAMPION OF AZEROTH, SPEAKER OF THE HORDE, TITANSLAYER,BATTLEMASTER, AND LORD OF THE REINS Ñösçôpëd, thank you for venturing into this murloc cave and freeing me!
---
There's nothing surprising about it, don't be so upset to find out what people think of you when you gank lowbies.
---
Part of the game sure, still sad.
---
I grinded felcloth for a couple weeks when I hit 60 early. Entire area to myself, only got 3 to 4 an hour. The drop rate is low. Sub 5% I'd  estimate.
---
Partly because players got spoiled and became lazy.
---
Many others don’t know how the dungeon/raid is actually supposed to go, they just know that once it got done so they assumed it’s easy so why do they need to learn it, the tank can just do it because it’s not really a thing.
---
Unfortunate...
---
honestly, it was your error for not rolling need on it. at such high tier of game, it is unfair to the other 300 blacksmith that he has to reroll for your critical mistake
---
Yea I agree. The class mounts look awesome and have an epic quest. If people want to do it more power to them. But when I see people saying that the downsides don't matter I want to say something.
---
U can click the pike, wth? 😳
---
Prot warriors only have a 50% chance to dispell it though
---
I don't usually gank lowbies, only exception is if i'm doing a low lvl quest with shitty droprates.
---
For example, my mage is 55 rn and I didn't quest in badlands.. Until I saw someone with the stopwatch trinket. 'damn i've forgot about that quest, time to fetch it'. So here I go happy hunting in bladlands, checking pre-Q and seeing I need 10 drops from elementals that never drop. And so feeeeeeeeew elementals to kill. With horde and alliance players around contesting them.. 
---
I don't care if you filthy alliance are lvl 30, 40, or 50. If you tag 'my' mobs, I instantly focus fire on you. I kill you 1, 2, 3, 10 times. I kill you, your friends, and your friends friends until I got the damn questdrops I need. Go quest somewhere else and leave me to my duties.
---
After that, I go back to civilized me, who don't gank while quest/leveling (unless attacked first).
---
Don't blame me, blame the low pop of mobs to kill and the droprates.
---
Oh hello it's you, CHAMPION OF AZEROTH, SPEAKER OF THE HORDE, TITANSLAYER,BATTLEMASTER, AND LORD OF THE REINS Ñösçôpëd, thank you for venturing into this murloc cave and freeing me!
---
Man you guys get *so upset* over this don't you?
---
It's part of the game, I do deal with it. But the circles you run around in to justify what you're doing which is going out to ruin others game time? Yeah that's pretty sad mate.
---
You do you, but don't whine when others pass judgement.
---
Couple days ago I was minding my own business as a 36 rogue running to Booty Bay. 43 Warlock runs by and decides to attack me. I fight back, no poisons, no blind powder or anything. I get him to about half hp when I notice a 44 warrior run up, stop, and watch for 2 seconds as I tick away to dots and runs off. Like... holy shit, thanks for the help bro, go play on a pve server if you can't stop for 10 seconds to help out your faction.
---
Sounds like some private server shenanigans.
---
I've legit never had a problem with Scholo, but then I always run with at least 1 mage.
---
Seems to make most things a breeze.
---
You don't travel to low level contested zones to PvP. You go for the exact opposite reason, to grief players without having to PvP. 
---
If you want to PvP go to a high level zone, organise a raid on a capital, kill players at Blackrock mountain. The sad truth is that players that go to Lakeshire or thousand needles to kill levelling players aren't looking to PvP, they're targeting players that they know don't want to participate and couldn't even if they wanted to. It's greifing plain and simple, probably because someone did it to them when they levelled. 
---
People are sometimes dicks. People in video games are often bigger dicks.
---
Hypothetically you'd want to google search WoW gold, get a nice average acroos a few websites for your server and faction and use that as a baseline price. This is all illegal and against the ToS in practice though.
---
Cheers I actually just dropped 40g leveling my tailoring up to 230 and made the couple shadoweave parts I could. Only level 38 so need to level before I can use the rest. Good news is the shadoweave stuff seems to ah well on my server, 6g or so a pop. Looks like I made my money back already.
---
love the fact that hinter is chaofic neutral, so true.
---
Haha, ill try the /dance emote, sounds awsome!
---
Thats why you need to play undead. They can drink galleons and galleons of water without ever getting not thirsty.
---
I mean, I'm sure they are sympathetic but policies are created and adhered to for the bigger picture. Maybe in 30 years if Aryan becomes more of a mainstream name, we can see change.
---
Dirty hobbits and the tricks.
---
It will hearth you if it can. 
---
It will kill you if your hearth is on CD, or if you don't have a hearthstone. Next time, delete your hearthstone and character stuck to the entrance =)
---
Only in combination with mages in SpELlcLeAvE dungeon farms. Warlocks lack the control mages have. The stun and daze talent effects are too much RNG to rely on.
---
If they would give out boost everyone would boost a mage to goldfarm with and just keep op maining there current main.
---
Plz no.
---
What would be the best two professions for making gold in Dire Maul? Mining/Herbalism? I know there are plenty nodes of both inside, but I've heard people mention enchanting as well.
---
Happens all the time when spell cleaving SM.
---
I tried to get my group to time it perfectly, letting her res him but then killing her before she heals, but my entire group refused, said letting Mograine res is a "waste of time".
---
Sure, it takes 20 seconds extra, but its nice getting an extra loot for ~3g and 600xp when you are lvl 40.
---
My sub rotation against mobs is: 1.Ambush/cheap shot - depending on dagger
---
2.Hemo
---
3.Backstab if I used cheap shot giving me 5 combo point to evis otherwise move on to gouge
---
4.Gouge - once my energy is a little higher and make sure to let the last auto attack through first
---
5.Backstab
---
6.Eviscerate
---
7.Again.
---
Definitely more fun but more difficult.
---
Can confirm Arugal alliance are pussies
---
BiS lists existed, but most players were unaware of them, and most players struggled to pull a few hundred dps.  WoW back in 2004 was VERY different than WoW now...back then you needed a full raid of 40 with moderate FR to clear MC and kill Rag, and now a 30man PuG of people in greens and blues can clear the raid in one night.  Could that be done back in vanilla?  Sure, once people were geared, but you sure as hell weren't doing it as a pug less than a month after the game launched.
---
Daily reminder that wowhead guide writers dont play Classic WoW at a top end level, find a discord server with theorycrafters in it (they actually play the game)
---
Problems are illusions in the first place. Life is a series of events, some of them you can do something about, and therefore they aren't problems. Other things you have no control over and just have to accept, so they aren't problems either.
---
You live, you die. You never encounter a problem.
---
yesterday we actually had a fire mage at onyxia pug... the guy did only wanding dmg than tried atleast couple frostbolts
---
I bet my money on: 
---
The reward you "missed" is actually the reward for the next quest you got.
---
I remember Kalil and raid 2 lol. I was one of the officers in UD, name was Inverse, rogue. I think I remember a paladin named Goose, or were you a priest?
---
Mage and warrior are the wrong way around, the mage questline makes a lot of references to the fight against fel magic (for alliance at least).
---
Need Discord help...
---
Currently trying to set up a Discord server for my guild and am trying to get roles set up and then need to basically set a trial tole up for those who are new and dont have full access to everything in game so they won't have full access to the Discord as well. I'd like to set up something where they can see the rules, announcements channels but cant reply but can react to posts.
---
Also, would like to set it up where they can read and type in general chat but that's it. 
---
Other than that, I'm trying to come up with channel names. So far I've got this:
---
Information
---
#rules
---
#announcements
---
#contests
---
General
---
#generalchat (tryna come up with a better name for WoW relation)
---
#off-topic
---
Probably gonna make class specific channels as well. Idk yet.
---
Any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated 😁
---
great now he gonna go kill the kodo ghosts too
---
That's super cute! 
---
What's the add-on to immediately target whatever hit you?
---
if you play like you write you should not give people advice for world of warcraft
---
Did one q chain there. Can't find anymore, or have I missed any?
---
The O.G. seal clubbing
---
i understand your point, but i wasnt really asking for a re-roll per say, just to add my roll to the mix. i have done this for anyone who accidentally has rolled greed on a need item in my groups
---
What makes it easier to hold aggro with 2h/dw than 1h+shield? With shield you can do shield block + revenge all day without speccing into anything. I get that more protection = less damage taken and less damage given, but if you're tanking a group it feels like it should be possible to generate enough aggro to do demo shout, tab-sunder and block+revenge. Especially if you pop bloodrage.
---
AFAIK there are no abilities exclusive for 2h, so it must be just the additional damage that's making it easier to tank then?
---
I as a Warlock farm daily using SM/DS, taking all drain talents from aff going into demo taking DS and using sacrifice voidwalker. I usually farm level 49-51 satyrs in Felwood, i can pull easily 10+ mobs  dotting em all up at the same time and using my face to tank them. I have 0 need for eating or drinking at all due to DS: VW and Life tap. Sometimes I get low on resources, thats when the drain talents come into play, i pull a mob with only siphon life and drain till dead, couple mobs like that and im all topped up and ready to pull 10+ again.
---
on private servers that gauntlet used to go like 2x faster, but he also cleaved you for 2-3k so I don't really miss it lol.
---
Only after you beat the Elite Four 123 times in a row.
---
Surely it’s still a patch though and there will be patch notes?

Have only seen the shoulders drop once, and a fucking ret pally won them.  
---
I just want those shoulders so I can finally be done with that place.
---
The Private Thorsen quests.  If you're not standing around the Rebel Camp in STV for long periods of time, you'd probably never even know there were quests you were missing.
---
yeah hit rate sounds good too and cheers
---
If this ain't some gamers rise up shit I dunno what is
---
Level up, always the best imo. Higher level quests drop bigger rewards, trash sells for more, better skins/herbs/mines...etc. You have to level anyway, so two-for-one. I got my mount at 41, saving everything, selling tailor crafted stuff, questing.
---
Wtf is that mount keybind
---
I decided mine would be shift+space and its the best thing ever. It is super comfy and even my friend binded it that way.
---
Because writing Dire Maul is so exhausting.
---
To add to this, it still does fine in dungeons when switching to DS: Succubus (highest dot damage build on the game) but absolutely not recommended in raids due to lacking ruin, all shadow bolt talents and cant use dots in raids.
---
Wat?  Strat groups are pretty common on my server.  Even Live side, which I don't remember anyone running more than two or three times back in vanilla.
---
I hope you had The Bezerker at Stamford Bridge by Amon Amarth playing in the background.
---
I salute your sacrifice.
---
Translation to MC:
---
&gt; Then you sheep a mob
---
Not valid target... Immune... Resist.
---
&gt; Freeze 4 other mobs in place
---
Raid wipes because you freeze mobs off tank and they went nuts on squishy DPS. 
---
&gt; Nuke them with cc and blizzard

Hey killing imps is important

&gt; Buff the party give out food and water

2 hours of water crafting once you get lvl 60 water.

Best ability in the game. Can't lie. 
---
&gt; Feel the flames under neath you burn!!
---
Immune
---
&gt; And then blink away in to the night. 
---
You blink so far and fast that the relative distance around the world is ~33m. This means you magically blink backwards into the mob that's really tired of your shit.
---
Bad ones do. :p
---
Can’t have a bad tank if you’re the tank right? You have complete control over that portion of the game. Unless... Well yeah, unless you suck.
---
you can't expect people to bend over for your mistakes when it is convenient for you
---

(Even tho this enchant on Hammer of Grace combined with that PreRaid Bis held in offhand is more hp)
---
Wonder why that is?. Might it be that both factions show the same behaviour? Hmm..
---
No I believe from my google search and my vanilla knowledge this trainer is placed in ungoro for vanilla but never had the quest or ability to give out a mount until wotlk or tbc. Unfinished content basically but since it wasn’t in original vanilla they won’t add it to classic for now at least
---
It may be called Mara, but the most popular run is princess.
---
What's a normal tank rotation without shield in a dungeon for you that makes it easier to hold AOE aggro? Struggling with this myself without shield block + revenge.
---
/kb should do it, if it doesn't, then I think it would be from Bartender, and yes you can bind right to the spellbook.
---
Correct!

25+ runs not seeing dal rend...or buy krol
---
There is no official statement or any post about it.
---
There is also no patchday or any maintance.
---
US got no DM atm also.
---
People back in vanilla weren't aiming for certain gear like they do now. I finished my third run earlier and it looks like i got a couple more to go. 
---
And it might be pretty common to see a group spamming for members, it's another to see multiple groups spamming for members like scholo / brd runs / l/ubrs
---
honestly in phase 1 and 2 there is not even a full set of epics for us we are limited by the drops
---
basically a mix of the dm gear , mc and the other pre bis i think is our best go
---
possibly 1 piece of of healing gear but thats about it
---
Worth it.
---
You can get a new neck from Myranda the Hag if you actually do lose it.

There was a video of a Vael kill from a rogue POV back in the day where it showed 6 rogues grouped up simutaneously spamming backstab like crazy and it was really beautiful.

Holy priest here. DM has 6 upgrades for me, most very close to raid epic equivalent. One item is BIS. ... and unlike raids you can chain run to get the loot.

It's not better it you are funny raid gears already, but for us who have seen almost no raid loot yet due to rng it has huge upgrade potential.

---
Depending on your class, 1% hit is often a direct 1% damage increase until you reach the ability hit cap (which means you hit with all your abilities).
---
After that, hit % only affects your auto-attacks - which, again, depending on your class is ~0.5-0.7% of all damage. For example, for rogues it's often 0.5-0.6% damage increase per hit % whereas for Ench Shamans it's more like 0.7%.
---
Abiilty hit cap at lvl 60 (to hit a level 63 boss) is 9%, and 6% if you have 305 weapon skill (because weapon skill also raises your hit chance).

If you have Heroic-Strike Queued up your Offhand gains the "yellow-hit" Multipliers. Therefor you're able to let your MH swing, queue HS till your OH swung, /cancelaura the Heroic strike to save rage and let your MH swing a white hit again. Making it impossible for your OH to miss = much better rage gen.

I don't usually make a habit of killing opposing players regardless of level in the same zone as me, and will even usually work with another player if we are trying to work through the same cave or building, but I swear to fucking god I don't care what level they are, if I see a single rogue anywhere they are kill on site 100% of the time.
---
TLDR.
---
BoE epic everyone rolls need. Only reason not to is if the entire group decides on another rule, and that typically only happens in a guild run.
---
Safest bet is for all to roll need. If you’re the friendly guy, then roll need and pass to the person who could use the epic.

This isn't even what I was thinking of. I'm certain the dungeons were nerfed prior to what the user is talking about. 
---
I will continue my search for details. But I know they lowered mob density made tons of mobs that were elites into non elites and lowered the number and location of patrols. 
---
I'm fairly certain it was the same patch where strat/scholo/lbrs went from 10man to 5 man, ubrs from 15 to 10.
---
I’m the appointed feral druid in my guild (for the fury warriors to get that sweet sweet leader of the pack buff), and first I was like meh, it’s gonna suck to be mediocre on the dps charts. I dinged 60 just a few days ago, and went UBRS shortly after with my guild - where I rocked the dps charts over mages and rogues with pieces of MC-gear! I was so damn happy I wasn’t just a token for the group and my guild. 
---
I lvled from 50-60 in dungeons only (as tank) and I have quite deliberately went for bis gear as I did so, and I was already in pretty good gear when I dinged. With the proper gear, high crit and some powershifting feral is very viable dps, and you will surpass players in  “meta classes” who are slacking on gear and stat priority. So I say: kitties, let me hear you roar!
---
Grats fellow Mograiners.
---
Faxxxxx
---
Well, just wait for BRD packs with 6-7 elites.
---
Is there footage of the level 42 death?
---
Mm pussy
---
Makes sense.
---
I just tune out that part of the screen lol. If I run out of space in my quest log I usually drop one of the red quests.
---
Yes you’re the asshole
---
I would go crusader. It will be mkre useful in pvp than raiding as you have more healing power from other items. The attack speed is very fast but the top end damage is still competitive with other pre raid items, this leads to a very high dps of 67. More chances to proc windfury, so it should be a solid weapon for enhance.
---
Priest is incredibly strong in melee cleave, and le’s the shaman focus on keeping WF totem up close to the warriors.
---
I will so stack up on snowballs just for that.
---
How unforgiving it is. You start shit and lose or you overestimate your abilities and you spend the next 5 minutes running back to your corpse. You mess up your spec and you either live with the handicap or spend the next lvl slogging out gold to fix it. Bis, min/max, you actually have to take an active interest in your class to get ahead, not just hit the same 4 or 5 keys and still be leet. Unless you’re a mage... lol. I kid, I’ve never played mage.
---
Em if I remember my Druid d&amp;d from the like of BAulders gate, ice wind dale and neverwinter nights Druid’s are neutral alignment, but nice idea.

Just do /who 28-32 mage for example.

Is there any addon for classic having the features of Tank Buddy, i.e. messages when you use critical cooldowns or if your taunt fails?

You need help farming for you bis items from dungeons. Let friends clear and join only for the boss to reduce exp.

You need lots of gold for the BoE items you need.

Its a combination of these 3.

No the valor set is not amazong for tanking. You should focus on plate gear with high stamina and also plus defense. For example target the rare spawn in Stratholme Skul, he has a fantastic chest piece for tanking.
---
Hahaha, great post man, it comfirms my view of the way classic just gets you hooked and retail grinds my gears after 2 hours. You need the frustration in order to enjoy the game, you need it to get you down, not so much that you won't stand up for another round, but just enough so that you jump back up and say, fuck you game, I'll get you this time.
---
I'd of needed too, some people get way over protective of boss drops and I don't get it.. Especially at low /mid level
---
It takes an absurd amount of synergy and strategy which makes it super challenging and fun. The other day we were running Cath and we couldn’t figure out whether we had enough dmg to iceblock pull Mog. Turns out, we didn’t have enough damage, since him aggroing the 2nd mage who cast nova meant my voidwalker couldn’t hold aggro and we proceeded to wipe. Next run I suggested eyeball-pulling Mog and pre-targeting Mog to have my voidwalker aggro him to the side of cath so that we were free to quickly AoE blast before my voidwalker died to Mog. Turns out, someone nova’d Mog before I could hold aggro with voidwalker. Well we wiped, so fast forward our third run (we’ve spent way too long already but we were determined to get it down). This run was the exact same, except this time I could actually hold aggro with Mog.. Until our 2nd mage nova’d too close to the crowd so he got insta-gibbed... Our fourth and final strategy was to safe-pull with eyeball, so instead of pulling Mog, and therefore, the whole cath, we pulled the mobs we could pull in Cath, and when they were killed we pulled mog and some of the ads that were left. I think the ironic part of this story is that it was all my fault at the end of the day since I hadn’t leveled Hellfire and only used Rain of Fire which has less damage overall. Oh well, now we know:)
---
So this is about the RP flavor in each class. 
---
It would be cool with one on average player personalities of people playing different classes.

Thank you, I want to test and repeat this and then show my findings. Hopefully get something changed.

I don’t remember anything like this back in the day, however I was a total derp back then so who knows.

This is the literal opposite i've had as a hunter. i've lost 4 ancient bone bows to warriors, and 4 strat undead crossbows to a mix of warriors and rogues.
---
Tip to all (I also got mine yesterday)
---
Buy the essence rather than farm using ZF to make gold (50g per hour) its insanely quicker than farming the essence your self.
---
look if you like to hit on a mob for 4 minutes until it dies, thats ok thats fine i never said that anything about it is hard or easy just painfull to watch. you are a spectating your own gameplay live for about 60% of the fight, if you dont find that to be painfull then good for you but i do.

I whispered a guy who was farming that spot if he could spare some charms so i dont need to steal his mobs, he gave me 10 :v

You need to decide whether pushing/clearing content is important to you. For me its a balance at this point. I am not at a point in my life where I want to no life this game anymore, however playing with a group of skilled players results in less time spent raiding and less stress/frustration, giving you more time to have fun and do what you want. 
---
Anyone telling you here that "all guilds will make it" are flat wrong. You will either disband on Vael or C'Thun depending on what end of the spectrum you are on. It always happens.

Unless its bis for them, any tank with a brain would sell the epic and get their bis instead.
---
It makes complete sense. You have absolutely zero way of proving that 99.9% BS stat you threw out there. Anyone with even the most BASIC understanding of statistics knows you pulled that number out of your ass and it is nothing more than an incredibly biased opinion. 
---
But hey, keep fighting that good fight I guess...
---
Something similar was in existing in real Vanilla. It was used to alert you to Rogues presence doing a similar thing (stealth in combat log). Obviously it is more advanced now but why would they ban it if the functionality was there in Vanilla?
---
Yeah when it was released för classic, where wpvp matters
---
No, you see that's where you're precisely wrong. Sitting on top of the Darkshire house is not only a dick move, it's a reportable offense. So toss a report his way.
---
Stealing someone else's Devilsaur is either a dick move or a very precise, profitable PvP play. If you steal from your own faction, yeah ok sure you're a dickbag. But grabbing the opposing faction's kill and skin, or even just killing them and then skinning, is like a tactical kick right in the digital testicles.
---
All need, unless stated otherwise at the beginning of the dungeons. That's how it should be. Unfortunately a lot of Greedy people don't like this.....
---
can I find this document that's not trashed by the owner?
---
All these guys claiming he's the asshole :/ yes it sucks to have something like this rolled away from you because somebody needs "money". But in all fairness it's just money. He could get a nice boe epic of his own with that and basically convert a boe he couldn't use into one he could use. If I read his story correctly the tanks sort of agreed to it before he actually rolled need? One tank was even about to buy it off him. 
---
But to get others to do the herassing for you? *THAT* is the real dick move here imo.
---
Tanking is love, tanking is life, that's the best part. 
---
*^(And you can really be diva if you want to because of the shortage of tank (not to much tho because of serv rep))*
---
Ignore these fools, I’ve tanked bfd —&gt; sm cath, but I do have dynamite and grenades from engineering.
---
Generally I ‘skull’ one, have RF up, charge in to group them, grenade/dynamite, swing and cast judgement at skull, then cycle swings through the rest. 
---
With retri aura you should have to trouble keeping aggro! But should you lose it, remember you can BoP the party member to regain it, or stun to stall for swings and judgement cd.
---
I use seal of command w bonebiter (went verigans-&gt;corpsemaker-&gt;bonebiter)

Of course I do that, mouse scroll up is 2H, mouse scroll down is 1H/shield. I swap when necessary (2nd pack aggroed by dps, etc).
---
My point is that today you have three types of DPS:
---
\- The casual guy not looking at DamageMeter and/or not exactly knowing how to dps rotate properly. Bottom line is, poor dps meaning you can tank very easily. However, if you have three guys like that in a group, dungeon is going to last forever and I'm often going full zerg to increase the speed of the run
---
\- The DamageMeter addict guy, will start DPSing at the second you engage or worst, pull by themselves. Impossible to tank traditionally with 1H/shield and def stance, especially after level 35+ when most class have AoE capabilities (Blade Fury, etc). If you have one of them in the group, it's manageable: you can Taunt tank the guy he is focusing because he is probably going to die fast, while building threat on others. In that case, tanking is more of a "damage to other" mitigation role: you are not going to have threat 100% on all mobs but that is okay because at least mobs die fast. If you have three players like that, that is when the nightmare begins. Even starting with fury/whirlwind, you will not keep aggro. And that is where I prefer to go full zerg because 1) I'm keeping aggro 2) mana regen time increased is mitigated by faster killing as we are basically 4 DPS.
---
\- The AoE meta streamer fan guy, does not even comprehend the tank role, as for him a groupe is made of one healer and 4 cleave DPS. I avoid those groups
---
Plus demons are chaotic evil in DnD, which is probably inspiration for this. And demons are warlock territory.
---

---
It's definitely shadow magic, but it is a standard, talent-agnostic spell. I think.
---
It shows a list of enemy players nearby and you can click the list to target them. The biggest advantage is that it plays a sound and visual clue when someone goes stealth.
---
It basically scans combat log and show it to you.
---
No, you don't *have* to fuck them over. I leave the horde alone most of the time.

When there's basically a 15g reward for killing them, I'm all over that shit.

---
Needs more upvotes. I've noticed this happening a few times while aoe'ing on my mage. I can reproduce it more often depending on the mob. Western plagueland spots it happens pretty frequently. Haven't come across it in PvP yet.
---
Man, that seems like a lot of work though.
---
I’ll check it out tonight, thank you!

It has nothing to do with the level of mobs but the difference in level.

They arent charging away from the healer, they are charging to give themselves 2 seconds before the braindead DPS start blasting without any regard for threat.

What else in that slot is a greater than 2% dps increase?
---
Wait, Toep wasnt in?
---
I distinctly remember it being in since one of our earliest MCs a Resto Shaman took it and it caused major drama.
---
Was it just because eu came out later so by that time it was in?
---
Staff from ZF ain't bad
---
Whats the difference between the 2
---
Only reason I didnt was reason there was so much pressure to give it to the Tanks, who were the only two others to need.
---
Demo threat was nerfed.  Really the way it is how - no one tanks on AoE packs.  If theres a mage, its basically his job to keep things snared and aoe them down along with the rest of the group. And the healer to keep everyone Alive. 
---
Thats the best way we do it with my group of friends.  
---
If you have an arms warrior with WF totem they do so insane amounts of damage, it worries me how different it is to Pservers.  Sweeping, Whirlwind, HoJ and Sword spec... good god. They are on par with mages in AOE 5man scenarios.
---
This wont do really! I mean you need to spend at least 17 points in assassination for the relentless strikes and ruthlessness talents. This build is suboptimal for both pve and pvp. And don’t use daggers if your going to spam hemo. You will preform better both in pvp pve, with a standard cold blood, prep and hemo build.
---
What do you mean! Mail is an excellent ability!
---
The prices on your server are pretty close to the prices on mine. I got archmage the other day for 50g. But I spent 17g on runecloth gloves and 35 on runecloth bag.
---
Unless your full protection spec you don’t. aoe is inevitably going to pull from you that’s why most comps have the tank pull then just work to keep everything in a nice ball. Assuming you have 1-2 mages and a lock other wise why are you doing aoe :P
---
You should check out Soupasoka
---
yeah you obviously didn't read. 2 people had already selected Greed, so it wasn't an All need situation, he was the only one who needed along with tanks.
---
PvP is the way to go! Yesterday I was trying to quest in Badlands- zone heavy dominated by horde on my server. I was getting constantly ganked. Yes it's true that the questing is hard...
---
However, there is nothing more rewarding in this game than to get this sweet sweet revange. To get a group together of ppl tiered of being ganked and just clean up the map from horde in a one big sweep :) 
---
It just breaks the monotony of the leveling and bring emotions to the game. And this is why I play it...
---
It will never be banned. If they break it, most in combat addons will break and so will warcraftlogs.
---
Simple as that.

---
I was under the impression that *all* extra attacks could not proc off of an extra attack.
---
If its same as private servers, it REALLY doesnt matter. If you have mana to keep your warr up, you are fine. Warrior is going to make the damage anyways. I did it as a pally and i didnt do anything but heal, the warrior will just adjust his gear from tanky to dps based on what you can heal and what not. And compared to that you have WF totem for more dps.
---
Interesting to see if you can even kite the imps at last boss.
---
Vuhdo just integrated this in the last patch. You might want to try a clean install of the addon. I also separately installed healcomm. Finally started seeing incoming heals Sunday in our Ony run.
---
I love how you're being downvoted for sharing a legit skinning strat. The absolute state of leddit.
---
While lvling to 60, not once did i neglect using a shield to tank a dungeon, and while it can be a little chaotic, it was never to the point of "This cannot be done while wearing a shield".
---
The first time i tank with a 2hander, will be with Hand of Rag if anything, because that would be stylish as fudge.
---
I wanted a shot with the statue in the background. Used levitate.
---
But Im a DPS war or rogue and I have cleave abilities, that means that I need to use them, and I dont understand why you dont hold aggro on the 4 mobs I am currently cleaving as hard as I can.
---
Thank you for understanding my side of the story. My main issue is this was a randomly put together, Pick Up Group. This was NOT a tank run. No one owed anyone anything. As I said in the story, I no longer have the item, but I wanted to see what the community thought.
---
Massively, I am the asshole, however, and my understanding of Loot rules in PUGS are wrong.

---
Yeah you are the asshole here considering 2 players had already selected Greed, so it clearly wasn't an "All Need" situation. But at least you redeemed yourself by giving it to the tanks in the end. Ninjaing is not worth it, there are many easier and less stressful ways to earn gold.

No changes?
---
So he needs to put in on the booty bay auction house.
---
You know what I love even more? When these "gankers" kill and corpse camp my alt so I jump on my main. Then I take my limited playtime just to corpse camp them. I bet they might be the ones who also cry on the forums because the fair fight in WPvP? I mean it's fun killing lowbies right but I just have to laugh when these fucks don't know what to do against the same level.
---
The staff is a world drop, DM drops the mace.
---
Mechanically broken. The damage it does to your character is fixed as 12% of your max HP every tick instead of a random value between 100-500 every tick. This means it can even tick for more than 500 damage.
---
I'm not out of reach of the guards lol, they just kill me too
---
If it does content for his stream, why not? If he does it for sake of challenge nowhere does it say he can't keep that character as an proffesion or PvP alt and must delete him.
---
Yeah its sad
---
Yah, I knew that the price of arcane crystals might go down due an easier source.
---
also the one in gnomeregan. that gobbler does the same just wo reviving!
---
Haha nice
---
Highly server dependant and there are already numerous guides out there would be point to post here
---
This addon was in vanilla you fucking nub, ypu probably wasnt even born then when I had rank14 on 5 different characters. Are you proposing changes to the game rartard? Go back to retail biach
---
Lack of sources on this one is fishy. All I know is that on the wowuidev discord they recently talked about Luna UI stealing code from shadowed and libhealcom and that originally the libhealcom code was made by shadowed author. If that's true I don't know why shadowed wouldn't support libhealcoms either if he made it to begin with. 🤔
---
That there is the horde accent I believe.
---
Not 100% sure if this is what you're asking.
---
Pvp gear for twinks and all levels from earned honor, when released, you buy whichever lvl tier of gear you want from a vendor.  So the vendor will have various pieces of gear, with resilience for various levels 19, 29, etc, all the blues you can buy for pvp.
---
Quite simple: rag is going down, but him too!
---
Im a hacker, this is photoshop, you cant fool me
---
It makes me nervous every time I see warrior swapping his shield and 1h to 2h when last 2 mobs are still alive. Especially when they are 2+ levels above him as cruising crits are about to follow. I am lvl 39 healing in Uldaman, tho my most horrible Expirience was on lvl 37 in SM A+C with 2 lvl 40 arms warriors and 2 lvl 40 warlocks. Gladly I had 40 conjured water left from my previous Library run.
---
I will kill a boar in your name next time I meet some.
---
Though I appreciate you saying i an NTA, belittling me crying over social interactions is harassing in of itself, which does not help anyone.
---
“You shouldn’t tell other people how to play” bro I love this video I wish he would do more
---
Because it's really uncomfortable after a while. The small screen, suboptimal keyboard and mouse placement... I was happy to find out that wow runs on my laptop and after a short while I lost interest in playing like that because it just isn't as good as on a desktop PC. I think the best improvement would be to get a good desk chair.
---
Boe epic and blues and patterns all need, you’re fine they fked up
---
I’ve had so many mages try to polymorph my Druid while in form... I can’t even...
---
Did the same thing. Neckbeard thing to do would be sitting infront of your screen and watching your character create 30 headbands lol
---
there was a falling out becasue of admins of r/freefolk so someone made r/oldfreefolk thats about it
---
Roll on a pve server and spam bgs if you dont like a wpvp addon.
---
it would be fine if everyone rolled need, but he was the only one who selected Need along with the tanks (who really need it). so most of the raid never had a chance at the item. it's the very definition of a ninja, even according to the "All need" camp standards.
---
It's people's inability to manage criticism and the insecurity that plagues them. Everyone fails, it's part and parcel ever getting any good at anything, you suck a lot so you can hopefully suck less until you almost don't suck at all! Hallelujah!
---
It's also has the potential to be deeply frustrating, can be humiliating and since we tell everyone in our society that they're only as worthwhile as the job they do.. well...
---
Though, on the flip side there's a chronic inability to be tactful and encouraging in text. We're so primed to expect shitty behaviour that ambiguous statements are easily misunderstood as either passive aggressive or outright hostile. This is definitely something I need to own myself as well.
---
Put those two together and you've got an ugly powder keg. Ego and misplaced belief are real. There's a reason that Thor/Frigga scene in Endgame resonated with people.
---
I've found if I remember these general ideas I relate a lot better with people online. :D
---
Exactly this, the poster below is an idiot. "2 people had already selected greed" that's their problem. The reason why everyone needs is that nobody can ninja loot it, it's fair game and may the best roll win.
---
Wich is very understandable tbf :D
---
Unfortunately he is connected via wireless as he is upstairs. I ran the cable for my computer under the house. I have 0 issues on any other game and program. It only happens with wow classic. Not wow retail or anything else.
---
I run SM dipped a little into demo, I cba to spend resp money cuz ima cheap fuck. Just wait 3-4 mississippi seconds for your tank to have ALL threat and you should be a-ok.
---
I’ve got 7 fired up and ready to go at any time. Main is a ret so when I get bored, or frustrated or just want to play for a bit, I’ll log one of the others. Only rested leveling and I try to level all professions as I go. Work when trying to feed gear and mats down the line. Lowest levels are just gathering alts.
---
Don't ever talk to me or my son again
---
I know it as Multi User Dungeon. It seems that the Domain/Dimension thing is a later variant, for whatever reason.
---
I dunno. With the derp AOE spam frost mages being the new hunters, trying to make every single dungeon a cleave without knowing what to do or being grouped for it.......  
---
They belong as Chaotic Evil. &gt;.&gt;
---
No you're not. BOE = free for all. Do not let these dumbasses tell you otherwise.
---
Why is that exactly ?
---
Haha I saw someone complain about 150 ping so I started to worry
---
It's also advantageous to kite bosses to "Vael's room".
---
Two damage meters, noice!
---
Safespotting and griefing. Get ready for ban
---
sure, ninja scum.
---
I farmed that stone guardians in un'goro yesterday, depending on the source I look, they drop guardian stones on a 16 or 26 % drop rate.
---
I killed about 30 before I looted the first stone
---
I don't think wowhead is accurate on drop rates
---
Wtf am I watching?
---
BoE's that is worth a hefty amount is always need in pugs. U dont know these ppl, u cant trust em. U go for that need, those who prematurely pressed greed is stupid and fked up. BoE's arent entitled to someone because its an upgrade.
---
mama bear.... seems right..
---
You're saying that the full list of nearby enemy players is somehow linked to the combat log? Being able to see when enemies stealth isn't as much of a problem imo.
---
The order of content in classic supports the idea of DM being Deadmines. Maybe we should call Dire Maul after its last boss.
---
It's absolutely not.
---
I have a shield and macro to switch to it if things go south. But I'm pretty much forced to tank with a 2H if I want a chance to hold aggro VS retarded DPS.
---
Yes the healer has to regen very often burning his mana down, but still less than if I kept playing with a shield not able to build threat and he had to heal the three DPS in cloth/leather sharing the aggro. Also, things die faster so it help mitigate a little the downtime of drinking.
---
I would prefer the traditional tanking if DPS allowed it, as it's very efficient, but it's almost impossible.
---
Thank you very much for understanding. I completely agree, and this is how I have played loot rules for many years.
---
This addon is rather for those that doesn't like wpvp so your shitty comment makes no sense.
---
have fun struggling as i laugh in orcish
---
Lots of people have these enchants most people can get a guildie to do it for free, that's the reality of it.
---
It's just the way BoEs are handled in groups.
---
Makes me wonder if all this behavior is closer to what a realistic Azeroth would be like.
---
how am I safespotting? the guards attack me to...
---
2x greater fire proection pots, for Ragnaros.  
---
Nothing else is needed
---
Just looked at your post history.  
---
If someone **seriously** hates the other faction of a video game that much and thinks that those people are bad people is delusional.  
---
It's a game. Horde players are regular people. It's one thing to be enemies in a game. But it's immature and stupid to take this out of the game and on the players.
---
Being Neutral in alignment is literally one of the requirements for druids within D&amp;D, too :X
---
A few days ago I was on the playground with my niece and there is this big slide that you have to climb into. And at the top there was this little girl who said “can you get my mommy?”
---
And I didn’t know her, so I said: “I don’t know who your mommy is”
---
And she said: “she’s standing next to my daddy”
---
And even that is more information than the player gave.
---
no, not everyone needs, actually I've never seen an "All need" in-game on EU server. not now, and not in vanilla. but sure, keep making excuses for your ninja behaviour.
---
Devilsaur leather got me my epic mount, but yeah its annoying if others are farming it too (so just check once in a while).
---
Tips for skinning:
---
1) Make a macro with /target ...., .... , .... (inserting the names of the devilsaurs). This way you can just run around on your mount and spam that macro. Often you find them faster this way than seeying them.
---
2) Google 'Devilsaur wow spawns' google images. Follow the paths 1 by 1 and after a while you start thinking of your own 'route' that covers all paths.
---
3) If you see someone else skin/fight a Devilsaur, try to think of where he came from and which devilsaur he proboly already killed before you (so you know which way to go to to find fresh respawned devilsaurs!
---
You put up your OP shield, dot, dot, fear.   Put up shield again.   You win.

Without mortal strike your pvp experience will be incomplete, sorry to say.

I wouldn't recommend building a hybrid pvp tank spec, just find a way to make money and respec as needed.
---
Wheres the final pic from?
---
Loved this video.
---
It makes your damage bigger.
---
In vanilla u even had an arrow pointing in the direction to thw Target, i believe u also couod see target on minimap aswell
---
For mage AoE farming, how do you deal with areas/quests that have ranged mobs?
---
Onyxia:  It's actually the fireballs from P2 that reset the agro, there isn't a total reset.  
---
But the 3 tanks usally get hit by a fireball so that's why we run like dumbasses after Ony in P3
---
Just a question and I dont tank so bear with me.  Are Pallys really viable as tanks in instances?  
---
I've had a couple groups with a pal being tanks from DM to ZF and it always seems to be an ping pong game with agro.  Or is it likely the pally tanks I've had were just bad?
---
On my server large brilliant shards are barely worth more than the vendor price.
---
Also on Bigglesworth but on Horde. Alliance 60s in raiding gear just camping Lights Chapel all day...I just settled on doing dungeons so I could reach 59 because I couldn’t turn in any of my quests lol. I even tried grinding mobs for rep, but there were Alliance camping those areas too...went to Thorium Point to turn in ore for rep, and I immediately landed to about 5 Alliance tanking everyone as they flew in. You guys are fucking brutal lmao! I’ll probably wait til early in the morning to do all my rep and quest turn ins.  
---
That being said, if you know Orsik tell him he’s the best❤️ Only Alliance I care about~
---
quick,make a post on reddit about a ninja looter !   
---
/s  
---
The Paladin is just wrong.  
---
You can both use it and you can/should both press need on it.  
---
The paladin was just a dick
---
Your last phrase is a very classical description of what projecting in a debate is. Look at what you wrote and count the mental hoops you had to jump through to decide that what he did was ok. That's desperation alright. Very good chances that you are an alt of the dude himself as well.
---
Anyway, you have not provided a single argument that stands a second long examination, while displaying Olympic levels of bad faith, so I won't feed another troll. Have fun with your Sulfuras!
---
so if everyone follows the in game rules and presses greed, and you are the only one who presses Need on an item you can't use, you aren't a ninja in your eyes?
---
Sounds like enormous aoe exploitation scheme.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? We are talking about an item that is worth hundreds of gold, not some fucking green item. Everyone needs on boe epics to AVOID ninja looters.
---
What loot rules are you talking about? There is an greed, need and pass buttons. Do you not understand? Everyone needs that x amount of gold for whatever the fuck they wan't to buy. You or anyone else is not entitled for hundreds of gold just because you can use the item.
---
Yeah yeah yeah!!!
---
It's like an addiction to a playstyle, so fun.
---
wtf, that sounds a bit buggy to me XD lvl 70 char with full sunwell gear should be able to at least normally execute the raid, at least as well as a lvl60 raid in pre-raid blues !
---
If we go by the later versions of the game shadowpriests using insanity as a resource should probobly swap place with locks :D
---
Of course you can roll on whatever you want.
---
That doesn't make you less of an asshole for doing it.
---
Yes, but you need to get exalted with the faction for the mount you want. So Ironforge for a ram, and storm wind for horse. Easiest way is donating cloth in their respective cities for rep.
---
Yes they should take their time cuz coding the keyring is just a few hour job for any CS student
---
Oh wow really? I stopped playing some time after Trammel was released. That‘s what I think ruined the game.
---
I was so happy they created a place where there were no PKs, but then the game got soooo boring
---
ah, yeah that's bad.
---
Whats the clickable raid marker addon? Been looking into it but couldnt finde one.
---
This is probably the best actual answer. It was meant as a half-way point between catch-up mechanic and fleshing out gearing needs.
---
Looks suspicious but I want to believe in it.
---
Neutral - chaotic implies they *almost always* side against it. Chaotic good is someone like Robin Hood - a literal outlaw, with altruistic intentions; or a hermit with an active hatred of establishments but a kind heart.
---
Sometimes siding with nature against society is pretty solidly true neutral.
---
Same like with any ticket me or friends sent. Not to talk of the five+ days waiting to for "uhm, yeah, we know that happens. No clue what we could currently do so accept it. I HOPE I SERVED WELL!"
---
Rag only does fire damage.
---
Getting ww axe at 30 is gonna make you forget how terrible solo questing is for like 12 lvls, its so very nice 😏
---
I think the targeting is the sore spot for dot caster. There was an addon back in WoD which let you just cast dots the way you’d use healbot. It was quite strong as you could dot everything in matter of seconds and made it easy to track timers. 
---
I haven’t seen this new addon in action. But if you can click on the list, likely click to cast will come/is already here.
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
Hey, 
---
My health and power resources are made with we WA2, the target frames are just Elvui skinned with WA2 white borders for extra flare. My party frames are Grid2
---
yeah, i was coming at it from a is it possible to do not a you're in a pug play a bit smarter XD
---
Yeah I don't see how people try to argue this point at all. If I get silenced casting my mount I'm going to be fighting either way... Might as well be dismounted and instantly start casting damage/pet spells anyways.
---
not quite how it works, (at least not until a select few bosses in later expansions).
---
For dungeons, they reset automatically when you join a new group, or when you click the reset button. You can enter 5 new dungeon IDs per hour, so nothing really prevents you from killing angerforge in BRD 100 times per week.
---
For raids though, you're limited to a once per week reset for each raid ID. If you go into Molten Core and kill a boss, you will be saved to that raid ID until the next reset (Wednesday in EU, Tuesday in US). That means, for the rest of that week, whenever you enter Molten Core you will always enter that same instance. You can only kill Ragnaros once per raid week.
---
Onyxia is a bit different, as she's on a 5 day reset timer (server-wide, not personal), so her reset days are a bit weird some times (I've spent god knows how much time explaining this to some of the raiders in my guild). In short, you can kill her every 5 days. If you want to know the reset time for her, either enter her lair or go to classic.wowhead.com and check it
---
There are a few Global chat channels you can use. Although you manually have to join them.
---
/join LookingForGroup ist the most popular one.
---
/join World is another one.
---
After Shadow Hunter Vosh'gajin, you can jump out the window on the right to land on a bar, then jump again to be 1 pack away from the Spider room. Saves a ton of time and very easy to do.
---
Wow, that's pathetic. At least in my experience they have informed me that they refused to do golem before even inviting me.
---
I don't understand their thought process though. Do golem too, and you can get a priest and a mage, for three extra minutes per run. Less competition for HoJ. 
---
Had two groups refuse to do golem, and continue to spam LFG for a healer for an insane amount of time - that could have been spent farming BRD. lol
---
there was a dos warrior in LBRS posting recount with him in first as his excuse to pull aggro off the tank literally every pull. as a healer it was so annoying, and he would even use bloodfury to reduce his incoming healing. he got pissed when he kept dying from me not heaing him 24/7 and left the group
---
What levels would I be ok to start tanking Scarlet Monastery (warrior)? And what level should i stop on each wing if i'm looking to maximize xp gains?  
---
 Wowhead and a few sites only show very broad level requirements that dont seem practical. 
---
GY: 26-36
---
Lib: 29-39
---
Armory: 32-42
---
Cath: 35-45
---
A LOT of current gear beats MC gear because it's from prenax patch (+spell damage items for example)
---
As a skinner I want to nknow your exact position.
---
and then run Strat live, kill timmy and disband xD
---
&gt; I also have had a very difficult time gaining money  
---
Doesnt matter  
---
&gt; I’m on cloud nine. 
---
doesnt matter  
---
&gt; This is legitimately my *very* first REAL random epic. 
---
&gt; During my time through wow vanilla, BC, and Wrath, I never saw an epic drop – let alone had a chance to roll of it. 
---
&gt; tanks wins the roll, and I pass it over to the player. 
---
This is very decent of you, but the damage was already done, and thats why you decided to do that... so this is damage control....  
---
when i saw your title of this post , i thought oh well, you are probably the one who's right, but after reading your post i changed my mind.  
---
I wasnt there and this is your side of the story, so i cant validate how fast people clicked need or greed... so for instance, if people already pressed greed and after that, you say "all need" its only fair to reroll the item to the whole group...  
---
Also i dont know if you (and/or other people) pressed instantly need ( which i assume, but can not validate) and then said "all need"....   
---
The best is to make agreements before the run.  
---
Always Greed , unless its an upgrade, or an valuable recipe, is how i run.  
---
Yeah im a tank, and from reading your story i would have put you on my ignore list after the run.... just my opinion, but dont care to much what others think, and continue to play the game and dont be a dick !
---
behind the tree!!
---
I think you can stand away, like very far away and she won't sleep you. It happened with me once, we had that weird hunter who just run away when we fought Mograine, when Whitemane has slept us he came back and start shooting her, and almost killed her. I dunno, what happened, and where he stood.
---
I’m with you here, my experience in game seems to show that the majority of players don’t follow this supposed rule. M
---
&lt;Seventh Watch&gt; | Kurinnaxx |Semi Hardcore | Primary raid focus with secondary PVP focus.
---
Just looking for some players to focus on raiding with PVP on the side. Plans are to raid 1-2 nights a week. Still working on raid times and details until we get enough people to raid with.
---
Onyxia guide:
---
Step 1: Tank attack
---
Step 2: DPS attack
---
Profit.
---
Looking at versatility then arms is the most,  fury second and prot last.
---
I would definitely go for tactical mastery and anger management first in arms, regardless of what you want to play. The possibility to change stance without losing all your rage is so nice to have.
---
And once you get used to sweeping strikes you will really miss it when you spec out of it.
---
But if you want to be that tanky gnome dont worry, if you look in the protection tree you will notice that all the defensive talents are in the beginning.
---
17 points lets you get most of the good stuff including extra threat (don't take the +defense talent it's a trap, 5 points for 10 def is not worth it).
---
You wait at their spawn point.
---
"Assume everyone in the pug are monkies put in front of a keyboard until they prove otherwise", has worked for me so far. Going to keep doing it!
---
I think I would swap the shaman and the druid honestly, druids are very much not chaotic
---
Ran a Mara with someone's fresh 60 warrior friend tanking in mostly late 40s gear and like two pieces from mid 50s.  Painful, no aggro, no mitigation, drink every pull.  Cry.
---
not even a flask smh
---
as a former multiglad I kinda like it without the focus frame. It raises the skill cap for pvp
---
focus frame makes the game super easy tbh
---
I can get behind that logic if everyone agrees with it and everyone presses need, no problem. But if several people follow the ingame loot rules and press greed, and then you need an item that you cant use, you are a ninja and there's no way around it no matter how hard you try to justify it by some unspoken reddit loot rule that many regular in-game players know nothing about.
---
Exactly. I mean you want to check the lvl anyway even if you knew what dungeon they're going for. Just yesterday I got invited to tank Deadmines by two different lvl 15 rogues lol. No thanks.

thats not something to rely on, but when you gather 10 mobs(assuming the strat works) you will be face tanking them all with vw shield. so any mob who is not attacking because of stun is a benefit. Other than that it is not even a good idea to use that talent for aoe groups because stunned mobs would stay behind and separate the mobs. no one would want that.
---
I hadn't even heard of this addon before, but that actually looks kinda useful.
---
That logic is straight up retarded. Here you are saying he is an asshole, but u are either lying or plain stupid if u believe that u would have greeded if a warden staff dropped with a druid tank in the grp. Yes its bis for druids, but its also 400g. If some1 wants a boe, grind the gold and buy it. No1 is entitled to any BoE.
---
This was also my experience untill i stumbled upon a cave with 7 thorium spawns and 6 mithril. I just parked my character in that cave and leveled from 49-53 in there just grinding mobs and farming mining.
---
Im going to grind 1 more level in there, then i will post about it. I've only ever encountered other players in that cave about 4 or 5 times over 3 days played.
---
You mean wyrmthalak. Draki is in ubrs
---
Also if you look into the right corner where omokk stand youll see poop
---
You also get to keep Eagan's Blaster after doing the quest. As a healer I kept it and always equip it when we go through strath live because someone WILL aoe aggro the spectral citizens and while we're beyond the point of wiping to that stuff, it still helps to just disintegrate them.
---
I'll have to look when i log in again, it's trinket menu but only a certain version works.
---
what’s your mc damage rotation ?
---
Is this really a common happenning tho?
---
this.
---
dont stand on roofs and attack people like that.  
---
That is called safe spotting !  
---
Yeah the Wyverns attack you, thats your luck, but otherwise this is called a dick move, and can result in a ban
---
BY LITTER BE PURGED
---
He didn't play in a raid, no. He AoE grinded solo.
---
&gt; hat is why they're is that damn trinket
---
Oof. THERE not THEY ARE
---
But you didn’t tank the run. And your mainspec is arms, even if you’re going to respec at 60? I personally would have passed on tank items to the tank.
---
You just use it in case theres a rogue. Worst case? You "wasted" the cooldown. Best case? You dont get fucked over by a rogue.
---
Not to mention the really low drop rate. A Mage rolled need on that because of the mana regen. Thankfully I ended up winning it but he couldn't understand why I was really mad because apparently the mana regen outweighs the healing so casters should roll need on it. The bullshit some players pull to justify crap.
---
it does not. Unless I have an older one.
---
This is how it works and this is how it is understood. You were not tanking. If someone is tanking and can use a shield and needs it, it is understood that this person should get it. 
---
In this case though it's really not that big of a deal. It's just SM. There are far worse ways to roll.
---
I'm more concerned about the default target cast bar. Absolutely no fucking idea why it's not implemented granting 99.9% of ppl use the addon for it (which is buggy)
---
Tailoring is great as you level up, not wait to lvl 60 and buy all the mats. You will have go out of your way to farm Wool, Silk and Mageweave and you'll get all the Runecloth you'll need from end game dngs as you go for BiS.
---
North has a lot of mob skipping so it's best to be max level
---
Now you think if it is multiboxing
---
This struck me as a bit weird, so I went and set my client to German (I'm from Germany, but usually play the game in English). Tried writing "Weniger" in chat. Not censored. Turned on spam and profantiy filter. Not censored. Logged onto a german server and tried again. Not censored.
---
Then I went and wrote the misspelled version "wenigger". That got censored, but only if the (optional!) profanity filter was active.
---
So yeah, I think you're maybe not entirely truthful here, OP.
---
Now I'm real interested in seeing your ui. The whole reason I love elvui is because how much cleaner everything gets. And how is it bloaty, all the add-ons that are built in are add-ons you should use anyways.
---
8 seconds tops (second consecrate). Or 3 seconds (consecrate+judge) if you are capable of attacking skull and arent opening with heroic strike/mind blast/other high threat moves.
---
Any advice if i get jumped ? It seems to be the issue ... druids or rogues
---
Well the rule you need on items that you need. So are gonne use. 
---
You use greed on items that you cant use so sell. 
---
A shield drops you cant use it you greed that the rule. 
---
The rule all need is stupid because the tank would have used the item.
---
He forgot to give the mining xp
---
If you're in uldaman with lvl 39 ....dude .....stop complaining and go in a dungeon at you're actual level range ..holy shit
---
You’ve really managed to capture the feel of all the dungeons you painted! Amazing!
---
For sure i do, but mostly to avoid any fights. I continually get wrecked because i can’t stop them from closing into my dead zone
---
The idea is a focus on survivability and efficiency as a Jack of all traded.  It's a slow play that works well with affliction locks and mages.  But alone doesn't stand out in any one area.  I played it back in the day for a while in BGs.  Escorting flag carriers it keeps you open for cc a lil dmg and heals.
---
The opposing faction dropping into stealth in my vicinity absolutely has to do with me.  
---
Think of it this way:  the combat log represents a part of my characters perception and is not limited to things that happen in combat or that originate from or happen directly TO me.  An addon that parses information that would be peculiar to my character is not cheating any more than parsing the name of the spell my target is casting from the same log.  In combat or out of combat is irrelevant; the "combat" log represents my characters perception of the world within their "senses" as defined by the draw distance and interaction range within the game.  Parsing a name and a level may be a little over the line, but I hardly think this is game-breaking.
---
Pattern dropped yesterday and everybody needed on it so didn't get it even though I was the only mage.
---
although to be fair I don't have tailoring.. :D
---
Circle of hate.  Every time I got ganked by someone 10+ levels higher than me I went on a massacre at the hillsbrad fields.  Now I do it when they gank my alts and I can’t find em.

Enjoyment is one thing, crying is a different thing.

No runes, no flasks, guess who is the I'm just here for the loot guy in raids.
---
Yeah so you are the ninja looter.
---
It still hurts when u have that rare 'day off' and see some people who are just online everyday in the morning when you're normally working.. no way to keep up with them. 
---
But true, reaching 60 and some raiding is def still possible now that we got responsibilities
---
They use a different formula for pvp. They work, but the +10 defense you get from talents is ultimately a fairly negligible bonus compared to the raw damage that players dish out. Protection also offers no magic resistance, only a minor increase to stun and charm resistance, which are nice but not reliable.
---
Yesterday I ran a dungeon on retail for a quest, Motherlode I think. It was this crazy AOE fest where agro didn't matter, nothing hit hard, and skill light shows everywhere.
---
I felt like I was playing Path of Exile.
---
Druid Tanks are sometimes extremely helpful. Activate the Manual Crowd Pummeler in and push the only two buttons you have. Nobody will ever catch up.
---
I liked it back in the day escorting flag carriers.

Obviously he didn't do it from level 1. And I'm not sure why you are even discussing this and spreading rumors? He streamed the whole thing. There's nothing to be discussed.
---
If you do the quest that has you collect the ghost spirits you can still use it on them after you complete the quest
---
I know it's hard to believe for greedy people like you, but yeah, if everyone else except the Druid pressed greed, I would too. If someone else pressed Need, I would too.
---
I know it's hard to accept in today's fucked up society, but yeah, I might actually let go of some gold in order to make someone else happy with their BiS item, as I don't view myself and my wallet as the only important thing in the world, unlike you. Without being either stupid or lying.
---
I see and accept that logic, if everyone needs, it's no problem. The problem is when some greed and some need, which will usually happen without prior discussion. in my experience someone would usually press Greed immediately, and then we'd agree to all greed, and so far everyone has followed it. in this situation you'd definitely be a ninja if you rolled last and decided to Need... unless you raidroll the item afterwards to give everyone an equal chance
---
I usually leave it as:
---
LFG Druid - Any role is a goal
---
Unless you're crit capped, then Tarnished Elven Ring is a better for PvE.
---
Wpvp is not a duel. There's no designated area. Just keep running and kiting.
---
&gt; Hello again in my thread! I'm really thankful for all these interesting comments in section below my Destiny post. There were a lot of usefull information u provided, for that, i am thankful.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; For those who not adknowledged with me: i play World of Warcraft: Vanilla, and i want to reveal mystery over RNG "Chance on hit: ... " affix on items such as Thrash Blade, or Silent Fang(spoilers!);
---
&gt; My previous posts:
---
&gt; Nightblade(4.8% proc rate) ;
---
&gt; Destiny(3.73% proc rate) ;
---
&gt; (further will be more)
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; Today i want to post stats of the famous sword, that 95-98% of warriors and rogues was using, if not using it right now since they ran Maraudon instance. The name of it is: Thrash Blade .
---
&gt; It is quest reward for Corruption of Earth and Seed (it have both Alliance and Horde versions);
---
/u/Aonoexorcisto We would love to have you over on the off meta [Discord](https://discord.gg/3JXSamG) and greatly appreciate your wisdom.
---
Is Engineering fun? I'm a Warlock.
---
I already feel strong in PvP, maybe having some gadgets and firepower would be neat.
---
I leveled Herb / Alchemy but left it behind because I got lazy, looking to switch into Tailoring / Engineering probably to get myself ready for endgame considering I have an abundance of gold because free mount.
---
Maybe I'll try and catch up Herb / Alch and then switch out herbalism for Engineering later on?
---
That middle macro is a fairly typical mouseover macro with the option to downrank if you hold shift.  
---
So if you mouseover a friendly player and press the button, you'll cast the heal at them.  If you're not moused over a friendly, you'll cast the heal at your target.  And if you're not moused over a friendly player, or targeting a friendly player, you'll heal yourself.  
---
If you hold shift and press/click that macro, it does the same thing but with the lower-ranked heal.  (Not really useful for Regrowth, but great for Healing Touch later on.  I just have all my heal macros work the same way in case I want to heal a lowbie or something).  
---
There aren't any addons that I know of that let you pop out of form if you try to talk to a vendor or read a sign, that kinda thing.
---
No he doesn't.
---
We thought he did, but after checking combat log we saw he didn't
---
What was the point of this post?
---
They're doing good DPS and they sure do make fights chaotic.
---
GY: at least 30
---
Lib: at least 34
---
Arms: at least 36
---
Cath: at least 40
---
That would be my recommendation
---
My drop rate on demonic runes was so bad
---
The 20 for my robe took a crazy amount of kills
---
Retail wow literally allows you to freeze your xp gains
---
As lvl 48 hunter i soloed him. It does take quite a while and if you care about being efficient Def not worth it. But if you like to solo stuff for the Challenge its a fun one.
---
95% of warrior tanks are arms until cap.
---
Its so much fun to see you only reponding to the few people that agree with you. 
---
I think its time to see you are the ass in this situation and change the way you believe need rolls should be going. 
---
Its stupid that people where harassing you afterwards that should not happen.
---
That said i would have put you on my and my guild blacklist.
---
That happened.
---
I will buy two
---
Then ask what people use, go look at screenshots are see if you like it. But there's no "best ui". 
---
The one you'll perform best with is the one your brain is familiar with. It's all muscle memory.
---
What is your energy tick addon?
---
Jesus man, congrats.  I'm still only level 25, and I'm just playing normal.
---
Grats!! Well deserved!
---
They do their best to tank dungeons, though.
---
Just always roll according to the role that you are doing... so yea if you are tanking you can need on a shield. If no one else needs it, ask first if its oke and then need for leveling..... its so simple 😅
---
I hate that racial so much. The few times I have lost a tank when I have had plenty of mana? Because they decided to mortal strike themselves for 30 seconds...
---
Zug Zug
---
I am not complaining. In fact I can heal quite effective when mobs are 4+ lvls above me. Healers don't miss with their healing abilities, unlike dps who can't do any output due to misses or tanks, who's taunts are resisted and misses make aggro generation wery weak. I might add that I was constantly juggling between healing group and kiting two mobs in bear form, while my HoTs did their job.
---
Gotta learn his rotation though
---
How do you track energy ticks in cat form?
---
if they keep everything at level 60 (whitch they would have to) and make classic+ this way, they could always release TBC if classic+ failes.
---
so i think they have nothing to lose if they do C+
---
i also would (after P6) realy like new content with the vanilla minset at its base
---
You don't need to go deep prot at all.
---
Fury is the way, you can still get every relevant prot skills while being fury specced. If you need to go tanky, gear is the thing you need to look at. Just switch out your tps gear to mitigation gear.
---
They're pretty mediocre at best offtanks, though. They don't build any threat when not being hit, so building secondary threat is hard.
---
Hit skills.   Find Leatherworking.   Click the little icon that looks like a cancel button.   Unlearn leatherworking.
---
Sometimes I roll my eyes but I mostly laugh inside when I read things like that.

https://youtu.be/RhvIISDoarU
---
&gt; I'm getting kinda sick of these whiny tank posts. The actual act of Classic tanking isn't that hard.
---
&gt; You can auto-pilot if you or your group isn't in a hurry. You can lose aggro on 1-2 mobs and not instantly kill someone else (this changes in later expansions). You can completely ignore those mobs too, most of the time, unless they're hurting your bae (healer). You can screw up and the rest of the group can fix it. And you have the privilege of walking into any dungeon you want in 15 minutes or less.
---
As someone who tanked on a Shaman on pservers (harder than Classic). Indeed, tanking in Classic is not rocket science. Hell, I pushed the limit of what can tank in WoW, just for the fun of it.
---
Can you even call that a UI haha. 
---
As a healer I need unit frames, I need pots available on my bar, etc. I can probably hide my action bar for spells but I like having it to see cooldowns and reduce chance of missclicks.
---
How are you playing with 0 visible spells though, isn't warlocks known for having super many spells that gets frequently used, have you really memorized different keybindings for them all?
---
I would land some massive crit on dat ass
---
He used to make league videos with uberdanger, used to go by the name “keyori”
---
I think you're being insincere saying that the sword's price isn't influenced by appearance more than anything. It could be a gray and still sell for more than bis items.
---
The scope of the addon is pretty clearly defined: it's not for activating abilities, casting spells, or anything else you would actively do in combat beyond targeting, and even then it's not a very practical method for picking someone up in the flurry of a melee in world pvp.  It identifies members of the opposing faction when they are nearby, tries to determine their class and potential level, provides a method for marking certain players as KoS, and a method for targeting them (via mouse-click).  
---
That's it.
---
Frankly, the most useful part of this addon for me is the ability to pull up a log of members of the opposite faction whom I have encountered, view my record in prior encounters with them, and mark them as KoS.  If you think that the addon is what's tipping the scales against you in world pvp I would suggest you give it a try yourself; the impact is far smaller than some think it is.
---
In purple side there is a small corridor with demons
---
How do you get past them?
---
my comments aren't personally against you, I'm just passionate on the topic. I actually think you redeemed yourself by giving the item to the tanks (I hope they equipped it after you traded it to them).
---
thing is I'm fine with the All need thing if it's agreed and done by everyone. if most of the raid doesn't agree to it, then you have no right to still need the item. or, you can in order to "prevent ninjaing" like many say, but then you should raidroll the item afterwards to give everyone a chance.
---
In my playstyle as a warrior I stance dance with a macro that also switches my weapons/shield.
---
I don't mind tanking or DPS, but if my shield is much crap compared to the new one, or my 2h, then I ask the party but I intend to need.
---
Afaik agi and str are 1:1 maybe slight favour to agi. 10 str is 20 ap. So elven beats it out

The fuck were you doing in Westfall at 58?

Of all things I've experienced so far nothing bothered me except ppl safespotting in everlook while trying to buy runecloth bag recipe. I don't mind getting fucked while in a open world by high lvl ppl
---
You can get a good community by poaching, if you current guild has something to offer.
---
I was raiding in one of the highest ranked nordic guilds in the world back in WoD/Legion, and I got poached from a lower tier guild, but since I liked the guild that poached me, I stuck around until I quit raiding in BFA.
---
That said, we surely had some people who we poached, who then went off to other guilds, so it is a risk you have to take.
---
You can do it with the standard combat sword pve build but i prefer doing it with the hemo pvp coldblood/prep build for faster movement speed in stealth.
---
&gt; On my shaman I joined a ZF group as DPS (enhancement, two-hander, no shield or 1h available).
---
&gt; They forced me to tank and pulled like crazy while I was desperately trying to regen mana/hp. I kept telling them to slow down, that I am not a tank, and that I didn't choose this. They just ignored me and we wiped 3 times before I just left.
---
&gt; I understand that some groups can be really bad. And it can be hard to manage the people side of things. But that was one group. I'm not about to complain on reddit about that. I just shrugged and found another group.
---
&gt; I think I was probably right: Its just reporting bias (or whatever its called when you only hear from one "side" of an argument, because they constantly complain).
---
I'd suggest reading this [Shaman Tank guide](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150) if you ever get into a similar situation.
---
I think there's obviously a big mindset difference between EU and US, yeah. All BoE's I've seen so far on EU were "all greed", you know, as intended.
---
You mean hit capped
---
I went and cleared MC 2 times as a mage over the last 2 weeks. Both with complete random grps and some not lvl 60. Both under 2,5h for all 10 bosses. Both without using a single health or mana pot. Both without a wipe. Both being in the top 5 overall dps.
---
HERE IS WHAT YOU (REALLY) HAVE TO DO:
---
- Listen when bosses are being explained.
---
- Have remove curse, frostbolt, iceblock and blizzard on hotkeys. 
---
- Show up.
---
That's it. Everything else is not necessary.
---
Good luck to your grp and drops.
---
There's a cooldown tracker as well as a dot tracker, but you basically only see those in combat.
---
[This is my keybind layout](https://i.imgur.com/HXShZgv.png).
---
Dusky leather armor set is a great way to make some money off of mid-level rogues
---
I havent gone as far as getting +fire damage gear but I had some testing with Hellfire instead of Rain of Fire, I pulled with instant dots and hellfired, I cleared the packs yes, but I was completely out of mana and health at the end of the combat. I would assume we cant get enough mana to kill packs reliably with RoF before they reach us and push back too much, also I dont know how we'd make the distance in the first place (grenades?). RNG stuns and slows could spread the pack too much also.
---
How do you setup energy ticks in elvui?
---
Druid gets it a little easier for that,  savage- cower- powershift- shred- shred- powershift- cower- bite
---
As an arms warrior I disagree : the dps when ss + ww   is huge and healers mana bar should  regen fast.  even when tanking a single mob with 2h : more threat and more dps.
---
I've charged lowbies or same-level horde to gap close onto a mob before. Always gets some funny reactions.
---
I would have never got a tank for WC last Saturday afternoon on a high pop server (Windseeker, not ultra high, but can get pretty packed on the weekends) if I wasn't creative with the ads I put in LFG. We got a tank, everyone was friendly and nice and it was a really good run. We took our time, but we enjoyed ourselves, had fun, made jokes and eventually cleared it and everyone had a great time!
---
Ironic because on netherwind its the same thing but alliance. Small raid of 10 to 15 lvl 45 to 60 allys were camping mara after a small skirmish a gnome mage started. One of the worst dungeon days I have ever had.
---
I have made it a goal to MC every ally I can on the boats and waste their time by making them swim. 
---
This cycle of hatred and animosity is why the Horde and Alliance will ner get along.
---
But there are some nice guys out there and I will sometimes help the allys if I see one questing and getting close to dying.
---
People DO buy stuff. Because leather drops\quests rewards are pure pile of horseshit in classic(and were in vanilla). I see lots of people using Warsong boots and Triprunner Dungarees past level 40. Same goes for Shoulders. There are some but they are either BOE drop or drop from rare mobs in Dungeon. I saw everyone (like Dru, Sham, Rogue, and even War) rolling on blue leather shoulders  in RFK and same happens in Mara(minus Warriors because they actually start getting decent gear with plate)
---
So you can sell some stuff. The problem is that most of those recipes are common, easy to craft and are used in leveling of LW so it sells dirt cheap(and is often bough by leveling enchanters).
---
But, for example, there are some items like this https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4252/dark-leather-shoulders
---
sells for 1.5g each on my server. But Agi potion is costly. If you have alt with alchemy you can make some profit with it. You won't be ultra-rich, but it do earn you money.
---
Sorry I'm just joking because you're obviously not and everyone else said you were
---
I didn't even know you existed until 30 seconds ago...
---
Yes. Fear enemies while theyre fighting mobs.
---
Fear mobs when they fight with players from my faction.
---
Pop some curse of doom onto every enemy that passes by.
---
Dots are beautiful yk. You can kill someone without them realizing it was you.
---
It was a pretty long run for me from Tarren Mill.
---
I saw that people suggest the rock elements there but their location was overcrowded with people all the time.
---
So I just took all the quests in that area and finished them all. I think that all of them were quests where you have to kill things. 
---
Then I just stayed and killed wolfs ( feral crag coyote i think ) because there are tons of them and I can skin them.
---
Now im back at STV and that place can drive me crazy , too many people.

Thanks for the explanation. I didn’t believe it has “tipping” scales power as that’s a silly claim, both sides can be using it equally.
---
Haha, non of these newbs got that this was /s

Good job op
---
Ahh yes, keep these post coming. Good to see the no changes mentality biting others in the ass. Classic+ is coming.
---
Wrong. It warns you if a enemy *uses* stealth within combat log range. Blizzard went to some pretty extreme lengths to ensure that stealthed characters, for all intents and purposes, don't exist anywhere except their own client. It's actually the reason stealth makes a sound when you use it, just a sort of unintended side effect. Spy won't tell you if there's a stealthed player around because it *can't* see them. What it can see is if an unstealthed player uses an ability to give stealth.
---
You still can't be sure I still exists...
---
Yeah, perhaps I'm wrong, it's just that you see these comments on pretty much every single post about women playing.
---
Well I'm out of the loop.
---
Well done! Do you mind telling us about the process? Which programs do you use? Do you use premade models for the characters? Nice work!
---
oh yeah! total forgot they published dm in advance
---
Some others I use:
---
    Ravage when in stealth, or Shred otherwise
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [stealth] Ravage; Shred
---
    Same, but with Pounce/Rake
---
    /cast [stealth] Pounce; Rake
---
    FF (Feral) if in cat/bear, or regular FF otherwise
---
    /cast [stance:1/3] Faerie Fire (Feral); Faerie Fire
---
    Aquatic form if in water, or Travel form otherwise.  Hold control to powershift (for breaking roots, etc)
---
    /cancelform [nostance:2/4][mod:ctrl]
---
    /cast [swimming] Aquatic Form; Travel Form
---
    Instant stealth from any form, or toggle off stealth if already stealthed (for some reason this one broke the other day and I had to add the /cancelaura line. 
---
    #showtooltip Prowl
---
    /cancelform [noform:3]
---
    /cast [noform:3] Cat Form
---
    /cancelaura [stealth] Prowl
---
    /cast Prowl
---
I don't agree.
---
The threat drop is split amongst the number of people hit. So if you’ve got 20 people stacked up, each person’s threat is only dropping by 5%
---
It’s the only reason I haven’t been ganked 1k times instead of like 500. I love the addon. Wpvp is better when you know people are arround so you are more careful with you pulls. The only person I have seen complain about it was a rogue. I 100% don’t want it banned.
---
Thank you.  This place changed my life.

It's most definitely not some "reddit rule". It's been like this for me since closed beta and everyone I know or have played with agrees with this. It's to avoid ninja looting and that's it. People here do not seem to understand that everyone needs the boe item as nobody is entitled for it, can use or not. It's gold and needs to be thought in that way. As always there's no point in arguing over reddit so i'm done with this shit.
---
I thought this was the most evil thing warlocks do until I did the orc warlock succubus quest. Where you get a noble lady orc to trust you, and she sends you to find her lost lover in the barrens. Who it turns out, has been tortured for days by quilboar and lost his arms and legs. And then you LEAVE HIM THERE after promising to take his necklace back to his love in orgrimmar, except you just take the necklace yourself for your demon ritual and never tell the orc lady a thing.
---
curse of doom only works on mobs so I know you're lying
---
In all honestly, A lot of these "You're the asshole" are saying the same thing. I am appreciative of those who can see the understanding I have when it comes to BoE gear that is completely unpredictable and not for claim to anyone.
---
The text  in the lower right, no not the tank announcement, the other one, yeah that one. So did I.
---
For real? I have done over 100 ubrs runs with the key never used it. Took me 127  runs (counted) to get the mainhand weapon.
---
So that isn’t it.  There has to be something before it.  That guide mentions a mithril order in STV?  Is that it?
---
In pvp, Protection is more of a cc bot spec than anything else. You're left more vulnerable to casters than non-Prot warriors, since it'll take you longer to kill them and you gain no inherent protection against them from the tree. And while your physical damage reduction will be through the roof, the lack of the kind of on-demand burst that Arms or Fury can put out leaves you in a bad spot when enemy healers are in play.
---
That said, you're a cc *monster.* Concussive Blow only shares a diminishing return category with Intercept, meaning you can open with a 6s from out of combat. And like Charge, the Improved Revenge stun has no dr category, either, meaning that as you proceed to never die against physical attackers, you get to reciprocate with a fairly reliable stun. Finally, until enough weapon chain patterns drop to make them fairly ubiquitous, Disarm and its 13s duration will reliably fuck anyone who relies on melee attacks.
---
Meanwhile, against casters, Shield Bash can be talented for a 3s silence, and Shield Slam has a chance to dispel the defensive buffs they rely on to live through physical attackers. Also, Revenge can be used on anyone once triggered, letting you get that 45% stun chance on a caster thanks to other enemies giving you procs.
---
So yeah. In group/organized pvp, a prot warrior is a monster with backup, but can't function well on their own at all. They'll lose most 1v1s, especially against healers, because their ability to finish anyone off is pretty limited. But give them a Rogue and a healer backup, and they'll punch far, far above what they should thanks to all the cc they bring.
---
&gt;  5-7%
---
FWIW, I get 11.5% as a 40 warrior in plate when I equip the shield from SM instead of a 2h.
---
That's 4% more rage...
---
They both use the same functionality. Damage meters don't just pull numbers out their ass, they read and display the combat log in a cleaner, more efficient manner. Spy does the same exact thing, only it displays player names instead of damage numbers. Break Spy and you break every damage meter out there, and likely a whole host of other addons in the process. There are certain hills you stand on, and this is not one of them.
---
I'm polymorph other faction players as I go along, even higher lvl some kill me after 😁
---
How old are you two?
---
Don't people realize that dishonorable kills will fuck up their honor rank?
---
Sounds dumb. I get all my Scholomance groups together in Westfall like a normal person. *Sometimes* Duskwood.
---
Ah thanks a lot, I've been searching for a working Trinket menu forever now hehe
---
always bugs me I cant use thistle tea or rage pots, at least I can convert mana to rage/energy, but its shit
---
We normally clear up to Rend with 5 man in order to farm for Briarwood and Truestrike/Swords. This way, we've gotten our loots a lot faster than we would have done if we made full 10 man runs.
---
A run up to rend takes approx 35 minutes with a 5 man group, so you can really farm for those items.
---
With a 10 man group you might do it in 20ish, but then you have to roll for stuff instead.
---
Bs.
---
Lvling dungeons = roll for solo and dungeon gear.
---
you get the mithirl order quest form the ones i mentioned in the above post,
---
are you sure you are level 40 or higher and above blacksmithing 200?
---
God I wish you could have played ogres instead of bloodelves in BC and I would've sticked for an eternity no matter how Wotlk started to annoy me.
---
I only play on PvE to, just for this reason. But I turn war mode on on retail to make rep-grinds faster, and groups of 6 ganking me is not quite fast. So yeah basically that's how I ended up to this post.
---
/pray
---
Cant believe you are proud for being this pathetic
---
Thanks for the insight. I'm still very low level on my rogue but it is extremely fun landing the huge crits. Also I guess I'll ask while I'm here, should I ever even use expose armor? It seems quite niche.
---
52-60 was my breakdown range.
---
45 and 222.
---
the only thing it was missing was a scarab wipe.
---
Indeed. Although I think he’s new to classic, or even wow for that matter, so he doesn’t know the rules of STV.
---
Go full destro with conflagrate for delicious big numbers
---
I've had two mages and a priest throughout different dungeons. They wouldn't shut up in chat about how high they were. It was on the edge of bragging how high they are. We finished the dungeons, but they were really annoying with that weed talk. 
---
And two times we wiped in a dungeon because the priest passed out multiple times during because of smoking weed. It was in the afternoon.
---
 /raidinfo
---
Gives you the current lockout timings, if you have any
---
As a mage player I would have mages at chaotic neutral. Most of the time I don't really care, sometimes I'll be feeling nice and give you some water, and sometimes I'll send you to darnassus at the end of a raid/dungeon.
---
Sounds like you should have rolled a pve server.
---
but you are the one who claimed it when 6 or however many others didn't even get the chance.
---
Well it seems nice :) personally I would miss click way too much if I had 0 visible spells though :p
---
What do you do with chat, damage meter and threat meter btw?
---
did you already learn waponsmithing?
---
because you can only learn 1 of these 2.
---
also the blacksmithtrainer in bootybay trains blacksmithing over 225 to 300, but thats a different thing
---
it actually happened. It's not such a weird and rare thing to happen. Kids are awkward like that.
---
Your traps are dirt cheep mana wise, use em. Drop the ice trap before combat starts and walk about 4 feet in front of it, trap will trigger on back stabbers before they get their first attack off. When you get to StV for your bow quests do this before every pull, turned like 5 ganks into kills.
---
&gt; because that would be stylish as fudge.
---
The true endgame.
---
At 305 weapon skill you need 6% hit to never miss an ability against a lvl 63 enemy. So with precision, you need 1% hit.
---
Not sure how higher weapon skill than 305 affects the requirements though.
---
Here are some of mine: 
---
\- Obviously in a 40 man, you only need 1 main tank and 1 - 2 offtanks, the main tank gets prior on gear and (usually) Thunderfury, the offtanks get whatever the MT doesn't need and spend classic tanking a adds. 
---
\- A deep prot/fury prot spec require that you gimp your character in anything other than a 40 man raid or spend 100g every week respecing between raids. 
---
\- Tanking takes work. You have to learn the tactics, know the way around the dungeon/raid, decide the pull order and so on. 
---
\- You get the highest cost repairs, highest requirement for use of consumables and enchants. 
---
\- Most of the time you're part leader, part party member and about 50% social worker/teacher for DPS Players who haven't bothered learning how to play their class, or work as part of a team and are fixated on one thing, the DPS meter.
---
As far as I understand for ret, there's basically two schools of thought; you can go SoR, stack spellpower and magic on-hits that scale with said spellpower, or gear like a warrior with SoC.
---
Nope. Not really. I see it more as a PvP talent you get combined with Frostbite and Shatter.  
---
For kiting I use Cone of Cold and Blizzard rank 1.
---
No.  The guy in IF just says to talk to one or the other, but neither of them do anything.
---
Oh it definitely was multiboxing
---
You can duo farm DME as fury war and healer.
---
I ain't the same without original mail fonts.
---
From a member of End Game who was in the discord when the bounty for poaching was offered - YEET is a smaller guild, and the GM of End Game is trying to get more 60s to fill multiple raid teams. Don't let the guy lie to you, his version of a very polite fuck off was "Oh thank you, but as much as I would love to have my guild absorbed by yours, I actually have a brain, so fuck off." He said something rude, which then in turn triggered the GM of End Game to offer a bounty for people to poach from them. Obviously he didn't take it that far, because now we're here. Everybody in our discord was saying, "People are just gonna whisper their members and tell them, hey if you leave your guild and join mine I'll split the gold with you," etc... hence the OP SS of the whisper to that exact nature. I know over the last week our guild has grown to some extent, where we have 2 full raid teams and we're building a 3rd for weekend raiders. Honestly, trying to give people the opportunity to raid in a guild, with the functionality of being in a loot system, progress and see end game content.
---
I think y'all are crazy to not believe Hamish was in on this, but that's just me.  Why would they let him in on their shit if he wasn't part of the crew?
---
I dont have a butt buddy.  Plus how do we split the loot?
---
not if you're a warrior as you get rage from the extra hits - it's difficult to translate what that rage increase equates to in dps, but it aint nothing.
---
not really though
---
You need on an item you can't use that is someone's upgrade.
---
This is so sad. At least my families kodos went to happily retire on a farm somewhere on Kodo Island.
---
At least that one follows you instead of the other way around so you can avoid most mobs along the way.
---
Don’t forgget about new spell ranks !
---
lol, its like dude we finish this quest and I'll get a nice blue one chill
---
He doesn't pull aggro
---
Just start of with an extra low level dungeon or something so the playerbase can give feedback about itemization etc.
---
My worry is some lv 60 dungeon with OP gear.
---
Catch rate?
---
I don't know if this counts as fun, but a Warrior did what you did to me, except he feared me... So naturally I kept him Polymorphed/Rooted for 7 minutes before making him die to mobs and spirit ressing.
---
Wow I first thought that I made this post since I have the exact same experience.
---
I saw a guide yesterday about hunter pvp and that player had a macro on feign death and ice trap. 
---
That way you can get some distance. But we need to be lvl 30 for that spell.
---
Frostmage here. I'm farming the boss on my own. Killed him 37 times, never saw "of Shadow Wrath". But two times "of Fiery Wrath"
---
i mean if you're gonna swap the specs out then lets do all of them.
---
Retribution paladin is clearly chaotic good.
---
10 attack power is like 1.5 dps
---
1% crit is pretty much 1.3% increased damage.
---
Your dps at 56 is probably 250 or so, so the crit is more valuable!
---
Have fun!
---
Its actually a pretty bad item. You cant get close to the 'Warden Staff' stats due to the lack of offhands AND most importantly: Dire Maul is around the corner and drops a good alternative for Warden Staff
---
Hahahaha too true. Fucking Redridge. Started it for the third time yesterday and gave up on that area pretty quick. The first time felt like it took the longest, probably due to the amount of people also doing the quest, but damn it took like 15 boar kills to get the last snout for the Redridge goulash.
---
Could you give me a link? Now I am curious
---
I dont know if this is correct. Our "wolf"; a hunter pet, was above every other player during a wipe-fiesta last time we split-raided her. While the other raid gave onyxia a one-shot, my grp hat 10 wipes before tank finally got first-aggro in p3. the 9 pulls before, she just attacked everything she wanted to.
---
Watch a guide once and just have fun. Its really not so hard.
---
This is fucking fantastic.
---
What I like about 5 points is that it's really helpful in dungeons too. Slap Renew on people and wand away. You last hit a mob every now and then so you don't need as much downtime with drinking. If there is a mage in the party though, not as important since you drink very pack...
---
you should see what hilarious mess the holy tree was before the paladin revamp... i think even hunter's survival (or outsdoorman) was better
---
No, there are many aspects of open world pvp that enrich the experience. But what's never fun for anyone involved is the result of incentivizing players to collect head counts because that turns spontaneous and natural world pvp into an artificial meat grinder.
---
I think the only thing I get is a better main hand weapon as a lock. Also I'll there's 2 other pieces I can get that will be better than what I have atm but aren't pre raid bis, but I'm not even level 60 yet so the pre bis will eventually come.
---
Well now that song is stuck in my head the rest of the day... Its a banger tho
---
Wow this sucks
---
the one in WPL with Taelin Fordring - he actually escorts you!
---
powershifting is the way forward, but you need a big mana pool
---
Medium through all day, High in the evening. Faction balance pretty much 50/50.
---
Transferred from gehennas 3 weeks ago, haven’t regretted it since. Only reason you should not transfer is if you love huge (imo overpopulated) servers.
---
Bonus: The tank also goes out of line of sight.
---
Chuck a fire ress pot you cheap bastard
---
But how ..it being a pve server and all
---
I will regularly Scattershot -&gt;Feign Death -&gt;Then Frost Trap. Then mount up and ride off
---
I love that classic is bringing back great wow content on YouTube.
---
I rememeber watching tales of Mojache the gnome mage and Pepitos the feline master.
---
Good times.
---
these are on Par w those
---
Are they just not executing correctly?
---
Best for the nature does not equal good. Nature doesnt have morals.
---
Remember cenarius attacking people cutting wood? Thats not a good action.
---
Not siding with someone , like the factions, is also neutral.
---
Dude, I gotta ask, how rich or gullible are your parents to pay a subscription for an 8 year old? I was 16 and had a job with vanilla cane out so I just paid my own way. I always assumed 14ish was the absolute lowest age that someone could’ve been to actually have played vanilla in 2004/2005 era. If my kid asked me to pay money for his 8 year old ass to play wow I’d tell him to go play Mario. Just seems insane to me.

Lawful Good: Paladin | Neutral Good: Priest | Chaotic Good: Hunter
---
Lawful Neutral: Warrior | True Neutral: Druid/Shaman | Chaotic Neutral: Rogue
---
Lawful Evil: Shadow Priest | Neutral Evil: Warlock | Chaotic Evil: Mage
---
Paladins always felt like they had more law and structure (Lawful Good) than Priests, and priests are just good for the sake of being good (Neutral good). Hunters usually mean well but when the Huntard inside every Hunter comes out it's certainly chaotic.
---
Warriors just want to get things done. They make good tanks for this reason, as they can lead and set orders to be followed (Lawful Neutral). Druids and Shamans are almost always depicted as the paragon of True Neutral in most fantasy. Rogues don't really care if what they're doing is good or evil, and they don't really care what methods they use to do it as long as it benefits them (Chaotic Neutral.
---
Shadow Priests go into Lawful Evil because nothing else really fits. I'd say they're probably more neutral evil but either way. Warlocks literally bind demons from the Twisting Nether to their will and torture people to gain power. They are just evil all the time. (Neutral Evil). Mages are pure Chaotic Evil. If you don't believe me, I just have have one thing to say. Portal Roulette.

not rlly, warden staff is better for dmg reduction, but you just stack resists and can allways use stonescale potions, you need the pummelers for the threat
---
Why do people keep saying this? You get all the important talents in the prot tree, all you need is a shield. Beyond last stand - what is it that you want in the prot tree? 
---
Your beef is with idiots not knowing when to put on a shield, not the spec.
---
+1, he must have seen all these "LF2M DPS SM CATH, SHIELD RESERVED" types of LFG chats.

Dude those are 2 different countries
---
I also play Horde on Bigglesworth, def not a dead server lol.
---
The Alliance are directly under the sun . . . NOW. They are hatless, repeat, hatless.
---
Point was to make the full run faster, not for the tank to make maximum amount of threat.
---
Mages neutral??? Bullshit.
---
&gt; Now mind you, I am a warlock. I also have had a very difficult time gaining money
---
Uh, what? warlocks are one of the best gold makers. I made 50g from soloing and skinning devilsaurs just from questing in ungoro at lvl 53. 
---
&gt; I have decidedly opted to say I am not the asshole.
---
Nah, you saw people greed it before. If everyone went to greed, you should have too. Kinda sucks but if youre gonna get hot and bothered over it tell the group beforehand if any boe blue/purple drops to just roll need.

we dont need distance, we face tank all with void sacrifice shield(%30 shield increase talent too) and rng stun might help a lot, chance is not that low and while 10 mob pounding your face, any stunned mob is a benefit. also since we aoe kill the whole area, we can just eat and drink later, just like mages drinking after the pull.
---
But ofc i am talking theorically here. i wanted to ask experienced warlocks before i try this. don't wanna look like i am giving an expert opinion here.
---
your special items that proc things also count as buffs.  EG: Thrash blade's extra hit proc counts as a buff.
---
Absolutely love it! Amazing work
---
No, he means that literally a THIRD of players roll undead, which nullifies the only CC priest has. 
---
"oh they can only use it once" some might say, well then after that it doesnt really matter, most melee classes will kill a priest before fear is even up again.
---
Engineering is without a doubt the most beneficial pvp profession. My advise would be too farm up a solid amount of gold with ur herm/alch, and then swap either one out with engineering when u got enough gold saved up. On my server it costs u around 350g for 1-300 engineering
---
It doesn't stop them from spawning, but it gives you enough time to kill him before they reach that place.
---
You can still pvp on pve servers. If you attack a faction npc, it will flag you as pvp.
---
Im happy you're on the horde side fam.
---
I've seen some warriors using it for aoe groups and it did quite well

Blizzard called it VC in their strategy guide from 04.

+1 delete that shit

Delete this now! Dont show people this spot

Dual spec, its a no brainer!
---
Thanks:)
---
&gt;making the first 3% hit you normally need obsolete and therefor your yellow hits can't miss with 6% hit on your Gear
---
So do white hits...
---
until thunderfury. at that point the MT's of guilds that get it get broken good AEO threat. until then i will enjoy my bear

Not to be letting you down or anything but you won’t be topping many raid meters as balance.

Just do iT man.... been a boomie from the start and its glorious
---
You can CLEARLY see the goblin guard standing next to OP in the video clip.  Open your eyes.  OP is not in any sort of safe spot.
---
Thats why the rogue is neutral evil. He obeys the law ... if it suits him and breaks it if it doesnt
---
Getting jumped puts you at an instant disadvantage because of the deadzone.
---
General tips: put a Freezing Trap at your feet on every pull. The mana cost is low and the CD is low enough for you to have decent uptime.
---
If you get caught off guard by a stealth class:
---
If you're levelling you likely do NOT have scattershot, so intimidation into your next move is what you're crutching on.
---
For a rogue, recall pet, feign and trap, walk while poison wears off, cast hunters mark while walking, jump flare at the rogue, turn around and aimed shot at 3.5s left. Make sure to sting him if you managed to get a good 30 yards distance otherwise you may want to hold it for a second freezing. 
---
For a bear, intimate into scare beast. If he drops form in time, feign trap and pretty much do the rogue cycle, but you may want to viper sting because a druid is going to try to outlast you.
---
I dont use any. But using Leatrix and enabling the setting "fast looting" is definitely worth it.
---
Instead of macroing all the spells, I might want to cast, I just put the button that puts me back in caster-form on an easily reachable key in all forms. In my case "c".
---
I always tought Niger was the englisch translation for Nigeria. I feel retarded now.
---
Decent dps for one minute and you'll be oom sadly
---
Awesome work!!!
---
what the fuck.
---
So you can't aoe powerlevel with a 60 mage in stockade or SM any more?
---
Personally I'd switch druid and shaman. Elements of the shaman are chaotic and powerful, while the druid is neutral due to seeking balance in their powers

The chicken doesn't follow you, that's the turtle.
---
Many early dungeons include stunnable bosses. 
---
Mr Smite is also stunnable. If you hit him at HE right health percentage, you can get him last the point where he would normally stomp and stun the party. 
---
If you don't have a stun and are a barely-able-to-enter group, you can kite him back and get extra time to range attack him while he runs to the chest.
---
I'm sure many players rolled on a pvp server because it makes the open world more lively and thrilling which enhances to the leveling experience in phase one. But if you think that a shit ton of players aren't going to quit in phase two, you're delusional. It's simply bad game design to incentivizing headcount kills in open world pvp.

---
That's the true classic experience though.  Vanish was a busted spell that would work like 75% of the time in real vanilla.

I remember this happening all the time.

I think Paladins could also bubble out of the sleep.

How do you farm both when you can only track 1 at a time?

It\`s basically, warrior\`s Intimidating shout.

Well in classic you are a nobody.  In retail you are the savior of azeroth.. champion og the alliance/horde. And vamquiser of evil. Everyone knows the hero.

There are a few addons for zooming/moving the character when prewieving.

For singletarget DW fury will shit on 2h fury. 2h fury has more aoe potential because of higher weapon dmg but thats about it. Singletarget DW is the way to go. (Classicbis.com doesnt even list 2h fury so thats that.)
---
It’s actually extremely cheap and easy to level at 60. And the pattern is cheap as hell compared to the mats required to make the robe, that’s the expensive part

Could be possible with feral/healer too. Maybe a bit slower but still good money.
---
Skinning and fishing. The true road to sustainable wealth in Classic.

i dont think its a trinket.

Pretty sure it happened over time with the X-Pac creep where deadmines and dire maul went from being weeks/months apart to mere hours in some cases.

Vailing Caverns (with a German accent, of course)

yea, that would be bad, but they could make new interseting things that dont have to be better, just different

You're right, I'm still leveling so blood craze has been a minor convenience, but I will respec for fury raiding very soon and make the suggested changes. Thank you for your help!

can confirm. why wouldn't I use it?!

or alternatives to 'nam for 30-45

 5 -second rule also does t apply to casting, but to channeling or finishing a spell, so you can start casting a 1 second spell at the 4 second mark and still get your spirit tick before finishing the cast.
---
Tanaris south east, i know. Because i gank alot of lvl 40 - 48s while fishing. The corpserun is long.
---
I just always run already to the next pack while we are still fighting the last pack. This way you are already in healing range for the next pack and have sufficient time drinking
---
Can´t read the site ... is there any information about the german server Lucifron?
---
I think he’s still using the SM one?
---

---
Techically we all "need" gold so should all just roll need on everything? Listen, man, you fucked up but don't beat yourself up for it, shit happens and people move on. At least you tried to remedy the situation. Hopefully you've learned something and font roll need on the next one.
---
Nobody going to mention how he's just been calling you a Jew over and over? Are you Jewish? Is he German? Seems like a lot of assumptions being made man.
---
that would make it to easy to adapte, i dont like that
---
Everyone I knew called it DM on Doomhammer.
---
yeah, I think if a BoE for a class drops that they actually need and will immediately equip, it should go to them. you can think they're very lucky, and they are, but I just don't see why regular loot rules wouldn't apply. you want to sell the item, so for you it's not a NEED. 
---
I'm sure that if the roles were reversed, i.e. your BiS item dropped and someone who cant use it took it from you, you wouldn't be happy about it and you'd prefer if you were allowed to take it.
---
and nah, I'm not backing out of my stance, my stance will always be Need before greed no matter the value of the item, but I can see the merits of the other school of thought "everyone gets a fair chance at the gold". So if the group decides to go that route, I'm ok with that, but I'm also ok with giving the item to the guy that needs it. thing is your situation wasn't either of these.
---
just a few days ago I had a situation where Belt of the Ordained (pala healer BiS) dropped in Scholo (~250g). 3 guys pressed greed, I waited, and the Paladin (tank) asked if he can Need it because he will respec to Holy and will equip it by the end of the week. the other guys said "just greed it, its 250g", pala still wasn't selecting anything, and I selected greed even though it was probable that he would take it, and I was prepared to let him have it. Pala ended up accidentally passing it while writing a message, and I won it :P

All of them are mind controlled by the burning legion though. Before Balnazzar infiltrated the scarlet crusade they were aiming to destroy the scourge, which is lawful good. But being mind controlled is literally not your fault.
---
LFG
---
Also: You can cast 1 heal and immediately start drinking again. The 'in combat' only starts like 5 ms after the cast ended, thus allowing in combat drinking

You know that you totally can link items in classic?

It's less than 4% as the extra attack resets your swingtimer. Worst case you gain close to nothing from a proc if it happens right at the end of your swing recharge. Same goes for Hand of Justice and sword specialization.
---
This is why sword rogues should try to use their Sinister Strike right after a mainhand hit.
---
Rule of thumb: for the minimum level start with lvl 30 and go up 3 levels every wing, so 30, 33, 36, 39.
---
I preffer a new dungeon for level 30-50 so we can see how blizzard manages itemization.
---
Savage - this is so good.
---
You definitely will. As you work towards your BiS you'll realize they probably come from a variety of dungeons so you will need to hop all over the place

maybe a few achivments, but none that would be connected to how good you are in PvP or PvE.

like, add the ones with "kill every enemy race and class combination" in PvP but not "reaching rank 10 in the hornor system"

Ran ST a few times in the last couple of days, it's not dispellable.

If you join the party as dps do not roll on the tanks wishlist items. Its a dick move

No.

How do the warriors deal with all the imps?
---
I bought one. For my tank druid. When I'm doing or tanking I use it. 100 armor in caster form +5 def. And 360 armor in bear form. 
---
 If I'm spellcasting/healing I slap on my healing set and staff. It's good u till you get an upgrade. Which won't be awhile for me. And I'm a lvl 47 druid.
---
It's on the AH on Lucifron EU right now and could be yours for the compelling price of just 9999 gold.
---
You guys can stop posting this comment now I got it
---
are there even female ogres?
---
Just roll a pve server. If not, you knew what you signed up for.
---
You covered some pretty good stuff but I'll share my two cents on it as well and answer any lingering questions.
---
We have 15years of data at our fingertips that has trivialized the game to unbelievable degrees, nearly everything is viable to some extent. People are getting info from others who haven't played since 2004. People are under the impression the game is hard and min-maxing is necessary to kill a boss, this is untrue. 
---
* **Regarding Raid Tank**:
---
 Warriors, druids, paladins, shamans can tank. Hell, even Warlocks, Rogues can tank if you go the extra mile to make it work.
---
* **Regarding Raid Dps**:
---
All class specs do enough dps to meet the "required dps" to kill a boss. It would LITERALLY take a mage auto-attaking and afk'ing every 4 seconds to be below the necessary dps. (trust me, I've tested what's the most dps every spec can do for +8years). People throw around the word "meme spec" I don't even know what it means anymore... People associate perfectly good dps spec with the word meme, not realising that these specs are not only fun to play but do decent dps. Check out the [Off-Meta discord](https://discord.gg/3JXSamG), people in there are revolutionising what classes can do.
---
Funnily enough, meme specs shine in really good guilds because people in the guild know the exact dps that can be done from them. 
---
It's in the less experienced guilds that people panic since they see something new and are scared. 
---
On the topic of going out of mana on a prot paladin. This is an outdated notion. Going OOM is no longer an issue in Classic/Vanilla (except in progression) if you are willing to put in the effort to resolve it.
---
You need to have offtanks building threat/eating the flame breath.  High enough to be relevant, but low enough not to take fireballs in p2.  My guild used the OT strat this week and 1-shot.  OT actually had agro when she landed too.
---
We just transferred from skullflame. Must better server. More active players and no layers so it feels must more populated.
---
Yeah it's how reddit is, I'm used to it especially before Classic came out people would argue that Hemo is better for Daggers, etc. Lots of bad advice.
---
You are rationalizing your unacceptable behaviour.
---
I'm just one person actually, sorry I didnt take the time to read each and every individual comment on your post before giving my input on mobile. jerk.
---
pretty sure paladins, shamans and druids are lawful, as they have to uphold/honor nature/elements/the light
---
Canadian and I call it DM, always have, always will.
---
[Priest](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxRhsV0oZcxtcc0VZx). I prefer the 5/5 Spirit Tap over 5/5 Spiritual Healing because the Spiritual Healing only applies to the base healing of the spell, basically providing +18-23 for Flash Heal rank 1 or +28-35 for Heal rank 1. I just snipe a KB with Mind Blast or Smite.
---
\&gt;  But its not as good as raid gear thats already out. 
---
Wrong, many items are better than MC loot. Also MC dropps \~20-25 items per run on clear for 40 people, while Dire Maul is farmable as long as you want
---
no as a priest you run to the middle of the raid, shield yourself, blow everyone the fuck up, and then cast levitate so you land safely amidst the destruction.
---
Yeah GL tanking anything but BRD with a two hander at 60.
---
What hinders you from having one? Healers can have that too imo.
---
1x greater arcane protection potion.
---
Very much doubt he gets into a raid that kills Shazzrah before teleport.
---
And tbh, mana/hp potions will make it much smoother.
---
And priority decurse tanks/melee at Gehennas. Other than that just follow the raid leader.

# PVE Server, Peasant

Lots of great macros posted already by other commenters, but there is currently a bug with shifting to different forms: when you shift from one form to another, Leader of the Pack and Predatory Strikes (hidden buff) do not get reapplied. The best workaround untill this gets fixed is adding the following 2 lines to the beginning of the macro:
---
    /cancelaura Predatory Strikes
---
/cancelaura Leader of the Pack
---
Here's an example with a basic cat powershifting macro:
---
/cancelaura Predatory Strikes
---
/cencalaura Leader of the Pack
---
/cancelform
---
/cast cat form
---
This workaround isn't perfect, because spamming it too fast removes the buffs anyway, but it's the best we've got untill this bug is fixed. You can read more about druid bugs [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/the-big-druid-bug-list/299227)
---
If you're in Westfall and you think the level 19 rogue is asking you to run Dire Maul you're an idiot, not confused.
---
This stuff doesn't fly in the US either.
---
don't focus only on quests. It's a good idea, time to time, to farm some mobs for xp and money
---
The difference is maybe 2 pulls.
---
Enhance shammy should be pure evil
---
Correct. Often guilds will sell the leaf or eye when the others already have it.
---

---
&gt; We're so primed to expect shitty behaviour that ambiguous statements are easily misunderstood as either passive aggressive or outright hostile.
---
Rofl. I’m guilty of this too. I don’t rage as much as I did back in Vanilla. Instead of openly yelling at the offending party in CAPSLOCK, I now resort to saying things like 
---
“oh , the warlock SS’d himself instead of the healer? I mean. That’s cool. At least he can rez all of us later if we wipe.”
---
Or 
---
“I swear to God if you don’t put your pet on a leash, I’m going to put him in a sack.” 
---
It’s a lot more humor based (of course placing animals in sacks is not humorous, it was just an example I actually used to stop a hunter from putting his pet on aggressive), but it gets the point across. I mean, sometimes it does, that lock probably continues to SS himself to this day, so if you’re expecting 100% of the population to have two IQ points to rub together, you’re in store for a rude awakening.
---
Grinding can be more efficient than questing if you are terrible at questing and don't have a planned out route or it gets ruined by pvp crowding etc.  
---
I tend to grind which generates ALOT more gold but it is most certainly slower than a great questing route with some grind.
---
No kids, no partner and no job goes a long way. Not saying the OP didn't have these, just staying it helpt a lot not having them.

What is the alternative to Warden Staff in Dire Maul?

Combat daggers, if you know what you re doing is just as good if not better than combat swords for pve.
---
I farmed 15 ooze covered rich thorium couple days ago, didnt get one. U got mine too. Mail them to me
---
Sometimes I wish people would try playing the game instead of following instructions on the easiest way to win the game.
---
Does Demo Shout for Warriors still generate enough threat to keep aggro on packs in lvl 60 instances like UBRS, LBRS and Scholo?

Gz on the staff.

---
Imagine thinking this is a genuine post.
---
Yeah I don’t understand why people make the game look shitty
---
no, it's not, because no one can equip the gold, while tanks can equip the shield and gain value from it. they just got lucky it was that item that dropped, but it's still an item, a quantifiable upgrade, and there's no realistic reason why regular rules wouldn't apply to it, other than the greed and self-entitlement of people like you.
---
if a Krol Blade dropped you'd be pretty happy if they allowed you to take it.
---
The reason people complain about this particular spot, is because they drop items for a quest requirement.  
---
You are "stealing" the low levels' quest mobs.  
---
Warlocks have a quest to get a robe here and maybe others I don't know about.
---
And if you've been at it all day long, ofcourse they get tilted.  
---
You can farm fire elementals at many other places, instead you chose the quest area for low levels.
---
I also found out about Spy through a reddit post. Love that addon. Especially the kill on sight feature. I would add people who ganked me ruthlessly (like corpsecamping or just ganking everyone in sight) and tell myself that at level 60 I would get them back.
---
Now I'm 60 and I've been seeing a few of them pop up here and there... and they're like, level 53. Revenge tastes gooood.

I "had" to level and play a raid heal druid first, as it always was my favorite class back then, but I will certainly twink a scorch mage, mage was my first character on release and a majority of it was scorch mage.

I got the wetlands 2H, but that quest chain can be pretty hard and take some time. But, you get a better 2H (Archeus) from Duskwood from a much "easier" q chain. (Just get a group to kill one elite, Duskwood should have plenty of people who can help)

what is this shit? Pocket Healer? are u playing without a keyboard????

Sub-optimals not always a big deal. But if you're a warlock and you're running voidwalker in a dungeon with me, I'm only gonna ask you once to switch summons before I boot you. I need to be hit damn it.

With orcs, ogres, dark iron dwarves and humans all working side by side, Stockades truly are an example to us all.
---
This is completely incorrect man, druids should be neutral they are all about balance
---
&gt; You're saying that the full list of nearby enemy players is somehow linked to the combat log? 
---
Yes. Because it only registers them when they do something that shows up in the combat log. It's not a full list.

How tf do you “ban” an addon?

I'm using Shadowed Unit Frames for that.
---
White hits can still miss with 6% hitchance on your Gear.
---
100%-24.8%-6%-0%-0%-40%+6%
---
Thats the formula for your whitehits with 305 Weaponskill.
---
So you'll miss a bit over 24% of your OH swings, if you Queue your Heroic Strike you will miss 0% with your Offhand.
---
True! Personally I’m currently leveling enchant and I whisper people without enchant to give them a +5 strength or agi for free.
---
8 times out of 10 people tips me... and half of the time clearly generously!
---
It takes a bit of time to inspect and whisp but I level up and make a bit of money :)

Miks scrolling battle text classic does this. You can also get an addon like weak auras or tellmewhen and define an alert yourself.

&gt;are you paying for my stoneshields

Keyori really said fuck it and left that name behind, good for him.
---
Players used too much avoidance and not nearly enough offensive stats back then.
---
What, are you serious? So tanking isn't enough to show that you are going to need tank gear? You also have to say that before each boss?
---
? Not what I’m talking about lol

I bought BfA when I hit 55 2 weeks ago because I am waiting for my friends to catch up so we can do BRD together.

I am still waiting /:

This. People are in for a real surprise if they don't think tanks are gonna need on melee dps items. Dps warrs will also roll need on tanking items for their tank set. There are no prios on dungeon gear.
---
Each to their own, but as long as u are playing with pugs u should expect people to act from an egocentric view and therefore it is for your best intrest to do aswell. U wouldnt know he would equip it or not, but if u find enjoyment in helping people u do not have a relation to then be my guest. Play the game ur way
---
That arc prot potion is definitely unnecessary.
---
Ya imo it puts more fun in the game, I for one love wpvp so maybe it’s just me..
---
I feel like with all the low HP targets running around with no PvP trinket at the moment, cold blood has got to be the better choice. Might give it a try once BGs are in the game.
---
i just carried on the grind man, went through zf a few times, cleared tanaris of trash, found an epic twink BiS, but its worth nothing right now. Got to 90g yesterday after a kind donation of 6g. dinged 46 a couple of mins later.
---
So this is why the olden day players call deadmines "VC", named after the boss vanqueef instead of the instance.
---
nothing to see here just two naked dudes fishing and sharing their rods  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Love it. You’ve made me want to revisit it so much!!!
---
Rules? It has rules now?
---
BRD  is more complicated than MC, don't stress at all about it.
---
As a warlock I don’t miss summoning stones, free tips for me. I usually only have a problem trying to find dungeon groups at 4-8 am.
---
Remember that few people get loot in raids. Even if you rushed to 60 and instantly started raiding, there's a very slim chance you'll have your P1 raid BIS finished yet. I'd say almost everyone needs at least one item from DM.
---
Why is Arcane intellect and ice armor the two largest icons and at the top row?
---
Ah okay and as with wingclip you get the highest attack speed you get the highest chance to apply the debuff for your raid. Intresting thanks
---
No? Why would i?
---
1. Dont use thunder Clap. You will look like noob. Its not worth it even when fighting 4 mobs.
---
2. Pre raid BiS &lt;&gt; good gear for dungeon tanking. Preraid BiS focus is on tanking 1 mob not group of enemies. Same goes for talents.
---
You can download dominos and it has the ability to make any hotkey to any action button you want. I have my pet attack/follow on mouse wheel up and down.
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Profession linking, really.
---
Idt Blackcrow is that great for hunters compared to other pieces out there. Its so invaluable to wars because of the hit. That is it
---
Healing spec makes dungeons a breeze after a few key upgrades. Especially when a lot of tanks might be somewhat undergeared themselves, it’ll make the whole process easier for everyone. 
---
Now with Dire Maul out, lasher farming in east also means you still have a viable method of farming gold at a decent rate as healing spec.

21yr/o lv 30s frost mage looking for an active guild with a discord requirement with members active in it (at least the core). Want an immature 18+ guild, I'm toxic as fuck but in good fun, looking for others the same way
---
I wish you luck in your pre-bis grind. You're gonna spend a looooot of time doing dungs with this mentality.
---
Ah I see.
---
Bad warlocks just spam hellfire in dungeons, I wouldn’t of even shielded him.
---
It was like explaining S8
---
I think some people would gate others using the achivments anyway. As in : "hur dur... you didnt kill all other classes i bet u sux balz cuz of dat... no inv \*ignore\*".  
---
A good way to prevent this behaviour would be to just disable the preview of some1s achivments or the ability to link an achiv.  
---
My inner completionist suffers from lact of achivments to reach :(. Also when i played on WotLK private server before classic came out i remember there was a addon that could fake the completion of achivment
---
well actually, 4% more dps is exactly 36.6 dps on the weapon, coming from 35.2
---
If I'm not mistaken, if you had a weapon that did 36.6 without any proc, it would also increase your overall by 4% since it would also scale with AP, and affect your yellow hits. Maybe the only advantage is the extra rage generation, in that case, unless I'm missing something
---
Good, keep that feeling alive for a while! =)
---
Alright.
---
i feel like rogue should be "Chaotic" and then whatever kinda person you are...Do you just blind a horde so your ally can run away, or do you camp lowbies contantly ganking 24/7?
---
I talk to EVERYONE I run into you, if you run on nostalgia you’re bound to be burnt out. It’s the same reason why I quit OSRS I was running on pure nostalgia besides me getting the quest cape why else would I play the game. But I see your point and wish you the best
---
Well not rules but you better know what you get yourself into when entering STV
---
Wrath was considered “best” because of how many players it had. But I can understand if you didn’t like the revamped systems. They were great at the time but became what everyone hates now.
---
But story wise it pulled me in marking me feel like I was actually in a war that got added to every patch, fighting a villain who had presence and motivation. 
---
Also lore, so much lore titans,old gods, dragons character development for major characters 
---
Bc had non of it. It was here’s a lore character that’s important. Their dead now.
---
Low-key scared to run Stockades again after seeing this artwork.
---
Damn man. Respect
---
Can you send me the picture of the character name haha
---
I sap them and just keep running. It's funny but overall harmless.
---
I would totaly add the feature that lets you link your proffesion. So much easier selling enchants and other stuff from LW/BS
---
You're right, missed the topic change.
---
Think people really explained it all - I have one thing to add; install Decursive. This addon just creates 40 (if you are 40 ppl total in raid) small boxes, then all you have to do it configure the addon so  you just have to click on the boxes that gets a color (meaning they are cursed) to remove the curse.
---
250g on mine for reference.
---
And you cant use of innervate because thats reserved for healers
---
Yeah.
---
Rule 1: Every time I die, I have to kill two allies before I log off.
---
It’s pretty much the only rule
---
Haha! I know the feeling! I play on Razorgore Alliance. I went to skin a few Devilsaurs yesterday while waiting for Raid to fill up and a hunter ganked me when fighting a Devilsaur. I ran back and killed him just as he was about to skin. Felt incredible and the best kind of payback! He was named Shietz or something like that if you've ever seen him. :D
---
No they are wrong. Those packs it's pretty impossible to hold all the non elites just do the best you can to keep them off the healer. If you have no druid you could ask the lock to put fire shield on you thorns/ fire shield / ret aura(which you saddly dont have) really help ok aoe threat and normally end up as around 10% of your damage while tanking in pre raid gear. 
---
I would cut out thunderclap from your rotation though it's not really worth casting ever unless you actually need the attack speed slow as mitigation. Set skull and x to easy to use bindings get used to marking them every pull. If you can charge in which you often cant in strat / scholo pop rage if it's up demo shout and battle shout for initial threat shield block revenge the skull and then start putting one sunder on the other elites starting with x. You will lose at least one mob maybe even skull and you just have to be quick on the taunt to get it back. If you have more single target damage in your party you might need to do a revenge sunder on the main target to hold it. Shield slam is your best threat move yes but it costs way to much rage for a pull with multiple elites so until you figure out your rotation and rage better I would not use it on the pull against multiple elite packs. In strat / scholo you are also just going to be running around a lot pmdoing your best to grab stuff you lost it's just the way it is.
---
When I was earlier in 60 around the same amount of pre raid bis as you and was getting pretty confident in my tanking I had a scholo run that went terrible aggro everywhere and then a strat with a bunch of geared dps that also went horrible and made me feel like a shitty tank. It made me figure out my rotation much better though and also made me realise I have to take charge of the group more and if I need to tell them not to do multi / aoe or other shit for the first 5 secs or so of the pull to keep things smooth. If they dont like that they are bad / impatient and you should just say ok your just going to leave the group. You'll always find more groups your a tank they need to play at the pace you set not their own. As you get more gear and get more comfortable you will be able to pull through then much faster and let people attack quicker though scholo always stays pretty damn awful to do.
---
Wrote this on my phone and didn't edit hope it helps also go impale prot asap for threat you dont need to be deep prot ever really even for your first mc
---
Wrong
---
I feel like with the right trinkets and talents its crazy good for sword rogues right? I hope so, im getting this one tonight if i can actually find a group for mara lol
---
Healing will definitely be easier as holy, solo mob grinding and questing will suck ass, but atleast you can solo farm some gold. Personally I'd go heal spec and spam dungeons for fast ez xp, and respec at 60 for shadow again, but that's just me
---
And you’re watching YTV
---
He has been saying nothing has been good enough to switch it out
---
You are the perfect person to answer me my question. I level as fury and got the trash blade quest 2 days ago. I´m working on getting it. I have a really good main hand weapon from ZF for my level. When I wear trash blade in my offhand does that make sense? Or do I have to have it in my main hand to work properly?
---
I just don´t have a really good offhand weapon for the trash blade and I would like to keep my main hand from ZF. 
---
If the trash blade proccs what does "swing" mean? 
---
Like it proccs, my main hand swings and I get 2 hits from my main hand (while trash blade is in the off hand). 
---
Or is a swing both weapons at the same time? (so hitting with main and offhand = 1 swing).
---
No? For you tanking is a goal, a dream, an abstract imagination of what you might be later down the road.
---
You are specced arms, it doesn't matter why, you are a dps
---
Ye, even with innervate, 2 min decent dps
---
The money I save by getting the warlock mount could be spent on something much important than a GCD.
---
... Why are you tanking with other warriors in the party?
---
Try this bullshit on a balanced server. Easy to dominate when it’s 80-20 in your favor.

---
Right here, once you hit a level past the max level it means all mobs are grey and not worth EXP anymore.
---
6% as human with swords is all you need for both DW and 2H. Compared to 1.12 severs hitchance above the yellow and mainhand cap isn't as valuable anymore, especially since the discovery of heroic strike canceling.
---
Buff Watch or create a weakaura.
---
You mean you started a new relationship without confirming the other person is into WoW?
---
So arms tanks isn't a thing? It's the only thing while leveling basically lol. Nobody in their right mind would level with prot.
---
Everything is "viable" in the current tier, but in the long run no, you don't want an enh in pve. It buffs melee parties a bit more than a healing shaman would, but not significantly enough to warrant bringing it over a warrior/rogue.
---
In pvp it looks flashy when you get that windfury proc, but a good opponent won't let you get in range. Ele is a lot better.
---
and you don't even need to be 60 to "pug" DM. It's some sort of "gear catch-up" mechanic for those still not 60 but close enough, who haven't farmed BRD or UBRS yet
---
Thank you
---
I do a lot of RTV mining in EPL and the crystals likely are only few % drop. You can have days with no crystals but then more than one from one node. DM will bring thorium down and likely crystals as well. It may also lower amount sold due to people getting crystals them selves or within a guild.

Low tier comment, take my downvote

Finns cant use the slang word for a hockey puck/a snus container, which is kike (from kiekko). I didnt even know it was a derogatary word until I googled it after blizzard censored it from my whispers to a friend.

You dont do that boss.

i wouldnt even want my real life friends in the game, this is my own secret world lol

It's doubles his dps

You get downvoted now, but you get the honor from them soon :) Let's see their opinions on this after a week of world PVP :)

They legit don't understand the reasons, only because "dreadstead looks cool" :D

Weakauras is great but can be difficult to understand and properly configure in the beginning. An easier addon (but with less features) is called [TellMeWhen](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tellmewhen).
---
And this is why I play without sound.
---
Farm lashers, MC satyrs to clear more than a mage can (demons). Or make gold elswere.
---
You can go on trans-instance boats as a ghost?
---
That’s Hamhock, one of the bosses in Classic Stockade.
---
RP server boi
---
As explained by last comment, as long as every1 greeds ppl should all greed. If some1 needs i will always need aswell as i wont willingly just give the item to some1 that needed. Thats why u want to be the last to roll as its no leap of faith
---
Did they initially have sounds? I can't remember.
---
I've been doing it in dungeons fine - not sure if it's just open world/changed range in which you gain XP.
---
Your guild is based around poaching members and absorbing other guilds. Please don't act like this is some gracious opportunity provided by your GM for the players.
---
I crafted it yesterday! Nice feeling
---
Yes, and they didn't have spy either.
---
U need to close the gate to get to genera and golem lord (and guzzler)
---
Likely until Cenarion Circle launches those shards will be low. After that supply will fall and prices will rise.
---
Tirion's questline (border between wpl/epl) has some good rewards and good story in general. Duke hydraxis quests need to be completed in order to get quintessence to douse runes in MC, every raid needs 7 of those if you don't want to waste tons of time going back and forth.
---
you can get phantom blade at lvl 44. Trash Blade? not so early.
---
Guess he was a dragon cultist
---
After people rolled greed you don't roll need unless you ate going to equip right then and there , no matter how many times you said "all need" after the fact.
---
I don’t think they may of had sounds from the animation maybe
---
What time EST does DM get released?
---
That’s Bazil Thredd, he was VanCleef’s right hand man before he got captured. VanCleef dies in the Deadmines.
---
Don't forget mining. Loads of money to be had while traveling
---
It's sad that youtube monetizes him poorly
---
I don't mind natural pvp. But what's going to unfold in phase two is raids camping flight paths, instances entrances, and leveling zones. You don't wanna be corpse camped by a raid? Well better get used to the idea because that's what most of the open world pvp will become.
---
I was thinking that I should be able to cast shadowburn and drain soul  on the same target and rip one persons soul in half and put it into two shards.
---
It's part of WeakAuras setup. The AI icon only appears when I don't have that buff active, and Ice/Frost Armor icon appears if I have no active armor buff(ice/frost/mage) on. Stuff below that tracks the CD of certain spells.
---
Weapon DPS is added to base DPS, not multiplied by it. If my AP gave me an unarmed DPS of 1000, adding a 40 DPS weapon to it only brings that to 1040.
---
wasn't the case on lightshope / northdale.
---
Use your main to buy decent gear for it.  Then have fun playing.  With alts, the less like work leveling feels, the better.
---
And its great and i mean really great to have so much rage all the time.
---
I don't even have it on my action bars.
---
And people seem to forget that Thunder*crap* only hits 4 targets. While OP clearly states that he's talking about 8 to 10 mobs groups. Imagine it hits the 4 non elites ones. WoW, much values.
---
Look up any fury warrior dps spreadsheet, they all will tell you the same thing (that Edgemaster’s is inferior to a lot of easily obtainable alternatives if you’re a human).
---
Also your attacks can’t be dodged/blocked/parried when you’re standing behind a mob anyway.
---
why did I get to level 48, and then decide to roll 2 alts to 30
---
If the tank needed it as an upgrade , yes you are the asshole.
---
Reddit blacklist is a thing?
---
Absolutely brutal! More!
---
Wait can you not loot or mine/herb while shapeshifter?
---
All but one 😀
---
My Brother has the little panda from the 2004 collectors Edition of WOW. It's fucking funny seeing a little Panda running after your gryphon superfast!
---
As a lifelong Horde player, this makes me wanna roll an Ally alt so I can finally run this dungeon.
---
But onto my previous point, eve players are monitoring players in local, chat messages to a number of chat channels (some use a software the reads the chat logs and puts up a warning if a system nearby is reported), while also playing another game, 
---
even if they somehow make spy not work, people will just use an external software that plugs into the advanced combat log to provide this same information, it won't have the same functionality though
---
just went there last night to try to farm, 5 or 6 horde 60s in t1 camping the spot ruthlessly slaying every alliance and furbolg around. no can do
---
its a great build and can fill all 3 roles in dungeons, only downside is bag space
---
DW is stronger on single target, given equally good weapons. 2H shines on the multiple cleave fights in MC (4-6 depending on your guild's strat).
---
If you're running with sub 40 dps onehanders and manage to get a BRE or Spinal Reaper, go 2H Fury. In one of our MC runs (which had most dps in the 90+ percentile, many 99s) a BRE Fury Warrior was on par with Dal'rends Furys on single target and outperforming them on cleave.
---
I am very critical of the automated lfg tool, but the addon has one function that is great. I pops up a notification if a keyword has been mentioned in chat, which is the reason I use it. I haven't used it to create a group, but it helps not missing that important announcement in a very busy chat window.
---
&gt;Mingu
---
Oh Ok. Well i only played Horde and my main was undead Priest so maybe that is why i do not have that experience.
---
For my that, as you called, scumbags are gnomes, exactly like on clip above.
---
blizz banned for layering exploits in dungeons because it is clear that it was not intended that way... 
---
not saying anything else then this **can** get you banned if you exploit it.
---
if you just try it out and not kill bosses / get to alch labor faster / etc. sure its not exploited and you will not get banned
---
You mean, up until now, my fellow addict :)
---
Missed guild run, my hunter head and sinew dropped. Joined a PUG the day after, saw and won the same 2 drops
---
Amazing work.
---
Engineering is the only profession that boosts your character (with a few exceptions). You absolutely want it for pvp.
---
Tailoring isn't great, especially for warlocks as their epic robe is underwhelming compared to priest/mage version. In phase 4 you will need it for bloodvine set, though.
---
Herbalism is good for money making, especially with dire maul out, though with everyone and their dog farming it the prices might drop too much. Alchemists can make decent money with fire protection pots.
---
API wise maybe, but you can set ElvUI to react differently to different size raids as usual.
---
I personally think every Warlock should do the quest. Not only because you get badass demon horse, but because its second best quest chain in the game. 
---
Opening AQ gates is the best one.
---
I really enjoy mindlessly farming gold and wanted to know which method is generally the most consistent and least gear required.
---
Hunter Maraudon farm.
---
Mage various aoe farms.
---
Or potentially prot paladin, undead farm in plaguelands or running lower level instances and farming them. I’ve not seen much about this but heard you can make some decent gold from undead farms and spamming things like stockades.
---
Absolute legend, thank you.
---
You suck stop looking for excuses... trouble making good with a warlock rofl
---
It's the general attitude of most players that you call ridiculous. I don't see fury warriors taking shields of tanks and I don't see rogues and warriors needing ranged weapons ahead of hunters. Generally, people pass items for each other. 
---
Your attitude is definitely an outlier, and if you bring this philosophy to dungeons you are likely to piss off a lot of people and end up on a lot of ignore lists.
---
You need mana and CC to do it. Arcane explosion is mana expensive and you will quickly get killed by melee anyway. It works with slows, with a priest/mage shield etc but still not the go to AoE tool. Plus I think you put to much emphasis on AoE farming - it's handy but it's unlikely to be faster than questing (and doing some quests AoE style).
---
So basically your wife is an Orc, Troll etc?
---
Ahh so I’ve confirmed he finds it the best for tanking but he also has The Rockpounder
---
In my eyes the warrior who denies the group the chance to gain gold is greedy. I would never do it myself, I consider that rude. This of course only applies to boe epics, bops are ofc need and greed based on if you can use the item and so on. Needing on few silver items is greedy and it can't be compared to an item worth hundreds of gold.
---
Anyway, no point in continuing this silly debate. You have your opinions and I have mine. Have a nice day.
---
Dps warriors need draconian deflector and a tank set for raiding and most tanks are actually dps warriors in disguise. It's like none of you have any idea.
---
You guys don't have to delete your extra mage water when they keep giving you stacks? Huh. Weird.
---
didn't know you could mount inside buildings..;)
---
I need a video or pictures
---
Looks wise it doesn't really matter, as long as it's female. The PvE advantage for humans is, in my opinion, insurmountable though.
---
Which doesn't top any charts... What raid boss is down in 30s?
---
do u have a picture?
---
Do it
---
NE and their mount are aesthetically pleasing to me
---
All of them, but I’m in a decent guild now so I don’t mind
---
I’ve never been able to understand this exploiter’s approach to dungeons, why even bother doing a boss in a video game if you avoid its main mechanic? Boring af
---
Good luck having the OT generate more threat than the mages and warlocks in P2.
---
Only time I've managed to keep equal/above is by ordering no one to kill the whelps so I can use them as Rage batteries.
---
Lasher farm, dog farm.
---
&gt; arrogant turd
---
&gt; crazy narcissist
---
Yeah I'm the one who started insulting people rofl.
---
Heh, you just *need* me to be upset don’t you?
---
I support the PvP rules as they stand because without them the really fun and amazing world PvP moments that I love can’t happen. But they also open the door for a bunch of morons to get their rocks off ruining others days while screaming “LOL PVP” or whatever. It’s sad and pathetic, but no I’m not upset. I just find everyone who does that and thinks it a good time to be seriously pathetic, because it is.
---
If you get off on stopping other people playing a game, if that’s what does it for you? That’s sad man. It really is. Deflect all you like but it doesn’t change anything.
---
You’re the biggest asshole. Fuck you. I hope your boe epic drops and some hunter ninja’s it. You’re lower than trash. Hope i never meet people like you in this game
---
This is the warcraft I know and love, none of this fluffy rat kawaii nonsense, just beautifully raw and pure warcraft.
---
Then we fundamentally disagree. Dungs are spammable so prios are not needed.
---
Life long Hordie so I have never been to this place.
---
Describe it in one word!
---
How can a priest solo farm this? I haven't done it before. Lvl 57 btw.
---
Being in the same shit together can really unite one another
---
Retail
---
Its like 1g ?
---
Is that real thing?
---
Anyone got the numbers on Ashbringer EU?
---
It’s the god damn dire condors man, they’re always surrounded by the whelps, can’t do the tango with them without the whelps tryna cop a feel. Spent 2 hours studying the mob paths just for 5 god damn glorified chicken legs.
---
How come dire maul is so good? I know you say because it’s an instance but that also applies to how hunters and prot Paladins I mentioned make gold.
---
I just ignore the non-elites and keep aggro on the elites. The non-elites die in a few seconds while rooted/slowed usually.
---
You're killing the wrong boss lol
---
Do you even read his comment? He talked about PvP
---
Attack speed faster than 3.0 is a HUGE deal breaker as windfury cd is 3 seconds.
---
Current retail wow is what you’re looking for bud.
---
So there's no actual tanks? Dang that makes loot rules pretty easy then.
---
I had a warrior cuss me out for rolling need on the maraudon ring from princess, telling me that it's a "warrior bis and is useless for shaman's".
---
I mean...elemental/resto, yeah. I'm enhancement.
---
Just use the dodge CD and then you have 15 seconds to think about what to do next since nothing will hit you
---
What runs are you planning on? Herbalism is great for almost any kind of runs, while mining and enchanting are good for jump runs. Since those require 2 players, you should split the professions between you.
---
“Slut?”
---
But MS&gt;OS in lfg and see how fast you fill the group.
---
It's like a black cloud of smoke by his face. When you see that, you have like 3-4s to start running to get out before the doors close.
---
Depends on time needed and your play style, capabilities to farm, realm economy = only you can answer.
---
I've just looted Nightblade (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1982/nightblade) and I see it going around 25-30 gold in my server. Since Dire Maul is just coming and people will have more gold, I'm thinking of keeping it and selling it later for a higher amount. Do you think this is a good idea?
---
I played alot of private servers. Some private servers have the same mind set as Blizzard:
---
*"This game is good... Let me make it even better!"*
---
And they fk it up by adding shit no one asked for. And the server dies.
---
Believe me it doesn't work.
---
i kinda dig the chat on top left and bars under it
---
Generating massive threat on a dozen mobs in just 2-3 global cooldowns is a thing! ... in retail/BFA.
---
In classic, it's not. If they want to AOE instances, that's fine. Then they need to stop wasting a group spot on a tank, and get themselves a 3rd mage instead.
---
If they want to bring a tank and make use of a tank, they need to do their part in managing threat.
---
Agreed. I knock out the Deadmines quest, do the lunch delivery and the toolbox/necklace and then get out. Jump between Westfall and Loch until 20ish, then jump between Wetlands and Darkshire.  Worth doing the zone once- but that's enough for me.
---
This is the awkward part. The original SUF author has not been active for years. The current maintainer only has control of SUF and not HealComm. Unfortunately, HealComm is marked as All Rights Reserved, so you can't legally just take it over. SUF classic is still considered beta, I am unaware of the maintainer's plans concerning heal communication.
---
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle. Stab you in the knees knees they want to make you bleed, bleed.
---
calling it like I see it. you led off with the wonky behavior, saying the only way I could enjoy something is if I was a 'toxic asshole', and called me delusional, before I ever said anything like that. Matter of fact telling someone the things you told me, and believing them on top of it, are traits that suggest you are an arrogant turd, or a crazy narcissist. Keep doubling down, youre making yourself look great.
---
Now do it on a PVP realm!
---
Oh noooo, I believed a cute little story on reddit and then it turned out to was a lie. WHAT AM I TO DO^O^O^O^O^O^O
---
This has an 'Orcs Must Die!' game art style to it, I love it! 
---
Also, I would love a WoW game with the same idea. It would be so fun
---
ok satan
---
uh... LFG. i'd rather just see a list of groups and what they need rather then scrolling through people spamming.
---
not dungeon finder or anything, but just a clean list of groups. honestly, it doesn't really change anything from what we do currently anyway.
---
unrelated, but, i want barber shop... and transmog, but, i doubt transmog will ever come out.
---
I've been raidlogging for the last 2 weeks.
---
Now when DM is released i'm gonna farm 2 items and continue to raid log after that.
---
Game without pvp is boring af
---
probably a bug/ oversight - the sound does exist in the game files, the mount will produce it during the idle animation, but not when you press space manually
---
It doesn't, unless you can get 315 (which would be a huge waste). You'd have fractional miss chance, but since items and talents only give whole percentages you'd still need 6%.
---
As a warrior: they won’t be able to do, so no changes if DM available or not.
---
It's really not. I recently finished my prebis grind and it's normal for tanks to need on phys gear (why else would they tank) and dps warrs to need on tank gear.
---
So tell me, what else does it say about your personality if you enjoy being part of either side of the meat grinder?
---
Deadmau5?
---
Is this a surprise to you????
---
It's mostly a PVP set.
---
My friends lasted to day 2.....
---
Don't farm for your mount.  Just keep leveling and you will get the gold very quickly.  The amount of gold you earn leveling goes up very quickly around 40, so by 42-43 you will easily have enough to buy the mount.
---
Shes muh queen
---
DM is out in a few days, its mage heaven
---
what the fuuck
---
none of them, but I only had 3 to begin with. 2 are with me on the same faction/ realm, and the 3rd is horde scum, so not my friend anymore :P
---
Yes that should be enough.
---
default target cast baaaaar pllz
---
One thing I would say about this - looking at the attempts, the mages and warlocks are barely to be seen on threat.
---
Every raid I've been in, the mages will be 100% higher on threat than the offtank by the time she lands.. Do you ask them to chill out? or are they just not very good?
---
Interesting to see that the OT was peppered with fireballs and didn't get the threat drop though.
---
did you read it all? I relinquished the item. You're abrasive.
---
For rogue mace spec, is the 5% proc limited to a certain number of procs per minute?
---
Also is that 5% per weapon? i.e. when dual wielding, it's 5% per weapon (if they are maces ofc)
---
All of those are after Dire Maul was released, did you find any before March 2005?  For me it was always DM in classic, I think some servers changed it to VC only after Dire Maul was released.  There would be no reason to call it VC before that date.
---
Not until phase 5 iirc.
---
Rogue on lawful evil, warlock on neutral evil and spriests on chaotic evil due to madness.
---
Okay, that makes a lot more sense, and it's a good point to boot. He's absolutely right.
---
Funny enough, when I bought my Lord Alexander's Battle Axe, it was to replace my Rockpounder. So yeah, if you want to get him a more practical gift, it's probably the best choice.
---
Should be 1.12 right? So removed I guess?
---
I'm going to start Classic today with my friend. Going with a Holy/Disc Priest. Which professions should I choose?
---
Haha I recognized several names here from my server.
---
&gt; calling people losers because they killed you in an online game
---
Why are you oversimplifying the arguments? People aren't simply complaining about *being killed in an online game* and you trying to make it seem so, makes you look like a fool in turn. 
---
But I guess the proper description didn't suit your edgy narrative, eh?
---
Why not?
---
Stabacadabra...
---
It's strange to call DM a catchup mechanic, when it was released long before the first Ragnaros first kill and just 3 weeks after EU release.
---

---
Ultra-wide pally pal! I normally have buffwatch minimized and raid frames moved over a bit more to the right when buffwatch is minimized. I need to shrink them some more too but I've been doing it gradually.
---
Check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1tkrr/all_dungeons_by_minmax_mob_level_for_best_exp/) for level recommendations
---
Yea pretty much. Also its Mage only.
---
Started on one server with a small group of friends and acquaintances. Several stopped weeks ago (including my main friend of the group), and the rest go days between each login.
---
So I rerolled on a server with another friend and a group of people I've met like once at most. They're logged on more than me. It's great.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13128/high-bergg-helm , just got this item yesterday. Anyone  has any idea for how much I can sell this for ?
---
While I appreciate your stance, I disagree completely. If its an upgrade for someone then they can buy it. BOE is useful for everyone, even if that's just as a source of income.
---
I'm not arguing about the game or pvp in general. I made a case about one specific manifestation of toxic behavior in the game. Do you not think that camping flight paths is toxic behavior? Do you not think that players participating in this behavior are therefore equally toxic or at the very least opportunistic at the detriment of the majority of the player base? You're trying to justify antisocial behavior by derailing the conversation.
---
Could it be the orcs that call for help? Apparently many people don't know you need to pull them a bit away for their call to not pull anything!
---
Thank you, very helpful.
---
Also tested the idea a bit now when I got home. Sadly I have a lot of +shadow damage only but with +250 fire damage I needed 3 casts of Rain of Fire to kill lvl 51 mobs, that is 24 seconds of uninterrupted casting that your voidwalker shield would need to hold against 10 mobs.
---
Tanking doesn't give you the exclusive rights to tank items.
---
False
---
Distinctly remembering private servers
---
I’m just enjoying all the extra love I get as a bear tank when healers realise a streamer sheep warrior isn’t going to be causing them a headache for the next 45 mins, so keep it up guys!
---
i dont see the connection youre making. bears are objectively the worst aoe (and by aoe, i mean more than 3 targets) tanks. you dont even need thunderfury as a warrior to do thicc aoe threat. just slap on an engineering shield, drink an oil of immolation, and youre cruising. warriors are THE aoe tanks, but bosses are single-target fights, not aoe fiestas
---
besides, id rather be using hurricane while the warriors do aoe pulls with the engineering shield. hurricane is ridiculously strong!
---
bears crush single target threat meters, which means the dps can have a total field day. thats why ive been asked to main tank mc every week so far :p
---
If I had to guess, I doubt you'll get much more than 5g.
---
 This will greatly determine which class ~~many of us~~ less than 1% of the player base will choose as an alt to farm gold for our mains
---
Adjusted the sentence for you
---
That's a... really specific life lesson.
---
Thanks, I'm gonna give that a shot today!
---
ANYTHING while in shapeshift!!!
---
I don't think I would consider the dungeon the earlier version since the term domain is defined by the network technology that allowed people to connect and interact
---
That's why I would need to this so I can give it to the rightful owner.
---
Tell that to the horde and alliance in every expansion since wotlk
---
Agree, unless you’re a keyboard turner. Rank 1 arcane shot on CD and max rank serpent sting.
---
1, read the first sentences in OP's post.
---
2, a warrior can tank up to fairly high levels without being prot. In that case, tank drops are upgrades too. The pally should have communicated and reserved the shield, which is common practice.
---
Plot of the final patch of every expansion
---
You must of never experienced a 40 v 40 wpvp battle.
---
The rightful owner is the person who wins the roll. However, the sentiment is a nice one.
---
&gt; we would graveyard camp raids who fought against us for hours 
---
Wasn't that terribly boring? At least it sounds boring to someone that doesn't find corpse-camping enjoyable just because it's griefing someone else (not that I haven't corpse camped, mind you).
---
Just casual play with my friend. I don't really see myself raiding or doing hardcore pvp. I still plan on getting to max level, but after that I might just make an alt.
---
Arcanite bars were 15G last week. There's currently none available for sale and when I checked last night they were 120G each.
---
How was it a bugged item?
---
Try crankin' that MFing hog
---
I mean, if they need it then yeah lol.
---
Don't be afraid to try out some addons if you're finding a particular area of the game frustrating. I levelled to 60 back in 2006 without them but this time around I installed Questie and a couple of others to make things smoother... no ragrets. Particularly for somewhere like Redridge with a million quests to hunt down the different wildlife and monsters, Questie is awesome for telling you what spawns where. Good luck!
---
You dont.
---
You reset and do the boss again.
---
Have a friend in the group as the group leader. Log out, have them reset the instance while you’re logged out. When you log in you’ll be at the beginning of a fresh instance
---
Yeah mate, I think by now everyone in this thread knows you're talking out of your ass and are just arguing for the sake of it. Fuck off.
---
Short.
---
If that boat was trans-instance then yes.
---
I'm agreeing with OP.  The guy that created the group to the RFk run said he was wanting to get a  certain item.   We agreed and did the run and it dropped and as we had all agreed, we passed so he could get.    In normal circumstances, if you need, you just need.
---
Tier .5 is dungeon 2. Dungeon 1 is tier 0.
---
A warr that levels as prot is a moron or a masochist. All tanks are dps spec leveling, so he had all rights to roll as well.
---
lul proof that this guy hasnt raided
---
Nope, they are 100% the way they were during vanilla. I remember ogres, trolls etc near wyrmthalak.
---
it’s not called STVietnam for no reason. Better hope you don’t get camped for five hours.
---
And is Blizzard OK with people doing this? 
---
Sounds a bit too good to be true
---
I thought the guild name was familiar. Mograine here too. Do the two guilds have any connection?
---
you are stuck in 2004 mate. bears are both. that have better ST and AOE threat during phase 1 than warriors. warriors have dogshit aoe threat. and just as warriors, bears can also spam oil of immolations, use thorns, multi target swipes for more aoe threat, pre hot for even more aoe threat. does way way way more dmg than any prot warr. idk what u are on about
---
Best place to farm thorium as a warri? Need to get that last 10 smithing skillpoints
---
What level should I be if I want to clear whole SM?  Is it better to clear one wing at the time or maybe more? Just the simple dungeon run, not the farming thing.
---
90% of tanks are arms until high level..
---
If you're wanting to Raid, you may have a harder time getting a spot on the team if you're an unconventional build. The safest builds would be: Healing Priest, Warrior Tank, Warrior Fury DPS, Warlock DS/Ruin (or SM/Ruin), Combat Rogue, Marksmen Hunter, Resto Druid, Resto Shaman, Holy Paladin, Frost Mage (early raids) and Fire Mage (later raids).
---
There are some other wanted builds like Shadow Priest (only 1 per raid) or HotW Druid Tank, but these aren't as safe as the previously listed ones; finding spots could be more challenging, and you may get asked to fulfil a different build instead.
---
Single wheel, it would be horrible to try and balance one of those while moving it. :(
---
Against melee:
---
* Wing clip, scatter shot, concussive shot, freezing trap, frost trap, pet stuns, feign death etc. 
---
* It's not easy to be at range constantly, so make sure you use your defensive cooldowns/passives when you're in melee range and will definitely take damage
---
* Use aspect of the monkey when in melee range
---
Against ranged:
---
* Feign death/scatter shot/pet stun against fears or spells that are really going to hurt, as they'll interrupt their casting
---
* Try to keep mages out of your deadzone by CC'ing them and getting back to optimal range
---
* Depending on what minion a lock is using, it's sometimes best to kill the minion first
---
General:
---
* If you see an enemy rogue when questing, place a freezing trap at your feet when starting to kill a mob. If the rogue tries to gank, he'll be frozen - allowing you to get range before re-opening
---
* Always place hunters mark on rogues asap, vanish is the only way they can remove it, and that means burning a vital cooldown before the fight has even started
---
* Use scatter shot/pet stuns to interrupt heals when fighting a caster
---
* If you're low health, scatter shot, then feign death and freezing trap at their feet, so you can bandage yourself mid-fight
---
* Always use Track Humanoids (be warned that druids in feral form do not show up though)
---
* Try to always keep a 'Free Action Potion' in your bags as it prevents all stun and movement impairing effects for 30 seconds (absolutely OP)
---
* Try to keep your melee weapon skill levelled up, as you'll be whacking people quite often in PVP
---
* Juggle between the aspects depending on the fight (cheetah when out of range of melees, hawk for pewpewing, monkey when in melee range)
---
* Don't /wave at lower level enemy players as you're in a nice guy mood. They'll come back with 4 of their buddies and murder you later! If that does happen, ensure you pick them off 1 by 1 when they're least expecting it! This happened to be last night, t'was hilarious :)
---
Give me a shout if you need anything else. I've played a lot of hunter over the years, so I'm happy to try and help where I can.
---
Been using this while leveling a fury warrior with a slow mh, fast offhand.... so much rage.
---
Nah, just tell Blizzard's writers. After the factions have inched towards peace several times, it just feels so hokey when a new expansion drops and they're suddenly at each other's throats again.
---
Anyone else 'commited' to a character? Back in proper vanilla I was altaholic. Now, I get this fomo anxiety when not playing my main.
---
My raptor screams
---
Were you asked to tank or DPS? If you were invited to DPS then you are the asshole.
---
When is dire maul dropping in NA? 3 hours from now?
---
First thing I want to say is that you do what you like. But I feel I need to tell you that the leveling will be easier if you spec shadow and it won't impact your ability to support your friend or heal dungeons until the late 50s.
---
That's just my advice to you.
---
I have seen greys on the AH. And I even sold poisons and vials on the AH myself.
---
if you watched the video i do mention that there isnt on any private servers but how there was in actual vanilla so i dont think it is mate \^\^ it must be so easy to put a comment on something without watching the video :D
---
Ok thanks! Is there any hybrid combat sub builds that would be good though? I really want a good pve pvp build so I don’t have to respec for raids and  PvP
---
lol thank you
---
1 stack = 50 rep. Usually takes about 10000 runecloth (500 stacks).
---
Lots of people want that Darnassus mount.
---
 I don't want to change the current game, this is the most fun I've had since I left WOW behind, and I work for a gaming magazine, so I play a lot of games.  But if 2 years from now Blizzard decides to expand the world, I hope they introduce fights where teamplay and communication is more important than big dick DPS.
---
Interesting because our version: Rage Fire Chasm provides a lot of decent greens before rolling out to The Barrens.
---
Happy cake day
---
If I'm correct, after you finish the dungeon and head out (and you MUST head out, no one can be left within the instance), you right click your portrait and click 'reset all instances'.
---
Unless you mean something like a raid instance, because you can't enter that alone, you need to have someone with you and then convert the group into a raid to enter.
---
I can't believe you are all just replying retail to this.... There's a variety of reasons retail is bad and none of those reasons are unique interactive boss fights.
---
All of this is relative, depending on which caps (i.e hit) you have or not. Also 1 agi = 2 ranged AP and a very small amount of crit. Dont know further numbers top of my head but they’re all on Icy Veins
---
Raiding isn't everything, especially with the honor system coming out soon. While they aren't great in PvE content, you can get some fat crits in PvP. Although I would recommend a balance-heavy moonglow build instead of full boomkin. Nature's swiftness is a must have PvP skill.
---
the only content i am here for
---
And SoR also procs the axe, so it increases the value even further. On top of that Flurry is 1.5 speed which means you get a lot more Judgement of Wisdom procs to sustain your mana.
---
Playing 2 h arms.
---
Most of the time I'm the best warri dps atm
---
In retail you could get from 1-120 in literally a weekend without ever leaving a capital city. There are things I do like about retail but it’s just so insignificant to advance because the challenge is gone
---
This functionality has been implemented by various addons since vanilla itself, I don't see it being nuked from the game.
---
I can imagine them breaking the click-to-target functionality, but the information provided by the addon, breaking that would nuke things like damage/healing/threat meters. I don't see that happening.
---
You get punished too much by the respec cost to fuck around
---
Which server are you on?
---
THANK FUCK! I knew I wasn’t seeing things! Mobs even do this, it’s so annoying!
---
right? its not like you know when someone is gona gank you
---
it simply allows you to pay less attention to your surroundings and be fine
---
I dont really understand the rogue argument, yes you know when somone stealths nearby (and you only get the info if he stealth within combat log range) but it doesnt deny the opener from a rogue
---
I feel like ppl who whine about the addon are just bad rogues who would like to gank the victim during the worst possible moment and get a free kill without any resistance
---
Well, I healed 2 times through this encounter and I can't say i felt any stress whatsoever even without button clicking. VC was a much harder boss than Thermaplugg.
---
Love the light level, i wanna live there
---
Somehow most of my crew is still going strong. Most of us are in the 50s now.
---
I fished for 4 hours. At the end it equaled 1 winter squid per minute. Mightfish was much rarer.
---
One friend of mine has stayed. He was only going to play a little bit, so he is on another server and also alliance (om horde) 
---
I guess I will have to find new friends in game.
---
No more Flint water!
---
Druids - does leveling your weapon skill help as cat/bear for attack?
---
Well, I feel like you're committed now. You have to keep going at least until you get 1 eye of shadow to balance out your farming time vs gold gained.
---
The fact that it tells you that there is a rogue in stealth is kinda fucked up. As much as I hate it when I get jumped by rogues this is actually providing an unfair advantage to non rogues.
---
no
---
tbh most of the bosses in MC are pretty much tank and spanks too, at most you have to decurse a bit or move out of some aoe.
---
&lt;3 I appreciate this. I know it'll drop eventually, and if not I'll come back at 60 and grind it out with a friend, I just found this situation - just like you said - pretty frustrating. 99 is usually a great roll and to get beaten on a great drop is dejecting after having run the dungeon multiple times.
---
It took me reaching level 58 and reading a post about how most quests equate killing like 10 same-level mobs to realize that the way I have leveled thus far was tremendously inefficient.
---
I spent insane amounts of time travelling just to complete certain quests. I've also ran past lots and lots of mobs on my way from one quest to another.
---
Grinding has a huge advantage that isn't even mentioned here. Due to it's repetetiveness it frees up brain-capacity, as you don't really have to constantly think about your next step. So you can just listen to podcasts or something like that in the background.
---
For those of you interested my player name is Regan and I play in Thunder furry. Add me ladies.
---
You’re on to something
---
In that case, it basically doesn't matter what you chose, pick something you think sounds fun and go for it. Personally, I think Tailoring/Skinning while leveling and then switching skinning for literally anything else at max level is fun, Herbalism/Alchemy is also a fairly obvious choice. Both combinations grant additional tools while leveling and have value at max level, too
---
That's amazing, love it, a little low on the gnome count but i like it. :D
---
Idk if I have enough to chime in here. I’m currently leveling a warrior. I’ve only played 1-60 wow. I’ve currently leveled from 13-41 so far only running instances. I havnt quested once since. Like I still don’t even have fury stance. Didn’t get the axe. Literally no quests. 
---
I’ve done all the SM ones about 20-30 times each recently. 
---
I recently respeced to prot. It’s much easier to tank and easier to heal me then arms. If everyone is the same level as me in the group it is near impossible to steal aggro from me, and if you do I promise I’ll have taunt up. Usually I’ll start the group by challenging my dps to try to steal aggro and kill themselves. The only rule is you have to let me pull them. 
---
I’ve had 0 issues. Sunder is king. Idc what anyone else says. If you miss/dodge, you have to waste a taunt. Sunder is only on a global cool down, can be improved down to 12 rage. Is absolutely spammable.
---
Usually I’ll charge, switch to defensive, get a sunder on main target. (All the dps know the mob I charge is first target.) either get a sunder/revenge on all mobs. Cycle back to the first mob and 2/3rd sunder depending on current dps. Then I’ll cycle to the other mobs until everyone has 2 sunders so dps can open full on whatever. Hit demo shout, and spam shield block the rest to save rage and healer mana. Rinse and repeat on mobs with blood rage as your buffer in case they have to drink or you couldn’t save rage. It lets me keep taunt ready for any mishaps and I literally can hold aggro no issues. Except when we AOE run with mages, but that’s just kiting anyways. 
---
In my opinion, the dps difference for the ENTIRE instance between 1h and 2h, I personally feel the 2h Lowers my parties dps compared to my 1h. I’m so comfortable tanking that most of my healers are encouraged to dps when comfortable and everything becomes even faster. We usually never have to stop, my healer is always chilling, dps can drink between pulls, and I can have 3 sunders on all the mobs by the time you get there. 
---
(Yes I know I didn’t have the warrior 2h, but I got the lvl 30 2h sword from SM gy, the axe from arm, and I even got the 39 2h mace out of cath). Don’t get me wrong, I’m only have the equation. But I’m the full prot side and I have ZERO issue with threat. To the point I challenge my group.
---
Same here, i tank everything with a 2h, except hard hitting bosses. I dont see any reason to wear a shield.  
---
Sure my healers drink almost every pack, but i just charge in whenever they sit down and drink, no time wasted.
---
Because of the escort NPC. Besides, I said could.
---
I don’t agree with that. He can also need since he will use it and it’s better than his current shield.   
---
If they were a guild and the Pala was main tank ofc he would have to pass but when pug I think it’s no problem for dps war to need on shield just like a priest can need on dmg gear while healing.
---
yes.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
I really have to question where that ceiling light comes from.
---
Fantastic XP farm though. A lot of quests too so it's worth at least one run.
---
Hi, is it true that all women fantasize about geared protection warriors? 
---
I'm quite worried as a mage, it seems like I'm always seen as a gay best friend, it's like there is an ice barrier me and women. 
---
Yes, tailoring isn't the manliest profession, and it can be difficult for me to come out of my ice armor, but within me is a burning soul that ignites passion, and at the very least I'll always be able to put food on the table!
---
Are there any ladies out there who can appreciate arcane intellect or enjoy playing with fireballs?
---

---
Gnomish Battle Chicken (Engineering - Trinket)

---

---
Yup and then you wonder why you've got no quests left to do at 58 and have to grind the last 2 levels.
---
XP
---
Down from 9 to 3 1/2
---
(Yes I know I didn’t have the warrior 2h, but I got the lvl 30 2h sword from SM gy, the axe from arm, and I even got the 39 2h mace out of cath). Don’t get me wrong, I’m only have the equation. But I’m the full prot side and I have ZERO issue with threat. To the point I challenge my group. 
---
Not to mention, the shield off cath gives 1.5k armor. I’m full blues and currently only have 2k armor with out it. That’s almost double, from 25% damage reduction to 41%.
---
This. Quests are not the primary source of exp, more like directions on what mobs to grind.
---
Not wrong
---
You do realize what need and greed stands for right? You don't need on the gold value of an item, you need on the item itself. If you just want it because it's rare, and you can't use it, that's what greed was made for. It is not "completely logical", it isn't by a longshot.
---
I disagree, my druid is currently a 0/30/21 spec, which allows me to tank, melee dps, and heal. By your logic, I should be rolling need on EVERY drop that is not mail or plate, as even cloth spell damage gear could possibly increase my ability to heal. This is just rude, you should be the appropriate level, playing the appropriate role, in order to roll need on gear unless all the people in the group playing that role has that particular item, or is otherwise cool with you rolling on it. Communication is key here, and doing otherwise is just a dick move.

100% multiboxing.

If it’s not your bis you should pass to somebody who it’s bis for. Idk if that is though.

No, in cat/bear form it's assumed that you always have max possible weapon skill, for damage calculations.

I thought you wanted to be McPrepared, like a hamburger...

fuck. i've been swinging at enemies forever for nothing. good to know thanks!
---
250g right there ;) atleast on gehennas
---
It is my pre-raid bis. As it is for pretty much every melee class.
---
#nochanges is stupid because classic is on 1.12 and there is already changes. Also most the people crying #nochanges don't actually know what is correct because they didn't play og classic, instead they play private servers.
---
I've found a lot of old posts complaining about "raid nerfing". I'm wondering if this actually happened or was later reversed? I'm surprised Molten Core has been cleared so fast, I feel like it took a lot longer back in original Vanilla.
---
So i should go out of my way to waste peoples time outside my guild. Noted.
---
I'd echo the sentiments so far saying you don't need to go Holy/Disc to be able to support your friends character well. Shadow spec will likely make your solo/duo questing/grinding easier. Spec doesn't really matter for healing dungeons till after 50.
---
As for professions I'd recommend Skinning + Tailoring. This will let you vendor/AH skins for cash and let you make some gear for yourself with tailoring (as well as bags for the both of you!).
---
I keep telling myself "They will learn."
---
They do not learn...
---
Really refreshes the lvling meta with a new alternative, and you got the timing down for the raids later to come :-)
---
I ll look for it again. Thanks.
---
Good manners. It's also cheap (2g) to buy a blue gun for 30-35ish hunter. 2g is just trash for level 60, but huge upgrade for a lowbie.
---
Not if no bosses are killed. However if you join a save where bosses are killed, even just killing trash will save you.
---
Oh nice!
---
You fight people who can't possibly win because you enjoy when they complain that they can't possibly win?
---
Holy crap that’s was rough. That’s the classic I remember, patch 1.0, everything being hard, each group wondering whether we’d make it to the end, be bested by the dungeon or sabotaged by our own idiot selves. Things have been quite smooth this go around, comparatively
---
Might be a similar issue to the wolves/bears in WPL. They share spawns with spiders. People don't need to kill spiders for quests so they tend to ignore them ending up with the mobs re-spawning as spiders and therefore you see a shit-ton of spiders but no wolves or bears.
---
Maybe a Weakaura is possible, i think everything that is automated is blocked in the LUA.
---
And you're right, some wep-combos don't work, double Deathbringer died as the goal for a lot of guildies :-)
---
As long as you don't kill a boss, you are good.
---
This is gonna bang.
---
I like to fear mages who are aoe grinding :)
---
This is a really common build, in fact just looking at the tree you can easily see - spirit buff, damage and healing based on spirit, double spirit, and know that that's a good combo.
---
Maybe the whelps in burning steppes, they shoot fireballs and are lvl 48-50
---
This is awesome
---
You will not always get full durations from sheeps and traps , people can brake them early without your interaction, so if that means heartbeat resists then afaik it is in game
---
Use friend or alt to reset it while you're logged out
---
I commit to one char until there isnt much to do. Right now i can only get better gear in raids. I need 4 items more. So im lvling an alt between raids
---
I semi fell off as I'll never really have time to do all the high end raid stuff, and if you're not pvping in raid gear you're really just cannon fodder for those that have the raid gear. I've done it all before, pvp healing is so much fun but when you're in blues and a raid equipped rogue jumps you, you might as well just stand still and let it be over. On a good day the rogue won't hunt you specifically for the rest of the match. 
---
I say semi fell off as some classes are still great fun even just levelling them up from 1 to 60, really enjoying warlock for example, but not playing as much the last couple of weeks compared to launch.
---
Looks like the character selection In path of exile
---
You don't need to be competent in most 1v1 matchups, vanilla pvp is rock paper scissors.
---
Honestly way more of my friends have stuck with it than I expected.  The ~five people I’m closest to have all stuck with it, only a few acquaintances have dropped off.
---
Me am not that kind of Orc.
---
Can't remember where in the settings but there are options for when you enter combat/leave (get aggro from a mob).
---

Luna för the unitframes, Bartender for the Action bars.
---
I've left som space on the left edge for the Discord overlay in the raid setup, but I'm considering getting rid of it as it looks like crap.
---
If you're at 305 Weaponskill you basically gain 3% hit, making Human / Orc even more powerful.
---
And Edgemaster a MUST for every other race.
---
You know you're slow when the healer tells you to pull next pack and stop waiting around.
---
Lol paladin are lawful evil change my mind
---
Except if you join a raid that has a boss killed then killing trash will save you
---
Im even doing this with my alt, i just have a friend invite them both, after being logged out for 2 minutes you get leader on your alt.
---
Nothing collapsed. Hardcore players are still playing and aiming for speed runs, casuals are slowly hitting 60 and joining the fray in their own pace and everyone is having fun.
---
Maybe in 6 or 12 or 18 months everything will come crumbling down as the OP suggests but in all honestly why care? The game is fun now so just play for now.
---
in vanilla it took nearly 3 month iirc,
---
but its no suprise it took no full week for it this time around,
---
everyone could train the last 15 years for this moment (on private servers mostly), every aspect of the game is know and has endless guildes
---
Are you taking into account how much more damage your allies will be dealing because of the Crit buff?
---
Phase 2 is world pvp, he must be referring to gold for consumables.
---
Completely new and frickin HOOKED. I love riding around STV on what I call "patrol", just waiting for messages to pop up in zone about alliance ganking so I can go help.
---
Yeah.. I an dualboxing a warrior+druid... Really hope the druid is enough.
---
trust me lfgclassic wasnt shot down.
---
Yeah I need to fully explain that. You are good unless 0 bosses are dead.
---
Drain tank as a duo is actually still really strong, especially with another class like rogue. Even when solo, CoA still isn't very good on your primary target. Siphon life is basically the same. The advantage of drain tank is the nearly infinite sustain of drain life while dealing damage. Drain life should give you more hp than it costs in Mana, and should also do so even if you take 1 hit of interruption. 
---
This means you can constantly do immolate+corruption into drain life, which has better dps than wanding at your level. The duo can either let you body tank or use stuns to peel a bit. If you want, you could throw in a searing pain after or instead of your opening immolate to ensure you have aggro for backstab or general tanking since you have so much better sustain.
---
Destro will probably have better kill times by a little bit, but even with a duo, after like 5-6 mob kills you will need to drink for 30s. It has essentially no sustain and pretty bad Mana efficiency. Then again, if you prefer this playstyle, it's not bad. Just different.
---
9 times out of 10 the gankers are undead.
---
It's so much slower to single target a dungeon than cleave it.
---
If you measure speed by "how often you need to drink" you are doing it wrong. Slower pulls where you don't drink because you regenned the whole time are not faster.
---
You can always manage your time better, use more efficient heals, move quicker to the next pull location, cast in bursts to maximize spirit regen, have a spirit set, etc.
---
Of course there's a point when everyone is bad and you have to go single target, but as a healer I don't mind buying 1g worth of drinks so the run is 30 mins faster for everyone.
---
fuk thats annoying, was fighting some guy and both my traps were broken within like 5 seconds
---
Light be with you.
---
There are no addons, you just have to be mkre aware and mindful of potential respawn points. 
---
Look at how the remaining enemies are positioned. Are they circled around camps? Near huts? Scattered? 
---
Stay away from areas that seem civilized/active and drag your main target away from them so if they attempt to flee, they won't run into a pack of enemies.
---
You could shadwomeld for better survivbility.
---
536 Accounts with 747 players. Thanks for the little tip :P
---
That's unfortunate.
---
Does feral dps shaman fall under the same umbrella?
---
There shouldnt be a specific ppm.
---
I get 5% chance from each wep if u dual wield yes
---
Dishonorable kills is when you kill civilian NPCs. Killing low level players is not a dishonorable kill.
---
They call for help at low HP in the later stage of LBRS, you have to pull the mobs a bit back from spawn.
---
It will take time for this gold to reach market.  
---
And during this time gold will inflate.  
---
So 30 gold now may have greater value than 50 gold in one month.
---
On my part it was me being committed to a guild and a more or less played on the server I found to be best fitting for my needs and them not having any other commitments so they jumped to the first server without ques.
---
Fuck wow, fuck blizzard, despite everything people keep playing for some reason...
---
No question, I just want to complain about the drop rate for the Robe of Arcana pattern
---
Wait until p3 if u wanna make more gold. Its the best 39 warrior twink weapon
---
You can get a Pristine Yeti Hide drop from yetis in the northern cave in Feralas. It's a repeatable quest giving 100 rep, 2.2k xp and 70s a turn in. Once you get one, you have to travel (or HS) back to the island in Feralas to hand it in. Then travel back and kill the yetis for another one. You cannot stack them in your inventory. The last level I would recommend doing this at is 53. At 54+ you will get 20% less rep per level you gain making what is already a long grind even worse. You can group up with people at the cave because it will drop for the party. So you can do this grind in a group of 5 to speed it up for multiple people. If you do decide to do this grind, take skinning. I made close to 350g doing this. Much better than spending hundreds of gold on Runecloth. This took be around 45-50 hours on a Paladin, a slow class. I also had 6.5k into Revered with Darnassus from questing while leveling when I started doing this. This made this grind doable. If anyone is after the Darnassus or any other Faction specific mount, you MUST chase quests that give that factions reputation while leveling at the appropriate level, as in focus on it while leveling. This saves more time then you'd ever believe.
---
The Horde Equivalent is Perfect Yeti Hide. This will do the same but for Thunderbluff reputation if you're after that majestic Kodo mount.
---
This is awesome. Many years ago it was another player that noticed I was playing wrong, and without being crappy helped me set me on the path of success. Now I try to do the same whenever someone asks. A few weeks ago someone in my server was looking for help, and 30min later and 20 paragraphs of text he tells me I was more helpful than any of the websites he checked. Feels so good
---
I went from Altoholic to basically married to my Warlock real fast, the endgame dungeons just look too fun for me to spend my time questing through the barrens again.
---
Do you know of anyone who has killed trash then joined another raid group? Ive seen people say you have to kill a boss but nobody thats verified it.
---
Haha thanks!! Does FAP negate the cheetah daze?
---
Any tips? I want to do the same but with Ironforge
---
I think in that scenario i would just give the paladin the belt.
---
45-50 Hours or from level 48 to 53.
---
GOLDEN LEGENDARY!!!
---
This okay or may not be a thing.
---
Zoom out and have some awareness. I do it constantly as any class on pvp servers.
---
Sorry what is "po" and "Djs"?
---
You can go there as a horde. It's not easy tho
---
Correct.
---
How did it go?
---
They do - but most will have a mouseover macro for kick and blind so that they can interrupt without having to switch targets.
---
Feral dps shaman? o_o
---
Feral druids *can* do competitive DPS, though they also fall behind in later content patches. Any tryhard guild that wants to clear content as soon as possible will only bring optimal classes, which means warriors/rogues as the only melee. Other guilds, sure you can find spots, but you're not guaranteed smooth progression.
---
Yeah that is a big consideration too. Improved mana tap is nice and I took Dark Pact, although it seems like a lot of guides skip that. It's just nice to spam it to get a bunch of mana back when running  between mobs/waiting for respawns etc.
---
Most of the points are valid, especially the talent / stat distribution on gear ones. We are playing a version that has massively buffed the damage of most classes compared to the first months of vanilla. 
---
That said it wouldn't have changed much to how fast raids were cleared. Because we have the biggest advantage available now: knowledge. 
---
We know the mechanics of every boss and every dungeon inside out. And we know what we need before we zone into MC even the first time.
---
i knew i was missing something in that scenario
---
I thought everybody who wanted to protest had deleted their account. 
---
It's praiseworthy  if you want to be active in the human rights movement, but keep it out of the game world.   We are in Azeroth to escape  real life issues, big or small, and entertain ourselves.
---
My 2 60s in vanilla were paladin and warlock, you'd be surprised.
---
epic armor but difficult to make and afaik replaceable by MC gear
---
Them lightskin orcs get all the bitches.
---
It's what he calls his mom
---
Boss Mechanics start becoming a thing in AQ and Naxx. There are some of it in ZG too but in an early form.
---
Do you know anyone who has cleared trash then joined a new group? ive yet to find someone who has actually done it.
---
Horde or alliance?
---
Definitely keep first aid levelled up, it helps you have less downtime between kills. What server are you? H or A?
---
Druid tanks don’t have a sunder (as far as I know, been 20 levels since I had one), so for boss fights I used to blow my first 5 combo points on expose armor to make my hits hurt a little more.
---
Warriors have sunder, so expose armor is basically useless in most other cases. But if you ever are struggling against a mob solo or without a team, it could be worth a try.
---
Also, I suggest garrote and your combo bleed against mobs a few levels up. Bleeds don’t miss once applied, but if you’re fighting a mob 3-4 levels above you it can help increase your dps.
---
In theory you should always be killing things at, or 2-3 levels below you, but sometimes the challenge is fun.
---
and you need a key from one wing to enter the 2 others
---
Lvling as a pvp speced rogue. Improved stealth, and preparation is key in STV.
---
its considerably less traffic there.
---
Id say your best bet is to switch to ele/resto around lvl 45 and start building gear from there. Might be hard to do a full swap at 58/60 without heavy support from guild/friends
---
At 58 you begin your 200 hour grind to the winterspring frostsaber.
---
You can also run from one wing to another without a key.
---
3, one at a mere level 8, one at level 17 (Mage) and the other at 45 (Rogue). Rolled a priest with them in mind. Smh.
---
Do you need a swing timer for this? And would you just spam that macro or only just after your mainhand swing
---
oh yeah that makes sense, I never considered that your poor lil broken tooth is a pussy and can't hold aggro yet :D
---
Horde-benediction
---
You will struggle in PvP before you have intimidation, feign death and viper sting. After that it is smooth sailing provided you can FD trap.

Wild French spotted (po = pièce d'or = g, Djs = Donjons = Dungeons)
---
Yes, I joined multiple trash farms while raiding with the guild later same day at the start to get the hydraxian waterlords quest chain done to summon rag for the guild. Remember that this is scary to do, because you have to trust the guy who made the group to not invite you to a save where a boss has been killed.
---
You are a hero. Thanks for the laugh :)
---
how do you know mate, there was in actual vanilla wow so if it truly is no changes there will be one \^\^
---
I’ve got a good amount of irl friends who are actually leveling currently and we all have ambitions of raiding so I’m confident. Also, I’m carrying the fuck out of them because of lack of knowledge/slow totem shenanigans. They better be down lol
---
As a mage, I am currently trying this crazy build to pvp.

---
Is there a trick to make disparition work better ?   
---
Most of the time monster just keep attacking me as if nothing happened ... (happens a lot in maraudon , and i'm 60)
---
You could do just normal raid logs, it should include the boss kill and raid clear times ?
---
Tianamen square - The video game.
---
sure, but that is not really practical
---
Z-perl is an ui add-on wich tells you when you get aggro. But not from wich direction. Don't know if that helps you with this
---
It's what Wikipedia says.
---
Fun quest and potentially several hundreds gold cheaper. However, it has a manacost, infers mana 5 sec no mana regen and it can be spell-locked. So no thanks.
---
I assume he's french :
---
* Po -&gt; *pièces d'or* -&gt; gold coins
---
* Djs -&gt; *donjons* -&gt; dungeon
---
Two things to take into consideration:
---
Scope adds a 7 flat damage 
---
Fire damage is not reduced by armor
---
Did he really use "a" instead of "eh" ? ... Fuck that messed me up for a while
---
You mean the melee-hunter tree with the worst 31 point talent that ever existed? (basically a slightly stronger version of the warriors Rend)
---
Yeah. That bastard was hitting and dazing me like rambo when another lvl 38 ally hitting me and itself to fail my taming. After taming, it's acting like Garfield.
---
2h fury is quite good as well, though you need to spec into imp slam for it.
---
Fury will always be better for raids than arms, it just scales better with stats, and also doesnt rely on MS debuff slot.
---
So yeah, stay fury (just go into imp slam). OEB is a very viable weapon for dps warriors over lower-tier onehanders.
---
Atlasloot says the pvp rare set comes out in phase *six* while the epics are in phase 2. Is that true? I can't imagine why that would be
---
Has Dire Maul been released in NA? If not what time is it scheduled for release on EU &amp; NA servers?
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
Tbh, I constantly do this and it drives me nuts when the healer, or mana based dps, will start, then stop drinking at 20% mana when I go to do a small pull during the mana break. I'm not going to pull so much that we wipe, so just take your time and get to 100% before you join back in. It really helps keep up the pace of the dungeon and can easily cut 10 minutes out of a dungeon run.
---
In Zul'Farrak if you are doing the Divino'matic wand quest, a few minutes after completing the stairsway event Bly and his companions will attempt to hearth out.  If you talk to Bly while everyone is hearthing out and select his dialogue option, his companions will continue hearthing out and leave him to fight your team alone.
---
The mail from gubber blump was the first one for me it was suprising and wholesome.
---
Rallying Cry has a cooldown in the city, you can turn in the quest whenever you want but the buff wont happen for several hours? after the last time the buff went out.
---
planet of the apes
---
Should we tell him guys?
---
Zero... I have no friends.
---
Priest here, Geared warriors are what I love in public, mages are what I love in private with your cheeky arcane intellect.
---
Dm east
---
In TBC I was an altaholic after min/maxing my main and only used it for raids.
---
Best way to do it is get a 60, gear him up through raids, then find a friend to take turns carrying each others alts through dungeons.
---
I had 3 geared 70s, a 64 and the rest of the classes were 40+ by the time wrath dropped. I was going for a level 70 in every class
---
Is DM out already? Was away for a few days
---
I want to start leveling a Shaman but know im stuck with deciding which race i should pick. Are the differences that notable? I wanne enjoy both PvE and PvP at 60. Which race would be the best for me? (love the looks of all btw).
---
Did this with an alt since I have two accounts. I have a full bis/raid geared mage could clear almost everything in dungeons in a few pulls. Lvled alt to 35 and the leveled another alt by questing my alt that quested lvled faster. What I would do is give your alt best gear possible put a good enchant on their weapon and help with all the elite quests that they would normally have to group with.
---
I decided to not learn viper, it’s useful in pvp then? I also ordered a g600 mouse, I’m now seeing that hunters need twitch reactions and macros for days
---
In the badlands, its just coyotes and more coyotes, they don't share spawn points with basilisks and buzzards, there simply aren't as many spawn points for those.
---
What level are you?
---
Levelling Brokentooth freakin' sucks to be honest. 
---
You can try the Blood Elf mobs in Azshara, some of these are ranged but in general they have low armour and health so they die easily. 
---
I did a combination of 5 man dungeons and solo grinding to level him, and it was slow. 5 mans provided decent amounts of XP per run. The pet is useless in dungeons though and just has to stand beside you or it will die and get 0 XP.
---
UBRS is also complete trash for XP because you're in a raid and it seems there is an XP penalty for being in a raid
---
sure but getting locked down is a different story altogether.
---
Ofc finding pvp is easy. I'm just saying that pvping without goals/benefits feels kinda meh
---
BRO, i ditched leveling a warrior because of people ditching.
---
At least i can be a stereotypical Ret Pala GM now.
---
Well I guess I'm old now
---
Could I get some guides to sneaky rogue gold earning techniques at 60 pretty please?
---
At 40 I was SM gy/lib chest farming
---
Why havent everybody fucked off? Gutted content cuz of FOMO, no PvP, dated difficulty, Blizzard as a company fucking sucks.
---
Ya'll are pretty much drug addicts.
---
So what compels you to still be subbed to this place?
---
&gt;If I'm correct, after you finish the dungeon and head out (and you MUST head out, no one can be left within the instance), you right click your portrait and click 'reset all instances'.
---
Fuck no. You invite a friend or better yet your 2nd account. Make the other guy leader. /camp to logout of the instance. While you are offline, the other guy resets the instance. When you log back in, you will spawn outside the instance door.
---
No diremaul East.
---
Whats the name of that energy ticker?
---
no false. everyone need one boe epics/blues. thats the rules
---
Wth is that notion of grinding 58-60.. as if people don't spam dungeons at that point anyway.
---
This
---
I would like to know answer for this too, because i dont want to mainstream with rest of the guild warriors and go DW fury, i want to be something different and i dont mind about not being the top chard dps, i just dont want to be the 20th dps either..
---
Well, you could just make it so stealth doesn't show up in a non-friendly player's combat log, no?
---
50. Will check Azshara too. Currently I wanted to farm something but looks like I need to spam dungeons to get my pet in a decent level. That makes somethin like 46.
---
ITT: Rogues salty they can't open on a half health opponent 10 levels lower than them sitting and eating/drinking. I've only ever seen rogues complain about it and it's because you are all drama queens that want your class to be an insta PvP win.
---
Yep, changed his channel name to Barny a few years ago
---
This launch was my first time playing WoW (started a week late haha), but iove played MMO's since the EQ era.
---
Currently lvlv 55 and enjoying this world. Not sure why I waited so long to get in to WoW but regardless its dope getting to experience this all for the first time.
---
don’t you people do maraudon? 1g each on gehennas and that’s probably the server with the highest prices.
---
Sweet cool tip thanks
---
Potentially lol, if it can tell me when an extra mob tags me so I can dip
---
Amazing work just wish the stockades actually dropped some loot.
---
Nice sword, what is it? Reminds me of the one Tidus has in ffx
---
In case of blasted lands, all you find is 3 players sitting on each mob's respawn point.
---
It's fine to pull while I'm drinking, just actually "pull".  Too many tanks do this and decide the fight should be 100 yards away so that there is little hope for me healing anything unless I stop drinking immediately and run to the fight.
---
It's not difficult. Lots of the healing gear actually works amazing for elemental, and most of the elemental gear isn't good for other classes so it's just a free roll between shamans. Just make sure your guild knwos that you are ultimately here for pvp gear. Get priority on all the good pvp items and pass on all the good heal-only items. 
---
In phase 1 that would be: Aurastone hammer, Rag shield, Tier gear with +spellpower, that shoulder piece off magmadar with +nature damage.
---
LUL at not getting the neck
---
for MC trash runs, is there a way to reset the trash or do they just respawn after a certain amount of time?
---
So make the video after you confirm that there is not based on speculation
---
As a house DJ, That is awesome
---
-laughs in spanish-
---
A group  I wasn't a part of before I got fed up.
---
Not sure why the people commenting are disagreeing with you. It doesn't matter if the shield is an upgrade to some of the players in the group, the worth of the item (in gold) is an upgrade to EVERYONE in the party. 
---
The value of the item could help a player get another item from AH, or craft something; which would also be an upgrade.
---
BoE epics dropping shouldn't be looked at as an item,  but a clump of gold.   
---
The only difference I would have done is lettings the people that rolled greed prematurely do a /roll, to make it completely fair to everyone in the group.
---
big F
---
It really wouldn’t matter if you have even 1 other mage with improved blizzard though..
---
oh ok XD my head hurts
---
The secret to Redridge is saying "fuck this place" and going to Duskwood.
---
I did not pick Mark of Tyranny as a druid tank, BiS mitigation trinket for all of classic, cannot be replaced. I got the same reply you did unfortunately.
---
Excellent explanation, this is very cool.  Wish the rogue had something like this.
---
Wait you shouldn't be able to bind directly to spells in the spellbook without putting them on a bar. I've never seen that in years of playing wow.
---
But you can just put spells on action bars and bind them, it makes no difference to the end result. Like someone else said you can just hide the bars if you don't want them.
---
As a healer, I drink between fights. It's a non-issue.
---
Well, i mean would it honestly be THAT bad if got the healer gear. It would make me a better raider at healing, thus better access to the later raids, thus having access the the later BiS Elemental pieces? Or would that just be greedy as shit
---
I avoided stv. Didn't even touch the zone, and I hit 40 grabbed tanaris and didn't look back
---
You can reset, but there is a ton of trash in there if you actually aim to kill everything and it rewspowns fast enough that you can just kill those once your'e done.
---
Ahah epic fail
---
Need some input from resto shaman at lvl 60.
---
Should I keep collecting off spec enhancement gear to kill mobs for some quests, rep farms or clearing herb/mining nodes or is it better to stay in caster/healing gear and use a more spell oriented mix to kill stuff?
---
2 lvls? I was healing Cath as 33 :D priest power!
---
Hello, I have almost the same issue, if you can help.  
---
I am trying to add Dash into my spellbook, I follow the standard procedure of taming a pet (Bag'thera in this case) and he has dash already learned, so I begin killing mobs as I should to add it into my spellbook (Pet training). However, I've killed over 60 mobs and it still has not been added into my spellbook... Anyone have any ideas?
---
[Screenshot](https://ibb.co/Y2m0P6S)
---
Nice, never heard of it before. I'll download it when I get home. Spy
---
This doesn't really count as evidence of alignment though as the horde aren't necessarily "good" nor are the alliance necessarily "evil." At least in classic.
---
PSA: If you'd also like to put these poor kodos out of their misery, please head to Desolace. The graveyard is almost smack bang in the middle of the zone - [https://puu.sh/EsOD0/7e78bcadd0.png](https://puu.sh/EsOD0/7e78bcadd0.png)
---
@OP: If you want to re-use my carefully hand-crafted map to help educate everyone else, feel free.
---
Yeah, this wasn’t something they did during vanilla original release, and they stated that as such, they will not be doing it for classic. Sorry friend, that blows.
---
Man when I used to look for people to gank in wpvp, I'd always have the combat log open to scan the area, lol
---
how many locks and rogues in the raid? 
---
if your MT specced into impale/prot,  will you be overwriting their deep wounds?
---
wow would you know that in a game where you collect increasingly better gear at one point better gear will drop and you will replace it! Might aswell not gear at all because that gear will be obsolete at some point in the future. Or maybe i should just invite a warrior dps and a hunter with me everytime i go and try to get savage gladiator chest because friendship certainly beats 130+ runs of brd
---
As a non stealth user I think the juice isn’t worth the squeeze lol
---
Do anything I thinks it's called
---
Your mistake brother. Otherwise all druids also want their questrewards changed after every respec
---
Took me a good 20 levels before i got into the groove and started planning my walk path through a zone of mobs. 
---
Whenever im about to start grinding some mobs i take a quick glance over and see if theres any patrolls or if they stand still. If some part is already cleared or if its full spawn.
---
Start doing this and you'll die less.
---
Different factions on the same realm just leads to you getting spammed by lvl 1 characters when you gank someone.
---
If you think MS is in any way better than 2h fury for raids then you need to stop playing warrior now and your guild should feel bad about giving you loot at all.
---
Razorgore - Lvl 30 Tauren Feral Druid looking for someone to start questing in Thousand Needles with (and maybe do a RFK run with), I have not done a single quest yet there, only got the flight post.
---
Cool, my advice was mainly for a level 60 but the Azshara mobs should be doable for you. 
---
But yeah it really does suck as you will be gimped until you get him up to level
---
yep :] he droped the name keyori some time ago I'm glad hes making WoW videos as league kinda become doodoo
---
Thanks! And yeah, Stockades is pathetic for loot. It has some pretty good quest rewards but I believe it only has one boss that drops loot, excluding rare spawns.
---
This might be dumb, but can i do first aid, leatheworking and skinning at same time?
---
Well, unless the boss has healing, you're pushing off damage for a non-damaging debuff, that won't effect the boss. And unless your damage gain (Compared to damage done as Fury either DW or 2H) is larger than the damage lost from the DoT you knock off the boss, you can't exactly justify it.
---
So what it comes down to is:
---
* Does this boss have healing?
---
* Do I actually gain damage?
---
* Does my damage gain outperform the Bleed or Poison I'm going to knock off, as well as my damage in any other talent build?
---
* Can I justify effecting the playstyle of another player by making their poisons or bleeds pointless to use?
---
Hey man, hope I can help you out. Open the config window, where you are able to change the name options. Change the names to what you want. Make sure you save them, a small "save" textbox will appear after any change. Now you have to change the name of what the addon should present for you in the conuncil. This is done by changing the options on the right side, to the same options as you have on the left side. Does that make any sense?
---
Found a picture of it. Options is what's presented to the raiders, and responses are what's shown to the council.

---
I'm not a 100% percent sure to understand.
---
1) MH white attack swing
---
2) Queue HS
---
3) OH white attack swing and can't miss 
---
4) cancel HS if you're not almost overcapped or let it swing
---
So if your OH swings while HS is queued up, it can't miss ? Right ? 
---
Or do you have to cancel HS before your OH swing ?
---
The problem is that using slam is, at absolute best, annoying and tiresome. At worst, its nearly useless. Spell pushback from any damage, rooting you to the spot while you use it, and it resetting your swing timer.
---
Wooah there, take a breather.... I'm talking as the tank
---
Does the friend have to be in the group for the whole run? Or can I just invite someone after the kill, promote him to leader, logoff and have him reset?
---
it's crazy right my man dropped the name keyori COMPLETELY
---
This is fuckin cool!
---
I don't mind it so much when we get free mage water, but it gets annoying really fast getting only 20% mana out of a 4-8 silver beverage.  
---
And those parties usually have 1 or 2 lifetapping-warlocks who refuse to drain life / eat / bandage back up to make the dream team complete.
---
Don't bother with enhancement unless you're going all in.
---
Yes he is lol
---
Most likely a guess from their side, no official information about that afaik.
---
Well first of all I'm sorry for you bro. I hole you can change it.
---
Innever had the trouble of picking the wrong quest reward. In retail (was about WotLK I guess) once I accidantally sold a BiS Item and logged out so I couldn't rebuy it at the vendor. Next day I came back online to realise what I just did. I contacted a GM and he (thank god) refunded the Item for me and all I lost was the golds I got for it at the vendor.
---
Maybe you could open up a new ticket and see, if another GM contacts you. If he says the same, I fear you gotta life with the trinket you chose.
---
Good luck!
---
I feel like the Horde attracts a lot more dip shits than the alliance.
---
No offence but I think you should go and play retail then. I hate to be the "go back to retail" guy, but you're describing exactly what current WoW has been trying to implement for years now.
---
Somehow i would expect that town that does not have vendor for arrows also does not have mailbox :D
---
Yeah, seems everybody is gonna going to farm DM, but what about rogues?
---
Does the 6% only apply to fights against bosses or across the board?
---
Since you’re main goal is PvP ele, Reston is considered your offspec, which is the bottom rung for loot priority. It’ll go to the healers who plan to heal permanently, not just as a stop gap
---
Tomorrow
---
On a related note regarding warrior DPS discoveries in classic: WF totem during execute phase is a DPS loss. I don’t know the exact interaction that causes this as I’m not the warrior but apparently it was quite the revelation on the warrior discord and our DPS warriors explained it to our officers and shaman. Sure enough they have been parsing higher since the shaman stopped dropping WF during execute.
---
Honestly as I my main is a 56 war I can confidently say just constantly rotating your camera is your best bet and to either keep moving or pull way back with agro
---
Because my guild that used to play wotlk and classic pservers definitely is nochange..
---
Nochange people are mostly some guys that didnt play classic for 15 years, never really played back then anyway, dont remember the game and confuse time investment with skills.
---
Some guy commented that changes never worked on pservers which is simply not true.
---
There were many servers with changes, the most famous ones were some locked location with bgs and arenas.
---
Some tried out new dungeons, "new mechanics", almost all had instant max lvl and free starting gear for pvp. Just because the main goal for them was to actually get it running without major bugs doesnt mean that changes werent welcome. They just had to make the game playable first and this took some years.
---
(ofc purchaseable maxlvl is bs, but servers exclusively made for bgs/arena with free maxlvl would most certainly be successful over a long period)
---
This is great! I met a lvl 34 dual wielding fury warr in Arathi the other day. He had zero clue about his class. Gave him 5g and told him to grind 30 bloodscalp tusks to the next day. I farmed the charms when he logged off and helped him get his WW axe the next day.
---
Sometimes a small portion of your day can make someones week :)
---
There are PvE servers if you don't like that kind of stuff.
---
I'd love him full homo.
---
Yep. First aid, cooking, and fishing are secondary professions and you can learn them all.
---
However, you can only choose 2 primary professions such as leatherworking, skinning, mining.
---
You're a sad and pathetic little boy who takes games so serious because you got nothing else going on in your life. Go put your McDonalds uniform on and goto work neckbeard.
---
&gt; MT was fed up and most of the guild management was on his shoulders, so he quit the next day.
---
You weren't by chance on Proudmore? this is a pretty familiar sounding story.
---
I think it's happened to a lot of guilds though. A 40 person raid sounds like a lot of disposable people, and as a druid I probably was. But there were only 2-3 tanks and it only took one leaving for things to fall apart for everyone.
---
Flasking for mc lol
---
Rogues use ambush and eviscerate primarily due to garrote and rupture being pushed off by other debuffs, so it won't affect them.
---
As for Warlocks, most are destruction, since their dots would get pushed off. In a min-max scenario, You would want 1 warlock maintaining Corruption on the boss, as it is a fairly strong dot.
---
Finally, MT specced into impale does not care about deep wounds, he cares about the Impale boost to his yellow attacks. The deep wounds will get pushed off too easily, just as it is for any warrior, but Impale is worth it.
---
&gt;Those whelps are a shock to the system.  They are the first really hard-hitting mobs you encounter and can easily aggro you as you're running through the zone.
---
Those and the Defias Pillagers
---
It's really sad when people don't follow the Golden rule anymore and have open their mouth and belittle every person who does things slightly different.
---
Good lesson, hopefully I remember it next time a title like this launches.
---
As resto you can get all mail spellpower gear, which may not always be BiS but it's close enough. Rings, neck, trinkets might be a bit of an issue. 
---
The only problem I see with your plan is respec costs.
---
If you want to raid as resto and pvp as ele you're going to run out of gold really soon.
---
And I keep telling them to Run to the tank not make the tank chase you...... I really should get to work on a intercept macro.
---
Ok, your point is clear, but what I want is the justification and/or evidence. I was always told it was due to debuff limit, but my research tells me this won't be an issue. I'm fine being proven wrong, in fact it would help me make my decision, but give me something to work with!
---
He felt stupid enough to delete his comment
---
I would absolutely agree if not for the fact that those specific mobs are killed by everyone and their mother. Farming them takes an age, I would MUCH rather farm a different mob even if there was no XP attached to make up for the XP you lose out on by completing the quest with bought items.
---
Grammar: the difference between knowing your shit and knowing you’re shit.
---
What's the best source for large brilliant shards? I'm thinking about stashing lots of living essences (DM farming should flood the market) and when Cenarion Circle starts get the friendly **Sylvan Shoulders** recipe and mass craft those blues to then DE them into shards which at that point will be at use in CC rep quests.
---
Alliance, human. The added weapon skill from OEB isn't as useful for me (still helps a little with reducing boss dodges).
---
Looking the graves all give some kind of grey silver item you can sell. They also regularly have equip able items they sell for 20s to 1g a piece.
---
Each run gives you between 1-5 green items that you can sell/disenchant/AH. In addition potions, mageweave/silk cloth and if you are really lucky blue/epic boe that you can sell between 20-300g
---
As long as it doesn't break the rules, anything goes. This doesn't break the rules. This is also negated by PvE servers.
---
Unfortunately in vanilla wow the sub and combat talents can’t be combined as easy! Since u want the hit from combat for pve. And the utility from sub for pvp. All that would be fine if it wasn’t for the points you HAVE to spend in assassination. U can’t stunlock proper without relentlessness. So you always go points in assassination then choose if you want combat for pve or sub for pvp. 
---
You could try assassination daggers. I like the spec for pvp, and it is not half bad for pve. U won’t be topping the meters but at least you won’t be doing boomkin dps!
---
Yikes. I've provided plenty of evidence about what he did not only being okay, but also being the best he could do in such a situation. All of your arguments thus far seem to imply you're okay with the less-than-10 people in the "clique" taking advantage of 120 raiders. That's literally the only reason you could possibly think what he did wasn't okay. 
---
He took materials from 120 people, and gave them back to the 120 people. That's literally what he did. There's no way to argue that isn't what he did, because he's provided an overwhelming amount of evidence that he did exactly that. You claim that I'm jumping through hoops to justify his actions, all I did was point out the screenshots that were provided. You're haven't even referenced the existence of the pile of evidence he provided as an explanation, let alone tried to argue any point relevant to any of it. You're just calling him a ninja and willfully ignoring any evidence to the contrary. I said you're jumping through hoops, and it's pretty obvious you have a stake in this - all you did was say "no u". That's gonna be a big yikes from me, dog. I think you've made it pretty clear.

If anyone wants to donate to the Lost Kodo Foundation I am setting up a new charity which will help save many Kodo's around Azeroth from this kind of torment.

Just keep leveling, you make more gold at higher levels.

&gt;but within me is a burning soul that ignites passion, and at the very least I'll always be able to put food on the table!

This reminds me of a quote from Family Guy:

Thanks :)

Which one would you use as a lvl 50 Enhancement Shaman?
---
\-The Rockpounder (2H mace, 42.7DPS, 2% crit chance)
---
\-Princess Theradras' Scepter (2H mace, 46.5DPS, 160 dmg and -100 armor proc)
---
\-Gatorbite Axe (2H axe, 45.8DPS, 230 dmg proc)
---
I'm dobuting between the two maces (one has higher DPS but the other has crit chance). I think I would go with The Rockpounder... What do you guys think? Thanks!
---
The problem being the distance of the combat log range - it's often longer than the viewing distance, especially with terrain blocking line of sight. So unless the rogue/druid is running around in stealth the whole time the stealth skill will be picked up by the opposing players log.
---
+healing is 'lossless' as well because equipping more +healing does not increase your percentage of overhealing. We've seen millions of logs over the years to thoroughly demonstrate this principle.
---
I suspect you have a mental model that you're casting a spell that precisely covers some damage and then you add a pile of extra healing - all of which goes to overhealing. The problem with this model is that it doesn't match how people actually heal. Rather, they select the heals appropriate to the situation, so they're more likely to use smaller heals with +healing (and thus save mana).
---
Elemental is only viable in pvp tho and the only spec really viable for raiding is resto :-( what am i supposed to do
---
Or you use the aoe buf in conjunction with the freecast you got once each three minutes ;)
---
_falls off a wolf_
---
I really need to get off my ass and lvl.
---
That worked, thanks!
---
Thats the perk of being a tank, a valuable resource can demand valuable drops. then again some people ( read pure dps ) dont like things being reserved because reason x
---
So what? I run a dungeon a couple of times more and at the same time build a community that's likable and actually is friendly instead of being selfish. 
---
We had a hunter in our group to Strat UD last night who asked if I would roll on the Baron's Cape in case it dropped. I said yes and linked my current cape. They said "alright" and immediately left the group - I suppose they wanted no contenders on the roll. I told them per whisper that if they had linked me their cape I would have considered passing on it depending on if their upgrade would be much more worthwhile. They replied with "Something came up m8" which I 100% believe not to be true but I didn't question them any further.
---
I like to talk to people, I like to figure things out if we *do* have an issue about gear. At the end of the day I do want the cape of course but if it takes me an additional run and hunter was only there for that one item, I have no qualms about passing it up. I'm along for the ride and enjoy the game not get my BiS as fast as possible. It's not a race - it's an MMORPG with real people.
---
A druid asked me if I needed a certain piece in Scholomance a couple of days before, they wanted it for their cat form. I said I was looking to get that item and don't have anything really good in the slot. They passed on it. Conversely I deliberately passed on a leg piece that I could've taken but it would not have been a huge upgrade, so passed that to him for cat form. I'd rather be player that works for a community instead of a player against the feeling of a community. But that's me, if you wish to act differently there is nothing stopping you from doing so.
---
I meant the guildnames aswell
---
Bottledpoop.
---
Follow the pink mushrooms in WC.
---
no1 fucking cares about your spec in a pug you dipshit, need if need.
---
i dont get it
---
He flew away. lol.
---
All my friends still play. We are split up on 2 servers though.
---
Really hoping paid character transfer comes in the later phases so the ones still playing can meet up on a new realm.
---
There is a way to increase your maximum zoom distance. This might increase your awarness of your surrondings. I dont know how it exactly works but it requires no add onm. Just google it :)
---
Disparition?
---
Great rogue/warrior weapon being wasted on a hunter.
---
&gt;and it resetting your swing timer.
---
This is the part WHY you use slam. It resetting your swing timer is why 2h fury is viable.
---
That’s a rogue MC sword
---
Most
---
From WoWWiki: " Unaffiliated with any specific government, the primary druidic organization on Azeroth, the Cenarion Circle, answers to no one save itself.  "
---
Its probably why most true hearted Druid players are absolutely lunched in PVP. 
---
"Yes Mr Horde Warrior, I see you, and instead of shredding you from behind in a non honorable way, I will actually lend a Moonfire or a couple shreds to your efforts. Oh? You're now impaling me on your twohander? Oh well, that's on you and your conscience. " - how it feels.
---
You can also HS to IF/Org and blow up everyone in at the AH. Haven't tried with living bomb, but works well with Vael.
---
Can i get the warrior discord info please?
---
Yeah, I could def see that. Right now though, mail &amp; bank combo for me is easy and the price is definitely right
---
PvP as resto or gear up as Ele from the honor rewards.
---
Imagine wow looking like this.
---
This. I play melee classes since Vanilla and I rotate my cam every other second. Maybe its a leftover of my times tanking, cause a tank should always check if their group got aggro or sth.
---
Max out zoom, rotate your cam, pop Berserker Rage and spin to win. There you go. Good luck on your journey.
---
I am always going 18/33/0 as fury warrior, because I can't live without Anger Management. I save one point from dual wield spec to put into Anger Management. It makes tanking dungeons so much nicer as you keep a good amount of rage after a fight and even if the healer has to drink for 40% mana.
---
I also dont put 5/5 in battle shout, because I value piercing howl.
---
probably because it'd take 30 min for them to kill eachother :P
---
Tank: looses aggro on one mob for a half second
---
Group: OH NO END OF THE WORLD RUUUUUUUUUUUUUN

Black Dragonspawn eyes for the Horde Ony attune. You need 20 but they always drop 2 at a time, so you only need 10 actual drops

---
While I do understand you, I ended up becoming one of those. Essentially; I knew three friends of mine who were going to play WoW Classic like me. 
---
Being an alliance for life player, I automatically ruled out playing Horde, and would prefer to not play on a PvP server. Now, of those three friends, two rolled not only horde but also on a PvP server. I am not in any way trying to start a debate about which faction/server/build/whatever is best - but I do have a very clear idea of what I want to spend a lot of hours on and what I don't. 
---
So sadly we have ended up playing on different servers. This is just one story from my perspective, and while it must come across as me being stubborn and perhaps anti social, it's not a choice that I regret. You see, I really like my character, guild, and not least server.
---
Basically; I regret that not all of my friends play on the same server as me, but I don't regret sticking to my faction and class.
---
Don't invite Fury warriors. Problem solved.
---
You...need...flurry..?
---
How do I get those little personal resource bars under my character like in retail? Can an addon do this?
---
How’s that work?
---
Well done.
---
Dual wielding... *Laughs in BRE*
---
I created in my eyes alot shortcuts to farm specific bosses that alot people that played psver never tryed/used (I'm new to classic but i love mindsoothe from priests :D).
---
For example it is possible to kill voone und voshgajin in LBRS with only killing 15mobs in total (mindsoothing and mobs reseting).  
---
Same for BRD you can clear the Arena and Angerforge with a total amount of only 9 mobs to kill (not incl. the Area mobs tho!)
---
I usually tanked him below the "Doorway" to not get knocked up so far, mainly because of not wanting to clear trashpacks, but didn't think about the water
---
If something is bis for multiple party members, how can you expect them to pass on it? Yes, it might be a bigger upgrade to some but they all need it and have to put in the same work to get it.
---
The only sort of favoritism I would give in this way is I'd give someone who spent the last 2 weeks grinding for an item priority over someone who spent much less time for it.
---
In the same vein if your main focus is e.g. tanking, why would you have to pass on gear that you need for your mainspec, just because you didn't enter the instance as that role? A minor 2h weapon upgrade is utterly useless in sword and board tank spec, no matter what role I came in as.
---
All your method of loot distribution does, is disincentivize a tank inviting a hunter for a LBRS for example.
---
and there obviously is a difference if you claim yourself a 40man raid passed you by and didn't kill you. this never happens in an opposite situation when the 40 guys are horde and the 1 guy is alliance, he gets camped and killed as many times a possible.
---
It only shows an unstealthed character who uses a stealth ability within range of the combat log. Even if it didn't and it could actually detect that a stealthed player was within combat log range, what would it matter? They're still stealthed, and combat log has a *very* wide range. Are you going to go combing through the entire area with aoe spells hoping to hit the rogue?
---
Hey, you gotta assume the Night Elves knew what they were doing when they invented them that way lol... Maybe they became experts with wheelbarrows and just transitioned the existing technology...
---
Wow thanks for posting this to reddit, I'm downloading it when I get home!
---
whatever the best one you have.
---
Found the rogue.
---
As others already said, it existed in vanilla, so why not in Classic. All it does is reading the combat log. Which a million of addons do.
---
Get over it.
---
Razorgore Horde - Lvl 30 Feral Druid looking for someone to start questing in Thousand Needles with (and maybe do a RFK run), I have not done a single quest yet there, only got the flight post. I play in the evenings.

LF EU Dreadmist Horde
---
I'm new to classic and WOW in general so I'm no expert on dungeons and stuff, so looking to learn. Would be looking for players around my level to run current dungeons with (and also higher level for when I get to that stage). Not looking for anything too sweaty/prestigious.
---
Ah darn. 2H fury is actually comparable if you had windfury.
---
Does it all rly happened like that? I did run ZF maybe 8 times and all of the groups where rly nice. Never had so much bad luck in an instance.
---
But the video and how he tells the story is really super funny.
---
Can I get your autograph?
---
You cancel it after your OH swung.
---
Those last 10 are brutal. Best places are: Eastern Plague Lands, Winterspring, Azshara. 
---
I found EPL gets farmed a lot, whereas WS is less farmed, check Google for the spawn points. The very south of WS has decent spawns of Rich Thorium but you have to dodge the elites.
---
If you just want thorium, you could go Un'Goro and run round the outside then when you gear near the north Flight Point dive south and hit the mountain in the middle as theres Rich Throium there.
---
The staff of westfall? 
---
Got called out for being a dumbass for using it instead of a sword/axe.
---
I also used it till i had Archeus at lv 28.
---
Well it's just a matter of sharing the loot, you want the guild to give you all the amazing heal+dps gear, and instead give the healers most of the amazing heal gear. You'll probably end up with some heal only pieces too eventually yes. Anyway for shamans it's quite common to have one or 3 shamans wear very low healing power gear with lots of +mp5 for totem focus, you could be one of those shamans since mp5 is usually just dungeon gear.
---
Not for eu tho :(
---
nah but it can be extrapolated for other stuff. A more general way to put it would be don't get involved in something you don't want to do yourself, as in, don't over-invest into an activity you did not genuinely want to do by yourself in the first place lol.
---
Why is Skullflame Shield so so expensive when its not even BiS?

Every night when I've logged on this last week, I see the same guy taking the boat from menethil to theramore.

I always make sure to wave at him.

---
Deadmines has been out since release..
---
Gd.
---
Sorry you havent gotten one yet. But regarding tips, we can't give you tips to get better RNG.
---
Try going farming something else for a while and coming back? Often I find this is one of the best ways to get an elusive drop to actually drop.
---
I never played warr, but a friend back in vanilla cleared the whole game as arms (yes, including naxx). He was devoted to his guild, always raided prepared, had practically 100% attendance and was in a good standing in the damage meters. Nobody batted an eye ever.
---
Flurry for added rage generation to use my moves, right? Ok, are there numbers that compare the extra damage and rage from flurry to the extra damage and rage generation from sword specialization, and the extra damage from Mortal Strike hitting considerably harder than bloodthirst? You would also have to factor in death wish. 
---
Again man, no need to be condescending, my gut tells me you're right, I just don't want to blindly follow it.
---
Only with a 50% Chance saldy. Which can also be resisted
---
This is exactly how I use it. I feel bad if I just kill someone for nothing, so I decided to only kill people on my kill on sight list. That way, I always know that he deserved it.
---
Except that the fucking rare never spawns
---
That is possible.  
---
There was addon that was banned by Blizzard. It was drawing notification on surfaces, so if boss will drop giant bomb - this addon would write big red zone where you shouldn't stand.  
---
After month or two it was banned, because Blizz thought that it's too much.
---
out of the 8 or so that said they'd get 60 and play a lot or raid or whatever, about 4 of us still play. 3 of them stopped around 30-40 and 1 of them barely got past 20. lol
---
Seems way more plausible than my previous idea
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
It's really not that big of a deal. Everyone here likes to blow shit like this out of proportion.
---
Of course it's not ever getting banned. It's literally just parsing your combat log. It's the most basic of addons.
---
I'm not opposed to 2H usage. I prefer a 2H to dual wielding. I just don't like slam :P But I may just have to get used to the damn thing.
---
About 80% fell off.
---
Dont waste mana on damage spells. They will look pitiful in comparison to the monstrous DPS the warrior will put out and you will be slowing down the run.
---
Totem twist at the 2nd boss, so you dont lose DPS on LoSing the sacrifice.
---
Put down WF, put down grounding the next GCD, have Zevrim eat the grounding with his sacrifice. If the warrior resists the sacrifice, he wants to communicate this so you know to put down the WF again. Or just look at the castbar.
---
Lat boss your warrior wants to kick the DoT manaburn and the shaman wants to upurge the rejuvenate that the boss casts.
---
VERY important. The imps at the lass boss dont despawn when dead as long as the boss is not dead. Put loot on FFA and loot the imps while the warrior keeps tanking the endboss. They have a high amount (2% but there are like 15 imps) of dropping blue sapphires and other big gems except arcane crystals)
---
I'm agreeing with the "All need" mindset if everyone in the goup does to.
---
In your story everybody but the warriors clicked greed even After people debated about the all need.
---
So what you did is actually called ninja looting yes...
---
It's where the Night King is slowly but surely transforming humans into undead for no apparent reason because D&amp;D never fucking explained.
---
Might be there best wow meme I've ever seen
---
It hurts
---
wast
---
Sorry, but I have no better words to say: this build is completely useless.
---
You say that you have mana issues, yet you didn't take Mental Agility nor Spirit Tap. You didn't max out Shadow Focus making your shadow spells getting resisted more hence costing you more mana to reapply them. And I could go on and on whats wrong with this, but it simply isn't worth mate.
---
It was rival pvp guilds who would do the same to us. Sometimes you would have 200+ on either side. Different strokes I guess we all had fun.
---
My my, aren't we a little triggered? Did you read my post at all, or did you just want to make yourself feel better by insulting someone else?
---
My 1st raid attempt ended like this, the guy who was here just to help setting up the raid had a 8/8 ID, ended ruining the raid day for 39 people. I wouldn't try doing trash run with random strangers.
---
Yep. Not like we don't see many people fly there, but this one was just too funny for us.
---
&gt; The problem is that using slam is, at absolute best, annoying and tiresome. At worst, its nearly useless.
---
it is not that at all. it's fuckin awesome to get the timing down and climb the dps charts.
---
That was my attitude until I lost a roll on atal'ai gloves of healing to a dps, with the item in question statistically a 1:250 drop rate per run according to wowhead. I also lost Gizlock's Hypertech Buckler to a dps, but that one is way more common (even if it did take from mid 47 to nearly 51 of constant mara princess/goblin runs to see one drop again) 
---
 To be clear, I don't blame either of them for rolling since both of them will probably end up healing endgame anyway, but I won't be passing on upgrades anymore.
---
Well, server maintenance doesn’t even start until 9am PDT (2h20m from now). In-game news says it’ll be sown for 1hr. So, 8am PDT/11am EDT it’ll be back up
---
We started with a group of like 15 friends on horde. 5 players quit around lvl 40 and  then 2 people rerolled alliance and were joined by 2 rl friends that just started classic. 
---
Three days later all my friends rerolled alliance as well - we all had characters around 40-50 on horde.
---
So now I am super pissed that everyone is playing alliance and I had to switch from my 46 UD mage to a 22 gnome mage.... and I will probably quit the game soon and I guess 80% of my friends as well. LOL
---
Can it be also devoured by Warlock's Felhunter?
---
I'd get a point for slightly less effective ferals as Windfury doesn't work for them, but why the he'll should Resto suck on Horde?
---
Why does that bring you joy? Healthy adults don't get satisfaction by seriously annoying strangers just for the sake of it. Have you considered therapy? I'm actually concerned for your mental health and the strangers you meet in real life.
---
At this point, I'm not quite sure you *can* read. Best of luck with the new guild.
---
I used to play NE rogue, mostly for the look and the mount. The racial ability is kind of useless for a rogue though.

These are good questions to ask. I suppose at best, it will depend heavily on my raid composition.
---
While I am confident that I will personally do more damage as arms with my current gear (Strong 2H, weak everything else), I am not confident at all that the increased damage is sufficient to justify knocking off a damage debuff.
---
It's been years ago for me. But I flew in and managed to get in alive as a frost mage.
---
I wanted to say vanish, oops.
---
If you want tank-item - it's better to tank, yes.
---
Hehe,
---
At least it's not in the offhand! 
---
That + core hound tooth, sounds good.
---
But I'd prefer not getting people mad and stick to my blue 2hander
---
&gt; flair is Horde rogue
---
&gt;  Night elf
---
You can get a blue set that's not bad but grinding to high warlord is impossible unless you can dedicate obscene hours to grinding BGs and honorable kills
---
Your order is right. While HS is queued, your OH rolls Hit like a MH instead of the 27% miss it normally suffers
---
Slowness of attack speed is a big factor too. The slower the weapon, the higher the dmg per attack. Thus bigger burst from windfury
---
Truth. If I were horde, this question wouldn't need to exist. Windfury fishing with hamstring is far more tolerable than Slam weaving.
---
I grinded level 37 and 38 at the ogres north of South Shore (in the snow area), with pick pocket macro on my opener. Like 2ish hours per level, and around 6 gold per hour from silver/vendor trash. Not sure how much the gold per hour would be if I were to include the stuff I mailed to my bank alt and sold on AH, but perhaps 8g/h.
---
Not sure if this is great or not, but was a pretty chill spot to grind while having Netflix on in the background (saw like one or two other players total). The mobs are 34-36, so should be efficiently farmable from level 36.
---
Looks like phantom blade
---
Whyyyyy...?
---
I mean.. Wf generates additional Attack which generates rage.. So more rage for execute.. So..higher execute dmg unless I am missing something
---
Tried out this so i could be mostly gimp specced prot war but still have a little bit of solo-ability grinding mobs without taking a decade per kill.  
---
Focuses on getting impale, bleeds, overpower, and stance dance rage retention, while taking most prot defencives, with a spare 2 thrown into cruelty.

---
I am the MT2 of my raid, do no touch Onyxia in P2 at all and on some tanking side whelp duty, just have to avoid the breath actually, being careful to be like 7 or 8 on aggro table at the end of phase 1 and when she lands I get her back with one Shield Slam usually. Everything is about where you're at on the threat and where you're at and how fast you hit her/climb when she lands, not when she's in air.
---
The Kinelory escort quest in Arathi. She can go bear form and actually put up a fight, rather than dying in two hits.
---
IKR. I don't play anymore though I'd love too. Just so time consuming. The nostalgia hits me in my feels. Ive been excited about DM release and I don't even play. I sometimes go to a friend's to watch him play. I just know if I started playing again either my family or my toon would be neglected.
---
I love just running up beside a lowbie in cheetah and casually drop a trap on their feet and continue forward without looking back.
---
I feel like the road runner *meep meep*
---
There is one way to get the other quest reward.. It's a bit fickly and requires some effort, but all you have to do is roll a new character and do the quest again.
---
It has a unique skin, it's purple in quality, it's viable for max level gameplay.
---
I use old reddit and haven't changed it
---
All my friends quit already. 3 never got past 25. 2 i levelled with to 40 then they were gone too. I made it to 50 myself before i got lonely and bored
---
I want to heal myself as warlock but healers often always spam overheal me if I do 1 life tap.
---
Not unpopular at all my dude.
---
What do you base that assumption on? What if classic has a sustained player base that makes it a good business decision to develop an expansion for classic? 
---
Remember that TBC introduced 2 key features that many players have said ruined the game and Blizz devs have publicly regretted implementing so whilst classic is held in high regard amongst the community, there are serious flaws in TBC that would stop people continuing the journey.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Or use flare on the dino
---
Id probably have put hunter as lawful evil, druid as neutral, mage as chaotic neutral, shaman as chaotic good, and priest as neutral good (no shadow at all)
---
Type /join lookingforgroup 
---
It is global :)

Enjoy!
---
It will be released after the maintenance at 7 am PST.  servers are scheduled to be down for 1 hour, when they come back up DM will be enabled.
---
Hunter pvp is basically getting the 41 yard talent and with cheetah staying at that range until the fight is over. You kite every class no matter melee or caster.
---
And if I’m not in westfall and I see people spamming DM in world? Or see post about DM runs on reddit? Relax buddy
---
There's an option in leatrix that will do this for you

Leatrix will do this for you

I was kicked from a group the other day because the tank died after pulling 5 elites when I only had 25% mana left out of my LOS...told me it wasn't my mana that was the problem...
---
Oh and someone was lvling their dagger skills while there, so was doing absolutely no damage...
---
True... The Rockpounder is also slower (3.70 vs 3.40)
---
Well there it is, the gauntlet thrown to the floor. Seems I'm going to have to give it a try and figure it out :)
---
No way it could get passed in China's censorship. Change the blood into purple koolaid. the rats into chickens. Add some blankets for those sleepy alliances. Maybe..... MAYBE, we stood a chance.
---
LOL what a noobish dickhead. The best DPS players control their thread to do as much damage as possible without pulling from the tank.
---
But it's nice that we healer can show those guys a lesson. Getting aggro and taking damage? Can happen, I'll keep you alive but require you to see that you drop the aggro. Do that repeatably and don't listen to advice? Be prepared to die a lot.
---
Priest T1 is garbage anyway, you're much better off running with mostly pre-bis until T2, so yeah, DM is good for a couple of nice items. :)
---
Can rogues lockpick it?
---
Fuck Blizzard

Fear them and run if needed

Remember to stand on a candle for extra height.
---
Barrens is pvp optional for the horde. I think redridge is more akin to Stonetalon mountains
---
Lol saw the same thing when I was in STV “pls help there is horde here by the big tree”
---
I hate this huntard
---
Check the AH, prices have been going down fast. I grabbed Robe of the Void recipe for 35g and I'm already regretting it as current price is about 15g. Mage and priest robes that were like 200g few weeks back now go for 40-50g.
---
I pretty much agree but in order to balance broken specs, for example, you would have to completely overhaul the itemization of hybrid classes which would make things massively more complicated than releasing TBC would be.
---
That moment when the mage keeps eating/drinking and the fight goes exactly the same
---
Every classic class needs or could benefit from tons of macros. Yes viper sting is key against priests as they struggle for mana and can not remove poisons. It is alright against mages too but they have more tools to regain mana than priests. Paladins, shamans and Druids can remove it but it worth using it once to see if they notice it.
---
I want to complain that I haven't gotten a SINGLE drop in a dungeon that I was running for.  I have received other pieces that I won rolls on in dungeons, but in probably 30 instance runs while leveling I never got the drop that I was targeting.  I'm 56 now and hopefully I my luck was just waiting to pay off at this point - the only point that matters.
---
Fishing and skinning in stv. 180gold from 30 to 40.

How to stop stuff from spawning on top of you?
---
Pull the mobs to a safe spot where you know mobs don’t spawn. Don’t just charge in and stand there tanking it.
---
In early wotlk my GM cheated on his wife who was also in the guild and it killed my guild.

If you think raids and dungeons have the same demand for tanks you're honestly just a moron. I know you're not 60 yet but trust me, if you watch a video of a raid, you'll see that only 1-3 of 40 members are tanks. While in dungeons 1 of 5 people is a tank. Now... I know this is tough for you to understand but 1/5 is a larger number than 2/40.
---
So yes, you will run into dungeon tanks that don't tank raids and subsequently need dps gear.
---
It you want to store them longer and have the added security of a second 30-day timer, then you need to take the items from mail with your bank alt, and send them normally to your main. This costs a second postage, and it'll take an hour for the mail to show up on your main but then you'll have 30 days before the mail is returned to your bank alt, and another 30 days before it is deleted permanently. So you either do that, or use the instant and free return from your bank alt, and only have 30 days of storage. There's no option with instant return and 30+30 days of storage.
---
3/11. The ones who left did so at around 33-37.
---
They added the clock #notmyclassic lol
---
you can let the tank charge into a pack, when he's about half HP (and you are still ooc if far enough from the action) cast a big heal and spam the drink button. you get in combat after the heal is cast but you also sit down  drinking. saves a bit of time between pulls and one big heal normally is enough to drink for additional \~5-6sec
---
 Not sure anyone will see this, but does anyone know what the UI is called where the circular minimap is in the middle at the bottom of the screen, with health bars on each side and skills/talents across the very bottom
---
after server maintenance.
---
None actually, a few didn't even start, but the ones who started are still playing. We all got day jobs and life, so none of us is 60 yet, but we will get there eventually. We didn't pick classes and speccs tailored to eatchother, we all picked what we like, we knew it would be a long grind from the start. Nobody started duo questing so we are not bound to eatchother, if one of us gets behind we just help him as mutch as possible
---
Dont go for the epic mount specifically. Do dungeons now for prebis and to get raiding asap. Doing all these dungeon quests at level 60 give 5-6. Once you have prebis you can do all the high level quests from the world like Winterspring, EPL, WPL, if you still have some left for 30-50g an hour. Just riding from lights hope chapel over to egan in the plaguewood gives 5g for example. 
---
Once you have prebis from dungeon running and have exhausted quests, you should have enough gold or be close to buy your epic mount.   
---
Good luck.
---
im a druid, i have perma stealth
---
Is this for both EU and NA servers?
---
If you only have one interest then that shows an unbalanced personal life.
---
You should have arms warriors. Even if they’re 2H, they should be specced fury, specifically 2H slam spec fury
---
Meanwhile I've spent a dozen hours farming thorium and haven't seen one.
---
Boom! I'll take it. 🙏
---
/r/thathappened
---
This is the result of a dkp guild I bet.
---
Those GoT fans sure are a contentious people
---
Its a must for pvp.
---
Its basically how you beat any mana dependant class. Get to 41yds., activate cheetah and drain their mana while getting off a autoshot here and there. 
---
It's so funny kiting other players, sooner or later they realise just how fucked they are and start running the other way. Then its time to HUNT!
---
Get the mace from DM! It's coming out this week and is just as good as warden staff. The mace isn't bad. I tanked with it from 40 to 53, but it will not compare to the DM mace.
---
This made me belly laugh at work lol, have my upvote!
---
I only had a couple RL friends join, they are somewhere around mid 30's and still sort of log on, but it's becoming bigger and bigger breaks between logins, all the time.  I fully expect them to quit long before they even get to 60.
---
Ironically, I enjoy pve servers more. Only on a pvp server cuz of my guild.
---
Do more!!
---
I've always wondered what level Rexxar is, is it ever revealed in later expansions? How strong would he be to fight compared to attackable bosses like Rag/Onyxia
---
Dispel magic??
---
Spam dungeons as a tank/healer.
---
This is why I like feral druid tank. They aren't stupid enough to pull, but if they are then they have enough HP pool to tank for 20 seconds before they die. For trash tank, they are the best.
---
awsome hunter weap tbu
---
If I wasnt allowed to need on shields with my dps shaman I would have hated the game. 
---
There are also plenty of encounters where switching to a shield in a group is the better alternative over "just more damage." More people than just tanks need shields.
---
Ye, only crit and AP.... Warriors and rogues got crit + AP too, BUT also benefits far more from weapon damage. It is like some warrior or rogue stole rhokdelar from them. Hunter main weapon is bow, not swords. At least our hunters don´t have prio on those, so I wouldn´t be mad. New weapon is like new boots or belt for them. Same difference. On the other hand new weapon for a rogue could mean even 50-100dps increase. Hunter gets like +5-10dps max:D
---
I have a guild with about 10 irl friends. 1 has 7 characters level 20-30. Another has one level 26. I just hit 50 playing 1-2 hr a night+ weekend binge. The rest of my friends have been 60 for a couple weeks now and I hardly get to play with them. I hope they don't burn out by the time I get 60.
---
I was so sad when I found out
---
Appreciate the answer, after looking into EU maintenance schedule - Dire Maul will go live on the 16th at 4am.
---
Right??
---
That's what a shit rogue does, an actual good rogue will kill you at full health with all CDs available for you to use. Because that's good means.
---
You either need to stand back and not attack while you use mend pet to keep it alive, OR you learn to kite mobs and do the work yourself.  A dead pet doesn't gain xp so you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Love how the comments are hating on this. It’s a good stat weapon for hunter which is primarily what hunters use melee weapons for.
---
Maybe no warriors or rogues needed/wanted, should it be dusted instead. If it’s a DKO bet, the hunter wastes DKP he/she could have used it n something else. Cause and effect
---
Servers go down at 7PST for an hour. After that, Dire Maul should be live.
---
The way I do solofarm Mara is ahead of time I get a friend or guildie to help me set up a raid with 2 of my chars. Invite a friend, convert to raid, promote friend to asistant, relog alt, whisper friend for invite to raid.  
---
Then I start farming. Once I kill the bosses in Mara I log out on my main, log in on my alt, browse AH for 2 mins, then leader of the raid will swap to me and I reset.  
---
Yes, this can be done faster if you can keep inviting a friend to reset for you, but I like being able to do it alone without having to bother someone else. Also being in a raid does not effect you're farming at all, it's just the easiest way to set it up.
---
Second everything he/she says. Shadow is more than viable for healing dungeons until at least lvl 50. Most early level Holy/disc talents aren’t even all that helpful for dungeon healing, and shadow also gives you some nice added utility (mind flay, silence).
---
Also second the tailoring/skinning suggestion. Tailoring gives you nice gear while levelling and also prepares you to craft BiS chest piece. Skinning is a nice easy way to make gold by just vendoring skins you get from beasts you’re gonna kill anyway. Just don’t make the same initial mistake I made and pick up enchanting, it’s a horrible gold sink while levelling.
---
Which is  3am -&gt; 4am. Yes.
---
None taken. Retail lost me a long time ago and I have no plans to ever go back. The oversimplified yet overcomplicated gameplay does not resonate with me, and I love the classic community. I enjoy the whacky loot and the sense of accomplishment. The fact that your accomplishments are not just listed, but you wear your achievements on you. Classic is kind of everything I wanted, and I don't want it to feel like a chore, I have a day job already. So it's really not retail I long for, just something I think would be refreshing in the long run.
---
This is fantastic!
---
I am doing this mistake all the time. In the heat of a battle it is really difficult to ignore your instincts.
---
Well, they're bad guys.
---
in vanilla people had 100yard nameplate range, now we had it for awhile and then they removed it, either they stick to there "true expierience" or they don't but trust me back in vanilla addons were even stronger then you see now with addons like spy
---
In the expansion after the next one, Gallywix becomes the warchief and nukes Ironforge, starting a genocidal campaign against Alliance. Luckily, Anduin and a few plucky Horde rebels depose him and forgive the rest of the Horde.
---
Sir fapalot?
---
You pop up on the addon when you walk in the 100yd range bubble around the guy using it
---
Dear alliance scum,
---
That Paladin is a moron. Anyone who rages about gear is a moron. 
---
Congrats on the sweet lootz.
---
I had zero intention of playing Classic even though I had played from TBC through Pandaria. A group of my friends, who had never touched WoW, started playing at launch and tried to convince me to join. I play DnD with them so any chance they had to bring up WoW and persuade me was taken. I knew if I started, I’d be sucked back in. After a month, I gave in, rolled a Priest on Krom and started leveling. 
---
I’m now 44 and they all quit before 30. 
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ oh well
---
All classes can do 50-60g an hour with some class knowledge. A lot easier once DM:E comes out. Nothing comes close to the 30g x 5 you can get on a lucky roll in DM:N averaging out on 100g+.
---
Blizzard will have to look into Bijou crocodile farming if they do make DM:N not as goldladen. Bijou farming in ZG was insane as well, however it did not inject raw gold, but trade goods.

---
Golemagg EU? Saw a solo mage run around there when we farmed one for one of our priests last night, took us less then 1 hour so you must have some very bad rng
---
So many people bring this up but this has literally never happened to me in 15 years of playing WoW and most of that on a warlock. and I pvp'd a lot during TBC &amp; WotLK
---
meanwhile im 2 tapping all rtvs
---
The level u get when mining a node?
---
Well if you like healing you came to the right class. Just don't expect to do anything but that once you hit 60.
---
On the road to 60 you are well set with a class that is always requested for dungeons and that can dish out a lot of damage against quest mobs with not too much downtime either. There are people who still believe that Priests don't do damage, but those are just rumors of people who specced Shadow. My full Holy Priest is currently doing an average of 200 dps at level 40 on quest and dungeon mobs, something that made certain Paladins cry already.
---
Rip escape artist
---
Run SM Cath a few times, depending on your mindset towards this or not, keep certain items equipped, need on items you need, don’t equip them, just need on them next time the dungeon comes round. It’s a bit scummy but I ended up with several White Manes hat and necklaces.
---
Sounds like you're doing the right stuff.
---
This is what we in the wowclassic community would call, a dick move
---
That’s what I do also. The healer is the one keeping me alive, so I need a healer with mana.
---
Probably 55-57
---
can confirm i enterd stockades about 2 weeks ago and im still scared
---
Continue questing and gold will floating in...you should be able to buy your mount at level \~45
---
When i first saw this i thought it was about me, about 2 weeks ago my friend(level 31 warlock) was consistently being ganked by alliance. I must have sat in 1k needles for about 3 hours killing every single alliance i saw. If this rings a bell and you remember my name, I am \*not sorry\*
---
just try it
---
Thanks for the tip. Anyway, that means that I know what to do with the money and how to invest it, which I actually don't xD.
---
My understanding is that the additional rage generated by WF is consumed by execute without scaling the damage from execute as it should. For this reason they're better of with the extra agi.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
This is not me lmao, I just found this
---
Dibs!
---
Have not thought about that... And I don't care waiting... :-)
---
The rock elementals in arathi drop greys that vendor for a few silver. Farmed in 2006 to get my mount money.
---
*clap*
---
You need a good amount of damage for the last boss. He not only hits pretty hard in wolf form, he also heals himself up with rejuvenate and casts a DoT manaburn. You need to dispell the poison manaburn on the healer or kick the manaburn + rejuvenate. 
---
A warrior due to plate + shield and resto shaman are recommended. A rogue around T2 can also facetank the last boss.
---
This is something that I recently discovered as a first-time mage player. The dagger+orb  from SM lasts you until the ZF staff, but after that it's very hard for staves to match the stats on MH/OH combos.
---
You can invite him at the end of your run. You can also get an alt into the same group and just log off and swap to the alt. To do this you need someone else to invite your alt to get both your alt and main in the same group.
---
You want to keep your SW:P, PW:S and other rotational skills updated thou. The faster you grind, the faster you get your mount.
---
Mostly worthless as there is the [Dreamweave Circlet](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10041) which is much better.
---
Nope, as a healer I fully endorse this. So long as you wait for me to fully top off before a boss or you don’t do something stupid like overpull then I’m game.
---
Only thing i find irritating is if they pull miles away or LoS me meaning i have to dash at 30% mana to throw off a big heal in time. So tanks - please note your healers position if you’re gonna to pull while we’re drinking.
---
Thankfully nothing but a lot of Tigers on BB, but I was sort of implying Stranglethorn is a rules free sort of place.
---
People know the game.  This isn't anything new.
---
"So that's it, huh? We're some kind of Stockade squad?"
---
Yes. 
---
50 Hunter is the main. Prob could be 60. 
---
22 warrior. 22 priest. 19 Mage. 19 Rogue. 16 Paladin. 14 Warlock. 10 Druid. 
---
Prob work up a shaman at some point here too.
---
Get to play maybe 30min to an hr before work. And then possibly 1-1 1/2 hrs before bed after the kids go to sleep. Sneak a little here or there. Easier to do at lower levels when the quests are more bunched. 
---
Don’t hate yourself over it. All the classes are fun in their own way.
---
Wouldn't you know I was randomly turning in a quest (Yeti Hides) and he happened to have it. Bought it up immediately and went on my way. About an hour later I was turning in another quest and BAM another pattern. Gonna put it on the AH or offer it to some poor soul for vendor price if they are having trouble finding it.
---
Human/Nelf males and all gnomes bring my red mist. Dwarves are bro tier.
---
Doesn't work for me. I get this error on start up - [https://imgur.com/a/8I0LMSN](https://imgur.com/a/8I0LMSN) but does boot past it  
---
After I sign in with Twitch and get to the "Login Character" screen nothing happens once I login/reload. It seems to have trouble as well with my non default installation location. D:\\Battlenet\\World of Warcraft\\\_classic\_  
---
Looks neat. Hopefully I can use it soon!
---
Fun? Engineering is a must if you want to stand a chance in pvp.
---
All hybrid classes can heal everything minus the lvl 60 dungeons. If you want to have a chill time and be invited back to your group, respec before your first Scholomance run.
---
Worst mistake healers make here is impulsively jump up and start healing. Better to keep eating until the last necessary moment to start healing
---
The answer is extremely simple:
---
It doesnt matter, just whatever has the best combined stats
---
2H \[15 Int, 20 spellpower\]
---
1H \[10 Int 10 spellerpower\] + Offhand \[5 int 10 Spellpower\]
---
Yeah sorry by not purchasing skills I meant the non essential ones. Anything part of my core solo rotation gets updated, anything else can wait.
---
Is wasted, I’m assuming they don’t have hit cap
---
Same issue. It’ll neigh when I summon my felsteed but not when I press space. No audio is heard on my girlfriends computer also from my horse
---
We will find out soon, hopefully we get some good content here shortly.
---
Friend hit 35 and has logged on once since... feelsbadman
---
Anyone that is not a total noob knows this.  Just kindly PM the healer letting them know you are just pulling one  or two mobs and will be fine.
---
Ok thanks a lot! Ret rogue rdrood should then be fine for that farm!
---
Horde do have tranquil air though
---
-Goblin- Stormwind Slayer
---
Blizzard give you 5 resets per hour so they expect that people will do this.
---
Was that guy the raid leader? If one person has an id and joins a group that doesnt have one will it just instantly put you all onto theirs, even if he isnt the first person to enter the raid?
---
You shouldn’t even need any “numbers” for that. The only time you should be going arms raid spec is week 1 MC like APES
---
30% additional weapon speed vs sword spec and MS....?
---
Flurry is what makes fury good, not BT.
---
Because it doesn't have a debuff proc and it's still a sword?
---
This early on the Classic raiding I can guarantee that there were rogues or warriors in the raid that needed the weapon. A hunter having it for stats is a joke.
---
Please do
---
Well he got caught vote manipulating the league subreddit a few years back so it kinda makes sense why he'd want to move on
---
Lol yesterday we had a Warlock in Deadmines and I was running Recount and his dmg was like 1/6 of what the other 2 dps had. I have no idea what he was doing back in the caster line but I suspect that mostly drinking.
---
Is there anything different I can do for me to get it earlier? I don’t mind spending the next couple of levels mindlessly grinding certain lucrative mobs or dungeon spamming if it means I get my mount closer to 40.
---
24 priest, tailoring/enchanting skill roughly 100 in both, I'm worried about these professions (specifically enchanting) holding me back money wise, the greens I'm disenchanting now are worth 20-30 silver sometimes, would it be a big hassle to skill up skinning to be level appropriate? am i worrying about it too much? I just bought some of my level 24 spells and i have about 3.5g
---
replacing it fairly quickly is a matter of perspective
---
It's downright scummy.
---
revolutionary. why hasn't anyone thought of this yet.
---
Kodos don’t make a sound or an animation.  At least the 60% ones don’t.
---
Don't let anyone tell you that Shadow is the better spec, they all just don't know the truth.
---
On professions: there is no profession that you must choose as all are mostly worthless at 60. Everything you really need you can get from the AH or other players for a fraction of what it costs to get those professions to 300. If you want to have professions just for the sake of it, Enchanting and Alchemy are popular choices, as they are the probably most required professions at 60. Tailoring is another choice if you want to craft some gear on the way, but that will require some investment during the leveling process as you need a lot of cloth to keep the profession on your level.
---
I use fairy fire on every rogue just to fuck with them and so they can't get on my ass. I also do have moonfire rank 1 to tag mobs, its so muxh fun to use it on hordies just to fuck with them until they realize it does literally no dmg.
---
While fighting a mob, hold m1 button to look around. Also learn where is a dangerous place and where is safe. Caves are very bad for warriors for instance.
---
Been selling HoJ for 100g, so sellruns are def already a thing, not sure about the 400g price point though, think that's a bit steep atm.
---
Of course there will always be one or two "best" build. But I find way more fun to just find the build nobody plays that is still somehow playable.
---
I avoid like the plague the official frost mage build that everybody got for example.
---
I agree that for PvE, you will have way less room to experiment, but for PvP you can go crazy in your builds
---
The amount of mis-information in this thread is really shocking. Why would blizzard break something none of you even understand? 
---
If I were a blizz employee looking at this thread I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry.
---
I bet you're a blast at parties
---
To everyone, this has nothing to do with me. I just though the reply to the post was amazing. This noobhunter is pretty scary though, he PM'd me. Not sure how he's tracking all this down. Beware of the noobhunter!
---
What ever you say kiddie boy. I also never worked  in fast food sorry to say. And I just got off work thank you very much. And no I don’t take games very seriously.
---
Almost like there's other factors at play in why people choose servers that aren't the server type and are more social (i.e., where friends are playing).
---
It's a nice gesture but I tend to tell people to just go ahead and pull. A healer can reg another 30-50% while the tank pulls and positions the mobs.
---
I downloaded Spy a few weeks ago after looking for something to track KOS. Now I’m spoiled by knowing there is a raid about to head in to UBRS so I’m never caught unaware.
---
Pisses me off that he only has 2 WoW videos, these are great
---
So punish thousand and thousands of players because a few make mistakes? Use a auction house addons yourself. Posting is easier too
---
Can’t vendor the ring because it’s unique. Can’t even pick it up :)
---
I use Luna Unit Frames - the raid frames are directly above my action bars in a rather small scale. Character, Target, etc are directly above that. Small dispell raid frames from Decursive next to the frames. Doesn't take that much space all in all.
---
Please don't listen to this guy :D Get a mana bar wa/addon instead please :D
---
I'm level 32 and no problem so far
---
Who said anything about game rules or ToS? I am talking about your morals. Better to say, the lack of.
---
It is always interesting to see how people who engage in shitty behavior find excuses for it.
---
I'd swap warlock and shadow priests, since warlock summoning are all about contracts and what not, seems more "Lawful" evil to me.
---
Shadow priests better represent chaos.
---
That’s because private servers nerf DM so it doesn’t mess up the economy. Blizzard doesn’t know this so yes DM will have black lotus.
---
You cant. You will be oom 30s into the battle. 
---
Just heal and play 31/0/20 or 30/0/21.
---
Manatide kinda useless since your prob going for melee group
---
When you're out of quests just go grind mobs osmewhere that gives rep for something. One way or antoher you'll need to farm for that rep. Why not do it while getting exp for 60?
---
Dire Maul would have an added E (east), W (west), N(north) or T(tribute). DM without anything still means Deadmines as it did long time ago.
---
Reaching bis in the current state of the game is very possible if you are in a well organised raid guild.
---
Hey which one of them drops that? Is it the postman?
---
Sounded like a wonderful group clearly it was your fault because the tank is always right or something
---
The manaburn can be negated by using the pillars for LoS. Have no issues with it as a priest healing warriors for jumpruns.
---
Are you alliance?
---
Yep I have also stated that so I don't need to be told again. If you read again, I'm asking how it's fair for people who do fuck up, do not have the time to fix this issue because of this addon.
---
That's why dkp sucks
---
I saw more warriors/rogues with MC ranged weapons, than hunters with an epic melee weapon (that's the first).
---
That's the perfect itme to run out. You can farm those stones for the argent dawn rep that you'll need later anyway.
---
Can't imagine thinking someone is an asshole for rolling on an item they need, especially in some non-important level 40 dungeon. You guys are all in for a shock when you hit 60. I don't think this game is for you.
---
What? The addon is definitely usable both ways and claiming anything else is flat out silly. Let me show you an example: 
---
Player A wants to kill player B (or just kill random players). Player A moves around the zone mounted and without doing any actions, while player B is actively minding his/her own business, questing or whatever. Which person do you think is going to benefit from the addon in such a scenario?
---
Just look at the mana bars of your party members before pulling. If the healer is below 30% mana and isn't sitting try not to get them into combat.
---
Killed this dude today, dropped two greens, big disappoint :p
---
Cool thanks :)
---
Nah if you are just running around not casting anything you won't appear on the addon. It reads the combat log.
---
Used to be healer and was annoyed when the tank pulled too fast. Now in classic I am playing tank and I always used to be very generous with letting the healer reg. But the issue is that there are certain, unpatient group members who will just pull if I wait too long. And if I dont pull myself tanking gets much harder. Therefore I usually pull when healer is at about 80% mana (except for fights were I know he will need all the mana).
---
&gt;thinking there's still hidden locations in a 15 year old game
---
Ah you pure soul
---
All my mates still playing.
---
Bind a macro so that you pickpocket every humanoid you fight! I’m at 37 and have 60g and spent some on crap as well. So that’s pretty good I think?
---
I'm not asking for punishment to those players. I'm asking for a fair and even advantage point for players not using it. Shouldn't I be given at least a few seconds to realise a mistake before it's been taken advantage of by those with a botting addon?
---
I farmed 140-ish on behalf of a guildie. I got one azerothian and one blue sapphire. I felt cheated.
---
It’s a game mate, don’t know why you’re getting shitty with me? OP asked a question and I provided him with an answer, he said ASAP and that is a way, he could also ninja all the items if he wanted too, don’t get upset because you don’t like the answer.
---
Please read. I am not arguing for the effectiveness as a dps, i’m asking simply, how can i get a resto shaman who raids, geared for pvp, as that is ultimately my end goal.
---
How's it compare to BRD?
---
It is a "red" debuff, so nothing should work, I am amazed the totem does.
---
If you're referring to Esotericx's report, you've misunderstood. The deal is that execute takes your rage to 0 with a notable delay, and any rage gained during this delay does not affect its damage, hence being just lost rage. In particular, if execute procs WF, you will lose the rage gained by any WF hits. This does not mean that WF lowers your execute DPS, since you're still getting a free hit. It does mean that WF might make your normal rotation deal more DPS than execute spam, since your normal rotation is able to utilise the extra rage and convert it into damage.
---
From Discord:
---
&gt;Esotericx#4930: not sure if anyone has said anything yet, but batching is causing windfury on execute only to dump the rage into the execute, but it doesnt increase the executes damage - thus the rage goes to the abyss. For instance if you execute all ur rage from 50 to 0 and u get a windfury proc on the execute, the rage dumps into the previous execute without increasing the dmg, so if your windfury crit for 1k on top of an execute you cant keep executing - the rage disappears
---
Do green mobs instead of yellow ones. They have lower aggro-radius and even if they do aggro, it's much more survivable. Yes they give less XP per kill but the increase in safety and killspeed make up for it in my opinion.
---
It was me, 2 brothers, and my dad that played, and we had 2 accounts between the four of us. It’s cheaper than buying the flashy new console every 4 years.
---
That's the great thing about druids. Weapons are pure stat sticks. You don't need to care about skills, weapon dmg or speed.
---
The only downside is that weapon procs don't work in feral forms.
---
i was having this problem with my mounts footsteps last night. I just closed the game and re-launched and it was fine after
---
I tried to explain and they did not understand so yeah I don't bother anymore. They're all happy with a one shot every 5 days.
---
As a priest myself that was at about 40g at 35. I did nonstop SM spam till about level 41 and by then had enough gold with vendoring greys and anything else I picked up. In armory there are two small chest (an armor cache and a weapon cache) in the halls right after the courtyard. They are always there and always have greys ranging from 30s to a gold vendoring prices.
---
true, I had alliance literally running against me and Spy didn't register him until like 40 yards away when I was just about to mouseover him anyway.
---
What do you need them to do?
---
Looking for French raiding guild on Herod Alliance side, hit me up 👍
---
Depends on range and the damage being taken, if the tanks hp is going down like a rocket you need to move asap, but that could just be a bad pull.
---
I often don't move until either my mana is 70/80% or I need to heal asap, some groups take the piss though and just keep running and pulling, los and range do matter
---
This happened last night to me. Tank ran off into the sunset to take on 2 mob groups at once. Healer dropped everything and ran as fast as possible and saved the tank with about 10% health left and only a third of the mobs down. I agree that a good tank can pull a few while we break but I also agree that bad tanks need to turn it down from 11.
---
DME 2boss farm as warrior + healer is the best source. You get 15 shards an hour split between 2 along with other valuables. groups of warrior + healer will be selling shards in 20 stacks enough for the CC events
---
Wtf? Rank 10 and even 11 is doable and you get great rewards there so what's up with this all or nothing attitude?
---
Eh, I think that's fine. 
---
Just like if I'm tanking I will be rolling on sweet 2handers, because I'm not tanking out in world for regular mobs. I see no problem. That and it's SM, the loot will be obsolete in a few lvls anyways.
---
&gt; it simply allows you to pay less attention to your surroundings and be fine (except when they dont use abilities, then its your fault for relying too much on the addon)
---
This is the main issue I have with the addon. It allows you to completely doze off in your own thoughts and tunnelvision doing whatever, since this addon is likely going to be ready to bail you out of not having any situational awareness.
---
Youre right. If HS is queued up your OH can't miss (it still can glance etc.). After the OH swing, you cancel HS (if you don't have &gt;70 rage pooled)
---
I enjoyed killing mages 3 levels above me while questing. Makes you feel comfy.
---
Fights in raids are currently pretty short, hence you can go cool specs like Power Infusion.
---
Well that's better for sure, yes. But getting mad because I didnt read a message that didnt appear on my screen until my grenade was in the air doesn't help...
---
Nice
---
That makes sense.
---
I had a tank going this yesterday. A lvl 44 fury warrior in Uldaman who insisted in using double swords because it dealt more damage.
---
As a lvl 40 priest, needless to say, it was an unpleasant run.
---
And most of the horde locks are ud so its literally costin them nothing
---
You can farm frost runes later in naxx. Otherwise just start leveling a hunter so you can farm tribute runs, classic ain't going anywhere
---
Nope.
---
&gt; That's why dkp sucks
---
Most of the time when I see silly loot decisions, its due to pug MC runs with open rolls for any main spec pieces. Lets lot of people win stuff a LC wouldn't give them if they just get lucky.
---
R
---
Waiting for confirmation before rolling.
---
I had this happen me too, luckily I ran a lot with my Shaman friend, but even then we got screwed by mobs spawning around us.
---
It's not a botting addon, you have to buyout the item yourself when the alarm rings
---
&gt; It’s a game mate 
---
Interestingly enough, you 'forgot' those other guys in the instances you run with, are people.
---
&gt; don’t get upset because you don’t like the answer. 
---
I am not upset not even the slightest, as I don't have to suffer your persona in or out of a game. However, you are upset because you are called on your shitty practice.
---
If he’s going down like a rocket and your mana isn’t where it needs to be to complete the fight, still the worst mistake you can make is to join the fight. Let him die and stay safe so you can res.
---
49 Ret here. So I know the feeling. 
---
Rets rely a lot their 2 hander top end damage. 
---
Ravenger is definitely not great at level 49. Try hard to get a new one, dungeons or even the AH. Will be with it for the last 10 levels. I recently did and noticed an insane difference.
---
As a TSM user, I know how fast good deals go. There were times when I saw an item appear, I click buyout immediately and it's already gone. Saw a Bow of Searing Arrows posted for 62 silver.
---
But yeah, it's definitely due to your mistake, lag has nothing to do with it if you put the gold price into the silver category. You made a mistake, learn from it and move on. There are many similar mistakes you can make in WoW and in life, and you can't really expect to always be able to fix them without any problems.
---
I’m not gonna get in to a whole political debate here, but I don’t think it’s “overreacting “ leaving Blizzard games after the recent incidents these past weeks. 🤔
---
What class are you?
---
Correct. But I'm unsure how it would work if someone (player or NPC) actually targeted you and used an ability. I assume that would make you visible through the addon.
---
XD
---
But have you confirmed it for classic wow. Cause "should be" and "is" are different things. Will be nice to find out if there is but you shouldnt put out videos before you can confirm. That's disingenuous
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
He posted a Mario kart 64 video a few weeks ago that is absolutely gold. Would recommend to anyone.
---
Damn how much they go for? On Dreadmist they go for about 40g.
---
Oh didn't know that sorry
---
I would think so as well, but I've been in a few situations where I couldn't find an arrow vendor, but there was a mailbox. Darkshire was one of the places I believe. Granted, I could've just overlooked the vendor, but I desperately combed that damn place for a vendor and couldn't find one.

Low tier username
---
Flip lock and shadow priest. Player warlocks aren't crazy. They are more like magical scientists akin to mages who are more prone to using and practicing darker magic.
---
Shadow priests are worshipers of an all consuming entropic ocean of whispering magical nothingness that drives mortals to complete insanity.
---
Leatrix or ezdismount
---
Depending on server we are talking 500-1000g for the reputation. Somewhere in that ballpark.
---
Welp, I guess this is as good an excuse as any to level fishing...
---
Personally i need a swing timer to see how long i can leave HS queued up before my MH strikes again. This gets more complicated if your MH and OH Weapons have awkward swingspeeds.
---
You press the Macro and leave HS queued after your MH swing, till your OH swings, and then cancel it if you don't have a massive ragepool.
---
Luffa only removes 1 bleed not the whole stack last time i tried.
---
Oh no I’m not upset. I make a lot of gold now. :)
---
It is certainly within your right. I would just like to know beforehand so I don't invite you.
---
I skipped blasted lands and still hit 60 without doing WPL/EPL yet
---
Hi all 44 Warlock here.
---
Currently on a drain tanking build, looking at starting to gear up for raiding and end-game stuff.
---
Most guide say stat priority should always be +shadow dmg/spell dmg.
---
Curios as to what shadow dmg actually increases, I've read about the co-efficient rule and that +10 shadow doesn't necessarily mean +10 shadow. But does it increase drain life's dmg? Corruption? Shadow dmg wands? Or is it just shadow bolt?
---
Ty
---
Lok'Delar is the staff and it's not bis. Better off sticking with Peacemaker from Strat UD.
---
Though Brutality Blade/Core Hound Tooth are regarded as bis melee slots for a Hunter. One would hope the Hunter didn't get it over any melees, though.
---
Is realm time of any importance? If so, what, obviously?
---
thanks, that's what i was thinking, I don't really want to sit around a city trying to sell enchants anyway, i'd have more fun grinding for gold.
---
Fair enough
---
grats to whoever bought those lol
---
Could you not just run a background script or something to hit print screen however often your wanting? Would that still be a tos issue since it's not actually automating anything gameplay wise?
---
and the real warriors tanks can see all the arm/fury warriors tank-wannabe need on all their stuff.
---
This is stupid
---
Not sure why everyone responding with irrelevant info to you.
---
It's just looking at your combat log. If an enemy player performs and action that your combat log picks up it alerts you of that players presence nearby. 
---
You can target them based on their name in the combat log. It will also alert you if a rogue or druid uses stealth.
---
That was deliberate
---
What movie is caption from?
---
I find myself saying "fuck this game" multiple times a day, yet I keep logging in. 
---
Stupid shit like doing dungeon runs and gear not dropping for anybody of any use. Or when tanking lower level instances for my guildies and that Ravager only wants to proc when there is 1 mob left. 
---
However, I am very slowly regretting rolling on a pvp server, I didn't really account for how populated things would be... It's almost not fun anymore, and that part actually is becoming infuriating.
---
When you install Diablo 2 and LOD, you see an image of the act 2 undead and an Amazon. The art style here reminds me of that
---
I had played from the end of vanilla through start of Cata.  I came back towards the end of Legion and was pleasantly surprised to see my old guild there with some of the core players still at it.   
---
For classic they wanted to stay horde and I wanted to give Alliance a try.  So I purposely rolled on a different server just in case I wanted to go back Horde I'd have the option of playing with them.
---
As it stands now, my main is 48 and I have a smattering of alts.  I also run a small guild of a couple dozen folks I've met while tanking my way through the levels.
---
I still post on my old guild's discord and so far one of them has rolled an ally on my server to join my guild.  In a way we are still having fun in this game together but we've all expanded the people we play with.
---
Then they tell you you're going oom on 3 mob pulls, spamming flash heal and demand you be kicked. Happened to me last night in Strat
---
VC on Malganis too
---
Now with DM around the corner, AR is quite abit better than Dreadforge. 31 higher top end damage, 120 health and 62AP vs 1% crit and 30 AP.
---
In a PvP setting AR will be a lot better and only trumped by Raggi weapons which can be hard to come by.
---
Counterspell isnt a silence, it's an interrupt right? 
---
You cant interrupt those
---
Only about 3-4 people have dropped form the guild of about 60 people that we (re)formed from vanilla.
---
Exactly, if you have a competent tank that knows that the next pull he doesn't need a heal for like 10-15s it's fine to pull while the healer is drinking. And yes you are right when you are saying that it's stupid that the healer stops drinking if you do one of these small pulls. In a dungeon (I always guild group) I maybe ask the tank once or twice to stop for me cause I know the next pull is big and I have low mana.
---
Now I would always tell any tank that is pugging, to see what the healer is doing and testing out the waters to see if he has a brain as well.
---
You can also do /equipitem [worn:shield] &lt;2h item ID&gt; so that it only changes if you are wearing a shield. This is also useful for a toggle macro:  
---
/equipslot 16 [noworn:shield] 1h weapon  
---
/equipslot 17 [noworn:shield] Shield  
---
/eq [worn:shield] 2h weapon
---
Nobody raids as elemental DPS, so elemental gear can be obtained as resto. It's all off-spec, basically. Raid as a healer and tell your guild that you're trying to gear for ele PvP. Unless it's a very weird guild, there'll be no mainspec ele shaman who gets priority over you. Many of the items are also things you can easily stake claim to as resto without even being something strictly for PvP.
---
In this tier, you pretty much want the following items:
---
Earthfury Gauntlets  
---
Earthfury Vestments  
---
Leggings of Ten Storms  
---
Helmet of Ten Storms  
---
Deep Earth Spaulders  
---
Malistar's Defender  
---
Aurastone Hammer  
---
Enlightened Choker (optional, very small upgrade over blues)  
---
Of those items, only the shoulders are exclusively an elemental item. All the rest is stuff that you can just say you want as resto. Some of it isn't *good* for resto, but it's not like anyone's gonna tell you that you can't bid/roll/ask for your class' tier set.
---
Now a movie based on the Defias Brotherhood would be amazing.
---
And then swap Shamans and Shadow Priests and it's finally perfect.
---
If you are a arm warrior and you are the damage dealer in the group, there is no reason you could need on a shield.
---
For the same reason, a prot warrior who is the tank of the group have no reason to need on the beautiful two handed axe you want.
---
At 10% health Golemagg will also start casting earthquake doing damage to all around him and begin attacking much faster.
---
Just found this on wowwiki so my memory isnt completly bad, i think the whole room started shaking aswell when he did it. Remember it hurt really bad as i was a rogue back then, and had to go out sometimes and ranged him instead if i didnt want to die
---
ah didn't see the guard...  
---
the guard was there litterly for 1 sec... my bad..... i stand corrected
---
So, with 5 weapon skill and 6% hit from gear vs. +3 level boss (8% miss):
---
8% (boss) - 1% (from +5 weapskill itself) - 6% (gear, with no ignore mechanic in play) = 1% miss
---
What am I missing here?
---
dw, gnomes have a spot on the list as well.
---
LVL 47 priest have found alot of healing+ gear but have traded off some spirit and int by equipping it. Is the healing+ greater in most instances?
---

To me, Rogues are assassins. They should be small and unobtrusive.
---
I always think male Human/Orc Rogues look completely ridiculous.
---
Did every dungeon at least once for the quests. Ran ZF and BRD twice. I did almost every quest I could including group quests and long chains that go through multiple zones. I only skipped quests that were a complete waste of time because of low drop rates or camped spawns like the blasted lands quests.
---
I was playing my level 2 druid the other day, and for about 6 mobs in a row, they dropped double the loot, like 2 broken tusks, 2 frayed gloves, I remember filling my bags running back to sell and by then it wasn't dropping double loot anymore. I mean, it didn't really matter because it was the starting zone, but I thought it was an interesting bug.
---
Do you have to hit the macro twice to trigger the /stopcasting part?
---
If it is to any comfort to anybody, I have no problem pointing out that it is scummy, and shouldn't be encouraged.
---
then they sacrifice windfury tho. not worth
---
Yep, literally the only thing that results from posts like this. Just got the addon a ton more downloads.. good job I guess for something you supposedly hate.
---
I agree it shouldn't be something people can do, but complaining here will do exactly nothing.
---
You'd be able to sell tons of stuff to afford a mount more easily, for one.
---
Yeah I agree and addons are great and they do give people a much better gaming experience overall. But where is the line between making it great for one person and absolute hell against another? This is how I am feeling right now. Where is the line between making it fully run off life enhancing addons and actually just playing the game for yourself. At this point, even having the addon would not be beneficial to me in this situation. I still wouldn't have the time to sort out my mistakes. I understand TSM gives people a massive advantage, but the advantage AGAINST other players is horrible to play against. They should not be this good for one player and this detrimental for another.
---
I reply because this is my biggest reddit post yet. I reply to almost all comments on it. Especially ones where I feel an outside observer looking in will see what I say and be like 'yeah hes right. brainzor777 is being an idiot lol'.
---
This happened to me.  I, as a 60 warrior, was running a childhood friend through with another childhood friend who was boxxing two 60 fire mages.
---
The mages hit Whitemane with a double pyroblast so hard that she didn't even get to cast the rez and just died.
---
What a comment
---
So many assumptions.
---
The guy whispering me was another 60.
---
I help all warriors with their burning charms and warlocks with their quest.
---
Nice assumptions though, kid.
---
The STV crystal vein basilisks got me there on a server with a similar economy. Ppl want thick leather for rep, and they drop high value greys.
---
:'(
---
Oh yeah, it got to be real trash man. They were trying to compete with EQ and Diablo and just completely ruined the game.
---
QED
---
Yes, the yare. On average BRE and Spinal Reaper drop every 20th week of raiding. Have up to 10 warriors be eligible to bid on them as they are pretty much PvP only and you have a perfect storm of never acquiring such a weapon until AV TuF or R14 or Ashkandi.
---
So, in the middle of Vanilla. Me and a few friends rerolled onto a newly opened realm. Things vent on and we managed to get into the “second” best guild in MC and got BWL down a few months after just after AQ40 was released. It took us a several weeks of raiding AQ40 just to get to Huhuran and a few weeks past that to kill her. Meanwhile there are was this feeling that everyone hated AQ40 and the damn bugs. Trash was worse, loot, as we understood it back then was mostly worse and none like the astethics of it. So we started to struggle to get people to log for raids and at a certain point TBC info came out about raidsize and all the guild split into 2. 
---
The part I joined did ok during TBC and killed Illidan just before wotlk. However people stopped playing and what was a 25 man raiding guild in TBC, slowly over time went on to be a 10 man guild in wotlk. I would claim that the death for us was when we killed Lich King. Because that had been our goal since we started wow pretty much. Everything after that just felt worse. I ended atop playing wow in early Cata.
---
Always and forever
---
Had skinning in STV at your level and spent a few levels killing everything and skinning it and vendoring the rest
---
wat
---
The two last bosses in cathedral are 42.
---
Are [Fletcher's Gloves](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7348/fletchers-gloves) \+1% crit -1% parry good for leveling as a hunter? I wasn't sure how much crit matters at lower levels or at what point they should be replaced.
---
Meh. I would probably have stuck better if everyone I knew that played didn't literally pick a different server from eachother. I am at 4 18+s now. I've lost the will to keep going as I've done the same 1-15 on every single class but priest.
---
I still play but I am infusing a lot of other games, including retail, into my play time now.
---
Well.. actually rogue weapons are the most important piece you can have. And you can solo the quest to get outlaw saber :)
---
warrior and mage need to switch. 
---
there are so many chaotic warriors and lawful warriors in warcraft lore. pretty hard to objectively say they are lawful.
---
mages strike me more as neutral because they don’t really care what is happening they usually just want to focus on magic. at the same time many powerful mages are part of the government so lawful makes sense for them as well, just not really for warriors.
---
At this point, you're just talking shit to try and convince people. Addons like Spy have literally existed for at least 14 years, it's not going away no matter how much you complain about it.
---
Yes you are !  
---
What dont you understand about Need and Greed ?  
---
You dont Need the item, you Greed it ?!, right ?  
---
The only thing i see you doing in this post is trying to justify yourself and/or shieft the blame.  
---
In the end, you are still the dickhead.
---
Am I the only one who thinks this looks like bug abuse? Is it not a bug? What's going on here? Like, I understand it, but there's no way that's intentional
---
3 of us entered, only I remain. One other is very very tentatively holding on there. He barely ever plays but insists he's continuing.
---
The other I always know. He starts playing other games and says he's still going, but never does. So he's gone.
---
Sucks too, last week they were still all gung-ho so I dropped like 500g buying one a krol blade and the other a kang (both could use them within a few levels) to goad them into leveling harder. Backfire.
---
Last time we went there to grind for our priest with Eye of divinity it dropped from 5th mob. We thought it would be good idea to keep going and get another one for gbank
---
After 2h we got nothing
---
I believe they call it rng
---
Then there will be a ton of cloth / leather / mail items for you with either +healing or +spell/healing. If you are lucky you might end up quite decked out at 60.
---
They might help you. They just need to get approval from China first.
---
he wasn't tanking the instance and isn't tank spec, no reason to need a shield and take it from the guy who is actually tanking.
---
Or Murloc *heads*. How good of condition does one need a Murloc head to be?
---
I don't even see the point. Either you get ganked and have to start over, or you never get ganked in which case it's the same as playing on PVE. I suppose a rogue has a bit of an edge since he can actually escape or even win a 1v1, but any other class in whites/greys is going to get smoked.
---
Yup he did this on private servers and it hit hard. But no he never does it in Classic. Bosses in Classic use their abilities far less often compared to private servers.
---
I feel like it enhances world PVP for me, specially the part where i can add a player on a KOS list and track my losses / victories against enemy players
---
THESE ARE SO DAMN GOOD!
---
What are the 15 points in prot for this?
---
I was running ZF with a fellow hunter (who was over level for it by a large margin) who kept pulling threat from the tank. I had to tell him that FD drops his aggro...but he kept just pulling aggro and spamming Wing Clip.
---
Threat management used to be nearly an "art form", especially if you came from games like FFXI.
---
If they were going to do that though they would have done it years ago. Addons like Spy have been around for a very, very long time.
---
clearly inbred
---
In addition to the comments, you can go to wago.io and look for pre-made weakaura setups for virtually everything you could need in game.  Copy the string from website, paste to import box in game and done.  Much quicker and easier than learning how to program your own weakauras if you’re not interested in that.
---
Except hes not. It still exists and thats all it does.
---
U can "/target X"
---
It’s far better for Warriors. For rogues it’s a slight upgrade over Mirah’s Song.
---
It will swing itself. Wherever you use it, off-hand or main-hand. It is just like another strike.
---
I feel like complaining about an addon that removes your main advantage in the game is pretty fair.
---
Don't see it going anywhere though.
---
Wtf, arcanes dropped to 30g on my server. I aint even bothering to auc them anymore. I have 15 of them just sitting on me waiting until they go 40+g again. People are nuts, my server doesn't even have layers anymore and it's OBNOXIOUS farming anything in the world anymore. I'll be damned if i let them go for that cheap with how long it takes to get them now. You see a rich vein on my server and no matter where it is, it's you and 5 others rushing head long at it.
---
Of course i did. you can see Sword Specialization procs above the Thrash Blade's procs in Recount.
---
You can if you have any standards for yourself or dont like pushing a boulder up hill for no reason.
---
What does a mana bar addon have anything to do with what I said?
---
&gt;to bait other high levels to come out and fight.
---
Must be different on other servers, because every experience I've seen, is they turn and run the second a fair fight shows up.
---
&gt; Also, the thrill when your taget knows you are coming
---
You're a real sicko. I bet you enjoy the hunt, I bet it gets your blood boiling. I bet you get off to the smell of fear as your mark pleads with the gods that you're going after someone else.

^^^All ^^^of ^^^that ^^^is ^^^/s ^^^incase ^^^it ^^^wasn't ^^^obvious.
---
What started everything for me was this: Me and a friend was questing in Desolace in the Thunder Axe Fortress (place with cultist orcs etc). We are 2 mages (no, we weren't previously hunters, we've played mages for 15 years) and we saw 2 dwarf rogues doing the escort quest. We thought it would be a good idea to let them just finish the quest peacefully since it sucks to get your quest failed because of a gank. 30 seconds later, when they've finished their quest, the ambush US and kill us, then spend WAY too long at our corpses trying to kill us again and again. We killed them a few times as well but they were pretty pimped out with good gear and engineering so an ambush took away \~90% of our full hp. After a few days we ran into them in STV again and they spent over an hour making our lives miserable. After that, I have no sympathy for any dwarves out there. As soon as I see one, I start slamming on the keyboard and I've killed a ton by now.
---
Ive had the opposite effect. Friends I would of never thought would ever play any variation of wow are all playing together. They are pretty bad at the game but its still been fun
---
The only neat thing about Spy is the KOS list and that it tracks wins/losees against players imo
---
Maybe wait a week, and put in another ticket to see if you get the same response.  If they decline again, I'd just make peace with your mistake and move on.
---
You would have to change the API, not make a rule.
---
Never know, you could die before the year is out
---
You can choose to have bigger unitframes for 15 vs. 40 if you desire. I think that is the intent.
---
A thing about classic is your reputation matters.
---
If it gets noticed you're a ninja looter, then come Blackrock you'll spend a lot of time in LFG.
---
Ive never used TSM and dont know how it works. Here's my 2 cents lol: 
---
If the add on detects items listed cheaper than they should be and buys them and the whole process is autonomous then 100% that shouldn't be allowed. Human error shouldn't be instantaneously punished by machine. 
---
But if its players using an add on to refine search results and continuously refreshing and buying you out quickly by clicking the button themselves then it's fine. In this scenario you fucked up xD
---
Group finder probably
---
It might be possible you auto ran right into the boat, got stuck on it, and it pushed you over to the other continent.
---
I play an Orc. Am level 53.

Dire Maul: What is the lowest level a PUG group can do it?

The xp I got from farming them was no more valuable than the xp I got grinding monstrous bats and frenzied dogs in EPL at 58, which weren’t being farmed dry.
---
Not going, that's actually how wands work. They don't benefit from any stats at all except your ranged crit chance.
---
Every one of them, just like I predicted
---
This is basically what wall hacks are in FPS games. How the hell is this a thing?
---
I was in a mid level dungeon run yesterday, and watched the warlock and mage just ripping mobs off the tank left and right. I kept thinking, "the tank is going to say something, right? Why does no one care about this horrendous threat management...?" Around the time I was getting blamed for pulls that were not agroing me (which you can see if no one attacks back by watching who gets swarmed) and the tank thinking it was just business as usual with the extra mage/warlock tanking skills I just gave up and quietly powered through the run. /shrug
---
Both replies have got it right
---
Wow someone just learned what the word speculation means.
---
&gt; are there even female ogres?
---
I see you are man of culture as well
---
SICK!!
---
That's not House, but whatever you like :-)
---
I'm sorry I didn't mention he was an orc.
---
They should stealth out of range :D best rogues will figure out the combat log range and when they see someone they want to gank, they run out of range and stealth there :D
---
Okay. So joe knows susie and jerry. Jerry knows susie liz and mike. Susie knows Jerry, mike, john, and jerod.
---
Liz and mike pick Sulfuras to be with 4 other people they know.
---
John picks old blanchy to be with 2o ther people he knows.
---
Jerod picks Herod to be with 7 other people she knows.
---
Susie decides to go Herod to play with Jerod.
---
Jerry decides to go Sulfuras to hang with the two they know.
---
Where does Joe go? I guess Joe makes characters on both Suie and Jerry's servers. But now joe is only level 32 on both while Susie and Jerry are over 45.

:(
---
People have started calling out others who reserve loot.
---
The amount of players who try to wrongly justify the actions by saying "Just don't join their groups" are dwindling and hopefully we can stamp it out all together.
---
This only proves that the people writing these things, have the intellectual maturity of a child
---
Not without completely breaking other, less controversial addons.
---
Or everything since beating the Legion at the end of Warcraft 3
---
That doesn't mean every game they both have are competing with each other.
---
Yes and no.
---
No, you dont have to be 60 to heal it. Just like you can clear Molten Core pre-60.
---
Yes, you have to be 60 because good luck getting groups that allow a non-60 to get in.
---
They thought they did?
---
Whichever looks best. I love me a sword + oh. And most staves in classic look like shit. So Mh+OH for me. 
---
Im even using the sword from BRD with like 8 spell dmg. Less than the SM dagger and alot less than witchblade but it looks way better. A +6 dmg difference isnt gonna make much difference but the aesthetics of a cool looking sword is way more important :) 
---
And it has 8 stam more for pvp :)
---
Correct
---
Yeah as a filthy casual I get the pvp server thing, I am clearly going to be exactly around 48 when p2 hits so I'll be in the thick of it. What I find strange is how there is no realm transfer offered from my, rather popular realm to a Pve server, I only have the choice of 5 pvp servers to go to.
---
None, more joining actually
---
Wouldnt the Burning Legion be lawful evil, since they act this way out of a strict conviction and for a higher purpose?
---
They arent just randomly invading worlds to kill everything just for the fun of it or because they had a bad day.  In their minds they believe they are doing good (irrelevant of wether they're wrong), as their plan is to stop or prevent the old gods from corrupting everything.
---
I loved Karazahn.
---
But WotLK brought me what I loved the most. FrostDK.
---
I mean, you’re either grinding these over-farmed mobs in BL or grinding something more plentiful and profitable at 58? The choice is clear.
---
KOS should also probably get banned. You can add a rogue in there after he's killed you and it'll warn you if he's anywhere nearby(probably 100 yards at least like Spy) doesn't matter if they are stealthed.
---
A good chunk of the vanilla guild resurrected for this. I do have a few that played for a bit and fell off, but a good chunk are still trucking, raiding, dinging 60, with kids and a job and the whole nine. There will probably be a chunk that falls off after the 3 month subscription expires. I bet the bunch that fell off only signed up for the 1 month, but us with jobs / kids / etc, signed up for 3 because we knew we'd take longer.
---
I was joking.
---
Just heal instances
---
Just shield him at 1% I love scaring the shit out of my tanks
---
Read some of the comments I revieved in yesterday's thread around that. Tl;Dr - wait until 60
---
None, my one friend that's gonna play still doesn't have the time lol
---
I always play that gearuprade is over about money stash
---
Ok, gotcha. So basically yes, my BT will not hit as hard as MS, but it doesn't matter, flurry is just that good. Thanks for clarifying that, flurry is hard to make up when I think about it.
---
Yes if a player is just walking by not doing anything, it will not detect
---
I'd be okay with fly hacks coming back.
---
This, and Darkshire, are my favorites so far! Awesome work!
---
*YOU'VE JUST MADE AN ENEMY FOR LIFE*
---
This is untrue and misleading 
---
You should look into the threat that generates from the on mana/hp gain proc from seal of wisdom/light, even blessings generate a ton themselves. 
---
Damage is not always the best sustained threat for paladins.
---
Where is Misha?
---
Don't call us plucky...we don't know what it means!
---
In it's current form yes and nobody has a problem with it. 
---
He used the word 'was' as in past tense. The LFG addon that was in the past did much more than just read the combat log.
---
Stockaids
---
To echo the other comments, no point to collecting enhance gear unless you plan to spec into it. Keep getting the caster gear (+hit / +crit / +dmg) and just roll with it. I actually find that I kill shit faster as resto with my caster gear than I ever did leveling as enhance.
---
As they should otherwise it’s an unfair advantage...
---
I use this Addon and I also think it should be banned
---
The amount of misinformation in this thread from the OP is fucking mint.
---
Just use the damn addon then... or just get over it. It's really not that big of a fucking deal, it's just the auction house.
---
you wanna tell me you react to every notification?
---
In zones like STV, Desolace, Hillsbrad I had at least 5 ppl "nearby" who I didnt give a f about, its working the way you described only for KOS list because you are cautious around them or want to engage them
---
Exactly this. I can kill 4 mobs in a farming spot at lvl 58 in the time it takes to kill 1-2 in BL. Plus they drop higher value leather and greys.
---
This deviates from your question but I’ve yet to convince anyone to play it with me lol :’(
---
Back in the day it was me and my brother mostly but he’s married with 4 kids. Barely has time for himself anymore. 
---
I’ve met some pretty awesome people to play with almost every night I’ve played though. In a guild that’s very social and pretty much all the random people I’ve grouped with to quest or run dungeons has been super cool.
---
That scale has them as worthless since they don't contribute to damage.  Obviously, that's not accurate in pvp or pve.
---
You are given a fair advantage. You have every right to use an auction house addon as well.
---
You have a virtually infinite amount of time to post your items for the correct price. They can't buy your stuff until you post it. You technically have all the power, right up until you post.
---
Also for what it's worth, go get an AH addon. Iirc most of them have a warning system that prevents you from posting stuff too low or lower than vendor price.
---
Why is there an ogre
---
Yup, just don't heal warlocks much and they'll take care of it themselves
---
Yeah sorry that’s actually what I meant. So are raid bosses ?? Level in classic or are they 63?
---
I lol irl
---
Thunderfury, blessed BABE of the windseeker
---
Is Karol blade on hunter bis list too? Imagine not farming your pre bis pole arm, and winning this in Mc against melee classes before 15 agi to 1j weapon enchant is our. RIP
---
Learn the art of GTFO.  
---
When stuff like that happens, you have 3 options to survive:
---
1. Can you handle what you have pulled? Focus them down 1 by 1.
---
2. Oh shit button. Pop Retaliation (making sure they all in front of you) and blow all your other CDs and be ready to use a potion.
---
3. If you know that you will die if you fight, use Intimidating shout and run like hell (AWAY from more mobs) You can also hamstring and strafe at full speed. Also I got a trink from some quest around that level that basically gives you a sprint ability every hour. 
---
Running isn't the bravest thing to do, but it is smart. Saves you a lot of time in the long run and a lot of gold in repair costs. 
---
Best strategy is just to pick your path carefully. always chip at the edges of camps. Try not to a drill a hole to where you have mobs on 3 sides of you, because guess what happens if they respawn? You are surrounded. 
---
Also make great use of Ranged weapons to pull. You can ranged pull a named mob, then run, then turn and shoot him again, and keep attacking him while running away. If he has friends coming too, but you don't touch them, a lot of times they will rope back eventually before the guy you are fighting, leaving you 1v1.
---
Be it at 40 or 60, if I join a group thinking I'm a tank and get told half way through a trash pack I'm now DPSing I'm still rolling on tank loot.
---
It really IS that simple.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cl85ma/warrior_stance_dance_complete_macro_suite/
---
Also this is good on the subject. But I am on the same simpleness level as you.
---
Said the 15th in the announcement.
---
/shrug
---
You get 2% extra hit chance for +5 weapon skill, not 1. : ) Getting +5 weapon skill virtually increases your hit chance by 3 percentiles, that's why Edgemaster's is BiS.
---
Somehow you found something even worse
---
Welp, now I have to get it
---
If we had to go by the default attitudes of people playing those classes, almost everyone would be chaotic neutral or chaotic evil. Except healers, those are "neutral lazy".
---
I miss the days were engineering wasnt so important. And rofl trinkets and items. you just made the best of what your class had. The simpleness
---
Ran an agility dagger in my OH from 28 until 38. My spec was 17 in assasination and the rest was standard distributed in combat (Evasion, 5% hit chance bonus). It worked really well and I often outdamaged the rest of my dungeon groups on single target (if not for aoe members, since I don't have blade flurry). Rest of the equip is purely agility focused.
---
Gear overall as rogue isn't that important if your rotation is somewhat good. I used Garrote &gt; SnD &gt; SS &gt; SS &gt; Garrote &gt; (if combo point proc's then SnD again) if not then SS &gt; SND. Most mobs are dead for sure after that. Happy roguing aroung!
---
Hey, I'm sending you a PM!
---
Make circle, tank in middle, if ports on top of you run to tank, let healers do their job and heal you.
---
Really don't need any special potions for it.
---
\^\^
---
I haven't played Paladin enough to know how much damage I could do, mainly in the endgame, so I wouldn't have been confident enough to pick him. I am also not sure if the bubble would last long enough to drop the aggro, especially when some elite is chasing you (did someone say Mor'Ladim ?).
---
The only classes I really played (despite having leveled all of them on retail at some point) were Rogue, Priest and Mage, so I wanted to pick one of those 3 since I already know their potential good enough.
---
If wow actually looked like this I'd consider playing it
---
No i wanna grind in an area where there's barely any mobs that all have shitty abilities so i can make some more posts about savouring the journey on reddit
---
1. I do not want to use the addon.
---
2. having the addon would still not give me time to correct my error.
---
Addons are optional so please do not swear and reply to me so viciously for having an opinion different to yours.
---
Yah...shitty loot. But you can gain a level and a half from the quests. And there's a sweet ring at the end of that one god awful quest chain where you run all over stormwind for a half hour.
---
Definitely a PvP vid in the good ol' style. Montage of crits, only taken while blowing all cooldowns including ones from other players.
---
Lol, that guy is in my guild. Small world.
---
So you’re saying if you’re human, using swords for example, weapon expertise doesn’t help? Just with white hit % ?
---
&gt; Show up.
---
Easily the biggest challenge of vanilla raiding is having 40 people actually show up ready and able to play.
---
You didn't even leave the starting zones and felt bored because you were playing on a PvE server? I don't get it. Your first chance for real world pvp is in the upper 20s, and it doesn't sound like you got up there, so...That's weird.
---
So... The scarlet crusade did nothing wrong?
---
Are we the bad guys for killing them?
---
I don't know hunters, but 1% crit is pretty good at low levels. I'm sure there's a point where a certain amount of agility will beat it, since agi gives both crit and AP, but I don't know where that point is.
---
Depends on so many things.... Sometimes 50% is enough and sometimes 100% and a manapot is not enough.
---
It's an endless cycle of playerbase whining that causes it. Expac A: why are horde and alliance sharing a city? What happened to the WAR in Warcraft? Expac B: the city looks so empty. I miss Shattrath and Dalaran. Expac C: why are horde and alliance sharing a city?
---
Nah, just buy greens with +int or use int heavy blues from dungeons. You don't need other stats at all, just 6k mana should be fine.
---
Everyone takes it light in P1 except for hunters and rogues who we call go use their aggro drops.
---
Ranged pop all cd’s  and burn in P2. It isn’t that they aren’t good, the OT just isn’t having his threat reduced.
---
I find the lack of mechanical understanding people have in MC to be baffling. Especially people that played in private servers seem to be clueless as private servers often had completely wrong settings. The amount of times I have heard "This is not how it worked on private servers" is crazy.
---
Garr: You can LOS/Outrange (I prefer LOSing) the anti-magic pulse so you dont have to waste time rebuffing after the fight. The kill becomes a few seconds slower but overall it saves time.
---
Baron Gheddon: You can LOS the mana burn very efficiently. If done properly, you will need 0 dispels in the entire fight and you will have no mana problems.
---
Majordomo: The fire nova and shadow nova are the only real mechanics in the fight, rest of the mechanics do not really matter. The fire nova only has a 10 yard range despite its visual appearing like it has a 80 yard range. The shadow nova on the other hand has a 20 yard range. It is extremely easy to outrange every nova as a ranged. Mobs should be positioned so that melees are not next to too many mobs. Ranged should literally take 0 damage on that fight if done correctly.
---
Surger trash: Dont stack... This is not private servers.
---
Imps: Rush in an AoE they die before they can cast fire nova. Pulling back risks them casting their fire nova which can be dangerous.
---
Big fire elementals - Dont switch the lava spawn. There is no reason to. Just kill the big guy. It takes forever for the small one to split, just cleave them down/finish it up afterwards.
---
My favourite one is the packs around Gheddon/Shazzrah though. So many deaths because nobody understand how they work. First of all, there are 2 elementals. One of them doesnt do shit(the reaver I beleive), only a small frontal cleave. The other one (the one called "elemental" I think), does the pyroclasmic barrage. It is a frontal cone attack so just having a tank pick it up and face it away from the raid makes those packs trivial. Banishing can be really risky as they can come out of banish and instantly breath the raid. Mages, you can blink out of the dot. 
---
For the other two elementals in those packs, the one called guard or fireguard has a fire shield and I some other weak close range AoE. The other has an invisible channeling skill that every second for 6 seconds shoots a massive single target hit on a random person. The reason why people randomly die on these packs is because they take damage from something else, usually from hitting the guard, so that they go down to 80% HP and then die from the massive fire hit randomly hitting them. Kill the guy channeling fire blossom first and melees, dont hit the guard before that.
---
You right. It’s always situational.
---
I've sent you a pm with some other stuff you can try.
---
Yes.
---
 [https://discord.gg/bMktPfH](https://discord.gg/bMktPfH)
---
What are you even still doing here?
---
That's a bad warlock. They shouldn't be life tapping like that. Just one during the start of a pull is enough to benefit from Mana/health regen
---
Where does it say you get 2%? Certainly not in the blue post regarding this.
---
It is the 15th?
---
I dun wunt it
---
Yeh I don't understand where does this 6% comes from too. 
---
Also where did Blizz said that this "feature" wasn't a bug ??
---
Healbot?
---
Yeah we've had a couple long discussions in our guild about it too. Hard remembering when she resets as it doesn't always correspond with our raid days.
---
Telling people she was on a 5 day reset then clearing her on a Sunday and a Tuesday really fucks with Peoples heads.
---
Hmm yeah so 3 months after eu release
---
Guess it took a long time to get into MC back then
---
Same argument could be used for automated rotation addons.
---
it simply allows you to pay less attention on your rotation and be fine. 
---
Why automate skill?
---
Not everyone keeps up to date with the perfect bis list for every class. Some people don't even know what bis means. If it's an upgrade and you are in a pug it is within your right to need it
---
yea.. and all the other ones that are within 5%. Exactly those
---
I use Grid2 and Clique too and while it is great for the job, I have to admit that it easily took 2 hours to configure it to work the way I wanted it to.
---
But now that it is all set up, I really wouldn't want it any other way.
---
I understand the benefit of having the first video out there. I also understand that I dont like disingenuous people so I probably wouldnt choose his video anyway. Just my opinion I guess
---
That's not very healthy. Think about your heart.
---
If someone wants to play a certain way, why is it the wrong way. Back in vanilla, my brother wanted to be a dwarf warrior fury that dual wields, because it looked cool. It's not wrong.
---
No way dude, you're just mad that you fucked up and didn't have enough time to not suffer the consequences. TSM doesn't auto buy anything for people. What TSM can do, is sit and perform searches over and over and show you only things that fall into certain parameters that you've set up. Then when it detects a good value, you can click buyout. 
---
Everyone has an even playing field because TSM (and Auctionator and all the other AH addons) are all free and available for anyone to download. I'd suggest instead of complaining that others are using these tools, you go install one of these to make it easier for you to post your auctions correctly in the first place.
---
This is not true at all in the slightest. I play a few alts, and always have because I like the different class flavors, which are especially more apparent and distinct in Classic as opposed to retail. 
---
/u/dsea86, don't listen to this guy. Play how you want to.
---
On a separate note, I got my Reed drop after 3 runs and I didn’t even realize we killed the boss.
---
That's so funny, I can see myself stacking "of the Wolf" BoEs now....
---
Already don't bother logging in anymore after the last Rag/Ony clear. I'll do a full run DM East/West/North, maybe get the trinket, for nostalgia's sake, but that's it.
---
I'd probably commit to playing if they announced TBC, but Vanilla WoW is just severely lacking in content and I really can't bring myself to level another alt.
---
/r/leagueoflegends is very different from this sub, as an example. 
---
If I filter humor this sub seems pretty barren.
---
i am a horde mage lvl 35 on bigglesworth. we raided southshore last friday and made it too the inn. didnt see ur pansy boi there
---
So thrashblade vs lord general's sword for combat rogue MH? I feel like it procs a heck of a lot.
---
Dont feel so pressured to have it by 40. at 60g, you will have it by 41, 41.5 by just continuing to play as you are.
---
If you want to grind, grind gorillas in STV with skinning.
---
r/competitivewow
---
Yea pretty much me. No time before work since I work so early. It’s pretty much pick kid up from daycare, get dinner going since I get home before the wife, then hang out and help him get ready for bed. I’ll usually try to get on after he goes to sleep but then I’ll usually get tired myself within an hour lol. So it’s maybe an hour or two at most a couple days a week. 
---
Weekends I can usually squeeze more if we don’t have things going on. Sunday is usually my day since the wife doesn’t wanna watch football I’ll hide in my office lol. That’s dependent on how crazy he is being that day and how fast she gets tired of chasing him around and then it’s my turn lol. 
---
It’s prolly due to low levels you can really feel like you make progress in limited playtime. I really just need to hunker down and get something 60.
---
Yeah I'm thinking I'll do the same. I've been heavily down voted but I stand by what I say and I agree with you too. I will take your thoughts towards it tho and just not bother with AH anymore for this reason. I'm getting downvoted by a lot of TSM users who just aren't seeing my point or rejecting it completely without even thinking about it.
---
Its not a giant upgrade for warriors or rogues. Its an offhand weapon which is a lot lower then you think. 
---
To add, you then have orc warriors that don't want it.
---
Its also BIS until ZG for hunters whenhe warrior or rogue would replace it quickly.
---
Nope, probably not alliance ganking either. Just trying to finally fight back after getting dishonorably ganked by dickhead horde over and over.
---
I don't foresee any drama....
---
Gandling Alliance.
---
I start at the end of BC so it's my first time playing classic. I'm playing rogue at the moment and would appreciate a good social guild.
---
In caves and stuff didn't realize I shouldn't be goin in there alone so often and tight buildings
---
No its brut and core hound tooth until ZG for hunters
---
Use the filters. Sort by newest for example and you'll see that about 80% of the threads started actually are discussions. It's just that discussions, unlike memes, aren't upvoted enough usually to be visible when sorting by "top".
---
You get Thrash Blade at 45.
---
So unfair that someone can use an addon to gain ability that mages have to learn for money
---
It is mega overreacting and not nice to your friends. As a decent friend your primary goal should be to make your friends happy.
---
And as for your political crap: people just left because it is cool at this time and it also provides an excuse to stop playing and makes them appear as shining knights of justice at the same time. Very convenient. I am not saying that anything China or Blizzard did was right in any way. I am saying, his friends are asocial, attention grabbing, traiterious turncoats.
---
According to this official Not-a-Bug List Blizz knows about it and declares it as a "feature": https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887
---
Damn man, what happened to his other half?
---
You think you want to tank, but you don't
---
Yeah but you can clear MC with Thrash.
---
That's not bad. I tried silithis since its empty on my server, but getting to the ooze covered rich thorium is a little difficult with the elites
---
Can't sneak passed like I can in Winterspring.
---
For dungeons yes +healing is better as this will increase the mana efficiency of your healing spells.
---
For questing spirit+int is better since you will mainly use your damaging spells anyway
---
2H tanking is makes the Arena/Angerforge like 3x faster, just make sure youre a level 60 with gear doing it, not some level 53.
---
This is how i farm Arena/Anger, sustained 700dps for the entire thing.
---
Of course a tank says its harder to find healers than tanks....he IS a tank so he obviously doesn't have to find one.
---
I could be wrong but doesn't a ret pala and a ele shammy have buffs that contribute to the raid where as a mage brings ai but could also bring that as frost
---
oh hey that's my server
---
that's....fun
---
Exactly, you press it to queue your HS (if you want to use it you leave it as is) and press it again to cancel your HS. So you have everything on one button.
---
&gt; it's so nice sending my alts little "care packages" when I start them with bags and a couple gold, it makes you feel rich the entire leveling experience.
---
Hell yeah. Giving each of your alts weapon upgrades fiery weapon, giving +100hp on chest etc is great.
---
And of course the best enchant of them all: [Enchant Boots - Minor Speed](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13890/enchant-boots-minor-speed). This baby gives +8% movement speed and is super cheap!
---
This is just pure BS. Spy is a huge, unfair advantage to people who use it compared to people who don't use it. Being able to know when someone stealths within 120 yards is borderline cheating. So the "don't use it" argument is invalid as you are severely disadvantaged if you don't.
---
In Vanilla you had to read quests, think about where to go, were forced to explore much more etc. Questie makes this redundant and makes Vanilla questing function basically like retail. Again the "don't use it" argument is stupid, as you'd willingly disadvantage yourself hard if you didn't use it compared to the people that do.
---
I suspect it's some kind of bug, but nobody knows the true nature of Onyxia!
---
As a tank I screech at the dps for ignoring the healer and pulling for me.
---
48 Warrior main, about to go full prot soon :)
---
24 Hunter, 23 Lock, 23 Mage, 17 Druid,  Pally, Rogue, and Priest all rolled and have entered the world but still level 1.
---
Outside of weekends I usually get an hour after work when I first get home, then enough time to tank one dungeon after kids are in bed.
---
Yea I am having fun for sure. Just wish I could get something 60 and experience that again. Someday. Hopefully before Naxx since that is the only thing I really didn’t experience much of back in the old days.
---
Good,a tauren whistleblowing on his own shitty ganking faction.
---
I would try get outlaw for sure, makes quite a difference in kill speed, don't worry about your offhand that much, with the white damage miss chance and the massively reduced OH damage it's mostly used as as poison stick until you get sword spec, and either way you want the fastest thing you can find with decent dps/stats. 
---
Sword of omen will be the best OH you can get for awhile
---
Interesting you mentioned this as i started hitting some alts hard and the first thing i noticed was i barely die as much as i did at launch. I mean dying was just part of the game it felt like. I wondered why am i not dying as much?
---
I think it's a few things.
---
One would be the fact i have pick and choose of mobs, as in not nearly the volume of peeps burning down every spawn within a fraction of a second so I'm not rushing to get a mob i can't handle due to competition.
---
Which leads to another fact is i'm not rushing, taking my time.
---
I'm far more aware and it's not something i thought about until this post but i work from a distance, i guess too many years of retail and other "modern mmorpg's" you just Leroy the f in anywhere and it's not a problem, here it's a huge issue.
---
Been playing since launch and i guess what i'm saying is i thought i was ready and good enough for classic as yea, yea i got this, when no i didn't in many ways, i had a lot of slowing down and being strategic about everything, even simple mobs.
---
Usually 10-15% of the values of the mats
---
Mobs have "blocks".
---
So for example, lets say there's a tauren camp (with brutes, druids and shamans) and nearby is some wildlife (wolves and coyotes).
---
Brutes, druids and shamans might share a respawn block (meaning if you only kill brutes and druids, eventually entire area will contain only shamans), and wolves &amp; coyotes might share a block. But wolves wont likely share the block with tauren.
---
So using my example, no matter how many wolves you kill, tauren wont respawn faster. But if you need 2 shamans for your quest, killing brutes and druids might make shamans respawn faster.
---
Aragul
---
I think they changed the loot tables
---
mh+oh for pve
---
staff for pvp
---
I looked jt up and even in full naxx bis as mage you only have 9% hit.
---
Lol yeah I guess so
---
To me they’re basically “botting”. Except it’s the AH versus gold farming with a hunter. 
---
I don’t even play the game, here have my thorium bars .10 below the going price. I posted it on a short auction during peak times knowing it’ll sell and saved myself the silver posting a short auction cheap versus a medium or long auction that may not sell.
---
Started with 5 irl friends, 2 have fell off :(
---
Even though I'm on the East Coast, I joined a West Coast server for my friends. They have been total ghosts the past two weeks.
---
If this guy can get a silver I can - I’ll even send you a video of me videoing my phone videoing my screen on a video wall projector
---
Mages are the pushiest people in dungeons, it’s unreal. I tanked my first spellcleave last night and idt I’ll ever join another.
---
Good point! Kill em's all, it's a mercy!
---
ya doesnt a guild charter requir 10 people to sign it? Means each one of those characters had to run run around spamming invites to unguilded people just for a joke in westfall.
---
Right, except they tap themselves down to 20% health, and I just KNOW they are going to pull threat and bitch when they die from it.
---
Lifetap is great to use in a pull when I am putting out heals on people and you're going to benefit from some of the passive healing or smart healing that's happening, but tapping instead of drinking just pisses me off. Hell, tap and eat. I'd be fine with that too.
---
Yeah, the dev team has said several times that they wanted to do things differently. This is that chance. 
---
40man karazhan could be hard though. It's crowded with 10 sometimes. But 20 maybe like AQ and Zul Gurub.
---
"yes"
---
some do share spawn points, others dont
---
afaik it varies, but most spawn points are shared by multiple unique mobs, so if youre waiting for a specific mob it can help to kill similar types of mobs
---
I remember Skarm mentioned their feral druid was top dps on KT, but feral needs to really tryhard and farm consumables and Manual Crowd Pummeler to be competitive
---
My priest just got into this level range, and I still find it exceedingly easy to heal 2 hand tanks without much downtime.
---
The fire mage has one parse showing compared to the 2k from the other two. Not saying that they can’t do more do more than ret but these logs don’t really prove anything.
---
The one with the hole in the back?
---
Even a ret pally can deal more damage than ret pally. So that's hardly a competition.
---
That said BOEs... yeah kinda sucks. Ya gotta post stuff. 
---
Haven’t got an epic or any blue worth more than 7g on my lvl 60 grind (kroll blade &amp; tank neck dropped last night in ubrs but lost both) so I haven’t had to juggle anything worthwhile

This is the only reason I use it.

I would like to hear your conclusions.
---
Aight cool! Guess you guys can just pass on leaf now! Imagine hunters having more pre bis melee options than melee classes do.
---
&gt; Your anecdotal experience is not true of the real world, no matter how "fairly common" you may believe it to be.
---
I think it is - fairly common for people to say "ima need for x-spec allthough im y-spec" for instance.
---
It’s sad that you’re kink-shaming someones kink for shaming others - you’re all the shame
---
Multiple mob types in a specific spawn area will respawn randomly, except named NPC’s that will always respaen in their designated spot each time.  So if 3 types of mobs can spawn, any one of those could show up.  That’s why it’s always best to keep clearing mobs you don’t need because the ones you do need could spawn in next.
---
Congratulations, you’ve played yourself.
---
Thats pretty sad then, but I agree, new has some good discussions.
---
You do know it's BiS for Hunter's too?
---
just git gud
---
Lol hell yea.  Night elf I remember
---
Congratulations! Now could you share your farming secret? :)
---
Not really
---
Did you even read one word of what I wrote? I said MAYBE because it has happend before. You roll from alt to alt and seemingly never stop. There is only two answers: either you enjoy leveling/low level stuff or you are dissatisfied with the game. I am showing new perspectives and it helps everybody to not do the same stuff everyday and change it up a little bit. Sometimes taking a step back for 1-2 days and then coming back full force is what you need. Maybe he should try that.
---
I’m leveling a tankadin because of this.  When I get to level 20, grabbing consecration and spending the rest of the way to 60 tanking in dungeons.  Basically I think people will put up with a paladin tank because of the tank shortage.
---
This makes 5 box sound more attractive:)
---
Is it possible to get the shift + left click on a name in the chat log feature back while having this addon active? I get that it won't work while scanning, but even after it's done scanning it won't give me the information in the chat log and instead opens the /who menu showing that one person.
---
&gt;Nah they won't pull a Garrosh/Sylvanas for the 3rd time. Two was already too much.
---
Of course they will. Blizzard only knows how to write two stories: "War is bad" and "Two mortal enemies unite against the cosmic threat". And yes, maybe Tyrande will be edgy for a patch or two, but then they will double back just like they did with Jaina. Remember "Beware, beware of me?". I don't.
---
Yep. Most of us were leaning towards Alliance. But one friend was adamant about being a Shaman, the other said Horde or he'll play by himself. The Shaman got to 60, then dropped it for Hunter, then dropped that for rogue. The "Horde or nothing" Didn't make it to level 30.
---
Real Psychopath more like. You show up playing this dude at my table and Imma recommend a therapist.
---
Grats! I did as well! While everyone else has been buying gear/enchants/etc I have been Scrooge mcduck. Actually got it really easily while my buddies are &lt; 200g baffled how quickly I got one.
---
Anything you’ll keep all of Vanilla &gt; Temporary things :P
---
The rock elementals in badlands and the basilisks in STV have pretty good grey drops for vendoring. If you super want to farm, I'd try that.
---
But the gold generation goes up a lot at 40 too, so you might be better off just leveling. That's pretty much the rule of thumb for making money anyway. Unless you need a specific level range of drops (like for tailoring or enchanting), you're better off just leveling and then farming at 60 because the drops are much better.
---
It shows that one person on a fire mage was able to do more damage than the average Ret or Sham
---
man i never remembered getting so few frames back in vanilla, but looking at every 13+ year old pvp video suggests I also only got 8 frames per second.
---
That people weren't pieces of shit maybe
---
I’d rather get the quest done then go grind a less farmed-out mob somewhere else. I’d actually end up with more xp/hr.
---
Jesus Christ do not watch a 1h52m video of titsout rambling on and on.
---
Which is mad as it's one of the easiest classes to play in PvE.
---
It will 100% be a thing. While the pathing that allows hunter to kite the boss and the aggro mechanic might be considered bugs it is the way it worked in vanilla, and removing it would cause the #nochanges crowd to flip. They also hinted it will be a thing in their announcement with "and practice those tribute runs"
---
He said it was a valuable lesson. Not a life lesson, you said that. And also OPs lesson can be applied to a much wider range of things, for example
---
Don't go to the college your friends want to go to, apply for a college you want to go to

Really isn't that hard

I'm an undead rogue, name:  'wetbandit'. Do I get a cookie?

Hold my beer while i roll need on both dal'rends as a hunter. After all i can use em.

maybe the real mutiny was the friendship we made along the way.
---
I rolled on a west coast server to play with some people I know from retail and some they knew...had plans to start raiding this weekend but about 2 weeks ago all the 60s (except me) dropped guild to go raid and now my guild is a ghost town and I worry I won't be able to find a raiding guild on a west coast server that raids early enough that I could join.  WTB paid server transfer.
---
I completely understand. This grind was the first of my wow return that made me ask... is this worth it? Am I enjoying this?
---
In the end I think it was. Getting was satisfying for sure and a relief. I also made more in game friends from those groups than from anything else. I really debated buying 100% was ready to if my final run didn’t get it. That group was stopping for the night and I wasn’t willing to try and get in a group again with how anti melee people are currently.
---
Oof, must be rough for anyone who needs multiple sets then.
---
You can on a server that isn’t rppvp or pvp
---
Skinning is easy but I don't think the money is there.  At least not on my server.  Herbalism is better for making money IMO seeing as the mats are always in demand.
---
I've been trying to retrace my steps from leveling my original character at launch, but STV is just a huge pain. So I've been going around a few more places. I've already done some quests in those. Messing around in Thousand Needles right now (quests are low, but it's a fine relaxing break), then heading to Tanaris.
---
**Wrath of the Lich King.** That's the expansion that threw CC out of the door and introduced the attitude of *NUKE EVERYTHING* for DPS. I get it - you want to feel powerful as a mage or warlock and crawling through a dungeon and not using your best spells doesn't contribute to that.
---
...but that's not what Classic (and TBC [kinda]) were about.
---
For those who are *so sure* you want to re-live that expansion, you're going to be really surprised how "not vanilla" it was, especially the second time around.
---
&gt;ClassicLFG is the addon you´re looking for, but beware people are stupid and list only under "custom" not for the dungeons they are looking for
---
I miss this so much v\_v Farming in war prot is such a pain
---
Wouldn't an enhancement shaman still be better for imp WF &amp; better mana issues?
---
A single green drop can sell for 4-5g. It's not exact science but I'd say you're going to make at least 10-15g per run.
---
Let's say you do 2 runs in the evening plus a few dungeon quests (or like eastern plagueland quests), collecting a few nodes in the process.
---
That's 50g in a 4h session. I mean yeah if you don't have 4 hours then farm herbs to make that amount in 2 hours or just wait 2 more days.
---
&gt; Wtf, arcanes dropped to 30g on my server. I aint even bothering to auc them anymore. I have 15 of them just sitting on me waiting until they go 40+g again.
---
30g crystals 40g bars is the normal resting point eventually, IIRC. I wouldn't expect much.
---
Though they will certainly spike this week, as bars are needed for warlock mounts.
---
Number 2 is false. Dhks was patched and hotfixed many times on retail. Dhks should still be in the game and I see no reason to remove it but civilian kills they should remove from the get go.
---
This is one of those things that makes the average person think #nochanges went a little too far.
---
Think of it like this. There is so much demand for tanks that they get dungeon groups instantly. Most groups have 0 competition for items. So well they end up getting all the gear pretty fast and after that, there is not much reason to run the dungeons.
---
I've been leveling a tank because the lack of them.
---
But even at low levels it's getting pretty frustrating. Sometimes you get decent people that understand they need to wait a few seconds to let you get threat. But most of the time, retards just unleash their dps every time, and never learn.
---
I actually had an enhance shaman last night who would pretty much always attack the opposite target I would pull and be trying to build threat on first. Then cycle through mobs basically trying to pull aggro on each.
---
I can see why tanks are hating the game right now. I main a Hunter and am very quick on the Feign if I do happen to pull threat.
---
DPS just need to learn how to play the game, and we'll likely see more tanks.
---
Queues on DM patch day. The content zerg cometh!
---
When you have 0 points in intelligence and 100 points into being a whiney little B.
---
Are there any similar places that are mainly alliance for Horde to quest?
---
I dropped warrior after 20 levels because of people falling out, left alone now so I swapped to the utility of a druid for ease of leveling and the fact I can still tank. Would be nice to level the warrior though.
---
Same. I dunno why but WoW has always been something to be ashamed of, even back when I played vanilla it was the exact same
---
You too!!
---
I was talking about stats not whether you would actually use the extra dps or not.
---
Idk why but death is A-ok with me. The implied rape in this pic however bothers me.
---
... what? No they don't. It's common practice that unless said before the run starts, people will only need on their MS (which is 9 times out of 10 the spec they're running as).
---
If I joined an UBRS run with a Warrior tanking and he Needed Truestrike Shoulders, I'd be pretty pissed. State that shit up front so both parties don't waste their time.
---
Playing warrior tank, i went for full prot (1h shield) from lvl 40 on till 60 and i have to say it was incredible anyoning to tank anything as well as more mana consuming for a healer. Most of the time i lost aggro on mobs because the DDs where a few level above me or simply not hiting the main target apart from completly ignoring that i asked them to wait a few seconds for each pull at the beginning of the dungeon.
---
Since 60 i am running around with a Fury/Prot version and most of the problems are gone + the healer usually has more mana at the end of the fight because he only has to heal me and not  the whole group.
---
On the other hand you need to know what mobs you can tank with 2x 1h and where you need a shield and / or switch in fight if you take too much damage.
---
I'm no min-maxer at all, not the least bit. But stating you CAN'T play wrong is pure BS no matter how you turn it. Or would you call a rogue in full int-cloth-gear a preference of playstyle rather than plain wrong?
---
I believe he was talking about rich thorium. You wont be getting many of those with that route.
---
imp WF doesn't worth the wasted slot that an ench shaman is.
---
nevermind their mana issues... they can't even melee properly on rag cause they are valid target for his knockback.
---
The problem is, and always was, DPS meters. If people weren't chasing chart-topping, they might be more inclined to play the game as it's meant to be played. But, DPS meters are of course valuable tools too, so it's totally understandable why people use them. It's just a negative symptom of their use.
---
druids should be true neutral tho
---
PVE you can. (I think)
---
Mankrik. It is a horde guild called girls only.
---
Not in leveling instances. 
---
A "tank" would never pass up on a weapon upgrade in favor of the dps, because it helps with leveling solo.
---
At level 60? Sure.
---
Realistically you could create a very simple macro to click every 10 seconds. Most modern computer mice have built in customizable macros that could do this.
---
You may want to check out other places like Westfall, next to Stormwind. You kinda have to go between places to keep questing and mobs on your level!
---
oh god how ever will they clear the content with a ret paladin... looks at notes.. ohh you can do it with 30 people in blues.
---
In 15 years for classic++
---
You should have the chest from VC quest which is better.
---
There's a lot of small things tanks can do to improve their own experience. 
---
I will do a write up of things that I was doing incorrectly, and what you can do to change them. Look for it a bit later today on this sub.
---
Did you do the starting zone quests?
---
For the most part yes. The implied rape of the one captive guard is a little darker than usual even for WC.
---
lmfao, "best" rogues will just go fuck you up, and not care about your trash addon.
---
Pretty sure op isn't secure on his orientation lol
---
Olympus is Asmongolds guild (a streamer) It's a band of rejects. Ignore it.
---
It's a great addon and I love using it, especially the Kill on sight part. 
---
Whenever some guy ganks me while levelling, they go on my KoS list and never leave it, rofl!
---
Sure, but seems less of a wasted slot than having an elemental shaman - with arguably more mana issues - and no imp WF in a melee group to me.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
DKs were an awful experiment and should have never been implemented
---
I didn't know about this spot. And now I do and all the fish will be mine!
---
This addon was here originally. Anyone interested in wpvp should use it because it is a great addon. It allows you to add people to Kill on sight lists/ add notes to players of the opposite faction. It encourages revenge pvp in a way the normal UI never would.   
---
This anti addon circle jerk is nonsense.
---
Thing is, im in love with tanking, but i also think warrior class fantasy and QoL game experience is by far the worse in vanilla. I can not see myself as playing a warrior outside of dungeons ever and that really weighs down on my class decision. On the other hand, druid class fantasy hits closest to me but being in bear form all the time just wont work for me. Paladin could work, but i dont just wanna tank dungeons. So yeah... classic is the worst for me in terms of tanking.
---
Haha still I made a vast majority of the gold farming fire elementals, fused wirings, and golden pearls. Also dungeons. I just switched to an aoe spec because I was getting close and wanted it fast.
---
People shouldn't pass on anything that is an upgrade for them. Bis or not. Not to mention why would a shaman know warrior's bis list. He might as well bullshit his way into owning that ring claiming it's bis.
---
I sure do love botting
---
Lakeshire and 1k needles are contested zones, lol.
---
Killing lowbies does not give dishonorable kill. It only applies to NPCs
---
I started with 4 IRL friends, and 3 of them are still going strong. None of us are 60 yet though, but some are close, and I think we are getting there together this weekend. I've had more fun leveling than I've had in retail for years, so no complains at all from me :)
---
That's not really a DPS loss, it's just the lack of an expected gain. Even without the rage gain, WF gives *much* more DPS than agi totem just from the free attacks. This is why rogues also prefer WF. Their procs are nothing but white damage, no resource gain or any other mechanic that benefits from additional swings beyond the damage dealt, and WF is still like 300% better than agi.
---
If you kill someone who's grey it's not a DK .... Only certain NPC kills leads to DK. Just don't get in city raids and you should be fine
---
Thats not how DKs work. It HAS to be a civilian NPC. Which there are not a lot of in the first place and they mostly exist within lowbie zones and within towns.
---
Use the combat log and make a live upload to warcraftlogs, so you can analyze the raid and have the timestamps. Also the kill time. I think this is the easiest way.
---
Check his name. Just trolling you dude.
---
Gaypride sword? Why waste a debuff slot like this?
---
Ya, he learned to avoid OP and set up clear loot rules.
---
You don't Need on a Shield if you're DPSing. That's common courtesy and how most groups do it. If OP had wanted the shield he should have spoken up in advance.
---

Probably because of how many highly upvoted posts featured people crying about how massive and horrible DM would be.  Now that the hysteria from the hard to please crowd has died down a bit, there’s room for normal people to ask what the hubbub is about since that huge amount of hysteria made the situation seem a lot more complex than it really is.
---
I agree with Grizzlan, or just change the penalty. A (short) PvP debuff that stacks dependent on the number of dishonourable kills you make, that makes it easier for lowbies to kill you  if in the event you kill lots of dishonourables. Like -2% armour per dishonourable for 3 minutes or something per stack, stacking indefinitely.
---
Sorry about your world buffs, bro.
---
where's the best place to farm fuse wiring? I'm actually farming pearls now in tanaris (turtle genocide) no luck yet though.
---
I'm also interested in this but I guess a YouTube search will be the best bet. I'm sure there will be a full walk through on there of how to do it.
---
Eh, fuck pallies. I had a prot pally roll need and win SGC over me (fury warrior) for his ret set... Bitch, no one is taking a ret pally to a raid, you don't fucking need SGC. Hahahah
---
Daft punk - harder better faster stronger, is house music. Tempo is 126 bpm. Mixes great with other house songs of the same speed. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about here.

Hitting on a mob for 4 minutes? Do you even know how to play WoW?
---
I tend to 4-5 shot mobs my own level. 
---
Sorry that you suck at paladin!
---
Any particular reason you're minmaxing content that can be cleared by 25 people? lol
---
Herb only, rest is a negative.
---
It has a few pieces of gear that are good for some classes pre-raid, especially trinkets. Better libram enchants and new mage water. And it's also one of the best places to farm for gold.
---
first off, relax. you're tripping out mate
---
secondly, even factoring in normalization, and factoring in the slower speed which gives less auto clipping, rhok still results in you doing more DPS.
---
clearly you need to look into this more. Its like you have blinders and all you can think about is normalized single shot weapon damage
---
I'm a lvl 39 warrior (herbalism + skinning + cooking if that helps). Just reached lvl 40 yesterday and I'm nowhere even close to buying mount as I sit at 24 gold now. The only herb that I can collect and sells for good price is fadeleaf.
---
Where is the best spot to farm raw gold killing mobs for me? Maybe some place where I can get some skin and some herbs close to mob spawn points? Mobs of a bit lower lvl than me are preferable so I don't die :)
---
Tried farming tigers at STV. I've learned cooking recipe for their meat and was getting about 6-7g/h but I wonder if there are better options for my lvl
---
Those particular pulls i always LOS pull em back because theres no way we wont aoe them, but ill take a melee attack from all of them first, focus on the elites and let the mage or whatever go nuts on aoe since they will hit everything and kill them before they become dangerous.
---
Hope it helps.

Dude I play a mage and it's pretty damn simple, been playing since classic. Frost spec is by far the most boring way to play a mage.

---
Maybe you’re sorting wrong because I mostly see discussions
---
What is spellbatch?
---
Ah yes, I can't wait for OP to roll on Truestrike Shoulders when he's tanking because "Hey, I need them for my DPS Spec".
---
If you bring a Warrior as DPS to a level 60 dungeon, they are brought to DPS. No one is gonna be fine with them rolling on Tank gear just like no one will be fine with a Tank rolling on DPS gear.
---
Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.
---
That'll happen in Classic. There are *some* rails to guide you to the right areas, but it isn't nearly as linear as modern MMO design.
---
You likely need to return to Dun Morogh and complete all quests there. Once you've done that you should be level ~11, go to Ironforge, take the tram to Stormwind, pass through Elwynn Forest, then head west to Westfall.
---
Leveling through two different zones is common.
---
Pre-emptive LF Guild. 3 for the price of one.

Of course not at raiding level yet - but next week we should be ready. Two of us are cutting edge raiders on retail so have good exp.

---
No, you didn't.
---
Would a fully geared fury or arms warrior not beat a mage in a 1v1 duel?
---
Drink more tea.
---
No no...... I'm pretty sure that's the circle of death.
---
Yeah, I've started using that over other BiS lists. It's quite valuable. The whole Fight Club discord has been a godsend.
---
I'd hate to think people are questing all the way to 60. Upper 50's you should be doing dungeons heavily to gear up.
---
I got strikers mark on my hunter. You mad?
---
Ah, no homo. It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
---
Guess it's past time to start leveling a hunter alt!
---
On closer lookup the 6% cap with +3 target level and +5 skill does agree with observations (https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#target-at-3-levels-5-weapon-skill-n28063)
---
Surprisingly there is 3-4 per loop 1 in the elite Dino zone usually up to 2 in the volcano in the middle and in Silithus there is always 1 uncontested on my loop around so I’m pretty happy with those 2 zones
---
I guess the death feels ok because you killed a gazillion enemies while playing.
---
You should make that clear when entering the dungeon though. Most people follow the rule of MS&gt;OS and if you start needing on items that are tank gear when you're DPS, people will call you a ninja.
---
I did all of dun morogh and I'm now lvl 14
---
Unless you've already got plenty of healers.
---
To level properly, you must travel between more than 2 same level zones. Doing instances might save you from grinding 1-2 levels with quests.
---
Well, its weird because it isn't a 10-20 zone, so its a 15-25 zone......... with no equal (I think). So its a PvP zone because anything higher than the 10-20 zones are pvp.
---
I think thats the logic here?
---
Her wing buffet is different to firemaw/ebonroc/flamegor hers doesn't reduce threat it just does a knockback on everyone in front of her. It's her actual Knock Away ability that reduces threat, seems a bit silly to have 2 abilities near functionally identical but I guess her skills were put together before BWL so they changed it up with the 3 drakes.
---
Rn I get 10-15g/hr farming the bats and dogs in EPL up near plaguewood. They drop rugged, I get about a stack every 10-15mins. That’s at least a g per stack. The dogs drop tender wolf meat, which tanks use for stam food, and the bats drop evil bar eyes which vendor for 20s EACH or can be saved til the dark moon faire arrives and sell for even more. Along with that I usually end up with 2-6g worth of greens.
---
i dunno I got those sweet t1 boots last night, dunno if anything else is worthwhile though
---
So at some point an orc banged an ogre...
---
&gt; but will miss quality of life additions like clicking the target.
---
Clicking to target isn't just quality of life. Its a significant power upgrade.
---
Quality of life upgrades are things that eliminate tedium without making you stronger, like being able to track mailboxes.
---
So probably do the next step stated.
---
This kills the guild.
---
None! Because they all burned out on retail months ago and not a single one wants to try classic.
---
Hi, I'm an officer over at &lt;Homies&gt;. I think we might be a good fit as most of our time is dedicated to helping recruits with their attunements and pre-bis/bis gear. Feel free to shoot me over a ping in game, my name is Lema. We raid Tues/Thurs at 8pm (including tonight).
---
 funny cause i'm doing the exact opposite.
---
i'm an undead picpocketing BRD to buy a wolf.
---
with a 1g price for 20 runecloth you need  500ish gold to be exalted. not that expensive when the mount itself is 1000g.
---
the hard part is buying the runecloth without skyrocket the price on AH due to your massive demand.
---
Raiding and end game dungeons are much harder than anything in classic.
---
But otherwise retail is that easy
---
I didn't say it was confirmed now you're confused.  Bye
---
Not bad tbh, we started off as 12, now we're 6 active. And some other friends are still active on different realms.
---
That is exactly the sort of attitude that destroys progress. If everybody stopped researching or experimenting because an idea was "crazy" then where would we be? Think about that.
---
Stimulating discussion and thought is never a bad thing. Even if the idea is proven to be false, there is knowledge gained in the discussion.
---
so, basically, the same story we've been hearing on retail for the past 15 years?
---
wonder what solution they have over there... oh wait, there's still a huge tank shortage and it's not gonna change.
---
the good part about classic is that you don't actually need a tank for most of the instance, and a DPS warrior dual-wielding in leather gear can still tank just about anything in dungeons minus drak or baron.
---
All of them. Except one, he hit 60 and just decided to slow down. Myself, I just hit 40 and plan to continue into 60. But all of my friends except for that one guy quit. They outlined their intentions before hand however so this was fully expected. The games not for everyone and that shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

Idol and doll makes this enchant a whole lot more rare and hard to get for those who want to know what option is better for the individual.

These NPCs are literally only low level quest givers mostly in opposing factions starter/leveling areas. Just avoid going into lvl10-30s quest areas and killing every single thing around you, its really not that hard. I had 50k HKs in vanilla and a total of 3 DKs, and those were from after I had decided I was done with ranking up and went ham. If you are after pure honor farm, you are not going around camping lvl1-30s anyway...
---
Ive been tanking pretty much all my dungeons at 60 as a warrior specced into 0/31/20 it sucked at first as i didnt have enough plate gear so had to use a shield now i have some decent hit gear and plate ive started DW fury tanking and all my aggro worries have gone away!

Ill usually charge + battleshout macro switch to def stance, tab sunder/revenge until i have enough threat then macro switch to sword and shield to tank the rest of the pack if the healer doesnt have good gear. Shit works really well and im having a blast tanking now! And the dungeons have been going way quicker.
---
Thats why you have to fear the guy named "SkullSlayer" or "10LvLPlusSlayer", you know, the guy who ganks people 15 levels above him and murders them.
---
Sociopaths are generally considered incurable because part of their disorder makes it impossible for them to admit or accept that they have anything wrong with themselves.
---
Imp counterspell gives a blanket silence for 4 seconds.
---
Eh, just in my habit to try and be the best I can be :P Theorycrafting and min-maxing is fun to me, even if it's not required.
---
That's now how it works. There are diminishing returns. The amount of wep skill it requires to reduce the hit needed for cap from 6% to 5% is not realistically attainable.
---
Right? My warlock will go out of her way to swim out to shore to buff players, bandage random people who are low on HP and /cheer when someone nearby levels up. 
---
Oh the floaty demon next to her? Ignore that blue idiot, he's harmless. Literally.
---
Exactly what I'm after! Nice one
---
I think its better that way. I can only imagine everyone on their mounts in IF, or SW, neighing or snorting or whatever the gnome chickens do, for ALL ETERNITY, while I'm just chilling at the bank or AH or mailbox.
---
clearing trash, regenerating mana between pulls, oh and maybe the other hours you'll spend outside of raids doing open world, dungeons and pvp
---
I like mine. Eatyourface
---
I know it exists and works again but Back in tbc i remember lots of healers complaining that they cant use it anymore. Maybe im misrembering
---
go ahead and DPS.
---
the mage will kite 90% of the pack, taking 0 damage from it and killing it more efficiently than any other method. you can DPS that one elite or range mob that'd give him trouble.
---
you're not really needed for anything minus few bosses.
---
&gt;TBH, I'd generally recommend not healing me on a lock unless I'm below 50%, depending on the fight and such.
---
so much this.
---
I had some snarky dude /w me while out questing the other day, laughing at me for being a n00b who rolled an undead warrior, not an orc. Dude, I min/maxed this game from 2004-2010, in 2019 I'm just here for the scenic ride.
---
Unlike retail, you'll have to rotate zones you quest in. Look for Westfall and Darkshore
---
Originally I only started using it because there was a bug in Luna regarding pets of party-members.
---
And I think that since that is fixed in Luna it is very well a contest. The only real advantage I see it having over Luna is that I can move it around all the time without going into some menu. Oh, and that Luna is probably even harder to configure.
---
Sounds like we’re more or less in agreement. I said 10, you said 10-15. I thought you meant 50g/hr and you quoted about 50g for a 4hr session so 12.5/hr.
---
It really is astounding how this is lost on so many people: if you don’t want to get ganked, go roll on a PVE server.  
---
It really is that simple.  
---
But then, if you roll on a PVE server, you won’t be able to bitch and moan about world PvP.
---
Let's take the noob questions to the next level.... How do you cancel HS?  When I queue it up, it is like I can't cancel it?  
---
- "15 war started back up after 5+years without wow and never playing a war"
---
Raid benefit &gt; a single person
---
Melees should get their melee weapons first and hunter should get their ranged weapons first
---
This 💯 you can’t have everything tho so be prepared to have good and bad in every guild you are in.
---
filter by most recent.
---
Where is rape implied here? Ever heard of taking a hostage? If they take a hostage the Alliance guards might be more reluctant to just storm in there. They could even use her as a bargaining chip to possibly buy their freedom.
---
All of us found guilds and don’t run anything outside of it.  Every time I’ve tried to pug. Every single time. someone either pulls for me or opens with aoe before I can even get a sunder on the main target. Let alone any secondary targets. So I won’t tank pugs anymore.  
---
For all of you people opening up with aoe or nuking anything but the main kill target you guys realize that it takes us 3ish melee swings to build enough rage to sunder one time right? That for me is 1.6x3= 4.8 seconds for one single sunder.  One sunder is barely enough to hold aggro from the healer it will not stop the 2nd,3rd or 4th targets from running instantly to you. Give me some freaking time and maybe there would be more tanks to pug for you. 
---
I’ve found my group of like minded people and don’t ever have to look back.  Good luck to everyone pugging but I don’t have time for that.
---
What is the reasoning behind offtanks eating flame breath, rage-gain only or has it something to do with threat too that I can't find any info on?
---
That's an inflated estimate, it's more like 10-20 if you do the math.
---
...you okay?
---
&gt;  but why would they ban it if the functionality was there in Vanilla?
---
Addons are the one area Blizzard has not accepted this argument.
---
No only hunter can solo tribute. You can however farm jump runs with a tank (one of you need minig) or aoe lashers
---
can I go into MC and then go do Onyxia right after? (it's a different ID, right?)
---
The lack of tanks has been a thing for a long time. What I think really exacerbates it in classic (you saw this in BC, too) is the lack of dual spec and respec costs.
---
Warriors trying to quest/farm/grind in prot spec is painfully slow. I'm sure Druids can swap to cat form and get a little boost, but Warriors are a little screwed.
---
I did it in stranglethorn the robot goblin guys there drop them and also give you rep with booty bay. On the coast you can also find Naga that drops the clams with gold pearls
---
\[The Butcher\] median price is 27684g on your server but on all US servers median is 45749g. On average people post 1 auction per day but it takes on average about 33 days to sell one.
---
wait you can't do that? aww man!
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/vSDeeIF](https://imgur.com/a/vSDeeIF)
---
is it just an instant action without any downside?
---
My shadow priest has an issue with this chart.
---
Classic isn't a nice tidy bow end to a zone, you'll find you need to bounce between a few zones.
---
Blizzard may have took this a bit too far but they are eight in my opinion. This guy is a nerd gamer (not an activist or anything similar) and doesn't even live in Hong Kong and the event isn't the place for voicing political speech. I hate the 21st century where everyone is so vocal about their opinions and aren't even involved in politics. Bunch of sheep...
---
ElvUI has pretty much everything built in. Create a couple mouseover macros for your heals/dispell and you won't need anything else.
---
Prison scenes are always a beacon of diversity :P
---
SO 👏 MUCH 👏 THIS 👏 !! Stop pulling for me or running ahead of the group when I'm waiting for the healer's mana and for the love of God target the damn skull! *hard eyeroll*
---
Only for Alliance scum /s
---
Instant groups, yes. But I ALWAYS have competition for the gear I want unless I create the group  and weed out other warriors. And somehow, they always "are tank main spec", and are just there with off spec dps to roll on all the tank gear.
---
Which is what will drive up twink BoE prices from 5-10g to what people expect to get.
---
14 through Dun Morogh is very good actually. Congrats!
---
Your next step is definitely a combination of Loch Modan and Westfall quests. Some of the early quests in Westfall will be green for you, but that's perfect - green quests tend to be easier to complete.
---
Complete those, then go back to Loch Modan and do the green/yellow quests that you left behind there. Once you've done that, you'll be ready to complete the Westfall quest "The Defias Brotherhood" and start running dungeons.
---
That’s the rule
---
This isnt entirely true. It does more than scan the log. It knows if players exist nearby even if they do nothing
---
Feeling edgy and faintly superior that he doesn’t like a game that we do.
---
I have been Dying to try a 2 handed fury sword spec Warrior.  [Spamstring Sword Windfury Spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/203050113320005-0505300501501001)
---
Easy solution, kick the bad DPS. You don’t need 3 DPS to do most of the dungeons.
---
Or you can get a ZF staff.
---
Yup this has happened every raid we have done, 3 clears 0 wipes. Communication is always great
---
So live with the consequences. All the phases were announced will before release, I have zero sympathy for people who quit pvp servers in phase 2.
---
Git gud
---
Sounds like a pepega
---
85% pre bus is better then most ppl i zaw someone wearing SM gear last week lol. Youll be fine worry about consumable later when you have miney and are trying to clear faster
---
kill mobs ?
---
Heartseeker? There’s been a 60 orc hunter hanging out at red ridge
---
I’m having trouble viewing the numbers on each map as well. Commenting here in hopes someone can find higher res images.
---
I hope it stays. I don't pay attention to my surroundings, so people used to sneak up on me all the time. Spy has saved me from a ton of ganks.
---
Try both of those things, use a DPS meter and time your kills.
---
So, you tell us; which is better?
---
yeah, its called the Print screen button.  
---
If you press that every hour, it does exaclty what you want.  
---
It stores the picutre in the Screenshot folder, within your WoW folder
---
yes, absolutely nothing make sense, it's glorious.
---
It’s how I afforded my mount by killing basilisks and selling everything they dropped and the thick leather on the ah
---
people in general won't bother with Tribute run buffs for MC . it's to much hassle for no significant gain.  It's fun to do once in a while as experiment or when you want to set a new guild record but not something to do every week.
---
right.
---
which is why we have mage AoE'ing instance all the time... surely your familiar with the term spellcleave? where the tank only job is to pull a bunch of mob?
---
Woowwwww do more!
---
Best way to play. The min-max mindset that retail stuck in my head killed my first go at classic a month back and I’m returning to it with a fresh perspective.
---
yeah, thats the other side of the problem. If you are rolling on ranged weapons as melee, you have no rights to complain about hunters rolling on melee weapons ofc.
---
If your guild requires this kind of min-maxing to complete the current content you are really bad at the game
---
I haven't done it personally but there is talk of mind soothing your way through as a priest and stealthing as a druid and then dotting the king down...
---
if they are elementals you can't use nature damage.
---
Yeah, I'm using it but I'd prefer that it didn't exist. It completely changes PvP, being instantaneously alerted to any enemy player within like 60 yards and given a button to target them. Alerts for stealthed players, etc. You cannot be caught by surprise with this addon unless it was someone who was already stealthed when they entered the addon's radar, which seems to be at least as big as the maximum view distance.
---
You do realize that MC has been on farm for over a month at this point?
---
While progress on your server might be slow, there are others that are full 8/8 and more or less have nothing to work for at this point. Thus a hunter might get this as a stat wep 
---
Really don’t care how much you downvote me
---
Technically true, however their unique combination of mana amount, life and regen values makes it very inefficient. Life tap + eating / bandaging alone is way better already.
---
The specific cast of "Stealth" isn't actually in the combat log for that exact reason.
---
Why do you think you only benefit from 3 shamans? Their totem buffs only apply to their group, not the raid.
---
"Lord Gigadick" is hilarious.
---
You're actually describing CC. Crowd control isn't all about sheep and sap, it's about LoS pulls and management of the mobs in a pull. Putting up skulls and Xs is a form of CC. Assigning a voidwalker or pet to die while you tank the others is CC.
---
So I agree with you that DPS players need to slow down and think about CC as a whole. When they don't, the only people put under stress are the tanks and the healers.
---
I was flying when the server reset started. Where will I be when the servers are back?
---
This. There are a ton of floating wreckage pools on the Savage Coast of STV. Pulling mythril-bound trunks from these pools can be quite lucrative at that level. I spent about 3 hours fishing the coast on my server's off-hours and made around 40-50g selling the bolts of cloth and boe greens
---
Trolls cooking children in soup is fine, warcrimes on both sides, and slavery are all fine to you. But taking one hostage is where you draw the line?
---
Oh god, the amount of flippin anger runs I've done for that HoJ. 100g would be worth it at this point.
---
And keyring
---
Well tanks are in an odd spot with the ratio of tanks for dungeons to raids most a lot of them will have to swap to DPS for raids so it makes sense for them to be rolling on DPS gear as well. Sure it'll probably annoy the DPS who need the item as well but it is what it is.
---
The most important part and no one has said it yet.... 55 water!
---
Depends, are you planning to raid?  You can tank every 5man in arms, even the 10man raids.
---
Where did I ever say that PvPers are sociopaths? Please don't intentionally misunderstand, it really shows you don't want to discuss in good faith.
---
PvPing because it's fun = amazing
---
"Your pain is my pleasure" = literally signs of a  psychopath.
---
I PvP myself a lot, but never do I do it because I like inflicting pain on others.
---
I think it'll be a little more on my server to get Exalted. 
---
Either way, I'm committed to it. Good luck to you in your pickpocketing adventure!
---
You're horde, you'll be fine.
---
Where in my text can you read anything remotely close addon to breaking stealth? You dolt.
---
Hunter is the only class given a tracking ability. Now all classes can have a semi good tracker. Without giving up the utilties hunter had to get tracking.
---
Exactly. The argument is such a moot point considering stat sticks exist for melee and ranged.
---
Its a 15 year old game. Not much to talk about
---
That only applies to certain elementals.
---
Of my 6 friends who hyped it up in the days prior 2 have made it to 60, one has fallen off at 51, and another is slowly leveling casually but regularly and 2 never got past level 15.
---
Do you have your WW axe? After that I’ve been grinding fast and losing very little health with how fast stuff dies.
---
The biggest issue I see is that TSM is faster than any person could be.  The current AH is slow and cumbersome in it's unmodded form.  The odds of having people hit search at that exact moment after he posted and then find and buyout immediately is extremely slim.
---
Census addons were broken because it automated calls to the client.  Auction addons do the same thing.  They scan and build databases of the AH faster than any person could do it.  That's why it was written.  But more than that, they update their scans very quickly.  If I'm browsing for cloth on the classic client, I hit search and I see the full list of that moment.  If I take 5 minutes browsing it, I don't get the new items listed in those 5 minutes unless I hit search again.
---
If another thread today is true and the /who function is open again to addons but has to be clicked for each call, why are AH addons given a pass?
---
Nearly impossible to quest as an arms either so i myself made a decision to prot farm brd till 58.  So far no hoj yet but i gather good parties quickly and tank ST for gold here and there.
---
This is on my server! People always complaining about him in world chat.
---
Can't tell if /s or not.
---
Replace with mage, clear it faster.
---
wow your economy is fucked
---
stacks of rugged sell for 1.2-1.5
---
greater fire pots are like maybe 2 gold at the most
---
I just dinged 60 and I'm like look at all these quest zones I haven't visited. Haven't touched epl, sithilis, ungoro, burning stepes, feralas , tanaris (exept for zf stuff), and then bearly did anything in stv except a few quests for booty bay. My quest log was basically always full. Do people just not do dungeons?
---
“Better few, but better.”
---
Many WoW friends from vanilla/tbc/wrath era fell off after the Lich King... .there was a year of almost nothing (ruby sanctum) then cataclysm which was a disaster across the board. i'd say 50-75% of my vanilla guild disappeared permanently from that point onwards.
---
i took increasingly common breaks from warcraft, almost 3 years at one point (beginning of WoD to the end of Legion, resubbed to Legion for the last 3 months). even Legion didn't have the same hold on me, although it was the best wow product in years. 
---
so i always knew going back to classic was starting fresh, and its been refreshing. an entirely new guild, literally just replying to /1 general spam in the first few days of launch. lucked into a big guild, lots of active players (\~100 during prime time) all starting fresh. having no expectations aside from having to start again i think has improved my experience with Classic to many others who came in with big plans.
---
Same here. I played a warrior for our group and only our rogue plays now. I love my warrior right now, but I would have 100% played a caster if I had known they were all going to fall off after 40.
---
It seems he plans to post more though!
---
As others have said, Spy is just a combat log parser with a fancy gui.
---
And you can absolutely engage someone without them knowing; just don't get into combat!
---
I don’t think that’s confirmed to come out with it. I believe Blizzard stated they’d release key ring before phase 2 but they haven’t said anything since then unless I missed something (Could obviously be this DM patch but again, nothing confirmed)
---
I pray to god for a key ring....
---
Does he? If so, my bad!
---
The info I read implied we kill him and he gets replaced. But it could be we just drive him off? That makes sense too.
---
Grats! ::::)
---
I got bad news for you.
---
Most warriors are dps because you only need 1-2 actual prot warriors in your raid out of 40 people vs in dungeons you need 1 for every 5 people.
---
Most warriors who are dps have tank gear because they tank dungeons for their pre bis raid gear (dps).
---
I have tanked every 60 dungeon as my raid spec 17/34/0 fury and I roll on dps gear because guess what, it's my main spec. 
---
I'm tanking because everyone and their mother needs a group and if you don't want me to roll on my main spec gear have fun waiting another 30 minutes (being generous) for a tank that is actually tank spec and doesn't need dps gear
---
You answered that perfectly. That's exactly what I was trying to understand. I'll do more research based on that information. Seems to me that talent isn't worth paying for a respec, but I can understand how it outweighs the other 2 choices by a hair.
---
I've been leveling solely as a prot warrior AND solely with a shield the whole way up. Totally inefficient I know but I just want to be a tank. Problem now is, finding a guild that needs a main tank.
---
Its actually quite a pain in the ass to find a guild to tank for to be honest, because the spots are limited. 
---
As usual there is always a shortage of tanks, for dungs etc. Its the same in retail.
---
(EU/Skullflame/Horde if any one cares)
---
wait, there's so many alliance, i thought horde was supposed to be dominant across all realms? looks like not?
---
As a tank it just gets tedious to tell every fucking mage every single sheep, to wait with his frostbolts... And it's not just mages, dps just don't care and make it worse for the tanks. I just tank for my rl friends now because of all the babysitting you have to do otherwise.
---
Actual Tldr: Op admits makes a mistake on the auction house that was instantly punished by AH bot addon.
---
I'd say stick to arms. I tried switching to prot around 50, and while the tanking was better, the questing REALLY slowed down. I then switched to [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/embed/warrior/023050213325100031-04-532001104](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/embed/warrior/023050213325100031-04-532001104) and it worked just fine for tanking. You really just need some points in defiance to assist in holding aggro. The lower down in prot tree doesn't help too much imo for dungeons.
---
So I guess you guys don't have a problem with all the rogues and warrior rolling for your epic ranged weapons either because they are bIs UnTiL pHaSe 3 right?
---
I'm talking about mobs in general to be honest, for example I need to kill stuff for MC attunement :)
---
I'm sorry, but combat logs record when a new player enters the area around me?
---
That wouldn't do nothing against the most called problem of getting notified if enemy people stealth.
---
And the target functionality is as simple as it gets. It can even be done with a macro.
---
And Blizzard doesn't ban people for using an addon. If they have a problem with some functionality of an addon then they change the API of their addon interface.
---
not really. your whole point about ench shaman is imp WF... that's literally the only thing ench shaman have, but that imply imp WF is enough to compensate for the lack of damage they have on elem and all the utility they don't... and that's also assuming your melee aren't threat cap.
---
as far as nightfall goes... that's the 'special kid' job you give to your least reliable raider (who can use axe). hunter spamming wingclip, offtank spamming hamstring, ench shaman... who cares.
---
your ideal comp would be 4 resto sham 3 priest 1 druid.. no ench no elem at all... but if you must choose between elem and ench, it's elem all the way. Atleast he'll be usefull beyond threat-capping your melees faster and being a cheerleader on 3 fight (if you add ony)
---
No, I just got lucky with a BoE dropping and I pretty much just vendor everything.
---
Yeah. There’s a reason Blizzard is ok with writing tons of death into the story and quests. You do plenty of quests to kill stuff. You never get a quest to rape someone
---
Unless you jump out of the right window, and climb the dark wall there (just turn to the wall and walk forwards into the wall which makes you go left down until you start to climb very fast in almost complete darkness. From there switch direction and jump twice and now you are on top of the bridge, simply jump alongside down and you are on the other side of the still open bridge)
---
We're talkin about fuckin SM gear bro, for an arms warrior that is CURRENTLY tanking in group content while leveling.  Obviously max level gear is a different story
---
2, both retards, nothing is lost :D
---
If he got it from a pug run then it was fair game.
---
I mean, in gamer sociaty it isnt
---
If you talking about your parents then I doubt the games name matters
---
Dude you have no idea. As a resto shaman (with actual healing gear!!) The amount of times ive had to either keep a dumbass DPS pulling aggro alive or let them die because theyre not even targeting Skull (or theyre just absolutley nuking on pull) is crazy. Im getting sick of healing! I can barely imagine how stressful it must be to be a tank constantly fighting shitty DPS.
---
I healed strath and our rogue legit died 6 times because he kept stealing aggro right off the bat. I just stopped healing him after a while because hed pull aggro and pop Blood Fury (-50% healing). Its so stupid. 
---
A lot of DPS at 60 are impatient, rude, bad at their class, and in general do not understand tanking or healing mechanics in an advanced enough way at all. This isnt retail, i cant heal you for 90% of HP instantly while also keeping the not-prot-specced fury tank at full HP. Its getting really ridiculous too to where i might just level my alt instead of heal 60 dungeons. 
---
Legit had a rogue facepull a bunch and also complained we werent going fast enough. Its so frustrating and irritating. Like i already dont want to be there lol but i need gear and quests. 
---
Ive found the solution typically is just only do dungeons with friends on Discord but that is much harder to coordinate when everyone is an adult with jobs and families lol
---
Fuck hunters
---
I dropped enchanting for skinning about your level, best decision ever. I had 140g when I hit 40.
---
I'm currently leveling my ud warrior. Since it is a twink (planning on maining him asap) i bought some stuff from the auctionhouse to increase leveling speed. I'm lvl 41 1/2 and i have a Kang the decapitator, which i will equip as soon as i hit 44. So here are my questions:
---
- Can i play fury with it or is it just much better to respecc to arms warrior? I love playing fury with all those proccs :D
---
- i quested in STV and i wonder where to go next. Tanaris is a bit early to go i think... what do you guys say?
---
This is not a nochange, it's a change.
---
because you usually you don't have more than 3 melee groups and then stack the hunters in a different group. Maybe 4 or 5 has benefit, but not enough to warrant a elemental shaman. 
---
Also if you have too many healers at 5 shamans you still fucked up massively in your comp.
---
Nothing in the painting implies they raped her? Where are you even getting that from? What’s wrong with taking a hostage?
---
Specs don't matter in lvling dungeons. Tanks and healers should both roll on dps gear, and dps players that tank or heal often should get tanking or healing gear.
---
However. It is kinda bm to take a tanking item over the current tank. There is no way for that paladin to know that you expected to join the run the tank. In the future, just *say so*. Mention that you normally tank dungeons and would like to roll on the shield, right at the start.
---
He's not an asshole for rolling need on an item he needs
---
Plus you can force her to have sex with you.
---
“What steps are you taking to make sure your try-hard min/maxing at a 15 year old game that is based on a buffed state is still optimal?”
---
I love the statement, “hots in many raids are already banned”.  Just a big ol literal cup of wtf are you talking about?  Attempting to project out something that might happen in a vast minority of raids as if it is actually mainstream meta is funnier than kids watching YouTube videos thinking they are experts.
---
Possibly you? That bow sucks.
---
&gt; and top all logs! what do you think guys ? 
---
no you wont, its the biggest meme spec in the whole game.
---
For Dungeons its cool, but for Raids Oomkin is useless
---
Oh god i thought none really played the game anymore. Thank you for existing.
---
&gt;This is great! I met a lvl 34 dual wielding fury warr in Arathi the other day.
---
Some people enjoy the Dual wield fury play style more than 2h arms. 
---
Arms might be a bit slow for some people. Fury feels more fast paced. with the enrage procs.
---
Don't assume that just because someone is leveling as fury "They don't know their class".
---
2h Arms might be optimal, but if you don't enjoy the play style, it's not necessarily a better way to play.
---
It's a WSG trinket, so not until phase 3.
---
Half the time in my runs the skull dies LAST and the unmarked goes down first! I'm not talking aoe here either..
---
Do it. Got my shaman to 60 first now levelling a paladin and having a blast. Can you really experience everything azeroth has to offer without doing the 60 journey on both sides?
---
We are talking mid 30s, not 57-60 when you're getting raid ready.
---
OP stated they were 14
---
Mages think they have to use their whole mana bar every pull. Instead of slow and steady nonstop pulls let's instead pull everything nuke it and spend 2 minutes drinking after every pull.
---
As horde on bloodfang, i wouldnt call it under populated at all - and everything is on a single layer so its nice and cozy to see recognizable faces everywhere.
---
Lorewise the factions aren't nearly as stricts, or the people in them. If you read any of the lore or the books you'll have mixed groups working together. In the books people go into "enemy" faction cities to do business without being killed. Infact you also get people killing other people from their own faction too. So canonically the world... of Warcraft is more like free for all instead.
---
The meta for geared tanks is to dw. And they still keep a shield on them for smart swaps. 
---
I leveled 31/5/15 so by the time I got lbrs I had last stand and 1 pt in imo sb.
---
The problem is people don't understand when mitigation is good. If you want to learn watch some videos from skarm.
---
You say 5% but it's obvious you aren't accounting for block.
---
But it sure is good to get a tanking lesson from a priest. /S
---
Yep!
---
Installing it as soon as I log on tonight. Tired of getting ganked by Horde Rogues 15 levels higher than me. At least I will know if they are stealthed and can try to travel from my ass outta there ASAP.
---
I may have overstated their difficulty, my point is that it is such a pain and use so much time that unless you got the quest item, it is almost unreasonable for asking 4 person helping it.
---
oh boy wait until you meet stitches
---
Well that’s pretty fucken broken. Guess I’ll consider warrior DPS for the re-re-release of Classic.
---
Maybe it worked differently back then?  
---
Healbot still exists, but its not anywhere near as powerful as it was in vanilla when it literally did everything for you.
---
I hate people like this... If I need a ring or a piece of armor, I just roll need... Im a restoration druid and pretty much no good leather drops for me it seems, so Im always rolling on cloth with spirit and int.
---
who cares about DM? I want my mount :&lt;

Inspiration for priests, also not having certain gear enchants is fine for the time being.

Don't think that this sub is the best place to ask such questions considering local demographics.
---
not really \^\^ im still going outside to my office , getting out with friends etc but honestly i kinda like to stay home and play games haha
---
Only 24? Have you been leveling unecessary skills?
---
Feels good man. I didn’t find any crystals at all for two hours, and then I got two from a single vein.
---
Middle of the second paragraph he says “Despite me literally staying at the beginning I ordinarily tank.”
---
Lol had so many resto shamans ninja lately for their off spec. One took black stone ring from a warrior and me because “he had just respec’d an hour ago”. Not my fault bud, glad it ended up rolling two more times in a row.

[Dire Maul coming out week of October 15th.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/den4z4/new_developers_content_update/)
---
Rumor is that it will go active with the instance reset for MC, which is in about 90 minutes.
---
Purely a rumor, big grain of salt required.
---
Really wished there would be something like /r/CompetitiveWoW but for classic
---
Have you finished Badlands? I'd also recommend grinding some Zul'Farrak as well.
---
The game will inevitably change after phase 6, no changes has an expiration date.
---
 For now Classic is fine besides a few class bugs.
---
Yeah, I can handle tanking but I know I will never be a main tank. Thus, playing a warrior is unappealing because the cost to respec from DPS for raids to Tank for 5-mans sounds extremely annoying. I also don't want to tank on druid for 5-mans and then be a lower demand raid healer.
---
Honestly if I had the time to be a raid tank I would play tank without hesitation, but since I don't, I would rather just play a pure healer or pure dps.
---
At the beginning mostly, because there are three starting zones. But eventually they all merge together and there's basically only one path you can follow.
---
NEEEEEEEERRD! (jk, actually just jealous)
---
When you choose to roll, there are two options. "Need" and "Greed". Funnily enough, "Need" means you need something. If you want to add further rules into the mix, then that's on you to communicate that up front.
---
New wallpaper. Thanks man! This is dooooope
---
I feel ya, I prefer to stay in and game but my gf drags me out to socialize. Prolly a good thing but doesnt mean I have to like it lol
---
You are required to go to DM to battle for your mount.. you should care.
---
Yup. I rarely tank in pugs anymore, but I tank in pretty much every guild run I do.
---
I loved healbot when I used it in Wrath / Cata but it just doesn't work right in Classic. Doesn't pick up new party members occasionally, OOR fading doesn't work, clicks randomly don't work, doesn't save the correct rank of spells. I recommend the other options over Healbot.
---
Imo ehanancement shammys are ther worst :P  
---
But now i noticed ele shaman is a thing so.
---
as a lvl 32 prot warrior, when it being in prot spec required for tanking dungeons?
---
1 mage is enough to kite. and I'm assuming the other 2 DPS are being usefull and actually killing stuff while it's slowly walking toward the mage.
---
I will go to 60, got it now ... thanks...
---
Ah ok, probably later
---
The micro unit frames appear when I'm on a warlock but they don't when I'm on my mage. I didn't know if it was broken for mages or if I was doing something wrong.
---
I believe server transfer only allows you to transfer from your type to another of the same type. So PVP can only transfer to other PVP servers, same with PVE.
---
Sounds like you are in need of a balanced server with a healthy community. Come join Grobbulus (GROBMOB!)
---
Mine usually have 2 swings and thats it...
---
"Hey guys what's up its tips"
---
I play 1/29/21 Druid and mostly end up healing because it's my best gear by far now and I instantly get invites. So by OPs logic I'm also eligible to roll on Truestrike Shoulders, Hand of Justice or whatever heavily sought after melee dps item even though I agreed to join the group as a healer. I'll probably never get an invite again if I do this.
---
I rolled an undead warrior for pve. I'm 60. Am I screwed? Should I just reroll? Evidently orc is the way to go for the +5 axes. Is getting 9% hit impossible? 
---
I also went dual wield as soon as I hit 60. I know 2h is better until better gear, but I leveled Arms and I just got so tired of long swing times. I don't think I'm doing as much damage, but I just don't care at this point, it feels so much better doing damage faster, even if its less.
---
There is no implication whatsoever.
---
As a tank make the group yourself and do not invite other warriors. Easy. You are so rare you can even reserve loot if you want to.
---
It might be fixed now, I had it while leveling all the way to 60 on my lock and then when playing my rogue alt while gouge kiting but it's been a few weeks since I've farmed/kited stuff.
---
https://i.imgur.com/S1L6ooM.png
---
This was pretty much standard, almost every mob did 2 extra attacks on top of their normal attack. This mob has Trash so should only do 3 attacks at once. 
---
Sadly I don't have a screen of when I got oneshot because I wasn't ready for that but I was prepared for the next one :p.
---
oh, sorry. didn't realize you were a special 'RP' guy.
---
tell me how spamming for help in global channels works for you.
---
I've wasted far to much time ressurecting mages to agree with you.
---
Right, but that's not the same as stating that he joined *as a tank and expecting to roll on tanking gear*. Semantics, I know, but those are important when it comes to loot.
---
Im a rogue. Anything there for a rogue?
---
If you're willing, I would go to Auberdine.  The quests there are easy and pretty dense, will get you to about lvl 16.  Then Westfall will be a breeze.  Classic makes you bounce around unless you want to just grind mobs.  Good luck
---
we had had about 17 start the grind. 11 of us are left, 8 of which are 60. A lot of us played vanilla back in the day and the ones who fell off simply weren't ready/interested in the leveling grind.
---
It was the same deal there and Rogues did not win or even get to the finals!
---
I agree its a strange rule but it 100% does not mean victory
---
i hid the fact that i played it for the first 2-3 years, but one time accidentally left up the character select screen while i had a girl over - she saw it and was actually super interested in the game. stopped hiding it after that.
---
We're plus four right now, had two separate girl friends join in and our token Yankee had his flat mates laugh at him for playing eu servers, now both of them joined and are sat 7:30 in the morning in california raiding with us!
---
A majority has reached 60 and began raiding a few are in the 45-59 range, me and the token yank have our main and alt at 60
---
Maintenance is over but we still can't login Dire Maul.
---
That's my guess also.
---
I heal as a Pally every dungeon, currently lvl 44, in basically all cloth gear. I carry 2 sets of gear all the time. There is no way i'm only needing on Int cloth gear, l would be far too weak while questing.
---
However, often times I'm needing on Plate, mail, leather and cloth and get 3-4 upgrades in a run. Nobody has ever given me an issue about it. I just watch and see who needs on Int gear, then decide if I need it enough to roll against them. Minor upgrades i'll pass but major ones i'll roll against them. Plate dps gear upgrades I always need on, even though i'm healing in the dungeon. 
---
I don't think needing should be restricted to the roll you are playing in the dungeon. Especially if it's not lvl 60 Bis.
---
Will have to try this. Thanks.
---
They said they're up there with locks/priests, and another person said t1/t2. The other person was saying theyre one of the worst dueling classes.       
---
Rogue is 100% not the best dueling class, spec whatever but it's also definitely not the worst

The average price is 28000g?  That is not possible.

Here's the problem with your analogy: A Shakespeare play (he never wrote novels, thank you) was a complete piece. There weren't changes intended for it that never made it in. Vanilla WoW was a work-in-progress all the way until Burning Crusade. 1.12.1 was released a few months before 2.0. If Burning Crusade wasn't happening, there would've been more patches to vanilla WoW. Its existing bugs would have been fixed (and new bugs would've found their way in). 1.12 even had some major balance changes, so a theoretical 1.13 would've had some as well.
---
Vanilla WoW was a constantly-changing experience. What you're experiencing now isn't even that; you're doing 1.2 content with 1.12 balance (and that's why the game is way easier than it should be). So the entire mentality is broken. You're already playing the "upgraded" version of the game.
---
Also people *do* sell versions of Shakespeare's plays with modern language to help it appeal and make sense to a modern audience. Like, that's already a thing. It's a pretty large market, too. Helps kids get into his works.
---
Makes sense, thanks
---
Oh absolutely, I yanked most things in Wrath and Cata only DOSing when I had to. But I agree, with the difference in tanking mechanics, my lack of knowledge of dungeon layouts, inability to do things solo, and more are other reasons I don’t tank in classic. But those who do seem very passionate about it.
---
How much do they sell for? I'd check but maintenance... I'm making a lot selling those random quest items you can find on the AH.
---
wow, powerful message
---
Literally what he just said lol

---
They are banning hots because it pushes off other buffs. OP is basically asking about minmax advice on what buffs you should not be using in raids to avoid the good buffs from being pushed off.
---
Oh boy.. Thats a good question... \^\^  
---
We started planning to play with about 25+ friends and friends of friends however.. Actually we are 5 man left. Some of them are more interested in playing retail. Some decided to play the other faction. And some others had problems with the waiting queue and changed the realm. But most of them quit classic in between.  
---
I was so hyped to play with them all but thats just stupid.
---
I loved these quests.  Perhaps bc I was a bm hunter and there was very little competition but grinding mobs is super chill and relaxing for me as long as there isnt a lot of competition and pvp in the area
---
Same here.
---
Once that Chinaman was banned, they all jumped on the anti-blizzard bandwagon and canceled their subscription.
---
Funny thing is, they never once mention anything related to China or how, even in the slightest bit, support the liberation.
---
Cowards were just looking for a reason to quit.
---
i'm sorry if you are also a bad healer on top of grouping with bad mages AND bad tank.
---
those dungeons must be horrible.
---
DW on Alliance is a lot more dmg than 2h Fury. Just due to the lack of Windfury. On horde its debateable and depending on which weapons you get, but atleast after getting Deathbringer you'd switch to DW on Horde (again, debateable if you get Spinal)
---
and gets updated once a month, new characters every other month, world tournaments year round, etc
---
Get an edgemaster's handguard. 
---
If you really care about PvE, Orcs are the better fury warriors and trolls are the better tanks (I believe)
---
No don't reroll. As long as your plan is not to play in the top 5 guilds on your server no1 will give a fuck that you are undead
---
I bet when BGs come out and PvP strategies evolve you’ll see more discussion. It’ll also lead to twinking and discussion around that.
---
The whole changes/nochanges thing doesn't matter, as there's no voting system for content updates. Blizzard will do what Blizzard will do.

This is reddit, we are all fully t2 geared you noob :P

Subscribed!
---
Lots of warriors on /LFG looking for someone to tank their group, but then they roll on tank gear.
---
I'd argue, that depending on your current crit vs AP values, the extra crit would be weighted more heavily than the max 22 AP you would receive from a 2 hander. Not saying any hunters should get prio on this thing, but if its pug ms&gt;os rolls and they get it? More power to em.
---
Hey :) i'm in a long distance relationship \^\^ which sucks but it kinda helps when u want to play games haha

First thing I do when I come here is sort by new.

You can have someone outside the instance reset when you log out. Then when you log back in it will put you at start of instance
---
I'm going to install this addon just because it pisses rogues off so badly.
---
This is the true problem right here. The number of needed main tanks for raids is very small compared to the number needed for 5 mans. If you don't already have a main tank spot in a guild then your options are limited, and you'll probably have to make your own guild of PUG raiding scene.
---
Being the main tank for a raiding guild essentially guarantees you will get the best gear before everyone else in your guild. This means the spot is usually given to the person with the highest play time that gets along with guild leadership. If you aren't that person, you aren't going to be the main tank of a serious guild.
---
I forget how long it's been since I started watching him, hes the reason if I ever dont get my role when I play league I go movespeed annie...and that video is old as fuck now

heheheh the comment I was looking for.

Mirah's Song is an offhand weapon or a tank weapon.  This is a MH weapon.

You have to be joking with the term "very small area", right?!
---
Barrens Chat is Dungeons &amp; Dragons + 4Chan in a blender.  
---
It's so horrible it's funny.
---
cancelled because Blizz upheld their own tournament policy, nice
---
To a point yes.  Aside from lack of demand, the other issue that has held BoE prices low is the simple fact of not enough gold in circulation.  If DM generates raw gold, it will have an impact on the market.  The first items to rise in prices will be luxury goods, not your bulk bread and butter items.
---
You can't use Spy to target player while you are in pvp combat.

Living legends

I'm not sure if "deadlines" was on purpose or an autocorrect, but it definitely helps drive home the sentiment.

---
people are running MC mainly for Benediction, Rhok'delar, Sulfuras, Thunderfury, and recipes. the loot drops are largely side grades (and moreso with Dire Maul) as we've theory crafted the heck out of the game.
---
it was harder at launch, but BWL is coming and Vael will be the first roadblock to serious players. then we get to AQ40 and guilds will be blocked permanently from progressing, 1.12 talents/skills or not.
---
All of them. Was supposed to play with 5 other guys. They stopped at 35ish, I'm at 52.
---
So you get to decide what matters to other players then? I would assume most players that are minmaxing the buff slots are doing it for the fun of minmaxing not because they are struggling in MC.
---
Yes normal rules are that you roll for the role you are currently playing. If you want to roll for additional gear, inform your group before you join.
---
tanks get their gear first and gets bored of helping everyone else.
---
I really like that build. But is it viable at 53? I'd have to give up points in cruelty/defiance I'd guess. Should I wait to switch to that?
---
Keyring came with Naxxramas, didn't it?
---
I just typed into google wow classic spell timer
---
I mean for the second group of rock dudes. One quest has you killing the ones on the path and the second quest has you go toward the back of that area to kill the elementals a few levels higher. I just remember being so fucking giddy running to turn it in then being shattered when I realized I had to go right back.
---
I was going to play classic regardless if I had friends or not. But my ex and her brother joined a pvp server, ignoring my reasons NOT to play on one. So i joined them. They didn't even make it to 30. Luckily, I found a guild to raid with so I'm happy.
---
It's harder than tanking as prot, but still doable.
---
I noticed the level 60 screenshot was taken back in the crypt where you start. That's a cool touch.
---
I did something similar. I leveled a warrior so I took a retroactive video via Shadowplay every time I died. There's a lot of content. I still have to put it together.
---
Everyone needs a tank, but noone is willing to compensate geared tanks for their services.
---
There's no reason for me to be doing 5 mans at this point, but I'll gladly help you out if you make it worth my while.
---
I never did the WC dung. Its " more content to play ". Just because its content I haven't done, doesn't mean its good or worth my time. That's why I asked my fair question.
---
Also im a rogue, and most people here are saying its a dung mainly for casters and tanks can get the sword. So... seems like my question was not only a good question but also warranted.
---
"Week of October 15th".  So sometime in the next week.
---
It may just be coming with actual weekly reset in like 90 minutes.
---
Go smash through all the quests in swamp of sorrows and badlands, between all the mobs there that drop grey and the quest loot, you'll pick it up. Also those mobs drop mystery meat and wolf meat, the ones on the coast of SoS drop clam meat and occasionally pearls.
---
Im not sure. It was about a month ago. My next guess would be Scholo, it was definitaely one of the end dungeons with me being 58+
---
I believe its to split the cleave damage with the mt
---
Hey she's a foster parent.
---
There is a annoying downside, if the pick pocket get resisted you are knocked out of stealth and you lose your opener.
---
It sounds ridiculous at your level, but one of the smartest things you can do is cough up the gold and buy yourself some 14 slotters because they'll pay for themselves in extra vendor trash capacity in no time.
---
Do you think this is doable with a warrior?
---
I'm a feral druid and I love tanking. Easily my favorite role in a group. But that depends on the group.
---
As a tank, these two rules count for me:
---
- Only *I* pull. Period. 
---
- Focus fire one target at a time unless it's a trash pack pull.
---
- Temper your dps at the start of a pull so I can build threat 
---
How often do people follow these rules? Not often. And so you run into a situation where your group is composed of short bus kids with zero patience ... and that you have to let them die if they are making your job impossible. And that goes against every instinct a tank has.
---
THAT is why no one wants to tank anymore.
---
So now, if
---
But Peacekeeper is better than this for hunters...
---
The real benefit of stealth in a pvp context is the opener you get anyways, not the fact that you can remain unseen at a distance. The only part where stealth is truly useful as a hiding tool is when you're trying to stay away, but an enemy knowing that you're somewhere within a 150 yard radius circle of them really isn't that helpful for actually finding anyone.
---
messed up somewhere bro
---
How does that appear on the logs for him? Maybe I’m missing something and it’s probably a bit hard to relate to the original post as it was deleted but I’m not sure they are worth the spot even with the 3% crit buff. Of course they bring some utility but you’d take a resto Druid ideally for that.
---
Post a pic if you get it!
---
i really cant imagine being bored enough to do this
---
I don't know why you have two sets of gear at level 26.  You can do any role just fine regardless.
---
So because there is a chance someone who needs a BoE that is an upgrade for them actually ends up selling it, nobody is entitled to upgrades anymore?
---
Huge ninjapulls, nobody is dying and the priest is the moron for asking the warrior to equip a shield.
---
This also makes slow weapons that much important. 
---
I think it's a bad mechanic to keep.
---
he wanted the thread before this one lol
---
I like when the next pull starts when i have 75-80% mana so i can keep drinking while the Tank builds threat. Thennn i drop the AOE nuke
---
Those are pretty solid for level 20 gloves.
---
You really shouldn't fap during encounters or raids in general.
---
It's only good once he also has Core Hound Tooth and even then it's not much of an upgrade from Peacemaker or Barbarous Blade.
---
I just typed onto google wow classic spell timer.
---
I commend you for figuring it out on your own rather than following a recipe.  The only piece of advice I will offer is that when you hit 40 you will gain access to the bottom-most talent in each tree which is only available by putting all 31 points in the same tree.  These talents tend to be quite powerful so I would suggest looking at each one and deciding if respeccing at 40 is worth it to unlock one.
---
Mages charging for water, does that actually happen?

Unless you want to avoid deep nesting in the future when there's a table of results.

At a certain point you should just be using a map with helpers to define ranges though.

**\[A\] &lt;Vanilla&gt; - NA-Incendius** **PvP** **| Tues/Thurs - 8-11pm EST | Semi-hardcore/Semi-Casual** 
---
**About us:** We are a very large and social guild looking for any and all new members! Our main focus is raiding with a strong side of PVP. We have around 400 players but it feels like a very tight-knit community. Everyone is willing to help out, regardless of what it may be. Our core raid group is being developed right now, so if you need a guaranteed raid spot with a fun and active guild (and you're level 55+) definitely consider joining our discord! We have members in the voice chat every day. We are aiming to start raids Tuesday, October 22, 2019. 
---
**Our plans before October 22:** Currently, we have a solid group of level 60s who are pugging MC/Ony as we wait for more players to hit 60. With Diremaul coming out today, we are going to have multiple groups running it. We constantly have groups for BRS/BRD/Scholo/Strat going pretty much 24/7. So that, along with recruiting and trying to help players get pre-raid BiS is what we have planned out before we get to raiding. Feel free to join up if you'd like to experience DM runs with us before you commit and we go bigger! 
---
**Leadership:** Our guild leadership includes a wide variety of players. From Vanilla old-timers to modern retail leaders to private server veterans, we try to create a diverse environment within leadership to get as many viewpoints on guild subjects as possible. Our raid and class leads are extremely knowledgeable and have held leadership roles for years across all versions of the game. 
---
**Raid Times:** Tuesday/Thursday 8-11pm EST (Working on creating a second group for weekend players) 
---
**Loot Rules:** For the first few runs, we will have a loot council for tank items. Everything else will be open /roll. Obviously, all the council items will be announced BEFORE the raid. We would like to be as transparent as possible. From there, we will move into EPGP or DKP (with decay) once our tanks are geared up. This will allow us to progress faster and get faster clears with a geared out tank. 
---
**What we expect from you:** Be respectful to your guildies! Other than that, be present when you sign up for raids and be online before the raid start time. Our guild is very tame and friendly, we hope you will be too. 
---
**What you can expect from us:** You can expect a friendly and helpful environment which is focused on teamwork and enjoying the game. You can expect leadership that is vocal, transparent, and willing to help out their fellow members. Most importantly, you can expect to enjoy your time with us. 
---
**Contact:** If you are interested, please join our discord: [https://discord.gg/jnPMg2d](https://discord.gg/jnPMg2d) or feel free to contact us in game or on (discord):

Greft (Greft#4536,) Zen (Zen (Jayco)#2658,) or Phion (Phion#1698)

Yeah it's an extreme amount of effort for someone to run through an instance, talk to a 4 guys, and hearth.

It's a dungeon that you can spam and farm...raid is only available once per week and you have compete with a ton of people for the gear, IF it even drops

Fiery weapon is more than a care package. That's like having a battle tank parachuted in

You saying this made me think of my own time with this game:
---
I've played WoW in 3 decades of my life -- 30s (38-40), 40s (41-42), and now 50s (52).
---
Nope. Fastest, easiest and funniest place to level in the game. Like that term?
---
I found a workaround, see my response to WhoTookNan.
---
As a warrior just dont fight anything or do any quests that arent green. Makes life much easier.
---
Killed people all the way to the front door.
---
No one opened the front door.
---
Prime example of citizens uniting under the banner of stupid!
---
You’re definitely reading into it too much. It launches today.
---
I was vendering perfect scales from WC from back in the day till last week.
---
Then I found out they sell for 25 silver to 50 silver each in the auction...
---
I vendered so many over the years...
---
It starts to matter more in later dungeons where pack skipping becomes very common.
---
One talked up classic for months on end, hit 60 relatively quickly, and then quit without trying any kind of end-game dungeon or raid content because he "wasn't really enjoying it". The other just hit 51 with me and is still trucking. I had a few acquaintances who seemed excited to play but I don't think any of them made it past 20 or 25, with most not even making it past the first few levels. One was deterred from the queues during the first few days of release and hasn't bothered to log in since even though we've told her there haven't been queues for a long time.
---
Another friend's guild has had some minor drop-off, nothing crazy and they are still pretty active. But said friend hasn't been logging in anywhere near as often since hitting 34/35.
---
Go on wowhead and look at the drop tables.
---
Pretty much never. Prot is mostly saved for main tanks in raids.
---
shrug, if you're farming them then its more than likely you'll see every item that isn't ravenger so many times that you'll be vendoring everything you win on greed roll.
---
Hold up, that's a different quest? Blasted lands just has the 5 quests to collect parts from various beasts roaming the entire zone, and there's tons of people farming them. The quests are repeatable and reward items that give +25 to a stat for an hour, and are used for some librams so you're going to have 60s grinding them as well.

Firstly, questing and quest rewards are going to be your best method of cash inflow post-40, as most of this takes a large jump.
---
Money-wise, the best method is to farm elementals in the Arathi Highlands. They drop a quest item needed for the warrior whirlwind quest, which can be sold for up to 50s per item. Remember to sell in stacks of 8, however, because that's all they need for the quest. You also get  Elemental Fire, Elemental Earth, etc. some of which sell for 1g each on the AH, and these all have a pretty high drop rate.
---
If you have skinning, Yetis in Ferelas are great because they are tightly packed, they drop money, and also can be skinned for heavy leather (sell) or thick leather (to AH).
---
How is it better for melee DPS?
---
and here I tought the 'rathe councilmen' event in EQ1 was the worst possible raid someone could think of, as an enchanter...
---
Me, as Horde pleb bathes in the envy of +Might +10% stats BRE swings.
---
This is a problem that exists in retail too where threat is a non issue, so I doubt it’s that.
---
I’m nearly positive it’s just players being scared of having any form of personal responsibility besides having their dps be good. But I like talking in classic so sign me up for those 3-4 pms an hour asking me to tank ubrs even if I’m in winterspring lol.
---
I don’t think most guilds will bother with DM buffs since the raids are so easy. On private servers DM buffs were a nice crutch for casual guilds but in Classic even the worst pugs are clearing MC no problem so there’s no need for the DM buff hassle.
---
Rape isn’t implied. She looks more like a hostage, or that he’s about to kill her too since he’s wielding a bloody knife and exposing her neck.
---
"God I fuckin love being a rogue"
---
subscribed!
---
That is correct, they still come as per normal, but have to also walk up the whole path, significantly increase the time until they arrive at the fighting scene.
---
They're definitely wrong for AoEing too quickly, but you can shore up your rotation a bit. Deep prot actually isn't all that great for 5 man tanking with the current AoE meta because the extra threat you can deal is mostly single target. But, it's still perfectly viable so no reason to go respec.
---
Tclap is not useful for threat generation. You can only use it in battle stance which naturally deals 80% threat. It also has no threat modifier, meaning the only threat it generates is from its damage. I'm sure you've read the tooltip and can see that the damage on it is pretty pathetic. 
---
For packs like that I recommend starting the fight with berserker rage then charging in with a 2hander and using whirlwind. WW also has no threat modifier, but the damage is much greater than tclap, so more threat. After that you want to switch to sword and board and defensive stance and pop bloodrage to get yourself some rage. In a pack that's a few elites and several nonelites I recommend you completely ignore the non elites. Your group should AoE them down in short order and keeping threat on all of them isn't worth it unless you see 1 or 2 beating on the healer. Just focus on the elites. 
---
In a perfect world you'd be able to use Shield Slam and Revenge on cooldown on your main target while tab sundering inbetween to keep threat on all, but there's almost 0 chance you get enough rage in a normal 5 man pull to do that. So I would try and open with a single shield slam on your main target then start tab sundering. Hopefully you at least have enough rage to shield slam again on your main target, but that may not always be the case.
---
That's what's written there, so, probably bad data?
---
E-mails received from Blizz specifically said it would be today.
---
Never treat DPS ( any group) as all the same.  If you want a successful run,  it means taking charge as a tank if you have to, though I love when the healer leads the group,  (IMO, they should). 
---
A tank that decides to take a bad group and “just have fun” is just as bad as a bad DPS.
---
You do not need to Raveger tank to hit the instance cap on Arena/Anger runs.
---
Everything you described is exactly what this post is saying is a problem lol. When tanks have to constantly adapt to DPS not doing their job correctly then they get burned out and tired of tanking. I feel that burnout as a healer as well, in some ways. Theres a legitimate problem with how some DPS do not wait for threat or AoE on pull. I've definitely noticed when a group is good and when a group struggles because every pull is super inefficient.
---
Even the Peacemaker is a better weapon that this for hunters.  It's a waste.
---
Azerothian crystals dropped from 30g to 2.5g on my server feelsbadman
---
It's really easy to suck at this game and not know it.
---
It's also really easy to be great at this game and be fully aware of it. 
---
The details count people! It's not about how fast you kill something. I'd rather take 10 seconds more to kill something and be able to chain pull continuously only stopping to top off before a boss, then just exhaust my resources after every freaking pull.
---
I completely agree with you. Dagger Fury was a very interesting thing to play in AQ
---
Just spam trade chat, that way nobody notices the transaction actually happening.
---
You don't pay my sub!
---
A mage that actually decurses on the fights that need it is more than good enough to go into MC.
---
Make sure to have decursive and deadly boss mod add-ons and do what your raid leader says on the bosses.
---
The only mechanic you really need to know about in advance is the Barron geddon bomb debuff. He makes one player "the bomb" and they have to move away from the rest of the raid before they explode and do damage to everyone around them. Pay attention to that and you'll be fine.
---
The thing that annoys me the most as a tank is that apparently every single dps knows all the ways in a dungeon better then me.. skip this, kill that, aoe this blah blah.. i mean if you know everything, just roll a tank yourself.
---
I got a career that puts me on a 70+hrs work week. Guess Battleground Twinks is all I'll have. Someone play the worlds tiniest violin for me, cus I'll never get to raid.
---
isn't organized raid kind of the default assumption here?
---
and heck, even if it's ms ­­&gt; os ... do you really want to get shit-listed as a hunter this early on?
---
WUT
---
Plus you have to level the worst leveling class!
---
What @theycallmebrewkid said. Addition: With a fast OH and slow MH you can easily hit the sweetspot to queue your HS and cancel it after your OH swing now.
---
Just keep playing the game.  You get more gold from quests than you would just farming mobs.  There's no point to drop what you're doing to farm gold for a mount when you'll earn enough gold in a few levels anyway.  
---
Just stop buying things.
---
I'm thinking about changing servers from Noggenfogger to Ashbringer/a more populated EU pvp server.
---
Noggenfogger feels somewhat empty when im looking for groups for dungeons, which is why I want to move.
---
This is my first time playing so I'm not sure if the server really is "dead" or my expectitions are too high and moving to a more populated server will hurt me on the long run(at level 60 dungeons/raids/farming etc, im currently level 31).
---
Any thoughts?
---
This. Revenge is by far the best threat/rage. Shield Slam is close behind it, but since it puts out a ton of threat, if you have the rage, its better than revenge. Sunder is what you use when those two are on cooldown.
---
There's no shortage of tanks for raiding tho, and if you're just OTing you can do that just fine with DPS spec
---
Baaaby shark
---
They play like 10-15 hours a day, gotta make your own fun.
---
I've been told when MC / Ony is due to restart, but that was by someone who came online for Dire Maul, so...
---
Precisely, and people that specifically leveled up as a Prot get pushed away into DPS so never really turn back to Prot from that. 
---
I know that making a guild is the best way to secure a Main tank spot but creating a guild creates so much work I just am not interested in at the moment. 
---
I'm just hoping someone will give me a chance to main tank, I've certainly got a decent background given that I was a raid leader for a CE team on retail. I don't think that even particulerly helps anyone. 
---
Its a shame its this way where there is no simple route to tanking in a guild. Guess maybe I'll have to pug for a while until someone takes me :p.
---
this is hilarious
---
9%. 6% as orc with +axe skill and wearing an axe.
---
Dw isn't bis until you can enchant 15 agi to 1h weapons which won't even be out for a long ass time. Taking that from a melee where it's bis right now is absurdly stupid when you have access to rhok.
---
classic lack of communication from blizzard, it very well might not come out at all today
---
Yah, but this is like 1 in 20 or so, so it's worth it.
---
im the only one of 4 friends who still plays
---
I feel like an asshole but it might be what I start to do moving forward. Yeah I can do Strat Live but there’s no reason for me to do it. First orb reserve and we’re good
---
I think you hit the nail on the head. Druids are fortunate enough to have viable "hybrid" specs, but Warriors are forced to choose one and stick with it - or constantly pay to respec.
---
Are you chewing gum?!
---
Hard to flood the supply with arcane crystals. They were already being farmed 24/7.
---
that must be horrible boring for the healer. always having full mana is a sign that you should pull bigger packs to clear faster
---
Stacking hunters in a group wastes Trueshot Aura and healers and casters benefit greatly from having a shaman in their group too. A valid argument could be made to bring 8 shamans to put one in every group, honestly.
---
You didn't fuck up, just for the future I'd just let them know in advance when the loot drops like "Hey guys this is an upgrade for my dps/heal/tank set, I'm gonna roll need on it ok ?" just so they can't be like "omgwtf youre a piece of shit ninja blah" . That's one thing I'm lucky for rolling a warrior right now, I always just tank dungeons for quick groups but dps upgrades are basically still tank upgrades at level 29 lol
---
Yeah you kinda did. It's not that you can't roll if it's not for the role you're playing.
---
Wether you're healing or tanking, you're probably leveling as a Feral. So you should roll on everything that upgrades your Feral gear.
---
Wether you're healing or not, you should ask the tissue classes if they need the item before rolling as it's just something you do as a side business to do more dungeons.
---
At least that's how I do things myself with my druid.
---
In a lot of guilds, people put more time in to acquiring their buffs than they do in the actual instance.
---
Banning HoTs and Inspiration-like procs is a real thing. 
---
I would actually bet a tidy sum that it is the mainstream meta in raiding guilds.
---
HoJ, Windfury or Thrashblade procs reset your swingtimer and immediately consume the heroic strike. No problem when fully buffed in raids but can result in some unlucky ragestarved situations if not careful with BT/WW usage.
---
Once you get the hang of the stopcasting tap it becomes second nature and makes a noticeable difference.
---
Reminded me of the animation canceling and auto attack weaving in Elder Scrolls Online.
---
I like how everyone is defending their use of this addon. Sounds hella cheese too me. Like healbot. Another add on that can go Fuck itself.
---
Yeaaaaah idk, what’s the meta for Mara right now? I am skeptical of a drastic change in gold.
---
Decursive is just a crutch for people who are too lazy to set up their raidframes correctly. It's literally just a row of boxes and whenever one box changes its color you click the box and that person gets decursed/dispeled/desicked whatever.  It's even better than in vanilla because now you can priotize people yourself instead of hoping it decurses in the correct order. The only advantage over raidframes is that you dont need to setup your mouse over decurse button yourself.
---
No homo? Lol...
---
Classic was released not quite two months ago. Guess it is too late to make a warrior.
---
Decursive still allows you to click a small button to decurse a target.
---
That's bullshit, see above for my take on this.
---
I was debating whether or not to resub. Then this Hong Kong shit the fan. Bye Blizzard!
---
It bascally is bug abusing yes. But it's allowed.

&lt;Adventurers Wanted&gt; NA East - Windseeker

---
I'd call us a small guild, approaching medium. Adult atmosphere that can get a little rowdy at times.
---
Discord is available, but not required at this time as we have not yet begun raiding. However, we have some good veteran experience in guild and most members have expressed a desire to raid.
---
We have a handful of 60's and 50+ members, and are working to help our other members reach level cap as well as get some pre-raid gear. We plan on starting raiding ASAP, with our main hurdle being finding enough players to fill out a Saturday afternoon/evening raid.
---
If you have any interest in joining us I would be happy to hear from you to answer any questions.
---
This is part of it. I want to tank, but at most you need 5 tanks for a fight (Sulfuron and Majordomo, maybe) in a raid, so a lot of warriors go dps. They are still able to tank dungeons no problem though. But everyone else here has more than adequately described the reasons they don't want to.
---
It released 5 months after initial vanilla release and rag hadn't been killed yet?
---
I'm fury but sometimes tank lvl 60 dungeons. I inform the group that fury is my MS, so I'll be rolling on DPS gear. If there are any other warriors in the group, they usually ask if it's alright if they roll on tank gear then. Everyone agrees and is chill. If not, I find a different group.
---
If I join as a tank, don't say anything about rolling on DPS gear, and then roll on DPS gear, I would not be surprised if people got upset with me
---
I always wonder - how bad must a person be at the game to literally fail at picking a quest reward?
---
Did we say October 2019? We meant June 2020 - CLEARLY O-o
---
Yes, if you happen to get the leaf sure you dont need any new ranged/melee weapons till AQ, but that wont be for a few weeks as you wont be the only hunter in your raid.
---
Trolls and orcs are both amazing races. Troll is good for PvP and great for PvE where orc is the best for pvp and doesn't give anything useful for pve usually. You won't regret either and should choose which one appeals to you most visually or lore wise. Troll just feels less serious than orc so whichever suits your personality you'll probably enjoy more.
---
Tauren just isn't as good as either stats wise. It's not such a big deal that you shouldn't pick it if you like them thematically but there is some room to regret rolling tauren if you later decide to optimize more.
---
The people disagreeing with you must have leveled with all the slow bad mages and alts or something, magetanking packs 3+ should be standard for the most part, especially while most people are still imp blizzard. I've been doing it for a month now and you should never take more than 1-2 hits unless somebody pulls when you are oom.
---
1 Hit and 3 Agi, vs only 1 Hit.
---
Yeah, I just got a message from people I was planning on running it with today saying it's not available? Ion went on record saying the 15th, so what's up?
---
People who think smoking weed is a personality are pretty awful.
---
Go to westfall
---
Best course of action - regardless if it's reasonable to carry 2 sets of gear at lvl26 - is to announce at the start, that you will be rolling on healing and tanking gear as well and if everyone is ok with that.
---
You need to be a blacksmith/engi/rogue to open some of the doors I believe.
---
First, you don't need any prot warriors to clear the current raids.
---
Second, I'm not sure what point you're making but I feel like you're agreeing with me?
---
That you have to hope drops (easy part) and than win against all other hunters in your raid. So its not a moot argument based on Rhok'delar until you have the leaf.
---
Why isn't this flagged as satire?
---
Low level herbalism materials sell like crap.  You have to wait until blindweed and fadeleaf to start making money.
---
Can you solo clear the coffer room as a 60 rogue?
---
Please, elaborate.
---
Yeah the bug was in the game but with none discovering it and then abusing it, saying that the game is the same with people spamming this macro changing their gear around it and maximazingtheir dps is the same as vanilla is quite a stretch. Makes no reason not to fix this shit but guess blizzard doesn't know what no changes means.
---
Wow, it's taken less than a week for you people to come out of the woodwork. I'm impressed.
---
Just quit your job.
---
None of my have dropped, but they have been on private servers for the better part of a decade... so I assume it’s more expected for that crowd not to drop.
---
the barrens is amazing. have you ever been to Westfall?
---
It is really sad to me to see the retail wow mentality of "fuck everyone else, gimme whats mine" instant gratification bullshit creep its way into Classic.
---
I'd still go for Arms for the occasional PVP that will happen
---
\^This. Prot spec is only useful if you have dps that outgear you and you're main tanking a raid boss. Beyond this specific scenario, you're better off as fury/prot or even pure dps fury spec. If you don't raid, arms actually has the highest threat of the three specs for dungeons with the use of Sweeping Strikes.
---
Now if the alliance only realized that Van Cleef did nothing wrong
---
Spy shares *your* coordinates if you use the announce feature, not the enemy’s. That may be where the previous commenter is getting this misconception.
---
Also - Blizzard, unknown little starter company; all is forgiven. But just imagine how embarrassing it would be if they were a company with 15 years experience still failing at such basic communication :|
---
If there are black lotus in dme, it will just lower the price alot. Kind of like AV lowered the price of black lotus on ND.
---
So when there's hardly anyone there you don't have to kill anyone? What am I missing here
---
Here's the problem. . .
---
I range pull, then Lord Gigadick does something and the whole pull goes somewhere else.. . guess who's not getting rage because nobody is attacking him. Secondly, revenge doesn't proc because . . nobody is attacking him. Lastly, Sunder has no CD revenge has a 5 second cooldown.
---
Rage based tanks need the whole pull to hit him a couple of times in order to get the rage necessary to hold all of them. When someone else pulls, or they start aoeing in the first few seconds. . no rage. .and the tank might as well just sit.
---
Hoodwinked I tellz you!
---
This is weird.
---
That macro just seems useless, as you can simply press your Heroic Strike/Cleave ability a second time before your off hand has swung and it would cancel the impending strike. Since the default ability is a toggle itself. When you press it, it gets highlighted and stays toggled until the swing happens.
---
So what you're saying is, you should time your manual control over heroic strikes for each off hand swing, to make it hit 100% of the time. While someone is busy watching a swing timer (which in most cases, we're talking about an off hand weapon with 1.3/1.5 second swing speed) and trying catch all off hand hits, I'll be focused on just doing my BT&gt;WW rotation and just putting in an extra heroic strike or two in there.
---
Just looks weird and too much of a hassle for very little to no gains.
---
Actually that is only true for low level demons like imps or felhunters. Imps are happy to work with anyone who lets them break shit and felhunters are just animals.
---
As for higher level demons, if you don't suggest them a contract or they refuse to accept it, when you first summon them, it will take immense willpower to keep them under your control. Even if they do accept your contract, you still need great willpower to keep them from slipping from the contract.
---
If you are crazy or stupid enough to summon something like a doomguard, it will most likely just kill you immediately and return back to the Twisting Nether, unless you manage to convince it of YOUR loyalty and pledge your service to it.
---
Well, there's two issues here. One, feral is garbage so you shouldn't be rolling any DPS items anyway. Second, healers are normally main spec heals in all roles, whereas Warriors are expected to do all 3 roles simultaneously.
---
50% drop rate with an average of... 2-4 hunter per raid?
---
that's about the best odds you can hope for in MC... even druid and warlocks have worst on their tier stuff.
---
Km new to classic meaning never played Vanilla.  What's in the chest? I mean what's the big loot people go for?
---
If you're having problems with respawns that means you're not killing the mobs fast enough. Try to only kill/grind mobs that's equal or lower level than you. If you're going into a high density mob area avoid charging in and pull from range.
---
Have you done your WW quest yet? If you haven't make that a priority. The axe is absurdly overpowered for your level bracket and you'll be melting mobs and players.
---
Some people really crave the Barren's chat.
---
You can actually tell if the boxes in Strat are trapped or not. If you walk close enough and hover your mouse over them it will say requires disarm trap in the tooltip if it is trapped.
---
Can this group clear SM: Cathedral?
---
Priest (40); Warrior, Mage, Rogue (38), Warlock (35)
---
We've done the other wings of SM easily so far.
---
My 46 hunter is logged out nearby, bring it.
---
I got a pretty neato blue dagger for my hunter, so I'm happy with the place.
---
This. I have no problem telling people I play WoW but I don't want to tell them I can't make it because I have a raid that day.
---
Orc is good for PVE melee.
---
i have tanked every single dungeon in the game without wearing a shield. my class cant even wield them
---
It is basically an entire guild of unrepentant social pariahs lol.
---
the amount of times that this actually matters for mc is 0
---
+1 for Hinterlands. I am the guild armorcrater mined a good 800 mithril up there. Easy grind.
---
I believe the philosophy behind going skinning while leveling is that you can make some decent coin vendoring the stacks. Leather is absolutely everywhere as you’re leveling up :-)
---
Very helpful. Perfect for what I want, effective tanking without completely limiting myself while out questing. Thank you a ton, gonna switch to that build after work.
---
&gt; It's even better than in vanilla because now you can priotize people yourself instead of hoping it decurses in the correct order
---
Sounds like you didn't know how to setup priority and ignore lists in decursive.
---
Yep, u could do the most fire ass job with super clutch heals and they will think that's normal and can pull more cause it's "going well" but in reality u doin more downranking and button mashing/ thought processing than any of the pew pew dpers just to keep everyone alive
---
There’s tons of level 25 warriors where I’m levelling. Like for elite group quests/dungeons we could be 3 warr, 1 priest and a random dps. What is the situation in 50+?  It’s si bad I’m considering rerolling.
---
&gt; Though they will certainly spike this week, as bars are needed for mounts.
---
tho at the same time there will be more thoriums being mined cuz some spawn in DM
---
All of them. Everybody I've met in the game and added as friends hasn't logged on in at least a week.
---
I don't think Vale will be much of a guild breaker as he used to be. I think pretty much everyone will be able to clear BWL (or at least get 7/8).
---
AQ40 is where it'll show who is made of the real steel.
---
Would you like to have 8 shamans in your raid? sure, but does it mean it's worth to bring 7 healing shamans and 1 elemental shaman? NO.
---
It's still better to stack hunters than it is to bring a fucking elemental shaman.
---
I don’t know but people spam that they’re buying all stacks at 1g+ constantly.
---
Because lvl 40 is when I plan to do quite a few ‘expensive things’. I plan to respec to shadow and level up my tailoring so I can get dream/shadoweave gear early while it’s still OP. I’d rather get my biggest expense (ie the mount) out the way so I’m not encumbered by it in the back of my mind....if that makes sense.
---
Its a bit of bad manners, you can just roll for every gear for every spec your class has. It can be annoying since you are rolling on gear that will help their main spec which is why they most likely doing their role in the dungeon, while you are taking the gear that you will "hope to use".  It makes for example healers have less gear to someone who heals only rarely. Its generally okay if you ask beforehand.
---
The latest "theory" is that it resets when MC / Ony does" - but its a dungeon, not a raid? so who knows
---
Most Boss armor is around 3700. So with proper Debuffs Boss' will have 0 Armor, devalueing BRE in PVE. Then again, Orcs want to make use of their weapon skill in PVE, so they want Spinal over BRE and 2h Fury isnt really viable on alliance side.
---
My opinion: BRE = purely PVP
---
Nope, only when a stealth ability is detected in the log.
---
I do have it but I've been around yellow mobs rn, gonna move towards greens after reading these suggestions
---
Shakespeare was not even a real person, those novels were written by a secret society under a pen name.
---
To preface, I never reserve anything in groups I run. 
---
But I'm not sure what the hate is on stating something is reserved up front. I guess people are just salty that they see a group for a dungeon they want to run but can't join because the item they need is reserved.
---
Making your own group with rules you enjoy is always the best way to go.
---
Definitely use livesplits. It's the standard for speedrunning games. You can customize the splits anyway you want and set your split key to something you don't use in WoW and it'll record the split without having to tab over or anything. Most logical splits would just be to split after each boss dies.
---
But people did cross
---
Used Gnomish Mindcontrol Cap, and the rogue served as my minion.
---
They can be anywhere.
---
This is amazing. Fuck the haters.
---
What are the best “aoe” threats gen then? The shouts?
---
Damn bro, sounds like something I’d do haha
---
I'm on Westfall and it seems to have a good population.  Chats always filled with people forming groups for all level dungeons.  Just a suggestion.
---
Yeah exactly. I always wanted to tank in classic and I'm fond of it (tanked since bc to WoD where I stopped playing). I spend hours to farm miserably outside instances and can't find anywhere to raid even if I'm better at playing than some other tanks comfortably established in guilds.
---
But yeah, I can find a 5-man PUG easily... That's why I will respec to DPS, because I want to see raids, and not only 5-man dungeons :D
---
Dual-spec would help in this case...
---
With raid buffs it's an easy build to pull off p1. Guild MT runs that build and had no issues dual-wield tanking Ony last night.

Deadmines has loads of great loot!

Skinning was a bad choice it seems... best hides non mafia is war bear leather ive seen so far and that’s 50s 🤔
---
I've been hunting the robe of the archmage in LBRS. Has a 16% drop chance and there are 3 mobs in the dungeon who can drop it. I've run it 9 times and literally have never seen the pattern. I could understand the frustration, but don't be a dick to someone. Just yell at your computer if you need to
---
Nice man, I am kind of losing the will to play my 50 priest.  Currently shadow, would like to respec and heal for BRD + after a couple levels, just bored getting there.  Playing my alt mage has been pretty fun.
---
You are right. Even though I have this working, a couple weeks later and I hardly play like this anymore. Mostly just to check mail or small little things
---
You do realize that even a month of farm (even if this sword would drop every week) isn't even close to enough for all melee dps having it?
---
My server is doing fine as well, no need to worry. Stop trolling/being a stupid jerk.
---
This. I don't like to reserve loot, but I definitely will avoid classes that can use items I want. Typically, this means no rogues, hunters, or other warriors.
---
None because all my friends hate wow.
---
A chunk of them have stalled because of one thing or another, but im looking at 5 or 6 people that will be 60 soon. I hit it a few weeks ago and have been pugging MC/Ony, doing recruitment and leveling alts.
---
Yeah they’re sapping the fun out of the game tbh. Go with having fun and reading quests. Immerse into the world rather than get a ton of addons that do the thinking for you. If you want that environment go to retail.
---
Are quivers and ammo pouches interchangeable?
---
Ie can arrows go in an ammo pouch/bullets go in a quiver?
---
You can't heal a dungeon in feral gear lmao... The difference between an agility set with 600 Mana at lvl 16 and an int set with 1500+ Mana is astronomical
---
if you get the chest 12 times, you can turn in a quest to receive the arena grandmaster trinket which absorbs a decent amount of dmg when used
---
That's at level 60.
---
When leveling you just roll for the loot you're actually going to use outside of the dungeon.  Being 60 is an entirely different story.
---
Are you entirely sure about that? I would bet bringing an ele or enh shaman to provide buffs to a group would add more dps to the raid than bringing another mage that'll do like 200 dps more.
---
But really, that doesn't even matter. Molten Core is already easy for pug groups in blue and green gear, why are you worried about min-maxing it?
---
Lmfao well ya know; the device next to the PC is pretty evident of what kind of bar your in :P. Plus coming from someone who has lived in a state his whole life that still is a no on any form of medicinal or recreational use of the plant, I’m pretty sure I’ve never seen one in a public bar 😂
---
well there are many that are just strange to you because they are rare and you don't know anybody that is named that way. what makes aragon stranger then, I don't know, matthew ?
---
If I were you I'd just up in arms and then switch at lvl60. The problem with the prot spec is that it basically kills you're questing ability.
---
No
---
MS before OS for certain, but make your intentions clear in advance. if you were a cat drood who got wrangled into tanking or healing or something, tell everyone that you'll be rolling on all leather agi items. the flip side of this is that you have to be ok with others rolling and taking items for your OS.
---
What lvl do you need to do dire mail? I'm 51 warrior?
---
Orc if enhance or ele, troll if resto or ele. Orc has ace specialization which makes them op in every aspect if you are planning to melee.
---
Typical Alliance player having it completely backwards.
---
I rolled Horde so I could powerlevel from 11-24 in a matter of hours, all while shit posting relentlessly.
---
My warr is sitting at 46 because I got a bit ahead of my friends who all quit in their 30s. :(
---
This is my first time playing a warrior , but tbh from everything that I've read you'll be fine. Like someone else mentioned, there's the edgemaster's handguards which provide extra weapon skill, but at the end of the day the only people that would exclude you from a raid group for being an undead DW fury war is probably the top 5 most min/maxing guilds on your server
---
That sucks
---
Guess what i saw like the second time i went UBRS? :D
---
Nope, they can only hold one type of ammo they are designed for
---
Interesting, I guess I stick with my big Axe on my Orc and continue with Arms until I get to 60 and can loot a few BiS items ;)
---
Woah dude, I've read badlands this entire time. Just ignore me!
---
Damn, that just sounds miserable.
---
You need to level them up and train them accordingly.
---
That sounds about right. I'd use the 1% crit gloves for now, and if you get gloves with any decent amount of agi (over 5-6) then equip them and compare. If you get at least 0.5% crit, it's probably worth it.
---
Looks like an old school, sega genesis game advertisement
---
Hey man some like to speed run
---
You're over my head now. I'm just a hobbyist.
---
Right, I forgot about blessing of light, that felt like a game changer when you got it.
---
If you hit 40 without enough money for a mount I'd suggest you just keep leveling as normal. The gold you earn per hour will start to ramp up at higher levels, so you may as well keep working towards that instead of stopping to farm mount gold.
---
Also in my experience you'll earn more money per level by solo questing/grinding instead of running dungeons a lot, especially if you have gathering professions.
---
Free market, baby. The only limit to what you can do is what you can get away with.
---
This was so fucking awesome thank you!
---
Satyr's Bow for both; Fel Hardened Bracers and Redoubt Cloak for tank

Swamp of sorrows has a real high density of herbs and beats to skin.
---
Hi, /u/Foundtheclosetcase
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/di907j/anyone_have_a_list_for_bis_pre_raid_and_mc_ony/). 
---
How useful are Alliance boomkins for buffing Hpaladins?
---
Try to get the pauldrons from ZF they're pretty good with str and stamp on them if I recall.
---
I personally stay as far away from uldaman as I can
---
I'm the other way around. Disabled, no IRL schedule really. It's nice to have a reason to know what day of the week it is.
---
But I realize I'm a very select case.
---
Yeah, unless you're maintanking 40-man raids you don't really need to be prot.
---
The problem isn't necessarily that nobody wants to tank, there just aren't enough tank spots in endgame.  Think about this, while leveling you need 1 tank for every 5 players in an instance.  But during raids when there are 40 people, do you need 8 tanks?  You only need maybe 3 prot spec tanked, so everyone else is going to go dps/heal and try to gear up for their role.
---
Doesn't sound as broken as even I thought it was, then.  Being a pally with all your cleanse on one button eliminates the decision making part at least :P
---
&gt; So about the same functionality as a mouseover macro. I mainly like it for the notification sound and separate list of debuffs.
---
This is why my wife uses it.
---
Go to swamp of sorrows, specifically to the Misty Valley. Kill swampwalkers/elder ones/terror things.
---
They hit soft, have medium HP, low armour, but do have a druid renew type thing they pop at about 400hp left, but you can easily out DPS their heal if you forget to interrupt them. They drop a fair amount of silver, a wide range of herbs (including swiftthistle, and fadeleaf) and a fair ammount of greens.
---
Why don't people weapon switch to 2h when OP procs?
---
60
---
How did you level your priest in 6 days? Currently im at about 3 days played at level 31.. it’s starting to take me around 4 hrs per level.. any tips?
---
yellow mobs are -2 up to +2 of your level. I suggest equal and down to -2 if possible. Don't try to tackle orange quests however tempting it might be. Practice pulling with your bow/gun and with experience you will now when you can pull only a single mob or a bunch of them. 
---
Tip: Mobs will only get pulled as a group if they're the same type so you can pull a spider next to a humanoid without aggroing the humanoid, for example. Unless one of them is the other's pet i.e: warlock with a voidwalker.
---
Used for PvP and tanks?
---
My s/o’s father has a work-anywhere-IT job. We all love playing together but his time to play is during the day and then wife and kids need time in the evening. 
---
We work during the day and play afterwards. We are either getting on as he gets off in the evening or are going to bed when he gets back on. It sucks!

---
LoL to each their own I guess
---
None of my friends are 60 yet. And they're all on different servers :D
---
Well, astronomically high numbers are always there, so Im wondering if there is some trick to how its supposed to work.  It seems to be the only site that gives any info on AH value
---
Haha sounds like a plan!
---
I know what you mean though, I've been taking my time not even remotely trying to be efficient. I've not even got any addons installed, so no quest tracker; have to read everything and figure it out myself. Is good fun! 
---
I'm not overly fussed that I've not even near my mount. I probably could have focused more on it but my profs would be much lower then they're harder to deal with in the future. Money becomes more plentiful in the 40-50 bracket should be easy enough to get.
---
Honestly, this is a much better PvP spec: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500132133025141-22505003002](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/500132133025141-22505003002)
---
Last point can go either in Holy Nova (good for group PvP), Imp renew 3/3 or Imp fort 2/2.
---
You want to have Power Infusion to be able to burst targets down when needed. It lets you be a formidable 1v1 every 3 minutes, which right now is pretty good considering there are no BGs so engagements are spread out over more time. Martydom+Healing Focus make sure that you are able to get heals off without a peel and martyrdom adds in interrupt resistance, plus has the benefit of letting you cast offensive spells without push back. You want healing focus though because you don't want to have to wait to be crit to be casting heals with a melee/hunter on you.
---
If you go into Shadow, go for shadowform. Otherwise, stay out of shadow.
---
I watched youtube vid of this yesterday.  You can indeed mind sooth your way with one exception.  There is one spot where you need to MC an ogre and let 3 others kill him.  There were questions as to whether or not that would put you in combat with the 3 ogres on classic or if it was a peculiarity for the vanilla server he was on.
---
Mistakes will be made wether you're a respectable druid or not. And I like when my mistakes don't lead to a corpse run.
---
I agree with this 100%.  Only roll for upgrades you're actually going to wear outside of the dungeon.  
---
When you get to levels 30+ we're talking like 3-6 hours per level for a normal person not spamming dungeons or AoE farming.  A dungeon run takes like an hour.  You want to gear up for what you're playing 90% of the time, and not the 10% that you *might* do.
---
2 dropped, 4 stayed but 1 is slow.
---
&gt; oh, sorry. didn't realize you were a special 'RP' guy.
---
Don't go ad hominem on me, please.
---
&gt; tell me how spamming for help in global channels works for you.
---
I'm 60. I answer the calls, I don't make them.
---
Why is it so hard for you to acknowledge that if "bored 60s can ruin a zone", bored 60s can also defend it?
---
Killing lowbies is much more boring than hunting down and fighting back the scum that attack lowbies, don't you think?
---
But I'm a small time buisness owner, job there is not. Only life there is. Quit I can't unless bankruptcy I get.
---
*insert surprised ~~pikachu~~ Yoda face*
---
This logic is so flawed.  Similarly, using aimbot doesn't make it okay just because it uses built-in game mechanics.
---
Black dragon somew is the one for the bow that drops a very high chance from ony..
---
Blue ones if for quiver. We are talking about weapon here.
---
Honestly if you really need the mount, STV mobs vendor for pretty good gold. Also crawfish runs in Desolace. However, I would just keep questing. The gold picks up after 40 and you should enough gold naturally by 43. Please don’t spend money on training besides what you truly need, it’s a waste of money on your way to 60.
---
Dang, I'm jealous. Anytime I have asked questions on my new server, I don't get any responses. It seems like most people just stick to their own and can't be bothered.
---
LetMeCast
---
My main (rogue) has Alchemy and Engineering, and I'm trying to figure out what the best class would be for an alt with Herbalism and Mining. What do people here suggest out of these options?  
---
Druid  
---
- Druids are fun and flavorful  
---
- Stealth might be useful if I'm running around gathering things  
---
- Lots of role versatility if I ever play the alt  
---
Mage  
---
- Much faster to level  
---
- Ability to solo money farm stuff that druid isn't able to  
---
- Redundant to roll a second dps character  
---
Forget Alchemy and just go Engineering and Mining on main  
---
- Saves a bunch of time leveling an alt
---
you will have better luck posting on the forums or the Bigglesworth discord then on the classicwow reddit
---
I feel that I just hit 49 and I’m burnt out of my mage so I rolled a Druid. Now I feel guilty not lvling my mage to 60....
---
Onys reset timer starts on kill. Its not a set time like Molten Core.
---
On my server nobody looks for tanks, its so weird. I was spamming lfg for 40 minutes yesterday, but I did not find a group.
---
I think my server is still in the 30-40 range... Well, that way I can level my druid, but its so frustrating. Should have picked a different one.
---
This couldn't be farther from the truth for a druid.
---
Rogues are a dime a dozen for DPS who want the same gear as me, also shaman who don't wear their mail. Also, early gear that would carry you through is in instances no one runs anymore like Wailing Caverns. Of course this is from the Alliance perspective.
---
This looks like a "yall ready know TF is goin on" picture when absolutely nobody does
---
You might think that increasing your OH damage by 15% is too much of a hassle, other people disagree.
---
The benefit is massive.
---
Yeah I’m not leveling again. I’m fine lol
---
Please continue to resort to ad hominem after everyone shit all over your arguments
---
Have someone invite your alt, log off, invite main, then they can leave. Log on your alt when you finish and reset. Log back on your main and it will be fresh.
---
Check out Titan Panel (addon) or look on Wowhead (just google wow classic uldaman drops)
---
&gt; And the marking standard is
---
There is no standard marking beside skull = main target. What happens when you have two of the same class? Just communicate it at the start of the run. It's one sentence and might save you a wipe if you have someone with a different "standard" running with you.
---
"skull = kill, moon = sheep, green = banish; feel free to CC adds/pats without a mark". 
---
Or "moon = mage1 sheep, green = mage2 sheep". Directly call out the player's names and their symbol instead of a simple "moon &amp; green = sheep". Say which player has to sheep which symbol (you can then forget about it).
---
Calculations have been done, it's just not enough on long fight were you go OOM.
---
But Boomkin brings way more than DPS so it's alright :D
---
The price jump will probably be delayed since you can't convert crystals into bars at will. And at the same time people will be mining lots of thorium nodes at the end of DM:E.
---
How is a pve server one of the last servers to get an item from doing pve stuff?
---
There ya go! Its personally working really well for us right now -- bc were also able to get a feel for what we need as we go. We'll see where things go once we get "the majority" to endgame.
---
So names can't be too long and also can't refer to last boss. You're just making up rules now.
---
I think it’s hilarious how mad people are getting over this, not just this post but the idea that someone would fight another player that isn’t exactly their level and fully buffed and healed before starting the fight.
---
The duel system is in the game for a reason, for honest fair fights that have a clear start and finish you can prepare for. Everything else is you getting jumped while you kill tigers, or you jumping people while they kill tigers. If this makes you unhappy why in gods name would you roll on a pvp server?
---
I always chuck my hearthstone first - assuming I am close enough to a FP.
---
Many people dont realize that if you destroy your HS, when next you go to an Inn, you just get another when you bind at a location.
---
and if you are forced out of the instance (due to lack of group) I believe you are automatically ported to the faction capital. 
---
but on topic - I deleted a handfull of 5s things before realizing i had several stacks of conjured water and food ... felt so silly.
---
So I'm 300/300 fishing with big iron rod. Where are some good places to fish and what should I be fishing for?
---
Source?
---
SGC?
---
Are there diminishing returns on polymorph?
---
It was added in 1.11.1, way after the DM release.
---
You don't buy items with honor in classic.
---
Mate thank you so much!
---
Yes I'm quite sure.
---
And I'm not worried. I just don't want to give some slacker a free spot and I want to group for the entire game not just what's decent right now, I don't want to swap around my entire roster every 3 months.
---
Then get a new tank, I tank, but I honestly believe healers should be the ones in charge.  Healers are executives, tanks are management
---
Cool, glad it works for you. 
---
What your missing is that at maximum level, Warriors tanking gear increases their survivability without actually increasing their threat by much. So you have two choices:
---
Allow DPS to constantly pull aggro; or increase your threat output to mitigate that problem.
---
It’s hunter bis. 
---
These posts are pointless. If it’s a pug mc run, you roll if it’s your bis. The same way you see rogues rolling against main tanks for the band of Accuria.
---
If you think that camping flight points is good world pvp then I'm sorry to say it's not dead yet.
---
I like my beefy raptor strikes when people waltz into my deadzone and FD/Trap fails...
---
I second this, just keep leveling. I got my mount at 46. I could’ve spent more than the time it took me to get to lvl 46 grinding mobs for mount gold. Then I would’ve had to level up anyways. Don’t waste your time on grinding gold at those levels. Quests and mobs passed 40 give a lot more gold.
---
By level 40, there were plenty of quests giving 80s or so just for completing them, plus grey weapons and greens are starting to vendor for 1g+. It adds up fast and keeps going.
---
The Nicker is the secret pro budget pre-BiS for orcs. You ain't seen windfury slaps until you seen 4.0 speed axey boys. Just gotta hamstring fish for those procs.
---
It's a fairly good chance of dropping if you got a group to swing on by the mobs that do drop it on you LBRS runs.
---
Westfall had the same thing last night
---
When people see bar prices rise, they buy up crystals so it will still be synched.
---
Something something steamed hams. 
---
Delightfully devilish, Seymour. 
---
Gib award for funny please.
---
Wow my server in a reddit post.
---
Funny how pussified the community is now compared to real vanilla.
---
Westfall is definitely an awful zone. I get depressed when I'm there.
---
Nah, it's the same
---
Would be a world first if any APES person got a job in real life.  
---
Monkey news has been playing wow classic in his mums basement for 15 years straight.
---
I just want to be in your guild....
---
Those 3 points are better spent elsewhere. I like imp cleave for dungeons if you're running fury prot, but I dont really recommend fury prot for a fresh 60 tank anyway.
---
Those are kind of silly things to complain about, honestly. They're in their original state for people who want them that way and they can be updated for people who want them updated. Just get a quest log addon and turn on the class colors in chat, problem solved.
---
(I adjusted the text for US timezones)
---
It’s not confirmed.
---
I only rarely tank anymore (prot warrior for 5 years of vanilla/retail and exclusively through level 50 in classic) for your first two reasons.  I’m tired of teaching DPS how the game works.  If you pull aggro off me by going nuts, ignoring marks, face pulling, not letting me LOS pull when I announce what and where I am or use AoE like a dummy, that shouldn’t be my problem. If a healer throws a bubble on me pre-fight or right at start or starts throwing HoTs before my first hit, that shouldn’t be my problem.   
---
But it is.  So I just DPS now - Arms warrior is a blast.  Tanks are grateful for one cooperating DPS.  Also, I get to enjoy the game again.  It’s a shame.  
---
Also tired of being den mother/cruise director - hunters don’t roll on staffs with intelligence as primary when a mage is rolling need,  I shouldn’t have to monitor all buffs and when they run out, etc.  it really sucks because tanking endgame, particularly as the dungeons get more complicated was once the best part of being a tank and why I tolerated the excruciatingly slow leveling to get to 60_
---
Wowhead DOES show average silver drop

Grinding mobs gets WAY more lucrative into mid/upper 40s.  I was grinding some tanaris ogres for a quest (level 46-47) and it was at least 10s per kill between the coin drops, cloth drops (can always craft bandages and sell, don't forget!) and the occasional green.  10s is conservative, probably morelike 15s.  
---
Beasts can be lucrative too- turtles in tanaris are level 43-44 and all drop valuable greys, skin for thick leather (6s-7s apiece via AH), and drop turtle meat which is a common cooking reagant and a quest item. 
---
Quest rewards are also at least 1g apiece starting in the early 40s. 
---
So if you restrict spending now you will accumulate G much more quickly, if you avoid putting points into professions or just sell some of your extra mats.
---
You need an Eye of Sulfuras (1% or lower?) drop rate to even complete Hand of Rag. It comes down to luck.
---
I'm also curious about this. All I've read says you need to make an int set for holy nova spam, ideally woth over 7k mana. Is this true?
---
Every 3 hours starting at midnight.
---
Every 3 hours 12,3,6,9
---
Wrath had the most amount of players because of how good BC was.
---
yes, as it interferes with people's dinner and family time. 
---
most guilds have raid times like 19:30 till 23:00, so adults can have a family life and then daddy can go raiding.  He can't  get on at 18:40 to get to DM, he is putting his 3 year old in bed. 
---
and you need people to actually CLEAR it before, so they have to start earlier still.
---
I have been in both types of guilds, the buffs every raid kind and the 'oh my this is nothing for us....'  kind...   Trust me, there are more people in the latter tye.......
---
After Blizzard added a protection to the SendWho() command Ceron257 came a around with a really nice workaround that introduces semi automatic sending of who requests.
---
To enable this feature install the latest version 0.8.1 of the addon and then go into the CensusPlusClassic options; at the bottom of the settings page enable
---
Send who request on mouse clicks in world
---
Send who request on mouse clicks in interface
---
Don't forget to do a /reload after this
---
After activating this settings who request will be triggered
---
on mouse clicks in the 3D window (like turning the camera with mouse, interacting with things in the world, clicking players, loot mobs etc.) and
---
on mouse clicks of most of the clickable buttons in the interface (this includes action bars as well, so no macros are needed to issue who requests by simply casting with the mouse)
---
you can tank any of the 5 mans with the raid dps spec
---
Until ???
---
Hinterlands for Squid (coast) and Nightfin (interior lakes).
---
Azshara Bay of Storms for most everything else.
---
Or you just kill them because they are low level
---
I have a quest tracker just because it is really useful to be able to find some of the quests especially the ones back in the capital cities that I would never know were there otherwise. Definitely simplifies the questing part itself though when it basically points you where you need to go for the objectives.
---
The only thing I regret is that I didn't try and hunt down as many Darnassus quests as possible while leveling my Gnome, although I am a mage so that would have been awkward since they don't have a mage trainer in their starting area I don't think. I just really like the Night-Elf mount the most of all the options.
---
Hi guys can someone help me with the wowclient?
---
Im not sure if its possible but I\`d like to know: I used to play LightsHope back in the days and now im looking forward to migrate to blizzard\`s wow classic
---
Do I have to download the game again from [battle.net](https://battle.net)? Or I can just change the realmlist? (or get the battlenet client app) like we do with the private servers
---
(Btw I play in a macbookpro) 
---
I dont know why i cant dl the client from the official website, so i just wanna know if i can play anyway using the game i have previously installed while I was at Lightshope.
---
Thanks in advance
---
Basically, if you are running with 3 mages you are just there for pulls, soon as the Frost nova comes out. get away from the mobs and let them deal with it so you are not taking unnecessary damage. Once you get into ZF your job changes slightly. you need to focus down totems. But mages have started to realize they dont need us, and invite a 4th mage instead to do ice block pulls. 
---
Rotation is just Charge and demo shouting initially, you are going to lose aggro!
---
 If you are running with a non Spellcleave i do the following, Charge&gt;Thunderclap or Sweeping Strikes into WW (at lvl 36), If you are going as 2h arms, Juggle sunders/revenges out as rage allows. 
---
If you do marks. don't bother with skull for more than 1 global/taunt back. The dps are gonna go Apeshit at the start of a pull, learn to accept it. It will almost take longer to wait for you to build 100% threat than it takes to kill a pack.
---
Focus taunts off the squishy people, Healer&gt;Caster&gt;rogues. Let warriors get hit.
---
I normally think reserving loot is OK, as long as it is clearly stated upfront.
---
That said, yesterday I say a guild being mocked for attempting to get people to join their Onyxia group, but the Pugs would only be allowed to roll on the bags.
---
Whenever I hear someones aspirations days before a game comes out, I usually just ignore it, saying something and doing it are very different.
---
Everyone seems to have such big plans about maxing out, grinding, and being the best of the best at everything. 
---
Yeah, okay guy.
---
that IS a good lesson to learn.
---
the group i started with is still going strong. 3/5 members are 59 or 60 and 1/4 members is still leveling (with a fuckload of alts) only 1 person quit to the best that i know.
---
but each of us picked classes we liked instead of trying to pick things too fit in with eachother. our current goal is to make alts and lvl as a team then. this is a far more reasonable version of what alot of people did.
---
because we atleast made it to 60 already
---
&gt;I didn't say anything about not allowing hunters to roll on BiS gear, where did you even get that from?
---
" If all the melee already have them then great, pick them up, but it's just not worth caring about for a hunter. "
---
You can see where I 'got that from'.
---
&gt; No dps ever want to manage their threat. Before I even auto attack the mob the dps unleash.
---
The amount of times a hunter serpent stings while the arrow I'm pulling with is still in midair makes me want to scream.
---
&gt; and if you are forced out of the instance (due to lack of group) I believe you are automatically ported to the faction capital.
---
You are teleported to your hearthstone set. I literally did this last night from the very WC run I mentioned in the OP. I had dropped my hearthstone to make room, and when the run was done, I left the group. After 60 seconds, the system teleported me to Splintertree Post in Ashevale -- where my hearthstone had been last set. (I knew this would happen, from previous experience, before dropping my stone.)
---
you have very very low chance of gettting a main tank spot unless you are in with the leaders tbh 
---
a lot of gear gets funneled to you as main tank, you being a random makes this a bigger risk than it has to be
---
Darkshore comes very close.
---
4/6 are still playing. The 2 that fell off did so after 4 days. Everyone is at 60 raiding since the first month
---
Not on npcs
---
No waaaaaaay... I want to lvl up a NE priest  just for this...
---
Ive mained tanks my entire time playing WoW, which is Vanilla through BFA, and I can genuinely say playing Paladin in Classic is the most miserable fucking experience I have ever had in WoW.
---
Ret is fucking miserable trash, seal, judge, seal, oom. Great Spec, if you are solo dont plan on keeping that judgment buff up because you are gonna get parried to shit.
---
Prot is miserable due to horrific mana issues too. Consecration is expensive, Exorcism drains you against Undeads, Holy Wrath is a 2 second cast time so don't even think about it. To top it all off, the spec doesn't have a taunt.
---
There was zero logical decision for letting Paladins have more than 1 spec in Classic, all the gear and set bonuses are designed around being Holy.
---
I wanna fucking die playing Classic Paladin.
---
I know exactly what you mean.
---
And I love it. First time for 15 years I don't have to fear that I leveled the wrong class because they are going to completely fuck up the rotation with their next "rework". Or they are going to add jousting. Or daily quests.
---
It's great know that there's no Blizzard that thinks "hey, they seem to enjoy the game. LET'S COMPLETELY CHANGE EVERYTHING THEY LIKE"
---
Ah my mistake.  I am thinking of Blackcrow prior to the stat update, it orig only had 1 hit no stats.  Either way, the weapon is so nice for hunters I would personally pass it to a hunter.  Just as if I were a hunter and satyrs dropped I would pass it to melee as I have a much better ranged weapon to get. (Same as if strikers mark were to drop in MC, it is a melee oriented ranged weapon and any hunter who tries to take it doesn't know what gear is available to them). You do as you please tho.
---
Does he drop cool stuff?
---
It actually IS ok
---
it's just a game man
---
sometime unexpected shit happens
---
I think they trolled themselves.
---
OK thank you. Squid? Don't think I've seen a cooking recipe for them yet
---
Damn, basically make wow your life?
---
The only issue tanking I have is telling my dps to stop aoeing the extra whelps before I have full rage during the Rend fight. I know Skeram has a large PS population which could contribute to why I'm not experiencing these issues, but I rarely see people complain about anything.
---
As a first time mage I try to take my role seriously. I NEVER aoe right the second the tank pulls a pack, and honestly I won't unless there's more than 3 mobs. When I do aoe I only do it under two circumstances, A) I've given the tank 7-10 seconds to build enough threat or B) the skull marked mob dies. Yes I don't necessarily top the DPS charts, but I don't really care, I'd prefer a smooth dungeon experience.
---
To all the tanks out there I know how hard your job is, and I respect it. You dictate the pace not me. Thanks tanks!
---
Orc or Tauren for PvP, Troll for Ele or Resto PvE, and Orc for Enhance PvE. Idk why people sleep on Tauren so much, they are way better than Trolls in PvP and with War Stomp as a shaman you can use it to combo into a ton of other things like Stomp into Fire Nova and many others. Also while leveling using Stomp then the 1sec ghost wolf and running away will save your life and time a million times on the road to 60.
---
You can only see either herb nodes or mining nodes on the mini map at one time, so I would suggest not having both.
---
Tanking in vanilla is just super stressful. You need to LOVE tanking to tank dungeons and raids, expecially pugs. And since every class that can tank can also play another role, most people who could tank prefer not to.
---
Why don’t you just join a no life guild and not run with pugs?
---
i think its ok
---
shut up man im level 29!
---
Usually your primary job is to pull the mobs together. Take a look on the mobs which are running out of slow going attacking the mages and taunt the ranged attacking mobs. Holding aggro of all mobs is impossible.
---
I dont see the big deal with them expanding on zones they originally had planned for Vanilla that never made it to launch. New dungeons, new zones. Doesn't mean they need to raise level cap, or even add something completely new. There is plenty of old ideas like I said didn't make it into the game back in the day. Not to mention a BG didnt make it either. Sorry I'm bad remembering names or I would of been more specific. 
---
New atunement (questing, reputation, gearing) and game mechanics on dungeons n raids is all I want.
---
its really only twice but i feel you \^\^
---
Nah, people want someone else to do the dirty work of finding a tank, looking for people, leading the group.
---
And if you reserve items then you are evil. If you don't invite them based on class loot competition that's being a baby too, grow up and care less about loot. Let me take a free ride to get the item I want or else.
---
Amazing work, man!
---
&gt;We didn't start raiding until last week because we were waiting for our core to get 60 and get attuned.
---
That's fine.
---
&gt;We didn't kill Domo/Rag because we didn't have enough quints.
---
That's fine. But you said you only got 7/10 when you can do 8 without douses.
---
&gt;And yet the people who complain loudest about not killing Rag have not even started their hydraxian quests. 
---
And you should educate them on their lack of effort and remove them from the guild if they don't correct themselves. Allowing toxic members to fester is on leadership.
---
&gt;So I have no illusions about how we stack up to a hardcore raiding guild.
---
The thing is I'm not talking hardcore. PUGs are regularly doing 8/10 in one night with many then doing domo/rag the next. You've got to give people a reason to stick around instead of bailing to a more hardcore guild or just pugging.
---
&gt;I guess I remember there being a much larger group of players who were content to play at a more casual pace. Perhaps the mentality of the player base has changed.
---
It has. Most vanilla players had no idea what they were doing or what was going on. The information available today and the more hardcore base of Classic means average player performance and expectations is much higher. Maybe if Classic takes off like vanilla did we'll see more "casual" gamers start playing.
---
&gt;It's seems harder and harder to find people who are willing to put in the time to build something from scratch rather than just guild hop endlessly until they get what they want.
---
That has always been a problem. It's not one that "hardcore" guilds don't suffer from either. But the hardcore guilds have an aura of success and that attracts people to jump on the bandwagon. The real test of hardcore guilds has always been what happens when they run into a wall.
---
Listen to yourself. Just take a second to read over what you just posted.
---
shield looks awesome, what’s it called?
---
Why so salty? The vid is fun, enjoy it.
---
Wasting people's time is the only reason I play this game.  Stop trying to take that away from me.
---
so should AH sniping addons
---
like TSM
---
You'll have to be carried for mirahs, though.
---
Thrash might be doable at that level with a higher group (or pay 10g to someone to run it for you)
---
This is great, but inst accurate for a holy priest specced into Spiritual Guidance - this talent converts 1 spirit into 0.25 +healing and adds significant weight to the spirit stat for deep holy priests.
---
Can you make if then macros? Specifically can I make a macro that will put me into aspect of the cheetah if im in aspect of the hawk and aspect of the hawk if im in cheetah.  
---
Additionally can this default to Hawk if no aspect is chosen?
---
Please allow me to mention a very good strength of a hunter for gathering professions.  If there is a mob that will agro if you're gathering a node, just send your pet in and let the mob chew on your pet as you gather the node.  Then kill the mob and move on.  Mages can sheep most mobs, but not all.  As a hunter, you could also feign death and run away on food while your pet is still engaged.
---
Only in PvP I think.
---
On bigglesworth as alliance I completely avoided STV and Stonetalon, heard it was a war zone so went elsewhere lol. Basically hit up every other zone except shimmering flats on my journey
---
Nice!
---
54 should be fine.
---
Does your macro switch to beserker, change to 2hs, whirlwind, then switch back to sword/board and back to defensive stance?  If so I would love some guidance for this.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
---
How solid is Sage's guide?  I'm level 18 with it and feel like it's amazing.  I want to do a couple levels of dungeons soon though.  Would it be easy to pop back to the guide, or will I miss too many chains if I skip a zone?
---
&gt; Hard to flood the supply with arcane crystals. They were already being farmed 24/7
---
You do realize Dire Maul has guaranteed rich thorium spawns right? The supply will absolutely get flooded.
---
Level of effort &gt; level of entertainment
---
dont lie you watched it to the ending but you are just embarrassed
---
Uhhh that’s how the Internet works.

Hijacking top comment to [link to Blizz announcement](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dire-maul-releases-at-10-00am-pdt/333837), it comes out 10AM PDT or 1 hour 40 mins from now
---
Leveling a war now (currently 40) becuase I wanted to learn to how to be a good tank. But everyone is in such a rush I have zero motivation to tank unless it's with ppl I know.
---
that's the thing, you just kill all the mobs weather they are for the quest or not
---
DM comes out tomorrow?
---
I haven’t gone to that extreme but when I was doing the WW quest at lvl 30 I didn’t have anyone offer to help me, I had to buy the charms off the AH and pay a hunter 3g to help me kill Cyclonian. So when I was lvl 48 grinding ore in Alterac I got a whisper from a lvl 31 warrior asking for help and I said of course, ran over there and we downed him in no time. He was very appreciative.
---
Yeah sorry I assumed all three posts were in the classic sub since its classic content. My bad. But you should probably post it again incase anyone didnt see it
---
A lot of people definitely had nostalgia glasses on and forgot how big of a grind classic is. What do yah know, the average person needs an experience more like retail, I for one am shocked, shocked i tell you!
---
I mean like, having your buddy stop over after work or something. What's so hard about saying "Hey man, I'm doing this dungeon, let me finish this up first?"
---
This is the cheese method to make the fight significantly easier.
---
Now do warrior.
---
You will not get my innervation anyway, you filthy Horde priest!
---
(More seriously, if the raid dps is good enough, you, as a priest should not have mana issue and therefore could be used elsewhere)
---
Don’t worry, I actually read it but I was just making a point that it’s an exceptionally ignorant statement.
---
Oh haha, thanks
---
I actually misspoke. I tried a couple other swing timer addons that I wasn’t very satisfied with. Ended up turning off the red bit and just watching my character's animation. Got the hang of it pretty quick.
---
The ones who I played vanilla with and lived through it are all still on board, the ones who joined after vanilla and never played it who talked big about playing are all gone lol
---
Unfiltered autism: the post
---
This kind of thing is probably why classic will die out, honestly. We've gone too far with deep-diving into the systems and shit. BIS lists have already essentially killed the 60 dungeon crowd, because you only do the bosses you need and then never set foot in theinstances again. Once the game passes a point where you "need" ridiculous macros and stuff to do basic attacks, I think we've crossed a line. The hardcore will get bored, and the casuals will be overwhelmed.
---
Ah well, it was a nostalgic couple of months.
---
Now i tell you a little secrer. You could wait a bit longer and sell them for about 70-90g later on
---
Part of the problem was they changed their minds between beta vanilla and launch what they wanted to do. I mean priests had a melee spec at one point. Thats why theres all the +str and +agi cloth as well as caster daggers that have on hit procs.
---
it really does not, mc is not hard enough for it to matter so unless you are trying to set records it simply does not matter
---
I had something similar going for the satyrs in azshara. I was in the southern middle camp just going in circles killing everything, and basically one mob was always spawned and the next would respawn right when I killed one. If someone did out tag me a banish or 10 was enough to drive them off lol. Also proud to say I even held of a 2v1 invasion from the alliance, then basically after effectively corpse camping them they fucked off too.
---
i stopped tanking because people are toxic as fuck if u mess up a pull, i have not tried tanking as a prot warrior yet but as a fury i can not keep aggro in dungeons at all. 5 stacks sunder and i still lose aggro from the mages/warlocks.
---
Yeah, I love when I come to STV to do 2 quests and get camped for 2 hours because of some dwarf priest
---
This is what I was banking on. First week of the game I spent 50g and bought 25 of them, and now they're selling for 8-10g on my server and I'm holding out for even more.

No, usually everything is going just fine when the mage decides to aoe everything in sight and pulls agro on the off targets.

---
Haha yea losers
---
&gt;begins 6th hour of mindlessly browsing reddit and other social media
---
Not worth it without horde chat.
---
Most warriors go DPS at 60 because you only need a couple of tanks for the raid. And when a tank finishes collecting everything he needs from dungeons there are only 2 motivations left to run dungeons.
---
1. Help friends
---
2. Get some gold since you are still running around with your slow mount while every dps has an epic mount.
---
I don't understand why so many people hate on tanking services to be honest...it's a good motivation for a tank to give his best. He gets the gold he needs and the rest get their gear.
---
yeah I forgot all about smoke breaks. I switched to vaping, but I must admit I was guilty of those. I'm a hypocrite!
---
&gt; cause bored lvl 60s can ruin a zone.
---
I never said they couldn't.
---
What I said was that...
---
&gt; If "a few bored 60s" can "ruin a zone", your faction is weak and its members deserve to die.
---
...that's the reality of PvP.
---
A strong faction can certainly "ruin a zone" if its level 60s are bored and have nothing better to do than gank lowbies, while the weaker faction's level 60s are unwilling to provide defense and support to its lowbies. No doubt about that.
---
Yesterday, we had a guildie who was getting ganked in STV, we sent a 12-man raid to annihilate the Horde. Other people who were questing in STV thanked us for getting rid of them. Once we were done there, we went on to the other end of the Eastern Kingdoms to rid EPL and WPL from Horde, too.
---
Obviously, that doesn't mean every call for help is answered, but while you focus on the problem, some of us focus on the solution... Another solution would be for people who can't handle and/or don't want to PvP to play on a PvE server.
---
This is Blizzard, no one knows shit.
---
Yeah, pvp flags if you go into enemy territory
---
Most servers have individual Reddit subs (ex. Rattlegore) -- its where as a GM I would post my recruitment notices since people on other servers sure dont need to see them.
---
I thought this was going to be a joke post based on the title. Nope, it was exactly as pathetic as it seemed.
---
No you can't. You may not be playing at maximum efficiency, but everyone enjoys the game for different things and tailors their playstyle to it.
---
Dude, as a hunter I couldn't possibly agree with this. I'm not sure if you understand how important weapon speed is for hunters, but both of the ranged weapons that drop in MC are awful for hunters. In fact, both of them will do less damage than Carapace spine crossbow which is a 20% drop in strat when you account for the hunter rotation.
---
So besides the fact that every hunter will easily have Rhok before your melee all get MC weapons, your argument wouldn't even hold otherwise. 
---
You're being one of those hunters that makes everyone hate hunters.
---
Don't you only put 2 points into blizzard so cone of cold stacks with it?
---
Slovenly welfare-dependent people.
---
The general tone of his message is normal things, it''s even in the title.  The guest example is indeed an exception.   In that case you tell your party: 'sorry something came up IRL, I have to leave the computer'  and leave the party so they can find a replacement,  you would not go AFK.
---
AFK Grandma on fire!
---
So jealous ha, grats to you guys. Btw what's the add on to highlight your target's name?
---
&gt; Something I see frequently on here sometimes is that "players will be better because we all actually know the mechanics of the game"
---
I read variants of this for months up to release. Having tanked and healed many dungeons, the lie detector test has determined that was a lie. Lots of bad pulls, bad class play (hunter pet aggro, paladin consecration breaking CC, nuke before sunder, etc.) ...it actually feels more like Vanilla than I thought it would.
---
This evening I believe.
---
UD is the worst warrior class, but not by a lot. We are talking small percent points. It doesn't matter unless you want to be the top 1% warriors in the realm
---
I know what I posted and the 2 people above me posted. There is an implication that having knowledge about the game is somehow not playing the game. I'm asking for a clarification on why ignorance is being praised.
---
You seem to forget that wotlk or tbc heroics weren't cakewalks for fresh 70s/80s either.
---
My server isn't some casual one where people don't prepare. I am quite confident that the prices won't change much the next couple of months and there's plenty of other stuff that I needed to invest in before diremaul broke all prices.
---
Wotlk had issues but at least it was a polished game. Unfortunately people started caring more about gearscore and making everything as easy as cookie cutter as possible. People stopped experimenting.
---
Congrats, my guild crafted our Horde first on Herod last week. It’s a great feel and really shows guild commitment to make it happen so quickly.

Yeah, thanks. This is correct. One was equal level to me and the other was two below.

Almost everthing in BRD is humanoid, and they are pretty tightly packed, and some of them are even non-hostile, so its a great place for pickpocketing for gold and pocket lint.

Well then you wipe your raid by body pulling a boss while people are drinking because you nod out on your w key

Could have done that, but i thought its funny how it turned out with the mindcontrol cap.

Also 4g a pop on mine, although they climb up more on like tuesday (a popular raid night it seems)

Does a healer not want +healing?
---
On my servers the arcane crystals are 49g and the arcanite bars are 50 or 51g. I don't know why people even bother selling bars.
---
Here’s an epic video from the same guild: https://youtu.be/Fd97o-gEBuk
---
That's what I do. I have a few cloth drops i've organically picked up along the way with +healing that i swap if I'm needed as a healer. Otherwise I tank. I'm only level 31 though.
---
Having two people summon using the meeting stone.
---
Basically create a list of results you want: Good, Bad, Really Good, Really Bad, etc. Then you define what range you want for each one, so 1-10 for Really Bad, 11-50 for Bad, 51-90 for Good, 91-100 for Really Good. You create a list of switch/if statements to get all these out. 
---
Then a map is *basically* an array where you can use strings instead of numbers for indexes, so resultMap["Good"] or resultMap["Really Bad"] instead of resultArray[1]. There are some other things it does more efficiently behind the scenes, but it mostly has the benefit of keeping it more readable.
---
The point of all this is just to make it more maintainable, testable, and separated so that your result calculation is separate from the decision making which is separate from the actual result execution. There are some cool features in languages I don't use to make this all easier though, like [ranges in switch statements](https://www.includehelp.com/c/using-range-with-switch-case-statement.aspx) for C and Swift.
---
I was with you until the bad healer part. DPS literally shouldn't have to be healed in most fights due to them handling their threat properly.
---
Sick! Thank you
---
This post makes sense when voiced by an impatient tank who hasn't heard of healers requiring mana.
---
Elemental earth. 30s now will be 5-7g once AQ40 comes out.
---
Oily Black Mouth now 5-10s, later 20-40s once phase 2 PvP comes out. 
---
With the metaof every person going mage, I could imagine elemental war go up a tad for frostpots, however I'm not sure.
---
Firebloom for AQ40 firepower pots or hand ins.
---
LOTS AND LOTS of runecloth, which will be handed in 20minutes into AQ war effort, because the rewards you get in the chests are totally out of whack between runecloth hand in and chest reward.
---
Did the items drop and you lost rolls or did they never even drop? My old tactic was to have a decent core of people I ran with so we wouldn’t always fight over drops. If you’re in a pug every time then there’s a new person to roll against and that’s gonna hurt. Another option is to be group lead and cherry pick the other members to not need the gear (eg if you need leather don’t grab other leather wearers).
---
The other mobs will agro you, guaranteed
---
I'm gonna play so much once "event"

Like my friend who rolled lock for free mount. "going to go so hard at 40"

Maybe they listened to everyone's excessive unfounded whining about how DM was going to literally ruin the entire game by coming out this early and that Blizzard should time gate releases based on the slowest in the pack.

Forget two hours, sometimes it's that long just to start the group. It's a major problem for me as a family man. I haven't run a dungeon in over a month because it's easily a 3 hour commitment.

Honestly never remember farming DM back in the day but for people that know it well... can two level 60 Warlocks farm the hell out of it?

They had to wait for China to write the news release. You can tell because of the punctuation.

You will swap rhok for ajirethul and stay with that until kel thuzad.

Asking ahead of time or making intentions known at the beginning of the run or before looting seems like the best option and the main thing I should have done differently.

Higher top end dmg than my ancient bone bow. Strikers is better.

Next time roll Horde and you won't have to listen to whiny baby Paladin's when they don't get the gear they want.  You can just shield bash their brains in when they try to take you on.  :)

I’m a few levels lower and I’ve been shocked that censoring skins is the way to go. Are they never worth auctioning? Is that just when we can do the rare stuff?
---
You can do like the others have suggested and macro a lot of your spells to use `/cancelform`, but also consider having a macro just to cancel form and bind it to a button you can press easily.
---
I have a macro bound to my middle mouse button so that I can just hit it as I run up to things.
---
You need the gear. I have a 60 holy paladin, that I would be more than happy tanking on it (and I have). I have 5 pieces of gear from MC currently, and all the rest is pre-raid BiS. 
---
My tanking set is mostly level 40-50 blues/greens that are an array of leather-plate items that I used while leveling in ret. 
---
People will focus on gearing their main spec, and if you queue into a dungeon as dps spec, you’re not likely going to roll on tank items.
---
Rage gain primarily.  In p3 the tanks still need to remain out front because the threat meters were so inaccurate it was randomly passing between the two OT despite the one who was second on chart not being anywhere near high enough to pull.
---
I’m 29, glad I don’t have those problems yet
---
This is why you run the dungeons as dps when you're still gearing and learn from other tanks how to pull etc. If you're only tanking you're not gonna know what pulls you could be doing better, etc.
---
14 is good for Westfall. I got sent there at 10 and found it was too early, but 14 is great.

I don’t think I’ve ever seen any rogue sap in a dungeon run.

---
ive so far found only 1 arcane crystal. damn you
---
I think that rule applies the more valuable the items are, right? Im lvl 47 and I've never had a group where BoE's were All Need. So to clear it up: when you have upgrades on the list of BoE, you let everyone know. Otherwise everyone just needs and its based on luck.
---
One note, the manual crowd pummler is one of the few things that you can trigger the on-use ability of as a bear but the "on hit" effects of weapons also do not trigger.
---
Right? Lol. Definitely do not have to respect that at all
---
So you scammed your guild for gear?

He also bought PBD not regular black diamonds. I also didnt do it "hours" before. Been putting them up for a few days now. Could ya know not be a cunt online towards other peoples simple mistakes but I would imagine you're that dude who later on will say LF Dire Maul Runs must have cleared Ony/MC to join.
---
Also on grob as alliance, and I see exact opposite in open world...  don't forget there are still 2 layers.
---
Blizzard figured out a long time ago that communicating with players usually doesn't have any benefits at all. When people get pissed at you regardless of what you say then you may as well just not say anything to them.

Why not? Extra damage is extra damage. Enh shamans don't have much else to do if you run them. For healers this doesn't sound like a good idea.
---
So let me get this straight
---
you are an experienced WoW player and even back in vanilla you made a lot of gold, a lot more than most players
---
Now like 15 years on with a whole wealth of information on how to make gold and the best farming spots, where to avoid spending and how to maximise your profits and you're confused as to why you're making more gold than before?

No data for Herod? :(

One of the great things about this robe is that when you combine it with the Boreal Mantle, the Ban'Thok Sash and Frostweave gloves (which are are roughly prepaid BiS) it looks like a matching set.
---
I looked into Decursive and from the small amount of research I did, I gleaned that you can no longer run it due to blizzard disabling addons that automate abilities (I believe the targeting was automated with decursive). 
---
Can anyone confirm that is does or doesn’t work for classic?
---
gratz I guess? Even though I find it hard to believe that you accumulate 2000g just from doing dungeons and not 'farming gold'.
---
OOps sorry, guess it was horde first only. Damn
---
bro it literally just reads the combat log...
---
People should be generally aware of other classes bus lists and not roll against them for it
---
I think it's hard to find a metric on it. City raids are mostly guild driven (especially on an RP server). 
---
That being said, i find grobbulus to be much more even compared to other servers i play on.
---
My warlock mount (60%) has never made a peep.
---
Psh, alliance propaganda
---
Neat.
---
And a nightmare for heals!  I get so stressed in pugs.  Everyone dying, blow all my mana in the first 10 seconds because tank can't get aggro over dps going balls to the wall before they even swing or locks/mages running in and AOE'ing instantly.
---
rofl using wowclassicbis as a reference. How dumb can you get? Imagine using Mask of the unforgiven over eye of rend because you looked at one website.
---
Can you use it while in form though, or do you have to use it while out of form? Like a power shifting feral dps Druid.
---
This game has zero significance compared to those “excuses” you posted. If that stuff bothers you that much you need to seek help that you would prioritize a fucking video games to real life guests.
---
o man, I better get this addon asap. thanks for the post.
---
Dude... This isnt Ranked Dota 2 matches. Fuck off with that attitude.
---
It's pretty darn difficult to pull off perfectly. If you mess it up and miss a GCD for either bloodthirst or whirlwind your DPS is actually going to suffer.
---
So we're the good guys?
---
Except Barrens isn't enemy territory on PvE realms. Only capital cities are
---
Nope - you’re probably guildless or on the losing end all the time. Team up man, make your change.
---
All dungeons are worth one run.

I know it's difficult for the average neckbeard basement dweller to believe, but some of us so, in fact, have spouses and children and lives outside of video games.

Indeed. "Why do I know more about the game than I did back then!? I JUST DON'T GET IT!"
---
If that hunter is playing melee hunter then who cares? Like, what if the rogue rolling on ashjre'thul is playing ranged rogue maaaaan. Sure it's not ideal etc etc
---
The addon is called Plater. Its a full nameplate addon, ive just adjusted the settings for friendly/horde targets

Reroll Tauren druid. The only way to herb. Keep alc on your main. Consumables never go out of style.

I got to 60, got my epic mount, full pre-raid BiS, and cleared all dungeons and raids. I'm done for Classic. Maybe I'll come back tomorrow temporarily just to try out Dire Maul, but that's it. Classic WoW is an extremely shallow game. I have no desire to level an alt at this point.
---
TLDR: you suck git out
---
Respec at 30 for hemo build 👌
---
Just to report back here - prot paladin did work well on ZF for Spellcleave. You can do large pulls with a prot paladin, but it's safer to stick with the traditional AoE Runs.
---
Here's a good guide for anyone trying to learn how to do prot paladin pulls: [https://youtu.be/5jQdYzGscak](https://youtu.be/5jQdYzGscak)
---
We have a full BiS melee roster with a dozen Viskags and Brutality blades and we had no issues with threat - before our tanks went DW Fury. Your tank is bad. It's not will BWL that threat would become an issue usually.
---
&gt;Dont waste mana on damage spells. They will look pitiful in comparison to the monstrous DPS the warrior will put out and you will be slowing down the run.
---
In true warrior form, you are completely full of yourself.  Bravo!
---
&gt;Let's instead pull everything nuke it and spend 2 minutes drinking after every pull.
---
People do this because it is **alot** faster and more efficient
---
i did tanaris, hinterlands was mined out everytime on my server
---
You know, For a solid second there I really wanted Finkle to have some item named Last Night. Now I'm going to have to come up with what it would be in game if it really existed.
---
Main weapon &gt; stat stick. Always. If your main weapon is an upgrade, you should have priority on it over people that will use it as a stat stick. In my eyes, this is a ninja roll, regardless of what their BiS list says.
---
If I was using superior game knowledge to farm gold, then the question wouldn't make sense. But I'm not doing that.
---
Does anyone know the min reasonable level for each wing?
---
I respect the people with jobs that still manage to be raid ready by now
---
6 second cooldown, one target at a time. Good luck when you lose threat on four targets at once. And it only put you at the top of the list; it doesn’t generate any additional aggro.
---
So, 24 seconds to taunt those four mobs, and if you think the DPS will stop going absolutely berserk during those INTERMINABLE 16 GCDs so you can actually secure aggro on the mobs you taunted? You must have the GOOD stuff.
---
Can't speak for others, but I am still having a blast tanking and feel challenged whenever mages bomb the shit out of groups. I even ask them to do so. Mostly I just act as a 4th DD, focusing on maintaining aggro on bosses and threatening trash mobs. I don't even bother tanking caster mobs for example and only ever taunt if someone has too many mobs on them. I also never ran into the issue of others pulling for me, as I am fast enough at pulling myself. I've heard from many others that they've had very bad experience with random tanks tho. I assume it's simply a lot more challenging to tank in classic compared to modern wow. Not to mention that you're fucked solo unless you play fury prot and have sick gear.
---
Totem twisting, yes. Extremely mana intensive.
---
He kinda skipped the "LFM ZF 3 WARRIORS MEELEECLEAVE RAVAGER ONLY WITH NKOWLEDGE PLS" part of the group search, but the rest was quite accurate for me. Ran it 3 times, first time was a mess with an idiot mage doing multipulls, not understanding that a group with a Shadow and a Rouge as other DPS can't reasonably AoE. He left after wiping us twice, not without swearing at us how stupid we were. Second group was okay, but the fucktard goblin refused to open the gate and insisted on dying instead, and the following blame fiesta prevented my carrot. Third group actually went very smooth.
---
Anyone have a good gold farming guide for mages in Dire Maul?  I’ve never ran the dungeon before so something for beginners would be good.
---
Why do you think dps meters are valuable tools? I'm a mage and haven't used one since SM. It honestly just encourages sub-optimal play, and is otherwise just gear and build dependant
---
You know too much this time around.
---
I run strat live a lot, reserve first orb for myself since I need 0 loot from there. Never have issues filling group.
---
Ah yes, the old Pineapple Express maintenance room.  
---
We kept the train running in tip-top shape until one of our goblin engineers decided to use the [ice reflector](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23077/gyrofreeze-ice-reflector) on a blizzard we were driving through.
---
They tracked down the goblin responsible, turns out there had only been one ice reflector sold recently in all of Azeroth.
---
We kept the room in case we venture down that road again, not everyone can build a train engine with pineapple juice for fuel.
---
Eh, polearm from magistrate in strat..
---
Not even going read more than the first point. This is retarded.
---
My friends and I are doing well. We've only lost two out of ten plus so far. And they were never gonna make it.
---
Queuing HS is a dual wield build. It's the standard 17/34. There is no Slam.
---
Most healers can level just fine in heal spec or sit at dungeon entrances and look for groups. Holy priests for example are better at solo leveling than most other classes and specs.
---
Tanks can level just fine in tank spec, but you can also just as easily play any other spec and tank.
---
For off-spec people who want to heal, it’s very easy sub-45 but past 45 you need to stack int and spirit gear if you want to off-spec heal. You’ll still perform better on a healing spec anyway and you’ll have enough mana for multiple pulls and bigs pulls. Don’t just say you’ll heal just to get groups faster if you’re a dps though.
---
V big bepis

Same story. A few of my friends (who never actually played vanilla) were posting nonstop about classic in discord. Planning routes, professions, researching, etc. every week for months before release. Also they were ADAMANT that no one roll the same class, and there was lots of drama about that and which server to play.
---
Fast forward and all the people above quit within a week. Months of stressing about it and hearing about who should and shouldn’t play what, for nothing 
---
I think a lot of people were just bored with the gaming industry in general and were using wow to give themselves something to look forward to
---
Good point. That's the other big gold mechanic that I missed. The fact that there's 2-3 times more vendor loot to go around does inflate things.
---
That or set the loot threshold to "Uncommon" so that this needs to be rolled for.
---
Lol what the actual fuck. I am sensitive about wasting peoples time and haven’t had to go AFK often during group content. BUT...
---
I have a 12 year old dog that sometimes needs to shit off schedule. It’s either take him out or let him go on the carpet. Guess what I’m going out. 
---
I have two kids under the age of 3. My wife does plenty of child care so guess what I help out when there are emergencies. 
---
People get sick, my wife needed some coconut water and sudafed, guess what. I’m going to the corner store. 
---
This entire post just sounds like somebody who has zero life obligations/responsibilities and cannot fathom actually respecting their friends/family/pets enough to tell a dungeon group “hang on, I need a couple minutes, life fame up”
---
No..,
---
I don't buy Blizzard's word, they've said before that they don't time their major patch releases with competing product launches but they've consistently gone down to the day to launch stuff at the same time as their competitors. In this case, it's Archeage's latest expansion launch today which is a major player in the Eastern hemisphere.
---
Which streamer gave you this hot take
---
7:00PM CEDT happens when this comment is 59 minutes old.

You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/GoGe6sZxR
---
Ravenholdt Manor is already in the game, why can’t Rogues do their level 50 quests yet?  Same thing.
---
the main goal is to reduce spam and save time. 90% of the messages in the lfg channel are "looking for tank for &lt;insert dungeon name&gt;". if tanks were the ones forming groups, all of these messages would go away
---
I think I know where this is going, and I look forward to it!
---
So it's basically just the /stopcasting piece.  I was mainly thinking outside of a macro how to do it, but someone saying just pressing ESC does it.  I'll have to make the macro either way when I am home from work
---
I agree it feels much faster to earn gold. When I hit 60 I had above 700g despite not selling any single item for any noticeable mamiknt, and I make 100+g in a day even if I play relatively casually, just doing some dungeons. 
---
I think one reason is that everyone is much better than they were back in the days, this means that there will be much more gold in circulation than there used to be, which in return keeps prices higher. People farm dungeons much faster and more effectively, and people farm gold solo much more effectively and quickly, which just means there's a lot of gold going back and forth - virtually everyone, constantly, expend gold currently, either on new enchants/min maxing/pots/gear.
---
There's currently so many people who are both farming gold fast but also spending most or all of it, therefore most items are highly valued.
---
How is it a trap?
---
leaving the channel doesnt fix the problem
---
i'm doing splits already, still think it doesn't matter 
---
i also believe utilizing 2h drops is worth wasting a debuff slot
---
Imagine playing WoW and calling other WoW players basement dwellers. Classic is a perfect game to nolife. Sorry we’re not all casuals
---
I hit 60 on Sunday.  I'm the only one in that last week from my guild of 'people who were getting back together to run Classic' who has logged on in the last week.  Next highest level is a 47 Hunter.
---
I don't know that guide, but most guides include sections where you should grind for a while. What you should do is follow the guide based on what to do, not based on your level. Is, it's fine if you are a level or even two higher than the guide recommends, just when you get to sections where it say grind you can skip it until eventually you are the same level as the guide. Or maybe you make it all the way to 60 before that happens. There is nothing that says you need to be the exact level in the guide.
---
For five hours.
---
I'm all for you needing equipment that you are going to use. I'm just against the attitude a lot of people take in classic where having knowledge of the game should be frowned upon.
---
Some crafting recipes, and a cool but not super useful trinket (summon timbermaw fighting buddy).
---
They do this with raids friend. And it's never really been a big deal for world first races since EU is more competitive in that regard
---
found the anti social zoomer mage
---
Are you alliance or horde? Because there's a huge selective memory bias. You're far more likely to notice the other faction ganking, vs. your faction ganking outnumbered enemies.
---
Also, it definitely feels like the alliance are more involved in the open world PvP? There's definitely a ton of horde players, but they seem a little more preoccupied with other things vs. WPvP.
---
It's asinine gatekeeping just because you're annoyed at something.  
---
The world won't change just to accommodate you.
---
what do you mean by that?
---
Ah yes. Good point.
---
Yeah same lol, had about 10 ppl who were hyped to play. I started 5 days late and was playing catch up but I passed all but 1 in a week, then after 2 weeks only 1 other guy was playing. We never even played or helped each other so I just left the server at 30 with like 20g and rerolled with some a different friend who actually had consistent players where I been since. 52 now, going strong!
---
Also I think people play a LOT more than they did 15 years ago and may not realize this.
---
&gt;So you don't know any better farming spots
---
How would my knowledge of farm spots impact my wealth if I am not farming those spots?
---
Nobody said there was. They simply play the game more. Why you mad?
---
Should I respecc into mm hunter to farm endgame zones such as winterspring? If so, what would be the best tanking pet for mm hunters with a few points in bm? Turtle or boar?
---
Ah, that's uncool and sad to hear. Hopefully they're better behaved these days.
---
You should stretch out that last frame for a bit long and slowly zooming in the character !
---
Both times I’ve done UD we’ve had 2 melee dps, which makes Baron and the 6 elite pack before him really difficult. The early parts of UD aren’t hard but then again the beginning of all of the end game dungeons are easy
---
As a tank, the issue is this: 
---
Contrary to what you actually think, there is a surplus of tanks. Right now, there is a lot of emphasis on tanks in dungeons, but the number of dedicated tanks you need for raids is extremely limited. Once tanks realize that, and their tanking slot isn’t secured, there isn’t much point of staying prot.
---
No, it would turn into messages looking for heals or dps. Ya feel me?
---
Nah, is coffe candy (laugh in evil~)
---
Druids usually shits on rogues. While in bear form theyll bearely hurt you. If needed just stun, root, heal and continue to bear.  Use faerie fire and moonfire too.
---
just saw that it's actually in an old list of things that are not considered bugs so it's not a new discovery, you're right. still, if it was in the original game then it should be in classic.
---
I’m getting close to 60 and a bit worried about this as well. I want to heal, but I don’t mind tanking if no one else is doing it. But I can’t imagine the healer being cool with me rolling on their gear.
---
As many others have said.... they are wrong. On AOE pulls generally it is best to mark a skull. DPS should focus the skull down, then start AOE after. By that time you should have at least a sunder on everything and it will not drop aggro.
---
An easy tip for Strat packs though..... run UD Strat and stock up on Holy Water and dont be afraid to use them. It's essentially a free engineering grenade for any undead packs. It really helps you to keep threat.
---
What does 2h have to do with it? You never play arms in raid. Horde can go 2h fury and hamstring spam, alli can play 2h fury slam but it’s worse.
---
I'd be happy to tank at 60 as a druid, but if I'm looking to raid (with limited time), I'm gonna have better chances speccing resto. Which makes picking up healing gear an absolute pain, due to the primary and understandable system of MS &gt; OS.
---
I am dealing with it, I'm just telling the guy what's going to happen?
---
What's the problem with the message?
---
But I thought that trinket wasn’t in classic?
---
&gt;unless you are in super tryhard speedrun guild
---
ok we are in agreement then
---
This could be a factor as well, yes.
---
New player, 100 hours In, lvl 34, no intension of dropping. I tried To get into wow during retail, but it just didnt click even though I really loved the world, of warcraft. Compared To classic, it's too damn easy. Nothing feels rewarding, i never felt like i'd accomplished some thing In retail, but In classic just doing Basic stuff like Unlocking my poisons as rogue felt like an achievement.
---
Isn't the mage typical raid spec 31/0/20 anyway? Assuming one of your mages goes for Winter's Chill, eveybody else would go deep arcane
---
It takes them out of stealth in vanilla. Even if they talent into it they have a 10% chance to fail
---
Wow if you wanted to farm negative karma this is how you do it.

I hate the AH automation too, it's been a part of the game since forever...
---
that being said, trust me when I say there are MANY people checking the AH MANUALLY any given second and do not use any AH sniper that could have easily picked up your posting just by luck chance.
---
Not saying that your items wasn't taking off of someone's Snipe list, but it I have definitely manually caught items being posted at 1% of their normal AH prices in bulk (prob from fucking up with the stack size vs quantity) just because I happen to have caught it right as they were posting.
---
I agree, just playing devil's advocate here.  But, isn't that the same argument that was made against the "LFG" addon that got canned by Blizz?  It was just parsing logs already in the game.
---
and they think they are officers in successful guilds.
---
I dont play Rogue so im not sure but i agree, i dont see why content would be locked behind a time window for no reason. I get it if that content isnt available until Phase 3 or whatever, but if its there now you should be able to do it imo (i also have a good few lock quests locked until certain phases too)

Excerpt taken from the personal journal of Ezheals:
---
*So there I was, swimming around this lake for hours looking for some chest, that had some item in it, needed for someone that I just met.  Bam!  I found it, right next to the murloc family I just slaughtered.  I'm holding my breath, slowly opening the rusted chest, whew, got it!  I start to swim up, my breath is running out and I can feel my lungs start to shake, but I reach the top just in time.  I breathe in the sweet air that only decaying murlocs and lake water can provide.*
---
*I swim for the shoreline and see the welcoming sight of luscious golden sand and the vibrant green grasses.*
---
*Upon reaching the sandbar, I sit down and rest, reflecting in my journal about this marvelous occasion.  A quest completed, another victory for the Alliance.*
---
*I stand up, face away from the lake and check my map, look at the terrain again, then the map.*
---
**\*Arcane Shot crits you for 1,256\***
---
^(As I lay dying, all I can think about is how much I miss being in the water, almost drowning.)
---
**\*?? Hairytaints spits on you.\***
---
&gt; People farm dungeons much faster and more effectively
---
That's true and it's a good contributing factor.
---
at the rate we're going, they'd be right in a year. Half the servers would need a merger by years end
---
But what you are describing is not playing the game incorrectly. You are describing metagaming. Optimizing dps rotation, talents, gear, etc. It's the way I enjoy to play as well. However, it isn't the only way to play, nor the "correct" way to play. If I want to go all in on assassination as rogue, it isn't the optimal play. But if I'm doing it because I like the idea of being an assassin with poisons, then that's fine.
---
Classic WoW is much more sandbox then I think people give it credit for. You can metagame BiS gear, talents and rotations if you want, but it isn't the only way to play nor the way you *have* to play.
---
If you are ditching a profession for engineering chances are high you want to PvP.
---
If you want to PvP to rank, then keep herablism. Making 10-40g an hour nuking the opposing faction farming some random herbs is more gold than 0, because you rank all day.
---
Wowhead says phase 1

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21326/defender-of-the-timbermaw
---
So I’m not 60 yet, but I’m getting close to it.  As a Druid tank, I will not group with rogues if I can avoid it.  Call me selfish, but my gearing options are limited compared to Warrior tanks, so I’m not bringing competition.  I’ll avoid random pug groups on dungeons that I know are a pain in the ass and instead only go with friends/guildies. 
---
I’ve built up a decent friends list of competent players that allows me to not take chances on random scrubs.  Which is nice as it allows us all to gear together instead of always fighting people for loot.
---
750-1250 dmg absorb is still quite good at 60, hardly the best, but for sure useful in some cheesy situations
---
Loch Modan is worse because despite the town of thelsamar, feels like none of the quests are centralized, and it feels like everything requires you to take a jog around the lake. But Westfall is pretty depressing because when you enter from the north like you’re supposed to, you see a couple quest givers along the way and think you immediately have to start killing orange-level mechanical mobs with low drop rates on quest items. If you run 3/4 of the zone, ignoring the quests in front of you, you get to sentinel hill and see that there are actually way more quests, and those are of appropriate level.
---
I had a total brain fart on Friday night. Was doing a Mara run and between pulls i was giving out to myself about the healer not topping me up after the pulls (i run DPS) I then realized i had no less than 60 pieces of food, 45 bandages and 15 emergency potions and why the hell wasn't i topping myself up??
---
This topic is blowing up, so I'll throw my two cents in,  too. 
---
I'm not hardcore. My hunter is level 48, and I'm an altoholic with far too little time to play, so who knows when I'll ever reach 60.
---
I hate it when people don't respect the time of others in a dungeon group. If you join for the hour or two it takes to get people's quests done, sit the fuck down and play. If you think you might have to get up more than once or twice to use the bathroom or grab your kids a snack or something, run the dungeon later.
---
I really wanted to run WC the other night on my warlock and get the staff and the nice green shoulders. I joined a group that had 3 guildies and one other random. I would generously estimate that for maybe 20% of the TWO AND A HALF HOURS we spent in there all 3 of the guilded people were all playing at the same time. 
---
I shut my mouth because by the time we were at the second boss that drops the item for the important quest I couldn't see putting in that much effort with another group on parts I've already done. I just wanted it to be over. They even tried to leave before the escort part, but I persuaded them to stay because jesus christ why would you go that far and not finish? It was a terrible experience and I  have avoided dungeons since. 
---
Tldr: it's not "hardcore" to sit down and play when you're with a group. People in here trying to justify holding their groups hostage  should gtfo.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Wow, you sure sound like you're the kind of person I don't want to play WoW with.
---
&gt; Phone Calls
---
If you were playing WoW 10+ years ago (like the majority of the Classic crowd), you should have a life and adult responsibilities, by now. Having responsibilities, as an adult, means you answer the phone, in case it's important. Chances are it's more important than a computer game.
---
&gt; Dinner / Cooking
---
That one I can agree with to some extent, as it is something most people can anticipate before joining a group. That said, if a dungeon run should take 1 hour and is dragging out much longer and a player needs to start heating water to cook pasta and goes AFK for 2 minutes, I don't see it as an issue.
---
&gt; Taking the dogs out
---
Are you implying that pets should be taught to synchronize their needs with their owner's gaming schedule, because that sure sounds incredibly stupid. If my dog asks for the door, I'll let him out. I'm not cleaning shit and piss off the floor because some kid is impatient.
---
&gt; Unexpected Guest(s)
---
Again, if the player goes AFK for a minute, to answer the door and greet unexpected guest(s), I don't think that's a problem. If they take an extended AFK to have a cold one with their buddies while I'm waiting on them, that's a different story. I can't imagine anyone doing that, though. Wouldn't most players just drop out of the group if they'd rather hang with unexpected guests than complete the instance they're in?
---
&gt; My child just woke up
---
RL &gt; WoW. Not sure how else to put this. I don't even have kids, but if someone tells me they have to AFK because of their kid(s), they get a free pass from me. From a baby waking up crying, to siblings fighting, there's just no reason WoW should come first, ever. That doesn't mean parents shouldn't be allowed to play WoW, either.
---
&gt; My significant other just got home
---
Well yeah, if I want *snoo snoo* that night, I'll greet her. If you have a problem with that, you're probably not the kind who gets *snoo snoo* very often.
---
&gt; I am at work / working from home
---
Again, this sounds more like a case of someone dropping the group than going AFK for a few minutes. This one is certainly more context-dependent than the others, I'm not sure what job would allow someone to only go AFK for a few minutes at a time and still be doing their job. On the other hand, we have firefighters in our guild who play at work since they have nothing to do when not on a call. If they get a call, though, they're not just going AFK, they're leaving until their job is done.
---
All that being said, a recurring theme here is that there's a difference between a 2 minute AFK and an extended AFK (in which case the player would be better off dropping the group altogether).
---
Video games is where they do their dick measuring so they need to constantly affirm themselves of their worth as a person
---
Biggest problem is that you need tanks at a 1:5 ratio for dungeons, and a 1:40 or 1:20 ratio for raids.
---
With a few pieces of Int gear, a fully tank spec Druid can easily farm DM lashers. Not as quick as a mage, but still reasonably fast and easy.
---
Which will lead to more early release due to "desire for more content".
---
They should of put their foot down.   Most people haven't even gotten their bis in the current content now let's drop more into the mix
---
Yes , but i am 100% sure that boomkin is not that place
---
This thread is just the same two arguments over and over again.
---
Clearly there is no "accepted norm" so unless you communicate your expectations when playing there is a 50/50 chance you wind up upset. Save yourself the stress and just communicate! Its just a damn game.
---
Stop acting like your bullshit speculation is factual information.
---
Serpentbloom snakes are common throughout the Barrens
---
Yea, pets typically have to be manually targeted, which is why hunters shouldn't expect the healer to take care of their pet in addition to the rest of the party. And I believe the OP was referring to keeping the pet topped up after every pull. I'm just saying that that's the hunter's responsibility and that the healers shouldn't worry about it 99.5% of the time. I mean, sure, a quick HoT is appreciated if you happen to notice and can spare the mana, but it should never be expected.
---
Double DB is still very much worth it for PvP lols, the burst is absurd.
---
That's not it at all. Attributing damage to one mage is just a side effect. The core aspect of rolling ignites is that it gets bugged with sequential crits.
---
How ignite is supposed to work based on description:
---
- fireball crit for 1k
---
- ignite tick for 200
---
- ignite tick for 400
---
- fireball does not crit 
---
- **Total Fireball Crit damage: 5000**
---
- **Total Ignite damage: 2000 (+40%)**
---
How ignite actually works in classic (and vanilla):
---
- ignite tick for 600
---
- ignite tick for 800
---
- ignite tick for 1000
---
- **Total Ignite damage: 4800 (+80%)**
---
... now imagine that continuing for minutes at a time.
---
Wednesday is eu patch day / reset day
---
Thanks for the info, this is super useful. When you play this the normal way, a lot of these details are overlooked. Once Ironman plus other difficult challenges are imposed on you, however, every little mechanics count
---
Everyone who plays more than me is a loser
---
Everyone who plays less is a noob
---
This is you
---
Hmm as a healer, I feel dumb not thinking about that...
---
Enforcing your idea of DPS really don't have a group yet if they dont have a tank.
---
I wouldn't go as far as not allowing or telling them to not try to form a group, however a group without healer and tank is in fact not a group yet.
---
I’m 58 and a half right now and will probably join my guild in MC tonight, should I expect any experience gains on trash even minimal or no xp at all?
---
I'm not really sure how the icon is chosen. I don't know how druids are specced. Can you be feral, but have a majority of points in balance?
---
I thought it released 16th EU?
---
WOW i want to h8 you, but i cant do that....
---
If you dont mind sharing, where?
---
Is there a trick to make vanish "work better" ?
---
I'm 60 and farming Maraudon, when i agro 4-5 monster and try to vanish, it often do nothing, monster keep attacking me as if nothing happened.
---
Unless he’s been super lucky and had multiple super valuable epics drop, there’s no way they’ve accumulated multiple thousands of gold without some sort of farming.
---
Joined with my brother and his friends. They all quit after 2 weeks.  On my own little island now
---
I was just really taken aback by the arrogance and entitlement. Why should he heal you? Either eat/drink or drain life. You're not entitled to heals, especially between pulls... The healer was level 37. He was doing his best to walk through the dungeon without body aggroing everything. What makes you think he has the mana to keep your lazy ass afloat?
---
/castsequence
---
What do you guys think of [this build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuRgoxVhucMu) ? I want my main focus to be raid healing, but I also want to be able to do some AOE farming and a bit of PvP.
---
I plan on raid tanking, if you think for a minute that my kid asking me for help is going to be met with anything but me helping them then you can join someone else. Sure if I just pull it will be met with “ok, just give me a minute.” But if it’s between pulls I’m getting up and helping them.
---
Hahaha wicked!
---
No the comment was from OP saying that maybe the rogue that got me was inspired by him and his video. Harmless Little comment that got downvoted to hell lol
---
Let the mage die. Let the mage learn :D
---
You don’t need bus to raid, you just need a pulse. MC is super easy.
---
In PvP trinkets with cheesy/powerful utility effects are generally far better than raw damage. There isn't really anything to replace the grandmaster trinket.
---
What the fuck
---
More black lotus would be a welcome addition imo.
---
"Why am I getting downvoted for spewing bullshit out of my ass??"
---
This is art pure . Wallpaper ty vm man
---
As a class (Paladin, Priest etc) who can’t use ranged weapons you can keep Egan’s Blaster equipped on your character for subduing the civilian ghosts in live side Stratholme. In addition to someone else mentioning you can /dance with them. I always feel bad at killing the civvies accidentally.
---
Maybe someone will disagree but I would advise for you to switch realms. Unbalanced realms are not good for anyone except PVE servers where you’re on the dominant faction
---
That's what all addons do.
---
Well im prepared to share account lol, im burned out for real. Justnplayingg overwatch now
---
There's a blue post saying it comes 19:00 CEST today.
---
When you’re running an MC specially with a PuG you can’t deny someone from rolling on an upgrade. Even if it’s not technically the best fitting thing possible they have all rights to have the item just as much.
---
Not everything is streamer or retail related.
---
Big Bad Pauldrons in ZF
---
Gloves off last boss in Uldaman are pretty decent even at 60 if you don't have anything better.
---
Pretty good mace in ZF, has an aoe proc effect
---
Probably others, but thats about all I can remember. I recommend getting the Addon Atlas Loot. Shows you the loot thats drops off every boss in every dungeon and raid.
---
Yup! Random lol but the bow is at the bottom right in my bag :D
---
?
---
Retail is more of a grind than classic, tell me I’m wrong
---
Well the whole point of mmos is the time you put into it. Theres not a whole lotta skill even in pvp unless its 1v1 duels.
---
It's all regions at 10am PDT.  So that means *everywhere* gets it 59 minutes from when I posted this.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295663/classic-dire-maul-will-release-in-all-regions-at-10am-pdt
---
Which will lead to the core of the game, the non-60's in the dust.  Most subs aren't bored lvl 60's.    They alienate the majority and they will begin bleeding across the board.
---
You hit the nail on the head.  I definitely want to tank; I'm willing to gather all the BiS gear, I'm willing to respec; but being able to get in and be 1 of 2 "tanks" in a raid is always going to be tough.  If you're not lucky enough to be one of the two in your guild, or your guild isn't large enough, and you're running pug MC/Ony's, you really think that the ONE or TWO tanks slots are gonna be pug'd?  Nope, it's likely the DPS slots.
---
Kanye sampled Daft Punk's song, he didn't write the track at all lol
---
I’m 29 and it fills it just fine for me lol
---
Reckbomb is the duct tape of WoW.
---
Cause you said you remember streamers not having to sit in queue as if it was priority when really they were sitting logged into character selection since like 7am. Then when the server went down tons of them were stuck in queue getting back on
---
Tribute Ring, its also not unique so you get two and doesnt get replaced until MC ring drop.

The Bracers are 1 aep (2aep horde) better than nightslayer bracers at the cost of Sta/Set Bonus

There is a +6 Daggers Belt/OH Dagger for dagger rogues.
---
You can down rank consecration to save mana.
---
Okay. That doesn't change anything.
---
big yikes
---
I believe Hunters and Rogues can get past him but it will need to be tested to know for sure. Rogue can stealth, hunter can send pet in and let it die then feign when hunter is on other side
---
Also I love how the guy is doubling down on it and claiming we can’t read and have no friends that stop by. We’ve got weapons-grade emotional problems here.
---
Just give it a few more weeks, a lot of your quality players are still leveling, including yours truly
---
Even with that bug mages still aren't doing more dps than warriors. Let's say you have 5 mages and your ignite mage is doing 2k dps ~1200 of that dps would be coming from ignite. If you divide that 1200 by 5 you get ~240 dps per mage. Meaning that top damage mage is only actually doing ~1k dps on his own. Warriors can easily achieve numbers higher than this especially now with this new "bug feature" not to mention keeping a single ignite going involves some RNG and coordination between your mages and also risks pulling aggro off the tank the higher you boost one mages numbers where as your warriors are each achieving similar numbers entirely on their own with no risk or coordination required.
---
Arms is a meme spec in raid like ret, most raidleaders would require a respec. I play arms outside of raid for pvp and dungeons, but I respec fury for raid. Playing arms in raid is asking to be carried by 30 other people, and that seems selfish to me.
---
The tome has been master looted in every run I've been in.
---
its a centaur.
---
Yeah. It would be hard to figure out exactly what the trade off there was, but it doesn't seem terribly worth it.
---
TILL YOU DIE
---
The fuck?  I never declared or asserted a damn thing, I asked a question.
---
What happened?
---
 release time 2 hours before it comes out nice
---
Only 1 is still left. He's been soloing mara non stop. Not sure if he's still alive.
---
This reads like a boilerplate start of semester syllabus nobody cares about lmao, gonna give you advice, calm down, and stop being a great.
---
Pretty sure it's meant to be a centuar
---
Once you noticed the AH sniper was onto your transfer you messed up by continuing to do the transaction.
---
Layering also REALLY messes this up so even your normal precautions you and your guildies took failed.
---
That being said, yes you took the risk on cheaply transferring via Neutral AH and lost, so while it sucks badly and I don't agree that there is anything actionable against the guy 'stealing' your mats like that.
---
I started leveling in classic with 3 friends, we leveled all the way together to about 53-55 and met a Warrior friend along the way. Now the only people who play still is just me and the warrior friend we met. Literally all of them randomly decided to quit at the same time. Kind of frustrating but oh well.
---
How else do you expect them to tank? They need tank gear.
---
It's a centaur
---
Bloodrazor, Skullforge, and Thrash Blade are generally in the same tier for MH swords. Considering that both Bloodrazor and Skullforge have  procs that really handicaps your ability to Gouge/Blind, I'd lean toward the following:
---
MH: Thrash Blade
---
OH: Mirah's Song
---
I really hope Dire Maul coming out is actually just them realising that DM should have been in, in the beginning and just a mistake. Not that they are just going to kill it by throwing the content out as fast as they can. Classics about the journey not the goal
---
As someone who enjoys 1H+Shield for Enhancement, about that...
---
I hope black lotus is in DM. We have the same spawn rates as original vanilla but we have triple to quadruple the population and now everyone knows to use flasks. There isn't enough Black Lotus at the moment
---
You'll have longer ques for battlegrounds when they're released.
---
Teremus just taking a quick nap in the back.
---
Looks like a Centaur.
---
Comparing running a company to playing WoW lol
---
Well actually we sold them to the Steemwheedle, then we built Stormwind.

10 days per lvl to be exact.

Pretty hilarious how 99% of commenters completely glazed over the blatant and unnecessary homophobia in this post
---
Dude...my dog doest know what he wants...one min he wants out...30 sec later he wants in...5min later oo heyyy i want out.
---
Imagine being this fucking stupid. 
---
45 year old balding man is mad.
---
A lot of Horde players are used to Retail WPVP.....where Horde absolutely decimates Alliance at all times everywhere.
---
Classic WoW is currently Alliance's chance to get a little bit of revenge for the state of Retail.
---
Once the Honor System comes out the Alliance are in for a very, very rude awakening if they think they "control" WPVP on their server
---
It gets better when you hit 60 and get your epic mount... 
---
*Reads the post again*
---
It gets better when you hit 60 and get your pension...
---
You basically need an off tank for drak but the rest is doable with 1 tank. And for drak it's enough if a fury/arms equips a shield. You can 1 tank drak with enough dps as well, you will just probably lose a dps every time he conflags the tank.
---
One spec, which is a healing spec can have more balance points than resto.
---
If it’s mainly balance, then it’s a moonlit for sure and not feral.
---
Feral will group 2 roles: tank and dps. A few talent points differ between the 2 but the trunk is common
---
True.. I made a Druid (instead of rogue), since it was the class my friends hadn’t had yet since I started late. Now I’m raiding MC/ony weekly as a resto Druid, while my friend is still a 38 rogue... now Im grinding a rogue to 60 to eventually switch mains
---
This is on top of ony neck, ubrs ring, and mara scepter which don't go on keyring anyway but add to the clutter.
---
Relic coffer keys did on pservers, can't remember in actual vanilla offhand.
---
I know. But nightblade has pretty sick dmg compared to other weapons at lvl 39.
---
Thank you, sir!
---
It shouldn’t be. Blizzard needs to step in and stop it. This wasn’t done in vanilla.
---
Hi,
---
I have the same problem.
---
I'm thinking: I should ditch herbalism and grab engineering. That way, my hunter can use jumper cables and still craft his mongoose potions.
---
However.. I see that the mats for mongoose (the silversage specifically)  are expensive, more expensive than a potion.
---
My opinion in the end is: if you can make enough money otherwise to buy your flowers and create the pots you need, as well as buy your thorium, go for it, ditch herbalism.
---
The best solution imo would be to have an alt with mining at least, if not both mining and herbalism!
---
Well, just yesterday I had some mara runs and found some ghost mushrooms. Things sell for 1.5g a pop, wow!
---
For now, I ll probably keep alch/herb, but I wonder for how long though!
---
Consider this: **in one hour, can I farm more mats that I can buy with the gold that I farm in one hour?**
---
Yes? -&gt; stick to herbalism
---
No? -&gt; drop herbalism
---
I'd never drop alchemy, really, depending on the AH for potions is.. nasty!
---
I think last 10 for me was actually easier than 270-290.
---
It's how they justify the unhappiness they feel everyday
---
Yeah I've been doing this for the last few weeks of raids, I am getting better at it, but it's not like I'm soaring on the meters because of it. Just a very minor increase in dps.
---
You should experience shorter ques when battlegrounds are released.
---
Good! I just dropped one yesterday. Totally forgot about them ^^
---
yeah thats it
---
I think there are very few people having "fun" in doing so. Most people only do it because it's an easy way to farm kills and they want the reward. We have seen the same pattern manifest in BfA with Warmode and the introduction of "participation" rewards which ultimately only result in players who wouldn't care to pvp normally to do so in the most toxic and damaging way possible and thereby diminishing world pvp as a whole and the fun of everyone involved.
---
Fury requires sufficient hit and crit to beat arms. This is because of Flurry uptime. Yes, those levels are achievable pre-raid, but in an unlikely situation like mine (mix of pre-raid blues, only half of which are even close to BiS, but with an epic weapon from MC) arms lasts a bit longer. But even if it does more personal dps, it's unlikely that its worth kicking off even a low priority debuff.
---
I'm clarifying a point someone else made, not arguing my own. 
---
Don't get butthurt because people disagree with you.
---
Why bother
---
Brutality blade and bone slicing hatchet is actually worse than just using peacemaker.... That's pretty wasted.
---
Oozes can also drop gold
---
It's literally 1 dungeon with maybe 2-3 items for each class. You're still going to need to do everything else.
---
Hots are garbage efficiency.
---
You should be bombing the lock with a duper efficient big heal
---
(Or your most efficient down ranked one once you get some healing power)
---
...except it was?
---
90 minutes is a lot of time to get to Gnomer, did you all perhaps run there as Horde? If so there is a quest in Orgrimmar engi shop that sends you to Booty bay and they have a teleporter to gnomer there, 15 minutes max if unlucky with Ratchet boat wait time, presuming you start in Kalimdor.
---
Maybe he only chose that name because it would raise so many questions in our hearts and minds that will forever go unanswered. Ooorrr the dude likes jenkum
---
I got on with no queue too and I’m not a streamer. Some people got lucky. That’s how it is.
---
Open world pvp honour patch is going to make your life a living hell if you want to farm outside of instances. The paths to instances will be heavily camped.
---
Having a pvp set will be more important for open world farming until battlegrounds come out.
---
DM came out before world first rag kill in OG vanilla.  You're stressing about a scenario that never existed.
---
I'd agree with this sarcasm if we weren't talking about 10-15 hours a day, everyday.
---
how is that a normal thing? Are you actually retarded for trying to justify that?
---
It's the raid leaders fault as well.
---
we are on a sub forum for a 15 year old role playing game. Probably not the best place to be calling people nerds lmao
---
Most people arnt even 60 yet, games fine no need to be a downer.
---
I started with 7 friends, not including myself. I hit 60 a couple weeks ago, but they quit long before that. The highest level out of them was 42...
---
I had this same addon in vanilla.  I cant remember what it was called but you used to be able to click on the window it popped up and target them.
---
What's?!? How??
---
Looks like his viewership died down a bit. I’d be surprised if he nets over $50k a year.
---
It’ll come in 30 minutes, chill
---
No, retail is a better no life game. You literally have to play to be extremely relevant on retail. Running the same raid on 4 difficulties in split runs multiple times a week, then when you aren't doing that, you literally farm mythic plus... that's without the initial patch dailies you have to do.
---
The great part of Vanilla is (until pvp comes out) that you can play it without having to do chores 24/7
---
Yea, this
---
Good point. Also of note is that while the Draconian Deflector is the best mitigation shield, there is a shield from DM Tribute that's now available that has block % (meh) and extra block value. Worse than Crest of Retribution for aoe threat, but probably a good choice for single target boss threat for deep prot builds.
---
Dual weild huntard meta
---
Yeah, UBRS is something, especially when you're solo tanking (which is fine on Rend runs)
---
Well there is the 25% spr to sp/hsp talent in Holy and the 10% extra healing done talent as well in Holy.
---
Anyone leveling will find their life a living hell.
---
I didn't say I didn't know how to tank Scholo, merely that the mechanics in Scholo are a pain in the ass compared to just about every other dungeon previous. 
---
The 5 skeletons before the boss that are literally untankable because they stop their aggro table are an example. Are they hard? No. Switch to a two hander and DPS them down using taunt to keep them off your healer. 
---
Are they a completely random mechanic to give 5 mobs that appear nowhere else in the dungeon? Yup.
---
Ye I play firemaw to its an awesome server
---
Those pug loots. Just saw a toep go to a resto druid.
---
&gt; What kind of relation is that?
---
A long term one.  It helps if your SO games too.
---
I need some help too.
---
I'm new to game, got a undead warlock lvl 49 (alch and taloring), but after reading that Orc is OP, i created a orc warlock.
---
I used my gold to have a edge leveling my orc, purchased movement speed to a grey boots to use in alts and i'm at lvl 27 already.
---
As i said, my main is Alch and Taloring, mainly for transmute and mooncloth.
---
As i trying to level fast, i got no professions on him. What profession should i get on him?
---
The orc warlock will be mais main and my undead will be just for transmute and mooncloth.
---
I dont think he was being literal.. or even talking about IRL for that matter
---
FYI you're also being downvoted because your reply added virtually nothing to the discussion. "Just deal with it" is more or less a useless response. Useless responses get downvoted.
---
I've only ever healed warriors in BRD that were dual wielding.  The one that was prot/fury spec and actually wearing plate was very easy to heal.  Yes I had to drink after every 2 or 3 pulls, but the runs were much faster than they would have been with only 3 DPS.  The tank being #1 or #2 on the dps meters actually speeds things up.
---
Now when they're wearing their DPS set of mixed leather/mail/plate while tanking, then the damage can be too spiky.  I would advise that they at least wear their tank armor.
---
Its UBRS, Scholo, and Strat where the tank really must use a shield.  Lower dungeons the incoming damage just isn't enough to warrant it imo.
---
Probably a few gold at least. Cassandra’s grace is a boe blue, level 42 cloth hat that goes for 150/200 gold on my server but has some stats as well
---
MS &gt; OS still allows for a classification of what is considered loot for each class. This is the same situation as a healer rolling on ring of spell power. It may technically be an upgrade for that healer at that time but it's a dps caster ring so should only count as main spec for dps casters. Brutality blade is a melee dps sword and should only count as MS for melee dps.
---
Four of us found a guild full of people we liked pre-launch and rolled on a server with all of them. 2 of us, we always knew we would actually hit 60 and play the game a lot, have done so. 
---
The other two friends well, one of them acted SUPER gung ho, planning to play together and all, but then come level 35 in the second week just disappeared. They're level 37 now, and when asked where they've been I get weird non answers. It's very confusing because like..if the game isn't fun don't play it bro? We just wonder where he went. 
---
The third guy is like 45 and crawling to sixty. He'll probably get there like 5 months in because after the first 2 weeks he went to maybe 3-4 hrs a week of playtime
---
Spoiler, world first Nefarian will go to a US guild.
---
Should I run Stockade? I can never find a group. Where is it? What level?
---
Why do you want to repeat raids for a whole year? That sounds boring as shit.
---
Yeah, my good buddy already did, hardly to level 20. Talked a big game and was hyped about it, but just slowed down really quickly. When I asked what was up (I parked my mage and worked on alts as I was waiting for him) he said "it just isn't doing anything for me, I've done all this content already." Like, no shit, that was the point.
---
Aye. The conclusion I've drawn is that, under ideal circumstances and a certain gear setup, arms is a toss up vs fury. But outside of those conditions, arms is worse.
---
All my gold came from mining and selling good greens on the AH actually. I have herbalism but I've been saving all my herbs to power alchemy at 60. Honestly though, just vendoring mats from gathering professions should get you most of the way there by 40 if you don't buy unnecessary skills or go crazy buying gear on the AH evey few levels.
---
Who cares how someone wants to live their life. As long as they are happy.
---
It’s just a 5man dungeon. Were you going to take the day off from work or something?
---
Your response was useless and added nothing to the discussion. The comment I responded to was useless and added nothing to the discussion.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's gonna impact the economy like it did in vanilla.
---
Sell everything at the AH, and I mean everything. I had 108g at level 40, I got to 60 with 530g, I'm skinning mining, and herbs sells better on my server so you should have better economy by my understanding
---
Yes thats how it is.  
---
You have to go through several zones at the same time. Always keep in mind your questlog is limited to 20 quests you can accept at once.  
---
Dont make the mistake and try to do quests more than 2 levels above you (unless you are lucky and there is a group inviting you for it). It's better to come back later and do this.  
---
To make this all a bit easier to see where you need to go next I recommend the Addon Questie. It shows all the possible quests with levels on the map. But for a clean classic experience you should only use this when you dont know what to do next.
---
They'll go up to 100g after a few months
---
I hope you’re trolling I really really do.  Being NEET on welfare playing video games 15 hours a day is a pathetic existence.  Being a CEO or a partner making a shit load of money, building your resume, accumulating real life wealth, sure it’s time consuming, but it’s something to actually be proud of
---
Classic leveling is more of a grind, retail endgame is more of a grind.
---
Haha wow, did about 30 anger runs because my addon said it drops
---
I dunno I have a level 43 Warlock and 36 Paladin and I've never seen any one wait for so long or say anything that I am doing wrong. Are they all idiots?
---
Why do you have to talk shit, jesus. You don't need to praise them, just don't be a dick.
---
Most are on welfare so pretty much.
---
That hardly seems economical.
---
I know you're joking but a black lotus goes for what, 60g, so even if they controlled the market and went at 120g or something silly, that's 0.6g per person for the time spent.
---
Wouldn't the extra crit also benefit TPS though ? Obviously don't sacrifice points in defiance though
---
Yes, but honestly we need to test it. Blizzard could have put some methods in place to safeguard against Tribute solo/duos (I feel like they would have stayed that by now so probably not). Private servers are obviously not accurate, and the only evidence we have of vanilla is proof a hunter can do it solo unless I missed other videos
---
What unit frames add-on is that?
---
Source?  Epic mount quest is phase 2.  Quest giver is part of that content update.
---
It's just bizarre to me that PvE servers don't flag players for entering zones controlled by the other faction.
---
Link?
---
It is not our fault MS is a dps gain in single target :(
---
Toughness is really only for when you need filler to get deeper into the tree. Imp RF is an all or nothing get depending on whether you want to tank dungeons. Imp conc aura is mostly useless. You are already getting 70% pushback reduction from Spiritual Focus and the 30% from normal conc aura gives 100% pushback resist.
---
I would say to drop toughness and imp conc aura and put the points into guardians favor, righteous fury, and hammer of justice.
---
I also think you might want to narrow your focus. Choose either dungeon tanking and AoE farming or Healing and PvP.
---
Not exactly the same, but I had acquired a second dreadforge to put a weapon chain on, and it was still in my bags while we were raiding MC. I generally OT so I constantly switch from 2h to sword and board. My weapon swap macro started tripping out because there were 2 weapons of the same kind. I quickly realized the issue and deleted the second dreadforge so I wouldn't have to deal with it. Rip 6g
---
Seems like a viable approach for leveling when your next weapon upgrade is unpredictable.  Just skip the weapon spec talents and put those points in something else.
---
Since pre-31 you don't even have access to those talents, it really doesn't matter what weapon you're using as long as it's decently slow and 2h.
---
I'm still salty about being accused of planning to vendor the staff I picked up in deadmines that was 2x the DPS of my then-current 2h'er.  I used that thing for 10 levels till I got a Corpsemaker.
---
Our guild has a hybrid spec druid mainly healing and tanking when we need a fifth tank for certain. MC fights...
---
Oh I was looking at the link to the spell and not the item. Derp.
---
Tanking requires you to not be brain dead in dungeons, most players can’t achieve that to be a “good tank”
---
The world that includes warlock lifetap.
---
DM came out literally 2 weeks later than it is now in vanilla.  The economy survived then.
---
There's an &lt;APES&gt; video where a gnome with blessing of protection baits out an entire horde raid in Un'Goro. Then &lt;APES&gt; jumps out of a fucking tree and pops a bunch of sappers. They slowfell from Tanaris onto a fucking tree in Un'Goro.
---
Their creativity and innovation got me really hyped for classic.

I highly doubt they originally planned to release phase 2 less then 2 months after classic launched, especially  when that's about how long it takes most people to even reach 60. Hell, I only just hit 60 yesterday with most of my guild reaching within the past week or will be hitting this week. Not everyone has the time to devote to this game like they did in 2004.
---
Honestly, I swore I'd never do this. But after leveling in STV for the last three days, I'm a changed person.
---
There's no mega reason, they're definitely not a must have, but for analysing how you're doing, especially with classes you might not be familiar with, is one reason. Or a raid leader seeing if someone is just being carried. Or perhaps to spy on other players playing your class to see how they're playing relative to you. All fairly minor, but still justifiable uses in my mind.
---
oh i agree, personally i never watch videos , i dont learn anything from them. ill read the abilities of the boss to know what to expect but then i just learn on the spot. i did that for every single tier of raiding from vanilla to Legion (didnt play bfa)
---
It's all fucked. The server queue garbage screwed all three of my friend groups. We're all fractured.
---
You have to specify the skill.
---
Devoting your entire life to a video game is pathetic. I'm sorry if it hurts your feelings but it is. Now I'll still respect the work that people have put into a game like this, but it doesn't mean I also still don't think it's pathetic. No normal human being should be doing any activity for that amount of time, period.
---
Playin devils advocate here but on Whitemane trade chat constantly has people complaining that they have nothing to do, and I’m not even 60 but I’ve done all the major content except the two raids. I think just adding pvp would be enough, there’s already a good amount of pve content. The players who prefer pvp don’t really have anything to do right now in this game.
---
Though this was related to tim and eric before i opened it...

Slight disappointment
---
whats the feature
---
Just because it'll go faster.  Waiting even a little bit for a 60 means a way faster run, it is often worth it.
---

Yep OT tries to stay around 10 on aggro when she flies. Then he just pops all cooldowns when she lands and should be able to pick her up.
---
\#Somechanges!  Just give me dual specc and I'll be happy
---
This happened to me too. The person who got me into it was like really pressing me to do it and I was the one who was like “nah I never made it to 60 before it’s going to get boring.” Now I’m sitting here, completely addicted (lol), with an Alliance lvl 60 (was going to roll Horde but admittedly I had way more fun playing a different faction). The only thing I’m super annoyed about is that I’m on West Coast and they got me to sign up for an East Coast server so I’m sitting here with a Lvl 60 with a constant 60ms ping (which I know isn’t huge in WoW but it’s definitely a reminder that I’m not on West Coast servers), and I only had one option for a guild that fit my schedule.
---
No pvp lol
---
evading mobs to reset them isn't a bug, a bug is an unintended interaction
---
in most mmos prior to wow if you found a way to create a gap between you and a melee-only mob (most mobs) that they were incapable of crossing (i.e. by "perching" on an object that requires jumping to get on top of), they'd simply stand there and stare at you like idiots while you killed them
---
asheron's call 2, which released about two years before wow, eventually implemented a system that detected when you killed a mob by "perching" (mostly by seeing if the mob was able to do any damage to anything during the fight) and then gave you a reduced xp reward as a penalty. i believe everquest has a similar system
---
believe it or not, evade "glitching" mobs is an intended feature of wow's code - it's to prevent "perching," which was a very common tactic in mmos prior to wow, from being a viable grinding strategy
---
its slow if you just need to kill 20 mobs one at a time to not need to rest and eat.
---
You only switch to daggers to reduce the competition for swords in your guild.
---
Cheap shit sell in stacks, expensive mats one at a time.
---
Look on the AH and compare to what's listed.
---
No one knows your server and faction and even if we did, we would have to do the same thing to get a realistic price.
---
There are a handful of people that make legit money streaming WoW. Let's not pretend that's the norm by any means, most people that nolife wow even if they stream dont make good money.
---
druid tank here. most of the time i dont have many issues - however some pugs can be a real pain when players lack common sense, especially pertaining to threat. It helps to know the best route and pulls, otherwise yyoure going to be in for a mess. I always have to announce when im losing, and god forbid dps remember the mob prority order. 
---
Most dps only care about doing more damage than thr other dps. so some will pull just to get that extra attack padded in there. then once 1 dps pulls, they all start trying to compete.
---
DPS - please stop being 4 year olds
---
My personal preference is if I have a full 20 then I sell by full stack (or if the mats stack by 10s or 5s, whatever the max stack size is). If not then I sell by 5s and then the leftover I sell in singles.
---
They should just let it happen. Let people be bored. Classic probably isn't going anywhere. No plans for classic+ or tbc, so once naxx is out people are just going to get bored and quit. Let it be slow.
---
Charms for the WW axe are selling great too, but I'd go for any of the none fire ones since ppl usually farm for elemental fire which cheapens the burning charm value
---
nice bait
---
Demand is not the sole driver of prices. If people have a lot more gold, they will be more likely to buy things they do not consider to be immediately necessary. This will naturally drive the prices up.  
---
Spending 100g on something when you only have 300g is a big deal, but spending 100g when you have 3,000g isn't such a big purchase anymore.
---
See dying animal that you cannot save. it's suffering. Put it out of it's misery but by doing so it hurts them because you can't one shot it. Get stronger. come back and one shot them and end their suffering. 
---
I don't see the problem tbh. How does it make you a psycho to euthanize someone who is suffering? I do the same to the diseased deer in Darkshore. I also try to kill the wolves before they kill the bunnies. People out here immersing themselves and actually RPing a bit and you suggest therapy?
---
Right that's kind of been my assumption, but no one knows for certain as far as I can tell. Except for the people downvoting me.
---
could somebody show a video of it exact?
---
&gt;makes me regret rolling on a pvp server
---
Laughs in Stalagg alliance
---
My server just had a sudden uptick in people looking to run deadmines and a snide remark about recruiting for the one thats open which then sparked the age old debate of VC or DM
---
He sounds stubborn. Even if he's done it without issues before he has to be willing to adapt to THIS tank. He's trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
---
Me (healer 56) and a tank (60) cleared the first half of a mara princess run waiting for the rest of the party to gather around one player that had a staff for 15 minutes. This game is NOT hard.
---
OT should be picking her up in P3. Pop recklessness/deathwish etc should be easy to grab her.
---
Bruh, what? Are you okay?
---
Idk what you mean as a big commitment, but started a new character 6 days ago and i'm at lvl 27 already.
---
I used the gold from my previous char to bank the new one and buy some things, like boots with 8% movement speed bonus.
---
Probably will take more 4-5 days to get to 35.
---
Idk what profession to get on this new char, as it will be my main.
---
What is a pug, and how this term born?
---
It's likely auto-mod removing your posts because it's hitting a report threshold. Not everything is a conspiracy.
---
That sounds like a weird meme troll to be honest. I've never heard that uttered once and I'm on a 2 layer server that's hi pop... I mean who would even be saying that in a general chat channel? It's troll 101..
---
I completely agree, in another posts I've mentioned that I believe they will make wsg / honour P2.5 while they solve layering. That's immense content when you factor into PvP gear, the PvP itself, and twink alts.
---
Theorycrafting source would be Fight club discord. They also make spreadsheets and simulations for warrior dps (arms/fury). Their BiS gear sheet is also more indepth and overall more accurate when compaired to BiS classic or wowhead.
---
I prefer tanking for guild groups over pugs. If I know an instance well enough, or just really need something from a dungeon (like unyielding maul later today), then I'll pug. But I don't like leading a dungeon when I don't know it well enough. You pull one group wrong and someone may flip a shit. Then attack the wrong mob, get aggro, and flip shit again. Not worth the stress for me.
---
there was absolutely no reasoning for it to get removed. much like i expect to happen on this post. wait 10 minutes and come back. itll probably be silently removed
---
It's not censorship, they're just removing shit threads. And no, they don't get them all.
---
Tbh I think their PR team is having a global meltdown lol.
---
Yeah but you won't get first dibs at a lot of gear with most guild unless you're raid ready, at least in my experience. So you'll have to wait your turn for a couple lockouts
---
😭
---
Eh too late to preach that. DM already coming out to appease them.
---
I was thinking diff class, I'm enchance shaman with shield, for me its generally just faster to kill 2 one on one while using mana, then not use mana on 3rd. then to take everyone at once.
---
I totally get if you don't like leveling! Play however you want. But yeah, if you blasted to 60 in the first few weeks you shouldn't be trying to press Blizz for faster content.
---
Itll come in 0-infinity minutes, chill.
---
Pick up group, it’s an acronym
---
Pick up group. Because you just pick up a bunch of people to fill slots.
---
Swap druid and mage
---
Serpent bloom snakes make WC their main territory but they are very evasive species stretching all the way to durotar! You need to cut the heads off immediately!! They are decimating the scorpion population, their main diet is their eggs.... we need to bring awareness to this!
---
thanks a ton
---
Mob re-spawning mechanics is also not Vanilla. That has certainly made an impact on inflating the economy.
---
The few times i've ran UD side its been a breeze, living has been a waking nightmare every time
---
Not at all...  
---
I was on my Warlock this weekend running SM and a piece dropped with some spell damage on it and our healing priest actually asked if it was ok if they rolled also and I said “Go for it”
---
It’s SM - not sure why people get bent out of shape.  A run takes thirty minutes tops.
---
Were you looking for upgrades before scholo?
---
removing threads is literally censorship
---
As a druid tank that recently stopped playing. Most of my pre bis/bis are very niche and situational to content that isnt out yet. Unlike most dps who just need to max dps, a tank needs to do a pretentious task of grinding forever to do professions to craft these niche items, do unconventional dungeon runs for specific boss drops, and the rest, for content that wont be released until a good year or so. 
---
Like a movie with bad pacing it becomes uninteresting. 
---
Leveling was a blast though. The best experience in an mmo ive ever had.
---
At least you can get tier set pieces, as fury I won't get them until every tank would have them, even boe pieces went to tanks
---
thats still a form of censorship
---
It’s a centaur skin.
---
Technically yes and it gives you more rage. But you have to gauge for yourself what you're sacrificing to gain that couple points of extra crit. You're either losing survivability in Last Stand or an extra block every time you use shield block.
---
They can check more than that.  You can check for active stances, you can check for channeling condition, you can check for pet (and which pet, in the case of warlocks).
---
late response so I expect this will get buried.
---
I tank pugs to level, I've tanked a lot of pugs.  I'm currently wrapping up my tour of Zul Farrak having gone from 45 to 48 in there.
---
I rarely have the issues y'all are talking about.  I think its because I'm a chatty tank.  Before first pull I'm already saying how I like to do things and what I expect from everyone.  If I know one person is likely to be a threat problem due to being outleveled I whisper them and ask for their help.  I remind people of basics.  I call targets, pats, aoe, etc.  I even asked a rogue to be on totem patrol as it makes the run smoother.
---
As a benefit to managing pulls, focusing targets, clearing totems etc, I can move from pack to pack and the whole dungeon goes faster and people see that and respond when we dont have to break after every pull since the drinkers need their fix.
---
If you set expectations, communicate, and are polite people generally will listen.
---
Thats because private server hosts actually care
---
There's literally a video of how to kite with him teleporting to you. You viper sting the mage and kite him on an upper edge. The only real question is if we can tank or cheese his charge that's a likely one shot.
---
Jealousy
---
How is this a radical change? I'm confused why you are going on about layering and have determined they have no strategy on removing them. Why do you think that?
---
Not if they are rule breaking threads.
---
Inflation is why I have held onto every single decent item I would have otherwise auctioned straight away. 
---
I’m broke now though :(
---
I use the prebis list to decide what dungeons to run. I just go for whatever I feel like doing thay day or my friends also need. I use the other lists to compare what I have with something that drops since it effectively ranks them.
---
What do you mean, I get a neat list of nearby targets to kill, that's the opposite of pissing us off
---
"Not there! There!"
---
For raiding they can absolutely be helpful. As the raid starts to get geared *and* people manage aggro they can make runs go faster. The problem (currently) is that not everyone is geared appropriately and not as many people know how to manage threat.
---
There's a reason that hunters early on can out-dps in a raid: FD drops aggro constantly so we don't have to back off as much as a rogue or mage should. As gear progresses hunters usually drop back a bit, then can top again as we can still aggro dump (range also helps).
---
\&gt; literally comparing a person who plays video games all day everyday to a successful CEO
---
bruh...
---
I wonder if anyone has done some analysis of this. But I guess the sooner you buy them the better return of investment. Except if a 14 slot randomly drops
---
where are the spawn points?
---
I have a weak aura that has a sheep timer, so you'll have to download weak auras first and then input the aura string from waigo.com
---
Took me around 5-10 minutes of kiting id guess. Whole run probably. 20 minutes but only cause i pulled an extra pack enroute to princess. 
---
Hope this helps!
---
Ain't nothing wrong with needing a break in the middle of the dungeon. My groups either continue on with one man down for a few minutes, or we all agree on a quick break and do whatever for a few minutes. Water, stretch, snack, bathroom, smoke, doesn't matter.
---
beautiful.
---
truly a Shepard.
---
Suggesting changes that were not part of vanilla are against sub rules.  Deal with it.  There’s an entire different subreddit for discussing changes for classic.  Go there and talk about it.
---
So I play warrior. Here is why it's frustrating to tank.
---
* DPS will not let me build threat.
---
Look, as a warrior tank I do not have AoE threat. I can't thunderclap in D-stance, if I stance dance I lose rage (yes I have tactical mastery). So my options are tab-sunder and cleave.
---
Don't open up as soon as I charge in. Don't AoE after 2 seconds. I can not hold the aggro because I don't have any AoE threat generation. And what I can do, cannot keep up with your aggro gen.
---
So inevitably, the hunter multi-shots, the warlock tab-dots, they pull 2 of the 3, then I can taunt one back to me, but now they're also main-rotation on my original target so I lose that one.
---
And I spend all my time playing hot-potato because the DPS don't realize this isn't retail and I don't generate 10,000 threat from a single auto attack.
---
And when one of them dies I get blamed for "not holding aggro". Well fuck you. Here's how DPS goes if you have a warrior tank:
---
* Tank charges in
---
 * You do nothing
---
* Tank Thunderclaps (this is to put minor threat to prevent healer aggro)
---
* Tank sunders main target
---
 * You can now auto attack if you must
---
* Tank gets 2 sunders on main target
---
 * You may now begin your DPS rotation on that single target
---
Pally tanks (if alliance) and Druid tanks have much better AoE threat gen. We warriors don't. So DPS who are used to retail and don't understand how threat works in classic making us play hot-potato and ping-pong between mobs make tanking frustrating as all hell. Then blame us for not "holding aggro". There is absolutely no possible way a warrior tank can hold aggro on 3 mobs from a warlock or mage AoE. I can hold one, I can probably hold 2 by taunting him back when he drops, and applying a sunder. I can not hold 3 or more reliably. So don't blame me when you open up with rain of fire as soon as I charge in before I'm even in D-stance.
---
This is why people don't want to tank.
---
He is kinda behind/beside the inn, a “bowyer” or “fletcher” I believe
---
Just was one of those where it was a lot of effort for very little reward (my main is a priest)
---
Quite obviously a response to the paper clip that posted above.
---
"Pick-up Group" (PUG) is a term for a casual game of e.g. basketball where all comers may join or substitute is when one of the existing players departs.
---
This and hunter melee weaving is just silly. Hopefully it doesn't become expected, it's just unnecessary with how easy the content is.
---
Unstable doesn't mean bad/dead.
---
Because every APES thread gets way overblown in typical reddit fashion. Of course people will try to bring people back down to earth.
---
It’s almost like you want to be reported
---
Strat UD is really bad if the tank doesn't have experience in it. If they know about all the pats and how to LOS then yeah it's pretty quick and easy
---
pick up group, born a long time ago for online games not just wow
---
Yeah, WOTLK is cancer
---
Needs two more toons:

---
One of the main issue from what I've seen a few people, especially those who didn't keep up with the private server meta and/or just coming back from a long hiatus of playing WoW is that they have this old idea that the *de facto* tanking build **has to be** full *Protection*, this is not true, and this same idea prevented (or at least makes it harder for) tank mains to solo farm and do "fun" stuff outside of raids and dungeons. 
---
Every tank mains that I play with (non-pugs) are all Fury-Prot tanks. And they have no issues with the usual farm or even DPSing here and there whenever they're bored without having the need to swap specs. I think that people who've played private servers knows this is just the better way to go overall as a tanking spec, and there's now quite a bit of resources and guides to help players that's not used to the idea of Fury tanking (Skarm's vids comes to mind).
---
But we are going to pretend people who play wow professionally, at any level, dont have a source of income allowing them to do so?  Lmfao this sub.
---
at one of those lines. i dont worry about specific spawn points TBH
---
Really good post. Don't need to hold every enemy. Prio melee elites, then caster elites, then everything else. Don't waste rage pulling non-elites off anyone. 
---
On my priest I tell tanks to use a 2hander and dps too. Nothing hits hard enough to need a shield, with a few exceptions.
---
So, like not at all?
---
I doubt the veracity of his story
---
Like at no point in buying a page of mats did he think to himself, "either 20 people are idiots or I'm the idiot. Maybe I should wowhead this to refresh my memory"
---
Seems unlikely anyone would be this dumb then assume other people are this dumb and need to be warned about it
---
Maybe my faith in humanity is too high
---
Of the 7 people I knew who played we are down to 2. Boy am I glad I switched to the busy server the one remaining player rolled on. Downed Rag for the first time the other day.
---
This. It's really not that hard. You roll for the role you're playing in the group, OR you make it clear that you're rolling as another role at the start and check if everyone's okay with it. Next time a resto druid wins your attack power ring or 2h mace "for feral" don't come back bitching about it.
---
What's the rationale behind this?
---
Is there any particular way you use the long list on Shadow Panther?
---
It is 100% better. You will clip auto attacks with Striker's mark when using Aimed Shot causing you to actually do less damage.
---
Did it have a cool down when you got a new one or is this a hack to get home without giving it a cool down
---
I keep pets visible on VuhDo because I want to save them from dying when possible (say, Herod's whirlwind that hits them pretty hard); they're a big part of hunter dps. That said, unless they're going to die Right Now, I don't bother too much. It's just not worth my time/mana.
---
On my hunter, I bandage my pet when necessary. If it dies I'll just revive.
---
Priests of both factions can dispel it and priests are one of the stronger classes to twink at 19, it’s still very powerful especially since trinket options at 19 are just three in total.
---
You really just do standard healing build.  What's more important is stacking int/stam gear.
---
Most of them have jobs, why are people so salty about apes?

When you're the majority faction and win, it doesn't feel good and when you lose it feels super bad.

When you're the minority and win it feels awesome and when you lose it doesn't feel too bad.

This is dead wrong.  Every warlock should be life tapping as much as they can and every healer should be healing him to top him off.  Life tap is a tool that allows the warlock to absolutely blow up dps meters, because he can just keep on chugging and not worry about mana issues.  This speeds up dungeon runs by a huge margin.  If you are a healer that is unwilling to heal a warlock you are simply not good at math.  Lets recap, In order to fully heal a warlocks health bar to full, requires nothing more then 1 large heal from the healer, which on average would use no more then the healers 8% mana in total, but it provides the warlock 100% of his mana.  You are exchanging a couple of seconds of your drinking time for a whole 30 of his.  And he is the one tha's blowing up the dungeon, he is the one that can make this dungeon 30% faster.  So you are only gimping yourself and the group by not healing the warlock.  TIME is the most precious thing we have in the game, not gold, not mana water...time.  And if you can do dungeons faster then you should do it faster.  And this is coming from a tank/healer/warlock alt.  There is never any excuse to not heal a lock.  In my groups when I heal, I always tell the locks tap as much as they want, I just want them to blow shit up so I can finish the dungeon faster, and it has never been an issue healing them, if you have problems healing them you need to get better gear.
---
Got this when I stayed home from work sick one day playing at like 9a. One Warlock fought me for it. I killed his pet and sheeped him and lolled the fuck outta there. He hunted me down like 3 minutes later but it was worth it
---
Nost boasted 10k players at launch
---
Classic a couple moreso
---
I mean knowing someone in APES I can confirm that most are Danish/British NEETs
---
And yet...you keep replying.
---
More people on a server = more gold in circulation, more demand, more supply.
---
You get faerie fire feral in the feral talent tree. Can use that to pull without switching forms
---
What's a good server to play alliance on? I want to reroll a gnome mage but don't want to be dominated with a terrible horde to alliance ratio. This would be PVP, US
---
I didn’t really have issues in low levels, but in general pre-hotting bear then demo shout gave enough AOE threat to actually put up with the zergaloid DPS and still keep Aggro.
---
Come around to 60, my bear threat isn’t much different, but the dps is doubling/tripling from leveling. Rogues have tons of hit now and way better weapons, pre-raid, etc. Mages have gone from +30 spell power to + 300 spell power.
---
The biggest issue is the Mobs/bosses at 60 are actually pretty tough if not done right. If threat is going all over the place at the end of Strat UD people die
---
I'm was guilty of this while leveling.
---
I'd gladly tank (love it actually), but other warriors were rarely invited. Same with my healer friend, if he didn't want another shaman on board then oh well.
---
Tanks and healers are in demand, I guess we can afford to be a bit picky.
---
H.nova gets like 14% from spellpower, so yes its true.  Stack hp and mana, and use your standard talent build.
---
I think you may be right. Honestly, I was just parroting what I've been repeatedly told by others.
---
Doing my own research, Dire Maul was originally released on patch 1.3 but the Paladin and Warlock epic mount were added in patch 1.4, which was when PvP honor was released.
---
Sadly the diamonds are the least expensive part of those xD
---
Libram (~20g ish) + money cost (~30g ish) + reagents (priceless) + black diamond (20c-20s)
---
Sorry :p
---
lol, nice.
---
Waiting for the real BiS Polymorph Turtle
---
Arms is still way better. Sweeping strikes and tactical mastery are way too important.
---
-1, another friend leveled a second 60 on our server so he could play with us.
---
I'm not asking for it to be priced, but is it something worth equipping? I don't know healer stuff maybe there's a comparable quest reward, or healers don't even stack healing power over int, it seems like a good twink item but do ppl twink healers, etc. Things like that
---
As a healer, every leveling tank needs to hear this. Way too often do I hear “yeah I don’t have tanking gear.” What’s even worse is if I’m in a dungeon, the tank is wearing leather or doesn’t have a shield and I very clearly say “hey need the next shield or plate mail piece next time one drops just in case” and they never do.
---
Why would there be a market for skeleton keys? Only blacksmiths can use them at a slightly lower level than the crafting level of them. 
---
However you can create Mithril Spurs which are very useful at 235. You can currently apply them for other people who already bought it, but that gives no skill in it. Later you can create the thorium shield spikes which are very good, but that requires the pattern and level 275.
---
I find it to be more druids or shaman. Tauren hate me because I conjure burgers instead of bread.
---
Those are pretty big reasons. I'm the warlock class lead in my guild/raid. I'm always checking my other lock's DPS to make sure they aren't using DOTs and giving any tips. It also shows me who has the best gear and will put out the most DPS so I can take them off curse duty or let them play DS/Ruin instead of SM/Ruin.
---
If it was my pug and a brutality blade dropped i wouldn't bother giving it to a hunter, rogue/warrior only.
---
DM didn’t ruin the economy in vanilla and it won’t ruin it here

“Tanking is the most demanding role in a party and you should be GLAD that the rest of your party is making it even harder by being impatient dumbasses! CHARACTER! Uphill both ways! In the snow! During a heatwave! Barefoot! WharrgARRRRNBLE KIDS THESE DAYS!”
---
Leader will swap after 2 minutes or so.  So you log out, log into alt, wait the 2 minutes for leader to pass over, reset and go again.
---
I haven't been all about the #nochanges life and dual spec is a big reason. I play Pally and would kill to be able to switch it up. That is probably the biggest quality of life change I would implement but not complaining since the game is just so fun as is. I've been tanking as a bit of a hybrid spec and let everyone know to kill skull and let my consecrate build aggro on the rest. If they decide to nuke something different I don't chase, they die, and the mob comes back for the most part.
---
I hope you didnt put points into Thick Hide because that is a waste in the long run
---
What classes are the best for farming gold other than mage?
---
All 6 of them. They weren’t ready for this type of game after playing retail a little.
---
For me, school started the same day it released, and I just cant keep doing both at the moment, as much as Id like to play. Got to level 42 like 3 weeks ago and havent had the time to level anymore to be honest.
---
So you think having horde dominated servers when phase 2 rolls around is going to be okay?
---
We already have seen alliance transfer off of servers where they were disadvantaged, causing a negative feedback loop. What do you think will happen when they add the rank system?
---
yeah kinda. not many shields drop from bosses that people commonly want to make runs for in that range
---
Nice dude that’s the rare one In my experience
---
JEEEZ
---
Affects the whole server as Devilsaur leather is a huge profit item.
---
Follow up, how can I play wow all day and not have to have a job?
---
For things like petattack or equipslot, you don't use /cast, and you put the conditions afterwards. For example;
---
/petattack [@mouseover, harm, nodead]
---
/petfollow [mod:shift]
---
Is a macro I use for pets/demons.
---
nothing in the hud options seems to have fixed it
---
Hello guys. Feral tank here, got to 60 yesterday and wondering what to do first. Only did BRD runs, no LRBS/UBRS or Strat and Scholo. I have a correct gear but I'm not sure what do I need to do to prepare myself for the early raids. Is UBRS "hard" to do ?
---
Also, herbo/alchemy, if that matters. Thanks !
---
Jesus that's insane.  30-40s on mine.
---
Thanks
---
Great, now Ninja\_Jezus is going to fall off. :(
---
fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff :\
---
Classic's version of Track Humanoids also doesn't differentiate been Horde, Alliance, and NPCs. So if I see a dot on my map that isn't moving like an NPC, I still need to get eyes on them or /tar them to know if it's an enemy player.
---
Blessing of sanctuary is trash compared to holy shock, holy shock makes single target threat actually viable, and you don’t actually need more AE threat.  Plus, holy shock is pretty amazing for healing and is a significant source of damage while solo
---
You really should max out RF if you plan on tanking dungeons
---
Besides, wisdom and Kings are already better tank blessings
---
why don't you sit at your pc and press a button every 30 seconds for 5 hours and tell me that it didn't require effort
---
Jobless you mean. I have 1 60 Rogue with Pre-Raid BIS with some Raid items and took 1 week off from work to even do it.
---
&gt; you 
---
its in the latest dev release
---
My point remains.  DPS don't wait for tanks to build threat.
---
They open up as soon as I charge in, I've seen AoEs start before I even reach my target. And it's frustrating as all hell. So I'd rather just DPS.
---
Faerie fire then roar then spam swipe or maul depending on # of targets. Use taunt on units that come off your initial pull.
---
This kind of dialog happens a lot even on retail normal quests
---
Imagine having your life, checking random people's comments on forums. What a loser.
---
Wouldn’t be too hard to do, assuming some parameters.  
---
I would propose - for the sake of this analysis - we assume a few things to be true.  
---
A) The avg player is between 50-60 (this way we get good value but also a realistic view as they aren’t hitting molten core or farming BRD all day). 
---
B) the upgrade is from four 14s to four 16s, so eight bag slots.  
---
   
---
Using these standards (and that can be changes too of course), all you would have to do is kick out big outliers (boe epics, arcaninte, etc.), determine what 1/8 of your loot costs with 64 slots (8 extra slots out of 64), maybe do this calculation 50ish times if possible (the more the better), and you’ve got a rough estimate of how much gold you make extra with those bags!
---
I wish they had shown the chat freaking out lmao
---
I would love to see the salt from people if Blizz fixed the instance so it's not soloable
---
Get 1 extra battle res
---
I didn't think the "Spy" adddon worked outside of WoW but as soon as I opened this thread I got an alert that OP is a Rogue.
---
Would Felwood be a good place to level at 54? I haven't started there yet.  
---
It seems its a bit on the low end but I can get through quests faster, or should I go to a zone where the low end is closer to my level?
---
For easy pulls (1-3) mobs i just use feral faerie fire, or if i have rage left over (or enrage) - i just walk up to the group/charge. Make sure you mark primary target, as swipe isnt that great for keeping aggro TBH, but Maul is great for single target. DemoRoar also is a good way to pick up initial aggro. Then I alternate maul on mobs, with FFF.
---
For tough pulls - boss, or 3+ mobs - I will regrowth/rejuv/moonfire -&gt; bear form -&gt; enrage and Line of sight.
---
Ugh I was in a Scholo and no shit the lock killed themselves life tapping so hard. Honestly it gave me a bit of a laugh so I couldn’t be too mad.
---
I disagree it's a large jump from just having it on the screen. Yeah you could do the same thing by heavily studying the combat log but the spy addon trivializes it.
---
It ruins any element of self awareness that players need and turns it into oh let me check my list of nearby players instead of looking at the screen.
---
You should be able to hide in terrain and behind obstacles, and sneak up on people who are busy doing things. A 360 degree automated detecting radar fundamentally changes that.
---
I want sanc for solo AOE farm, is not having HS really going to hurt me that bad?
---
60, there's areas where body pulling is a risk.
---
Did you get the quest?
---
upon launch they needed to cap the factions, i think it was archage that had that, i remember not being able to make a cat person cause their faction was overpopulated or something.
---
I think its too late now to fix. Maybe just make small incentives to roll under populated factions.
---
Your math is incomplete and not accurate. Trust me on this, I have worked on Warrior theorycrafting for years.
---
Thrash Blade proc increases your total DPS by approximately 2.83%. This number will change slightly with gear and buffs.
---
This number is based on my spreadsheet, which takes almost everything into account, compared to your napkin math.
---
We use an addon to test those proc rates. You can join Discord here  https://discord.gg/caHHNcA
---
No, I believe I put my points into feral instinct (I think it's called) instead of thick hide. But if the build isn't working out for me I would respec later on down the road at 60 to make sure I'm properly set up.
---
Fucking gamer RGB!
---
the one big elephant in the room that everyone is ignoring. somedays that just like real life
---
Being higher level into EPL is more valuable than grinding at the end. Either way it's the same destination different route.
---
Oh, look over there, a Millennial is trying to be sarcastic. lol
---
Thats a tank issue, not a dps Warrior issue.
---
Can i get mage water at 57?
---
People will absolutely want you to run Stocks with them.
---
Congrats ... but why? Why would anyone subject themselves to that? Not only no deaths, but no buffs or stat gear to boot?
---
I mean, if you like suffering this much, there are some lovely ladies with a taste for PVC and leather that could help you out there. And I bet it would still be more pleasant than the above.
---
Complaining about what other people do in their own time is pathetic all the same
---
You chose to travel to the other side of Azeroth because you're a good person :) Don't feel bad about that!
---
What’s weirdchamp mean?
---
It's what 1% worse?
---
Really don't care, because the maul looks so much better than the shite model of the staff
---
The only people complaining about increased availability of a trade good are those who cornered the market and know that thier profit margins are going to decline
---
There can only by 4 alive at the same time.
---
I never have really made myself anything useful through BS. It seems all the required level gear you need requires higher mats then the areas you can access at that point. By the time you get to those areas you already have better gear then what you can make.
---
The only really useful item you can craft from BS is the Shining Silver Breastplate but even that you can replace with gear drops from dungeons easy.
---
Mind you I'm only about 230 skill myself. The biggest use I get out of BS is making a bunch of gear for my Enchanter friend to DE.
---
i am going to be a bit nitpickey and say that technically blizzard has never fixed this bug. the "fix" in cata was just to make them instant abilities since how heroic strike is programed in means it can never be fixed without a major recoding of the very core of the combat engine in the game. so if blizzard implemented the on next hit HC again it would still have this bug.
---
i knew about this bug back in TBC. most people considered it useless due to how swing timers worked out. it wasn't untill WotLK where gearing became so insane that this bug made it so you could keep HC up at all time.
---
The 5% crit boost is pretty big for raids. Not for healing output but for sustain, since Illumination makes crits refund mana cost. This is only a problem on longer fights and can mostly be compensated for with mana regen food.
---
That sucks. Is there a schedule for when p2 comes out? I've heard several dates.
---
Like.. real life winter?
---
Just wanted to say this is awesome
---
All of my friends just killed Ragnaros for the first time and I'm still level 54.  Gettin' there!
---
I'm dreading the open world turning into a warzone. Gonna be so hard to quest or get anything done.
---
You've got rookie numbers pleb. I play 10-15 minutes a night and I've already got 3000g easy. You should be ashamed to even call yourself a veteran.
---
Sitting in front of a screen playing a game is significantly worse for your health, and mental health, than hiking the PCT.
---
It should not be adorned.
---
There’s use and abuse.
---
When I miss being a literal nobody in the game I just confront real life to get the feeling
---
Paladins tanks are great doing dungeons leveling up they handle multiple mobs well.
---
I don't even PUG anymore for this reason and even in guild I only trust them about blowinh skull first so I let it be since they're starting to be geared and it doesnt have the time to hit them and up threat on others.
---
This one hit me. It took me, playing every day, about 6 months to hit 60. I was slow, I fucked around a lot, but I have no idea what I was doing then. A month and a half in now and I'm almost level 40, playing an average of &lt;2 hours per day. I've actually made it a *point* to fuck around, level all 5 professions, read quest text, group up, etc. and I'm like, quintupling my pace. I literally don't know what I was doing before, other than standing around in Orgrimmar talking to my friends.
---
Yep. 10PST
---
Long live the Queen!
---
Hots cant crit bud, you should not be using them to top people off. You are only gimping your heals. Hots are as backup heals during the fight.
---
This is a real money maker
---
Honestly ZF is still pretty simple to tank and will teach you how to LoS ranged mobs. Big mistake is not getting feral faerie fire, most leveling feral builds rush that talent so it’s weird you didn’t scoop it up, but you’re one level away so you should be fine just pre-hotting and using moon fire and then utilize furor to get a little bit of rage to demo roar. Only problem a new tanker will have to deal with is people who instant AoE or don’t focus your primary target, but that’s part of the learning process.
---
People hella mad at APES in comments. lul.
---
'GODDAMNIT THESE PEOPLE GET TO PLAY MORE THAN ME, AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY ALL GOOD AT THE GAME!? SOME OF THEM EVEN STREAM AND MAKE MORE MONEY THAN ME! FUCKING NO-LIFE LOSERS! GET A JOB!'
---
Envy and projection.
---
My point exactly. Why get bent out of shape for level 40 loot? Also, are you op? My question was kind of for the op.
---
It's in his loo table but it's like 2% chance according to atlas loot. Fineous has a 30% chance or something like that
---
There's no laws to follow or violate on international waters.
---
That sounds like aids to me. I will take the 3 man brawls over 2 raids of 60's fighting for a chest that's redic.
---
NAXX OUT! PogChamp
---
Ok. 
---
I’ve leveled fishing to 300 on 2 characters so far. Hulu on one screen, wow on the other. 
---
*It didn’t require any effort.*
---
it also grants you rage like a MH as well. big rage gains.
---
I feel you, got the same minus the 40 alt and I’m doing rotations in grad school :)
---
Respect
---
Honesltly the beginning of EPL questing is pretty good exp.
---
You intentionally ignored the part where he said 
---
&gt;UNLESS WoW actually IS our job (pro gamers, streamers, etc) but that would be an exception.
---
Hunter has the highest GPH in the game assuming tribute runs work the way they used to. Classes that can farm the lashers, which is basically every class with decent AoE, are fine too.
---
Have there be absolutely no devilsaur leather on the AH or in trade chat for 5 hours is a decent troll.
---
krom
---
and its not that bad here
---
Don't bother with 31 in holy. Noone use lightwell and it's a bad talent. 
---
21/30 skipping spirit of redemption and lightwell and picking up divine spirit in the discipline tree is the standard build that most use.
---
Writing my comment, I thought my sarcasm was very obvious. Apparently not. I was doing the exact same thing you did to me, just to the one I replied to.
---
And a lot of those are in apes..
---
Yer that's a form of grinding, sorry if it wasn't clear
---
Classes that are strong at soloing, hunters/druids/locks (depending what youre doing). All of those are great at farming devilsaurs for example.
---
So edgy huh?
---
Are you happy alone without relationships?
---
Good luck! Big hugs
---
I know!!! Someone put all that work for basically nothing.
---
RIP my UBRS run :'( I need it for my Rend head!
---
Dont forget the stupid fucking badges that made people skip Ulduar to get right into Tier 9 - the objectively worst raid tier ever...
---
You are going to have crazy agro problems if you ever tank a dungeon with your current spec.  It might be a great AE farm spec, but i doubt its viable for actual dungeon tanking
---
But with holy shock, you can still AE farm, just not quite as effectively.       And with RF +holy shock single target threat is much more viable
---
Imagine me as a druid tanking a dungeon and rolling need on all healing/dps/tank gear because I can do all the roles. Why would anyone run dungeons with me?
---
in the level 20-30 range it makes heroic strike spamming better than sunder spamming if you are DW. infact it work well untill 36 when you get whirlwind at which point a 2-hander is better. there is a good point around the 40s where you can go fury and use this but now you need to deal pretty well with HS cancel inorder for it to be worth it.
---
I have never, in my 75 years of playing MMORPGs, healed. Yet now I am considering rolling a paladin because I love it in retail and it is my favorite class fantasy.
---
My question: what is healing like and what are some tips and tricks you can give to someone who has only ever tanked or DPS'd?
---
During my last Stratholme run my groups' mage used all of his mana on Rammstein thus could do nothing when the skeleton swarm arrived
---
Because you also have health and mana bars in your character portrait? Just make those bigger if it's that important and save urself the extra space. You've also got player buffs shown in like 4 different spots 
---
??????????
---
Are you a mental heath specialist? Do you have some peer reviewed literature that supports this clame? Look I can do it too. Hiking the pct is horrible for your joints and musscles and can cause long term health damage from overused joints. The long periods of isolation and weather can be horrible for your mental health. It should not be adorned. There’s use and abuse.
---
You can objectively raid worse than another group. Just clearing it isn’t the end-all. You can try to clear it efficiently without “speed-raiding” (not even a term). 
---
Your whole argument is a non-sequitur; it is entirety meaningless in the context of the discussion. I don’t know why you wanna make this “point” so badly.
---
Is that what passes for a stunlock these days?
---
No you're about right if you arent getting all loot and looking at all only you are making.
---
I've been "selling" (as a healer) runs with a tank buddy where we get all loot besides whatever item the dps reserves.  Usually nets me 20-30g just in vendor blues/greens split between 2 ppl, and a ton more in DE'd mats/ah stuff.
---
People are cool with it because they're smooth runs with little to no issues and they're guaranteed the item they're after if it drops.
---
Phase two will become this mysterious "someday" event as blizzard slowly trickles us all the content but never turns layering off. They can't handle the player base and they fockin know it
---
None so far, also my wife is playing more than I am we are both still having a blast.
---
I've had numerous warriors tell me "yOu cOuLd aLwAyS gO dAgGeRs!!!1!" Yeah and you can always go 2H
---
It's been mages for me
---
Look for groups as a tank as opposed to dps?
---
questing. Burning steppes -&gt; ungoro -&gt; winterspring
---
This kind of psychopathic 10 hr a day camping lowbies shit shouldn't be encouraged.
---
Ty!
---
So, then it's probably not possible with priest unless  you get the mob killed and then come back and path there again, but it's pretty deep into the run.
---
Are alliance not eligible for "Smart Drinks"?
---
It starts in ratchet and it's a 2 quest chain.
---
The first is "Raptor Horns" which asks you to collect 5 raptor horns.  The next asks you to kill Ooze creatures in WC.  
---
I started WoW when I was in college, so I never played Alliance, but I'd have to imagine the quests are available for them too.
---
You’re right! I got some reason was reading you being 40 as you being 50. That really just makes it all the easier for you, gives you a solid 15 levels of simple dungeons to learn how to tank before you hit the harder stuff at 54. Just go run some dungeons where the mobs are all green for you to get a feel for it. Tanking really isn’t that difficult at your level, just kind of annoying.
---
Best way would be to grab a shield and start tanking :P It’s really important to start getting gear for 60, get BRD quests started and get your Onyxia and Princess quests started.
---
The reason you’re having trouble finding groups is 90% of warriors near or at max level don’t want to tank, and the tanks don’t want to compete for their BIS with another warrior, so your best bet becomes finding a group with a Druid tank which is rare
---
If you avoid the Baelgar trash mobs BRD is actually really easy
---
This was a fun read lol.
---
It definetely is sad.
---
I am quite depressed after playing for 6 hours straight in the weekend, imagina 15 everyday.
---
Vriska.
---
Well I mean there’s a reason there’s plenty of quests to kill stuff and no quests to rape anybody in the game.
---
I mean, the beat to *Stronger* is completely different from *Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger*. Kanye wrote a completely new track, he just used a Daft Punk sample to do it.
---
What talent allocation do you use right at 40? Would you post a calculator for reference?
---
That would break most addons. Also dmg meters
---
At level 40, I recommend practicing in scarlet monestary armory and cathedral. They're short dungeons, pretty straightforward, with few bosses, they're pretty much the appropriate level, and the pulls aren't terribly complicated (there's some places with patrols, which you'll learn quickly).
---
Now, general (druid) tanking advice:
---
* Watch your healer's mana. If he's over 50%, you're good for another pack. If you've just done 5 packs without breaks and he's at, say, 30%, you're probably still good for one more.
---
* When you've practiced a little, you can start chaining packs whenever your healer has enough mana: while the dps finish up the current pack, pull the next one and start building threat on them.
---
* if you have lots of rage, use faerie fire (feral) to pull
---
* if low on rage, shift out of bear, cast renew+rejuv on yourself (will generate extra aoe threat for you once you start taking damage), pull with moonfire and then back into bear form
---
* alternatively, instead of moonfire, go straight to bear form and charge. Depends on the situation. 
---
* don't worry if the dps pull one mob - as long as it's just one, and they're all hitting the same one, they'll kill it fast. Just focus on the rest of the pack. 
---
* maul is your best single target threat ability. If you have lots of rage, tab between targets and maul each of them
---
* swipe is more rage efficient, I believe, but doesn't do huge amounts of threat per target it hits (and remember it only hits 3). Use it to maintain threat when things are fine.
---
* demo roar is nice
---
* growl on cooldown, unless you have aggro on everything. Anything that hits the healer is the primary growl target
---
* don't remember the name, but you have another roar that's basically an aoe growl. Long cooldown, so use only if shit hits the fan.
---
* if growl is on cooldown, a couple of mauls on the mob targeting the healer will often do the trick.
---
I think that about it... The rest is learning the dungeons... Where to stand, what mobs to mark, etc.
---
The reason I picked healer over tank is because I wanted a raid spot. Leveling without a tank in party was a pain because it feels like dungeon queues lasted longer than it's taking to get to 60.
---
My dude you didn't understand my original post.
---
*I am targeting myself*.
---
The "portrait" your talking about is not my portrait, it's the target.
---
Level 60
---
You can do something like a Seal Fate build that is pretty good in both PvE &amp; PvP
---
Benediction is great! It's PVP, EST, and the ratio is very balanced.
---
Does king mosh count towards the 4?
---
honestly its irresponsible, too much power at my fingertips I get excited
---
Imagine having your life, wasting it constantly complaining on Reddit. What a loser
---
Ironic considering there isn't a hunter in the video
---
I got two blues from there that my warrior has been using for 5 levels so far.
---
HoJ is used for threat gear, it's a tank item.
---
Nah, that's a mithril casing. Engineers make those.
---
Getting rid of what functionality, exactly? Spy works by generating a list of names of Alliance players that showed up in the combat log and using /target when you click on one of the names in the list, it's much simpler than targeting by clicking on the map.
---
Imagine just doing something for fun in a video game, once.
---
Blame the playerbase attempting to big dick dps every dungeon in sight like their favorite streamers from top guilds. Shit's not fun to tank when you're literally only needed for boss fights and mobs immune to slows.
---
No it's not. It's literally just a joke mate
---
75 years of MMORPGs, damn.
---
Healing in classic is very simple, especially as a paladin. You're basically playing whack-a-mole with healthbars.
---
according to  [https://shadowpanther.net/weapons-pve.htm](https://shadowpanther.net/weapons-pve.htm) , for PVE, you should go skullforge Reaver / mirah's song

How each class can make gold in Dire Maul
---
the other day i hit 60 and my lockpicking was..poor we'll say that. I went to ZF and BRD for an hour or so pick pocketing every trash mob and made about 15g from items and silver, plus getting the extra lockboxes.
---
In dungeons where im in a group ill only start pick pocketing in the fights if i feel like were pretty comfortable, like a lot of guild runs im in where my DPS doesn't even matter as much because everyone is so well organized.
---
... A fury warrior in Arathi? What race? I was a zero clue fury warrior in Arathi around 3 months before TBC dropped. I ended up just going rogue. Clueless spec point allocation, bad weapons and bad spec, combined with being too noob to know how make bank without killing it was just pointless. I'm pretty sure I was using some paladin int gear at some point because it was better than the crap I had drop for me.  
---
Then at 40 on my rogue I got 2 gutripper drops and I forgot I ever had a warrior.
---
Eh, it’s not a big deal at that level since the gear will be replaced. But I still would’ve asked if it was ok. Or said “hey guys I normally tank so I’m gonna roll on this”. But I had a tank Druid need my pre raid bis healing weapon from BRD and it pissed me off. “I’m going to respec at 60.” Doesn’t let you roll on bis gear for people filling that role in the dungeon. So yah, in this case it’s NBD. But don’t take shields from people in 52-60 content without asking.
---
great pic. Almost makes them seem like the good guys.
---
Early 50s my friend and I went to arena and two rares were up along with 2 black lotus, several sansom, silverdale and sungrass.
---
who cares
---
It's not like it's a huge deal. I think we won't see a real race until Cthun or even naxx 40.
---
There used to be sites with statistics. Blizzard removed the ability to gather those statistics a few weeks ago.
---
The reason was (to my knowledge) never given, but it’s suspected to be because it was causing already unbalanced servers to become worse, as the weaker aide transferred away, and new players would avoid rolling on that faction
---
Charred Vale (Stonetalon) and Lethlor Ravine (Badlands) are the secret OP mithril locations.
---
no the main post is about a tryhard mechanic, the subject of this chain is about viablity of specs in raids. 
---
main topic being 1 thing does not mean the whole thread needs to be about that 1 thing
---
and i am interested in tryhard mechanics otherwise i would not have clicked this thread but this comment chain is not that.
---
I believe you can heal in DM east, you might struggle with the others.  The nice thing with BRD is that there are so many quests which give a ton of XP.  You probably won't get as much from DM but it would be decent enough.
---
It has a cool down from the "cheat" teleport. But the system teleport out of the dungeon (when you leave your group) will still teleport you even if your hearthstone is currently on cool down.
---
For instance: I once finished Scarlet Monastery, but my hearthstone was still on cool down. I left the group, and after 60 seconds, the system teleported me out. My hearthstone cool down was reset to that moment. That is, if your cool down was down to 10 minutes remaining, after the dungeon "kick", it's back to 30 minutes.
---
Man my tanking alt is only 23 but I *feel this.*
---
I've been playing since Wrath and I've always loved Druids, but have always gone Resto. Maybe Cat occasionally. But I've never really done much tanking, so being a bear sounded so fun. Once I got to RFC level, I figured I would just hybrid and advertise as tanking or healing just to be flexible. 
---
Have ended up as tank every single time. It's been mostly fine, I know how to pull manageable groups of mobs, LOS, mark targets and blahblahblah. But it gets tiring for me even that early on, so I decided I would heal the next dungeon for sure and not even advertise as a tank.
---
And man it was SO much more fun for me than tanking. Like... I *want* to tank, in theory. But it just doesn't feel good, it makes me just want to get the dungeon over with instead of being like, "Wow, that was a nice run" like how I felt when I heal or DPS.
---
You going to be okay? Need someone to process this understandably traumatic experience with? I'll charge you half my normal rate for therapy.
---
You don't have to pass but you should let the group know you're gonna be rolling on tank gear if you're playing as a different role.
---
Please remember in trade to start calling Deadmines DM:W, short for Deadmines in Westfall.  It will really help cut down the confusion.
---
Tank healer combo here...average 150g an hr selling dungeon runs =]
---
When you log off? I've never had an issue with it.
---
That makes sense to me! I’ve had some hides sell for a bit more than vendor, but regular skins seem to be unsuccessful a fair amount. I’ll just vendor them. Thanks!
---
No patch. Live now. Patches were a lie.
---
Even at 60 it's still a decent trinket to use while it's off cooldown. It's best against warriors since the damage absorption hinders their rage generation.
---
Gotcha. Yeah I see it on bis lists for dps but still I think for pugs at least an upgrade is an upgrade and if the healer doesn't have anything close to it I'd expect them to roll. Not everyone scours all the bis lists and they just look for upgrades. I wouldn't be upset enough as a caster dps to lose it to a healer that doesn't have better to kick them from the group.
---
Sad that on legacy PS raiders often focused on flaunting
---
agreed, huge fan of the hemo swords. lets see what drops I get
---
You give the Horde too much credit.  I’ve been playing both sides for at least the past decade.  There are just as many derps on either side.  Hunters that refuse to use ranged weapons because they pay to play how they want.  Druids with boom kin talents trying to claim they are tanks.  There’s plenty of idiocy to go around.
---
Spam BRD or just do quests in eastern plague lands.  55-60 was way easier for me then 45-55, now that was a slog.
---
Think it's possible if you have enough damage, but you're going to have to eat a lot.
---
New races and character models. Plus transmog. Linking professions. Fixed flight paths.
---
Come join us on Whitemane, we got a spot for you in 'Alt Right'
---
60 for tribute Runs.
---
Depends on your class. Classes that have a harder time leveling will have a harder time with content that is of their same level or higher. So if you are a warrior for example i would stick to green questing zones as its faster to breeze through these easier quests then struggle with quests that give higher rewards. On the other end of the spectrum a warlock can do quests of their own level or higher and not feel slowed down at all due to their sustain.
---
The agility enchant recipe is the big draw I think.
---
Tanks need dps gear to generate more threat. It's really not the same.
---
I'm having trouble facing rogues - in the middle of combat after ambushing, within 2 seconds they will re-stealth. Then, they will re-stealth mid-combat again a few seconds later, then I'm dead.
---
How do I prevent this? I'm playing a mage.
---
Oh dude I feel you. I’m on Heartseeker. We’re the reverse of what you described. It’s literally 85% alliance to 15% horde give or take 5%. I’ve done the math thanks to having two accounts. So yeah I get it man. It’s stupid how imbalanced these realms are. 
---
I still am looking forward to PvP without BGs though just because it’s fun to team with three or four guildies and just go around looking for fights. But I know what it can alsobe like so I get why some folks just want BGs asap
---
I like it. In depth and not condescending towards other classes or play styles, but rather how to adapt and handle them. Nice.
---
/u/therealrecollector
---
Hard part of consecrate is I need it for threat.
---
If group is disciplined and can wait til I pull away from sheep it's fine but in my experience everyone charges in right after the sheep pull and I don't want to rez every pull.
---
Wooooooah look at this frikken TALENT
---
Lol yeah solo tanked UBRS like 3 times now. Definitely a fun time
---
Me and my mates all agreed on classes before launch, one of them changed to tank at on launch day without........ we are running 2 warriors in our late game 5 man's.....
---
*IN THE ARMSSSSSSSSSSSS OFFFFFFFFFFFF AN ANGELLLLLLLLLLLLLLL*
---
For just 25 silver a day, you can help these kodo...
---
Same for me on Heartseeker but alliance instead of horde. It sucks.
---
Dual 11mp5 trinkets...mmmm
---
All 3 going hard. One has 3 60s and doing mc with two of them.
---
You can't say it's an unfair advantage when it is more so a source of information. 
---
A very big skill factor in Wow is the UI customization and custom LUA. Great players will have their UI display all useful information without affecting their raid awareness. For example, a lot of casual DPS players are not aware of their health because they have their health bar all the way on the left corner. You can improve this by moving the player frame to close to the center. You can argue this is an advantage, but can you argue it is unfair? There are only people that don't know about it and people who do know about it. The default UI has health on top left corner, buff/debuff on top right corner, and skills span across the bottom. This is extremely unoptimized. 
---
Similarly, I can write WA that improves my resource management and raid mechanics. Without WA, this game becomes a lot harder. Is that unfair? I can also write WA that does the same thing as SPY because they are essentially the same; they both read combat log, which function and support is provided by blizzard.
---
I don’t believe there is a cap.
---
Every 5 skill points acts like an extra level. So with 314, you’re acting *almost* like you’re level 63. The game will calculate your hit/miss and such based on that.
---
1c per hp healed, charged before the final boss. The last boss heals are complimentary.
---
I've done some lasher farming, it's the nerfed version with a herb every 4th or 5th kill. Added bonus is the mobs agro when you're on the ledge when jumping down.
---
So yeah no lasher farming
---
Fucking hell
---
Zoomer👉Retail
---
Slow and lots of damage
---
Great job. Typical cry about something and make it more well known post
---
spotted the capitalist drone
---
Classic is a game with an end. It's a beaten game. For some players it's not a question of if they can do the content, because anyone can do the content. It's old content. To these people the game is about beating it more and more efficiently.
---
Thats classic. Beyond that it's just leveling and that too has an end game. Theres a reason why retails evolved.
---
Not if your DPS are slamming the gas pedal on pull. It gives you time to focus on the other mobs before that one becomes an issue.
---
I've only seen people ask for tip for non-group members. Never seen it in a party.
---
Stun DR exists on NPCs. Warrior charge makes Concussive Blow only a 2 second stun instead of 5 :(
---
I have my totem bar top of screen, my auras in default aura spot, target auras, but no ToT auras. 
---
I'm targetting myself, and since I am a shaman it shows what totems I have up in the target auras. I will admit I didn't plan ahead for this screen shot and it's a bit shit looking at it now.
---
Since as a shaman I have never had to fight another shaman, I never disabled enemy totems because I didn't know they'd show up lol. 
---
As I said it my original comment there are no redundancies, it just seems like it because I am targetting myself. I should have taken a better picture.
---
The bars at the bottom are just my health and mana. I like big bars so I can tell how much HP I have without having to actually look at it. Just a preference.
---
I am not sure how that is happening, I thought rogues only had vanish on a 5min cooldown.
---
Arcane explosion will hit them if they're within the radius to knock them out of stealth. Frost Nova as well. You should also keep your human racial handy (if you're a human) because it gives you a heightened sense to stealth.
---
That's my main, I've just been switching between the two as I find a better ranged weapon through drops or questing. Still mainly had guns so far but as you say, bows are the endgame
---
I checked AH yesterday. Blindweed was about 1.5g per stack on my server while all other herbs I was able to find on my level are 30s max per stack. I mentioned Blindweed in my question cause for now I feel it's the only herb that might be worth the effort to collect it
---
Ambush explodes gnomes
---
Ghost Mushroom is also less common, but no on the same level as Black Lotus
---
A small number of them were in comparison to the number of people that can do it now. 'Trade secrets' were kept hush or not widespread.
---
Looking for devilsaurs most likely
---
That will work only after getting +heal gear, so past level 50.  
---
Before that, using low level heal you are just wasting 5 second rule.
---
Way too soon Blizzard ,way to soon...what levels are different wings of DM?
---
Someone in my guild just said they nerfed lasher farm but I hope that's just a sick fucking joke
---
Just the whole thing was rough, armorsmithing was a ball ache all round. Lucky my guild funneled all our MC mats into me so I became revered. But was basically broke for a week and burned out from constant farming.
---
MC never worked in vanilla, the way some private servers did. When MC breaks the mob will agro you.
---
Faerlina I'm guessing? Imagine being so pathetic you judge servers based on how many streamers you play with
---
i was planning on starting with 3 friends. 2 of them never logged in once the other one logged in once
---
Pardon my ignorance, but as a guy who didn't farm them back in vanilla, could somebody please explain what expected behavior vs. demonstrated behavior is here? What did we want vs what did we get?
---
The vast majority of the population was. There's a huge difference between "some people knew about DM farming" and "everyone knows about DM farming".
---
I ment enemy-faction combat actions. It only breaks the portion of dmg meters on "dmg taken". It also breaks most PvP centric addons. PvE is free and clear.
---
They can't stay vanished if they have DoTs, do you have anything that leaves damage over time on the target?
---
Because thats how i was told it worked when i asked
---
Priests have 4 BIS in there, over 25% upgrades
---
This sub (including this post) reach the first few pages of /r/all on a regular basis.
---
The casuals will have no idea about this stuff. You are overreacting.
---
Speaking as a Paladin, end game healing is pretty boring. 90% of the time it is just spamming Flash of Light on whoever is currently taking damage. Some fights require you to cast cleanse a few times and occasionally someone will fuck up and you need to cast Blessing of Protection on them. It requires so little effort that I'm usually watching Netflix on my second monitor while I raid.
---
Sweet thanks. I'm almost done all the BRD quests and was hoping DM had some.
---
They were in wotlk. I cleared them all with almost 0 difficulty while still wearing some lvl 70 gear.
---
Brutality blade and core hound tooth are BiS for hunter from molten core, peacemaker isn’t as good because you can only put 1 enchant on it and it’s lower base stats all together... peacemaker = 1% crit 56 AP (+ no useful 2h enchants)
---
Dual wielding brut blade and cht= 2% crit + 38AP (+60 AP w/ agi enchants once they are released)
---
Peacemaker has higher overall AP but is outclassed by crit chance
---
Got a link breh?
---
The talent "improved curse of agony" with 3 points give you 6% more damage with this curse, but this 6% is calculated before or after the set bonuses of int/dark damage/etc.
---
No, MC does not work as it did on private servers. If you MC. Mob and use it to aggro others, when the MC mob dies they all aggro onto you. This is not how it worked on private servers.
---
As it stands the best you can hope for is to hope the smaller aggro radio allow us to mind soothe past the mobs that required MC on private servers.
---
What about the other layer?
---
Theres a dope tanking mace that drops
---
Running away from stitches in pure terror is part of the experience
---
Funny, but I’m so happy I’m not on their server. No way you can compete with these guys.
---
is there a way i could get the PSD file?
---
You talking about HoJ?
---
Mok'nathal were the result of selective breeding conducted by ogres on enslaved orcs in an attempt to create creatures combining the brute strength of an ogre with the intelligence of orcs.
---
So, in short, ogres were deliberately raping their orc slaves to create these hybrids. Meditate on that.
---
@madscientist is princess immune to nature now too? That was gonna be my fall back grind as druid at 60. Rip.
---
Or just don't use addons that auto accept the BOP screen
---
Who the fuck is apes and why should I care?
---
I'm loving daggers, I went for ambush/backstab and am having a blast. I get ubrs invites because I'm not rolling in the mh. It's just a lot of fun all around.
---
Amen, I remember running SFK and everyone was reserving shit. “This is my 8th run I’m reserving robes of arugula if it drops”. Dude just level up and you’ll replace it...
---
Your racial +5 to guns compensate for this.
---
Doesn’t work either way
---
Yeah that's fine if you start the pull with 0 rage. If you pool at the end of the previous pack, you have to spend to 25 or you lose a lot.
---
yes but as long as you are raiding in a reasonable timeframe then who really gives a shit. 
---
it's a once a week thing, as long as you aren't wiping and clearing it in a few hours then no one is going to care unless you are in a big tryhard guild 
---
maybe read the comment chain again if you think my argument is not relevant to the start of this discussion. I want to make this point because i think the whole "arms is useless because mortal strike wastes a debuff slot" is bullcrap unless you are in the top 5% of raids where this shit actually matters
---
Sometimes a couple seconds is all you need and you can spend rage building threat elsewhere. Sometimes on a big pull I will mark skull and just taunt it and concussion it, and build threat on the rest. Skull dies before it can run off. Depends on group.
---
No they weren’t. Shit was common knowledge. You act like we didn’t have places to discuss theorycrafting and soloing (we did). By the time MC was on farm and people were getting geared, you started seeing all sorts of steam rolling through dungeons and and farming techniques.
---
Not to speak for OP but he said he was a resto shaman. I am also and have noticed that our chain heals will bounce to the hunter pet if its injured. I have not ever directly focused a hunters pet though myself.
---
What would be better, mage or hunter for gold farming?
---
What Gold farming methods have been nerfed in classic compared to pservers?
---
So you're talking AOE. But when it does become an issue, taunt is down.
---
They're already tapped. And even if they weren't, the warlock would die instantly.
---
Nice! Thanks mate
---
Well that's WHY they try hard. They're making the challenge. It's not a question of IF people can do the content, it's about how fast and efficient they can do it.
---
You farm devilsaurs within a raid? Ok.
---
Dire Maul West?
---
Which mods are you using to make this happen?
---
You can literally just open a combat log and put it into a new window and do essentially the same thing.
---
how are you feeling now friend 
---
regards,
---
a paladin :(
---
they have moved the spawn location of some of the lash packs. Also seems to have added an elite for each pack aswell. Back in the day you followed a path to get 4 packs of lashes and aoe them down. That seems to not be possible anymore
---
I'm not sure that agility conversion is correct.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/rogue-dps-stat-priority-classic-wow
---
&gt;29 Agility = 29 Attack Power, 1% Crit Chance, 2% Dodge
---
I work in customer service, these idiots exist and are plentiful.
---
Both guys I was playing with randomly had their mid life mmo crisis and quit instantly out of nowhere. 
---
In the weeks leading up to launch I let them both know a million times there is not a lot of content so there is no reason to nerd out and try hard. That advice wasn't taken. They both nerded out and forgot there wasn't any content.
---
Oh well.
---
That's the joke
---
Nope, I'm in DM:E rn. 3 packs in and not a single piece of grey loot. Hilarious that they'd nerf lasher farming but not mara or any of the other gold farms.
---
Yep, insect swarm doesn’t work on her, so it takes a good bit longer to kill her.  Still possible but more difficult.
---
BT and Sunwell gear with sockets stayed relevant for a while though. Plenty of rogues that used T6 for early Naxx progression, for example.
---
What are the recommended levels for each Dire Maul wing? I’m a level 56 mage so not sure if I can run it.
---
It was already nerfed in vanilla. Private servers are wrong as they have been about a ton of gold farm spots.
---
Or if you're specifically looking for the final boss of Deadmines then ask for DM:E, signifying you want to run Deadmines:Edwin Vancleef
---
Spam run SM and pickpocket all the mobs as you go. Auction all the greens that you get.
---
I'm not too good with AH trading, but almost everything I could find is selling on AH about at the same price it can be vendored. The only things I got profit from selling on AH were bolts of silk and mageweave that droped from boxes I got from fishing
---
Woosh
---
From a healers perspective, once you are tanking BRD you should be prot spec (starting @ 53). Why? Damage mitigation and mana/healing efficiency. Yes, we could possibly keep most warrior's none prot spec alive as a tank but we would be drinking in between every single pull. Also, spike damage of fire elementals when there is more then one could easily wipe the group.
---
Totally enough time for everyone to know everything about how it plays in classic.
---
Seeing that color, I thought it was a Pally complaining and thought, "This dude's a masochist, saying he does damage to himself... wth is he talking about?"  Then I checked your flair and the comments.
---
Now it makes sense.
---
Let him engulf himself in his own flames of anger.
---
You should do it unless it's difficult (then just level up a bit then do it).  It's good for pvp (gives paranoia for stealthed units and has counterspell). Succubus is better for dps.
---
I have a couple thoughts about this:
---
 * Rolling on a PvP server and then whining about getting killed is about as idiotic as those people who buy a house near an airport and then whine about the noise. You put yourself in this position, so deal with it.
---
 * Saying all Horde players are trash because you got ganked a couple times is making an overly-broad generalization. It's bullshit, in other words.
---
Horde on Kurinaxx server are mighty and strong I go to red ridge at 60 and kill all players there it's so much fun.
---
&gt; but female hostages are usually raped
---
Got a source for this?  Cause this feels made up.
---
All it does is parse the combat log. Never going to be banned. I personally use it for the ability to have a KoS list. It's great
---
As in they're easier to farm and the loot is shittier?
---
How do you get it?
---
Then grind zf
---
No kink shaming man. Some people like to play mmo's and other people like to choke themselves while jerking it to 2 guys in furry outfits going ham on each other while listening to adele...crying...you know...basic stuff.
---
This is a change though, not #nochanges.
---
I just figured out why it says several pages are blank haha
---
You'll need sweeping strikes and whirlwind for aoe, which you get at level 30 (with the right talents) and 34 respectively.  Once you've got those, 'rotation' is charge, sweeping strikes, berserker stance, whirlwind. Then it's just autos, overpowers, cleave, then whirlwind again (and sweeping strikes when it's back up). You'll likely never use cleave due to needing rage for whirlwind. Pool rage towards the end of a pack to kickstart the next pack, but watch your aggro if you can't take a hit or 7.
---
Shaman’s fill the resto role better
---
Yep trash, elites have larger agro ranges, and some mobs were moved to make moving around harder
---
The OP Picture comes from Cartographer to make the unexplored zones invisible, Questie and TomTom, and then Enhanced Battlefield Minimap to apply questie's map markers to the Battlefield Map (shift-M). 
---
in the 2nd picture, there is no questie or tomtom
---
A lot of faction controlled zones harbor instances.  Barrens has 3 alone.  Would be hell.
---
All my friends wanted to go to Whitemane.  Queues were insane for a while.  It kind of burned me out because I would either wait in a long queue with my friends or I would have to figure out a way to stay logged in all day.  When 4 of the 5 of us made it online it sucked either waiting for the 5th or do content w/o them.
---
My days started to revolve around planning to beat the queues.  It was shit.
---
I'd be outside cutting my yard, opening remote desktop on my phone so I can jump and do a few /say to try to stay logged in.
---
Remote desktop from work at noon so I could play at 3pm.    
---
Cooking dinner for the family, walk to my office every 5 mins or so to make sure I wasn't sitting at the login screen / keep myself logged in. etc
---
Harder to kill and shittier loot.
---
Not to sound bitchy but this is something to be aware of before rolling on a pvp server. If you're on pve, there is nothing to fear :)
---
Yeah, you should never have threat issues on 1-2 mob packs, regardless of what your DPS do.
---
It's not hard to do a run and see what they drop, they're literally the first mobs you kill on the run.
---
Yes they're nerfed.
---
That's a 10min cool down. So not very viable for every pull and usually just a oh shit button
---
Nerfed compared to actual vanilla or just private servers? Because if it's only in relation to private servers then it's not really a nerf.
---
Selling yourself as a tank to UBRS and Strat groups.
---
Stalagg is a shit show if your an alliance above lvl 30 without a lvl 60 character. 
---
Last night we got ganked in STV, Dustwallow Marsh, and even Ratchet (the horde killed the guards and lowbie hordes were picking fights. 
---
A walk through Booty Bay shows horde outnumbering the alliance 2:1. 
---
So a friend and I decided we’re transferring today because we don’t have 60’s yet to do anything about the griefing.
---
we just have a few of our dps warriors keep a decent shield and toss it on when needed. we only 'offically' have 2-3 tanks in our raid roster
---
Ironfoe prob up there
---
Usually it runs smoother when you let the tank build some aggro before you go in, swords blazing. So lockpick away imo. I fondly refer to rogues and fury warriors as "aggro monkeys"
---
Blizz didn't nerf anything. Private servers are wrong and have been about so many farm spots. But yes, lasher gold farm is worse.
---
what kind of idiot brain do you have to think that using 1 debuff slot is equal to doing negative dps
---
I mean, it's the occasional "yeah, take that horde!" compared to the constant "wow horde is camping all the DM instances again, great" and "why are there only two guilds actually raiding" or "Does anyone have the lionheart helm/nightfall/(insert rare pattern here) pattern? Oh no only the other faction" and "looks like horde got the world bosses again" or "wow another horde city invasion".
---
The downsides far outweigh the feelsgoods of the occasional underdog PvP victory. It's all of the disadvantages of a low pop server, plus the competition of a high pop server, with a ton of corpsecamping and 3v1 ganks sprinkled in.
---
Warlock main in vanilla. Felhunter is definitely more of an anti-caster pet. He has an ability, spell lock, that will interrupt a cast and lock that school of magic for a few seconds. He has a couple other utility abilities as well, increased stealth detection, and an ability that reduces the attack power of enemies that melee him. Both the succubus and the felhunter have their own set of skills that it's hard to say if one is better than the other. Felhunter is strong against casters that can't be or aren't going to be seduced.
---
They should've made BG queues *not* cross-realm, so people who play underdog factions have instant BG queues, while people who join an already dominant faction have to wait longer queues.
---
It wouldn't have solved every balance problem, but it would at least give an incentive to people to try to achieve a better server balance.
---
I doubt there's anything Blizzard can do to solve the problem now, especially after banning the Census mod and/or unless they'd post the detailed server population information.
---
Where it's really useful is on Rogues imo.
---
Pop your bubble before vanish and now those lock/priest/warrior/Hunter dots don't immediately break your stealth.
---
What's the actual Diablo-style interface mod tho?
---
Staff of Jordan
---
Any mob ranging from 35-40 can drop it i think, but it has 0.2% chance.
---
I think that was just bulllshit they made up on the spot to justify having a human actor who barely looks like an orc in the warcraft movie.
---
Good luck with trying to put a guild together.  I've been running PUG Onyxias for a few weeks trying to tempt people into joining, but if you don't already have 20+ people, no one wants to join.  At this point, if I can't poach from other guilds, I'm left with mouth breathers that I don't want to raid with.  Part of that might just be my server.  Thinking a transfer would be good but for now I'm just leveling my mage for aoe farming DM.
---
From the perspective of a 60 priest heals, I've gotten the pleasure of meeting and friending a decent amount of great tanks. I quickly learned that a healthy tank is a happy tank. If you do your job as a healer, play well, and contribute positively to the run (be prepared with water/consumables, give advice, know the dungeon and the quests, read a dungeon/raid walk through online), tanks want to be healed by you. Not saying I’m the best healer, but I try my damn hardest and that reflects in the success of runs. The relationship between healer and tank is absolutely crucial, there needs be a high level of trust. Tanks should know the capabilities of their healer, like how big a pull can get and how much mana they need to sustain a fight. This helps them figure out what pace to progress through a dungeon, which is wildly important. 
---
In short, a good tank needs a good, reliable healer. If youre struggling to find a tank, reverse engineer the problem. First, find a healer who a tank would want to have heal them. The healer is a tanks best friend, and will greatly increase their chances of wanting to run your dungeon. 
---
Jcdubs-Rattlegore
---
I guess this leaves me praying that solo tribute runs are doable still for druids.
---
Yeah each race has their strengths in PvE, but some are better than others.
---
Fury/prot not really viable in early phases. Not enough crit items for threat god.
---
The amount of hunters that wait until the mob runs all the way to them and is about to hit them before Using FD is far too high.
---
I've been trying it for a bit now.  It seems that they added additional elites along the path used to bring the lasher's.  Also, I've been getting little to no loot.
---
The perception that skillful mechanics like this are harmful and should be patched out is why an awful lot of modern games are bland crap.
---
Weak Aura, its an add on that lets you customize an indicator (or just about anything else) that will show on specific conditions, like shazz having his dampen magic buff up.
---
I think crit deserves some emphasis until you get about 30% and can be consistently flurried.  I am an undergeared warrior but doing MC with ony buff/druid crit the other night and getting up to 30-33 crit was just a stupid boost for my rage generation/dps.
---
This is purely just on my feel.  I have no numbers to back this up.
---
Last night I did the single gnomer run I do on every toon and it’s worth one run. 5 shareable quests you can complete on a single trip.  It’s good XP with the quests and  an amazing reward for leather wearers (triprunner dungarees or whatever)
---
If they're complaining then they don't understand the vanilla game.  You should be healing in those dungeons though.  Not trying to DPS.
---
Embriel posting stupid shit again. Shadow weaving healer is optimal, not gimped.
---
I've kept it under lock&amp;key since launch, but we never saw a single Orb of Deception despite farming it constantly.  Doing double spawns with a small group was probably some of the most fun in the game, though, and was a great break from mindless dungeon farming.
---
Awesome dude. Thanks. This is great news. I guess I will focus on cranking out my last two levels now.
---
Ah I see.  Did you play private servers?
---
Cool so probably only worth 1-2g I guess
---
They clearly don't understand. It should only be an issue if its damage and healing gear, but even then the preBiS stuff will overlap. Buncha salty mages and Locks.
---
Oh wow, thanks for the tip. I had no idea. I'll definitely make room for that.
---
They didnt fix it as soon as it was discovered. It was used through to wotlk, just not that common. It was removed with the cata overhaul. It's a bug that's part of vanilla one of many.
---
Alliance exist send help
---
and increased aggro range on the big ones, rip farming
---
I don't have a horse in this race, but it is worth noting that crit is much more valuable due to its scarcity on Hunters. Hunters get 1% crit for every 53 points of agility. Rogues get 1% for 29, meaning it takes almost half as much agi for them to get the same amount of crit. Warriors are even lower, at 1% per 20. That makes this 2% crit, which Hunters could only achieve with the equivalent of 106 agility, pretty valuable.
---
Where you by any chance a gnome warrior on gehennas?
---
if you take that line of thinking a little further you can start saying why are you coming if you aren't doing x dps 
---
why are you coming if you aren't drinking x and y consumes every raid 
---
why are you coming if you can't do x or y
---
all of a sudden you realize  :O im in a tryhard guild
---
Pummel would be instant cast
---
I wouldn't extend it to all games but MMOs are just a kind of a cop out. They're designed to always give you something to do and work towards that takes a bunch of time but doesn't require any real effort so they enable people to just perpetually kill all of their free time. Compare that to something like starcraft which is hard to learn and incredibly hard to master and requiring massive effort. Nobody is calling people pathetic for nolifing chess while that's essentially the same thing.
---
Only 2 more hours and I can finally go home.
---
Can't drop anymore, it's been removed.
---
u/Nadox97 says they are on the pally mount quest now.
---
diabolic UI, also no compatible with classic.
---
Y'all need to stop making relationships with these pathologically clingy/dependent humans
---
&gt; You act like we didn’t have places to discuss theorycrafting and soloing (we did).
---
High end players sure.
---
Casuals (like me!) - not so much. Back in Vanilla I don't remember being nearly as focused on BiS lists, dungeon/leveling guides or farming techniques as I am in Classic. Just used to do a bit of Thottbotting to figure out where quest mobs were. 
---
Things will be much different today thanks to places like this subreddit, Twitch and especially YouTube tutorials.
---
Yeah, this is why I strongly dislike pvp servers. Too bad all of my friends wanted pvp.
---
Cry that the lasher farm won’t work for me.
---
Sounds like the gave it the retail dungeon/raid trash nerf.
---
I'll never forget when overnight in retail they reduced gold and trash drops from all old content by about 95%
---
Always wondered, can the opposite faction see those swirlies?
---
Thats for Rogues, as a fury you only aimed for 6% anyway, with this HS Mechanic hit gets even less value than id had before (20AP = 1% hit after 6)
---
No one is doing 1k dps in classic. Try again.
---
Do those two tank characters have mana bars?   Because warriors seriously struggle with soloing elites.   Even for non-elite quests, the usual advice is to focus on the green ones because yellow-level quests means a LOT of down time bandaging/eating between pulls.
---
*reads down further* 
---
Yeah, you’re talking about healing yourself.   Different for warriors.
---
If youre literally doing negative dps, theres a problem. Dont use MS in raids if you want to contribute positively to your raid.
---
If you literally dont care at all about your performance, you are the epitome of casual and your guild wont make it through AQ.
---
Live in EU.
---
Now that DM is out - DM East farm runs with a healer are good gold per hour, especially if one of you is a herbalist and the other a miner.
---
There aren't since Cata, no.
---
pet attack keybind I think
---
It's real and was in feralas, not ungoro.  
---
It was the the day DM got released. Alliance camped DM entrance and ganked all Horde in feralas.  
---
when the Horde made a counter-raid, they did the ambush.
---
I guess the purpose is to also post things as you find them. I dont expect a fount of knowledge to be uploaded in a matter of seconds after I post it.
---
Is there any point raiding MC as a fury warrior? After two raids of not having anything drop that I can roll on, and looking at loot tables, it seems like a waste of time. All the drops I can use are low drop rate
---
I've been gathering Green items, don't think it's smart to vendor them, but I can't seem to get rid of them on the AH either. What do you do with your greens?
---
- they earn you money
---
- they'll last you several months
---
- one of the few liquid assets; you can sell them for full price after youre done.
---
People seem to take the "bad" part personally. But really me and anyone else seeing a warlock using this, will take advantage of it. Using it puts you on the backfoot in pvp. Id be shitting my pants if I had to mount up with this near others.
---
Or I mean, feel free to buy a SECOND epic mount when BG's come out, your choice.
---
Takes 30 seconds to figure out if these have been nerfed
---
I use 14/13/rest in ret. Can heal fine with healing light talent and can take fine with imp right. Nice hybrid spec
---
☺️
---
But you’re rich in friendship
---
The enhancement shaman is most likely using max rank earthshock as his opener and on cooldown. It even says in the spell description that it generates high threat.
---
This is me with the stone shards in badlands
---
We were around 9 people playing the game, 5 of them being around the same level up until lvl 35 where most of them dropped out, some say they still play now and then but they are the same lvl. 
---
I am currently lvl 51 lonely and bored because I get bored leveling by myself. The closest one got to 43 but is working in Mexico for a couple weeks, hoping he gets back next week and can catch up with me at least.
---
If a boss is dead then not all bosses are alive are they? Lul.
---
My guild sacrifices them the night before a raid for good fortune.
---
Why has it been removed? Would love to read storys like this :(
---
it's litually two weeks earlier then originally released
---
Yup, once you get SS your soloing becomes actually reasonable. It's so much easier to fight two enemies than one because of rage gen, which is really shitty for arms warriors.
---
*fresh off an MC wipe, everyone revives*
---
Me the only Druid in raid: Gift wild group 1, Gift wild group 2 wait what i totally had group 2 party member hovered over why did it give it to group 7 whatever. Gift wild group 2 again. Gift wild group 3. Drink.
---
Mage: Can we get gift on group 4?
---
Me: Gift on group 4 WHAT THE FUCK IT DIDN'T... WHAT GROUP GOT IT... alright whatever. drinking again.
---
Me: Gift on group 4. Gift on, ready check.... not ready.
---
Rogue: Can we get gift on Group 8?
---
Me: drinking, then regifting the other 4 groups.
---
Warrior: Can we get gift on Group 1?
---
Me: What the fuck Group 1 didn't get Gift I Swear I...
---
What?  I thought you killed the last boss for the nodes at the end?  WTF good is mining then?
---
Am 48 Prot Warrior with Enchanting.  I'm using that shield now.  I've DE'd it about 5 times already just from winning Greed rolls on it.
---
qq
---
Yeah; they've already announced that they are doing battle groups not server isolated BGs, so it won't even be a *huge* deal outside of P2. It sucks to be on the disadvantaged side, but that's nothing new.
---
yes let me use my mana to heal my warrior. I also feel bad for you never having a well fed buff i guess.
---
Thank you, i was incorrect and i dont mind being wrong. I just wish people would stop to with the singular “no”. Its like pissing on something. Its not productive for anyone.
---
Damn it, I want to play but I don't want to support Blizzard..
---
Yeah, good tips indeed. I guess I should look better at what I want to sell. I've moreso been losing money in this whole proces, even though I'm always undercutting others by quite a bit.
---
No it's not. It was a bug in vanilla, it's just no one knew about it or if they did they didn't share it with everyone.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't just pick whatever server you want to go to. So for anyone to give you advice, they would need to know what sever you are on or what servers you're eligible to transfer to.
---
They were nerfed in vanilla. You can even read comments on community sites about it.
---
You can tank the dungeons in fury just fine.
---
Just because private servers were wrong doesn't mean they nerfed anything.
---
Are you on the spectrum or do you choose to not understand obvious humor/sarcasm when you see it just to feel more “enlightened” or whatever?
---
3 still play regularly, including my duo leveling friend. We lost 1 at like level 14 sadly, but we managed to get 2 others to play about a week ago so it’s all good
---
If you don't add /startattack to this macro, it should charge if not in combat and wait for a button press before going into Berserker Stance. If in combat and zerk, it will use Whirlwind and then Cleave resetting after no press for 2 seconds. Extra spaces have been removed to give more characters for the macro.
---
/castsequence reset=2 \[stance:1, nocombat\]Charge; \[stance:1, combat\]Berserker Stance; \[stance:3, combat\]Whirlwind, Cleave; \[stance:3, nocombat\]Battle Stance;
---
I use it only to keep track of KoS players. If you gank me or are a shithead, I'm camping you when Spy sees you in the future. Other than that, I really don't use it.
---
Good.
---
let's test weapons that don't exist
---
At first i was like “absolutely not! I will not install Questie!”
---
Then after a while I realized how silly I was being with wowhead open on one screen. If I was googling everything anyway might as well have it in game.
---
All nature, hurricane and thorns do nothing
---
Doesnt prep reset all those cds
---
True
---
I've been tanking 10-52 with my healer friend in every dungeon. I was tanking as arms 10-40. But, for many of the reasons posted in this threat, it was incredibly unfun. Getting and maintaining aggro felt impossible at times. 
---
I switched prot, and since then tanking and threat has been an absolute breeze. Night and day easier. I find that this is mostly because shield slam does an insane amount of threat.
---
Maybe I should try a fury/prot hybrid though.
---
this, people are in denial
---
You nees improved sap to do that and no rogues will be specced into it while leveling.
---
This is a good point.
---
wow
---
point out that you're wrong and you immediately resort to character attacks 
---
this was totally unexpected and i never saw it coming!
---
Warriors not tanking at 60 is the reason I rolled a warrior.  After a guild collapse, I practically pugged my tank gear across instances.
---
I enjoy being deep prot specced, and some of the fun that comes with it.  I enjoyed some of the fun proc weapons (silent fang) as well as some of the utility it brought to a group.  Concussive Blow, a shield that silences, a stun proc on revenge...  all hilarious stuff.  I know, it's not optimal, blah blah...  it's FUN, and that's what counts.
---
I've still deep into Fury at my level, and I'm still enjoying tanking.  Good group, bad group, hell, even getting run through an instance by a 60...  Blowing cooldowns because a runner pulled about 4 more mobs in the room, the mage is AOE'ing, and you're spamming piercing howl to help kite because fuck trying to get aggro back at this stage...  and you pull out the win...  Who doesn't like that?  
---
Tanking in a by the numbers situation is great the first two runs through an instance.  After that, you have to push.  Can I also pull this guy...  Can I disarm the myrmidon when they're pissed?  What happens in Scholomance if I pull one of the mobs from the back corner of that room without clearing first?  Let's find out!
---
I never understood why people don't want to tank an instance.  Never met a mage drop group when someone askes for water.  Never saw a warlock /gquit when told to soulstone a priest.
---
Which is the point I was making, it was aimed at people complaining that it's somehow wrong.
---
Hate to break it to ya but still waiting for reports of hunters being affected.
---
Then go back to the library to turn it in.
---
Here are drop rates from Vanilla: https://web.archive.org/web/20060720204438/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/mob.html?wmob=13022
---
Allahkazam has the most accurate Vanilla drop rates out of all the sites. It seems to be the drop rates for trade goods on there are about half compared to Nostcore.
---
Thanks for your time!
---
Let me introduce you to the &lt;Grizzly&gt; Devilsaur mafia on Stalagg.
---
Yeah but that 1/5 tanks in raids can turn into 6-7/40 dps warriors since you dont need to be prot to tank any 5mans
---
With the right people, shooting shit over discord while drinking way too much, it was probably hilarious.
---
Sure, but not every server is Horde-dominated.
---
You have absolutely no idea if that’s true or not. Nobody does.
---
After leveling my rogue to about 22 on Stalagg, I switched to a PVE server to play with my normal guildies (who I've been playing with since Vanilla/BC). All of 2 people ever on at a time. Fuck this. Going back to playing on a PVP server like I wanted to from the beginning.
---
Getting a group for ST was borderline impossible for me, nobody is really interested in it. The level 50 class quests don't exist yet so most people have no interest.
---
#nochanges
---
why would they nerf it? I thought this was possible in vanilla so it should be possible now, no exceptions.
---
That's private server gameplay.  This stuff isnt worth farming in vanilla.
---
What's even more idiotic in statements like "DM will ruin the economy" is that vanilla private servers had the dungeon implemented baseline for years until Nostalrius changed the blizzlike "meta". Before that people were just happy to play their favourite versions of the game and plenty of the raids (and general content) released on those were also done with 1.12 values. Stupid fearmongering.
---
I tried fury/prot (0/31/20) on our first MC raid and didn't care for it. Shield slam's baked in threat seemed to be far better than the increased auto attacks, HS, more sunders, and bloodthirst threat. This may of course change now that I have 5 raid pieces, but even then I was fully "threat" geared for pre raid. The snap aggro of a shield slam, especially if it crits, is just so huge. I have no doubt fury/prot scales up to be better threat with enough gear, but I'd caution new tanks that it doesn't work that well at first.
---
What i did in vanilla was the tree killing with the path stuff as hunter. But it didnt even was worthy enough
---
What has apparently been needed from Vanilla?
---
In 2005, someone got shot at my dad's restaurant. He ended up working every day for nearly half a year to keep that place open and keep food on the table at home. When he finally got a day off I decided to spend it just sitting on the couch with him and watching some baseball. Because that's my goddamn dad and he's a champion. Guild leader of several years (played other games previously) gave me so much shit for doing that instead of trying to "practice" MC with 23 people that were still wearing greens. I haven't spoken to them since, and I don't miss them one bit.
---
Forget these people. Real life happens, people shouldn't let some internet assholes have that kind of power over them. I'm glad you're continuing the search instead of trying to get back in with them.
---
Well the bitching is about to get a lot worse. 
---
A lot of the things that made Diremaul so sought after (And Blizzard knows why it was sought after) have been removed. No long being able to be solo'd to the same extent.
---
Yes blizzard is against censuses because it makes the balance worse, especially early. Later on, people have settled in and are much less likely to re-roll. Once people hear they're on a 65/35 split server, a bunch of people jump ship and before you know it it's a 80/20 server.
---
I was running through Ashenvale the other day (30 pally) and a ?? UD mage sheeped me.  I was sheeped for so long in the middle of the road.  Hordies would come by and /lol /wave etc.  It was really funny.  Ty for not killing me zombie mage &lt;3
---
What do you call a real race? It's gonna be a sprint but there won't be any real diff between bwl, aq and nax. All 3 are getting clear in less than 2 hrs after release. The real battle will be getting to the instance with your world buffs.
---
wowclassicbis.com --&gt; Pre-Raid Phase 2
---
Private servers were different than vanilla.
---
Paladin, priest, 3x mage has been my favorite.
---
South Park has the PC Babies, Classic WoW has the PS Babies.
---
Tons of 60s already have their epic mounts, why do you need DM farming to get yours, exactly?
---
Dw arms 😈😈 lol
---
You dont need to be tank spec to tank UBRS or anything really for that matter.
---
I was in the process of leveling a mage just to farm this lol. That's ok, though, it means the farming capability of classes is a bit more even leveled. Of course there will always be some better than others at farming, but DM farming was legitimately OP
---
Try this:
---
/cast [nocombat:stance 1] Charge; Berserker Stance
---
This should make it so it always tries to charge as long as you are not in combat and you are in stance 1 (battle stance). Any other time you press it you will go into Berserker stance. This should make it so you charge to start a fight and then can press again to go into Berserker if you want to.
---
Let me know if it works. Can't test it right now but I've been working with my warrior a lot to do macros
---
Seriously? Private servers allowed you to damage lashers with hurricane and thorns. Can somebody confirm with a screenshot that the lashers are 100% immune to nature damage? I thought it was only the elite elementals in DM (which were immune on pservers).
---
Considering that even MC is a walk in the park, and even some MT's are Dual Weld tanking, is it fair assume that 5 man's are even easier?
---
And with that said, how viable for a DPS spec warrior to equip a shield and tank a 5 man?
---
They nerfed it completely for multiple farming. Lasher farming wasn't even the issue, I can make somewhere close to the same amount doing BRD or ZF farming. They legit changed it for multiple classes to farm.
---
Couldn't private servers loot tables just be wrong?
---
i make like 5g profit per transmute which is a 2 day cooldown
---
i make 5g harvesting 5 ghost mushrooms
---
ditch alch
---
Because you have money too. Basically, it's all about farming lashers with a mage. And then selling the drops.
---
wut
---
[Here you go bud.](https://youtu.be/kcQrnCRb4T4?t=174)
---
join BRD 53 onwards(earlier if someone will carry you) for gear.
---
Join the other instances at 57+ for more gear
---
[I think this is what he's referring to](https://youtu.be/kcQrnCRb4T4?t=187)
---
There are no fair fights. There are no rules. It's WPvP.
---
The ONLY time it's an issue is when someone is safe spotting in a neutral town to avoid guard aggro, which is punishable by GM.
---
Killing someone as they eat/drink? WPvP
---
Killing someone as they pull mobs? WPvP
---
Killing someone 4 levels lower? WPvP
---
Killing someone in a group of 2, 3, or more? WPvP
---
WPvP is killing players in the world. A "good" rogue can beat you in a duel, but that doesn't mean they're forced to follow those "rules" in WPvP. Dueling rules are much different. Are you saying you wouldn't drink a potion if you're ganked?
---
Okay so.... We can clearly see that this hunter is not in a guild. So s/he picked this up likely as a pug MC run. This weapon was also likely better than whatever s/he was using before. So since this is a pug run and giving the sword to a rogue/warrior will not benefit the group past said run, how are you supposed to tell the hunter s/he cannot roll if it's still a weapon upgrade?
---
It was literally nerfed in 2006? Pservers used old data. Stop basing things off PServers, we've known they were wrong for like ages now.
---
These are great!
---
Proof Azeroth isnt flat
---
I think some websites have phase 2 pre-bis lists, they seem to ignore any PVP gear coming out and the only pve pre-raid gear coming out p2 is dire maul so they should be accurate.
---
I'm laying down now, post work nap. I'd have to make a gif as it doesn't actually say immune it just doesn't show anything. Could be my ui but definitely doesn't do damage.
---
Nope! Is open now.
---
I love all that. I've played it all before, so it's mostly familiar. I can find my way through most dungeons purely on muscle memory at this point. So, if someone wants to pull aggro and spice things up? Eh, their repair bill. I'll be fine. And the tank shortage means I have never had to wait more than five minutes to slap a group together ever. It's great. Now granted, I have a pocket healer, so the worst that happens is a dpser goes crazy, but...that happens. Sooner or later you build a group of folks you like. In guild or not.
---
Oh you're right, you can see in the video it's Feralas, not Un'Goro. 
---
https://youtu.be/kcQrnCRb4T4?t=174
---
Yeah but nobody remembers freaking pre-DM economy because the majority of Vanilla (23/26 months) happened after it got released. This shit is stupid dramatization and fearmongering.
---
Thank you for that resource :) Ill check it out

but you carry around poisons, vanishing power, tea

If only that asshole priest camping the Burning Charm mobs felt the same way.

Haha yeah it's better for the economy overall...but as a filthy mage we still have plenty of other ways.
---
Can someone tell me when Ony resets on US servers this week?
---
Ain't nobody chatting if you ally though...
---
Nope, definitely can't, seems lashers were another private server mistake and are actually immune to nature damage. There goes that method! Walked into the first pull, saw hurricane doing no damage, so much for that plan.
---
I was wrong. It's Feralas.
---
Thank you, for taking time to answer.
---
The no changes people for the most part are literally talking about no changes from their pserver lol
---
Sure, if you’re being philosophical.. in a present day ask reddit thread no, not everything is a fantasy name except names from the fantasy genre
---
I didn't mean to look down at people who like retail at all, hope you didn't feel that way :)
---
Grab a group and 5 man scholomance on repeat.  It's not a long instance, and after the initial clears, it's a very densely packed blue-fest (and sometimes purple).
---
[quote]Every time I clear my bags after a dungeon, I look at my gold and think "well there's another easy 25g".[/quote]
---
Total bullshit
---
I'm a Druid tank. Was a druid back in vanilla and loved tanking then, still do now. DPS generally had a death wish back then and they still do now, so other than which classes have a death wish more than others nothing has really changed much for me. Infact, the best thing I love about tanking is that I can generally fix it so we can still make do.
---
The biggest problem for me is that whilst I can tank 5 mans no problem and find groups really easily, I cannot find a guild on my server wanting a feral tank. If I respecced to HotW/NS I'd get a guild as a healer very quickly, but frankly I did that in vanilla and I find healing raids so boring that I'd rather quit than heal.
---
Which is a shame, as I'll be stopping playing not because I don't find the game fun, but I can't see where I go from where I am. Am letting my subscription lapse unless I can find a guild. PvP update and battlegrounds may change my mind.
---
Well they are plants....
---
Thanks a lot! :) I'm pleased you like it
---
As a 36 Warrior what Stance should I be in?
---
I've been reading I should be using Whirl Wind, but for 25 range and "stance dancing" I don't feel like all that extra work is worth it.
---
I feel pretty content with, charge, rend, SA,SA,SA, Hamstring fish for a overpower?
---
Or should I just charge, SA, switch to Berserker Stance, Whirl Wind, switch to Battle Stance, and Hamstring fish?
---
Or should I just charge, SA, switch to Berserker Stance, Whirl Wind, and only switch back to  Battle Stance if I get a Overpower proc?
---
I just feel like whilst in Berserker Stance I need to take breaks more frequently. And I get sad when I get 25 rage and miss the WW or only get like minimum Damage. I think my problem is that I put two points into Improved Overpower... And into Impale... But I don;t feel like spending 5g now to respec.
---
Thanks a lot mate! :)
---
That is actually a thing I was thinking about, but It was later, after I've equiped it They've told me what was it worth. What is a way to avoid things like this other than install an addon which tells me what to do? :(
---
I went in with zero friends because of this. I wanted to play this for me, and I know how flaky my friends are. No regrets.
---
Just a small guild that got the world first kills in Classic for Rags and Onyxia.
---
Some hard working guys and gals who have shown they can cut loose from time to time.
---
Aah, you see the problem with "obvious humour/sarcasm" is that it's usually funny.
---
:D thanks man, makes me happy :)
---
I still play with my 2 best friends for around 20 years, who i also played classic with back in the day. One i play with almost daily, and the other just had a son so he doesn’t play as much, but he’ll get to 60 eventually. I love having a nostalgic interest with them, and have another thing to meet around.
---
There isn't a real threat meter addon. The API calls don't exist in classic. At best you can get one that guesses but that isn't much better than human estimates
---
Jerry is a weirdo and lacks leadership

In order to test it and make a comparison.  Many people were expecting it to be similar to private servers.  Just as many people knew that private servers were incorrect.

Quest, grind, or dungeon farm. 
---
Fastest for a mage? Grinding with some quests (only ones that are easy and in your path). 
---
Simplest to do while watching tv or otherwise occupied? Grinding. 
---
Open world and slower than grinding mostly? Quests! Tanaris, feralas, hinterlands, ungoro, Searing Gorge, Felwood, and azshara are decent choices in your late 40s and early 50s. 
---
Want to just dungeon grind? ZF is viable till 52 or so. Mara is not great experience if you do princess runs, but full clears are decent xp and give loot. ST is usually not farmed, but you can find a group for it if you look while doing other things. Once 53+, farm BRD for best in slot and quests.
---
Underrated comment. I'm a mage playing with a warrior and the warrior pulls with a gun sometimes just to make sure we're not gonna pull extra stuff.
---
GG time to go level up a hunter.
---
If it makes you feel better, the loot tables were nerfed to the ground and the pathing was changed too, so nobody can/wants to farm it anyway.
---
Lasher farming was a thing for levelling and for drops for a VERY tiny window in vanilla, but was nerfed. My mage was 55 when DM was released, and I farmed the East lasher pack to level to 60. For like 3 days they were crazy good for money and dropped tons of blues, but that was quickly nerfed and before I even hit 60 they were only worth it for XP.
---
I've played so much classic and leveled so many alts on retail, I know the instance inside out and know every little shortcut, Quest, sidebosses, events and so on.

I usually dont hate that instance, I dont love it either. Its on the same level as temple for me. I usually run it often enough to get all the relevant loot. I usually advertise a clean and smooth run and if everyone listens, its stupidly easy.  
---
The worst parts are the jump after electrocutioner. Most people jump from the highest spot and also most groups clear the trash before the boss counter clockwise.  
---
If you do it clockwise, you can jump onto small platforms where you can skip the entire room below the boss and dont lose any HP by falldamage. Usually this jump is a wipe for all groups.  
---
Then there is the tunnel towards the endboss (if you wish to skip crowd pummeler). Cuddle the wall on the left and prioritize alarmbots. Also always look out for mines by the dwarves. Either kill them or get out of range.  
---
The rest of the instance is a piece of cake.
---
I try to post them on the weekend if possible, for that Saturday/Sunday-morning cartoon effect :)
---
This is spot on.
---
The annoying thing is that no one ever waits before dps, even when asked to. If I'm dpsing i always wait 5s or till 2 sunders on primary before going in, but no one else ever seems to. Rogues hugging the tank and opening up before the tank has even swung, hunters multishotting and letting their pets taunt, etc. Its a mess.
---
I blame things like dps meters adding a competitive element to what should be cooperative, and the excess of guides convincing people they are far more competent than they are, diminishing self examination.
---
Actually, it's all about farming Tribute as a hunter. Lasher farm is worse than it was on private servers, as those had a looooooot of loot tables wrong. DM Tribute is where the ridiculous GPH is at.
---
Dragons are immune to fire damage
---
Sucks that they took out wall jumping
---
Also should be noted that if you connect with HS and flurry is up your swing will not consume flurry charges. 
---
It's arguable as impactful or even more impactful than the offhand featurebug.
---
Guys are saying it's a centaur, but it looks like a ogre skin...
---
Why are APES videos literally the best wow videos ever. That one in Blackrock was fucking epic.
---
I forgot to flair it, sorry
---
Hm. that's actually something reasonable. :/ Hence I've included the smiley face there :D
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
found the mage
---
Ah yes the eternal debate of what DM is. No DM East is Dire Maul East. Only DM by itself is Deadmines (some people will say Deadmines is VC, after Van Cleef)
---
Hi, /u/TheGMan1981
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dibpva/to_everyone_that_thought_dire_mail_was_going_to/). 
---
Could you be the same hardcandy that got put on blast in that one ZF run video? If so tell your lock friend they are terrible lmao
---
Not entirely true:  The 0/31/20 build for warriors allows viable dps or tanking.  You're not the MT for raids or the chart-topping DPS warrior, but you can tank any dungeon, off tank any raid, or dps anything.  You do have to carry around a bag full of gear to swap out though.
---
The main problem with tanking is the cost.  From the gear cost before the run to the consumables cost during the raid (health pots, dynamite, food, etc.) to the repair costs afterward, tanks struggle to break even, much less save for those big-ticket items (Lionheart Helm, epic mount, etc.).
---
You're attacking other people for having a lifestyle different than your own. That's pretty sad.
---
Fuck dire maul then.  I guess I’m gonna keep farming felcloth in felwood.
---
The scene when they’re in the pug with the replica guns and vinnie Jones character has desert eagles. Go look it up and then look at your ban hammer scene.
---
Dire Maul was released in 1.3.
---
We are playing with 1.12 balance changes.
---
Makes plenty of sense to me, guy.
---
Lol, Pagle is already at 300g for Shadowfang. People are better at the game now, which means they have more gold too.
---
"This is bad"
---
"This is how it's always been"
---
"NO IT WASN'T AS BAD BACK THEN BECAUSE FEWER PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT THE BAD THING"
---
no. Just no. I had a friendlist full of people soloing DM once the news spread.
---
Lol, my screen crack was right on the slash symbol, wondered why you used ==
---
=P
---
I don't have mine either and I didn't say a majority of 60s had it either, just that I've seen plenty of people who did, long before today, so DM farming isn't the only way OP can get his epic mount. Not sure how your comment is relevant to that fact.
---
What are friends?
---
Imagine comparing the greatest athletes the world has to offer in peak physical condition to a bunch of dudes who probably don’t even shower every other day
---
Do you add no harm before or after / target?
---
The point is that Dire Maul farming isn't necessary in order to get your epic mount.
---
Thank you. Only got the shoulders +DEF at Sunken Temple, I'll need to farm the monkey ones but it's such a chore...
---
How much Fire Resist do you think is enough for MC ? Isn't it only needed for Rag and Geddon or something?
---
Fuck off
---
Congrats on the upgrade! But, you should have let a melee grab that considering like we have pointed out, a blue from a 5man is better for you.
---
Where do you got this information though? 
---
We're trying to actually find information about this on actual vanilla wow but it seems the first video posted on Youtube with the keywords "Dire Maul" and "Lasher" [was posted 3 years ago by someone playing Nostalrius](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dire+maul+lasher&amp;sp=CAI%253D).
---
its nerfed anyway, so dont bother.
---
Not sure I follow you.  You’re worried I will inspire a rogue, mage or warlock to tank?
---
It definitely was not worth 3000g at any point in Vanilla.
---
That's not a vacation lol
---
I never said anything about retail.
---
Yes you can. But if you do, you'll have less stuff than the guys who do nolife the game. Nothing wrong with people wanting to be as successful as they can be.
---
Is this satire? lmao
---
I like trying to use the characters several times - I think it gives people the chance to develop relationships with each :) If you didn't see already, she's also in episode 5 and 6 (I believe) !
---
Uhh, yes they do. The loot drop tables from Vanilla still exist. . .
---
somme undead are immune to shadow damage im pretty sure so that crits me too
---
Meanwhile, I'm begrudgingly on a PVE server. Ran into a Horde warrior doing an escort quest in Ashenvale. Escort mob was neutral. &gt;:) I love finding ways to grief people on PVE servers when I can't just outright kill them. Makes it more of a challenge but quite fun.
---
Love it.
---
During the AQ event on Tichondrius back in the day we went hostile with cenarion circle and kited Keep Remulos all the way below tanaris to the hidden canoe village and halted the quest being done for a day. Gave horde time to catch up.
---
well jokes on me
---
Another private server mistake. Same exact thing as Princess being immune to nature damage, while all Pserver guides say druids have it easy with Insect Swarm + Moonfire.
---
Barely matters though cause the lashers don't drop shit anyway (which is how I personally remember it from Vanilla as someone who levelled a mage 55-60 exclusively killing them) so you aren't missing out on anything.
---
"will be". Last time I have checked, it's phase 1 still so they weren't farming honor. Since people mentioned it was Feralas and DM entrance, that's understandable. However, idk how you reach Feralas from Tanaris even with slowfall, I guess it wasn't Tanaris as a jumping point either.
---
Sense of accomplishment has nothing to do with masochism.
---
For the same reason why someone would play on Hard difficulty in a game or Hardcore in Diablo 3/Path of Exile and the likes, or on Instantdeath in games like NieR:Automata.
---
Because it makes the game much more interesting to me.
---
Sure, I got annoyed sometimes when I died here, same when I played Diablo 3 or PoE, only played in hardcore and lost SO many characters. I still kept playing, always in harcore, and I really enjoyed those games.
---
It makes me play the game differently and try to find solutions to new proplems that I would've never seen if I played normally.
---
&gt;GG time to go level up a hunter.
---
You are in for a bad surprise LUL
---
One so far. But he is a massive flake when it comes to video games. Got to 27 then started another game and then another and then another.
---
He never finishes a game or reaches max level ever. Drives me nuts.
---
Typically need to sprint first to get out of melee range then vanish if you want it to be more reliable. I find it pretty difficult not to just reaction vanish and get immediately broken out as you say. It does mean you can't use sprint on cooldown to speed up the farm but it sure as hell beats dying.
---
I'm not butthurt my man. That's the people attacking others for nolifing the game.
---
Dire Maul is a 5 man dungeon that was originally added with patch 1.3.0 in Vanilla (Mid-2005ish). 
---
It's notable for introducing level 55 mage water, some new BIS gear, additional librams, and introducing the idea of multiple dungeon paths (You can disguise and skip bosses for a 'tribute run' rather than just clearing all bosses)
---
Most people run it at level 60 but it's technically 44-54. It's also split into 3 sections.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/dire-maul](https://classic.wowhead.com/dire-maul)
---
central-ish feralas.  On the north side of the path.
---
You know vanilla had patches, right?
---

---
There should be little healing necessary in a proper spellcleave group. The mages will be using triple the mana the healer needs to use.
---
He's also apparently never seen a gold farmer.  They ran that all day long as solo hunters.
---
I was so looking forward to being able to AOE farm as a priest. 
---
F.
---
It’s not safe spotting if you die lol how can you be safe and die 🧐
---
Low levels get a shot of my Gnomish Deathray while fighting mobs. If they live after I leave them
---
I said nothing of the sort. 
---
Learn to read before you comment.
---
Removing this one thing "nerfs mages"?
---
One with fiery, and one with icey bro ...  duh.
---
Strength in numbers for sure
---
And the changes to tribute runs where theres ALSO proof on youtube`?
---
Not sure what server is best for horde population. Prefer non PVP, any advice?
---
It’s a dungeon. A pretty big dungeon.
---
I don't think they specifically nerfed it for classic. I think it was always nerfed and private servers were just wrong.
---
Hey Xeyon, nice catch! :) The second bit is technically correct, but it is the European launch date for the original WoW, where a lot of us took our first steps :) I'll add you to the Easter Egg hunter list!
---
Well yeah, that's the problem. That's like saying my car doesn't drive the same way as the same make/model does in a video game...
---
It's a level 50-60 instance, similar to BRD in terms of the size but it's split into 3 wings.  The easiest, is East which is also where the key comes from.  West and North are slightly harder, but mostly high 50s dungeons -- both these require the key from East to complete.  The most difficult run is the "tribute" run where you do not kill any bosses in the North wing except the last boss, this allows you access to to the "Gordok Tribute" which offers multiple higher ilvl Blue items, including a few BiS items for various classes.
---
everything about this, particularly the application process is hilarious for a fifteen year old game Whose end game could be cleared by a well trained chimp. 
---
If someone making you do an hour long interview, that right there should be all the red flags you need.
---
As horde on Rattlegore anytime I'm out ganking and your side builds a team to fight back we build an entire raid to shut yall down so for our server the alliance stand no chance and if your a gnome lock that was hillsbrad yesterday ... lol
---
Ah my mistake. Thanks
---
I think like 80% of the guild don't work and just cash in from the goverment/or stream.
---
**You** don't give a shit, and that's fine. You're not offering your perspective as your perspective though, you're saying that everyone should be a casual and that anyone who tries to maximize their damage is a tryhard. That's cringe. You don't have to be in the top 5% for things like that to matter to you. 
---
Try to fall back on something other than "LOL, U READ BAD" when someone disagrees with your high horse bullshit.
---
Then they go on reddit and complain that it takes 2 hrs to find a tank, the ones they get suck, and that tank classes refuse to do it.
---
I myself went through WoWwiki and searched from the patch DM was released to 1.12 to see what changes happened
---
Also on wow head here is the link to the comments section for lashers
---
[Whip Lashers](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13022/whip-lasher#comments)
---
 1.4.0 - min level changed and a grammer error, and a bug fix to mizzle  proclaiming king, bug fix to Cho’Rush the Observer not contributing loot  
---
 1.5.0 - Gordok Courtyard Key and the Gordok Inner Door Key are now zone  bound items. These items only exist within the Dire Maul zone instance,  and players will lose these keys from their inventory if they leave  
---
 1.6.0 - imps for warlock mount not getting stuck in portal. Tribute  chest no longer despawning to fast. A neutral graveyard has been added  in Feralas, just to the southwest of Dire Maul. Characters dying in Dire  Maul will use this new graveyard.  
---
 1.7.0 - The Ogre Tannin Basket in Dire Maul should stick around longer  if someone opens it and does not initially loot the tannin from it.  
---
 1.9.3 - King Gordok can no longer be separated from Cho’Rush the Observer in Dire Maul.  
---
 1.10.0 - relics added to DM among other places to be dropped. Dire Maul  library book quests are no longer repeatable. Magister Kalendris has  been moved in to the middle of the hall. Guard Slip’kik’s patrol path  has been altered. Tendris Warpwood will now call upon any protectors  still alive to aid him.  
---
 1.11.0 - Dire Maul Librams may now drop in any wing. Class specific  enchantments given by Zanza the Restless no longer require Arcanum  (Librams) from Dire Maul. The requirements have been changed to items  found within Zul’Gurub. Speak with Zanza the Restless for more  information. The Ironbark Protectors in DM West now have an Entangle  Root spell that lasts for \~12 seconds.
---
Ahmpy just did it.
---
ST groups are generally difficult to find, it's not a heavily run dungeon and it's quite long.  I'd recommend questing until ~54-55 and then farming BRD for BiS gear.
---
I got to 35 on my warrior but all my friends blasted to 45 before I could log in again. Killed the fun for me
---
They are the only class that has it worse then me when it comes to leveling
---
Even games made for children have you kill things.
---
This game is rated T, there isn't exactly a ton of gore either.
---
I'm on Horde PVP, so no one goes to Deadmines anyway.
---
Wot, have you never played a game for 5 hours before?
---
I thought I was going to be able to make money for once :(
---
What is the best enchant for leveling an alt for each class? Like for mages I have heard +30 sp or +22 intellect...
---
&gt; no, pve is extremely boring and I would slit my wrists within a week of playing their 60 hour pve schedule. Nerds to the extreme just to not be bored as fuck IMO. Must use a lot of adderall.
---
The hours of pve is to get the good gear asap for the pvp. apes is a pvp guild first and foremost, dwarves/gnomes are the pvp races on alliance. Token night elves here and there for druid obv.
---
so are you dumb or
---
Its fine in most cases. Everyone is much better now than back in the day. Healers have better connections and DPS kills things faster.
---
&gt;Metagaming is just the best way to do something.
---
Which is a stupid definition. The word refers to something that is referential to an idea or convention, or as a prefix to something that is changing.
---
My original server had a **MasonDixon**. I saw him all the way up through Legion
---
No this isn’t the same logic. Educating younger people is something that is admirable. It’s a civic service.
---
Playing wow all day everyday is not the same at all no matter how much dedication you have to it.
---
You eat pieces of shit for breakfast?
---
I mean charging has such an advantage, that if you don’t you might die.
---
But the funny thing is, warriors represent the highest populated class type, followed by mages. So by theory the pool of warriors would be quite a big one. So there should be at least tanks available for even 5-mans. But if that's not even happening, I think tanks are just burnt out from bad pug experiences, and they may not even be wanting to tank in the first place.
---
Gotta love those lock hellfires while the tank has 5 mobs on them or the life tap to full mana and not eat after
---
&gt;Using private servers as a comparison
---
You could use castsequence macros and then they just hit the button over and over.
---
Not nerfed, pservers just wrong yet again.
---
Drop chance is about 20%.
---
"in classic"
---
We did it, Harreh!
---
What class is she? There are a number of classes that only hit one button. Maybe she could play a warlock or mage?
---
Lack of Tactical Mastery really hurts. Its very much a T2+ raid spec.
---
What do you wear for tanking as Fury? Do you still just go full Defense rating?
---
i wonder if this is why they didnt release it with p2
---
You mean with pvp?
---
It's just less CD dependant, higher burst but less combo points, harder to play though.
---
A lot of people on suicide watch in these comments
---
If you're using a 1h sword, cruel barb from VC in deadlines is a great sword. I've been using since about 18 and am almost 40 now.
---
Mage --&gt; Set up bartender with a huge ass icon in the middle with frostbolt --&gt; Profit
---
(Decursify is decent if they also want to decurse in raids)
---
Character: ding!
---
Me: okay
---
A couple hours later, in the middle of nowhere: oh right the talent points...
---
But really, I probably view the levels 40 and 60 as a holy grail too much because of tons of content related to those. Hopefully it's easy to gear my mind more towards immersion into the world right on my current level without chasing the dings. Maybe I should try to seek PVP, level 23 is not 3 after all!
---
Lol to be fair I'm level 34 druid atm so I figured it was you.
---
Yeah if you ever see my guild tag we are going to gank just fyi (knights of the ni)
---
what you are describing is a subtlety rogue. They can vanish twice When using Preparation( i removes the cooldown of all other abilties and it has a 10m cooldown). Vanish also breaks any slow or movement impairing effects. 
---
The only way to prevent this is by putting a debuff on the rogue that will prevent him from going stealth. (like faerie fire from a druid). As a mage, the only thing i can think of would be a DoT from fire. but its always possible to vanish and stun/ambush inbetween Ticks
---
"whenever new content is released, you won't be getting it at its released state you'll get it at a patched time-shifted future incarnation!"
---
does that sound like a "classic" selling point to you?
---
Streamers are clearly the exception to the rule. These APES dudes are not making anything close to guys like soda or Asmon
---
As a dwarf rogue, I commend you my short brethren
---
You are the asshole. But what you should have done is had all the people that greeded /roll and if any of them beat your need roll then pass it to them. If not keep it.
---
I've never had a dps say anything to me about not healing them between pulls, if someone did it would be an easy response "If you are taking damage you are doing your job wrong. If you are dead i'm dong my job wrong. So right now one of us has done their job wrong and its not me...."
---
The already farmed devilsaur gets crafted into items all the time, this definitely affected the supply of leather.
---
SM= Scarlet Monastery
---
So much better talent points to be used over increased armor
---
The one thing stopping me from using this is seeing the quests and quest objectives on the world map. If this had that, I would definitely use it over questie.
---
Use macros to switch between berserker stance and battle stance.
---
I have overpower on 3 in both battle and berserker with this macro:
---
/cast \[nostance:1\] Battle Stance
---
/cast Overpower
---
I have Whirlwind on 4 in both with this macro:
---
/cast \[nostance:3\] Berserker Stance
---
/cast Whirlwind
---
So combat goes: Charge -&gt; 4 (stance change+WW) -&gt; Berserker Rage -&gt; 3 (to revert to battle) -&gt; sunder till WW is up again.
---
At 36 you should be taking on two mobs whenever possible with this order:
---
Charge -&gt; SS -&gt; Berserker Stance -&gt; Berserker Rage -&gt; WW -&gt; Battle Stance -&gt; Cleave/execute.
---
With a decent weapon they'll be dead really quick.  Watch for dodges and use OP whenever you can.
---
Looks like nerfed compared to private servers. Comments on the [Whip Lasher](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13022/whip-lasher#comments) page show that nerfs were probably already in by Patch 1.6.0
---
How can you have a job and play 15 hours a day every day lmao
---
Haha post this in r/AITA please
---
Wtf... there is nothing to say. 
---
Hope you find a more "frendly" hardcore guild.
---
&gt; Having there be absolutely no devilsaur leather on the AH or in trade chat for 5 hours is a decent troll.
---
But that's not what happened...
---
doing 4 mage aoe is fine so that you level crazy fast is fine, but being the one mage in a  5man using blizzard vs 1 or only 2 mobs is the actual definition of being mentally fucking retarded.  try being a tank wrangling retards like this, and having to wait for the fucking retard mage to drink every pull, not knowing what CC is and not knowing how to wait for tank threat.   so back to my original point yes fuck streamers spreading this meta, works for mage groups but fucking ruined normal groups.

Yeah I noticed. Even at peak times there's not many ST groups. I think I can get one tonight though and I have all the quests.
---
If not it sounds like I should finish up Searing Gorge, Blasted Lands, and Ungoro then I should be good for BRD.
---
All the friends that said they'd play with me are all still playing FFIV online. except one who just decided to join a different server and also picked the opposite faction.

Mages go back to ZF and remain rich.
---
no focus in vanilla
---
From the rare then? The bosses loot tables are wool cloth and silk cloth
---
Why would a simple game need to be nerfed anyways
---
This happened to me a week ago. Weirdest shit ever. I really couldn’t find a way out and thought “there’s no way this was always here, people would get stuck all the damn time”
---
What's the lock going to do? He will break the sheeps, instantly get killed by 10 players, those 10 players will tank the devilsaurs until the dots drop and re-sheep them.
---
The lasher farm ? I don’t get that do these mobs keep respawning ? Without reseting the dungeon ? Or what does lasher farm even means
---
I've already respeced once :(
---
I have the Bonebiter, Ravager, and Mograine's Might.
---
Been using Bonebiter because of level requirements.  
---
I guess I'll try your method any switch back to Battle for Overpower...I messed up and put two points into Overpower upgrade in the talent tree.
---
Because other people have already gone through and corrected it?

Err that's how I leveled 52-60 as a frost mage in vanilla...so idk about your post buddy
---
Magic Find gear, obviously
---
They said phase 2 is coming out before the end of the year though.
---
Don't think there was anything in classic?
---
As a fairly passive druid, I will bear this in mind ;)
---
I tried fury prot, and while it generates more threat than an arms/fury leveling/pvp spec, it feels clunky since you can't switch stances without losing all your rage due to not having tactical mastery. I haven't noticed significant issues with threat in prot unless DPS opens up to early, or I get disarmed (and forget to switch gloves)
---
Also, conc blow is great for clearing trash in dungeons- if your DPS can kill the mob while it's stunned, you don't need to worry about aggro.
---
Non answer? Came to be difficult because I disagree with your assessment? Hard to spark a genuine conversation with someone when they constantly say "prove me wrong" or "can you honestly challenge what I am saying?". I don't have empirical evidence to provide you nor do I know the reasons Blizzard has delayed a feature but do disagree with your conclusions you have determined from anecdotes and assumptions.
---
Yeah, cluttering up the forum with this insignificant event.
---
seriously, this video is peak cringe
---
It doesn't matter what it sounds like man, it's what it is, has been, and always will be. You bitching about it on Reddit won't change that.
---
You’re probably one of those cowards who do exactly what my post mentions
---
Sure, if you support yourself streaming, playing WoW is your job. If you are rich and retired early, playing WoW all day isn't a good thing but at least you support yourself.
---
Most people aren't in that position though.
---
And the swastica was lifted from Indian culture. There is lots the Nazis borrowed from other cultures and mostly tarnished.
---
Oh wow, perfect. Useful! Thanks.
---
0_o but you are literally on the Wow Classic subreddit... so you are looking back at classic....
---

no u
---
I can tell you from personal experience, it took me a while to get a single group together from ST and I wasnt able to complete a couple of the "Collect 15-30 of X item" quests because there wasnt enough drops in 1 run to finish.  It's probably worth it to bang out the easy ones, and get the Essence quest from the last boss however.
---
I second this, if you want to tank, tank, if you want to aoe shit down, go re-roll a mage and find a spot in the open world and do that. In classic the avg player fails at this simple mechanic,
---
It's not even really hardcore. Most guilds at the top on retail for example aren't as ridiculous, except for the stupid "have X amount of alts for splitraids". It's more that those guilds (on Classic) are just freaking tryharding for content that's relatively easy for essentially no gain. It's also such a toxic environment and usually guilds somewhere in the equivalent range of "top 200-500 on retail".
---
I havent had any luck selling green items on AH, most are listed 10s above vendor price.  I vendor them if they sell for 1g or more, and I send everything else to my bank alt to DE.
---
this got me when i first started playing. I was so upset lmfao
---
then you're a weirdo for caring so much that you're in this thread shitting on people living their lives in a way that you supposedly approve of, there's my judgement
---
It's not "heavily nerfed", private servers just had the loot tables overtuned because they didn't have any solid info on how many items the lashers are supposed to drop.
---
nah those are the ant questgivers /s
---
Oh really? My bad I thought it was raid specific. TIL
---
Considering trinkets can be swapped in most PvP situations after each fight, the AGM is nothing to dismiss. It's a free healthstone.
---
Yes this is a big part of it. I’ve had a friend healing me for most dungeons since level 15 and a lot at 60. Any time I pug a healer it’s just not nearly as good and they do odd things like take 30 seconds before they even start drinking, stand up the second I pull, they randomly waste all of their mana on holy nova then say OOM as I die, they’re secretly a dps spec in healing gear, it can be anything
---
Tell that to all the guilds who haven't killed rag yet. (Mine included qq).
---
I think it looks better and is easier to read. Some people prefer a minimalistic UI.
---
It’s just a matter of personal preference.
---
I'm actually deleting my character, never giving my money to blizz again, I'm 100% done with this game and this company.  Fucking stupid cocksuckers just can't keep their hands off something good.  They just can't fucking stand it.  Fuck these assholes.
---
Wait, what kind of repercussions? They forced you to sign a contract or something..?
---
Comments from 2005 already complained about the nerf:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=13022/whip-lasher#comments
---
&gt;you didn't have huge portions of population trying to rank ASAP with only world PvP being an option
---
Actually, we did. The PVP honor system was introduced in patch 1.4. BGs weren't introduced until patch 1.5. Faction imbalance was a thing since day 1.
---
On kromcrush from Toronto. 20 ping
---
Agreed. Haven't seen a single black lotus so far being maxed herbalist for a month.
---
That's a good point. Wasn't aware of that build.
---
Thanks! I totally forgot about Macros... I'm also a complete noob so I'm assuming:
---
/cast [nostance:3] Berserker Stance
---
/cast Whirlwind 
---
Means that I change mt stance to #3 which is Berserker then automatically cast WW? 
---
One more questions what is "SS" after Charge?
---
It's... it's beautiful
---
All the friends I started Classic with are still here. 3 hit 60 with me. All 4 of us have been raiding for a few weeks. 
---
Another 2 are playing a little bit daily are not 60 but in the mid 50s and 3 or so casual people all still log on casually. 
---
The only person of my friends not playing anymore was a guy who said that he might not be able to play but will give it a whirl. So I think my group did well.
---
Please boomersaurus, tell us more about the good old days when it was up hill both ways and it was always snowing.
---
Nobody’s moving the goalposts. DM was farmed in Vanilla and people made a ton of gold off fo it. I know you think you remember everything perfectly, but you don’t.
---
Those Furys are basing their gearing on outdated private server resources. With 305 weaponskill your mainhand and skills are hitcapped with 6% already and thanks to heroic strike canceling your offhand will hit for much more than in 1.12.
---
Same here. Guess I'll keep leveling my little mage so I have a decent way to make money. Trying to farm a healing priest is just too slow.
---
Dot 4 devilsaurs and AoE fear the Shepherds.  
---
Then hopefully screen capture the fun.  Last part is NOT optional.  I want to see it.
---
Mages still have plenty of options for farming.  If anything this nerfs priests the most.
---
If you aren't eating between pulls, then I agree, you aren't.
---
Imagine playing a game just for fun
---
It was nerfed during vanilla though, both the XP and the drops. You can even see community sites from back in the day where people complained about how good the place was before it got nerfed.
---
Well he is a communist, so he's not exactly the tastiest crayon in the box already.

You get a fun trinket that can apply AOE poison every 15 minutes. If you finish the quest line, you lose the trinket.
---
Its easier to just take 60s. Especially dps. Tanks and healers get leeway due to low supply and not needing hit
---
My brother plays off and on, on all sorts of games so he will come back, i convinced a friend to come back but he wont play without his gf playing too so basically im alone 95% of the time, but i got rl friends on different servers doing different things.
---
I play on Gehennas, where apes and many other hardcore guilds are. Spotting a devilsaur meant death up until recently, because of the contest between Alliance and Horde. It's eased up so leveling isn't too bad as they probably got the leather they needed by now.
---
But but but #nochanges(from my pserver)
---
Most of them reserve 1 for the tank and then RR the rest. It’s very common.
---
Bless your heart. Be the change you want to see. I promise I'll drop WF / GoA for you. If you're a Warlock, keep life tapping (I gotcha Fam). If you're a Mage, just give me more water (that'll slow em down).
---
lol did you even play back then??  None of what you are saying is true.

Hi, /u/Roflewaffle47

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dicb3u/activision_blizzard_is_stance_dancing_now_that_i/). 
---
The thing is if you were level 60 in better gear you’d have better dps... individual output doesn’t matter vs others because you still could be doing more yourself
---
I smell BULLSHIT.
---
like I said, a rough approx. is all that it is (and its also how bliz calculated item budget)
---
Trust the other guys and me in this. They are tryhard and not hardcore. I raided in a consistent top 500 guild during Legion and the first tier of BFA with us killing the final boss every time before a major nerf happened (save for KJ mythic from tier 20 but he is easily one of the hardest bosses ever released and Helya mythic from ToV, tier 19). We were a 7h/week two day raiding guild.
---
I got into the guild by showing them my 99th percentile normal mode logs at the start of the Nighthold, got the discord invite link and they asked me a few things like "have ever done mythic (basically the new 25 heroic) raiding before?" I answered honestly and the GM, Raid lead and two officers asked me to run a few mythic+(dungeon content that scales in difficulty to keep it relevant even to hardcore raiders) with them while just chatting. All of that took around 3 hours but it was really relaxed, since we were having fun in 5 man content that's legitimately harder than freaking tryharding Molten Core. 
---
Anyways, having to prove that you raided heroic LK 25 when it was relevant has no relevance to Classic, since Onyxia and MC can be done with at least half the raid AFK (in onyxia's case even 9/10 of the raid). The only real boss requiring actual skill within the next 6 months (maybe) will be freaking Razorgore, simply because the fight is focused on mechanics of add management.
---
It's justified, IMO, for a world first guild on retail (or a similar guild like APES on Classic) to ask for prove of your past raiding experience, ideally in the form of actual logs, simply because achievements mean jackshit since carrying for gold has existed ever since original vanilla. But not for 99.99% of "hardcore" guilds in Classic. How many people are there with the Hand of A'dal title on retail and they play like shit? Way too many.
---
Name and shame.
---
Tanking pugs is the issue. I will tank guild dungeons all day. Pugs at this level can turn into a pool of toxicity it’s not worth it.
---
Make friend with a druid so he can faerie fire the rogue  and ask him to follow you every where you go ?  A good subtlety rogue is really hard to fight in PvP if you dont have anything to counter his stealth and clothies are a prime target due to being so squishy
---
That one is servicable, as is the plugin TinyThreat from Details! but none of the meters I've found have been great. Neither of these meters read healing aggro and neither properly adjust the actual threat amounts on aggro/threat drops/resets. Take Onys knockback for example. The second person on threat will jump up closer to the tank in terms of the percentage readout, but the tank's numerical threat number never actually changes.
---
i would classify mages as lawful though, definitely not chaotic with their occupation being one of discipline and study. 
---
their prowess for controlling enemies in fights through frost spells and polymorph is another proof of their love for order imho.
---
Glad ive already got my Druid to 40.  At least ill be able to do some herbing on there to make gold.
---
Its kind of annoying in general how tanks bitch enough to get guilds to pay for respecs between raids, but holy is also pretty trash for farming stuff, at least compared to any DPS spec.
---
I just did census on my realm and 47% of players online are at lvl 60.
---
Resistance and hit are separate mechanics.
---
Mage hit chance is capped at 15% iirc. 
---
The talent in arcane that reduces targets resistances is not affecting your chance to hit. In my head, it was used to lower the chance of getting partially resisted on fire spells.
---
Was in guild. Just cropped out
---
Got a vid of the fight and explain whats going on? I played p99 to like lvl 30 druid
---
There is a guy who used to multi box 40 accounts at the same time. He recently did a video of 107 accounts controlled at once. Not botting and I doubt it was perfect clears but it was pretty cool to see.
---
Or the rogue can just make people mounts straight to him/her. Distract FTW!
---
Heroic strike cancelling existed in 1.12. It just didnt exist on private servers.
---
Ever heard of princess runs?
---
It was just a test run so really slow. He's doing second attempt now and gordok is at about 50% hp 10 minutes after he zoned into DM.
---
I think you might need decent gear though, pet takes a lot of damage with the strat he's trying now so the 3 piece tier 1 bonus is helping him a surprising amount
---
Give it a couple days, people will figure out ways to farm it probably as much as you could on pservs.
---
I agree that its hilarious - but pre 1.10 patch DM farming was a real thing in vanilla. Just saying.
---
Just because it doesn’t seem fun to you doesn’t mean others don’t enjoy it.
---
Mezzing for a few hours wasn't so bad.  Having to solo heal 2 tanks in the middle with some pumps and a bard...boy.
---
chaotic? with frost nova and slows they are the best class to take the chaos factor out of most situations.
---
This is dumb. Most groups take 3-4 hunters to MC, all of them will get their rokdelar faster than rogues will get strikers mark. Giving a strikers mark to a hunter who hasn’t got rokdelar is a really dumb thing to do if you’re looking at the long term picture of gearing a raid out for BWL/AQ
---
It was in vanilla. Not just private servers.
---
I dont know for sure, but last reports I can find show close to 60% horde. Of course how this data is collected I'm not sure how accurate it is
---
I'm a firm believer that moves have a hidden trigger. Like when two mobs are 40 yards apart and walking away from each other. And you decide to go between and all of the sudden they double back like they just heard mom call them by their full name. Or when your in a tight spot and need to drink and one mob starts slowly patting towards you up a mountain and across a river and jesus man really! 
---
So yeah. The game knows your in stealth. It wants you dead.
---
Genuine question - is shaman tanking at all viable in 60 dungeons?
---
When DM was first released in vanilla, the lashers gave like elite mob level XP and had a high drop rate for the trash greys with higher vendor prices. It was a go to location for leveling mages, people could go from early 50s to 60 in a matter of a few days just farming the spot and getting alot of gold to boot. However it was nerfed(when exactly I dont know), both the XP and the drops. You can even find people on old community sites complaining about how much better it was before the nerfs.
---
Why do you say that? I never really played retail.
---
Why would you make this up? 
---
Got nothing else to do?
---
wait people are complaining because gold is hard to get?
---
Int / Spirit have been big. Moving more into Mp5 now that I'm level 50+. I just have having to drink after every pull. I thought maybe I'm not being efficient with my down ranks or my healing efficiency / efficacy. Then I had a string of really great PUGs and realized I've been playing with bottom of the barrel players.
---
Maraudon
---
Having fun!
---
had a dumbass alliance kill me bcs he thought i was casting wrath when i was just healing myself...
---
I wouldn't come to Westfall at 10. As you say, that's not good. You don't need to enter the zone until you are level 14 and can start the Defias Brotherhood questline. 
---
I prefer Teldrassil, Darkshore, Westfall, VC, Wetlands, Redridge elites, Stocks, Duskwood, and then wherever the Horde aren't too thick on the ground.
---
I’m not sure why people are down voting you. You can make good money and XP doing this.
---
Do people legit not go to work to play this????  Good lawdy.
---
Yeah you right
---
I don't generally do dungeons on work nights for this reason. Not just because of others abandoning the group but because I may not have enough time and I don't want to flake out.
---
I am losing to other Druids in HOTW/NS, but not by any large amount. But I seriously can not justify switching to a build that can’t tank, as our guilds tanks are over doing dungeons, but they’re all happy to dps them. Which gets awkward because if I ask any guildies if they want to do a dungeon I get a spam of people that all need it still because they can’t find any tanks.
---
I hope some tanks are on for DM today because I don’t have time to run 15 guildies through each wing while passing on my healing pieces

Playing a game doesn't mean sitting in 1 place pressing 1 button every 50 seconds for 5 hours straight for me. Doesn't seem like a fun activity to me at all.

**&lt;ZANCOR&gt;[HORDE][FAIRBANKS-PVP][SEMI-HARDCORE RAIDING][PST]**
---
10/10 MC +Onyxia. First Hand of Ragnaros wielders for Fairbanks Horde side. 
---
**We still have core raid spots available! Warlocks are a very high priority for our first raid team! **
---
*Our second raid team should be launching in the next coming weeks and we are taking applicants for all positions for that raid.*
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Who are we?**
---
Ladies, gentlemen, trolls, orcs, demons, whathaveyous...We are Zancor Gaming, a newly formed gaming community that is itching to hit up the glory days of classic WoW in full force. We are a dedicated bunch looking to push top tier end game content and have a blast while doing so. Who knows ...maybe you’ll make a few lifelong friends along the way. We’re about having fun, meeting new people, and kicking ass. Our player base mainly comprises of individuals between 25-32 years of age with a variety of gameplay experience.
---
We welcome both battle hardened Warcraft players and those who are just joining our world. We foster an atmosphere of teaching those who are learning and doing their best every time they show up, if we’re not improving, then we’re not doing our job.
---
Our leadership team comes from a wide range of play styles. Both guild leaders are Eve online veterans holding leadership positions in large alliances, as well as being seasoned top tier raiders in nearly every expansion in WoW. One of our most notable highlights is being members of a world first Star Wars the Old Republic raid team. We're here to expand upon that experience and pass it along to other players.
---
**Who are you folks looking for?**
---
First and foremost ...we’re a raiding guild. This means we eat, sleep, and dream PVE and dragon slaying strategies. We’re not super hardcore raiders pulling long hours into the night, but we aren’t for the faint of heart either. We will test your mettle and push you to become the best WoW player you can be. We ask that our members maintain a positive attitude and keep their eye on the prize, slaying bosses. New players can be molded into great raiders, but great attitudes can be hard to come by, we don’t care if you’re new to classic, as long as you’ve got a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. Do not be afraid to ask questions, today's students may be tomorrow's masters.
---
**Raid times?**
---
Tuesday, Wednesday **8:30pm-11:00pm PST**.
---
Monday and Thursday(Optional cleanup AKA “The Chungus Raid”) **8:30pm-10:30pm PST**
---
*3 Day lockout raid scheduling will be determined closer to the phase 3 patch.*
---
**What are your expectations?**
---
We expect our members to conduct themselves appropriately both in guild level chats as well as in public. Our members represent our guild to the public and each one should show nothing but respect and understanding to the general player community. Friendly ribbing is fine, but please keep it ToS friendly...we don’t need our friends being banned!
---
We also expect high raid attendance with minimal tardiness. Real life happens, we get it, if you need to miss a raid just let someone know before we start forming and you’ll be excused with no penalty. When we start forming, we expect raiders to come prepared with consumes, enchants, buffs(World buffs not required), and knowledge of our boss strategies. Failure to do so could result in a loss of EP for that specific raid being run.
---
*We also expect clear comms on boss attempts, call outs and communication are key when there are forty raiders in one channel. Banter and whatever else is fine during trash, but we expect to move through content like we’ve done this before… Because we have.*
---
**How about the loot system?**
---
We will be using EPGP with a whitelist. The whitelist is for items such as legendaries, certain BiS items, and tier set completions, when those instances arise, the loot council will make the decision of who gets what. The loot council consists of Officers/Class Leaders, and 3 raiders picked randomly each week to represent their fellow raiders, the GM will step in to break any ties.
---
Raiders can earn bonus EP each week for contributing raid mats to the guild bank.
---
**What are you looking for?:**
---
**High Priority:**Warlocks
---
**Mid Priority:**Resto Shamans, Rogues
---
**Low Priority:** Enhance Shaman, Shadow Priest, Tanks, Warriors
---
*Exceptional players of any class are encouraged to apply regardless of class priority need. Raid spots are not set in stone and can be contested. We are over recruiting so that we are able to form the most stable roster possible. After the first team is built, a second team will be formed.*
---
**That sounds great! Where can I sign up?**
---
You can start with telling us a little about yourself [here!](https://forms.gle/cRucWvvKFSCrFDCb9)
---
You can also visit our discord if you have any questions. You can find that [here](https://discord.gg/PC9TQv4)
---
There is no comparison to the 'ranking' of 2004 and what will occur today. Just like the raiding is no comparison.
---
Explain to me why the DPS need an HP buff.
---
Because of new mechanics found in Classic, that weren't on private servers.  
---
When heroic strike is queued, your off hand will use the yellow hit formula, meaning you only need 6 hit to make your off hand not miss, if you queue/cancel heroic strike correctly.  
---
But even without that mechanic, mask of the unforgiven was worse than eye of rend. Hit past the yellow cap just doesn't do as much as 1% crit and 30 AP.   
---
Maybe stop trusting random websites and actually use your brain when you choose gear.
---
Yeah thanks for advertising it. Never knew about it, but as a priest out in the wilderness alone, I’ll have a hand...I don’t know if it will be the upper hand...but it’ll be raised.
---
this isn't 2005 dingus it's 2019
---
Kirtonos' faction split is well balanced. Good realm culture also
---
Because not everyone is trying to level at a ridiculous pace and especially a newbie.
---
All of my friends and I are still going. We are all Level 45-50 so we should hit 60 in a few weeks. The bigger issue is I am seeing 1 alliance for every 10 horde. I play on KromKrush US. Ally don't exist in questing zones anymore.
---
Not on our patch tho
---
Please god let this be real.
---
The post is not real
---
/r/MurderedByWords
---
On my realm almost half the playing population is at lvl60. It's no longer minority group.
---
Overhype much?
---
People averaging 300 viewers on twitch with &lt;50 subs are making like a quarter of minimum wage if that, so...
---
Apparently jump runs are nerfed as well, which sucks ass for me as a warrior.
---
Because this is just some poor attempt at karma. Every question he gets is answered with a deflection. Not to mention his post history.
---
Because it's phase 1?
---
&gt;NA trying to cope
---
I really think this spawns from people having never played classes outside their comfort zone. Shame cause I bet they'd have fun, like playing a while different game. Also a shame because they think we're bad when actually they're just bad.
---
Let me simplify this for you. There's a hard limit on rich thorium vein spawns in the open world. Dire maul adds several rich thorium veins every time someone enters the instance. That's a massive fucking impact.
---
this is why I ONLY try to run with guild members.
---
I totally agree with this. Actually most warriors I s talked to have said how cool they think it is. And at least healers can keep up with them when they do it in AQ/Naxx when the switch is justifiable. I am not a fan of the people attempting it right now, they die almost the second they pull
---
&gt;	 It just gets frustrating that apparently you are an ass and a sociopath if you enjoy world PvP 
---
Lol yeah you’re being a dick. You’re running around in STV with the most powerful combo in Classic PvP with warrior and priest and ganking low levels and attacking on sight. 
---
That’s part of world PvP, no one is denying that, but all your comment says about you is that you’re salty that people think you’re a dick. You are, just accept it. 
---
It’s always funny when the kids who don’t play fair cry when people get annoyed with them.  “Wah, but it’s part of the game!!!”  So is my kill on sight list. So is forum posting. Stop crying about your reputation. It’s your fault you have it. You’re almost as bad as people who cry that ganking is unfair. Let people get mad, who gives a fuck.
---
Nah my name in game is Rockstedy.
---
12 target, must kill all of them within.. few minutes of eachother or they rez.
---
trick is, they have an obnoxious AoE, so killing all of them together isn't really possible... instead, you pull 1, DPS it down to 5%, mez it... pull a second, DPS it down to 5%, mez it... repeat for all of them ( there's only 6 mezzable, the other 6 are off-tanked).
---
the entire process took over an hour. as an enchanter your job was to babysit your mezed councilmen for over an hour... nothing else to do.
---
Incredibly boring fight.
---
I like to watch from the sides, but there's one that I remember so clearly. I watched this 15 min long battle of like 10-15 people trying to grab the chest. 
---
One guy managed to open it, but got feared immediately; with the chest still open, a rogue sprints in from the corner and looted all the content. By far the best match i've watched cause i could only imagine how salty the guy who opened it was.
---
How does 2 heals heal "everyone"?
---
And if I heal everyone, now you gotta wait for me to drink anyway
---
"Conservatorily"
---
I'm baffled every time this happens... so I'm baffled a lot.
---
yeah I'd much rather stand in place and hit my dps button.
---
The amount of tanks that charge forward when the healer is low on mana is mind-boggling. After buffing the entire party, people should expect to wait another 20-30sec to drink, but they don't. They see the buffs, think they're g2g, and just run off.
---
If you know your healer very well and you've run the instance a lot: cool. I trust you. But random pugs? Too many people in the 50s who are specced to DPS and are healing with just int gear; their heals take longer to cast and are less effective. I wouldn't pull a group of 7 with my healer at 35% mana in this case. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
---
I might be a bit different from the average player in the sense that I have a fairly good understanding of what every class brings to the table. I blame the chronic altitis, but it's been useful in the past to be able to assist people in small ways (please use your interrupt, it's called [x]).
---
I skipped that one I think or missed the quest line, I had a quest to escort a Nelf to Ashenvale and that was it. I saw someone escorting a human towards darkshore so I assume it’s that one
---
and then you try to advertise your tanking services (by say, reserving orbs from strath) and get actually yelled/laughed at half the time. Its no wonder people swap, because you dont actually have a way to make any money
---
So much stupid in one post
---
I don't bring water, but I do bring food. I life tap my mana back and then eat. Is that cool?
---
Nothing really to boost damage, most other enchants are only +7 at most to one stat and by level 20 or so you are getting items with equal stat distribution.  Maybe +100 mana or health to chest but overall I would say it isnt worth it.
---
I would recommend putting minor speed increase on a set of boots, thats something I like to use for the little bit of extra speed with all the running you do early on.  Definitely more a convenience item than anything else though.
---
it is only game why you heff to be mad?
---
However, Improved revenge stacks with other stuns without DR
---
I wasent even thinking of playing when they announced it 1 year ago. Heard 2 days before release and thought "Huh let's try vanilla out"
---
I'm hooked! level 46 priest and loving it.
---
So much hate (or trolling) over a nerf that isn't even a nerf.
---
warlocks are very chaotic though. summoned demons are enslaved and not contracted. 
---
fear? chaos, same for shadow priests though. 
---
sacrificing your own health for mana? chaos.
---
a ritual that kills a random party member in order to summon an aggressive demon? come on, that's not lawful.
---
Oh wow, didn't realize you could adjust unit frames with that. Thanks!

The fact blizzard started their classic from 1.12 is of course the biggest change from actual vanilla and their huge mistake. They haven't delivered the game people asked for. 1.12 was itemized for the late game of vanilla (blue items with hit etc. etc.).
---
Cookie pull that up
---
Yes indeedy!
---
I feel attacked.
---
Lol so many cry babies.
---
One of my favorite features of Everquest 2 was actually the ability to change factions regardless of your character’s race.
---
Yeah that’s bullshit.
---
I'm upvoting this post because it made me laugh
---
none of the dungeons are hard. truth is (unfortunately) that most people are bad and most of them blame the tank.
---
At the end of the day, stamina is worthless until you need it. I run with many priests that never give out shadow resistance, or shamans that don't fully drop totems. If the fort buff doesn't help prevent deaths than I understand saving the mana. With that said I always hand it out at the start, any group that wont let me buff my party members is no group I want to be a part of.
---
Yea it's a lot better to watch people play video games instead like you do 
---
Sorry your life is so shit that you have no free time, maybe you should've made better life choices :)
---
I'll just leave this here -

Your tears are delicious.  WAAA WAAA THIS DOESNT MATCH MY PSERVERS FUK YOU BLIZZARD WAAA WAAAAAAA
---
You get into their Deadzone or you die. Net-O-Matic helps a bunch. Otherwise, Deathcoil -&gt; Fear -&gt; Dots. You are in the fortunate situation not to need to cast to deal damage, which is the bane of a hunter, because they can't kite as conveniently. If they get the jump on you from maxrange, it's going to be tough regardless, but if you're ever close to them, stay there and don't let up.

Its fun to experience for the first 20 minutes then its just trying to get past nerds who literally have no where else to be just trying to be an annoyance instead of actually playing the game. I get classic is doing w/e you want wherever you want but this is borderline pathetic.
---
Yeah they announced it in channel 1 and we started a camping party had a lvl 60 ally pally show up but 7 lvl 25-38 dropped him lol
---
All of my group are too far apart in level to play together and I am the highest at level 51. I also just took a two week break to play some Destiny 2. Thinking about getting back in tonight and do the final stretch to 60.
---
Low tier trolling.
---
I hear you, but when I see a warlock tap all the way down to 200 hp(or less remaining) and we're about to pull...that sure looks concerning.
---

---
I didn't really join to play with RL friends, but all the ones I expected to play are still playing (sadly on other servers from me but oh well). It was my guild I came back for, and there's been some amount of falloff, but less than our replacement rate. We just closed recruiting for our second raid team and are going strong.
---
Yeah. It’s anywhere from “Definitely adding. Good tanks are few and far between” to “lol this group is trash, learn to tank”. Like, DPS have a mindless relaxing job of coasting on basically the tank/healer putting up with their shit. Calm yourself, you’ll run out of tanks if we all put you on ignore
---
Not to mention like 5/6ths are all refugees that have taken repeated heavy casualties.
---
The horde population wise should be the size of a minor neutral faction and shrinking at this point.
---
You could always go tank.
---
But did they add the keyring yet?
---
Imagine people thinking pvp needs to gain something in order to be fun
---
Having tanked a long time ago through WotLK and now multiple times while leveling, I firmly believe the healer should be the leader.  If I’m tanking well, healing should be a coast, and i can tank better if the healer takes over marking targets, and directing what pace I should set.
---
Lastly as the healer, they are paying more attention to health pools and know where the problem is.
---
Is this new pasta?
---
I REALLY hope that they fork the servers when they release the expansions so that there will still be classic servers that we can play on until we finish the content and want to move on to BC and eventually LK
---
Uhhhhh, I'm tapping the button that gives me mana, so Mana Tap
---
Most people level combat and combat works very well with non-dagger weapons in terms of PvE dps. Something in particular is that percentage attack speed increases work better with slower weapons because there's a larger attack speed deduction on a harder hitting weapon. And you know, as combat you'll be favoring slice and dice and you'll also have blade flurry. Having better scaling with your attack speed boosts will definitely outdo poison applications.
---
If you think Healers are only in a dungeon to heal, and DPS are not allowed to heal than this sub cannot help you.
---
What do you mean it’s been removed? Stuff that people were doing on private server that may or may have not been correct?￼ or stuff on YouTube videos from 2006 that have now been tried in the last two hours that doesn’t work.￼
---
Amazing. Lol
---
I can understand people getting frustrated. You don't know what they have been through. I was running arena runs with a warrior who had done about 50 runs and about 10 with our group. Finally on one of the later runs the savage gladiator chest drops and he losses it to a 57 warrior who just joined the group that run. The 57 warrior did nothing wrong but the other warrior was still pissed.
---
Yeah give/take is important.  That's a good idea about 'hobby night'- I have to have this discussion with my wife in a couple weeks once I hit 60 and start raiding!  Or at least saying that "I'll do the baby stuff" if she wakes up so that all my wife would have to do is lie and bed and nurse her and I'd do the diaper, soothing back to bed etc.
---
 that they wasted 5 hours of their life to do a "LJXLIXLULULXD XDXD XD I TROLLED SOYU SHARD XDXDXDCXDXDXD" in such a way like literally no one notices or cares
---
Sap in classic has a chance to break early.
---
This chance is increased against targets higher level than you, elites, or players (meaning it will usually last shorter on those). That also means the debuff cannot show the real durtion since it is randomised.
---
Oh my God- mother fucks running off to next trash and then dieing like "what no heals?"... Like dude... You're not the tank, you're not in LoS and you've basically ran a different instance. 
---
You know what? I'm not even going to rez you. Run back since you like running so much.
---
Oh fuck off.  Not everyone is in a guild where the entire core leveled in a few weeks and then had time to do all the quests, attunements, etc.
---
It's extremely easy to verify the drop rate was always a lot lower than private servers. I don't know how private servers got it so wrong, frankly... the data is readily available...
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060720204438/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/mob.html?wmob=13022
---
there's a 2006 video of a hunter soloing tributes in hunter vs world 3
---
so you're be happy to get "coke classic" that tastes nothing like classic as it was introduced. it's just a label that they use to market a completely different product
---
okay then, at least i know where you stand
---
I had a 60 shaman tank UBRS all the way to drak. It went fine, but he already had good tank gear, draconian deflector etc.
---
&gt; Why is every Apes thread full of naysayers?
---
Because it's overhyped.
---
&gt; How &lt;APES&gt; Trolled the entire server of Ghennas EU
---
Actually they trolled a few dozen people in on a single layer in a single zone.
---
&gt;  Ya'll can't appreciate a great practical joke surrounding a pretty contentious and sought-after mat?
---
It's not that we can't appreciate a practical joke, it's that the ridiculous level of hype and false claims made by APES fanbois detract from the actual joke.
---
&gt; This stops supply.
---
&gt; Neither horde nor Alliance we getting Devilsaur leather
---
&gt; Affects the whole server 
---
Plus the level of hero worship is downright nauseating...
---
&gt; This is amazing.
---
&gt; Living legends
---
&gt; Made my day :)
---
&gt; Amazing
---
&gt; Why are APES videos literally the best wow videos ever. 
---
Literally false.
---
So it's better to stay on them instead of trying to fear, I take it? Sometimes fear makes them run away and then I'm slowed and can't catch up haha. Should I ignore pet completely?
---
Is there a reason why priests could aoe farm DM but not ZF?
---
The dps make me hate tanking.  Fucking calm down stop paying attention to dps meters and kill skull, thanks.
---
The amount of times I've had to chastise the idiots aoeing in a pack full of healer mobs is way too damn high.
---
It looks like lasher farming is not very profitable compared to on private servers.
---
Is this #nochanges or was it nerfed?  Can anyone who AoE grinded back in the day confirm if this is a nerf to WoW Classic?
---
I watched Xaryu pvp some random warlock and the warlock could litterally just dot him and melee him to death. I think the mage would have to be a very large magnitude better and have way better game knowledge to stand a slight chance of winning.
---
It is now!
---
Uhh... a yellow flame on the ground would be a protection Paladin :P 
---
Warriors don’t have an AOE threat ability like that outside of Defensive stance, they have to demo shout (Which basically just gets enough threat to let the healer start healing) then tab sunder targets
---
Honestly I'm not into it, I can easily get special hit capped and begin dual wielding quite soon. My gatorbite axe is about to retire and I won't look back from dual wield fury at that point.
---
What was this “exploit” people were trying to do?
---
My high level toons are alliance on Pagle. My retail friends mostly stopped playing recently except for 3 people who are all altaholics and 20-30 levels below me. I hate alliance and PvE servers, but I rolled ally on Pagle anyways to play with them. We are a Horde guild on Bleeding Hollow (PvP) in retail, so I don't know why the majority voted to play alliance. I made a new Horde toon on Skeram on Friday and have him closing in on 30 (hunter and I was under the weather this weekend).  I wish I didn't waste my time playing a faction/server type I didn't enjoy to play with people who would bail.
---
Did an Uldaman run last night our tank did 8 sunders the whole run and somewhere around 150 heroic strikes.  Aggro was an issue on basically every pull as well.  If I didn’t pull aggro with a single multi shot 8-10 seconds in then the healer did.  Somehow miracled our way through it because stuff isn’t that tough yet.  That guy is going to be a treat as he fails his way upwards.
---
Tldr I have no friends and can't be a responsible adult that doesn't let himself get sucked in by a video game
---
Sorry you have the same addictive vices as 15 years ago, maybe now's a bit late for that self reflection
---
Yeah just tested kromcrush and I’m getting 57 I can handle that so I think that may be my server of choice! There seems to be a decent community there! Any ideas on the faction and class balance? Guessing tanks are lacking as always
---
Was going to respond to you about how it's not cold hearted, then I realized your pun. I like you.
---
Even on like day 2 someone was doing that shit in SFK dude
---
Bye
---
I used to use far sight on my shaman to make swirlies on alliance held AB flags, make them think someone was trying to cap. Made them jump around and start aoeing more often than not
---
You do know time is a zero sum game correct if you are doing something for 16 hours being bolted to your chair you are by definition unavailable to do anything else...like...
---
you know, actually fucking have a job lmfao
---
I'm actually deleting my reddit account, never giving my time to reddit again, I'm 100% done with this website and this company. Fucking stupid cocksuckers just can't keep their hands off something good. They just can't fucking stand it. Fuck these assholes.
---
if someone is enjoying the way they are playing, then yes, they aren't doing it the wrong way. but if someone is not enjoying the game due to their playstyle, and would otherwise enjoy the game with a different playstyle, then i'd argue they're playing the game wrong.
---
I get upset at the opposite, the mage that only offers water. Food might take 30 seconds to make, but it saves so much time in a 30 min dungeon.
---
If the pet pulls agro off of you, then please heal it.
---
Sometimes fear is too hard to get off with the pet etc, then they fear runs away and I'm struggling to keep up. I don't have deathcoil yet so that'll help once I do. Do I ignore pet completely?
---
Paladins don't select heals appropriate to the situation. They spam heal. It's not a cancel casting class.
---
The irony here is that you literally think this stupid site sonehow is what determines what is best and 2h is bad because "look wowclassicbis doesnt list it". That whole site is a garbage can but noobs like you eat it up because it makes gearing brain dead for you.
---
Sweet. The others had me worried
---
Why do we care about tracking the OH weapon swing? Is it not simpler to just track MH? If I have a swing timer for ONLY the MH and turn on Heroic Strike at the start of the swing and turn it off just riiiight before the swing connects we will still be maximizing the improved hit chance window throughout the fight anyhow yes?
---
Throw weapon also has a cast time and you have to stop moving
---
So what? We are at 1.12 for a reason
---
Do you really really think that it takes a healers *full mana pool* to top off dps?
---
Honestly? Why even post if you are just going to exaggerate so much that you are in your own fiction world.
---
#THE GOGGLES, THEY DO NOOOTHING
---
&gt; Do I ignore pet completely?
---
Hard to tell in a vacuum. There are situations where LoSing/outranging the hunter and killing his pet helps, but you run the risk of going OOM before getting to him.
---
Christ that was gay
---
not that it isn't cool, but how is it classic related? there's a sub for wc3
---
Rage dumping when you're over 70 or so rage. There's plenty of raid bosses who will fill your rage meter quite effectively, and you need to spend it on something.
---
Please drop this company and go to pservers.
---
Oh really? Is that why there are more horde than alliance on just about every pvp realm? /s
---
its literally working as intended, it was like this until somebody got some world first with it in TBC
---
Thanks mate, will try it out tonight and reply to this post.
---
She goes back to Warcraft 1. Orc Mission 8 is breaking her out of Northshire Abbey. She's also the author/narrator of the introduction to the story spelled out in the Warcraft 1 manual, explaining the conflict from the Orc side.  
---
She was originally Half-Human, because originally, Warcraft 1 was 20 years after the Black Portal first opened.
---
She got retconned into being Half-Draenei when they retconned the timeframe of the first game (Instead of being 20 years after the portal opened, the conflict lasted only a few years), which eliminated the time window for her to grow up.
---
Pretty similar to RFC.(in city, mostly mob farming, etc).  Just at a different level range.
---
It is quite rare.  But it exists!
---
Whatever lord of weasel dicks
---
To be fair, they don't have to disable ALL combat log reading. That would just be stupid compared to preventing 1-2 msgs from being printed to the log in the first place. Wouldn't break any other addons and would easily disable Spy.
---
its a hardcore guild doing something they find fun. You claim its to do a *"LJXLIXLULULXD XDXD XD I TROLLED SOYU SHARD XDXDXDCXDXDXD"*. 
---
I'm not saying this is the most entertaining or creative idea ever, but I dont get the boring and cliché comment.
---
If you click on him, yes.
---
It's a rage dump both for tanking an dps. Also added threat. About it.
---
Based on numbers alone. There's more horde than alliance on pretty much every pvp realm.
---
Hit them with something that will leave a dot on them if possible. Frost armor will slow them down from running away, otherwise just try to get away and get the advantage. 
---
Rogues are great at PvP because of stunlock, usually you have to get the jump on them in order to win, which can be quite difficult because of their ability to turn the tide of the fight quickly.
---
You can use raid frames in party and turn on pets if you'd like to track them
---
I've been playing casually, so I'm only lvl 48. However I've only truly struggled to tank one boss in all the dungeons I've run (I've only run dungeons as a tank) and it was the Marsh monster in WC. Just ran ZF and it was pretty easy.
---
I dont trust anything lol i just stated that its not listed, i mean go on about your hateboner i dont mind. I didnt put quite as much research into that because simply no one will ever play fucking 2h fury in raids.
---
I guess it’s spartan ui
---
The post isn't edited, or it'd show a star next to it.
---
the cat is me :P   
---
(druid)
---
Good kitty!
---
Should’ve rolled a mage we are running 5x mage DM spellcleave groups.
---
I will try to whisper people more, offering advice / help. I know in the past I've gotten a couple people who replied something like "don't tell me what to do scrub".
---
It definitely irks me when other players voice concerns in party chat just blasting someone though. That doesn't help anyone.
---
...and the trolls were pissed.
---
Hey there. 
---
So I am torn between a warlock and a warrior. Essentially I am looking to roll one class and stick to it. Mainly because I play other games, have other hobbies and don't like to dig too deeply into just one. 
---
So I got a warrior to 6 and a lock to 13 before I started having this inkling. 
---
Warlocks seem to be the best choice for me as I want to be decent in most aspects of the game, Be it raiding, bgs (when they come out), wpvp and so on. 
---
I used to tank a ton back in the day (BC - MoP) so I am going to miss out on that a bit. But I can manage I think. 
---
I guess the deciding factor for me is. 
---
Can warriors do well in the wpvp environment? I know they need a pocket healer, but given the big populations I am seeing, I highly doubt I would have an issue getting some help with pesky level 60s.
---
How about pugging as a warrior? Am I going to be cloughed in raid with a sleuth of other warriors ? Would I ever be able to tank MC or Onyxia as a PuG? 
---
These two factors really keep me from picking the warrior. But my insight is lacking. 
---
If not, I am just gonna stick with my lock, dot and wand my way while I /cackle at people I see.
---
Super sweet ;)
---
They nerfed lasher farm in 2006 lol, this is not a classic nerf.
---
You need to be able to kite the zombies in ZF, if they touch you you're dead.
---
THIS!!!
---
No one ever goes LFG DM East and gets an invite for Deadmines.
---
Bats in EPL are good money
---
awesome ty
---
You missed the "for a living part." 
---
Random idiots streaming LFR raids, 1400 arena, and classic leveling aren't the same quality of players that have WoW as a job.
---
Horde, only level 41 Shadow Priest. Got bored of the grind and got 3 other alts sitting at level 20+. Just jumped back on my priest to continue the grind today. Gonna try n hit 43-44 tonight before I log.
---
Same, wore them until Devilsaur
---
Oh that’s it? Are they doing it in some way it’s considered an exploit?
---
It’s kinda part of the game. I wouldn’t play on pvp server if I didn’t make peace with that. Some times you kill some times you get killed.
---
Give it a week of farming DM nonstop and people will come back here whining for more content.
---
Weird
---
Addons solve this very nicely. I believe Inventorian is handling it for me.
---
What what? I'm holy priest how is that even possible? We can do enough dps for princess?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10455/chained-essence-of-eranikus#comments
---
It looks like there is more to the chain according to the comments, but they do not directly link. You lose it by the end.
---
My knowledge is worse than I thought then hahaha, would be really good a guide for dps players about tank’s abilities.
---
Damn fine!
---
My grandpa farmed mostly barley and hay in his late 50's. He's moved onto easier crops like lettuce and radishes lately, though. I guess it depends on your local climate and topography.
---
My first run of gnomer i got my priest that ugly spinning electro helmet. I used that up until like lvl 37 and got the chapeau from cath..
---
This comment didn’t age well. 😂
---
I'm 90% sure that thick hide doesn't stack with the multiplicative effect of dire bear form, so basically:
---
Increases armor by 10% either means that it goes from 400% (dire bear form) to 410% (useless)
---
Or that it goes from 400% (Dire Bear) to 440%.  Not useless, but also doesn't work out to much more than 1% or 2% at most of physical mitigation.  Compared to +15% threat in bear form?  Not even close.
---
It must be, because I found Cassandra’s Grace earlier at about lvl 45 also which is pre raid BiS for resto druids, that sold for about 150g.
---
You can be an advocate for free speech and still disagree with what someone says, the two aren't mutually exclusive. The same logic applies to pvp. Simplifying every statement about pvp into the same tired argument contributes nothing imo.
---
I am talking about dual wield. Eye of rend is better than mask for dual wield.
---
Your precious website is just straight up wrong
---
The mobs have SO trash pathing in classic, like you can literally 2 man Angerforge, go next to the wall and avoid the mobs if he calls them
---
The winterspring route gives you 4-5 nodes every 15 minutes or so, and the dm farm takes what, nearly 10 minutes and I think most classes need a healer to kill the last boss. So yeah, not seeing that massive impact. Definitely a great farm for those that can do it.
---
This one
---
I'll second this.
---
Healing as a feral druid means wearing cloth &amp; leather +int +spirit gear with +healing weapons. Even then, you'll need stacks of water. It gets tough in the 40s, as that's when you want the -0.5 sec faster heal talent, as that's when people start needing the bigger, but slower spells.
---
By level 50, you pretty much need the -0.5 sec faster heal talent if you want to heal dungeons.
---
Tanking as a feral druid means swapping to a high stamina weapon, and wear all the rest of your normal leveling gear.
---
Starting in the 40s, you'll start amassing more high stamina, high armor gear, to swap in while tanking, but you'll never need to wear all of those tank pieces until the late 50s.
---
Well those are more egregious and reasonings that are much more rare. OP actually mentioned the baby waking up and unexpected guests and silencing your phone for the run, which is what most of the response are regarding. That’s some serious dumb shit the OP was/is expecting and he had to renege on a lot of it because he realized his stance was that of an ignorant, no-life neckbeard.
---
Or did private servers get it wrong?
---
There were multiple things nerfed in DM over the course of classic. If you look at old wowhead comments people are complaining about a nerf to lashers in 1.10, so this is probably correct.
---
Dude that shit was hot fixed quick in vanilla. Everyone running around like the sky is falling is about get slapped by some vanilla reality.
---
If u healing u needing
---
sounds like you don’t use addons? download questie if you haven’t and use classicwow.live for leveling route, super efficient and helpful. Not questing while grinding is bad only for the reason a lot of quests past lvl 50 give reasonably good items you’ll probably hold onto for a while or forever. Also Quests give a lot more experience and gold. Not questing while grinding mobs is shooting yourself in the foot
---
I use heroic strike but I’m fury warrior and my main ability bloodthirst costs 30 rage so heroic strike being only 13 rage is much easier to spam and it does decent damage, although taking an auto attack means it really costs 13 plus whatever amount of rage you would normally generate with an auto attack.
---
The idea is it's better to have aggro on the highest priority targets than to spread yourself thin and have aggro on no targets. 
---
You can try to control everything, but your DPS isn't always going to cooperate. Some tanks go into a group with a chip on their shoulder and demand compliance. Don't attack anything until after I sunder everything twice. That could work if people will play along.
---
But my experience is, the most cooperation I can expect is for people to wait for me to LOS pull and follow a marked target priority order. As soon as those mobs touch me it's off to the races.
---
If DPS are focusing targets appropriate, skull should die pretty quicky and one of the DPS are going to have aggro on it.  If its a caster, that 1k damage shadow bolt is going to do the same damage it does to them as it does to me because armor doesn't mitigate spell damage. 
---
By focusing on securing threat on the 2 physical damage dealers, you're also enabling yourself to have resources to pick up additional targets. If you try to spread your threat out too early, you don't have aggro on anything, you're not getting hit, you're not getting rage, you don't have any resources to try to regain control of the fight. 
---
If you have strong DPS and you're pulling ~4 mobs at a time, sometimes its better to not compete for threat on skull to make sure you can hold aggro on the other 3 mobs. Because what happens when you try to compete for threat on skull is, you lose control of the rest and that's when your healer is taking it on the chin.
---
I'd like to see someone level a warrior without dying once
---
If they get rid of that I'll just stop playing.
---
Ulduar was easily the best raid they ever made.
---
The original comment may have been deleted, but the copypasta lives on!
---
Not true. Taunt doesn't affect threat on any enemy already attacking you regardless of threat state.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Kenco%27s_research_on_threat
---
Might as well hunker down somewhere in the woods, having a moralistic stance in a capitalist society.
---
Sure its minimally better alright, doenst hurt having the option of going both does it?
---
Not something you need to avoid turning in, but Kalaran Windblade, just south of Thorium Point, offers a chain of quests that gives you  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10515/torch-of-retribution](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10515/torch-of-retribution) which can be kept even after completing the quest.
---
There is a general standard. The color matches the spell/spell school.
---
I remember when i was a level 12 hunter
---
Oh no. 52% horde to 48% alliance. The world is literally ending! Sure some servers are more skewed than that but not the one I'm on! and not several others!
---
I hear lock a Spriest are pretty neck and neck.
---
Imagine the back problems on these guys.
---
yeah we should all be stunned and do nothing for 28 minutes. better yet we should all still be level 25 in hillsbrad dying to yetis because we’re wearing the gear that looks the coolest.
---
And then you made yourself permanently 100% Chameleon?
---
Has any mage successfully aoe grinded the dogs in DM north? Such as here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BLXMAHuUNI
---
My spells are ticking more than his but I'm having tons of trouble. Haven't been able to complete one try and have been going at it for hours trying to figure it out.
---
Are you looking for WoW specifically? If not go watch Sseth's Space Station 13 video. All his vids are great but the SS13 one scratches the storytelling itch.
---
https://youtu.be/URJ_qSXruW0
---
LMAO, not even Eve Online corps pull shit like this. Name and shame or make up a better story next time.
---
It's not that there are no tanks, it's more that tanks dont want to join pugs since tanking for pugs is an absolute nightmare for us. I'd rather just wait for my guildies to come online and spam dungeons rather than join some rinky dink pug of people who blame every mistake on the tank and never listen.
---
Zero have dropped off of around 9.
---
Saw someone mention that lasher farm was nerfed, anyone got the specifics?
---
This is exactly why I don't say "everyone" in the first place but I don't see people asking "please bring us server based on 1.12 patch but with BFA architecture and macro API and without raids which were released by 1.12 went live back then oh and please don't turn honor and battlegrounds on for a while, but release DM a bit early than you promise wait and drop your layering on top of everything allowing people abusing it for leveling and as cherry on top for dungeons boss reset kkthnxbye"
---
Is there a way to prove this is safe to use?
---
Yeah 41 is too low to tank ZF.  45-46 is a sweet spot for ZF where you aren't overleveled but are capable of doing it without crazy effort.  A  healer could do it at 44 or so.
---
ZF zombie farming for 50g an hour is still a thing so not the end of the world if Lashers did get nerfed, I'll just do my farming in an easier more boring place I guess.
---
Is there a way I can see how much mana my lifetap gives me while in combat?
---
Huh, interesting. I’ve never gotten another quest for the essence. TIL
---
Ah, makes sense. Thanks.
---
You're jobless, too, aren't you?
---
&gt;Calmly stating my opinion
---
&gt;First comment was rude, bitter, and sarcastic
---
Oh right, now is when you play up the victim complex. Carry on.
---
you can kill Rotgrip as well... you just need to kite him from the goblin to princess
---
That's plenty of zones, you'll be okay.
---
But you cant kill all that trash
---
In dungeons, shamans are perfectly fine as dps.
---
In raids, though, they're pretty bad as dps. The issue is mana, shaman rotations are just too mana intensive to be maintained for very long, and as a result, their dps suffers significantly compared to non-mana classes and classes that have better mana management.
---
A lot of raids are fine tanking an enh shaman as a pure support class, dropping improved weapon totems and wielding nightfall.
---
Ele, there's really no place for in raids.
---
All that being said, it's 2019 and Classic is a lot easier than Vanilla and there are plenty of casual raids who are fine taking suboptimal specs.
---
its a rage dump and while leveling you are not exactly in.. excess of rage.. so you don't have any real use for it.
---
The Roguelikes and Arpgs work with the hardcore ruleset because you are always only a couple hours at most to return to end game.
---
There were two of them that particular time actually. In more general terms the answer is 'because I suck'.
---
This is not correct. In dire bear form you have 506% of your base armor. That's the "white text" armor but at this point it's basically anything except armor kits. 
---
People are telling bears that Thick Hide is bad not because it doesn't stack but because dire bear form has plenty of armor already so you should try to increase threat instead.

---
Pretty fucking even imo
---
If you're just using it for the rage and you're using a fast oh, do you even need the 2h specialization talent?
---
I game a LOT but I also started like a week late and went on a two trip week after I hit 29. I could probably be 60 on 1 character if I grinded more but I am slowing down and focusing on professions and exploring because I don't want to leave my friend behind who plays way less than I do. I can't imagine 3 60s tho...
---
Blizzard should add blood elf, draini and their starting quest zones. Who else agrees?
---
I mean, they wouldn't die from one set of dots, the lock would get instantly killed by the party after the group fear wears off (if horde) and devilsaurs will be re-sheeped after 30 seconds. If it's an ally lock I guess the mages could spam sheep to combat the dot damage until lock runs out of mana.
---
Right, why should you spend money to heal yourself between pulls when I can spend mine?
---
No we didn’t. We saw lasher farming for a very brief period of time before it was hotfixed. We’re talking the majority of vanilla didn’t have effective lasher farming cause it was nerfed.
---
You just...don’t remember I guess.
---
As a Warlock, I approve of you keeping my tank alive.
---
You don't need to heal me -- bags of mana are running all around the place!
---
You wonder why I love Droodz. Sucks you guys get shafted on crushing blows and limited consumable utility while SS for end game. Still premier dungeon tanks IMO. 
---
Doing the Lord's work son.
---
I am so intrigued by the 10th double dal rends post. Thanks for contributing to this sub.
---
I have bern a horde player ever since I started. Back in WotLK I had a bloodelf pala and a troll hu ter. I miss playing paladin so I created a human. My question is: feom what level on can I tank (or what abalities do I need) and how steep is the learning curve?
---
I've had a handful of people tell me 58 - are you sure it's 60 req? :(
---
I get healed while eating 80% of the time. Pisses me off
---
would make more sense if they just didn't make any changes to it (assuming it wasn't like this back in the day) since this is classic after all
---
ARE YOU TELLING ME I ACTUALLY HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME NOW?
---
WTF BLIZZ I WANT MY $15 BACK
---
Nah man you do not need fade. Just out of curiosity do you use renew in your heal rotation? Because that is a good way to get threat.
---
Pass.
---
What is a scorpion? Some new subspecies of scorpids?
---
&gt;hour long interview
---
Apperently guilds actually do this. An interview. For WoW!! As if job interviews arent hard enough. How does this work? Do i have to suit up and prepare a resume? Will they ask questions like “where do you see yourself in 5 years?”
---
Amen. I joined a guild pre-release. Told all my friends where I play myself. Most didnt even start on my realm. Now they all come asking, because their friends stopped playing alltogether. Meanwhile I have ony and mc on farm.
---
it would still look more epic if it was blizzlike.
---
Whats your point?
---
You can also opt out of Ironman.  It isn't a locked or dead end progression.
---
Chillen boomer
---
the problem with locks is that a single round of dots is going to fucking kill me so i have to break fear with will of the forsaken and hope to god i can lock them down so i dont get coiled and then maybe we will both die.. otherwise im dead as fuck. no cloak of shadows so dotting classes wreck me as a rogue
---
Though I sympathize, I get where they're coming from.  I'm 58, I spent money on devilsaur set, I've just been questing, and I still have 380g to my name. When I hit 60 I expect roughly 50% completion, then farming the rest.
---
&gt;aren’t bugs
---
&gt;layering in dungeons
---
Someone is confused.
---
Literally you just gave an argument for why hunters should never get strikers, they can just craft the gun instead. Hilarious how stupid you are.
---
Also DM: trib to tell everyone you're going to deadmines to kill all members of the Defias tribe.
---
I feel the same way. I'll attack people my level trying to get some pvp going and if I win I'll ride off and find the next person to jump. Often I'll be in the middle of a fight and get ganked by someone I just killed who's out looking for revenge. It's good fun all around.
---
But a lot of the time when I lose, Alliance will camp me and /spit, teabag, spam cross-faction chats, etc.
---
I've levelled toons on both factions and I'll admit Horde ganks more but Alliance takes PvP personally and will camp you out of spite. People who are into PvP tend to roll Horde so they just see it as part of the game and are more likely to participate in it whereas Alliance players I've spoken to see it as a form of legitimised griefing.
---
What, you don't like relying on auto attack for the majority of your DPS?!
---
UD yes, rogues rarely.  Shadow priests and warlocks are the new UD rogues.
---
I just started stocking up on cheap leather and will roll a leather worker alt. Who needs a mount at 40 when I have improved aspect of the cheetah?
---
All of your listed reasons are perfectly valid for you to not play hardcore.
---
They are also the very same reason some players prefer softcore over hardcore when playing games like PoE or D3.
---
It's still not good reasons if enough people are genuinely interested in the idea. I'm not saying that I am. But people opting for playing with 1 life are perfectly aware of the consequences of doing so. Saying it's a bad idea is purely subjective.
---
monkaW boomer rage boiling over
---
This  macro completely does not work for me at all. Oh well.
---
Because I've actually played with them on priv servers maybe? Its a pretty known thing.
---
Take your ridalin zoomer.
---
Regrowth lasts longer.
---
Is a little salty Kromkrush horde or the golden rose bb alliance
---
What blue gun is there for 2g? Asking for not myself, a 35 hunter.
---
What a shit server, this is where alliance have devilosaur mafia there
---
the AQ warrior set is also pretty damn ugly
---
Fortunately, from about 52 onward, you can vanish into dungeons for the vast majority of leveling, and get your endgame gear at the same time. It ain't the same as a pve server, but it might reduce your frustration.
---
dumbass. No exploit needed to farm the king. its just youre bad and are mad because of it
---
Is there anything like a door that can be lock picked in Dire Maul? Like the door in scholo?
---
I've had Feet of the Lynx for almost 5 weeks now.
---
I need BGs to come out lol
---
I think these are the best answers
---
But Pepe is in the picture!
---
That’s a bit of an oxymoron. He didn’t know he was wrong, so how would he have known to not chime in? Are we only letting people comment here if they’ve passed the Bar Exam?
---
My real problem is the tone being taken here. How about an “actually, did you know...” instead of “you’re so stupid”. I totally get how it can be frustrating to see misinformation or a poorly justified opinion, but let’s try and lift people up, not bring them down.
---
And here I am, lvl 41, barely having time to play.
---
What does Tyr's Hand drop that makes farming there worth it?
---
Farming SM
---
&gt; How do you know you have the rage generation for 2H Slam?
---
If you have enough crit to maintain flurry, and enough hit to not miss, you can go 2h fury.  A slam build requires a lot more time and effort to do well compared to a dw build, but its a ton of fun.  I raided as 2h slam spec back in the day and loved it.  Plus it gave me priority on 2hs and since i love pvping, that was great.
---
Which is more a weird bug for Fury warriors where they queue and cancel it so they don’t accidentally dump rage.
---
Again, I refer you to Runescape, that is nowhere near typical roguelikes in terms of time spent to reach a so-called "end-game", and has a semi-popular Ironman mode.
---
To be honest. I skipped a birthday because of leveling. I was honest about it. "I'll see if I make it. Its the weekend after release, I might be compelled to play instead. Have been waiting a decade for that game."
---
They're all with in 10%, most within 5% of even. Not a single 70/30 pvp server to be seen.
---
I followed a leveling guide and made it to 60 in under 8 days /played. I would consider that a fast time and I only did 3 dungeons my entire time leveling. 
---
Also, half of your posts can be thrown out since you multibox. That's really not much more diff than playing one toon.
---
When I got Thrash Blade and Mirahs song I actually did that for a while and was smashing an arms warrior with the Nicker in dps in single target and aoe. I still had sword spec and 2 hand mastery, not sure if that holds up against actually good 2handers or 2h fury though.
---
It’s been discussed some 4-5 months prior to classic launch that people would be disappointed referencing pserver lasher farm videos because the elites weren’t positioned correctly and IIRC the patrols were different as well. For clarification, at least from Mage perspective, the farm is still doable.
---
Yeah there's a door that needs to be picked for tribute runs, it's why people will commonly ask for a rogue or someone with a key to open it.
---
It's available, a guildie has started it already.
---
Now I wanna reroll my priest just to do the same thing D;
---
Probably would if they weren't already so slow to level....
---
Same answers as when you posted this two hours ago!
---
Honestly though, nobody in their right mind is gonna willingly attack an spriest unless there's 3 of them they're 5+ levels higher or they're a warlock that's been railing coke off their keyboard for the past 16 hrs
---
Still not as bad as some neckbeard spreading rumors online without linking any evidence. Either link something credible when you shit your ooze or stfu.
---
&gt; Means that I change mt stance to #3 which is Berserker then automatically cast WW?
---
Yes, exactly.  Stance changes and abilities are on different GCDs so they go off simultaneously.  So as long as you have 5/5 Tactical Mastery and at least 25 rage, this will change your stance and WW.
---
&gt; One more questions what is "SS" after Charge?
---
Sweeping Strikes.  Sweeping Strikes makes each hit deal a similar hit to the mob's neighbor.  So since WW hits both targets, both of those hits hit the other guy.  You actually kill them both quite a bit faster than you'd kill a single mob.
---
You must cast Sweeping Strikes before the stance change because it requires battle stance and eats 30 rage.  So you charge, hit, kite, then when you agro a second, you start the pain.
---
Jesus - I keep coming back to it. God damn it's funny. :D
---
I guess i'd say it depends on server pop, what the core group wants, etc.
---
WoW has always had more casual guilds, or at least the 'in between' ones that have fairly decent raiders, but dont take the content too seriously.  If thats what a guild wants, they will loose players that want to be hardcore, but theres others that are still leveling/getting attuned/etc to backfill.
---
I'd say in Classic it could even be easier to accomplish that since losing a couple of geared people (at least right now in MC/Ony) wont gimp you *too* much and you'll still be able to clear the content and work on getting them gear.
---
Hell, with DM out now it gets even easier i'd say.  More catch-up gear and alternates to MC stuff.
---
Report them, they will get banned if they are abusing the LoS to kill people without interference.
---
&gt; lack of understanding of how patches work
---
completely your own fabrication
---
Heal the Tank only.
---
As a warlock, if you need to heal me, I'm doing it wrong. Same with any DPS. An occasional HOT is nice, but not expected or required.
---
&gt; A lot of DPS at 60 are impatient, rude, bad at their class, and in general do not understand tanking or healing mechanics in an advanced enough way at all.
---
but they think they're gods because they can top dps meters
---
That is what I am saying. +15% increased threat &gt; Increased armor.
---
Wait, not one but FOUR winterspring tigers?? Damn!
---
top that off with 14 AP = 1 dps for hunters and you end up with taking a melee's actual bis for .7 dps upgrade. If you take this or CHT over just getting barb blade/peacemaker with any ungeared melee (and with 15 melee in most MCs thats pretty much all of them) in your group, you're a piece of shit.
---
“they will be more likely to buy things” lol dude you just described demand and how it influences prices.
---
Its easy to spot the people who never played vanilla
---
Hard pass.
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/eiW3Dv3LUxomCMzQZ7VB5W
---
This is thrown together kinda quick, but it has 3% hit for pvp, and adds stam at 1ep and armor at 0.0065 to beefy you up a bit for combat.
---
For sanity, removed all epic items from the list.
---
Phase 2 is no new content (beyond DM), do DM:E jump runs with a tank of some kind and make sure one of your two are a miner, and split the mining.
---
I’m not about to risk my precious level 60 warrior for some extra buffs in a raid
---
That would explain why I keep getting charged by them in STV, even a couple levels lower than me. It has not ended well for any of them yet
---
And that brings me back to my original point....
---
That MOST ppl aren’t like that. Wasn’t very hard was it? :)
---
&gt; Why are APES videos literally the best wow videos ever.
---
I don't tap unless we're in a bad spot for this reason. Non dps has it hard enough without me making it harder
---
My warrior friend almost quit on us because we kept teasing him for his (lack of) tanking skills.
---
I had to pay him 30g to convince him to continue tanking for us one day after he raged and /gquit, which has become something of an inside joke between us now.
---
This is beside the fact that we all pitched in to help him buy his mount and basically picked classes so that all plate and tanking stuff would be funneled to him. He actually ended up admitting he preferred tanking for PUGS because they don't criticize every little thing he does wrong. I actually understand where he's coming from, no one wants to come home from a busy day of work just to get orders barked at them and constant criticism.
---
Ive had to tell the others in the group to knock it off with the bullshit, but at some point you gotta grow thick skin.
---
East (required for key) and then whatever.
---
As sad as I am to read that....I actually kinda agree lol. Looking through their forums they kinda have gone dark on things like bug fixes etc...And yes, they promised us a simple key ring and did not deliver. 
---
I also was killed over the course of 8 days by the same 2 people safespotting and I know myself and about 100 others reported the 2 individuals and you know what? They are still doing it as of yesterday :) Great job Blizzard.
---
I love the game, too. I resubbed for Classic (haven't played regularly since WotLK). But recently, I've been spending a lot of time in Retail, enjoying the smooth leveling. Not that I don't like Classic leveling, but the one thing they did improve with Cata was the journey through questing. No wondering where to go or which zone to be in. Now, they've leveled the zones, so you don't even have to worry about outleveling a zone if you're enjoying the zone story. And if you're not liking a zone, you can move on to the next without waiting to be a certain level. 
---
So, yeah, I guess that person that is on the verge of dropping Classic is me... :(
---
Wtf happened to no changes????
---
Yeah imho if I'm only running a dungeon for a staff that only has a 20 or 10% chance to drop why would I want to waste my time by inviting 2 other players who also want that staff and are going to roll against me? It just makes sense to get groups where everyone is hoping for a different drop. Seems way more time efficient for everyone in the group!
---
Yeah on launch week when we were dungeon spamming the DPS friends of mine were getting rediculous. Pulling for me, not waiting and getting Aggro, making fun of my tanking ability the entire time, it was horrible.
---
After the weekend they attempted pugs and now won’t do dungeons without me. Now I’m the dick to them when they’re being stupid or they can go find a pug tank (which would take hours and fail miserably). They want it to be a DPS theme park where they run in circles and explode stuff. It’s not. They’re lucky I don’t kick them at this point and get another mage :P
---
Warrior.
---
I started Tank, and swapped because no one knows that I need to build threat before they nuke..and it just got tiring.
---
I'll probably level a tankadin for my guild, but that's it.

just get to 60 people arent gonna be happy with taking some1 lower due to aggro range.

Please continue posting useless content that noone enjoys for free internet points.

But what if, now just hear me out on this, what if the DPS eats *while* the healer drinks?

As a lock: don't heal the lock. I don't need it. Keep the tank alive. If I die, I did it to myself. Throw an occasional HOT if you're bored and I'll kill a bit faster, but I should not *need* healing.
---
Eh I guess that makes sense. Been a while since I played any sort of market in a game, but a huge influx of gold causing inflation makes sense.
---
No they shouldnt unless theyre in your guild and agree to prioritize loot that way
---
Damn.  Thanks for info. I doubt I could be as efficient as you as a hunter :/
---
I would honestly have to saw the leggings from dm. I've seen all the others at one point or another (teebus pops up a decent amount when aq war effort hits with all the turn in rewards etc) but I've never once seen those pants.

---
While they should have a separate team for classic, my last hope is that they just moved people to the current retail patch project and will hopefully move them back but it's been a pretty pitiful 3 weeks after they were doing such a tremendous job with community relations and openness at launch. Really a disappointment, especially seeing how much success classic has had.
---
No they don’t.
---
By your logic all the warriors can roll on priest tier sets
---
What's the name of it?
---
I already ran zf a handful of times and got some levels. I know it's good exp but I dont really want to rely on group yet. I'm not even sure when I could spam brd because of my schedule
---
You pretty much have to be 60 to make it worthwhile to get all the coffers. For dark iron on the highway 3 of the spawns require killing the packs of 3 dogs. Hall of crafting dark iron has 3 nodes that can always be mined at 60 if they spawn, couple others depend on the levels of dwarves you get.
---
Warriors always try me (spriest).
---
Then they realize that spriests are powerful af against melee.
---
I was using this macro to swap between my one handed weapon + shield and my two handed weapon and it worked well:
---
/equip [noequipped:shields] Outlaw Sabre; Whirlwind Axe
---
/equip [noequipped:shields] Marbled Buckler
---
Now, after I trained dual wielding, the macro only swaps between my shield and my two handed weapon, leaving the main hand slot empty. Does anyone know a macro that would do the same thing the old macro did?
---
FWIW the Plaguelands have like 3 levels in them alone
---
I must have run DM 500+ times in vanilla to get that damn book. Grats!
---
I've got a Mage for ZF farming and in the middle of leveling a Rogue to do solo Coffer runs in BRD, got hundreds of coffer keys banked for it.
---
Had 2 friends start it up at the same time as me. One got level 10... The other made 2 level 20's and is also done. They didn't even bother renewing game time. Feelsbad
---
Side note: They have low attention span and switch games every few weeks which drives me nuts because I love to commit to a game and get good at it.
---
Twilight's Hammer is the most equal opportunity and diverse organization on Azeroth. Makes me wish I could get on that old gods faction.
---
I care :)
---
Its actually a sword. But same point.
---
&gt; I mark targets and nobody focus fires so I have to run around and taunt mobs off of people, yet sometimes I cannot even do that in the lvl 60 dungeons because a lot of mobs root you in place, and the DPS are not smart enough to bring the mobs to me when I am rooted.
---
It's like this for me too, but I've been tanking for over 10 years and this legit doesn't bother me any more. I see it as a challenge to myself to see if I can overcome their badness with my abilities.
---
I know for a fact that around 10 of them make a good enough living of twitch, and a few of those 10 make more money of twitch than most professionals do.  
---
What's to say that another 10-20 of them can't do their job from home? There's plently of jobs like that where you can earn money from home, for example a phone sales employee, video editing, consulting, customer service, data entry, event planner, maybe some could've been working for 10-15 years and has a spare room in their house they can rent. There's a bunch of ways to earn money, albeit not a lot, but enough to play WoW all day.  
---
*surely some them has got to be NEETs though.

Ouch ... that sucks man.

Yes people aren't lying.

Another quick way to get to get to Ratchet is to just swim south of Westfall.

Swim to Booty Bay and then take the ship to Ratchet.

Sure you can... Just cause the factions are united doesn't mean everyone inside gets a long.
---
Let guilds declare guild wars, let anyone who flags for PVP in open world PVP with anyone else.

Battlegrounds you just throw teams together like you already do.

I was wondering if the various types of herb nodes affect each other's spawning location/rate? For example, let's say I'm farming EPL and I come across several Arthas' Tears. Since they are fairly useless I skip them but now I'm not really seeing anything else. Is this confirmation bias or would I increase the rate of other spawns if I farm those Arthas' Tears?
---
Started with 2 and 2 fell off
---
One might get 60 in 2months but idk. Other straight up quit.
---
Firstly I was never comparing to UK average. Secondly I was being generous about my estimate.
---
Well since you're such an "adult" and everyone that calls you out on your nonsensical logic is a "child", I want you go ahead and explain how you think they can afford computers/internet/residences to be able to play WoW as hardcore as they do? 
---
Ill even help you out too: they're all adults so the "no responsibilities/live with parents" argument is already off the table.  
---
Curious to see what you come up with since i already know you have no idea what you're talking about.  I can tell you've never been successful or hardcore in any games before.  But ill respect a good attempt at a response regardless.
---
As a horde player, I enjoy this.

Skeram is heavily horde sided which makes it less interesting. This would be fun to mess around with.

Oh, man, last night I found my bear swipe would kick me to the top of the damage chart when my Rage was up over 50% and I could spam the attack. Keeping the mobs all at point-blank is awesome!
---
I'm a tank! I'm DPS! I'm **BOTH**! (as long as the hunter doesn't early pull before I've gotten my first swipes in)
---
Rogues &amp; Warriors get priority on Striker’s Mark because it’s literally worse than blues for hunters.
---
Well, at least you're living up to the Alliance's reputation with this crybaby post
---
That hurts
---
Typical rogue answer.
---
Its very simple. Don't talk about things that you don't know as if you're knowledgeable on the subject. If you don't know whether or not you're knowledgeable, you most likely are not.
---
Join the looking for group channel. Mostly people looking for dungeon groups but there are some looking for quests. /join lookingforgroup.

Horde seem to do a good job avoiding it as well.

Also, who cares.  A world first Thunderfury would be kind of neat, but still ... meh.
---
[This one, luckily no one values nature damage and PvE Heros / Alliance find it useless](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18289/barbed-thorn-necklace)
---
most people suck at tanking and/or refuse to learn it, so its obviously never going to be a nice experience for them.
---
With 1 hp i dont think it'd be possible
---
Each mob drops around 20 silver iirc
---
Classic is nothing like Vanilla simply due to the players and the information available. As good as things are right now it's just not the same as when we were all figuring things out as we went, being noobs together.
---
That said, Blizzard should be doing everything they can to accurately match Vanilla.
---
Might be misunderstanding but I always wait for the warrior to hit first. This isnt like I'm pulling aggro right after contact, I corruption +coa and pull aggro 10 seconds later. The only other level 60s (besides lock) I ever had in vanilla was a warrior and mage. From my experience as a both WARs I dont remember that happening in the past lol
---
Though, I think the guy who explained the nuke everything mentality by other players causing the tanks to scramble is the likely case.
---
Historically a lot of guild GMs were the tanks for all the reasons you listed. There's a lot of overlap in the administrative work of getting people working together.
---
This is one of the best videos I have seen or ever will see in my lifetime. Hilarious. Liked and subscribed &lt;3
---
Brutality is definitely best as an offhand if you have something like vis’kag
---
This is good in my opinion. The way DM on pservers was basically just a way to print money was pretty toxic. 
---
Economics sets the prices of things, so sure you can’t make as much gold as you thought would - but then neither can others. And prices will reflect that. Things you want to buy will be cheaper, and things you want to sell will sell for more.
---
Cold snap, nova, reset.
---
The rogue has now blown its load (prep, vanish, cold blood).
---
And you just got all of yours back.
---
What's a tribute run? Sorry, never ran DM before
---
nope so just delete this post, but gratz
---
LMFAO prolly need something stronger than that
---
Lmao all these cry babies in the comments not realizing this is satire.
---
You can still tank dungeons as Arms/Fury spec if you're a Warrior. Especially if you have decent dungeon/raid gear.
---
&gt; 30 SP on a wep will be BiS until mid-high 40s
---
what would you suggest replacing it with? That thing would be BiS all the way to 60 imo.
---
Stonetalon graveyard runs would like to have a word with you.
---
I like how your comment was written 2 minutes after that [tweet](https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1184127507735273472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1184127507735273472&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wowhead.com%2Fnews%3D295663%2Fclassic-dire-maul-will-release-in-all-regions-at-10am-pdt)
---
Sounds like you need to stop being obsessed with loot and join a guild that clears the content so you don't need to pug. But no guild is going to put up w a hunter who thinks they deserve striker's mark.
---
It's funny when people yell NOCHANGES just so they can play the game in a way that they did not play back in the day.  So essentially don't change the game so that they can experience something different from the original game.
---
It makes more sense to judge it by the performance of the majority of its players when determining its value in 5-man pug environments, which you know, was only the topic in this post. 
---
Obviously they have the capability to outperform other classes but that’s not interesting in this context.
---
I don't understand what are you asking me about. I know the blue post. What I wrote is literally the direct result of the blue post.
---
Its all perception bias.
---
 It feels like "we" are heavily outnumbered because we're off doing whatever when 7+ geared assholes decide to be assholes for an hour.
---
 It feels like the other guys are all assholes because "we" aren't going around being assholes but "we" keep running into assholes. I assure you while you are dealing with horde assholes there are alliance somewhere being assholes too.
---
Look at his gear. He’s not been farming MC since release. 
---
Don’t be a pleb.
---
You do realize that 30 stam is a marginal buff and shouldn't make a difference unless you're consistently getting hit down to 5-10% health? Otherwise its just a bigger number to get to full for the healer.
---
I'm glad I don't have to group with you either because you sound like the type that facepulls for the tank, doesn't wait for threat to build, and splits dps onto other targets.
---
Questing in the barrens as alliance is fun but bloody hard lol. The sheer amount of horde players looking to kick your head in the second you leave ratchet makes it a dangerous (and exciting!) experience :D
---
Lmao amazing copypasta material
---
I mean yeah if the support is there then go for it. They never though classic would even exist but the public support for it showed otherwise.  I was just saying why I cant imagine thered be enough public support for blizzard to actually implement this through the server when, if you wanted to play this way you could just kind of...do it yourself?
---
Why would you censor your pet's name?
---
Spy. I hope they break it
---
the quest reward Triprunner Dungarees is a must-have for hunters, feral, and rogues for at least 10 levels. +18 agil legs at level 30?
---
For most early 5 mans it wont matter, but its a bad habit you really dont want to develop early.
---
Afaik its the Spellshock Leggings, its a random drop of 45+ mobs in Zul'farrak. And there are only a handful of those in the dungeon, leading to a nigh impossible grind. They are extremely rare and definitely belong on the list.
---
Ah I'm blind, you already listed those
---
It always amaze me how many people can't seem to grasp that just because something is legal doesn't make it moral / ethical.
---
I'm also always a bit afraid of that. It seems that a large portion of humanity would completely disregard / actively harm others if there were no laws.
---
yea, you're full of shit.
---
&gt;  I'd be willing to bet most pservers used the pre-nerf lasher drops and that's what this is based off of. 
---
I think a lot of pservers were simply spitballing their loot tables. I got fucking rich off of Hillsbrad turtles on them, and they're a joke to farm in Classic.
---
Obtained at approx 12:26am, 26 minutes after DM went live! It dropped off the very first mob we killed in DME (Hydrospawn)
---
That gets released with phase 2 btw
---
You over estimate the vast majority of people in this game. I've ran into countless people while leveling that have never played WoW ever. Most players aren't on reddit reading every little thing that happens or can be done.
---
We aren't talking about how good the buff is in a vacuum.
---
We are talking about how good the buff is vs having the healer drink for 20s at the start of a dungeon.
---
If you think it isn't worth the healer drinking for 20s at the start of the dungeon, you are dumb and wrong. There just isn't any argument here.
---
When I was doing all the STV quests I didn't see any leveling alliance without a group of 3+ skulls
---
Nice humblebrag. Don't forget there are 100 other economonkies with the exact same plan.
---
Me and my friends who started together, also started a guild together with over 100 people have pretty much all taken a break.  The guild has since disintegrated with only 2 of the 9 IRL friends still playing.
---
Most of us are pretty sad about not having battlegrounds, so we might come back around then.
---
No worries, there are basically three wings in Dire Maul (Similar to Scarlet Monastery). North, East and West.
---
Then there's a special run called a 'tribute' run where you avoid killing the bosses, and lockpick/blast open a door (You can get a one-use key from a boss, but it's a much slower process), and when you get to the last boss he offers a tribute in the form of a chest.
---
The chest contains some of the best items from Dire Maul, so it's one of the more common runs.
---
Be friend with the tank, tell the dps that if they don't wait and cause wipes they'll get kicked
---
Do so if needed and find one of the hundred others dps available to replace them
---
The dungeon needed to finish the chain was released
---
I played since release because I preordered and everyone called it DM back in the day. If DM was followed by a :letter it meant Dire Maul.
---
as healer, i usually start pulling when the tank is taking another nap, which happens quite often with all those pussytanks
---
Rage is based on damage dealt. Period. Having HS queued doesn't increase the offhand damage. The rage amount per hit is the same. You would get more rage with this trick simply due to fewer misses.
---
A couple fell off, but my leveling homie did not and we just downed Rag last night in a guild that we basically started with a few other players who are IRL friends. The launch was really tough though because 4 of my close buddies didn't want to suffer the Faerlina ques. They're all going strong on a different server, however theyre just hitting 60. 
---
I think the best strategy is to lock in with one IRL friend and if that's all that works out, thats okay.
---
SM spamming doesn’t level you faster than questing.
---
Thanks for all the comments, leveling a tank right now, atm level 7. at what level should I start with RF?
---
Ever notice how on LoL/CSGO/DotA videos nobody comments "wow these nerds have no life, must be nice to be useless and have no job" or "who would do this after working 12 hours, did I mention I work 12 hours a day, isn't that great and respectable?".  Stay salty casuals.
---
I was in Stranglethorn Vale looking to trade some Green Hills of Stranglethorn pages when this happenend.
---
DPS and the tank should be setting up for the next pull while the healer is drinking.
---
Was about to go hardcore for a few days to get my epic :(
---
Try swapping the order of the two commands, it may be equipping the sword into your offhand and then replacing it with your shield.
---
the only one I ever saw was popped in my run and a hunter took it, so no, it doesn't exist and fuck that guy
---
Yeah, mana issues are the real problem of paladin tanks (that and being pretty squishy compared to the counterparts)
---
I killed 3 packs of lashers and got 1x Deeprock salt 2x heart of the wild 1x lasher root (17s) 1x golden sansam
---
Hah we're all replying to each other.  But yes this is my take as well, thick hide 5/5 might give you 1-3% of armor reduction (less benefit the more armor you have BTW) but +15% threat for 5 points is just way better.
---
All the people that i started with are still playing, also many old guildies from retail in TBC - Legion have come to join us.
---
A few of those guildies have quit but we have 25-35 people online every day in guild now, all old friends that have played together over the years.
---
Having tons of fun!
---
Ding dong you are wrong 
---
It’s not bis because +15 agi enchants don’t exist yet, 2hs beat this until then.
---
Pretty sure that whole server would be hunters, as we have one of the best ['Oh shit' buttons](https://youtu.be/F4jXpcPyOE8).
---
Go 31/5/15 or 31/20.  Not having MS makes the 27 points in arms a bit of a waste.  If you go 31 into arms and are more interested in tanking go 5/5 in parry and not 3/5 in 2h spec.  With 31/5/15 you can tank all the content in the game really if you know what you're doing.  With that spec make sure to get MS and Last stand.  Both are great for pvp.
---
The item with the lowest drop rate is always the item when you are trying to complete a set.
---
My guess is they were ignoring you previously, not because you whispered them there. Coincidence
---
I realised this too late when I told the guild leader I'm specced swiftmend so he assigned me as tank healer :P
---
But yea that's what I was doing on the way to 60: get feline swiftness, work up to nature's swiftness and then dump the rest into feral. Boom. Adequate tanking and healing
---
That is not what WE were arguing about at all, but good job trying to move the goalposts you inconsistent dweeb.
---
HOW DARE YOU TRY AND BUY THE THING I SELLING!
---
None of my friends have dropped it. The way it worked is pretty much none of us ever played WoW before, then one friend messaged our 3-person group chat to say we should all do Classic when it drops. His fiancee had played it back in the old days and she convinced him to play. Me and my other friend were curious but also kind of indifferent, and my fiancee didn't even want me to play it at all because she knows how easily I get sucked into games and WoW has a reputation.
---
On the first day the friend who wanted us to play with him was telling us about how cool the community was and how people were lining up in-game to kill quest mobs and stuff because there were so many of them, and that got me really interested. Then he said he'd gift me my first month subscription so I decided to just go for it and ended up loving it. It only took a short time to convince our other friend to try it out as well so I think it was less than a week after launch when we had Friend A, Friend A's fiancee (the only one of us who had ever played WoW before), Friend B, and myself playing regularly and we've all kept up since.
---
The real surprise though came when my fiancee decided she wanted to try it a couple weeks after I did and ended up having a lot of fun.
---
I'm really glad it worked out this way because I'm loving this game and I feel like a big part of that is being able to play it with all my favorite people.
---
Are there any addons that prevent the pop-up window "Looting this item will bind it to you"?
---
Movespeed boots and a weapon with fiery on it.  Get something you can equip at level 5 or lower and transfer between characters and thats an easy trip to level 15 or 20 at least.
---
It was and it wasn't fixed until BC I believe
---
My UD rogue is named Commissar......heresy BLAM!
---
Ironweaver
---
Does black lotus spawn in dire maul/outside dire maul in the arena? Also, does living essence drop off the lashers? is their drop rate nerfed?
---
I felt the same when I hit 40, then 50. I'm 60 now, just gotta keep the grind on. Personally I just spam dungeons, feels like more progress than questing and you get better gear.
---
Are you judging by the majority of the players though? Or are you just judging based on the sample you got in a PuG? Is that a reliable sample at all to judge from? Is there reason to believe that the majority of players are similar to the ones you had in your MC run?
---
Well noggenfogger is horde dominated server by like 7 to 3 or something. I am Allaiance and STV and Tanaris while I was leveling was beyond hell. It was impossible to survive. The hordes always outnumbered everywhere.
---
And only one warrior in the group? Feelsgoodman
---
It's satire bud  
---
you just lack a funny bone
---
Any idea what the 2 best swords are BiS pre raiding?
---
because the people that knew on our server for example told noone and have been selling the boe's with an army of level 1 alts.  i found out by mistake but did post about it in another thread to let ppl know
---
Haha that's awful.  10 years ago I saw it drop and no one could use it except for my warlock so I had it on like a 53 lock.  It was pretty funny
---
Each time you finish the tribute run, you can get the buffs. The buff(s?) only stack once from every lockout if that makes sense
---
If i remember correctly, only the hp buff stacks. Others don't.
---
What's so dangerous about spriest
---
It's a special type of run where you kill no bosses other than the final boss. You then get rewarded based on which other bosses are left alive.
---
Yes, did I say something wrong? My bad if i did idk why I got downvoted O.o
---
I honestly doubt it was much fun for them to do this.
---
There are videos from vanilla that show hunters farming it solo
---
No, this got nerfed in 2006, so this is not vanilla like.
---
So all priest run that spec then since it's optimal?
---
Is the new rank of mage water out?
---
Letting them die and kicking them out if they don't work with the team will get their attention to change if they can never finish a dungeon.
---
Since you are a bit of an idiot:
---
Look at the dire maul lashers on the classic wow database. Comments from June 2005 show that the lashers has been nerfed at some point prior to these comments. But for the sake of argument, let’s say it occurred with patch 1.5.1 which was released mid June. Proof:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?npc=13022#comments
---
Patch 1.3 released Dire Maul and came out in March 2005. Proof:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0
---
So worst case scenario, lashers were farmed for 3 months. And since they were fixed in a hot fix and not a patch, and thus we don’t know exactly when they were hot fixed, they could have been hotfixed within days or weeks of patch 1.3.0. We don’t know for certain, so for sake of argument we will say patch 1.5.1 was when they were needed.
---
That means for (at most) 3 months, lashers were farmable in a manner that was broken, or too good for gold/eco gains. Considering that TBC would not come out for 1 year 10 months from dire mauls release, lashers were only worth farming for 3/22 months for a measly 13% of the time. If you consider how long Vanilla was released for, this number falls even lower.
---
In other words: you are wrong.
---
I've been trying to farm the dogs of dm north for hours now and am convinced either I suck or its broken
---
The dogs just will not remain slowed
---
I undershot the level just to avoid arguments, technically a Hypnotic Blade from SM Lib would be better because you can get the same enchant on it.
---
I do agree it's completely viable to 60 unless you're rich af and like putting level 60 enchants on everything.
---
It depends on ghost mushroom prices I think
---
Ironforge is just one giant bunker though, should be ok.
---
Yeah, there are people that did it for the thrill of it. It's not quite the same if you're the only one playing by self-imposed rules though.
---
Having a hardcore ruleset server would drastically change how the economy works, and how people play as a whole.
---
3.3
---
You must be bad at math. And that’s ok!
---
Let me clarify my point for you:
---
50-100 gold per hour is greater than 10-20 gold per hour.
---
No just 1 priest running it is optimal. You know this embriel. Stop playing dumb.
---
Jesus that warrior just made a couple thousand gold or get QS, either is a amazing feeling.
---
Gratz!   
---
what's that top bar add on that lists loc, xp, gold, etc?
---
Out of the two of you, I find you to be the lame one.
---
I think he was looking for a trade, and may have thought you were trying to scam him.  He got it wrong.
---
Questie button and I think it's called the UI. Just click random boxes until it goes away.
---
How can anyone complete 5 unique instances in 1 hour? That's 12 mins per dungeon while also running between the next ones.
---
Never seen 4 frost sabres in one screenshot before.
---
Always undead mages.  I even had a level 51 one start a fight with me as i looked at him baffled then murdered him.
---
What is the minimum healing requirement for Dire Maul? 
---
I am currently a level 51 Shaman.
---
I had the same problem.  though my macro was simpler than yours.  It used to be 
---
/equip Ravager
---
/equip Blah Blah 1 Handed Sword
---
/equip Mighty Shield of Stuff
---
I fixed it by swapping the shield and the 1 handed sword.  Basically, equipping the shield first will fill the spot and the sword will go to your mainhand.  Try this.  
---
/equip Whirlwind Axe
---
/equip Marbled Buckler
---
/equip Outlaw Sabre
---
This is in DM North, forgot to specify.
---
New to healing, never played vanilla, i basically just use fast heal as at 3/4 health its pretty much full heals them, half health i do "Heal", i think i do shield then renew the mages/locks as they sometimes get hit once or twice and i figure an instant overtime heal is better than stopping to cast a fast heal on em while the tank is still taking damage. Most groups seem to say im a good healer but i do feel i aggro more than I should be.
---
Yep! I was in a group last night where I was marking targets and the rogue intentionally went for a different target each time and of course pulled aggro very time. When I reminded everyone to focus the skull, I got mocked, saying “imagine acting like this was a mythic”. The very next pulled we aggro’d extra mobs and nearly wiped. People are too lazy to do it properly and just want to rush through as fast as possible
---
Also if they blink away you can just swap to bear and charge right after their asses (assuming you roll the right talents)
---
Lvl 54 Druid attacked me while I was fighting a mob (I was 47 rogue) somehow I managed to turn the tides of the fight after popping evasion and blade flurry, he then attempted to do the usual Tauren Druid move. War stomp, heal, back in form, but I managed to get a kidney shot off at the same time as he war stomped. So he couldn’t heal, long story short we killed each other but it was the most satisfying corpse run I’ve ever made
---
Lashers are for sure nerfed and that's the same as what occured in Vanilla shortly after DMs release.
---
Black Lotus in DM is more of a rumor at this point than anything else.  You'll have to discover for yourself!
---
Complete with some casual homophobia. Cute!
---
posts proof that it was more than 3 days
---
calls me wrong
---
&gt;you are trying to be a ducking smart ass with your wow wiki facts
---
Not gonna lie, I actually laughed IRL reading this part.
---
Exactly. It is within your power to change the loot to allow the Raid Leader to take it, and then ninja loot BOE purples in Molten Core. You might get harassed by the GMs (you would in Vanilla, but the GMs seem much worse in Classic), but it's within your power. But not only is it an asshole move, it's *unethical*. 
---
The number of people who think that because they're playing on a PVP server, that it's in no way concerning if someone gets off on making other people have a bad time is ridiculous. 
---
Personally, I like PVP servers because of the risk, sure - but some of my favorite interactions are when I bump into a Horde player, and we help one another out, and go along our separate paths.
---
It's ok we will send wave after wave of bears to eat the snakes, problem solved.
---
Weren't threat meters invented for the Vael fight in BWL?
---
You actually reek of jealousy so badly. its overwhelming.  
---
"Everyone that doesnt have some miserable 80hrs/week wage slave job is on welfare"  
---
LMFAO.  Get out of here.
---
They assume stuff based on private servers
---
I disagree. I play healer priest and that’s why I do 98% of the time but I’m not interested in DPS gear I’m interested in healing gear. I advertise heals just like this guy advertised tank. You have to be able to role on the gear that helps you move forward. Just because I have been pulled in to finish a group and dps cant mean I can’t roll on the healing drops, I wouldn’t even go if that was true. When you see other people that use your same stuff at the beginning you have to expect everyone to role when stuff drops at the end. If fair warning is given it’s your responsibility to just say up front “given the group comp I’m out” or “hey I’m just running for the shield can I have if tat drops or are we rolling on it?” Not the guy who wons Fault
---
Well you didn't even make a good one.
---
This made me laugh harder than is should.
---
I’m not sure who to respond to in this chain, but PSA:
---
I frequently use the function keys to target party members for healing (they’re right above my heals, so why not?), and tapping the hunter’s button a second time targets the hunter’s pet.  So, if the hunter is F3, hit F3 again, and you can easily heal the pet.
---
I can generally see when the pet has picked up some agro, or I know from experience when the pet is taking aoe damage.  I keep everyone in my party alive, including pets.  Never know when that hunter pet will grab the agro off me.
---
((I’m prepared for the comments about the inefficiency of using function keys to target party members.  I like doing it that way.))
---
Yeah, they clearly don't give a fuck about the millions of Chinese players they saved from being banned from playing Blizzard games by upholding their rules against a single player. Good logic
---
Humorous?
---
I definitely agree with the fact that it would be a drastically different world.
---
I have it on my action bar but only for if I'm taking too much damage and want to slow down the enemy attack speed. Although right now I have the hand of antu'sul so I kinda have a free thunderclap chance on hit
---
&gt; have fun.
---
Thanks, I will!
---
That front foyer is always a fucking boneyard
---
Lashers no longer drop loot. Us priest will remain poor forever.
---
This works. Thank you.
---
&lt;fake post&gt; and Falsestalrius
---
👍alright then👍
---
loot doesn't change, map doesn't change. some bugs fixed (partciularly pathing &amp; terrain exploits), and trash packs re-tuned to reflect current balance difficulty (e.g. ??? showing as 60/61/62 elite). I expect some balance passes to UBRS too shortly (if not already).
---
It's not my fault you took some time to dedicate for me dude.
---
Thanks! I really appreciate it.
---
I still look down on NEETs because they are just lazy. You can blame it on anxiety, phobia, mental health, physical health, but in the end, it's laziness.
---
You can’t just go to the trainer and train this though right ?
---
We used to take off our pants for more rage. It was a fun guild joke, but actually very effective once you outgear content.

I'd really like to know where can I realistically farm 100g/h

Can someone explain this ability to me? I am a lvl 36 Pala and unsure when this spell would be useful.
---
Yeah that's fair.
---
Exactly.  
---
Some (working) Americans don't realize how much they are exploited by the shareholders.   On the other hand, I do think it's easier to get rich over there as a business owner.... it's just rougher, the highs are higher, but the lows are  much lower.
---
You definitely can if you don’t understand the game mechanics.
---
I still see priests that shield warriors on every pull.
---
You can most defiantly get banned for this. This is clearly exploiting and just cause it happened on TBC when the change occurred doesn’t mean it’s ok lol... thousands of people got a lengthy ban for doing almost the same thing in retail wow with the potions that give 10% exp and splitting the stacks up and drinking up to as many as you want. Almost exactly the same
---
again &gt;I&lt; never said it was active ALL THROUGH VANILLA either
---
so how can i possibly be wrong if you're trying to debunk something i didn't say
---
the ONLY thing i have said was that 3 days sounds wrong, and that THAT GUY needs to supply proof
---
you're the one jumping in to try and defend his position
---
Nice! 3 Dense stones!?!?
---
Due to a bug, they cannot. They can still hear the sound though.
---
I was hoping that I didn't have to say "the kind of demand you are talking about, wherein the need to immediately use the item is the sole reason for the purchase of said item", but it turns out that your ability to understand inference is as poor as your understanding of how inflation affects a market.
---
Yes, they are bad as DPS for raids.
---
No, they are awesome DPS and burst damage in PvP (not a top duelist class but a top tier overall pvp class as a 30/0/21 build). 
---
Sorta, they are mediocre for DPS in dungeons. 
---
By the way, they are awesome raid healers. 
---
Oh and you will probably be able to secure an invite as an elemental or enhancement shaman to a raid, but it will take more work. 
---
Should you roll a DPS shaman? You decide. Finding groups will be a little harder, but many groups will consider taking one as content isn’t particularly hard. You just won’t find groups as easily as a mage dps or resto shaman.

Wow
---
Very boring.
---
Insane duelists. Aoe fear, strong dot, tons of healing, mind flay to slow melee, bubble to prevent spell knock back. In a 1v1 they nearly always win if played correctly
---
Most of them live off welfare, which is easy to do in Europe.
---
I’m judging by the sample I’ve got in EVERY pug, not A pug. If hundreds of pugs are not indicative of the majority of players then I wonder what could possibly be :)

Yea by me being rude to the guy and calling him out, I honestly didn’t expect nothing more then some people to get mad that I called out a smart ass comment.
---
Unless you're looking for a OH as a rogue or DW warrior, unless you're tanking and a fast 1h is better for rage generation, unless you're a hunter just looking for a stat stick... wait
---
Even if you're deep prot you're better switching to defensive stance mid charge and shouting when you get there.  Clap is shit threat, partly because damage is low and partly because 80% threat modifier in battle and berserker
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure...
---
How can you be pretty sure of that, though?
---
One month ago, when [*the* WoWHead post that started everything](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community) was made, Anathema, Arcanite Reaper, Benediction, Deviate Delight (RPPVP), Faerlina, Grobbulus (RPPVP), Heartseeker and Netherwind all had a majority of Alliance characters, with Blaumeux being the only one that was exactly at 50/50, and the rest was Horde-dominated.
---
That's 9 servers that weren't dominated by the Horde, or 7 if we exclude RPPVP ones. Why would any of them (let alone all of them), except for Heartseeker now be Horde-dominated?
---
That goblin escort quest is neutral for the booty bay or whatever goblin faction hes in.  Alliance can do it too unless there is another escort quest idk about
---
Oh no, the typo wasn't why I laughed. I mean, sure, the typos were part of why it was funny since it shows you typed that up in a frenzy because you're *that* mad over something that doesn't affect you at all. But "being a smart ass with your wow wiki facts" is just a hilarious "insult".
---
battlegrounds probably would solve most of this problem.
---
they're fun because players are creating the challenge in opposition to eachother, honor farms take forever and the gearing/skill is different. 
---
dungeons can be spammed, and inevitable PvE content is exhausted...especially when the right items finally drop.
---
That's because tanking is shit.
---
If you don'T enjoy being the daddy of the group then don't tank. There's literally nothing enjoyable about doing a dps rotation just to deal 1/4 of the damage of a dps, or even less. There's nothing fun in running around trying to get aggro on mobs with your 100 threats autohits vs people with 500 threat shadowbolts - especially not when you can't press any of your buttons because you can only do that while you already have aggro.
---
Healers are acting sad when people don't appreciate them. Boo fucking hoo. Try being a tank. Yes, you get insta invites to every dungeon whenever you fucking desire. But inside the actual dungeon you're always expected to know every pull, every route, every shortcut, every everything. You're always expected to not overwhelm the healer while at the same time keeping the dps engaged so they don't get bored and start doing stupid pulls.
---
Tanking is not fun. Tanking is trimmed down dps'ing + pure frustration. If you don't 100% enjoying being in charge and dealing with fuckups, chaos and egofuckers: Don't tank before WotLk. From then on you'll still be the caretaker of every group, but at least the stupid threat system that expects everyone to hold their horses for 10 seconds (lol, as if any dps ever is gonna wait for a tank to apply 3 sunders to every mob in 2019) is gone by then.
---
Nobody is tanking because tanking is a shit job. Unless you're somehow turned on by all of that shit, you won't be tanking for more than a couple days (or you'll swap to 2h 'tanking' or some shit and just ignore threat altogether).
---
It's 30-50 gold per hour depending on how many pulls you do. 2 pulls and you're easily getting 40 g per hour
---
Everywhere but HK
---
Silence, fear bombs, a bubble that's virtually impossible to take down before it comes off cooldown, slows, high powered dot (bonus dot that heals if you are UD), that oh so glorious 15% melee damage reduction from shadowform which stacks with inner fire making it even harder to remove bubble, passive healing based off your damage with vamp embrace, and really only one hard casting attack that you can kite to interrupt
---
Do it. I played dps warrior as an alt back in vanilla and started classic a week ago as a warrior. I really had 0 tanking experience before and that is actually what I tell everyone before we start a dungeon.
---
I know it might change when I hit 60, but until now everyone has been very relaxed, understanding and even helpful.
---
&gt; I don’t think anyone gives two shits of what you think
---
Oh right. Updated my post, thanks.
---
Nah there is only one. Thanks for pointing it out. I mainly play horde.
---
Thinking outside the box. Good tip!
---
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
---
It's not really worth it as holy. Takes way too long to kill Princess plus half the gph was coming from rogues that you'd sell the ring to. But now the DM is out, the ring is going to drop in value.
---
Sorry didn't mean to like shit on you or anything, the artwork is incredible, just the horrors of war. You never really think about the NPC's and the countless families that have been destroyed ya know?
---
Agreed. I rather do dungeons a few times for quests and maybe some gear but rather quest and explore a zone and read the quests.
---
I'm with you, I want some proof that it's different.
---
You got a source for that?
---
Gotta love the white knights on Reddit loool
---
A lot of my group has lost steam, with one or two planning to not renew their subs because of the Hong Kong situation. As more and more time is needed for marginal gains in progression, a number of us are playing a lot less hardcore than before, and our group is dwindling in both numbers and excitement for the game.
---
Alliance should do it where Horde ports in to gnomergan
---
Well it could have been 3 days. It was a hotfixed, after all. We know it occurred within the span of 3 months but don’t know when it occurred.
---
The main point is that it was quick and the farming didn’t last long.
---
I always played horde before and we always called it Dm.
---
 NOw that i am alliance people chatting seems way to confused with it
---
God doing this quest as a frost mage was torture
---
The xp from the lashers was insane, which is why it was hotfixed so quickly back in the day.
---
Like the other poster said, it was only like that on live for a couple weeks at most. Really silly that private servers went with those pre-hotfix values and not the ones that were around for nearly two years.
---
Loot and xp changed.
---
Congratulations on that and your UI
---
I was always the nice guy rogue (and was more focused on getting 60 instead of honorless kills)  and tended to only get attacked when I was low health or way outnumbered .
---
I see 60s at this event every time and it’s really sad. They get nothing useful from that chest (even grand master trinket is worse than every other pre-bis trinket). Gave up contesting on my leveling alta at this point.
---
well I go one step further myself. I don't just decide it's not my problem I straight up tell the healer to stop healing dps. Let them die if they want to be dumb is usually my wording. They usually either starting whining in which case I kick them or they straighten up and act right. Replacing DPS for literally anything is a matter of 5 minutes. If you are going to tank you are going to have to be a dick at least until people stop being stupid.
---
&gt;they lack the darkest feral aspects of nature.
---
"There is no greater feeling than being caked in blood and gore after a fresh kill." -Druid of the Claw, Darkshore.

You also literally run around feeding raw meat to a bunch of Guardian Druids in bear form.
---
Bingo. It's like, do you focus on the numbers or on the lore/backstory. The Role Play pretend part of the game.
---
Sul'Thraze the Lasher comes to mind.  Created from two very low drop rate swords from ZF.  https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9372/sulthraze-the-lasher
---
Idk why ppl think it's a good idea to spend hundreds of gold a week to respec
---
Its 2019, use adblock already.
---
Patterns for the tailoring pre raid BiS spell power set. Ya look ugly as fuck but it’s good.
---
Maybe we have different experiences. Maybe your pug DPS and tanks are cream of the crop and mine and bottom of the barrel. 
---
Now, I want to emphasize this: **I 100% FULLY AGREE WITH YOU**
---
With that being said, that's never the case. Never, ever, ever the case for me. I'm *lucky* if a) it's the tank pulling and b) the dps waits for the tank to get aggro. Generally, it's the dps pulling, the tank trying to keep aggro, and me playing whack-a-mole with health bars at 15% mana. It's a good thing I'm an alchemist considering I'll drink more mana pots during a run that I will water. Again, just my experiences, though.
---
Oh and also that one hard cast comes out ridiculously fast and hits pretty damn hard so if they use mouse to turn GG on trying to make them lose LoS
---
Don't feel bad, he's exaggerating. The zombies drop ~20 copper each, and there are only 20 or so of them.
---
Hah I remember getting in trouble as a teen, my mom wondered what this "Allahkazam" website I kept going to was so she checked it out and blam there was a porn ad on the side bar. She comes knocking at my door like "are you looking at porn on the family PC?"
---
Good times...
---
This is pretty insignificant. 
---
Game has been out for 15 years, saying that you played the game in three different decades is just a way of trying to bring meaning when there is none. If the game had came out in 2001 and you had played it in two decades, but for the same amount of years, is that somehow less meaningful than three different decades but the same amount of years?
---
Does it include plaguebloom, dreamfoil, mountain silversage, icecaps, ghost mushroom, black lotus too?
---
I think people thought you meant he had just switched to DPS and *had the nerve* to roll on dps gear over someone who had been dps the whole time.
---
Simple misunderstanding
---
Nah man, Renew you can use on a tank mid boss fight but other that that I would avoid it unless your are dropping it in a DPS while on the run ( tip use a couple ranks below your highest rank as DPS don’t need to be healed quickly). Greater Heal and Heal are your bread and butter and you should be down ranking on both. Only use flash head in PVP and dire  situations it is the least mana efficient by far. Shield is great for PVP but you really want to avoid it in instances especially on Warriors as they will lose rage ( okay for Paladins) and course drop on yourself or DPS when needed. 
---
There is a difference between keeping everyone alive and keeping everyone alive without having to worry about threat or ooming - same goes for DPS.
---
I mean if the game physically will not allow you to do those things sure, but we are straying away from what people generally mean by "incorrect" or "wrong." It is generally not meant as "physically impossible."
---
Gurubashi Arena in Stranglethorn is an arena where any player can attack any other player. Regardless of faction. Every so often that chest spawns in the middle. Looting it enough times you can create a PvP trinket that absorbs damage.
---
While I'm not overly familiar with everything from Vanilla, to me it looks like he has an engineering item of some sort that can mind control a target temporarily. He uses this on the rogue to make the rogue attack the other player, while he goes and loots the chest before the other guy can realize what's going on.
---
I used my SM shield all the way to the UBRS shield.
---
Legit question, I mainly play healer. What do you mean "Setting up" for the next pull?
---
This is why I'm leveling my pally as holy and spending all my time in dungeons.
---
Ahh I see, yea I’m just more pointing something out rather then trying my best to insult people. 
---
Funny you put a whole twist saying I was in such a frenzy and I was was ‘that’ mad. I make typos all the time, it dose not depend on my mood. 
---
But from both your posts here you’ve exaggerated and even tried saying you laughed out loud.  Glad you try and make something out of nothing tho haha
---
It is reasonable. Two months is reasonable. I made it to 60 as a warrior in 3 weeks only grouping for dungeon quests on top of working 40+ hours between jobs. 
---
I don’t have kids so that does let me have more time. It’s not a top priority either. 
---
Just me smart with your time online like you would in your time in life. You don’t have to make it a second life either.
---
Plus, we'll run a dungeon until we have the gear we need from it and then never run it again.  A DPS, and to a lesser extent healer, will see the opportunity to run a dungeon they don't need to run as a way to break up the monotony of the day or a way to make a few gold and maybe land a rare BoE.
---
Um....we hate it. Tis the way it is though
---
I wanted to know if im lvl 19 or 29 whatever level bracket i want to choose. If i manage by some miracle to make it to rank 11 will the vendor have the same items if i was a level 60 or will the items be different. I think you explained it pretty good tho. I thought it was more of a season reward system and not a vendor thing. Thanks a ton for your response and if you have anything to add or link please do! Much appreciated
---
Bros rlly said world first lmfaooo
---
And the alliance on Kurinnaxx only pvp when they have a 2-person or 25-level advantage, in which case, they're insatiably bloodthirsty.
---
It's going to be really tough to level during P2.
---
I approve
---
Most messy runs I end up in it's like the dps and tanks have never heard of food. It's baffling to me since they *need* to then sit and wait for my mana often since they bleed me dry with everyone taking damage constantly, but they won't eat some damn mage food.
---
There were some hotfixes mixed in there too that the patch notes don't have.
---
Of all the sports meme, I'm so glad that Bryzgalov was the one to break the barrier.
---
by 1 life he means perma-death , not 1 hp
---
go kill the imps in burning steppes.  they dont give as much xp as a single regular mob either.  expecting a linked group of weaker mobs to each give full xp is dumb
---
Resto shamans can drop windfury fyi
---
Yea, that doesn’t work. Your healer won’t let the DPS die, so you’ll probably finish the pull with everyone completely OOM or dead.
---
Lol you have a small penis that doesn't work right.
---
Everyone in this game is so helpful, yesterday I was able to get all 3 escort quests in Darkshore done just by asking around. Not to mention everyone buffing each other when they pass by.
---
But you only rolled that class for free/reduced mounts? Happy for you anyway but yeah no one really cares about warlock/pally mounts.
---
They're currently only giving about 70xp per kill, which is significantly lower than non elites of a similar level elsewhere
---
In general, just let people know at the start that you will be rolling for a certain item so if they have issues they can leave or come to an agreement.
---
Otherwise, if you actively plan on using an item then rolling "need" isn't wrong. 
---
&gt;And how do rogues feel about that?
---
They don't like it, but it's something that's been happening since WoW came out.
---
That is merely stab-adjacent. You’re on the edge there, sir, be careful
---
Happened when I tried to do the quest this weekend. She just chilled there for hours until it reset somehow. Got it the next day.
---
In generally this quest is super buggy and tends to break a lot. But hey, it's only been 15 years, right?
---
Nobody every does "Dire Maul".
---
They do DM East, DM North, DM Tribute or DM West.
---
Also, Living Strat is dumb, its Scarlet Strat.
---
World first Classic? Cool. Thought we just had World of Warcraft back then.
---
Careful in there, I’ve heard It’s Tricky.
---
ClAsSiC wIlL bE eAsIeR
---
Not only that, it's actively detrimental. Two dps warriors in a group? No problem. Two prot warriors? The run is going to progress at a snails pace due to lack of dps. Same goes for raiding. You only need 2 prot warriors per raid really.
---
So i uninstalled ElvUi but i still have coordinates on my map and classcolored names in chat. How do i revert this? Ive already uninstalled ElvUi
---
A lot of it is that tanking requires a lot of soft skills that players may have to learn. DPS is pretty much entirely mechanical. Stand behind target, press 1 until x condition, press 2, avoid this mechanic. Tanks have to be leaders, know how to pull for the situation, set the pace, figure out timings, keep up with aggro and their party/raid, etc. A lot of people struggle with those soft skills because they pretty much come from experience.
---
I’m on a PvE server and I’m level 45 warr. Have only died 6 times, that should add some weight to your statement haha
---
&gt;Some people are babies.  
---
Sorry, are you referring to me?  I am not complaining about my corpse runs I am simply giving a reason why i try to initiate a fight instead of waiting for it to come to me.   
---
I dont mind the corpse runs
---
GOOD ONE DUDE
---
Ok
---
Nobody knows that. That one comment on wowhead (from thotbott) said nothing about grey farming, in a threat about XP nerfs.
---
I had one guy in my guild get 8g from a single lasher run. Another guy got next to nothing.
---
Who fucking knows? Not the people claiming they know, lol, that's for sure.
---
At least you won't need to add further content to the old game that way...  One wipe and everything ends xD wow Rouge like...  Sadistic fun server...
---
It doesn't just work baed off combat log. it does more
---
Yeah you're a rogue - if you are constantly getting opened on instead of doing the opening, then you gotta change things up man. Locks can be downed in 2 seconds with ambush vanish ambush cold blood evis combo.
---
It's a community event. This is not the same as a lvl 60 gamling lowbies in stv. Not even close.
---
Even if it was in vanilla, doesn't mean it's not a bug. Blizzard obviously didn't intend for you to be able to stack a 15% Stam buff.
---
The Divine intervention is literally a game breaking ability. That's the reason it has been removed from the game eventually, so that they don't have to design every single fight with DI in mind, as it can otherwise be used to exploit a bunch of interesting mechanics.
---
It completely removes the target from any combat interaction. It's not just that you're immune, you're also out of combat, untargetable, just fully "out", like you wouldn't be there at all. You can't do anything and nothing can be done to you.
---
Normally running away doesn't work as the boss would just follow you. This makes the boss forget you exist. For the price of 1 dead pally.
---
My group had one 22 minutes after it went live sorry bud.
---
Only 4 quests in silithus until phase 4/5, so unless it’s for grinding there isn’t much point going there.
---
Leveling my 3rd char now that the race is over and I decided let’s make a mage for the aoe Grinding. 
---
I’ve never met more people who will just be waiting off somewhere for you to pull 3-5 people and get your health/mana down before engaging. And running away as fast as they can if they find you attempting to open up on them. 
---
But what’s nice about now is I have a fast as hell computer compared to my potato I used to have. So I can log into my account again DCing my mage and log into my rogue who’s sitting on his mount in my area at all times. Sure level 40 hunter camp the 30 mage. See how that works out for you in the long run mwahahahah
---
Man I wish I had your experience. It's ALWAYS rogues. And they're 4+ levels higher. Then they spam laugh.
---
10??
---
The spec is not really relevant tho. An arms warrior can easily tank any dungeon. It’s a straight up refusal of said arms / fury warrior to do it.
---
for reasons a 6 year old kid could understand.
---
I have a copy saved in my main's bank lol
---
What about Tribute? Is that in East?
---
Play combat swords. And if you keep up with gear it won’t get too bad.
---
Not world first, also you forget classic was out 15 yrs ago, also nobody gives a damn
---
how can a warrior tank keep threat against rogues (without asking them to slow their roll, ideally)? i don't have a ton of experience but i can usually keep threat on most things, except the one mob a rogue is focusing on
---
man i had one guy in our guild for 6 months leading up to classic launch he would post how hyped he was to play classic EVERYDAY...
---
he lasted 1 week rofl... RIP
---
Don't use it?
---
Go on. Let all your projection out.
---
These fuckers literally make their own threads on blizzard forums, probably the same is for reddit.
---
I think they can afford the 22 coppers for the flash powder.
---
The game literally has a macro section? Whats the difference between making ingame macros and AHK/Razer macros?
---
Edit: apparently timing n whatnot
---
Was 2. Then 4 after upgrade wasn't it?
---
This addon is gigantic dude. I literally cannot surprise anyone as a rogue because i have to stealth BEFORE I even see them. Yes. I have to stealth BEFORE players get in 100 yards range and then very slowly stealth up to them. There's no element of surprise for rogues anymore, they are completely fucked.
---
Lower demand raid healer? What server and faction are you on? My guild is actively begging druids to join. We're lucky have a single druid in our MC clears.
---
How the fuck y'all organising this? I wish I saw this many people online in one place
---
From what I have seen from other threads this is how it worked until TBC
---
Phase 2 isn't a thing anymore it's DM portion and PvP portion (maybe). 
---
Additionally there is a form post where they specifically responded saying the key ring will be released with the first patch. We gave them the benifits of the doubt with hot fixes not counting as a patch but DM is definitely a patch.
---
And the real issue here is that blizzard has gone completely dark on the forums. They had excellent transparency the first few weeks of launch, discussed what known bugs were existing what they were targeting first etc etc. But have completely disappeared since the hunter "fix" 3 weeks ago.
---
Yeah, it's me trolling and saying "see they abandoned us" but people really don't see the issue here. It doesn't take much to make an update every week on current progress with bugs etc. It's been completely abandoned, that's a very bad sign. Even the DM patch was poorly communicated when it would actually be released.
---
People should be demanding communication and clarity because without it classic is going to start to suffer.
---
I came from tanking another mmo. The issue i have with tanking is aggro and mostly being required to know everything even if u are new. Aggro and tanking is so flawed in this game but i guess it has to be expected for a 2004 game. The tools you have to keep aggro are not that great when you compare to tanking in other mmos and if u lose aggro that's it, you are wiped. That's why nobody wants to play a tank. Also being pidgeon holed into playing warrior is not that attractive to me.
---
Must really hate the Timbermaw! I remember not knowing anything about this back in the day.
---
I literally did not know that 😬
---
Not me I just wish I didn't have the responsibilities that I do so I could play more WoW lol
---
It's just funny seeing people on their high horse because they have to work 40 hours a week to stay afloat in their mediocre lives pretending like they're doing anything noteworthy.
---
It’s not an exploit, but someone not wanting the economy completely fucked dosnt make them bad lol
---
The part where it clicks for you every 10 seconds.
---
No fucking keep it out of retail too, just get rid of it entirely.
---
Totally. Totally playing this class only to get a cheaper mount. For sure. 100%
---
I had no idea this was a thing. Leaving work in 7 minutes, will download and install.
---
Nobody cares lol you're basically getting it for free
---
WoRlD fIrSt WaS 15 YeArS aGo
---
Nobody forgot, bro. Calm down.
---
Classic wasnt out 15 years ago. World of Warcraft was. Classic has a lot of distinguished differences.
---
It's because the streamers were bored, nothing else.
---
Locks weren't this strong when WoW was released. 1.12 is basically one of their strongest states.
---
Meh, I doubt people will farm DM for long before they've got all the drops they need from there.
---
ie.: I'm not sure your "explanation" makes much sense.
---
IMO, they'd release HKs and BGs if they wanted to make sure people didn't get bored with the game.
---
Your video is bad
---
I started as a warrior. but I only made it to 30. Groups just... arent fun tanking for right now. Especially at that level when your kit and rage is pretty limited. DPS going wild just makes runs annoying. Add on the typical warrior annoyances when solo questing and I just want to set it aside entirely. I *might* roll a pally to play around on and maybe go prot for dungeons, but who knows. My desire has dropped pretty drastically after that.
---
and?
---
Blizzard is a company. Companies wants money. Is this post necessary?
---
the slugggish/really difficult part of leveling a rogue is from 1 to 30 , after level 30 its a breeze... so if you are level 20 and you found it easy so far you wont have any issue later on
---
combat sword/mace its the best spec to quest , it  doesnt rely on stealth but you do use it often especially when you get cheap shot (stealh opener) and to move around mobs in certain area (or avoid the enemy faction)
---
If I got 20 buffs of 15% more stamina and ran around soloing dungeons/raids blizz would 100% ban me.
---
Stealthing and being sneaky is a core part of being a rogue.  And pick pocketing stuff while you’re stealthed.  If you’re not interested in that aspect, you might like warrior better.  More armor and the ability to tank and lead the charge and all that.
---
Gnome locks/mages are all savages that will blast warriors without mercy
---
I was a tank back in classic. 
---
After a few months I stopped tanking dungeons and only was Raid Maintank. 
---
Dungeon Tanking in Vanilla / Classic was and is the worst possible thing I can imagine. I really hate it. 
---
It became far better, when you were finally able to make some AOE aggro later in BC/Wotlk, but until then it was horrible.
---
But in the end it sort of balances out, because inflated consumes means inflated mats which means more gold in the pocket of crafters and gatherers.
---
A company trying to keep their players happy? How dare they!
---
Stopping tanking at 60? I saw maybe 1 shield the entire time going from 1-60. I tanked every dungeon up to BRD as a shaman because I didn't want to wait. My policy at 60 is to not invite any dps warriors into my groups.
---
&gt;	but we are straying away from what people generally mean by “incorrect” or “wrong.”
---
No we aren’t. You are defining it that way to be needlessly pedantic.
---
As a warlock I don't really encounter any problems. Its really just a war of CC between us.
---
Not, but also I didnt say I paid much, its a quest chain.
---
Basically just when they have advantage lol.    It's pretty great.
---
On pservers certain classes can make 150g/hour in DM. Looking like that’s not gona be the case in classic tho
---
Really?
---
This is true.  I've ran the spec before, and frankly I hate it.  You do less damage in a raid and usually whatever you're tanking could have just as easily have been tanked in a 17/34 DW spec, and you lose the ability to stance dance in a dungeon so you have to pool more threat each fight and set a pace that allows you to not lose that threat.  It also takes a certain gear level to really make it work, and frankly, by the time I've got that level of gear I'd rather just tank in my 17/34 spec.  The loss of Defiance is mostly made up for by having Deep Wounds, Improved Overpower, and Impale since you're rolling around with 25% crit while still maintaining 5k HP and armor (without shield) by that point in the game.
---
Edit:  I do like 0/31/20 or variants of it in the two 20-man raids.  Those provide the right amount of needed threat with taking big enough hits to warrant the points in Prot.
---
Should be in game since it drops in Mc and was added in 1.12
---
That's like the 2nd highest priority for people that WANT to tank, just behind the first priority of lurching through pugs to get enough gear to do so.
---
Escaping pugs into the safety of guild runs is the goal to most tanks.
---
You’ve got ignorance all over your face
---
Its been on the horde side AH on stalag
---
&gt; Don’t bother making decisions of your main based on other people you might be playing with because you most likely won’t even be playing with them.
---
That's some very wise advice. All my friends decided to take the first week off of work and power through to 60 asap. Between that and timezone differences, I never play with them and barely even communicate with them. So, I up and switched guilds. If I wasn't so far along already, I'd even consider switching factions.
---
Ah I see what you’re saying.  Thanks for the explanation.
---
Does sound cool. I don't think I'd be interested unless it was a PvE server with boosted XP rates though... Or if the character just got a free transfer off when it died (but couldn't be played until transferred).
---
I really doubt anyone would clear many raids though... A single death could screw the raid team!
---
I dont belive vanilla was like this...
---
im on PVE and I still think its pathetic to do this.
---
Probably the happy medium is to reserve the 1st one and then round robin any others.
---
So I just hit 60 (yay!) and I'm looking to farm some gold.  I'm a gnome warlock, any recommendations of where to go or what to do?  Sac / Ruin build
---
Then send the proof ;)
---
But, there is another 60 levels worth of content when you play retail wow
---
Human warrior leveling with priest. Can confirm, will attack anyone I see.
---
im happy youre not in charge is all i can say
---
Tbh I've seen more hordies cry about getting ganked than alliance so idk what you mean but you do you.
---
32
---
I mean we're here.. it's just 4 corpse runs to get to any of the portals.. no different than going literally anywhere.
---
Rag was broken for a long ass time and there were other factors at play for that first raid. 7/8 BWL bosses died TWO days after BWL launched, Nef lived for 77 days because he was bugged, not because players were bad or couldn't figure shit out.
---
The Honor system hasn't even started yet, either re-roll now or be farmed.
---
Pre-drink a restorative potion
---
Damn all the douchebags coming out to spew toxic garbage out of their cock holsters on this post.
---
Orrrrr because they see all the pvp videos and wanna be like monkeynews and shit.
---
Quite a few people do actually from what I've seen, I remember like 2 weeks ago seeing a post of a random individual who grinded it out pretty much off the bat
---
What do you think they’ll be going for?
---
On my server this will pull an easy 1-2k. Though I’m on the highest pop server in classic.
---
What years did you play vanilla from?
---
Okay so you're fine with hunters rolling need on dal'rends?
---
Priests rolling on the spellpower leggings in lbrs?
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
But it’s true.. all it takes is a bit of gold and that’s it.
---
Ok my bad on the rifle as an alternative for melee.
---
Reason why it's not as good as striker's is because it's got a lower damage range.
---
And you're arguing in bad faith, nowhere did I say you have to "play like shit" it's just that it's not possible to play like how those simulations do it.
---
Yes this has been an issue for hunters forever.
---
try leveling as alliance on Herod.
---
As a warlock I can assure you, no one care. Congrats and all, but this was not worth a post.
---
Wait so have a caster melee with fiery until 20?
---
I don't miss my slow so I don't have to worry about it. If you think you are going to survive losing your target more than  once when we're talking caster I am not the one with the special needs in this convo. Why in the hell would I swap over to battle stance when I have imp intercept? The gains do not justify it unless I am an arms MS warrior which is not my jam bro.
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
TILL YOU DIE...
---
I'm glad i rolled an undead warrior. the only race that looks good in those god damn dinosaur shorts. AQ can't come soon enough.
---
Is there a PAWN addon? I was looking weeks ago, but couldn't find one.
---
It's not against ToS, opened ticket myself to check it and ofc the people who do the mafia opened tickets before they started this shit. Blizzard allows this.
---
Does it only drop in MC? I've heard it can drop in pickpocket boxes (the one that rogues can pickpocket at 250), is that true ?
---
I actually just got Death Coil last night, so that's good to know.
---
I think I need to respect once I hit 60 because I wanted to have fun with making my own talent choices while leveling but am pretty sure my tree is not even close to optimized for pvp haha.
---
Imagine imagining how to imagine.
---
Horde! I got made fun of pretty hard when I said “22 Hunter LFG DM.” I even remember where I was standing, near the tree between the inn and bank. Everyone was saying stuff to the effect of “22 can’t run Dire Maul, DUMMY”
---
A ton of the current DM iterations are NOT Blizzlike from live vanilla. Tribute changes, King runspeed, aggro radius and lasher packs just to name a few.
---
Why do you say not until 56+?
---
How are those two things mutually exclusive?
---
They still are. This is just one of many ways mages make gold.
---
you can stop following me around and starting an argument in every post I make thanks
---
Seriously people you need to understand... Blizzard haven't Nerfed this, like at all. This is how Dire Maul was back in Vanilla. 
---
The loot tables and routes came from people's experience in Private Servers. These Private Servers used Data that existed in the games code prior to being released in Vanilla. In other words Blizzard changed the routes/spawns/loot tables before they ever released Dire Maul to the public back in Vanilla.
---
What this means is that Blizzard haven't Nerfed the farm... Private Servers were using a buffed version we never got to see.
---
Edit: Granted Dire Maul was slightly better pre-patch 1.10 but since Classic is built on Patch 1.12 this is a moot point.
---
Naxx how does this make a difference tho?
---
That’s pretty expensive though, right? Compared to a free action potion?
---
Wheres your proof? You're assuming it's a world first when it's not.
---
You'd have to redesign the game to make it more fun. But you could play a game designed with this in mind already. Its called EVE and it sucks, but you can give it a shot haha. It consumed me for a few years. Im clean and sober now though haha.
---
the crafted gun's damage range is lower that's why you don't see hunters with it
---
Is that a wild Parrot Head I see?
---
The boats get so much criticism. Dude people shoot fireballs from there hands.
---
Depends on the child. Some take 3 hour naps on the regular. Some take 30min.
---
But if your child takes 3 hours everyday, it is normal to schedule around that. If they randomly decide to wake up after 1 hour today, you can’t really plan on that when it’s outside the norm.
---
Just think about how much stronger you’ll get as you learn.
---
So, real question, regarding exp, is it still good or doable?   
---
Im currently lvl 57 mage, specced for aoe, but the aoe zones are usually packed with horde all the time, can i knock out my last levels there are a decent rate? i was thinking of like 50k xp/hour or so, if not, anyone has any suggestions of where can i quickly get them off?
---
No, it means: Most Efficient Tactic Available. It fits here, being the most efficient tactic available...
---
This right here is why I am glad my frames show people who aren't 'there'. I wait until everyone is zoned in and clumped up before I start dropping group buffs. I think a lot of the players that have never had to group buff don't understand that the costs really add up on those buff reagents.
---
Raid leaders (and people without reagent raid costs) consider tossing your members that shoulder a buff alone or nearly alone a stack of their reagent sometimes. Also get your 6+ priests to coordinate and make sure one of them isn't bearing all the buff burden.
---
Depends. I had a bank alt that I'd mail all my full stacks to while leveling, and then before I logged out for the night I'd hop on the alt and list a few stacks of each item on the AH (depending on how flooded the market was for that item). If something didn't sell, it'd stay in the mailbox and I'd try again next cycle. If there was an item that never seemed to sell at AH, I'd either bank it for my guild's/alts' benefit, or vendor it if I had a huge surplus.
---
Auctioneer is great for this, really helps with quickly dumping your wares for a price that's likely to sell. You eventually learn how to finagle the bid/buyout prices for maximum visibility (and therefore, profit). It took me maybe 5-10 minutes to switch, empty the mailbox, and post auctions.
---
It takes 600g+ worth of mats and a long ass quest chain.
---
I looked yesterday and couldn't find one
---
What I did for my rogue alt was
---
Strength or agility wrist and gloves
---
Boots movement speed
---
Chest plus three or four
---
Back plus three agility
---
Weapons
---
Lvl one or lvl three dual wield fiery or you can do crusaders
---
Lvl nineteen get another set of fiery weapons cuz dps be slacking
---
lmao most of the mail gear you get from it will last till you're well into your 50's if you're melee.  Raging Berserker's Helm is OP as fuck.
---
You're not wrong there.
---
Content is easy, yes, but content is even easier for 60s than for 59s. I have no idea why anyone would ever choose to invite a 59 over a 60 with all other factors being equal.
---
i killed him once
---
Youre on reddit
---
So far i have been ice blocked and /spit on an number of times. Otherwise Alliance have left me alone.
---
The number of people who engage get a big starfire to the face run off 5 minutes later repeat multiple times. I mean comon dude 1+1 that druid isn't going anywhere anytime soon and you cant out damage the hots.
---
There's a door just after Slip'Kik which requires the key that drops from Mol'Dar.
---
You have to use a skeleton key (blacksmithing) or powerful seaforium charge (engineering) or 300 lockpicking Rogue to open it otherwise.
---
Opening charge means I get a hamstring and a bleed on your ass right at the start, which is crucial against all horde rogue races if they don’t have a luffa equipped.
---
Yep! Downloading this the second I get home.
---
😥

---
Hello all! What's the highest level can a pet hunter get in classic wow? 60?
---
I doubt the china blizzard controversy helped either.
---
Oh no no no..
---
Thanks, I didn't know this. Do you have a source ? Not that I don't believe you but I'd like to cross infos and maybe read more about that.
---
So if Ive got it right, it will only show this warning if you've already spotted the player and they've since gone stealth in your "field of view" as it were?
---
True but it’s a three second stun as well.
---
You don't need to be prot for dungeons lol
---
Fucking glorious. Just absolutely glorious.
---
My frend was saying, there will be two servers from now on.  Layered servers, and non layered servers.  You can pick which one you want to play on when the announcement comes, but if you transfer to a non layered server you are there for good.
---
Half of those mats are re-useable and can be shared with other locks... and 600g is nothing
---
How is this an accomplishment? Why does this warrant its own post
---
And calling it server/world first is just disgusting
---
Yup! Found it in the Curse client, but they don’t have AskMrRobot or SimC so ya have to make your own strings. I’ve got priority figured out, but wanted to set weights to streamline it
---
Thing is the majority of people didn't know about it, as the internet grew so did access to knowledge. By the time Wrath came around it was somewhat common knowledge among the higher end players.
---
all of them.  now im stuck on arcanite reaper.  fucking sucks
---
There are a ton of videos on youtube that go into great detail
---
So many great comments from all sides - not just tanks but healers and DPS's too. I also wonder how much of it is caused by the fact that a lot of Classic players were there for vanilla, which means we're now 15 years older, usually have jobs and families and other duties, and we just want to play to relax and recharge after a stressful day. Which, obviously, doesn't work well with how stressful tanking can be. That is, at least, my case - I used to maintank in a hardcore raiding guild for several years, had to quit WOW in general due to burning out and not having time anymore ... and now I play just to chill.
---
Air and earth took me like 6hours for 10 of both in northwest silithus!
---
Solo princess runs are a good place to start
---
There's a presentation by blizzard kn youtube where they explain how they got all the old stuff back. For values, they had a database for 1.12, which was the earliest they had intact, and the reason why we got 1.12
---
I think you are misunderstanding something. 
---
One thing you are right about is that it's not worth going above 308ish, I'd say, but that's irrelevant, because this is the only item pumping the weap skill up on to a level to compete with orcs/humans. With this item you won't be going above - you would be at precisely 307 skill.
---
Caring about world firsts as a kid when wow first came out: ok, that's fine
---
Caring about world firsts as a grown adult that plays 10 hour a day: yikes
---
Is dm up then?!  I haven’t been playing for a week.
---
GRAVEDIGGERS!
---
t. Not a mage or hunter
---
Did your therapist cancel?
---
Yeah, but Classic is doing fine.
---
Not really. Let's say you hate Marksman spec but it's top dps. If you want to be top dps you have to play Marksman, doesn't mean you can't hate it.
---
Repost..
---
why do you continue to argue that the leaf is a 50% droprate when you know full well that's only one part of the bow?
---
You've yet to present any convincing evidence or calculations to prove what I'm saying wrong so honestly who knows less about the game?
---
Rogue already have a ton of hit from talents so missing that 1% hit in favour of 22 ap and the 0.4% crit is most likely dps neutral. Warriors on the other hand will only realistically miss the 22 AP and gain a little bit of crit from the blackcrow agi.
---
Whereas the evidence provided shows that the striker's can be up to a 40 dps increase over the carapace (more realistically 20 or less). You're going to tell me that 1% hit for a rogue or 22 ap for a warrior is going to be more than that?
---
Not everyone can join a guild and commit to a schedule, that's neither here nor there in this discussion
---
What? They can work while they are sleeping?
---
yeah I got some thoughts but I don't wanna get modded
---
Depends on the caster but, generally cast spells melee when they reach you.
---
You can do skinning knife and fiery for about 6dps but, the proc is 40 damage and crits for 60 at 6ppm.
---
That will drastically reduce downtime and Mana usage.  At 10 wands will probably start to overtake it especially as a priest.
---
The reason being is if you roll another alt you can reuse the weapon or AH it.
---
The other budget heirloom is cloth boots with minor speed.
---
No alliance on shazzrah?
---
Rogues are people who:
---
- pull the entire room, then stealth and have all mobs aggro you just to piss you off
---
- while you are clearing tye area, they jump on the quest mob, decline your invitation, then stealth away
---
- generally are fucktards
---
&gt;Where should I go from here to gear up? Blackrock Spires, Scholo, Strat? Which of those can I handle?
---
All of them, you'll be fine at 59 to tank any of the endgame dungeon bosses.
---
I've had level 57/58 druids tank in Scholo/Strath, as long as people don't try to pull aggro immediately, it goes just fine.
---
Not an exploit silly poo
---
It's quite lively on my server, so I am everything but sad. :)
---
&gt; I said the amount of work and dedication they are putting into something they enjoy is respectable.
---
I don't think "enjoy" is the right word when it comes to addiction.
---
Sounds like your realm just sucks
---
The sound of them slamming their face on their keyboard as they try to race up the dps meters drowns out the noise of the bear attack.
---
Vanilla died over a decade ago. Classic seems to be doing just fine, though.
---
Holy Shock is a real nice addition to a Prot Paladin's Kit since it has a 20 yard range compared to Judgement's 5. Also for 5 mans most of the time you are the only paladin and having BoW up is more important than Sanc unless you are 1. Aoe pulling entire rooms (which would require some awesome gear all around). or 2. You want to drink before every other pull.
---
god you cant even do math right,  if every 1st was posted that is all the sub would have,
---
This thread is seriously making me want to reroll warrior and tank again. 
---
I told myself not to do it, was a MT warrior for 6 years - getting aggro on everything from RFC to IC. Just sit back, I don't have that kinda time. Now I'm a 40 lock, facemelting and draintanking my way through quests, rarely running dungeons at all, where I lived in them in vanilla.
---
There's always a plethora of alts being made. Never too late to start WoW.
---
[Phial of Scrying.](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7667/talvashs-phial-of-scrying) I'm surprised how few people seem to know about it. You can make a bowl of water anywhere, on a table, in the AH, in a raid. Wherever you want. It has 5 charges, you need to abandon the quest to get a new one.
---
You forgot the "THIS IS NERFED BECAUZE PSERVERZ"
---
It's really unfortunate to play an spriest on alliance with WOTF and Shamans on the other side lol
---
Did I just....yep I did.
---
He says DM:E which means East :)
---
&gt;Is he able to effectively heal end game dungeons and raids?
---
Yeah, druids benefit the most from downgrading spells as well.
---
&gt;Does he struggle with anything else than lack of regular rez? I not familiar with classic end game so I would like to know if there are any dungeons that resto simply cant heal.
---
Not really, as long as you have decent gear you'll be fine even in MC/Ony
---
Crusader recipe farm if it drops in under 2 hours.
---
I've seen it happen in 15 minutes
---
I only plant flowers.   
---
\-Tauren Herbalist
---
What I read... not sure if it was fixed or not.  Maybe someone can confirm.
---
Tons of people, it doesn't take very long to farm.
---
0/10 low effort troll go back to retails subreddit
---
Reckoning was sort of a similar thing. Something that’s not really a bug, but more of an oversight. Going the extra mile after you identify something as exploitable to actually exploit it for your gain is the bannable action.
---
this is what we call bait gentlemen
---
Agreed. Classic is hopping. I have no issues finding groups for dungeons. (Am only 50 currently)
---
I’ve made the long and arduous journey from Orgrimmar to hillsbrad twice so far in classic only to have it made abundantly clear to me that horde are not welcome in hillsbrad and been sent packing back home. I get ganked once or twice a level in STV but with hillsbrad there were 4+ alliance standing watch over Tarren mill murdering anything that stepped outside.
---
1.13*
---
Currently a 32 Human Warrior on Herod. Can confirm this
---
Ret aura because seems like a aura I will be using most of the time while leveling and vindication because I didnt really know what to put the remaining points in.
---
Server restart is first tomorrow :p (well, in 4 hours)
---
Whats the best zone to farm thorium? Haven't been having much luck in Silithus, Burning Steppes, or Winterspring.
---
If he was using Whirlwind then he had to be in Berserker Stance to do so.  He might have been spending too much time in that stance and taking too much damage because of it.
---
For what it's worth, I can 1h/shield an instance while being in Defensive Stance 90% of the time and still have 70%+ of my damage as melee damage.  Sunder Armor does no damage and since it is the main ability to use your Rage on, you won't do damage with much else but your white hits.
---
We need to make that shit compatible.
---
Except mages are the only ones who can do BRD / ZF. As a priest i was looking forward to being able to solo farm for once.
---
Track beasts lol
---
Sounds like you're on a dead server. There's a ton of people doing SM on mine.
---
same on Golemagg. but they told me Golemagg is a horde realm :/
---
Or Kirtonos.. I swear its 3-to-1 for Horde
---
Just stop being so mad, this guy gets to play wow for money while you cry on reddit about how uncool he is, you're making yourself look a right twat.
---
Oh
---
Hi, /u/Qirej
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/diefcg/jump_runs_working/). 
---
it was only fixed in TBC
---
It's a big zone but generally the quests have a relatively smooth progression further south as you go up in level. Nothing really sends you all around the zone at once.
---
This guy knows......the struggle is real.
---
60 is the maximum level for your pet and your character.
---
Well, this data is not very reliable. For example drop rates from websites are obtained by users running specific addon and uploading its data. It's trivial to modify that data before uploading, so it could result with thunderfury dropping from Hogger. Some absurd data probably will be fixed by admins, but innocent looking data won't be fixed and you have no idea how much faked data was uploaded.
---
Second source is changes. Vanilla changed a lot and those websites have accumulated changed, not 1.12. So you can't take those values as a reference ones, they are averaged over full vanilla.
---
lmao how do u update your addons?
---
Rogues are not that fragile, they can handle one or two mobs beating on them for a bit, especially on normal dungeon packs. If it becomes too much, they can pop evasion or vanish and reset threat. Ideally if you're playing with good rogues, you should never worry about them.
---
i meant this strictly in pvp im sorry if i confused you.
---
I'm running the exact same thing but I still get odd whispers when I post "LFG Tank / Heals".
---
Imo I think most of the Classic playerbase has been brainwashed into thinking only 1 thing can be possible for each class and any other thing that is not Meta is trash.
---
I get stealth opened from druids way more than rogues
---
Lol you’re already preparing to just say nah.
---
It’s not a new discovery that physical activity promotes Long term positive health effects.
---
Get out of here with your fear ward ya rat bastards :P
---
I'm a druid. The entire party gets 1 rez, then we all walk back as punishment.
---
You'd think that, but I had people call me a ninja for needing hypnotic blade as a rogue because they wanted it as a mage.
---
North has the easiest entrance (it's right off the start basically), alternatively you can get there through the west easily as well, bit further in.
---
Awesome! Thanks mate.. :)
---
You have to pull him on the way back from the cave. Not going to the cave.
---
Regarding your edit. So it wasn't nerfed. It's probably the same as it was in vanilla. it's just different from how it was on private servers.
---
Thanks, ur post gives me some hope :-)
---
This video ended up being way more entertaining than I thought it would be!
---
Was not expecting the reply storm lol
---
Commenting doesn't take any effort, it doesn't mean someone cares. Nobody on here cares. Sorry you thought everyone would clap and cheer for your so called achievement but its meaningless.
---
I downvoted you!!! So mad rn
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn
---
It works for classic now!    
---
You can build your own strings with just a spreadsheet and your own priorities, really PAWN is just a quick comparison tool to help you look at one item vs another.
---
Is it dead? Perhaps you are on a low pop server. My medium pop server is quite lively durring the day. Try Anathema US West
---
lol, you actually need 10 guild sigs to open a guild. 
---
i know of atleast 2 on my realm (Missus being one of them)
---
Meanwhile in Alliance Barrens Chat:
---
".....so how about that chuck Norris fellow?"
---
You're missing Imp Righteous Fury. How are you maintaining threat?
---
IIRC
---
&gt;/equipslot 16 \[MH or 2H item name\]  
---
/equipslot 17 \[OH item name\]
---
From there you can fit it as you like, but keep in mind that you will need to wait 30s to use skull after you equip it.
---
e.g:  I use some macros to equip a dagger on MH when I use Stealth or when I cast Ambush, if I use Garrote instead, I equip my highest damage sword before casting it. Something like:  
---
&gt;/equipslot 16 \[noequipped:Dagger X\] Dagger X  
---
/cast Stealth
---
/cast Pickpocket  
---
/cast Ambush
---
&gt;/equipslot 16 \[noequipped:Sword X\] Sword X  
---
/cast Garrote
---
/startattack  
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
I can't confirm the syntax right now, but you got the idea
---
APES again. Big Yawn.
---
current favourite tanking macro to silence those pesky dps who won't give you time to go and get a couple of sunders in. Mash the button a few times in quick succession to change to battle stance, charge and return to defensive stance.
---
/dismount
---
/use [nocombat,nomod,nostance:1] Battle Stance
---
/use Charge
---
/use [nostance:2] Defensive Stance
---
Considering that before the PoP expansion an enchanter's job was to cast c2 on all the casters and haste on all the melee and tash the boss mob at the beginning of the fight it actually sounds like a downright exhilarating fight by EQ standards.
---
Yep, luckily I have a mage friend so I nearly always have a hundred water in my bags before I start dungeons, but I can easily pop through 70 water in a long dungeon if I'm playing for 'speed' and not to conserve my water.
---
If you're rolling without mage food and buy the 'best' mana food possible, that's enriched manna biscuit at 54s per 5. Some quick math means that if I have to do the micro-drinking route with a group on expensive 'water' (which I would never do) I'm dropping nearly 8 gold there.
---
Morning Glory Dew, the lvl 45 water (equivalent to the mage water we have before dire maul) is 36s per 5. If I micro drink/chug that at the rate needed for a group that won't ever let me drink to full I'm looking at spending 5g on that run.
---
Neither of those take into account repair costs and buffing reagent costs.
---
If you don't have a mage in the group, respect the healer's drinking time and don't make them waste water on your selfishness and impatience.
---
Not too late, and if you are looking for a lower pop server, look for the non-layered servers (they have a single layer and therefore are the lower population server). Or you can join some of the higher pop servers to ensure a strong community.
---
Sapper rushes get kinda old actually.
---
well lads you know what they say, cry and you win - im starting the quest now :)
---
Opened at 10 est today
---
Kromcrush if the ping is ok.  People on still at those hours and it’s a good overall server.
---
That 52 copper though.
---
Glad I'm on a low pop server, I don't see how any of this shit is fun. World pvp is for shitters. Bring on TBC.
---
somoene already tried selling it for 500 
---
in my opinion it could sell for 1500 early on
---
I don’t know about specific stats, but I believe Zygor shows you a flat +/- % comparison for gear.
---
You can do whatever you want. What im saying is that your level doesn’t necessarily determine your output. With 99% of pre raid BiS available before 60, gear is a much bigger factor. Theres a reason why twinks are able to kill players who are a much higher level.
---
It's a group of unemployed neckbeards, this is the only joy they have.
---
And why do you think it's changed? Because it's not like that on privates?
---
We are all 45+. I have 1 1/2 levels left and our other friends are slowly grinding 60 before P2. We will dungeon grind whoever doesnt make it before P2 so that we dont deal with the WPVP.
---
once he hearths, boot him. fuck them. Dungeon can be ran with 4 people, or any other dps within 5 minutes walk will glady join with a LF1m DPS and GTG message
---
Multiboxing is a lot slower, especially if its a PvP server.
---
As others have said, it is never too late. I just started my Horde Alt last weekend. May even decide to switch, the community on the new server is a bit better for me.
---
Well then it seems it may only be your interest in the game that has died and thats ok. We as people have evolving interests. Things that we enjoyed one day, in time, become less interesting. Fortunately we live in a day and age that we have many more options when it comes to entertainment. I would suggest trying out some other games and perhaps in time you will find a new desire to pick up wow classic once again
---
Horde got wiped and layered away.
---
As a third party, he didn’t fabricate jack. You’re just being difficult.
---
This is sarcasm yes? 
---
Cant tell anymore because lately people have been complimenting some real messy uis lately
---
Probably because pallys start shit with everyone within 100 yards haha
---
Wait, is it dead?
---
I actually hope they slightly tweak content to make it harder honestly. I wouldn't have minded if they did that with MC and Ony.
---
Id say its even less recommended on PvE servers, not very often Ally lowbies are available to kill
---
Chance for crusader enchant pattern
---
Join a guild.
---
Because, in a guild, you get your leaf, then you get sinew looted to you that week from Ony. It is literally that easy. It does drop that often. Its literally so easy to get. 
---
I guess in a pug you have a bit worse odds, but its still 2 40% drop rates. Better than one shitty drop rate.
---
"You've yet to present any convincing evidence or calculations to prove what I'm saying wrong so honestly who knows less about the game?"
---
I did, but you decided my evidence wasn't adequate because you aren't good enough at the game for your best in slot to actually be best in slot, according to you.  You haven't provided any evidence to prove this point, though.
---
"Rogue already have a ton of hit from talents so missing that 1% hit in favour of 22 ap and the 0.4% crit is most likely dps neutral. Warriors on the other hand will only realistically miss the 22 AP and gain a little bit of crit from the blackcrow agi."
---
I am not following your argument for rogues. What bow are you thinking they get 22 AP and 0.4% crit from again? You do realize that rogues will take the points out of hit and put it into better talents, right? You don't just get to say "rogues don't need hit, they get it from talents". You get 3 hit from a scope for crying out loud. Hunters don't suffer from the dual wield miss penalty, so they always need hit less than melee classes, who have a 24%+ chance to miss. But why would I argue with someone who is clueless about melee mechanics? You barely know your own class, we both know you don't know shit about melee DPS, so this discussion is pretty pointless. Its just going to be me telling you its a bigger DPS increase for the melee, and you disagreeing because your stubborn.
---
You can't interrupt the bosses in DM east (mana drain, sacrifice etc.) not sure if its intended. Was working on multiple privates
---
edit: unlucky sacrifice on your priest and u wipe.
---
Unless they are....
---
Any idea what the 30sp enchant costs on yours? I know it varies by server just wondering. I have a 39 lock and wondering if I should dump money into that.
---
Nah boi, they didn't get me. Im am still way under lvl60 derpin arround not gettin trolled by any APES bois. Lol
---
What are your gfx settings?
---
Does this make it not possible?
---
When you are criticizing someone you are inherently assuming a superiority. You wouldn't be calling them out for something if you were doing it too. "Holier than thou" generally just means they think you are wrong and stubborn about it. I wasn't saying you were being super pretentious or anything. 
---
I notice that the defenders of ganking are pretty stubborn about blurring the distinction between ROTFLStomping and fights. Blizzard doesn't treat all world pvp the same. Honor is awarded for winning fights not for camping lowbies. Stealing the basketball is an accepted part of the game. It's not griefing. 
---
Are you owning your behavior when you deploy such camouflage? It seems to me these inevitable posts accusing complainers of being crybabies are a defense mechanism. That's why I said that gankers are insecure and are doing it from a need to reinforce their own positive self images.
---
Talking duels or BGs or World? Be tough saying their best at world pvp. That I would give to hunters or rogues.
---
Classic WoW was blizzard's answer to people complaining about the amount of nolifing needed to play everquest at a high level. Even raiding was mostly grinding trash mobs. And long ass boss fights were basically because the boss had absurd hp, but was pretty much tank and spank.  Nothing was instanced so  every boss was a world spawn and typically took a week between spawns unless the server crashes.  Also since nothing was instanced there was nothing to stop you from bringing 200 people to 1 boss fight, a boss that still took 2 hours to kill and dropped 2 pieces of loot.
---
...but it’s dead
---
The solution is to do your due diligence as a god damn feral Druid and get your triprunner dungarees asap. There is no reason you should be skipping this quest those legs last you all the way into the 50’s.
---
Throw and Shoot are both abilities that have a 0.5 sec cast time. There is no advantage to using one over the other except for equipped stats such as agi on a bow. It doesnt matter if he is a warrior or a rogue its the same abilities and cast times
---
Ur mum
---
I got kicked from a Mara princess run last night when the group decided to fight rotgrip and every last one of the dumb motherfuckers drowned then asked why no heals. 
---
The 48 rogue (who won the Black stone ring ofc) messaged me about an hour later bc he checked the combat log which confirmed what I told them all that they are stupid and drowned. He didn’t speak up when they were roasting me in general tho lol
---
It happens, sometimes people want an all-60 run because it's faster, because 60's are seen to have more experience and because it's assumed that most 60's have likely completed all the annoying little quests that involve clearing out areas no one wants to visit. 
---
But I've taken level 58 Fury/Arms tanks to Scholo/Strath/UBRS/LBRS and it's been perfectly fine, as long as you let people know that you're new to a certain area they'll usually be more than happy to provide advice on how to do certain sections.
---
Idk, I love my small sadistic gnome warlock. There is nothing like doting the shit ouf of someone, fearing them and draining their soul while spamming laugh the entire time.
---
Iirc you can transfer pvp -&gt; pve but not the other way around
---
https://discord.gg/JT6ZYNd
---
This early on, you can easily get 1-2k. Those impatient top tier raiders have the gold waiting, especially those streamers getting fed gold. Easy gold farm.
---
Where can I get a home based job that actually doesn’t require me to do any work lol
---
Just change layer. Done.
---
Worst try ever, you even mention that you play on a server thats full. That is a lot of players.
---
Sounds like you literally did exactly that, except instead of kidnapping devilsaurs, you just kept killing them.  Same result in the end.
---
And the rare time you didn't get a devilsaur, you griefed people.  Congrats on earning bonus asshole points.
---
I would pay 500 for it right now. Pagle Alliance  message me :)
---
Yea, Alliance warriors are super cocky and chicken dance around you all the time. Like dude, I'm a warlock with 120+ spell damage in level 40s...you don't want any of this.  
---
This one guy just kept on so I destroyed him in seconds. I felt bad but don't be stupid.
---
It’s entirely possible.
---
No way this soon. It’ll even out to this without a doubt, but will take a while.
---
Have you joined looking for group channel, because its popping, sm runs everywhere
---
I think i ran SM with non-guild runs about 10+ times, all from LFG channel. I'm still constantly seeing people in there and groups forming. my guild is about to form our second MC group. I wouldn't say dead.
---
leeway’s in the game for a reason. you want clunky and laggy players to take advantage of melee players? we’d literally never touch any range class if this was the case. Everyone knows Tauren’s leeway range is greater because of their massive size. If there wasn’t leeway, melee classes would feel terrible and any type of lag coming from players would be severely noticeable. Trust me the game is better with it than without it.
---
You can still get 7-8 packs per run, you can't just do them all in 1 pull any more. It's not as broken as everyone is claiming, they're just upset they can't hop on and do it exactly as someone on youtube showed them
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Well this sub apparently isn't
---
Going sanc aura is better. I use sanc when I'm dps in dungeons or when questing and use devotion when healing dungeons
---
His name Krol Blade Paulson
---
&gt;Saddens me that vanilla is a fuckin dead as fuck fuckin game already. Didn’t last long hey blizz
---
Vanilla lasted 15+ years, what the hell are you talking about?
---
&gt;I just can’t believe I only saw one scarlet monastery group going between 30-42 and that took about three weeks.
---
Maybe what you see isn't everything.
---
&gt;Just cringing at it dying so quickly despite the hype.
---
Keep cringing.
---
Ouch. This guy said if he gets to 100 he's deleting his character heh.
---
That math doesn't work. You can't sign someone's guild charter if you're already in a guild. That would only work for one guild, then that character that stays in can no longer sign the others, and so on.
---
Show and tell time Billy.
---
As more adopt GuildMaster.io it will become more trustworthy no doubt about that. It just takes time and people to take the leap and try new thing.
---
Hello, i have Thorns Rank 3.  
---
It gives 9 damage to enemies that hits me, if i improve it by 75% with the Improved Thorns talents, how much more damage will it do? My math skill is very bad =(
---
TRIFLING GNOME!
---
Makes it pretty hard. We couldn't do it as two men. Had to bring a mage with us and we are almost bis priest+fury prot for p1
---
&gt; Because, in a guild
---
I think you see what's wrong here.
---
&gt; but its still 2 40% drop rates.
---
Sinew isn't a 40% drop rate. Even if it was you'd have to compete with other hunters on it as well as the leaf. It's not as easy to get as you think.
---
&gt; I did, but you decided my evidence wasn't adequate because you aren't good enough at the game for your best in slot to actually be best in slot, according to you. You haven't provided any evidence to prove this point, though.
---
Your evidence consisted of "because some people said so". 
---
&gt; I am not following your argument for rogues. What bow are you thinking they get 22 AP and 0.4% crit from again?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18680/ancient-bone-bow
---
&gt; You get 3 hit from a scope for crying out loud.
---
Not ingame atm.
---
&gt; so they always need hit less than melee classes, who have a 24%+ chance to miss.
---
game is balanced with this in mind, rogues and warriors do more dmg than hunters even with this handicap
---
Fuck off to the heartstone sub thnx
---
Another tip for other Rogues, if the enemy has pockets pickpocket them. Not only is it printing money pretty much, but it lets the tank get aggro. The mob can be in combat and still be pickpocketed.
---
low quality bait
---
well all 3.
---
Not sure where all these disproportionate examples are coming from... but part of being a hypocrite is being outspoken about your supposed beliefs. If I went around saying that I wouldn't support Blizzard for what they did concerning China and then played WoW, you'd be right.
---
Friends?
---
Tribute runs aren’t really working either.
---
I prefer sunder to Heroic Strike.
---
Oh I thought the library and the kill target were in separate wings
---
My rogue is parked in BRD the last few days, sub spec doing nothing but farming, no groups or dungeonst. I figure its best to grind out 1500 gold or so and then go back combat and stay there. The respec cost is just stupid though and kills the game for me.
---
Do /who monastery
---
On horde this will be more than the screen can display on any server I would think and for most on alliance.
---
And what led you to this conclusion?
---
Heroic Strike, like Maul from Druids, is there as a rage dump when you have lots &amp; want to generate more threat/dps
---
Love the anti rogue hunting parties that form
---
tbf i'm playing on ru localization, and the translation is so inconsistent, thats why i wanted to ask r/classicwow. In ru loc i reads: "increases the chance to hit by 1%", which is weird when i'm not missing, also golemagg is literally called mage-lord from clan gordock and Warlock t2 8set bonus reads: "Lowers your damage from shadow spells by 20%"
---
I’m sorry I think you mixed up best and worst 😜
---
I had 2 real life friends starting, 1 hasn't made it out of the teens but he was the one who made us roll on a pve server that i now really regret and will probably be rerolling, the other is in the 30s. 
---
For myself my pve character is in the low 50s now and i'm losing interest due to wanting to be on a pvp realm i'll still get him to 60 but i've lost the drive i had and the pve server seems much more guild orientated but with my schedule i prefer to run pugs and don't really have any serious goals, my new pvp character is low 20s.
---
check if warlocks or spriests actually play in 39 bracket, could be extremely valuable when bgs come out
---
Yeah it's pretty much what I do, I leave HS running until it almost hits then cancel it if my rage is too low.
---
I only do it on bosses or hard to farm mobs, not bothering on pushovers and trash.
---
This! People think they are winning while they are losing their time.
---
Hunters also still have the 0.5 cast time built into their autoshoot. That's why if you move while the animation is still going itll still say "interrupted"
---
Lvl 39?  I have a 60 hour a week job, dog, girlfriend and I maintain them all while I am a lvl 60 rogue with 10 pieces of pre raid bis.  What’s your excuse?
---
Aye that would've been great but by the time I realized the mistake it was already too late. Yes hindsight is 20/20 but I am hopeful there can be a fix. Honestly if I had researched more at the start and planned out my route leveling, this wouldn't be a problem at all. Maybe this post can save others from experiencing the problem as well.
---
I dont like it but on pieces where there isnt actualky an accessible mail piece thats at least as good, I understand and its fine. Something like dalrends mh -- where its the only preraid item of that quality that isnt going to cost you 300+, and its by far your most important piece -- annoys me quite a bit, but it doesnt sound like what youre talking about ( by the same token id never roll against a hunter for the xbow from lbrs). If i lost cadaverous chest to a hunter id be disappointed, but its as good for him as it is for me; I probably jyst wont do scholo with a hunter, though, so its fine.
---
I did though, you just ignored them. You can find them in our thread, and throughout this entire post when addressing the minority of haters such as yourself.
---
K.
---
And that proves it's nonsense... how?
---
The boat probably clipped your ghost?
---
:/ I wonder if you can ground the sacrifice with a shammy.
---
Myself (Shaman) and my bro (Fury War) gonna give this a shot in a couple hours, I'll report back if we are successful.  If you dont hear back, assume we died painful deaths.
---
Not even that... good luck finding tanks for Vael.
---
A stopcasting macro in is in general pretty good for HS/Cleave for those times you accidentally trigger it when you dont want to.
---
Yeah, plus I'm playing at 200ms latency right now cause I'm at work playing with mobile data. I'd imagine it's less difficult under 100 ms, but their pathing/slow doesn't look as consistent as footage from Private Servers.
---
If you equip it you'll likely use it all the way up until you get into endgame dungeons. But, the increase over the replacement isn't all that big. 
---
Meanwhile, for 39 twink warlocks/shadow priests that item *is* their endgame. That's why it sells for so much.
---
Sell it.
---
There were transfers in vanilla towards the end.
---
Yup! I guess my question is how much value to put on each stat to keep it accurate
---
Lv 50 warrior here. Been leveling as standard arms axe spec to MS then fury, tanking a lot along the way. Every intention to go full tank at endgame. For these last 10 levels, I really want to adjust my build to improve life in dungeons while still having the ability to do things outside of them. I'm sure I'll be living inside BRD soon, and I'm on a PVE server so there's no concern about PVP survival.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LAMxdVVo0kcZxfzox
---
Points of note:
---
Ditching points in the bleed stuff. In my leveling experience so far, the damage has felt really poor for the 6-8 point investment. Now I can fill out parry chance which is of course mitigation, but still a damage increase from swing resets, and thus also a threat increase in dungeons. This also means leftover points to dump into HS, which frankly is the only remaining thing of any use.
---
I'm not entirely sure whether 6 defense skill or 6% armor is better. I guessed armor, but these points are interchangeable.
---
At the end I chose 5/5 in threat and 3/5 in crit, instead of the reverse, simply because I intend to mostly be tanking. Crit is always great, but I think I would rather have another 6% guaranteed threat in dungeons vs 2% crit chance. Again, probably interchangeable
---
Just posted elsewhere in this thread about this but ya lol while it may not be a contract between lock and pet, the wow void and the dnd abyss are basically the same thing. Old gods are waaaay more chaotic evil than lawful evil. Plus if sargeras isn’t lawful evil idk what is...that would make the legion and what we call in wow “demons” more like devils from hell, which are lawful evil
---
Oh okay now I understand I was thinking they would keep respawning
---
 **&lt;The Tail** **End&gt; | North America | Alliance | Pagle (PvE) | Semi-core Raiding** 
---
At The Tail End, we raid at the tail end of the week.  
---
We are currently hosting joint-guild PuGs. We've cleared MC through Golemagg, and downed Onyxia.  
---
**Who Are We?** A Semi-Hardcore raiding guild. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW. We currently have \~50 members (20 of them raiders), with 10-25 on at a time depending on time of day. Mostly 55+, with a dozen 60s and a some 40s.  
---
**Guild Culture:** We help each other out, getting gear and attunements and class quests done for each other, and we chat in Discord and /g. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not casual either. Camaraderie is more important than loot. Joking and joviality is encouraged, including NSFW humor. But toxicity is not tolerated. No culture war stuff either.  
---
**Class Needs:** We need a couple of everything except hunters and MTs, and we’ll take anyone who’s chill and friendly. We are in particular need of rogues and priests. We expect to have enough people for guild-only runs by early Nov.  
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**  
---
DKP  
---
🔷 **Discord** at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)  or contact RASPUTINA in game. 🔷
---
May be it's because leveling dungeons are so easy. I think that retail leveling dungeons actually are harder than Classic ones. I'm level 42 tank, I've grouped with plenty of bad DPS who don't focus skull, who AoE things when I don't have enough threat and so on. But I never really wiped because of that, mobs are very weak and any DPS which got aggro can tank it without issues. I have no idea if level 60 dungeons are step up, but as it stands now, those leveling dungeons don't teach people how to properly play and don't punish them for mistakes. I bet, you can finish them with 5 DPS shamans.
---
2 Man DME jump runs (warrior/priest) are not possible with preraid BiS, adding a paladin to the mix didn't help. The 2nd boss Zevrim Thornhoof has an ability called sacrifice, on pvt servers you could interupt it with good timing, but this is not possible in classic. So you possibly need a pet class to 3 man him. 3-4 people is needed for what 2 people could do before, and even then it could be hard without raid tier gear. Also, it seems like the dusty tomes are rarer than I anticipated, and have yet to find a single one in my 5 different attempts at DME.  Alzzin the Wildshaper seems tankier than I remember, but it could just be faulty memory (needs some investigation). All in all, it makes it harder for warriors to make money.
---
As a 60 rogue how much + weapon skill should I aim for for pve? And is weapon skill useful in PvP or pve situations where enemies are the same lvl?
---
Hi, just tried this several times in game and it just switch to Berserker stance witout charging at all.
---
Asked the same question on a french forum and they gived me this one, seems to work, I tried it this evening :
---
. #showtooltip  
---
 /startattack  
---
 /use \[stance:2/3,nocombat\] Battle stance  
---
 /use \[stance:1,nocombat\] Charge  
---
 /use \[stance:1/3,combat\] Berserker stance
---
What level are you?  What level are the mobs?
---
If the level difference is greater than 5...There's your answer...Working as designed!
---
Mageweave is actually 80 silver per stack if you change them all into bandages. 80 silver from vendor.
---
People keep forgetting? I think you keep forgetting that nobody forgot...
---
For real, what happened to the allies in Krom? I see less and less every day
---
all of my irl friends are still playing - they're complete noobs to wow, and are only around level 45 at the moment. they're in a different server to me, though
---
Yep
---
Yeah, imma leather worker, gotta use my shit
---
The burden of proof is on you, not on me. And it was multiple comments, so it’s not unsubstantiated unless you honestly believe back in 2005 several people got together, predicted the release of classic, and plotted to create this conspiracy.
---
My proof is it was hotfix thy could have deployed ANYTIME after 1.3. Your proof is...your gut feeling.
---
First time I tanked that instance a mage beat me on a need roll.
---
That's great but again you are missing the point of what we are discussing, we are talking about getting the jump on people not being jumped.  If you are trying to get the jump on someone you switch to battle stance and charge.  Then you have rage for an instant hamstring and rend.  
---
lol why the fuck would you intentionally start off ganking somebody, if you have the jump on them, with intercept???  There is no good reason to use intercept over charge if you are trying to gank someone.
---
charge can only activate out of combat ?
---
I'm new to the game having kind of a hard time solo levelling my 41 NElf hunter outside of dungeons. However I just got Staff of Jordan (my first epic) of a random STV dinosaur. Would selling it make sense for me? How much gold can I even expect to get? Is the AH value gonna rise with time? I don't wanna make dumb moves cause I looked it up and the Staff itself seems very valueable.
---
1st level 60, 1st level 60 mage (+any class) 1st Rag kill  1st  epic mount 1st time someone cleared Ragefire chasm  1st time someone had X Y &amp; Z drop  1st time A B OR C happend, no  one fucking cares
---
All that sounds like it would take longer than half a second so none of what you just said would gain aggro.  Switching to bezerker stance to whirlwind takes like 3-4 seconds for it to hit. The aggro is long gone by then. 
---
From my experience its charge - taunt, because the mob is already running over to the dps before my charge ended. Where are you finding these groups that give you a 20 second head start?
---
Although thunderclap is shit for threat, it’s instant and buys you some time (1 second), and then you can use oil of immolation to help keep non elite mobs on you while you rank the elites. 
---
I always laugh at these spell rotation guides that use like 5 different spells as an opener, assuming any dps will wait for your rotation.
---
Even on k3 and northdale where people were paying 1500 for edgemasters, the first one went for about 300. Now we're on classic and people are paying like 250 for edgemasters. I think if people are unlucky and there aren't many dropping for the next week or two then the price may be higher, like up to 600 or so. But with how many people there are on each realm there has been a lot of supply for these high end items
---
I mean you can be ready for PVP without playing so much. People just need to accept whenever they post APES stuff they are going to have a lot of people reacting with cringe.
---
Yeah - and not to mention that when we get to BRD, even if you want to do a "fast" run which entails skipping bosses. inevitably even though you specified it up front, groups want to do this or that boss since it's "on the way". That still adds time and then the moment you allow that, then it opens up a new can of worms that OK since you let this pass, then why can't we do this one too?
---
Now what could have been an ~1 hour or so Emperor run, becomes a 2-3 hour one. With people dropping out because they have to go pick up their kid, their baby wakes up, etc etc.
---
I'm not hating on the family real life aspect, because I'm in that same boat myself. 15 years later we're all raising families of our own. But the long dungeon aspect is 100% agreed. I thought LBRS was going to be relatively fast dungeon. I was dead wrong.
---
"Sinew isn't a 40% drop rate. Even if it was you'd have to compete with other hunters on it as well as the leaf. It's not as easy to get as you think."
---
And melee have to compete with 10+ other melee for every drop they get.
---
As a hunter, you get 90% of your loot uncontested. Dragonstalker gear only for hunters, BiS weapon only for hunters. But you also want to take the gear that all the melee fight over as a temp upgrade. We literally have like 5 upgrades in all of MC and you want to take one that is BiS for your temporary dps.
---
Run with other players is the only other one I see
---
One of my favorite videos ever was a rouge seeing a warrior knowing he would charge and timing his jump off a cliff and shadow stepping mid charge so he ended up on the cliff with the warrior falling to his death.
---
So you honestly, hearnestly think, the tank isn't supposed to have aggro on Skull? What's your battle tag so I might never ever tank for you.
---
Often if I am less than 50% mana, I won't heal the tank between fights either; especially if there is a mage in the group so he has access to free food. When I am full mana (or enough), I will top him up with something massively downranked and that's the indication we are gtg.
---
So sick of the drink, top up, drink; while people are standing there complaining. So much faster if they eat the free food.
---
People are looking forward to content that is actually challenging in later phases. This means it won't be challenging.
---
what you mean "overleveled" ? edit: ha you mean being myself overleveled toward mobs. yes! greens die much faster (especially if your main damage is a weapon, "hitrate" as you said). this is better  XP/h
---
No one in this chain was upset that is not the same as a private server.  It was literally just a comparison.
---
Saw someone running away from all the orcs they aggroed in front of the Missing In Action quest cave in Redridge and thought "Oh hey I can use his downfall to my advantage." Only realizing my mistake when they simply turned around to destroy me instead.
---
It's funny that you're being downvoted for the truth
---
What do you mean? Basically whenever you click the add-on does a hidden background SendWho()
---
That way you don't have to spend 30 minutes clicking.
---
There's a DM quest that rewards a new rank of water
---
I ran in 19:01 without any trouble. Heard they were zerging camp mojache then.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/statistics/1000#dataset=75
---
DW Fury is pumping out roughly double the dps as shaman right now. 2h fury is probably 1.5-1.75X. 
---
Off tank warriors are your Best nightfall users, but Shaman aren’t so horrendous that they get trippled up.
---
I wish you luck bruh. I love the other specs of shaman but their lack of itemization makes raiding pretty difficult, not to mention "meme spec snowflake spec" moaners on Reddit and YouTube
---
I have no problem with the hunter leaving at all, I just thought it to be weird that there was no chance for me mediating the situation that's all really. It would have given him one more shot at the cape and me another run for other gear than the cape there plus gold, no one has to lose out on anything.
---
Nah, it's only the hardcore crowd that are already 60. 8d played time to 60 is pretty average which is almost 200 hours, easily 2-3 months if you play 2-3 hours a day.
---
No new content is coming until next year currently (aside from a dungeon that came out today) so you have plenty of time to get caught up and enjoy molten core / onyxia before more difficult bosses come out
---
There's no Player vs Player rewards yet, so you're not behind on anything if that's more your realm of play
---
As for realm populations, realms that say 'layered' will have the highest population as realms have been moved down to 1 or 2 layers depending on their population (smaller servers are only 1 layer now)
---
&gt; So, we are talking about whether Striker's Mark should be prio to a warrior or a hunter. These are usually decisions guilds are making, not pugs. So in the context of this post, I don't find this an outlandish assumption.
---
OP did not specify whether or not this was a guild or pug situation 
---
&gt; We got three sinews in 3 weeks. You tell me what the drop rate is then. It is high. Alot higher than Striker's Mark.
---
And I've seen 2 sinews in now 9 kills, anecdotal evidence works both ways.
---
&gt; Like come on, what a shit argument.
---
hitting hit cap as a hunter is already quite the struggle, you sacrifice a lot of agility to do so in these early days so I'm not sure where you're getting this from. In full 8/8 T1 and as much hit as you possibly can get from gear, you actually end up at 7% hit so it's currently not even viable for hunters to use full tier unless they are a troll since they only need 6% with rhok.
---
&gt; That's somewhere between 1 and 2 % of your DPS
---
2% of 1000 is what? Yeah I think you can do math. And 1000 is extremely generous btw.
---
&gt; It is the only evidence either party has brought to the table
---
Actually no, since someone else linked an analysis of simulations for all hunter weapons, of which I cited my reasoning from.
---
Yes i am aware.   
---
Yes? That is my point.  I am saying that if i just let an alliance go and mind their business then i am fucked if they come after me because i didnt act offensively and just charge them.  Once they hit me i am in combat and lose all the benefits that come from an offensive by using charge.
---
You should check out maraudon solo runs then
---
I went all in finding a competitive guild pre-launch (server first Alliance clears woo).
---
All my friends except 1 were casual and I expected them all to drop off before 60. The one casual I expected to at least hit 60 has been 22 for weeks while he players boarderlands 3 and I have no idea if he's coming back. I let them all know where I'm playing and that I'd be happy to help but I made 0 plans or decisions with them in mind.
---
The exception is a good friend who I know will keep pace with me. Just didn't want to be quite as competitive as me and also wanted to go horde. He's 60, raiding and working on alts but his "not as competitive" guild is not as great as he hoped (They gave an aurastone hammer to a priest and the cauterizing band to their absolute worst healer to "help" them get better)
---
I think you are reading his sentance different then me. Post 1 says I dont want to click every 10 seconds. Post 2 says just make a macro to click for you every 10 seconds
---
Lol, what? Zombies drop 1-5s each on average from my experience. Plus the graves themselves give loot when opening them.
---
Ya those idiots at WoWhead, I don't know why the Hunter discord recommends that guide, I guess these places are wrong too.
---
WoWisClassic.com
---
Vanilla-info.com
---
 guides from Nostralius,Kronos,Elysium and even the majority of Classic BiS spreadsheets.
---
I would be much better off listening to some stranger on Reddit, because if we have ever learned anything. Reddit is never wrong!
---
Or maybe I should have hit ALT-F4 while doing it?
---
Why did you hide your gold amount Lololol
---
Just farm epic boes dude jesus whats so hard with that
---
Yeah, I only get attacked by an individual player if I'm fighting/just finished fighting a mob or if the player is a warlock.
---
Whoa.
---
Usually dont have rage for that in dungeons and its only two blocks with a talent.
---
I have. I was referring to a total clear of a dungeon.
---
What's up with the tooltip on that conjure water spell? It's snarky as fuck:
---
&gt;Conjures 10 bottle of crystal water, providing the mage and *his* allies with something to drink.
---
It's like it's poking at the fact that you will be nothing more than a vending machine to your friends thanks to this spell.
---
Yes, there are changes. Some are side grades or alternatives. Keep in mind that BIS lists have multiple options as one item is not always the clear best in slot (especially for pre-raid gear). 
---
The new enchants are BIS. 
---
The tempest talisman, amplifying cloak, rod of ogre magi, and sublime wristguards are potential BIS pieces but not really better than current BIS pieces.
---
Outside of enchants, there isn’t really a clear BIS piece from DM that you cannot get an equivalent of elsewhere (note some of it is preference....some BIS pieces are basically green pieces of frozen wrath, but a blue with less damage may be preferred due to stats).
---
Okay maybe op was too freaked out, but it wouldve been nice to farm DM
---
Great argument. There's videos online of 04-06 Dire Maul contradicting the scripting of DM today.
---
I can tell you have low brain mass by the way that you put together words.
---
I can buy tensions building again after warcraft 3, especially since it's 4 years later or something when vanilla WoW starts and it's the first time.
---
Most expansion recycles are united front one day, kill all horde/alliance a couple days later.  Add in that existential threats pop up every other weekend....
---
I don't have many friends but the few I do have barely played at all. A couple were saying for awhile before release that they were going to play but didn't really. One started like a month later and is somewhere around 15 but he's too busy with being a doctor to play much. My girlfriend has been playing since release with me but I'm pretty sure it's only because I'm playing. I've been 60 for almost a month though and have multiple alts in the 20s and 30s and plan to stick around for quite awhile.
---
Hot take, you can keep drinking for a bit during the pull.
---
Dire Maul added a quest that rewards you with a new rank of Conjure Water that allows you to make the highest level water.
---
People always funded MT respecs and repair bills when I was raiding in vanilla, in my raiding guild as well as the ones I was familiar with on the server. A guild only has 2-3 MTs usually, its very inexpensive compared to consumables for the raid.
---
Ass? Lol
---
This is something noone Even knew back then. And was abused in tbc hint it was fix.you want everyone running around with 100%crit and 40k hp? No thanks. Need to be fast instant fix.
---
Tldr: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
No dude,  this goes against all of the *freaking out* that everyone was doing after DM was announced.  DM literally has to ruin the game at this point otherwise no one was justified in their ridiculous 'wait for me' 'but muh economeh' rage.
---
Can anyone help me come up with something to be extremely concerned about now?
---
where's your horde?  I have ally on incend and I might look to cross-trade some gold for the same purpose
---
Based on? 15 year old memories? Private servers. Not saying your wrong but.. you might be
---
Pst can mean pacific time zone or please send tell/ whisper.
---
Hmm, none so far (3 of them). They're all newbies, though, so they level slow and they don't play a lot, but they are still playing.
---
Yeah people often mention how it's no problem to heal lowbie dungeons as offspec, and that's true. The caveat is that the group has to know how to play. A mainspec healer can carry a poor party, whereas offspec has to hope the party is good enough.
---
Honestly leveling my tank alt after going through Wailing Caverns with my healer and dps was fucking awful. The dungeon seems so much longer because you not just pressing buttons at range waiting for a hp bar to go up and down. Tanking is so much more mechanically involved than dps. It's soooo tiring.
---
Oof. Dumbass
---
Was 4,then 10 around AQ iirc
---
The Time value of money concept in economics would say it's worth more to have the money in hand than a theoretical return later on. 
---
I'd agree with that. Sell it now. Buy your mount if you don't have it. Save the money otherwise for a big purchase near 60. 
---
And hunters should be relatively easy to level. I'd download questie if i were you so you can see where you can quest. It marks available quets on your map so you can understand where the questing hubs are.
---
Even with that bug mages still aren't doing more dps than warriors. Let's say you have 5 mages and your ignite mage is doing 2k dps ~1200 of that dps would be coming from ignite. If you divide that 1200 by 5 you get ~240 dps per mage. Meaning that top damage mage is only actually doing ~1k dps on his own. ————Warriors can easily achieve numbers higher than this especially now———— with this new "bug feature" not to mention keeping a single ignite going involves some RNG and coordination between your mages and also risks pulling aggro off the tank the higher you boost one mages numbers where as your warriors are each achieving similar numbers entirely on their own with no risk or coordination required.
---
I can say with certainty that a /cast shoot guns and /cast throw are drastically different times for rogues and warriors.  I think you may be confusing shooting a gun or bow on a hunter being the same as /cast throw on a rogue or warrior.
---
well my comment was a question … but I have the answer now, thanks
---
Most likely, but I think the multiple boss fight model is much better. We used to have to clear trash for hours and hours and hours for a shot at 2 or 3 pieces of loot with 72 people. And the spawns were shared on the server so really only one guild per server. I never understood why WoW didn't adopt the token loot model. You would get tokens for essentially plate\mail\cloth and turn them in to get the gear for your specific class.
---
Yea strong choice for duels, amazing choice for BGs. Duels are tough to pick a best because there is a little bit of "rock-paper-scissors" going on.
---
someone is going to report this as a bug, which im pretty sure it is since you cant stack buffs of the same kind at the same time
---
Vaya
---
Is the rogue waiting a second or two for you to pick up some threat first? Rogues know they have ballin single target so they should also know how to manage their threat.
---
You should atleast have 1 stack of sunder down, probably 2 if they're planning on popping cooldowns (e.g: Adrenaline Rush, Berserking, etc)
---
You can use a damage meter and see if they're jumping the gun. They do have feint as a way to blow off some extra threat
---
If they're popping evasion, they may be intentionally taking threat as a rogue with evasion on can avoid quite a few hits.
---
Calling others 'special snowflakes' just to get riled up by someone sharing their accomplishment on a fucking video game seems pretty ironic.
---
It wasn't and they seem to have modified standard mechanics specifically for this DM release. Aggro ranges changed (the big trees are the biggest offenders), patrol routes and speed changed, loot tables nuked, etc.
---
Dire Maul farm ain't happening
---
Melee classes who are not where the tank is I guess.  A mob in Frost Nova does not just start behaving differently because they are in a Nova.  They simply shift their threat table around to only consist of the people in melee range of them.  If you are a melee character and are getting hit by a mob in a Nova, then either you have more threat on that mob than the tank (that's on you) or the tank is not in melee range of that mob but you are (that's on you).  Either way, fucking move if you need to (that's on you).
---
It should be Hourafter (Our)
---
As in "Hour after / Our work is never over"
---
&gt;  In full 8/8 T1 and as much hit as you possibly can get from gear, you actually end up at 7% hit so it's currently not even viable for hunters to use full tier unless they are a troll since they only need 6% with rhok.
---
Why are you trying to wear full Tier 1 instead of devilsaur? 
---
Imagine thinking youre supposed to wear your full  tier 1 set to optimize DPS. My point is that the hit % on strikers doesn't do shit for you. Tell me what gear you get to replace by having hit on your bow.
---
You sacrifice agi for hit cap?? Well no shit, you need hit cap. Its not really a sacrifice, shit makes no sense.
---
On my rogue I like to grab a bunch of mobs, run to alliance, then vanish. Works the same way.
---
There's a literal fucking raid of &lt;Rise&gt; zoning in and out of DM North killing people.
---
Eh, retail has it's flaws and I personally prefer Classic for the most part but there's definitely some solid reasons to play retail as well. I'm kind of considering buying BFA while it's on sale for $30 because I really want to play my death knight again.
---
heck, just macro your pickpocket!
---
/cast Pick Pocket  
---
/cast Ambush  
---
OR  
---
Unironically this.
---
It was pretty obvious even without the census data that certain servers were absurdly skewed but the public heed number did make things worse with transfers
---
Anytime within that three month window from release of 1.3 and June of 2005.
---
Please try and keep up, I realize you are slow.
---
Actually they do, lol
---
Level 20 is a good power spike for rogues.
---
- You get poisons that let you deal additional damage and apply various effects (Slows, spell casting delay, DoT etc)  
---
- Riposte gives you an attack after parrying  
---
- Ghostly Strike which gives evasion  
---
At 22 you get Vanish, which is basically an "oh fuck" button that lets you get out of any situation where it looks like you might die. 
---
&gt;Are there any tips you guys can give me?
---
You should have sap, if you need to fight more than one enemy, use sap to disable the other.  
---
Bandages are amazing on rogues, get First Aid if you haven't got it already.   
---
Fighting humanoids that run can be good because you get a lot of free backstab options.  
---
Upgrading weapons &gt; upgrading gear.  
---
Learn your energy ticks.
---
Phase 3 adds AV and WSG.
---
Yes, for most classes alot changes. I'm not sure about mages tho, i can recommend EVERYONE to take a look at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit#gid=1246215761 , not the garbage that is listed at WoWHead. Most guides on WoWHead are not good at all.
---
Kromcrush is pretty balanced
---
Yes. It’s a Charge still. It just has downsides to make up for the fact it’s usable in combat
---
Are you talking about the blue crossbow from LBRS - Blackcrow?
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12651/blackcrow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12651/blackcrow) 
---
If you're a rogue, you should 100% be needing on that. It's your BIS ranged weapon. Hunters have multiple better ranged weapons and will replace it pretty quick - They can get Carapace Spine Crossbow out of Strat. The reason is that Blackcrow is a stat stick for melee so we don't care about it's damage values. As an actual weapon, Blackcrow isn't all that great.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18738/carapace-spine-crossbow](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18738/carapace-spine-crossbow)
---
As Alliance on Kirtonos, I can confirm.  Anything after 3:00 central is almost certain death for me.
---
Remember Heroic Strike does not generate rage. So using it and not generating rage on hit makes it really expensive. 
---
So dont use it unless you have to dump rage.
---
NugEnergy.
---
Do you have first aid? What spec are you leveling as? Dual wield, as well as vanish, blind, and blade flurry are massive helps.
---
&gt; And melee have to compete with 10+ other melee for every drop they get.
---
this is probably the only good argument you've made in this entire time 
---
&gt; As a hunter, you get 90% of your loot uncontested.
---
er that's just a straight up lie, other than tier and rhok/lok we share loot with melee dps
---
&gt; Dragonstalker gear only for hunters
---
no shit?
---
&gt; BiS 
---
Not all bis is equal
---
It was abused when it first came out, requiring users to have specific achievements in order to be part of raid groups.
---
you're right i should make the most out of it now and maybe someone is gonna be really happy about buying that item. :)
---
Cant wait for the absolute pandamonium
---
If we really are talking all 3 than shadow priests arent even good. They are great in 1v1 but pretty trash in BGs. Infinitelly worse than locks and mages. No one who wants to create the best comp possible for a premade will take a shadow priest
---
Getting a life! Boom! Joke, just get 52 then start doing BRD.
---
Bubble hearth. That'll show 'em. Flex that teleport skill.
---
Ahhh.
---
I'm pretty sure WoW is rated T for teens. Shouldn't your parents be monitoring your internet usage? Lol
---
Upvote for you!
---
Same.  Assign a casting mob as Skull if possible, they die super fast and won't do much more damage to a DPS than they would to the tank anyway.  Better to lose one mob to your group than to lose every mob.
---
that's not what you said. why you backpedaling?
---
Did this quest 2 weeks ago and it wasn't bugged then.
---
The NPC patrols the road with 5-6 guards, if it gets killed then it takes a while to spawn.
---
I find that if you're not on this quest, you'll definitely run into the patrol... If you're on the quest, finding the patrol is a mission.
---
Equip it, fuck it. It's pre-bis and it's great not having to worry about replacing an item until you're 60.
---
Can be tightened to 18 mins, the latest runs. Give people time to perfect it.
---
Or just hold shift when you loot important corpses
---
6/10 nb
---
Darn.
---
THIS IS IT. THANK YOU
---
If your horde do fish in a bucket
---
not very often I guess.
---
never change a  winning team.  (and when a problem arises I just visit the source, usually github I think, and download the newest version)
---
It can take a hell of a long time to replace this ring. For PvE it can be first replaced by Maiden's Circle, which has been selling for like 400-500g on my server. Other than that you're looking at raid loot to replace it, which will be highly coveted by many players of multiple classes. 
---
tldr unless you buy something much more expensive, it could be literal months before you get a better endgame ring for a warlock. Use it.
---
which ability?
---
Gotcha. Did not know this. Thank you.
---
"Stacking with each other" meaning that you can just keep getting the buff over and over by talking to the NPC over and over on a single clear?
---
Yeeeaaahh, I'm not going to risk getting banned by doing that.
---
&gt; Why are you trying to wear full Tier 1 instead of devilsaur?
---
15% damage to multishot is a large dps increase. Once the scope comes out 8/8 tier is by far best for dps
---
&gt; My point is that the hit % on strikers doesn't do shit for you.
---
For every other race than troll it definitely does.
---
Just healed my first dungeon as Shammy. Two Qs
---
1. My totems didn't seem to effect bear druid tank (tried numerous earth totems). Why is that? Bear buff already better?
---
2. Healbot is incredible. Any addon like that for tanks or locks?
---
Weirdly, I think the italics indicate some kind of change in the language. If you click on the actual item itself, and hover over *his*, you get:  [https://i.imgur.com/ErkcdzS.png](https://i.imgur.com/ErkcdzS.png)  
---
It looks like the way they show what changes in a patch, but no indication of anything more specific. Weird.
---
This is the only place I should express it.
---
It wouldn't be right to talk about it behind their back.
---
For sure, it’s either kill green levels or bandage every other mob, which I am not totally opposed to, but still less than ideal
---
I would really, really appreciate to see this video so if you can find that that would be huge but if you can't I understand bro
---
It reminds me of Widow-plays
---
I'm a druid tank, and when I team up with a warlock its life tap and rejuvenate. I also spot heal when res happens. The healers mana is all that matters.
---
you have to be lvl xx to start it, not sure what xx is, look it up
---
Am I the only one that didn’t mind collecting the cores? 46 rogue and I didn’t have any trouble with the giants or cores, maybe the mobs were a little tough but not overly
---
This is a warlock focused farming guide:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atR4YELQrbQ&amp;t=542s
---
I have a 60 war, so no farming there for me XD
---
Because I think achievements serve as weak placeholders for game devs to add real content.  They are a simple-minded approach at engagement.  They fuel the concept of the participation trophy.
---
I dislike them in **any** game and they've zero place in Classic.  I'm not some direhard #NoChanges kind of dude but man...they weren't there originally and should never be added.
---
What are you even talking about? Underworld band is pre-BIS for locks and I think Spriest and is huge for twinks.
---
Please god no achievements.... Put time and labor into shit that matters
---
&gt;Well it could have been 3 days. It was a hotfixed, after all. We know it occurred within the span of 3 months but don’t know when it occurred.
---
Backpedaling, you say?
---
i have first aid but didnt want to waste money on wool to get the bandages I need. Im leveling as combat with dual swords.
---
Or you’re super rich and don’t want people to spam beg you!
---
Can I have 100g for mount?
---
I had my best friend fall off pretty much the 3rd day. He spent the whole previous week getting so hyped. After he quit I joined my cousin on a different server and got tired of waiting on the queue times (Herod). So then I went to my other cousin's server and we had a great weekend playing, but he has a kid now and a super ex wife, so he hardly gets on. Now I have 3 toons in the 40's across 3 servers haha.
---
BOE. Everyone needs. Shouldn't change rules to suit one thing. Miss out. Tough. Run again.
---
OP didn't make this. The insane guild APES did. Truly one of the wildest guilds out there
---
You live with your mom
---
LF2M DPS MYTHIC GUL LINK AOTC PLZ WILL ARMORY shit was just annoying
---
See, you are misunderstanding everything. Classic WoW isn't Retail WoW. "Skill" matters in retail, the highest content is gated by skill and only the most skilled players get CE or timed +20 key.
---
In Classic "skill" = time invested. You can be a keyboard turner skill-clicker and be a god in classic if you play 24/7. Just grind all the gear/gold no-lifing the game. Then walk into content with consumables and epic BOE and loot council gear-funneling (because your on all the time and are friends with all the officers). A MDI champion in blues, even playing their class perfectly, will lose to a keyboard turner skill-clicker. This is a game for no-lifers and retail players need to come in with eyes open.
---
So when you apply to a guild as main tank telling them you have consecutive CE since so and so season, it doesn't mean squat to them. Skill has no bearing in Classic (maybe a little in Naxx). That's why you are so confused as to why people don't respect your CE (mad respect btw). They'd rather have a player that is online all the time and can cast frostbolt over and over again than any truly skilled players.
---
Start at tarren mill in hillsbrad and run backwards towards the arathi horde town.
---
Join a decent guild, and try your damndest to do guild runs
---
Yes. But intercept can be used in combat which warriors get at like lvl 32.
---
This is why I will be running DM exclusively with guildies.
---
Ive seens lots of warlocks with it on whitemane for 2 weeks now... Reddit farmer
---
Remove questing addons before taking screens. Filty casul.
---
I literally made that argument in one of my first posts and you ignored it. You ignored that argument at least 3 times in this discussion. 
---
And it isn't the only good argument. The fact that you have a very high drop rate BiS bow IN THE SAME DUNGEON is also a good argument. The fact that striker's is not/barely better than your prebis is a good argument. The fact that Striker's is BiS for 2 other classes all the way til AQ/Naxx is a good argument. The fact that clipping your shot timer is bad and feels awful to play with is a good argument. 
---
90% of your loot is rhok and tier gear, get it yet? DPS Warriors don't get tier gear. They literally have 5 things to roll on in MC thats it.
---
&gt; in no way did i present a lack of understanding of how patches work
---
That's your opinion, and I didn't get that from your presentation.
---
&gt;smear
---
this is reddit, not something that matters
---
They didn't really make a move at all other than release the instance. They just implemented the 1.12 database values.
---
No. Mages have no items that are pre-bis or bis in Dire Maul. There's some items that come close but the pre-bis list stays the same.
---
Having said that the water... now that's a different story!
---
Your way of thinking is as bad as the ninjas themselves.
---
Combine the lines this way:
---
/cast [stance:1/2,equipped:shield,@mouseover,harm,nodead][stance:1/2,equipped:shield] Shield Bash;
---
I'm a tank. If I saw the QS book drop there's no way I would expect everyone to just pass it to me. You're asking people to pass on like 1k gold to get you a sword that's just fine. Not great, not spectacular. Fine.
---
The constructive way is to educate them first, and resort to kicking them out if they continue their bad behavior. There's plenty of other people they can group with. If they don't find like-minded people, then ideally they will start listening to the education.
---
I was doing jump runs regularly until at least a couple weeks after nax released. The market will be flooded with shards, thorium and herbs from these alone. 
---
Maybe one or two of the farms won't work as well as people think, but the ones that will are going to throw the markets way out of wack.
---
Hahaha, everybody knows that Princess means the last boss of Maraudon, followed by King Thaurissan in BRD.
---
&gt; As a tank, this is a very BiS item for me, a huge upgrade, and farming the gold to buy it from AH, is simply not a thing, unless i start charging each groupmembers gold for tanking, and causing a public cryfest.  
---
6 commas.
---
if there is no hunter, you can bet i roll on carpace spine for pvp, when it comes around.
---
IMO the reason is pretty apparent by all of the responses on every one of these threads.  I've tanked through BC, WOTLK, Cata, Legion, and BFA and everybody here always gripes about "Let the tank pull", "Don't hit the mobs until I have threat", "Focus Skull".
---
Sure those are all great ideas, but if it pisses you off when people don't do it then you're probably not going to be a tank for long.  Tanking isn't about sitting there and getting beat on, it's about reacting to whatever the situation is.  I don't mind when a DPS pulls threat, I'll go taunt it back and smash it in the face with my shield.  I don't care if a DPS purposely or accidentally pulls another pack.  I'm going to pick every last one of them up, hit my cooldowns if needed and tank it.  That's the fun part of being a tank, you can change the playstyle depending on how the group wants to progress and you can prevent the whole group from wiping if you're good enough (and technically they are not bad enough).
---
huh???
---
DM isnt dire maul because Dire maul isnt a dungeon. Its 3. No one looking for DM means dire maul. Just like no one says lfg sm, or lfg rf (razorfen) Hell, technically UBRS and LBRS are the same dungeon and even then nobody says LFG BRS. Its either ubrs or lbrs. Just like dire maul is either dm:n,w or e
---
The original post about the shield. My bad, jumping through threads. I stand by the rest of my comment
---
It's Vanish and Preparation to Vanish again..
---
Ok so keep going down combat for now then at 30 respec down to hemorrhage? Should I grab preparation too? Also after that should I hit assassination tree? And swords or daggers? A lot of questions lol I read a lot of mixed stuff online
---
It's a boe of value boes of value are instaneed.  You're not entitled to extremely valuable items because you can use them.  Anyone can sell it get gold and buy extremely.valuable items they can use.  You can do it too you can need mage boes sell them and buy your book.
---
Yea, Im unsure of what these people are genuinly thinking lol
---
This sub is super American in that way.
---
Guess we'll have to see how tribute runs work out for us tree huggers
---
Agility, dawg.
---
Tell me what gear you will replace by having strikers' hit on bow.
---
It's literally best in slot according to multiple websites lol I'd assume all the rogues in his guild got one first ofc iunno why these posts blow up the way they do
---
No1 mentions insase aggro range on big treants? Besides little to no loot its another big issue for lasher farming.
---
Wow who pissed in your cornflakes this morning bud?
---
It depends on the loot rules for the group. Everyone need on BOE blues and epics? Or need if you truly need it and plan to equip it?
---
Neither rule set is inherently wrong. Just be up front at party formation.
---
The tank should be backing up the healer in that case and telling the DPS to fuck off.  The other DPS in the group will stay silent unless they are friends/guildies, but it doesn't matter because DPS are easily replaceable.  Tanks and healers need to back each other up.
---
I tanked from vanilla to wotlk. I love it, once I began tanking in vanilla I didn't want to do anything else.
---
I don't tank in classic.
---
Can confirm, I reported a pretty severe bug before (and know a few other people that did), and it's still working.
---
Desolace is very underpopulated and a good bet for questing
---
Its a Skinners delight too for simple grinding
---
RIP my meme.
---
Why cant you be the MT for raids? Afaik youll only be missing maybe last stand or shield wall from deep prot.
---
The ability to get it should open today with the release of Dire Maul. If someone was saying they were getting it before they were probably talking about obtaining the required items for the mount.
---
Unless it's been fixed, and I haven't read that it has, there is also a bug that causes pw:s to not take damage from melee crits.
---
Did anyone honestly say that?  I thought one of the biggest draws of Classic was that it was harder?
---
&gt;I’m really considering respecing into shadow and going dps.
---
Prepare to do less DPS than the tank.
---
&gt; Not all bis is equal
---
If you are making this argument, you are arguing that a small, temporary upgrade/downgrade in DPS is somehow better than melee having their BiS bow. Absurd.
---
Maybe they were posted after your comment, but there's a decent number of toxic posts at this point.
---
RNG hates me, is how.
---
Players weren’t complaining. Streamers weren’t complaining. You’re just throwing a fit and blaming anyone and everyone that is popular to blame.
---
Great.  But this is.  Literal blue post said it was based on feedback from the community asking for more content.  i.e. people were getting bored.  Any of the popular streamers were complaining about needing more content.  It's just facts. 
---
I literally said what the blue posts was stating.
---
True gatekeeping.
---
I suppose buffs in diremaul stacking endlessly is in-line with what as accurate during vanilla too? lol. If you haven't learned by now just because blizz releases it one way doesn't make it a carbon copy of vanilla on classic.
---
Probably more like a threat reduction than a complete dump.

I picked a server and leveled up on my own time, i told people what server I rolled on and offered them bags/money. Not too long ago I started receiving the return mail from the bags i sent which means they didn't log back on in 30 days.
---
I’m so surprised about this.
---
Had a dog of a time going from 1-40 due to constant ganks.     
---
I’m 47 now and no ones touched me since I picked up Shadowform.
---
To be fair, our slow is useless when trying to pursue someone since it's a channeled ability and we have no move speed abilities. So its fairly easy to just run from us out in the wild.
---
I was always fury, I've never specced prot in classic. I can tank UBRS perfectly fine and I just grabbed tanking gear as I was levelling.
---
Do I have good tanking gear now? Absolutely. But there was no point where I needed someone else to tank for me.
---
The Blizzard employee who made the post on the forums.
---
Why wouldn't I be?
---
&gt;  We know it occurred within the span of 3 months
---
you don't know that
---
in fact:
---
&gt; From AllakhazamBy zergged on **2006/04/30** (Patch 1.9.4)		
---
Subject: "pwned"
---
These mobs were nerfed literally while I was pulling. I zoned in and got 225 per mob, zoned out, reset, came back in and got 65 per kill :( Either way I went from 52-58 in 2 days of casual play.
---
that post makes the case that ***A YEAR LATER*** some guy level 52 was still able to farm them
---
Mind sending me the said post?
---
How do u balance everything?
---
A lot of arms thrown in the air over (14 Damage blocked) yeah HUGE MITIGATION
---
This was someone saying it after DM was released. 
---
There was some speculation that the epic mount quests would not be released with DM since they were originally released in a later latch in vanilla. 
---
I was seeking confirmation that that speculation was wrong.
---
Incendius here too; seconding this sentiment. Our server pop feels pretty balanced right now.
---
As daggers i found 18 to be a huge improvement due to ambush. Then poisons at 20 are a huge dps boost. Distract is also a major quality of life upgrade that i think is about level 24? You also get parry some time arounf 20 iirc. It definitely gets better!
---
got attacked by a spriest 4 levels higher while fighting a mob as rogue. he lost. 
---
being undead helps a TON though
---
You can do Lashers just fine. It's not SUPER profitable, but if you include Herbalism, I think you can easily go up to 50g/hr.
---
Let's be honest, I get the frustration but free rolling expensive BoE items is standard practice and Foror's is no different.
---
Don't lie, the ad water gives 4410, mages give 4200 :D
---
Yes, it had been answered before the edit, by people who were making assumptions. I wasn't asking for people to give me their best guess. There are plenty of people who will give answers about things as they remember them from vanilla or private servers, since this is a different game those kinds of responses aren't worth much.
---
I'm surprised anyone still finds it morally acceptable to support blizzard by remaining subscribed.
---
Is pre-raid bis good enough for fire boss?
---
you have stealth book runs as rogue (not sure if its viable in classic)
---
You are the tank and the healer?
---
I think the other posters pretty much covered it, but just in case you wanted to know the timeline, achievements were released in a patch shortly before the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.
---
Edit: spelling
---
&gt; Legit had a rogue facepull a bunch and also complained we werent going fast enough. 
---
The fastest classes to level are DPS classes.  They do this by killing things quickly.
---
Like, think about it:  That *is* DPS's whole strategy. For 60 levels!  "Kill faster to win."
---
When all you have is ~~a hammer~~ DPS, everything looks like ~~a nail~~ trash mobs.
---
Ya, everyone sees the same thing on the vendor, things you can't buy are blocked out.  But @ 60 you can buy all the lower level blues, and at level 1 you'll see everything as well and you can buy stuff you can't use, if you get the honor.
---
An army of priests should MC them back to make the corpse walks take longer.
---
If you’re 60, even killing trash in EPL is more profitable. Fish is good for lv 40 mount though
---
This only happens when you try to message someone who already has you ignored.
---
So you were ignored for something you did before this SS.
---
&gt;  As a tank, this is a very BiS item for me
---
 Not true
---
&gt; and farming the gold to buy it from AH, is simply not a thin
---
Then how is it a thing for all the other guys buying it?
---
Stop crying and stop being greedy just because you're poor.
---
&gt;  It’s fun or funny to some people. Why shit on their joy? 
---
Yet you don't care about the grief caused to other players?
---
You probably think prank videos where some asshole goes up and punches someone are funny.
---
I feel this hard, also a resto shaman.  We had our first full guild MC last night and even though we cleared up to Domo (didn't have douses) in a pretty decent time I've gotten really soured on healing. That shit was not fun, and the entire night consisted of raid lead and officers fucking begging the DPS to give the tanks five fucking seconds to do anything before they start trying to nuke anything.
---
Just to make sure we're both using the same definition here:
---
&gt;ho·li·er-than-thou
---
&gt;/ˌhōlēərT͟HənˈT͟Hou/
---
&gt;adjective
---
&gt;characterized by an attitude of moral superiority.
---
I just want to clarify my usage of the term when I said:
---
&gt;I've noticed the trend of those who come in and complain about shitty PvP behavior tend to be the "holier than thou" type - which is what prompted me to post.
---
Those who are complaining usually spot off 3 points:
---
1.) Whoever ganks is a sociopath/pyschopath/child.
---
2.) Whoever gank is a low life neckbeard.
---
3.) *I* would never stoop to such lows because *I'm* above such *childish* behavior.
---
Generally, they're trying to set up the argument in which they have the moral high ground. It's less of a "high ground" and more of "buckets we strapped to our feet to give us an extra foot of height". To come back to the basketball analogy, it's like having the ball stolen from you then getting all outraged because, "only children would steal a ball like that!" It's literally written into the rules, ya know?
---
&gt;Honor is awarded for winning fights not for camping lowbies.
---
I never specified anything about camping lowbies. As a general rule, I **do not** camp. If we're questing in the same area and we keep running across each? Yeah, I'll kill you a few times until I'm done with that area but then I'm out.
---
&gt;Are you owning your behavior when you deploy such camouflage?
---
I'm a little confused here, are you saying that I'm hiding behind...some...moral superiority when I own up to my behavior? I didn't think I was hiding behind anything when I said out and out that I PvP (of course, I did trigger a poster saying that my brother and I roll through STV on our war/priest combo - we *just* dinged 40).
---
&gt;It seems to me these inevitable posts accusing complainers of being crybabies are a defense mechanism. That's why I said that gankers are insecure and are doing it from a need to reinforce their own positive self images.
---
Frankly, you can say that of both sides. Trying to psychoanalyze randomly people over the internet is going to end in a bad time. 
---
Either way, it's nice having a calm, reasonable discussion. Happy questing and may your leveling have no ganks.
---
I mean to tank in leather/mail you are heavily dependent on your healer being good, you will as you say get more rage and threat. 
---
the problem is that a lot of times its a ret pally healing to get into dungeons. 
---
there is always some leeway in dungeons, not everyone needs to be pre-bis and in the right spec, but if everyone is doing off spec and with random gear, it won't be smooth. 
---
Tanking with shield in leather / mail is not impossible tho I agree, esp since DM is easier than UBRS MTing. 
---
This is assuming perfect pulls and etc. Because Strat UD and Scholo can get dicy real quick due to mob density. While UBRS pulls are less hard but they hit real hard post rend.
---
Keep in mind that this man is like 40 years old with kids. Can't even spell humorous.
---
I'd recommend looking up on guides how to tank certain dungeons, I mean you can tell people this is a new dungeon for you and hopefully they will accommodate. For me I like to be prepared so I usually check out a dungeon guide. Classic is my first warrior especially tanking as I've always been a DD. 
---
Good luck out there mate.
---
Yea, let’s ignore the two posts from June 2005. Are you honestly this dumb or are you just playing around?
---
then you have to answer, at what point did i make ANY indication that i don't understand how patches work?
---
go ahead. your chance to present your case
---
Reads like captain Kirk
---
Shhhh
---
Correct me if I'm wrong isn't cleave a preferable rage dump for fury warriors?
---
yeah im pve specced swords thats not gonna work for me dog
---
They've had it since 2 weeks before DM was even out? Amazin'
---
pve specced dude
---
I believe you can collect 5, logout and repeat after an hour. I think the 5 dungeon/hour continues even when logged out, the buff duration dont.
---
All kidding aside the modifier is probably just the sex of your character. But it just comes off really snarky the way it's structured lol
---
its been called VC since vanilla on Mannoroth
---
So do you equip it use the proc then switch back to your regular weapon?
---
you can start attacking right away, just attack the mob the tank is attacking. Don't start cleaving until 5 seconds in because there's no way the tank can out threat a DPS's cleave on pull. Warrior tanks can whirlwind on pull which is pitiful aoe threat, and then need to tab target and apply a stack of sunder armor to each mob in order to hold threat.
---
I hope the Evenless guy is a Porcupine Tree reference
---
It's free roll just like all BoE Epics in pugs.
---
It took me like 2 mins to find the 4th one
---
Mages get BiS water in DM but no gear is BiS there.
---
i always thought this was a retail thing, making NPCS giant for no reason
---
lol I do the same with hamstring. They'll kill me but at least they'll be slow walking their way around for the next little while.
---
People forget that leveling is 90% of the game in classic so they rush through it and end up in your position unfortunately.
---
Exactly.  Tanks and healers stick together.  I carry a stack of water for my healers just in case they run out.  Treat the healer right and you'll live longer :)
---
I have issues with hyper aggressive gnome mages. Once I see that frostbolt chunking 33 percent of my hp, movement speed debuff I stop bothering anymore.
---
That's refreshing.
---
Damn that’s too real
---
that's because when you make a new character, warrior is the first on the list.  my bank alt is a warrior, all my name reserve toons are warriors.  i am just too lazy to care to switch to a different class.
---
my main is a warrior too thought :D
---
Can someone explain to me how this affects gameplay?
---
YEAH!!!!
---
You're right. It's flipped back and forth through the years for PVP balance.
---
This wasn't patched until TBC but it also wasn't common knowledge at all. If people had been abusing it in vanilla (like they are certainly going to in classic) they would have hotfixed it back then. I hope they make this an exception because it's going to completely fuck up the game otherwise.
---
Fuuckkk stop going through my post history!!
---
Nice I like that
---
I think that is the thing, when I was lvling, the tanking gear went to tanks in instances, and because I was rushing to 60 to raid (I did MC 4 hours after hitting 60), I did not do any quest that did not offer up a prebis fury set.
---
And as such, even now my tank set includes lvl 55 green plates.
---
But it should go to MT automatically
---
so you have nothing? just character attacks then?
---
these are actually very useful. not like the other clickbait WoW videos from other youtubers. been looking at these starting from BRD and up. i appreciate all your work.
---
i am an unguilded warrior tank and get whispers all the time to join guilds.  like personalized hey dude i see you're guildless, are you looking for a guild whispers.
---
Nah that’s you
---
Did the quest today aswell and thought the same thing. Same with Rexxar.
---
He’s an absolute unit.
---
Not necessarily defending the decision, but it wasn’t “for no reason.”
---
It was to make them easier to see and make people crowding all over them less of an issue.
---
You only need 2 tanks in a raid right now. That's 1 in 20 players. For a 5 man group 1 in 5 are tanks. There is a reason for the tank shortage and it seems obvious to me...
---
Some enchants were counting as buffs and going against the maximum amount of buffs you can have.
---
&gt;i understand that if we're playing the game with NO CHANGES then 1.12 "balance" is wrong
---
Patch 1.12 is what we got, so the balance is correct if it's based on 1.12. 
---
Simple.

---
You send them a message and literally just ask if they're doing okay. You don't need a wiki on how to talk to your friends.
---
You have a 32 buff limit, and with enchants taking up slots, people would have very expensive/time-consuming buffs fall off randomly since every HoT and such is its own buff, etc. Now it shouldn't be as much of an issue.
---
Ah I didnt even consider that! I was so use to being a tank back in the day, I never even considered the ramifications of going dps. 
---
Man, I really don't want to spam chat all day looking for a group.
---
Why can't blizzard just put death knights in classic? Hahaha
---
If you find a tank buddy, drop runs in DM are still very profitable.
---
If anything, this is good news for holy priests because hunters, mages and warlocks won't get rich and inflate the market. Priests and tanks can still farm DM very well, albeit in a duo.
---
Well of course, nobody is gonna do this every single week or anything like that, but your main tank having that much AP and stamina would be amazing for a lot of bosses, i'm thinkin' about patchwerk here. I hope this does stay, because I wanna see what speedrunners can do with this plus all the tricks they already have
---
It released literally today.
---
They can eadily tell lol...but it's allowed so it doesn't matter
---
its strange, ive been trying for a while but every time i queue up my HS after my MH attack, it just skips over my OH and uses it when my MH attack rolls around again
---
Look at it this way: at 40-60 split, the majority has a 50% numerical advantage. If you are in the minority, you will be in perpetual 2v1s. Come phase 2, you will probably be unable to effectively level as a 30s warlock. 
---
OP, if you want to stay on that server, my advice is to reroll into a stealth class. Once you hit 60 on that, you can use that character to fuel your warlock into professions and consumables that are needed to help deal with those imbalances. 
---
Things on such servers might get easier once Phase 3 hits, but I wouldn’t count on it. I am not sure why Blizzard can’t or won’t put in appropriate controls or incentives to avoid this sort of thing on PVP realms.
---
The reck bomb guy was banned so I think it depends on the context.
---
Macro toolkit.
---
Expands the character limit.
---
I don't understand how people heal in this game anymore. I did a SM run and that was the end of my healing career. What a fucking joke this game has turned into.
---
Bis nice
---
Oh the seething sarcasm... Pulling 8+ mobs when your party is primarily composed of single target dps does not make things faster. People pulling threat off non marked mobs is taxing on the healer.
---
Efficient pulls are based around the structure of the party. As a tank you should enter a dungeon and test the waters, then adjust your strategy going forward.  If your healer has to drink after every fight, there's either an issue with their own personal triage, the pulls are too big for their (or your) gear to handle efficiently or alternatively, another weaker link in the party bogging them down such as a rogue attacking the ❌ instead of the 💀, I would tag that in with just shitty dps (if you're not doing any damage, or your damage is in the wrong place).
---
Classic Wow ain't just a bunch of people that migrated from Private Servers, so that rhetoric needs to be put to rest. Take your RP walking, 10 minute marking bullshit somewhere else; you're clearly part of the problem here.
---
ofc they would say they are ok. an alcoholic says hes okay, even when hes fully into his habits!
---
Until Diremaul, why would Deadmines be the only dungeon where people reference the end boss instead of dungeon name?
---
Isn’t hamstring spam fishing for sword spec/windfury procs with a 2h still semi-competitive, but only a horde option? 
---
It doesn’t beat fury, but it’s not like you’re a feral Druid
---
No, I never said that.
---
I'm saying the two aren't mutually exclusive.
---
Try using Healbot addon
---
Wait the ring is BoE?
---
You have to clear the instance for each time you get the buff. This is not a bug really, it worked this way back in the days and was even used in TBC. When it was heavily abused in TBC it got nerfed.
---
Instantly down voted as per usual on this sub

---
&gt;But I really don't understand this "your pain is my reward" thing, are you a sociopath?
---
that carries the implication you think pvpers are sociopaths. no reasonable person would interpret that any other way.  why pose the question if you dont believe it?
---
also stop with the armchair psychology bullshit you are pulling out your ass please. no professional is gonna take one throwaway line from a forum and conclude someones a sociopath, especially over a video game, which you might need to be reminded IS NOT REAL LIFE.  also did it ever occur to you hes not being 100% serious and is just having fun with you?
---
Thanks, i only thought enemies have a debuff limit, it's the first time i hear about a buff limit, but i makes sense to work both ways.
---
I think I have a compulsive twitch to Life Tap when I hear the healing sound -- I have to force myself to make sure I'm not at 10% health or 100% mana first.
---
Ya I don't have herbalism. Can you farm the lasher's with it? Or simply some some herbs on the way? 50g an hour is more than ok to me
---
I really believe you can, just that now there are more pats and they run faster, if you take care you can farm those lashers, dont know the exp/hour tho
---
Repentance enables you to double damage on judgement (of command), or get a cast off. Its kinda neat.
---
Hamstring fishing with a 2h is fine on horde, but you do it as fury
---
I got the addon, it has a lot of options, but I couldn't find the one that enabled mouseover. I still had to click.  
---
I just want the macro to do what I said in the post.
---
Your also forgetting the \*I HAVENT MAXED YET WTF BLIZZ STOP RUSHING!\*
---
Just because you disagree with someone’s opinion doesn’t mean you throw around “go back to retail” like a jackass.
---
Most dungeon groups run this way. All needing on valuable items cuts down on possibility of ninjaing. Not saying you have to do it that way, but a shitload of people do.
---
It’s not your way or play a different game.
---
Yeah!  The one that needs to get stomped on!
---
I saved a lot of quests until I hit 60 and did them then. You get around 4-5g per quest plus I sold everything I got from quests.
---
This is the result of a US President not standing up for American values. The erosion of western democratic principles are eroding in real time.
---
So what useful thing do you get? (lets say @ lvl 45)
---
I mean it was interesting but definitely not really humorous.
---
&gt; have two wait for two minutes for leadership to switch
---
I was told that you just put yourself in a raid with your alt, and make your alt the leader, then just log out of your main, log onto your alt and reset the dungeon, then log back onto your main.
---
Your strength of earth and grace of air will help the bear. Windfury will not.
---
Lol. I've always heard horror stories about this... I got it on my 3rd kill
---
Alchemy
---
I'm working and will get a 40 hour job after getting my second university degree but generally saying you have no respect for someone who plays all day is still close minded. You don't know what's going on in their lives, might not have much else going for them. Also not everyone is brainwashed into loving the 9 to 5 world which is the biggest grind in history.
---
Doesn’t mean they’ll get to play the role they want though, that’s their problem.
---
I think this guy is mad coz he is a retail player and that side of the game is dead.
---
Classic is going great tho.
---
*laughs in warrior*
---
*cries in person who works 40 hrs a week and understands*
---
Probably because I do most of my levelling with a friend I have not been opened up on. Last night though a rogue and a warlock tried to fuck me up because my pocket healer priest was not in sight. Killed them pretty easily. They came back for more and we killed them again. Both gnomes.
---
Warcraft is rock paper scissor and I think warlocks are supposed to beat shadow priests.  Just like warriors are supposed to beat warlocks.
---
Lol generic huntercomment :P - So everyone should be free to roll on the leaf if it was BOE?
---
Pretty sht attitude, good luck finding tanks if this is your approach.
---
Rexxar is (correctly) massive and tall as a mountain. He's half orc/half ogre.
---
Thats what she said.
---
I !think! the duration shown on the debuff is not the actual time im cced. So a sap in pvp lasts about 5-7 seconds.
---
Does only DM East have a bunch of mining nodes? (Im a miner)
---
Well you kinda post this bs and it shows up, so...yeah.
---
That’s fantastic! I want to try it out!
---
"People spec accordingly, and that’s why no one is tanking BRD"
---
You can tank brd in any warrior spec
---
That's not a troll. That's a market manipulation. A troll would be a dude with tusks who instigates other people to overreact. This is not that.
---
No you didn't. Link or never happened, i was trying to be reasonable with you but all you do is deny the reality.
---
It drops.
---
Inventory full.
---
Oh it definitely won't affect the majority, if it stays I know my guild will use it lightly (I.E. buffing our main tank with a bunch of stacks but nobody else), having that many more thousands of hp would be very useful for a lot of tank mechanics and pulls, and that AP will help threat gain so dps can begin sooner. I'll begin leveling a warlock after my druid alt hits 60 personally if this stays to speed this up.
---
I hope this does stay, because I love watching speedruns
---
 I too only have 5 and 5 in disc and shadow and dumped the rest in holy. Would love to know what else you specialized in the holy tree? i’m only 33 at the moment.
---
Ummm Ackshully, AD sells Enriched Manna Biscuits not water. *slurp*
---
I don't really care though, I'm not interested in judging people for how they live their lives unless they hurt others than themselves
---
Unique npcs and bosses are large, i am okay. But in some later expansions every single thing is ridiculously huge.
---
No way, man. It’s still the same way it’s always been—people have nolifed to 60 and are bored already. Leveling is a massive part of the Classic experience. 
---
I picked a class / faction on launch to complement what my friends were going to pick. They all stopped playing as much, so the other night I went, “fuck it”, deleted my toon, and swapped to the faction and class I wanted. I’m taking it slow leveling, reading quest text, enjoying the zones, taking time out to fish and cook, exploring, meeting people, and I’m having WAY more fun. I’m only level 20 and it’s leagues better than when I was “keeping up” with everyone else.
---
As a DPS, I definitely spend most of my playtime waiting for a tank to join my dungeon groups, but I haven't encountered any of those awful groups you describe. I've spammed UD strat for a week now, where more than half the pulls are LoS pulls, and in about 30 runs there has never been a single dps who jumped the gun and went against the tank's plans. 
---
Reading through those horror stories in the comments now, I can't really explain my luck. It's not like they were guild runs, I'm just pure pugging most of the time, and the vast majority of dungeons are clean and deathless. Anyone else feels in the same boat?
---
I agree about the tank and healer setting the pace.  I don't give a whatever about a DPS who needs to drink, you're out of combat, drink.  If they type in chat that they want me to hold off pulling until they can drink back up, I'll just laugh and pull.  What are they going to do?  Leave the group?  Oh no, a DPS just left, what on Earth shall I do?!!
---
I agree, I find swipe not to be enough most of the time.  Maybe if the dps gives me time, but let's be real.
---
Tab maul is what I usually do, swipe when I'm overflowing with rage.
---
I’m quite curious about the result! Feel free to add a comment and share you opinion OP :)
---
why all this people complaining about pserver comparisons, we have been playing this game almost two months, yes mf we know vanilla and pservers are different, stop the critics
---
&gt; So everyone should be free to roll on the leaf if it was BOE?
---
Yes, everyone should
---
&gt; Pretty sht attitude, good luck finding tanks if this is your approach.
---
?? "People should share the wealth that drops in dungeons" is a shit attitude?
---
Run Classic servers for people who want to stay on them. Make expansion servers that people can one-way port their characters onto if desired.
---
Blizzard is going to have to run sufficient servers for its user base anyhow. They can adjust proportions to fit demand.
---
As with any expensive BoE, its always a need.  I can buy an epic mount, Krol Blade, Nightslayer BoEs or more with that.
---
Yeah but I mean Pyromancer after you pickpocket through arena.
---
you sap one add and blind the other then burn him down before looting and vanishing.
---
For the bar guy you buy the beer off of him and use it to lure the adds near him away to kill them then you pull him back near the dark iron rep guy and just LOS his spells.

Have you heard of cream filled donuts? It's just mana cream, and a biscuit instead of a donut. That's my headcanon
---
No actually it's just horrible
---
Large Seaforium should do the trick
---
Checking your post history reveals you're basically salty on every "I got this"-post on this sub... what's your problem dude? Lost one too many rolls lately? Christ...
---
Posting that "nobody cares" while you care enough to do this shit over and over again ;)
---
People are exaggerating how bad it is. It's easily doable on a priest with 6000+ mana. Gold/h should be around 50g from what I've seen so far, if you have access to lvl 55 water. You do need herbalism to make the most of the run though, and it is somewhat dependant on AH prices.
---
Thats why i play night elf warrior. Shadowmeld lets you initiate fights against most people.
---
Kill them first, then see if they're hostile or not. Its that kind of world...
---
I'm not mad, I am amused at your indignant rage at "this guy on his fucking high horse"
---
Not getting rustled...just pointing it out. After all, it's the little things we all do that ultimately lead to how society looks at marginalized groups buuuut probably not a topic of conversation for a WoW sub.
---
Spelling was never a strong point with me

Bonecrusher, 30 str + 1% crit. It’s a quest reward.
---
If I'm less than 70% damage taken I know there's an issue in the group.  Great groups will have me at 80%+.
---
Could you though? There's a x32 buff limit. At best, that's 6400 attack power + whatever you have on your gear. Remember, you can't use any other buffs. Let's call it \~7,500 AP total.
---
Classes that can heal can't stand in melee range of Rag because of the knockback. So you would basically have to kill Rag before he kills you. Not happening with only \~7,500 AP. Not even close.
---
The best case scenario IMO would be that you get a few supercharged DPS so you can 5-10 man raids. Then split your normal raid group into multiple smaller groups, allowing you to multiply your loot for the week. Given how impractical that is, I could see Blizzard leaving this in place. But I wouldn't be surprised if they fixed it either.
---
You don't have to respect it, you just don't have to talk shit
---
This isn't a controversial statement, let people live their own lives
---
All my friends wanted horde. I am now 60 rogue on horde side. All my 5 friends stopped playing.  
---
I wish I was ally.
---
On top of that, i can't find a single guild that wants a rogue.. I can't raid anything since no one will have me. Fml fml fml.
---
There's no videos of Dire Maul from 2004, it didn't even come out until March 2005.
---
@OP if you find more Apes content, please post to reddit,
---
This quest only took me about 20 minutes! I just went around by the giant Elites and killed Water elementals rather than the shitty salt spray elementals.
---
Maybe they’ll make the mage trinket use useful
---
Damn dude that actually made me chuckle
---
I got this part, all good. You're missing the modifier and the correct display of the other tooltip
---
Is this local or server time, as I noticed the clock in game is an hour ahead of my local time?
---
The problem wasn't him dying too fast (usually). It's that he had very little threat generation. Let alone the dps pulling aggro from him, I pulled heal aggro from him on pretty much every pull (and I was using fade basically on cooldown). The dps could wait for him to get 3 sunders on skull, and then when they opened up theyd immediately pull aggro. 
---
Sweeping strikes + cleave is huge for generating aggro on multiple mobs when you're arms. He seemed to be following the protection build tank rotation, but he wasn't prot. He also had thrash blade, which is very slow and isn't the best for generating rage.
---
If you think that keeping all the devilsaurs in a corner sheeped isn't a troll god help you. It is also market manipulation but it is definitely a troll too.
---
doesn't in any way disprove what i said
---
saying "patch 1.12 is what we got" is like saying the sky is purple now
---
it's not the point being argued at all
---
There is a lot of good stuff in here.
---
I am a 59 warrior who leveled solo and guildless as arms. I'm looking to tank. I can read up on mechanics like you have posted, gear, guides, etc but I have a few things holding me back:
---
"Leading" the group makes me a bit anxious as I have never played these classic dungeons. I don't know where to go, what the bosses are, where the keys and that kind of thing is. 
---
Lastly, sometimes I want to think less when I do a dungeon and so tanking takes more mental effort. I think I can solve this just by doing it a lot of times and it becoming second nature.
---
Any advice how to get over the "goalie" feeling that everything rests on your shoulders? Your team can play great all the time but if you mess up, its over ( at least, it feels like!)
---
Check again, he got instant ingore reply , that means he was on that list before op whispered the dude
---
Private servers were wrong isn’t a nerf. Stop using that language.
---
Beware the living!
---
You have under 20g to your name, sell it unless you plan on Twinking, and start saving buy mats for your epic mount and/or crafted 40's Spellpower set.
---
Hey I don’t care either.
---
Ultimately it doesn’t bother me how people spend their time, but idk it just seems weird seeing people justify “unhealthy” behaviors. You’ll find the same people in r/2007scape trying to say someone grind 10hrs a day all day is totally NORMAL AND FINE. 
---
I’m all for doing what you enjoy but man someone spending all their waking hours playing Classic WoW is yikes.
---
Tbh Classic WoW doesn’t even have enough content in it to warrant playing 4+ hours a day. What’s the rush? The game is archaic and min maxed to hell. Why people feel the need to invest all their waking time into it is beyond me.
---
Yulp, this is why i burnt out in original TBC after tanking in vanilla and bc. I was at a point where i only wanted to tank with friends/guild (and even the guild would annoy me at times) so i rerolled.
---
What are you finding hard while levelling? I might be able to offer some tips if you'd like?
---
Earthfury is about as close to 50/50 as it gets (NA-PvP). The last census was 47/53 and while it is dated, the balance seems right around that even today.
---
We used to be as close to 50/50 as you could get. Are they really dropping? Was hoping it'd stay 50/50 for pvp when it releases
---
Any totems that give weapon effects won't work on bears
---
How can we trust that someone will say they are going to use it and not just turn around and put it on the AH in a couple days after the dust settles? It's not like a BOE item that you could instantly equip to prove you are going to use it.
---
Most people aren't willing to take that risk in a pug. That's where this line of thinking comes from. If it was a trusted guild run it would be different.
---
go ahead and post the "two posts from june 2005" that you think support your claim
---
so i can rip your ignorance a new asshole
---
I didn't state a viewpoint. I asked a question, and raised a hypothetical situation where a hunter could end up with this item wherein a PUG did not lay out a proper loot system.
---
Yes, the item would benefit some classes more than the hunter. But if the system is set up that everyone gets to roll, should you opt to not roll to be nice to a class who could get more benefit? Or should you roll because it's still an obvious upgrade? I could see both sides here.
---
Exactly.  We all do that once to get the quests out of the way and then never go back.
---
Nah it definitely lasts ages, had a few trinkets stolen that way. Every few seconds it rolls a dice to see if you "resisted" it, so if you're lucky it can break really early. Same with polymorph, etc.
---
As a rogue of 15 years, if you cannot do amazing DPS without pulling aggro you are straight up awful at your class. The energy and combo point system combined with having feint and vanish leaves no excuse.
---
Unfortunately there are just endless terrible rogues out there who cannot handle the thought of a mage getting more damage than them on an AoE pull or whatever.
---
Hell while tanking on my Druid I had a rogue who kept bugging me for thorns... dude WHY ARE YOU GETTING HIT?! He also stood in front of mobs and kept deliberately trying to pull them off me to “help”. Are people actually this clueless about how various classes work? I’m tanking! I want them to hit me! Just stab! Only stab!
---
I cannot imagine how poorly this game would have gone if it had launched a few patches earlier, at a time where all these “pull everyone NOW” morons would have simply been deleted from existence every single pull.
---
My alt is ele and would love the shit out of that
---
Apparently there are 5. Good luck
---
Are transfers gone?
---
The range on the mobs have most definitively been increased to stop solo runs.
---
happy cake day &amp; without a full UI (buffs) i think this is the case as well
---
It's basically the pally shitty version of ankh.  Instead of paladins being able to rez themselves on a cooldown,  they have the same cooldown to kill themselves and bubble a party/raid member for 3 minutes where they can't attack or interact but they are also removed from combat for the entire 3 mins.  
---
So essentially wipe protection, but the pally has to use it on someone before he dies (and it kills the paladin in the process and uses a reagent).
---
It can be funny in pvp though because you can't purge it, you can't even attack it the person who's DIed comes up as neutral to you.  And it kinda looks like a paladin bubble so sometimes you'll get someone using it on someone outside horde bank on the mailbox or such.
---
On private servers when me and a friend were bored we'd use invis pots to get thru into org and then he'd DI me dancing ontop of the bank mailbox naked.  Horde would be treated to a naked dwarf dance show for 3 minutes, when it expired I'd bubble and hearth out :P

This is what you have to have to be hitcapped as a night elf or orc (dwarf too since no viable guns).

With Striker's you can do this for alliance:

Difference of 40 AP
---
Bit more than the 22 ap you get for warriors
---
Okay, thanks
---
keyring when?
---
No, no it isn't Pre raid BiS.... there's a quested Ring that flat out beats this. This might be 4th best depending on how you factor in stats.
---
BiS for 39 Twinks, sure.
---
I did. Like a long time ago. Guess you didn’t click the link.
---
Shocker.

Hi, /u/Kodos-

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/difkam/which_is_easier_or_more_fun_to_level_warrior_or/). 
---
Limited enemy types. For me I’d rather have divine focus
---
Blizza.... Oh you mean China banned him. Makes sense
---
Have deleted and recreated alot of characters since launch , still cant decide what to play on a PvP server.
---
I want to play something different and narrowed it down to mage or warlock but cant decide
---
I mean that’s the directions from a quest in Desolace
---
Vibrant plumes have a 33% chance to drop... you'd expect to see one after 3 kills.
---
There’s some leather AP legs from a boss in mara. I forget which. They looked interesting.
---
That's something someone made up after the fact, it is not the origin of the term.
---
Mage is your best bet.
---
My suggestion go a hybrid shatter/AOE build and focus on dungeons/questing until the 30s. AOE grinding in the 20s is tough.
---
 what if what you want is the quelserrar book?
---
What gear, spec are you having for this? I tried doing ZF as mage, but I'm going oom before the mobs are at even 50% hp.
---
From what I've seen, they are easier to kill than on pservers. I don't even need to use pw: shield when I holy nova a pack. The healing from holy nova is enough to keep my hp steady. Not sure how it is for other classes though.
---
yikes.. ur shit prob has so many problems/bugs
---
quit wasting time and do it again
---
you have nothing to hide, right?
---
Warrior or Rogue.. Which is easier or more fun to level? I'm on a PVE server.
---
This is cute
---
zero, everyone's still addicted.
---
Lol, your post history makes replying to this with any sort of coherent argument for why you're a bigot unnecessary. I think you know :P
---
Phase 2
---
Yeah, warlocks, especially SL warlocks blow spriests out of the water IMO. Sustainability kings.
---
Use the other entrance. You can easily jump down from there.
---
Nope, not a single person said that.
---
First, this is a simplified version of your current macro.  
---
    #showtooltip [noequipped:shield] Pummel; Shield Bash
---
    /cast [noequipped:shield] Berserker Stance; [noform:1/2] Battle Stance
---
    /cast [noequipped:shield] Pummel; Shield Bash
---
Here is a mouseover version:
---
    /cast [noequipped:shield,@mouseover,harm,nodead] Pummel; [@mouseover,harm,nodead] Shield Bash
---
And finally, here is a mouseover version that will hit your target if you don’t have a mouseover: 
---
    /cast [noequipped:shield,@mouseover,harm,nodead][noequipped:shield,harm,nodead] Pummel; [@mouseover,harm,nodead][harm,nodead] Shield Bash
---
If this macro is too long, you can remove the harm and nodead conditions. They really aren’t needed because you can’t Shield Bash or Pummel a dead or helpful target anyway. 
---
If you need help understanding how this macro works, just ask.
---
i love this and it's incredibly fun to do for me and i love the fact that i can run whatever weapons i can get my hands on for leveling or dpsing
---
So being traded by someone with no name is normal? even when they didnt trade back?
---
As a warrior tank who wants the quel serrar book, ill probably do 90% guuld runs from now on in Dire maul because i cant trust pugs to pass on it for me.
---
this hasn't been my experience, maybe it's something specific to that zone?
---
if I'm following someone and they are being chased, when they mob decides to say "fuck it," it simply runs back to where it was when it started.  even going so far as to run right through me while ignoring me.  
---
did you throw the guy a heal, or do something else to get on their threat list?
---
Yawn
---
Server.
---
They’re tanking for guildies imo.
---
This is how we feel about Nightelf rogues, fuck rogues.
---
Same, I'm Horde and it very much feels 50:50.
---
Maybe it will sway to 55:45 or even 40:60 over the months/year, but it would be still very balanced.
---
Just play your mage and get over it. Respeccing only takes 15 gold and if you really are into aoe farming you won’t even worry about that
---
You can’t really AOE farm until like 24-26 on a mage. Watch people like Xaryu and Venruki for mage stuff. Mage is probably what you want to play based on your statements you just haven’t gotten far enough into classic yet
---
I’ll give you a hint: it’s the same place you got your quote from 2006
---
I think it's just a super cheap way to make something impressive.
---
I always like to just find a good spot and grind mobs for a few hours. Makes you tons of gold and nice steady xp. I would suggest desolace or Arathi
---
&gt;but there's a decent number of toxic posts at this point.
---
I agree there's a fair amount of toxic posts at this point.
---
But a lot of those are after the OP has expressed their distaste for someone not liking their 'achievement', and started the toxic discusisons. 
---
Looking at the top 3 "don't care" posts, they're not initially toxic beyond expressing their apathy:
---
&gt;Nobody cares man
---
Then OP goes on a sarcastic rant and saying things like "holy shit so mad" after people keep mentioning they don't care. 
---
&gt;I like how OP is trying to defend himself to people that literally don't care. Which is probably everyone. its fine to be proud of something but no one cares.  
---
Then OP responds with calling those people "pricks".
---
&gt;Not world first, also you forget classic was out 15 yrs ago, also nobody gives a damn
---
Then OP responds with "did your therapist cancel" after the poster says how only he cares about his class mount. 
---
Just seems like the OP could have handled this better, but instead it blew up into a shit storm because they wanted people to care about something they didn't give two shits about.
---
It takes around 6-8 days played
---
Today I opened trade with myself somehow. I was equally as confused as this post
---
unless its a guild run and agreed before time its all need...
---
Also lol at incoming "compendium reserved" spam in chat.
---
What fucking shitty guild gave it to a hunter over a melee? Leave that stupid guild
---
What kind of monster doesn't teach his kid to sheep moon?
---
Someone call child protective services...
---
My friend somehow hit 60 with over 400g and then got a freezing band to drop not even 3 days after hitting 60.  I told him he has to farm another because I'm going to need a loan ;P
---
You're right. PvP servers are yawn-worthy. Thank you for agreeing with me.
---
Players don't sign up on a PvP server to get ganked.
---
They sign up to gank people.
---
If the server is unbalanced on their side, they stay.
---
If the server is unbalanced on the other side, they transfer, reroll or find something else to do.
---
This is why all PvP servers tend to be unbalanced.
---
I could be wrong, but I'd guess it would depend on whether you're fighting a single target, or a pack.
---
Mage is best for aoe farming. Hunters can solo some dungeon bosses for farming as can warlocks. I would roll a lock if it were me. They can solo princess for farming and excel in pvp and leveling.
---
Also farming with any class doesn't shine till later levels. 20 is too early for any class to really farm efficient.
---
Once you get to 40 a lot of the classes start to open up and are a lot more fun to play.
---
Lost maybe half of the initial 10 or so folks I was playing with before the Hearthstone GM debacle, the rest of us bailed after that.
---
So scroll hot, where the vetted threads show up. They should be to your standards.
---
The post about keyring being added did not say "phase 2".
---
Also there's no point in delaying it until phase 2 because it's not content, and should have been in at launch.
---
My rogue just got an undead boner
---
While not technically BiS sublime wrists are very good and don't rely on nearly as much RNG as the true BiS (3.4% of a 'Frozen Wrath' suffix roll)
---
&gt; The fact that you have a very high drop rate BiS bow
---
Again your argument is based on the assumption the bow drops, which is does not. Only a part drops. Sure it's great if your guild has a policy leaf+sinew, however like I said that's not something that applies to everyone.
---
&gt; The fact that striker's is not/barely better than your prebis is a good argument.
---
It IS better though, that's the point. How much better is still not clear.
---
&gt; Striker's is BiS for 2 other classes all the way til AQ/Naxx
---
Again you keep throwing this "BiS" around. Hand of justice is "BiS" for alliance hunters,, should we take it from melee?
---
&gt;90% of your loot is rhok and tier gear
---
Didn't you JUST say the following:
---
&gt; Imagine thinking youre supposed to wear your full tier 1 set to optimize DPS.
---
The amount of hypocrisy from you is insane.
---
I'll have to agree to disagree, this has not been my experience.
---
Also, a sunder on each target takes a maximum of 5 seconds, definitely not the end of the world for DPS to wait for 5 seconds to make the pull feel better for everyone.
---
Yeah 40-45% physical damage reduction, self heals that directly scale with your damage output, and a fear bomb is a great deterrent.
---
Lmao please cite 50-60 in one day now
---
Skeram is a shithole. Horde on that server are toxic AF
---
&gt;  might not have much else going for them.
---
Which is not going to change if they spend 12+ hours a day playing WoW.
---
Addiction is difficult to deal with. I will respect and, if I can, help anyone who is trying to break out of that, but there is nothing respectable about being addicted to WoW.
---
&gt; temporary upgrade/downgrade
---
That makes 0 sense.
---
Oh man, thank you so much for this! That's exactly the kind of math I was looking for.
---
i'll give you a hint. until you post here whichever quotes you THINK support your claim, this conversation is over
---
"i posted a link to ALL the comments!" is not an argument
---
post it here if you have nothing to fear. we'll see if you're a man or a mouse
---
PVE. I’d probably say hunter. Rogue is more fun for PVP IMO
---
Take my updoot, you monster.
---
What? Absorbing 1k damage is way more useful than +20 attack power or some other useless crap. And even if a 60 doesn't need it, it's incredible on twinks, and people will bring 60s to help them get it. You should never expect to win it on a leveling character.
---
Pretty sure you can run in.  Talk to the boss.  Then go get the buffs.
---
No no no, you use it on a DPS that is about to break a record on Patchwerk!
---
Excellent! Congratulations :)
---
LOL. This is so on point. 
---
As a druid on a PVP server I have been having a blast leveling. I may not win every fight but I didn't die either. I'll just run away and track you down in a bit.
---
They fell off the tram on the way to IF from SW? What the fuck else could take them that long?! Hahaha
---
you disgust me on a primal level
---
Ok, I understand. Thanks for the answer.
---
They'll probably go with the 1.12 version, yeah.
---
....but then again, we don't have Eternal Quintessence, so they might go with the old version until we hit phase 6.
---
why do you say this, its not nerfed. its the 1.12 version.   
---
Are you comparing it to private servers ? Because they even had the pathing of the mobs wrong, what is to say items drops where not wrong also.
---
Yeah I’ve seen a few on my AH between 800g-1,200g
---
Are you 12 or something? Of course its requirement all around the world to have a sick note even if its only 1 day
---
FALSE! The epic one with the special effects is truly EPIC
---
The Epic Skeletal Warhorse is the best looking mount in the game aside from the Stratholme mount that looks very similar
---
Slightly off-topic but HOW DO YOU ADD A GUILD TO KOS?? It's mentioned in the docs and I've seen people mention it but I can't find a howto or anything about it actually in game with it
---
How does one see the armour values though?
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/perl-classic-unit-frames
---
I remember using xperl way back when.  This might be similar, I'm not 60 yet so I haven't worried about getting this installed.  Hope this helps
---
You realise SS alone is better than the entire prot tree for 5mans right?
---
Yeah, pretty much. I'm kinda surprised you got my message... So bravo for that! For someone of your IQ, that must have been quite difficult.
---
Which items? How do we know which items to hold onto like this?
---
Disagree, but thats fine. I personally am more of a nightsaber/wolf guy.
---
This is the always sunny ad right.  Haha glorious.
---
You can't just go around telling people our god damn secrets
---
loch modan is aesthetically one of the best zones in the game. That's why I like it.
---
Westfall is shit. Darkshore and Ashenvale are good, very underrated. But after 20 levels in those zones (I am low 30's now), I'm sort of glad to be out.
---
Lol I’m already level 9 on an Undead Lock on a server that’s like 55% horde
---
I know at least 1 group of APES players laid claim to Winterfall Village and grinded there for a couple of weeks
---
No oomo!
---
So he just sits there while you kite princess? Seems strange
---
I’m with you mom you should move out
---
Fun to level deff goes to the rogue
---
I see. I wonder why he ignored me since i never met him, but thanks anyway.
---
I'd be more worried about the population of zombie raptors in arathi highlands. I had to kill about 30 of those fuckers before I got the 12 hearts I needed.
---
Why people must be so toxic and downvote a simple question?
---
I've never had problems with warlocks. And quite frankly have found them to be a relief when I notice someone is trying to gank me. All that time and mana spent getting your dots on me just for me to take them all out with dispel magic.
---
Probably going to get abused and nerfed soon.
---
2 simple rules, kill the tank's target, don't heal dps (except for obviously when there is some aoe damage)
---
The reason it's hard to find tanks is because once they find a handful of good people to run with, they GTFO the toxic pug life and only run with confirmed decent players
---
You ll have to go masterlooter the whole dungeon. If you want to secure it.
---
Lol reserving boe in a dungeon pug.  Get a guild group willing to farm it for you.
---
I would reserv the book every group. If not people will roll on it.
---
I asked him if there was even a semblance of what they were accusing happened. I've known this guy for 15 years. If he was reported for language, fair enough. I can believe that. But for him to have his account perma-banned for something he was obviously joking about is a bit much.
---
We had a guildmate banned earlier last month for using too many computers combined with a VPN when he was trying to stay in game while at work. He appealed and failed his appeal and has been sitting on his account until it gets banned in 2 weeks. That situation is crappy but I understand how it looks.
---
This one terrifies me because I joke about stuff time to time too.
---
The specific 30 feral 21 resto that's used for team pvp is a pure counter to everything mage.  The spec is meant to be excel at running flags and being a PITA.
---
\*looks at my Warlock's skills*
---
yeah that's gonna be a no from me dawg
---
Thunderfurry is close to 50/50. It's pretty wild out there some places. Last census I seen had more alliance playing than horde but more consistent data shows its 55/45 in hordes favour
---
Blizzard's definition of "botting" includes ANY kind of automation, including auto-clickers.
---
Playing with friends &gt; playing with randos.
---
That’s disrespectful dude... classic is all about helping people out and making friends along the way

But why would you suggest someone new to the game to grind instances instead of questing and meeting people along the way? 
---
Grind totally has it's place but it's not the kind of experience I'd advocate to a newcomer. "Just grind 10 levels". What a horrible experience.
---
Yea if you've done it 10 times I can see why you just wanna be done with it but for a newbie? Go quest and meet people.
---
Did they get rid of transfers? I am an ally on Kirtonos and I do not have the ability to transfer anymore.
---
This gear list has immediate problems. 
---
So you are giving up devilsaur gauntlets , 1 crit, 28 AP, and 2 hit, for the 3 hit from trueaim.  So youre up 1 hit and down 1 crit 28 AP.
---
Because of this, you are able to wear Mark of Tyranny, trading 1 crit and 2 hit for 40 AP. So now you are up 12 AP, down 2 crit, down 1 hit. So you are having to wear slashclaw to get your last hit, which is even further of a shit tradeoff. Then you claim that you are able to trade off slashclaw for giantstalkers. Well, no, you are just wearing the wrong gear. You shouldn't need strikers to wear giantstalkers bracers at all.
---
If you geared correctly then you would just be straight up up across the board. You gain 2 crit from devilsaur and more AP from giantstalkers than you lost from taking off tyranny. 
---
12 AP isn't worth 2 crit. You should be wearing actual prebis. Devilsaur gauntlets and mask of the unforgiven. Not Trueaim and Tyranny. 
---
Fix your set and then show me what you would be replacing. Nice try, though.

Looking For Group: Dire Maul East, The One Witout the Old Defias Brotherhood, Not The One With The Ogres And Not The One In Westfall
---
The best I could do.
---
If they wanna run it with him they can. Get over yourself
---
Or the Pservers had it wrong.
---
It's like 55% Horde, I wouldn't call that "vastly outnumbered", also there are a lot more skilled players/guilds on the alliance side from what I can tell.
---
ally can do that. Teldrasil -&gt; darkshore -&gt; ashenvale for levels 1-30. 
---
It's just not popular at all for whatever reason (far from deadmines, no one likes darnassus, few people run BFD).
---
Horde probably
---
So mages should greed if teebuz drop? Thats a 6k+ gold sword
---
Its a downgrade if your good at the game. Its an upgrade if your bad.
---
Most rewarding role in the game. People desire you and shower you with praise of you do it right.
---
Stop letting bad players bother you. Just grow thick skin and it becomes extremely enjoyable.
---
If some DPS is driving you crazy, either put up with it or ask them to stop. If they don’t or get mouthy, threaten to leave if they don’t get kicked. 
---
Trust me if your a half decent tank, they will be kicked.
---
So how much gold did you send yourself?
---
Fuck you're both retarded
---
Hey maybe before you go off insulting people you should actually understand what you're talking about?
---
1. Blizzard does not ban addons, they remove their ability to do what they do. 
---
2. This addon parses the combat log, something they aren't removing. Unless you expect them to ban DBM as well.
---
3. The addon has been around in one way or another for years and never been removed.
---
Whining about it on here is *not* going to get it "banned" because it's exactly the kind of addon that is allowed. It takes what your character can "see" and displays it so you can read it better. 
---
So yes.. whining on reddit is only ever going to result in more people downloading it. It's going nowhere.
---
Nope. Classic made that shit hard for people. People take a lot for granted in retail.
---
I thought they made it so you can do cat form in 1.12 but I guess it was either another later patch or something...or they haven’t fully turned on 1.12 yet...like only certain mechanics or something.
---
What the FUCK
---
Crazy, i can't believe blizz only makes blue posts surrounding major patch/game releases and occasional bug fixes. Who would do such a thing?
---
Are you from Everlook? Seen both bindings drop in one raid.
---
Perfect thats what i was lookin for thanks a ton.
---
While we are at it can they make it so I can use my dots in a raid 😂
---
Just did DME jump runs with Warrior Paladin and Mage. It was exactly as easy as on private servers. 
---
It all looked very doable without mage. Will investigate tomorrow.
---
Or you know the other utility they also provide... but sure...
---
Point being you’ve got a flexible background to work with. You can’t expect to be pure DPS, but they offer some awesome DPS/Heal hybrid capability...
---
But sure.
---
Oh very! The menu is quite easy to navigate. If you have any questions please let me know. I can take the generic configuration and turn it into what you see in about 5 mins. It's not difficult at all. Make sure you enable advanced settings in the general tab.
---
Dammit if I had known it was that easy...
---
lol I hear you. I dont mind that much though. I've fished several gold worth of Oily Blackmouth while running up and down the coast.
---
No idea, im still sticking to my idea of the worlds slowest circle jerk.
---
yay bofe tarde
---
&lt;giggle&gt;
---
&lt;fart&gt;
---
Bro just sell it and enjoy the quality of life knowing you don't have to worry about gold
---
And you weren't melee'd from 20y by Taurens.  
---
And the servers didn't basically crash when large scale PVP battles start  
---
Thanks to blizz for doing classic, but it's got a lot of problems
---
My guild is small. Just a bunch of RL friends and we dont always have the same schedule because of work and family.
---
Is the idea of the warrior tank reserving loot so bad? Its literally the only thing i could see as an upgrade right now, that is within my means, according to various websites.
---
Ive completed my valor set which is more than enough for dungeons, plus i have a set of fire resist and other pre BIS gear from icy veins and wowhead alteady.
---
That’s 400-500g sell that
---
Do you know how to do a trib solo.run? Theres a door with 2 guards i cant get passed. Druid here
---
Yeah, I don’t blame you. The lot of a baby warlock on an outnumbered server is miserable.
---
Truth. It already is pretty insane. I am trying to get my ass out of heavy PvP zones. I don't want to still be questing when things really pop off.
---
As a healer, what should I do for locks that don’t eat any food? I was healing him between pulls because I saw the lock using health to tap mana.
---
He's one of the 40k orks, their bosses are da biggest simply because bigger is better
---
You realize private servers only ran on the 1.12 client right? They didn't try to replicate everything in the game as it was in 1.12 and this was on purpose. 1.12 may have been the most balanced patch in terms of class abilities and talents, but it had already taken a lot of what made vanilla what it was away in the form of nerfs and "catch-up" mechanics like updated dungeon gear stats that put some dungeon gear on par with MC/BWL stuff.
---
And yes, there are original videos out there showing what a lot of this stuff was like pre-nerf, which is what most pservers tried to replicate. Not the watered down 1.12 stats. Private servers are not the same as vanilla, but neither is Classic. If you think otherwise, I'm not sure what to say to you.
---
Perhaps I can get some help here - I got lorti UI, and want to use bartender. But the bartender addon removes the blackness from lorti Ui.. like it doesn't work together. Anyone know a solution? 
---
And also, I tried dominos, and it worked with lorti UI, but as bartender has an option to keep the blizzard UI, does anyone know If dominos can be on and still have the blizzard ui? 
---
My request is that I want an action bar addon so i can change my right action bars without fucking with the original blizzard UI! Anyone knows?
---
True. Since you know this is about making friends, don't you think it's dumb to post something like this in this sub? Lol
---
Rogue to both. Leveling a warrior sucks.
---
Great, I'll check it out. Thanks!
---
Lol
---
Maybe try rerolling before quitted
---
Jeez, this is intense! 
---
I had my first encounter with something similar in Durotar a couple nights back... Rogue passes, chased by Scorpids, grabbing the Herb Nodes I was fighting my way towards. But that was fine, it's all fair game. What peeved me off, was all of them turned onto me once he sprinted away. Try to run away, but the DoT got me.
---
Now that lasher farm isn't a thing anymore, what's the best farming method for mages at 60 during the current phase?
---
I've tried pawn, but it doesnt seem to be providing that functionality and I can't find anything obvious in the settings to turn it on
---
I probably played 5-6 hours a day on workdays (18:00 to midnight) and then longer on weekends. I hit 60 with around 8 days /played
---
Right now I have roughly 12 days /played. To which I can say, at least 1 full day (24 hours) is me not playing, but keeping the game online for guild chat / AH while I cook/clean. So I actually played less than you, despite being 60 and being fairly well geared already.
---
Ah, ok.  Correct.
---
It really is astounding how this is lost on so many people: you can pass judgement on others actions even if they are allowed. If you don't like it, don't do those things.
---
I can play on PvP servers and enjoy it, engage in world PvP, accept my gankings and carry on **all while** considering the people who go out to ruin others days to be sad and pathetic little children who get off on ruining other peoples days.
---
But no matter how often this is said, "PvPers" rush to scream "IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT GO TO PVE!!!". No. I like PvP and I accept that you can do what you're doing.. how about you accept that your actions will be judged?
---
Once to many for me.
---
... the Saurua must flow!
---
lashers are immune to nature so no point trying.
---
If the hype dies down i imagine blizz would merge some of the new pvp servers in with the old ones, the worry would be if you play on a pve server that could die. Medium will be no issue, but im talking in 2-3 months.
---
You can MT raids without prot if your gear and healers gear are on point. You’ll generate a ton of threat but tax your healers a lot
---
/sigh
---
That's really fucking sucks. Was looking forward to Dire Maul, guess there's really no reason to be.
---
So happy I play on a pve server
---
I will update you about ST and such. And I totally get that. I’m sure my tanking will have to change from 5 man to 10 man and I’m sure same from 20 to 40.
---
But thank you, I totally get it.
---
Speaking from zero exaggeration and weeks of experience. The zombies drop minimally 5-10s each, often more. There's way more than 20 of them, up to 3 at a time can pop from a single grave.
---
So I’ve installed DBM, but how should I configure it? My main is lvl 29 (I don’t have a lot of playing time) so I’m not in raids yet. Just dungeons. I also thought DBM can be used to track DPS In your group. How do you set that up? (Unless that’s another add on). Thanks.
---
Where are you getting your 80% Horde figure from? I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm definitely skeptical since human has pretty much always been the most popular race and they're Ally.
---
I know this feel.. I have invited a fresh batch of players to my guild in the hopes that they'll stick around. I have 60 players in my guild but more than half are totally inactive with the next 40% rarely logging in. 
---
At one point the guild was booming and filled with activity. Next week I have to start over and invite new, active players. Then another week goes by and my recent invites are all inactive. 
---
I feel like I restarted my guild 3 times now.
---
Should have been obvious when you could turn off xp in lich King and que only against other people whom chose that option(99% twinks) and the twink bracket instantly died.  Having to only play against other super mix/Max'd players is the last thing 90% of twinks want to do.
---
Eh, most groups don’t have an issue with it. It often only causes a few minutes pause. More time is wasted by groups when some hunter down in silithus signs up for a Strat group with no summon and hearth in cd. No one complains about that crap, so they can fuck off if someone’s child wakes up and they need need a few minutes to get them settled. IMO, of course.
---
Is this your conclusion about this post? I thought the best part about wow classic was the great community that takes pride in helping eachother, not the lonely losers who bully leveling players. Being a smurf and going in open world pvp in level appropriate zones isn't different from lvl 60's killing lvl 20's.
---
If you want to be a scumbag and take pride on that, go and play Eve Online.
---
Blah this guide said this guide said. Let people have their own taste, if you only play after well ranking internet guides it's your thing.
---
Are you horde or alliance?
---
Retail damaged classic because you apparently don't need to wait to build threat anymore.
---
Not to mention I've spoken to many people who respond to "did you play vanilla?" with "dude I was like 4"
---
Retail Is wow for most people, if you're thinking about how tanking should be done properly, you're probably 30+
---
I tank as a warrior, if I'm rubbish find a new tank whatever :) I got a healer buddy so get most groups easy
---
Pretty sure trueaim is only 3 hit. Why are you gearing for 10 hit not 9 hit then if it gives 4 hit? I am 99% sure it gives only 3 hit, including the special 1% reduction from weap skill. This is the way eddgemasters works for melee. Either way devilsaur+unforgiven is better, prior to dire maul loot. Completely scuffed prebis list.
---
If you use the correct setup (unforgiven+devilsaur set), the hit on Striker's is wasted, as I have been saying this whole time.
---
Woahh there nelly.
---
Experienced can mean playing the game since 2004 and playing on private vanilla servers for several years as well. The bar gets pretty high for experience. 
---
Just keep playing and learning and you’ll become experienced. That’s it.
---
Tbh, just start and play the game. You will learn about dungeons and raiding as well as everything else as you go. Also, try to find a nice guild with more experienced players, chat with people, talk about the game and your experience. They will help you.
---
i feel you, i was banking (lol literally) on lasher farm to fund... well, basically my entire character and all of my alts, but now i'm stuck back in ZF graves for the rest of Classic apparently
---
i hear ZG crocs are good gold but at this point who knows if Blizzard will even let them be?
---
Yeah, if he could get banned for a joke like that then me and half my guild should be permabanned for the kind of crap we joke about.
---
I think there's more to the story and he's trying to save face.
---
You posted this because you got annoyed by someone else on the internet and decided to be abusive back to the player. And also highlight that you won in the end- very immature.
---
Discussion is hardly necessary for this topic.
---
I made 30g in one run. It's not heavily nerfed at all.
---
Hey thanks for the reply
---
I understand, I've been suggested this piece of advice more times than I can imagine. But I give up, I don't know where to go? Everyone seems to know everything while I can't figure out much of anything. All I do is farm gold and quest, I don't know how to do anything else? I've watched more videos than I can imagine but it seems like I require vital information to decrypt the secrets.
---
I'm afraid to miss out on important quests, or choose the wrong profession, this might be why I halt my progression :/
---
Due to the nature of multiplicative 15% increased stamina buffs, I decided to do a little math. Let's take someone with 4k HP (no idea how much health a 60 warrior tank has so i'm just using this). If they applied this buff 16 times, they'd have 37k XP. 15 more times (stance eats up a buff slot, so no 32 dream) and this becomes *304k health*.
---
Unrealistic to spend time getting 31 stacks of this, and pointless as you'd want to throw some AP buffs in there, along with Onyxia, but it was fun to smash my calculator with "x 1.15" 31 times.
---
This being said, [RIP the bug already](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dire-maul-tribute-buffs/334046/4)
---
I wanted to be my guilds MT or OT but there's no chance of that. So, in order to raid, I need to be dps but for dungeons, i 'need' to be prot.
---
I don't really want to keep switching specs, so as i have a lot of dungeon quests, i'll pug tank and then sit out of raids until i have enough pre-bis dps gear (and exp. of dungeons) for raids and tanking dungeons.
---
it's just annoying.
---
You need consecration for any serious attempt at pally tanking.
---
would that be a skinner?
---
I feel like druids never have any good ways to gold farm. Am I missing something?
---
I have to agree. There's nothing more exhilarating than getting repeatedly killed in an unfair fight.
---
That min-maxing point makes zero sense.
---
Play the game, learn the classes, learn the content, learn how to optimize. Done.
---
Start with step 1.
---
Is there a better spot?
---
He's insinuating your friend was banned for buying gold rather than for joking about gambling. Which seems more plausible.
---
damn that's a lot of crying in one post
---
I think the two main reasons why warriors don't want to tank, at least from my perspective:
---
1. You can't do shit as a prot warrior. No way you're farming anything.
---
2. Tanks may be needed for dungeons but most raids have their tanks and are only looking for dps and healer especially.
---
I'm lucky enough to having found a solution for 1, so now I only need a raid
---
Some of us try to not be total shit Gibbons.

Feral Druid in general sucks in PvP because of the mana problem you stated. Only real way you can win in PvP is to use free action potion and shapeshift as little as possible

Rekt

Whats a WA?
---
Make goals and achieve them. Are you 60? Do you know what you want to do when you hit 60?
---
I'd imagine for the same reason you posted an answer with zero information, to get the attention you so desperately crave.
---
Alliance, 44 priest.
---
I think that's just a communication problem.
---
If it happens, talk to the dps. If it happens again either kick them or drop group or tell the group you wont' run with that dps.
---
Also add that dps to your friend list and add a note saying that they are bad. If you join a group with them in it, tell the group and go from there.
---
i just dinged 60 mainly did quests after mara so we'll see how the 60 dungeons go
---
Even that has not been working on my server lately.  I work through the night, and now I'm even seeing people farm during that time.  Used to work fine
---
Just put in your lfg post that it's reserved, that's perfectly reasonable. If people have a problem with it they don't have to come, you'll find plenty of non warriors that couldn't give a shit.
---
About 7 of us started, and we’re all still there, going strong! We’re between level 42 and 53. Having tons of fun. I’m proud of them all!
---
Why did you remove? Being an effective druid in world pvp means you are constantly changing between damage dealing tanking and healing/ccing
---
People honestly set themselves up to fail so often...
---
Add-ons like that, Questie, and Azeroth Autopilot make the game extremely boring. There's no interaction other than button mashing enemies and following an arrow around the world. Yet they insist "this is the way I want to play..."
---
Times have really changed, man.
---
*Daaaaaamn!*
---
MoP and WoTLK were just better in every way.
---
Hell, there are patch changes the patch notes didn't have. Patch notes are hardly infallible.
---
this guy knows stuff ;)
---
What i like the most about twinks is that they deny reality and try to hide behind crafty arguments that makes no sense against logic.
---
Feral pvp is kinda rough till you get balance talents reducing shifting cost and create talents providing energy/ rage.  Also you need some int on your gear.  You cant expect to use full rogue gear and pvp effectively.
---
NO, the tanking model in classic was always half baked and shit, which is why only one class can MT.  Look at the failed experiment of shaman tanking, that should tell you blizzard didn't completely flush out the tank classes in their rush to release the game 6 months early.   All the "norms" of tanking are to get around this fact.   
---
You know why people don't want to go slow and meticulous?  Because it's boring as shit, even for me, *the tank*.    But I have zero tools to push harder and faster, which is what I'd prefer to do.   But tab-sunder spam is all I got.   
---
So no, I'm not going to blame the players.  The model is dogshit.   Blizzard figured this out, which is why the role that most changed from vanilla to MoP (the last xpat I played) is without question the tank.   Tanking in Wrath (which is when I started) is 1000x more fun than this.  I had no problems tanking in LFD with pugs and I had a far more fun doing it than this trash.
---
It's like blizzard gave tanks a wrench to drive nails.   Can it be done?  Sure.  Is it hard?  Only if you want to go fast and can look over the fact that you're using the completely wrong tool to drive nails.   The drywallers, floorers, and painters all have what they need to be effective, but they have to wait on you and work on your schedule because you have to go slow.   Now after 10 years of tanks having hammers, no one wants to go back to the days we have wrenches, I know I sure don't. 
---
People in threads like this are tripping over their nostalgia to overlook the obvious.
---
ugh, yeah for some reason my guild isn't that interested in DM.
---
i'll be pugging it and tryingh my luck -.-
---
Took me 90 minutes from the point where I got so fed up farming whelps that I started tracking the time.
---
" If you want to be a scumbag and take pride on that, go and play Eve Online. "  
---
Who are you to determine how people play the game or how people enjoy the game? If it isn't against the Terms of Service, it's valid. Maybe you should get off your high horse and take a big dose of git gud.
---
If you hit 60 with 8 days played, and I have only played 6 days, I don't understand how you have played less than me. That is already 2 days more /played time than I have.
---
&gt;Right now I have roughly 12 hours /played. To which I can say, at least 1 full day (24 hours) is me not playing, but keeping the game online for guild chat / AH while I cook/clean. So I actually played less than you, despite being 60 and being fairly well geared already.
---
I'm assuming you mean 12 days played as opposed to 12 hours. Which again is about twice as much time as I have spent playing. I’ve played about 20 hours/week, you have played about 40 hours/ week. And yes, I also have time hanging around just talking to guildies.
---
The fact that your leveling has been more efficient than mine is not overly surprising. When you only play in 1 or 2 hour chunks as I often do, there is often not time to find and run dungeons. Additionally more time is spent traveling. Also, as a mage, your dps and just general overall leveling speed are much better than mine as a paladin.
---
Not only DBM but Recount, Details and other damage meters
---
An addon most likely
---
Maybe:
---
    /cast [noequipped:shield,stance:1/2] berserker stance
---
    /cast [noequipped:shield,stance:1/2,@mouseover,harm][noequipped:shield,stance:1/2]pummel;
---
    /cast [equipped:shield,stance:3] shield bash;
---
It's also a novelty item...no one needs it
---
Some of us farm fused wire out of Gnomergan for repair bots.

*Paladin*

EDIT- Obligatory /s
---
It’s a centaur
---
Hmm, is that from Flamelash, EU?
---
I only tanked up to mara. but that's been my experience. Also a couple of arena runs.
---
we'll see how the lv. 60 dungeons go though
---
I don't mind grinding problem is I don't know what to grind for. I'm currently level 20, I don't understand how to dungeon, it seems like there are quests outside the dungeons that I need to collect? How do you find people? I've looked over many guides but they require prerequisite knowledge which I lack :(
---
Damn. Well thank you much for explaining it all. I’m sure I’ll make use of it!!
---
And looking at all the bugs people are posting, I thought there was something that felt off
---
if you joined a cleave group then it is quite different to a 'normal' run.
---
try healing with your guildees.
---
should be easier.
---
Yeah, maybe, if they have no concept of value.  Tell them the book is an easy several hundred gold, see if that changes their minds about it being on reserve.
---
Haha this is a good one.
---
Read my other comment but blizzard went from making multiple posts a day, interacting with the community, and keeping an ongoing known bug list, to not posting bug updates for 3 weeks. I've seen enough mmo launches and failures to recognize signs of concern and withdrawing from community interaction is a big one.
---
Can you also get this from the big dragons? Or was that a different quest? I remember grouping up and looting something off a big dragon. I certainly don't remember doing all the little whelps

She’ll change her mind and bring you a snack soon I’m sure.

"A hotfix was applied to all realms 30 minutes ago that squashed that bug. The buffs obtained from the guards in Dire Maul North after completing a tribute run will no longer stack.

Thank you for your feedback on it!"
---
A friend linked me this PvP video and said that he and someone in the comments were wondering how this Warlock could see enemy players' buffs. It may be something I'm not thinking of, which is why I'm asking, but does anyone know how this guy can see the enemy faction player's buffs? The only thing I thought of was Detect Magic but that's Mage. I can't remember what's similar that I may be forgetting.

Curious and any help would be appreciated, even if it's a simple answer or not possible on a non-pserver. I've never been on a private server so I'm not sure if there are things like this which are capable there but not in official Classic, as intended.
---
What’s this UI?
---
Reading some other comments in this thread pertaining to Wfury, HoJ, and Thrash Blade/Flurry Axe procs.
---
If I have all three of these things, am I better off just ignoring this mechanic entirely and chasing more hit% as a DW? Seeing that the extra hit procs will start your Heroic Strike regardless of swing timer. I’m quite new to endgame vanilla, and am just trying to get the most out of my class. But trying to queue and cancel HS as a DW with Wfury, HoJ, and Flurry Axe seems like a nightmare lol.
---
This is pretty much what you want for talents:

---
You should swap out your normal DPS gear for a full set of "Of the Eagle" gear, HP/MP matter a lot more than Spell Power here as Blizzard scales very poorly with it. I have around 3400hp/6200mp in my farming set and rarely go oom. Movement speed enchant on boots also recommended.
---
If you interpret the blue post as it is, without any extra data, you can come to the conclusion that: +5, +10, +15 weapon skill gives +1%, +2%, +3% hit rating. It is actually closer to +2%, +2.5%, +3%, when you observe the results in game. This is without the 1% you get back from gear/talents.
---
What you wrote is not direct result from those posts.
---
There's so much I want to ask, I keep getting bombarded with conflicting answers and I don't know which to choose, if you get the gist!
---
&gt; THAT is why no one wants to tank anymore

that and the fact that everytime something goes wrong it's 3 dps idiots blaming the tank instead of it ever being their fault
---
**Useless for Aussies playing on American Servers as spell batching with latency = does this without a macro.

He wasn't huge when I did the quest.

Nice noggenfogger, OP.
---
Deviate Delight feels good. It's supposed to be 60A/40H but it feels like it might be closer to equal than that. I've not ever felt like we have too much or too little, even when zone wars happen. It might help that it is a mid population server though. The imbalances aren't in your face when you've got a few moments to breath.

---
Right? I was so afraid I'd be hard to heal, but every healer says, "easiest heals ever, I love bears!"
---
You're nice to your faction, you're as scummy as humanly possible to the opposite faction.
---
Creating rivalries with the opposite faction and remembering their names so you can slaughter them maybe even 10 days from now is the best part about classic
---
Sure, you can disagree, but then you would probably be more suited for a PvE realm
---
Maybe see if any guilds are hosting open runs or you could try finding a PUG Raid.
---
In most western/northern European countries social assistance/welfare is enough to support yourself. You can get a small apartment provided for you, enough money to buy clothing, food, internet etc. 
---
If you don't do anything else in your life; like travel, go out drinking, eat out, frequently buy new stuff, etc, the money is enough to just spend your life inside playing wow, it's only 12€/month after all.
---
i am about to quit.
---
after really thinking about it.  classic isn't going anywhere after phase 6.  there is not going to be a classic+ or anything new added to classic.  people, including me forget that retail is the warcraft game.  classic is something blizzard gave us to hold us over until the next expansion comes out.
---
want to know when tbc realms are going to be online?  when the next expansion hits that lul period that happens near the end of every expansion.
---
i have been playing classic only since it was re-released.  a couple days ago i hopped on retail, and holy fuck it's way better looking.  like everything just looks better.
---
i'd like to see retail become more like classic with realm communities and more player interaction.  but classic itself is going nowhere, it's just been fun to pass the time until the next raid/expansion hype.
---
Marginalized? That's a good one. I'd say catered to. Look at all the trash forced movies and television. Make it authentic, real, not cheesily forced. I'm looking at you CW's Batwoman!
---
Nerfed in 1.6.0...
---
If only rogues could solo something
---
I haven't learned much so far, I've only been questing and spending time in AH. I'm afraid this is what I'll keep doing till I'm 60. It's possible to learn about raids and which items to use by just questing? I know I need to learn these, but how, and where?
---
I mean if you're randomly getting whispered in town, sure, but not for your healer in a dungeon run
---
Please remember to call deadmines DM and start fights about it in world chat
---
Even if it did, they also have posts saying DM is in phase 2 but obviously they're just doing whatever they feel will keep subscribers.
---
No, but at least be honest and admit that you're a bully, don't hide behind nice words. Name it lvl 19 bully bracket, not twink bracket.
---
Git gud is for the ones who can't pvp at lvl 60 where everyone is more or less equal, where there is build diversity and where the gear disparity isn't that high.
---
Yep, people expecting this addon "banned" are asking for the majority of the most useful addons to be removed. Good luck with that.

---
&gt; So HoJ isn't your BiS anymore. Next stupid question please.
---
It's the principle of the question, you could make it for some other item and classes that rolls on it. Point is that "BiS" is not equal, some items give certain classes much higher performance than it does for others, so if you're in a guild distributing loot to make sure you raid is getting the biggest upgrade, you have to look at how much it benefits each class in comparison with others.
---
&gt; You still have a very high chance to get Rhok, relative to the chance a melee has to get strikers. Thats all that matters.
---
You could pug MC in 30mins to magmadar to get a chance at loot. Whereas petrified leaf you have to go all the way to domo for. Once you're done gearing from other bosses you can prepare for BWL just by running a pug for 2 bosses every week.
---
Obviously this depends on your raid comp, if you have a lot of hunters but fewer melee, it makes more sense to give striker's/blastershot to hunters as getting each of them rhok could take a long time.
---
&gt; My point is you get defaulted all that gear. Doesn't mean you have to wear it all for your optimal set. Your just nitpicking here. Make a real argument. You know exactly what I mean when I say hunters have much less loot competition than melee in MC.
---
Same point as above, depends on your raid comp.
---
Everyone in the group is gonna need on that shit lol
---
It’s a BOE. The default rule is going to be everyone need. That is how many handle BOE epics and blues. 
---
Why is this the default rule? Because some people do it. So unless you are clear up front about another rule set, assume everyone will need.
---
With that said, you are a tank. Tanks are in short supply. Start the group and reserve the item. I would have zero issues joining a group where a tank without the weapon reserves the book. And many will feel like me. Now if you don’t reserve the item, expect others to roll on it. 
---
Any loot rule is acceptable if all parties agree to it. As a tank you have more influence on the loot rules than any other class. While I don’t join runs where unrealistic items are reserved by the party lead, I won’t mind if the quelserrar is reserved by a warrior tank.
---
Welcome to my world as a priest for Truefaith Vestments pattern, and that of warlocks for Robes of the Void pattern, and mages for Robes of the Archmage. “I’d pass if it wasn’t a x amount of gold item”.
---
If we can’t have our shit defaulted to us, then you shouldn’t have yours defaulted to you. We had to fuck off, you should too.
---
all you have to do for this is stay further than 31 yards, use arc shot r1 on CD and keep serpent sting up
---
thats literally it
---
I have a simple rule if you pull or take agro to early you don't get healed talk to your healer tell them that's the rule,  after 2 deaths you don't get a Rez after 4 deaths you get kicked it's not hard to hold back for 2 secs
---
Face to fist style, how you like it?
---
The little green blobs in Mara are the best for this. I (druid tank) was very successfully weaving in and out getting good hits in and holding aggro. Warrior and rogue dps started out careful, landing some hits. Mage ends his blizzard early to run in and frost nova. Warrior and rogue both almost instantly die. Hahahaha fucking mage.
---
All Hail Onyxia
---
What rivalry you can create with someone you oneshot and doesn't fight back? What rivalry you can create with someone that outlevels you in a week and you will never see again?
---
you sound like a salty bitch
---
&gt; I have around 3400hp/6200mp in my farming set
---
Yeah okay, that explains a lot. I have 2200hp/4400mp in my current dungeon/raiding set. People seem to skip over that detail every time they go "mages can easily farm whatever" :p
---
Yeah I tried to post the tooltip but reddit formatting was messing it up making it bold and omitting the pound sign.
---
And here I am having found just 2 arcane crystals since Classic came out. Entirely. Only two.
---
Or solo it as a mage.
---
My guild has a couple mages farming it solo. One told me they didn't really need great gear to do so, though he is pretty well-geared by now. [This is the guide they used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qejZ3B_GBQ).
---
Don't quit your dayjob dude this is a wiiide moss
---
Yeah how dare people expect others to back up their claims! People should be able to say anything they want, and the onus should be on everyone else to prove or disprove it!!1
---
Please. You make a claim, don't get pissy when asked to back it up. Asking for a source doesn't make someone lazy. If I googled every unsubstantiated claim dumbasses like you left in these threads, I'd have no time for WoW.
---
Most of my wpvp has been 1 on 1
---
I still think that fight is bugged, 17 years later.
---
Can't masterloot the whole run unless he sets threshold to epic which may turn some heads
---
The only time my pet really needs to be healed is if it has to tank. Otherwise healers are better off focusing on party members.
---
Hunters mana pool vs how much high level water replenishes means that it doesn't take long for hunter to revive pet and/or heal the pet and then reup. So don't worry about it too much.
---
Good question mate. Not sure, would love someone with more knowledge to help us out. 
---
Cheers
---
I have tailoring on my  mage, made the robe, even sent some mass crafted greens to disenchanting-alt and now I'm not sure if I **should keep tailoring?**. Runecloth bags are 2,4g, could potentially make and sell robes of winter night (110-130g but likely short term item). Bloodvine is BoE and I could skip crit bonus.
---
I also have mining and leveling alt to 35 for alchemy so my mage could go mining/herb (can't be tracked at once, but greedy on resource generation). PvE realm and mostly PvE...
---
Different characters on each account. I think it's fine.
---
Google is your friend but honestly if you just don't like questing an mmo might not be for you. 
---
It takes a long time to hit 60, forget about raids for now just enjoy the game and quest. Learn about your class and the zones.
---
You literally learn by finding out about things (encountering it in game or seeing a message) then experiencing it or reading up on it, if you want some kind of "read this and be pro" you just won't get that.
---
The levels of optimisation each class can go into and encounter specific things is deep. Just Google a class guide if you want to know a class. The wowhead molten core guide isn't bad but really isn't needed.
---
OWO
---
I understand the book is several hundred gold and have no problem with it being on reserve. Do I therefore have no concept of value? Not everyone is as against their party members getting priority on a BiS drop as you seem to be.
---
&gt; Its getting really ridiculous too to where i might just level my alt instead of heal 60 dungeons.
---
Way ahead of you, already level 40 with my alt and having a much better time generally just not doing any dungeons at all unless it's with the guild.
---
Dungeons:
---
War - if tanking, easy to find groups. If dps - same issue as lock
---
Raids:
---
War: If you have a guild you can raid with. Shouldn't be much of an issue to dps, but they may already have a MT and OT - although you could try to pug MT a raid but i think that would be a lot more difficult
---
Lock: Pug or guild should be fine
---
WPVP: Lock is superior, esp. w/ soulstone, fear and pets.
---
I'm scared to get on Fairbanks cuz horde
---
So is the warrior book
---
I think you might have to be in combat already
---
lucky bastards
---
For damage meter you can use either Details! or Recount. DBM is pretty much setup from the get go, but there’s a couple of extra features you can look into. Hope that helps!
---
nah, it's a long ass run to mara (5+min i'd guess, haven't timed it) and you can check the ah in those 2min breaks or stretch, take a sip of water or whatever.
---
Quest is there. Doesn’t show up as a quest icon. Talk to warlock trainer. I’m on the step to summon
---
Bro &lt;party mansion&gt; is our guild on yojamba oceanic, we have the same invite ahhaahha
---
As you said, it is nigh impossible to get a main tank position if you don't make your own guild, or aren't good friends with the GM of a guild.  It really, really discourages people from tanking at 60 and it's one of the more annoying parts of 40 man raids.
---
Druids aren't that gear dependant VS other classes. Weapon damage doesn't directly translate and so a gnomergan mace with 3 charges will be best for pve DPS. You obviously don't need to farm it for dungeons but to come near rogues you'll need to use them for raids, at least 1 charge for boss.
---
Farming them isn't hard but it is something. Also, I love my feral tank for what it's worth. Great leveling experience and tanking is great.
---
Omg they stole our idea. Our guild is called the party mansion and we have a very similar recruiting macro
---
Realistically, is shaman specced into aoe able to do this efficiently?
---
sounds lame
---
save them!
---
if/when you get exalted it's free entry to naxx.
---
plus it's easy enough to get to revered by killing world and dungeon mobs. 
---
unless you absolutely need the enchants NOW wait.
---
In that case, fighting anyone in any bracket with worse gear than you is bullying. But only if you’re a whiny brat.
---
Some twink killing me in a BG bracket I’ll be leveled past in a couple days is not bullying. It’s just a BG in a video game, and there is no lasting effect on me. If you feel the need to cry when this happens to you, then you are not mature enough to be playing any game online.
---
No one with a brain thinks anyone over 50+ is running Deadmines.
---
DBM is a boss mod, that tells you when a boss is about to do something you need to be aware of. (Such as a spell that needs to be canceled, avoided or dispelled).
---
There are specific mods for damage meters.
---
Yeah, I try not to be a quitter but I’m pretty much ready to join the Alliance exodus from Skeram.
---
PvP is one thing, but the constant shared flight path and dungeon entrance camping without any organized resistance just makes it unplayable.
---
And I'll accept that ban if he was. Except he's broke in game and out. New kid and all that.
---
Also.. again, that's the thing that scares me the most. Like I said previous, I've made loads of jokes that if taken out of context, might be bannable. For this to have permanently banned his account is so strange to me.
---
Lol pserver players would need on this too get your head out of your ass.
---
&gt; Pretty sure trueaim is only 3 hit.
---
+5 (or more) weapon skill reduces hit cap from 9 to 6
---
trueaim also has 1% hit on them
---
yikes having to explain basic game mechanics.
---

---
Devilsaur setup
---
less crit less ap, tell me again how this is better than the one I linked?
---
if ur controlling just two devilsaur spawns thats easily over 100g per hour
---
Impatient Aoe mages killed my love of tanking in classic, might come back to classic at some point.
---
YYYYY
---
Well not yet. But I have all the twink items already bought an ready.
---
I think at the end of the day keybinds and UI layout are very personal things, there's no right way. Function keys like that won't work for me because I'm a Shaman and have a ton of keybinds, but that's interesting way to work thru party members / pop a heal on a pet. 
---
You may be able to work out a single button to scroll through party members and use a modifier to select a party members pet. I can't provide specific instructions but there's a plethora of resources online.
---
no, you don't use it ton the dps, you use it on the tank, that way they straight up die.
---
I didn't know you can set  thresholds  to epic.  Do you know of any other DM only epic loot that other classes specifically need?
---
this is warcraft, pansy
---
To be fair, it's not a quest - it's a quest plus killing 30 or so other fulborgs.
---
That's why you don't roll alliance. Shamans know how to properly fluff their warrior chads.
---
Feral DPS is a mess, and in terms of "viability of dps" it's a disaster sadly. (Speaking to this as a druid main) Your BIS weapon in the game, is a level 30 blue item. (Manual Crowd Pummeler) of which you will be required to farm a ton of, every week to maintain reasonable damage numbers.
---
Beyond this, your best helm in the game, is a level 40 crafted LWer item. (Not kidding here either)
---
So yeah hunter is probably better.
---
There are two types of Twinking:
---
* Twinking at low levels (especially at 19) : This is for shit ball-less players that can't do real pvp at 60 because they are shit at the game. They are also so delusional and they believe they are doing real pvp. A twink 19 hunter, how small can someone's penis be.
---
* Twinking at high levels (especially at 59) : This is for people that actually want to do and enjoy fair pvp but without the endless pvp-gear grind. This is an even better pvp experience than lvl 60 bgs due to everyone not having access to superior gear. So it's all skills.
---
Hell levels...shudder
---
...does this mean I can stop ignoring your girls' texts to me?
---
We all dropped off including me when Borderlands 3 came out. I fully intended to come back when I finished it, which I have. And now It's just me. I expected it honestly so I switched servers and faction because fuck it.
---
You are wrong. What are they doing is bullying 100%. 
---
The fact that you're strong enough not to care doesn't mean he is not a bully or that everyone is strong enough not to care about wasted time / bad experience.
---
Yeah while I'm not normally one for calling people losers for achieving something in a game.. the Winterspring grind is about 300-400 hours with no real way to get around that or speed it up. Having that grind done this soon after launch implies that you've got people doing absolutely nothing but playing WoW all day every day as they also tend to have leveled to 60 super fast, farmed all the instances to hell and back, and cleared every raid every week.
---
I don't judge people for game time, I've been there... but those achievements are a lot more to do with time than skill.
---
&gt; If you hit 60 with 8 days played, and I have only played 6 days, I don't understand how you have played less than me. That is already 2 days more /played time than I have.
---
I had to re-read your comment to understand you meant you only /played 6 days so far. Yet you're levelling a lot slower than I did, so obviously it'll take you longer to get to 60. Nothing wrong with that, but don't call people out who can level a char to 60 in half the time you can.
---
&gt; I'm assuming you mean 12 days played as opposed to 12 hours.
---
Yes (already edited and fixed that)
---
&gt; The fact that your leveling has been more efficient than mine is not overly surprising. When you only play in 1 or 2 hour chunks as I often do, there is often not time to find and run dungeons.
---
Exactly. But again, I fail to see why that is a problem. If anything, those of us who level by enjoying ourselves playing a multiplayer game with other people (read: dungeons) surely cannot be said to be doing it the wrong way.
---
WoW is not a game I ever played to play 1-2 hours at the time. And I think a lot of people who play the game with agree with me on that one. 
---
Dire Maul is actually a blessing for those people. Each wing in DM can be run in about 30 minutes. Stratholme needs 1-1.5 hours per side, Scholomance easy 1.5 hours, a full BRD run can take up to 5 hours, and UBRS also takes 1-1.5 hours (or more) depending on the skill of your group. By all accounts, DM is the group that is _best_ suited for players who cannot play as much.
---
And of course, why the fuck does raiding progress matter for Dire Maul if people who complain cannot commit more than 1-2 hours a day for playing WoW? You're never going to raid in classic if you can't commit a 4-5 hour session at least once a week.
---
Questing is what I enjoy about this game though it seems like I'm missing out on so much, the bigger thing. Raiding, dungeoning, secret quests, planning your professions.
---
There are all these guides for the perfect start but they seem a bit advanced.
---
Having your alt as a bank and checking AH etc or doing proffesions on an alt is great way to keep you busy during the downtime :)
---
Am a rogue, but still feel your pain
---
I’m hopeful someone will work out a decent DME farm. Maybe quite a new take as well. It’s been less than 24 hrs, let’s give the turbo steamers time to lead us to the good gph. As a lock I’m slightly over Mara, currently at 87 princess kills according to dbm 😆.
---
As a hunter, chain heal definitely hits pets, but I think they are lowest priority.
---
so wait...is it sexual?
---
1) Which totems? As others have said something like windfury won't work, but stoneskin should, as well as strength of earth, grace of air and others.

Cringe
---
HoJ is really the exception, not the rule. But yes some BiS items are better for one class than another.  Strikers isnt your BiS at all.  Im hard pressed to find an item that would prio as a temp upgrade to someone when it is BiS for another. Cant think of a single item. Can you?
---
If your raid comp has more than 4 hunters, find a new raid. That's bad for raid dps and bad for loot.
---
Getting an epic mount is not a big deal after 60 unless you're buying crafted/boe gear off the AH. I was engin/mining which means I barely ever made money off professions and it took me about a week after 60 to get the cash.

this is stupid and silly, at least I know

I think there's another robe in a later phase you need max tailoring for as well.

Me not that kind of orc!
---
tab mauling is much much better than spamming swipe
---
Not supposed to, the videos you don't see is when they get runover by that ahole 3 minute mage multiboxer. instagibs people one at a time  with his 20 literally exactly the same specced mage.
---
where to quest for a 54 almost 55 warrior?
---
i dont mind doing some BRD runs but that is really slow EXP (arena/angerforge runs)
---
Until it was nerfed in original vanilla lol
---
Quite balanced, real glad I stuck here
---
I see, I meant more the hatred there must be between the factions as a result of these huge fights and how that plays out for the general population
---
Armor listed along with other stats under the sprite and there’s a tab for abilities under the map spawns: https://classicdb.ch/?npc=5305
---
I quested/ grinded in darkshire/hillsbrad/alterac mountians till 34, got tired of it, and did sm spams till 40
---
Haha vanilla tank here, playing warrior again and I can't wait to tank at 60. Personally I love letting people die that don't follow the rules, and have zero problem doing so. My job is to keep the healer alive. It is the DPS's job to look at what I'm attacking and keep themselves alive. Back when I healed I would intentionally let dumb DPS die as well and keep the tank up.
---
Yeah I started &lt;Karate and Friendship&gt; on Archimonde in WotLK.  Always Sunny guilds are awesome
---
Have fun sport
---
Hey man out of curiosity are the materials required for the bell etc the one with one arcanite bar or 3?
---
Grats on the mount btw I'm keen for mine
---
Roll PVE
---
Just start pugging and see if you like it or not? Content right now is far from hard and you’ll get the pve/team experience with almost all pugs using discord(if they dont probably dont join them).
---
Friendly to green, relentless to red
---
Ideally they channel their frustration into wpvp once they leave the bracket. If getting smeared by a twink hunter makes then fight hunters on sight for the next 20 levels then mission accomplished, war isn't fair.
---
I havn't timed it either but I lock myself out doing gizlock+princess with runbacks. However good point that it takes more effort than sitting on the alt for a bit.
---
I regret rolling my character in a PvP server. I enjoy it when it is against someone my level range, but being ganked by someone 10 levels + above me has never made sense.
---
Those that say ‘it’s pvp it’s allowed, don’t complain etc’ could in my view be the same folks who complain when they don’t get the loot they want, or some other common in game experience. 
---
If I can eventually move to a new server I will take it up as play time is limited with full time work and school, and I just don’t get a kick out of fights I can’t win
---
I feel your pain. People (especially here) are blinded by their own greed and honk their greed equates a need roll.
---
Whoa, don’t use your basic logic. That mess isn’t allowed in here. We have to pretend to be psychologists and try to project as hard as we can to diagnose others as somehow flawed or horrible humans in real life.
---
The person who wants it could always ask if it drops. I would more than likely let them have it.
---
3 Arcanite Bar, and ty!
---
Deserved.
---
Okay literally tell me why stam is not worth casting on a dps player. Give me the math that says stamina isn't worth 30 seconds at the beginning of a dungeon run.
---
Otherwise, fuck off with this '*well, technically if nobody but the tank takes damage...*' bullshit.
---
You fucked up, you lost money, and now you want to blame add ons and other people instead of just accepting that you fucked up. 
---
That’s life. Get over it.
---
I don't have an epic mount yet. If I want to get another city faction's mount, should I delay my own faction's epic mount? Because I'd have to pay for two mounts, right?
---
Get ready to be downvoted. Seriously though this is why they created pve and rp servers.
---
Dumb cancer post
---
Rezzing once or twice and entering is hard
---
I didn't say it was impossible, but you have to realize that you're an extreme outlier and not a common denominator when it comes to these two games.  Especially since we're talking classic and not even retail. Those two would have a bit more overlap since they both cater to the ADD crowd.
---
The build intrigues me greatly because its different. I raided as ret in vanilla because folks said it couldnt be done. It could, it just took 10x as much work. Eventually i rolled a rogue, now im fury in classic and this appeals to me as having an “only for the dedicated” club vibe. Dont want to do it until im ready and make myself and the spec look bad.
---
It’s bis even without ago enchants, wtf are you on about
---
&lt;APES&gt; has like 4 Wintersabers in this screenshot
---
Yes I 2 box a warrior and priest
---
interesting that you made a reddit account just to post this. why?
---
Omg I hate when ppl do this
---
I better get some soon then cheers man
---
Basically because of how the game handles attack rolls.

To be crit capped means that when your attack lands and doesn't get parried/blocked and it isn't a glancing blow(glancing blows cannot crit), you guarentee that it crits. So if you have 60% chance of not getting a normal autoattack, and 40% chance of critting, the game will give you a 100% chance to crit on those normal auto attacks that can crit.
---
By having a higher chance to hit, you have a higher chance to do a normal autoattack and thus need a higher chance to crit to guarentee that auto attack crits
---
The formula to calculate your crit cap is:
---
&gt;300 wep skill dual wielding attacking from behind vs lvl 63 boss 100%-26.4%-6.5%-0%-0%-40%+4.8%+hit% = 31.9+hit (-1 if hit &gt; 0)  
---
&gt;305 wep skill dual wielding attacking from behind vs lvl 63 boss 100%-24.8%-6%-0%-0%-40%+4.8%+hit% = 34+hit
---
We have &lt;Daymen&gt; on Grobbulus.
---
You can easily do it on horde side with a shaman luckily as you simply sacrifice a grounding totem and twist back to windfury to blast him.
---
Only have tried Zevrim in a group of 4 and we added the lashers when the imps came. Dont know yet if you can LoS the lashers at all.
---
I can’t make any argument from statistics across all servers but I can give you some personal experience.  I think most of the rationale stems from wanting to level the playing field after having encountered players who have better gear than you, either in world pvp or eventually bgs.  Now honestly, some of those losses could be a lack of skill but sometimes it’s just obvious that you’re outgeared.  By picking any twink bracket (19 all the way up to 59) you can guarantee that you won’t be outgeared.  That’s significantly harder to do at 60 with the various ranks and eventual naxx geared toons.  If I’m in countless bgs where I’m just going up against leveling toons with my twink then yeah, I’m gonna have a field day.  Is that fun?  For a short time yes.  Long term?  I’m looking for reasonably balanced matches with the other side having twinks as well.   It’s more satisfying to beat the other team when you had to work for it.  Open world twinks attacking levelers?  For me it would be more of a “I wonder how fast I can nuke this guy” type of deal but I wouldn’t camp him endlessly.  Most of that behavior at least from a twink ends when BGs open.  
---
I always enjoyed twinking but for me it was competitive more often than not.  Time will tell in classic
---
HoJ is BiS tank trinket by a big margin.
---
&gt;Do you really really think that it takes the DPS a *full drink timer* to get into position for the next pull?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Honestly? Why even reply if you are just going to exaggerate so much that you are in your own fiction world.
---
Legend says the 7th was there all along.
---
Sigh.. im copy and pasting.
---
Like every other message that is the same as this, I AM AWARE AND HAVE TAKEN RESPINSIBLITY FOR MY FUCK UP SEVERAL TIMES. My post is regarding the fact the addon does not give humans any time whatsoever to potentially fix those fuck ups.
---
This sorta thing really makes you appreciate tank-specced classes. It can be night and day in terms of overall incoming party damage and makes runs MUCH smoother. 
---
I've also noticed as my +healing gear got to 300+ downranking keeps time in between pulls much shorter.
---
You do realize that you can switch weapons in combat?
---
Quick note - the coordinates it gives are not the enemy player's coordinates,  but yours.
---
I can get behind this and this seems fair to me - however it needs to be established at the beginning, not in the frantic seconds after the item drops - which is where I disagree with OP since this wasn't the case. If everyone agrees first that only specific items are on reserve and anything else is free to Need then of course it's fair that an unexpected epic should be open to everyone to have a shot at imo
---
I did a little bit of twisting as a resto shaman in tbc on a pserver, same idea just different mana values in tbc. Yes it is extra damage whether execute is working or not but I'd only do this on farm fights to speed it up cus it's a lot of mana.
---
So if we're talking about totem twisting agi and windfury, we're talking about min maxing our raid dps (because if we don't care about min maxing dps we're not totem twisting). If you are trying to min max your raid dps you are not bringing an enhancement shaman, he'll be resto and you bring an offtank or a hunter with nightfall to spam wing clip.
---
An enhance shaman has a very small mana pool, one totem twist (drop a wf totem to buff melee's weapons, then drop an agi totem to give them the agi buff) is 500 mana, 250 each totem. Windfury weapon lasts 10 seconds (i think). Your enhancement shaman will be oom really fast and will be doing no dps because they can't use stormstrike either.
---
You're better off bringing another resto shaman to twist because they'll be able to do it for longer, while also healing. This allows you to bring a stronger dps class like a rogue or warrior. You get the bonus of twisting for longer while having less dead weight in the raid.
---
That's not as flashy a headline though. =P
---
Thanx I'd rather have sex
---
Calm down jack ma
---
wtf. It makes even less sense to do it, if you are gonna replace it at 60.
---
Druids are fine (if not better than warriors) for 5 man instances. And that's what the complaint posts are about. The community only hurts itself it continues to perpetuate the opposite.
---
I should've stayed on Skeram instead of taking the free realm transfer.
---
That is incorrect, at least on warrior. Shoot Gun/Bow/Crossbow have a 1 second cast time. Throw is attack speed.
---
They are on another layer.
---
They clicked randomly out of there bag after selecting item to delete it but accidentally opened trade to you on another layer, but remaining oblivious to it all.
---
My guess
---
Do you get any sleep
---
Meh if you're druid tanking 5 mans you pretty much have a monopoly on leather except for competing with rogues, so can't you gear up as a healer and tank simultaneously? I did in original vanilla on a druid.
---
For what it's worth I think you made the right call
---
&gt;I can't MT UBRS tho, only OT.
---
UBRS only uses 1 tank my dude, you weren't supposed to be tanking anyhow. You're only there to do a couple heroic strikes as dps against drakk and when the tank gets conflag'd you just take a few steps away.
---
You just have to find one way to make money efficiently, a lot of people waste a lot of time in game (nothing wrong with that)
---
I've made over 5,000 gold just from mining, so that's one way I can recommend.
---
Google, look on wowhead or any of the other plentiful sites.
---
I think, if you are playing in pugs that cant even kill domo, you have some very light justification to roll on strikers . But it rests on the assumption that you wont kill domo soon. Your goal should be to clear MC , not adjusting your gearing because you arent able to.
---
Isnt Blasthershot Launcher also better though? Why do you need to roll on this w two options in the same raid that aren't bis for 2 other classes.
---
It's easy, just ignore casters. Just go 'hey, kill the casters first, don't even wait for aggro' and boom, ubrs just got 10x less stressful.
---
You’re actually on the cusp of it getting much better. I’m always surprised how people call out warrior and early hunter for painful leveling but never early rogue.
---
There is a rogue famous who did some videos where he is pwning lvl 60's in white gear. At lvl 60 with all your skillpoints and tools you can conquer the difference between your shit gear and your opponents better gear. At lvl 19 with 5 skills you need to /sit and accept the oneshot.
---
The 5 instance lockout wasn't a thing until later in Vanilla... well after Dire Maul was released.
---
I remember in Summer of 2005 we were still doing Maraudon / DM AE farms doing a dozen+ instances per hour.
---
No. Most people just are past that level range.
---
It's definitely incorrect behavior. It was never like this in Vanilla. 
---
And you might be on to something with humanoids. I remember this behavior from Murlocs in Elwynn, Murlocs in Redridge, Gnolls in Wetlands and Ogres in Badlands.
---
This is literally already posted and has numerous upvotes.
---
I want to hear it straight from the dreadsteed's mouth.
---
That's because they didn't exist. The current 'cast bar' just reads the combat log and starts a timer. It's always going to be a little behind what's actually happening because of that.
---
I usually go charge, concussion blow, rend, the repeat hamstring/sunder armor until I can use execute
---
Prison shank is p. good for dagger rogues... if Bruegal even spawns to begin with.
---
So edgy bro
---
such a shame, initial polling days before release it showed the most balance of all of them. I'd like to see what the ratios are for incendius
---
It was clear earlier than that. If two on opposing sides cross paths, they separate. Very seldom do you see these power houses fight each other, generally only once per BG if even that.
---
All pvp is opt in at some point. You agreed to pvp. They optimized. If you didn't want to do it, don't opt in
---
Notice me Senp-\*CRUNCH\*
---
Switch to arms or fury, u can can  tank  everything till  mc in either spec 
---
That or  spam  dungeons
---
Loooool
---
Sorry this got downvoted. It made me audibly laugh. Take my upvote
---
I think you meant to reply to a different person sir,mam :)
---
Blizzard didn’t randomly do that. Congrats you have a rat in your guild
---
Un goro , felwood, burning steppes. 
---
Arena runs are for gear not xp, they only kill like 5 packs. You should try and join BRD xp farming runs who just farm trash over and over if you want to power level.
---
u stole it from a 19 twink :(
---
Download questie. 
---
Always keep ur pet very happy.
---
Learn to time your autoshot, you should keep it flowing and never interrupt a started attack unless you need to kite
---
Hunters mark &gt; aimed shot &gt; multi &gt; feign death &gt; autoshot &gt; aimed. 
---
People will still be running mc/ony in 2 months, thats around the time PVP start but outside of that there wont be more content so people will still be gearing and I think around now is the time people start hitting 60.
---
You have the luxury of finding insta groups. Abuse it.
---
Is it as good as a mage pulling half the fkn plague lands and AoEing them ?
---
No. But it's the best you can do as a Warrior.
---
Also don't join Strath Living parties until they get bored of waiting and change the *"LF Tank Strath Living"* to *"LF Tank Strath Living, you can have first Orb!"*. Works everytime.
---
You’ll get more than enough wool from running dungeons. I wouldn’t spend money on any first aid consumables if you want to have 100g by 40.
---
I think it's a centaur tbh
---
I see so of armour isnt listed at all they dpnt have armour? Im dumb
---
Due to the insane prices they will go for I'd say you will have to announce it's reserved. But even then, good luck getting a group together as everyone will want it for the monies.
---
Have sex on that steed
---
Said by someone who never played a pally tank in tbc. What's CC? Constant Consecration right?
---
Wow that sucks hopefully everything gets sorted out
---
It’s worth a ton, no one’s gonna just give it away cus the tank needs it 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
This was referring to the amount of loot they drop.
---
This is just one photo though, imagine if the horde just road in a decemated them... We will never know
---
This would include crit from buffs im assuming too right
---
[Bullshit](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community)
---
World leveling, dungeons, or raids?
---
yeah but liklihood of getting those is low, hence I did not include "what ifs" since the whole question is "what if" I can't get Rhok
---
on the trash after rend you want a ot to take assassins.
---
and on the final boss it helps to have a ot, esp if there is no hunters
---
WoW goes well with some preparation and research. We all do it. For example google “Deadmines quests” (alliance) or “wailing caverns quests” (Horde) and you’ll find pages that list the quests you should get for each dungeon. It will be a bit of an adventure tracking them all down, but go for it! Once you have it, find a group to do the dungeon and you’ll get the best rewards and tons of XP. Good luck!
---
You're not wrong. This guy is delusional.
---
To be honest, I think they are still reviewing your case and hopefully you will be unbanned. Have a friend, who was perma as well, was contacted by Blizzard with an apology and his account unbanned. I guess they got used to having players not be so "hardcore" like some were during Vanilla.
---
There’s a route where you can do 3 separate pulls. Then one 3 pack pull. And a solo. So 7 groups and 3 total pulls. It’s pretty easy. 
---
No elite need to be killed. 
---
I honestly didn’t do the math. I can tel you that I probably made about 10g per clear. No major luck. Did 3 clears. About 15g in grey items. 15g between some random greens and living essence. 
---
I think 50g an hour is reasonable. But opposed to previously it will take you all hour at least. You have to remove gear and death run to reset instance also.
---
So if I shoot you in the head or if I drown you, those are completely different unrelated things?
---
The whole guild was lookin at hurr?
---
We are already disenchanting hunter t1 and t2 in our guild. The gear is very easily acquired in a guild. The loot meta isnt dictated by pugs. 
---
Thats actually another option for you if you arent aware. Many guilds sell leaf. Well have a hunter come in to loot leaf and sinew for a price since our guild doesnt need it.
---
&gt; Your goal should be to clear MC
---
That's obviously the goal, adjusting gearing to meet that goal is sensible strategy.
---
&gt; Isnt Blasthershot Launcher also better though?
---
I have to pass this for dwarves, again "BiS" is not equal. I would obviously take it if no dwarves are in the raid, however the hit from striker's end up better in terms of overall gear configuration.
---
A setup with blaster looks something like this:

---
0.5% more crit but a LOT less ap
---
Grats dude!! Which realm?
---
I dont bother with the first two lines myself. Are you standing still for a second to allow pickpocket to cast?
---
It might be boring for *you*, but I don't find it boring to Starfire mob 1, moonfire mob 2 and then promptly scoot behind a corner, bear form, rage up, demoralizing shout when they round the corner, and go to swipe town. Then all the casters aoe it up, and everything's dead.
---
If the entire run's done like that where possible, everyone's happy. The people who aren't, and think it's omg so boooooring, are the ones who come from private servers who are constant go go go because they saw a streamer do it with all his friends so why can't they too? And yell at the group when things go well exactly according to how they saw it somewhere. And refuse to connect the dots that the streamer + all his friends are on discord, actively communicating with each other during the run, know the dungeon inside out because they've both it a million times together.
---
You know as well as I do that this is Classic, with mechanics that are 15 years ago, and going on how oh Blizzard *totally* screwed up 15 years ago. Actually the model changed far before MoP, it was actually during Wrath of the Lich King days, when CC all but vanished from the game, and it was all go go go style - because tank aggro and threat gen was *much* easier than Classic, and you had no less than four different classes who could tank all the content the game had to offer. It got to the point where a tank just in blues could just speed through dungeons, even finishing each by the 11 minute mark. It was that fast, I know it because I've done it myself.
---
If you don't like it well then retail is just there for you to play. Am I saying Classic is perfect, no, but the reason I've playing it and not retail, is because I want that Classic experience overall. And no we are not going to get Wrath threat mechanics baked into Classic.
---
Yeah what i ment by saying "Nerfed" is how people actually expected it to be. Bad wording on my part.
---
Not the problem actually. It's the 100% lack of a taunt which kills them in later content. 5 mans they're slow because of drinking but in raids they can't tank swap.
---
[Not from here](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community)
---
Though it is a month old data. Bigglesworth (if he was referring to that) was about 45/55 ally/horde, so still BS
---
I rerolled from Shazz alliance to Mograine horde, and yeah it seems pretty well balanced. Was absolutely the right choice
---
Is it better to say that it was buffed on private server, more than nerfed on classic?
---
I’m a Pally tank. I absolutely love it. Salvs on everyone and threat is never an issue. I’ve never even noticed this (what this post is about) as an issue, but maybe Benediction is abnormal.
---
Seriously though. These guys wasting so much effort theory crafting for such an already easy game is kinda sad.
---
where do you get the quest?
---
In my travels as a priest I stop and help any leveling priest I see because I leveled as holy and i know the struggle.  My favorite thing to do is tell them to tag as many as they can and I aoe them down out of grp so they get max xp
---
So did you want changes or not?
---
So not the same thing. A run is not a dungeon. The dungeon is still Maraudon. Run is something you say to specify what in the dungeon you want to do and i usually said in addition to the dungeon name, not instead.
---
needs more penis flyer imo
---
honestly, I don't mean to be rude or put you down, or be malicious, but grow up.
---
getting killed or getting camped by a level 19 with gear or a level 60 is both the same. could happen to anyone, it's never enjoyable, but it sure isn't bullying, it's what you signed up for when you chose a PVP realm.
---
sure, the practice might be lame, and the guys who do it might be lame.
---
but it's a part of the game.
---
Meanwhile hunters are doing tribute runs solo. Just make an alt if you have a priest and you'll make more gold in the long term.
---
Here's a link that has a very in-depth look at ratings; [WoW Wiki](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Critical_strike). Basically the idea is that, against a max level raid mob, our constants can be derived. The easiest explanation to me is that, more hit is more hit AND more crit (due to the fact that to get a crit, you must get a hit) whereas, more crit is more crit. Hope this helps!
---
RP servers are PvP, and they're glorious.
---
Locks should be tapping while fighting.  What I like to do on my lock is to dot up everything and then life tap a few times, or if nuking boss I tap after a shadowbolt.
---
That's not optimization. That's bullying with extra steps as the title said, what you're saying it's an excuse if you are actively searching for weaker players. Only one in 10 BG will give you fair fights and in open world you will not find fair fights in level appropriate zones, so you optimized your bullying to the max, that's true, but don't try and pretend like you want fair fights.
---
Did you screenshot your mount before logging out ?
---
If you did post it. And maybe the post will get enough attention and get some GM to turn the bots off and actually investigate the situation.
---
They punish people for botting, then they make bots that punish and auto-respond to people.
---
Orb reserved strat live runs are the closest thing tanks have really.
---
PServers are trash and trusting info from them is a coin flip at best.
---
Assuming you didnt buy any of that gold you say you farmed this is not a good thing for blizz to have happening.
---
How's shaman tanking? Relaxed or tryhard? Can you do it as ele to or is enhance a must?
---
Theres a guy in DM:West that gives you the quest I believe
---
Wow lol, i did an arena yesterday and there were 3 full raid groups fighting for it.
---
meanwhile on stallag horde camp southshore graveyard and kill flight master
---
Main a Druid. It takes a lot of effort.. constantly mashing buttons, swapping forms, healing, debuffinf, dotting, etc.  I love it, but not always in the mood.
---
Looking for a class to play solo with as a chill alt.  A class that will let me enjoy the scenery as I'm fighting without such an intense set of rotations.
---
Any suggestions?  Would mostly be soloing aside from occasional dungeon quests.
---
To be fair that crossbow is very important for a war, especially if they are a troll and need 9% hit.
---
Enter DM north, go down to the library, get the quest from the one lorekeeper. Then kill hydrospawn the water ele Boss in DM east, hand in quest, done.
---
&gt; you end up with a run where your healer is running on fumes half the time
---
You say that like this is a bad thing. I'm fine running a dungeon where I am on the edge of being oom and the run is going breakneck speed. I've got oh-shit buttons for when pulls go wrong.
---
The other option is I literally fall asleep because it is so fucking boring and faceroll.
---
&gt;Every so often they will need to drink to semi-full if your dungeon group is pulling a good hefty amount as they should, and that's when the dps and tank should eat some food.
---
All this changes depending on your comp. If you are doing mega-aoe pulls, then obviously everyone should be eating/drinking/whatever after the big pulls.
---
You probably got downvoted so blizzard couldn’t see your comment. That’s probably the logic behind it
---
This is another potential issue that we have to handle internally.
---
Blizzard still banned someone for joking about starting a pool for seeing what items dropped off rag.
---
I don't see much rage in jeppeake's comments, to be fair.
---
Seriously? One deviation is now the symptom of a larger issue? How are you determining this?
---
That quantity of gold is not hard to get to be honest.
---
its a good way to go about it lol. I'm at 33 with my hunter alt and loving it :)
---
Unless you get a few lucky epic boes I wouldn't bank on having an epic when you ding 60
---
Ahhyeee, gottem
---
It's ALOT easier to farm it with a group of 5.
---
Bloodvine is BoE but requires tailoring to use. You can double check me if you want but I remember there being a reason in ZG that mages stayed tailoring.
---
Just get rhok. 
---
If youre a diehard pugger that cant guild cause of schedule, you want to meet and be friends with the good players that run good pugs. You wont be making any friends by stealing strikers.
---
Being in on the better pugs will be crucial if you ever want bwl xbow.
---
My friends started on a PvP server and convinced me to move from a normal to theirs. They started bitching about getting ganked by horde and quit Classic after I got to lvl 30. Now I feel like Ive gone too far on that to go back. Really annoying
---
I mean the crazy thing is, even if people stop playing, they can actually come back later and start playing again. I know it's insane to hear and some might not believe it's possible, but it's true.
---
It is easier, strategies are so well known, bosses are significantly easier than private servers (in terms of boss damage).
---
There are some things that don't work on classic, that work on private servers and that's fine there are many other things we can do.
---
Get that retail attitude out of classic. Go run your M+ keys that cater to your playstyle. Let us keep our TBC pace. Spoken like a true dps whose never tanked before.
---
Just mark them with skull and stun them btw. It's also not a stun, it's a gouge, you can force break it by chaning your stun into a taunt. This keeps them targetting you, and honestly in ubrs with an extra dps they'll die before they get to actually do anything to you. Hell, you probably won't even have to pay attention to the mob. If you get unlucky and have 2 in a pack, then just pick 1 to cc.
---
I'm enjoying playing on a PvP server despite not engaging in PvP myself. Sure, I get ganked easily because I don't fight back, but the joy I get by helping out random people of the other faction in the world when they see me, pause and think "shit, here we go" but then end up thanking me is worth it. I get more fun out of helping the red names when I could just as easily attack than I get annoyance out of being ganked. Just a personal quirk I guess lol
---
Rank 1 fireball for the dot then when he unstealths from the dot, kite him

 You can go straight to desolace, the stormwind quest is optional
---
Now cmon.  I’m trying to give you a decent set of reasons and it feels like you’re just lashing out a bit.  So no, my reasoning is not simply “I got bullied, now it’s time to bully”. It’s a bit more nuanced than that.  I already am good at the game and can pvp at a upper medium to high level.  Did I win any arena seasons?  Nope, but I can play.  I twink to make sure I’m not going to be outgeared.  In my experience, twinks were fairly common and usually comprised 40-45% of any battleground and obviously much higher in premade v premade.  So if you just got facerolled by a bunch of twinks while you leveled and played bgs, sorry for your experience but in a game where gear gives you an advantage in pvp and pve and is the #1 carrot on a stick that makes us keep grinding content, it seems reasonable that people are going to go for better gear.  I’m going you realize after reading some of the responses that 60 pvp actually has a greater chance for gear disparity.
---
Getting a winterspring mount requires zero skill. It just takes commitment.
---
People are generally complete assholes, so tanking is often a miserable job and anything that goes wrong is your fault.   Because of that I only tank for groups of friends.
---
Well yeah, that's the only place that drops.
---
If he only partly chose hunter for DM, then he wouldn’t have rerolled as there were still other reasons he chose hunter
---
I'm saying that they aren't all homeless impoverished apes irl, therefore they have some source of income.  Not that they're all streamers/content creators.
---
It'll work this time!
---
Who were hesoyam on pservers?
---
The orbs from strath live is because there is legit no reason for a tank to ever do start live. The orbs are to bribe them into coming.
---
funny thing healer passed rest needed (warrior still won it) well deserved =)
---
That’s them
---
2 solutions to fix this.
---
Tanks SHOULD ALWAYS be tanking wit ha weapon and SHIELD (Anyone who does otherwise is a moron and the reason that the groups wipe)
---
A HoT spell should be more than enough to heal the dps.
---
If the tank is pulling more than he can handle, thats on him, its the TANKS Responsibility to keep everyone alive. 
---
If the group wipes, its the tanks fault, plain and simple.
---
As someone who buys out and resells tons of crap in the AH with a few hundred open bids at any time, this frightens me. Will I get flagged for exchanging a few hundred/thousand gold in one day?
---
While I think I get your point, I think that the issue is how these terms are defined. Different people view these differently and you attribute that to malice rather than a simple difference of opinion.  For example, you use the term ganking in relation to someone who is 60 and picking on lower levels. How great does the level disparity have to be to constitute ganking? Someone who is 5, 10, 20, 30+ levels higher than you?  What about someone waiting til you are engaged with a challenging mob before they attack? Someone who waits until you are low on health to engage? Someone who only jumps you when they have a significant numerical advantage? Are all of these considered ganking?  Who decides? While there is no benefit in terms of rank right now, some like to practice their skills so they can be ready when they add honor in future patches.
---
I try to look at  PvP as an expansion or extension of PvE gameplay. Sure, it will interfere with my PvE at times which can be frustrating, but sometimes it will also bring enhanced enjoyment.   
---
Bottom line: While you may attribute malicious intent or pathological reasons for behavior you dislike, there may be an alternative perspective to consider.
---
I honestly just hope he can get a decent job when/if his streaming career dies. He makes great videos, so I do hope people will keep supporting him!
---
Biggest question: What’s the official word on keyrings?

one friend of mine who always quits games as soon as they get challenging quit at lvl 30 with his hunter.

Yea I screenshotted hitting exalted and the mount. Will upload when I’m home

It's seasonal. Once you do a quest in a contested/shared zone and you can party up with 3-4 people with one 60 being around mining or something.
---
Then you go to the bathroom and suddenly 4 low hordies are there with 2 60s guarding them. You get ganked 4-5 times, whine a bit in zone chat, no response, no alliance in the zone.
---
You grab some food from the fridge and come back to 2-3 lv60s sitting on the horde corpses and you can quest again.
---
And then the cycle repeats.
---
Why is that strange?
---
It takes less than a week if you play 10+hrs a day.

I stopped reading at “keep in mind there’s no game mechanic for doing this”
---
There doesn’t have to be. If you don’t like competition in the overworld then play pve. Ez fix.

I have both Last Stand and Shield Wall, but no points in Arms means I'm missing 5% parry and the ability to stance dance (no Anger Management).  Certainly there are some fights where this doesn't really matter (tank and spank raid bosses), but any boss which requires stance dancing for Intercept, Berserker Rage (think Onyxia and Magmadar), and any boss where every point of mitigation matters will be better tanked by someone else.

I got my druid to 30 then tried retail again after being gone for 8 months, finally finished my Zandalari grind and Flying rep grind.
---
Now grinding a mage to 120 so I can pvp, kinda want to give classic a try, however I am an altoholic and classic is very alt unfriendly with how much time and effort it takes to level
