Weak or strong, it's the definitive answer.  PvP, specifically BGs, are the pinnacle cooperative endgame content in Classic.
---
---
---
wow I really appreciate your in depth comment, thank you!
---
Because a lot of "private server elitists" such as myself don't like leveling. It's really as a simple as that. For me the game doesn't even start until lvl 60. I HATE leveling. I understand for a lot of people leveling is fun and they like to take their time. People like different things, but at the end of the day we all love Classic WOW!

Cocaine
---
Sounds like you’ve never done it before and don’t know how it is gonna affect you. Wouldn’t recommend popping some pills you’ve never done on launch day
---
I'm going to inject vyvanse into my jugular vein. 
---
cocaine is famous for overdose isnt it? but id take it over adderall if im going to get better results
---
Jesus blizzard, please give us some more news. We are over here discussing what we should theoretically do if we theoretically get a drop. 
---
If only all classes were completely balanced in vanilla. Would love to Druid heal. But priest r 2 fun n 2 op
---
ive seen this name before, is vyvanse a better version of adderall with less side effects?

---
It wasn't in vanilla, let's not get in classic. Easy, deal with it. I'm oke with queue times and having patience for mobs or quests objectives to respawn. Maybe I'll make a few friends while waiting.
---
You're making the game casual again like it happened in retail. I thought Foxes didn't get caught twice in the same snare...

Modafinil
---
You have your opinion,, I use logic ans history to learn of my mistakes.
---
Not if you understand dosing
---
It has become a niche game, not for everyone I agree. I hope the population drops so I don't have to deal with BFA plebs
---
INB4 "waaaahhh, not enough content!"
---
Yeah but a lot of people play without showing helmets and most early helmets look stupid anyway, but with shoulders you dont feel so naked anymore
---
Lmao, sorry to laugh but: PWNED!!
---
What is delicious about it ? P servers can do it ? Activision just wants to make more money of it by making it shared subscription and b net integration. BFA players will buy tokens with gold or real money and that's how there is essentially already an in-game cash shop in wow classic. You're delusional, you just don't know it yet
---
Serious response. If you want to lower the competition to complete quests, adjust your sleep schedule and play during off-peak times.
---
Nost was nothing like that, and as far as I know, certain p servers are upholding that. Not all, I grant you, but some.
---
Again, I've been there since the start and yeah, Blizzard has a bad rep by now. But if they lie about this then we all move on and really, what is lost? This will either be good or it wont and we need to be constructive in how we attempt to guide Blizzard on it. Tearing them down as many are doing will not make the game better, and I think BFV is recent proof enough that acting like angry assholes on the net gets us labeled and ridiculed, whether we are right or wrong.
---
the secret is to play more than everyone else
---
I recommend meth. It is cheaper then Adderall and will net the same results. Should hit 60 in one sitting for like 30 bucks in meth. 
---

---
* Missing teeth,  impregnating your sister, weight loss, or in some cases death are side effects. 
---
I really agree with this. Seeing people on retail at level 120 without shoulders (hidden through Xmog) look so naked :l
---
&gt;That's for the scenario of launch.
---
Which is what this thread is describing.
---
&gt;As much as people shit on Gnomer, the amount of XP you can get from there
---
I'm not an expert on Gnomer in particular, but most of the time you can't complete the 5+ dungeon quests that are available for a particular dungeon for your particular fashion in a single run.
---
&gt;and the items can be carried into end game (primarily talking about the water breathing staff)
---
Which can be attained at a later point in the game in a far shorter time span.
---
Yes, dungeons are useful for padding your XP bar to reduce zone switching, and while the items won't speed up your levelling in the grand scheme of things, they can very much make it more enjoyable to level. But dungeons just aren't good for rushing to 60 and there's really no point in defending them in that regard.
---
in BFA, it's more accurate to say:
---
&gt;Fuck I got another hands slot for the fourth time in a row.. fucking RNG"
---
... it just dropped for me on a private server
---
Make it stop blizzard. Just release the game already, pleaseeee 
---
Can't argue with you there. I might personally run some tests to see if some dungeons should have a priority. Dungeons like RFC, some of the SM wings, and RFK feel like a complete waste of time, where as others feel incredibly efficient. 
---
That has me wondering if there are any dungeons that accelerate XP gain. I know some can help finish off zones if you decide to group often while questing. 
---
I played Worms WMD over Christmas. It's really quite fun doing all the so no campaigns and something a bit different that can occupy you for 10+ hours if you 100% all of it.
---
Pay a chinese kid to do it. 
---
Darrowshire.
---
According to what you said, seems the same to me
---
I tend to not any problems staying awake for 30 hours with just a few mugs of coffee.
---
Yea I can definitely see the respect, I just don't anticipate we'll get the same shock and awe that came from the first time someone went into IF in full T3
---
Its famous for being very expensive.
---
No. Yes.
---
For all I know, there will only be the one PVE Oceanic server to join. Will make my choice easy.
---
I suck at time zones... 19:00 CET is when for East coast USA? Also AM/PM thanks!
---
Don't we only start anything in life only once?
---
Even big corporations rarely repeat the same mistakes twice. And Blizzard just fired it's CFO so... they're seeing the numbers going down.
---
Classic needs to be classic. Everyone on Blizzards end understands this and even the marketing department knows about this. Classic exists BECAUSE retail numbers are dropping. Not because the fans wanted classic. It's quite the coup to keep player numbers somewhat stable. That's why I don't see anything happen to classic for the forseeable future. 
---
First run of classic will remain classic.
---
If this one is successful, I believe that Blizzard will re-launch classic about a year or two down the line with a progressive server timeline for classic&gt;tbc&gt;wrath (their mayor growth market). And with wrath then we have the options for shop stuff =)
---
Where did you get this OP?
---
Oh thanks! Original post
---
Private servers will officially be rip offs of a current money making version of wow. "moral" is not quite the way I would describe it lol.
---
I have that skin
---
Someone already said it. Pay for leveling instead. The drugs will mess up your late game at some point in time because you will need 5 days of sleep
---
It’s 1-10 zones of which none are contested
---
You can say whatever you want but M10+ are harder than anything Vanilla can throw at you. 
---
Nobody should ever be getting banned for ninjaing through master looter.
---
Everyone in the raid agreed to have them as the master looter, and the master looter ultimately decides who gets what.
---
Enough of the care bear shit.
---
Why would you want to be ahead of the pack?. Stv is more fun when the masses are leveling there
---
Technically, but so can Warlocks.
---

Lol she was holding the Frostmourne ? Also such good skin I love it 
---
Safer to go TBC with the current state of blizzard, but with good devs i absolutely would want that.
---
If the fresh server experience is fighting hundreds of people for the same 10 kobolds in northshire then I’ll take sharding 100% of the time.
---
I want to play the game, not faking trying to tag a mob for 4 hours.
---
That sounds more like nostalgia than anything. Is having 8 or 16 debuff slots really what made vanilla fun? Is it what made raiding enjoyable? I think we all know the answer to that is no.
---
Now bosses being to easy because of bloated dps is a real concern, and that will already be an issue given the use of 1.12 talents, gear from DM, player skill being way higher, and years of knowledge and reaserch into min maxing. 
---
I think i mentioned something like this around Blizzcon, after seeing the state of the demo, I'd be a little surprised if they actually make the summer release date, and if they do make it, if it's not a mess.
---
Don't get me wrong, I want Classic tomorrow, but it seems to me that they have a TON of work left to do, dungeons and raids weren't' even working at Blizzcon, at all.
---
The sooner the better imo.  I'd really like to see a long beta.
---
I would never go to TBC. Reasons: Even more insane imbalance(Warlocks/Druids/Glaives), Flying mounts(Puke), Really cool raids but I progressed on every boss in TBC and played the SHIT out of it when it was current. Not doing it again.
---
its not roleplaying if im just being sucked up to by the game, i dont need patronizing
---
[removed]
---
Haha yes. I havent played retail since Wotlk and even then numbers got out of hand. 
---
Then I saw a random fight on youtube and the dps did crit for 550k and had 5M hp. I was like wtf did happen. 
---
What's worse is that the entire quest line is basically forgotten until Legion (12 years later irl time or whatever) expansion where everyone gets artifacts. There is absolutely no follow up to the Scythe of Elune stuff until balance druids go and recover it from the nazghulish-artifact hunters that reside in the basement of karazhan.
---
It's fun. Never got into Runescape back in the day, but I was a hardcore theorycrafter back in vanilla / bc days, it's nice to be home.
---
I'm very excited for it too. I'm trying to stay away from private servers until it releases so it will seem more fresh. 
---
Friends convinced me to start tanking mythic + so I'm doing that right now. Its alright and kind of fun but more stressful and twitchy than vanilla's slower, strategic gameplay. I won't miss it one bit when classic comes out.
---
I don't PVP.
---
Is that frostmourne? I’m thinking ashkhandi and quell serrar 
---
Calm down, retard. I never once said you were pitching it to anyone. I made a comment explaining my original sentiment after you replied a full day after I left it.
---
Your bringing your own delusions in and making a victim of yourself when I gave you nothing but a simple reply and even told you I was glad if you enjoyed it.
---
I am personally hoping they release Classic servers for 2.5 years, perhaps with a few fresh servers every now and then for those who enjoy such a thing, then release new TBC servers and allow your character to be copied (one way; no return) to them, or (what I will do) reroll.
---
If they were to progress the original Classic servers all to TBC, that could work too, and I’d be ok with it, but I think some people would be upset because they want to stay at 60 raiding Naxx and ganking in STV forever.
---
Of course, the next logical step would be WotLK, implemented just like TBC, but I actually would want some MAJOR changes to Wrath:
---
-1 size per raid: (Naxx = 10man, Vault of Archovan = 10, Sarth = 25, Malygos = 25, Ulduar = 25, ToC = 10man, ICC = 25 man, Ruby Sanctum = 10man)
---
-NO HEROIC MODE RAIDS! Ulduar-style hard modes are ok; just make the normal mode raids have the heroic mechanics if you can’t make a Firefighter style hard mode for every boss.
---
-NO LFG ADDED IN 3.3!
---
This is my ideal classic experience which would provide 6-7 years worth of gaming!
---
I had dialup so it took a week of on and off downloading the patches while everybody slept, I had so much trouble deciding a class, I played picked an UD rogue could not for the LIFE of me figure out why the game felt so bad ( I was using click to move because I had been playing diablo for years). Stopped playing to look up some stuff find out that people were playing with the WASD keys, had trouble wrapping my head around that ( I was mostly a console peasant at that time). Finally got the movement and fighting down and then found out how bad my ping was in world pvp (because of the dialup,) so I rerolled a few times to spellcasters, who weren't as penalized in pvp as melee with dialup.
---
I thought about this myself, at some point two or three years or so after launch, many players are going to be t3 with no way to continue except to reroll. Perhaps either making a progression server where you can continue to TBC content at some point ooooorrrrr release TBC content scaled down for lv 60 and adding TBC landscapes etc. Maybe a solution. Either way many won't like it. But realistically in vanilla I played for years to get into naxx and had not quite cleared it when TBC was on the cusp and gear stats were leaked. That ended up killing my guild as many didn't see the point in continuing with t3 content when in a few weeks they would be able to replace most of it when they hit 66 or so.  Every xpac since has had a similar effect.  The downside to making another server for progress will be fragmenting of the existing player base, but so will stale content after x years. They just need to crunch the numbers are figure out what's best for the majority of classic players.  I know catering to the majority is what got wow into it's current lameness, but sometimes it's the best thing of a bunch of bad options. Hell, I'd be okay with every 3 years they released a new xpac that goes into different content completely than TBC, wotl,cata,mop. This time the play style staying true to vanilla, that might be a viable option too.
---
 Many things to consider though and getting a good classic comes first and foremost.
---
Thank you, kind sir.
---
You’re right! Is Quel’Serrar
---
Lol sorry the aspect really remember Frostmourne 
---
&gt; I might personally run some tests to see if some dungeons should have a priority. 
---
Pst, that's the guide I'm proposing here. You're free to corroborate it!
---
&gt;Dungeons like RFC, some of the SM wings, and RFK feel like a complete waste of time, where as others feel incredibly efficient.
---
Completely mixed bag. Stocks is super quick, very XP dense with close quest turn-ins --- but almost literally 0 items. Very likely be a 100% do once thing. SM quest "In the Name of the Light" has a reward weapon that might last me 18 hours. It'll vary class by class.
---
Itsssss might!!!
---
Thank you for your concern. I'll be fine.
---
Some of us have already done stv countless of time, being ahead of the pack has some advantages, you have the whole world to farm (black lotus/devilsaur will get you rich real quick), and people who gets to 60 fast will most likely have an easier time while finding a good guild. You'll prolly be one of the first doing raids.
---
In early Vanilla, warlocks had it pretty rough, so there is actually some truth to that... no horrify on deathcoil was a major thing, some other smaller buffs they received as well.
---
Shaman vs Lock was relatively balanced in my experience around 1.12.
---
I just upgraded my gear with random greens from the auction house in a classic server and doubled my health pool with slight stam upgrades on every item... It's great.
---
/e [your name] pickpockets %t for 2 silver, 30 copper.
---
Always got whispers on my rogue from people demanding that I give their money back or threatening to open a ticket and get me banned. It works better if you have several macros with differing amounts.
---
I love this. They can't main tank a lot of end content, but in a few cases, they are superior off tank.
---
I wouldn't mind heroic 5-mans being added to Vanilla. Make them difficult enough to require Naxx gear. I'm not sure what the rewards should be though. I've no interest in venturing on to TBC.
---
Got the trial and started downloading the game; took like a day and a half... I had a root canal with laughing gas that day (this was before I’d taken recreational drugs, so I had no idea I was high as shit), and when I got home, the download finished.
---
I rolled a Troll Rogue named Zentaki (it seemed fitting for him), didn’t use sinister strike because I came from Runescape and had no concept of using abilities, and I had no concept of questing so I just grinded... 
---
I made it to level 6 or 7, walked into the Centaur area southwest of Senjin, died, couldn’t figure out how to get back to my corpse and quit
---
triangle is sleep i am triggered
---
Warlocks and druids were only oo in s1. Every class had a good chance of being up there. Hell, we had a healshaman with a 3k rating on our server. Tbc was def more balanced and to your point of fatigue on tbc content, you should try a privatserver and experience any sort of fatigue first hand. I bet you wont experience any

---
Yes its t2 wrath and these two weapons. 
---
Then what after Wrath? Cata? Fresh servers which also have a limited life-span because people can only reroll and level to 60 so many times? Or do all the servers just go on life support forever until interest wanes and the game dies? 
---
I'd be excited for classic wow if it didn't have a sub
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
$40-60 purchase to play always (while servers are running) or play for free if you are subbed to regular wow. Requiring a sub will kill the game. Not many will want to sub just for classic and it is basically a full time game to raid. So much farming of mats for consumables, resist gear, dungeon gear, gold, devilsaur leather...
---
Sure it'll be great for the first patch and each update but it will hemorrhage players . Then the servers will be low pop... Then more players will leave because of the servers being more empty... They'll need to do a lot of server management
---
Seems like it will be a mismanaged disaster and then end with an "I told you no one wanted this!"
---
That would be awesome. It might be hard to maintain afloat though if you keep splitting the population again and again... But they can always merge the smaller server servers together when a wave moves to TBC. Man, I'd love that.
---
There's also the issue of making the map so much bigger. Older content becomes less relevant and it gets harder to find people and run dungeons/elite quests/etc. 
---
yikes
---
Oh boy, nobody gave a shit :'(
---
BUT in the name of the light requires a trek through desolace, then to Hillsbrad then to SM. Which is a massive time sink. So would a different weapon be more valuable in time saved? Understanble that it could be BiS for the level range but how much is that worth?
---
I personally say either the first option or the last option!
---
I would love if they remade every expansion along the lines of the changes I suggested for WotLK but that obviously isn’t realistic. Also don’t change the old world in Cataclysm! Just keep the 80+ content!
---
Realistically though, merging servers as needed and having a Classic, TBC, and LK refuges for whoever wants to go wherever is the way to go
---
Is that sword skin available in retail? i would love to have it for transmog.
---
For raiding, your spec can be whatever but you need to heal. The only important Holy talents are the first 20 or 21 of them. It's very common for Paladins to be Retribution with rest in Holy for healing and utility - 21/0/30 or 20/0/31 which is good for both raiding and general PvP and PvE. Another option is 31/0/20 where you get access to Holy Shock and rest in Retribution. Also good for everything really. The only spec that is 100% focused for PvP is the one based on Reckoning.
---
So you want Cata and Wrath except not Cata and Wrath, or the game to die of sub starvation. Got it.
---
That is quite the strawman argument you have there!
---
No, I want Wrath and Cata content without the arbitrary raid difficulties which detract from the raiding experience
---
It has nothing to do with nostalgia. Nobody is nostalgic towards the debuff limit (I hope). It's just that the increased debuffs mean the content will be easier. For me personally that's fine, but others want it to be as hard as it was back in the day.
---
Would make a lot more sense to just rebalance around unlimited debuffs 
---
Might is T1.
---
This is hilarious because I did the same thing. I was fiending this shit
---
Wrath*
---
 &gt; Sure, what makes MMOs special is that the world offers so many different styles of play. You can be motivated to explore, or PvP, or craft/trade, or do speed runs through dungeons, or, yes, raid.
---
But to do any of those things competitively (except maybe "explore", which is a pretty meaningless behaviour in vanilla WoW) you need raid drops. Which requires you to cooperate with other people and fulfil a role. Which means that WoW is not a good game for you to "challenge yourself" by being deliberately bad at group efforts. That is perfectly fine behaviour in single-player games, but weird and selfish in a class/gear-based collective action game.
---
So thinking that this behaviour ought to be catered to over the desires of people who actually want to play cooperatively is weird.
---
&gt; I don't want to screw around with a failed build.
---
Word of God is that every spec was intended to be viable, hence every non-viable spec is a failed spec.
---
&gt; I don't think I'm entitled to any such thing. Blizzard is not changing the specs.
---
I see you are changing the subject from what would be good game design or sensible behaviour, to what you think Blizzard will actually do.
---
&gt; "Bad" -- there's more of this black and white absolutism. You seem like a player that thinks "good" == "ideal for raiding" and "bad" == "undesirable for raiding."
---
More of this idiotic retreat into wild subjectivism? Do I need to remind you that the topic is specifically PvE raiding, so this constant attempt to drag in other activities is irrelevant?
---
A raid boss's enrage timer does not care that you are a special snowflake trying ever so hard with your ret paladin or whatever. It only cares how many points of damage you can do before it goes off. If you aren't pulling your weight you are bad, and that is a simple mathematical fact. It is not in any way an opinion.
---
&gt; Consider that everything you're saying rests on the belief that meme specs are "bad" because their numbers suck. You are actually missing out on an entire universe of gaming possibilities because of that fixation.
---
The person fixated here is you - fixated on trying to justify getting your particular kicks out of WoW when it is an absolutely terrible game for that purpose, and much better games for that kind of fun are readily available.
---
Don't play Bridge if you want to show off your miming skills. Miming in Bridge is breaking the rules. Go play charades, which is perfect for what you want.
---
You are not a special, creative, artistic soul because you want to play a bad spec in WoW. Nor is anyone else mean or bad or boring or unimaginative for noticing that what you are doing is not hard, not clever, and is actively counterproductive to what everyone else playing the game with you is trying to achieve.
---
&gt; I'm not talking about arbitrarily handicapping myself. I'm talking about the fun of exploring specs that weren't too popular. You don't see the difference, and it's making this conversation difficult.
---
It is because there literally is no difference. These specs have been thoroughly tested, theorycrafted and played by millions of people over many years. You aren't "exploring" anything that has not been done before, the reason why these specs are unpopular is just because they are objectively bad and if you take them you are deliberately handicapping yourself (and everyone who lets you in to a raid).
---
&gt; It's up to each and every guild to determine what "pulling your weight" means for each player.
---
More subjectivism? Seriously?
---
There is nothing subjective about doing half the damage a better class/spec would do, or your healing target dying, or you losing aggro on something you were meant to tank. It's a computer game, not abstract art appreciation. You don't get marked out of ten for DPS, out of ten for creative spec choice and out of ten for how fashionable your outfit is. You either do your job or you do not.
---
Whatever happens I just hope they don’t go the Runescape model, because Blizzard has demonstrated that they cannot be trusted, and giving in to the demands of the playerbase is how we ended up with the current state of WoW
---
And think they are better than they are. We had a healer bail on wc group one time. But we had 3 hunters and did the entire instance without a healer using pet tanks and kiting. We did better without relying on his heals, and yet he bailed, because our group wiped once.
---
Jokes aside that looks amazing. Too bad the game is horrible these days.
---
Mainly because it would be a huge change to content difficulty and class balance. Obviously we can't replicate exactly what vanilla was like in Classic considering our current knowledge and the fact we have to do a somewhat intelligent patch/content cycle, but a core principle in Classic is finding a balance between preserving balance/difficulty and common sense and I think most people would agree 16 debuff slots is the right balance. I don't know if anyone would know would 1.12 raiding would look like with unlimited debuff slots, but I think we can agree it would look very different to vanilla.
---
To expand on this (i.e. content being easier), it will change the "meta" of damage from different classes. Anything with DoTs will do more damage, you can apply more debuffs which reduce boss damage or increase damage taken, which means it dies faster as well as tanks taking less damage.
---
And I want Classic but with paladins having a viable spec outside of holy, except it wouldn't be classic then.
---
Not me. 
---
I like to level fast but my life is slot easier with some sweet blues and some blues are almost stupidly good. 
---
As horde atleast you get a great sword in bfd, amazing swords from SM and RFD, Thrash blade from Mara is almost BiS and people gonna do Princess runs that enable you to snag it quickly. 
---
Ive just leveled a warrior on a pserver and I will def do alot of dungeons (again) to get ahead the leveling curve (zone levels) to get a easier time. That and good blues really makes a difference. 
---
You underestimate our power!
---
I love vanilla but retail mythic raids are miles harder than vanilla raiding
---
**6-8** months
---
Id rather them just up the debuff limit and then up the health of the mobs, I hated spamming SB as a warlock when I had so many dots and other things that would have kept me occupied.
---
I'm not saying none of those are allowed...
---
I'm trying to do the math to say what's beneficial and what's not.
---
I'm 100% doing SM as close to 34 as I can for a sweet-ass axe.
---
But you yourself mentioned only 4 instances. I'm guessing that's because you spent a bunch of time on several different sites, reading 20 different leveling guides to guide you to what BiS is during leveling?
---
I'm just trying to condense the dungeon element of that. Paladin? Duneons A, B, and C are worthwhile for gear, and A, B, F, and H are good for XP. Rogue, A, F, G / C, E, J, etc.
---
&gt; I can just unequip it at the start **and roll need**
---
No. No you cannot. Or at least, you could not in the most recent version of loot trading Blizzard used. That version only let you trade loot that was acquired by greed rolls.
---
If you can explain to me how trading loot acquired by greed rolls has any bad consequences at all, please do so.
---
Otherwise please stop running around telling people the sky is falling.
---
XD yeeeee, it's not might haha. I always mix those two up.
---
Ashkhandi as 1hand? What's this heresy?!
---
TBC was on the cusp and gear stats were leaked. That ended up killing my guild as many didn't see the point in continuing with t3 content when in a few weeks they would be able to replace most of it when they hit 66 or so.
---
That sucks man. There is something really wrong here I cant quite put into words. It's just reminding me of the instant gratification state retail is in now.
---
This is a false equivalence which once again avoids addressing my actual point... quite the fallacious one, you are!
---
In WotLK ICC had 4 difficulties... that is simply poor game design and which detracts from the experience of the raid...
---
Cata old world revamp is 100% irrelevant to the 80-85 content except for loose story threads (which I guarantee people aren’t playing older iterations of WoW for the stories)
---
I’m not suggesting anything like rebalancing classes or even loot (you are demonstrating a lack of understanding about how convoluted the WotLK raiding system which went forward to the end of MoP actually was).
---
Fairly sure those were added in mid-late Vanilla. I definitely don't remember them when I started out.
---
Idk as someone who played since classic, being called hero and champion makes sense in BFA. Ive defeated cthun, stopped illidan, killed the lich king, killed deathwing, captured garrosh, did wat ever the fuck my character was supposed to do in WoD, and pushed back the burning legion. Like at this point i would frankly be pissed if that wasn’t recognized. 
---
But at the same time, it gets tiring to have the hero story and its fun to have something different at times. 
---
That's the modern version of tryhard elitist, they are not actually tryhards, they just pretend to be, but on the first obstacle they are out.
---
Grats in advance, for when you get those cloth shoulders.
---
Made me laugh 
---
Going from a 25DPS weapon that's considered BIS from 20-35 to a 38DPS weapon that's solid maybe until Icebarb at 51?
---
If you're leveling in Desolace at 32-34 to plan for this, it's a short flight to Auberdine then to Menethil, and a flight to Southshore. 100% worth.
---
I think adding new raids and content without changing the systems underneath it all would be a good way to go. Maybe even a few daily quests here and there?
---
God damn, what kind of OP items are Alliance getting!? That does sound nice af.
---
Not just a chore, a chore that YOU HAVE TO DO AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE THERE'S NO TIME TO TALK JUST PULL
---
That's kinda saddening. If that's a word.
---
Not that you spent the time playing, a lot of us did. But just that your family thought of a good gift for your interests. But would only be good for a fire starter.
---
Did you tell them it was useless? 
---
While priests may not be in the forefront of the rushers, we will still be ahead of the pack, by 35ish - mage+priest AOE will take the lead and aoe grinding and if persistent spawning is gonna be a thing - GG bois
---
I think I love you.
---
You dont want that. You think you do. But you dont.
---
This is a bit besides the topic, but you are trying to present a view that you don't hold and as such can't effectively argue for it, making the discussion lopsided. Essentially you are presenting and then discussing a strawman. I haven't heard anyone say they want x limits because of " just nostalgia", but because they want the game as it was, which is related to but a separate concept.
---
I feel like your reasoning could be used for anything. Why not change the traveller's backpack to be an 18 slot bag? Not having a good reason to be against that besides "because vanilla had 16 slots" isn't really "nostalgia hunting", it is simply a stance of wanting to recreate what was. If you like a recipe your mom used to make when you were a kid, not wanting to change the recipe isn't necessarily nostalgia. You just liked how it was and changes would need heavy argumentation.
---
Battle Shout generates 55 threat for each player that is buffed, as long as they are on the relevant mobs threat list. So, if your party is not tightly grouped at the time not all players will generate threat. In any case, if you do get the full 275 divided by 3 to = 92 for each of the three mobs in this case how is that better than the 260 threat that each Sunder Armor will generate. You can spam Sunder Armor to each of the 3 mobs for 260 threat each, which is better than 92 each.  Or am I missing something? 
---
Battle Shout can be superior to Sunder Armor for threat generation if you are dealing with AOE of 6 or more mobs. 
---
"That weapon imba" 
---
&gt;BFA players will buy tokens with gold or real money and that's how there is essentially already an in-game cash shop in wow classic
---
Yes, I'm sure tons of Classic players will be jumping at the opportunity to sell Classic gold for retail gold. /s
---
&gt;P servers can do it ?
---
And on a technical level, so can Blizzard. But if you don't see the issue with a company releasing software that is 12-14 years old, throwing away all the tech improvements they've made over that time, then I don't know what to say to you.
---
And the sword/dagger is alliance only. But the horde benefit more because if memory serves me well the horde quest gives an amazing level 29 twink weapon 
---
If memory serves me well, uldum has a sword drop in that look. 
---
Bubble+Hearth 
---
If memory serves me right there is not aways enuf exp from quests to get you to next areas preferred levels and you will ider have to grind or do instances. So your grinding speed need to be factored into your calculation if you are a hunter then np but as a paladin your exp/h will go down ones you have to grind. Not saying dungeons are always worth it. So plz share your calculations
---
Awe, you're missing the entire point of having a debuff limit. This guy doesn't min/max or even grasp the concept of how trivial the content would be with no debuff limits.
---
From the time before shammys where on both factions.  Unless you had serious altitude you wouldn’t make an alt on the other filthy faction .  No need to duel a whammy either, didn’t help you get better.
---
Why is she standing on a platform made of Lego bricks?
---
They were not.
---
They were designed to be hybrids. Hybrids simply didn't work after a certain point so they gave up and focused more on what players used them for, which was healers.
---
Priests was designed to be "the healer". Shaman, Druid and Paladins were hybrids with healing capabilities, but meant to be more of a flexible / supporting / enhancing role.
---
&gt;If memory serves me right there is not aways enuf exp from quests to get you to next areas preferred levels and you will ider have to grind or do instances.
---
Fixed in (someone correct me) 1.6-1.9 era. Questing is fine.
---
&gt; So your grinding speed need to be factored into your calculation if you are a hunter then np but as a paladin your exp/h will go down ones you have to grind. Not saying dungeons are always worth it. So plz share your calculations
---
My last test run I did ~120 hours 1-60 as a paladin with plenty of grinding. Paladins grind well. Calculations will be available.
---
fwar preraid bis with nightfall axe.
---
You're not wrong! That happened a while ago, and I hoped for a second that it would happen here as well.
---
They said starter zones. That doesn’t mean anything specifically. Most people assume the first zone but it could be up to level 20 zones.
---
My point being it really only ruins the game in contested zones on pvp servers, or on RP servers like at all. It’s not a huge game breaking thing that some people would have you believe. 
---
You would be surprised what twink would pay for gear. I remember back in cata when they grandfathered shadowfang. Shadowfangs were being sold for about 250k-300k in cata. 
---
[Bonebiter](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=6830) - horde has a 30dps 1 hand which is pretty awesome for tanking / dual wield.
---
Most people here failed to see your question and raged out instead.
---
To answer the question, yes, I would change class entirely.
---
I'm rolling a Warlock in Classic. I like locks, but went with them over warrior/rogue/mage because they can summon.
---
If they did a rebalance I'd roll druid for sure. I'd play mainly cat with bear offtank. I know it can be done without buffs and still be good, but I don't think I'm willing to do what it takes to become viable or semi-viable. 
---
Having had 2 max level druids before I'm not rolling a third resto druid either.
---
I can unfortunatly not remember the first time starting WoW, but thanks for sharing :)
---
This seems like way too much work to up your chance to win by 16% when you could just make a group of people that don't need it and get a 100% chance if it drops.
---
Platinum sword. Quest reward from Uldaman disks
---
Even with Sharding we will probably still have queue times, probably be lower but they’ll be there.
---
As prot whit /sit? Or deep ret?
---
Yeah I wish they would give some updates on small decisions like this
---
I'd avoid the game for 1-2 weeks if sharding wasn't a thing, so personally it doesn't make a difference for me. 
---
If sharding is there to stay I will simply quit and roll on a private server instead. Classic is not only going to be better than todays private servers, but also it's bound to make private servers better.
---
Only asking because I plan to level a paladin myself and I remember the grind to be on par whit a warriors and really boring
---
&gt; The worst abuse I ever seen of this was in wotlk
---
Well, the system was introduced in Wrath, and if you stopped playing there, then it was obviously the worst abuse you've seen of it.
---
Good. *mr. Burns plotting*
---
Good.
---
https://i.imgur.com/RRYrMv8.gif
---
If you're going warrior my advice is to get the bonebiter quest, then do SM if an opportunity arises, but use WWA as backup. Also consider Uldaman as an option because with all the quests there one run can be viable, and there's a chance at a great 2h sword.
---
What classes have 2 viable roles in raids? Since leveling takes much more of a commitment in vanilla, ild like to play a class that has 2 viable roles.
---
Good find!
---
Nice
---
I think the Silithid Ripper may actually be available for both, I remember getting it on a Dwarven Rogue I had a while ago on Retail I think.
---
Twinking on private servers doesn't usually exist. Unless there's a small dedicated community, which is doubtful because servers die so frequently.
---
The secret is to play more than everyone else, specifically on offpeak hours so you have little to no competition for quests
---
It’s not just champion, it’s savior of Azeroth, the single most important person in the world. Why the hell are you still taking orders from your faction leaders and their underlings when you are now an actual god in the Warcraft universe? It took 15 minutes into BfA to see that the story has definitely jumped the shark
---
Memespecs become more viable in naxx tbh. Stuff like oomkin and sp can give buffs to the real dps classes that make up for their own shortcomings.
---
Meanwhile hunters become so useless that in naxx most raids will have 2 tops lol.
---
Pretty much this. Get the +2 hit shoulders from the quest for killing Baelgar instead of truestrike for minimum butthurt.
---
Don't remind me. I'm super addicted to a classic ffxi server right now and gonna be torn.
---
I am really excited to have to work for gear again. I still remember the struggle to match gear, and that was a beautiful thing. 
---
Just do some exercise every day, down lots of coffee, and eat healthily. It'll honestly help way more. Maybe have some podcasts or something ready to go too. Most drugs will cause you to crash later on and you need to keep going for a whole week.
---
I came here to say this too.    
---
It's prescribed for narcolepsy.
---
I took it once when I needed to work a night shift, move house the following morning, then work another night shift.
---
By the end of it all, I was exhausted but still couldn't sleep.    
---
It felt like I'd been taking amphetamines.    
---
I'd only taken 1/2 a pill of modafinil.
---
My housemate at the time was taking a full pill or 2 daily in the mornings.    
---
He said it kept him clear and sharp at work and he never had any issues falling asleep.
---
It’s a content nerf if they don’t have the old debuff limit - it’s as simple as that. 
---
all according to keikaku
---
Interesting that WoW made so much money for Blizz, then Blizz kills WoW and finally WoW comes back to save Blizz. But will it be a Blizz worth saving by then?
---
In my head, the narrator is Morgan Freeman.
---
Stop stealing that person's artwork and trying to make money off it.
---
All you have to do is smile and say thanks. No need to be a dick about it.
---
Lol I don't think anyone playing a 14 year old fantasy rpg is anywhere near a raging alpha male.
---
Most wow players probably look more like pandas in real life
---
If you go warrior you might want dead mines aswell staff of westfall is a really good weapon 
---
Deep ret. /sit reck builds won't work in classic, so not useful to plan for.
---
If your concern is to make levelling easier and faster I would definitly go hunter. A BM hunter is probably doing 80% of their optimal dps with nothing but serpent sting and autoshot. The warrior will have much higher dps than normal and take no damage with the pet tanking too. Plus the warrior's battleshout is a great buff for the hunter.
---
Paladin. OP Verigan's fist until mid 30s then Bonebiter.
---
I think the point of their Westfall lightpost anecdote from the Blizzcon panel was to assure us that minor flavor things like this are within the scope of recreating the game, and will  be fixed in time. 
---
I think I would actually want more mid-late game solo/quest content added. Finish some of those painfully incomplete zones, like Azshara and Deadwind Pass (unsure on this one - I kinda like having some places that actually just feel empty). Fill out all those dead zones on the map, like Hyjal, Gilneas, Quel'Thalas... I can't really remember all the others, but I'd certainly appreciate the ability to explore the entire world map.
---
anybody?? :\[
---
Removed rule 3. 
---
If you’re dual boxing anyways why not just do a healer with the warrior? Warriors can farm pretty well.
---
Sharding past the first week will put the game in the grave obviously, but I'd prefer loot trading in a heartbeat over bought loot tables, non existent GM services and 80% of your server existing in a different timezone like the shit private servers we all play on today.
---
These mods lol
---
I meant farm at 60
---
I dont remember that much detail. I remember choosing a druid because the ability to shapeshifting was something I never played before and thought it would be awesome (it was). At level 8 or 9 I tried to fight a level 60 mage who was attacking Darnasses. I think I had him om the ropes but he got me. 
---
Then my next embarrassing moment (never played a mmo or anything of the like) I grouped with a guy who kept talking about tanking. I responded with "Like a tank? Like an army tank? Thats gotta be a cheat code".
---
 He did not group with me after that.
---
Oof... to be honest, my FIRST experience was not great.    
---
   
---
It was the Summer of 2005. I was living with 2 roommates and we all had recently gotten REALLY into City of Heroes. We were obsessed with that game, but we only had one account to share between the three of us. So, we played in shifts... which actually worked out well due to our work schedules.    
---
On July 4th we all had off work, but still only one of us could play. On a whim, we downloaded a WoW trial at the recommendation of some friends.   
---
I was a big D&amp;D fan, so I was the most enthusiastic about trying WoW.    
---
My first character was a Dwarf Paladin. In Baldur’s Gate, my favorite character was a Dwarf Fighter/Cleric... and the WoW Paladin seemed like a close fit. 
---
  
---
I zoned in... and absolutely HATED it. :(   
---
Compared to CoH it felt like I was playing under water. I could not stand the gameplay, at all. Beyond that I was just very ignorant and didn’t have any clue as to what I was doing. I was overwhelmed and not enjoying it. 
---
So my FIRST experience with WoW was bad and lasted a day, before I was back to CoH.  
---
It wasn’t until years later, in 2009, that I reunited with WoW. This time it was for good, and I have ridden the ups and downs since then. I have played most classes... but my Main is my Tauren Druid. I can’t wait to experience his... ROOTS!... in Classic, this Summer!

Played Warcraft 3 for a couple years, then a friend from that game told me to try WoW.
---
June 11, 2005. I made a paladin. I was 12, I wanted to avenge the Silver Hand and kill Arthas. Found out he wasn't in the game so I made a warrior. Didn't hit 60 until May 2006.
---
Yes, 11 months. 
---
Also, my talents were mostly evenly distributed amongst the three trees. 
---
I was so awful T_T
---
Need to farm microtransaction resistance gear to take these guys, otherwise they can one shot you and you have to pay a dollar to rez.
---
&gt; For speed leveling though either skip it or dry run on a private server.
---
Well, on private servers I've gotten my 1-60 time down to ~120 hours (as a paladin) without any / minimal grouping - trying to figure out where I might be able to save a few hours along the way if dungeons have better gear or dense XP quests.
---
I had a post like this awhile ago and someone on there commented that IF they do more content they could do their original idea for it. 
---
Like Kara, CoT, others im forgetting. Plus all the unfinished zones like Hyjal. I think I would want new content over TBC.
---
But if they went TBC Id want them to redo it which would take alot of work. Like no flying mounts. But I did love the Wpvp zones in TBC. 
---
I know just needed to be sure. I will be levelling whit a warrior friend, so I'm really interested in your numbers will they differ if you have fast groups? Thinking a tank and healer will have it easy to get 3 dps for groups. And will loose some exp/h while grinding sins we are 2 ppl
---
I know. Why not do a healer and be more efficient. 
---
I was grateful for it.  But I bragged about how I knew it all already!
---
When talking to people about why I liked original WoW more than what it (and most other modern MMOs) has become, that quest line is usually what I bring up to point out the difference between the two games.
---
Subreddits can only have 2 posts pinned at a time.
---
There was a [sharding megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9tuwwg/demo_sharding_megathread/) in the past. You're about 2 months late to the party.
---
Oh...well then...I just created another sharding post. 
---
Oh god... what have I become!!
---
Original Scholo/Strath.
---
That shit was hard and time consuming as all hell.
---
Problem with dual boxing with a hunter follower is that the hunter will be 90% useless.
---
Main warrior gets into melee range to fight, hunter is in dead zone. Cannot do ranged damage - yet too far away to do any melee. So it's like 1 serpent sting and pet autoattack only. Useless.
---
Problem is no one trusts blizzard to get it right.
---
The problem is nobody trusts blizzard 
---
Bring in a couple of zones from TBC and make them raid level zones.  Raise the level cap by 2 points but XP can only come from those zones.
---
User name checks out.
---
I think for me it was the frost equivalent of Fiery, and this was probably late BC, but yes. 
---
Definitely know those feels.
---
True, but no one trusts blizzard to get it right.
---
Did you read anything I posted? Content will already be heavily nerfed from the start, which would almost warrant a tuning change. What I am trying to ask is to look at it removing the idea of boss numbers and look at it game play wise and ask the question was it fun and or would it make classic not fun? 
---
Your statement is what I tried to prevent when I went into more detail in my post, but I guess people will always make silly arguments without reading like yours.
---
I miss kiting that big cow blood hoof, then they patched it and took away my easy gold and honor. :(
---
Aoe tanking + priest holy nova is OP
---
In my post I tried to get people to look at it removing the idea of boss health from the argument. Boss health can always be changed, what I am trying to get at is if it was changed would it really make vanilla less fun or could it possibly make vanilla more fun? 
---
Content will only be nerfed because people are older and the game knowledge is far more extensive - as you stated. They will not be nerfed because of design changes (unless blizz allows more than 8 debuffs) 
---
I am one of those no changes people. I want absolutely no changes to patch 1.12. I want the game to launch in a near identical way to how it was in that patch. I don’t care if people are better at the game, I still don’t want more then 8 debuffs! 
---
Can't wait to play ret and steal plate gear from warriors, their tears will FUEL MY RIGHTEOUS CRUSADE!!
---
I was always jealous of Shamans cause their weapons could glow at such a low level lol
---
What I want people to do is remove the idea of boss healthpools when looking at the subject. Players are already going to be a doing way more damage than ever during vanilla. Number tuning can always be a thing, but what I want to know is the nostalgia of the debuff limit more important than technical changes, and would such a change instantly make vanilla not fun? I think there are many reasons why vanilla was fun and I went over them, but none of them have to do with a debuff limit. The picture is bigger than that. 
---
I am scratching my head here. I have heard of geared 60 priests AoE farming non-elites with Holy Nova spam, but what are you thinking levelling priests at 35 will AoE, and how?
---
The only thing I remember about my first log on was that I picked a blood elf (started in late TBC) because my boyfriend at the time was Horde, so I couldn't pick a night elf. Bummer city. I ended up having a blast running around the BE starting zone though. It was so pretty! Grass and trees everywhere. 
---
Then disaster struck. My boyfriend decided I wasn't leveling fast enough so he made an alt to level with me. His alt was a troll or an orc I can't remember.  Either way he decided to summon me to Org so we could do quests together. I didn't know what any of that meant at the time, just that I was supposed to click the portal when he made it.  I did it grudgingly, because I was enjoying questing on my own and getting wrecked every five minutes. I was reading all the quest text, which is probably why he was complaining I was going so slow. Anyways, we got to the city and he clearly expected me to be impressed. Look at all the spikes and so on. Well I took one look around and went "this is ugly as hell, everythings red and theres dirt everywhere I'm not playing this game."
---
He ended up rerolling as a Blood elf so I'd stop complaining and took every opportunity presented to die so he could laugh at his death animation.
---
Thanks pal! Who would have known you'd introduce me to a world at 15 and I'd still be absorbed in it over 10 years later.
---
Nobody trusts blizzard at all. Everyone is too paranoid.
---
Well true, -that- would actually be even more ideal so that they instead improve themselves for another time, but it would also be sad at the moment. :(
---
Lol.. kinda funny
---
If warrior charges in, the hunter will probably break follow due to range.
---
Or you could bind a key for only the hunter to backpeddle.
---
Or you could make the hunter the master and get close enough for the warrior to charge in
---
First when I say I am neither for or against what I mean is I don't care whatever way they choose to go with when classic comes out. What I am trying to look at is the flaw I see in the arguments for having  a specific debuff limit and how it seems to be more based on nostalgia than anything. 
---
It's not really a straw man when I am really only talking about the debuff limit in terms of being a fun factor of vanilla and the idea that it being there, separate from boss health and damage numbers, is more nostalgia based than any real meaningful reason. 
---
As for saying it could be applied to anything, and then going into the backpack, that't not true and what your doing right there is a straw man. A bit hypocritical now isn't it? The back pack issue wasn't a technical one like the debuff limit, and the 2 extra slots for the backpack come from having an authenticater. So not a really good example. As for your analogy about the recipe falls under that same line of logic. 
---
And around the 1.12 talents and around having DM gear. As if rebalancing is going to happen all should be included, that is why I wanted to try and look at the topic separate from boss health pulls and damage numbers, but more at the root of what it is. 
---
&gt; At level 40 you should be managing 20-30k xph easily within a single zone, 30 minute detour for 20 minutes of xp?
---
Just putting it out there, but unless you are literally poopsocking flights are a great time to hit the bathroom, put the kettle on, grab a snack and otherwise take care of yourself.
---
Unless you are competing for server first 60 seriously, I don't think anything of value is lost if you take an extra ten or fifteen minutes of flight/break time in exchange for easy xp or weapon upgrades.
---
Yeah, definitely. It wouldn’t be easy by any stretch of the imagination but it would be a god idea to balance the whole game around the changes they have already decided to make. 
---
Ritalin
---
&gt; Ashkhandi as 1hand? What's this heresy?!
---
Obviously she's a fury warrior from wotlk.
---
Appreciate it! Stay tuned for more, and reach out to us if there’s another you think we should add. 
---
Awe, you didn't read my post or understand that I wanted people to look at it separate from damage numbers or boss health pools. That's why I brought up the other sources that we already know that will make content trivial, but I guess you cant expect much when people only read the title and then just respond on emotion and a stuck mindset of no changes ever even when we already know there are going to be a ton of changes.
---
I filled out the first one I found on google, I was hoping it would say mage or shaman, or maybe Druid. 
---
Monk. 
---
Fucking monk lol. 
---
God damn it google. 
---
&gt;  Simply that if you strut around in T2 or T3, or even a level 60 on a warhorse, the other players will look at you with awe.
---
New ones, maybe. Trust me brother on L.H. it didn't mean much. 
---
Raids aren't hard, you just need a bunch of people. The mechanics themselves are easy. Full T2 doesn't mean much.
---
Full T3 will probably be very rare tho.
---
I remember people advertising in trade ‘WTS orange glow to weapon pst’
---
We already know its starting with 16 debuffs and with DM, don't we? And content is already early content will already be nerfed from its original state by having a 1.12 client. So with so much already being changed and made easier, I don't see how a no changes mindset really works, as a no changes from what exactly, the private servers people have been playing on? Additionaly the question I ask is would the debuff limit at any amount make the game instantly not fun? It's definitely not in the top lists that people give for what made vanilla fun that I have heard.
---
Probably going to play Ret Pally, will try out Holy but healing has never been my thing, and I've played Ret for so long so I want to play that, even if it's "sub optimal". What are the best professions and such to pursue? I know the Holy Reckoning spec was popular but how did "Ret Paladins" build back in the day?
---
I remember whispering somebody who ran past me how he got the red glow on his sword, and later on when an enchanter was selling the enchant for 25 silver in Barrens trade chat,  I jumped at the chance to get it on my Hunter.
---
Getting beastslayer was part of the Vanilla experience 
---
I came over from CoH as well and recall the “underwater” feeling.  Fortunately I rolled Troll. And u know the rest. 
---
It truly was a staple of it. 
---
Yep, on one hand we have those looking for pure nostalgia that want no changes at all, and the other the overall health of the game in its entirety. Vanilla was fun for many reasons, but debuff limits and such were not those reasons, and them being there or not wont make vanilla instantly not fun. I just think that the argument for a debuff limit, when removing boss health pools and damage numbers, is one based solely on nostalgia. 
---
I understand your post, but what youre asking for is essentially a rework for all bosses, this has a trickle down effect that affects class balance among many other things including items, the effectiveness of potions/buffs. I understand what you're trying to say, but your ideas aren't very well thought out and would never be implemented into the game.
---
Glad to know I'll be in high demand when classic drops. Look me up, I'll be a tank, and I'll have the same name. 
---
What I am asking though is that more of a nostalgia component? Looking back with years of knowledge we can say what dps specs were viable and such, but at the time not everyone always know exactly to the extent that we know today. Is having that specific dps meta more or less fun then having a different meta? Would it instantly make the game unenjoyable for everyone, or were their deeper reasons as to why people enjoyed playing vanilla so much?
---
I'm trying to have people look at it independently from DPS numbers and boss healthpools, but that seems to be where everyone constantly gets stuck on even though I thought I addressed it in my original post.  
---
I was incredibly stingy (which made me very wealthy in vanilla, eventually), so no. Not until I had to get crusader for raiding
---
You could “dual box” without sending inputs to both programs (I did dungeons as a protadin + holy priest when my RAF partner got lazy and I needed the boost levels for a monk at MoP launch) and just switch between windows.
---
Send the Warrior in, pool rage while using a few Hunter spells, switch to warrior while hunter auto shots (or just let hunter afk auto shot for extra ease)

Also not all mages are good at aoe'ing or 100% confident. Many are usually near death or mis-timed it and dies. Sure Mage/Mage works but so does Mage/Heal.
---
Holy Nova doesn't do any justifiable aoe damage.
---
Lastly - world pvp - it's nice having a priest around too and one who is also shadow spec
---
And using the scrolls glitch to give your hands a permanent glowing effect.
---
Yeah I did that too lol and then he wanted to talk to me over Skype and I had to do my best girl voice and then he started asking for pics and I was already in too deep at this point so I started taking estrogen and testosterone blockers and growing out my hair lolol and then he commented on how plain I looked one time and I noticed he wasn’t bringing me with him on raids as much so I had to get super good at makeup and get a boob job and then he was into me again and he helped me farm BRD.
---
Soon he wanted to meet me irl so I had to start waist training, counting calories to atrophe my upper body muscle, while stretching and doing leg and butt exercises to maintain my lower body and get a more female posture and flexibility. He liked me in person and eventually he said he’d carry me through MC if I sucked his dick, which is like... seriously? That’s all I have to do lololol what a dumbass. Got em coach. 
---
So he carries me through MC and he’s spending gold on me left and right, right? And then he asks me to meet his parents and tells me he can get me into AQ40 after and im like “Oh shit”. I’m really gonna have to go all out for this one. 
---
So I get a vaginoplasty right, and this stupid fuck brings me to his parents and I make a good impression like a boss, and they can’t wait for him and I to give them grandkids (got em coach).
---
So he carries me through and I get free gear again! A few months later he says he wants to do Naxx but he would be honored to have me as his wife through it. 
---
This guy is so silly dude lol like what? Get your priorities straight kid lol seriously. Naxx gear for marriage!? What a steal. 
---
So I’m walking down the aisle knowing I got the Naxx gear and he reads his vows and they’re okay but like a little noobish and simple. My vows were sick and everyone was super impressed. 
---
So now I get to be married to this dumbass and get fucked on the daily for free upgrades and alt runs and gold and everything! It’s been 15 years and he still doesn’t know! What a tool XD
---
I've tried. Dual / Triple boxed since vanilla through the current garbage. Hunters are difficult. Warlocks / Priests are the best.
---
Can we just make it unique to need BoP if you own it. Greed only or DE. Problem solved?
---
Because there are 12k peaks on one realm? And why do you say "Sharding is litterly ONLY for a very short amount of time in the starting zones only," when Blizzard never said "starting zones" and never said "only" about sharding, they used the word "especially" in the "early zones".
---
You're assuming that there's no other times during this playthough where we'd be flying, autorunning, etc.
---
30 minutes of flights every 2 hours is plenty already, why waste more and make 60 minutes every 2 hours when I've already pooped and kettled some tea?
---
I remember getting minor beastslayer knowing full well it wasn't very good and purely cause it looked cool.
---
And then I saw someone with +15 agi and crusader.
---
Id like to know this too. It was a big server. Lots of people. Cant really know everybody. With a name like SkeletonJack I would assume Horde (unless you were a purple haird NElf dude). 
---
I was an "effective healing," chart topping, paladin full T2 (the one with a mageblade!). Also a huge fan of UBRS/AQ20 PUGS. would have loved to play with you bro. I could do dungeons all day long. Hope to see you there in the future.
---
&lt;Happy Time Harry's Heros&gt;
---
I'm not saying they should be implemented, what I am saying is that thinking there needs a specific number of debuffs on a boss, 8, 16, 40, unlimited, or whatever, to make the game fun is an argument based on nostalgia, and wouldn't by itself instantly make the vanilla not a fun game to play. You really don't understand my post at all. Lets not even go into class balance, as nothing about classes in vanilla were balanced to begin with.
---
If you're leveling in westfall then it's potentially worth it, yeah. If in darkshore I wouldn't bother. Well, it sounds obvious when I phrase it like that, but I usually level in darkshore.
---
Yeah I must admit I’ve only boxed on retail with groups of all the same class which certainly makes it easy haha. I guess hunter just needs some ubermicro!
---
One of the many many reasons I’m looking forward to Classic too
---
What about a mage/hunter combo, with the hunter leading?
---
Telling raid healers to not heal certain raid members is quite difficult.
---
Plus rank 1 chain heal sees all as equal.
---
I feel like if I got invited to a group and 4 of them were in the same guild. I'm on my fucking own. Understand?
---
Good! Boar with charge gets good aggro that the mage can't pull. It's just a hunter with extra firepower.
---
r/classicwow is no place for your damned optimism!
---
Why do people care so much about how others want to level...
---
This is cringe as fuck.
---
Bravo sir.  Fine work 
---
Why would you say 20:80 and not just 1:4?
---
Have you thought about recruiting a leveling group? A dedicated 5 man with you healing ,warrior , warlock, mage, rogue will surely nuke through dungeons quicker, especially fully geared from running all those dungeons? 
---
Lock will mean people can take breaks to repair or bank items for gold at later levels, group breaks can be taken when travelling to the next dungeon farm.
---
No competition, travel time can be planned, no need to wait for spawns or bad drop rates.
---
All depends on how good a group you can build of skilled players. 
---
I really dont understand the focus on cosmetic, non-gameplay changing details such as this one. I mean yeah, you like it, there will be an add on within a week that gives you that font if you want it.
---
This kind of thing always strikes me as a nostalgia sort of concern, not a gameplay one, and I'm always hyper focused on the latter.
---
Downvote away
---
The 16-debuff limit was a stupid technical limitation and was lampooned even back then.  Ideally it shouldn't exist.  God forbid people get to actually play their class in a raid, not to mention the limit can almost be hit in even a dungeon party and of course it's restrictive in UBRS.
---
I don't think uncapping would even make things overwhelmingly easier, at least for back then.  It could be silly now with all the Warrior stacking that'll happen, but outside of that, I suppose it would be enough that some kind of rebalancing would need to be done because technically the devs did have to design around their own limitation.  I don't even care if it's very accurate rebalancing.
---
The problem is that to even get it close to right, you'd probably still need to do extensive mathemetical work and testing, and that kind of work is definitely not going to be done on Classic ever as they're just doing this for fun and have always wanted to spend as little resources on it as possible.  Hell, the reason they didn't do Classic before is because it'd cost too much resources and only now do they feel like it'll barely be worth it.
---
Yeah I noticed this too about the demo. Also the numbers in Vanilla were a fixed text size while the demo had them shrink if the mob was at a ranged distance.
---
I'm sure this will be corrected, if not I'll find an addon that gives me what I want.
---
I remember getting a guide with my copy of the battle chest (up to wrath) and it still talked about taurens having plainsrunning, an ability that never even went live lol. I still enjoyed reading the guides though even if they were terrible.
---
Spends the first half of the list shitting on zones for being empty and useless then gives props to Feralas and Silithus for being empty and useless. pcgamer is a joke these days.
---
I'd love to, but it'd be hell to find a group that will keep the same schedule. Leveling like this means 20-35 is an hour a level so it's easy to fall behind and the group falls apart once the gap hits 5-6 levels.
---
But if it happens organically, no reason not to. Another reason why I want this data. If I know SM Cath gives 15,000xp per run, and I end up with a group, or meet people along the way that might make a good group, let's chain run it if it's better than questing outside.
---
Won't know if its worth it unless we have the data.
---
People cried about the same shit when osrs was coming out. Guess what? It overtook RS3 in popularity and it’s still going strong. It has the same membership package it did back in the day. In fact, the cost is even higher today. 
---
So yeah, I am okay with supporting a game that I know is great. Maybe Blizzard can invest in some fresh Classic content (dungeons and raids) later on.
---
lol even 15 is easy if you have enough gear
---
How is Dun Morogh not in the top 10?
---
Legion = fuck not this legendary!!!! 
---
Bfa = azerite lol
---
You have 6 months to recruit a group - see who is dedicated by planning a testing schedule on a private server. Lay out the leveling times, keep those that show up for practice, dump those that don't.
---
Keep your questing guide as option two and if the group breaks continue with that.
---
If you can build a dedicated leveling group ready from day 1 I think that would be the fastest, but all need to be along for the ride to 60, skilled, optimised for their role and willing to practice on private servers to find optimal routes and times in dungeons.
---
You're saying I don't understand your argument in an attempt to make your stupid idea sound valid. It's not a good idea. It's inconsistent and messes with current balance, not overall balance. Two very different things.
---
It's true. Shamans have a busted level-to-glow ratio.
---
Is this true? I've never played with loot trading so I don't know
---
You wait and pick later. This solve you problem but makes a new one. Now you are left behind for sure cause you got no toons leveled.
---
Just pick a big dick name and roll on that one. It's better then having zero.
---
Itz naught a tumah.
---
ty swifty
---
I know. That is why I wanted to look at the math. 
---
Lol
---
As remake and rerelease happy as most developers are these days, I have a hard time believing that they will release new content for classic.  I really hope that they do add new content to classic without raising the level cap or adding in mechanics from later expansions (no lfg, no dual spec, no raid tokens, no multiple raid difficulties, etc.)
---
They day they announce TBC in any way is the day I unsub and quit forever.
---
No, on a nostalgic level the debuff limit is pointless. It's the changes that come with removing it that make a difference in gameplay that blizzard will end up getting wrong.
---
It's not just damage numbers being different it's suddenly different specs are now doing more or less damage relative to what people know, a whole different meta - Multi dot classes on cleave fights for example would be king like on live today. PvP and World bosses would also need tuning, it just changes too much to keep it even close to how it was. 
---
Hey guys, I remember seeing a lot of you.  Anyone from Questionable Methodz or DaKine?  I was Tut, the Tauren druid.
---
I love your videos! Keep up the great work!
---
No. Activision is taking over. Blizzard employees are getting fired. 
---
I don't want Activision to add anything to a Blizzard original. 
---
Fun take. I honestly think all the starter zones are top 15 at least for me! I’d say
---
1. Tirisfal Glades
---
2. Teldrassil
---
3. Dun Morogh
---
4. Mulgore 
---
5. Elwynn Forest
---
6. Durotar
---
Next level Zones
---
1. Silverpine Forest
---
2. Loch Modan 
---
3. Barrens
---
4. Westfall
---
5. Darkshore
---
It gets too complicated after that haha
---
Yeah that was odd
---
desolace in the top half of zones. Not sure about that
---
Yeah I chill now and 1 month before release I go nuts. Lol
---
Horde should still be in the minority? 
---
it is actually very easy, since you can loot boxes through the wall :) you dont even need to enter the ship
---
You could also call it Bethesda, ubisoft and ea monster.
---
TBC is the reason I quit, exactly as mentioned above, because I felt all my effort would become worthless overnight. I would be more than open to additional content within the existing world, including new zones, professions, pets, mounts, endgame, etc etc. Just don't water down the original game with cross-server bullshit, instant everything, effortless/mindless questing and all the rest of it.
---
The main beauty of vanilla is the challenging aspect that keeps you engaged.
---
Isn't Nightfall released at the same time as BWL? In that case, he should go Arcanite Reaper, right?
---
I mained a mage for most of vanilla, then warlock into tbc.
---
I had minor beastslayer on pretty much every weapon I ever had.
---
it's the remake asscandy and the wotlk QS remake :( nice idea tho
---
I always liked having a priest and warrior to heal and tank if I wasn't, but that's a given. I love having windfury, but I hated it over riding my poisons on my rogue, though I'd still rather hit twice with my weapon in most cases. Druid mark was great and druids themselves were just good "Oh Shiiii-" buttons to have even if they weren't that strong on their own. If I were to pick a duo leveling partner I'd pick mage for all of the cupcakes. 
---
To me it's always Ron Howard, Arrested Development style.
---
Up until AQ, mages simply have better damage output. At AQ it gets a lot closer between them, but mages also get better threat reduction from talents. Warlocks obvioisly bring crucial CC and utility but even though it might sound harsh, mages are objectively a better dps class than warlocks for the majority of the content, even if it's just by a tiny bit, meaning that it makes sense to bring more of them into the raid.
---
but you get to be a cat so its already a win
---
It's naive to think Activision-Blizzard wont go after private servers like never before when it's an active IP again.         
---
Whether it's take-down notices, lawsuits or under the table ddos-attacks, private servers probably wont last long after Classic launches.
---
If you are looking for a dungeon (i suppose so) then druid tank is much better for a dungeon run, followed by paladin (especially for strat and scolo) and lastly warrior. Warrior was the only choice in raids, for dungeons he was not the top tank...
---
Very server dependant
---
Did you not play WoW at any point between WotLK and MoP? Loot trading was rampant lmao.
---
There are toxic people in every single community. Just liking something and talking to people doesn't prevent someone from being a horrible person. It's up to the community to take care of its bad members, and that's why there exists police and moderators.
---
Pretty damn sure durotar has like 10x more scorpions. Stopped reading.
---
IIRC only one streamer is going on a pvp server. Couldnt tell you which one though. There's also the fact that they'll be surrounded by an army of fans wherever they go so they're not soft targets by any means
---
~~I remember their podcast crew did a very honest review of ME:Andremeda while much of the gaming media were pretending it was a good game/scoring political capital with EA. I gained enough respect for that trio of dudes that I'll give PC Gamer a few misses before I agree that they're a joke.~~ 
---
Their actual published review is an 80/100. Nevermind. I guess it's just those few dudes doing the podcast who are making sense and not their writers? 
---
I remember ignoring the stats and trying to decide which colour I preferred the most..Ahaha what a noob xD
---
#waitingforclassic
---
As a hunter, mage.
---
It's not just free food/drink, but also that we never have to compete for gear, AND they provide the aoe damage that hunters can't!
---
I hope so.
---
2.5 is The only true tank set &lt;3
---
Crown of the Earth -&gt; Cave Mushrooms -&gt; Ranae's Cleansing. It's not all strictly the same chain, but going through those gives you the full NE lore experience, and the best raid item to boot!
---
....and vice-versa.  It cannot be understated how attractive it is as someone who plays retail and not private servers.
---
I long for the days of vanilla, but not just that... I long for the day where I can play vanilla without worrying about a server reset or TBC looming on the horizon.  I make time for about 10-12 hours a week of gaming these days, Vanilla could easily have me entertained for a decade as long as they don't increase the level cap or add more raids.
---
I’m actually considering the same thing since I’d like to main a warrior and farm a hunter. Only since the boxing combo might be tricky, I might do it with a priest. Only then I’d have a max level priest which I don’t really care about :/
---
Oh yeah, with a good group, most 11+ can be cleared, but this is not my point. The hardest content on classic is really not comparable to anything M+ can throw at you. I just find it funny when people say that vanilla needed CC and BFA doesn't need it. I'm not even going to comment about the down votes. 
---
No warriors were the best tanks for everything at appropriate gear levels.  Could druid or pally in Naxx epics aoe tank a dungeon better than a warrior, sure, but at that point it doesn't matter anyways.
---
I've also mained a rogue since vanilla and I long for the days of old.  I was combat fists from BWL to HFC and goddamn was I dirty when they changed combat to "outlaw" and i couldn't xmog the artifact to fist weapons.  Occasionally I used swords (SSC) and smetimes a dagger offhand (NAX2.0) but I when most other rogues did it from behind, all I wanted was a good fist.
---
Dire Maul might be released later on, keep that in mind.
---
&gt;my love for Classic is strictly "rOsE tInTeD gLaSsEs", and that Classic will be dead within a few months.
---
&gt;It won't last beyond a month or two, but I'm betting on it. Quote me.
---
You're a retard.
---
I agree
---
I am. Thanks 
---
I always enjoy getting good leveling gear when I can through dungeons/quests.
---
Is it slower than grinding/questing...probably. But if your a melee dps than it might be worth the time to go grab them sick weapons s. Then again this is coming from someone who usually levels both professions to 300 including fishing and first aid before I hit 60 XD
---
In Germany there was this tv show, Giga Games, that showed and reviewd games. I already heard of WoW, was a fan of WC3, and really looking forward to get my hands on WoW. I heard that Giga Games will be showing WoW Beta, so my brother and I watched the show and it was so mindblowing. How friggin huge and immersive the gameworld was, it really felt like you will be one character in the world of the warcraft games. Today every game has this huge open world like AC:O or RDR2, but back then most games had every limited level sizes and even MMOs split up every area with loading screen. After only a few minutes it was clear that this will be the next big thing for my brother and me. 
---
I don't know how we got Beta keys for WoW, but we had the chance to play a few months of the beta before the game launched in Europe. Knowing we want to play Horde we created Alliance characters in Beta to not spoil outself. I created a nightelf hunter and my brother a nightelf rogue. We had such an amazing time, everything was completely new to us. We even spend some gold on armor/weapons from NPCs not knowing that it's not worth the money. We just put talent points where we thought if sounded usefull. We encountered a lot of areas we knew from WC3. And we enjoyed the end of Beta event where demons and other creatures attacked the world. 
---
And if we not played the Beta, I often logged in to go to the character creation screen to find out how I want my Tauren druid in the final game to look like. 
---
This is really stretching my memory "and showing my age", but I was still heavy into Diablo II LOD when I downloaded WoW and played the open beta a couple weeks before retail dropped.  At this time I had a Gateway desktop my dad had updated out of.  I believe it was originally a slot 1 Pentium II 450mhz cpu.  I know I had upgraded the ram, AGP video card and added a SoundBlaster Live! PCI card. (this was back when something as simple as disabling onboard sound could add 10% FPS).  It was ok, but I couldn't turn everything up to max.  I remember buying a used Slot 1 P3 (1ghz) CPU off ebay that was pulled from a server as well.  Anyway, by 05, I had started building a PC specifically for WoW.  To put this into perspective, I was making 8-9 dollars an hour and my only owned assets were a 1995 S10 I'd paid $2500 for and a 2003 Kawasaki Ninja I'd paid $2300 for.  I was lucky if I could buy 1 component every 2 weeks.  Not to go full on nerd here, but I did a ton of research and I had the time to plan this right since I didn't immediately have the cash.  I built my WoW box based on an AMD Athlon 64 that I believe stock clocked at 2.4Ghz.  I took some chances on some "new" technologies, (like buying a MoBo without an AGP slot assuming the future was PCI-E).  In the end, I was the only guy I knew with a 64-bit pc.  To be fair though, I didn't have a 64-bit OS (WIN XP64 was in beta).   I had a dual 2.0Ghz Mac G5 at work that was 64-bit, but even with 1.5 gig of PC3200 and an ATI Radeon 9600 XT 128mb card it didn't run WoW like my PC.
---
Anyway, it took maybe a year to build/buy but this was my baby back then. https://imgur.com/a/IEUVrud 
---
If anything this WoW pc made my a prick, if someone in my guild claimed "lag" for a mistake my response was "tough shit, get a new computer."  not my proudest moments in hindsight.
---
Anyway, the part that makes me stupid is that after the initial build I stopped researching anything.  I'd keep upgrading this initial build, new MoBo's, faster CPU's, more ram, better vid cards, but always the same XP pro OS.  It wasn't until Watchdogs dropped in 2014 that I was forced to look at my OS.  Watchdogs wouldn't run on XP.  Only then did I realize that the 32-bit OS is limited to 4Gb total in all mapped memory devices, so as my video cards were getting closer to 1GB, it was just seeing less system memory.  Opps.  I bought Win 7 Pro at that point, but Watchdogs sucked.  Still waiting on Classic WoW!
---
Anyway, I know nobody will read this, but typing it and the trip down memory lane was fun.  
---
Now to make myself seem dumb again.  
---
Honestly the costing blizz more money and resources sor far has been the only really legitimate argument made outside of nostalgia ones for a debuff limit, assuming that if they made it unlimited the were to rebalance eveything. The only thing I really see against it but it's not really strong is that they have to artificially add the limit as they are going from the current client. It is most likely more work to rebalance, but we don't know how much work either will take exactly.
---
No matter how many debuffs you can have on a boss I'll still be enjoying the game. And they did decide to add loot sharing to save costs as well, so I don't actually expect them no go unlimited. 
---
I don't remember the first time I saw someone in T3, but I vividly remember the player-god I first saw wearing 2/8 T1.
---
I remember I kited Hogger all the way to the Burning Steppes. When I came back I saw like 20 people waiting for him to respawn.
---
Settle down staysafe.. 
---
Potato bake and coffee works for 30+ hour marathons, take some time to stretch during down times. But i guess if you want to take adderall wait till about the 20 hour mark and make sure you stay hydrated. 
---
It’s funny when people suggest doxaine who the fuck even wants to play games while snorting coke ive tried just can’t do it 
---
Obviously you've never watched a TipsOut guide...
---
Someone scared of STVietnam? Gotta get ahead so the others don't get you. 
---
That last one made me literally lol.
---
Add things like Kara, but only with gear mostly on par with naxx. L60 stays max.
---
What will happen if You ding 60 a day later?
---
this is just too long ago. to be honest, i dont remember many real quest lines. i just remember some rogue quest in a castle near tarrens mill, that had a really great feel.
---
If you are interested in the actual fastest leveling method, I believe done in 85h, you should look into 5m aoe dungeon grinding using 2hellfire warlocks permastunning at lvl 36. Fully geared and loaded with cash by the time you are 60,
---
^ Loyalty is grounded- blind faith is not.
---
And if you've got blind faith in Blizzard in 2019... yikes.
---
so who are the "big bad" enemies in modern WoW now that all the main ones have been killed?
---
I would prefer TBC. That said, content I think could be cool would be a 20 man raid that ties in between Stratholme and Naxxramas, essentially Naxx20 in the same way AQ had a smaller complementary raid.
---
fuck that burns
---
It was always fun to find a different gray shoulder on an alt. I normally ended up with something with [this model](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10657/talbar-mantle), so I'll never forget that one tauren shaman alt I made that found a [Brocade shoulder](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1777/brocade-shoulderpads), [Talon of Vultros](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4454/talon-of-vultros), and a [Hulking Shield](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15891/hulking-shield) for good measure.
---
I wish I still had that character.
---
At retail launch I stocked up on Red Bull, can't remember how long I played for but when I went to bed my heart was pounding.
---
Woke up and couldn't login to Archimonde, the server was fucked.  My guild ended up re-rolling several days later on Laughing Skull
---
There is nothing to stance dance for early on, the crit and enrage effects are much more dps than imp rend and deep wounds as you'll likely have no crit. Piercing howl also great for living through bad pulls or slowing hamstring immune mobs, such as elementals or mechs, the difference isn't huge though so whatever floats your boat
---
Are you looking for any suggestions in the meantime?
---
You're not wrong but honestly, that is power user talk. Blizzard has mentioned before that it's very important to them that everything feels just like vanilla (seeing is believing, though), and it does make sense that even purely client-side visuals should match.
---
The thing is, that there will be people logging on who haven't done so for ages, or who come from private servers expecting it to look the same. Not all of those people will be interested in downloading addons just to 'fix' their experience, and it certainly isn't kind to the users either. You can easily scare off people just because it looks or feels wrong initially.
---
So really, the question should be, is there a benefit to the new style of damage numbers? If there isn't, then there is no justifiable reason not to do everything you can to ensure that first time logins feel right at home.
---
For sure! Retcon wow with a better timeline and pave the way for wc4
---
You cannot remove the idea of health pools if talk about debuff slot. One effects the other.
---
Me on Level ~20 on my first hunter dualwielding 2 random sword for Level 12 or something (not even sure if they actually had hunter stats or I just used them because sword): "Dad I want red glow on my weapons, it Looks awesome!!!"
---
My Dad, 60 hunter in raid guild with golds and stuff (no professional but he was doing fine, nearly had 100% Mount then for both him and his girlfriend): "You dont Need that enchant, save your Gold for important items and your Mount at 40"
---
Me on lvl 43: "Dad can you give me Gold for my Mount? I dont have any (literally NO Gold, like 50 silver I had), but look my swords they glow in shiny red!!!" ... still wearing that 2 swords for lvl 12ish.
---
Still best time of my life!
---
Started in the us open beta. Created a hunter planning to be a melee hunter... never made it to level 10 and rolled a priest after launch. It took me half a year to realize you choose spirit tab over blackout while leveling...
---
You cannot remove the idea of health pools if talk about debuff slot. One effects the other. Also having a debuff lemit adds a certain degree of difficulty, ooh you used serpent sting. Well now we have to redot or wait untill it runs out...
---
when i started with 3 friends back in the day, we didnt knew shit. we didnt knew what a tank is and we also played dungeons with us 4 instead of 5 players. i was wl and "tanked" with my voidwalker. those where the days!
---
Yeah I remember seeing people with the red glowing weapons or sometimes a blue one if they had the Icy Chill enchant. I think my first big "goal" was to figure out how I can make my weapons look like that.
---
Another thing that impressed me on my first character (it was an Undead Rogue) was that I had made a friend in the game who also played the same race + class combination and they were a bit more familiar with the game and higher level than me.
---
I can't remember the exact level but I think they were somewhere in the high 20's while I was probably around 14 or something and they had this white mask on.
---
Obviously I didn't have any shoulder or head slot items at that level yet and I thought it was the coolest looking armor I had seen in the game so I asked them how did they get a hold of it because I wanted one for myself.
---
They told me something about some mobs in Silverpine Forest but I don't think I ever figured out how to get that mask. I think it might have been just a random world drop from the humanoids in Ambermill, or from the elite worgen near SFK.
---
I remember though sneaking into Westfall to farm the level 15 Red Defias Mask as a low level Horde player. I'm pretty sure if you played a Rogue it was mandatory to have that mask at low level even though it was a grey item with zero stats on it, just because no one had access to head slot items at that level which made it extra cool looking.
---
You cannot look at it independently because one effects the other. Adding unlimited debuff would give other "un-meta" specs a chance at glory perhaps. But that is not what vanilla is and classic should be. There is still alot of things to theorycraft about, even in vanilla with all the knowledge we have. But changing the debuff limit would change alot of core gameplay elements that was not in vanilla.
---
To give en answer to your question, it would change the joy I'll get out of vanilla.
---
One requires me to count the zeros in order to properly read how big it is. 
---
The very first time I played wasn't that much interesting to be honest. I was invited into the WoW European beta, must have been end of 2004 I believe? But at the time I was quite a workaholic and didn't find the time to really get into WoW. I believe I played a bit until I reached level 7 or 8 or so as a Night Elf druid, but didn't find much time to continue playing.
---
As long as there will always be a PERMANENT server option for Classic only. Simply because while I would LOVE a new path for Classic, (because TBC for me had more negatives than positives for the game), the risk of messing it up is sky high.
---
If they are messing it up, I want at least to have the option to play Classic only anytime I want. If they are going TBC, again, I want the option to play Classic only anytime I want.
---
It is possible to create new content, it is possible to have Classic-like expansions...but without breaking ? It is going to be a miracle if they don't break it.
---
I really want them to add more content 2-3 years down the road...as long as they will always keep a Classic only server option.
---
Just find a raiding guild who raids weekends. More than enough time to do whatever during the week and show up weekends prepared !!
---
The first time I played WoW was at my aunties house with the character of my Cousin.
---
He was a lvl 8 tauren warrior. The quest I was supposed to do was to kill the razorfen pigmans west of razorhill (dont know how he got there but also didnt know that wasnt were taurens start, never knew about the game before).
---
So I walked up to the camp and saw multiple of them. About 10 minutes it took me to start attacking cause I went through skills, spellbook and character Screen to see what the best Thing to do is.
---
I decided to shoot his rifle. Back then you saw a red trail of the shot going to the enemy after you shot. That was AWESOME! When the mob reached me I kept using Thundeclap and Harmstring as it was the only abilites that dealt damage in my opinion. Especially thunderclap, my god slamming the ground like that has done TONS AMOUNT OF DAMAGE!!!.
---
After killing about 20 pigs my uncle told me I have to go to the next camp for the other pigs. "But I only Need 2 more bars for levelup, I can just do that here cant I?"
---
After getting levelup via that and moving to the next camp we had to go to sleep. Well that was my first hour of WoW, made me addict from the first hour, always went to aunties place in hope of being able to Play WoW.
---
I stopped playing that expansion because of it, played every other expansion from launch and haven’t experienced it as bad as wotlk 
---
As a warlock i liked having a priest around. Complementing shadow damage and shields would wreck stuff in pvp and pve alike
---
I can't speak for split runs, but my guild that never got past Vael often ran Onyxia with 30-ish players due to low turn-outs, so I can definitely see split runs having happened for stronger guilds in vanilla. 
---
I feel like split runs are going to be a lot more common in Classic, and it'll be interesting to see how quickly the average guild can get to that point, especially with the extra knowledge today.
---
but is it worth it to just grind DM repeatedly if you 5box the game?
---
In Terms of pve (dungeons only) ... I would say its
---
Paladin Prot/heal - prot aoe tank ftw and heal is strong, Pally in General is good due to buffs/auras/judgment
---
Mage - solid CC, free Food and water, good damage, NO PET, Portals ... every Group wants a mage.
---
Shaman - about every spec is kinda good in dungeons, the Support they give via totems is insane and having that wipe save (unless "ouh dont have ankh") is quite good as well
---
About pvp im not so sure, as Im pve Player in classic. Would think for sure Pally though (freedom topkek) and healers in General.
---
You wouldn't need as much sleep as you would think if you say someone stayed up 48 hours straight. Sure there would be side effects while being sleep deprived, but after a 8-9 hour sleep, they would wake up just fine. 
---
If you want to read more: 
---
https://www.quora.com/If-you-stayed-up-40-hours-how-much-sleep-would-you-need
---
Most of the side effects would be from the pills if taken too often. (Drugs are bad kids) 
---
It all depends on your faction and class. I plan on rushing to 60 as quickly as possible, but I have certain dungeons I plan on doing. 
---
lmao
---
Do you have any link to this ruling? I'd like to read it, but can't find it. 
---
&gt; Keftenk
---
Guy is literally a meme speccer..
---
There's no wide consensus on using meme specs for NF at all. None of the top private server guilds does it.
---
yep this.. i remember a bunch of guildies doing the last few steps well into raiding.. it was almost an endgame ish thing
---
Isn't this stuff you can control yourself though?
---
Agree with you on the tightly grouped party but in this scenario we are on the boat in DM so lot of chance that the whole group is packed.
---
260 is indeed better than 92 but not realistic since you want here to take aggro back on 3 mobs after one of your dps pulled so by the time you've generated enough rage to cast 3 SA or 2 SA + Taunt, someone might be dead or the heal oom. 
---
What you say work well in a scenario where the tank pull and dps hit the same mob but it's not the case in the op comment and we were discussing how he could have save his party from dying.
---
What is persistent spawning (like functionally) ? And how does sharding affect any ahead of the pack player? 
---
Reasons why:
---
1) Debuff limits promotes communication and being scarce with what debuffs are worth applying. Instead of just automatically using anything you want to.
---
2) This increases dps done by a ton and changes how you play the game. You would have to learn new ways of playing and rebalance content. Some say new ways of playing is a good thing, but a LOT of the people who want classic, just want things back exactly how they were. 
---
Except that the glancing blows, guesstimate hit/resist tables are made from the most reliable old posts and such, meaning that these posts must be inconsistent(if there's posts that state the opposite), and who knows what's the right value? 
---
I remember buying it from someone in Ironforge on my Night Elf Druid. I must have been level 30 or so at the time.
---
&gt;he reason why is because of how it can be abused. Pretend there's a 2-handed weapon you really want for your warrior while in a dungeon as you're leveling. The tank also wants it for himself since he doesn't tank normally while leveling. Your friends, a Paladin and Hunter, can also use the weapon but want to give it to you.
---
We're talking about classic.. If people ninja loot using this method there will be a public outcry on the server. And if it really becomes an issue then you can complain about it.
---
Right now you are just making up ways it can go work and then complaining about it.
---
We're not talking about bans, we're talking about blacklists.
---
Because people do not like sharding and don't have a problem with dynamic spawns.
---
It's that simple mate.. 
---
Remember when 4 shadow priests and I think a fury war 5man'd a naxx boss?
---
&gt;24~48hrs game sessions with 2~4hrs sleep should be enough, well.. Thats what professional speedrunners recommend.
---
Most speedrunners do more like 35hours sessions and then 4-6 hours sleep, into another similar session.
---
I did 36 hours on recent private server launch, then followed by 6 hour sleep and then "casually" played 16-18h a day for the rest.
---
Using drugs is a terribly fucking idea. Not only are you putting yourself at huge risks by mixing drug use with very unhealthy levels of gaming, but adderal might give you a boost at the start, but the wear out after it's over will cost you prolly the same amount of time.
---
I did just fine on food water and a bit of caffeine 
---
Deadmines can be a pain in the ass if your group is at the lower end of the level range (17-18) but on top of that if it's filled with newbies who don't know about the patrols and don't know to snare the mobs down when they're low health and start running away.
---
I recently started leveling a new Mage and I found out how much easier that whole dungeon is with at least 1 person who knows how to CC.
---
The hardest room in Deadmines is probably the Goblin Foundry room because all of the goblins there summon a mechanical robot add instantly when you pull them. They hit hard as a truck and can't be taunted, so if you pull 2 goblins you're probably going to end up fighting 4 mobs and people wipe in that room a lot.
---
The thing about having a Mage is though that the goblins need to cast for around 1-2 seconds to summon the robot adds and they usually start doing it right after you aggro one. You won't see any cast bar but you can see from their animation when they start doing it.
---
If you have a good Mage in the group, the Mage can wand the ranged mobs (Engineers) and wait for them to start the animation and then sheep them and it cancels the summon completely and they'll never summon the add again during that fight.
---
So if there's a pack of 2, you just sheep the melee goblin first and when the Engineer starts summoning the add right away you sheep him after which frees the melee mob but your first sheep already canceled his summon so he will just run up to the group and you can kill the mob.
---
After that you can just pull the Engineer back and he's not gonna start summoning his add either anymore. 
---
but does the one that gank you PVP?
---
Easy, a gnome slept with your wife and now you hate gnomes
---
I thought that was an enjoyable read. Obviously peoples favourite zones are very personal and I love hearing the reasoning for their choices.
---
My personal top 5 would be:
---
1. Feralas
---
2. Hinterlands
---
4. Barrens
---
5. Desolace
---
We will have to see with the release, but the hit modifier probably changes after 300 weapon skill and therefore each additional point is very helpful.
---
The last one gets to me so damn well. I miss the time when I was seen as a traveler by the other npcs in the game and the ultimate champion of the universe 
---
I don't see how a one-time purchase would be better for the overall health of the game rather than subscription based. If anything that would be more likely for Blizzard to pump out a ton of sales at launch and then completely drop support for the game. Relying on a subscription for their payment should make them more interested in keeping the players happy than a one-time purchase.
---
&gt; You're assuming that there's no other times during this playthough where we'd be flying, autorunning, etc.
---
I am not sure where you got that from. Or who you think could have played WoW and been unaware of that.
---
I'm just saying that unless you are neck and neck for some server first that means a lot to you, a 30 minute cruisy detour for 20 minutes of xp is actually a pretty sweet deal.
---
Yeah I mean if you pull 3 elites in Deadmines and the tank and maybe even the rest of the group is around level 19 you're gonna wipe for sure if you don't have a sheep or some other CC.
---
Warriors basically have nonexistent AoE threat in vanilla just in general but especially at that level. You're going to probably need to sunder the first mob 2 times just to keep aggro from the healer since they have to spam big heals 24/7 if you're tanking 3 mobs and if the DPS goes ham on the group while you're sundering you're basically never pulling aggro from more than 1 mob.
---
I never have either.
---
As I understand the timeline, loot trading on needed and greeded items was introduced in Cataclysm and was to some extent abused the way people are talking about here.
---
That didn't work out well so they changed it to loot trading on greeded items only which as far as I can tell has no downsides and is the obvious version to implement.
---
Then they got rid of players divvying up loot entirely in favour of personal loot which is the current system.
---
The kind of people who have a deep emotional need to panic and scream and circlejerk have apparently leaped to the conclusion that loot trading on needed items is definitely going to happen unless they all wet themselves on Blizzard's doorstep at once as an act of protest. But there is no evidence whatsoever that this will happen and it would also be stupid, so this is something I am definitely not worried about in the slightest.
---
what would have happened if your dad got to the place, where he met your mom for the first time, a day later?
---
&gt;I learned to use the auction house early and tried to sell just about everything.
---
aah yes, but again, I didn't know what "buyout" means... so I was adding only bid... and wondering why nobody buys it XÐ.
---
Then, I saw that almost all auctions have buyout, so maybe mine should too? and... it worked XÐ
---
&gt;Kept forgetting to spend talent points. My friend kept reminding me. At level 20 I had 4 or 5 to spend.
---
I kept WANTING MORE TALENT POINTS TO SPEND XÐ
---
Though, at leevl 20 I too had 5, because I was saving, as there was quite nothing good to spend them on - high-level abilities, or something.
---
&gt;Next day at school friends told me nightelf was lame and to reroll horde
---
my mistake in another game, was playing on the same server as school "friends". School enemies, I'd call that. Kept stalking and PK'ing each other randomly... including me.
---
Journey, the hunter who got to 60 in 3 days /played did 2~3 hours sleep, didn't he?
---
&gt; At level 8 or 9 I tried to fight a level 60 mage who was attacking Darnasses. I think I had him om the ropes but he got me.
---
yes, I rememer killing a level ?? horde warlock in Darkshire on some rooftop. He was AFK, but anyway, I still felt so powerful...
---
I didnt particularly enjoy it but thematically I thought it was really well done and really felt......desolate
---
&gt;Like a tank? Like an army tank?
---
haha, when I first heard the word "tank", I related it to the 1990 arcade game, where one shot was enough to kill a tank.
---
And I found it quite unappropriate for people taking the most of hits...
---
lol @ sm/st requirement for 60 dungeons
---
Other comments here say it's more about concerns over theoretically rebalancing properly than nostalgia, but I'm sure there are lot of "no changes" diehards out there about this issue as well.
---
And yeah, I have something of a love/hate relationship with Classic (mostly hate from being stubborn about Feral Druid), but I still really want to play a lot just to see about certain things now.  I mostly want to see just how strong of an effect player perception had back then vs. the reality of things because I suspect it was rather huge.
---
And yeah, I predicted from almost the beginning they would have 2hr loot trading because it's a great way to reduce customer support workload.  I'm very sympathetic to the risk it introduces, but we'll just have to wait and see what people do.
---
However, about the debuff limit, I'm sorry to say that they already decided on it: https://classic.wowhead.com/news=288407.15/blizzcon-2018-restoring-history-creating-wow-classic-panel
---
&gt; I.e. Debuff Limit - in 2004 you could have 8 debuffs on a mob and that was it. In 2005 it was 16, BC it was 40, now it's effectively uncapped. This originally was a technical limitation, not a design values problem. We will be restoring it to 16 debuff limit. It is objectively worse design but we don't want to mess with the 1.12 data so we're going with 16.
---
&gt; Other decisions were slightly less clear cut. At one point in WoW’s history, there was an 8 debuff limit on any one target. This was later raised to 16, and today there is no debuff limit. Thes change radically changed the balance of classes and strategies players could employ when using these debuffs to overcome content. To preserve that balance—and to avoid the slippery slope of retuning patch 1.12 data to compensate for such modern-era changes—we’re looking at setting a debuff limit of 16 for WoW Classic.
---
It sounds like a little of both technical and design concerns to me.  It also sounds like they're almost on the fence about it, so I won't say it's 100% guaranteed it'll be the same 16 debuff limit, but I'm gonna go with 99%. :P
---
&gt;I had dialup so it took a week of on and off downloading the patches while everybody slept
---
haha my history in dialup was that I didn't have a subscription, so had to pay for every impulse like for international call. Well, there was just "international call". EU or not EU, it didn't matter back then. When hearing the world "EU", people thought only about replacing their national flag on car plates with EU flag, and replacing their currency with that EURO with weird inflation, and therefore would never say "yes" to it.
---
&gt; I was overwhelmed and not enjoying it.
---
so, even vanilla was not vanilla enough...
---
You absolutely don't understand the problem. You believe there will be the same number of ninja now than there was in Vanilla.
---
There are gonna be more, read well, MORE people that ninja with loot trading. Because it's way more lucrative to do so with loot trading.
---
I can understand many potential ninja didn't ninja in Vanilla, because it wasn't worth it. All that jazz for 2-5 gold at the NPC? Cmon. I never saw a ninja myself.
---
Now with loot trading they can gain a loooot of money. And group of 3-4 people can roll together if 1 particular player needs 1 item, since they can trade it between them.
---
let me guess: you both played with the "flight" power?
---
Gnome = master race
---
&gt;Look at all the spikes and so on. Well I took one look around and went "this is ugly as hell, everythings red and theres dirt everywhere I'm not playing this game."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;He ended up rerolling as a Blood elf so I'd stop complaining and took every opportunity presented to die so he could laugh at his death animation.
---
I've alwyas /ignore'd such people... and went out of relationship because of that.
---
&gt;I heard that Giga Games will be showing WoW Beta, so my brother and I watched the show and it was so mindblowing
---
what I hated about those show, was that they always tried to show the action in all games... even in the sims.
---
IIRC it was 4 hours. He did a 35ish hour, then slept 4 hour, and then finished it with like 30? hours
---
I am so in doubt whether I will run a druid or a hunter in classic. Still going for hunter, because while druid is so versatile, I'm doing the same dps at lvl 50+ as my hunter at lvl 35. And I always see the same bear/catform. 
---
But yes, as a hunter it will be a struggle to find dungeon groups in classic probably, while druids are welcome in any role.
---
Uhm i fear that in another 6-7 years the MMO genre will be done for good. Unless Riot or Epic Games (you know, the good companies) come up with something.
---
I was like "if they don't put barrens, STV and Hillsbrad in top 3, i'l be real mad. Good.
---
It’s mentioned in the Worgen quest line iirc.
---
Mage ofc, would squeeze them from all the consumables needed for the rest of the day.
---
Would you explain why horde is the minority in PvE server? I legit do not imagine why. Big noob here.
---
there is no \[Ahead of the Curve\] in Vanilla, remember it
---
I totally agree that it does not matter much with those sort of things because addons can (and will) be there to solve it. Sure it's nice to just have it in the game, but honestly, it's not gamebreaking.
---
There is something a little bit worrying if they choose to not have the same font, though. It really wouldn't take much time for them to change the font, so if that's where the line of detail stops it might indicate bigger problems. It would mean the philosophy to really try and masterfully recreate vanilla isn't there.
---
Personally I think they still have a desire to even make those small details fit. Acti-blizz hate aside, it does seem like there are more Blizzard than Activision involved in this project.
---
you mean God in Arabic?
---
&gt; Recall math from grade school - always bring terms to lowest form with factoring, their is no reason to have something cost 100 when it can cost 10. 
---
The problem with this example is that what previously cost 10 now cost 1 etc, you can't just apply this and call it a day. 
---
There was a survey and like 80% of the original vanilla WoW players are 25-40 nowadays and from western countries. Exactly this demographic will just drink 3 beers less a weekend and go play WoW. 
---
do you really think that there will only be 13k people on classic release ?
---
Is it worth getting block?
---
The last one is the best one - Cant wait to just be a traveler peon again
---
I remember the first time I got some one to do a crusader enchant for me I was so scared to have over the mats. They cost so much!!!
---
You get Thunder Clap at level 20 but you can only use it in Battle Stance. So if you want to cast Thunder Clap as a tank you have to start the fight in Battle Stance which makes you take more damage, then you Thunder Clap and switch to Defensive Stance which makes you lose any rage you maybe had left over.
---
Typically the easiest way you would Thunder Clap mobs is cast Battle Stance --&gt; Use Bloodrage --&gt; Charge --&gt; Thunder Clap --&gt; Switch to Defensive Stance for the rest of the fight.
---
Generally speaking Thunder Clap is very poor for AoE threat in vanilla. Your best option would be to use shouts which you can do in Defensive Stance. I think Battle Shout generates more threat than a single Thunder Clap, and only costs 10 rage versus 25.
---
The best way to Thunder Clap is at the start of a pull if you're able to Charge in, but most of the time you're pulling mobs with your ranged weapon so you're almost never going to cast Thunder Clap as a tank and it's really overrated and just doesn't do very much.
---
Also, both Battle Stance and Berserker stance give you a really poor threat multiplier when you use abilities while in them. You only get 0.8 threat while in those stances, while if you're in Defensive Stance you have a 1.3 threat multiplier.
---
On top of that you take 10% less damage in Defensive Stance so it's never worth it to start stance dancing in the middle of a fight just to cast a Thunder Clap, just use a shout instead and it's way more effective.
---
My top 5 would probably be:
---
1. Burning Steppes.
---
2. Duskwood.
---
3. Barrens.
---
4. Searing Gorge.
---
5. Western Plaguelands.
---
Seems i like the darker zones 🤔
---
in my experience, especially in the earlier days of vanilla, most people chose weapon enchant based on the look, rather than the effect
---
Not everything harder is better.
---
Look at  mythic dungeons in WoW. It looks A LOT like D3 dungeon crawling. If I want to play a dungeon crawler actionRPG, I play D3 or Path of Exile.
---
All these hoops and rings you jump through are artifical and clash with the game world.
---
Stratholme is atmospheric and if you die to 4 ghouls you know they wrecked your shit because they are hard hitting dualwielders eating your 2k health mage alive. 
---
If you die to some every-week-a-new-aura thingi from mobs, it takes away from the atmosphere in the dungeon making it difficult artificially.
---
N'Zoth, Azshara. 
---
Never heard of it. 
---
What would the talent build for duel wield tanking look like? How would its expected threat be and how does it compare to bear tank?
---
Dang it, I wish he'd show us his leveling route
---
Unholy weapon, anyone?
---
Actually,Shamans have no chance. Spell lock,deathcoil,curse of tongues and his pet killing totems. Shaman would never win unless the warlock is retarded.
---
Shut up you pretentious little mug. 
---
Ferals, hunters, rogues --&gt; Triprunner dungarees are OP until late 40s.
---
However most of the time you're not going to be able to just charge into a mob pack, like 99% of the time you're pulling mobs with your ranged weapon to avoid ninja pulling and to get them to a safer place to be able to kill them.
---
Generally speaking Thunder Clap is very poor for AoE threat in vanilla. Your best option would be to use shouts which you can do in Defensive Stance. Battle Shout generates 2 times more threat with the Defensive Stance threat multiplier than a single Thunder Clap, and only costs 10 rage versus 25. Generally speaking Thunder Clap is just really bad for tanking in vanilla and you're almost never going to use it.
---
Also, both Battle Stance and Berserker stance give you a really poor threat multiplier when you use abilities while in them. You only get 0.8 threat while in those stances, while if you're in Defensive Stance you have a 1.3 threat multiplier. Thunder Clap seems better than what it is because often people don't factor in the threat multiplier penalty you get while casting it as a tank in Battle Stance, in reality it's a terrible ability to use for AoE threat.
---
Your best threat generating abilities as a tank are Revenge, Shield Slam and Sunder Armor and all of those are single target. Warriors have really poor AoE threat in vanilla WoW which is why CC also matters more, because the less mobs the tank has to hit the easier it is to hold threat.
---
Im just saying, not very likely you get bonebiter at level 34. Unless you have people to carry you through the pre-quests AND instance. a L34 warrior isnt going to tank SM cath in launch rush in greens.
---
The thing that OP doesnt count in is... competition. There is ZERO competition of mobs and xp/h inside a instance. Out in the world you have WPVP and same faction trying to tag every fucking mob in sight. Hes specifically talking about melee classes that HARDLY are going to be in the fastest levelers, no matter what you do. So out in the open you will compete with maybe bit less /playtime warlocks/hunters pets on aggressive, mages aoeing the fuck out of spawn areas etc.
---
Getting to 60 in hurry is fine, but admit WHY you are rushing there. There are 2 very legit reasons to do it, imo. You are going for realm firsts OR you are trying to make a ton of gold by being the firsts guys to farm lotuses, crystals and buying everything off AH. A lot of people already have guilds and friends setup, so you dont NEED to rush to 60 for pre-bis gear grind to get into a proper guild. Some kind of schedules for the raiding etc is set before you create your char.
---
Id say do it at reasonable place, do the instances it will make the levelup bit more interesting and fun. Might not be the absolute best xp, but you never know how bad things could be outside the instance, either.
---
Cloth shoulders
---
Warrior/Paladin Human starting armor
---
Mageladin confirmed
---
Argh! Same happened to me, I was yelling in all caps and they still went ahead. To be fair that was using LFG in retail.
---
The wait is not even close to be over. Sure, time wise...6-8 months. But, there are plenty of issues that are not set in stone, and a number of things that might come up before release.
---
I would consider that the wait is over, after we will know, for sure, the server pop cap, how and if the loot trading will be implemented, the content release time table, sharding, itemization.
---
On a private server, playing on my warr alt i tend to keep admiring the fiery weapon enchant every time i open my char panel. It glows so much that it almost fills the 3d preview window (on a big 2-h).
---
Back when not knowing anything was the standard ^_^
---
Everyone knew this already. 
---
The only dungeon I can think of that is worth it might be Zul Farrak where you have around 6-7 quests and can grind outside until everyone is ready. 
---
It helps setting you up for some friends and guild community once you hit 60 though. If you 've run some dungeons with other rushers, you tend to know them a little bit making the endgame dungeon groups easier to form/run.
---
The alliance are evil, from a certain point of view. 
---
i loved that time. when classic comes out i will stay away from any guide / youtube video / theory crafting. i will do everything by myself. as far as possible i will also not look up anything that helps completing quests. (except i really have to clue after trying for a long time) i cant wait for it &lt;3
---
I'd imagine they ended up pulling 3 trash mobs along with the boss and wiped that way. Usually I always kill Cookie before proceeding to Van Cleef.
---
After we've killed Mr. Smite and run up the plank to the ship I usually turn left instead of right and start pulling the trash mobs. Cookie will patrol to that side of the ship so I usually just grab him from there and then start clearing to Van Cleef.
---
Often times if you do Cookie after Van Cleef people will just jump down and pull adds from all sides so I don't tend to trust pugs that much because it's just safer to kill 3-4 trash mobs after Mr. Smite and make sure the boss dies safely.
---
Usually in vanilla you switch between zones pretty frequently, as in you do a couple of quests in one zone, then u have a bunch of red quests left there. Then u go to another zone, do a couple of quests and the followups are orange/red. Then u go back to the first zone i was talking about and do those quests etc. So there is quite alot of traveltime, therefor its good to have some kind of lvling guide so you dont waste time. I would recommend Joanas leveling guide.
---
I do wish rares gave some reward, like a quarter of quest worth of EXP or a guaranteed green item.
---
"Moral ground"? Like selling boosts, gear, gold? Like shutting down the server because w/e reason? 
---
If sharding is on after the starter zones, most people will just stop playing Classic, whether is on Blizzard servers or private servers.
---
Loot trading, if available only on raids and with master loot on, is actually a positive thing.
---
Just stop with private servers already...and their "moral ground".
---
The questline that ends with ‘In dreams’.
---
A raid quest, for Hearthglen, trying to reunite Tirion Fordring &amp; Taelan Fordring. Decent rewards aswell
---
Honestly, at this point I'm actually thinking of not playing Classic and just playing a private TBC realm.
---
There's ZERO chance Activision won't fuck with Classic.
---
Either it's not profitable (unlikely), then they can it.
---
Or it IS profitable, then they add paid DLCs to it. 
---
Mark my words, a year into the release of Classic, paid max level boosts will be a thing. 
---
I'm tired of being sold to, when I already bought the game, the expansions, and paying a monthly fee. 
---
Enough is enough. 
---
Technically, any class can tank.
---
I have seen a lvl 60 Priest soloing Scarlet Monastery. Technically, he was tanking :)
---
I'm not going to watch 10 minutes of video for something that could be explained in 1-2 paragraphs of text. Can someone summarise?
---
Male animations are way too clunky to me
---
Anyone that isn't a warrior, rogue, feral druid or ret paladin. They always roll for my gear...
---
Sincerely,
---
A Hunter
---
Queue dodging bad
---
No it doesn't. 
---
Thank god I didn't watch it
---
The problem is that they, Blizzard, did not gave any additional info past "we plan on having loot trading".
---
They didn't say how will it work...but they said something on the lines of "no more excuses for miss clicking on need", which implies that they want loot trading for need also.
---
And that is a BIG EFFING problem.
---
Void Lords i guess
---
&gt;Like selling boosts, gear, gold?
---
Yeah because u can't do that in WoW retail , lol...
---
I never watch videos that just happen to be just over 10 minutes.
---
you know theres 2-3 minutes of actual content + alot of padding to hit that extra ad revenue mark.
---
Nice 
---
warrior tips 
---
Indeed would love to see all my old enemies 
---
The "exploit" is premades dodging premades in bgs. Apparently it removes all skill from getting high pvp ranks, ignoring the fact that getting high ranks has always been about the tedious grind. Though I admit it does make things annoying for solo players.
---
IMO, things like premades dodging premades, or cross faction win trading, or an implicit agreement to give the win to the first flag capper in WSG have always been the reality of premade BGs in vanilla.
---
CET and EST have 6 hours of difference,so 19:00 PM CET is 13:00 PM EST
---
I didn't notice that (now I did) but my problem is that people nowadays are complete retards and can't follow two or three paragraphs of text without starting to feel dizzy, so they need everything explained to them in a video.
---
Joana's guide works great. It shows every step but you can also just use it to see how long you should stay in each zone.
---
It's a sword, it has blue runes on it. It's a Frostmourne.
---
Circle was always third target after Skull and X on my servers.
---
Activi$ion
---
Why do they call it WoW? Because when you see it you go "Wow!" and your social life ends.
---
Queue dodgers bad.  Give queue dodgers a 15 minute penalty to de-incentivize queue dodging.
---
This video does a good job of highlighting what is so bad premades using queue dodging.
---
Without queue dodging, pug v pug games will be a lot more common, and premade v premade games will also occur.
---
With queue dodging, the premades have a strong incentive to use queue dodging, because if some premade group A is effectively dodging enemy premades, it will farm honor at a much faster rate than premade B. As such, because honor is relative, premade B will also have to use queue dodging. This makes it so that no premades will go against each other (as they will dodge instead), and will only go against pugs. Thus no premade v premade matches will happen, and significantly fewer pug v pug matches will be allowed to occur as well.
---
If you care about endgame battleground PvP and want puggers to actually have an enjoyable game where they don't get roflstomped, or alternatively you want a premade group to be able to play more high level premade v premade battlegrounds, then you should care about this issue.
---
We don’t know any of that. All they said was they had a lot of work to do. If you mean dungeons and raids weren’t in the demo, they were left out purposely.
---
You can be a panda female IRL.
---
What is the problem, since obviously you are totally mentally ill.
---
Not sure joana have released a guide for alliance but I might be wrong 
---
If you rush on a pvp server, you will be surrounded by other rushers. And rushers don't pvp (wastes time after all). So as long as you stay well ahead of the curve, ganks will be pretty rare.
---
&gt; I'm mostly excited for low numbers.
---
I don't know how Blizzard pulled this off so well, honestly.
---
I'm working on an RPG that uses a variation of the WC3 stat rules, with character levels up to 50, and either my numbers get out of control or I'm extremely limited in the amount of different items I can create.
---
You seem to be missing the whole point. No, debuff limit is not a great game design, but it was part of Vanilla. Changing it would potentially change a lot of the meta. What classes to bring to raid will change, priotizing certain debuffs will not be part of it.
---
The philosophy of the Classic project is a recreation of Vanilla, not a reimagination of it.
---
The rushers get to 60 days before other people get there. Then, they group together and gear up in the endgame dungeons, so by the time others reach 60, they will be decked in 0.5tier and will be the ones deciding whether a new 60 is worth grouping with, not the other way around.
---
low effort clickbait with no content  
---
don't lose your dayjob buddy
---
Remember to not spec improved shadowbolt either. It'll mess up the assigned debuff slots!
---
8 debuff slots is really stupid. Even with server-side debuff priority and somewhat decent debuff discipline it is a mess. Someone will accidentally put up the wrong debuff or a tank feels the need to use demo shout because of slow heals and it starts a cascade of debuffs knocking each other off.
---
16 debuff slots is fine as it allows for more wriggle room but still requires some discipline in not putting up junk debuffs like serpent sting.
---
&gt; What I want people to do is remove the idea of boss healthpools when looking at the subject.
---
You keep saying this in several comments. You seem to not quite understand what people are telling you. It does not make sense to look without numbers, since the change we are talking about is *directly linked to numbers*. 
---
You are essentially asking "does anyone care about debuff limit if your answer can't be X" where X is the reason people care about debuff limit. If people can't bring in meta, dmg, boss balance etc., then why do you even ask?
---
If you simply want to know if anyone is attached to it with nostalgic, then no. But it means a lot to the way the game is in PvE, *that* is why people don't want unlimited debuffs.
---
Due to the number of quests, lore and atmosphere any list not having Duskwood in the top 5 is a a travesty.
---
This guy really hates swamp and snow zones.
---
Lol so true
---
Kara could be the 20M Naxx equivalent. For smaller guilds. So they can progress, ZG-AQ20-Kara
---
When the game is released, even if its not everything everyone wants, the WAIT is over for 99% of the people. Because we wanted them to release classic on paid service where we dont have to rely on servers that might be shady or shut down at pretty much any second. Where they have PAID customer support monitoring the chat for gold seller spam etc.
---
I dont believe for a second that serious vanilla player will stay on private servers, even if there are things in classic they dont like. They will just suck it up and play it.
---
Also theres Uther in full Judgement with Sulfuras
---
it's funny, because it's true.   
---
need to add:   
---
"back in a day you had to group up for quests"  
---
meanwhile in reality: 
---
* "inv for quest pls" -&gt; "group full" -&gt; waits 20 mins for mobs to respawn 
---
* ninjaing loots aka "hey, it was my turn to pick up the quest item, asshole!"
---
* mages sheeping mobs to full hp
---
* loot 20 murloc eyes from murlocs that apparently don't have eyes
---
Warriors are the best "hybrid" in that sense. They are the best tank, as well as a top DPS class.
---
There are no meme specs, only meme players. 
---
its actually pretty informative and not overly stretched in length.
---
Yes, but in terms of overall numbers it is a fact that there where more alliance than horde in vanilla. This only changed in TBC.
---
Shame it's in a dead game
---
Druids level very fast and can tank or heal dungeons in any spec
---
But you hit 60 fast, isn‘t that a good price for it?
---
Nice, I knew a boomie could princess but did not know it could tribute
---
Yep, the icons didn't exist in the beginning, but that was certainly a feature that was very welcome.
---
It doesn't need to "come back" because it still exists. On my pserver there are names I could drop right now of legendary players with Qiraji Battle Tanks that are legends, and one of them literally carries Naxx pugs with a core group.
---
The legends never died. They just left retail WoW.
---
Silly ret paladin, warriors mostly wear leather, mail and whatsoever but not plate!
---
I would’ve loved to see arathi highlands and winterspring much higher on the list. 
---
Beastslayer on my mage's staff COME AT ME BRO.
---
I have my awesome characters and amazing guild on a pserver that's committed to staying open. They do so much to maintain an authentic Vanilla experience.
---
I'll give Activision Blizzard a chance. If they fuck it up, I won't lose much.
---
But it's always the healer's fault, people died because they ran out of health!
---
Kidding aside thanks for the clarification. :)
---
Always supplying new glow tricks when fun detector got the older ones.
---
Considering the fact how many different replies that question for zone ranking would get (and probably will get in this thread) just goes on to prove how awesome vanilla was.
---
&gt; 1 minute of semi useful but widely know info, 5 minutes sucking the dick of PvP servers. We get it, you want to gank lowbies. FFS get past it.
---
sigh
---
this.
---
same here!
---
Not viable at all, they dont bring anything usefull and therefor they take an extra dps slot for progression (MC/BWL) 
---
Over xmas couldn't wait 6 months so decided to mess around on a private server. I finally got my Whirlwind Axe last night, instantly had to get Minor Beastslayer on it. Such Nostalgia, Much WoW
---
&gt;I'll believe it when I see it.
---
out of all the hybrids a truly dedicated feral is alright, i think 80% of the top dps? it depends on the fights of course and length but they are no where near as bad as shaman or pally dps, and can offtank comfortably when needed for aoe adds and such, not sure about their aoe for dungeons but they get to go as tank for it which is fast for groups
---
Stats that increase your block amount and block chance have a much bigger effect when being hit by small amounts as it's a static amount deducted from damage taken. Block is therefore much more useful when AOE tanking packs of weaker hitting mobs compared to a hard hitting boss.
---
Block value also increases the damage/threat of shield slam if prot.
---
Generally speaking Block just helps smooth your damage intake. Tanking stats all help each other - you may not notice a small amount of dodge or a small amount of stamina, but if you add a small amount of EVERYTHING then it all starts comboing together and you really do notice your overall toughness increasing.
---
Block gets better the more flat armor you have as it deducts its value from a smaller amount, and block chance and block value both get better the more of each you have.
---
Are there any crucial 2-handers to acquire while leveling to ease the journey? 
---
That is correct, he is working full time now like a month back and to classic launch with alliance guide and an ingame guide based on his runs. There actually is a guide for 1-12 as alliance on his website [joanasworld.com](https://joanasworld.com) atm. So the 12-60 guide should be finished "soon" :D
---
It's kinda your fault for attacking a hunter whose pet isn't named "Cat".
---
&gt;I really dont understand
---
Imagine you're a fan of Super Mario Bros 2 but there is absolutely no way of playing it except through illegal emulators.
---
Finally Nintendo, after much fan backlash and requests, acquiesce and release SMB2 on the Virtual Console.
---
Then you go to buy it and, wait a minute, all the graphics are 2.5D New Super Mario Bros style! Even though all the levels are the same, it's not the same. It's not SMB2.
---
Maybe this can help you understand.
---
Which quest was this again? I remember getting Hippogryph eggs from Feralas but not a line that takes you to ZG.
---
At 30 you can do a quest to get Berserker stance, and it also comes with a Whirlwind weapon which will last you until 50 (particularly the axe which is the slowest of the 3 options). It requires killing a level 40 elite though I think, so either you buy a crap tonne of alchemy consumables or ask for some help. 
---
I remember whispering a stranger in storm windows who told me what it was and then made it my life's mission to get beastslayer... I became an enchanter that reason alone 14 years afom. It's still my primary profession
---
It says Alliance in the title you Muppet.
---
ZING!
---
I'm curious myself as to whether any viable DW build would out threat a pure prot build with shield slam.
---
You could cobble together something that gets 30 prot for 1h spec and 20 fury but you'd not have any big instant hit attack. Going 31 fury 15 prot for bloodthirst + defiance would work but you'd not have any of the crit talents from Arms nor any way of properly stance dancing without tac mastery so you'd probably be better off just running a pure 20/31/0 fury build. Dual Wield tanking was a lot better in TBC when you had Devastate in Prot.
---
A DW tank would never compare to a Bear tank though. Bears get their huge threat modifiers on Maul/Swipe as a multiplier on damage done, whereas warrior threat is static amounts on Sunder/Heroic Strike, plus def stance.
---
Then use an alliance version? 
---
Whatever
---
You're right in general, and I just want to point out that as you're not getting wwa until about 40 anyway and bonebiter is better, then going for bonebiter at high 30s if you can find a good group is legit. Either weapon can honestly carry a warrior all the way to 60.
---
Joanna has done only the starting zones on the Alliance side. 
---
I have a pretty good idea about most of it, it's pretty much just abusing several grinding spots with mobs that have questionable armor or warlock mobs(for some reason the warlock pets give exp and are very squishy), I checked his position several times doing the launch and saw the zones. 
---
I'd still want atiesh to be the way to get into it though, so as a catch-up raid it might not quite work. I'm thinking more like a bonus insane raid that drops janky pvp gear.
---
Perfectly fine. They do all the damage a feral does + the damage of the rebirthed rogue that died to aggro + the damage of the mage that got innervated cause he forgot his potions.
---
Thats some solid dps.
---
One feral is fine as they bring the option of another combat res and a bear offtank. You'd want the kitty to be prepared to be flexible though.
---
You apparently would be a clairvoyant genius.  How dare you suggest that other players should inconvenience themselves by exercising discretion prior to joining a pug!
---
Related; me and my friends are considering farming BRD/ DME for the last 2-3 levels. You're gonna farm them anyways so definitely worth considering.
---
This is the spec for DW tanking: [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVV0VgxoVoxfzox](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LZVV0VgxoVoxfzox)
---
In hardcore guilds, the tanks usually start using this spec or some variation in order to do enough TPS to have no threat problems.
---
It's not paranoia for those who feel Blizzard's recent track record to be 5+ unenjoyable expansions in a row. Believing them capable of making changes while considering the vast knock on effects and respecting the original design intent is less than realistic in that case.
---
DW fury spec with defiance easily outthreats prot build. But its only necessary for hardcore guilds, as it requires better healers and tanks than a casual guild would have. 
---
It’s paranoia for them and everyone else.
---
Staff of Westfall/Crescent Staff -&gt; Whirlwind Axe -&gt; Bonebiter (alli only) -&gt; Resurgence Rod
---
I play feral dps on a server which is at zg patch atm. After first week of BWL with world buffs i got to #9 of all rogues on the server in average dps with shitty green/blue gear. And this was without warchief's blessing buff.
---
Dont believe the bullshit that people who played the game 14 years ago tell you. I played it back then as well and at the time feral was complete trash but the game and meta has changed so much and new things have been discovered which have allowed people to play specs differently.
---
Feral beats hunters and every caster in mc+bwl, you can even beat rogues in single target if you have equal gear. You have to put time and effort to your class just like any other class if you want to compete, maybe a little extra due to more difficult rotation and having to farm pummelers and bringing mana pots/runes.
---
I created my hero, then a level 60 boosted me every night until I got to around level 40 and I never heard from him again. It was strange..
---
Just deny it, joke’s on you
---
Nice, should give it a spin
---
[Yes, I remember!](https://i.imgur.com/rTaobTM.jpg)
---
Yeah, but thb id say you will manage to do cath in the 37-38 range, so yeah. And for horde its not even a option. They must grind for ravager drop.
---
I wouldnt want to see L55-60 with a WWA or bonebiter. But yeah, unless you are going for server firsts, id take my time and get professions level up and do instances with guildies. Spamming and waiting for a run isnt really worth it. And the problem is that when you are in the higher range to do all of the instance quests, you dont have unlimited time to wait for a run. Like in SM. You can do first parts much earlier, but doing those is kinda meh without cath. So in the end if you dont get a group when you are in proper level, it might be ok to skip it.
---
Thats why i prefer doing it bit more reasonable pace and do the instances with guildies, when i have faith that the run is ok even if they arent the level you want in a pug. 
---
Almost all of them after the starting zones will give you something worthwhile 
---
Hey mate, thanks for the kind words. Appreciate it! 
---
My issue with it is that ninja looting for yourself feels rightfully selfish - under loot trading, ninja looting instead becomes something you do for your friend. And I firmly believe that most people are more willing to screw over strangers for their friends' benefit than for their own.
---
If you're going to be Dual Wield tanking though, and dropping the huge armor boost you get from a shield, plus your block chance, plus the ability to push Crushing Blows off the table via Shield Block...
---
... why would you not just use a Bear druid at this point? Bears should be able to push out even more threat than a DW warrior and should have better mitigation if geared right compared to a shieldless warrior.
---
I picked Sword of Omen on my warlock because it looked cool, then I enchanted it with beastslaying to make it even cooler. I had absolutely no idea what I was doing.
---
Pure guesses here. a) mobs spawning faster. b) that player would be even more alone to grab aoe spots possibly, depending on how shards would split zones ofc
---
Great idea. But then which ends up canon?
---
An opportunistic kill on opposing faction to reduce mob competition? Rushers pvp when it suits. 
---
I wouldn’t count at getting ice barbed spear at 51 on a fresh server
---
Seriously. This is the ultimate case of pants of head stupid armchair CEO lol
---
People were “ respected” for killing the content bosses not worshipped.
---
thats what feels it more satisfied then the current contents. Cause no one fuks bout your achivements. No matter how impossible it is compared the vanilla ones. 
---
Blizzard wasnt worrying bout the problem until now because currently game is just died. Do you think the next expansion pack actvi would allow the dev team to use the money for new content? Ofc not. İts simply will be bad than the current version so, they simply wanted to experience on the original one to see where they did wrong. (İts actually obvious but they dont seem to understand it yet.)
---
Id say 1 feral is OPTIMAL for early content. Since a feral spec druid tanks out dps a prot warrior by a lot. And you give a aura buff to melee that you cannot get in any other way. This changes through the content when tanks start to do fury without a shield and low armor. And really, another innervate and combat res is never a bad thing.
---
The counter argument is that you can "get by" with a dps warrior slapping a shield on in bosses where you need more than 2 tanks. But then again, if you go down that road, why not bring example a SP... because you can "get by with one", if you know what i mean.
---
Ferals have some interesting weapon choices, especially that one that boosts attack speed on use etc. 
---
Yeah, I'm just talking from the perspective of a warrior wanting to hit 60 asap. Most of the server first warriors ended up using something about as good as wwa all the way up until 60, which isn't as bad as it really sounds - those weapons aren't close to optimal, but they do the job.
---
So what is this flaw in arguments for a debuff limit you have identified? Wanting it to be as it was isn't a flaw, it is a compelling case since the whole project is to recreate a great game that no longer exists. 
---
By "fun factor" do you mean that fighting bosses isn't fun for you as it is?
---
The raids being epic, wondrous and super hard. 
---
Personally I think power shifting with the reliance on some level 40 helmet is kinda crappy. It's a work-around that ideally shouldn't be needed to be performant. I wouldn't enjoy that kind of play style and it would suck if some low level helmet is the best in slot while raiding.
---
Paranoia has to be irrational. To be concerned about Blizzard's capability when the number of unenjoyable expansions far exceeds the number of good expansions and while the gameplay philosophy has shifted further and further away from it once was isn't irrational for people that feel that way.
---
Duskwood pre light charge was  numero uno!
---
If possible i try to get Executioners Cleaver for 43-&gt;51, if AV is ingame get that pole so you can get trash blade from the mara quest.
---
Blizz literally said they envisioned them as a DPS class but once they were only used as healers they just sort of accepted it. 
---
&gt;XÐ
---
Well that's a new one. Is that meant to be a piercing-on-the-lip ex-dee?
---
It’s definitely irrational. It’s a computer game and it’s not even out yet.
---
We can all fling poo at the evil company once we actually have a product to judge.
---
You are not going to kill the elite without a 5m warr or pref 1 healer in there.
---
&gt; I loved Tanaris. It's just a big ol' honking desert in the middle of the continent.   
---
TIL south-eastern tip = middle
---
&gt; is static amounts on Sunder/Heroic Strike
---
This is not true for Heroic strike. The threat you make with it is:
---
(Basic AA Weapon Damage + Heroic Strike fixed bonus damage + Heroic Strike fixed bonus threat) x 1.3 x 1.15 
---
There are a lot of ways you can influence your basic AA Weapon damage which makes up the biggest portion in this formula. 
---
Bear's strength is in it's entirely multiplicative way his threat works and scales based only on the damage you deal as a bear without any static number additions you get as a warrior. However, at the same time it is also the greatest weakness, making you extremely dependable on consumables and world buffs - if you lose them, then things get much worse than in warrior's case.
---
Must be a server thing. On Kalecgos we always called it VC.
---
I don't think you're considering the component of raid discipline/co-operation needed to have optimal buffs.
---
There are a lot of things in Vanilla that are simple but the challenge lies in getting 40 or 50 people on the same page.
---
Removing the debuff limit doesn't really change the rotation of most classes anyway, most people I see advocate for this have a post-Vanilla expectation of DoT damage/scaling.
---
Agreed completely
---
&gt;Is that meant to be a piercing-on-the-lip ex-dee?
---
hmm... more like XÐ but tssss, mom's sleepin' :Ð
---
&gt;Vanilla was fun for many reasons, but debuff limits and such were not those reasons
---
...For you.
---
I quite enjoy the restriction of the debuff limit and how that changes as you scale down group size to 20/15/5 man.
---
Acting like there's something engaging about using Rupture instead of Eviscerate (depending on crit chance and boss armor) doesn't really make sense to me. 
---
Night elf worth it for PVP so I can hide with Shadowmeld then jump out on people? 
---
Also why when I take an invisibility potion it doesn't work like Stealth?
---
Dungeons are super worth it for the quests. One it breaks up the monotony of the grind as well as giving you upgrades you will use. If you remember at least as a 1 handed warrior you won't replace the sm/rfd weapons until thrash blade so you use them for a solid 7-10 levels! Which is huge especially because you're not having to spend money on them.
---
Lol can't even read your own posts yet you resort to name calling.
---
&gt;It’s definitely irrational.
---
If it's irrational to care about a leisure activity is a completely separate discussion.
---
If your concern is enjoyability it's entirely rational to voice your wants for a product, if that didn't happen it's unlikely classic would have become a reality in the first place. 
---
Definitely. Though before that you were forced to talk a bit more. I.e. "Focus left, I sheep right" etc. But it was just too useful anyways.
---
I am not referencing achievements, I am literally talking about the leveling curve of the mass of players
---
there is no curve.
---
Glad they learned from that mistake and definitely didn't repeat it with Kil'Jaeden in Legion.  
---
I'm still dirty that worgen got plainsrunning and Tauren didnt.
---
It is literally a figure of speech. Ahead of the curve. You are ahead of the mass of players leveling
---
Except there's no gear for them in early content, making them incredibly squishy tanks
---
Definitely, it’s just not rational to cry about a product that hasn’t even been released yet.
---
MC will be pugged as well.
---
Because Alliance have a lot of benefits in PvE like fear ward and Paladins that make raiding easier than it would be on Horde side.
---
Well, thats why they are the 3rd tank. Still better than a dps warrior without tank gear with a shield and no tanking talents.
---
In my opinion the second best hybrid in the game. I would only rate shadow priests higher.
---
Also the hardest rotation in the game. 
---
If you can master it, you could be the one guy people talk about on the server. 
---
I'll say 1 feral and 1 shadow per raid will be pritty common. 
---
its only viable if you are a tryhard ninjafuck. otherwise it sucks. 
---
I levelled a frost mage AoEing every chance I got and I never really felt like a priest had much to bring to the table, although I am open to other people's ideas and experience. If you do it right you barely get touched by the mobs, and the limiting factor is how many you can round up rather than your health. If any healer was a good combo with them I would have thought it would be a shaman, with their Earthbind totem to make mass kiting easier and chain lightning to help out with the DPS.
---
this is 100% correct.
---
And a toy-sized dev team 
---
Not in that detail. But the first time was the American Stresstest. So my friends and I got a proxy to download the client and play at 4 am.
---
Lol. Going to recreate that character as one of my bank chars. 
---
Bug fan of your vids. They always pop up on my recommend list when they release. Thanks for your hard work.
---
This was disappointing clickbait written by someone with no real love for classic, and with nothing interesting to say. 
---
Content density and OTT quests, involving vehicles for instance, is part of what ruined “retail” for me. 
---
Goblin starting zone was horrifying, and has nothing on the experience offered by these supposedly “empty” zones criticised by the author. 
---
I enjoyed Andromeda...
---
If your willing to put in 2x the effort of other classes you can do pretty decent dps.  But that involves farming 20 or so MCPs a, week, powershifting and being alliance
---
I played on multiple servers and it was always DM. When the oceanic servers launched some people tried to claim it was VC but they were quickly corrected. 
---
yeah the DPS doesnt hold up to Fury / Rogue afaik, but you get tons of utility. raw dps isn't the only thing that makes a class viable
---
Just play everquest
---
Not having flying mounts is just nostalgia.
---
I saw a Theorycrafter video on YouTube, who had ironfoe in main hand and a book in offhand.
---
Not kidding. 
---
Need pink booties to signify dps warrior. 
---
&gt;Wetlands
---
&gt;There were also some scattered quests if you're a dwarf.

There were a lot more than just some scattered quests, and not just for dwarves. There were the quests in Dun Modr, the ones around the Thandol Span, the ones surrounding the excavation, the ones surrounding the shipwrecks and the murlocs next to them, and the ones from that green elemental. I remember spending a lot of time questing there, and I can't really think of an alternative questing area for Alliance in that level range.
---
&gt;Arathi
---
&gt;which is probably most interesting for hosting the ruins of Arathor (for any lore-hunters out there)
---
Uh, Arathor stopped existing 1200 years ago. While it would be cool to see ruins from that time, the ruins in Arathi Highlands are Stromgarde, which has been sacked fairly recently. The ingame explanations for that are extremely scarce however, so I wouldn't fault a casual player for thinking they've been hundreds of years old. Honestly, Stromgarde was pretty much only destroyed so there's only one human kingdom left in the Alliance.
---
&gt;But instead the Hinterlands are one of the most understocked zones in the game featuring a scant few quests.
---
Again, I can count more than 30 quests on the Wiki. In comparison, Westfall has 38 quests, and nobody would call Westfall understocked.
---
&gt;Winterspring was delightful with its idyllic North Pole vibe. But it was also a high-level zone with hardly anything going on.
---
I count more than 50 quests on the Wiki, that's on the higher end for all questing areas. It's home to the Winterspring saber trainers. It has the Mechanical Yeti quest (I still have mine with 2 uses left) It was also one of the primary sources for Thorium ore and high-end herbs. There's a LOT going on there.
---
&gt;Un'Goro
---
&gt;I always felt like Blizzard could've done more here
---
Well, they did connect it to Sholazar Basin in Wrath, but overall this is the first time I fully agree with the author. Then again, adding more to Un'Goro would have perhaps ruined the primeval feeling of it.
---
too soon xd 
---
Awesome with the map at the end! Thanks.
---
My enchanter macro for trade chat advertised my services by color and cost of each enchant.  I also always kept a sizable stock of [Heavy Leather Balls].
---
And it had Rexxar! Desolace is a cool zone even for Alliance
---
He didn't phrase it quite right. It's not removing the idea of health pools, it's removing the idea of health pools that must be identical to how they were at launch. People advocate for the debuff limit because removing it could increase raid dps making content either. The counterargument Crumornus is making I gather is that thanks to 1.12 talents and itemization, boss health pools are already screwed up. Those arguing for the removal of the debuff pool say that increasing the debuff pool won't make fights easier because they assume there already exists a need for boss tuning due to the 1.12 changes.
---
It's also not rational to label all concerns as crying or paranoia. 
---
There's no reason to wait for release to discuss game mechanics and the implications of changing them. That's only relevant for the few doomsayers already convinced the game will be ruined.
---
You're right, goes to show how little improvements in quality of life lead to a change or reductio in player communication. Too much of those, and it bleeds everything dry. I feel that the icons helped more than they hurt, but certainly a slippery slope.
---
There is no reason to fret until we have game mechanics to judge. 
---
In most cases. I was playing on vanilla p servers with my 13 y/o brother and we had a blast of a time. Hes very excited for classic.
---
how is this content
---
He's on a broken server where concecrate scaled on attack power. Unfortunately the video is inaccurate as a result.
---
Don't totems balance the paladin stuff?
---
How viable would be a new born going to war? You got your answer.
---
I can't disagree with that #1. Didn't read the rest yet.
---
True, true, but I think that will either be accidentally said in some Q&amp;A or, really, be revealed only once beta launches, and even then it won't be 100%. I think Activision is aware of the fact that if they try to monetize Classic, community will RIOT. Additionally, I think Classic team is especially made of people who are passionate for the game and the managers above them also hold fond memories of Classic. Therefore, we don't have to worry about shitty design. Literally the only thing that might be a thing for Classic are arenas - because people loved TBC so much - but I doubt that as well. As of all the things you mentioned, I think they will be largely solved according to community's responses. I am pretty sure there will be progressive itemization and content, though the stages of the release might be different due to simplicity for repetition in the future. Regarding the stages, though, I think they will end up with more than 4 stages - I predict 6. Sharding will probably be the necessary people in Blizzard's eyes and I understand that and, though I absolutely don't agree with it, I will be fine with it at the very start of the server and in the earlies locations. We are talking like the first week and a half and the starting zones. Nothing more. I think pop cap will be higher than in retail vanilla, but lower than on Pservers. I predict 4.5K or 5K.
---
The only concert of mine is loot trading, which I find a bit of a problem for me. That is the only information I care for, really, assuming the rest of the stuff will be handeled wisely. Naturally, though, I wouldn't stand like a month of sharding or some scuffed itemization. I would riot if that would be announced.
---
Rogues dying to overaggro? :O they even gave them a lose threat ability and on top of that a emergancy escape button 
---
People cared less about random, low level dungeon drama than raid drama. He asked why people hate the idea of loot-trading in Classic (since that was never a thing), and I just explained the biggest problem with it. 
---
What is a ffxi server?
---
That reminds me....
---
So, pre WoW we were playing D2 and Wc3. In D2 especially, there were a lot of weapon effects and I remember being disappointed in WoW because things like Devotion Aura (and all the auras) didn't constantly glow when turned on.
---
I was hoping the whole game would have more effects. Looking back im 50/50 on the matter.
---
The most concurrent subs part won't last beyond a month or two, not Classic.
---
Imagine misconstruing a comment this poorly. You had a month to figure it out. Go to a doctor. 
---
Either whirlwind axe, or if alliance then bonebiter.
---
It can honestly last you to 60 at a pinch, and if no help is available you can solo it in the low 40s.
---
Enjoyment doesn't equal a quality game.
---
If you ask how it was: 
---
It was decent, but people back then didn't numbercrunch as hard and didn't knew as much as today. Was in the serverbest guild back then we had very few druids (Horde problim) and while we were doing naxx not one of them was healer anymore - because boomkin or feral brought much more utility. Starting with AQ you get a couple of maces which give a very good bonus to feral attack power in addition to more crit for furys or rogues. 
---
I guess because druids were a rare class back then, it was more a question if you had a druid at all, not what specc he was.
---
Now with years of numbercrunching and theorycraft a feral should be even better and hopefully there are more than just a tons of furys and rogues as melee dps ;-)
---
There was one feral dps in an old guild of mine who was really committed and he could out-dps the hunters.
---
Um, yeah.
---
Desolace is good IFF you know where to pick up quests, cause half of them you'll easily miss unless you already know they're there. Can't speak for other zones as much but Desolace is really big on that as much as it is a pain.
---
Introducing Heroic was the mistake. 10/25 is perfectly fine, adding hard mode was the problem. 
---
Lol it’s apparently working on some people. Personally, I think it was a good one but a bit obvious.
---
Mostly I can agree actually, probably because I generally hate swamp zones as well :).
---
But not with Hinterlands. It had the troll ziggurats which in my opinion were great. Easily the best made (leveling) group content in the game.
---
Also I wouldn't take this too seriously, I mean it is part personal preference, and some zones that had no quests and were void of players made for great grinding for that reason. For example I actually enjoyed grinding in azshara, leveling my skinning and getting 2 levels when available quests were running low.
---
Jokes on you my normal sleep schedule is already \~2pm-10pm PST.
---
Just hit 60 on a private server - it seems there is a real shortage of warriors specced and willing to tank, the majority are dps leather wearing specs.
---
The shortage of warriors means increased demand for feral druid tanks, and people willing to pay for tanks in dungeons.  Tanks can also reserve the first righteous orb drop in Strat runs.
---
Can someone explain this for me?
---
Scarlet Crusade NA. If it’s there thats where I’ll be.
---
Doesn't change anything of what /u/scott_himself said, because they quite clearly said what matters to them is the gameplay, and that's not affected by the look.  
---
I'm interested in playing Classic because of having to have a quiver with arrows, having to care about my pets, having to use reagents for my mage's portals and for my buff spells.  
---
I want the flint and tinder in the bags, and the chance the equip both melee and ranged weapons at the same time.  
---
I'd like to keep retail graphics, though.
---
Which is irrelevant in a thread about the hypothetical that involves changing game mechanics
---
He had wetlands WAAAY too low. The amount of wpvp, stories and adventure tied to that zone is insane. Fucking love it.
---
Because invisibility is a different mechanic as stealth. For example a warlock's succubus also has invisibility - not stealth. And yeah, you can use Shadowmeld in PvP to hide and jump (charge) on people. It can be an ok strategy when guarding flag room in WSG or a node in AB. 
---
Actual Shangsrogue here. Which rogue from Dauntless is this I wonder? In teamspeak with Nexius, Phoebus, Zekk, etc. as I type this.
---
well you have a retail mindset for leveling, in vanilla for the most part you don't go to the zone and do the whole zone in one sweep. 
---
you do some quests you can, switch zone, do some in that zone, then go to the other zone do some here, then come to first one do some and so on. 
---
But *we already had loot trading introduced back in the Wrath-era*
---
Why wouldn't you assume it would work the way it did then?
---
I still recall getting my first minor beastslayer.  It was a magical moment. 
---
&gt; 4 people roll "Need" on the weapon, and the Paladin wins the roll. He then gives you the weapon. 
---
I addressed that in my comment. You can't loot trade things that were won by a need rule. 
---
You just ignored my comment completely to respond, which doesn't make sense.
---
&gt;No, you could never trade anything that was BoP
---
That is false. We loot traded BoP drops from bosses in raids just fine, I'd even argue that was the original point of the system.
---
Go home grandpa, you're drunk
---
I carried one of those, a small pocket watch, and a few other misc grey/flavor items everywhere my rogue went, even though i really didn't have that much bag space.
---
I really should have been on an RP realm, what with all the story i made up for my character as i was fresh out of my old dnd group at the time.
---
That's an issue with the need/greed system and hybrid classes, nothing in your comment addresses loot trading.
---
The RuneScape Classic route I think isn't too bad actually. Their voting system seems pretty tough. They offer new changes through a polling system, but if the poll doesn't reach a 75% yes vote then it doesn't happen. Even if it's 74.5% it won't pass.
---
They've tried to add 3 or 4 new skills in the last 4 years and none have passed. 
---
Not too bad if you ask me. Although if Blizzard did it, I'd hope for some restrictions on who can vote possibly based on playtime in classic (because I'd suspect players on current wow, the wow forum type, to vote for the sake of ruining classic).
---
&gt; If you can’t trade need rolled items loot trading is pointless to add as it solves nothing a
---
False, keeps loot from hitting the floor by allowing greed rollers to win who can then trade it around if people realized after the fact they wanted it
---
The system was designed to stop pointless GM tickets, which is what it does
---
I'm starting to realize a lot of the bitching and moaning on this sub is from old timers like myself who completely forgot how things worked in game back in the day when implemented and are making up problems that have already been solved.
---
Hinterlands did get that nice revamp Horde side. It was more of a complete zone for them because the revamp added a series of quests for that micro dungeon that made up the southeast portion of the zone. I remember one of the best level 60 trinkets was a quest reward and it was a green (iirc it was +1% hit and 20 attack power). There wasn't much of anything for the Alliance players there though.
---
I think what annoyed me was how he constantly kept talking about the zones post Cataclysm. Felt like I read an article about a guy retelling the stories that his dad/granpda told him about the old zones.
---
Final fantasy 11
---
even over lvl 40?
---
Same here.  I want gameplay to be classic and graphics to be modern.  You’re not alone! :P
---
Alliance is better for progression, but Horde is better for farm.
---
Once you have raids on farm, Horde has the much faster speed clear potential.
---
But when progressing Alliance has the edge. It evens out in a sense but people still roll Ally for this reason.
---
Crucial is a little too strong of a word here imho
---
It seems like they hate most zones. lol
---
Just to add to this; I would say that feral druids have a higher skill and effort floor to be successful or "viable" in raids, aka what is the minimum requirement to bring the player to the raid. As a druid you need to one up the rogues every time, the pummeler and mana consumable farm is a big deal, especially if you are not in a top tier guild that kills most of the bosses in 1-2 minutes. Messing up powershifting can really drain your mana and kill your dps. I'm not saying that powershifting is rocket surgery, but it's harder than playing rogue, and rogue is also much more chill to play. As a rogue you can fairly easily just pool your energy upto 80 and not lose any dps, but as a druid you are powershifting constantly and not pressing those buttons is a big deal.
---
You dont know how much they save. Chances are it’s a lit, which a technicsl argument can show
---
As someone who actually needs Adderall to be a functioning adult don't abuse drugs. Situations like this are why certain drugs are harder to get for people that actually need them. So not only are you being inconsiderate towards your own health but the health of others as well.
---
*The alliance are evil*  
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Yeah, and you can't trust blizzard to do that
---
No, the thing about classic is that people matter, and that starts right away. Maybe not  idolation, but "being important". I'm on a very large private server and level 20 warlocks are gods among dungeon runners. Yesterday I said "we need a rogue for this dungeon". When is the last time you ever heard that? Or maybe you have the UBRS key. Or maybe you're shadowmelded along a road and you're the first chin-check new Horde get to welcome them to Ashenvale.
---
Or maybe you're known as a dude from back in your deadlines and stockade days, and you're not spec'd to heal but you're good enough, and you make the incredibly fun 2 hour dungeon possible.
---
People matter in Classic.
---
[http://i.imgur.com/1QVxr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1QVxr.jpg)
---
That map has literally the level ranges mentioned, if possible add 1-2 levels to the lowest number to get bit more done in each zone.
---
How I relate! Once someone told me about beastslaying makes your weapon glow red; I had every weapon of mine enchanted while leveling 👍
---
Fury tank does more TPS when fights are short. If the tank uses Death Wish + Mighty Rage potion + Trinkets etc, feral won't do the same TPS.
---
Also fury tanks have useful CDs like Last Stand, Lifegiving Gem, Mocking Blow, Berserker Rage. 
---
Feral druids also rely almost completely on Maul for TPS, which means when it misses/parries/dodges, they miss out on alot of threat. They also don't have much hit chance gear available early on. Warriors have more abilities, so if one of them misses, it has less effect on total TPS.
---
Bring a feral or raid without a druid, could be the sad truth, especially on the horde side.
---
'tis good that a solid 80% of 'locks are retarded, then. I've never seen them pop my totems with their pets, ever.
---
Hm maybe let the system anounce a message to all group members, that an item was traded..?
---
Best races for PvP on Alliance are Dwarf/Gnome. Dwarf can remove blind, gnome can remove roots and slows. Shadowmeld isn't comparable to them.
---
That might be true, because Vanilla has been 14 years ago. And before this, I've never played private servers. So I forgot how the leveling went in vanilla/classic.
---
Based on you reply and others that I see here it seems what I've been doing is the correct way. I wasn't sure that it was. However, I'll try a guide non the less when a good one is available. To speed it up a bit.
---
Thanks for posting this. I really hope they don't put loot trading in.
---
Any chance you share those zones?
---
Every DPS warrior should be tanking dungeons, if there isn't a tank available. All you need to tank dungeons is plate gear and a shield.
---
I prefer to tank dungeons full DPS plate gear and switching between 2h / 1h + shield actively. Sweeping strikes + whirlwind + cleave allows you to do huge cleave dps, which speeds up dungeons alot. You can always switch to shield/kite with piercing howl when you take too much dmg.
---
Yeah half of this guys analysis is talking about how much better the zones became after Cata. If I were to guess I'd say he started somewhere around MoP and garnered this list from browsing the web.
---
I'll take "Things that never happened" for 500, Alex.
---
Don't raise the level cap. Horizontal progression. Patch Progression by Zone (think AQ and Silithus). But I'll start with a controversial one.
---
Flying mounts should have a Cool down of 10mins and only be allowed riding, for a duration of 1min. 60% is the regular one and 80% is the epic one. Make Engineering have tools, that can be sold to the general public, that allows for flying mount take downs. Make it after you incur X amount of damage, while on a flying mount you dismount. Mobs should have nets like in Warcraft 3 and have ranged abilities that are used only on flying mounted players. 
---
No level cap raise. Each zone is redesigned and made as a high level 60 zone. You'd need a toss up of T2-T3 gear, and depending on your class you'd struggle or kick ass in the New Hellfire and the other zones that will be progressively released as time passes and of course each zone would be harder than the last, but with more things to discover and LOOT. Spells people. TOMES! Everquest did this by having every single spell on vendors that acted as trainers. I purpose all those crazy abilities that made hybrids possible be released in the form of Tomes that can possibly drop from Elite monsters, Dungeon bosses, and Raid Bosses. You then, bring these tomes to a specific trainer in the world; never the same one and your given a class quest to obtain &lt;insert Shammy DW here&gt; and now you're one of those hybrids that don't suck, but you had to work for it and be a healer for a portion of your characters life. 
---
This allows the developers time to design a T4 that isn't going to suck and ruin the flow of gear, loot and spell progression. Also, every Raid release doesn't have to be an increase in Tier, but an extension of it.
---
40-Man Raids should have never been removed. Hard Modes shouldn't exist and dungeons. They should be designed with their level of difficulty and that's that. Some places be hard, some easy. The Tomes, incentive to become a Ret, DW Sham, Drood Bear, Moonkin, and the partial catch up gear for main players alts and new players befriending veterans allows for some small skipping of earlier T1-2 content. However, RAID attunements ala TBC would make it players must go through old content at least once. Then you add those odd hybrid pieces that might now be in demand because LolRetguy is grinding out his Ret build. You made friends with LolRetguy because of his dedication to being a Holy Paladin, but showing off his Avenging Wrath he got with his high level friends from a strange place called Zangramarsh. LolRetguy tells you he now only needs Crusader Strike from Hellfire and he will be able to be like Arthas before he went DK.
---
Now, I'm getting a little tired, but this is an interesting topic to me.
---
Professions. Why did Alchemy get shafted the way it did? Potion stacking and figured what did and didn't work was the joy of it. The stacking of items in Inventories made bags less valuable. The Guild Banks....well other than them causing a massive influx in available individual player bag space. So yea, no guild banks. Make bank alts and buy another account for 10 more character spaces if you want that much bag space. Why do you think the sub numbers were so huge? I wouldn't be surprised the top players of yesteryear having two or three accounts. One for alts to buff their mains and an army of bank alts scattered across all 3, with one being nothing but bank alts.
---
Half of this game is discovered and played while you're running to the other half.

Thing to keep in mind with vanilla there's a lot more traveling to do than there was in current WoW to get to leveling content. My way overall wasn't the right way and I'd wager reddit silver that this was far from the most efficient way to leveling, but it worked for me. I didn't list any of the Night Elf Zones because I never leveled in Teldrassil, Darkshore, or Ashenvale (as alliance) so its hard for me to incorporate them into this grand plan. There's also a lot of fluctuation in this leveling process based on drop RNG, rested experience, and how often you want to run dungeons. Other than that, let me know if you have any questions!
---
Please be aware that Ironeye the invincible has increased magic resistance. Who can see this in the video slightly.
---
What you dont see is his armor. He is armor capped with 36,000+ armor. If a melee tries this rare they are in for a rough time. 
---
If you have a hunter just use beast lore on him to see why they call him invcinible.
---
You can literally do this right now in vanilla wow with BOE gear... How is this new or secret?
---
I don't want loot trading either,  but you guys are blowing this shit way out proportions.
---
The number of people that would go through all that trouble for some shitty MC loot is insignificant.
---
As a druid I did Team up with a shadow priest. That is such a disgusting combo, especially the shadow does damage while he heals you and you do damage while you tank.
---
And when he is oom he gets the innervate. 
---
And of course rogue. As a druid you can do all kind of things with a rogue. 
---
Why would you do it with ANY BoE gear worthwhile? Just sell it on AH if you win the roll.
---
BoE gear is a completely different situation lol
---
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
---
&gt;That was totally fine because the Badlands sucked. It was like Durotar: Part Two with more scorpions.
---
Badlands had zero scorpions though. Good start.
---
It's about gold, not loot - and gold is REALLY valuable in Vanilla.
---
If you actually played vanilla that statement is obviously true. Vanilla and even TBC required you to cc ads. You couldn’t just mow your way through dungeons like you can now.
---
Durotar has infinitely more scorpions than Badlands, given that Badlands has zero of them.
---
If you have a priest and a warrior for a dungeon you know you can at least hobble through no matter what.
---
Lol did you use one of those insult generators for that? Hahaha
---
Feral beats casters in MC/BWL? Maybe if they are wanding. Just maybe.
---
Liar.
---
"Why is every other class rolling on *my* gear?
---
What suggestions do you have for AOE tanking? Rotation, primarily. 
---
Most people in this world aren’t you.
---
I'm rolling a druid in classic, and considering playing feral. Would you mind linking your spec?
---
Yeah and people are not going to pay HUNDREDS of gold for some shitty MC loot. 
---
Most people will have less than 50g on them at any given time.
---
Pretend you dont have an item, unequip it. then roll need on it, and then say actually, you could give it away for some gold. ez money and ppl will think you are generous.
---
Some MC and Ony loot are bis until AQ or Naxx (sometimes even forever).
---
Especially the rings, they are rare, good and every class need them and can need on them. 
---
Onyxia head is also a good target.
---
Ok - if that is your issue, then you miss the point entirely.
---
This sounds like a great and useful idea. Keep it up and share what you find. Notable item drops/rewards will probably make the difference in some cases.
---
I mean... The relevant thing is what you'll actually be fighting.
---
Quite torn on the choice. I started during tbc (stayed until cata heroic nerfs) and done quite extensive research (but, frankly, it has made it worse...). 
---
At the time my most played and enjoyed classes were:  druid (feral cat and bear -can't get used to *guardian-* even though I raided mostly as resto due to guild convenience, ended up hating it and honestly it has drawn me out of playing druid altogether) , shaman (split between ele and enh, resto wasn't my cup of tea at all) and paladin (tbc shockadin only but hell, it was such a blast). 
---
My overall playstyle is mostly on the utility side (buff, debuff, CC), but honestly I don't like healing. I'm open to it occasionally but for guild's sake, not mine (I just find it tedious, unrewarding and unengaging especially PvE-wise).  Full-time healing is a no-go. Melee hybrids are usually my choice (I just enjoy the concept of smacking with your weapon AND weaving some spells as well ) but the thing hybrids are expected to is mostly healing...  quite the one thing I want to avoid.  Being durable is nice (either by cds or raw EHP).
---
I have a higher focus on PvP (love wPvP, bg are fun as well) but PvE is interesting as well. I don't mind pressure or having the key role  (such as kiting *X* boss, having to react to *Y* boss mechanic -for a cleanse/cc/whatever- or being the actual tank, a role I enjoy). Competition is fine up to an extent (for raiding slots is fine, for gear I'm a bit more picky).
---
Have tried multiple classes until 30 or so to get some taste (limited, I know).
---
By the time I've just discarded 3 classes:  shaman (PvE resto-only, hell no, also: For the Alliance!), mage (even if they're so good, they're not my cup of tea) and priest (I don't mind shadow, taking it out it ends up as a full time healer -haven't seen smite priests for now-). Profession-wise it's somewhat decided: engineering (quite an easy choice for a PvPer, isn't it?) and another one depending on class, like tailoring for a caster (bloodvine).
---
To end up my concerns per class are: 
---
* Druid: PvP from my research feels rather poor. Vulnerable to burst, minimal damage so just a tough and mobile nuisance focused on outlasting (can't kill -since reinforcements will show earlier- but hard to kill as well). Is it right? Can be tweaked for some more offense?
---
* Warrior: Again PvP concerns. PvE is nice. I'm quite a lone wolf so the team-dependence (well, more like cleanse/heal dependence) is a concern.  Up to which extent solo PvP is manageable? Can it be improved somehow?
---
* Paladin: Before the research my go-to choice since it suits my playstyle well. But holy being the *only* one choice for any group content is a bummer.  It's literally the one choice I *don't want*. Have seen quite a bit of hostility against ret/prot. The lack of proper gear only makes it worse. Still doubt about whether rolling it or not. 
---
* Lock: WotF and shamans. Quite annoying for wPvP and guess it makes you too reliant on engineering/team support.
---
* Hunter: Annoying stigma (I'm used to them but still...) but honestly my main concern is how hard they get outscaled in PvP, how manageable is AQ/Naxx level geared PvP (for the long run). PvE is alright due to perks (kiting bosses/adds, trapping them, tranq, nice rotation, etc. Quite a fun variety from the "spam Xbolt" casters have, quite the challenge I like :P).  Arguably the leading choice post-research but still unsure.  My test until lvl 32 as BM felt a bit lacking in feel. I presume later on with stuff like scatter and proper PvP talenting/macroing might get better. 
---
* Rogue: My big concern is how weapon reliant they are and the brutal competition there'll be for them. Warriors at least have it better for their PvP 2H ones. Not a class I dislike but certainly it is my last resort. 
---
That is a great answer thanks! My priest is currently level 33 So I'll try to follow it from there. Shimmering flats. Completely forgot about that. See how it goes and feels. But it looks really solid. Thanks.
---
Common Boe trashs items are sold for about 100g on ah on pservers, you can expect a lot more for valuable Bop items.
---
I've heard that suggestions before, and I do like it. In addition I think the time limit should be shortser, like 10 min max. If the loot trading is there to fix misplaced loot, 10 mins should be more than enough. 
---
To be fair he's talking about a WotLK pserver, since that's when they first implemented it. It's not 100's of gold for MC loot, it's WotLK onyxia and toc, where there was far more gold inflation; 50g in vanilla is probably pretty equivalent to 200-300g in WotLK
---
How is "ninja rolling" different from "loot trading" except loot trading works with BoP too?
---
They are not.
---
People want resto shamans because ele can't sustain its DPS and nature ddoesn't synergize well with frost / shadow / fire debuffs on bosses -- and enhance is barely any better than ret but can't heal due to even worse mana problems.
---
At best, you'll see elemental resto shamans in a pvp build healing as mana tide when you're in a full melee / attack group is optional.
---
I hope this catches on 
---
Here's your most basic answer:
---
Are you playing in a progression raid, and/or a hardcore guild?
---
You, potentially, will not have a slot. Some raids may bring you for Nightfall and to give Fury warriors windfury totem, however that is likely the extent of things. Due to the nature of windfury and limited debuff slots, shamans aren't allowed to utilize their ability that would give them additional DPS. Even with it, however, it wouldn't be comparable to others.
---
Are you in a more down to earth, medium level guild?
---
You'll likely find a slot. However, it would still likely be best as carrying Nightfall and benefiting your raid.
---
Are you in a casual guild and everyone just wants to have fun?
---
Well, then who cares! Go have fun!
---
Ultimately the class falls short due to itemization and a lack of access to it's own powers through the debuff limit. 
---
wat? its not for items its for gold. 
---
you can bargain the price that would suit both parties. if mc loot is shitty for you, it will just be sold for less price that suit your demand. thats all.
---
Rare harder to obtain, more significant character defining items would be sold for more, thats all.
---
Would you buy a T1 shoulders RIGHT NOW for some gold, or wait like month or two for it to drop and win the roll? its obvious pretty much everyone would buy it, if the price is suitable.
---
Ppl forget how valuable, rare and status gear was. remeber no transmog? remeber 2-3 items for 40 ppl? remeber how valuable and useful haveing gold was in vanilla? you need item with like 15% chance to drop first and then win against like 6 other ppl. lul. 
---
That may be true, but that other player will do the same back to you. I would. And do it twice just to be sure.
---
well that is not the reality on the private server I play on.
---
You do realize that pservers have completely fucked up economy due to all the gold buyers? Anything that's worth a damn is going to be extremely overpriced.
---
Nobody did and it was great &lt;3
---
Or get called out for being an ass.      
---
"On second thought, i dont really need the item that bad, it's far more of an upgrade for you, give me money and i'll give you the item."
---
      
---
They don't even do this shit on retail, what happened to the nice and kind "community" everyone spoke so highly about?
---
&gt; Not all of those people will be interested in downloading addons just to 'fix' their experience,
---
If something looks and feels wrong, and you aren't even going to give a google search a try to fix your problem. Then I honestly don't think you aren't that interested to begin with.
---
People playing on private servers are capable of downloading and getting addons. People that haven't played since Vanilla, surely will check a forum or do one google search to see if they can fix their issue.
---
This is such an nitpicking non-issue compared to other concerns.
---
Soo much traveling compared to horde, ouch.
---
Holy shit yes. My best friend was an undead mage and he bought a "Crescent staff of the something" off of the ah, and it had a cool ass red glow between the crescent, what!! I had to find out how to get it myself
---
Farming Hoj would be "fun". But yea loot trading not a big deal and won't really affect vanilla that much, you guys just blow it all out of proportion. Kappa 
---
I play on vanilla pservers too, random boe mc trashs item are sold for more than 100g on ah. Valuable bop items could be sold for a lot more with loot trading.
---
Bop items are Bop for a reason. They were not meant to be sold.
---
I don't get the Durotar hate. Peon slapping, first discovering the shortcut to Ratchet, Sen'jin Village &amp; the Zalazane questline, grouping up in Tirisgarde Keep, killing that Goblin in the Thunder Lizard ravine. So many awesome moments.
---
Yeah, its because most warriors don't know what they are doing
---
A small tldr: yes you can raid especially if a guild is willing to help you get nightfall or you already have it. (Will never be a top tier guild but that's ok)
---
What this looks like. To be the best you can be you will need alot of consumes, melee and caster ones. I would recommend a Mana flask, your talent setup will be 21/30/0 for maximum dps. However going into the resto tree for hit is certainly an option. 
---
Basic rotation is dependent on fight duration, this is the difference of down ranking shocks or not. If it's a long fight you need to downrank shocks to fish for a clear casting proc in order to throw out a Max rank shock. Aside from that it's your standard auto attack and pray for WF. Because you are a very RNG heavy spec.
---
In early game you will not likely be allowed to stormstrike as the debuff slot is something your RL will be very upset with you taking up.
---
I different story here. Not actually the first time I was able to play but the first time I saw the game.
---
In my first year of college, I use to go to an gaming cafe (they are all closed now). I was looking at their game library when I spotted that "World of Warcraft" game. I tried to boot start it but I couldn't pass the login screen. I spoke to the employee to get more info about it and he told me he couldn't give me an account info. I was out of time anyway so I went back to the college for the next class. Back home, I did some research, the game was still in beta so I got a beta key. I didn't know at that time that WoW would become my most played game by such a huge margin that I don't think any other game will beat it.
---
The difference is that you have no way of making that kind of gold ofc
---
Lol I was the guy people asked. Enchanting hunter with +Beast (red) and +Dmg (blue) made good money just by walking around with my dual glowing swords :)
---
best use for shadow melt is to eat, waiting for someone to get in charge range is probably not the best use of your time.
---
This is true but I've seen people bringing enhance shamans with nightfall on private servers to raids so I'm expecting there will be some spots for them especially if you're in a guild with friends or people you know or who aren't hardcore 
---
demo shout, sunder TAb, sunder TAB, repeat
---
Yep, Rune Of The Guard Captain is the trinket you're thinking of. Woven ivy necklace was also a great quest reward from those troll quests, lasted a lot of warriors until 60 or the mark or Fordring
---
I absolutely dislike Activision and what it stands for, but why are you guys acting like Blizzard is somehow taken hostage by Activision? Blizzard is still Blizzard and should absolutely be held accountable for its decisions. 
---
To answer your question they do even less damage than feral druids, shadow priests and ret paladins. They are bottom of the barrel meme spec. 
---
[It did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/acgb9k/activision_elemental_monster/)
---
You forgot the final step - getting caught while pulling off this thing either on an official or community armory (like legacyplayers.com) and getting blacklisted by the whole server. 
---
My guild did all of these thing on wotlk retail. Idk how it evolved after that since i stopped playing on retail with cata.
---
This post is toxic. People that do this are toxic. 
---
Also would not work. Not for long anyway. In vanilla/classic reputation is everything. So after a while people would know in advance. You won't be invited to raids or dungeon runs.  And you'd be all alone with your 500G's in your bags. Have fun playing the game alone.
---
You explain this topic with good overview. Great video, I hope we see more of you :)
---
Defending loot trading is just stupid.  It wasn't in the game so it shouldn't be.  Literally the only reason they are including it is to save money on GMs and to me that means they're willing to compromise the experience to save money and I'm not convinced they won't do the same in other aspects we don't know about yet 
---
It's the new year. When are the Weekly Guild Recruitment posts coming?
---
I'm aware, and I think 75% of groups use that method. At least on private servers. 
---
Even in a casual guild environment the amount of enhancement shamans they take is very limited (usually just 1).
---
And you are probably (more like surely) not going to be the only one  competing for a spot in an average (at best) guild. 
---
That's sad, but you definitely got a point... 
---
Why do people keep repeating the "if you're in a casual guild you'll have no problems finding a raid slot as enhance shaman (or any other meme spec" answer? 
---
That can only be true if the guild doesn't care about progression at all. So just fighting bosses for the sake of fighting bosses with no intention of actually clearing raids in a reasonable amount of time (even by casual standards). In my experience even casual guilds want to kill the final boss some time that's not in the far away future. 
---
Meme specs are usually only taken along because other players make up for their significant DPS deficit. They need to be carried. And in casual guilds, the players will usually perform worse than in semi-hardcore or hardcore guilds. That's not an insult, it's just the natural result of taking a casual approach instead of a tryhard approach. And with that lower performance casual guilds will have much less capacity to actually carry dead weight. 
---
I literally made a point to mention a section regarding progression, which included the answer that you will likely not have a slot. 
---
My "Casual" section also included "If everyone just wants to have fun".
---
I specified all the things you're complaining about people not doing. 
---
Nah 10/25 ruins the immersion and is the same problem as lfr: you end up with a meaningless tourist mode that detracts from the first time experience in the “real” raid
---
Sounds a lot more profitable to just farm gold.  Half the time you're just getting nexus crystals because proper humans like myself wouldn't buy loot.
---
CRATER HELLO?
---
You really think people will bother to check the armory of everyone rolling on loot ? 
---
Please be aware that Ironeye the invincible has increased magic resistance. You can see this in the video slightly.
---
What you dont see is his armor. He is armor capped with 36,000+ armor. If a melee tries this rare they are in for a rough time.
---
If you think "everyone just wants to have fun" is equal to "everybody is completely fine with not clearing any raid in the foreseeable future" then I guess you're right. 
---
They fixed this in bfa, they are back to wotlk levels or so.
---
That works fine for a few mobs in lower hitting tiers. Let’s say it’s 5 hard hitting mobs. 
---
And how do you know this is happening when everything is happening behind the scene ? 
---
True, and while they do make a lot of bad decisions that tend to stem from trying to please everyone, it’s easy to see that there does seem to be time, money and effort restraints put on the dev team. 
---
Some people genuinely don't give a shit, as this sub proves every single day by people making posts like these and other things like ret paladins and tanking shamans.
---
Guess what isn't anyones job? To tell them how to have fun. It's a video game, and they're entitled to play it how they like. I'm sure enough people who don't care will naturally gravitate towards one another and end up doing whatever wacky nonsense they want.
---
You've already drawn your own conclusion before asking the question and just looking for affirmation.
---
Here, I'll lay it out bluntly, enhance shamans, ret, and other "meme specs" are terrible class specs in a pve raid environment and are a detriment to the raid when compared 1:1 to any other class spec that can provide a better role to the raid.  Also, there are mechanical problems that hold back enh shamans as well such as storm strike overwriting some far more useful debuff slots on bosses and earth shock generating a metric fuckton of threat. Your main two sources of damage are out of the question. Further, you have no inherent melee abilities aside a 31 point talent on a 20 second cool down. In a situation where you need high sustainable damage, the enhance shaman is literally the opposite. 
---
As you said, only super casual guild raids would take an enhance shaman, and that's still preferably just to fill up 40 people to be able to do content. Any casual raider having to somehow make up and over come the massive DPs and healing loss "meme" specs provide to a raid will only make the guild progress slower or hit a very early content wall because the performance of the raid just isn't there.
---
On the prowl.
---
Genuinely curious, as someone who has yet to see the end-game in classic...
---
I also love druids but I know they're generally weaker than the other classes in end-game. I love feral and I also heard they were bad dps in end-game... However I thought that the "hybrid tax" was more than worth it. Battle rez, buffs, a little bit of cc, possibility of side heals and side tank... Doesn't it make the feral a good asset for an end-game vanilla raid group, even if he has lower dps than the others?
---
ouch
---
&gt; I've seen people bringing enhance shamans with nightfall on private servers to raids
---
No competent guild is using one though. I’ve seen 1-2 in MC/BWL but none in AQ40 or Naxx when the content gets harder. 
---
It made me into an Enchanter.
---
Then it was my turn to create wonders for newbies when they walked past me.
---
It was funny because some people thought I tried to scam them when I told them to place their weapon in the trade window, when all I wanted to do was to give their weapon a cool glow.
---
Well, since anyone who doesn't see the majority of players as evil ninjalooters knows that loot trading abuse will be an absolute rarity, the doomsayers are now sharing loot trading abuse guides to make their claim a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
---
Doesn't get any more absurd. 
---
The problem with Blizzard taking the runescape route is that truly new content would need new artwork, new items, new balancing, etc.
---
What I was trying to say is that I don’t think Blizzard is going to dump significant funding into the development of “new” Classic content, so even if they did follow the voting system OSRS uses (I think OSRS is a fantastic game and a wonderful experience fwiw), I’m not sure it’s reasonable to expect anything more than BFA-Level quality from any new content Blizzard designs
---
I think it would be the best-case scenario. Filling the current map instead of adding maps and splitting the players... I don't they Blizz can do that without ruining everything though.
---
People struggle with the idea that sometimes good games are simply good regardless of when it came out. I still regularly go back and play Super Metroid and OoT and they’re some of the best games ever released imo.
---
The damage number popups is one of the few things you can't really change with addons. You can change the font, but the text will still scale and become smaller with distance etc which is not how it worked in vanilla.
---
To me life stealing enchant was part of the Vanilla experience. Purple &gt; Red.
---
I second your comment, people spend lot of money to buy some trashy MC loot on Pserver
---
Source?
---
It's very similar to furry warrior pre-bis except for a few differences.
---
1. Paladins get +3 hit from talents which warriors don't so they don't need to get 9% hit from gear like warriors. Depending on how weapon skill works in classic if you are human you will only need 3-6 hit on your gear.
---
2. Paladins value crit more than raw AP because it procs vengeance which increases all dmg by 15%. The goal is to have this up at all times basically. 
---
What does this mean though in terms of actual gear difference between warrior and paladin? You probably don't need devilsaur because you won't need the extra hit and instead of using 2 rings with +1 hit (usually mara and dmn ring) you can swap for rings that give you +crit instead (brd quest and ubrs drop). 
---
Sure, it's completely fine to not give a shit. All I'm saying is I think you're vastly overestimating the amount of players who think that way. 
---
Even amongst casual guilds those that are THAT casual will be quite a rarity imho. And that's why I think meme spec raiders will still have trouble finding raid slots, even if such guilds might exists. 
---
That's exactly what I was thinking... except I liked TBC but I guess it's mostly because I never got to know the end-game of classic.  I doubt they can do that, but it would be great.
---
YES! So happy to see the Barrens number 1.  It's my all time favorite questing area.  In the beginning when I was such a noob I would constantly be rerolling characters and taking them through the Barrens.  I knew the area so well, I prided myself in being able to hit lvl 16 in one sitting.
---
&gt; I was hoping the whole game would have more effects. Looking back im 50/50 on the matter.
---
That's the thing. Once every weapon has it and you don't have to go out of your way for it, it loses its magic right?
---
This is a really nicely played joke that actually brings insight into the discussion. Kudos :-)
---
So, "viability" is clearly not just a matter of whether the content _can_ be cleared with one member of the group playing a meme spec. We can, however, make a quantifiable determination of the viability of a given DPS spec:
---
* Calculate your meme spec's total DPS contribution (so count e.g. Moonkin Aura's effect on the rest of your group).
---
* Assuming a raid group comp with 20 DPS players, does that total DPS contribution add up to 1/20th of what's necessary to defeat every raid boss you're currently progressing on?
---
* If the DPS contribution is _not_ quite up there, does the unique utility (e.g. combat res) offset the deficit sufficiently in the eyes of your raid group, who are all impacted if the viability of the _raid group_ is compromised?
---
For a spec to be "viable" it means the spec has to "pull its weight," but only relative to what the encounter requires, not the amount of weight one's peers are pulling. Once people comprehend this, the case for casual or semi-hardcore guilds to allow well-prepared hybrid DPS specs becomes obvious.
---
Congratulations on your new position @ activision.
---
Is this THE North, mentioned in several Mage guides? :D
---
Thank you for your work,if so, from an aspiring Classic Mage!
---
thanks you for the honourable mention
---
All 40? And here I only did my top 5.  
---

---
If loot trading exploiting becomes a problem then yes. 
---
It is enough for a few people to get caught post factum and get publicly shamed to keep the majority away from doing such tricks. 
---
Moreover, there are serious implications that the following scheme is falling under "Exploiting other players" paragraph in Blizzard's Code of Conduct with respective consequences.
---
My guild did something similar to this all the time back in WotLK. We developed the reputation for doing this too. What saved us was that we were compromised entirely of high school friends so we never needed to rely on others for anything if we didn’t want to. 
---
People would get suspicious if a five-man was compromised of two or three of us or a pug had a few of us in it. But nobody could or would say anything because if we left it usually became hard to fill out the group. 
---
In the end, I was ICC 25-man geared and had over 200k bank. 
---
it is, and it's really encouraging to see people recognize some of my stuff, so thank you.
---
Best of luck and I hope to have videos of my own out soon so I won't just be featured :)
---
That sounds like 'mstake' to me.
---
Also, the hell is Mulgore doing so high up in this list? &gt;\_&gt;
---
How is selling an item abuse 🤦‍♂️
---
Nope. Shaman dps is completely unworkable in raids. You have practically no sustainability at all. Even with nightfall there are better picks, usually off-tanks. At your best you will barely keep up with tanks in fights lasting more than a minute or two, at your worst you will get a windfury crit early in the fight pull aggro and die. 
---
However not all is lost for enhancment. when it comes to pvp it's really in my opinion one of the most fun class/talent combos. You'll be very useful with your offensive dispells, totems, caster counter and great burst. If PvP is not your thing i would suggest staying far away from enhancement
---
Zug zug!
---
The OP even admits to doing this shit in the past, so you're spot on lol
---
Blizzard's autonomy has been eroding for years
---
Pala buff?
---
I saw this guy running from the town of Goldshire up this long road to a castle in the distance. He had cats running after him. But he wasn't a hunter!
---
I need to see this guy closer... run after him. ...wow this caslte looks big....MUSIC STARTS... holy shit... there's soldiers. they're all ??? to me. 
---
MY GOD THERES DOZENS OF PEOPLE HERE. 
---
For the first 2 hours I thought Goldshire was the hub of WoW, like a lobby in Diablo 2. 
---
"I once wandered behind the river into some dark forest, but got falgged for "PVP combat", which I was afraid of, so I returned to Elwynn and waited that 5 minutes."
---
This. So much me aswell.
---
'Drage' literally means 'dragon' in the norwegian language. His character name is Drage, and based on his Youtube name he is from Norway.
---
How do you 'tank' in classic with reference to just getting aggro? 
---
I imagine its quite stressful needing to work on each mob individually and also watch for the stupid rogue not to over aggro? 
---
Video description: "Just some random pvp clips on Retro Wow."
---
e.g. How can he say that Felwood is empty and pointless? I’ve spent a huge amount of time there. Great for farming runes, felcloth, runecloth, essence of water, herbs and mithril/thorium.
---
Not to mention the unique felwood herbs and songflower buff, the timbermaw rep farm, and all the subsequent pvp that comes from this much activity! 
---
*shakes fist* 
---
&gt;  play for free if you are subbed to regular wow. 
---
....literally what's happening? lol
---
It shows why it may not work as you think it will, because if hard rules are put into play that don't match what the playerbase wants (or is flexible enough for the meme builds), then it's going to make it even harder to ensure that players get the right loot.
---
Without the loot trading system, players move on and there's less drama with it - although the memes may still cause issues (like a BOOMKIN rolling against the cloth casters).
---
+15 agi so hawt
---
That's why I rolled on Bronzebeard in 2004. RIP Muradin.
---
Make it 15min
---
*raises hand* me, me, me!
---
You haven't played a big name pserver in the last few years then.
---
Azshara used to convey a sense of mystery to the game that has no equivalent post Cata. Prime example of how over streamlining made this game worse, not better.
---
When I was Alliance I used to do some very suboptimal gold farming there just for the sake of being in a remote area.
---
I don't disagree with you that they're gonna have a hard time.
---
All we appear to disagree on is the amount of people who give a shit versus those that don't. 
---
I, personally, think meme specs serve zero purpose and will likely not be involved in anything I choose to interact with. However, from personal and entirely anecdotal experience, most people I know could care less about trying to be hardcore and just wanna do their own thing.
---
My point is that's, for them, fine and they are welcome to ally with those that agree.
---
I think Blizzard funding Classic content could happen and I think it would purely be based on whether it does better than the main game. 
---
While yes, Blizzard developing new content, new artwork, new items, new balance; it would be an issue. Especially based on their current work. However, that's where the voting system would come in. 
---
And I would hope that if new content came to classic it would be classic level design. For example, I don't want to see George Lucas CGI in a movie full of puppets (in Classic). If that makes sense.
---
So, as a tank in a Dungeon it isn't your job to worry about how hard a mob hits. It is your job to keep threat. No matter if a mob hits hard or soft you would charge, TC, Switch to def stance, sunder tab and so on. You'd deal with groups that hit too hard by having some CC rather than changing how you tank. Shield block etc will mitigate alot of damage etc if needed. Most of the job in dungeons is just keeping aggro while the dps does their thing. 
---
Plus the Burning Blade questline for RFC. Lots of cool stuff. 
---
No I'm not looking for affirmation.  I know how shit enhance are believe me I played one, I'm just saying that in my observation they did get some raid spots.  And as I said it will be dependent on how casual or hardcore your guild is.  It's not a safe bet to roll one by any means 
---
I like undead and orc, but am more partial to undead tbh.  Is the weapon skill enough to justify orc for dps and potential tanking at end game?  I've read that as you progress, you get more rage which means less white hits anyways, plus swords tend to be slightly better than axes tier by tier anyways, and then throw some world buffs on top of that, and use edgemasters regardless.  1-2% difference = meh, but 10%+ might sway me.
---
Rushing in vanilla? it's not what you think
---
Basically the same as ret paladin, one in a raid with nightfall is good. Although I'd say enhance shaman is more desirable than ret paladin because the totems are generally better than the auras.
---
True that. I had some difficulty on a PS earlier today tanking Majordomo. I was doing the suggested actions, but still unable to keep aggro. Part of the problem might have been my lack of AOE gear? I did not have thorns, shield spike, things of that nature. 
---
So, you were tanking him while they killed off his adds and when they came around to kill him you lost aggro? 
---
Duskwood was always my fav. First time killing Morbent Fel in that house was so good.
---
lmao by the end of the expansion we will be in the millions again
---
after the stat squish my character hat 190-something gs now theres already 390 gear and theres still 2 more raids to come
---
\&gt;Can't wait for the whole unexplored world in classic
---
\&gt;watches guides on every small facet of the game
---
Their stock has dropped to half.  It certainly hasn't grown in power.
---
On RetroWoW everything is scaled to a 5 man. So I was tanking Majordomo and the 4 adds. 
---
My first memories of Vanilla wow were of Walking around SW getting lost, and doing that extremly long delivery quest that starts in Goldshire and takes you to Loch Mordan. I had soo much fun traveling the world back then trying the find where I need to go next. 
---
People are going to figure out you're a ninja one way or the other, and they will put you on a blacklist.
---
Talking horde perspective RFK is a very good dungeon for warriors. It drops Corpsemaker and Tusken helm. After that you’ll get WW axe if you are lucky finding help. It’ll last you for a long time. Then I’d recommend Ice Barbed Spear if you like to do some AV for it.
---
This is what I did: get 1h maces from WC&gt; Get Corpsemaker&gt; Get WW axe/Sword of omen-Vanquiser sword&gt; Get Ice Barbed Spear. I never got a better weapon after.. I swapped to MS spec after getting ice barbed spear.
---
I would give dual wield a chance since it is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It’s all about the better option. Sometimes you get sick one handed weapons and it’s all fine to use em.
---
Ok, so Domo in normal has a function where he teleports the closest person to him (usually) and then runs off into the raid. So I'd guess that you were losing aggro on domo because of his function to drop aggro. He is tauntable. Sounds like the fight is tuned badly or you're not familiar with its function.
---
What about good old fashioned coffee? Does nobody drink coffee anymore?
---
&gt; I addressed that in my comment. You can't loot trade things that were won by a need rule.
---
Yes you can/could. I did it all the time since I was a Mage and my friend a Priest. A ring would drop, I'd roll Need just to spite him and then trade it to him afterward. The point was to let players resolve their own conflicts and reduce ticket volume. 
---
&gt; You just ignored my comment completely to respond, which doesn't make sense.
---
No, I responded to your comment and explained why people don't want loot trading because of how it can be abused. 
---
&gt; That is false. We loot traded BoP drops from bosses in raids just fine
---
You absolutely 100% did no such thing. Back in **vanilla** you could not trade items that were soulbound. Ever. Except through GM intervention (such as cases where the Master Looter gave an item to the wrong person). This was one of the reasons why Blizzard created the option to trade loot to party members **in Wrath**.
---
You're high. Stop talking.
---
Its alot of tabbing and you have to have your dps understand the priority of kills and understand that threat takes time. The good part of classic is that you will tend to run with the same people since its just one server full of people. Also, opening with charge/thunderclap/demoshout helps ALOT on the the start. 
---
I’d lose aggro on at least one mob before the teleport. I think I may just need more practice. I played a Warrior as an alt for ZG and AQ20 at the end of Retail Vanilla, and I’m trying to relearn the class and learn all those nuances that I didn’t pick up last time. 
---
They are about on par with feral druids.
---
Very fair. I think the best way to tell what the future holds is to see the state of Classic at launch, no?
---
Have you ever just tried to enjoy a joke?
---
Like ever?
---
I am talking about classes in general,it is obvious that every player has different skills lol
---
That's sad.
---
Then pls ignore me.
---
And that's how the chaos and fun starts XD

Our feral does really good. But he also probably puts in twice the amount of work for farming consumes and stuff.
---
The author of this article is an idiot. Half my favorite zones we're outside the top 20
---
I remember having huge tank lists and a raid leader on that list. He would tell people "target my target" for CCs/tank assignments.  
---
It's not like word won't get out if he rolls PvP though. Won't streamers get ganked endlessly?
---
What's he supposed to do after hitting level 12?
---
You should probably at least even make an attempt to look at the guide you're telling someone else to look at before commenting about it.
---
HOW U WEPS GLOW?
---
The +5 weapon skill is very very significant. Consider Edgemasters are +7 weapon skill and zero other stats and are considered pretty much on par with the dps gloves from Cthun, as an idea of how much weaponskill helps, and that's for both threat and dps.
---
However, it's dependant on an axe. If you're looking to MT for a raidgroup and legitimately feel you'll get a Thunderfury then your orc skill is pointless, and yes, most good tank weapons are Swords. But there are still some nice axes out there - Crul Shorokh is great, and the warrior tank weapon from AQ40 quest parts is an axe. 
---
However, for Orcs their racial active is also a big part of their power. You wont use it tanking much but it's a fantastic dps cooldown. Combo that with axes and the difference between orc and undead is pretty noticeable in dps output.
---
Undead sadly are the worst warrior of all four races for both dps and tanking. Your one advantage is fear breaking which warriors can already do. If you're partial to one, take it, but unfortunately any theorycrafting will always say go Troll for threat/tanking, Tauren for survivability/tanking and Orc for threat/dps provided you stick to axes.
---
Personally though i say go Undead anyway. If you're dedicated to your craft the racials wont make as much of a difference as just having a character you want to stick with.
---
PVE servers are a thing.
---
Imagine just making shit up to hide the fact that you're a buffoon who can't organize their thoughts in a coherent sentence on reddit.
---
Not even close. Feral dps is the best or second hybrid dps in the game, shadow priest generally do slightly worse dps wise but they bring better utlilty. The problem with feral is that you're just playing a worse rogue.
---
Feral DPS is okay.
---
Optimally only 1 per raid up until AQ/Naxx.
---
Feral DPS really goes crazy in kara in TBC.
---
What most people wont't tell you though is how unbearable it is to play ( pun intended )
---
Powershifting is the pinnicle of try harding with how much button mashing is necessary with perfect timing. You hands will hurt, spirit will be crushed, and you won't be able to out dps a mage hitting 1 button every 2 seconds.
---
But if you succeed in this you will be renown server wide as the feral druid who has that sweet melee dps gear.
---
Finally someone else who realizes the /sit crit shit won't work.
---
I think that the point here is that why is it better to have to actively opt out of something that wasn't in standard vanilla?
---
A better solution would be that if somebody wants those BFA numbers, then THEY should go out of their way to download a font AddOn for it. 
---
It's a minor thing but it's one of those opt-in / opt-out of systems which are actually quite important when it comes to a variety of products.
---
If by "marginally" faster, you mean literally months before the average player playing 2-3 hours a day...
---
Comparision way out of proportion. 
---
Oh look it's this thread again Zzz...
---
I have a naxx-geared enh shaman on a pserver.  Even with absurd gear there are severe problems in PVE: 
---
Stormstrike is a long cooldown and overwrites other important buffs if you're at the limit.  
---
Earth shock causes huge threat and also doesn't get the benefit from Stormstrike. 
---
Stormstrike has a long CD, so in a boss fight you're basically just hoping for wf crits, stormstrike every 20 sec (or maybe not due to debuffs), and totem twisting. 
---
If you gear for strictly white damage, you will go OOM just from stormstrike, earth shock on cooldown, and totem twisting in a laughably small amount of time. 
---
Due to how WF works, if you get an "unlucky" wf proc and crits early in the fight you WILL pull aggro.  
---
I've played around with gear options, and different kinds of specs.  Enh PVE in raids is really just a VERY tricky thing to make work.  I would put them a tier below the other meme specs like Ret pal, spriest, balance druid, etc in terms of raid PVE.  They are that tough to be effective.  
---
PVP is a different story, top tier gear with an enh shaman is a lol fest.  You are extremely deadly to cloth wearers, druids, and rogues but just as vulnerable to CC and kiting.  Also, in a 1v1 an equally geared rogue will CRUSH you unless you have PVP trinket / tidal charm/ other random stuff or if you get very lucky with wf proc/crit on the one or two chances you have to hit the rogue.  
---
Now all that being said, in a 5 or 10 man group an enh shaman can be an asset and a fun class to play.  Easily sustained "ok" DPS, backup heals, great group utility with totems, wipe recovery... There are tons of ways an enh shaman is helpful in these scenarios.  But in 25 or 40 mans.. yeah, it falls off a cliff.  You're better off just throwing on all heal gear
---
And STVietnam is called STVietnam ;-)
---
The post is toxic.  Because loot trading is toxic.
---
I'll definitely try it, but if they will fuck it up somehow I'm done with buying their games.
---
&gt; Back in vanilla you could not trade items that were soulbound.
---
What an idiot, I didn't say back in vanilla now did I? I'm clearly talking about WHEN IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN GAME
---
We're done here troll
---
And it's great for questing.
---
I don't understand the point of doubling down when you just misunderstood it. Even with context, you're belligerent. 
---
Hope your day improves, and stay in school.
---
My concern is them using classic numbers to artificially prop up retail. I want retail to be good too. Hell, I would still be playing now if the whole situation didn’t stink of Activision’s greed. 
---
But that is not what it said.. I menty the changes after the AQ patch
---
Isn't that the truth?
---
"Patch notes: fixed a bug, keyword: fun"
---
It's the quest line that allows you to fight the Avatar of Hakkar in Sunken Temple, among other things.
---
Nightfall debuff and totem twisting are mechanics that make 1 or possibly 2 enhancement shamans viable. While they are less optimal than hunters for applying the nightfall debuff, only they can apply the debuff while also boosting melee DPS with totem twisting and strength of earth.
---
I've seen numbers to suggest they are certainly viable, though rarely optimal.
---
Watch as this sub defends it though.
---
Have fun running a dungeon and having your loot be given to friends of a friend 
---
This is talking about loot trading.  In Vanilla and TBC, any item that was BOP was bound to whoever looted it.  So if an item drops off a boss and I don't need it, I roll "greed", because at best I can get a couple gold out of it, but someone who needs it for an upgrade could roll "need".
---
Now, I could roll "need" and then vendor it, but that would be a huge price to pay in my reputation just to have a 50/50 shot at vendoring an item.
---
Loot trading was added in WotLK, where you had up to 2 hours to trade a BOP item to anyone else who was eligible to loot it.  This was put in so people could more easily fix mistakes (i.e. Master Loot went to the wrong person, accidentally clicked Need if you didn't need it, or greed if you did, or if you got another upgrade that was better for you, etc).  It was good for guild runs and for complete PUG groups, but was massively abused by guild groups.
---
Where abuse comes into what the OP is saying is that he would purposefully wear worse gear than he had.  So let's say he's in full T2, and joins a Scholomance run.  He would put on 60 greens and questing blues so it looks like he's undergeared, and roll need on anything that's an upgrade from what he's wearing in the dungeon.  Then turn around and sell the loot for a lot more than it would vendor for.  Without loot trading, he would have more likely rolled Greed and just let the person roll need and get it.
---
So why is it abuse?
---
1. The deception of using lower-level gear to justify rolling Need when you don't Need
---
2. Selling someone that which should have been theirs in the first place
---
TL;DR:  It's like stealing from someone's house and then selling the item back to them.
---
Sure, I agree. I just don't think this would be an issue no matter what they went with, as there WOULD exist an easy fix.
---
You don't get the benefit of Windfury, so yes, you need BoM.
---
It was quite common when I played WotLK.  Not to the level this guy says, but it was very common for a guild to take 3-4 players into a dungeon and the PUGs had a hard time getting gear.
---
This sub is full of Blizzard true believers. It's really quite bizarre. I guess they have so much invested emotionally in Classic WoW that they simply can't handle any sort of criticism.
---
They are only setting themselves up for disappointment though. It would be better for their mental state to maintain some degree of reasonable skepticism.
---
Right but heroic strike replaces a white swing, so the correct formula for your example should subtract that, e.g.,
---
[Heroic Strike] - [Replaced White Swing]
---
[(Basic AA Weapon Damage + Heroic Strike fixed bonus damage + Heroic Strike fixed bonus threat) x 1.3 x 1.15] - [(Basic AA Weapon Damage) x 1.3 x 1.15]
---
= (Heroic Strike fixed bonus damage + Heroic Strike fixed bonus threat) x 1.3 x 1.15
---
These are mostly static amounts.  The damage bonus can be improved by critical strike chance and debuffs on the target, but you can largely model heroic strike as a static additive threat value.
---
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Zones_by_level_(original)
---
From mid-20s through 40s you have to oscillate between the various zones within a level range if you always want to be on yellow quests. For example, in the 20s as Alliance you silicate among Loch Modan, Westfall, and Redridge. In the 30s it's Duskwood, Wetlands, Dustwallow Marsh, and Hillsbrad. Plan to spend a lot of time in flight if you love questing.
---
Seriously. Now wolfs, that's another story.
---
I liked crusader enchant, minor fire enchant and of mongoose.
---
The fire looked much better then beastslayer
---
As a druid healer, I want shadow priests and ele shamans. No, don't worry, you don't need to heal :) we just need you for your deeps :)
---
1. It's a lot easier to tell a ninja with a BoE.  "Equip it" and if they do, it's bound and they can't sell it on AH.
---
2. BOP items usually drop off specific mobs, which usually take time to get a group for.  They feel earned.  BOE items are more of a bonus.  (At least that's how it feels to me)
---
3. BOP items are usually stronger than BOE items.  
---
Part of the issue is that the way classes are generally valued is based on DPS/HPS meters.  Hybrids were designed to do damage and healing in the same encounter but that usually does not happen, particularly in raids.  If you had two ferals who tried to do both DPS and healing, even if they were really good at it, the sum of the 2's DPS and HPS would probably be less than the sum of the DPS and HPS of a rogue + priest combo.
---
Well-played hybrids can bring less easily measured benefits to groups, but 1) most hybrids are poorly played and 2) most people in a position to judge the value of a player's contribution don't look beyond meter numbers.
---
I hope attitudes toward hybrids - even memespec enhancement - is a little more forgiving in classic considering how easy the raiding is going to be.
---
We never went to such lengths in WotLK.  We'd just overtly do this to gear up guildies.  
---
There were two main takeaways from my memory of the classic forums. The first was that everyone loved playing the Paladins. The other was that we all wanted the class to be improved.
---
I agree completely that at the point Blizz saw the significance of the changes they needed to make, the decided to just incorporate them in with the BC expansion. 
---
I'm not really interested in changes at this point. I'm invested in the idea that Classic is being treated as a museum piece. But it's absolutely wrong to treat Paladins  as though they were perfectly designed in Vanilla "as healers." Blizzard didn't think they were, and most of then player base didn't either.
---
* If I'm melee, then a healer
---
* If I'm ranged, then a tank
---
* In general, a mage or hunter
---
Right?  Wtf was that.
---
Tanaristan lol. I have not heard that one before!
---
They'll just send players back in time to re-kill some old stuff.
---
I don't even know why it's done this way in live.  Looks so much better in classic.
---
In some dungeons I like warlocks for Curse of Recklessness. It prevents mobs from fleeing and decreases their armor. It's one of the best proactive wipe prevention spells available when working with a sloppy group that spreads out DPS.
---
The fact that you are aware that 'insult generators' (???) exist suggests that it is you who is the dweeb here, you little melt. 
---
Is it possible to 2man or 3man with maybe 1 or two warriors and a priest at level 30?
---
But you didnt link anything or tell us who you're talking about.
---
Holy shit you're actually retarded. Let me spell it back out for you again.
---
&gt; I thought back when it was originally implemented, classes that could actually wear the item could roll Need and you could only loot trade items you won via Greed.
---
&gt; Is that not the case?
---
The answer is "No", you clownshoe. That was not the case. You could roll Need on an item that you were [eligible](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/37110-new-loot-feature-bop-item-trading-updated/) to [loot](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Need_Before_Greed) and then pass the item around to whomever you wanted. 
---
So going back to what I said before, if you have a party with 4 friends and a random player, you could screw that player out of loot by having your friends roll 'Need' on items they were eligible for and then passing that loot around. 
---
So **bringing this system to Classic is a bad fucking idea because of how it can be abused.** Fuck you're dumb.
---
Its the hottest content right now, HOTS
---
How do warriors fair in pvp, BGs? I imagine they take a lot of fire being a melee, always in range. And if don't have a healer with them will die quickly and often. 
---
Also, if I wanted to pvp but also tank dungeons would I need two full sets of gear?
---
[This perhaps?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8j9rau/pros_and_cons_alliance_vs_horde/)
---
Indeed, the fact that Heroic Strike "attaches" itself to a white swing is basically neither here nor there. For calculation purposes it may as well be an instant cast ability that costs (30+R) rage where R is the amount of rage 1 auto attack deals, and does a fixed non-changeable amount of threat/damage. 
---
Boosting your white damage with a better weapon only increases th damage/threat caused by your white damage. Whereas for a Bear, increasing your AP/Str/Crit has a multiplicative effect on your TOTAL threat/crit because Maul's threat is three times the amount of damage it deals.
---
The art team has never been bad honestly. I give them major kudos for trying to carry the rest of the dev team.
---
When people talk about what is viable and what is not, they are always imagining that they are going to be in a raid full of pros who know how to play their class perfectly, have BIS gear, use potions and flasks, etc.
---
That is pure *fantasy.*  There will be a *tiny handful* of guilds that meet that description.  Even a guild like that might bring a feral.  He will be the best feral in the world and will not top the meters but it won't matter because the guild doesn't need optimal DPS to down encounters and they want to have "the best feral in the world" on their roster.
---
An average feral is worse than an average rogue but a good feral can be better than an average rogue.
---
Anecdote: I occasionally DPS endgame dungeons since apparently a lot of people play healers on pservers and I have routinely beat fury warriors by putting on quest greens and cat forming using a healing touch resto spec (with nat weapons and OOC only, 0 pts in feral).  These fury warriors are in raiding guilds.
---
So stop assuming you're going meter-for-meter against world class players.  You're not unless you're also world class, and if you are, you've got a fully geared rogue alt anyway so when your RL complains that you're failing a DPS check on Patchwerk you're switching off your suboptimal fun memespec to your optimal cruise control spec to down the fight and move on with life.
---
Bad taste.
---
With this level of detective skill, I expected to see "Just one more thing..." in your post.
---
The graphics are literally the least worst thing about retail imo.
---
Warriors are crazy gear dependent in both PVE and PVP. So they can 2 shot cloth classes with the right gear. But they can also be kiting by everyone and their mother. So gear and class knowledge with needed. And DPS gear vs tanking gear is pretty different. Could you tank in your DPS gear? Maybe in 5 man's if it isn't made of leather. But you will need a 1h/Sheild at the very least. I raid tanked in vanilla, and I had like 4 sets of tanking gear plus dps gear plus pvp gear. I had bank alts because my bank was full of gear. Gear is warrior life. 
---
I agree that any change that will impact the social aspect of wow in a negative way should not be implemented
---
And they made them really strong, so all the bads play em :)
---
Graduating class of 2010
---
At least Alliance get more changes in scenery and more flight paths in the future.
---
I kind of like exploring, but yeah, it HURTS when you're a Warrior, caster, or pre-40 Paladin hah.
---
Well at least we don't see some ridiculous 4 legged running of a Tauren.
---
You honestly can't reason with blizzdrones, it's sad but unfortunately true.
---
Go take a look on r/wow, half the folk there are still defending the state of the game.
---
Wow... that's actually a fantastic idea! I should make totem-killing macros.
---
I guess you just add every totem name to target and attack, and it'll go for whatever is first on the list?
---
You needed a separate gear set for cat and bear if you wanted to be decent at both. Plus a healing set, so...you had a fair bit of bag space taken up with stuff. And you do need to put some effort into finding decent gear pre-raid. Do those, and you're okay. 
---
You wouldn't be top dps, mind you, but you'd do alright, and having a combat rez or emergency healing on tap is frequently helpful. 
---
what are you on about? context please
---
&gt; And no, for you fallacy lovers, this is not a "slippery slope fallacy". That would only be the case were there not a reasonable expectation of the pattern continuing, but given that we already have ten years of history in which the exact same thing happened it is completely reasonable to worry that Classic WoW will follow the same development pattern as WoW.
---
Can you prove that it was an exact and inevitable chain of causation that led from loot trading to LFR or CRZ? And no, loot trading beind added to the game some time before LFR was added is not what an actual chain of causation is. 
---
No, you can't prove a chain of causation so it's still a slippery slope fallacy. 
---
Blizzard wants to keep the Classic lovers, they don't want Classic to appeal to retail players: they already have retail for that and since it's a shared sub the only way for them to actually lose out on subs is to chase Classic lovers away by going too far with changes. They don't care if retail lovers enjoy classic because they'll just be playing retail then and still pay the sub. 
---
So it IS completely unreasonable to worry that Classic WoW will follow the same dev pattern. 
---
Seems like i did 2 posts, one with the link, one without. Sorry, kinda new to reddit. Can i delete this myself?
---
OOF
---
Mongoose anyone??
---
Loot sharing should be removed plain and simple. Stop trying to cater to made up demands 
---
On private servers I’ve had LESS of a problem with ninja looting than I remember having on retail vanilla wow. 
---
If someone ninjas something , the whole server will know about it and he will make the blacklist as they should. This was enough deterrent to simply not ninja loot in the classic community  
---
Obviously toxicity will occur eventually. Grow up and get over it. You don’t have to run to the forums or Reddit every time you don’t get your pampered way in a video game. Ninja looting is not enough of a problem to warrant loot sharing. 
---
Unfortunately the idiots at blizzard are also experimenting with sharding, so if they use cross realm mechanics at all the blacklisting concept will be ruined. This is the scenario I suspect Blizzard to go regardless of the entire community not wanting it. 
---
who the hell downvotes this post? who are this ppl like really? really?!
---
it just boggles my mind. do you srsly defend loot trading? what?! are you crazy? cant you think even few steps ahead? do you know vanilla wow enviroment? 
---
do you realize its not the same wow as retail, but just older. Its a different game, and a VERY different enviroment in all ways.  how rarer loot are in general and more chracter defining, how much more valuable gold are, how longer everything takes. its not even wotlk.
---
CANT YOU FUCKING THINK AT ALL? 
---
imagine the vanilla wow with loot trading and how it gonna play out and enviroment be and without, how on earth anyone can defend it?! are you crazy or what?
---
omgad. ppl on this sub srsly trigger me like nothing else, how stupid can you really be? is these ppl all braindead blizzard loyal americans? i don't even know what to think at this point.
---
They are not choosing things that are best for the game, they are choosing things that will cost them the least amount of money. They could go ahead with server architecture similar to vanilla (or private servers for that matter), but they chose to go with new distributed systems they already have in place. They say it's better, but I tell you it is definitelly cheaper. It might be more resilient to crashes, but also cheaper for maintenance but it will have hard time holding same amount of players as vanilla or pservers. They are choosing price over features.
---
No kidding! Mongoose was way cooler than any red glow!
---
—A Rogue 
---
I remember getting the scythe looking staff for my warlock in Vanilla (epic mount quest reward?). Initially I put the Minor Beast Slayer, which drew a lot of attention around Ironforge. Then later I believe I put the Fiery enchant on it, which drew a lot more attention.
---
Those were fun days.
---
That's BC
---
Twink enchant
---
I rushed in vanilla once. I've rushed ever since. I don't particularly enjoy the leveling experience. It's just necessary to get to the part I enjoy.
---
I feel enjoyment, which is the primary purpose of a game, should have a pretty damn strong correlation to quality.
---
If Blizzard's main reason for loot trading is to reduce GM tickets then there are several ways to do that without changing the social experience as well as the negative outcomes it would produce. 
---
One way is to put a short timer on the BOE item (like 5 minutes) which when expires the item is soul bound. This would give a chance for people who accidentally needed to give it back, or when a ML made a mistake.
---
No use getting upset about it man. Just remember that this is just a repeat of the same process that played out ten years ago. People will always choose convenience over community.
---
I'll PM since the policing mods doesn't allow exchange of that information openly.
---
No. You'll be taken along by people just looking for 39 other warm bodies to beat MC with, but that's it. It's an incredibly weak spec for raid boss fights.
---
This is a good post but it will be automatically disregarded because you mentioned private servers. For whatever reason people here get really upset about them - I'm not entirely sure why though.
---
I got this enchant on brain hacker because the weapon and the enchant both sucked but I thought looked cool together.
---
Simple enough.
---
Chances are, if I've got the gear, I may grind DME from 52-60. And maybe start BiS dungeons Strat / Scholo / DM with a legit group at 57ish.
---
&gt; Everyone knew this already.
---
Do they? Where's the documentation and math to support it?
---
I can't for the life of me get a hang of ye olde stance dance. Never could back in the day and still can't on pirate servers.
---
Should I just kys right away or can i still tank at level 60? I'm probably too casul to get into much raiding that can't be PuGed anyway.
---
It really depends on the guild. 
---
At first, most likely you are not getting invited. If the guild is more experienced and the content is on farm, and if you have the weapon Nightfall equipped for the chance on hit procs, then you could be invited to the raid.
---
No your dps will not be useful in the raid and you will be nothing but a proc bitch for the casters to increase their damage. You will not feel like a contribution to the raid like other roles. 
---
The bottom line is enhance shamans do not bring anything to the raid that a resto shaman doesn’t. You will likely need to be healing as a shaman if you want to raid 
---
Enhancement is fun anyway though and you can play what you want, but don’t have crybaby demands about the spec on the forums or Reddit because it’s simply not going to happen 
---
You can shine in solo content and PvP quite well if you want to play enhancement mainly. 
---
You will not be a valuable member in the raid in anyway shape or form. No exceptions.  
---
&gt;Can you prove that it was an exact and inevitable chain of causation
---
The same logic ("convenience &gt; community") was behind both changes. 
---
Hi, I come from southern Italy, so I'm mittel-European!
---
So u could also not dual box...
---
Shadowmeld also helps to get the charge off when closing the distance on a range class. For example, a mages fireblast has longer range than a charge. A mage will fireblast you into combat, you can't charge, which changes the entire fight.
---
Shadowmeld just before they are able to fireblast, it drops their target then most likely you can close the distance and charge.
---
This happens all the time in pvp, every ranged class will try to get you into combat, its a HUGE difference maker.
---
Also effective for guarding bases, choosing when/where to enter combat in general. Eat/drink stealth. I loved it in vanilla. Probably rolling a NE warrior again, shadowmeld is amazing for warriors.
---
Got any links to info on this? Sounds neat as fuck.
---
You know what's weird though is that /r/wow is now more critical of Blizzard that /r/classicwow! It's a funny turn of events.
---
The real problem though is that gamers are prone to fanboyism whereby they emotionally connect with a soulless corporation that is out to profit off of them, and defend that corporation to the hilt due to this emotional connection which the corporation does not, cannot, and will not reciprocate. 
---
Horde is for men who can get girls.
---
Alliance is for people who have to ERP in Goldsboro.
---
That’s all the info you should need to make your decision
---
Neither inevitable not an actual chain of causation.
---
Depends on what playstyle you enjoy most - melee or ranged/caster. However, keep in mind that rogues are very much single target, and mages are the best aoe class by a large margin. 
---
Yeah, having like 2 bags full of gear at all times was annoying. I carried most of my alt sets on my person because I would always forget something and waste tons of time running back to my bank. I was much younger then so I will probably be okay banking alt sets this time around and not forgetting them lol.
---
That is a very poor assumption.
---
Enhancement shamans were wrecking balls in pvp back in vanilla days. I didn't level priest until wotlk, but disc was great, by then. If memory serves, disc priest was good in Vanilla pvp, too, unless there was a stun lock rogue after you.
---
Yes. With the addition of the other option for those not interested in current wow and don't value classic at 15usd/mo
---
Scarlet Monastery Armory runs to kill Herod and getting those beautiful shoulders.  
---
Or finding your first plate item as a warrior, feelsgood
---
the ultimate argument for no changes is that the game doesn't need any improvement. maybe it's possible, but it's simply not necessary. there is not a single thing about vanilla that, when thinking about, would keep me from wanting to play it. and since any change comes with a risk, it's greedy and childish to want to change it, because vanilla doesn't officially exist. 
---
if it existed, and then they decided to create a remake, i couldn't care less and i understand where the excitement lies in changes. but some people try to steal the game from the mass of players who love this game to death and played it for the past 15 years on shitty servers, for their own selfish needs. and, really, that's also fine. it's just that blizzard isn't trustworthy to make the right decision and therefore the war of downvotes is inevitable. 
---
Both are great for pvp. Priest are better defensively, are much better at healing and somewhat unintuitively a bit bulkier. Shamans are much more offensive to the point where ditching healing for just damage and support can be better and way more gear dependant. It's hard to say which one is better because they perform completely different tasks with the only thing in common being offensive dispells. For 1v1s priest might be a little bit better and in group pvp you want both.
---
They’re both pretty offensive, purge and dispel. 
---
I’m assuming you want to heal which might not be true. Shadow isn’t actually that great in BGs, but amazing in 1v1. Ele is quite strong in BGs, especially if you have a Priest giving you Power Infusion in premades. 
---
They both kind of suffer from lack of proper itemization at the start. 
---
Personally though I’d go Shaman for straight up BG fun. 
---
you haven't lived if you never got beastslayer on your crappy weapon
---
They are just ignorant. Look at retail wow today, you think they offer better quality than a private server? Not true!
---
There are a few private servers that offer ten times the customer experience than live Blizzard servers ever will again, and they’re all free! 
---
Ignorance is bliss. Let them miss out and get mad at Blizzard servers their whole life. 
---
Yes you can prove the chain. Do you know what "precedence setting" is?
---
I guess we should just draw no conclusions from past conduct at all. 
---
This list is ridiculous, but at least I agree with his top 2. 
---
Not what I said: cheap strawman.
---
I've always been partial to troll warriors. I simply enjoyed their animations much more and liked how they looked in plate/tank gear. Plus it was always a "holy crap our tank is a troll?" Made it fun for all at the end.
---
There you go again! 
---
With atrocious grammar like that it was no surprise to see national discrimination further down your post. The two things correlating with low IQ btw, just because I know you would have needed help drawing the connection ;)
---
My mage still has his Staff of Westfall with minor beastslaying :)
---
Not a thing in WoW development or game development at all because the devs are not bound by previous decisions. 
---
No chain of causation proven here at all. 
---
ITT a lot of people don't understand how the loot system in classic actually worked.
---
At release, there wasn't even "need/greed" you either rolled for an item or you passed. In confused pugs, you had people rolling on everything, even BoP items they couldn't use, because they could vendor or D/E the item. Forum outcry eventually led to the patch that added the "need/greed" roll option.
---
But even then, rolling need or greed was simply a player made choice. A mage could roll need on plate, or 2-handed axes. Players would do that, all the time. While leveling up it was annoying, but hardly worth the effort of trying to fix. There might be some crying in trade chat or a forum post but really you just had to deal with it. 
---
The most common defense? Oops, I miss-clicked dude sorry I took your sword but it's not like a raid epic and i'm not a ninja!
---
The ability to trade loot, within party, eliminates this defense. Okay, if you miss-clicked, then trade me the item back.
---
Yes, with loot trading people will be able to need items they don't personally need, this is true. without loot trading, people did that all the time. At high levels, in guilds, or groups for the more serious dungeons, people got blacklisted for it and the player base worked things out. That exact same dynamic can occur with trading for party loot, nothing at all changes. Assholes can be assholes, but you can still avoid grouping with them.
---
The only thing that does change is that you can identify the assholes with 100% certainty, since they can't use the miss-click excuse anymore.
---
Doesnt loot trading only apply to items that were greeded? And if so can someone explain why this is a problem. 
---
&gt; Have fun running a dungeon and having your loot be given to friends of a friend
---
I mean, from my point of view, complaining about this is just... Pointless.  
---
If people are looking to Classic for the social aspects, they should expect to be "asked" to build those social connections.  
---
If I join in a PUG, I expect the group starter(s) to put Master Loot, and to give out stuff to their friends first, even though I personally would not do it.  
---
I would work towards building my group of friends, let's call it... A guild!  
---
We would work together, and then we would spread loot among us, in order of necessity.  
---
When no cloth in my guild needed the shoulders that dropped, I was given them on my hunter, since they gave me mana and I didn't have shoulders at all.  
---
When I joined PUGs, I took what I got, I didn't go in with any expectations, and everything was an extra.
---
A ton of running for alliance, IIRC
---
The thumbnail is actually terrifying ofc
---
I remember that!! i was the warrior in your group 
---
Warriors do a lot of damage at endgame, with good gear. So, a lot of people roll warriors for dps and never intend to tank. Some never even want to tank leveling up, which is just dumb as any warrior can tank dungeons regardless of spec. 
---
Also, tanking lvl 60 5 man's is, IMO, more difficult than a lot of raid tanking which further discourages would-be tanks. 
---
Basically, tanking dungeons is stressful since the fate of the group falls on your ability to manage the threat of multiple mobs simultaneously, positioning yourself so as not to pull extra groups, and staying alive. Most people would rather just hit shit. 
---
On the flip side, you'll find that a fair number of warriors like to raid tank. As a result you can end up with no one to tank dungeons, and an abundance of tanks in raids. That also makes it tough to shift from dungeons to raids as, unless you get in early, you have no issues gearing up but struggle to find a guild that will have you tank straight away. 
---
It's bizarre how easily you can tell someone is active in The\_Donald from their posts 
---
Yup. You are the hero of the day! Huzzah!
---
I would suggest a Mage, between the two, for the AoE.  
---
As an added bonus, self-feeding.  
---
As one more bonus, portals and teleports.
---
Mage. 
---
Great for single target and aoe dps.
---
Great for CC
---
Great for utility (water/portals)
---
Great for farming gold for alts and professions
---
Possibly most sought DPS in dungeons
---
Competitive in raids
---
Competitive in PvP.
---
The BOE MC epics never sold for 50g. Did you even play Vanilla? 
---
Shaman is pretty fun just because of windfury and  double lightning bolts (I think thats a thing in classic? Maybe it wasn't until BC). You can explode people with RNG. Without RNG you get kinda dumped on. Dispel is AWESOME.
---
I’m gonna main rogue, super fun class to play and level. If you were only gonna do one of the two it would have my vote.
---
With that said though if you’re gonna do both, do the mage first. AOE grinding can get you some pretty good cash at max level. Rogues are pretty gear dependent (particularly weapons), being able to buy all the goodies you want for your rogue while leveling will make the experience much better.
---
&gt; and I can't really think of an alternative questing area for Alliance in that level range.
---
I just did a dwarf alt who completely skipped Wetlands, but it was awkward and made possible by lots of rested bonus. (I rarely played him)   You also have to spend way more time in and around Ashenvale than is good for your mental health and then you go to 1000 needles, the salt flats that have some alliance or neutral quests.  
---
taking revenge on stitches at higher levels
---
IMO solo grinding with a priest is okay really, it probably gets better after level 40. I hit 60 at 160 hours on my priest playthrough, alternating between questing and grinding with no attempt at speedrunning it. Doable within the 2 weeks you mention.
---
Short of a very minmaxxed and detailed Alliance questing speedrunning route, grinding could still be your best bet.
---
Imagine if someone brings a friend to need for them and they get the item. You might not even get mad since next time you will bring a friend to need for you. This reinforces bad brhaviour like this that will go unpunished.
---
How many times do people really give loot to the wrong person? I don’t have any data, but surely this can’t be the majority of the tickets...
---
I am interested as well!
---
BfA release was rushed, systems implemented not thought through. 
---
There was a sale specifically designed to keep players sub by pairing it with a mount shortly after release. Another sale of store mounts going away to the "Blizzard vault" that *may* return at a later date. Also a new unique modeled store mount got released for 25 bucks. 
---
All of this while the game is in one of the worst states it has ever been in. Fixes that should've been in the game since launch pushed back to be released in 8.1 didn't help either. The game is currently designed to keep players logging in every day by basically putting in daily/weekly timegated lootboxes. The whole design philosophy seems to circle around some internal statistics, I assume it's mainly participation, and not about the players enjoyment. 
---
Blizzard seems entirely disconnected from what their older playerbase wants. Another example is the announcement at Blizzcon showcasing the new Diablo Immortal, which basically none of the loyal fans of the franchise wanted. 
---
As for Classic, I'd expect the worst and hope for the best. The developers and Ion at least showed they have a passion for the project and want to keep it as authentic as possible. I wouldn't even blame them if it doesn't happen because of the beancounters.
---
What sort of dungeon groups do you think you will be running that have 3+ people all rolling need for the same item?
---
This is vastly overblown.
---
98% of the time, you will have a decent group composition with 1 cloth, 1 leather, 1 mail, and 1 plate, with 1 duplicate class. There is no loot trading going on here, unless you have mages rolling need on plate. But that could occur in classic already. What did you do when a mage rolled need on valor or dal'rends? You kick them from party and blacklist them. So if they do it with party trading enabled, you still do the same thing.
---
The other 2%, something really special drops like the Baron's mount. Everybody rolls need because that is how things go. At that point, who cares if the winner trades off or sells the item : you didn't win it, it isn't yours, you lost the right to complain when you didn't roll high enough. In original classic if you didn't win the item you didn't get it, same outcome.
---
This is what I keep coming back to. Nobody knows the version of loot trading they are going to use, right? I assume it would be the way you described it.
---
Agreed. There were always those names that just stuck out after a while. If you were in a 5man and needed to put another, the rare occasion of those names popping up led to many a *poof* when those people were added.
---
It was a zone alliance had no reason to ever go to aside from the MC quest and farming felcloth, IIRC
---
The assertion that it's all activision's fault doesn't really have a lot of hard evidence, it's just a "coincidence" that blizz started doing more cash-grab stuff after they were picked up by activision. It likely is activision's fault, but it's not like we have emails or statements from activision actually telling blizz to make the mistakes they have.
---
Heroic/mythic raiding, titanforged gear, and azerite gear are some of the big problems for current raiding. It is just extremely grindy, and then they throw on LFR which is just an absolute cakewalk where you will never wipe. World quests are also a huge thing, which a lot of people don't like because they're just annoying mini games half the time and extremely repetitive all the time.
---
A lot of people don't like how the server merges went down, as well as sharding everything. PvP has always taken a back seat to the rest of the game, so nothing really new there. Loot trading and LFG were added in WotLK, but we didn't really realize the problems from those systems till well into cata. Cata removed a lot of the old nostalgia for people, gold inflated like crazy, wow tokens were added which is basically buying gold, the cash shop... the list of people's grievances just goes on and on.
---
Again, whether or not it is a better system is irrelevant. The issue at hand is whether it changes the social dynamics of raid groups (which it does). 
---
it also had this weird quest with a shipwrecked crew in the south part of the coast.  And a few gnome engineer vendors :D 
---
I think I never discovered that quest in retail vanilla, despite being in a hardcore guild that killed Azuregos often.  
---
It's not a single thing that has happened that is blatantly obvious. It's the idea that Blizzard has changed entirely in how they see their consumers. Blizzard used to be a company that first and foremost focused on making good games, and the money just came because of it. Now they are leaning towards, how do we keep getting money from our customers, and designing games to fit that idea.
---
To put it simply, we've seen a paradigm shift from focusing on putting out the best product possible, to focusing on putting out the most profitable product possible. 
---
Yeah and mor Ladim. When ur killing some zombies and u see him running towards you out of nowhere ready to one shot you
---
You may be able to get into a MC BWL only guild but no Naxx guilds are going to take you. Enhancement is one of the worst spec considered for Nightfall. 
---
Oh yeah I actually found this quest leveling my second char during vanilla.
---
If I remember correctly it barely even gave any XP or reward right?
---
You don’t have the balls to subscribe to T_D
---
I never said that they sold for 50g, I was implying that everyone was piss poor in vanilla and most people didn't have more than 50g on them.
---
It has a bunch, but they're all in uldaman 
---
and Garrosh with full high warlords gear.
---
They're not different. What is different is that instead of that rare BoE epic drop that one party member claims is an upgrade and wants to solo NEED roll on it, now every decent gear drop becomes that piece.
---
We all remember telling that hunter "Now EQUIP IT in front of us!" and watching him leave group and hearth out. With loot trading he doesn't have to be so obvious in his shenanigans and risk getting black listed. And all gear will be subject to it.
---
Sometimes i tonight it's also important to know what doesn't need to be tanked. A caster that dies quickly? Mark as skull and don't even bother with it, the DPS can handle it. 
---
this guy fucks
---
What gave you this impression?
---
He's not your friend, pal!
---
indeed, felwood is a top 10, maybe even top 5 zone. It really is invaluable for lvl 60s and a great leveling zone for lvl 50+.  What really helps these lvl 50-60 grinds is when you can combine the leveling with farming stuff you will need post lvl 60.  Like felcloth. Or something else for melee classes.  It really has everything, from metals to dreamfoil and plaguebloom
---
Yeh I’ll take u on our C team. My 8 yo nephew sAmuel leads n tanks the raid on his BM hunter
---
Thats the thing. It seems like a lot of these "but jimmy john could invite 3 buddies and all 4 of them could roll on the sword i want and then trade it to jimmy john and I am stuck with my sad green weapon, loot trading suxors!" posts come from ignorance. That isn't really how classic groups formed.
---
You had a guild or friend, you started a group, then you looked for 1-2 pugs. Generally the understanding is in joining a group like this, the group leader gets to decide the rules. Group lead wants to skip optional boss #217, sorry but you will be skipping that boss. Groups are generally fair about loot, but there will also be groups where they advertise "need 1 dps, dal'rends reserved" because some geared fury warrior or rogue needs dal'rends and nothing else and the only reason he is running is to get his item. You can scoff at the reservation, but the alternative is "need 1 dps, caster druid dhaman or hunter, melee classes priority on melee drops" which is essentially the exact same thing except a rogue or warrior who doesn't want dal'rends doesn't even get the option to join.
---
Sometimes a healer or tank could get some pull as far as optional bosses or loot distribution, but for the most part if you are joining a pug you follow that pugs rules.
---
TL;DR: if you are in a group with 3-4 people who are friends, they don't need you. you need them. So you are going to follow the rules they lay out anyway, or leave the group. Especially if you are a DPS, which can be replaced in seconds on most servers.
---
TIL you need courage to be a racist. Thank you for your service I guess o7
---
No.
---
I don't think I even saw that elemental and its quests in wetlands my first 60, but that was 14 years ago. I do remember grinding a full level killing slimes trying to get that damned purse to drop. So annoying
---
And no mention of the huge elite troll area in Hinterlands in the writeup? Spent a lot of time screwing around there. 
---
"WoW development or game development at all because the devs are not bound by previous decisions."
---
Yes they are haha
---
&gt;98% of the time, you will have a decent group composition with 1 cloth, 1 leather, 1 mail, and 1 plate, with 1 duplicate class.
---
Ummm, no sweetie. 
---
Class demographics don't work like that unless you specifically form a group around that which would take hours. 
---
Oh absolutely, I never meant to imply that they didn't. I'm just saying that all the shiny new-ness won't be able to come back because we've all been there before, add-ons and guides are everywhere. 
---
I got a six demon bag there
---
damn, it's too long ago since I played horde undead.  I actually could not remember where or what silverpine forest is.   I always played orcs or tauren in retail and now on private servers I play dwarfs and gnomes mostly. 
---
Not a single comment about flight paths. I was surprised. 
---
As a Druid healer, I didn’t let people die
---
How do you know that?
---
Raids already had loot trading. You just had to open a GM ticket. So the only change is that it's a more visible option, easier and less work on Blizzard's side.
---
Social dynamics change regardless. The exact same game as original classic would also have different social dynamics, because of player knowledge, so that seems like a silly thing to get stuck on. 
---
I guess Blizzard should just cancel Classic, because social dynamics are going to be different, I assure you.
---
I never got the fuss about sheep's being the only viable CC. As a hunter you have serious good CC that can even take out undead, demons and such. Locks Seduction is a bit tough and Rogues Sap is definitely high risk, but Hunters traps? They are awesome. Not directed against your response, it's only you hear this so often in the game that people only invite a Mage if they need cc. 
---
Yikes.
---
Wat
---
I thought rogues were the least gear dependent class.  I always remember hearing how little they scaled with gear.  It’s like, the foundation of the World or Roguecraft series.
---
On horde: merciless axe from the vendor in tarren mill. 
---
A bit fast but there are no other good weapons from quests or dungeon until whirlwind weapons.
---
Bfd sword of the hydra is good but it could take you 10-20 hours to get...
---
If youre ahead of the pack youll need to consider vendor axes like bullova at 30 and the lvl 20 one( both 3.8 speed) 
---
You can always sell those to another player since they arent bound on equip.
---
Who cares? 
---
honestly its more for bow, powershifting eats your mana
---
It does take hours to form groups, and unless you are an idiot or you don't want any loot you will do it by default.
---
On any given server there are typically an overabundance of hunters and rogues, and the tank is almost certainly a warrior, so by default you get one of each and have 3 armor types covered. Then you just make sure either your last DPS is a warlock or mage, or you get a priest as your healer.
---
BTW, if you are a DPS (only) warrior good luck. Very few groups are willing to invite one, because the tank would rather have first dibs on both tank and dps warrior gear and other DPS are so easy to find.
---
Need bow so you don't run dry powershifting
---
You need to build friendship with that guild GM/Officer - thats the only way to guarantee raid spot in decent guild. 
---
Or you'll should aim to scout some newbie guild that is just starting raiding and don't have enough people to fill raid spots (still there is big change you'll be force to spec resto in future).
---
So only way to keep playing Enh is to get friends in officers or to become officer or even better GM.
---
What game me the impressions that everyone was poor in vanilla? 
---
It’s not absurd, because it openly shows the community that Blizzard isn’t afraid to go back on their word and alter the game. That’s problematic for what is supposed to be a replica.
---
I mean, the point is that the Mage could need on the plate and trade it to his friend with this system, no? So if you *happen* to have a group with 2 DPS being rogues, but one rogue is a pug, and the other 4 are friends, you are basically rolling against 4 other people for that one rogue item that would have *otherwise* been a roll between you and the other rogue, not you, and the rogue and his 3 friends, with his friends being able to trade it to him afterwards.
---
That is of course if this is how the system will work.
---
In raids? I can see it work better, but then you have that idea of people who run DKP system, someone can bribe another player with gold to 'buy' an item drop for DKP and then just trade it over, letting the player who bribed with gold just build up even more DKP to actually 'buy' his next item with DKP.
---
The Roguecraft video is with max cooldowns and prep. 
---
That means you can fight ONE enemy and then you can wait 10minutes.
---
Also Roguecraft was made when rogue WERE op, because clothis didnt scale well and only had intellect and no +sp making them terrible.
---
With the 1.12. client mages will fare much better without gear.
---
Rogues die very, very fast in group PvP and 1vX
---
Exactly how does it change the social dynamic? Do you think being able to Ninja was an integral part of the social dynamic? It's nothing like changes like the LFG system created for example. 
---
Minor Beastslayer was always the honorable mark of having your Rogue truly having entered the arena that is World PvP.
---
So because they implement loot trading they HAVE to implement LFG and LFR? 
---
&gt;Do you think being able to Ninja was an integral part of the social dynamic
---
Absolutely. Piece of shit acting like pieces of shit and other people finding ways to deal with pieces of shit was an integral part of Vanilla.
---
If you are joining a group of 4 friends, they could just run with master looter on and take everything.
---
Why wasn't this a common problem in classic? Because it happens once, the group/guild gets blacklisted, people get gkicked or the guild gets a bad rep, and over time nobody is willing to pug with them. Loot trading makes absolutely no difference.
---
Yeah. I saw MC BOE epics sell for hundreds all the time. Also selling spots in BWL/MC for certain loot for hundreds of golds. I never saw it happen in AQ40/Naxx since most people didn't have those on farm.
---
something about shadow priests and melting of faces ;)
---
Why do hunters become decreasingly less and less useful throughout raids? Never got to Naxx, and only leveled a hunter to 57 in vanilla 
---
&gt;so that seems like a silly thing to get stuck on. 
---
And this is why you'll get WoW 2 instead of Classic WoW.
---
It also allowed for trading of Need rolled and master looted items. Not just greed rolled items.
---
This is the thing with the "everything is a fallacy" types - nothing is ever proof enough for them. It's an incredibly disingenuous form of argumentation which is why it is pointless to engage with them. 
---
It was the first thing I did when I boughy first account. I absolutely hated leveling in vanilla and tbc and pretty much every expansion ever until Nostalrius somehow changed my mind. Anyways, in early TBC I traded some Magic cards for an account with a 60 rogue and the first thing I did was getting the fiery enchants on my daggers. Wouldn't surprise me if I replaced the crusader enchant or something because I know they were already enchanted but with the wrong colour.
---
I played for about two days and then didn't touch WoW until mid-Wrath.
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in pvp.
---
Then you are just oblivious, idk what to tell you. There's plenty of twinks on the big name pservers.
---
You barely said anything in a wall of text. Impressive.
---
It will which is every item. Why won’t you assume it will work the way it did then?
---
&gt;A mage could roll need on plate, or 2-handed axes. Players would do that, all the time
---
It happened ‘all the time’ in the sense that car accidents happen all the time, perpetually, everyday. IE that argument doesn’t hold up, because it rarely ever happens on an individual basis. I almost never ever saw it happen, and it wasn’t an issue. The only reason you can argue it happening a lot isn’t because it is happening a lot, but because there are millions of people playing and it is happening sometimes. There will be toxic people in toxic groups—enforcing some rules on them berefts the players of having to better themselves socially. Just keep it the way it was. 
---
God I can't wait for Classic... for a good community again!
---
Pservers or vanilla?
---
Fiery enchanttttt

---
I don't even consider it bizarre by now.  I did a similar thing with certain kinds of Youtube commenters and seeing if they subscribed to Alex Jones until he was wiped.  It was all too easy and sad to have a high accuracy rate there.
---
Anyway, good thing OP got the post he was looking for.  And indeed, either faction is just fine. ...As long as you can tolerate gnomes.  I want to play Alliance, but the gnome part is going to be tough for me.
---
Ah good memories from Barrens, alliance trying to tame the white lion horde quest pet, Chuck Norris jokes, Mankrik's wife :)
---
Even slippery slope fallacy is a better argument for no change  then that.
---
&gt; This sub is full of Blizzard true believers. It's really quite bizarre.
---
It's not that bizarre. There was a questionnaire a while ago that showed around 70% (from what I remember) people here don't even play retail WoW. Therefore, they have no clue how fucking lost Blizzard is when it comes to decision making. As if major shit like ability pruning few expansions ago wasn't enough... but these days they're feeling particularly motivated to fuck up any leftover of the player enjoyment.
---
Being a rogue and not owning a red defias mask is blasphemy definitely
---
Extremely gear dependent, the video was pretty much highlighting that eviscerate doesnt scale with gear, which is an almost insignifcant amount of your dps in a raid setting anyway.
---
There are simple rules understood by all players that don't need to be reiterated every time a dungeon run happens(don't ninja or roll on something you won't use). This change chucks those rules and allows people to game the system. If I would have missed Dal'Rends or Band of Rumination many many times, I sure as shit would start thinking of asking the guildies in the group who could use the same item to roll for me. The possibility of that kind of ghost-ninjaing is what makes me paranoid to join PUGs when Classic arrives.
---
Shortcut to Ratchet? Is this using the path for the shaman totem quest to get there? Never heard of this
---
No point farming UBRS for Dal’rends in a pug. You will never get them with the rest of the party loot trading to their friends before they stop running. Guild only UBRS until you get them lol.
---
\*rouge 
---
[Band of rumination](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=18103), I think it's prebis for paladins but all healers and all dpscasters can make good use of it. There will be 3+ healers/casters in a UBRS group.
---
[No.](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/37110-new-loot-feature-bop-item-trading-updated/)  loot trading is for any item pretty much always. Only working on Greed rolls would defeat the reason it was added, and I don’t know how people thought that was how it was.
---
It never worked for greed only rolls.
---
Vanilla. Blackrock Alliance Guild Prodigy
---
Alliance is a great faction if you consult your doctor after seeing every prescription ad on TV.
---
Horde is a great faction if you could kick most peoples asses but never have to get to that point, because you walk quietly but carry big stick (and dick)
---
Alliance is great if you want everyone to run off and do their own thing in PvP, and then bitch and argue with each other when you lose.
---
Horde is great if you like to win PvP engagements , not because of racial imbalance but teamwork and communication is always on point.
---
To those defending loot trading, I sincerely hope you unknowingly get that piece of loot you wanted ninja'd from you. Because there's 100% going to be guildies and friends running an instance together, say ubrs for truestrike shoulders. Where 3 friends already have them but equipped a different shoulder slot before entering the instance and plan to roll need if they drop to then later trade them to their 4th friend. That fourth friend simply leaves the shoulders in his bags to equip them any time later. You are the 5th person that rolled on those shoulders and guess what , you rolled a 99 but one of the friends rolled a 100 and the actual person to wear the shoulders rolled a 1. Honestly this loot trading doesnt even affect me personally all that much because ive got a guild from a pvt server that i will be rolling with for instances. But for those who dont have a big group of friends to always be online for, the pugs, they will get the short end of the stick without even noticing it. And dont be a fucking idiot thinking this change is for the players, this is completely due to cutting the costs down on gm tickets requesting loot redistribution. Blizzard made this change to save money that is ALL this is about and anyone defending this is possibly retarded, undoubtedly low IQ.
---
the last year of buildup has resulted in so many "just a few small changes guys :) itll be more fun this way" posts that i'm beginning to fear for this summer
---
 Hahhaha thats so cool. Wish I experience that.
---
That has nothing to do with twinking, but to do with transmog and the fact that it's unobtainable.
---
&gt; go back on their word and alter the game.
---
It's already running on a version of WoW's UI / core from 2019 and not 2004 and being integrated to modern B.Net, not standalone.
---
So if your standard for not playing is *any* changes then goodbye!
---
which means the rest underperforms
---
when comparing speccs/classes/whatever you have to compare them at equal levels
---
Axe of Orgrimmar from RFC reward
---
Crescent Staff from WC reward
---
Strike of the Hydra from BFD \*drop
---
Corpsemaker from RFK \*drop
---
WW Axe
---
I wouldn't run BFD more than once and RFK more than twice, personally.  
---
After that it gets tougher.  Uldaman final boss drops two great 2 handers.  Gatorbite Axe from Mara drop.  Find a good deal on the auction house.    If AV is up you can get the polearm from there, otherwise you might be waiting for BRD/LBRS to get another solid 2 hander....and as a warrior you'll probably be 58+ and farming pre-bis at that point anyways.
---
Cata really was kinda like WoW 2 in a way. Basically every major gameplay system changed after that point and the direction changed overnight
---
To answer both comments here:
---
There's only ever been one version of loot trading: https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/37110-new-loot-feature-bop-item-trading-updated/
---
Which is to say, any BoP item from an enemy can be traded to anyone who was eligible for loot from that enemy.  There was a small loot change in 4.0 that made BoE items turn soulbound and untradable if you rolled Need on them while in a Dungeon Finder party.  This was done because people were being assholes and Needing on BoE items only to sell them on the auction house.
---
It’s not the gold buyers as much as the devs selling and generating gold.
---
Very.
---
The reasonable way to approach this is to weigh the social impact against the gameplay impact.
---
I'm not saying I disagree, just that blindly denying all changes that would alter the social dynamics isn't a good stance to take. That isn't going to get you far in convincing people.
---
I don't want loot trading, but I think the community will adapt for the better if it does make it into release. I'm already thinking through some addon ideas to assist.
---
&gt; regardless of whether it improves "quality of life" or whatever.
---
Who is making the case that loot trading improves quality of life?  It is a Blizzard customer support feature to cut down on customer support workload and turnaround time.
---
*"this was added to solve a common problem that existed back in classic where if you accidentally looted an item someone else in the raid meant to get - or maybe it was master looted to the wrong person - you could open a customer support ticket, contact the gm and say, "I didn't mean to loot this, I would like to give it to so-and-so."  And it might actually take a 4 or 5 day turnaround time, but CS would generally help you out with that problem and transfer the item."*
---
This is 100% a *'work with the existing CS infrastructure'* change for the benefit of Blizzard to cut costs.  I think the context is best explained by a post over on /r/wow:
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/a7rrmy/a_letter_to_blizzard_entertainment/ec62dvi/
---
*"I can tell you something happened around 2011/2012 after WotLK before Cataclysm.
---
From the CS side of the business it went from being a "Find a way to make the player happy" and "This is a game company, we should be having fun at work" to "What's your TPH (Tickets Per Hour), FCR (First Contact Resolution), CSS (Customer Service Score, how the customer rated their experience)."
---
This was some what fine because our ticket queue was absolutely bonkers, but we had 12 million players and most tickets were resolved to the satisfaction of the player."*
---
This is 100% a change to make the CS side of things work at 2019 Activision-Blizzard.
---
Both classes are great for grouping. You can’t really go wrong with them. I would consider having the lock use Voidwalker and have the druid in kitty-form and toss the VW a HoT once in a while. You should be able to chain-pull without any downtime (HoT the lock = free mana) and should be able to kill very fast with 2 DPS. 
---
Plenty of ”oh shit”-abilities aswell, kitty go bear if to large a pull, soulstone and combat-res if all fail
---
I played a hunter back in 06 and I remember being around the level 15-20 range, had some gray daggers that looked like a fang/claw and thought they were awesome. Got the red glow to double the awesome look. Later on I got an actually decent melee weapon and was looking to glow it up, but I didn’t have mats. I asked an enchanter if he could disenchant my gray, glowing daggers to get the mats... i learned a lot that day.
---
Everything you'll see on Reddit about Activision is a conspiracy theory. BFA being poorly received has nothing to do with Activision, the devs just made a bad game, there's nothing more to it.
---
I've been in a dungeon group where 2 friends decided to need for one of them and screwed over a solo player, that shit was infuriating and people should not experience that. 
---
A "blacklist" was never a good solution to this and it shouldn't be needed at all.
---
when people talk about "viable" its usually whether that role gives more than it takes away by occupying a slot
---
and the clear answer for ferals is no
---
in a raid where everybody is equally equipped, prepared and skillful a feral is not viable
---
that being said you can still do every encounter without minmaxing every tiny bit and a more passionate feral is worth more than a shitty rogue who just wants epix dagger for pvp
---
How many fucking threads do we really need on this?
---
You must be really good at the game! But even though no one *has* to die in a dungeon run, it's a five-person effort and there are things that aren't under your control. Especially with pugs, you can't assume that things will go smoothly. Part of being a healer is deciding who to prioritize in a bad situation. Having a consistent rez to rely on will make a mediocre group waste much less time.
---
I’m looking to get into endgame tanking as a Night Elf, but I’ve heard that the sword/mace skill of humans leads to better threat per second. My question is how big of a difference this makes, and whether or not I might miss out on a slot because of it (could I overcome this with extra consumables?)
---
I always like this train of thought when collecting stuff. The problem is when I find a 6ft 2h axe in the boar that obviously has no place to carry it.
---
Would you pay a higher sub for classic due to the higher number of GMs required due to this? 
---
That won’t be true for ubrs pugs.
---
And it's unique. Your friend who already has one can't roll on it.
---
Shadowmeld is also very nice for PVP
---
I agree with those who would like Classic to be as close to Vanilla as it get, but I can see both sides of this topic.
---
I think we need to be a better community than what it is now for retail. We all will have our opinions on what Classic should be and what our expectations are, but we all are looking forward to it being an amazing social gaming experience, once again.
---
Will such things such as loot trading effect that group dynamic? I'm sure it will have some. As will most decisions Blizz makes towards Classic. I've accepted the fact that there are going to be tweaks and adjustments that we obviously have no control over. 
---
Would I like for Blizz just save themselves the headache, and release Classic as it once was? Absolutely. 
---
Who knows? Maybe loot trading entices more people to join guilds, make more friends, and to not be a loot ninja/whore. If I recall, being called either of those was very bad for your rep on your server. 
---
It is going to take a little time after launch for the real community to emerge. I for one am going to into this a positive attitude, an open mind, and understanding that it isn't going to be 100% the same game, but it can be another great gaming experience with friends.
---
Very much my fear as well. Vanilla wasn't perfect, by *any* means, but what we all want is an *authentic* experience. If Blizzard wants to implement changes beyond that, then do so in the modern game. Even as someone that *LOVES* the Transmog and Collections systems, those things simply are not part of what WoW originally was, and thus should be left out.
---
I usually tickle them to death, hitting them with my fists as a priest
---
If your goodies could use the item, they would roll need on it under any system.
---
The change most are worried about is the fact that groups of friends can need on items and trade them to their friends.
---
Let’s say you have a group of melee DPS that are friends and join up for UBRS, all but one already have Truestrike shoulders but decide to equip another pair so they can need on the truestrike for their friend. They now have multiple chances of securing the loot for their group without anybody knowing. 
---
It’s a bad system for vanilla when good items are so rare that this is actually a very efficient way of gearing up in pugs.
---
Not only that, but the *community* would hold them accountable. Remember, there were no name-changes, and ninja's would quickly find themselves pariahs that no one would play with.
---
Some changes are of course inevitable, like battle net integration (which seems to be a condition of classic wow’s production regardless) but that doesn’t mean that petitioning blizzard to minimize the changes is a poor course of action.
---
Didn’t the OP hint at this enough? It is clearly the remnants of a previously failed attempted at mincing the boar’a ass, and was stuck up there when that warrior died.
---
If you're expecting 100% true recreation of vanilla you will be very disapointed with classic. 
---
We're starting with 1.12 talents, items and balance changes, DM will be out on release, game will run on legion client with all of it's issues and so on.
---
So I'm really not sure where you're getting the whole "replica" thing. That was never promised.
---
I don't want any changes either, but it's either this or back to private servers... and I really don't want to go back to private servers.
---
A small dedicated group isn’t really plenty.
---
You need to drop the retail mindset to understand. In Classic you will play a class - not a spec or a role. You are expected to master your class specific niche and performing well at that is just as important as good healing/dps/tanking. A competent player will perform his/her niche role well and also perform well numbers wise. 
---
In the sense that “everyone needs to” learn to play their class properly - you are correct. Avoiding raid mechanics is not class specific (usually), so it could be placed in another category, although it could be argued that there are class specific ways of dealing with these mechanics that would also fit under “learning your class.”
---
You didn't play classic at release, or you played at very odd hours or you didn't pug much. It was very common at first, which is why blizzard added the need/greed option in a patch.
---
I’m not expecting a 100% true recreation of vanilla, but I would like it to be as close as possible.
---
For BGs Shaman is going to be a lot more fun. You have insane burst potential and can survive and heal very well.
---
Shadow Priest is great at 1v1 but kinda sucks at group PvP. You will spend all your mana every time you Rez to rebuff, then 30 secs drinking. Followed by going out of mana every single fight. Followed by more drinking. Not to mention in BGs, other teams can just dispel your dots. 
---
If you are heal spec as a priest you will be useful. But still not as fun/useful as shaman for BGs
---
The current issues with WoW are that the leads devs(and this has been the case since Wod) are apparently people who were promoted because of seniority not talent.  They consistently make bad design decisions and then don't fix them.
---
That will hopefully be less of an issue in Classic as they working of a known design.
---
Do you think this will affect current development of classic? As far as they have released, the classic servers seem pretty darn close to the original game.
---
This system promotes holding gear hostage in pubs, as well as changing the chance someone gets the bow. Why run an UBRS for Dal rend if more than 1 person in the group are friends? They now have a way higher chance than you of getting it. Before, if it was only you and 1 other who needed it, you had a 1:2 chance of getting it if it dropped. Now, if he has 4 friends in group, he has a 5:6 chance while you have a 1:6 chance.
---
Or, you now have people needing on bop’s they didn’t need them extorting the group for money. 
---
This system fixes the very small issue of having to open up tickets because master looter fucked up or someone misclicked, but it fosters a huge problem for the community, and that’s the selling point of vanilla. It’s not hardcore raiding or top notch pvp. It was the community dynamics.
---
That has a defensible explanation as well. 
---
Some boars are quite powerful, so powerful, in fact, that it killed the previous adventurer who attempted to collect it’s ass.
---
Now, boars are both ravenous and quit husky creatures. Occasionally, I too have found a 6ft axe rammed up a boar’s asshole; remnants of what must have been a doomed traveler’s attempts at collecting ass.
---
&gt; I mean, the point is that the Mage could need on the plate and trade it to his friend with this system, no?
---
If I'm not mistaken, when this system was implemented on live you couldn't need-roll on things you couldn't use. So, at worst, you would be able to loot-share with individuals of the same level of usability or lower.
---
Rogue to start if you want to raid on it so you can get your foot in the door early. It's such a popular and gear-dependent class, and you'll be competing with more classes for gear since fury wars and hunters and delusional ferals will happily roll on leather for pre-raid BiS. It means rogue has a somewhat longer lead-time to get raid ready. It's a class where you really don't want to show up late to the party.
---
&gt; who gank lowbies because they lose to other max-level players. 
---
Is there evidence for this, or is this just typical projecting, where you make them worse than they are?
---
I've personally seen all types of people ganking and camping lower levels, because from what I understand and can see, they like to kill anybody, as long as it's red. Be that low levels or high levels.
---
I don't disagree that kicks and blacklists can happen.
---
Master loot however is so much more easily spotted, you know when they turn the option on if you did not agree to those loot rules. The 4 friends also does not have to be in the same guild, and you won't *know* they are a group of friends, just that this is a pug.
---
The character that wins the loot can be an alt that no one cares about, and if they happen to win the loot roll, the other friends can play along saying what a ninja looter they are. The trade of the item can happen meanwhile, and then the mage is 'kicked.'
---
The raid loot selling thing? It's actually *way* harder to keep track of 39 different players and what loot they have and what loot they have won. It's not easy to keep track of unless you make a list of everyone and everything they have and should have gotten. That's a lot of work.
---
I hope you are very much right though, that it won't be an issue. But otherwise, I rather see this option *not* being added, and make "Game Master ticket fix" unavailable.
---
Exactly.
---
At best, use the Need-Greed-Pass system and lock people out of BoP items they cannot use. It's the same net solution as loot trading without being able to pass it to third parties. If some shit bag rolls need, guess what? He wouldn't have traded it to you anyways.
---
Loot trading is garbage.
---
Stopped reading after Arathi @33. What a joke 
---
There's a difference between asking them not to change X and claiming that X will ruin the game. They never gave us their word that X would not be changed.
---
because they have almost no scaling power, in mc and wl because they have utility, but in naxx they have no utility and memespec tier dps
---
I like to believe the tomahawk axe that buzzard was carrying when i first started playing was out for vengeance against Tauren players.
---
Just a caveat, I'm neither defending nor attacking either having or not having loot trading. I'm just looking for some clarification.  
---
In "Classic" WoW, if someone "accidentally" needed on an item they didn't really need. A GM ticket could be opened and the item given to the proper player, yes? In this instance, someone could easily bring a friend, have them loot it, then trade it to them through a GM ticket. Which is essentially the same issue, but the GM ticket took longer, and was more tedious.  
---
In that instance, you wouldn't know it was on purpose, as there was no way to reverse the ninja. Just an "Oppsie! Oh well, I guess I'll vendor it" incident.  
---
Now, if loot trading is an option, a ninja loot could be called out during the dungeon itself, rather than just chalk it up to "an accident". A mage loots a plate item, while it's an accident, you can at that point either have them trade it, or call out their bullshit right there and then.  
---
Am I missing anything?  
---
Honestly, if you're worried about "the social atmosphere of the original game", that can't be brought back no matter what. People who want to play Classic WoW are the ones that played it back in 2004/2005. We aren't the same people we were 14 years ago. Some have grown, changed, matured (maybe). You're not going to get the exact community you did then.  
---
I don’t deal with mediocrity.
---
If you wanna heal in pvp that priest is basically the only "pure" healer in pvp.
---
Spriest can melt peoples face.
---
Ele shaman can melt peoples face.
---
Enh shaman is a meme spec for rng videos.
---
It all boils down to:
---
U wanna be pvp healer: Priest
---
Melt people face in premades: Shaman
---
Melt peoples face in pugs: Priest
---
Shadow is great in BGs. You can always switch out to heal if needed. And you melt face
---
I don't know how accurate the information is (my guess is he seems to know what he's talking about) but I saw this awhile ago.
---
https://youtu.be/8YCBd1VZVb4?t=1006
---
wrong, read up on it before posting.
---
&gt;And no, for you fallacy lovers, this is not a "slippery slope fallacy". That would only be the case were there not a reasonable expectation of the pattern continuing
---
I could easily argue that now that we've seen it play out once and go too far in the opposite direction, we can find compromise in the middle rather than your all or nothing approach.
---
Amazing how so many of us had this similar experience, lol. I thought it was the coolest thing ever having a glowing red weapon
---
Can you point me towards any evidence that isn't just some massive conspiracy theory then? The devs like the more RNG focused loot system 
---
You obviously don't even understand the loot trading scam. Read one of the many posts explaining it before writing any more ignorant novel-length replies.
---
Having played both, the actual difference in raid difficulty seemed negligible. From the viewpoint of a dps mong in server top 3 horde side and server first alliance side.
---
What actually matters is finding the faction that feels right for you, aesthetically and thematically. I always felt out of place on alliance side. The faction you play should feel like home if you want the best experience, no matter the theoretical advantages or disadvantages. Much like picking a race and class.
---
The thing is, you are inventing scenarios that don't actually happen. If a couple friends are doing ubrs for dalrends, they will simply reserve the weapon.
---
Why would they go through all this work for a slightly higher chance to successfully ninja an item when they could just reserve it. Or kick you from party when rend is at 20%, or use master looter, and have a 100% chance of getting the sword if it drops.
---
What's the difference? They generate it, because people are buying it.
---
It’s cata levels right now. Which apparently is what they are gonna do with WoW. Scale til it gets crazy do another squish. Rinse and repeat.
---
No. No one's going to inspect everyone to check that they don't have better gear already and sometimes it isn't clear what's bis, or you could say it's for you main spec. Then it's "safe" to roll for your friend.
---
And misclicking was very rare.
---
The classic experience
---
http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/1378947935277.jpg
---
hell yeh. im forming teams of ninjas. literal teams. we all gonna roll need on EVERYTHING - then extort the player who actually needs it for gold. then group squelch to silence them
---
So a whole group of friends can get blacklisted at once? Why not just get lead, switch to masterloot? 
---
It was up its ass.
---
Also, consider beached sharks, dolphins, etc. They often have odd man made objects in their stomachs.
---
But they can have a different item and pretend they need it. It's really not that hard to see how this system can be gamed.
---
You can literally do this with the current system in place.  The only difference is that you need to create a GM ticket to transfer the item and say you mistakenly rolled on the item.
---
The best way around this is joining a guild and running dungeons with them.
---
This is exactly correct.
---
I haven't played on private servers, but I played an Enh shaman extensively in Vanilla, both in PvP and raiding through most of Nax, and this pretty much lines up precisely with my memory.
---
The whole point is that you will never know that it happened if you don’t keep an eye out or actively keep a look out on their armory.
---
Why are you using other threads as a pretense to spam your boring, monotonous videos? Literally no one gives a fuck about some old guy waxing on about his memories from a game we all played. That’s why your vids have like 10 views each. Imagine not realizing this. Holy autism. 
---
You could do this in vanilla it just took longer. Send GM ticket I rolled need on accident and xxxx(your friend) also rolled need and it should go to them. Boom your friend gets the item just takes a day.
---
Anyone lose loot in raids cause of miss loot? Because i remember one of our hunters running around with Azuresong mageblade because he was right above the mage in his group and the master looter clicked the wrong name. Loot trading honestly is fine because mistakes will happen this is the only change that honestly makes sense. This is coming from a no changes at all guy.
---
Ya every dev across ALL their games want them to be shallow, gambling simulators you right, what was I thinking.
---
The difference will be 100k in 24 hours vs 10x or more the first 24 hours on probably 1/3 the servers. 
---
That’s not a barely playable game that’s a fucking horror show. Pservers are bad at launch and they don’t get close to that much attention. They don’t even get close to vanilla wow attention.
---
You know I tried this, it will be given to the second highest roller, not the person you want the item to go to. It’s either that or you keep it.
---
And thank you for not being able to win a BG since WoD kek 
---
Leveling up to 60 is around 200 hours. Anyone who levels up an alt just to go into ubrs once and try to roll for something they can't use had earned it. Most likely, they won't even win the roll, and they just threw away a month of real life time.
---
My friends and I will be rush leveling as a group of 5 so we plan on running instances (we're practicing them now). They can vary from huge timesinks to really efficient quest zones depending on your preparation. For the warrior and rogue in the group, getting the really good blue items will be a real boon for the rest of the leveling that goes on outside the dungeons.
---
I mean its opinion and hypothesis but no "conspiracy theory"... We know Activision merged with Blizzard and we know what business model Activision have.
---
Faction based pop cap?
---
I'm genuinely asking for evidence that this is all being pushed by Activision, shouldn't be that hard if you think I'm wrong 
---
Removed due to repost (left the other with the proper link).
---
Tried it where?
---
You don't get it: you just said it's bis. If your friend can roll on band, it means they don't have one. It's unique. So they are giving up their bis to pass to a friend, who cares. Under any system they would roll and won the item. Under no scenario do you win it.
---
I mean they technically own Blizzard so they run it?? 
---
You don’t see the difference in generating gold or botting gold? Both are bad but generating gold is way worse for an in game economy. Other gold is earned (although not always through noble means) generated gold means that the inflation occurred instantly and drastically.
---
Outland EU on live servers during vanilla, item in question was a dagger from ZG.
---
Ah, what a naive thought. Nobody is going to inspect you, lol.
---
When you join a group, people who want the same loot as your class will pretty much always inspect you to see if you are likely to be rolling on the drop they want. Unless of course they are over geared and don't care.
---
6 ft axe up a board ass when the boar is about 4 ft in length. Where the other 2 ft?
---
Show me the shark that had an object larger than the shark inside it please.
---
The merge happened in 2008 though, the game has generally been great since, it's only being brought up now because people don't like the game
---
I mean, you can do high mythic+ keys.
---
i had a professor who used to say 70% was just showing up.
---
the other 30% is stance dancing.
---
If it's a bis item and they don't have it, they need it. That is what best in slot means- everyone needs it.
---
This. I swear I'm the only person who experienced scummy guilds doing this without the system in place, you would just create a ticket and say "I accidentally needed, can you transfer to x" then the GM would move the item. It's a shitty game play tactic that happened in Original WoW and is probably going to happen in Classic, just make sure you tell the community about their actions so people know not to play with them, the guilds that did that ended up falling apart and dying.
---
Its viable to clear all raids with less than 40 players so yes, anything is "viable" but would a guild bring a enh shaman instead of a rogue or warrior? Probably not.
---
Hmm I understand the sentiment, honestly though it does feel really bad when you're in a pug and some guy just rolls need on everything and doesn't say a word
---
Holy crap that guy is stressful to watch with his random screaming. But the video is a good demonstration of the considerable difference in difficulty between the two versions of the game.
---
And?
---
Warrior tank rolls need on blue 2 hander. If you don't watch his armory, you will never know if he actually uses it or just vendors it.
---
Rogues had some class quests there. I vividly remember farming oozes for some items, and later going into ST. 
---
&gt; Can someone fill me in on how Activision made BFA  fail
---
They didn't.
---
 People just want a scapegoat for awful content/expansions. The same way that Tencent doesn't fuck up Path of Exile or League of Legends, they're still internally being run by the same people and having about the same freedom, that's how it normally goes and there's honestly no reason as to why it should be any different in this case. There's no real evidence that Activision is fucking this up for us or the players, the only thing people see is the state of WoW and whatever 'new' happened to the company(s), compared to when they look back at old expansions they liked. And they see Activision. The funny thing is that they forget that Legion was made my Activision Blizzard as well, and it's regarded as one of the better expansions.
---
Some items are merely okay or a lateral move for some classes, not something you actually need need for prebis. That is the case with band of rumination, every caster can make great use of it but it's only prebis for Paladin. This system invites people to pretend like they're making a lateral move while actually rolling for a friend.
---
You really told them...
---
A merger =/= ownership.

Ah, a condescending douche. Have fun with your life.
---
Do you just argue for the sake of arguing? 
---
If a tank rolls on a sword that nobody else needs nobody cares, if he rolls against a warrior that needs the sword people will care and single the tank out and question his choice. 
---
If 3 people that can use the sword and all roll for it then trade it to the tank you will never know that you’ve been finessed out of the item, this system allows that.
---
If people are scummy like that, they will roll on a "lateral" item with need anyway, because they can vendor or disenchant it.
---
Nothing wrong with being wrong, but you should try to learn from the experience.
---
&gt; The change most are worried about is the fact that groups of friends can need on items and trade them to their friends.
---
Easy fix.  To loot trade within the group, it requires four people to vote "Yes" on the trade.  Items have a five minute trade window.
---
That kind of synergy is what makes the game rewarding. 
---
It’s similar to rereading a good book, or rewatching a film, you realise that the initial run was littered with clues and gems. 
---
A casual run through Felwood, or Azshara, and someone who knows nothing, or is used to being handheld through cutscene games like CoD, will see nothing of interest. 
---
But those who invest the time, will be rewarded. Azshara is full of little treats. 
---
&gt; Basically, tanking dungeons is stressful 
---
yeah, I'm 30 feral, 21 resto with a dps set, tank set and heal set.  I hate tanking for that reason
---
As a software developer, I can tell you that people get promoted to lead positions because of seniority and not because of talent all the time. It sucks.
---
If I joined a group with 4 warrior/ret paladins and I get upset because I didn't win a two-handed sword, I only have myself to blame. Incidentally, it also means I was either trying to ninja loot the sword as a druid, priest, or holy paladin. What a terrible example.
---
Can you come up with an example that actually makes sense?
---
main hunter, ez gold for alt toons makes lvling a breeze, tfw u crit gankers with fiery weapon enchant and 1 shot them, best feeling ever. possible to get to lvl 10 in under 1 hour with 2 fiery weapons 
---
Hell to the no.
---
I wouldn't join a PUG unless it's equal rolls for everyone. Otherwise it's just a giant waste of time. The whole reason I'm running this instance is for some better loot, not to help the group out so a small number of people can keep everything.
---
Terrible fix that will never happen. It’s this system or the old one that are on the table. 
---
Well Nokrai, the handle obviously got bent by the power of the boars anus upon incision.  As you pull the axe out, head first the shaft must retake it's original shape on the way out. Duh. 
---
night elf is the best race for warrior, other than all the other ones.
---
Haha, glad I wasn't the only one who noticed. This list is trash.
---
I expanded or your terrible example, if you want a good example read my first comment again.
---
This makes sense for hearts and heads etc, but it doesn't account for cases where you need to collect paws, sure sometimes I might damage a paw, but that still leaves 3 of them intact.
---
Yep, easily one of my favorite zones when I play Ally
---
The warrior can equip a shield mid-fight. The same way pure DPS warriors can throw on a shield and pickup not all -- or even all phases of -- bosses. With two clicks the you get shield block. Anything with a stun phase -- or even white damage from the boss -- tanks are begging for rage and it's just more efficient to have the tank hitting with two arms and the healer pick up the pace than have the tank wait around for rage and have [his] healer start DPS'ing.
---
 
---
Are you deliberately obtuse, it's obvious the system can be gamed. Either that or you just really want to argue.
---
This situation does happen. Very often groups of friends will just happen into pugs, and not just start their own. Or, especially after the initial rush through, no one will join if they reserve dal tends because at that point it’s the only reason for anyone to run UBRS.
---
This kind of stuff with definitely happen. They are adding a system that will have issue, and has potential to have become a huge problem, just so that the GM team doesn’t have to look at a couple tickets each day. The potential issue far outweighs the slight benefit that will occur.
---
This is why they initiated loot trading though.  They didn't want GM time taken up with this anymore.
---
I just love the jungle. Booty Bay is still my favorite place in the game
---
Silithus isnt empty or useless though.  Especially once the AQ War Effort stuff begins.
---
You're terrible.
---
How common is this really going to be?  Show me a group of 4 people running this dungeon over and over to do this in a pug.
---
Reality is that 2 of those folks who already got the shoulders are now busy running DM for their other BIS, oops sorry friends #3 and #4, good luck to you.  Or otherwise by the time they reach a critical mass of people invested enough to run this over and over to ninja-loot-trade they're doing a non-pug run anyway.  The people who care this much are not casual, and they have better ways to do this.  Why risk being branded a ninja and blacklisted when you can take those same three friends and make your own group and reserve whatever item it is?
---
Meanwhile you were already going to have to roll against 4 other people for those damn shoulders or Dal'Rends anyway, that's why we ran these damn dungeons a dozen freakin times each.
---
Will it happen?  Sure, but folks here make it sound like this is how every dungeon group is going to work.  Have a little faith in the community, believe it or not most people aren't total dicks.
---
yes, faces will be melted
---
Duh... man I knew I was missing something
---
I think it's because year by year blizzard becomes more like Activision. I have yet to hear even once how the Activision side has become more like blizzard.
---
A group of people coordinating to gear a specific individual isn’t a pug by any definition, and such a group could accomplish the same thing via master loot
---
What I do is bind defensive stance and berserker stance to mouse scroll. They are quick and easy for stance switching for the fear immunity. Also knowing the timing of when the fear is going to happen is important.
---
=(
---
Mage too. You get to teleport up to Xylem's tower, it's really cool
---
Rush boss, IMO.
---
In the original raids it's not going to happen. You will be on the bottom of dps charts plus you have no threat reduction. If you do get aggro from some burst damage you have mail without the massive hp and defense that plate has. You'll almost certainly die before a tank can regain the aggro and that's just trash mobs. Bosses will guarantee one shot you. 
---
No matter what kind of raiding guild you join I guarantee they all will eventually want to progress. I saw many casual guilds turn into serious raid guilds over time. When people are at end game they want to do end game content. 
---
What people seem to be forgetting is that guilds aren't just 40 people. Most guilds in the day were closer to 60 raiding members not including alts/low level chars. If they want to progress you aren't just wasting a spot. You are taking a spot from someone else who wants to go and can do more damage than you. The sad reality is you are going to have a hard time even doing 5 mans as enh. It was clear that Blizz intended for shaman to heal in vanilla.
---
Yeah I'll go find the article about Activision's shitty take over of general game direction, use your brain man do you really need a journalist to tell you what's obvious?  
---
I mean I'm all on board with blaming Blizzard for their shitty decisions but I also know what Blizzard USED to be so maybe I'm just stupid thinking after the old guard left (Chris Metzen/Mike Morhaime) that there was a radical change in how business was conducted at Blizzard.  
---
HotS getting put on life support, tone deaf responses to game releases, tone deaf responses to game fixes.   If you want to give a blind eye to it, that's your prerogative.
---
It's quite obvious. BfA have been a dumpsterfire while the classic panel did nothing but show they understand our concerns and their stances are the stances the community wanted to begin with. There's like a total of 2 controversial topics and both have been given good arguments. The argments obviously aren't perfect since people are still against it, but that's a lot more than what /r/wow is getting, which is why people here aren't as critical. Blizzard have yet to give us a reason.
---
I love snow zones!
---
First of all, you wouldn’t join a group that has master looter, or the item you need reserved. For those groups to fill they wouldn’t disclose that. So instead they have a group of people that are rolling for one person, while you think it’s fair game for all. 
---
Second of all it could be done in 5, 10, 20 and 40 mans. 
---
Your argument doesn’t hold because you’re under the impression that this system would only be in place in 5 man dungeons, even then this could be abused but it’s much more likely to happen in UBRS or raids.
---
I highly doubt that they would implement this system and not make master looted items tradeable as well
---
I never said it can't be gamed. You are confusing me with someone else or you are trying to create a straw man.
---
I don't remember to much other than I made a night elf druid. I have always been one for exploration and breaking games so I managed to jump out of the big tree. Struggled for the longest time to find my way back to mobs that's I could actually kill and didn't end up doing any quests for quite a while because I never found my way back to the starter area.
---
I was definitely a noob that didn't have a clue what I was doing and spent most of my time just running around exploring the world trying my best to avoid these high level skull mobs that would chase me forever it seemed. That was my highest character for the longest time and I only ever got it to leave 28
---
It wasn't until warth that I got a max level character, I had switched servers and was a warrior tank. I was terrified of raiding for some reason though and basically got best in slot from all the dungeons before I finally found a guild and did naxx for the first time. At some point I decided I wanted to try a warlock out. It was sometime after they added experience to BGs and I leveled all the way up doing almost exclusively bgs, occasionally I would jump into a dungeon to get a few pieces of gear. I found that I really loved warlock and eventually became the second best geared warlock on my server.
---
Since I never got to experience raiding in vanilla I'm super excited for the opportunity. 
---
Nice post about boar ass.  Quality shitpost
---
I am ok with changing item values (which they said they won’t do). However I don’t want them reverting all changes in hopes of giving a better recreation and end up with some pserver bastardized version of “blizzlike” authentic.
---
Any ability nerf or pet needs were done with talent changes in mind, so reverting those changes and not talents is bad. As far as just items go they pretty much can do w/e in my book. Again though they already said they aren’t touching the databases.
---
wat
---
A good feral druid who did his homework and farm Crowd Pummelers can 'easily' beat the lowest DPS of the 'meta' dps classes/specs out there and rival top-tier specs on certain bosses, especially on Patchwerk'ish bosses. It's been shown time and time again and feral druids are slowly but surely getting more and more accepted. 
---
ele burst is crazy, I like the 30/0/21 build. enh can be fun as well. I'd say shaman is more fun overall but can't go wrong with priest
---
No, they managed to run it just fine on $15 subs back when vanilla was out, the $15 can work now.
---
Yes, ninjas happen. You blacklist them and don't invite them again. Loot trading makes absolutely no difference here.
---
Most ubrs groups in classic, on blackrock USA, used  master looter, FYI.
---
Yeah I think he got it mixed with Desolace.
---
Great stuff.
---
Well that's just not true... It has been bis for 19 rogues in cata mop wod and main hand bfa. 
---
Yeah I didn't go into too much depth but that basically is it.  It can get more complicated, like spamming rank 1 shocks until clearcast procs, then max rank shock etc, but basically it is sit there, autoattack, wait for wf/crits, etc.  It is nice once you get 20%+ melee crit chance, flurry is almost always up so at least you have a buffed attack speed.  So there's that!  I valued crit beyond str in most cases to try and get at least 25% crit chance to make sure flurry is basically at 100% uptime.  But then I get wf procs early in the fight, ANd crits and pull aggro like a boss =P
---
I basically retired my character, still play rarely but I got a similarly geared Ret paladin.  Way more pvp utility (cleanse / blessings are way better than totems and purge) , very similar offensive PVP playstyle (hoping for crits/procs), and heals are 1000X better with blessing of wis, bless of light on the tank, and flash of light spam.
---
Shouldn't even call them Blizzard anymore.  Guaranteed, Activision will ruin Classic WoW because they are a totally different kind of business than Blizzard was; they will put profit above gameplay every time.  It's sad, as that was probably the best moment in gaming history, and they have to ruin it just to cash in on people's nostalgia...
---
you cannot have more than a single copy of a unique item.  
---
items are not unique-equipped in vanilla.  they are simply unique.
---
if you already have the item - in your bags, in your bank, anywhere - you cannot roll on it.
---
You mean where 5 people collude to join the same ubrs group just to cheat one player out of a sword, at the cost of their reputation?
---
Sorry, it's not a big deal. If you are doing ubrs for one item, a sword, and suddenly 3 rogues and two fury warriors join the group, all seemingly needing the same sword, you drop group. A: the group seriously lacks reliable cc, and ranged dps, will probably fail to even reach rend B: whether there is a scam going on or not makes zero difference: you are going to be rolling against 5 people for your sword. Not worth it, find a balanced group.
---
It's as if gamer culture changed between 2004 and 2019.
---
I don't. But that's really besides my original point. And you've said, both are bad and both inflate the economy.
---
Then GM will see your friend wasn't second on roll and give it to the other player.
---
Or they will see it's the third time it happened and will stop answering to these "accidents"
---
Right but.. if you're running with a bunch of friends in the first place, you're going to get the item anyway, because they're going to pass and let you have the item. I don't see any situations where this becomes a problem in 5 mans, and raids use ML anyway.. 
---
Night elf warrior here since vanilla. Racials matter, just very little. Human and Dwarf are better. I can tell you, if you're a good tank no one is ever going to say they're not inviting you because you're a nelf. They may make fun of your choice but just flip around infront of them and change their mind.
---
The number of players doesn’t matter, the fact that you could be facing these unfair odds due to a system that Blizzard implements to save money is the problem. YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT THEY CHEATED YOU, their reputation will never be effected. 
---
You could have 3 melee and 2 of them are colluding to cheat you out of an item, that is not okay. 
---
Oh hi Denny 
---
Quality in the context of a videogame is still subjective to an extent. Graphical quality is entirely down to what aesthetics you do and don't value. Gameplay quality revolves around your enjoyment of a mechanics system. People love the Dark Souls gameplay but many people would equally be put off by it's gameplay mechanics. 
---
You just sound like a conspiracy theorist. I believe the devs simply made a bad game and are out of touch, I've politely asked for you to provide evidence to suggest otherwise, and the best you can say is 'use your brain, it's so obvious'
---
Wow!!
---
Wow subscription is decreasing in price due to inflation. 15 dollars in 2005 is worth about 20 today. You have already been getting a discount. Someone's gotta pay for those GMs you're insisting on right?
---
Have you heard of the tactic to have heals/range DPS stand on the cannon nearby?  
---
Tank focuses on VC, adds get "heal aggro" but glitch out because they cannot path to the healer.  once VC is dead, healer can jump over and tank can taunt one add, healer jumps back and rest glitch out again, and group can do one add at a time. 
---
You couldn't need roll on thing you couldn't use only if it was a group created by the dungeon finder (and paladin couldn't roll on cloth also). You could still need on everything if it was a group created by someone.
---
Sharding has nothing to do with cross realm stuff, they are two completely different things, stop perpetuating the confusion.
---
dailys was one of the bad additions tho..
---
\&gt;This was disappointing clickbait written by someone with no real love for classic, and with nothing interesting to say. 
---
Just summarised half of the comments and posts on this sub.
---
It was tbc, overload wasn't a thing until then. And it didn't really get good until WotLK, where it went from 20% chance to 33%
---
Alright then, in what ways do you think it can be gamed? I'm not confusing you with anyone, I just saw you trying to counter everyone else's examples.
---
My thought has always been that a drop like that should always be partnered with a broken version, combined to 100% drop rate. 
---
...because it is, and you sound like someone who can't think for himself, so this is a pointless conversation at this point, as you can POSSIBLY fathom my point and I can sort of yours, because since you disagree with it and I can't prove a negative congratulations bud you win the argument.
---
I can tell you never played classic. You absolutely know. There is no cross realm. There is no looking for group. You quickly get to know the people you group with, and the guilds they are in. Even on absurdly overpopulated private servers this occurs, but it'll be that much more apparent on real blizzard servers.
---
If you don't want to know, you won't, but that is your fault. 
---
I am going to be a warrior and honestly can't decide. I know there are advantages to each of the factions. I have my own even. I would love to do dual pvp with a paladin, which would require me to be alliance.  I would probably be human because I dislike gnomes and dwarves don't offer as much as humans. It seems tanking can be fun for both factions in different ways, so I can't decide on that either. On the other hand, orcs are freaking amazing and I would love to play one, especially for PvP reasons, but DPS seems to be more fun as them as well. I don't know. I might have to level them both to see what I want to play in classic. 
---
Note: If you want to help me, I am sure I didn't summarize the stuff well enough.
---
&gt;The raid loot selling thing? It's actually   
---
&gt;way  
---
&gt; harder to keep track of 39 different players and what loot they have and what loot they have won. It's not easy to keep track of unless you make a list of everyone and everything they have and should have gotten. That's a lot of work.
---
Most good DKP systems keep track of that stuff. Who bought what and when. You know, for accountability.
---
 I really do have to agree with AngryWriter. As long as servers are a permanent population (no sharding), this loot sharing thing will be minimal. Every time a player does it, they risk being exposed for being a ninja looter. Perhaps they get away with it one or even 5 times, but it will catch up to them. I think most players would be kept honest by there being a consequence.
---
If the gm see your friend wasn't second on roll, he will not give it to your friend.
---
If the gm see that an "accident" already happened multiple times, maybe he will stop answering your requests.
---
Too bad the game is now in maintenance mod.
---
I'd recognize that AssCandy anywhere. 
---
What I think you're missing is that GMs would be able to spot patterns, so if one character was doing this all the time, maybe they get told no, or get a ban if it was bad enough
---
no loot trading, no item restoration from support. Problem solved
---
Just try to play on wotlk private servers and you will see shit like that happen everywhere.
---
You join a pug where 40% of the raid needs on the item you need, you just leave. No one's forcing you to stay. Or, if you're so afraid of ninjas, just play with your friends and guildies. They'll be willing to farm your items if you're willing to farm theirs. 
---
Not at all. From experience, you can do it constantly. The odds of you getting the same GM twice are already exceptionally slim, but of that GM remembering you specifically out of the hundreds of tickets they answer a day?
---
My brother and I abused the loot trading mechanic last time we leveled on retail when dungeon finder was the fastest way to level. He was tank and I was healer. So whenever one of us needed a piece of gear, the other would roll need also to increase the chance of one of us winning and then just trade it to them. Hate to say it but this will be happening in classic. Bring a buddy.
---
I've very much thought for myself, I've explained the conclusion I came to, you clearly want to persuade me otherwise you wouldn't have replied to me. If it's so obvious why can't you link me any hard evidence?
---
Thorns + Imp fire shield and you're returning absurd chunks of damage with every hit.  Give druid a health stone regularly too and bam, you've got an extremely durable way to AOE mobs.  Not SUPER effective in groups, but in dungeons hoo baby.  Druid can tank and will never lose aggro unless he goes afk!
---
Entirely party dependant, if the rest of the bosses have gone down quick then nuke boss, otherwise kill at least one add to make healers life easier
---
I understand that loot trading is a major change in the social dynamic that can lead to a ***different*** type of abuse not present in classic...
---
But is there and reason we couldn't meet at the middle and say: 
---
*If the group is on master loot, then whoever recieves the item has the 'loot trade' option, but* ***only*** *with the master looter.*
---
This way if something accidental happens and it needs to change hands, ONLY the master looter can redistribute it, which is why GM loot tickets happen in the first place.
---
He’s just going to keep ignoring your point because they don’t have a valid response.
---
Without question a Mage. Very powerful.
---
Those are both valid points that I had not thought about. Thanks!
---
That is an excellent point. I would hope that GMs would look at past histories of these requests to see patterns. Thanks!
---
That'd get you kicked in vanilla.
---
But they’ll have the moral high ground...
---
&gt; One way is to put a short timer on the BOE item (like 5 minutes) which when expires the item is soul bound.
---
BO5M (bind on five minutes) is stupid. It's a world epic. Everyone roll need. 
---
Lose the roll? Want the item? Offer to buy it off the guy then and there.
---
I believe Blizzard's quality has gone down since the merger of Activision. It took some time, but most of the original leadership and devs are gone now. Blizzard is now beholden to stock holders in the first place, not players (which was true when it was still a private company). Stock holders want to see year on year profits, but this has some problems with game development. It's very hard to crank out a game every year - or perhaps a game (or expansion) might be released while it's not really ready yet. So micro-transactions might seem to be a good way to earn extra income (and personally I feel for a game like Hearthstone that's a good fit). Another way to increase profits is by lowering costs and ways to achieve this could be paying devs less, removing bonuses, lay off people, etc… I believe it will be very hard to change the companies' DNA back to what it once was, unless Blizzard somehow could become a private company.
---
I don't think that's going to work on classic with the new client and all
---
&gt; lock people out of BoP items they cannot use
---
So how do I farm enchanting mats then?
---
You know blizz saves your past tickets and when you open a new one the gm can see all the old ones.
---
It will not be about the drop - it will be groups of friends or guildies paying for their consumables each week needing on key BiS BoPs that drop in pugs and selling them back to fresh 60s.
---
Yeah certainly, but then you have to wait another undisclosed amount of time for another player when you're already in the dungeon. It's a sticky situation. Fortunately for me is that I will have a group of 5 leveling with me so the 5 man dungeons will be no problem 
---
Maybe it's just me but I would never pick a race/class/faction based on anything but what resonated with me. I played a tauren (mostly) dps  warrior and dwarf dagger rogue and never was my choice of race ever an issue in a raid setting. Even in, for the time, about as tryhard guilds that were around.
---
Forget about advantages because they are so small it doesnt actually matter.
---
The biggest problem I have seen brought up with this system was from a MadSeason video where he mentioned this scenario:
---
Say there are 3 guildmates who want to run a dungeon and pug 2 players to have all 5, then as they are running the dungeon, loot drops that one of the guildies REALLY wants, so what do they do? Instead of JUST the guildie who needs it clicking “need”, the other 2 guildies do as well - this significantly increases the chances that one of them will get it and then trade it to one of the guildies who needs it, effectively ninja-looting an item as a group.
---
You could STILL do this under the old system by opening a ticket, but it was a hassle. Removing this hassle makes it more enticing for dungeon “pals” to betray the group for the benefit of their friend.
---
Aside from that, I don’t see any other issues with it. As someone pointed out - it will expose the players who “accidentally” needed a BoP item, as they will now be able to trade the item hassle-free if it really WAS an accident. And if not, you’ve outed a ninja and his server rep will suffer.
---
/bow
---
Sorry, I should have specified. Lock them out of need rolls.
---
The sad truth is actually Heroes of the Storm still gets much more events and updates than WoW. The past 3 months of WoW have had literally nothing. The new raid will come out soon, excitement for a few weeks, but then months and months of nothing.
---
Im sure the new raid will make WoW not dead for a week or two. Cheer up! :D
---
I would pay - I spent more on lunch today. As an adult with a real job 15 dollars is nothing.
---
So a warrior can ninja on every armor ever.
---
If I haven't trained polearms, and one drops, would I be banned from needing? Seems silly.
---
All these discussions have done is prove to me that A) original loot system was fine; and B) Loot trading as implemented around Wrath will be fine.
---
All other proposed changes have ripple effects across the rest of the game.
---
It's possible for 2 30 warriors to kill it, the boss is hamstringable so just juggle threat, keep it slowed, kite, and bring lots of silk bandages
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
idk in which patch this was implemented, but a mage can't roll on a plate item.
---
I’m the one that’s going to abuse this system with my guild and for my alts. I’m just saying that it’s a terrible system for the dynamics of vanilla, it shouldn’t be there. I won’t suffer from it, I will flourish with it and that’s bad. 
---
The new raid will bring in some more people for a few weeks. Cheer up friend!   :D
---
I can't speak from experience for Activision, but i can for Tencent.  Tencent does this thing where they force game devs to make changes they want to fit their own clientele, despite what the game's core and majority clientele want.  If the devs don't obey, they threaten to pull their funding and support from the game.  They have forced some really shitty changes on some really otherwise good games.
---
 not at alll viable.
---
even if you farm infinite crowd pummelers, you'll still fall behind a rogue geared in greens who is afk half the time.
---
want to dps? roll a dps class. 
---
&gt; it's not like we have emails or statements from activision actually telling blizz to make the mistakes they have.
---
No, but we do have interviews with multiple anonymous employees talking about it, so it's not 100% unfounded.
---
I understand you and I actually want to do that, but the thing is, neighter Human or Orc trully "resonate" with me into such an extend for me to say "Wow I need to play that!". I am a dwarf-kind of a person, but honestly, I don't really want to play a dwarf at all for some reason. I would legit be sad if I would play one. I don't consider playing anything else but the three races. As I said, I will probably level them both and see which one I like better. It's "Lok'tar Alliance" for now.
---
&gt; The only difference is that you need to create a GM ticket to transfer the item and say you mistakenly rolled on the item.
---
This is what I always see as a defense but *nobody* has claimed that they've actually done this. As far as I'm aware, GMs never got involved in loot disputes unless it was stolen mats before the new crafting interface.
---
If a warrior ninjas everything, they will get ostracized, just like back in Vanilla. And guess what? If they hit need on everything, they still won't fucking trade it to you.
---
Just put the threshold to class usage instead of immediate training.
---
You can roll need on things you don't need. This is true under either system. That is how they can both be "gamed". However, it's not a problem unique to they game with loot trading "added"

---
Tencent is usually looking for western games not having made it into the asian market yet. And since Tencent knows the asian market, they'll buy their way into these games and 'control' the asian version of the game. Which is why League of Legends and Path of Exile for example, are different in terms of MTX, prices and what not, while balancing and just in general the core game is still in the original owner's control.

I played feral DPS for the majority of vanilla. When I could convince a raid to bring me in (once a raid was on farm status and I also had utility like LoTP), I could do decent but not great DPS. I had a hard time getting into raids though, everyone wanted me to heal and they felt the leather drops should go to rogues first. As for my DPS, I could only keep up to a evenly geared rogue if I was trying my hardest and making a perfect rotation, and if he was slacking. If we were both going hard, I could only get to like 75% of his DPS. Granted, I did bring LoTP, rebirth, Tranquility, MoTW, and I could off tank when needed. So as long as raid leaders are open minded about lower DPS but added utility, I would say go for it. 
---
And you'll be playing with people who think fucking over other people for personal gain is a good idea. What could go wrong? I won't abuse the system and won't play with people who abuse the system because I'm not a giant dick, and I expect my friends to not be giant dicks. 
---
Looking for group doesn't exist in classic. What you doing is called ninja looting. I am sure people will do it on classic, but they will be blacklisted and avoided.
---
We're all terrible here
---
You people are under the impression that you would ever know if you got fucked over, you wouldn’t. Your solution is to never join a pug, that’s fine. It’s a solution for the individual but a system that forces that is bad. How can you not agree with that?
---
Is this for PC only?? 
---
Looks interesting 
---
I'd skip Whirlwind on a fresh server. No point in putting that much work into it just to keep it a few levels and replace it with Bonebiter. No whirlwind at 30 when there's no one to sell you the mats or kill the trolls for you. 
---
Ya its a free to play for PC.
---
Yes, you are missing some subtle differences. 
---
While possible, I would wager a significant number were dissuaded from using GM tickets to ninja-loot - due to the real or perceived risks of the transaction being investigated and resulting in punishment. Also, the fact that it was longer and more tedious contributed to discouraging abuse.
---
If loot trading as described is added into the game now - it will make ninja looting with 2-3 others a viable way to farm gold - by rolling on pre raid BiS gear and selling it back to PuGs. Plausible deniability will be maintained by equipping a shittier piece in key slots prior to the run. It can also be used to gear guildies/friends/ alts. If it become profitable and widespread enough gear selling in PuGs will become the norm.
---
To regularly and easily detect this behavior would require an armory linked addon with the ability to track previously equipped items. 
---
So far I have not heard an intelligent response to this outside “hurr that won’t happen.”
---
I always just... accepted it as part of game design that made sense for an rpg and moved on.
---
How many items with spell hit do you have prior to zul'gurub? 0-2? Casters are complete trash before they get spell hit from Bloodvine set from ZG patch
---
Except in practice this didn't happen. People abused the system all the time, and the GM only cares that the person that has the item wants to give it to the other player and the other player was there for the kill. 
---
This is a change that may not be the best option, but it's going to be in. GM's spent a ton of time fixing loot problems, and now this system saves them a ton of time. Also it didn't generate nearly the problems people describe when first implemented, and the fears are likely overblown.
---
Feral have to farm the gnome mace on top of consumables which mean they have to put more effort than other classes if they want to get the maximum dps possible.
---
A UBRS run I already had QS and the tank sword from ZG, it was PUG, I didn't need any gear and was DPS because they got a T2 Warrior who they made party leader. Last boss drops the 2hander which wasn't really good, and the War put it on ML. The hunter who was a fresh 60 wanted it, but damn if didn't just show up in my inventory because he wasn't going to give it to the hunter. And I was using a 2hander I got from AQ20. I felt bad DE it later because it was taking up space.
---
Different points of view, of course.  
---
A "personal PUG" can still get me something, if nobody else needs it, and anyway I still improve my weapons skills, so I might go in with something I still have to level, and take the chance to improve them.  
---
If I'm not yet at level cap, moreover, it's anyway XPs.
---
Here is what I think will happen. Blizzard will announce a list of servers by region and type. This will happen BEFORE the game is live. 
---
The community will then discuss where they are rolling. Streamers will make picks, big guilds will make picks. Polls will be created. Lots of info will be out there about people choosing realms.
---
At this point choose a realm based on your region; that fits what you desire based on all the discussion. 
---
People already sell bop loot drops on private servers. There is nothing wrong with it- if you don't want to participate, you don't.
---
Otoh, I think you misunderstand a lot of things. A two hour ubrs run that maybe sells a Dal rends for 30 gold split among 5 players... So 6 gold each... That is laughably bad. And if the group is selling other loot, good luck seeing it finish the run, people will quit after the first boss when warriors are rolling on cloth drops.
---
Tip: run strat live instead. Reserve righteous orbs. They sell for more money and the dungeon is easier to carry with fewer players.
---
The size of the server doesn’t matter when there is no way of telling if an item got stolen when abusing this system.
---
You’re the one that is making it painfully obvious that you have no idea what you are talking about, bringing private servers up that doesn’t even have the system implemented. 
---
It wasn't in the fucking game. Therefore it should not be in classic.
---
Should i really take staff of westfall instead of the chausses of westfall? Those pants are BiS until SM.
---
This post is so accurate! My brothers and I constantly got beastslayer on every new weapon! Until finally finally had the gold for fiery and icy enchants. Pretty sure I farmed some undead at lake kel’theril In Winterspring  everyday after school for the formula:icy chill for epic mount gold. Which I never got.. 
---
I'm sure they can, but they don't care. The system was heavily abused and nobody I have ever talked to about it ever had a ticket refused if both players wanted the item swapped (The guy who had it and the one he wants to give it to)
---
I have had the opposite result. The GM was more than willing to transfer the item to the person in our guild who wanted it. The only thing they cared about was that they were there for the kill. GM's do their own thing, and if you opened a second ticket and got a different GM it is just as likely they would have just transferred it. 
---
Another large part of this issue is if friends joined (say a hunter and a rogue) and one already had the piece of gear his buddy needed, he could just equip a different piece for that run and they would then have 2 rolls for the one piece of gear. The rest of the group would have no way to tell what was happening but would be at a manufactured disadvantage and be clueless to it. That, I think, is the worst effect of loot sharing.
---
Dunno if it is the same item, but there's a cloth helm tailors can craft which is like the red defiance mask, except it's white.
---
Before: You could identify every asshole by name, every time, there was just some level of deniability on their part.
---
Under loot trading: If two or three people collude to get the item away from you for one of them, with a little planning they could very easily get away with doing this without you ever being able to find out a thing.
---
Now, they could implement the system with rules that make this sort of thing impossible, but if they don't, it'll be guild runs or nothing. Which wouldn't personally hurt my game play experience at all, but the expansive community that Vanilla was known for will take a large step towards death before it's even relaunched. 
---
Referring to HOTS but retail fits the bill
---
They absolutely did fix loot issues back in the day.  In raids you just had to have both players make a ticket and the GM's would eventually get around to it.  It could take a few days, thus why they are changing it to the timed trading system to make loot corrections happen more quickly and to alleviate load on GM tickets.
---
No way of telling? You know, you can see what item a player had equipped. Are you just a troll or what? The only way there is "no way of telling" is if after trading the item, the guy who received it never groups again and never equips the item while in a major city. Even that isn't 100% safe.
---
Mage first. It will be much easier to level the mage when there aren’t any high level enemy rogues around. 
---
It’s also a better farm character which makes it easier to support leveling an alt. The typical profession choices for mages are more likely to benefit a rogue alt than the other way around. 
---
What do you mean, they're picking 1.12 because they feel it's the most complete version of vanilla and that includes questing.  Are you asking for further questing updates to be done beyond what was in 1.12?
---
Don't get me wrong there were still some weird gaps in questing and some odd itemization in 1.12 that I wouldn't mind seeing worked on.
---
Always kill the first two adds that are with van cleef at the start since they don't deshawn at the end and won't respawn if you wipe but killed them.
---
Then rush boss and try to cc adds.
---
Is the same thing as adderall lol
---
don’t unzip me 
---
Yep, it's tough to tell.  Anyone could probably test it in retail WC right now to see if the glitch works. 
---
If it doesn't work, then IIRC the best strat was to burn adds asap and have ideally any class that can (shaman, paladin dps, druid etc) provide backup heals or mana pot or something.  
---
If you can't hack it, then just zerg WC and kill him, die to adds, come back and loot =P
---
If loot trading goes live there will absolutely be groups of players that advertise PuGs for specific dungeons, roll relentlessly against the PuGs on pre-raid BiS under false pretenses, and make an industry out of selling it back to them privately. They can do all of this and maintain plausible deniability the entire time. It would also be vastly more entertaining than farming DM: E.
---
You’re wrong, thanks for playing.
---
So your solution is following all the players around until they equip the item? What if they log out, do something else and when you catch them they just say that they did another one and won it. There is no way of telling unless they are morons and instantly equip the item again. 
---
You’re so fucking stupid it’s painful.
---
In a full vanilla set...
---
Depends how some of their talents will work with certain weapon come classic.
---
Example, Ragnaros scaling with spell dmg/talents and the extent of it. Also, whether or not their spells trigger certain talents, etc...
---
On some prv servers shamans are literary competing with rogues/warriors.
---
Perhaps the difference was that you where in a guild? This was a pug and the Gm was very clear on pointing out that they didn’t want and foul play from our part, trying to cheat another player out of their item. 
---
Agreed. And even since Vanilla while the game design was much better than now, the art was still a big selling point. It really pays off to have such consistently high-quality art.
---
Have you ever tried a Flame Buffet/Flame Shock build?
---
A system (Loot Trading) in a social context (World of Warcraft) that does not take into account the social human dynamics should be considered an inferior system and is thus a problem.
---
The fact that orc warriors are by far the coolest looking is the most important factor.
---
Activision doesn't own Blizzard. 
---
He’s just triggered - he’s posting paragraphs all over this thread defending loot trading for some inexplicable reason.
---
The 2nd plant on the left side of the screenshot  looks like a dancing female pandaren. :O
---
Stop wasting your time.
---
Simply not true, in my guild we had loot trades denied on multiple occasions when players disconnected during looting and the normal mistakes, we even had one denied because a the player in question was flagged as afk at the time of kill, ALL denied.  In all of my time on retail only ONCE was an item actually moved after a ML error.
---
Sad but true. But it's okay, HotS is a really fun game imho
---
So you are saying that he equips it a few hours later, and you will start screaming "This guy's a ninja, He stole that!" and he won't reply with "Bullshit, I have been running UBRS to get these and I got them in a different group"? It takes just that little for your accusation to gain no traction and become a he said she said thing.
---
People are so sure that when they accuse someone of being a ninja the whole server will hear about it and blacklist that guy. In fact unless you have undeniable proof of wrongdoing, and sometimes even if you do, they will deny it, their buddies will back them up and nobody will care at all.
---
&gt; Literally the only reason they are including it is to save money on GMs and to me that means they're willing to compromise the experience to save money and I'm not convinced they won't do the same in other aspects we don't know about yet 
---
Honestly, I don't know why ever included having GM's move gear after a bad roll.  Just tell people who complain about not getting their gear that's WOW.
---
You think there won’t be name changes?
---
You don't seem to get this, and yet you are calling me stupid...
---
Players will do EXACTLY what you complain about without loot trading. Dal'rends vendors for nearly 6 gold. Unless you follow around the winner to make sure he equips his weapon, he could have just rolled it to vendor it, or d/e.
---
"There is no way of telling unless they are morons and instantly equip the item again."
---
See, your dumb. This is why you have a very simple rule- you roll need on an upgrade, you equip it and use it. If you don't, you are a ninja looter. So billybob rolls and wins the sword you want, sells it to chad, now billybob can't equip the sword and everybody knows he is a filthy ninja/seller.
---
The fact that you didn't realize the above reveals which one of us is actually stupid. I can understand your pain though, it does hurt to be thoroughly owned.
---
they did do it "occasionally" but in my experience I only saw ONE not denied and actually transferred the item
---
I think the way the retail ones are set up isn't that great, but the TBC dailies felt alright to me, especially since they weren't mandatory things, from what I remember anyway.  Like the netherwing dailies for the drake.  It's not some time gated rep grind, it's something to do for something extra.  Vs in retail where the dailies all wrap around the major faction reps. 
---
It wasn't just in guild groups. More likely you got a GM who either didn't want to do it or dug deeper than most. GM's are individuals, and I have seen people get told one thing by one GM, then make a new ticket and get a totally different answer from another.
---
I remember I logged in and immediately was drawn to the undead. I liked the zombie look and didn't see any point on being what I believed were the good guys, Alliance. I wanted to be dark and the warlock, with the imp by its side, with the ability to summon demons and cannibalise,  wow! I made my character as ugly as possible, wanted to look scary. Made him without a jaw, those leather things across the face a a green mohawk. It was very ugly. The name came from what I remember to be an inspiration from a yugi-oh card my cousins were obsessed with and the characters' names from Astérix and Obelix: Ozelix was born.
---
Since I played during night-time,  the starting zone was extra-scary, I remember being actually scared of the brainless zombies going around, and it felt awesome killing them. My friends were also starting to play, but we had a troll hunter, a tauren druid, a bloodelf pala and an orc warrior. So we were separated in the first levels until we all met in barrens and went on adventures together. We had basically a made group so we would run dungeons together at night and spend the next day in school talking about it. Eventually my friends started to quit around level 30-40 and in the end it was only me and the druid.  We made it all the way to 70 that summer until I eventually quit as I started taking more interest in girls and would never quit playing for wow, so I quit wow. Came back sporadically, like right now, but the memories are great. Leveling and exploring and fishing for deviate fish and running WC as pirates and ninjas, taking random team pictures in barrens and creating our own guild: The Granny Slayers. It was a blast because it was mostly about hanging out with friends in an amazing world, going on adventures.
---
It came to my attention, however, that even in that spirit, some of my friends felt some of us were too obsessed with reaching level 70, so they kind of got tired of it and quit... and got girlfriends. 
---
OP is spot on it’s not about whether it’s better or worse, it’s not classic. Graphical updates, loot all changes  and bnet integration were the thin end of the wedge. Small QOL changes which were broadly allowed to slide. Now it’s sharding and loot trading.  Next will be integrating quest helper, a group finder tool, and adding dual spec. See how this goes? It snowballs until it’s not classic. And honestly, if you trust blizzard 2018 to exercise self control here, well I’ve got some magic beans to sell you...
---
29 has been the most popular. Saw a mix of all classes I think warlock may be the least played though 
---
I think you missed the point of the OP's post.  It's not about a "better" system, it's about what's _authentic_.
---
Many of vanilla's core tenets are viewed by today's developers, according to Ion himself, as "bad" design choices-- some of which were only implemented for technical reasons, such as the debuff cap.  Despite this, they're keeping the debuff cap the way it was due to the gameplay dynamic it conveyed unto the game.
---
Every single one of vanilla's attributes, for better or worse, small and large, contributed to its identity and feel.  I am highly apprehensive about _any_ changes to that formula.
---
It'd be interesting if this was programmed in. If you overkilled a mob it lowered the drop % of a pristine hide. But that's an RPG like element, so I doubt it.
---
I'm sure that your anecdotal experience is way better than my anecdotal experience. Except that there are plenty of stories about how GM's were more than willing to transfer loot and it happened all the time. I'm sure that what you are saying is what happened to you, but that is not how all people were treated and clearly it was enough of a problem that blizz wants to put in a more automatic system.
---
Ok moneybags over here
---
IMO level 19 twinking is hands down the worst. Most of it is just shitting all over anyone who isn't a twink, and grueling, slow unfun combat against people who are. It's similar to people who corpse camp level 20's on their main, with how big of a power difference being full geared/enchanted is vs. not.
---
I've never made one, but 49 looks like it would be a really fun twink. Everyone has their mounts, most builds are complete, you have most or all of your toolkit, and people know their classes pretty well. It's basically level 60 pvp lite, without any of the ultra-geared AQ/Naxx/T14 60's running around massively outgearing 3/4 of each team.
---
It worked well enough for its time as designed.  Everything fits into its place fine enough, even if there’s a lot of stuff that is less than ideal. But Attempting to fix any issues would cause more problems than it is worth.
---
So the player with dal’rend will unequip it to roll on it so he can vendor it? Or will he openly ninja it for the entire group to see?
---
If you equip the item later on you can just say that you did another dungeon and won it, that’s it. 
---
You’re a fucking idiot.
---
GM's did look at past tickets though, at some point we had a loot master in raid that was warned by a GM that he needed to make less mistakes as he was making "to many" tickets  for loot swaps. 
---
I don't think GM"s looked at the rolls though, when i became loot master laster on for my guild and made a mistake the only thing i needed to put in was the kill time, the person that got the loot by accident and the person that needed to get the loot. 
---
In the video of the Blizzcon Panel I linked in my edited comment above they stated that loot issues would be fixed via GM tickets
---
Shoulders not boob-like enough
---
Simple solution. Mislooted items are a player issue that staff will not answer. Sorted problem solved. Blizzard saves money and players deal with consequences 
---
There will absolutely be min-maxed groups advertising PuG runs for dungeons - with the intent of selling the pre BiS gear to overpopulated classes (rogues and mages probably). When he’s  burned 1-2 hours and might not see the item again for 5 more runs - Lazy Larry is going to pay that 100-200g, especially when competition for raid spots starts heating up for the overpopulated classes.
---
funny pairing "classy" and "warriors" in the same sentence. these guys are the biggest divas in the game
---
I did play it at release. I also usually was chatting with everyone in my group at all times, talking about items and drops and bosses throughout the dungeon.
---
That sounds like a non vanilla change that requires development time. In addition to it being a terrible system, they are not going to spend dev time to create a new system for a problem they have already solved that would just be more controversial than the current system.
---
True.  Played a DPS warr in vanilla, up until raids most of my DPS gear was also my tanking gear, and we blasted through 5 mans.  Can hold threat like no other, which means everyone else is free to go all out on healing and DPS, and as long as you know how to stance dance and swap between weapons and have a competent healer it's a blast.
---
Blizzard fanboy, i see
---
This is not blizzard anymore btw
---
Your beloved company is dead
---
Mongoose wasn’t in vanilla iirc
---
You act like trade chat doesn't exist. This would work exactly once, and then everyone in that party would be known ninja/sellers and only idiots or newbies would fall for it again.
---
And you seem to have some weird idea that either 3 people can easily solo a dungeon while wearing junk blues, or that this would be profitable for a group of 4 to scam one single outsider.
---
Neither scenario works. You can totally under-man classic dungeons, with great gear, but then the gig is up because when you are decked out in epics and you roll need for a blue sword, everyone knows you are a ninja looter. ALternatively when it's you and 4 buddies trying to scam one newbie, how much gold do you think he is going to pay? What if the drop he wants doesn't even drop or what if he out-rolls all of you? You literally ran a guy through a dungeon you don't need just to try and fail to scam in... I think the joke is on you. There is no valid false pretense to roll need for armor you can't use, or weapons that are not beneficial for your class. You use your strategy once and it's very obvious you are a bunch of ninja looters.
---
Here is an alternate scenario:
---
If master looter as a loot option goes live there will absolutely be groups of players that advertise PuGs for specific dungeons, hold pre-raid BiS items under false pretenses, and make an industry out of selling it back to them privately. They can do all of this and maintain plausible deniability the entire time. It would also be vastly more entertaining than farming DM: E
---
Complete trash? That's complete hyperbole. Having bloodvine set over pre raid BiS isn't even more than a 10% dps boost overall.
---
&gt; I highly doubt that they would implement this system and not make master looted items tradeable as well
---
I think most of the reason they want this system in is exactly that. Masterlooted BoP raid items that are occasionally misclicked to someone else. This way they save time on tickets trying to fix those.
---
Too much fun talking about Activision on this sub reddit 
---
They really should make HD textures for all the old tier sets.
---
I don’t deny that it would cause more problems than it’s worth, but I have to keep hammering the point that it did not “work well enough as designed.” 
---
The original devs themselves say this. It’s fine and dandy for you to subjectively disagree with them, but at least be honest about how much was left undesigned for later. 
---
The best example is the Paladin class. Kevin Jordan himself admits that they had no idea how to finish designing Protection Paladins in a way that made sense so they just put it off until they had more time in TBC. 
---
59 is the best twink bracket
---
That cheese guy is in every thread here sperging about fallacies and logic trying to use debate club rules to justify cheerleading for Blizzard. I would just downvote and ignore.
---
I'm sure some or all did. I am just saying that generally they would make sure they were there for the kill, and that both players had a ticket open wanting the swap then do it.
---
You  you seems crazy to me if you say "you pay blizzard you get a token. Someone buys that token you get gold." And then "Gold is scarce...a minority will farm to it, the rest will pay blizzard for it"
---
Make peace with your mind, tokens will need people that have gold to be of any use. Then people who need the subscription will farm to get those gold.
---
Without token it will be: who can't pay the subscription for some reason will not play, who want to buy golds will take an "illegal" way, the gold farmers will farm each server, no matter how many of them Blizzard will ban (maybe you don't know that until the token, the ban system never made any difference on the matter), and who buy golds will not be banned because blizzard doesn't ban, if not for few days, the buyer of those golds.
---
I'm not in favor of tokens because I think they are good, but they are way better than gold farmers swarming the servers. And your "If your account gets stolen I don’t care" should instead care you, because I'm not a token neither a gold farmers customer, so if my account get stolen, your have the same probability to get stolen too.
---
Easy to say, but tons of GM time to answer all the tickets that will still be posted. Even having to answer the ticket with a message saying they won't fix it will take a fair amount of time, plus the bad feelings when they refuse to fix a thing they have always been willing to fix since day 1 of the game.
---
At least they removed the bones...
---
I can confirm that it was still thing in late TBC. 
---
I was the one that didn't want to leave after being removed from a party.
---
"So the player with dal’rend will unequip it to roll on it so he can vendor it? Or will he openly ninja it for the entire group to see?"
---
What? If he is willing to scam and roll on it with loot trading in game, he is willing to do the same in the current game to vendor it. Take your fucking pick, it doesn't matter how he does it- the exact same methods occurs with or without loot trading. If you are trying to convince me it's a stupid thing to do - congrats, you now see my point. It's stupid to abuse loot trading because it's either super obvious or it means you need to carry around an inventory full of gear just to pull of a scam and if you happen to have the same guy in group (maybe on an alt) who sees you do it again, the gig is up.
---
"If you equip the item later on you can just say that you did another dungeon and won it, that’s it."
---
Can you not read? **you have a very simple rule- you roll need on an upgrade, you equip it and use it. If you don't, you are a ninja looter. **
---
Explain how you defeat my rule and still manage your stupid little ninja stunt without being caught and blacklisted. You can't. It doesn't matter if the guy you traded to can keep it a secret for a few days, you already fucked your chances of getting into any groups, ever.
---
I have been a gm for five years   A macro reply that also closes the ticket. It’s a single click. Total time spent to open and close a ticket under 5 seconds 
---
The drop rate of the mountain lion blood is what always gets me. MINCED BLOOD!
---
The whole point is that you can ninja without being noticed with this system. The old system you will publicly be a ninja. You so lost in this argument mate, get a hold of yourself. Take a walk and clear your head.
---
I've always thought that 2h slows the group down unless you and the healer are both overgeared because they'll have to drink more since you take a lot more damage.
---
To open a pull for building threat, yes, 2h charge -&gt; SS -&gt; WW is great, but doing the majority of the run as 2h seems like it would be slower.  Damage taken doesn't justify the small dps increase.
---
This is what I've gathered from what I've read and experienced on pservers.
---
do you even have a clue how loot trading is going to be implemented.
---
no?  
---
thought so. 
---
I asked because I am going to be duoing with a priest, so it sounds like I can definitely do the boss at 30 if I kite the boss whenever my priest needs to get heals or mana or something
---
So...you made up some random numbers to say it won’t be economically viable. 
---
Here let me try! The item drops and the ninjas charge 900 gold, pocketing 300’a piece. Therefore ninja looting in groups is a viable economic activity. 
---
Well shit.
---
That is ninja behavior, and is so unlikely to ever be accepted that it is ridiculous. There are many possible issues with the system, but just take a screenshot when they try to sell you an item they just rolled need on and you have proof they ninja'd a thing to back up your accusation. It may not matter, but eventually people won't want to play with them and you can't hide on a server that is not connected to others, there are only so many people that play actively.
---
There are gold bid runs where stuff sells for over 1000g in MC
---
So what about gold sellers? The blizzard 's ban policy never made the difference against that...
---
I see people so concerned about the theory that they ignore the practical problem, the one that player will face, with people that still buy golds, and farm spots 24/24 farmed by holds sellers.
---
And stop with "I kill the gold seller and then I farm", because if he's of your faction or in a PvE server there's nothing you can do.
---
The game has months of content development in the pipeline now to go through from the Old Dev team before getting to the point we can say its on maintenance mode. 
---
You can’t prove they didn’t need it because they equipped a shitty item in that slot before the run. They can also offer to sell it later claiming they got an upgrade somewhere else. It is easy to maintain plausible deniability doing this.
---
Exactly. These days just about every piece of equipment has some fancy glow or particle effect about it, to the point none of them are significant or stand out anymore. The fact visual effects were relatively rare in Vanilla was precisely what made them pop so much when you saw them.
---
Ok, and that ticket will likely be repeated thousands or millions of times. Plus the tickets that come from the same player because the policy is so different from how they have run the game for 14 years. The bad look it gives blizz among players when you lose a raid drop because someone misclicked and they refuse to fix it. Overall it is just much easier for them to let GM's work on real issues and players solve these loot issues.
---
They implemented this years ago, and other than hyperbolic nonsense and hypothetical situations on here there have been basically no complaints about the system. Will some people abuse it, sure. But it will not be the majority of people.
---
No, I didn't make up numbers. Those are realistic numbers based on what people charge on private servers, today.
---
There are also crafted weapons, and boe weapons. It's economically unrealistic for Dal'Rends to be worth more than maybe 50g, max, since you can just buy a BoE sword of zeal or Krol Blade from the auction house.
---
Interestingly, if they implemented loot trading with the stipulation that everyone who rolled on the item originally has to agree that the trade is legit, otherwise it's impossible. It would defeat even this apparent loophole too although, it would really only make logical sense for the GMs back in the day to give the item to the second highest roller because if the high roller made a mistake the only person who got screwed was the second highest.
---
Yeah I guess the language used and the failure to stick to the subject gives the motivation away. The motivation being defending their opinions by any means necessary. 
---
Sure, if they go crazy making it hard to prove. but that's not the situation you are describing in the other post. You are describing a group essentially reserving items for sale, but they are selling the BoP's instead of whatever other stuff they might reserve. That is clear ninja nonsense, and will likely not stand.
---
You are comparing a gold bid run where people know ahead of time what it is with a random pug run where someone "steals" an item and offers to give it back for gold.
---
People in random pugs are not going to have 1000g on them, people joining a gold bid run most likely will.
---
Didn’t say anything about all the weapons you are listing. You are triggered and posting all over this thread, not going to to treat any numbers you provide as realistic or honest. In any case, posting private server numbers with a 10k pop and ridiculously distorted economy is meaningless anyway - because pre BiS items are infinitely easier to get when you can find a group instantly 24 hours a day.
---
You can't ninja without being noticed with this system.
---
You roll need on an upgrade, you equip it and use it. If you don't, you are a ninja looter.
---
Explain how you can trade an item away, with loot trading, and then still equip it and use it. I'm waiting...
---
I’ve never tried heroin, but I feel like it was doing that for the first time.
---
I'm aware of the cost cutting, but people are going on about design changes as if they were influenced by Activision, when it's more than likely that the devs are just out of touch 
---
How crazy/awesome of a game mechanic would this be. You couldn't hit the ass and still get drop. 
---
Patch 1.12 is when they introduced cross realm BG's [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch\_1.12.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0)
---
napkin math suggests you should want about 7 str over alternative pants to make up the difference b/w the deadmines weapons (~19.5dps) and the staff (~20.5dps).  
---
which the chausses certainly provide (11str) immediately.  i would just grab the Malleable Chain Leggings in wetlands, though, and take the staff instead.
---
I wouldn't know if I got fucked over no matter the system because I'm not a paranoid weirdo who inspects people to check if they really needed the item. I just trust people to need on what they need. Crazy, huh? 
---
Yeah that's the one. The path splits, one of the ways leads to that quest, the other to a cliff edge near the water. From that cliff edge you can see Ratchet. 
---
First time I saw the hidden path I was like a level 3 newbie. Thought I was the first one to ever find it. Saw Ratchet, wondered what it was. Jumped into the water, got killed by Level ?? Makruras three times while swimming there. Then I spent like 20 minutes just running around the town astounded by seeing Goblins for the first time, browsing all the shops and what not.
---
The friends that help you get an item already have the item. If you want dalrend, you bring rogues, warriors or hunters that have the weapon. They unequip it for another weapon when doing the dungeon and roll for it for you, they trade it over after the dungeon. 
---
You wait for a couple of hours before equipping it and claim you did another dungeon if anybody asks, your friends equip the item they already have and you can no longer prove any foul play. 
---
How are you not understanding this? 
---
Yeah I played at 19 because it was faster/easier/cheaper. I'd assume the higher level brackets have more depth and variety . 
---
Awesome! Thanks so much guys! Now what race? Thinking human for mage? Easier rep. If I went rogue I’m not sure what I would go. Horde wise id go troll rogue. Mage not sure.
---
Laintime, nuff said.
---
Now just take any of these, throw in chuck norris, Anal or dirge jokes and you are living a true vanilla experience, bonus points if this is in barrens chat.
---
It was a merger, but I think Activision leadership helmed the new company.  So while technically a merger, it appears Activision was in the power position.
---
I laid out the scenario in a prior post - long story short there is an easy way to do this that provides no “smoking gun” which can prove someone is acting in bad faith. If you accuse them of being a ninja more than likely they and their friends will be ready to muddy the waters and accuse you of the same/sour grapes etc.
---
You seem to be getting this confused with a carry. Providing a carry is a service - and is conducted openly. I and my friends could do this to you and make profit while farming our own pre BiS pieces (i.e. not carrying). If I hold on to some old pieces and swap before the run, I can do the dungeon AND get a possible payday rolling against you. 
---
LOL, you think I'm "triggered" because I am defending my argument. It's called debating, something you do when you aren't a troll who just puts out a stupid point before walking away.
---
Look, you are an idiot. If you want to try this brilliant strategy when classic is released and you hit 60, please do. i'll be shocked if you personally make more than 10g before getting blacklisted. Hell, I'd be shocked if you could find a group of players who want to waste time like that, because there are about 1000 ways to make more gold faster.
---
RemindMe! 200 days "is schizoeffectiv a wow millionaire yet from selling dalrends?"
---
There's some fluctuations depending on RNG, drops, dungeons you do, etc. Its really all about finding that flow though. Make sure you can go out, do as many quests as you can, hearth back to town, do a mass turn in, and go back out for wave 2. Its what I really liked about zones like STV, 1k, Tanaris, and Un'Goro in that they were really efficient zones for doing mass turn ins.

I want the system that shows me clearly when I’ve been cheated out of an item when I spend money and my free time on it, crazy huh? 
---
I swear Blizzard attracts the most idiotic people I’ve ever met, bending over backwards to protect a billion dollar company for implementing a system that is there for them to save money.
---
Same with Winterspring. One of the most efficient Thorium farming routes, unique herbs, a good Black Lotus drop rate, and it seems the Yetis were the best source for rugged leather as well. Yet according to this list it had "hardly anything going on."
---
It sounds like your are starting to come to terms with the fact that you lost this debate, have a great day, hope to see you in Classic.
---
If you have a group of friends to run a dungeon who don't need any loot from it, why are you inviting pugs exactly? You are just so stupid it's unbelievable.
---
Run with friends: if dalrends drops, you get it 100%
---
Run with friends + 1 pug weho needs the exact same thing as you: 20%+ chance that even if dal'rends drops, you lose it
---
If you actually are dumb enough to run UBRS trying to scam, you just played yourself. 
---
Murder is illegal and we still have murderers, therefore murder should be legal
---
I see what you're getting at, good point.
---
Tons of groups use master looter, especially in 10/20/40 mans.
---
Nothing stops a group from swapping to master looter right before a boss dies to loot the items to who they want to have them, either.
---
This type of behaviour is already enabled with existing loot options, so using this kind of behaviour to justify a stance against loot trading is just pathetically weak.
---
Sure, you could do that a few times and maybe get away with it. But after a few times of the same thing being leveled at you by different players the game is over and nobody wants to play with you anymore. 
---
Some people will abuse the system, but it has been in retail for years and not caused these problems and the sky is not falling. Call out the abusers and move on, get in guild groups, have friends. 
---
Either way the system is in, they will not back out of this because the other option is to spend money on GM's and they are not going to do that.
---
Am I old?
---
I bet she has more Rogue buttons than my Rogue in BFA has, too!  
---
Fuck you Blizzard for pruning my Gouge, which I've had since 2004, my Poisons, which I've had since 2004, my Bleeds, which I've had since 2004, Premed, which I've had since 2004, .........
---
lol ok
---
&gt; Prove that third party black market gold farmers were “nixed” before the WoW Token.
---
It was against TOS, against any given rule set in-game, a bannable offense and Blizzard went after a bunch of companies (legal/lawyer type stuff) when they could.
---
That's because Activision were the "pioneers" of most of the things that define the current video game landscape, so every company is becoming more like Activision, just look at Bethesda with Fallout 76, or Bungie with Destiny, or Bioware with Mass Effect: Andromeda and probably Anthem too. Every big name in the industry that we've associated with quality has been steadily going down the shitter.
---
... Gearing a lot of spellpower and casting flame shock?  Flame shock is another low-value debuff in a raid environment.  It is the most efficient damage per mana though, but it cannot crit except on the initial cast. 
---
I don't really understand your question, sorry =P
---
&gt; I love having windfury, but I hated it over riding my poisons on my rogue,
---
Can you tell me what you mean?
---
That map just made me realize just how much areas/zones/content was missing in the Eastern Kingdoms. That's a lot of open space / unused space.
---
But it's a barrier none the less that prevents it from happening more than it would otherwise. 
---
It's like me asking you why you bother to lock the doors to your house/apartment when you leave, because hypothetically speaking anyone who wants to get in could just put a rock through one of your windows. 
---
You won’t run UBRS with 10 people that need something, if you run UBRS perhaps 3 people need the weapons. 
---
Every time I explain something for you, you change your argument trying to poke holes. You are wrong, you don’t understand how the system works or how you will get cheated. It’s to bad you are fighting for a system that doesn’t benefit you. I don’t care to answer you anymore. 
---
Healer on cannon is failsafe. Second easiest is nuke boss with the understanding you loot the head before you die. Decent groups is still say focus boss but they can live through clearing adds at the end. 
---
Can't help it, ravaging asses is in my blood.
---
In your scenario, that goes back to eventually becoming notorious for doing nefarious things in dungeons, getting you blacklisted from invites.
---
if cannon cheese doesn't work, I'd go with this
---
What you are describing is openly ninjaing items, nothing is going to stop you from doing that but your reputation will hurt from it. It has been effective enough for ninjaing not to that common. 
---
What I’m describing to you is a system where you can ninja without ever being noticed, you can join a raid with a group of friends to increase the chances for one player to receive an item, even with master loot being enabled. 
---
Am I not describing this well enough for you?
---
And they weren’t nixed. **They thrived.**
---
Turns out prohibition doesn’t lower alcohol consumption, it actually raises it!
---
Turns out abstinence-only education actually increase teen pregnancy, not reduces it!
---
I feel like you’ve never taken a high school history class. 
---
The fact is that offering a safe, legal solution to gold selling / farming was the only effective way of reducing player harm by putting most of those black market sellers out of business. 
---
So where’s your proof that the problem didn’t exist *before* the WoW Token was introduced?
---
Windfury totem got rid of temporary enhancements to weapons like poisons.
---
That makes sense if the boar asses are to be used for something, but as a simple proof of kill the quality of the boar ass is pretty irrelevant. 
---
I sincerely hope this gets fixed in some manner.
---
Blizzard have fixed shit that trivializes encounters before, so we can hope.
---
I still to this day will always say 19 is and will always be the best. It’s what most twinks stayed at as it was the most competitive and fun. 
---
Dal rends is better than both krol and zeal and those sell for 300-400 and 150-200 gold respectably.
---
Back in vanilla I played a shaman on two different servers.  Alleria and Magtheridon(?) I think was the 2nd server.  Honestly I can't remember the 2nd server.  Anyhow I played Enhancement and then Resto on Alleria.  On the other I played Resto, then switched to Elemental.
---
The thing about raiding is that you need warm bodies.  Yes, enhancement was a joke as DPS, but you werne't there for your damage, you were there for your totems.  An enhancement shaman was often grouped in a melee dps group (dps warriors, rogues, other enh shaman (!), etc). But there was usually a shaman for every group almost.
---
Why? Because shaman were the horde equivalent of paladins back in the day.  Remember having a ton of paladins for all their buffs and auras on alliance?  Well that is what shaman did for horde.  Even Resto shaman, arguably the "best" spec for raiding back in vanilla was weaker than every other healing class out there.  The only benefit shaman had was they had one of the only "smart" healing spells in the game:  "Chain Heal" so they were excellent at helping counter DoT damage and small amounts of aoe damage on people in the raid.  Overall, the benefit for a shaman in a raid is to provide enough utility and buffs that the lower DPS they provide from another class, is outweighed by giving enough EXTRA dps to the other 3-4 people that benefit from it in their group.
---
The sale offer is private and the other PuGs will not see it. You can also wait an hour and sell it after the run. The PuGs will not even be able to prove collusion between you and your friends unless you are all guilded. You send out a whisper “100g for the shoulders” and make some excuse about wanting your epic mount instead. 
---
Well, it's much cheaper to support, so expect more of those kinds of changes.
---
Same. I can't help but to rip ass.
---
[Tell me about it.](https://sketchfab.com/models/f3eb3183601746d2b150737b956d5d07/embed)
---
Will we be seeing the "tank for hire" mentality in live or is this just a private server phenomenon
---
Agreed Globbisen.  People like the OP like to make false statements that makes them look like an outsider or "hardcore asshole" but at the end of the day it's just smoke and mirrors.  Just some basement dweller on his keyboard trying to validate his existence through virtual characters and purple pixels.
---
Sure, but I didn't hit those zhevra in the hooves! Where are their hooves!?
---
True, but hunter was the most forgiving class which caused a lot of players to never really get 'good' at a lot of aspects of it, like proper use of traps. So it's unreliable in that sense.
---
Im going to do the Drakefire Amulet Quest again.
---
Bnet chat is going to be a thing, even if they try to limit it in WoW people can still do it in the bnet client.
---
As for punishing people for skipping queues, no just no, that punishes anyone who happens to legitimately miss a queue pop.
---
As the comments shows, everyone has made their own version of it without anyone doing any sort of research. That's why Activision-Blizzard is all over the place. The following will just be the general information people got form reports and general action from Blizzard that made this mess popular to talk about.
---
Activision-Blizzard is actually from 2007, so back when you played. It simply means that the two companies merged together. Blizzard continued to do their thing like always.
---
Now, the reason it is a hot topic at the moment is because recently it seems like Activision is taking more and more part of Blizzard matters. Things like the financial department starting to be part of meetings, Activision employees transfered to Blizzard departments etc.
---
Then there are also recent actions from Blizzard that seems unlike them when compared to their previous philosophy. They have several times in the past scrapped games that was far into development simply because they didn't feel like it would become a "Blizzard quality game". In other words, they didn't care about the money wasted if it wasn't a great game for the players. They would rather spend 10 years and get an amazing game.
---
Now, look at Diablo Immortal. Everyone was waiting for Diablo 4 or a Diablo 3 expansion, but they release a mobile game. Blizzards fanbase are PC gamers, Blizzard knows that. This move is clearly not for the players anymore, it's because of the Chinese market for mobile games. People0 see those kind of things as a sign that the golden age of Blizzard is gone for good.
---
You are vastly over estimating the effects of a few random people calling someone a ninja.
---
If you don’t have mountains of evidence, nobody takes a claim seriously. Especially if other players say it didn’t happen.
---
What you are describing is simply a less effective means of being a ninja. You’d need to be pretty unobservant to not realize it was happening, either.
---
Players who are toxic will be toxic regardless of the loot system. Since that’s the case, may as well use the loot system that reduces support tickets.
---
They also are the races that look the best with one of Warrior's best PvP weapons for a long time, Bonereaver's Edge.
---
39 druid twink might be a god.  I twinked a 39 warrior and wouldn't recommend it, didn't see many twinks at all which might be a huge plus for some.
---
&gt; And the black market still wasn’t nixed. In fact, they thrived.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Turns out prohibition doesn’t lower alcohol consumption, it actually raises it!
---
&gt; Turns out abstinence-only education actually increase teen pregnancy, not reduces it!
---
&gt; I feel like you’ve never taken a high school history class. 
---
&gt; The fact is that offering a safe, legal solution to gold selling / farming was the only effective way of reducing player harm by putting most of those black market sellers out of business. 
---
&gt; So where’s your proof that the problem didn’t exist before the WoW Token was introduced?
---
You offer zero proof with all of your claim-based statements.   
---
Teen pregnancy increased? According to whom or what? 
---
Wow token wasn't in vanilla. End of story. 
---
But it *will* [likely be in Classic](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow). So congrats to you and yours, shill-boy.
---

---
#How much is it going to cost to play?     
---
*Classic will require an active World of Warcraft subscription, which costs $15/€15/£10. 
---
*You are not required to own the latest expansion.
---
*You will be able to pay for your subscription with WoW tokens purchased on Modern World of Warcraft. It is not clear whether or not you will be able to buy WoW tokens on Classic.        
---
Loophole they can drive a truck through right there, folks
---
Hunters are probably the master at pulling since they have best range, traps, and a pet to be single pull successfully and if the pull is bad they can abort with Feign Death.  
---
Would you let a Hunter do the pulling? 
---
&gt;that punishes anyone who happens to legitimately miss a queue pop.  
---
Failing to see the problem... Don't go afk while in queue (which wastes everyone time in your and the enemies team), and don't queue dodge
---
How come hunters can't use traps to get those boars whole?
---
Context?
---
Let level 60 tank kill everybody
---
Because for some our experience in private servers was directly against what we want in classic. I don't know any of the current servers since I haven't played them in years, but it used to be you could donate to the devs in exchange for top tier items on some of the servers. 
---
15 minute deserter for dropping a queue? No thank you.
---
"You won’t run UBRS with 10 people that need something, if you run UBRS perhaps 3 people need the weapons."
---
Okay. So thats 4 slots including yourself. Now you invite 2 tanks, 2 healers, and 2 caster DPS. Nobody else is rolling on dal'rends. If you only have 2 friends, then you invite a third caster such as a shadow priest, or you bring a DPS druid or ret paladin. Lol meme specs, it's fine though and they won't roll on your drop.  
---
You are absolutely retarded if you are making a UBRS group with multiple friends all for one specific drop and then you intentionally invite a pug who will roll on the same one drop.
---
It's a part of Wailing Caverns where you have to jump over a gap. Back in vanilla a lot of people used to fail the jump over and over and fall down and then have to make their way back up to try again.
---
&gt;What sort of dungeon groups do you think you will be running that have 3+ people all rolling need for the same item?
---
Truestrike shoulders, Briarwood reed, Baron Cloak, Dal Rends set, Hand of justice, literally any item that's any good in zg/aq20 and mc/ony which will be pugged as well. 
---
Just do personal loot then and be done with it. If loot trading is in, I’m out. Not gonna play with that system.  I’m already on the fence about playing anyway because of the $15 a month shared account with the current version, I want nothing to with current wow. 
---
Well if you can't bring it back I guess any change can be justified, right? Convenient. 
---
Do you play on private servers? It's a very very similar community experience. I'd say you are wrong here.
---
And you are correct with your understand as far as I know.
---
If you make the group you reserve the item, if you join a group you ninja the item.
---
ITT everyone thinks every player is a snake and there will be no fair way of distributing loot. 
---
Also ITT everyone acting like master loot will not be an option 
---
I think the novelty of people being badass and having cool gear is much less of a thing, because most everyone knows where it dropped from and, most players anyway, will know what you had to do for it. 
---
I think personalities and guild reps will be important, but people being struck in awe by that one dude over there with the Spinal Reaper in the first month of the game. That phenonenon is tied pretty much to the newness of the game back in the day. That still happens a bit, like seeing a level 60, raid geared player of your same class in the city while you're level 30 is cool. But nothing remotely like it was.
---
Metzen left in 2016. The lore turned to shit long before that, notably starting with BC when he "forgot" about draenei already existing in Warcraft 3, and probably culimating with the WoD clusterfuck.
---
Mike Morhaime left only a few months ago. Most of BfA was developed under him. Any radical change after that won't be visible from the outside for months.
---
I really don't see how those departures you mentioned spelled Blizzard's Doom, clearly the quality has been nosediving even under Morhaime and Metzen.
---
Pretty sure you can kill one add and then boss. He will only spawn 2 more if the first two die I thought.
---
If you manage to get DM weapons, take the legs. Otherwise staff of westfall
---
Kill the first 2 adds but when the second 2 spawn at 50% or whatever then just cc as best you can and focus vc. 
---
She plays exactly how old rogues did. 
---
Stuns, blinds, bleeds, silences and ass ravaging squishies
---
Unless you're going for server first lvl 60 warrior, there will probably be enough people at that level range to help you/sell mats already on a fresh server.
---
You clearly just drained the lion's blood completely in killing it.  You can't get the blood on the ground you little bloodletter you. 
---
I mean adding Quests during Progression. Thorium Point and Raventusk Village weren't in the game at the start. They were added in patch 1.5.
---
Yes, because they are easier to obtain and you don't need to run a dungeon and rely on them dropping. But the difference is less than 1%, in all practical measure the weapons are absolutely equal. Anyone with hundreds of gold to spend will buy a krol blade at 51, throw crusader on it, and enjoy having BIS mainhand for 9 levels until 60. They won't even care if dalrends drops because it's not worth paying to enchant a new weapon for a .3 dps difference.
---
And let me tell you, wailing caverns was a maze of an instance. You would attempt to jump over and pull mobs and wipe the party, making you run the maze once more. Hardest boss ever.
---
Having played as both horde and alliance I found his alliance points all to be correct for the most part but the horde ones are not really pros. Like I don’t see why he would list a pro for horde that alliance just does better and easier (chromagus poison cleansing totem)
---
Also I think his point that fear ward isn’t really an advantage because horde had tremor is just plain wrong. Tremor is nowhere near as reliable as fear ward. Will of the forsaken on onyxis is also a dangerous game in my experience. 
---
The armour style I disagree with, as it's not uncommon to see leather wear cloth etc. 
---
As for only 1 item, maybe? Depends how they work it out. If you join a with a premade, that still gives them four opportunities to steal. Maybe if they found a way to limit item drops being traded, but I'd imagine that being extremely difficult to code in. 
---
&gt; The game is currently designed to keep players logging in every day by basically putting in daily/weekly timegated lootboxes.
---
Is that actually any different from Legion?
---
I'm very interested in the final product!
---
It’s funny how in the private server scene with 12k people online a ninja manages to get himself barred from all weekly raid pugs but you think it wouldn’t matter on significantly smaller servers. 
---
It does matter, it just doesn’t make you unable to play the game but it’s enough motivation for people not to do it, obviously. It was for many years the only reason people didn’t ninja. 
---
What I’m describing is actually a very effective way of ninjaing, and something you can continue to do for a very long time before anybody would catch on. Enough time to get you geared faster and get yourself in to a guild. 
---
Without the system it’s fair, a ninja will happen every now and then and the player will be called out for it. 
---
With the new system it can happen in every group you’re in without you noticing it. Imagine doing 30 runs to get both dalrends to have a group of players steal it from you using this method, or 50 runs for cadaverous armor. You’ll never know that it even happened all the while you’re not even full pre bis after months or weeks.
---
The rarity of the items in vanilla is the key factor that makes this system utterly retarded, the benefits for doing this are huge and the disadvantage are pretty much nonexistent. 
---
Dwarves and gnomes offer more than humans for pvp fyi. 
---
This topic is the epitome of what is wrong with anyone wanting changes.
---
Its not how much better the changes would make the game. Its not how much easier it would make things. 
---
We want the game exactly how it was. 
---
No changes. No matter how small, no matter much our lives would imrpove, no matter how much 'better' the game would be.
---
The exact same game is all we've been asking for for the last 15 years.
---
The set looks ok, but the weapons are odd, where is the peri blade

When I did PVP premades in vanilla we got to recognize other premades because we were all on the same server and encountered one another regularly. We didn't do any complex queue dodging scheme, we just took turns letting each other win. So what can you do to combat that? Have a deserter debuff if someone wins too fast? It will only penalize pugs who really do get e.g. 5-capped.
---
If you didn't make the group, it's not happening.
---
Group lead : huh, found a DPS, but he will only join if we also invite his rogue, hunter and fury warrior friend. funny thing they all want tro roll on dal'rends"
---
Tank: lol, skip that idiot. lets invite those two mages who are looking for a group.
---
As much as your point is valid, i think the OP is more about how having changes implemented for Classic WoW should be looked at with skepticism regardless of their impact on the game. 
---
20 secs of cc and you need to fd to re-apply it. Mages shit all over that.
---
That would make sense if you overkilled by x amount it would not drop the item.
---
When a dot ticks for 3 damage to kill the mob and it doesn't drop the item...
---
I remember _very_ early on thinking that stealth just made you harder to notice by being transparent to everyone else, just as you looked to yourself. And that as part of that, enchanted weapons were intended to be a tradeoff decision to make for rogues, since they would make you more powerful but also easier to spot.
---
No, not really. BfA is basically a stripped down Legion.
---
39 is the best bracket. So many classes become viable, other than just the rogues and hunters that one shot everything. Besides from the traditional classes, Warlock and Shaman become very strong (aside from hunter/rogue). At 29, Ret Paladin is a beast with Corpsemaker. 
---
I know Craghack, but the reason for this is because they got used to Dynamic respawn because of private servers, this makes it "okay to change because they are used to it" but tbh it's just as wrong acording to their own arguments "Not classic like etc etc"
---
Also if we want classic like servers Sharding actually makes it more classic like compared to something like dynamic respawn (some quests not possible with dynamic respawn cause mobs spawn to fast, or u simply die cause mobs spawn on top of you all the time) 
---
This is just my opnion atleast, i don't have a problem with sharding at all aslong as they 1. Don't start using it again for events (in theory ever, only at server releases) 2. Keep it in starting zones only.
---
____________
---
Btw crackhack i'm bueskytten from "the private server" we played on :)
---
Huh I knew the shamans own windfury weapon wouldn't stack with weapon stones and such, but I had no idea the totem did that.
---
&gt; Forget about advantages because they are so small it doesnt actually matter
---
The advantages that different factions/races have are very significant for pvp and should be considered before picking a class/race. One example is playing a rogue on alliance is a lot more difficult when you are constantly running into orcs which will resist 1 of your stuns half the time. Another example is playing a warlock on alliance is more difficult because of undeads countering you with their racial ability will of the forsaken. 
---
Because their dps doesn't scale. Sure, chromag xbow is nice but at the end of the day warriors and rogues do far more damage with aq gear.
---
The main problem is that hunters get NOTHING in aq40, so after bwl they're basically getting no upgrades.
---
&gt; You offer zero proof with all of your claim-based statements.

The WoW Token has been one of the most effective solutions [to reduce the size and power of the black market gold-farming industry.](http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2228-im-paid-to-play-mmorpgs-its-nightmare-5-realities.html)
---
&gt; “Jeremy thinks he has only a few years left in his job, and here's the big reason:
---
&gt;[Image of WoW Token]
---
&gt; If you're a player looking to buy your way to better gear in WOW, you can buy a $20 token that can then be traded in an in-game auction house for gold. The purchaser of the token can't redeem it for cash—they can use it only toward free months of their game subscription (to prevent farming).
---
&gt; Jeremy says the decision caused a panic among the gold farming community. And although the demand for black market gold still exists, Jeremy has seen his income fall, despite putting more hours in this year than last.”
---
An interview with a Chinese gold-farmer circa 2015, around the release of the WoW Token. 
---
[World of Warcraft and the battle against black market gold: Is the WOW Token working?](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-29-world-of-warcraft-and-the-battle-against-black-market-gold)
---
&gt; The gold-sellers are putting a brave face on it. After days of unanswered emails, I eventually get to speak to someone from SSE-Games in China - after I convince him I don't work for Blizzard, that is. Alex (probably not his real name), acknowledges that the Token has had "lots of effect on business" and that SSE will earn less money now. This is a company of around 60 people and WOW accounts for half of its business. It's not even one of the bigger companies in China, where he believes most of the gold-selling business to be located. "There are hundreds or thousands of companies like us," he says.
---
You can keep Googling. The WoW Token has been a resounding success is ending the exploitative, harmful, Chinese black market gold farming cabals.

&gt; Teen pregnancy increased? According to whom or what?
---
Countless studies shows this, but in particular, [This study found in the American Journal of Nursing](https://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Fulltext/2012/03000/Comprehensive_Sex_Education_for_Teens_Is_More.5.aspx) has the following abstract: “Abstinence-only programs are associated with increased pregnancy and birth rates.”
---
&gt; Wow token wasn't in vanilla. End of story.
---
Color-blind options weren't in Vanilla, either. Are you seriously against those too? You're a monster.
---
Can anyone explain how OP thinks it will worsen the social aspect of the game? I'm not sure I understand the point 
---
Oh but what do we have here, a caster heavy group that is only there for the rare mob Jed. They all want the trinket and some of those casters are there to ninja the trinket for their friend, some fucking thing. 
---
I know you're a troll at this point but I'm afraid others will read these comments thinking I gave up 
---
The thing they don't get the ones that says "I'm okay waiting for queue times, waiting to do quests, waiting to kill mobs" etc.
---
If we had a 5k server we woul have 1000 people in Durotar at level 1.
---
Maybe 20 of these people will have prepared exolpration routes to get lvl 4 via exploring and maybe 80 will leave starting zone and group up for lvl 5+ mobs with other friends. 
---
That leaves 900 people in the starting zone. Their is like 200-250 mobs in the starting zone with a 5 min respawn timer, so the average guy will have to wait 20 mins for 1 SINGLE MOB. No one enjoys that, blizzard also want to make it fun for people that wanna "try classic out cause they heard about it, or retail players" it will completely ruin the game for people like this....
---
Yeah, part of planning back then.
---
Mage, go ahead and need the plate helm and DE it for us please.
---
Agreed, but do warriors have this problem as well? Mages and hunters exist on both factions and can kite warriors in both instances.
---
1. Most of the time getting one needed item out of one dungeon run is a big success, so that doesn't help very much.
---
2. Warriors could need on everything, and a mage with enchanting wouldn't be able to say, after everyone greeds, "If no one needs can I need boss loot for enchanting?" I know you might think, "but people could just trade it to him after" but that slows things down, some people might prefer to keep it for vendering once they have it, others don't pay attention to whether or not they won some junk they don't need, so getting their attention would slow things down too... Alternatively, the group may want the mage to DE everything no one needs and then everyone roll for the shard, and having to trade it to mage would once again slow down the process.
---
I really don't think either have a good chance of making it into the game. Not bad ideas though, keep thinking, never harm in talking ideas out.
---
Did you read the name of your dots.
---
You smashed them. They are extremely delicate. Just a light touch and they crumble in the desert heat.
---
Nice! That was a hell of a fun group
---
I think the issue a lot of people have with BfA compared to Legion is that Legion introduced a lot of interesting and fun mechanics and shit to grind (legendaries/artifact weapon).BfA simply pruned/removed a lot of abilities, or made base-line abilities talents, as well as people losing their artifact weapon along with it's abilities. So people essentially regressed when they started playing the new expansion.
---
Remember that these are monster boar that are bigger than people are could swallow weapons whole (albeit small weapons). also you could just say the boar was guarding the weapon on the floor and it's not physically inside the boar.
---
In theory they should be able to, except hunters are mentally impaired. I thought this was established.
---
That's a separate issue that is bad, but nevertheless not as serious as queue dodging which ruins it for not just the two particular groups involved but the entire bg system because PUG players are affected as well.
---
&gt;No thank you.
---
Exactly. That's the whole point.
---
That video is kinda garbage, the fastest leveling classes make for the fastest leveling duos. Any iteration of the 3 fastest leveling classes (hunter/druid/lock) would make for the best duos. 
---
Calling them "boar asses" instead of zhevra hooves, plainstrider breaks, etc just makes this more funny.
---
I couldn't stop reading...
---
I had a moment where we were running Wailing Caverns in TBC or Wrath, &amp; some kid kept asking about the "blue turtles" because he wanted to tame one. We thought it was cute, but Kresh was a green turtle (maybe the other way around idr).
---
I love that game. Thrall was my boui back in 2015.
---
Thanks for the insight! How would a naxx geared enh shaman do against a naxx geared warlock in a 1v1?
---
Upvote this to the moon.  You cannot argue against a system for its exploitable nature when the alternative is even more exploitable.
---
People just don't want loot trading in because it's a change and god do I wish people would start admitting it.  I could actually get behind the argument that loot trading shouldn't be in just because it wasn't there before, but all of these deeply flawed fallacious arguments trying to supply some other logical excuse to be mad about have been driving me insane since Blizzcon.
---
I went with Undead Priest. Thought it was an oxi-moron sort of thing. Decided to re-roll when I realized you couldn't have a pet at lvl 5. Did Undead Warlock. 
---
Had a problem with leveling a bit and deleting characters...
---
Not only that, but the employer is a scientist. He needs a very specific volume of a very pure quality blood.
---
Talking about the competent variant-  hunters, not huntards
---
What spec would you play druid? 
---
Because they own them. When a company buys out an9thwr company. Things are taken over and changed such as game design, marketing etc. Activision has their fist up blizzards ass and ours while we smile and hand them money for the fucking they're giving to us.
---
&gt;Overpowers the shit out of those boars
---
&gt;you literally minced that poor boars asshole to ribbons
---
so thats what warriors are about...
---
Guess we'll be seeing a lot of Paladins.
---
Oh, ok.... On Kalecgos we called Dire Maul "DM" and Deadmines "VC". Like I mentioned, must've been a server thing..
---
There are none.
---
I played an alliance rogue though and, while not heady heights, got rank 10 so was no stranger to pvp. I don't recall being bothered in the slightest or feeling disadvantaged. I loved my time ranking before packing it in to raid.
---
Le epic troll my friend. Have an upvote, good sire, as I chuckled heartily! Narwhals were had this day, as well as tasty bacons and cute cat pics. 
---
*nods with approval*
---
No. No loot trading. Tough shit policy. You Need it, it's on you.
---
In what way are PUGs affected by queue dodging that they are not also affected by win trading? Both of those result in premades getting even more honor and cycling through queues faster than they otherwise would.
---
I’d love to do that
---
Where do I claim any change is justified? I’m making points and asking questions, not making any justifications.
---
Worst shoulders ever designed. Rest of the set is awesome.
---
Dude, I know people on retail who still fuck it up.
---
Quest: Collect 4 Zhevra hooves.

Usually with enough accusations against a person or group, it won’t be as much “he said/she said”.
---
I spent a lot of time and effort in mid-teen levels getting my hunter a matched set of swords I liked the look of and enchanting them. Then I was very confused when "nothing happened" when I clicked on the second one to equip it.
---
That was the day I learned the difference between "one hand" and "main hand."
---
That's the Dragonfang Blade from BWL.
---
Agreed that an MC Dagger would have been cool though!
---
All I see is vendor trash.
---
This is the most retarded shit I’ve ever read.
---
spell power buffs and convincing your raid for a consistent flame buffet debuff and test your dmg w/Flame shock.
---
Well, if Traps are specced you can push that to 26 seconds. I'm not saying it's as easy to use as a sheep, but if you CC your mob in a safe distance it's doable, maybe with a an additional concussion and/or a scatter shot and good /focus macro. Or intimidation.
---
All I'm saying is that IF you know your Hunter skills you will be very valuable as you can CC everything. Not just humans/beasts. 
---
It is my favorite zone in the whole game. It nails the desolate feeling. So dark and dreary and...desolate. Plus my fav dungeon of all time is there. Inner Mauradon. 
---
I'm just telling you it gets old quick..And having been around clubs for a long time I can tell you that there is nothing more sad then these trying to keep the party going for years... To semi quote David Wodderson: I get older but the kids around me stay the same age
---
Yes, I hate when I am stuffing sausages and I find out they left the bones in the sausage casing.
---
Sounds good
---
Yeah but going through a GM ticket is a lot more work and time invested to actually make that happen. If all you have to do is need and trade the item to your friend, that takes less than 30 seconds. People will be doing that non stop. It'll just become the normal, expected behavior. 
---
&gt; It’s funny how in the private server scene with 12k people online a ninja manages to get himself barred from all weekly raid pugs
---
Raid pugs are not something that the average classic player will be participating in.
---
A very, very small percentage of people who ninja loot have their reputations effected, even on much lower pop servers than current big private servers.
---
&gt;The rarity of the items in vanilla is the key factor that makes this system utterly retarded, the benefits for doing this are huge and the disadvantage are pretty much nonexistent
---
Could literally say the same thing in favor of both loot trading, and using master looter to ninja items.
---
Why leave it up to chance that your group loses the role when you could just ML it to yourself?
---
Why leave it up to chance at getting screwed over because of a misclick with items being so rare?
---
Most twinks play premades...
---
The thought would not cross my mind.. :D
---
&gt; An absolutely core part of Vanilla was the communication barrier between Alliance and Horde.
---
I'm sorry, but this will happen outside of the game. There's a little something called Discord. 
---
Dismiss your pet
---
DISMISS YOUR PET DUDE I SAID...
---
FUCK WE HAVE ADDS I TOLD YOU TO DISMISS YOUR FU-* 6 minutes until release “release spirit”
---
It's allowed, so why not?
---
That looks terrible and over-designed
---
Right and I'm claiming enhancement can do the same.  It's a very poorly understood spec with a terrible reputation backed up by lots of incompetent people playing it.  Like feral druid, if the enhancement shaman knows what gear to wear, what consumables to bring, and how to play, they do just fine.
---
They also have the Bloodfang tier 2 set for her in this game.
---
Hey I worked hard buying and selling wool stacks on the AH in vaniila :P
---
This is something i wish they'd address if and when we get new content for classic. restrict data mining with encryption or some other way and internalize betas in blizzard itself with nda so we get the unknowble experience again.
---
Do you guys remember that feeling of experiencing stuff for the first time without knowing anything ?! new areas, new items, spells, mechanics and dungeons. that feeling was exhilarating ! i loved finding stuff for the first time and having my mind blown ! and i knew everyone were with me on the same boat so we could find out things together !
---
now we have months before everything spoiled in wowhead with data mining...
---
but im just day dreaming, i know it will never happen :(
---
Maybe an adventurer dropped the are and the board was guarding it.
---
Didnt use to be that way, doesn't need to be that way now. I'm not even convinced its the fault of developers, but of publishers and publically traded companies that bow to investors wills instead of just making a damn good game.
---
DE, GGG, CDPR, etc. The list goes on. Those companies will be the forerunners once shit really hits the fan.
---
The reason I don't care about loot trading even though I was an avid classic player is because I understood how much man power it took for Blizzard to manually give us this service as they did in classic.  It's not realistic to think they will restaff to manually handle loot, and the players absolutely need a loot trading service in some form due to the sheer amount of grief it will cause within the community if there isn't.
---
Knowing how emotional people get over loot, I am far less concerned about the people who may try to "cheat" the loot trading system, than I am the people who would be legitimately hurt  by not having it.  
---
That almost entirely depends on who wins the tremor totem / grounding totem / earth shock interrupt on fear.   It could go either way.  You can't remove any dots, but you can heal yourself.  
---
In a complete vacuum, starting 50 yards away in a vast open space I would say the warlock would win.  But if the shaman can get an effective jump into melee range without burning all the CDs then I would give the shaman the edge.  Can purge off the warlock's defensive armor skills (soul link and demon armor) and hit him like a truck.  
---
Altogether a relatively even match, I'd say the warlock would win more than he'd lose. 
---
50.0 yards ≈ 45.7 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)
---

19 Rogues were fun until everyone started making Hunters. Even halfway geared hunters were impossible to kill alone.  Kite=Death
---
Not enough skills/items at 19 to have a fair or overly interesting fight.
---
29 Is probably the best for having a middle ground between skills, items and a quick and easy level to hit.
---
Would you say the extra DPS allotted to your teammates covers the lack of DPS from your own character? Like, if you were to reallocate that DPS to yourself?
---
Would it also be good to have 2 shaman throwing out a variety of different totems at the melee line as well as ranged? The more I think about it, the more interesting it is.
---
I can understand that. I can also understand why some changes are implemented (though, understanding the changes doesn’t mean I agree with them).  
---
I want and little change as possible, and with the explanations that Ion had made, it glad to get some good counter arguments to his reasons for said change.
---
Inb4 people who have played Wow for 15 years just now realizing it isnt the fabled picture of Saint Sebastian in a gimp suit.
---
The fact that you say that means you don't even understand the fundamentals of how this works, yet you try and argue against the guy.
---
Just let it go.
---
costs 10 blizzcoins to summon
---
But there are quests that specifically ask for pristine boar asses and  then there are just quests that ask for just boar asses.
---
Ah.. I guess you could tinker around to see how far you could push it but I see no way this would be applied to a PVE environment.  As enh spec, your talents all point towards weapon damage being better.  You could pick up +spell crit damage bonus in the elemental tree, so I guess... sure?  But this doesn't seem like any viable way to DPS as far as I can tell.  Using two debuffs to boost flame shock?
---
I don't see a scenario that it wouldn't be more damage to simply spam earth shock max rank, and then do rank 1 for clearcast procs then go back to max rank when you get clearcast. 
---
They have fucked up economy because everyone knows how to farm gold efficiently now.
---
20g/hr is considered low.
---
This will be in Classic too.
---
Right, was thinking of 15 agility, becouse I spend like a week farming furblogs for the reputation to get it
---
One of my favourite zones.. Spent a lot of time there (most of it killing furbolgs for rep) but it has some amazing quests
---
The elementals you need to kill are like 37-38 iirc. There will be way more warrior wanted the weapons than people selling the mats, I guarantee you. And collecting them yourself would be a waste of time because by the time you can, you can also go get Bonebiter which is slightly better.  
---
Honestly I'm planning on skipping Whirlwind on Classic launch, it's too much effort and gold for a weapon you can replace quickly. It's good if your warrior is your alt and you can just send gold and ask for help from your lvl 60 friends, but as a main, it just seems like too much effort. You might be doing slightly more dps but you're wasting a ton of time getting it and risking not having enough gold for level 40 mount if you buy the mats. 
---
Very interesting, thank you! I'm thinking I want to go with warlock as my class in classic, I've just been told they're pretty bad at PvP but I don't know for sure
---
I’ve been playing this game since 2004 and I always thought it was a damn boot lol
---
&gt;  legitimate reason (either fiscally or gameplay-wise) why sharding would actually make sense to bring back after launch.
---
Events like gates of AQ. Essentially, if they judge to bring sharding for launch because of the amount of players in a small area, then the same logic applies to other such events. 
---
You can't have "authentic" though, because it's unreasonable to think Blizzard will hire 100s of GMs to shuffle our loot around, and we DO need something to shuffle loot around.  Not being able to shuffle loot around would also NOT be authentic.  
---
Loot trading is a lot closer to what GMs would have allowed back in the day than people realize.  If the conditions of loot trading in it's current form are met, you pretty much guarantee a GM would have restored/xfered the item back in the vanilla days.  The only difference is a GM doesn't need to spend the time verifying, noting, and manually xfering the item, since all those things are automated now.
---
Or To collect 4 Zhevra hooves...
---
I don't recall it being a big issue in Wrath when it was introduced.  People are overreacting.
---
Will it happen?  Of course.  But when a warrior starts rolling on caster gear you will know to leave the group and not run dungeons/raids with them again.  Being known on a server as a ninja isn't something most people want.  Most people aren't shitheads.
---
The average player will 100% participate in raid pugs, the meta will carry over from private servers. There is no changing that, AQ/Naxx will probably not be pugged but the others will, good guilds will want their tanking pugging for thunderfury as fast as possible, they lead the raids and reserve those items. 
---
Both the systems have problems but I would rather go with the system that was in place in vanilla. The system that openly showed me when somebody was dishonest. This new system isn’t even being implemented because ninjaing was a problem, misslooting was. 
---
I don’t want a system that allows hidden ninjaing to fix the misslooting problem, and neither should you. You might not think this will be a problem but I’m a part of many wow communities where many top players from the private server scene are already planning to use this to their advantage. 
---
I don’t want this change because I know players will be cheated out of their items by dishonest people. There needs to be some tweaking if this should even be considered. 
---
U do know that no matter what blizzard won't spend all these ressources they did back then on GM's. It would be super sad that ninja looters just got away with it everytime saying "missclick" cause gm tickets doesn't work. Loot trading seems way better option then "nothing" since no matter what we know blizzard won't have that many gm's for this stuff.
---
Keep in mind that Ice Barbed Spear is only available once AV is made live which will almost certainly not be at launch.
---
This is the biggest "WOOOSH" ever.
---
Way to miss the point.
---
Explain Zhevra hooves.
---
Again you missed the point. Read the whole OP.
---
I cannot count the amount of times I've Google'd some specific question, managed to find 1 forum post where someone else is asking the question.
---
Only to find out that the old comment is someone telling them to Google it. Or "fixed it, nevermind".
---
Don't be that cunt.
---
You missed the point. Read the OP.
---
You still missed the point. Read OP.
---
I disagree.  Loot trading is gonna effect my experience next to 0.  It may make it slightly better even since if something DID come up I could resolve it without calling a GM, while doing nothing to effect my core game experience.  
---
Youre pretty far off the main point. You should read OP.
---
Yeah, your dreaming if you dont think we had realm forums and the opposing faction on MSN messenger. A rank 14 I knew sat in ventrillo with high level PvP players of both factions all day.
---
Yeah, I figured he was lying/exaggerating based on his other posts.
---
You say that until you've been in that queue for 2+ hours and have to use the bathroom for 2 minutes.
---
Can you post any sort of evidence that an Enhancement Shaman can follow a proper Feral Druid? Shedo have shown 800-1k DPS in BWL gear on Patchwerk fights. LegacyPlayers is bugged, so can't be used.
---
Misclicking was rare, but you have to consider there are tens of thousands of 40 man raid groups across all servers.  So while it was rare to see it happen to you or people you knew, it was constantly happening due to the sheer number of people playing.  
---
Great idea
---
People run WC on retail? Why??
---
I like building in Heroes of the Storm as an assassin I go full Ambush talents.
---
There's a whole barrier to get over there. You have to go to some common place of discussion such as the realm forums, find a discord server, join it, hope that the other player you are trying to reach has done the same, and hope that they have a sensible nickname set so that you can find them.
---
Same argument can be made for win trading or gold selling, it can and will be arranged out of game, that doesn't mean we should do anything to support it use in-game.
---
You know whats gonna hurt the social impact?  No one playing cause they can't resolve their loot issues.
---
I completely understand the point, thanks.
---
As a shaman myself I am not a big fan of this. I have limited time and I see myself as a casual hardcore player (I play less than most, but when I play I want to play the game efficiently).  
---
That being said an enhancement shaman is a suboptimal spot in your roster. That person will rely on other players who are playing the regular raiding specs to get them through (I am not talking MC here but later content).  
---
It just feels bad that this guy is soaking up my PvP/fun gear while I am blowing gold on potions, runes, respecs etc to clear the content.
---
I'm totally with you OP. Adding to it, I also really want people to play on outdated computers and low res monitors, because I'm a #nochanger.
---
Now, I know this won't really affect *me*, but that's beside the point. It's about staying true to Vanilla.
---
/s
---
ES's damage is commonly reduced, since its nature. While Flameshock is upped by Imp scorch, COE, FB, firepower.
---
I'd be surprised to see ES do more damage.
---
There is a lot of leather that warriors use...so, I'm out on option 2
---
Played since Vanilla and always thought it was wings...
---
You want all the exploits back too? And all the old bots/hacks working too? 
---
The issue is there was loot trading, manually done by GMs, back in vanilla.
---
We can't expect Blizzard to hire people JUST to shuffle our loot.  It would literally cost Blizzard millions to do so.

So we need the next best alternative, which is the system they had in place that mimics very closely what a GM would have been allowed to restore for you.  It isn't identical to what we had, but it's a close approximation that has distinct advantages, like not having to wait a days for your item xfer, when it could have been automatically done.
---
Sorry, but no. Just no. You, like most private server players, seem to be completely out of touch with what an average player is.
---
Private servers are mostly composed of the most hardcore vanilla fans. Those are not at all the average player.
---
&gt;I’m a part of many wow communities where many top players from the private server scene are already planning to use this to their advantage.
---
If the "top players" are that toxic, that's what you should be concerned about. (But, ultimately, they're just conspiring against eachother even if that's what they're planning on doing instead of reserve runs, seeing as they'll be 60 months before the average player gets there, and they're still an extreme minority)
---
I see legitimate missclicks to be a much larger problem than collusion on items. 
---
You seem to be super concerned about the potential toxicity of the community, but at the same time don't seem to actually be interested in attempting to address that problem.
---
Sure, it might not work, but if it won't really work, what **would** happen if somebody tried that? Would they pick up some ranged weapon? Run away? Start evading attacks?
---
either is fine.  just need to communicate what you're doing.
---
having the option to feign a bad pull is definitely a bonus.  it's just a bit riskier to have someone other than the tank setting the pace.
---
Probably just dungeon finder! It’s like 4 bosses now and a 10 minute dungeon lol. So sad
---
When leveling I always used to farm those 50-53 Blood Elves in Azshara. No one was ever there, and they dropped humanoid loot which was always a bonus.
---
Anything in-game is already monitored by Blizzard. Which would make it easy for Blizzard to catch those people abusing the system. Your whole argument works against you to be frank.
---
People with the same interests will gather and make communities on the internet.
---
hard to say.  i think behaviors we associate with private servers at the moment will still be present but less common.
---
it remains to be seen if the masses convince pserver people to change or pserver people convince the masses to change.
---
&gt; It was clear that Blizz intended for shaman to heal in vanilla.
---
Don't you lose aggro if you switch out of D stance? Or do you just use challenging shout whenever you wanna 2h and cleave?
---
I am not sure I want to play classic anymore not with all you whiney moaning sods
---
IMO Warlocks don't come into their own as PVP monsters unless you have progressed and got a good amount of gear from AQ40 or higher.  
---
Until then, you can spec soul link/nightfall and be very survivable and have some damage potential, or you can spec sm/ruin and have good damage potential but poor survivability.  
---
Most fun warlock PVP, in my opinion is using the succubus and speccing destruction.  It's tricky but very engaging =p
---
Isnt sunder only ussable in def stance? Its been way too long for me. 
---
There are some good fury/arms leveling builds with 2handers. 
---
Sure yes.. In a raid environment.  But then you are pushing other debuffs off the table to get flame shock up there, and if you're ENH spec you have very little spell power.  I question the utility. 
---
Nope, any stance you want.
---
How do you play against kiting classes of Mage and Hunter? And details, please. 
---
I’m talking about the average player that is currently playing vanilla wow. That is a better estimate than anything you have, just face that. The average retail player is a completely different audience, they have fuck all to do with vanilla wow and will most likely not play it. 
---
The average player is 60 by around 10-12 days played while the more hardcore will be 7 days or under. It won’t take months for the average player anymore, there is to much information out there these days. 
---
You’re the one that is out of touch with the vanilla community, you know, the community that is the primary target audience for this launch. 
---
You should be worried that this system is getting implemented at all because it makes stealing items so incredibly easy. I’m worried that I’m seeing entire communities instantly seeing this gaping hole in this system that can be abused. 
---
If they see it, others see it. It will be abused and you can’t tell. You should just admit that and either see to the good of people that it won’t be abused or admit that most people will take advantage of systems like this if the opportunity presents itself. 
---
Who says locks are bad at PVP?  How drunk were they?  They are really good if played correctly.
---
Alliance locks have some issues since Undead have Will of the Forsaken, but you can work around that.
---
The hidden bonus of anger management is huge for leveling and then sweeping strikes is even better. I don’t see it being fast. What is the goal? If it’s to tank while leveling you don’t need to worry because fury and arms do fine at tanking dungeons. Is the goal to just have fun doing something different?
---
So what, are you saying that it's pointless to make a video like this because the top performing duos will all be classes that are the most self-suffient? I don't understand why you even commented considering you didn't really critique anything about the video. Even with the theoretical "best" duo (two hunters) he points out that you may as well just go solo because hunters are just so self-sufficient.
---
Besides, the point of the video doesn't really seem to be about which duos are the absolute fastest to level but rather which classes provide the most satisfaction when played together. I think it's extremely relevant to the OP because he was asking for people with experience for warlock and druid duo leveling which is a very niche topic. How can you say what I linked is garbage considering it talks literally about that.
---
when/where did they say they won't change item values?
---
&gt; Anything in-game is already monitored by Blizzard. Which would make it easy for Blizzard to catch those people abusing the system.
---
Yeah, no. Anyone who's played on retail the last few years know what a joke this supposed monitoring system is. Gold/boost sellers (who want paypal, not gold) are rampant in both trade chat and the LFG tool. Blizz doesn't give a single fuck.
---
&gt;People with the same interests will gather and make communities on the internet. There is no way to effectively stop this, and I don't see why you would even try.
---
Contrary to what people in these communities want to think, the people who seek them out are always a tiny minority. You're absolutely kidding yourself if you think there's going to be organized discord servers for most realms. 
---
There's a _massive_ boundary difference in right clicking on someone's name in-game, and having to seek someone out in a third party app where there's no way to actually find other users. If you actually don't understand that then I really don't know what to tell you.
---
Worth it.
---
I wasnt that well geared or skilled and i could still take care of myself quite well vs most if not all classes as disc priest.
---
Rerolling is what most people with this concern are trying to overcome.  Not a matter of shame, but effort.  It would be heartbreaking to get the char name you want and have to reroll months in because of the population disparity.
---
Being frank, I really wouldn’t want to reroll at any point either.  I’m all for a solution to this issue.  Sadly, my experience is not enough to offer any suggestion that hasn’t been made already or is outright against the no changes crowd.
---
10 rage for rend, 12 rage per sunder, means 58 in the first 4 seconds of the fight.
---
I like this because I can often run around with 100 rage so I don't get attacked by other players as much, and I can dump all 100 into the fight if I have to take on two mobs or more at once.
---
Why not just have a pop-up that pops up when you click Need saying "Hey, are YOU SURE that this isn't a MISCLICK?" Should solve 99% of misclicks
---
This very well may happen, it's just not that big of an issue in the grand scheme.
---
legitimate loot trading issues are absolutely going to happen though, so the defense of "some pugs will be able to ninja shit easier" doesn't hold weight over legit loot issues that will crop up and will need to be resolved.
---
Not having some form of loot trading isn't realistic, and hiring 100s of GMs to manually do it like we did back in the day isn't possible either.  This is the most logical solution using the existing system, which was largely based off the policy the GMs were restoring from in the first place.  
---
Speaking on a personal level if someone pulls some shady loot shit, I will just leave the group.  There will be tons of people playing and you can avoid players who don't play in a way that is compatible with your play style.
---
No shit Sherlock 
---
I’m confused... why do you need to farm more than 16 pummelers? Do they disappear? The language used implies they disappear, but it’s a weapon with a use.
---
Haha thanks much! Can we keep in touch!?
---
The higher the level, they more wPvP you can have. A lvl 29 can do serious damage in STV and still rule in BGs. 
---
I'd say 29 is as active or even more active than 19, but with more interesting abilities and engineering.
---
I really agree, it is up to the community to make this work correctly. Punish the abusers of the system, because Blizzard probably won't change it even if the community cries out. Tell the ninjas and traders to equip the BoE's in front of the group if they really need them. Pressure them, blacklist their names if they lied and traded. Make their lives hell, that is true justice because they won't have fun or get what they want and thus will waste their time. 
---
By the time you get 4 sunders up isn’t the mob almost dead 
---
I'm alliance and wish to do PvP from time to time. I don't want to be a gnome or nelf due to visuals. My question is: Considering warriors don't have such a bad time against rogues, are dwarves still worth it for PvP fun instead of a human, whom with would probably be more fun in PvE.  
---
Also, additionally, how is Stoneskin in PvE content? Is it just a 10% extra armor, or is it actually useful somewhere?
---
this isn't special 
---
You can level with any talent choices, really. If you're going for efficiency then the ideal builds are long established (fury to 39ish then switch to arms).
---
Rend does minor damage, even with talents, and Sunder isn't terribly useful except to hold aggro and boost group damage.
---
If you're wanting to level as Prot then go for it, but I wouldn't bother with the Rend bonus. Even if you go with tank gear (shield, etc) Fury would be faster for solo.
---
If you havent tried the Danger Zone mode in cs:go I'd highly suggest giving it a shot. It's pretty fun.
---
As someone who’s played Rogue since vanilla and is thinking of switching to a prot Warrior for end game PVE, what are the best resources to start reading?
---
Something akin to Oto’s guide for rogues, for example.
---
Pummelers have a set amount of uses where after they either disapear or you can't use the on use effect anymore (its one of those 2 and I belive it has 3 charges but I am not sure on the details)
---
I think it might be more efficient... and testing that out I find fun. Last chance is nice to have too, because near death situations happen so often for warriors. The +defense is pretty significant for ending fights with decent health too.
---
I'd probably go cruelty after this point for the extra rage that comes from crits.
---
Bad idea, as said above.
---
Tho I may get downvoted to oblivion for this, I think people make a mountain out of a molehill when it comes to this whole loot trading shebang.  If things will work as used to, you can just denounce those who abuse this system, giving them a bad rep. I know how scarce good gear is, but I just find it unlikely this would happen several times.
---
If you think loot issues are made up demands, you have no idea what players are petitioning to GMs.
---
Private servers are different demographic than what classic WoW will be.  I would say if you don't like loot trading, stick to your beloved private servers since they are already offering the experience you want.  
---
If they choose to add content (later down the road) I never want them to raise the level cap.
---
I would prefer them to reuse some of the expansion content but tune it for lvl 60 players.  But, I don't expect them to do this unless Classic is extremely successful.
---
Personally I do not see Classic being successful for more than 1 year, unless some patching or additional content is added.  By the 1 year mark most everyone that wants to participate in the raids should already done so once or twice; maybe not all of the content but the Raid farm will become a grind.  
---
The entire business model from TBC onward was to keep the players grinding levels and gear, instead of experiencing the content and story... I'm not sure how they achieve a different result without fundamental business model changes.
---
Those are also quests you don’t want to grind at once, they’re quests you slowly do all over the zone, because the mobs that drop them are spread out. Once you are ready to leave the zone you should have finished them, because you will naturally kill wolves and bores etc as you go from quest to quest in order to maximize xp gain!
---
Responding to this for outside readers to help them understand how you're wrong - don't bother replying.
---
The way the scam works with loot trading is you equip gear that appears to make you "need" any BiS loot that drops in the instance you are doing with your friends. You roll against pugs with your friends, who also appear to "need" the item based on the gear they're wearing. When one of you wins, you privately offer to sell the piece to the PuG, who is not aware you are colluding with others to reduce his chance of winning. You can tell them that you needed the piece, but would rather have your epic mount (technically not a ninja) or w/e other cover you want. In many cases, they will pay, especially if its a difficult to obtain item that could take them several more runs to complete. Based on private server prices this would be highly lucrative, even for 3 players working the scam, and prices will likely be higher in Classic once the economy is fleshed out. This kind of scam is much more difficult to detect than overt ninja'ing (surprise change to master loot etc.). It requires that you armory the other players in your group and look at their item history to determine if they have a better unequipped item for the slot they're rolling on.
---
&gt; Color-blind options weren't in Vanilla, either. Are you seriously against those too? You're a monster.
---
""Everything you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in r/classicwow is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."*
---
Iirc you didn't get your stuff if it got ninja looted. Only if it was a proper ninja looted in 40 raids where a onyxia for example got ninja looted. Not in dungeons. Anyway we the ninja lootefz get bad rep
---
Loot trading will effect things in a very positive way, since GMs won't manually be restoring our items ever again.
---
&gt;Blizz doesn't give a single fuck.
---
Combating goldsellers/boosters is a totally different issue than queue dodging like we are discussing here. You can't directly compare the two, they impact different parts of the game and are dealt with differently. Just because they are handling issue x poorly doesn't mean they will handle issue y poorly, even with the same detection methods used.
---
EVERYONE interested in pvp are of course not going to participate, but if you are somewhat interested in doing premades, you will for sure have the interest to get in contact with others that have the same interest.
---
If you understand the issue OP is talking about, you'd know that it doesn't need to be the majority taking part in the abuse to effect the whole realm. Only 1-2 groups of queue dodgers could have a big impact.
---
if it means loot trading doesn't need to go through a GM, gladly.
---
In one of the blizzcon panels they said they are not touching databases. Which means numbers for mobs/bosses, classes and items won’t be adjusted or tweaked.
---
You keeping ignoring the one way rule that destroys such scams. If you win loot, you must equip it. Since you sold it and traded it away, you can't do that, and it's obvious you are a scammer.
---
I think it was, but then again I'm probably biased.  My favorite classes were paladin/shaman/druid (all classes that have vastly different specs and could fufill different roles as needed).
---
Overall I'd say that enchancement shaman in the main tank group was a boon,  giving your tank and other melee dps in the main tank group "Windfury Totem"  was their wet dream.  As you know, as tanks got better geared their rage generation actually suffered quite a bit (avoiding being hit means they generate less rage than they used to, and thus have a harder time keeping aggro by the lowered rage generation).
---
Windfury could help a warrior with good weapon skills to generate enough rage to be more comfortable.  Though there was always the fear that a rogue or other melee dps would get some windfury crit procs and steal aggro too ...lol.  Fun times.
---
You cant check in retail currently, the fight doesnt work the same way anymore, VC was fundamentally changes in cata.
---
I've never really been able to notice a lot from the anger management bonus personally, especially after it feels like I wasted points getting to it, 2 points is the max I ever want to put into Tactical Mastery for the change/intercept, 0 if I roll night elf and avoid fighting people.
---
the people actively playing and paying for the game probably do like it, lol.
---
To each their own.  
---
I'll rave til I die.
---
Okay makes sense! Thank you 
---
Why? It would look so out of place lol
---
Actually 200 iq wtf
---
If I have all that rage saved up before the fight, it's just 4 global cooldowns. (4 seconds)
---
PM me if you want whenever =P  
---
it actually was.
---
Loot trading literally mimics what a GM would have manually done for you.  
---
We can't have GMs manually shuffling loot for us now, so we default to the next closest thing.
---
Ah.  #feelsbadman#
---
Everyone should start as Mage so I can 100-0 kill you all in the questing zones on my Rogue.
---
That isn't very vanilla.  Seems like your making changes in the game
---
Inferior to what?
---
You can't have GMs manually trading our loot, and not having any form of loot trading would be very NOT vanilla.
---
r/nocontext
---
You just keep going in circles. 
---
Group with a normal distribution of classes: you roll against 1-2 people. If you lose, life goes on and you run the instance again.
---
Group with a party stacked to all roll on the one drop you need: you drop group. It's not worth it, you statically won't won the item, and the group is, by necessity, so unbalanced that the run will probably be hell.
---
In either case, the outcome for you is the same regardless of scamming. You would be dumb to join group two even if loot trading didn't exist, and group one, b running a "scam" by some Uber geared raiders, might not be so bad because you still have a 33% chance to win and the run will probably be pretty smooth if it's full of geared players who don't legitimately need loot.
---
You're an Alliance player leveling up in Hillsbrad. A Horde player named Grugzug appears.
---
How do you communicate with him through discord?
---
You're fixating on the wrong thing. Yes, large guilds and hardcore pvp groups will get to know each other and connect through discord.
---
But what bnet integration does is let you communicate with *any* enemy faction player *easily.*
---
You could connect with people through ventrillo and forums back in the day, too.
---
The issue is the instant ease of right click battlenet adding someone to be able to communicate.
---
So far this is the only icon posted that I actually knew what it was.
---
Its kind of sad that nothing still comes to close vanilla tier set designs, it has the most iconic raid armors
---
Sunder and rend are a bit pointless together. Rend ignores armour and you're only going to be auto hitting after sunder so what's the point? Might as well just use damaging abilities instead of sunders.
---
So you rather throw the integrity of the entire PvP system away for this niche scenario?
---
Just make the window longer. Deserter debuff for queue dodging is nothing but a good thing.
---
You either level as 2h fury or arms. Prot is too slow. 
---
There's been plenty of theory crafting done on levelling specs for warriors. 2h fury is on top currently but will depend if /sit auto crit works on classic. 
---
you are the type who complains about getting camped on the forums lol
---
Well you can't lose aggro if you're outdpsing everyone with insane cleave dmg. Since you're tanking you get extra rage from all the dmg taken, almost constant +25% dmg from enrage so you just spam cleave + whirlwind + sweeping strikes
---
As someone who loved vanilla  I see very little impact on how other peoples loot bullshit effects my game play.  
---
It really does seem like Blizzard did this because they had a system in place that automatically does what GMs used to manually do.  This is a pretty damn close approximation to what we had.
---
still not sure what you are suggesting.
---
do you want the game to launch without thorium point and raventusk village quests?
---
do you want the game to launch without level 50 quests?  anathema and rhokdelar?
---
do you want full 'progressive' quest mechanics? e.g. recreate all bugs and fixes?  typos?
---
i'll do you another one: ragnaros wasn't summonable at release.  this was 'fixed' in patch 1.3 with the addition of the aqual quintessence questline.
---
all of these things should be 'in' at the launch of classic.  because 1.12 is the most complete version of the game and these things don't have anything to do with later content that is being gated.
---
the niche argument might be whether the level 50 class quests deserve to be gated to the second (bwl) content release.  this might make sense because a select few of the rewards (diamond flask) are arguably better than t1 alternatives, and there is already the precedent that some quests (silithus, t0.5) will be gated to a later content release.
---
This is the only set I use on valeera in hots, that and T2!
---
For mana pots and runes, how much do you blow through during fights on average, and how much do you tend to farm up to make sure you don't run out for a raid night or reset?
---
I know many will not like me for bashing modern wow again, but that design shows me why I can't stand recent armor (and character) designs. If I am not mistaken, this is not made for wow (maybe hots?), but all the new armors, just as this, lacks.. I don't know, hard to put my finger on it. Maybe the overuse of that gold, maybe the lack of orange, the lack of distinguisable colors. Or maybe it's because it lacks texture. All the cloth, the mail, the chain, the plate parts look like they are made of the same material. The hammer has exactly the same feeling, and every modern weapon, they feel like plastic. In the recent versions, most of the belts, the boots are looking the same bulky thing.
---
I know I am just rumbling here, but I hope someone can tell me from a visual/artist standpoint, why I hate these type of armors so much (they are like made for mobile games). They started this trend at late wotlk, but it was bearable (to me) till MOP, but Cata absolutely suffers from it tho.
---
no.
---
It's obnoxious to suggest Blizzard should hire 100s of people to shuffle out loot around when there is a good enough solution available.
---
Rend does great damage compared to rage invested as long as you do it early in the fight from what I can see.
---
And Sunder at 4 or 5 stacks improves all melee damage by about 20%-30% (does more to mobs with low armor) and more damage means you build more rage.
---
I know all about the old theories, I'm suggesting they might be wrong though.
---
My list would look entirely very different, but whatevs, can see the point tho.
---
As mentioned elsewhere, you're missing the possible abuse of having the majority members of a party be in collusion to loot items and trade among themselves.
---
It's an obvious thing when a Mage rolls on a plate item, but what if you're a shaman that joins a group with a rogue and hunter as other dps.  Who's to say that the hunter doesn't really need that STR/AGI sword?  Who's to notice if he trades it a moment later to his friend the Rogue, who'd originally rolled lower than you in the rankings?
---
&gt;niche scenario?
---
I see someone didn't play vanilla lol
---
Depends on how many people want loot trading or not.
---
You realize Blizzard is run and operated in a totally separate place and still develops all their own shit right?  It's literally just a business arrangement between them, they have no shared development.
---
Re-releasing a 14 year old game is ALWAYS a nostalgia grab no matter who does it.  It's awesome were getting that nostalgia grab, and some people will stick around after that to form a community around a game we used to love, but we can't recreate 2004, that shit already happened and it can't re-happen.
---
i think you are reaching with that interpretation, but gotcha.
---
i believe here is specifically what you are referring to:
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1878
---
but i will note ion specifically does not mention items whatsoever.
---
Who's to say what's negative and what's positive though?
---
It seems that some folk think loot trading is a negative social aspect, and some folk think that loot locking is a negative social aspect.
---
I guess it sort of makes sense if a warlock kills it with corrupting magic or a rogue with poison. 
---
Don't do this. Any strat that breaks fight mechanics is a crutch you can't rely on.
---
Been playing pala since vanilla. Had no fucking clue
---
Might be part of why I want a different way to do things, sitting while fighting doesn't fit in my head as a possible option.
---
It might take me 6-12 months alone just to get to 60 due to having a job...and at that point I haven't even raided lmao. It will easily last me 4-5 years probably.
---
Maybe, but imo those numbers (Classic to Retail) will be minimal.  Classic will take up a lot of playtime for people getting back into it.  Also, I doubt anyone interested in classic will pay any attention to retail at all.
---
This is the real answer. It also depends if you have reliable CC for the adds.
---
So you get to raid log? Fun... 
---
To me it's always surprising when people *don't* know what the spell icons are.
---
I have been playing Priest forever and never realized what the icon was until now.
---
They still haven't made it so pets can jump with you on retail? Dang, after a decade I would have thought they'd add that.
---
It's always incredibly funny to me to read all the comments about "but what about when we clear Naxx?".
---
Very few people got just a single boss in Naxx down in vanilla, and even fewer cleared it. I went into MC once and managed to do one or two full, cleared runs of ZG back in the day. I would be excited if I just managed to get some decent loot from MC in classic.
---
No. It has been discussed to death. There are no original thoughts left despite OP acting like he has some genius level take on it. 
---
It's spam at this point. 
---
Activision put paid weapons in Black Ops 4 a week after launch, no reviewer could have known about it, and the first week of sales is the most important (also pre-purchases are about as important I guess).
---
That is the type of company Activison is, if they could legally drain the bank accounts of every person who play's their games, and there is nothing that can be legally done to get justice, retribution or any form of action against them, they would do it.
---
Activision is in the money industry, people having fun playing the games they make is only a side effect of creating that money.
---
&gt;I see someone didn't play vanilla
---
Add this assumption to the long list of things you're wrong about.
---
Secondly, the pserver I play on has 1.5k-2k concurrent players, which is absolutely Blizzlike.
---
Just because you want to be able to AFK for a queue is not a good reason to not add measures to combat queue dodging.
---
Dark souls begs to differ =p
---
But yes I agree, not good to rely on Cheese™ to get a well balanced diet. 
---
For outside readers - AngryWriter is referencing an old loot community loot rule in Vanilla, that if you rolled need on an item and won, you are required to equip it and show the group. He seems to believe that this rule will come back, and will stop scams like the one I described above. His argument fails for the following reasons...
---
1. Under a loot trading system, it is perfectly legitimate to sell loot. If I genuinely need an item, roll need, win the item, and then decide I would rather sell it - that is not ninja looting. In fact, if loot trading goes live this will happen all the time between private parties, and will not be considered ninja looting. The guy who won may value his epic mount more, and the guy who lost the roll may prefer to pay and get the item now rather than continue to run the instance. It is the winner's right to sell the item, vendor the item, or disenchant it as he pleases. Another person who lost the roll may be angry that I won the item and then sold it to another party (assuming he inspects the buyer at some point and even realizes this, so like 3/10 cases). It doesn't matter. If I want I can win the roll and disenchant the Hand of Justice right in front of him, I won it, its an upgrade, its mine. 
---
2. The reason the system I described above is a scam is NOT because you sell the gear to another party (which is going to be common), its because you secretly stack the rolls against the PuGs in the group, and you all lied about needing the drop in the first place. So you've created a situation not where you choose to forego an upgrade in exchange for cash, you've stacked the deck in your favor to roll on loot that is only useful to you AS cash. 
---
Wait, rogues don’t even have poison anymore? Good lord!
---
Even if this happens sometimes, it's still a better outcome than not being able to loot trade in legitimate circumstances.  
---
If players really wanted to pay gold for loot, they always had the option to pay people to run the dungeon for them and give them the loot.  Happens all the time in other mmos.
---
If this is really an issue to you, it's really simply to avoid people playing this way.
---
Good point. I wouldn't say pointless, but perhaps I'd be willing to put those three points into Heroic Strike instead.
---
Well, yeah, but if you're on a ghosttown server you just get a free transfer to a higher pop server, so I don't see why this is a bad thing?
---
Hi, /u/pustamekka
---
Maybe your the one who has problems thinking if you can't A) understand why a veteran vanilla player like myself would be ok with loot trading considered GMs did that for us back in the day and B) how you can type so many words with so little point and not understand how you get down voted.
---
played lvl 39 rogue. it was unbelievable powerful
---
The established leveling specs are that way for a good reason. They have years of experience min-maxing the builds for speed. Sunder isn't really part of the equation because the time spent stacking Sunder should be enough time to end the fight.
---
I almost always used Rend since it's a minor rage investment and an instant attack but it's fairly mediocre damage. It's helpful in pvp to prevent re-stealth and sometimes in pve to help finish runners. 
---
If we're talking about elite mobs then the rules change a little bit.
---
But again, if you like a spec that isn't "normal" then use it. Having fun matters the most. :)  
---
(I had a Prot alt back then, slow but fun)
---
If you want to PvE, on the PvE server, you want enough people to make a guild with a raid schedule that works for you, which is a lot easier with more people on your faction.
---
GMs did not trade loot for people reliably in vanilla. It happened sometimes but it was not standard policy and usually they would tell you it was too bad.
---
Post-vanilla their customer service policy changed and they routinely traded loot for people. This ended up taking lots of GM time so they automated it, and then did away with group loot entirely.
---
However this was seen as a customer service change, not a game system change, and so Classic will have some version of loot trading.
---
Holy fuck give me classic already
---
His [mouth](https://i.redd.it/uy65ws7kah821.png) looks like a gaping butthole. How does he get it shaped into a perfect circle like that? 
---
What about when I perfectly preserve the boar’s ass by blasting them to oblivion with frost bolts but still have no boar asses in the loot? WTF BLIZ
---
An alternative way of approaching this is your employer (the quest giver) requesting very high quality items. Meaning that out of all the mobs you kill for their body parts, only a select few (= drop rate) will have paws/heads/tails/etc of high enough quality to please your employer. Something you can't necessarily gauge without killing the mob first.
---
Did you miss the part where half the people in this topic hate the idea of loot trading because it will enable loot selling scams?
---
If people call it a scam, it's a scam.
---
I guess you think it's okay to roll need for a boe and then sell it to a party member who rolled against you as well?
---
Speaking of corpse camping level 20's.
---
I went to red ridge to pvp on my rogue (I don't gank people attacking mobs or anyone who is gray, idk why I don't it is just a personal rule I have)
---
Level 60 warrior and paladin kill me and proceed to corpse camp me.
---
Level 40 hunter sitting at grave yard (told by level 40 hunter who was using beast eyes on his pet to troll people)
---
The ONLY reason I was able to get away was because I rezzed twice and died slightly closer to the mountain side on purpose, so I could go into the adjacent zone, climb up a mountain there and make my way back to my body to rez and hearth.
---
OFC I did not realize that charge is magic and the warrior went up a stright incline to kill me, Q me having to respawn on a dif mountain out of sight and hearth out.
---
Seriously, I get killing a lowbie in passing because your a jackass and why not, it's just a single button press, but corpse camping someone 40 levels lower than you is pretty drek.
---
Garrosh has a warrior tier as well
---
Thank you for further demonstrating the absurdity of your position. No further response is warranted.
---
Why, the Vanilla Authenticity Committee of course
---
It's not just reduced GM tickets, it reduces GM man power significantly too.  Loot issues were among the most time consuming for GMs because of all the manual verification that are now just automated.  It makes sense for them to do this given how it helps them offer better customer service and allows us to be in control of our own loot issues.
---
As an avid vanilla player I can live with this and I can (and will) play in a way where this won't even impact me if I don't want it to.
---
What does raid logging have to do with the context of rushing to 60?
---
Because that's all that those who rush to 60 will be doing 
---
Still could have happened with 1 person, and this happens less than legitimate loot issues.
---
It's actually pretty damn vanilla to have to blacklist the ninjas... that's what we did back then.
---
I agree, There is nothing worse than ending to do a 5v10 in wsg because half queuer were afk.
---
We can't have GMs manually trade loot for us like in classic.
---
Not having any loot trading is also not classic.
---
Don't hide behind "loot trading isn't classic" while also suggesting something that wasn't classic.
---
Yeah maybe not pointless but they work against each other in that sense. 
---
Yes, because clearly, it's hit 60 and then never log on again until raid time.
---
Yes it is primarily for their customer service, but it isn't a bad thing for us to be able to handle our loot issues.
---
It costs Blizzard millions of dollars to manually shuffle our loot, it shouldn't be so hard to realize why they probably don't view that as realistic at this point.
---
Did you tip your fedora when you wrote that mate? Thanks for demonstrating that you’re not remotely connected to the community that brought you classic
---
and it should get you kicked when classic comes out
---
But that ooze quest though..
---
Vanilla -&gt; WOTLK had the sickest tier sets. Legion was pretty sweet too. 
---
This one bad scenario doesn't make up for all the legitimate loot issues that will be solved, and much quicker with the ability to manage it ourselves.
---
Apparently not lol
---
The on use effect (+50% attack speed for 30 sec) which is godly for feral dps since they don't care about weapon damage, has only 3 charges, once they are used up it become an useless item with low level stats for lvl 60 characters.
---
Dedicated feral dps will farm a lot of these to use on each boss since the on use effect is a huge increase in dps (something like 20%). Feral tank might also want some for certain encounter to increase their threat to unreachable level.
---
I disagree, I think it will have deep and profound changes on the way players approach the game. It may become more economical to intensely farm gold upon hitting 60, to pay reputable carry groups for loot rather than being cucked by PuGs which are going to mass roll on your BiS loot and charge you for it anyway.
---
Its not an issue at all for me, because honestly if loot trading goes live my friends and I are going to take advantage of the mechanic to get ahead. 
---
Lastly the whole point of my post was that it is not at all simple to avoid people playing this way - because they purposefully misrepresent themselves to take advantage of the loot trading system. It seems you don't understand what is being discussed. 
---
Gm could trade item therefore vanilla had loot trading, okay true, thanks. 
---
The thing no one wants to address is even if blizzard didnt do shit to change anything, the game is going to be drastically different just from player experience, online data, pserver competition, better internet, and better computers.
---
I get you want the authentic experience but youre all inconsistent on it.
---
Even if it's not in its still better than what you linked. 
---
You're just making things harder for yourself. On a class that isn't known for easy levelling. 
---
You literally never need to be prot. 
---
Wrong. Pick the right server and stop making stuff up. Clearly you’ve made no effort and you assume every server is the same as the one you likely didn’t play on anyway.
---
Lots of the servers offering pay to win no one donates anyway and it’s not a problem.  Even Feenix had pay to win and the prices were so high it was completely a non issue. 
---
My friends and I had a swath of 49 twinks around the mid/late TBC era.  So fun.  
---
Having mounts is a big deal, otherwise GG to the cheetah aspect or travel form cheese making it literally impossible for you to catch people unless you have nifty stopwatch or swiftness pots. 
---
You haven't understood the concept if you're saying: "the time spent stacking Sunder should be enough time to end the fight."
---
The idea is to have enough rage when the fight starts to stack sunder immediately so I can benefit from it for the whole rest of the fight.
---
Part of why I want to put this out there is because of Mizoto's video on warriors stacking spirit to reduce downtime, he does all the math in the video for you and it seems like the old theories might be focusing on reducing fight time too much, because it seems overall time goes down quite a lot if you can reduce downtime, even at the expense of attack power/crit. High DPS on the weapon being the only truly important stat.
---
This might factor into my spec just because having the armor and defense talents should reduce downtime some amount.
---
Every server end up dying when naxx release. Most Pver who killed the last boss a few time will stop because they have no reason to continue. Pvp become fucked with naxx gear and they start to leave too. Since the player base shrink even casual end up quitting. 
---
But it's okay, at this point, we would have played 2 years of one of the best game ever and every game has a end eventually.
---
The 19 bracket is and always has been the most popular. It ranks highest in players, accessibility and the difference in power. But while there is some skill involved, the classes are obviously unbalanced. 
---
Wether or not it's the best is a matter of opinion. Fun means different things to different people. 
---
So legit
---
Dark Souls is too ruthless to allow for abilities like fear or polymorph too : )
---
Yeah, another thing was me recently realizing that "Cleave" spell icon is not actually a green parrot.
---
And a simple solution to this is rather than clicking on a name in raid as ML you get a window asking you to type the name of the player it is to be sent to.  This would remove ALL misloots in raids.
---
The experimental evidence I have is questionable but promising.  As far as I can tell, no one has ever bothered to actually weight enhancement stats and compile equipment rating lists until I did a couple weeks ago.  I submitted it to the classic theorycrafting discord and someone there did some testing against a dummy Patchwerk with more than 1200 DPS.  This was fully raid buffed with best in slot everything.  I don't think it's unreasonable though to think they could do 800+ DPS in BWL gear though.
---
Here's the link if you have any interest in doing testing for me :)

---
"you can only Need items for your armor style"
---
So warrior can't need on bis leather items ? Paladin druid and shaman can't need on bis cloth healer items ?
---
And what about shaman, can they need for 2h for their off spec even if they are not specced for it at the moment and so can't use it before a respec ?
---
Funny that people think they will actually clear Naxx LOL, just the top guilds will. 
---
Shit me tooooo
---
Nope. It's a green parrot. It has to be. What else?
---
Thought it was a foot on a bloody floor, but never gave it much time.
---
Assassination rogues have poisons.
---
Yeah similar haha
---
One of my earliest memories from WoW is when I dueled a paladin, and asked him why his sword was flashing sometimes. He told me he used a stone to sharpen it. I was so amazed, even tho that answer got me nowhere, since I found the only role-player on the server who talks like that.
---
This is false on so many levels. 
---
Just because mages or cloth wearers could roll on plate items it was NOT a common occurrence in anyway. There was NOT a problem with cloth wearers or any other classes consistently stealing armor they couldn’t wear just to vendor it. 
---
And even if you were right you think they’re going to give the item to you just because the loot trading exists now? They stole it on purpose. 
---
A lot of times people complaining about these situations are biased and tell it from a perspective that they deserved the loot more than the other person. Not because the other person couldn’t use it and it was ninjad. 
---
Rarely you would get noobs in the group who don’t know anything and roll on something they shouldn’t. Boohoo dry your eyes and get over it kids. It was RARE. I played through all of Vanilla wow and this didn’t happen often. I got most of the items I rolled on and only lost them to others who COULD ALSO USE THE ITEM. 
---
This was not a common every day occurrence and in no way warrants loot sharing. 
---
Amen, blizzard should be made aware of this.
---
The executive leadership of the holding company that contains both Activision and Blizzard was drawn from Activision. The former CEO of Activision is CEO of Activision-Blizzard. In practical terms Activision corporate leadership has control over Blizzard as a subsidiary.
---
its ass* idiot
---
Do you guys have really bad eyes? I dont understand these posts...
---
Have you ever seen terminator 2? Those asses SHATTER when they get too cold
---
Ok. Now I’ve confirmed it. You’re twelve. Or at least I hope you are, because if you’re not you have the maturity of one.
---
The current activision hate is problably a mix of deserved stuff on top of shorters profiting from the downtrend of the stock.. you can be sure they are artificially releasing comments/articles agaisnt blizzard and making millions now.
---
I like what youre trying to do, and do it if u want, but sunder is just so inefficient for short fights that youre better off using something else.
---
Dont let people tell you youre wasting your time in prot or whatever if it seems more fun than cookie cutter specs.
---
I already did. Zhevra hooves are extremely delicate. Almost crystalline. One little tap, and poof, they crumble to dust.
---
Let's say you hit lvl 19 at Classic launch and wants to run Deadmines, you join a group that was formed in general chat and enter. At the third boss an item drops that would be a huge upgrade for you and another player in the group. 
---
You and the other player both roll "Need" of course. But wait, the other player joined the group with a friend, and that friend also decided to roll "Need" even though the item is useless to him. Suddenly the other player has a much higher chance of winning, since his friend is going to abuse the loot trading and give him the item if he wins the roll. You should've had 50% chance of winning the loot, but thanks to loot trading you ended up getting screwed and only got a 33.3% chance instead. It's an easy system to abuse.
---
I have been playing warlock since classic there were at least 10 spelld I only saw a few years ago what the picture actually is
---
Well obviously pristine boar asses are the plumpest boar asses that aren't torn to shreds.
---
Not as hard as the bfd jump but a much bigger hassle if you miss it.
---
How does bnet integration allow you to chat with random cross faction players?
---
Not worth it, go straight arms to get 2/2 overpower while dual wielding, you get more overpower procs with DW so your dps will raise a good chunk (execute spam) before you get ww axe at 30 or if you are ally the level 34 axe that is better. Then you do more damage because of + crit to axes and + dmg to dual handed weps
---
A handful of people abusing the system at the very end of the spectrum hardly compromises the entire system.
---
I don't see any reason to punish the vast majority of people just because a few people want to abuse the rank 14 grind.
---
I agree it shouldn't be in, but I can't think of a single person who was blacklisted when played on a private server. Having 4 times the release population means there are too many people to actually face real consequences. One of the reasons I hate seeing polls here where people want gigantic populations.
---
I also think gm tickets to get items back are horse shit. I've never accidentally needed on an item. 
---
Crybabies petitioning GMs means nothing. This was not common and not a problem. For the people who did it on purpose, they aren’t going to give you the item after anyway even if they could and the whole server knew who they were in a short time anyway. 
---
It was rare and only fragile kids ran to the GMs and forums with teary eyes to try and complain about what happened.
---
Blessings are raidwide, totems are not. Also, blessings are better. Totems doesn't come close on blessings, especially salvation.
---
I always thought it was a moon with stars behind it, it's actually a huge night elf female in the sky [https://i.imgur.com/k6s1rOG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/k6s1rOG.jpg)
---
I like carrying around multiple rotting bear carcasses
---
:D Thanks!
---
I invite them to tell me that though, because I really do believe it could be more efficient, so whether or not it's "wasting time" is the pivotal issue. :P
---
Not sure we're gonna get to the bottom of it here though.
---
kicked right in the face
---
I disagree. You say "one bad scenario" as if it would only happen once. These kinds of groups are very common. More often than not, you will see 2 or 3 friends who are playing online together and looking for pugs to fill in the spot for a dungeon run.
---
BUT, to that end, I would argue that you would get the better of both worlds if you could screenshot and report those people. For example, if the guildies are a rogue, priest, and a warlock, and you are a feral druid and the Defias chest piece drops in Deadmines, and you see the priest and warlock "need" as well along with the rogue, and the roll results come up and turns out you beat out the rogue but lost to the priest who can't even WEAR that leather BoP piece, then you could try to resolve the issue with the group (explain how the mage and priest should not have needed on the piece and you are the highest roll of the class that can use the item) and if it doesn't workout screenshot the roll results and open the ticket. 
---
But then we are right back to opening tickets with GMs for things that should have been easy solutions if the group just did what they were supposed to, absolutely defeating the purpose of implementing this feature in the first place.
---
should be able to get that from 1 zhevra.  2 tops.
---
OP should teach religious apologetics
---
woah i thought it was a chubby
---
Sure, they could rebuild the system but that would take dev time they are clearly unwilling to spend. They want to use a system they have built already and takes no work to implement. If they aren't going to pay GM's to deal with those tickets why would they pay devs to make a new system they don't feel they need?
---
Quality post
---
Nah, almost anyone that attempt raiding will these days. Everything is known about gifts, pots, gearing ect.
---
&gt; What sort of dungeon groups do you think you will be running that have 3+ people all rolling need for the same item?
---
&gt; This is vastly overblown.
---
It doesn't have to be 3+ people needing an item. It could be 3 people *potentially* making use of the stats on the item. 
---
You, a mage join a group looking for a last spot to Strat live because you need the pre-raid bis (for dps) spell hit neck off Balnazzar. The group has a warrior tank, a hunter dps, a warlock dps, and a priest healer.
---
The neck drops after the boss and the healing priest wins it. "It has spirit bro, it's an upgrade", he proceeds to trade it to his warlock friend unbeknownst to you.
---
You gonna go on the forums with that and get them blacklisted  with screenshots that can't prove it was malicious?
---
This doesn't take some "being struck by lightning twice" type of bad luck to occur. Joining a group with "just one" other guy needing it but it ends up being two due to the healer isn't rare. Especially as a clothie.
---
but the VC dungeon is super fun. One of the most fun experiences I had in wow was doing the dungeon blind for the first time after the redo.
---
Much more realistic
---
Ok so if they don’t need a new system why is classic going to have a new system?  A coder can change a dialogue query box in 2 minutes. Dev cost is next to zero. 
---
Many many guild dont even try to do naxx because tbc was annaunced.
---
You would think so, wouldn’t you? 
---
Blizzard says No! Those are hooveless Zhevras. Only some have this rare mutation!..
---
There is not even an add on in retail wow today that will make the damage font the way it used to be. 
---
It has nothing to do with the font or the number text. It’s the way it’s displayed on the screen and how the “white hits” showed up. 
---
Loot trading is already happening, blizzard isn’t interested in our opinions on it.
---
Mage. You’re now blacklisted for being a ninja.
---
I strongly doubt it, because have you seen the new raiders that are on pservers? Clickers still exist lol
---
hahaa thanks
---
The only thing I'm suggesting is for people to start talking about it so we don't have a shit show on our hands when Classic is launched.  
---
Also knowing before hand how Quests are going to be handled pre launch will be a huge plus.  
---
I'm not here advocating for changes, I just wanted to get a discussion going.
---
&gt;the niche argument might be whether the level 50 class quests deserve to be gated to the second (bwl) content release. this might make sense because a select few of the rewards (diamond flask) are arguably better than t1 alternatives, and there is already the precedent that some quests (silithus, t0.5) will be gated to a later content release.  
---
My thoughts exactly but that ties in with other quests in general. You get a pre raid bis physical dps trinket from Raventusk, so is having Raventusk delayed on the basis of delaying Level 50 class quests because of the pre raid bis gear you get from them warranted? If we skip out on Raventusk, do we also skip out on Thorium Point? And so on, and so on.  
---
The easiest thing will be to just roll out all quests at launch and just gate the class quests along with the epic ones from 1.4. But now really knows what's Blizzard's take on it.
---
Yes I have, and naxx was done in vanillla with clickers too.
---
i always thought it was like two people one fell from like a cliff and he just caught him before he fell never realized it was just a gaunlet in blood
---
Shouldn't this not be an issue with cross-server PvP (which is a Vanilla feature) ?
---
It's too cluttered and gigantic. Doesn't help that it looks to be on a Draenei, though. [This image](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/610590-tier2-paladin.jpg) also doesn't do the set justice.
---
The new sets all have too much going on. Judgment is a skin-tight robe basically, with all the "clutter" being on the shoulders, patterns not counting. The new one has scrolls coming out of every orifice. It does look like old T2 had that, but it was just painted on the model instead of animated, like now.
---
Potentially a case of "the technology just isn't there yet" being a good thing.
---
It isn't a new system. Classic is built on modern wow, it is part of the game already. It would in fact take work to remove it. If you are so sure that would fix this problem perhaps you should tell blizz how easy your solution is. I mean they will ignore you because this system is already in game and works fine, but maybe you will feel better.
---
Ever notice how the pro-Blizzard folks are ALWAYS the ones demanding more moderation?
---
Really does make you think..."posts I don't like are spam!!!!"
---
Sure I get that, difference is there is a lot of infrastructure now that is cheaper than it was in 2005, they're saving their money in other places now.  Such as not having physical servers.
---
I actually can't imagine shilling this hard for a corporation. Yeah poor fucking Blizzard.
---
How about they charge us 5 bucks for classic WoW because it's the same fucking game? There's an idea for you buddy.
---
Oh but I know, we have to think of poor Blizzard's profit margins!
---
Funny enough, private servers aren't even strictly "no changes". Cheaper respec, changes to dm north to prevent farming, hunter quest demon respawn timers, rare spawn timers (particularly Lupos), no non bg weekend. 
---
That's just off the top of my head playing one class. And many of those have social ramifications. No needing help to get certain spawns. No having a free non bg weekend to do whatever pvp you like, which makes the pvp meta more boring (only do the holiday bg, because others have nobody). Less being stuck in your pvp or farming spec, since you can switch back and forth for half the cost.
---
Everything in the game has a social implication to it, it's an mmo. The above poster is just stuck on his high horse. 
---
Well if it works just fine then why are there daily threads pointing out the flaws in the loot system. Vanilla didn’t have personal loot like retail so the looting system is not appropriate for the original wow
---
Redditors eat that shit up. Of course, it's just a convenient way for them to avoid having any sort of constructie discussion at all. 
---
Awesome, also great way to fill downtime between run lockouts would be doing this for 15min then studying/chores/cooking. You could also log off and work on an alt for 45min as well.
---
They run Classic with cheaper hardware and no content updates, are you really worried about Blizzards economy?
---
&gt;friends can need on items and trade them to their friends.
---
It still leaves a 20% chance that they don't get the item. Why wouldn't get just get one more friend and make it 100%? I am so tired of this argument. Also if someone was really only running the dungeon for a single item, they would make it themselves and bring others who couldn't use it or don't need it. 
---
This is just the "in the worst case scenario" being taken as common place. It is a simple change in the loot system so Blizzard don't need way more GMs to fix dumb mistakes when it comes to looting. Blizzard will not go back on it, and it does not change the gameplay in any way shape or form. If they really wanted to eliminate this entirely, they would use the modern version of loot where it's individual loot. It sounds like most of you would prefer that, since it's more "fair". Oh you wouldn't? Weird. Sounds like all the classic purists are complaining just to complain. 
---
Not talking about you specifically. But jesus I am so tired of reading about this non-issue. 
---
Right? Everyone defending Blizzard is making it out to seem like Blizzard is trying to do whats best for the game when in reality it is all about saving money and nothing else.
---
Did he make it up, or just pick the wrong server. You can't have it both ways, man, jfc.
---
Loot trading won’t even matter, most people will be in a guild from a very early stage.
---
Yes this is the best comp I’ve been able to find for speed farming dungeons. 
---
You NEED a priest for spamming holy nova and to Rez when people die and the best tank for this would actually be a Druid because you can hot yourself up before pulls which helps with aoe threat and healing of course, the tank blowing all his mana every pull doesn’t hurt your clear time since the healer needs to drink between pulls anyways. 
---
The only problem I’ve faced is the massive amount of water you blow through so to make it work while you’re leveling either swap out a lock for a frost mage or make good friends with a mage that’s around your level. 
---
One way is that they’re getting roflstomped by a premade that dodged another premade, I think. It funnels premades toward PUGs far more than chance would do. 
---
&gt; Ok. Now I’ve confirmed it. You’re twelve. Or at least I hope you are, because if you’re not you have the maturity of one.
---
________
---
Whatever.
---
&gt;Ok. Now I’ve confirmed it.     
---
You confirmed nothing. Where's your logic?
---
I'm not pro blizzard, I'm not even saying you're wrong... I'm just saying we dont need a fucking daily thread beating this dead horse. Really makes you think... "I want easily upvoted attention so I'll create more uninspiring spam"
---
Why would you waste your time needing an item you don’t need to make like 5 gold? There are far more efficient ways to make gold.
---
Applies to both wow and OW and they’re completely wrong with both. 
---
Figuring out how to break mechanics is a clutch you can lean on though. During Cata my dungeon running group was going for the achievements and one of them was to have the whole group avoid getting a static charge. It was this: 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=5288/no-static-at-all#comments 
---
Well, I just went and put levitate on all the range and popped it on the tank when I could to help out. ez pz
---
Shaman totems only effect the 5 people in your group out of the 40 in raid so you'll have multiple shamans using totems, the dps increase covering your lack of dps doesnt really work out that well since you could instead have a Resto sham buffing them with totems
---
The system was in for quite a while before personal loot. The complaints are all hypothetical. People complaining about a system they don't understand, that they haven't seen in action, and that has worked fine with very few complaints for years now. There are flaws, but blizz has made it clear they are not going to hire GM's for this, but they still want to solve the issue. In this case complaints are not going to do anything, the system is already a thing and will be in. Most of the abuses have community solutions, that is the best we can do unfortunately.
---
19 Twinks are so fun because it’s just complete nonsense. No one has any skills, half the people have greens and whites while large swaths of people spend absurd amounts of money on BoE epics, carries to unleveled quest rewards on gear disproportionally better than their level, and all other manner of engineering and strange and rare consumables.
---
Absolutely can’t wait.

Hey guys,

GCD for a warrior is 1.5 seconds.
---
bruh lifesteal
---
pimpin' ain't easy. or cheap.
---
&gt; best tank for this would actually be a Druid
---
What I was thinking too. The info I have for tank column is swipe. And if everything ends up stunned after the first tick, BAM Hurricane.
---
&gt;The only problem I’ve faced is the massive amount of water you blow through
---
1 Moonberry Juice / Morning Glory Dew @ 4s / 8s ea per pull = 2G / 4G per hour. Offset by mob drops, so yeah, kinda pricey, but manageable. One mage please!
---
Yes, wotlk was released after vanilla so you can have vanilla gear and wotlk talents 
---
Lol you don't get to invalidate my experiences just because you disagree with them. 
---
Feint is an awful ability
---
The problem with vanilla is that many classes compete for the same items in dungeons, while others need nothing. You’ll end up only getting classes that compete with you for loot etc. 
---
It’s not a huge problem but I think you’re playing it down. If you can make your own group it doesn’t matter, but if you join groups as the odd one out I’m sure you’ll face this problem. 
---
The way many people seem to think about this problem is that if you can coordinate this you can secure the item without any foul play. That is not always the case, and those groups might take advantage of a random player. I just want a system where that isn’t possible. The old system required you to state the loot rules before the dungeon, or you had to ninja the item. I prefer that.
---
I used to chain-sap lowbies in front of stitches that were doing the escort quest to Darkshire. Master stitches is a hungry abom &gt;:)
---
I mean think about it this dude is actually worried about Blizzard's profit margins being cut into by operating costs. Just think about the level of corporate bootlicking involved in a post like this. I actually have trouble understanding it. 
---
Individual loot is a far better system for keeping things fair. Undeniably so. Why would you want a system where you can ninja at all? 
---
I feel like he was thinking of desolace when he wrote that
---
It's not spam just because it has an opinion you don't like. Get over it dude. 
---
"we dont need"...I mean just stop bullshitting. What you mean to say is "I don't like these sorts of threads so they should be deleted". Just be honest about it.
---
You're not getting it, it's obviously you didn't play vanilla at the time or on a private server. Joining a random strat/scholo group suddenly sounds a lot less appealing when you know it could be a group of 4 trying to win the same item you need just to trade it to their friends.
---
If you don't get it, please don't try to sound like you do, it makes everyone confused.
---
Fucked up once and left. I'm not down to tank after i miss the impossible jump(fall) because i fell sideways.
---
with how much better players are and how much more we know it wont be difficult to clear a raid even with 10 meme specs in the group is the thought process
---
Server transfers I believe were available back then.  IIRC, they would often offer free transfers to players to balance servers out.  Like if Windrunner had an 80/20 alliance split and Doomhammer had a 75/25 horde split, they might give alliance free xfers from Windrunner to Doomhammer, and horde free xfers from Doomhammer to Windrunner.  
---
&gt;I actually have trouble understanding it.
---
The only thing I can come up with is the majority of them are legitimate shills and tourists who are coming from Retail WoW who don't mind changes since they don't actually care for a Vanilla expereince which has both bad and good parts.
---
Name a class that isn’t viable in classic.....
---
&gt; Funny that people think they will actually clear Naxx LOL, just the top guilds will.
---
Yup, that's what I was thinking, too. No way everyone is gonna be able to do the dances, Horseman, all that, perfectly. It was an everything-check: gear, skill, profession.
---
Even in TBC, people complained they *still* couldn't do it, even with 10 extra levels.
---
crime will always happen. why do we even have a police force anyways?
---
This brings me back. I remember farming this guy around level 40 just to get the mace as a stat stick, didn’t even know just how good it was back then. It’s also the one reason I won’t be rolling a feral again as much as I’d like to, that’s way too much extra farming for me just to be remotely competitive. Good guide.
---
While I hated WPL as a levelling area, I'm surprised he threw it away as just an inferior version of EPL. Half the area is a gigantic swarm of zombie/alien shit (I can't remember the lore lol) that is unlike anything in EPL. It didn't feel as full of content as EPL but it certainly was different!
---
Honestly I rocked a lvl 1 twink rouge and would just destroy lvl 8-10 I've duels
---
What you are describing occurs regardless of whether or not loot trading exists. Priest will roll on spirit hit neck regardless, and beat you regardless. Trading it to his buddy later gets him marked as a ninja, when you tell priest to equip his neck. 
---
I don't know...I don't think they are getting paid (moderators are the ones who get paid on reddit). Fanboyism is just a powerful drug and these people are addicted. They are so emotionally attached to Blizzard that they will defend any level of abuse. You see this with a lot of different communities from EA and FIFA to Chris Roberts and Star Citizen. 
---
Can we have a dedicated subreddit for this?
---
Did you read my comment or are you just naturally defensive?
---
I said, in my previous comment, ***I'm not even saying you're wrong*** because I agree with you in general.
---
However, nothing you've said hasn't been said before. You've offered no insights that haven't been commented on before, even in this same fucking week already. 
---
Your thread is spam. I've been honest about that. It has nothing to do with my personal opinions because, like I said, ***I agree with you in general***. It just bloats this sub more with shitty whining that isn't needed.
---
I feel like I have to respond to this stock NPC response every day on here.
---
Very few people  abused this. I personally didn't encounter ANYONE rolling on something for someone else in Vanilla.
---
But now? It will be expected in PUGs that you bring a friend to help you out. It's a terrible change and it cannot go into Classic.
---
Bliss would be no where near where they are today had they not had the combined resources from the merger years ago...but ok
---
11 years of wow and never notice that
---
Hat has nothing to do with changing anything though.....
---
I think 3x frostbite imp blizzard mages would probably be easier and faster.
---
There is Azshara and most likely N´Zoth for BfA, while Void Lords could be potential enemy in the future.
---
Other than that, there is a possibility of Sylvanas or Bolvar acting as an antagonist in the future (not that I like it, but it´s possible) with expansion themed around undead or death in general (Bwonsamdi supposedly has a master).
---
Besides that, there are hints at Dragon Isles and new black dragons being hatched, so we could see return of dragons as main plot point too.
---
So, what I'm hearing is that people want a genuine classic experience with complex social interaction but when people make use of this social interaction, they want changes so those people can't do it any more.
---
Is that right?
---
You are not understanding the point. Mages could roll need on plate. Mages didn't typically roll need on plate, because it got them blacklisted as ninja looters. With loot trading, you can roll need and trade items to a friend. With loot trading, you won't typically roll need on loot to trade or sell because if you do it once you get blacklisted as a ninja.
---
Do you not understand how the situations are similar? If the threat of being blacklisted as a ninja looter was enough to stop mages from rolling need on plate drops, I think the same will be fine to control potential loot trading abuse.
---
&gt; It has nothing to do with my personal opinions
---
then...
---
&gt; shitty whining that isn't needed.
---
You just offered a personal opinion as a justification for deleting this thread. Again, stop with the bullshit. You don't like this thread, so you want it deleted. It really is as simple as that. 
---
&gt; Why do we have to argue and defend a system that is bad for the experience that we all want?
---
People always defend deleterious corporate policies. Of late I've been wondering if there is an extremely sophisticated and comprehensive marketing/shilling network that covers most conversations on the internet -or- if people are doing that psychological trick where, since they know the thing is going to suck, they convince themselves they like it to avoid frustration. 
---
OK yh yh I see it now cheers
---
Individual loot is better at preventing these situations, but it can also be abused in the way Asmongold does it. Where he brings tons of one class to gear up, it would also have to be tweaked so paladins could actually loot cloth etc. I also don’t really enjoy looting a boss and finding nothing, I like seeing loot. 
---
I just want the system that was implemented in vanilla, I don’t really want to change that. I also think that the new system is an improvement to a very small problem for the players but a big problem for Blizzard at the cost of us. 
---
Ahh, very nice to know thanks!
---
All companies have online PR teams and or a company hired by them. If Blizzard can spend a few thousands to help push an idea that will save them millions I think it is something businesses are willing to do. I do think the rabid fanboys make up a larger percentage of the group I still think it is highly possible to actually have paid shills.
---
I know! I cannot wait to see old org :’)
---
That has absolutely nothing to do with loot trading. If you are a warlock and you join a scholo group with 2 other warlocks and a spriest healer who insists on rolling on warlock gear, you screwed yourself. Step away for a second and look at this from both perspectives. With loot trading, the other warlocks may collude and pass an item to a buddy they won over you. Without loot trading, they can't do that but they are still absolutely going to roll on every upgrade they can, so you are still rolling against 3 other players.
---
The easy solution: don't join ridiculously unbalanced groups.
---
All specs and classes are viable.
---
I always thought it was a Boot in PlateArmor.
---
Because it’s good for the game to have sharding in the  starting zones 
---
Oh yeah without a doubt. I just tend to think the paid shills are the power players - the people who moderate subs related to the corporation in question, and high karma superusers who've mastered reddit's content distribution system in such a way that allows them to consistently farm upvotes. 
---
This dude here is just naive and a big Blizzard fan who really wants his favorite company to maximize profits at the expense of their customers. 
---
Im actually planning to go horde, the original one. But not decided about the race yet.
---
Early zones, starting zones, what’s the difference?
---
lol most people couldn't even clear naxx 25 in wotlk, nevermind shit like Immortal runs.
---
I don't like it because it's spam, so yes. You keep repeating the same thing over and over, what do you want? 
---
I know man.. I’m still on the fence about class.. I had a mage to 42 and warrior 60 in vanilla but I had AOL dial up sooooo I’d like to try the 40man with a real connection. I actually killed luci in molten core somehow dc’n reconnecting taunting just to dc again lol! 
---
The early zones are the starting zones.
---
Starter zones are he early zones.
---
Starting zones are the 1-10. The areas your character starts in. You then leave the starting areas and enter the early zones. The thing is where do early zones stop? No one knows because there is no widely accepted definition of early zones. It could stop are 20 or go to level 30 zones. No one knows.
---
I like the idea, but 15% ea to freeze. 90dps for blizzard vs 152 at level 45 (for example) means time to kill is closer to 20 seconds, with only half of the mobs being stunned.
---
&gt; It seems like you are trying to imply that loot trading makes things worse, when your chances of winning loot against 3 other players is the exact same either way.
---
If I want a specific item from the last boss for example a spell damage ring, I'm going to try and join a group where people either already have that ring or don't need it because they're melee for example.With loot trading a fucking rogue could take my spell damage ring to trade it to his healer buddy's offspec.
---
I want you to admit that you want this thread to be deleted because you don't like it. I've been pretty clear I think. 
---
Starter zone and early zone are interchangeable terms. It’s obviously 1-10 at the most of not only 1-6. 
---
To suggest anything else would be hyperbole and based on no evidence 
---
to level up?
---
And I've admitted that - I don't like it because it's spam. 
---
Do you have a reading disability? Holy fuck. 
---
California 
---
Yeah but did you have Crusader though?l
---
Im saying that in retail you out level these dungeons in ~30 mins. It seems like more of a waste of time doing entry level dungeons. 
---
Here's some data from a pserver, showing how many guilds have completed each raid.
---
Raid | Guilds
---
---|---
---
MC | 147
---
BWL | 130
---
ZG | 95
---
AQ20 | 99
---
AQ40 | 67
---
Naxx | 18
---
([source](http://legacyplayers.com/))
---
Unfortunately, only 1 server has enough data to display.
---
But it's pretty common knowledge that many guilds/players start dropping off around AQ and few make it to Naxx.
---
Going by this data only 12% of players that clear MC end up clearing Naxx.
---
I am very curious as to what explanation you would give to the drop of a two handed sword I found in a swarm of flies in Diablo 2
---
Classic dungeons scale to 60 as well now
---
Why won't you say it dude? Come on now. Surely it's not that hard to avoid euphemism. Also, please refrain from insulting me as that violates rule 2!
---
Is English your first language?
---
12% is huge compared to the 1% of original naxx in vanilla.
---
Someone in another thread suggested tweaking meme specs. For enhancement shamans he suggested stormstrike to be a self buff rather than a Debuff. also he mentioned storm trike reducing cost of the next spell by 75%.   
---
Do you think that would be adequate enough? Or maybe affect PVP too much?
---
Yes.
---
How in the HELL is Silithus above 18 other zones?!  WTF
---
This would definitely take some practice. My major concern is holding aggro, especially at lower levels. Swipe won't be enough to train all those hellfires. 
---
Another big issue I see is having to stop and heal everyone up afterwards, then getting mana. Even if everyone stops to eat after that would still be a big slow down. 
---
I'm thinking maybe a team of mages might be more effective or even hunters once multi shot is available? 
---
So to you starter and early have the exact same definition?
---
I wasnt aware. Even so, it seens unnecessary when there are much easier pre 60 dungeons with better rewards.
---
Just doesnt seem "efficient" in terms of retail leveling
---
Shaman typically play a 30/0/21 spec even as dedicated healers. Priest are superior healers but shamans can burst people down pretty well. 
---
Needs more Perdition's Blade and Core Hound Tooth
---
I haven't insulted you, I've levied a valid inquiry because you're having problems understanding what I'm saying. 
---
Ah well, enjoy making more posts beating a dead horse homie. 
---
Don't you guys have PCs?
---
I believe content will be released in such a way as to incentivize cross play on Classic and Retail.
---
Basically I agree with what Nixxiom says in this [video](https://youtu.be/S4nhQfp0NDg)
---
What you listed for wanting things to be how they were is what nostalgia is. So you agree. 
---
That's called ninja looting, and had nothing to do with loot trading. I had a hunter roll on a spell damage staff. You report them for ninjaing and kick from party.
---
WoW is a dead horse and we are all beating it brotha
---
Tank aggro should be unnecessary if the warlocks hellfire stunlocks the whole crowd.
---
And even with 30 seconds downtime after every pull, plenty time to eat and drink up to max for everyone, we're still at massive amounts of XPH.
---
Mages and hunters should be able to do some good AOE damage, but they're limited by tank's AOE threat. The goal here is stunlocking to avoid threat issues altogether.
---
true, but most people just do every dungeon at least once for the quests. I'm no expert in leveling efficiently though
---
Twinkling at 19 is so boring. It is just so slow, and 90% of all twinks are pallies
---
They don’t have the exact same definition in all contexts, but they could easily be interpreted as meaning the same thing in this context, especially if people view Deathknell as a starter zone and Tirisfal as an early zone. Either way, sharding stops by level 12 or so. 
---
Probably that "too much going on" is what I am experiencing, and missing the clearness.  
---
As I further researched, this model is a standalone and not the one from HotS. It seems like just a bulkier human imo. Personally, I like the scrolls and 3d effects put on it, but dislike the modified parts and the color palette, mainly the overuse of gold in there. 
---
I see I see. Yeah, if the stun proc works out then this is probably excellent. Any idea if diminishing returns works on this? Might be rough in some dungeons as well. Final area of Uldaman those troggs can 3-5 shot clothies. But if you can farm the entrance and reset that might make up for the xp. 
---
Is the goal to clear the dungeon fully, or xp/hr? If its xp/hr doing a loop in that first cave area of WC I'd imagine would give awesome xp, same with SFK 
---
&gt;and every game has a end eventually.
---
No, moar classic.
---
The druid can actually HoT the Warlocks after Hellfire for even more threat
---
Try to set up a straw man? 
---
Thats actually really interesting. It is much higher than vanilla or current retail numbers for mythic. Not sure what that means but definitely interesting. I think your original points stands though. I want to clear Naxx but I almost guarantee that I am going to hit a wall at some point and need to push through it. 
---
Well, it doesn't come from a "no changes at all guy" because that's a contradiction to your post.
---
&gt; Any idea if diminishing returns works on this? Might be rough in some dungeons as well.
---
DR won't be an issue if the pack dies in 7, 8, 9 seconds. And the goal is XPH, maybe full clears with a legit tank here and there for an item or two?
---
The whole point of sharding is to reduce overcrowding. People actually think the time it takes from 1-10 which is 2 hours on the fast side is going to fix the overcrowding in the early zones? The way people are making out how large the server populations will be then sharding will have to continue into at least level 30 until people can spread out into the world.
---
So you agree it's nostalgia based. 
---
Immortal with ICC gear is ez pz
---
Oh... I always thought it looked like one of those long dangly sabatons(?) walking on blood
---
most wont have that option for those legs at a reasonable rate because the chain quest requires honored reputation with ironforge
---
This would not be good for rogues and druids
---
Agreed.
---
70% of players on trial accounts didn’t even make it 10. Also, there are more zones once you break out of the 1-10 zones, so population would be lower in those zones just because of that. Additionally, people don’t level at the same rate so they will grow apart once outside the relatively artificial constraint of the whole world spawning at 6 points in the world and then going to a railed questing/tutorial experience. 
---
You will be more then spread out enough by barrens 
---
So the tank is only needed for unstunnable bosses? In that case a pally tank is probably best due to good aoe damage during trash packs and being able to tank bosses. Also, the pally could just heal during trash if needed.
---
I'm sure, considering it was removed before Ulduar...
---
Not looking to heal. As priest was thinking disc or shadow, as sham ele or enh.
---
That is one zone. What about all the humans in Elwynn Forest? 500-1000 people supposedly fighting for Hogger. That is why early zones in this case isn't synonymous with starter. Early in this case will be as far as Wetlands and Duskwood at least.
---
Tank if we want to do bosses, so it's then a standard tank, healer, 3x dps group.
---
Pally tank would be terrible, cause 90% aoe damage is reflect, and stunned enemies do no damage to reflect. So it'd be Consecration only. Holy for Consecration + heals + stun is a not terrible option.
---
Loot trading being available gives you more incentive to ninja loot, that much should be obvious to you 
---
I thought the lowest epic in the game was like level 35
---
It was removed in Cata.
---
I believe with what Ohhgee is suggesting, you can leave the queue if the queue hasn't popped yet. But if the queue pops and you decide not to enter then you'll be flagged for 15 minutes.
---
People defending Loot Trading, Sharding, and Battle.net in the fucking recreation of Vanilla. 
---
It's a bizarre world. It really feels like people are so used to eating shit that they want to pretend to want their next meal to be shit so it doesn't hurt as bad when it's shit. Cowards. 
---
That's a very bad idea. 
---
Well if youre not doing bosses you might as well go 4x warlock.
---
There won’t be 500-1000 people in one arena, people level at different speeds and there are 2 other starter zones available.
---
Early zones are those early in the game ie 1-6 possibly 1-10 at most. 
---
Whenever I have to fight an animal to the death with a weapon IRL; I always aim for the paws. You've obviously never killed a zebra with a sword.
---
oh I see you're right, I was thinking of the Black Proto Drake reward.
---
The same logic doesn't apply to events like the gates of AQ, the opposite logic does. Questing/leveling zones weren't designed for large amounts of players in the same area which is why sharding can east that problem at lauch. Sharding lets players quest and kill mobs and level up.
---
Events on the other hand are designed for the opposite thing, they are designed for lots of people in a small area. The gates are a realm event with the intention that a large portion of the players gather together to share one single event. There aren't quests or loot tied to killing all the monster the pour out the gate, the entire intent is for the server to rally with each other and take on the AQ
---
mobs as a faction.
---
You shard the AQ event you're actually worsening the gameplay experience for the players, not improving it.
---
Kharanos and Thelsamar?
