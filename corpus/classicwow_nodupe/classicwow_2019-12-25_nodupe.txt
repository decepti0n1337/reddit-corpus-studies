What do you have against pizza?

You sir are a true hero

7 Holy Bois, 1 fraud and 1 work experience kid.
---
\+healing and mana/5 are useless if we are talking about dungeons exclusively.  Far better to only stack int than either of those stats.
---
You have achieved ultimate wow status
---
Yeah man, how dare 2 consenting adults agree to play a game between each other that doesn't affect anyone else.
---
Looks like you did yer job.  Hemadtho
---
Maybe a n00b question. But why the skinning knife? Does it stay tradable with the enchant on it? Can I use this at level 1?
---
Thanks
---
I believe it's the loading screen for the Hall of Legends in Orgrimmar. Equivalent of the Officer Barracks in Stormwind.
---
It's useful there but in most cases I just lifetap when movement is required and HP isn't in danger
---
460 blaze it
---
I do believe it works this way. If you buy BFA you just get everything else that came before.
---

---
Yeah, BFA isn't for everyone, but a ton of people still play it. I have fun with it once and a while. I wasn't a huge fan of it, so I stopped pretty early after only getting one toon to 120, I just recently came back to maybe attempt to finish BFA flying, and get the other 11 characters to 120, for some weird reason. I am having fun with what I am doing, not really sure what the end game is looking like though.
---
This is a dangerous sub to express even mildly pro-retail thoughts, thanks for being level headed about it!
---
Honestly all this talk makes me really happy I have a great dps and tank set. Been tanking more lately because all the warriors who are good/dedicated have everything from every dungeon.
---
xD
---
Not everyone wants to manipulate every extra second out of the game...
---
I won my first tier piece last week, it was the giantstalker chest that got raid rolled since noone wanted it.. I'm a warrior.
---
We're obviously talking about alliance guilds here man.
---
Then I have no idea what your point even is.
---
You literally said that throwing a ball isn't as readily available as playing a video game.  I'm not sure what planet you're from where that would be true.
---
There's farm more obstacles to playing a video game then playing a lot of traditional sports (certainly not all).  And people sit on their couch and watch those sports instead of playing them.  That's the point others were making.  Not sure what your point is.
---
It's good for war tanks. Not sure about druids but I don't see how it's bad
---
As a holy pally I like ret pallies that keep blessings up on the group without reminders, throw a heal/cleanse when necessary, and adjust their aura to benefit the group not sanctuary which only benefits them.
---
I don't...I don't like most ret pallies.
---
Yeah man that totally has everything to do with RMTing and gambling laws.
---
Awesome, thanks for the tip. May make a shammy later this week!
---
Yup this is just a video of some asshole fishing in AV
---
0/10 OP
---
Doesn't mean a guild is going to want to run a shadowpriest though.
---
Yeah, really, assuming this about people tanking lowbies is more suggestive of some psychological pathology than anything
---
You're so wrong.
---
this is the ghost of Christmas future
---
You're the problem. People with your mindset are the problem. The "sweaty neckbeards" that are actually good plays the game completely independently from other more casual players and have little to no impact on them, yet some "woke" people like you seem to think they know that we either look down on you or are trying to tell you that you're playing the game wrong, which simply isn't the case. Most people that do that does it outside of the game and most likely just have big mouths. Why in your mind do you feel the need to talk down on people who like to min-max, when the people who are actually min-maxing pretty much never talk down on any other type of player in WoW? Just mind your own business and let us play however we want, we are not trying to disturb anyone, we're literally just playing the game the way WE enjoy it.
---
guild has yet to see a binding or an eye
---
Only Totems you should drop are WF and Strenght. Aim for 100% uptime. Use max rank Lesser Healing Wave when your group is taking big damage. Bind rank 1 Earth Shock, and interrupt when needed. Use Mana Tide Totem on CD to reduce downtime. Drink asap when you leave combat.
---
As a Tauren player in Undead zones - eg, Hillsbrad - the Undead are completely transparent about their goals to develop new biological plague weapons capable of killing nearly all living things.  There are several entire quest chains entirely built around it.     
---
  
---
There’s absolutely no way the Tauren would have anything to do with them.  Blizzard writing is patchwork and sloppy.
---
I don't understand anything about this post. What is deathroll?
---
[removed]
---
What's your ingame name? I think I played with you in that BG, what a great AV win that was.
---
Kurinnaxx is slightly favored for Horde but otherwise a good server.
---
Yes, the little guy is always stuck in that tree.
---
Yea Zeroji is a beast alright! My best is about 11 minutes even with copying his pulls to get to the boss quickly so very impressed with your 7:06. 
---
Realistically with mobs resisting FD (even with the talent) you still die sometimes at bottom of the ramp so getting to 5 an hour consistently would be pretty difficult. Do you scatter conc the ogres for that pull or use your pet so you can LOS feign death?
---
It effects everyone on the bracket that isn't abusing the bug. So, on Faerlina, 4500 people.
---
Yeah man cuz everyone who gambles with their friend is real money trading gold right?
---
I was so confused as to what this was at first
---
We were doing zf gy melee cleave for xp with priest/sham/3 warr and it was probably the most fun I’ve had in classic so far.
---
15-25g per person?  UD Strath takes a solid 45 minutes, especially if you're dragging a bunch of pugs through.
---
I used to but not anymore since I dont care to do the easy raids that vanilla has and its not difficult at all. The only way its difficult is if youre a moron who doesnt know how to properly delegate responsibilities.  
---
If you are the gm of a guild and are responsible for invites, leading the raid and dispensing gear, youre more than likely not a good gm. Like *extremely* likely.  
---
Its not hard organizing and prepping a raid. Saying that having that ability makes a player is "good" is *never* going to be used in that context as well because its absurd to use it that way. Like when someone goes "damn, that player is good!" They will never be talking about their organizational skills lol

The only advantage alliance has is the bridge, which is made irrelevant due to backdooring.
---
GOOD IDEA !!
---
Lmao. Love it. The other day a teammate knocked me off the bridge and we spent the final 10 minutes on the bridge killing each other.
---
At one point he intercepted a horde player to position himself to knock me off. Respect
---
Meh I’ve got it down to 30 minutes, but I generally bring a shaman for windfury to speed things up. 25g per run, so 50 per hour.
---
god damn if you can not think outside of your tiny ass 2 man world then theres no fucking hope for you. Holy fuck I hope you're trolling because holy fuck if you're not you're actually fucking stupid.
---
I though spdmg ret doesn't take off until late BWL?  Right now, I think ap ret is the way to go if you even want to try doing damage.
---
i feel it, no bindings/eye yet either.
---
Still waiting on boots bracers helm to drop haven't seen them yet.
---
over 0.5 +180
---
"Human waste"? I feel terribly sorry for whatever put you in this sort of mood on Christmas eve.
---
I'm not advocating they should but I would imagine something like this:
---
- New max level zone (Hellfire Peninsula?)
---
- New Raids (Karazhan and Magtheridons Lair?)
---
- Guild Banks
---
- Extra graphics sharers
---
- Azshara Crater BG?
---
- Extremely minor balance changes, e.g. prot paladin taunt ability.
---
I know most content would be from TBC but it would be effectively stripped down to fit "Classic"
---
With great gear you can global people with a conflag lock; queue a shadowbolt, while it's flying, hit immo+conflag.  Damage all hits at the same time.  Boom.
---
Claim that all you like, but I'm not going to believe you're doing it in 30 minutes with three pug dps.
---
For a warrior, it certainly is
---
It is, honestly, but I'm a tank, so I want my own little niche.
---
Just use a grounding totem. Oh wait you’re a Druid nvm
---
Don’t wanna be... Scott_by_himself anymore!
---
(Cue drum solo and drunken warbling)
---
In 3 weeks I got Leaf/Sinew, 5/8 Giantstalkers, 2/8 Dragonstalkers, Rag agi cape. My hunter was my alt too, rushed her to 60 when all our hunters quit and I was already addicted and playing a lot.  
---
Went from 58 to most geared person in the guild in those 3 weeks.
---
They are totally trying to copy classic into Shadowlands with adding old skills like curses,poison lvl to 60 etc ..Even rushing Classic so it would be over right before they release Shadowlands
---
I hope people aren't dumb enough to fall for it retail has been trash for a while
---
Dude. I'm a nightelf with edgemasters. A mace is my pre bis MH? Lol
---
This sub in a nutshell
---
This!I am 90% sure you had to requeue new members this is some weird legion client thing.Blizz is fucking up pvp ranking hard first nerfed AV in p2 now this..
---
On mine last I checked healing pots where 60-70s, large mana pots around 2,7g.
---
So healers who actually take pots can easily end up with the highest cost for 5-mans.
---
If it's just a hard pull and not a "oh god we added 4 groups" often the second best potions should do. They are about 1/4th the price of the major ones which helps to keep cost down.
---
Hardest pre-bis grind as well I'd say
---
&gt;I am an atheist married with an atheist in a Christian country and couldn't give less shit about Xmas
---
So brave! Refusing Christmas in a Christian country? Holy shit bro. They'll make a statue of you one day brave soldier.
---
Lol loser.
---
How did it go?!?! I have to know!
---
2-3 hours a day will put you in the high 9/low 10 bracket. It's possible to hit r10 that way, but it will be really tough.
---
 I'm not so sure. That boss requires you killing several mobs beforehand that quite often patrol in pairs, not always though. You would need space to kite them and there isn't much in the first area. The boss itself is beefy too.
---
LMAO this is going into my cringe complication. 
---
Because alliance get instant queues it justifies you exploiting game mechanics? You are a contender for the gold medal in mental gymnastics.
---
Destro lock 1000%
---
It worked on Shattered Hand alliance side. It let people see sunlight for a bit.
---
Ret memes aside I would seriously skip lionheart and cloudkeeper. They are pretty minimal gains for a huge gold investment. Obviously this is not BiS but they really aren't worth it. You're better off turning that money into consumables for the next year (or bolstering your protection set which actually needs BoE items).
---
Horde who abuses this has huuuge honor advantage .This should be fixed but so should nerfed AV thats not supposed to be in game until near end p6 prob
---
What's on the forums? I've been too busy killing boars
---
&gt; I use it on my mage. Great in pvp
---
I definitely see the use for PvP. More health is good.
---
&gt; useful in longer fights like rag where blow through my mana gems as fast as possible.
---
I'm in a fairly casual guild and we get Rag down in about 2:30, so I can maybe pop two gems but the second doesn't matter much.
---
It could be good in longer fights later though.
---
It's an exaggeration, but largely true on my server group. Mostly dead after 1, totally dead after 2.
---
Last few times I went we got like 5 or 6
---
&gt; You never die with plenty of mana left over? 
---
Hasn't happened in a while, stuff's all on farm. But I guess it could be a thing in BWL.
---
There's a very high chance they extend the life of classic as one of the chief complaints about vanilla is that very few got to experience Naxx because TBC came out shortly after.
---
WoW Classic is better than anything else out there right now.
---
The people who are complaining are just serial complainers.
---
No but 20 seconds of doing nothing should have
---
I was still successfully rushing that first weekend as I finished off my rep grind
---
It's... a dumpster fire of people upset about all sorts of things
---
Yeah a wirld buffed ele with flask was doing 8k in a global. Absolutely insane.
---
I don't understand people saying lock is easy. You have 0 mobility and have to facetank everything while wearing cloth. Rogues and warriors you can't get away from ( that's a solid 40% of population if not more) while mages can iceblock your dots and CS your fear the moment you panic.
---
It's not an easy class to PvP on at all. I've had way better mileage from my average skills on my war, mage, hell pretty much anything else than my warlock.
---
So you got trapped in a turtle game and decided to make it worse?
---
Yes. TSM and Auctioneer
---
Saving for later thank you!
---
There's a jump horde can do to bypass the bridge, I havent seen many horde do it so I assume it's because only pserver players know about it
---
Seems kiting would be the only way and a couple folks are saying thats not possible. Oh well!
---
Tldr: going second is best.
---
Its tough. Sometimes we want to hide the exploit so it doesn't get abuse and others we want it to max publicity so it gets fixed asap. Never a really obvious answer on this stuff as a mod.
---
Look he registered for Gehennas in hope of getting a giant bunch of attention using a famous server.
---
He slowly realized that he won't be the best Pokémon trainer of them all, which made him salty about his dreams, but he still chases them, doing BGs all day and night, grinding honor. 
---
Now, some funny dude comes and kicks him off a bridge. He instantly turns red, realizing he might have lost 20 honor. He has to flame. You destroyed his dream!
---
Thanks.
---
Agree.Btw is AV fish worth some good money when everyone fishing there ?
---
I was only referring to parry for that :p
---
I don't claim to be a wise man.
---
Mining is good also.No way i am dropping eng
---
The only dagger that I can think of that has weapon skill is the Distracting Dagger out of Dire Maul, not AV. I'll assume you're referring to Lobotomizer/Distracting Dagger vs. OEB.
---
Anyway, I ran the numbers, and here's what I got:
---
**Gnome, OEB, Alliance 2H slam spec, T1 BiS with full buffs, 60 second fight:**
---
 
---
* 1055.2289 dps.
---
**Gnome, Lobo/DD, standard DW spec, T1 BiS with full buffs, 60 second fight:** 
---
* 1073.4394 dps.
---
So daggers are slightly better, and likely more consistent in practice simply due to the nature of dual-wielding over 2H, especially for Alliance.
---
But, if you compare that to the recommended Edgemaster's gearing route, you get much higher numbers, and a more stable gearing path since daggers aren't sustainable in regard to weapon skill requirements:
---
**Gnome, Vis'kag/Brut Blade, standard DW spec, T1 BiS (sub in Edgemaster's) with full buffs, 60 second fight:** 
---
* 1131.6067 dps
---
Even if you sub in Perdition's/CHT you only get 1103.4460 with Edgemaster's. With the leather gloves you get 1104.5609 dps.
---
Also keep in mind that dual-wielding scales better in the long run than 2H, even as Horde. 2H almost requires offtanking a mob for rage to get the really good parses, unless you get lucky with crits/WF procs for rage gen. 
---
Don't discount how important weapon skill is. It not only reduces the amount of hit you need, which allows you to gear for more damage, but it also reduces the glancing damage penalty, which affects 40% of your white hits. You go from dealing ~65% normal white damage on glances to ~95% with 307 skill (so Edgemaster's), almost negating glances altogether.
---
He's wrong. It has nothing to do with which server you are on, or "current situations". It's because everything is batched. Even chat is batched which is why you're experiencing the kind of lag you're talking about.   
---
Everything is fucking batched and it's so stupid and makes the game feel like shit.   
---
Distract for instance, a spell you could use to turn people who are casting a spell around, is batched.
---
I use setting number 3, and cap at 60 fps. I have a Ryzen with Rx 560x and it stays stuck at 60 fps and doesn't go over 40 degrees for cpu or GPU. Can hardly even hear the fans and the machine is cool.
---
Do the normal honor farm, then tell everyone to recall.
---
Dude just quit playing classic already..
---
Even then they’d win each piece for minimum bid. Most decent guilds would, at worst, put them at negative dkp and charge them min bid on each.  
---
Not being facetious but have you ever been on a team that used it?
---
Whats the easiest way to get mount money?
---
Yeah should have sold mine when price was high! If ppl would do AB/WSG premades sappers would rise but no1 is using them in A
---
Happened to me last week. DC'd playing mage so I logged in on my warrior and was able to go watch my mage despawn.
---
All these people suggesting to only do dungeons are being WAYY too optimistic. The chances of people inviting you to groups is slim to none. You will spend literally all day to get 2-3 runs. 
---
Tanaris&gt;Badlands&gt;Searing&gt;Un'goro&gt;Felwood&gt;WPL/EPL&gt;Winterspring
---
Grind as many mobs as you possibly can between quests. Walk between the objs killing random mobs as much as possible. Doing all the quests will get you to like 58.
---
At 58 you can realistically start dungeons, but even then people are going to avoid you for 60s. Get some good tanking gear and tank dungeons, even if you want to DPS end game. You can tank anything in any spec. Just make sure you watch dungeon guides
---
the fun police has arrived! everyone hide your deathrolls under the table.
---
So, by using that macro with Hemorrhage right when I’m about to auto-attack, I could fish for extra Vis’kag procs?
---
Would it even be worth it compared to just autoing with my off-hand?
---
Yeah some asshole in my guild constantly talks about his r14 grind back in the day, how he slept 15 hours the first day after getting his rank etc. Guy is 26 tops which just makes it hilarious to me. Supposedly he was NEETing it up at like age 11, playing 15 hours a day for months on end. It's so obvious he's full of shit it's actually hilarious to listen to.
---
You also wanna spend like 2k gold especially if you have to buy edgemasters because of weapon luck.
---
Winning 70-80% of games so sounds right.Only lose to good premades but even then we won against some lol
---
Well no, your implication that the tank should stay when he doesnt feel compensated is a pretty big red flag. 
---
explain to me how or why he owes anyone his time?
---
Implying that he should join groups he cant benefit from just for those others in the group is the definition of a greedy mindset. 
---
And also implying that a dps's time is worth anything at all is pretty laughable. Maybe a healers time matters but no, not the dps. 
---
In fact that statement right there pretty much lets me know all I need to know about how you assign value to things. That there's absolute no correlation with supply, demand, or any other factor and value.
---
I've had it for 3 weeks now and I can say it feels very underwhelming. Most likely start going for more +healing oriented pieces going forward and back to chain heal. Priests and druids excel at tank healing so personally it just felt like a lot of overhealing.
---
They said to open a ticket.
---
Do you think the same about mages selling their time by requesting 1g for water or portals? To me that's pretty much the same thing. But many seem to be ok with mages doing their thing but hate on tanks renting themselves out.
---
Even if they didn’t that’s irrelevant because it has been claimed many times by many people.
---
I’m maining a lock and it’s pretty easy honestly, can’t speak for the others yet. It’s easy for me to level because grinding, I just send in my voidwalker, he tanks for me, I set up dots, wand, and move on to next one. Dungeons are pretty similar, just set up dots, Sb And wand. PVP is a little tricky because it seems like so many people play rogue and warrior and it’s hard to come out of a stun. But easier to avoid being stunned with Deathcoil.
---
Summon ice lord and we will win.
---
I've been getting games lately where there's not even 10 on O and they're still screaming in chat "recall or lose".
---
I'm up there with one dude tanking, 1 other dps taking elites one at a time amd getting wiped by 2 defenders and they scream MORE ON D
---
That's toxic, but it works. Alliance is toxic, but it doesn't work.
---
https://ironforge.pro/servers/?filter=true&amp;server=us
---
Shaman. It’s already been proven to be the highest single damage if I recall. I believe there’s some video or proof of a 25k crit but I haven’t watched it in years.
---
Ele Shaman, berzerking buff, power infusion, toep, storm strike debuff, flask of supreme power. And that’s not getting too specific like world buffs, or weapon effects like Thunderfury.
---
I would like to know the same thing. I wish TSM’s UX wasn’t so shit.
---
Just give Sm runs a try. Or lvl up a mage and farm zf
---
Was the post originally put up without a tag? I've had it happen to be on this subreddit, if you don't have a tag, automod removes the thread after a short time and yes you they'll restore the thread if you add a tag.
---
I think people are a little too quick to blame reddit mods for everything.
---
Ret would fit better. At least Druids are useful in a raid. And it looks like somebody has taken Asmongold *just* a little too seriously, lol.
---
Six seasons and a movie..
---
No, but most games that has huge problems with RWT have it precisely because there's ways within the game to gamble. If deathrolling in WoW became as popular as dicing once was in RS2, Blizzard would legally be required to take action against it. Same thing happened to numerous other games.
---
~~🎷🎺🎻🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼~~
---
Warlocks don't have access to enough spell hit gear to even get close to the hit cap. Their shadowbolts get resisted a lot in raids.
---
That’s rough! Took me two months to get my sinew! Feel the pain
---
Also Chad warrior - defeated by defias pillager.
---
That’s really toxic.
---
What a happy and well-adjusted individual.
---
The class balance or viability complaints crack me up. We literally knew the final state of every class. Every tiny bit had bit theory crafted, every inch dissected. With 10 minutes of researched, one would have known everything they needed to know, yet they still feel the need to complain about it.
---
For the alliance! I mean, really, thank you, you're doing the alliance's work by purging us of gnomes.
---
Has front bum.
---
&gt; Most of the times they cant come back.
---
Unlike cancer.
---
And with good reason.
---
As someone who has played a tank for over a decade, I don’t understand how it isn’t other tanks utter compulsion to check the healer’s mana bar before the next pull.
---
Is there a way to equip the same ring in both item slots with a single macro?
---
Using /equipslot 11 and 12 doesnt work. It only equips the first ring. I guess because the game cant differentiate the two identical items.
---
But this is world of WARCRAFT and this dosnt apply to PvP 🤔
---
Correct, I’m 2h fury for raids
---
If you click it does the tooltip also come up in Chinese?
---
Why are you using mana pots for 5-mans? The tank deserves to lose out on a green for that.
---
No, then it’s whatever your client’s language is
---
Ahh. Do they get access to the necessary hit gear in later phases?
---
I’m biased but Druid is probably the hardest to master due to the sheer size of the entire kit.
---
You can pull Drek solo.  So this is a lie
---
WF and STR are the bread and butter totems. Mana Spring up all the time unless Cleansing totems are needed.  Stoneskin for heavy melee fights. Grounding totem for Caster fights. Mana Remnants are a great use.
---
Any kind of source on that?
---
Burning Legion!!!
---
&gt;	Druid: just kinda sucks in classic in every aspect
---
How dare you
---
It’s natural selection. People enjoying the game are playing the game, and those who aren’t enjoying it tend to hang out here and not play. I’m only here when I *can’t* play, lol.
---
Really?
---
thats honor tho, not rep.
---
which is what this post is concerned about, your first case is good case, but if you have to take one of the shitty ones, then the turtle gives far more rep than a 20 min thing.
---
If you can tank reasonably you can do living and lock the first orb.
---
At 35g/orb, and assuming two orbs per run you get:
---
35g (locked orb) + 7g (1/5 chance on second orb) = guaranteed 42g + vendor stuff per run which should take less than an hour.
---
On my server I have even seen people *offering* the first orb to a tank in lfg so groups shouldn't be hard to find.
---
If you do 2-3 hours of casual pvp then i would say r8, if you do "organized pvp" for 2-3 hours then r10 maybe.
---
How is this getting upvotes? ...
---
If you haven't lagged during a city raid then you're lying out your ass lol
---
Honestly this is just false. The difference between someone constantly Hunting honor between ques, and someone that just ques will be infinitely tiny compared to the overall honor they receive. The difference would be more made up for or lost, with a single good or bad AV throughout the day.
---
Just AOE grind from lvl 50 to 60 and buy the mats
---
And this is what classic has become
---
Buff doesn't last long enough for later tiers, you need to bring the druid with you. Technically you're right for MC and BWL though.
---
DM North tribute runs can only be solo farmed by hunters and that is the best gold per hour in the game right now. Actually learning to do the farm will be really frustrating and you will die a lot though (a lot....). It’s not gear dependent, however,  and will get you some great prebis pieces like tarnished elven ring and barbarous blade.  Definitely worth taking the time to learn but just remember a lot of patience is required!
---
This is because I'm taking crit and dodge chance into account!
---
I always assume that these people have personal issues outside the game, then come in and getting trolled sets them off.
---
Whats the minimum rank to enter?
---
I think rank 6. Knight for Alliance side. 
---
Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.
---
cool good job
---
Faker off classic. Thats hilarious.
---
Imagine comparing one of the most mechanically challenging games with classic wow.
---
Trust me. When you reach rank 14 no one will think its because of you "being the faker of classic".
---
No problem as OP druid tank, hots myself and run.. Or inerv healer and go.. Warrior tanks are trash imo
---
Premades don't usually rush drek, they maximize honor by first killing galv, lieutenants and commanders. I spent something like 12-15 hours to exalted with such a premade if k remember correctly.
---
I main a sham but have mained Mage and Warlock in classic and on pservers. 
---
Mage/warlock is a faster level grind. Sham is more versatile endgame. Similiar skill cap for PVP. 
---
I wouldn’t choose a lock or mage over a Sham this go around.
---
My favorite on this sub is the guy that pleaded for appearance changes for classic. It was a shitshow, obviously.
---
Open your eyes.
---
I see what they did there.
---
In general for druids, anything with “Equip: gives a chance for X” works on feral druids but anything with “Chance on hit: X will happen” does not work. For example: HoJ works, but the stun chance from Earthshaker does not when in cat/bear form
---
Wait but you’re commenting in a WoW subreddit. You sure you don’t care about nerd shit?
---
4head
---
Evidence that they can kill Rag?  Ballers.
---
Warriors are pretty decent PvP?

This guy has a point
---
I’m glad someone else sees the idiocy in all of these guilds
---
Christ lad, how big of a ladder do you need to get off that fucking horse you're on?
---
The bandage would've healed him for like 500 and he still would've died if he didn't get the mana to dispel.
---
😏
---
All I'm/He's saying... is make a graphics toggle in the menus for the new models/animations.
---
Urek, is that you ?
---
A tank in Raid 2 got a binding in my guild lol.
---
You deserved it tbh
---
Probably referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States countries, i.e. Ukraine.
---
Happy wintereenmas.
---
Fellow human classic wow players.
---
Looks like a good match.
---
Hey. Going to roll a new character in about 30 min. Have a 60 horde hunter looking to start a new character. Can’t decide so i just want someone to decide for me. What’s my next character Reddit?
---
"alpha male" -&gt; goes into BGs as prot with quel serrar and shield ofc.
---
I helped my warrior friend grind his sgc for 8 weeks straight. Every single day I'd get on we'd run arena till lockout. After our first lock out he'd do whatever sometimes keep running sometimes not. Got a discord call one day after I got off that he finally got it and I swear he was crying. I did atleast 235 runs with him he says it took him over 800. Shits insane.
---
Arguably one of the best talent boxes in the entire game, and of course they stuck it in the resto tree lol
---
You keep a pair to use when their CD is ready. For pretty much forever
---
What are going to be some items I should take a look at now if my goal is to make some profit once P3 comes out?
---
I was thinking about Fire Resistance Gear (especially for tanks), Shadow Protection Pots, Tailoring patterns, etc.
---
Imagine complaining that Blizzard fucked the server up, then having guilds of people transfer off the server.
---
"Thanks for fucking our server up Blizz, heres Thousands of dollars as an incentive to not fix anything"
---
Youre literally the cause of all your complaints.
---
I got similar rage-whispers when I was mining in Silithus and I stole a Mage's mining node while he was fighting a mob.
---
2 minutes later I get whispers from a level 1 warrior, ["I hope you eat shit and die in a fire".](https://puu.sh/Eze9a/a1bb00f88f.png)
---
That's some serious projecting
---
And someone people will get 10% faster wins than you all day and get 20k more honor for no effort. It's 100% not worth it unless you literally want the very first rank 14
---
I’d play classic for now and wait for shadowlands to come out. You’ll have a better leveling experience once blizz revamps the leveling system in the next expac. (1-50 and then shadowlands instead of 1-120. And you can play any previous expansion all the way through from 10-50.)
---
&gt; your implication that the tank should stay when he doesnt feel compensated
---
Suddenly asking to reserve random things in the middle of a run is not "compensation", that's greed.
---
Youll get higher with hard cast lb into ns cl, just have to get the crits. Although wbuffed is something like 40% crit on shaman its nuts
---
BWL does too, but the pieces are pretty highly contested with other casters.
---
I thought it was an automated server restart.
---
Pardon my noob'ness, but how will having an epic mount help the guild?
---
Paladin and warrior? Priest and mage?
---
Shaman/warrior
---
Imagine t3 coe soul fire immo conflag triple crit. With sapph trinket use, that’s disgusting
---
Green is greed unless you actually need it for using it! Had it my self and saw it sometimes, no problem at all. Rolling need just to get gold out of it, NOPE! first time maybe an accident, I give a "warning" second time I get angry and if he isnt kicked already he is by the 3rd time this happens!
---
You can also check spots on your way to king without really slowing yourself down and only go back if a chest is not the locked one or a tome spawn. Also running back out takes like two minutes max if you just jump down using the ledges in slip’kik room. It’s also nice to use the drunk ogre as a vendor and buy out his volatile rum since they usually go for 2x/3x vendor price on the AH.
---
Hot take.
---
Ret paladins know this better than you. Games are meant to be fun.
---
Imagine your guild being this bad lolwut
---
Ya I might be slightly delirious but I coulda swore in vanilla we had a mega geared t3 lock that would spec deep destro for PvP and get crazy shit like 7-8k crits and stuff.
---
Druid
---
That was fucking awesome. They hid the hammer in some presents with a bunch of garbage and it took me a minute before i noticed and lost my shit.
---
Big thanks to all of Sunk Cost!
---
My only complaint as a shaman is the lack of a defensive dispell, otherwise if you find dropping totems annoying, well I'm not sure what to say lol...it's a huge part of the class, and not just in pve, either. Learn to love those totems, what's good for pve (wf, str, mana spring), and especially what's good for PvP (tremor/bind, grounding, poison cleanse, fire nova).
---
That said, great healers, super strong all around except for that defensive dispell.
---
Still missing shoulders and every week NS and vendor strike drops.
---
This is my first time playing AV and have no idea how to do the turn-in quests? Can someone help me out?
---
Some of us our Jewish
---
there he is. the dude himself.
---
Oh. I'm not dope. I'm lame as balls.
---
A lot of the premades will give up if you cap SHGY because it's more honor efficient to lose in 10 minutes and requeue than to take deserter, and both are more efficient than to play a 40 min turtle
---
Dont join us then fuck boiiiiiiiiiiiii ;)
---
BiS. You re not serious without it. /Thread
---
Once I hit my ranks, I will try to make a group to camp hordes in the cave. Lets see how you guys enjoy your 1 hour AV pvp session, stupid recalling bots.
---
Can anyone explain to me the counter argument to Blizzard adding actual guild banks? Really sucks how it currently works.
---
Honestly fury prot is the most common main tank, I don't think druids need armour cap to be affective, but better threat? That's what the dps like.
---
By definition, its not.
---
Druids already have great threat gen, and more armor= you can comfortably pull more mobs
---
What’s your point? Mind your on business.
---
No changes brrrrroooooo!
---
/s
---
I try to get the BG to report AFKs as away. When people inevitable start telling me to STFU, i just go fishing instead.
---
Cant help people that wont help themselves.
---
I'm comparing 1,000 hits vs. 1,000 hits in different circumstances.
---
Mage / mage
---
Really, no gear requirement? I might have to watch some videos on how to do that.  Thanks for the reply!
---
Well, technically r14 weapons will be your BiS - Other top choices will be; Ashkandi, Crul'shorukh, Doom's Edge, Brutality Blade, Core Hound Tooth.
---
#nOcHaNgEs 
---
Unless blizzard feels like it
---
I don't know if they've ever came out and said anything against them, but my guess is since they weren't in Vanilla they are keeping with the #nochanges theme
---
Just because this is the first reddit threat about it doesn't mean people haven't already been doing it, actually it could explain why so many people found radically different proc rates for the same weapons back in 2004-2006.
---
Uh. I'm doing very safe pulls. I get to king area in 6m30s. Kill takes 4 minutes ish and I'm not even pushing hard. 
---
You want to know what the high risk pullers are doing? Zeroji finishes tributes in around 7 minutes. By the time I reach the king area, he's almost done. 
---
Someone actually did the spreadsheet and the average value without DE is slightly over 25g because of mana pots, you have to include those. Even if your server average is 2g, you'll get 6g more from mana pots. (some runs you get 0 and some runs you get 7)
---
Shaman are even more fun in 5man dungeons imo. You can make use of things like rank 1 earth shock to help interrupt mobs, kite with rank 1 frost shock or earthbind, grounding totem spells if ES is on cooldown, and help dps with fire totems all while giving one of the biggest dps boosts in the game to melee- Windfury.
---
That said, Shamans definitely feel a little gimp until you get some mp5. Without any mp5 you go oom quickly. Priests and Druids have fairly efficient heals and regen from Spirit, not to mention Druid innervate. Paladins have Blessing of Wisdom, *insanely* efficient heals and refund mana from crit heals. The only thing Shaman have is Mana Spring, which barely recoups it's own mana cost after 40 seconds and Mana Tide. As a Shaman, you need to gear to fix your regen issues or expect to drink after every pack.
---
&gt; Really? Pretty sure that's made up.
---
Then I am pretty sure you’re wrong.
---
I don't understand the reference
---
I always fuck myself on Christmas
---
Thank you sir.
---
Considering you've presented no evidence to the contrary...
---
Jesus was also Jewish
---
Hi. I love leveling too.
---
If you need to level a paladin or priest, add me.
---
Akafeta#2926
---
Yeah but that's just normal maintanance
---
Ally sucks ass on kurrinaxx though
---
No it wouldn't be worth it, quick question: does Hemo reset your swing timer like SS does?
---
They should of been high elves.
---
This.
---
Would also like to know. Hard to try and figure it out during an AV match.
---
The nochanges thing is BS tho, there’s plenty of changes, it’s just blizzard cherry picking stuff they wanna have in the game
---
Useless addon change my mind I assign the pala buffs with a macro, buff with mouseover. Some raids ago a pala told me he literally couldn't buff infight because of pp - yikes! It's good in TBC when palas actually use their small buffs, for now just overrated.
---
For me it's the best game ever by far. HF at retail
---
&gt;I then tested 900 hits while forcing both weapons to strike in the same millisecond
---
Doesn't read like it...
---
ah i see, i didnt realize it was wednesday morning lol
---
It’s surprising how much reduction you can get with stone skin on certain mobs.  The impa at DME go down to 1 dmg per hit for instance.
---
Oh sorry, someone from my old guild made and had the exact same conclusion as you.
---
This is the correct answer, but I doubt theyll want to do that.
---
Great threat gen... compared to a protection warrior sure.
---
Holy/Ret is pretty fun. Swap to spell damage gear when soloing/farming.
---
r/iamveryrandom there's your answer
---
The server Im on is completely dead :(
---
You got absolutely nothing.
---
I've been able to buff mid fight with it, so that's odd to me. 
---
The main useful thing is the timers, showing every player and their blessings in a quick and easy way. But I'm stingy so every Symbol I can save the better. I tend to hit a few people with bop and freedom throughout an MC run and then replace with the 5 minutes version if there's more then 6 minutes on every other buff on that class. 
---
Wouldn't call it useless at all, but if maybe agree with overrated for how some people hammer on about it.
---
I refuse to play any class without mouse over macros, it's one of the reasons ff14 couldn't grab me lol.
---
It is also quite possible that it will have the same interaction with Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon, giving shamans with both 8/8 and the trinket a great supply of mana.
---
Is it an rp server
---
Shhh keep our server a secret.
---
I've done 250+ jump runs with my warrior buddy.  Literally only ever seen pagle books. 3 furors from bosses tho.
---
Ring Menu
---
Best I can think of is to use itemrack
---
Your first character is the hardest.  All others are much easier funneling them bags, gold, and BOEs.
---
Second this. I played in a spriest / lock duo for a while and it's really fun once you can put shadow weaving on mobs. You will absolutely wreck in pvp too.
---
14/40 guess im a casual
---
&gt; You got absolutely nothing
---
Big true.
---
Time to reroll alliance I’m afraid. I’m really enjoying my orc warrior and played a human warrior to R14 back in the day and enjoyed instant queues, but it’s tough to start all over again.
---
Then why are you still replying?
---
You should have put "kinda has an idea about everything but isn't really good at any of it" to druid.
---
Oh the classic " Hey I was being a douchebag and pissed someone off, so now I need confirmation" post....
---
Pick class that fits you, not someone's else, its a trap.
---
You could always switch to alliance.  There’s your fix.
---
Herbs you farm aren’t free.  You can only make profit on the difference you would sell the raw materials for over the potions/elixirs/flasks.
---
Honestly as long a story they give me time to get out of combat I don’t care that much.
---
You give Josh's a bad name
---
Is go affliction on lock and shadow on priest. Priest gets shadow weaving which increases shadow damage and lock gets increased shadow damage talents so they work well together.
---
I'd use the succ pet since the pets arent the best at holding aggro anyway and succ does the most damage and with drain tanking and a pocket healer you should be fine.
---
Fun combo have fun.
---
What’s your server and name?
---
&gt;if I actually care about wasting energy to convince you otherwise.
---
So if you're still here, you obviously care about wasting your energy.
---
Saving to check out later, thanks OP. Hoping I can use it for Sinister Strike and Backstab. I use daggers in group but swords solo. And I keep forgetting to swap my current SS and BS macros. This could be a right click instead of opening macro window and dragging.
---
About 600-700 on my server. And there are about 5 or more listed at a time.
---
Nah I just hate it when people doubt me but then provide absolutely no counter argument other than. “No u”
---
I use em if they can save a someone or even a wipe. This allows us to progress further through the dungeon. Also saves repair costs and less time ghost running.
---
Usually i only use a 1 or 2 on bosses. But my last dungeon i used 7 or 8, that was a shitshow.
---
As a healer, you can also get the first heal off and drink.  Stay far enough back that you don't get out in combat by proximity, drop a big heal and start mashing the drink button.  You'll start drinking, then go in combat. By the time you need to heal again, the first one was free!
---
&gt;man I sure do hate it when I make a bullshit claim and people say, "prove it," and I have no proof
---
Yeah man, I would too. I totally get it.
---
I'm a healer and do not need any items anymore so I'm absolutely not okay with the tank taking all he money when the only reason for me to be there is also money
---
This is why as a resto Druid, I don’t follow the bis gear guides that want me to exclusively stack +healing... I’ve got a fair amount of +healing but have been enchanting and gearing more and more for spirit and mp5. 
---
I never run out of mana, and if I do, much of it regenerates between pulls. Tanks absolutely love it.
---
So you admit you’re just trolling then? Okay move along.
---
only guild on the server with two. were getting it.
---
Anyone got a link to the last thread OP posted?
---
Oh I get it now. You’re a pathetic loser
---

---
It takes so much effort to make shaman tanking work after 55, effort by the whole group/raid, that's it's not even worth it. It can be done even in raids to a small extent, but why make everyone relearn fights just to do that one silly thing that multiple classes do better anyway.
---
Loot the bodies of the opposing faction when they are killed (first come first serve on who get to loot it).  There are a variety of items that you can turn in, some in singles, some in stacks of 5 or 20. You turn them in back at your base. Just look for all the NPCs giving out quests (blue question marks are the repeatable turn ins). Some of the badges can only be turned in later after some NPCs are rescued at the enemy base and given time to run back.
---
No, don't play a class if you only want to play 1/3 of it
---
They can cleave instead if they feel theyre pulling threat and need to rage dump.
---
I had the same issue in Stormwind and was stuck at 75/75 with no way to level up.  I went straight to 75 and didn't try to train up at 50/75.  I flew to Ironforge and was able to train up to 75/150.
---
Hunter and druid have tons of synergy and can handle a lot together.
---
He's tanking, if he's doing well he can demand any loot he wants from the dungeon dude.
---
Enhance dps or tank wants HoJ just as much as a rogue. 
---
You're being selfish here imo.
---
i’m not sure i agree with your assessment that they are all useless. It’s pretty reasonable to post a wowhead guide which states info, even if the info turns out to be wrong.
---
and since you say the info was wrong, what is the actual answer?
---
LOL
---
Yeah I conflated the two but far more rep from balinda etc. Zergs don’t pay
---
&gt; 10 people can slow 40 down enough for 30 to win
---
Exactly.  Every one they kill has to run all the way back while the horde are right there.  Easy to bleed the zerg dry.
---
Not for me, lol. Yesterday I kept healing the hunter pet thinking it was the druid tank. Tank died and I felt really stupid. Then I realized our tank was a warrior and we didn't even have a druid in the group. Then I felt even more stupid, but atleast I laughed my ass off.
---
The one were you are picking gear ? 
---
Not the drops - which is Atlas loot
---
I mean the one that allows him to select for different slots without opening the inventory.
---
Here we go with the "possible in vanilla" argument again. Just stop man.
---
If you are doing it right and if they dont want to lose, they will turtle.
---
"like everyone else"
---
Not everyone is tryharding so hard that they only bring 1 druid to raid. Every single guild I've been in over the past ~5 years has had at least 2 druids in the raid. Even the one time I actually was in a tryhard guild (like, requiring DM buffs for every raid), we still had 3 druids, 2 restos and a feral.
---
Only the most tryhard of tryhard guilds are going to class-stack to the point of only having 1 druid.
---
Are you my Jewish?
---
Except if it gets to that point we would rather just afk out or burn towers until the game ends. A turtle benefits nobody.
---
I'd only recommend in a premade group though, haha. Can get really confusing at times.
---
My brother's cat raids while railing, that's also kinda nice.
---
Can you send it to me too
---
Bless bloodvine. I need it so badly.
---
Right off the bat its pretty expensive due to lack of bloodvine available. It starts getting cheaper pretty fast though, but it will be quite expensive if you want to be one of the first to get it.
---
I’m not claiming to know or have experienced this in vanilla. This was a response from a GM. They believe it was possible in vanilla. I could care less what was possible. I don’t think these skip ques should be a thing, but I also think people should not be punished for this.
---
Is he dead now or what?
---
If they're putting out bullshit where did you get the list of realms they're considering 🤔🤔🤔
---
if its a premade, losing with 1800 honor+ 20minute queue is worse than burning down IWB SHB and maybe kill duffy and possibly a win. Most premade are stubborn and they will keep trying to rush drek and cap SHGY back. SO you can get another 2000ish honor at least within 15min or even win sometimes.
---
god yes.  idk who keeps putting so much stock in +heals for preraid bis.   youre bonus 400 healing doesnt mean shit when you are oom and have no mana regen.
---
Yea, do you want longer queues or shorter ones.
---
I see a lot of people selling Stocks runs 2G per run. Get a full group that’s an easy 8G in 20ish min.
---
I haven’t played wow with the sound on for years. Just something to consider if you’re assuming everyone will hear it
---
I gained nearly 1500 rep yesterday in a two hour match where alliance had summoned druids, all 3 aerial masters, and the rams. Not sure what the upper limit is because I didn’t keep track of how many rep was due to kills, but was seriously fun despite the eventual loss
---
Shaman is the best. I second the choice.
---
SHGY is always free for the taking, you just cap it after bal and go back to D as usual. Any one that dies get sent back to SPGY. They just scatter all over the map at that point.
---
I try to feel out my healer the first few pulls. If they seem like they're doing fine I'll pull faster. My issue is with mages getting mad at me pulling when they have no mana
---
If it makes you feel any better the eye isn’t rare. :)
---
Guild banks aren’t really a QoL change though. They’re actually kinda essential to the smooth functioning of a guild.
---
It's correct, Stone Guard for Horde
---
Ungoro silithids would like a word
---
Eye of sulfuras isn’t a rare drop. In fact many other items off Rag have a lower drop rate. Bindings are somewhat rare.
---
Over the top reaction for sure, but you’re still a cunt for snowballing teammates off the bridge.
---
They’re just absurdly convenient and don’t have to deal with so much of the QoL and time hassles other classes do, especially while leveling. I can’t imagine having gone through phase 2 without being a rogue
---
For group PvP they are pretty great. Solo not so much.
---
I dont remember seeing this mobs name in the barrens.
---
In any dungeon (besides DM:W) they are totally fine at tanking. It’s not hard, but I’ve found with my Druid I get 90% of what I got out of my Paladin *and* I’m effective as a raid tank.
---
I did spec into Improved Thorns when I got the T1 set bonus just because 40 thorns damage was too good to pass up while I’m farming dungeons with my guild. Add in all my items and a Ret Paladin if I can swing one and the 100 thorns damage is 100% afk tanking time.
---
More cringe
---
Nevermind what? As far as I know, there are no items in the shop that provide anything more than a different look.
---
Lol 1,000 trials.. law of large numbers only requires 20 trials for a sample population to represent the real population.
---

---
lol, first world problems. what about us warriors?
---
longer queues personally, but it wont affect queue time much tbh.
---
&gt; shadow priest does not do respectable dps in raid
---
[Wrong](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/JKMA43kZdQgp8cB1#view=rankings&amp;boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2)
---
&gt; I don’t know why the raid dps as shadow is appealing to you
---
Because it’s the most engaging ranged spec in vanilla? You actively use multiple spells and have two different rotations (max dps vs. max dpm [damage per mana]) that you dynamically flow between based on the situation.
---
I mean, while a pretty shitty move, nothing stops the loser from just not paying. So effectively, you're gambling with zero stakes. No reason why that shouldn't be allowed, it's functionally equivalent to just /roll with someone and feel good about yourself whenever your number is higher than the other's.
---
Well, we just found the amalgamation of toxicity right there
---
Your right about that one.
---
As a healaer i can confirm this, also, having a tank makes me confirm this
---
People specifically farming them or buying them from guild or trade chat
---
I am guessing since they got on a level 1 that they were on the opposite faction. All is fair unless you're same faction.
---
The Maiden's Circle is a good alternative to freezing band, however it is rare to come by. Last I checked, freezing bands were like 800g on my server, which I think is a ripoff for a mere 8 spell power increase.
---
Keep an eye out for: Ring of Spell power, Maiden's Circle, Frigid Ring, Ring of Entropy, and Ony Head
---
I now regret rolling a warrior. Just hit 32... perhaps I should start over.
---
Earthfury is really balanced. I would say slightly more Ally at the moment.
---
Yes. I don't think you can get some reagents till ZG. It'll be like devilsaur probably.
---
I think I know what this is but enlighten me anyways
---
Cause the question “how do I make money?”  is asked everyday multiple times and all people can come up with is “DM RuNs BrO!”
---
It’s 600+ on my server so I’m assuming there are less people min maxing gold making in DM and making money other ways.
---
Or copper hanger, fucking whatever works.
---
No one cares about pulling more mobs in raid, the amount of mobs you pull is pretty set anyway..
---
And we’re not doing shit on Christmas
---
Unfortunately maiden's circle is about 400-500g on average, lol
---
Yeah snowballing someone really deserve them wishing you get cancer
---
No one knows for sure.
---
I feel you man. I feel like since I’m SM/ruined spec for raiding and not SL specced, that most classes can wreck me especially as an alliance lock
---
Druid druid, feral hunter, lock druid, spriest lock, war Pala,
---
Almost, you'll be using it deep into naxx
---
Grobb is dead don’t roll there
---
Is max dpm just spamming mind flay while keeping shadow word pain on? Not trolling just curious
---
Well, the subscription revenue exceeds those costs. They might want us to believe its for server maintence alone. But they are seeing high revenue gains with high numbers subscribers.
---
Blizzard did grow to the size they are to day not only because of their merger with Activision but the peak 15 million subscribers was a huge finacial factor.
---
Which probably payed for every single project they worked on at the time.
---
Trust me I think druids are badass it’s not my fault they are subpar in classic
---
I appreciate it! I can't wait for that set!
---
A paladin can easily duo both with a friend, tanking+healing is easy to do at the same time. Personally I'm just going to pay a friend to solo farm them for me on my pally since there's good methods for that and I'm respecing Ret soon
---
I’ve definitely responded with insults like this in response to terribly toxic teammates in other games, but to act like this from a snowball off the bridge is just ridiculous.
---
Seems like it would be more of a best in raid over a best in slot. But I could see the benefits of running more than 1-2 shamans with 8/8. 
---
But if you’re just trying to min/max ere’body you’d probably skip out on most pieces of earthfury.
---
at first I thought that was a hunter
---
How do you know you’re versing premades
---
If they're your friends you tip them/cut them in on profits so you aren't competing, of course.
---
I was wondering about how much excess there would be from the subscription; however I'm curious if wow subs pay the server maint fees for WoW, Overwatch and the other games. WoW servers are resource intensive so it would make sense to prioritize them and have the sub there to keep other games free to play. But then I remembered that for their servers they need Sysadmin teams to actually do the maintenance on those servers.. There's many possibilities
---
Find a mage buddy who will take you on some farms when you both have downtime in return for always making sure to offer then a spot in any group you tank.
---
I like taking one on my lasher farm and hitting the death lashers and satyrs. Keeps you under reset lockout and it’s not that big of a gold hit if you can work in all the satyrs. It’s a little less optimal, but it’s a big help to any warrior.
---
Nice. So to clarify- stay your pet within their (king+Cho) aggro range. They pull together. This technique addresses the problem with the 5 set aggro bug?
---
Look up pre-raid best in slot online. Icy Veins has a nice resource. Many of those pieces are BoE and easily purchased.
---
You'll need copious amounts of inhuman time though
---
not sure if this is a dig or something else, but there are just over 10 HoR on incendius (A) and our guild is the first to have two.
---
See, I agree with you, but I’m starting to learn that even if I’m at 0% mana, as long as I can start drinking before I get pulled into combat, I can probably heal just fine. 
---
Just chug as much water as I can, hope for a Crit with Inner Focus, and most of the time I won’t have to drink a mana potion. 
---
A couple of times on pulls with a lot of mobs, I’ve actually pulled aggro just from drinking (resource gain causes small threat).
---
I wish I could be this happy.
---
I probably should have mentioned I am in 5/8 t1 and full preraid bis fully enchanted.
---
But thank you!
---
For example, I rolled on briarwood reed as a resto shaman, because we want to have it to swap in for short fights when we don't care about mana regen and want the spell power. For the mages that I beat out for it, too bad.
---
Something like a hunter rolling on hoj, though, is a different story. Hunters rolling on dal rends is fine, though. They like the two set for the attack power.
---
Priests can farm lashers with holy nova. I’m constantly making them mage water as we run across each other resetting DM:E.
---
Depends, Horde or Alliance? I play on Herod Horde, and we definitely outnumber the Alliance. It's a nice realm, but we do get queues sometimes!
---
Unfortunately he’s already a mage.
---
WHAT. Tell me this isn’t true!!!
---
Also to consider T1 is good to wear for Fire resist and great Stam and int stats, especially in PvP. Still very much good pieces in a variety of situations. Plus if your guild isn’t that good then the bonus int and hp is actually really nice. 
---
Different benefits!
---
No need to worry you are by no means in the wrong. If the other warrior really wanted that trinket he/she should have made it known in the beginning by calling res on it.
---
I made like 5g 1-300 tailoring, but I had all the materials except for like 80 wool.
---
Its the best trinket for tanking, when threat is relevant, which is more often than not. 
---
So if they had asked you to not roll, that would be unreasonable. But given they did not, they are stupid for thinking you might not roll.
---
i want to be exicited for 8.3....but i got so much shit that i WANT to do in classic
---
I agree if you’re new, but the classes that are “me” are hunter and rogue. I’m just looking for something new and fun to do as a duo.
---
Lmao
---
What happened??
---
jeSuS tHE jEw
---
I'm sitting here behind 3 other trash hunters with more dkp than me and we have not seen a single set of t1 legs or boots drop since launch.
---
Nah.
---
Lol!!!! you as a tank won hoj on your 3rd brd run. Lots of dps classes have ran that shit 50+ times with out seeing it drop.
---
 There are plenty of better trinks for you w.o stealing someones BiS. 
---
What do you think??
---
Why farm with a group that won’t help you a tiny bit with repair costs when you can just go get one that will? That’s not pissy, it’s just reality.
---
Dude asked for a single green. That is almost nothing to me as a mage.
---
Yep, can confirm, have had people link items in Spanish and French but when I click it, the tooltip shows up as the normal English one.
---
So adding one would make the quality of running a guild, better, correct? Its a QoL change no matter how you spin in, but it would be a welcomed change IMO
---
Mostly aiming towards gear in for DPS tho. As I think it’s the meta for tanks as well 😐
---
I understand your first example, but hunters shouldn’t be rolling on dal rends over melee, they can get peacemaker in UD strat which will give them more stats, and is a lot easier to farm.
---
&gt;	Right-clicking your macro
---
NTY
---
It's a way to ensure that you have a higher chance to get items on later runs if you got no items this run. Rewards attendance over people who skip nights or are on their first raid with the guild.
---
Ohh gosh now im scared of running ubrs. Thought it was just rogues and warriors. 🥵
---
Yeah for sure, sorry if my initial comment came off as arrogant, wasn’t my intention at all. The big thing IMO is to use a wolf, furious howl sort of acts like a AOE taunt during the run. Like when you body pull a pack, you can use furious howl to have them go on your pet. This helps a lot especially when you pull the right pack during the large C4 door. It can also get you out of tricky situations, like if you feigned in a weird spot you can summon your wolf out of feign and furious howl so any mobs near you go on your pet and you have time to reset feign CD. Here’s a VOD of my current best run, this run happens once an hour when I have gnomish cloaking device up, but usually feign before the bugs and use my pet to skip them. 
---

Imagine being in AV matches that go past 10min
---
\&gt;once enough people have preordered Shadowlands before launch. 
---
ftfy
---
Yeah exactly, it’s super annoying that we gotta do it like this but at least it’s not a shared agro table.
---
You're telling other people how much they're allowed to play.
---
Miss me with that shit.
---
It you have the gy capped, sometimes suicide charges work better then waiting on Mana regen
---
You should check back later. They’re not instant.
---
I knew that mages and dps warriors would be OP but I didn't know how annoying they'd be
---
For 8 more spell power? Nah, that would be a huge mistake. Take your chances with that one ring dropping in MC. Maybe even ask if you can buy it (doubtful).
---
Yes, and responding like this is the mature thing to do...... slash ess
---
I've yet to see a hunter with either Brut blade or CHT, which one did you get?
---
My guild has 2, but we run 3 raids per week. Our MT has both bindings as well. 
---
&lt;Yang Gang&gt;
---
I mean it’s greifing you’re teammates
---
Im not saying it should or shouldnt, Im saying that online gambling is illegal in the US, and could cause some legal trouble so Im surprised its allowed. Apparently if you do not dig into your own mind to fully articulate a passing though, reddit downvotes you and assumes and projects what ever the fuck they want onto you. God I hate humans
---
Op was an asshole by being a dick to his teammate
---
| Not that anyone needs to do that in current content
---
My shadow priest brethren would like a word.
---
Yang Gang has had 2 for a while
---
It has EVERYTHING to do with fast ponies. 100% mount for majority of players in a 40man BG means they can stick together and coordinate a death ball to steamroll objectives &amp; defenders. Running all the way from spawn point to field of strife creates a sizable gap between 60% mount speed and 100% mount speed. That gap IS the difference between making it across the field of strife or not. Getting split up before you even reach horde objectives will make breaking the horde turtle exponentially more difficult.
---
It’s supposed to be a mutual agreement between all rankers. Why would you WANT to no life AV for 100+ hours a week for 4 months? That’s fucking crazy. And if that IS what you want to do, you tell the bracket group your plans so that they can modify the brackets to suit those plans.
---
The system doesn’t work when one dipshit with no job and no life sits in AV 24/7 living off a check unless the brackets are built to let that person rank first.
---
You can’t make this shit up!
---
The murdered souls of those gnomes will forever haunt you in your sleep
---
Unless there's a good chance you will die before I finish drinking, go ahead and pull. 
---
If I'm doing my job right as a healer, you're never waiting for me unless something went badly or I needed to rebuff.  If I need to drink, I'll drink while you start the next pull.  If you can't survive until I'm done drinking, either I have underleveled water or you are undergeared. 
---
As a tank, I try to make sure there is enough of a break to start drinking before I pull, but sitting around for a while waiting for you to be full on mana so that you can sit around for a while watching me pull dudes and generate some threat and take enough damage for you to have something to heal is just wasting everyone's time.  Those two things can happen at the same time.
---
This^^ my tank friend plays with frames off and bases his pulls off if the healer is drinking or not. 
---
I’ll often be in dungeons where we will sit for 30 seconds before a pull, no one drinking, healer at 20% mana. He pulls, healer starts drinking. Like...?
---
Just FYI, this has already been posted several times.
---
people bring nice combos but technically the best for leveling is double hunter
---
i mean, you being an asshole so expect the rage no?
---
don't be an asshole then don't get these.
---
You are literally reinforcing the reason for the brackets. One person breaking brackets makes the time for EVERYONE take longer, not just that one person. A “cabal” can not control the brackets when you can literally solo que AV on a premade server and make Rank 1. Anyone can do it. The whole point is for the brackets to be a mutual agreement between all rankers to save EVERYONE time, and if someone comes in later he SHOULD wait his turn. That guy is the asshole if he decides to shit on the brackets that people have worked weeks or months to establish.
---
SS doesn't reset swing timer, that's a common myth. Extra attacks do, however, and SS can proc them.
---
This is literally me.
---
Just farming Tribute on non raid nights. Have bank alt with way too many mana/health pots. No clue the point of gold anymore since there is nothing I can buy to improve.
---
Im considering just buying a bunch of krol blades for guildies lol
---
The murdered souls of those gnomes will forever haunt you in your sleep. You shall have no peace as ghostly laughs are heard about you in the quiet of night and faint, childlike faces peer out from the shadows.
---
TBF they probably did you a favor getting you to stop playing as much.
---
Yep! Bear has frenzied regeneration and power shifting so it works.
---
&gt;there is only so many times you can hear the same tracks and sound effects without going crazy. 
---
My friend always asks me how I can bear listening to only in game sound and music when I play, considering I've been playing for 13 years. I dunno, I just never get tired of WoW noises for some reason. I find it so sad when I learn that someone plays with the game on mute 24/7
---
3def don't even consider it when comparing sets
---
(This is a thread about horde, there is no such thing as premade AV servers.)
---
Who says that guy is late? Maybe he's been grinding just as many hours as the clique but they want to lock him out because they don't like him or there aren't enough slots in bracket 1.
---
Breaking the bracket doesn't make it take less time for the guy left out, that's nonsense. It means he doesn't have to spend extra **weeks** grinding after the popular kids are done. That's hundreds of hours in-game saved on top of gear coming earlier by the calendar.
---
Totally wrong. 3% crit for caster is shit in 100% max, because the only caster in the raid is a single warlock.
---
Highest speedruns run meeles only. 0 Mages, 1 Lock for armor debuff and 1 druid for ff.
---
Did that shit on me while I was at a hotel on my hot spot! Fuckers downloaded 20 gigs on the company MiFi before I put it out of its misery. Might be hard to explain, but I'll get out of it by saying it was just midget porn or something at 2 am.
---
you shouldn't 2h ***at all*** if alliance.
---
It is mostly your reps problem, they could kill all those archers in the tower.
---
10 Defense = .4% parry/dodge/block. So its worth more if you can parry dodge AND block. Not really worth stacking if you can’t do at least two of these.
---
Inconsistent latency could be qos on your side not setup right.
---
Griefing is cancerous.
---
Tribute runs are a little bit different in classic WoW vs in original WoW or private servers. Absolutely doable!!  
---
Its tricky but once you get the hang of it great money. And one of the biggest challenges classic WoW has to offer to hunter players.   
---
This video shows the essentials of Tribute runs for Hunters in Classic WoW.

Jan 2nd is busy season boys. I'll see y'all niqabs April 17th after my April 15 hangover is gone.

- Multiverse episode
---
Correct?
---
100%!
---
The p2 slaughter happened because the Alliance is, generally, out numbered. 
---
Not our fault if most people don’t want to be/ play with a bunch of fairies and midgets.
---
If I'm at half mana when I pop a squat to drink then the tank better be fucking pulling the next pack.
---
I’m leveling up my tailoring with mooncloth lol. Just another 28 dayside so to go 😁
---
Yea I was in the am same situation as OP. Made a warrior alt and excess gold is definitely not a problem anymore.
---
And then they die.
---
After the first time most learn to listen, if they don’t they’ll rage and leave with a big repair bill and you replace them. As a Druid I really don’t care because I can just find a new tank or a new healer and I’ll do the other thing.
---
I don’t need full mana, base it off what you’re going to pull.... but if you want to pull 15 mobs when I’m at 8% I will sit there drinking until I have enough that we have a shot of not dying. Till then... good luck.
---
You mad lol
---
Warriors don't leave capital cities without at least a preist to bubble them and a rogue to suck them off. They never have to worry about solo PvP any more.
---
Looks like the average Gehennas player to me.
---
Give it to me, sincerely, Nah &lt;Trash Control&gt;
---
Every name in that conversation is awesome.
---
progress used a moonkin and 4 mages.
---
Hunter was also my first character, and I used to main hunter for a long time in retail as well. I rolled a Warlock and I've been having a lot of fun with it, I'm not 60 yet however. It's similar to hunter in some ways with the pet and ranged dps.
---
Was gonna suggest this
---
I mean one spec has imp 2h and imp slam, and the other has dualwield spec and none of the 2h talents, so you kinda force yourself to use whatever you're talented for.
---
Update: first 10 lvls very fun
---
Can be of any playable race, too.

Mage/mage or mage/priest, warrior/shaman

lmao yeah fooling around in a video game warrants being told you deserve to get cancer and die—totally reasonable reaction from a mentally stable person
---
Being devil's advocate here but still wouldn't call someone who could orchestrate a takedown on an AAA corporation a script kiddie. Yes, DDOS is not a sophisticated process, but this right here is not an ACK flood from school PC. In other case people wouldn't be pissed
---
The instance of mental illness in wow players is likely to be higher than in the general population.  Add to that the relative anonymity and you get a larger-than-real-life chance of someone you interact with in game being a bit of a cunt.
---
You're playing it wrong. My mage does higher damage and still doesn't cause any issues to the group.
---
Frostbolt spamming is a raid thing. In dungeons it's lazy. And while lazy is good enough to finish all current content, you really shouldn't tell others that it's correct strategy.
---
Eh. Smoking Heart of the Mountain is definitely an option, but its overselling it to call it BiS forever.
---
You just flat out aren’t out threat generating a Feral Druid with MCP. The way threat scaling works on Maul and inherent 12% crit means you’ll go miles further with it.
---
Without MCP you fall somewhere between Prot Warriors and Fury Prot Warriors in both threat and survivability.
---
Look up a shatter aoe grinding spec, on mobile so I cant send a example right now. Basically you put your points into shatter and clearcasting, group mobs, nova, flamestrike + cone at same time then kite while spamming arcane for cc procs.
---
I fight plenty of herbing warriors rolling solo
---
It's handy to coordinate buffs, one pally can set assignments and they're synced out to everybody in the party.
---
don't laugh at the drood
---
There's some miniscule reduction to dodge (and parry but that will be irrelevant for 99% of raid encounters) in there as well, which applies to your yellow hits as well. But yeah, it's between 2.5% and 3%.
---
You're griefing the English language.
---
nope, no confirmation either way. though probably makes sense to save them just in case
---
They are not the best healers no, but they bring totems and chain heal Wich is really nice, in tbc tho they become the best healers imo
---
They are good. They provide buffs with totems and bonuses to armor from their heals.
---
Chain heal is also very good.
---
Lol sorry with the in laws so in kind of a shit mood
---
It isnt though. It is BIS for all of vanilla with mark of tyranny
---
They have mana problems but they have the best raid healing ability in the game with chain heal. In the end all healers are good and needed in a raid. Shamans are sought after for their totems and usually therell be 5 shamans in a raid. 
---
Be prepared to spam r1 chain heal in your raids cuz thats your life.
---
yeah I think sappers get shelved until AQ Gates
---
Nice post but there’s no healers in AV so that change with charge won’t make any difference
---
No really, please quit.
---
Winter Squid, Plaguebloom, Mountain Silversage, large brilliant shards for Mana oil
---
I don't have the discipline to save 1,000 gold.
---
I find it so sad that any interruption at any time is the end of the world (of Warcraft). Fucking junkies. You’ll have plenty of time to no life this game. Just settle down and watch a movie or something. If youre so deep that you rage and cry and plead to be back online any time wow is offline you should seek professional help.

Same, been full clearing since week 1 and 2x full clearing since week 4....

Start trying to research which mats will be needed in later content and invest your gold.
---
Found the afker
---
Tank +healer combo is always best for duo leveling since you can set up dungeon runs no problem. If you're ally then pally healer and for horde shaman. Both offer the best utility for your duo buddy out of all the healers.
---
All specs are viable. Not optimal, but viable.
---
Guild channel? As guild chat? What are you smoking, that's been in since release
---
this depends on if the alliance have capped SF gy or not
---
You have a bad memory bruh
---
Then your best option is probably Frostbite from AV and Mirahs Song (Scholo Quest)
---
When people say classic and they mean vanilla
---
What addon do you guys use to monitor threat and debuffs?
---
If you had a few people dedicated to this they can rid the group of this leech fast enough to then get back to defense at IBT area in no time
---
We actually have 3. Validoz, Macaroni, and Snori. 
---
Yang2020
---
I'm gonna stop you right there... ANY warrior with a half assed tank set can carry groups through scarlet monastety armory/cath. The going rate is 3g per run on my server,  multiply that by 4 for each group member (maybe 2g for a healing class if you're feeling generous) and then multiply that by 4 or 5 (depending on your clear speed) nets you ~50-60g an hour. That's not including vendor trash which you should be taking (items being worth up to 2.25g each).
---
You're already at twice the gold-making capability that priests can reach with lasher farming. And priests aren't even the worst off when it comes to farming.
---
But sure, fronting a couple more gold in repairs than the rest of the party all while having the shortest queuing time potential... you really have it tough.
---
Just for visibility, we have 3
---
Damn I didn't know Snori had one too.
---
First off are you using Python 2? A lot of the funcs under the Random namespace were changed in 3+. Remeber these things are pseudo random. Random used to have issues producing sampling distributions which didnt not exactly follow a nice even distribution you would expect from a truly random system. 
---
That's whatever. The real solution to this isnt math and simulations, it's just adding a heuristic. The opening roll can only be a positive integer greater than 1. Not 0. So if the first roll is 1x restart. If the second roll is 1, restart. And to keep shit from not breaking, start at 100 or 1000 or 10000 at least.
---
No, the guild recruitment chat. Thought can’t remember that from vanilla,
---
And brooo i got some good shit to smoke now over Xmas:D happy days
---
What server/ battle grp?
---
He never said it was warranted, he just said it's what you should expect
---
Have some personal integrity.
---
I get being knocked off by a teammate is annoying as fuck but damn dude.
---
I usually just go get snow and fuck them up with it lol.
---
In tbc shamans are good but aren’t the best in ten man content. They do pump 25 man content once they are sufficiently geared however
---
Yes, I am getting confused every time I hear this.
---
Thank god that useless AFK cave goblin was booted out by a much more useful player sitting in the cave
---
Kurinaxx-US
---
Yep, and it's good practice for raids too. The most annoying and time consuming part of raiding is clearing trash. It's kinda cool seeing all the casters in my raid drink walk together. We've been emphasizing it since week 2 of raids so everyone is used to it by now, but the first week we called people out for wasting time for mana we had a lot of people swearing cause they kept missing regen ticks lol
---
Both.
---
For threat and damage meters, you need to use the same add-on as everyone else in your guild. Because I think they're only limited to 50yrd range. So on fights like Ony, your numbers won't be correct unless you sync the meters together.
---
Blaming a victim always does the job
---
Honestly just put herbalism and mining on a 60 use a cast sequence macro and rack in great profits with any class spec combo
---
SOO run. Our raid leader lost his shit after this newcomer tank /kneel the only female character in the group, who happened to be the RL's girlfriend. 
---
I'll never forget the super awkward silence in teamspeak as the guy went like "why the hell are you emoting her for, do you even know her?"
---
Needless to say I left the core and guild a few weeks after that episode, just couldn't stand that creepy dude.
---
Warrior or paladin if you're on a PvE server.
---
BWL hit 5 weeks after bg’s, so... yeah. People should be expecting it late January/early February.
---
Only slightly, only slightly.
---
I have little doubt that he doesn't do that himself considering the excuses he is making for the player in this topic.
---
If anyone gets *that* angry over a game, they need to get professional help otherwise it very well may lead to an early death due to blood pressure or worse.
---
There's a risk associated with the ease coming from this.
---
Oh shit.... So that's why I saw you guys RP walking today xD Nice man.
---
This seems like placebo.  This was true on private servers, but 1.13 has spell queuing even on melee abilities.  It will always cast as soon as your gcd ends no matter what if you press it early.
---
Tank ZF until 48.
---
Going to guess you are high or something because what you said makes no sense.
---
So would this work for feral druid swipe and hoj?
---
No you aren’t, but what the fuck is your spec and how do you hold aggro or compete for dps with it?
---
Incendius 10/10
---
This is happening to heaps of people.
---
It's an OSRS meme, same with the blanking out so much shit in the screenshot
---
You absolutely can. Even with half the gear being leather it's not an issue (the only hard hitters in dungeons exist in ubrs and only after downing the Beast.
---
Druid/Rogue
---
Both can stealth to bypass whatever you want. Rogue has enough damage to kill anything especially with a healer and, when needed, evasion tanking. 
---
It's actually a match made in heaven.
---
Haha you left your lockpick hotkey visible, kiss your account goodbye, kid
---
They will imo its free money. Tbc is what those who wanted vanilla actually wanted. Proper pvp skill shown in arenas. Buffs to “meme” pve specs to allow parity for raiding. A heroic mode of each dungeon and rare gem drops incentivising constant runs. What an expac
---
ITT: Prank and fun haters
---
Do you guys do BGs? Theres an endless amount of potions and goodies to mess with there.
---
Anyone seriously going for Thunderfury most likely already has the mats
---
Yeah that's the rogue pvp spec lmao
---
Ah thank you, and Merry Christmas!
---
You can proceed to calling names ;)
---
Just an FYI because everyone is saying priest + warrior. It's actually shit because the anti synergy with shield and rage.   
---
Paladin warrior is better and overall priest is hell to level and any other class is just there to carry the priest.    
---
You can heal while they kill stuff but it's better to have 2 people killing stuff and heal in-between pulls. Priest damage is mostly dots so it's really bad for duo damage too because most mobs die with half the dot timer remaining.
---
Gouge into death ray is pretty fun too lol
---
There are no repair costs in battlegrounds.
---
Mark of the chosen, totally awesome trinket:)
---
the issue is that the ones that arent anywhere near private are pretty meh for you trying to get decent games, but I guess that's a given
---
Warrior. Farming boars in Elwynn Forrest.
---
Two hunters, two warlocks or 1 pally/shaman + warrior
---
I’m still shocked when I log onto retail how many people have the new collectors edition mount. Like what in the world did they see to be excited about enough to buy it?
---
Edy name = shitty attitude. Its true like 99% of the time.
---
This is giving me Chest Pain.
---
I don’t - my main character is a Prot Warrior and my alt is an Arms Warrior (lvl 45)
---
If I wanted to tank i’d play my main - its nothing personal :P but in return i’ll make sure I do the best DPS in group as my character has been funneled BiS leveling weapons and gear.
---
I just really don’t enjoy dungeon tanking with randoms, 8/10 times there is someone who doesn’t understand why I can’t hold a pack of 5 on me when they AoE from the start - it gets boring asking / explaining so I just make it not my problem.
---
These guys wanna act like they've never said some shit they didn't mean or regretted.
---
No he doesn't.
---
It's garbage for threat, bhb or hoj
---
Amusingly, horde do. Alliance can't because they land in horde npcs, but horde can use it to get in past alliance when alliance is pushing through the main gate.
---
It sucks dick, but the only way I see to handle it is to stay quiet so you at least don't give 'em any satisfaction if really bothered you.
---
I feel the exact same way. Guild groups are always EZ and Pugs are just awful to deal with.
---
What’s fucked up is he didn’t used to. I used to solo in vanilla. You can kite/path him using those Raises ramps on the side
---
I've whispered someone this for jacking my black lotus once
---
Yeah because if you get 2x they become unbelievably broken in PvP 
---
Also frost/elemental is still used into Naxx gear, fire isn't really 'better'  necessarily
---
Bear Druids aren't mean! They take a long time to kill but they never kill me so...
---
Oh right, duh.
---
I mean sure... if you want to farm that hard just to get threat over a something a fury prot warrior can do in blues..
---
I have eskanders at the moment,  same same  if only I could get weapon skill for it.
---
pretty sure youre a raging asshole protecting another raging asshole lol
---
Damn.

This guy Warriors.

im still lost. can’t find it

That gave me ptsd
---
Guild recruitment channel was in the game back in vanilla. There is a feature to disable automatically joining the guild recruitment channel in the 1.12 client.
---
Kinda agree with the guy you throw the snowball at.
---
Honestly, if you're in it for the long haul and want to clear alot of content just start stocking up on consumables for AQ/Naxx. It's very easy to underestimate how much actually goes into progression nights.
---
Stuff like elemental earth will probably skyrocket with AQ so starting to stock up on it early will probably save you alot of time farming gold then.
---
Eh fuck off. You can be a cunt in real life and you can be a cunt in a video game. 
---
When your pal farts in your mouth as a prank, you react the same as this guy is. My least favorite attitude is “it’s just a game” bro. The other players are people. Being an ass, even in jest, will get you the same reaction in real life. 
---
We all aren’t glued to bongs making us happy go lucky 24/7.
---
Pretty much every single class needs at least 2, pvp and pve sets 
---
Warriors need like 8
---
What is a "BG weekend"?
---
Bs. slam abuse still works as alliance so if u cant get vis or death or bblade but u can get bre, slam abuse, its still more damage than all the other classes. Ofc hs abuse with dual wield fury still reigns supreme.
---
Are you honestly this dumb, or?
---
Do you genuinely believe this would result in any repair cost - or that a 10% hit would be even close to 10 gold?
---
Ps there is no durability loss for falling off a bridge in a BG
---
&gt; i mean, you being an asshole so expect the rage no?
---
No. And if you think that’s an appropriate reaction that OP deserves then you need to rethink life.

A public guild bank with transaction logs wasn't available by Patch 1.12 in Vanilla. Of course, Classic has already received a bunch of changes but to implement a guild bank would be adding a full fledged new feature to the game, which fundamentally changes the implication of how Classic will evolve. Until Blizzard confirms they are willing to add new content beyond phase 6, they probably won't add guild banks to the game.
---
OwO
---
...and then there are hunters. nobody is sure why anyone is a hunter.
---
squirrel!
---
Is the start/stopattack necessary? As a warrior, a lot of the time I will have something like 25 rage, which would let me use MS once I get enough rage from next auto swing. Once my swing timer completes and I "attack", I can instantly MS and the yellow MS numbers are flying before the white auto numbers that actually generated the rage. Is that in any way related to spell batching? I should probably check the combat log next time to see which damage comes out first.
---
Yeah they changed in like last week? Two weeks ago? Remember seeing somewhere it wasn’t in the patch notes or something though.

Either way just take up mining and do DME jumps it’s better money

You really don't need to focus on stacking crit right now as a paladin, in fact prioritizing it over +healing is detrimental. 
---
As a paladin you have super duper efficient heals, and you benefit raid a buff in the raid no other healers do - blessing of light. This means you can downrank your flash of light super aggressively and still push out good sized heals - rank 1 flash of light can put out 500+ heals for a measly 35 Mana in preraid bis. That makes it great for topping people off. You are going to casting rank 4 flash of light most of the time otherwise, and should have no mana problems outside of really long fights like ony with less than 20 people. You rarely need to use your consumables as well.
---
You also get a substantial amount of crit from talents - 5% spell crit is MASSIVE. That plus divine favor means you can throw out big heals for free when you please.
---
Don't get me wrong, spell crit is godly. There's a reason mageblade is so good for paladins right now. But you shouldn't be prioritizing it over large amounts of +healing. As a paladin, you should have more +healing than any other caster, and you should be leveraging it as much as you can.
---
Wrath is the next logical step, because that was when WoW reached its peak in subscriptions.
---
Cata and onward is more questionable, that's when subs went down, and even some of the expacs that are looked at fondly in retrospect like Mists and Legion never reached sustained subscription growth like the pre-cata expacks.

It sorta depends. If you’re asking for general PVM, from an average player, IMO easiest to hardest is:
---
Mage
---
Hunter
---
Warlock
---
Priest
---
Rogue
---
Paladin
---
Shaman
---
Warrior
---
Reasoning is that mage until AQ40 is literally frost bolt spam with some long cool downs. Hunter and warlock are pet classes where you cast some instant spells and then essentially turn your brain off and just refresh things as they fall off. Hunters are easier because their debuffs are less necessary. Then comes priest. Rogue/Paladin/shaman are all their own thing, however each is incredibly easy to play at a basic level. The toolkit available for shaman and Paladin is more expansive so I’d say they’re more difficult than rogue but shaman and Paladin dps is some real braindead shit. Shaman is more difficult due to having to rub both of your two brain cells together to figure out which totems to place and when. Paladin is literally downranked flash of light spam or auto attack with seal refresh. Warrior is second hardest due to stance dancing and the fury playstyle in pvm. Still not particularly hard, but more buttons to press and brain cells to use while playing.  Druid is the hardest because you have to lie to yourself every day that you’re helpful. Kidding sorta, but druids do have an incredibly expansive toolkit and there’s a lot of various valuable situations to use the tools available.
---
I think if you’re talking about at the highest possible level (or the lowest) the list could flex, but on average I’d think this is how I’d rank it

If healer has mana, tank should be pulling. Fuck sitting there waiting for your casters to top off every pull.
---
If you mouse over the clock and wait for it to reach the next minute you see that bug.
---
*cries in 34,000 gold*
---
Which is fine, you use the buff to gain the threat you need then lose it. Druids don’t struggle for threat for particularly long.
---
While that may hold some truth, classic wow is essentially an old game without any such remakes that WC3 reforged has. They can basically drop P3 whenever they feel like it / when the QQ increases and subs start dropping.
---
With this formula:  
---
 100% - Miss% - dodge% - (parry%) - (block%) - glancing + crit suppresion   
---
Irrelevant or not, it's still there. Other thing, we surpass the crit cap due HS queueing.
---
Trading that much armour for unneeded threat generation isn’t the best call when druids have significantly better options, so it’s really not.
---
Do you have epic mount? And do you plan on raiding/pvp until naxx? If so, then yes.
---
35 alchemy alts
---
Exactly. One goes herb, the other goes mine, they rake in the dough.
---
So does it give you an extra normal attack when you use it with swipe ? Does it give you extra rage ? And does it have one chance to proc per application of swipe damage (so 3 chances per swipe) ? Sounds pretty op if so.
---
The honor for Bracket 14 is different on any server and vastly lower than 2mil for a lot of the horde side.
---
lol people are literally reported AFK for not zerging AV
---
You are completely right, in the same way it's possible for you to level to 60 in 5 days then down rag on day 7 with your guild, it's just impractical and no one besides a select few can do it. In the other av there were significantly more mobs and they were stronger, not broken strong, it just prevented rushing for most teams. It forced people to play the game based on the mechanics, not to cheese it.
---
You can get much more out of a lock instead of just using a voidwalker. I leveled mine with succubus and drain life build. It’s a lot faster, I was always pulling 2-3 mobs at the same time.
---
What’s the cap? Is it daily?
---
They are good, and they are fun. A good priest (Benediction, True faith tailoring chest and high activity%) should out-heal you, but you can bring some great competition. You have a flexible toolkit with totems, you have your basic slow'n efficient(ish) single target heal, your quick single target heal and the iconic CH, which you will likely use more than any other heal unless you go for 8/8 T1. In dungeons/PvP you have a kick-ass interrupt on a 6s CD as well as Grounding totem on 15 sec, your Tremor counters fear, you can kite with EB totem/frost shocks, got a heap of resistance totems...
---
The list goes on. Priests should win in pure numbers, but you are highly competitive and sought-after. With 3/8 T2 you may start outhealing priests for a while in BWL, at least until they get even more gear from there.
---
Hear hear!
---
Use the cheap lower level mana potions, easy lifehack. I don't even use max level agility elixirs on my rogue because the DPS difference the 2% crit makes is negligible and they cost 5-10x as much as the lower level agility elixirs.
---
Aaand que times are getting worse ofc
---
I got my julio band and im never gonna do av again.
---
Ally ftw
---
Yikes 600g
---
1) Threat: either use ClassicThreatMeter or TinyThreat (a plugin that comes with Details!). These 2 are the most common and can communicate with one another. 
---
2) Debuffs: to show the time of debuffs left on the target, use both ClassicAuraDurations and OmniCC. To track your debuffs on one or more enemies that you haven't currently targeted, I can recommend NugRunning. These 3 work together nicely.
---
slam abuse, do you even read? you get rage + slam off on the same hit. making it able 2 sustain rage.
---
Like this guy said don’t get discouraged too fast. I’m more hard headed than most and no matter how many videos I watched I couldn’t really learn the specifics of the run without making the mistakes myself over and over and learning from that. You’ll eventually get a route that you’re comfortable with.

---
That would be my PvP stuff otherwise (I dont have the wrist, just Necrophile).
---
I weigh my stats as following:
---
1 stamina = 1 spell dmg = 2 intellect = 4 spirit
---
Go with warrior + shaman. I believe fury has a bit more of a reactive playstyle (just from what I hear) and shammy is quite fun, and you likely will be using a mix of r1-3 CH, max LHW and 2-3 different HW ranks + totems in raids.
---
wow so skilled
---
If you only want to pve, pick a high demand low pop class, druid would be the best but pala, shaman work too. From the DD i guess Hunter and Warlock.
---
If you want to pvp stuff gets iffy, i would say shaman ist the easiest to gear if you want to run it ele, you have a easy raid spot and t2 will do the trick.
---
After that, mostlike Hunter&gt;warlock &gt;rogue &gt; mage while there is alot of competion they can atleast pvp in pve sets and you dont need to fight for it, if you are ally warlock should be easier then Hunter.
---
After that comes Warri, while its not so hard to gear its needs alot of effort to shine.
---
Pala comes after that you will have to fight for your pvp stuff atleast if you want a 2h , if you only want to heal move it up to shaman.
---
And the worst class to gear for pvp are the true hybrits, ench shaman , shadowpriest, druid, not only exist nearly no gear for them they have to fight for every pice more often then not, and for shadowpriest/Druid you can even argue they need rank 13 to be able to keep up later on cause both need the high stamina to deal with the damage of later pve sets.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But the key to gearing is classic is consistency if you slack you have trouble gearing any class, if you are there you will get gear on every class.
---
pretty sure that all those equip effects work, as long as they're not from a weapon. So a glove-based chance on hit would work
---
reserve that first spot for having a cringe complication
---
If you have a 60hz monitor why would you want a frame rate higher than 60? Legit asking, thought 60hz meant 60fps max.
---
How many people can you stun lock at the same time?
---
I started doing dm n runs with another hunter friend to just learn the pathing and get some tips on fucked up situations. Im now running them solo with ease.
---
you want to see your leader in the back staying alive...a dead leader causes your morale to go to shit.
---
Just made a similar post: after trying for 3 hours it seems that it works this way.
---
1. You can send 20 pieces of mail to different people before being locked-out.
---
2. You can post one piece of mail every 5 minutes, after being locked-out.
---
3. After 1 hour, from first mail, you can send another 10 before being locked-out again.
---
As I only needed to send out 40 pieces of mail, this was all the testing I did.
---
threat pieces are always nice, and even if they weren't, you're the tank, you get to roll on anything mildly on or offspec.
---
Yes that's what I'm doing how did you know!?
---
And ony head is typically reserved for tanks and physical dps
---
_four_ full T1 shamans? Wow, I'm jealous lol
---
Blizzard loves releasing raids 5-7 months apart and have been doing so since the release of WoW. We will probably get the same time frames in Classic WoW. We shouldn't be seeing Naxx until 2021.
---
 Realistically all Blizzard has released is Dire Maul, Honor System, couple world bosses, and AV/WSG, all of these things the Lead Game Designer(Ion Hazzikostas) said were going to be released ASAP in a interview months before Classic launch.
---
i did pala/warr before and i dont think we ever lost a fair fight in pvp 1-60
---
Every guild on my server is lacking resto shamans. So you're in demand, if you choose the totemic ways.
---
Mind sharing? Never seen a macro modifier like that.
---
Just be regular Arms at that point.
---
With this route the game would be killed off because there's no where else to go. Vanilla
---
&gt; because that was when WoW reached its peak in subscriptions.
---
Vanilla and TBC lifted WoW to that peak, not Wrath.
---
I've been looking for a setup like this for ages, do you have a quick guide?
---
Dead ai, dead game past levelling. Yea ill admit the gameplay and storyline whilst reaching cap was awesome, but not suited to  mmo. I couldnt stand it, had like max rank pvp gear and all the fixings, just found raiding aids and lacking that verve. Raided during wotlk, loved ICC. Most fun ive ever had, running ICC in a guild of RL friends as the raid/class leaders.
---
Meh the only thing I regret is letting their threats keep me from playing. 
---
If I had reported their threats to Blizzard nothing would have happened except maybe an account suspension. Because I've had dealings with this kind of stuff since and it's actually pretty hard to get someone arrested for a threat over a video game.
---
What you actually need to do is print out screenshots of the threats then take them to your local PD with contact information of the company (in this case Blizzard). Then the PD needs to contact Blizzard and request information from the users who made the threat. Then Blizzard needs to give them that information and the PD contacts the authorities wherever the user lives and they take the case from there. 
---
When I tried to do this a few years ago literally nothing happened. I had screenshots printed out of someone making clear threats, gave them to my PD and for months they basically told me they were too busy to deal with petty online crap. After 6 months of trying to get something to happen I gave up and they got away with it.
---
Blizz is rushing to finish up before Shadowlands so yeah January
---
ew alliance
---
Had no idea people played during that time.
---
Merry Christmas
---
Yup, it stinks because it is the holiday and all.  My ticket stayed at 16 hours for like 6 hours.  It is moving now, but just sucks all around for the person on their end having to look at it during Christmas, etc.
---
Why would you be sorry? If anything they did him a favor. A depressed 15 year old playing wow for 18 hours a day is not healthy at all.
---
&gt; when I look at history of wow BWL hit vanilla 8 months after. Are things going too fast ? 
---
Shouldn't expect dates to be exactly how they were in Vanilla. I'm sure Blizzard will stick with their normal routine of releasing raids 5-7 months apart.
---
They abused layers, the boss dungeon reset glitch and now this... true classic exp...
---
I second this as a druid.
---
He can also get more threat in def stance, some defensive talents snd shorter cd taunt + 5% aditional crit from fury tree. Looks pretty ok for dungeon tanking, prolly better aggrowise than arms + shorter cd taunt is slways useful
---
(20+20+20+20+40=120)/5=24
---
They will be gaining CP as if they were lvl 24 :-)
---
Wrong. Ranged dps is not reflected. And only single target spell is reflected for casters with the white bubble. Also, if you have a healer shortage, you absolutely stop dpsing. Even if you don’t, if everyone is in prebis the bosses go down way slower so the healers don’t have time to waste their shit on your tbh.
---
Wrong again, in prebis the fight is longer so the fire debuff stacks. No one stop dpsing anymore since the boss goes down 1min~ Feels like you didn’t prog MC tbh and just joined some guild that had it on farm already. 
---
Yes yes you get babysat with your own personal fear ward, that’s amazing, must be nice to have a healer suck your cock every raid. Also once again DURING PROG, there was no trinket?
---
I though we were talking about MC in prebis on week 2-3, do you still do it in prebis now? Lmao
---
That is just.... extremely wrong. I’m feral and i always tank onyxia p3. With MCP and full rage bar I pull her from the raid in seconds and the dps can go crazy very early. No way you can do that with a warrior in blues.
---
because angerforge is before emp?
---
WotF, 2x IB and CS is pretty hard to combat as most horde mages are undead :/ SL is ridiculous in duels, but lack damage and often fall short of you have the wrong pet out. Not too much of a fan in BGs atm.
---
Demonshear, arcanite reaper, Blackrock slicer, or dreadforge retaliator are all solid choices. You want something super slow with a lot of top end damage.
---
Actually you weren't correcting anyone. The question was simply "RWT?". RWT stands for "Real World Trading." You contributed nothing meaningful to this thread.
---
I think it has less to do with "all people can come up with" and (at least in my case) more to do with viable ways to make gold during P2 with the over-zealous wPvP. Herb/mining solo was a death sentence at anything but the oddest times of day/night back then, so an instanced way of making gold was very nice - it was nice before P2, and it's just stuck around even more since then.
---
If you want to heal but also have some fun in BGs I would respecc to 25/26/0 holy reck. Reckoning has been hotfixed to where it's working fine. Good luck!
---
Ret is just crap in classic. Prot can be pretty fun tho. Although healin is the only raiding viable spec. You dont need many talents to tank. I'd just recommend imp righteous fury.
---
Imp slam is fury. And deep inside. It's 2h fury PvE spec atm.
---
Arms is King for Warrior PvP atm, case closed, fury litteraly has no arguments over it.
---
Yeah, but you'll find dungeon groups while leveling easier if you're willing to heal now and then.  And if your raid hits a wall and needs another healer you're willing to heal. 
---
As a lock I welcome my shadow brethren though
---
Looks pretty great!
---
Merry Chrysler
---
Yes please! Would love it.
---
Yea I’m new to tanking and had trouble holding aggro on big pulls in full prot.  Lvld all the way as arms so SS helps a lot. Didn’t put the extra 10 points into 2-hand (arms) since I only use it for that one initial smack.
---
You wanted #nochanges and you got it (except of real minor things).
---
"WTB port to TB"
---
Shamans are very sought after as healers, BUT they are also not great healers. The biggest issue with Resto Shaman in Vanilla is that they have no instant heals (except for a cooldown) or HoTs. This means that in situations that requires a lot of moving around you will find yourself struggling to keep up, and in PvP you are incredibly susceptible to being locked down or silenced.
---
Having that said, everyone loves totems. You will find groups (and raids) looking for shamans specifically for totems all the time. And when it comes to raiding the utility of Chain Heal is just absolutely fantastic.
---
you will ALWAYS need 6% hit cause weapon skill-hit relation is not linear. so your "technically" is incorrect. unless you wanna get 315 weapon skill. which would mean being a human with edgemasters + maladath. which would be dumb.
---
lol because I dont have unlimited time or money for leisure, while the rich do. If I had money to not work and send my time drinking and being on the beach obviously I would. hilarious you say that then call anyone else dumb LOL
---
I'm a gnome, too :\^)
---
People still play classic?
---
Buy blue sinew if you don't have it. The altérac arrow bag (dunno the word) gives same speed boost but with less slot. Those extra 200 arrow goes a long way and ull keep it till endgame
---
That one‘s not so far off. At least on Mograine I know a handful (myself) included that had naxx on farm multiple times.
---
Those are the kind of ppl that are lore likely to be running a guild.
---
show us your slam logs :)
---
It was a comment on 0% hit through talents and 2% obtainable through gear.
---
They still crit for 3k+
---
He says something like "Taste the flame!", call to go back in once you see the chat bubble go off.
---
It's the Kungen meme spec. Ok'ayish in 5 mans, garbage everywhere else.

---
? He said hoj is good for threat
---
I think BWL will be out easily by mid February. Onyxia's Lair/Molten Core just isn't enough content for people. I expect Zul'Gurb and Arathi basin to follow soon after. But then expect a long delay until phase 5 and a long delay until phase 6. 
---
Zul'gurub was in patch 1.7 which came out 10.5 months after release.
---
Even when BWL hits people will still be running Molten Core for bindings and the good but rare drops. People will run ZG to get rep and mats for head, leg and shoulder enchants and for the mounts. Onyxia will drop off the radar for some guilds or be run sparingly. PUGs will still run Onyxia.
---
Considering that in the first year after released WoW went from release version, patch 1.1, to patch 1.8 compared to  WoW's 2nd year where it went from 1.9 - 1.12. Its obvious that the first year released the most content. 
---
Naxx was the last patch to have major content in 1.11 which came out in mid June 2006. That means all major Classic content was released within 19 months of release. Patch 1.12 didn't have much content and was mainly about cross realm battlegrounds which we have from the beginning of battlegrounds this time round. Unless you consider the "world PvP" objectives on Eastern Plaguelands and Silithis "content".
---
? since when do you need to be rich to do the things I've said? lol. i think you are the one with a problem tbh.
---
So you are saying that HoJ drops of Anger forge and Will from Emp then? This does not make sense.
---
Yes, python 2.7. Because the pseudo-random distribution is equal among all trials, pseudo-random does just fine for the simulation. Regardless, I don't see how the game would change at all based upon that heuristic. If we restarted whenever player 1 or 2 rolled a 1 on their first roll, it would just shift the advantage the first subsequent roller after whoever rolled the 1 that restarted the game. The heuristic you are proposing says that you cannot lose on your first roll however the player who ends up rolling first (after the game has restarted) will still on average roll one more time than the other player, giving them the disadvantage.
---
Does the burst not over agro?
---
Reroll ally.
---
You only need to buy the latest. Try it for yourself, this is a particularly bad place to ask if it's 'worth it' because many of the people here burnt themselves out on retail because they have no self control (so now it's "trash") or they have *years* old grudges against Blizzard for removing some ability or some perceived slight. 
---
Retail's not perfect but you're not going to get a fair assessment here. 
---
That said I feel like right now is not a good time to come in. The leveling revamp that will come with the Shadowlands pre-patch will make for a much better experience. 
---
However, you *do* get a free character boost when you buy BFA, so you could jump into BFA content right away, if that's what you want to do.
---
You have joined the queue for Alterac Valley.
---
Confused about something ... if you're macro is /cast wingclip (or whatever) and then /stopattack... how does this make ur regular hits work at the same time? wouldn't you consistently be stopping your attack from ever going off?
---
my guild has every warrior pop reck/dw and have all of them ready to move north at any second anyway lol. means phase 3 ends super fast since all the dps can do full damage right away instead of having to hold back as usual. Usually a couple dead warriors but worth.
---
Doesn’t matter really at this point since p4 is just around the corner. I’d say just enjoy the game and get whatever professions you like.
---
I could not disagree more.
---
Many a mage started insulting me and calling me a dick for asking for an orb to tank strat live.
---
-	i don‘t need anything
---
-	i go to strat JUST for the orb. I have better means to farm money
---
-	only defensive pieces are missing are 2xt1
---
-	i have the big offensive epics that compliment the defensive items
---
How the fuck is the fucking mage entitled to orbs? How the fuck is it OK for him to click need? *He does not need it*. It‘s pure greed.
---
I am not going to tank 5 strats for 2 orbs just to feed your fucking misguided entitlement.
---
And don‘t even start with „just communicate by...“, nonono ain‘t nobody got time to argue with you armchair crusaders infesting lfgs across servers.
---
I will need 1-2 orbs per strat. *And you won‘t*. Because I am the only person that actually fuckinh needs it and is not just being a greedy money whore.
---
Drop herb when u have the mats for tailor, get 300, make robe, drop tailor for whatever you want. If you want herb again you can level it in a few hours to 300.
---
&gt; Like what in the world did they see to be excited about enough to buy it?
---
They saw another WoW expansion. Naysayers aside, even the bad expansions are worth the asking price if you put 100-200 hours into them or something. 
---
Like I know for the internet things can only be "the best!" and "the worst!" but the gap in quality between the good and bad ones is not that wide. I can safely buy a WoW expansion and know I'll get somewhere in the same range of quality as previous ones. 
---
I don't care about mounts though so I wouldn't buy CE.
---
&gt;	Your response is probably why he left. Not the fact you said no.
---
God. I had to scroll far down to meet the first person that gets it. OP is telling his side of the story and is fishing for sympathy.
---
It's the best chest in the game right now so if you're serious about performing in raids you should probably get it. There's robe of volitile power from MC which is the extremely close to it but as warlock's tailoring robes are so much worse than mage's, good guilds will give it to warlocks first. So there could be a very long wait.

this is the gayest thing i've seen in a while
---
Depends on each server I guess but priests &amp; paladins are always high in demand on mine. They're not too hard to gear either.
---
It really depends if you're sitting in bracket 9 or 10, your placement in those brackets, and how competitive your server is.
---
It takes 12 weeks to get from 3 &gt; 10 if you're hitting 75th percentile of bracket 10 every week. If you're hitting 75th percentile of bracket 9 you'll hit rank 9 after 11 weeks, and never hit rank 10.
---
&gt; In how much time though?
---
Impossible to say without knowing your server.
---
just like incendius minus the streamers
---
Nobody gets much hit from gear. It's just that mages get a free 6% from talents.

Nice read, thanks =)
---
Except the tank instantly overreacting. Why are we splitting hairs?
---
I’ve been enjoying WSG; space out your cooldowns, use them to impact the game not just whenever something’s up.
---
And having prep up really increases playmaking potential if you do need to just dump everything.
---
I levelled warrior paladin combo as duobox. It is highly effective but hard to make it very useful while leveling as duoboxer. However with 2 people it would be great.
---
Nice, what were you farming?
---
Personally I wouldn't mind having Guild banks. But I'm against it because I fear what could follow in its wake.
---
Thanks I'll look that up.
---
Your P2 bis has 0 hit unless you value hit at 23 spell power.
---
Reroll then :S
---
Gratz dudes!

---
I agree. Out of combat res is the only thing that I really would like in addition to the combat res.  
---
Yes it sucks that windfury does not have any effect in bear and cat but then again bear and cat are immune to disarm effects and you can use very weird weapons just for their on use or on equip effects without really reducing your auto attack damage.
---
Hey can you help me? I though about trying slam spec as alliance with av mace. My problem is I hardly got enough rage for bloodthrist and whirlwind for cleave. Should I only use slam on solo bossfights? Also it is a bit hard to keep track of when doing slam so I just pressed whirlwind instead always.
---
Dude are you actually trying to convince yourself that the subs are only keeping the lights on? ActiBlizz is no saint and certainly not some sentimental charity lol, there is no fking doubt WoW makes money way past server costs, for it and everything else you listed many times over. There is no other possibility, no.
---
Wholesome, have an upvote
---
You'd generally set up the talents for specific niches (hence, why it comes down to what you had in mind, playstyle wise).
---
I go with the +7 dmg scope because the 3% extra hit is pointless in PvP, 5mans, gold farming and raid trash mobs. Even without surefooted I have 8% hit so i would only gain 1% hit. The fights are over so fast that I often do not miss a single shot due to good rng.
---
If you are worried about tranq shot missing you can buy a warmonger which comes with 3% hit and use it for tranq shot fights.
---
Want some gold? Want some levels? Want some horse pony skins? Next they’ll start selling raid spots in top tier sponsored guilds. Good grief.
---
...they really dont it's not remotely worth.
---
If someone was to do that, ideally it would be in collaboration with sub mods so CSS could be adjusted to make tooltips not look like shit.
---
The blue set is a tad more hp but the bonuses are trash. The only thing I'd consider going for is the blue shoulders, and that's only if I get to keep the 5pc T1 bonus for that extra energy.
---
Is that worth it? Rank 10 is quite a grind in itself.
---
If you absolutely have nothing to do I'd go for it but bear in mind, you need to put the hours in for that r9-r10 push.
---
&gt; I don't have much respect for a system
---
Well...you don't have to. The system is trash and everyone knows that...that's why Blizzard replaced it in retail. But that's just the glory of playing classic the way it was back then.
---
But how will the spergs get rank 14 if they play on Christmas?! /s

Ikr, because it's a holy paly item...
---
No thanks - I've been healing as a holy pally since vanilla.
---
It's you making the assumptions about my abilities here. I have zero issue healing, yes including illumination, fully holy spec, and downranking, along with +healing, in any dungeon except when I have an arsehole warlock who is too lazy to drink and likes to tap to 10% hp left.
---
Warrior.  Never wrong to roll on best item.  Really don't have to read past first sentence.  
---
Warriors without you are like, 7/8 warrior at best
---
NTA
---
how do you climb the tree
---
first to hit 1 loses. Player 1 begins the deathroll with /roll x. Second player does /roll y, y being what player 1 rolled. This goes down till 1.
---
So p1; /roll 100, gets 78
---
p2; /roll 78, gets 2
---
p1; /roll 2, gets 1
---
p1 loses
---
I think this is Yojamba i’ve sen that same set of names in Trade lol
---
What do they debuff with?
---
Ok buddy.
---
Mathematical proof why it is not 50/50. N =2. 
---
First player rolls a 1 50% of the time. On the third roll with probability 1/2*1/2*1/2.   
---
Since this probability will not decrease he has a greater than 50% chance of losing. 
---
The graph posted shows quite well how the probability gets closer to 50/50 once n increases. 
---
So opening a casino as second player with n between 10 and 20 is a thing you could do, with the odds in your favor.
---
This is awesome!! I've already made plans to replace our spreadsheets with this... thank you!
---
Neat!
---
yeah but if horde turtles usually the fastest way is to afk
---
It had this low quality charm to it that I enjoyed. All of the lightning effects from wc3 to early wow are special. (drain life, drain mana, drain soul, chain lightning, etc)
---
Dont think you will have the mana to efficiently kill the elites off at that level. The caster patrols are also an issue.
---
You got your question answered but I just liked to give my two cents:
---
If you play a game (1v1 or team vs team) where the winning chances may not be identical (some turn based games or asymmetrical map for example), playing always an even number of rounds with switching roles/sides will always result in an even 50/50 probability of winning!   
---
If you need to decide a winner by who won the most rounds, this has potential to cause an infinite loop, therefore in those kind of games you play sets of rounds and who wins the most sets wins, while still making sure that any asymmetrical aspects of the games cancel out.
---
But at the same time, a lock lifetaping to do more DPS means the fight will end quicker, requiring less healing for the tank. 
---
I lifetap anytime and everytime because my job isn't to save my health, my job is to do DPS, for which I need mana. At the same time I don't really expect to be healed when I lifetap. I have bandages and besides, I don't need to keep high health since it's my responsibility to not draw aggro.
---
I was wondering how I run into these guys so much
---
Faction imbalance killed Flamelash which we have proof of, we have yet to see a single retail server die to the actions of a guild.
---
It is far more likely that the server died to mostly the server balance rather than this specific guild.
---
I would say you are NTA.  You tried to resolve an obvious conflict amicably and he refused to even discuss terms.
---
Sure you can, SB still hits like a truck on its own. Felhunter is also often the pet of choice in WSG or group fights.
---
Classic Bushoshoku
---
No, you will need 9% to cap soft hit with abilities though glancing penalty will be a pain. 
---
With +5 weaponskill, your chance to hit is reduced, the chance to be dodged is lowered. And the most important part, glancing penalty is reduced highly.
---
With 8+ weaponskill, your hit needed is 5.x where X is a number which depend your skill. To be safe, you choose 6% hit.
---
The statement of "You always need 6% hit is wrong". You will need 9% or 6%. And with 40% crit you will need more hit to cap crit. Though is not necessary because you will use Heroic Strike and Hamstring as Horde to proc WF. They are abilities so 6% hit is their cap with 305+ weaponskill.

I see alot of negativity. However fury prot has too be something everyone agrees on. My guild asked me to go fury / prot beqause the healers and dps are ready for it. With that if you wanna go fury prot you have a few things too learn. Equip a shield before you know a burst of damage will come and since there will be no tactical mastery learn too build your rage and dont just dump it when you are on trash runs. Also you are responsible wether you run dungeons or raids too have the elixer of superior defense on you at all times! On raids mongoose is mandatory. Else it would be the same as having a big HP engine in your car but shitty tires. I can go on for a while here. Shortly, dont push this only when the guild is ready. The shield should always be ready and your consumes are even more important now. Sorry for my broken english.

His point isn't that 6/8 t1 is easy or hard to get, it's that t1 is generally bad for warrior tanks so a warrior tank wearing 6/8 doesn't know his class.

As a gay dude...Ive seen gayer.

I think this is mainly the biggest issue. Everyone yells "rush galv and then drek". Horde starts defending and as soon as people die at galv, they just complain "another fail group, just let them win" and from that on they afk at mid. People don't even think that there could be different ways to play and win this bg.

Sucks for people who've had bad luck with loot in MC. I've seen people get decked out in epics and others who are still full blues purely based on rng.

If this is the gayest thing theyve seen they should go to Soho

Things aren’t going too fast. Game has gone stale.

That's not an investment though..
---
wrong direction. see minimap
---
HoJ is a different tactic entirely, you're thinking of /stopattack /startattack doubling. I can't comment cause I haven't used HoJ or HoJ-likes on any of my toons.
---
Moongose boot with agility enchant
---
Gotcha, yeah with dual-wielding its a bit of a different beast (as you can see in my tests in the OP), I'm still trying to figure out what's what but in theory your Vis'kag should proc more if you can manually time your Hemos to land at the same time as your main-hand autos.
---
yeah, you are about as casual as someone who is going for r13
---
The act of using Wing Clip (or any other instant melee ability on any other class) will force you to make an auto attack if your swing timer is up. /stopattack doesn't block that from happening, it's just easier to time things without having auto-attack on.
---
Pvp offers much less freedom than pve though. While retri and prot specs are good enough gor pve they're simply a huge detriment to your team in pvp.
---
How do you totem wall?
---
Suck it. https://imgur.com/a/ikdFo3b
---
I never use /startattack, but /stopattack isn't necessary. I just use it to get consistent results, but if you've got a quick keyboard then you can check your logs to see whether you're landing the MS within like 100 ms of your autos.
---
Is there a trick or exploit to just vanish in pvp?
---
I was farming in EPL and this warrior kept attacking and killing me. Then he got overconfident and attacked me when i was prepared and i got him down to execute range and he just vanished right in front of me while in combat. The only theory i have is that he got a BG invite but i find the timing too perfect tbh... and do those even work in combat?
---
This. The \#NoChanges-tards honestly believe that stuff like guild banks is what turned WoW into what it is now.
---
Yes, it gives you your auto white hit anyway.
---
We get minus 48hit and get feared into a gnome mage with an annoyingly happy name.
---
And that's your prerogative, just be aware that a paladin trying to dps as retri is a huge burden on their team. If your team is fine with carrying you then go ahead. I'd rather roll an alt for dps.
---
I haven't played 2019 Classic yet but I'm a veteran of the game and leveled too many times to 60 and is sick of questing. What's the fastest way to power level a mage?

As you said Force of Will is a tank trinket, you were right to need as tank.

HoJ is a great trinket for any warrior, tank or not. So you were also right to need on that. Need what you need and don't worry about it.

Bloodvine is not BoP and reguires a lot of rep to learn all 3 pieces. You could just make the guild tailor make it for you (Unless that is you of course)

This definitely was not in original vanilla. The dynamic que system was added much later. In original vanilla you had to leave que and reque if you wanted to add a new person to your premade.

Yes, if someone has nothing in their life that they would like to play WOW (specifically BG farming) for their entire day everyday they should stop playing (potentially forever lest they lose their entire life)

Or maybe they should play this MMO and join the existing communities in the game and maybe find some friends and balance in life

It’s impossible to compel someone to stack brackets, but the honor system works better for everyone if you stack

I've found imp conc aura to be very valuable. Silence completely fucks you, and having 15% extra resist is really nice. However, if you're reckoning in BGs you won't be healing that much, and imp hoj might serve you better. Up to you.
---
How is calling something gay homophobic? People are being overly sensitive
---
No, but our mage/warlock class leaders know how to play the game so it's warlock prio aside from a couple going to our top mages
---
Fastest way is to buy dungeon boosts, but since you haven't played yet you probably don't have the gold to fund that.
---
Fastest way solo would be aoe grinding, look up some guides on popular mage leveling locations and pray that it's not contested on your server.
---
Even better if it worked with some sort of link syntax so you could link quests and npcs based on their ID with a different link-text like „This [[quest|QUEST_ID]] is the worst ever.“
---
If min/maxers were just playing that way for fun, great. But when they start denying loot and raidspots to slightly worse specs, that's what causes unnecessary toxicity.
---
Lmao that comment

If you’re spamming more than every 30 seconds then a lot of people probably have you on ignore. You’re gimping your ability to find groups in the long run.

You cant steal something from yourself
---
hmm  we had the same thing happen a undead warlock tagged as alliance we could not attack him and even the npc's just ignored him
---
I'm pretty sure you can accept BG invite in combat (never tried since alliance queues are instant), it's got a pretty long timer so you don't need a perfect timing, just accept it when you're about to lose and you're gucci.
---
The cave?  Do I not understand your question?

Yes, hit is usually Worth 10-13 sp depending on other gear. The whole t1 set is just pvp gear

The scalding / boiling elementals in 1000 Needles had one as well.

---
As a rogue you have a ridiculous amount of disables and hit like a mac truck. You can get away from people easily, and are the bane of clothies. You get hemo, combat swords, combat daggers, subtlety, and seal fate playstyles with tons of variants.

Also no one in their right minds wants to farm a contested spot against a rogue.
---
93k honor and standing &lt;600? What kind of a dead realm is this?
---
Well to be fair he might’ve started a little late and so he didn’t get that boost from everyone doing quick AVs in the first few days of bgs coming out.  Still, really doesn’t take long, I’m like 8/10ths of the way to exalted (haven’t gotten to play cuz of the holidays) and I’ve probably done like 30 avs at most.
---
i counted 21 and 20
---
But how can you que as a group for AV? I am kinda confused, what's the deal with 10th member that OP is mentioning? Someone has to ELi5 this shit.
---
Its a full realm, its just mostly full of hordes.
---
Yes, but you want to have a full party of leeches if possible, in order to bring the average party level down (i.e. one 60 and 4 30's for SM). For the carry, mages and paladins are popular.
---
were talking about happy, not dick sucking.

Yes he does. Believe what you want but I've seen his records and other rogues have the exact same results using his method.

Don’t get discouraged dude. Took me 2 hours of constant eying to reach the boss. Once you get it right you can do it with ease. Also you don’t have to folllow pulls the you tubers do. I do my own pet pulls and it works fine. Averaging 16 mins a run now and my first run was this Sunday.
---
No you get healers that won't speak up and tell you to wait jackass( not you jackass,jackass in general). Like I said just cause you can life tap doesn't mean you should middle of a big pull and im already blowing mana to keep everyone up? not the time to life tap. while everyones drinking and stuff or between pulls that im just standing around fine.
---
Good one
---
Dont waste money on items yet, you replace your entire set 50-60
---
Yeah, I don't understand your question. This is fact. It's why you see so many anger/arena runs. It's specifically for this item.
---
Anger drops HoJ. You may not believe it after killing him 100 times but we got one on 101 lol.
---
Ideally it wouldn't differentiate and just bring back the first hit from wowhead's search function. Trying to learn some silly format doesn't make it very usable. If your query matches a quest it returns a quest, if you query an item it returns an item. And if you make a typo it should just return the shrugging gnome, that shouldn't make it too hard to develop IMO.
---
How do you make money?
---
that's easy though, you just copy the "hey do you wanna heal?" sentence and whisp everyone once, then you are done with it. but typing the same shit every 30 seconds in LFG chat requires you to actively switch to the game and do it, so an automated system that does it more beneficial than what you're suggesting
---
This is the wayest thing I’ve seen in a while
---
I’ve seen them ban over a dozen botters I’ve reported
---
Or a guy which multiboxes retail and buys the subscriptions...
---
you are not supposed to have conversations in LFG chat anyway, it's for people looking for other people in their groups. the conversations should be kept under /world not /LookingForGroup
---
How did you keep track of them? Didnt want to add everyone to my f-list
---
I've seen empty lines in the scoreboard a lot, and I always get a lua error when I try to hover it. Haven't seen any anomalies in the raid frames, but I'm alliance side and I think I've only seen empty lines in horde team somehow.
---
For sure, but if you have health issues/concerns it would be worth the change imo.
---
How do you tell if a character is a bot?
---
Yes you are correct, I misspoke about convo. I was meaning not being able to see LFG besides your spam. But since you insist on this line go right ahead. I know I am not on your server so it matters not.
---
If you're gonna force 50 other people to increase their playtime by 20-40 hours a week. Why would they want to play with you?

No changes

Lord Alexander's Battleaxe or ice barbed spear

Mages get more out of it than warlock... AP Literally scales TOEP up another 30% what are you talking about. Unless you have a Shadow Priest in your raid (which if you're claiming knowing how to play the game is questionable then) and are Power Infusing your warlocks on top of that, then it's by far mage Prio.
---
Sounds like you assign loot based on performance which is an entirely different thing but in general warlocks dont benefit from it any more than mages do.
---
Only warlock prio in mc should be ROVP and Mage prio on MIC
---
Don't worry, they were probably 15 too.

Giving the tank 20 seconds to gather threat should be plenty of time. Phase 2 just lasted a very long time that particular ony because I was one of the few ranged DPS.
---
Warrior fury dps spec is hard to gear in raid epics as your fighting against users of crit/hit/ap/agil/str which is loads of classes. Weapons are hard to come by most of the time.
---
Easiest is hunter as your gear will be pretty standard and scaling later on is low. But again druids get all the loot since only 2 or 3 in a raid.
---
Just do this quest, it gets you an axe! https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3129/weapons-of-spirit

Respec SP at 40. Get shadow form. Biggest power spike in Priest leveling, do not miss it. From there, do 1-2 levels in Feralas/Desolace then move to Tanaris. Do quest there, run Ulda and ZF as SP or as heal (you'll be OK) until 49. 
---
At 49, move to hinterlands and Sunken Temple where you can also heal as a SP. From there, do Un'goro from 50/51 to 52, where you will open BRD and a free half level from AV quests.
---
Then It's on you. Either you finish questing and providing average DPS in endgame dungeons to 60 as SP or you respec Holy and dungeon to 60. Depends on what you want at lv60. But don't miss lv40 shadow power spike.
---
Ur ret pally is trash then... prob using soc with a 3.4 sub wep I'm assuming and str and crit isntead spell power stacking lmao
---
Yes Priests are high in demand but typacally there will not be much more priests then paladins in the raid. There are a shit ton more priest players though. Making gearing out a paladin much easier.
---
What’s worse is when people say “yikes oof”
---
I think he's implying because Warlocks benefit from it far longer than a mage will. It's good for them forever, where as a mage replaces it rather fast (Fast being used lightly because let's face it RNG is RNG)
---
That said though, a mage actually benefits from TOEP more than a warlock even, with AP Scaling TOEP another 30%, and the fact mages just naturally have more % it means less resists while TOEP up it's actually just better overall for them.
---
-They dont target you at all.
---
-Hunters try to heal their pet while you zerg on it.
---
-They pull while you attack them.
---
-They always need 2-3 secs to loot and 2-3 secs to start skinning
---
-Paladin bots will try to attack you and follow you until they/you die
---
-They run back and forth the same 200meters and make 180° turn
---
The list is endless.
---
I always check before reporting.
---
Yeah this is just wrong. Between set piece bonus and procs off 8/8 it can refund anywhere from 2500-4000 mana in a decently long fight. Pairing that with mana tide and thats nearly a full mana bar. Im sorry but no amount of extra +healing you could possibly squeeze out of other pieces would make up for that as the max +healing possible right now does not end up being more than like +450 or something.
---
I remember telling people here on Reddit after P2 released that these were not worth the price being paid, and they will dramatically fall off.   In vanilla, these were rarely more than 50g on my server.  A quick check of the AH shows them now at 200-300g and they have been declining in price rapidly from 1200-2000g originally.  This is due to supply/demand, at first demand was solid, now the supply has begun getting caught up.
---
I also remember getting flamed for it here because Reddit is an echo chamber of people blind to reason.

It's fun watching this happen.   Just wait till BWL releases and the "ItS gOnNa Be EaSy" crowd finally meets Vael in classic context with their braindead "I followed a guide" class knowledge and play skill.  It's gonna wipe the floor with most of these guilds of braindead dps/tanks.
---
Merry Christmas by the way!
---
Haha, sorry about that. Browsing Reddit at 3 am often results in some bad responses from me
---
After phase 5 emp will drop HoJ
---
Woosh
---
If you plan on keep climbing, this is kinda good, because you will lose less points this week over being rank 7 if im not wrong.
---
So you have almost the same points to climb but you lose less.
---
What makes it worse in your opinion? Because I see a 4 DPS increase and similar stats :/
---
Lol you know you are not wrong, why make a post?
---
And the Xbow is bis long into MC/BWL.
---
I had this in Vanilla when mindcontrolling a player who had debuffs shortly before he died. He would die but permanently stay my pet. Be warned I got told by GMs to stop this.
---
Don't take spear, the xbow is bis long into mc/bwl.
---
Its affecting everybody on horde side that wants to play WSG. Stop thinking it only affects BR1-3 people.
---
Our guild have 10 warlock and 5 mages (a cross our 2 mc grps)
---
Why won't you just allow us to exist within our own ecosystem? Why do you need to feel entitled to a raidspot even though we clearly say that we're trying to be as fast and efficient as possible? Why can't you just let us play the way we want in our guilds, and find a guild that suits your wants and needs elsewhere? I don't see what's so unreasonable about that. It's not like we're saying you can't play memespecs, just don't expect to be part of the min-max team if you're playing a memespec... That's what raid 2 is for. A more casual environment where everyone can enjoy it at their pace.

find the main toon and kill it....the rest are now crippled

Easiest in pve = hunter // easiest in pvp = warlock // hardest in pve = druid // hardest in pvp = druid/warrior

They dont respawn.

And after the bg, they have to walljump and hack their way into av to find the corpse.
---
Wowhead says it ports you to Silithus.
---
It's literally one of the best trinkets for Feral druids, since it gives 25 str / agi / stam with near-100% uptime.
---
This guy is clearly daddy. 
---
Mommy's credit card does not pay out $240+ a month for their kid to 20-box WoW. 
---
You might be surprised by the number of people with this many accounts that have such money to spend because they have a job. Others have extra time to spend because they are unable to have a job that you are able to do -- i.e. disabled. They may even be paying for the accounts by selling WoW Tokens in retail.
---
I'm only speaking as some sort of veteran or person in the multiboxing community that has information on this though. What would I know.
---
his wife did you too ? Nicee
---
I think you meant this one!!!!!

---
No difference, except bottomless bag can be resold as you mentioned (until it is equipped).
---
Bottomless bag is priced according to the materials and 250g sounds about right. Ony bag for 800g is way overpriced - in my guild it goes for ~150 I think, can't know for sure since it's a silent bid and I never bothered to try for it.
---
What are Edgemasters Handgaurds going for on your servers? Just found a pair and not sure what range to list it.
---
10% increased physical damage taken for *30 min*. Then you have the swamp monsters in the north that both *disarms* you and puts a disease on you that slows atk speed by *54% and slows movement speed by 30% for 2 min*, the bloodpetals everywhere with *thorns* and *insane ticking poisons* and Pterrodaxes that regularly *fear* you. 
---
It's anti-melee by design, just like EPL.
---
Well with our guild the rep situation isn't as easy as it should be due to some people quitting
---
You want a literal spam bot? Don’t.
---
It's a very risky move though, you can force a very bad turtle with it.
---
Unbreakable is too obvious ;)
---
Naxxchatalarm is what you are looking for.
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/naxxchatalarm
---
The best way is to tag all of their targeted mobs right before they attack. If you do this more than once or twice and they don’t rage at you, it’s a guaranteed bot.
---
EPL is an awful, awful zone.
---
Lol because I was in the area this occurred and took screenshots of both... It's me? Sorry but I'm not paying for 8 subscriptions just to hopefully get karma. And look at the screen shots dude, my character is obviously not the multiboxer
---
Just google it, at work/school if you feel adventurous ;)

---
I'm not asking what it is, I'm questioning his comment. Like it's very innocent. I feel like everyone knows what a golden shower is. Every adult at least. So I was curious if he was referring to understanding something else in the comment, which I'm obviously not understanding.
---
1, that’s a really stupid assumption to make, that anyone would think you got a bunch of accounts just to get karma, that’s 1 of the dogshitest jumps I’ve ever seen anyone make. 
---
2, the screen shot could have been taken from another account, or is the whole idea of multiple accounts brake your brain?
---
We run 6 healers
---
Combuctor. Its a reskinned Bagnon.
---
you do it from the building near the AH, small jump from there
---
Why cannot you play pvp to get good at it without the grind for rank 14? Or did you born as progue? I mean like handling 1vs2 and hard matchups, not the ambush clothie with one hit things. That could be one goal too. Really never understood people who claim they don't have anything to do in game except raidlogging.
---
That’s what we do! All with a smile on our faces. But we take care of her literally every day of the year. We love her and that’s why we do it. Doesn’t mean it can’t get annoying from time to time.
---
Because only mommy &amp; daddy warbucks or their basement dwelling children can afford it.  /s
---
It’s almost too funny that people think adults with jobs could never possibly have the disposable income to pay that much for a hobby.
---
&gt;problems are not fixed instantly
---
&gt;THAT MEANS THE DEV DOESN'T CARE!!!!
---
I never understood this mindset.
---
But thats the whole point I was making 2 comments ago; it has a faster attack speed and lower top end damage, so you will attack for less, but much more often. So your rage generations smooths out, your auto attack damage goes up. If your attack is missed, you will not stand still for 7,6 seconds but for 5'6 seconds.
---
But if you think weapon damage is the only quality of a weapon, sure. It feels a bit like I'm debating a wall here, since you're not really coming up with arguments as to why your top-end damage is so important, it feels more like you are repeating other people's arguments instead of thinking for yourself.
---
@/u/VolcainPraux
---
Ooooo, I'm interested
---
Mind control?
---
SENT INTO BATTLE, CAME FROM THE SKY
---
Only if u need it to hit 9% yellow hit cap. Otherwise the xbow is better
---
Your past says “one spec has imp 2h and imp slam.” But that’s not true. You can’t spec into both those things at the same time. I’m sorry, I don’t see where that guy failed to read anything.
---
This isn't true at all, any ranged weapon with hit or crit is going to be vastly superior to the AV reward bow.
---
Can’t wait watch the video yet, but is it basically SPELL HIT SPELL HIT OH THANK THE NETHER ITS SPELL HIT
---
For a warrior that bow is much better, yes! So take the polearm!
---
Not the president of Brazil
---
Druid, druid is the only class that plays. Raid groups are only ever going to bring 1 or 2 so you get all your tier set pretty fast. The trick though is to be the second druid in a raid group because the first will be forced to play resto. If the raid leader is melee he will let the second druid raid feral, if he is a caster he may let the second play boomkin.
---
Post is not about that, so could literally everyone who is not standing 1.
---
Its not a golden ticket lol, if you're bad in pvp you're still going to lose. Do not buy over epic mount.
---
LOL imagine trying this hard to lionize playing a 15 year old mmo 20 hours a day 😂😂😂
---
Yes, you can lol. The 2H fury spec runs 4 points in imp slam and 3 in 2h weapon spec.
---
Yeah, I hate seeing "yikes" or "cringe" in response to something a person doesn't agree with. One of my least favorite things about Reddit.
---
I see so many bots everywhere and even more recently I see craploads of fish on the market e.g. 76 stacks of blackmouth 80 stacks of firefin being sold at once by the same guy every 3 days at ridiculously low prices... not sure what's going on
---
This is the gayest thing I've seen in a while.
---
It's BiS for every melee. Rolling on it is never wrong.
---
Elgro hit the nail on the head, but I'll give you the specifics.  For everyone except rogues and hunters 20 agi = 1% physical crit chance.  For rogues its 29 agi = 1% crit.  For hunters, though, it's 59 agi = 1% ranged crit, which is absolute bs, but it just means your damage doesn't scale with improved gear as well as other physical damage dealers.
---
Imagine saying yikes oof...
---
I'm 9000% sure he isn't scared of the tree starting to suck a dick, quit being such a sensitive PC baby.
---
In one of the biggest guilds on my server and in mulitple lfg channels and still no luck sadly
---
Who hurt you
---
The thing is DB already hits like a shitty 2h because it’s so slow and has epic 1h dps.  Tried using earth shaker for a bit but quickly went back to DW.
---
That sucks, but maybe it gets better after the holidays and weekends.
---
This also has been my experience, i just report them and then whisper the bot 8/10 the bot just logs off as soon as i whisper them
---
Mate, don't kid yourself. You aren't that smart. I'm telling you that you have redundant and superfluous info. It was a good comment, but it should be left at that. You can do what you want with it of course, including making a post. I can go use other words if you don't get it
---
As a DPS warrior pretty much all of the gear I want in MC is BIS when BWL is out and your raid should be 20-27% Warrior.
---
Can you shoot me a link as well?
---
So you're a mad dadgamer stuck at r4.
---
Got it. 
---
What are you doing on reddit? You should be making breakfast for the kids.
---
No ones saying your auto attack dps isn’t going up, you’re just failing to understand that tiny increase doesn’t not make it worth the loss in weapon damage.
---
If literally all you did was cast MS on CD the weapons would be about even. As soon as you start using things like HS/cleave, whirlwind, and sweeping strikes, WW wins very clearly.
---
It’s not rocket science.
---
Or you could, you know, learn to work the markets.
---
Check Roberto for Hunter PvP.
---
Check steamwheedle pier. I bet there are currently 2+ people fishing. After getting killed they wont release their ghost for several minutes but were constantly fishing before getting killed.
---
Mark of Tyranny. But as you have two trinket slots, and Mark of Tyranny paired with Smoking Heart is Mitigation BiS, that makes Smoking Heart part of your BiS.
---
Idk if it’s against tos but back in vanilla this was fixed so it was no longer doable at some point. I know cause I used to do it all the time. No idea why that change wouldn’t be in classic.
---
I'm exactly in the same situation
---
you are right, im glad the lady is being taken care of with luv :)
---
happy holidays. o7
---
I played 10+ hrs a day for 6/7 days, and barely got into bracket 10 on my realm for the week. Meaning I'd have to keep it up for months to reach R10. 
---
I think I'll just get the remaining 50% to R8 and take a break from ranking for a year or more.
---
Noggenfogger-EU? I swear I remember that name. 
---
I'm Drain
---
Look we only know one thing for certain. No matter how you fund it, its still pathetic.
---
Yeah our guild still hasn't see a single pair of might shoulders after 14 weeks. Our hunters, druids, and warlocks though are pimped the f*** out, everyone else only has a couple pieces.
---
Are there chains on that tree?
---
[Thats pretty Metal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MANPRkcoTqo)
---
Gtfo with your dirty boxer propaganda.
---
Or you could, you know, realize that someone leveling their first character to 47 at this point in the game has no fucking clue how to do that.
---
*Cries in warrior*
---
Anyone know what addon that is for the nameplates?
---
He could have been in a dungeon group with a Warlock and got summoned. Reason why he was overconfident is because he had a summon open and only needed to accept.
---
4/5
---
My husband says he likes your font.
---
Where is the portal in wsg?
---
How do you MC someone out of WSG? Asking for a friend.
---
With the size of our megaservers the bots are doing god’s work.
---
Dudes prob right tbh. If your a chronic 30 second spammer youre likely on a lot of peoples ignore list. Put at least 2 minutes in between posts.
---
It's not supposed to work and if it is that's a bug
---
Lol nobody is sitting here getting enraged like you think by your words. Also just because people don’t share the same elitist views as you do doesn’t make them bad at the game. Fact of the matter is yeah, part of the t1 set and other gear you’d be assumed to have with it, does make 5mans trivial and you should be able to tank it... whether your gear is 100% optimal or not. Keep being elitist over a 15 year old game idc
---
Idk about other classes but do not pick mage you’ll just cast frostbolt for hours and never get loot because 8 other mage loot goblins are in the raid.
---
That‘s nice :) Happy Holidays to you guys, too!!
---
A lot of assumptions you’re making: you don’t need to have played WoW to understand how to play the auction house. Read a book. 
---
I also fail to see where he states it’s his first character. 
---
You seem a tad angry - do you not know how to use the auction house? Would you like me to give you some tips?
---
 Trapped on a mountain, and into the fire
---
I mean, I did this for a horde player on my 60 alliance main the other day. Was in badlands, mining and watching Witcher, so i bet i got reported for botting lol.
---
I killed his mobs so he wouldn't freak out in chat and ruin my chill (especially so close to Kargath)
---
For a combat swords rogue, would Brutality Blade + Mirah's Song be an upgrade over the Dal rend set? Thanks and Happy Holidays.
---
HOLD YOUR GROUND
---
So its because all alliance are stupid that we have 5% winrate in a BG?
---
Its not like the BG is completely imbalanced that makes the winrate that skewed.
---
Imo this is the product of the 1.12.1 version as "alliance had the edge in earlier versions" (not really with backdooring tho) where now our starting spawn is way further behind than horde, so they can easily set up traps and reach the flanking points faster, they are at Balinda when we can first encounter. 
---
If the NPC were un-nerfed and actually did do some damage, then maybe the BG could be somewhat good.
---
So angry...on Christmas :(
---
Start buying materials for AQ40/Naxxramas while they are cheap. For AQ40 you're going to need nature protection, which will be way more expensive once the phase release date is announced. For Naxx, you're going to need nature protection, shadow protection AND frost protection all for one raid which will be expensive as fuck to buy multiples of every week.
---
thought that said dick surfing. which although still gay at least sounds more like a spectator sport and maybe worth watching
---
That was also true in classic.
---
I'd not considered that. Probably a tad over my skill level. (Max rank will have to suffice. I could be out of mana, of course, but it seems that I run out of health more often).
---
It doesn’t really matter for WoW or RPGs in general, but for FPS games at higher frame rates it minimizes input lag from the mouse and even though you can’t see the extra frames, your pc is still functioning at a higher rate for aiming.  This is why most competitive players uncap their frame rates (400+ FPS) even when using 144/240hz monitors.
---
It may not be the optimal gear, lacks threat and whatnot... but wouldn’t you agree it makes 5mans trivial? Which is what the discussion is about. A fresh warrior in greens/blues is more than likely not going to tank as well as a mostly MC geared warrior. This isn’t a min/maxing discussion. Just talking about how paying a tank 20g is pretty cheap for a group instead of waiting 20mins to find another
---
Can't add more, it's exactly why horde winning more often now. I can't remember single game where back door tactic was any useful. We wait 20 minutes between battles  so we defend a lot to get maximum of it.
---
The xbow is almost as good as blastershot launcher. You can get 6% hit quite easily with hit on bow. Striker is rogue prio anyway.
---
The fact that he defended a mage rolling on force of will really goes to show how much of a salty little bitch he was. You rolling on HoJ was fair game.
---
How many hours a day are they playing?
---
Because instant attacks like whirlwind and mortal strike and hand of justice and windfury all use weapon damage only and dont vare at all about swing speed. That axe you linked sucks hard man and if you dont see it you dont understand warrior dps
---
Shoulders and boots technically too
---
My point still stands tbh, the quality dropped hard, as the games have become pretty long compared to running games from discords with actual requirements
---
The hell is worth $20 plus gold or whatever the fee is?
---
&gt; So its because all alliance are stupid that we have 5% winrate in a BG?
---
YES!  Have you seen the chat?  Everyone thinks they have the winning strategy and they’re all wrong.
---
Not unusual at all. Mages get MQG in BWL and when it comes to pvp in BG or as a guild in the world your mages are generally your control and warlocks are pure dmg dealing
---
Tanking Strat Live over and over can net you some gold
---
&gt;exalted takes about 50.
---
Wins. 50 wins.
---
He’s pointing out that premades only accept 100 mounts.
---
Weird - I haven’t noticed at all.
---
Refer to https://shadowpanther.net/swords-pve.htm
---
Dal'rends have 285 and 229 MAEP, plus 50 for set bonus, for 564 total.
---
BB+Mirah's are 333 and 235, for 568 total.
---
So it seems to be a very minor upgrade.
---
Wtf? This is absolute crap on a mage...
---
i know 2 people have gotten temp ban for AV afk (3day bans). like i said longer bans will take longer time. AVs been out for like a month. And not all botters will be caught obv. there isnt 100% of anything.
---
calm your tits.
---
&gt;So its because all alliance are stupid that we have 5% winrate in a BG?
---
Yes.
---
Ahh man, I’m just curious if it would work haha. One of those “high” ideas except I’m not high. Lol
---
Lots of them did on private servers
---
Level 1-30 can only transfer with 100g
---
You. Guys. Can. Pull. Drek. Without. Warmasters.
---
Couldn't horde do that using snowball but it was patched the same day?
---
reported a fishing bot 3 weeks ago and its still fishing
---
Oh. I mean possibly but I think there may be a minimum level of like 10 for a transfer. Could be old memory but I think it should be possible.
---
Horde is winning because they are rewarded for dragging out games to guarentee more honor/rep, and because all good ally players are in premades due to being able to premade AV as ally but not as horde. It has nothing to do with "ally player mentality" or anything like that. Reverse the populations and you will see the exact same thing for horde.
---
RIP BABY
---
The BG favours alliance. The horde points are easier to capture. About every single AV i win as a horde the layout and backdoor are completely irrelevant because no alliance players are there defending. They always get stuck mid and never gets behind the horde graveyard until their own base is captured.
---
Seems about right. 5 horde guys and 95 allies.
---
No tears, I'm not crying just explaining my belief on the current state of this. Everyone on this subreddit is so quick to jump to conclusions about people. I honestly just want to be able to play with my friends, and I don't think that's too much to ask for for either side.
---
I think multi boxing is dumb and maybe should not be allowed but to call someone pathetic over it? Calm down man.
---
??? spergs never hitting r14 fam. they still asking people to move away from npc to click.
---
Damn :)
---
it is right to the graveyards on both sides
---
You click on them
---
It's extremely server dependent, if you have a tryhard PVE+PVP guild on alliance side, it will likely have a lot of gnome warriors and all of them want a pair, which drives the demand up.
---
Anyone capable of running an AH wouldn’t be asking an open ended question about whether or not they should spend 90g on a weapon.
---
Do you have Rhokdelar?
---
holy shit you disgrace jewish community everywhere.
---
The ones with the highest standing push close to 12 - 14.
---
The rest anywhere from 8 - 12. I probably do anywhere from 6 - 10 myself.
---
Indeed. As well as the quiver.
---
Would've been well worth it at levels 43, and its still a weapon good enough to take you to 60 or whenever you score a weapon from BRD. You'd be well off grinding runs of Maraudon until you get the 2hander from her, a WW axe definitely sucks at level 47. Lot's of good gear in that instance, and it should be fairly popular even at this time in the game's cycle.
---
Is there a way for me to enable/disable addons per character?
---
Do you have the 3% scope? Full gear enchants?
---
Yessir!!
---
My economic state is alright I think, i'm at \~300g (I like to fish a lot).
---
But I think that gold could be better spent at other expensive stuff at level 60.
---
Yeah then you've beat the game. Maybe play the AH? Twink gear or mats for BWL/AQ/Naxx.
---
Axe from emperor in BRD isn't half bad
---
And what is the horde strategy exactly? They seem just as clueless but they win 95% of the time anyways.
---
Blizzard always, yes always, bans in waves. What do you not understand about that? If someone starts botting they will be picked up in the next wave.
---
The xbow isn't worth it, go spear. You'll be hard pressed to make up that hit on other gear, but in some far-off scenarios you may want the Bloodseeker. Really, though, you want to get hit off your ranged slot.
---
No changes though
---
Savage :D
---
F
---
More assumptions. Strong logic.
---
I’d personally start saving for an epic mount but that’s just me.
---
That true, but its very far away.
---
That’s life in a game where gold has value
---
Me and my best friend leveled together until about lvl 51 then went separately to 60. We are Warlock/Priest and while leveling we could do some pretty massive pulls with each of us just dotting and kiting or sometimes a void sacc hellfire. Priest (him) was my mana supply and I paid for a ton of his water.
---
Yup
---
You don't need to spec healing for leveling. Shadow is extremely helpful for questing but if you're still grinding dungeons it's no big deal. I also wouldn't fret about speccing for shadowform immediately at 40 as some suggest, the real scaling doesn't kick in until 45 or so, when you can get 5/5 wand spec again and higher ranks of SWP/mind flay.
---
agreed, unless that person is gay in which case its 100% ok
---
source: am gay and i say this very often
---
Holy fuck why doesn't sonic serve lunch/dinner all day. I'm hungover and I want onion rings for breakfast

---
Most of Moo's videos are great.
---
Depends how fast you are and your luck. Also be aware that it's not for everyone. Less than half the hunters in my guild can actually reliably solo the instance. If you dont want a farming method that requires 100% of your focus and challenges you on every run, then it's not for you.
---
To answer your question though, probably 50-100g per hour on average. It's not nearly enough to justify leveling a hunter 1-60 if that's the only reason. Get mining or herb and you will earn more per hour when factoring in leveling time.
---
How does it favor alliance when I and everyone I talk to have an abysmall win record?
---
I don't see horde playing with any advanced tactics, and they love to fight in the middle as well. But they are able to defend the flanking points much easier (as you said) and stop alliance from progressing. While our base usually the archers just die to one guy since they are useless and then we get backdoored.
---
Its just messy and we lose everytime
---
If a damage dealer can do more damage, but resulting in him taking some more damage, that's something that we encourage. But casuals don't understand the minmaxa mentality
---
The procc does not generate any rage, sadly, but as feral tank you don‘t have issues with that anyways
---
Nope.
---
Stupid question— Can Horde and Alliance talk on a PvE server?
---
Reported for language
---
Is there a discord for druids?
---
Looking into playing a balanced druid as an alt to waste time and wanted to learn more about druids.
---
I personally let the bots do their thing. Whatever it is they're farming, they're increasing the supply and making it cheaper for me.
---
Just keep in mind too that Steamwheedle Pier is a pretty popular spot for 40-something’s to fish squid, mightfish and eels. So they’re not automatically a bot.
---
TBC &gt; WOTLK &gt; cata and so on until people stop playing, and then they stop. 
---
Or they can just let free money disappear to preserve the integrity of a 15 year old game. Very important that people get 3 years of farming naxx in and more WSG premade stomps.
---
This guy is fucking crazy lol
---
ironic he joins one where the horde lost
---
I rock a handful of pieces but mostly even in pvp, I don’t. Maybe I’m doing it wrong but my lock doesn’t use mc gear to pvp in. I use 2 pc of the knight set, and 2 pc of t2. Then I use the felheart robes. Belt I use the one off domo,
---
Pugs do it all the time. If horde doesn't put up a defense, and allows alliance to reach drek as a blob, it's an almost guaranteed 6 minute loss. Towers don't even have time to cap.
---
I'm dad.
---
Ok my mistake dude. I'll rephrase,  I'm not paying for 20 wow accounts just to proceed to get on a whole other account to take screenshots of the original 20.  I thought it was interesting and posted it. Or does the whole idea of posting cool things you see break your brain?
---
Who hurt you? Your not just unloading on me, your post history shows your actually a nasty and vile person..
---
Like I said - its time to grow up and be a big boy. Mummy and Daddy aren’t going to be around for ever.

If you don’t understand why they ban in waves there’s no helping you
---
You just seem like a bit of an idiot so I'm mocking you now.
---
Keep replying.
---
Doesn't holy talent against interupting + regular concentration aura give you 100% immunity to pushback anyway?
---
Typical Alliance. The deck is stacked in your favor and you STILL manage to lose and blame anything but yourselves. 
---
Y'all a disgrace.
---
But you mock literally every person you talk to on Reddit? I looked through your comments and half the shit you say is right on this line.
---
I don’t go out looking for arguments - who’s the loser here? Probably the guy who plays 6-10 hours of WoW a day.
---
I bet you jerk off about 6-10 times a day aswell.

I'm horde. We have a solo queue meta with ganking during 20-30min queues.

It’s a fairly low threat move, can’t crit to increase its threat. Etc.

Spamming sunder as a tank in 2019/2020 is like typing everything with CAPS LOCK on. Maybe it was acceptable in 2004. But it’s not now.
---
There are 2 types of comments on wow reddit
---
I'm still trying to process the trash mage rolling on FoW... That's almost as bad as the one that stole my Second Wind because apparently in 2019 mages stop reading after "increases"
---
Alliance simply self segregated.  Afkers and leeches on 60% mounts go PUG, everyone else premades.
---
If theyre on the opposite faction and you kill them they always res exactly where they died as well.
---
Enjoy your AV queues fuckers. You earned every bit of them for how your shitty fucking guild acted during phase 2
---
UI issue. Prob someone from a different sever with the same name as a horde on your server
---
suh dude
---
Ele scales insanely with t3
---
For PvP... As a Rogue I barely even get to hit a mage more than 2-5 times anyways. Those fights are near unwinnable for me. I assume it's similar for warriors going against mages.
---
Seems like overkill for PvP.
---
But I'm not a mage with a Band, so that's just assumptions.
---
Why do you say this? Won't every mage switch to fire by aq40?
---
Multiboxing
---
Dungeon carries is the fastest bar non. The other guy is right, but spell cleave groups are still common. 
---
Get to around 20 and start AOE farming. At 30 or so start looking for spell cleave SM groups and basically stay there till you're 42-44. Move to ZF and stay there till you're 50. From there do BRD prison farm to 60. 
---
ZF and brd are always happening on incindious.
---
Wtf is a lockblade my dude
---
i can smash every class as sm ruin although a good mage or spriest is difficult only if theyre good though
---
The fishing bots are rampant on my sever. Usually a large 40 mage, so they can port to cities and have a mount to get back to fishing. They seem to target feralas for the winter squid. Guy sells 10-20 stacks at a time, far too cheap for anyone manually fishing them. 8g/stack...
---
I’m not denying that. Ele scales and continues to do so. The problem is the gear doesn’t necessarily exist for ele. The tier set for shaman is a strong healer set not ele. So they’d basically need the few off set pieces / or stick with cloth and ele shaman don’t really like a lot of cloth for PvP. This in contrast with warlocks / mages / warriors that have access to a plethora of great slots for t3.
---
Found the grinch.
---
Horde chat in AV is usually busy with people either talking tactics or making jokes. Stuff like 'need 5 more defenders' 'all non mages join attack' 'need a rest druid for stealth caps'. Everyone really wants to win.
---
Your either a troll or a sociopath, you know the answer to that one.
---
&gt; dick surfing
---
&gt; a spectator sport and maybe worth watching
---
It's called porn.
---
They would have to make up more than a fraction of a percent of the player base for it to matter, and they dont
---
No layering, just a dying server.
---
Of course because you’re horde, ally doesn’t have WotF
---
This is the best course of action. Many bots have no repair routes, or, they will take forever to get back to repair with red gear. 
---
You can get many bots stuck but having them die to mobs 7-8 times.
---
I asked how to change the design of the cursor in a post ( https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/edpytf/any_addons_that_can_change_the_looks_of_the_cursor/ ) 2 days ago. I got two suggestions, but none worked. So I just bump this question in here in this thread hoping to reach someone who knows :)
---
You'll be swimming in hit with lhh, ony neck, djb and trustrike/onslaught.
---
Don’t bother with any hot because you can’t cap? Are you serious?
---
I've had a 'player' named Dsethgf on my friends list for a little over a month. This 'player' goes to popular mage AoE grinding spots with their fully green geared sub 60 rogue decked out in stam/agi gear and grinds grey mobs. It's amazing to me that this 'player' is still in game as they expose themselves to any mage attempting to AoE grind in the spot they've chosen to 'play'. Oh but don't worry, in half a year when Blizzard does their 'ban waves' they MIGHT be out of the game. :]
---
fair enough thats why you grind shards like a madman in between games. its worth it when you see those 7-8k hits in one global
---
it's 100% a Lockblade. Mages get Staff
---
Ofc they're not against it. 1 player paying for 5-40 accounts, great for business. Shitty for the game though. 
---
In BfA it doesn't matter. In classic, it's ridiculous and stupidly widespread.
---
People use it when air farming low level dungeons
---
Although the solos themselves aren't hard, the fucking RNG is simply a pain in the ass and is the reason why I'm not running it anymore (got epic mount and sitting on a confortable amount of gold). Doing 3 runs without any issues and then wiping 4 times in a row for 1 hour while trying to get to the last boss is incredibly frustrating.
---
Not exactly. The tank only stated that he needed the green for repair cost without any supporting argument. 
---
Maybe he's broke. Maybe hes not good at saving gold. He didn't say. Who knows? 
---
I agree that it's not a good for one's sanity to play dungeons with groups you don't get along with. My point is (in this case) is that he *could have* gotten along with the group simply by saying a bit more. 
---
But like I said, **both sides are questionable**. OP isn't necessarily an A-hole but he wasn't being mindful either. Nor did he himself ask the tank what was going on and seemed to have made his refusal rather quickly.
---
What the fuck amazing loot
---
conflag locks use seduce so they can charge up a soulfire
---
Everyone passed...
---
it's not back on, it's Xmas and people have better things to do than play WoW
---
Stop talking about this 6% hit in every threat. Its super duper annoying when everyone spreads misinformation.
---
Premades are the real reason. 
---
Because so many people who are 60 and geared are in premade discords, that means the standard pugs will have a disproportionate amount of sub 60 chars and people who don't really care.
---
Horde has a ton of advantages too.  Towers are better for horde, tower placement is better, horde has choke points that aren't easy to bypass (both in FW Keep and at IB), etc.  On the other hand Galv doesn't iceblock so we got that.
---
We're not spreading that mentality though. There's just a few bad youtbers/streamers in the community with bad knowledge of the game that has been spreading misinformation for years. It has nothing to do with the min-max community. Literally every mid-maxer that made a name for themselves in the community has always said that the game is easy.
---
I just managed to convince my GF to try wow, we've only got to level 12 but shes been accused of being a bot simply because she hasn't quite grasped how to do everything yet
---
Could you provide a recording?
---
Typ.
---
You love to argue..
---
Hahaha No? Icewing bunker is a huge choke for Horde. Same thing goes for bridge area. Do not try and claim that Horde got the advantage in AV.
---
The Horde side of AV is really respectable. Horde got demolished for the first few days, then progressively changed their strategies until things became horde favored. Like you said, a vast majority of horde seem on board unlike Alli where 5-10 people are AFK, and the rest just want to dick around in the middle.
---
As much as I'm sick of the AV grind the shifting meta the impact of queue times and the way Horde adapted is fascinating.
---
i love that stuff
---
No. It really can’t lol. Gay had that connotation over 100 years ago. It hasn’t for 40+. Language evolves.
---
if you have t2 definitely use that. i just got my pvp 2 set bonus also so ive replaced my T1 with that. when youre THAT geared yeah youre right you probably only have a couple of pieces. damn t2 legs never drop for me...
---
It's like everyone has forgotten to don their gay apparel.
---
I sorta miss it, world pvp isn't that much fun and I just want to be able to farm some elemental fire without competing for tags down to the millisecond.
---
No cross realm mail is not a thing
---
Bushoshoku REPORTED
---
mp5 is nice for trash and dungeons though, as well as pvp. It's generally nice to have a mp5 set to swap to when you feel like your mana does not last long enough. It's usually a good idea to get several sets for all the different situations you can get into.
---
paladins aren't really looking for "specific" stats other than +heal. yes they can wear everything, but in this content phase you dont look for crit specifically, and you do not become a lvl 40 priest if you do not stack crit on your gear. thats just false information.
---
I guess if you brought 4x16 slot bags and a maxed bank. Buy a bunch of enchanting materials, raid consumables, epics etc. Then transfer and sell them for a profit.
---
I know there are a few servers where things like the Quel'Serrar book sell for 1000g+, and some that sell it for 250g. Huge potential there if this works.
---
nah i mean like a competition. like weight lifting or fencing
---
with dicks
---
I bet I look like a bot when fishing. Like a really shitty bot. I’ll basically forget I’m fishing, fish a couple casts then forget I’m fishing (due to work or TV or something). Also I’ve got a macro that automatically applies my lure and opens clams in addition to casting. So I basically hit 1, mouse over the lure in the water, then watch TV and hit ~ (which I have bound to interact with mouse over) when I hear a catch.
---
I wish all my buttons were not already used up. If you wanted to you could make a macro with modifier key so you can get multiple yells out of one macro. I think that would work, idk.
---
Saw a shaman multiboxer doing an awesome choreography in Og on someone's Stream. Anybody know if there's videos of it?
---
I think multiboxing should absolutely not be allowed, but I don’t see how it’s pathetic.
---
There is a entire level of magnitude between a small private server and classic wow. The comparison is meaningless.
---
Nah, you’re getting downvoted because you sound like an asshole
---
Im usually pretty fair, i dont gank greens too often when leveling (I don’t have a 60 yet)
---
Then still die slowly to curse of agony.
---
Cycles can be sped up or made slower, their cycles should come more frequently. Simple to grasp?
---
But TF is a terrible MH and as a fury tank (assuming you are one as most tanks are at this point), you will be using TF in your off hand exclusively.
---
I always feel bad when I believe I've found a bot after observing it for like 20 seconds but then realize it's just a newbie.
---
Or maybe, maybe it's just that whoever was running the bot got a notification that another player was nearby and took control for a few minutes to avoid detection ? *xfiles theme*
---
People mistakenly understand boring as hard. Paladins are very easy to level but are extremely boring and you need to upgrade your weapon a lot.
---
So, uh... which is it?
---
Why is this bad. Do something else with your life.
---
I like the idea. Hope this sub doesn’t turn in to:
---
 „did. anybody say 
---
[Thunderfury, blessed Blade of the windseeker] ?“
---
Improved hammer is practically mandatory. So good.
---
No.
---
It started strong but it's winding down.
---
Fuck multiboxers, even if it is Christmas.
---
Get a life, nerds. You're cheating and you know it, corporate greed just allows you to continue getting away with it.
---
Seeing this on Horde side is weird. Usually that happens when a premade decides do dodge duo to not getting enough on their own players in the same game.
---
Yes, you use this macro for heroic strike
---
#showtooltip Heroic Strike
---
/startattack
---
/cast Heroic Strike
---
/stopcasting
---
you need a weapon swing timer too, what you do is have hs queued when your OH will hit before your MH, otherwise cancel it
---
Lol... easy solution: buy a few jungle fevers on AH before you go farm
---
Sure. I bet there are tons of players who (same faction as you) won't reply to your messages but will continue to attack the mobs that you tagged first, out of the goodness of their heart.
---
rogue and prieat is really fun for ganking lure them im with the priest then stun lock them to death
---
Yikes cringe.
---
I have about 45 days on /played and i'm still broke af
---
Didja run the imp fd talent? Gathering data
---
Things start going green and even gray. It's impossible. At some point you have to go out and mine.
---
I guess that's true for all melees. Fortunately most weapons are really cheap now, especially fast weapons like Taran Icebreaker and Brainhacker, which no Warrior wants but are really good Pala weapons.
---
This happens to alliance like 50% of the time. One game started 13 vs 40.
---
Shaman/Warrior, but it really doesn't matter; with 2 people, all leveling content will be a breeze no matter what classes you are.
---
They go for 275 to 350 on my server
---
You should try it out, multiboxing can be fun. :-)
---
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure it's impossible as there's several times where all of my smelts were grey and I could only level by mining.
---
Works fine, and is great for both bears and cats.
---
Maul can give you an extra maul if you spam the ability and you have the extra rage to spare.
---
Swipe gives you an extra chance to proc for each enemy it hits. (Not a huge boost, but pretty fancy.)
---
It's amazing for dungeons and for threat generation, the bonus attack power isn't nothing either. You won't always use full mitigation, so don't be afraid to pick it up if you can be bothered to farm it.
---
&gt;You're missing my point. I'm talking about the case where the top bracket group doesn't want other people to join them and anyone who plays a lot solo is told to fuck off and stop playing instead of getting invited.
---
Mostly my scenario. There's a solid group of players that I rank with who are very good at the game, but we explicitly don't want to be involved in the clique of abusive players who control the majority of the ranking brackets. They're toxic, rude, abusive, and all around have shit personalities off stream. They'll double cross you at any chance if it benefits them and lie you and cheat you out of everything you own if given the opportunity. Not the behavior we choose to expose ourselves too and so this is why we rank solo.
---
That doesn't make any sense, i think adults have higher expendable income than kids, so why would you assume that it was a kid multiboxing?
---
/console rawMouseEnable 1 fixed this for me
---
becuase lockblade is for lock
---
Why farm that much gold with nothing to spend it on?
---
I only ever farm gold if I actually know there's something I need to buy. Since I stocked up on consumables, I haven't farmed gold in weeks simply because I haven't needed to buy anything.
---
/console rawMouseEnable 1
---
Thank for this!
---
I see which one you are :)
---
message me the name and i can tell you. I don't want to get banned lol
---
Oh hey, are you Bitcoin from Rattlegore? Like, a gnome warlock or something? I've seen you! About a week ago (think it was Saturday night), my friends and I were in Felwood, and we were tanking allies. I was a naked troll and I punched you to death. Do you remember that? 😅
---
I believe Vael  will be much easier than some people think. Vael is mostly a dps check. The current talents in classic are the same as those in late vanilla, not the same ones during the original BWL release.
---
Itll show if you updated bagnon, elsewise when your bags are open click 'bag slots' at the top of your bag window and it should show the keyring there.
---
It's entirely perspective taht you feel that way.
---
"Biggest is of course gold" - 10x as much gold from quest rewards, but 10x as much repair &amp; reagent &amp; food/water bills, 10x as many Training costs, but we still get 1x as many drops, so no, try thinking further than one sentence. Lvling 5 chars does not get us enough gold for 5x mount trainings unless we stop to grind hard, which is about the same as any normal player. We get less exp per kill too due to group split, and a lot of boxers don't even do many quests in the first place, some just sit in dungeons to grind, so that knocks your whole gold from quests comment out of the park.
---
I play 5 locks. 5x Corruption, 5x CoA, 5x Siphon Life and it does start to melt people. But not fast enough that the warrior or priest can't run in and aoe fear me, sending alts in every direction and/or murdering me. My fears get interrupted. Death Coil has a long cooldown and requires a lot of work to make it so I don't waste all 5 on one cast.
---
But see, that's where you show your failure of logic: "That's absurd coming from one person" - No, that's coming from 5 CHARACTERS. The # of people behind the chars is irrelevant, dingus. You're talking about 5-10 chars fighting one character. Would you charge into a group of non-boxed enemies? No, that would be fucking stupid to do by yourself. So why the fuck do you idiots charge into a multiboxer, like I saw every goddamn day on my pvp server before I left? What possesses you dumbasses to think you can take 5 enemies on and win, especially if they're like me and don't attack unless in self-defense?
---
Botting is just that: ROBOTic automtion. Requires no HUMAN input. Multiboxed chars do NOTHING without HUMAN input. No matter what "mental gymnastics" you try to do yourself, the simple fact is, without someone to pull the strings, Pinnochio the Multiboxer is dead. Meanwhile, Crushotron 5000 runs fine with 0 human assistance. Deal with it.
---
And finally..."Blizzard will never ban multiboxers because $" - They banned multiboxers that abused that instance reset bug months ago. They ban any multiboxer that automates their gameplay (keyword is automate - see previous paragraph, your "opinion" on what "automation" is doesn't change the actual definition) - If a Multiboxer actually does something wrong, they have no issues banning them.
---
In closing, I'd just like to laugh HARD at every single post that thinks $75 for a whole month's worth of entertainment is expensive. If you're not on a budget, or in a bad spot financially, maybe. Any actual adult with common fucking financial sense knows that that's fairly cheap. Some people spend 10x that on a single month of Gacha mobile games. Your dinner at a sit-down restaurant will cost that much or more for a measly 2 people, and that's for 1 single fucking meal + tip, something you'll literally be shitting out and flushing in less than 24hrs and have nothing to show for it. Tickets to any show or event cost that or 2x more, and that's another single night of entertainment. Shit, you pay more for your cable tv alone if you're still stupid enough to have cable instead of streaming services, and you don't even watch half of those channels or shows. $75 for 30 days of being able to do anything I want ingame without waiting for a group, or dealing with bad groups, is a steal.
---
(And before you go to the whole "antisocial in an mmo" dealy in reply to the last part, I help people I come across beat elites when they can't find a group. I save people from dying when they overpull. I chat in general chat and in town when I'm taking a break. I joined a random social guild so I'd have folks to talk to and sometimes help out. I get my socialization. I just don't depend on others.)
---
The dude definitely is a dick unless someone had been screwing up and causing lots of wipes.  I tank and typically each run at the very least nets me enough money to pay my repair bill.
---
They're by the vendors and the gryphons.
---
There aren't many "good" PvP videos, most of them are just compilations of critical strike killshots and trinket procs.
---
Welcome to Phase 2- Alliance players suffered through getting exterminated and turned into honor grinding mechanics due to Horde majority prior to BGs, now they get to enjoy quick queue times due to Horde majority.
---
Either reroll or enjoy your Horde majority. It’s what you signed up for, after all.
---
I am currently having this issue
---
Fuck that Bosushoku guy. This is wholesome.
---
You like smash? You like big white number? Warrior. You like getting smashed? Dwarf warrior with shield and akle.
---
I bind my 6-9 usually to my extra mouse buttons. he probably did the same
---
The first day or two of AV had faster queues for horde so horde were okay with losing quickly in exchange for being able to kill lieutenants and Balinda for rep/honour and letting ally win. So 7-9 min wins consistently in random avs were common for ally those days. Since then, horde queues have gotten significantly longer so they have stopped purposely losing as its no longer the faster honor/rep per hour for them. Additionally all the good alliance players are doing premade AVs while the good horde players still have to pug so the player pool is very different.
---
It's pretty unusual
---
Wash yer back!
---
Good to see some multiboxer posts finally getting upvotes for once. I swear redditors are such a finicky bunch, they'll upvote this but downvote any other multiboxer post as if there's any real difference between him showing off in town or showing off in a dungeon lol
---
Log into one of your other characters, it should disconnect your main after a few minutes IIRC.
---
Imagine being mad at a pally for winning his BiS... I knew most casters were crayons eaters
---
That's a guildmate of mine on Dreadmist horde.
---
But horde players can’t premade queue so that’s not what happened there
---
Unless your trying to pick up gamer chicks if say no.
---
No, Christmas presents do not grant experience points.
---
Like post rude shit on the wow subreddit?
---
Def a lockblade mages should get dagger or staff
---
Yes, right, TF is a "terrible MH". Definitely, right on.
---
People in this sub...
---
Saw that too some weeks ago. 
---
I was wondering what they do until i turned in the repeatable quest. 5 crabs = 55s...i was there like "ooooh you cheeky bastards"
---
Thanks, good to see a blue post on the matter.
---
What are those weird cirlces with the x's?
---
If I wanted to play a game with a stacked advantage in my favor, I would just play 1 of a million single player games available. Its PvP. Not PPPPvP.
---
I heard about that macro and haven't gotten a chance to try it out yet. Thanks for reminding.
---
You’re fine unless the loot rules were first orb res then round robin, you have literally no reason to be there other than farming and round robin needs to be specified by the group prior to the run.
---
Yeah you should, because you want to. Unless you just trying to smash, then you leave that shit out.
---
Looks alot better on Orcs :-)
---
If I see you reserve orbs on my server, I'll instantly ignore you.
---
Amazing you could even rank up with that much honor.
---
Put in in there in caps! I would fall for you immediatly, but then I am a guy and I don’t understand woman anyway, so my advice is probably not the best. 
---
Or put it like: I lead 30 man into battle in the desert and took out 30 terrorists singlehandedly. They will think you are a commando or something.
---
No just you trying to farm karma, while so many idiots fall for it. lol I love how stupid the average user of this sub is.
---
Should see firemaw I think most of the top 100 are over 1 mil.
---
Honestly Feral druids of both types are pretty damn easy to gear up I find, having done it recently myself.
---
Almost no one rolls on the tanking pieces so you can get them almost all the time. Some of the DPS pieces you definitely have competition with but rogues/hunters/DPS warriors are often small competition on different pieces due to to often having many of them in a party at once. 
---
It's so easy to get opposite spec pieces "may I need for OS?” all the time too. On top of that so much literal BiS or even just top tier pieces are from outside of raids so you can farm them more often than raids.
---
&gt;Its PvP. Not PPPPvP.
---
Oh is it? How about you go and tell the Horde on my server that.
---
It's quite bad, lol.
---
I do all orbs res if I tank start live. The 58s usually appreciate me carrying them through.
---
So wall jumps to the top?
---
Yeah there's definitely bots but there's also people I thought were bots but was quite wrong... some newer players are just keyboard turners with no situational awareness.
---
&gt; "Biggest is of course gold" - 10x as much gold from quest rewards, but 10x as much repair &amp; reagent &amp; food/water bills, 10x as many Training costs, but we still get 1x as many drops, so no, try thinking further than one sentence.

---
I didn’t say leveling 5 characters gets you enough gold for 5x mount trainings. I’m saying it gets you enough for one. Way more than one person would on their own. You’re kidding yourself if you think I’m going to believe you’re not making more than one person does on their own.
---
And just sitting in dungeons to grind? Cool. So you get to do something that no one else could possibly do on their own. Thanks for another example of something to hate you for. 
---
&gt; But see, that's where you show your failure of logic: "That's absurd coming from one person" - No, that's coming from 5 CHARACTERS. The # of people behind the chars is irrelevant, dingus. You're talking about 5-10 chars fighting one character. Would you charge into a group of non-boxed enemies? No, that would be fucking stupid to do by yourself.

What possesses you dumbasses to think you can take 5 enemies on and win, especially if they're like me and don't attack unless in self-defense?
---
Oh right. Because I completely disagree with you that the number of people behind the characters is irrelevant, that’s means I’m failing at logic. Cool. You sure are making the argument in your favor buddy!
---
Also, who said anything about attacking multiboxers solo? I didn’t even specify who was attacking. I’m simply talking about the fact that one PERSON can completely destroy one other PERSON in a wildly unfair way that goes against the spirit of the game. Yes, the number of people behind the characters fucking matters. 
---
&gt; Botting is just that: ROBOTic automtion. Requires no HUMAN input. Multiboxed chars do NOTHING without HUMAN input. No matter what "mental gymnastics" you try to do yourself, the simple fact is, without someone to pull the strings, Pinnochio the Multiboxer is dead. Meanwhile, Chinese Huntertron Bot 5000 runs fine in Deadwind Pass or Azshara Beaches with 0 human assistance, those are Bots. Deal with it.
---
Notice how I didn’t say multiboxing IS botting? Because I’m not a fucking idiot and already recognize the difference. I specifically said multiboxing is as bad as botting, not that it is botting. Try reading next time.
---
One player should be one character. Any more than that should not be allowed. 
---
&gt; And finally..."Blizzard will never ban multiboxers because $" - They banned multiboxers that abused that instance reset bug months ago. They ban any multiboxer that automates their gameplay (keyword is automate - see previous paragraph, your "opinion" on what "automation" is doesn't change the actual definition) - If a Multiboxer actually does something wrong, they have no issues banning them.
---
First, again, I know what fucking automation is. Try reading.
---
Second, multiboxing itself is wrong, and blizzard isn’t banning multiboxing. They ban for various exploits, but some of those have nothing to do with multiboxing. 
---

---
I literally said nothing about how much you’re spending on entertainment. I don’t give a fuck about this at all. 
---
Nice strawman wall of text though. 
---
&gt; (And before you go to the whole "antisocial in an mmo" dealy in reply to the last part, I help people I come across beat elites when they can't find a group.

---
Pretty fucking presumptuous of you to throw out more strawman shit like this.
---
Every person I've ever known that was salty over multiboxing was very low in the finances department, always came off as more envious of their subscription capabilities than the actual gameplay of it.
---
Well from what I've encountered there's two methods of doing strat live orbs; everyone greeds every orb, or people round robin it. While it's obviously better individually to get to roll on every orb, feelings and image are a real thing (combined with the fact that your chance of winning more than 1 a run are low) so I prefer the 2nd method so everyone has good feelings.   
---
Going with the first method, obviously you did nothing wrong. Going with the second method, you're still getting the 1st orb every time. As you can see, even though you get like 20g worth of npc-ables a run, people just really freak out about loot. I say pass subsequent orbs to keep people happy; you're chance of winning more than one a run is low, and to me it's not worth it; there is a value on people's happiness (literal value, if people are happy they will run more runs with you in the future, giving you the opportunity to get that 1st guaranteed orb).  
---
Hope I made sense with my view on that.
---
Wow a WHOLE $240 a month? This guy must be the King of France or something!
---
Here is where you fucked up. The "accepted" way to deal with righteous orbs is round robin. This means that once you have gotten one, you pass on them until everyone gets one. You only get a chance at two orbs if 6 drop in one run. No one really outright explains it, but that's how it's generally understood. The problem with community driven solutions is there is no hard rule, but that's what is expected of you from the average player.
---
I'm not suggesting to spam sunder
---
8 points in fury makes no sense though. 5 crit is amazing, what useful thing can you put the other 3 points in?

Your right, Blizzard has a seemingly infinite amount of resources as compared to Light's Hope, yet they suck because they don't care about the game.

As a Rogue, tanks should roll on this.

That was Maradon when you did the scepter teleport. I also killed a fair amount of ppl with that trick
---
I to want to know as well keep me updated!
---
I don't have my epic yet which is why I want to level up herb so I can farm gold in DM E runs haha.
---
I don't mind it taking longer though, one or two days would be good with me.
---
What level do you need to hit to farm the expensive herbs, is it 215?
---
Read up. Thanks.
---
That was my thought too, but it could be that he has just posted here before and I remember the name cause it’s awesome.

It prevents bots from ban evading, which would be much worse for blizz

Then it doesn’t help the core problem of bots adapting

Hmm. That seems... Surprisingly reasonable

I chortled
---
How long would it take to get exalted with AV?
---
Though aoe farming is pretty difficult.
---
Heard of Qia is Everlook before? That’s why..
---
Yes you should, you should wherever possible have both options for each slot. You can then swap them out in order to accommodate fight length. "Bis" gear tends to operate under the assumption that you will pop consumables like candy, which isn't always necessary.
---
what is best site to see logs ?
---
i am using  [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/) 
---
but they didnt update my hunter logs in last 3 raids
---
It’s a pretty standard rule everywhere unless you say otherwise at the start.  Warrior tanks rolling on tank gear, plate DPS, and leather DPS gear is shitty. 
---
My only problem with this is he got all huffy about “that’s a tank item” bc he was a tank, and this was after he rolled in DPS loot.  Pick your spec before a run
---
For a 2 hand using warrior is 20/31 with 2h weapon specialization better or 16/35 with improved slam?
---
They are coordinating themselves and joining the specific AV ID. So yes, it can be their fault.
---
There is a good chart of all the herbs on classic wow head. Just Google classic wowhead herbalism guide.
---
So, what's the original video? That scene got me interested
---
I’d date a gamer LONG before I’d date someone who isn’t.

If I ever had an online profile, I’d mention that I’m a gamer, and a hardcore one too. Not just PC stuff, but board games (I play Settlers of Catan at tournament level), card games, D&amp;D, MTG - love games.
---
Pretty much dating a dude who isn’t, is a deal breaker.

So go for it! Honest profiles ftw!
---
Had this. Read the blue post  about it. Did the DNS flush and reset router and PC. Worked for me (about 40 minutes after the bug)

its really simple, and can be streamlined by automation, shitty corporate culture is no excuse. Gold selling is as rampant as the botting, and that shit is the easiest to stomp to out with a little vigilance.

Most multiboxers are doing PVE, not PVP.  **The actual fun PVP areas for multiboxers have not allowed /follow in them (such as Battlegrounds, and even world PVP zones), for years now.**
---
Sure, there's some world PVP here and there. But multiboxers who do it for the purpose of random world PVP? lol.
---
Far more likely that he is interested in 10+ man raids, and there's no "stacked advantage in the multiboxer's favor".

Never heard of this. Sure not a prank? As private servers are not maintained by blizzard or endorsed.

Follow up q to that - are dungeon exp runs typically for all dungeons or mostly for a select few?

You can level purely through smelting until skill 150 or so, everything after that is grey as soon as you train it.

Sure, just PM me your account details and I will make it happen.

Why is that weird the respawn rate isn’t a strict hour,m.

Hmm this sounds like a cool idea. I’ve been looking for a side project. If any other devs decided a to tackle this let me know we can collaborate!

Fuck multiboxers. Don't support them.

Look, I have stats too:

Here are the MC DPS logs of all the top mages in the world:

And the shadow priests:

You'll notice immediately that mages are several hundred dps higher.

Good luck with this one chief.

It's a scene from [Bajirao Mastani](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3735246/)

It was considered to be 12million peak but that may have included some rounding.  Either way it was closer to 12mil flat than 11mil flat.

But definitely NEVER close to 15million.

You'd think this time around people would be more inclined to do LBRS key runs to actualy have the key but nope. UBRS is getting farmed on a daily basis while LBRS groups for the key are hard to come by.

It’s not about the disadvantages multiboxers have, it’s about the advantages.
---
If you could fly into the air as if you had a flying mount with an exploit, but every time you do it you have to pay 100 gold... yes you could absolutely argue that isn’t remotely worth it, but that doesn’t mean it’s ok and should still be allowed.
---
They're only as dedicated as you and op :)

Weird considering hunter is basically just a class for people who can't afford to multibox

if they were smart they'd have locks scattered throughout the tree lifetapping, so it looked like tinsel

so my raid logs for last 3 weeks r lost and theres nothing i can do about it ?
---
who needs to log it ? anybody from raid ?
---
"BIS long into BWL." Careful with the wording, champ.
---
I’m so glad I did it on my main, but I really don’t wanna do it on my mage alt.
---
Ah ok I guess for a bottable thing like that its decent gold.  Still took me a good 15m or so to get the 10 shellfish I needed.  I wasn't sure if they were trying to sell the fishing poles on the AH or what.
---
Even tapping at the finish of a shadow bolt causes a 3.3% damage drop? Guess I never even assumed it was anything more than minimal.
---
Are we talking about Demonic Runes or Dark Runes?
---
Bis and Prebis guides are just made by *some guy* they are usually crap unless they are well researched.

You can’t really believe that Druid tanks should be allowed to roll on Briarwood Reed with equal priority to the mages in the group.  Do you?

I’d say no. My wife learned eventually I spent my time playing wow, but not sure if at the beginning via bio would have had a connection. My wife isn’t a gamer, but is supportive.

Jesus, yes.
---
This is the right answer
---
I use discord. We have a soft reserve channel, members go in prior to first pull and put in their soft res. I put each on an excel spreadsheet and delete them from the discord. The reason here is that we dont want people to be able to see what items are not soft ressed so they can change their res to an item no one else ressed. It's just to promote items going to free roll but to each their own
---
Devs f'd up when they made that key quest.
---
Pretty incredible for shamans but that's about it
---
Should be pretty simple to do alone if you use an existing Reddit Bot library available in I assume many languages. SnooWrap for JavaScript looks good.
---
When they cleared it, almost all mobs in the dungeon turn non-hostile. Anyone that the hunter invites can walk in and take items from the chest freely.
---
Does this work with skills like Bloodthirst/Sunder in Dual wield? I want to do my best with DPS while tanking and any ways to increase my contributions to raiding would be great.
---

The buff falls off if you remove the ring. Yea that sucks. Butttt if you use the ring right before you log out, when you log in you will have the buff and the ring will be off CD. You can then reactivate it as soon as your 500 damage shield falls off, effectively doubling the on use effect. I thought it was kinda cool. Dropped for my Druid alt on my first lbrs, has been really useful so far.
---
Keep in mind if you xfer to a pve server- you can never xfer back to a pvp server.

Not the chest, from King Gordok himself when he dies.

Alliances pugs have no strategy.  Half of them are on their own agenda and the other half is arguing about whether galv is dead.
---
"I can make 39 people come at once with my fingers, imagine what I could do if I was focused on you"
---
you cant give it a fixed value and dismiss everybody else.  
---
The value depends on your total spellpower.  
---
there is no one fits all math for it..  
---
And with increasing total spellpower, its worth even more spell power. At naxx gearlevel its clearly worth 20+spellpower.
---
Anyone got good recent warlock ones?
---
lame
---
Nah a bot will immediately 'click' the bobber as soon as it pops and cast immediately. Bots are efficient. They'd never miss casts, misses the purpose of being a bot.
---
Cool stuff! Very useful to track deposits made by guild members. I submitted two issues on Github that could improve the project, and trying to collect information for a third. I tested the addon this afternoon and could easily export new deposits, then had more people send test deposits to further test the reliability and when all their mail arrived, I went to the mailbox but no deposits were recorded, no chat message that new stuff arrived (even though herbs were included) and also exporting yielded no new transactions. Either the function crashed or all new deposits were considered old ones.
---
Also you need to update the Discord invite link to a permanent one, the one on the website expired.

How ass mad are you that I'm bad mouthing your Daddy? This fresh is still fun and nothing I do will stop gold sellers, I just don't delude myself that this isn't shit compared to other vanilla servers.

The problem is you have alliance in PREMADES so first they wipe you on drek, then they pull drek, then if alliance are smart they set up rogues and hunter traps on the recall location and its impossible to do anything. You make it sound like its this simple task when you're playing a coordinated team.

I misinterpreted what you wrote. Or, I think you misinterpreted what  [39bh39](https://www.reddit.com/user/39bh39/) meant.

"put on a shield and sunder armor" isn't to be taken literally. It means to nut up and tank yourself.
---
You don't need to be protection to tank, actually I think arms is the best 5men tank.
---
Keep felstriker, it’s decent for fury and actually really good for tank TPS. But replace Gutgore ASAP as it eats a debuff slot on the boss. That debuff slot is much better used by pretty much anything else. Good guilds heavily control the debuffs that get put on the boss and Gutgore is one of the few banned weapons in raid. There’s a few others but that’s the more notable one. 
---
As far as replacements get dal rends main hand until you get a viskag or a brutality blade. Your MC bis is viskag mainhand brutality blade offhand. But until you have both run felstriker offhand and DR main hand.

Maybe somebody’s already done it and had the info readily available. Some people get so upset about others trying to be social

How do the Alliance AV premades make for a partially filled AV Horde side? Been offline for about a week, but I did not think Horde could reliably do premades and I don't see how Alliance mischief could cause this.
---
Yeah, but it forces you to get to know the town etc. This change seems benign but actually disconnects you from the game and makes it more arcade-y.
---
Is 45 minutes to 1 hr 15 minutes the current truth?
---
join a different premade discord
---
the fact that this bracket organizing is even half working with cross faction bgs is hilarious
---
Cola Zero... eww!
---
Cause all the good players are in premades. Join a pug game = get stomped by the horde 95% of the time. Join a premade = stomp the horde 99% of the time.
---
The debuff is low priority. It gets pushed off right away
---
What if you were one of the greedy people trying to profit off of the items you got by playing legitimately?

The 49 bracket doesn't need any more shadow priests. Shadow priests are a waste of a slot that could have gone to an actual healer.
---
Repost with same gif and same title what the FUCK is you doin baby????
---
yea it’s a bitch honestly. at most 1 of each gem / run makes it not the easiest thing to farm. i did over 30 runs looking for Hands of Power and only completed the key in my last few runs
---
&gt;You. Guys. Can. Pull. Drek. Without. Warmasters.
---
Horde can do that too
---
I love the whisper that you didn't screenshot it for reddit karma.  Yet here is a screenshot on reddit for karma.
---
If wanting to pay less for materials and items is greedy then I guess I'm greedy. We're all greedy to an extent but I don't drive prices up to thousands of gold so only a few can afford.
---
Wouldn't one be able to just stand stealthed in the room during the whole fight? The range for loot on bosses is something like 250 meters, farther than that and you won't get credit for the kill and partake in loot.
---
Rank is graded on a curve. You and every other person no-lifed AV on release. Daddy chill.
---
i just had this drop this am too a shamy in my group ended up with it
---
I doesn't really bother me. Layer abuse was much worse for the economy imo.

You can use AM as your primary attack, it just doesn't scale well so you (almost) never see it.
---
"This is the gayest thing I've seen in a while"
---
Normal multiboxers are totally fine with me - spend your money how you like. Multiboxers who do it for pvp are the biggest losers who play world of Warcraft imo (looking at you aoeone to five in Fairbanks...)

I was ecstatic when I got them back. He’s a talented guy.

I'm a holy/prot hybrid Pally leveling mining/Eng and I'm just about at the point of picking gnomish or goblin. I've read on here that the popular thing to do is get all the gnomish BoP items then re-level as goblin. Well I'm only going to level this once, which should I take?

It was probably me lol.

This Addon works like a charm even with the standard raid fraims. However it needs all healer to download this addon or another Unitframe addon with the Healcomm Library in it.

Don't hold your breath.

I like LBRS but I just hate how when you are in a pug you have idiots who  try to guess at stuff, change markings or go the wrong way. 
---
The place has so many close packs and just in general nasty packs you might not want to rush into blindly that it's so easy to wipe. 
---
Such an easy example is the second pack in the dungeon. You have to clear the adds just at the top of the ramp but then you have groups wanting to skip the one pack under the bridge bit and go up onto the bridge and make the jump. But there's that pat that pulls the large pack of five that sits there. But everyone wants to skip that one pack under the bridge.
---
Do you guys not understand how PVP works in this game?  No one can \*force\* you to participate in the brackets.  If the people organizing don't include you - go for it!  Break brackets!  The system only works if \*everyone\* coorperates.  No one can control  your honor.  You can play as much or as little as you like.  The point of the brackets is to be a \*mutual\* agreement to reduce \*everyones\* grind time.
---
MC is pretty stale, I’m not asking them to rush out content but BWL should be released in 2-4 weeks for sure
---
That just takes getting there before anyone zones in and asking the leader to reset the instance for Jed. 
---
You can target him from the zone in for most of his path. Sit there for 45 seconds with a /tar Jed macro. Nothing gets targeted? Reset and try again.
---
No don't use it.
---
I was wondering about doing this with the gnomish battle chicken. I’m not sure how to use it in raid.
---
/me purrs like a kitten and rubs against %t!

---
Xp is rewarded by the average lvl of the group - so you would want 4 people at the same low level and then a 60 to carry your through.
---
Common carries would be Deadmines, Stockades, all SM, and ZF.
---
90% of players have killed rag, time for bwl to add a new challenge
---
Works just fine if you activate and switch it out before fight
---
r14 is the equivalent of grinding a new 1-60 every week for 3months+
---
i don't really disagree with you or agree for that matter but it's not exactly comparable
---
Yea because you can insta lose. If you don't roll a 1, your opponent is now going "first", and you have that slight advantage instead.
---
That's perfectly fine. Takes a few minutes to find a Jed ID and any mage/warlock/priest that would want it should either reserve it, do it in a guild run or just grind it.
---
There is one guy I see sometimes looking for a healer for 2 hours straight while reserving 2 orbs.
---
That's cause you a silly goose 😂
---
Do all the lower cloth donations first
---
In WotLK they made it so you're not allowed to advertise casino in public chats. As long as you keep it to yourselves, there's nothing wrong with it.
---
No. In dual wield you want to be heroic strike queueing.  It makes it so your white hits from your OH have the same party/miss/glancing blow penalty as yellow hits while the queue for hs is active.   Some warriors take it an extra step and do  heroic strike cancelling (queue then cancel before it goes off) but this is mechanically fairly difficult and if you fuck up can actually drop dps.  
---
All of this added up means more Rage and more Rage means you let Heroic Strike go through more often. This also means that your main hand attacks now carry that same 9% base miss rate and will not be Glancing Blows.
---
Altogether, you increase your DPS a lot and this is why parses will show more Heroic Strikes.
---
 Warriors are a bit of a feedback loop. More rage leads to more dps leads to more rage.  If you get world buffs (highly recommend DM North/songflower/ony) plus normal raid consumables, shit just starts to scale like mad which is why you see some of these warriors all over the top of the parse lists on Warcraft logs.
---
I honestly don't know how "any event invovering wagering on the outcome" and "whether or not such conduct constitutes gambling under law" could be any more clear, lawyer or not.
---
Dear God don't use this line... You will never turn wow or raids into something sexy. Mention if you really want to but don't try to push it as if it's something amazing.
---
They will be banned in the next wave of they are truly bots.
---
Don't tell grizzly
---
Only fights that may require an mp5 set would be Chromaggus and Nefarian. A fight like Razorgore is long but is not super mana intensive. Chromaggus is highly mana intensive depending on your dispelling duties,and Nefarian - at least during your first clears - can be a bit hectic so the healing isn’t as efficient as it could be.
---
Remindme! 1 day
---
I wouldn’t spend much at all. It took me a week of dedicated farming to get ores and stone, and I bought a few assorted items on the AH. Saved a lot of money doing it myself and probably only spent 30g on the AH for cheap thorium. 
---
Also on Thunderfury
---
Yeah, it's a function of the queue timers more than anything. Horde can't even premade, but Alliance can. If you have a Horde pug vs Ally pug then the Horde group will probably have more geared ppl/tryhards because all the Alliance tryhards will be queueing together, leaving Alliance pugs short of tryhards. If Horde had insta queue I promise the same exact thing would inevitably happen
---
1:30 is me ariving and trying to explain boss tactics as raid leader
---
Sup brother it's Justin, grats to your guild
---
Not to argue here, but Hunter is much more difficult than what you describe. To tell you the truth, it’s probably the easiest to get started but third hardest to master (Druid and Warrior being the hardest).
---
Managing to clip/not clip your bow rotation while making sure your pet doesn’t die in AoE is quite a tedious task. We also have to kite some mobs, which isn’t that hard but still feels harder than DOTS + Shadowbolts.
---
I played enough of WoW to back my statement. I think SPriest, Warlock and Paladins are all easier to play than Hunter. Never tried Shamans tho...
---
Crazy how some people don't know that
---
Can confirm, the ah sapper nukes were the final straw.
---
S priest gets 10% from talents so we just need 6%. With mysteria and banthok we only need 4% left
---
You know what they say about big raids.
---
ability to make goblin sapper charges yourself instead of buy them + everlook teleport vs, gnomish bops and gadgetzan teleport. your choice.
---
I tried to look up once awhile back for a bit program just to see how easy it was to obtain one and I could never really find much reliable information on it. Seemed like too much work.
---
Nope sorry
---
My guild on Horde side has been using it and it works just takes a few queues. Almost always get a few people in the same one though!
---
What do those quests give you?
---
Well I meant with the ring in the mail ya know
---
It is when it dissapears after 500 damage which is one hit at 60. Then its just a waste of a slot for the rest of combat.
---
If you never learn gnomish, you will miss out on Death Ray and Battle Chicken. If you never learn goblin, you will miss out on Bomb Dispencer and Dragon Gun (and mining helmet if you care for that).
---
Additionally, staying as goblin allows you to craft sapper charges (which there's always a demand for) and reload the mortar trinket.
---
If that's the case, it sounds like those flights weren't really that fair, were they?
---
I killed a 60 rogue last night as a 38 rogue in Stv.. CS into kidney shot, blind and gnomish desth ray, vanish-cheap shot he was ded
---
I highly doubt you can restore the items, as they weren't just "thrown away", they went to other players.
---
Lots of AC preface discord’s (at least alliance side) this means if they don’t have at least 25 they will ditch the q leaving the pugs empty
---
How much does thunderfury cost approximately?
---
Your holy light (rank 8) is typed wrong.
---
Its holy light(rank 8). Easiest way to get it right is to open your spellbook while in your macro and shift-click the correct rank spell into the macro instead of typing it in.

Only ones that really need FR are the tanks. Ony cloak for everyone else for those certain fights.

That was the rate with 10 minute wins. Gonna be more now
---
City rep.  Or you could just do turn-ins in AV for free...
---
I actually can, 15 resists of curse of shadows in a row[ljbk](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/mQvgIJN)
---
No no, I've gotten wrecked while carrying the flag while the shadowpriest on my team gets the berserker buff and casts minflay.
---
More like 1:45
---
Yes, the opening week and to some extent the following week were very skewed be rep grinders. This is great for hardcore rankers because there were more bracket spots, but awful for average people trying to rank up.
---
Oh ty
---
I have around 30 :p

Shadow priests get 10
---
Probably a lot of horde were afk and missed their queue. Times are getting extremely long now.
---
There is a big difference between a company having actual customers and a not-so-legal group providing a service for free to random users. Even legally.
---
Exactly. We're not that hard to kill, if our initial burst fails or there's too many targets we're basically sitting ducks, especially vs Fearers.
---
I'm not even giving the other dude a response though...his replies speak for themselves and show he's not going to be swayed, he'll just dismiss any point you make, as his reply to you already shows. Just another "ALTERNATE PLAYSTYLE BAD" sheep
---
There is no better gif to describe that
---
Ah, thanks for heads up. So it would seem that the change actually brings the mechanics back in line to where they were during Vanilla?
---
Nah man, those minor stat increases from the headpiece have a much bigger impact on pvp than several hard cc and movement tools that outperform a bunch of unique class skills while having zero mana costs tied to them. /s
---
Or in blizzards timeline about 2.5 months 😀
---
Yep. Lost of misinformation a floating around from Vanilla being used as Classic info. Similar with Private Server shit being touted as gospel despite not being anywhere near to correct for Classic.
---
Thanks, never considered that. Off to farm more demonic runes. Merry Xmas!
---
Any other tips to boost DPS in raids feel free to dm me or post here, always looking for ways to improve.
---
When u put it like that.. it’s like they’re family hackers who actually want u to spend the holidays w family lol
---
Even then I know I can't win some matchups and just wait.
---
100 bars and 5.5 K?
---
Boots might barely edge out maliki's footwraps, but pvp helm/shoulders are bis.
---
I appreciate the complement! It is always too easy to fall into the trap of oversimplified rhetoric and I try my hardest not to. :)
---
I don't think it's "obviously if a player just logs their body will still show in the ground", because I think that is the reason their body vanish
---
I thought it was 1% = 26AP on hunters?
---
That's why he looks like a really bad bot.
---
R10 helm/shoulders are bis, they're actually a fair bit better than the epic ones since they have the spellpower two-piece bonus instead of stamina.
---
Ideally people would spread out and more if they can see what's already been reserved, more people would be able to get loot, only works if people aren't assholes trying to game the system, but those people get weeded out fast.
---
That's how I got into ZF as an undergeared rogue!
---
Well, the problem is that really good rewards are gated behind the honor system, so people aren't playing for fun or for wins, they're playing to maximize the efficiency of their time spent compared to other honor grinders. I have 4 people in my guild that sit in AV 18 hours a day, planning their trips to the store, showers, meals, etc. around the queue timer for AV. It's disgusting but it's what you legitimately have to do if you want rank 13/14
---
I like the background music in certain areas.  Also, playing without any sound at all would leave me concerned about not hearing sound effects designed to alert you to a hazard.
---
There are no obstacles to playing a video game, what are you talking about.  I turn the game on.  Way less effort than people getting off the couch and going outside to play a sport, if they can even play said sport in the first place.
---
In open world or in battlegrounds? Because im AV the body disapears after they get revived by the spirithealer
---
Then explain to me why sometimes I see a players dead body at the same spot like 5 hrs later, it’s because they logged when they died and their corpse is still lying there.
---
LMAO this is so hilarious taht you think you look good now. I guess playing wow 20 hours a day really does stunt your perception of normal behaviour. please keep embarrassing yourself my realm is loving this on discord :D
---
This is happening in the open world obviously.
---
Yes, albeit not fully. A lot in regard to the Combatlog and logging in general was changed back in BC+ and hasn't been reverted.
---
Tauren Mill? Sounds like beef mince is on the menu tonight!
---
hahhahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Good boy.
---
Now bark.
---
The sooner I kill that Scarlet Spellbinder, the dinner it will respawn somewhere else - regardless of who tagged it.
---
Carebear servers. Lol
---
Honest profiles ftw. Maybe you will hit it off with another lady raider. They do exist.
---
For me exiting my mouse software worked
---
Should we tell him boys?
---
bet you made a shitload of money opening for groups every day.  I used to charge 10g
---
That's how much the bars cost on my server
---
how much you make?
---
exactly
---
Multi boxing doesn’t work in BGs
---
Too an extent sgc too, although it's not 100% BiS, many warriors will use it until Naxx because of competiton for other chests and if they use DKP, it's one of the last pieces you care to replace, whilst hunters get geared quick and want to use full tier 1 anyways.
---
Nothing sad about it. 
---
You simply don’t get in someone’s face irl and insult them. Which is what the person, that I was responding to, was inferring. 
---
Sadly for him though, if you run around insulting people, outside of moms basement, they may put you down. 
---
If you yelled that insult at them, to their face, at a distance of less than about 10 feet, they can usually legally respond by putting you down. 
---
So. Again. It’s odd to pretend that anti-social behavior is something that will be tolerated.
---
Same thing happened to me twice while farming the bugged crocs in the river between Durotar and Barrens, I logged to an alt for a few minutes and when I checked again it was fine.
---
I’ve ran LBRS like 15 times and have only seen one gem and the other guy got it. This game is amazing.
---
If wow is an important hobby to you which you hope any future relationships will respect, yes.
---
I include folk stuff and DnD on mine. But I'm gay, so maybe women are a different species from men?
---
Odd. Works for me with dragonling and barovs, but you have to move in pretty close to get them to aggro.
---
Hey king, it's me Volkmar. Miss you, stay well my child.
---
As a user, I lose interest with generic bios or if conversation is hard. I like users being open about their passions.
---
You should see firemaw, bracket 1 is 1,5 mil honor, i got 350k last week and went from 70% rank 2- 50% rank 3. Its impossible to rank unless you have no job and just do av 18 hrs a day. Lots have transferred to smaller servers for easier ranking
---
All my Horde AV's are amazing showcases of communication. We have people constantly making calls and players willing to actually listen and follow these calls. Alliance seems to fall apart completely after their first initial attempt.
---
Multibox assholes need to be met with swift lifetime bans
---
We search more for Shaman heals than Priest heals. Arguably Shaman heals are the most sought after class on my server.
---
Cool guess.
---
No you can smelt to 187 I think
---
Laintime the absolute madlad.
---
Offensively it's correct that they are sidegrades, but OFH gives more armor, stamina and intellect so it's clearly the better chest piece of the two.
---
There's so much misinformation and confusion in this post.  
---
First point, I don't know why this happened.  I've done a lot of AV.  Like way too much.  I've never seen this happen.  I don't honestly believe the "it never filled" part of the title.  After they lose their queue it will populate the rest of the group unless there's a different bug I'm not aware of.
---
Second point, horde is slowly started to attempt organized AV queues, but it is far less reliable than alliance for obvious reasons.  You can't just spam repeat, so nobody is going to drop a queue because a threshold wasn't hit.  They'll accept and just be happy with however many they get.  Or they won't even try like the majority of horde players.
---
3rd point, the queue cheesing that everyone is talking about works on WSG and doesn't work on AV.  So claiming that their AV didn't fill because of it is 100% ignorance.  I have no idea why they even used the word streamer to be honest.
---
I'm running the numbers on downranking to rank 7, it seems to be a slight average DPS improvement over rank 10 due to not being oom.
---
Your comment makes me think, I should also test the combination of rank 4 + rank 10 vs just using rank 7. Maybe that's even better.
---
Dont listen to these idiots. 
---
You can restore a deleted character with all the items you Vendored but not the gold you gave away. Open a ticket and a GM will sort it out for you.
---
On my server they go for 300g.
---
&gt; it works just takes a few queues
---
So it only takes an hour to queue?
---
Why?  What could you possibly still be doing in vanilla wow by 2021?
---
In battle net there should be a drop down menu that you change to classic. Haven’t had to do it since launch but I remember having to change a setting in the launcher.
---
but horde premade with 15-25 minute queue? I don’t know, I tried 4 days from AV launch on to get into a game with some friends and it never worked.
---
Such a christmas troll
---
Like 4k on incindious. 
---
Ask guildies for their CD can save a ton but the mats are still a lot.
---
Which discord’s are the best for guild recruitment? Benediction realm
---
Just came here to say imagine being this wrong
---
That's under the heading Prohibited Commercial Uses, you numpty. Unless your mom accepts WoW gold for your rent it doesn't apply.
---
Ah yes, let's respond with violence to someone speaking. That's a perfectly normal reaction. Legally? What sad country do you live in?
---
It’s odd to pretend that violent behavior is something that will be tolerated. Ever.
---
Nice Hollow knight helm!
---
Is that a Blade runner vinyl?
---
...I want your stuff. Lol
---
This
---
Yup nothing works
---
Circlejerk title, bro this only works in WSG, you can’t queue up as a group for AV.
---
Looking for a BiS lady
---
That's not really what your link says though.  It's worded ambiguously.  It just says you don't get honor from kills.  What about bonus honor, which is a huge portion of your honor if you rank in AV?
---
Less XP per kill, but better XP/ hr if you are clearing the dungeon in 10-15 minutes using aoe damage.
---
Come at me, bro
---
Been like this for 24hrs
---
There's a drop down towards the bottom that has a selector. At least on my version.
---
You can't be serious. No player would simply help kill mobs (random nagas in Azshara, nothing special) that another person tagged first over and over, while not responding to messages.
---
This is dumb logic.  They don’t care if the money comes from retail or Classic.  They will follow the money.  If Shadowlands comes out and wholly shits the bed, but phase 3 sees record subs... guess what?  They might let retail die and start over with Classic+.  There’s no predicting, but you can take 1 thing to the bank:  money is king.
---
In a lootcouncil guild with the longterm in mind, TOEP goes to warlocks because they replace it in Naxx whereas mages will replace it with BWL gear (tear + MQG).  
---
For the other pieces, ring of SP would go to mage, MIC to mage (both because warlock get similar or better from BWL in the shadow ring from trash and the t2 belt, as well as how much sash will drop from domo and will otherwise go to waste), ROVP to warlock (bis till ZG whereas mages get archmage which is comparatively stronger than robe of the void), rag choker and lockblade goes to best deserving between mage/lock (no prio).  Cannot remember what other key items there are right now.
---
Personally, I had 1000g and brought one for 650g (retail was 800g at that time), it really isn’t worth it for just a little more spell power.
---
I get the reddit-tier skepticism of the issue, but take a look at the market on any populated server, who's selling the items, and take a look at popular farming spots. There's massive issues with bots, and your galaxy-brain approach to a simple problem is pretty annoying and counterproductive, quite frankly.  
---
The fact that you haven't observed this in the wild on your own, and instead are coming here to critique and question what is blatant for no reason other than mental masturbation is pretty good evidence that you're far more retarded than you think you are.
---
sure.
---
Requires them to hop out of cat form, and the banshees put it up often
---
Go gnomish and buy the sappers. The chicken is just too good and sappers are now much less necessary now that BGs are out. 
---
Really it's worth it to just relevel it. Depends on your sever, but buying all the mats to hit 250 again is only like 100g on mine. If you use 50ish sappers in the next 2 years youve spent more than you saved by not relearning
---
People that like to shout that the hunter rotation is easy have probably never played a hunter seriously, because the timing requires a LOT more careful consideration than frostbolt/shadowbolt/SS+SnD spam
---
But once u figure it out, it’s a walk in the park
---
Nah bro it's basically just a dps cheque
---
&gt; as people who want to hit R14 have no way of doing it legitimately.
---
You can wait your turn.  It's insanity to think you can compete with the first wave, who will do whatever possible to stay ahead.  Nobody is entitled to ranking.  My server for example right now.  Standing 1 is almost double the honor of standing 15.  You literally have to no life, and find an exploit to compete.
---
This happens when they log onto another character. Not simply logging out. You can test this yourself if you’re curious.
---
Slam abuse spec sounds great. I want a reason to get good 2h for pvp
---
Well it kinda depends on what kind of pvp you’re after. If it’s the current AV your gear is alright as it is, but if you’re going for WSU for real pvp you should swap to the necro set.
---
A few easy upgrades: 
---
Wand from elite quest in EPL 
---
Gloves/belt from domo (belt might be hard) 
---
Try and get t1 head and shoulders
---
For $25 yeah
---
That's not how the law works, not even in USA lmao. Sure, beat the shit out of someone who calls you a cum sock. That'll end well, totally not with you in jail.
---
Merry Christmas, weirdo.
---
Pretty much anything in classic is a walk in the park once you figure it out.
---
Or, you know, find someone who shares your interests and who would find that joke funny. If you need to be all serious and hide your real interests to meet someone, you're doing it wrong and it wont last
---
No AV offhand.  What a noob ;)
---
You should at least be upfront and honest about your hobbies, she may be into it too, or she at least won't judge you for your interests
---
I remember getting to the gates had my laptop freeze. But once everything loaded I was at a cool 15 fps.
---
Would it be dumb to put the +100 health enchant on the lionheart helm to make it a more viable PvP item?
---
Did you really have to fucking sign this?
---
To be honest, I get really turned on by watching my bf play, the way his fingers move across the keyboard is mesmerizing 😏
---
Ok, have fun then when you realize tank agro doesn't scale 100% with damage and your DPS have unlimited resources and no threat meter installed and they can already pull off the tank.  While DPS threat does scale 100% damage based, healers are dropping max rank heal bombs for 4k non stop every couple seconds with limitless Mana and an entire raid taking 600 fire damage every 3 seconds.   But by all means, it's "JuSt A dPs ChEcK".   
---
This sub is going to be some amazing drama when it drops.
---
I think you will only attract girls who play WoW or like so your dating pool will be almost non existent
---
If you're proud enough of it to want to put it in your bio, it's probably a big enough part of your personality that you wouldn't want the kind of girl that would turn you away for it anyway. Put that shit in there, king. Tell her you're keyed and ready to go. Just make sure you switch to prot before things get too serious
---
if youre ugly thats a downside (as everything else except wealth), if youre handsome - everything goes, even an unemployed reptiloid overlord
---
Hah reminds me of reading Masters of Doom, Carmack, Romero and the other iD guys were so into D&amp;D they posted "wanted: players for D&amp;D" posters around their town, and the name of Quake is from one of the characters in their D&amp;D campaign!
---
It really gets on my nerves when people try to associate rank with skill.
---
Why is the Necro set better for WSG? I tried to calculate the stats, and it seemed lower than the one in the gear planner.
---
Depends on your guilds mindset. Many aren’t just playing for the current content but to set themselves up to be as successful as possible in later content.
---
And yes, later content can be completed with basically any composition. However, certain comps will have significantly easier times.
---
So your raid should be whatever the fuck the guild as a whole wants, not one individual person.
---
Anyone having issues with opening your bags with the Bagon add-on?
---
I created an alt today and I can't seem to open my bags at all. Works fine on my main but not on any other new characters that I make.
---
You might want to consider focusing on impulse control in the future.
---
Ewwwww
---
The hit has about 11 SP worth of value in sims at current gear/buffs.
---
I also will always fight back too, but gnomish death ray can enable a 19 twink to kill a fresh 60. It's practically cheating, it can do 2k+ crits.
---
LMFAO NO
---
What server you on?
---
or, unless you’re tryna to “Smash,” leave that shit in..  sure you’ll bump into a gamer girl that’s a kirby main or something
---
Aww, I only gave her the Slimy Old Bone.
---
Oh, I would definitely act like a human, usually emote at them or something. And I'm a mouse Turner, so that's def not bit behavior. But also things respawn faster if I help kill them faster.
---
NO! For God's sake don't wait!
---
SELL IT NOW!!!
---
Which spec you planning on?
---
not really sure how to break this to you but the other classes don’t get much more complex.  this isn’t necessarily a bad thing about the game, but the truth.  if you’re looking for complexity of rotation at endgame you chose the wrong phase of wow
---
Oh I get it.
---
Spelling a bad word on the ground with dead bodies or skeletons.
---
Yeah, I just meant that we don’t offensively use arcane missles etc
---
Atiesh
---
Not a dick, but what is this spec sounds interesting
---
This game isn’t hard enough for any spec to matter tbh.
---
I'm curious as well. Go ahead and link to the video.
---
My man there's not a single class or spec in the game that can't use nades in pvp. Or deathrays. Or the battle chicken (which I expect would be disgustingly powerful at 49). I could go on.
---
Our raid has 6 mages usually. But nothing has dropped for us in 3 weeks.
---
Hasn't been fun.
---
Merry Christmas!
---
Unless someone from your server on your faction had made the guide literally today it would be nearly 100% useless.
---

---
Worth it to level twice but if you rly don't want to go gnome. Deathray too fun
---
Super easy if ele/resto. Not only do you get mail for free, you also only have Druids to compete with for caster/healer leather. Enhance is difficult unless you convince the raid to let you be the Nightfall Shaman since you have rogues, warriors and hunters all going for a lot of the same overlaped gear.
---
Log off and spend time with family
---
I think casters prefer stacking int and stam for PvP as opposed to +spell damage
---
Try getting every pattern for lw/Engi - when I was in your situation I leaned enchanting and tried to get every formula available. That's expensive.
---
Nothing resembling mage gear has dropped for our raid in 3 weeks. Haven't seen a mageblade drop at all.
---
Our locks/rogues/shamans/hunters are fully geared.
---
One mage has more warlock pieces for the lolz than he has epics.
---
It's been rough.
---
Could you just use greater fire pots?
---
Wow thats some indepth explaining. I agree with most of it, allthough i specced shadow for most of my vanilla and classic time i still think that if you want to contribute to ur team shadow aint the way, and ofc he aint speaking about premade and stuff but when i join a pug wsg and i'm the only class capable of casting a heal i wont stay in shadowform. You are dispelling and throwing a shield here and there when ur in a group anyway. You can "melt" faces those 1v1 or even 1v2 with some pvp engi help but getting wrecked every wsg isnt my way of have a good time in battlegrounds.
---
It's not her bis. It's a level 55 green to her.
---
How do multiboxers doing all that? I saw a video some months ago where the player even had voice commands for his 15+ hunters, and an impressive battle station. :)
---
How does someone get into that? Just one input/keystroke and if anything is out of sync they have to tab between there session like a mad man...
---
Wait... Don't tell me... Are you a darkie??
---
Took me about 12 hours over opening weekend. Probably will be closer to 24 hours now.
---
Corpse disappear when they log out as ghost - reappears when they log back in, observed it myself in p2
---
Even better... are you a diaper head darkie?
---
it's only wrong if you enchance shammy
---
1/1.25
---
We play that game in our guild chat. I just sit there polishing my Shiny Dirk
---
Do it
---
I passed on it and helped people grind for it 3 times.  2 weeks ago I decided to switch to fury Prot which means I needed HoJ and I regretted not taking it because of how much trouble it was getting it this time around . Enjoy it
---
Warrior. I bounce between arms for PvP and fury for PvE.
---
On the server Ashkandi, it took just about 150 Gold both times I leveled from 1 - 300.
---
3 comments at a time now wow i really hurt you
---
That's true, but it highly depends on the server and is very random in pvp servers. My server is one of the worst - so using "pve server" as a filter for easier than the worst pvp is my best chance of finding ones.
---
Well, maybe. He could also have wanted gems. 
---
I know that for me personally, I knew I was gonna do a bunch of LBRS runs for gems, reiver claws, and ribsteel. So I skipped DM East entirely and I ended up with Blackcrow and Riphook, as well as my UBRS key.
---
I was like 700 after 350k honour
---
Answer is no. I did this and couldn’t even just get my carrot on a stick back :/ get to it brother!
---
Bad way to earn gold, and you will probably run out of mana quicker than it to be worth it (if you can kill the mobs)
---
You are better off just aoe leveling to 40 if thats what you want, you will be loaded before you hit 40
---
Answer the question. Are you a towel head?
---
surely there’s no way they “accidentally” turned it on
---
Using the stuck option thing should work, my brother had this issue on one of the first days
---
Found the guy who DOESNT tank.
---
This is indeed weird. What server?
---
Blizzard should really  be using feature flags ;)
---
submit a ticket, a gm apparently has to manually fix this
---
I've never seen the party leader swap layers and am not able to test myself. Not proof imo.
---
Not being Prot I’d assume you want Str, but I don’t play Warr.
---
Hollow knight is such an amazing game
---
As a warrior tank leveling my 2nd tank, a paladin, it always baffles me how many groups are "LF1M tank" when they have an arms or fury warrior or a feral druid.
---
Just do what you're doing in Battle Stance in Defensive Stance instead. And equip a shield if you overpull.
---
Hunters will buy it for the bow quest if they do the warlock curse method.
---
I had the opposite experience. I went there Christmas day at like 3:20 pm server time, thinking i was definitely too late. Nope, it was still there and i got it :)
---
I logged out, thinking i’d get the 6:00 one too, but sadly there was a party of 3 guys on it when i logged on at that time
---
I'm guessing but maybe if they have somekinda live ready to go backup server maybe it could switch on by accident? Idk its weird
---
You gay*
---
As stated for the 1,000th time bots get banned in waves. This tinfoil hat Alex Jones flat earth theory shit about Blizz allowing bot because they want money shit needs to stop.
---
We run 5 offspecs. Works fine. More is too much carry.
---
You deserved it lmao
---
Wow, you’re a shitty human being.
---
Suspending over afk is different then Botting because they can just analysed their game log.
---
With bots, pattern recognition come into play and it's just longer / harder to automate while being 100% right.
---
My guild is cheap and sells all the non bis pieces so most people won't get 8/8 in our guild
---
That's so fucking funny
---
I finaly got it last week,i don’t read books ever but  what an amazing read.
---
You rank against other players of your faction on your server. You decided to grind av the first weekend it came out, the same weekend that literally every other person decided to grind av for their rep, so you didn't pull ahead of anyone realistically.
---
You didn’t answer me.
---
What sad country are you in, where it’s considered “speaking” to insult a stranger to their face.
---
If someone walked up to my face, that I didn’t know, and angrily called me a cum sock, again that would be considered assault. I would be allowed to respond in kind. 
---
Keep pretending otherwise though I guess.
---
#nochanges
---
Weirdly, they spawn a few feet/metres backwards in a line from the GY each time you kill them.
---
You wrote "Holy light (rank 8)", which the same will read as just "Holy Light", which will use the highest rank.   
---
You don't want a space there. so "Holy Light(rank 8)". ALso no need for Holy light after #showtooltip
---
\#Showtooltip
---
/cast \[modifier:alt\] Holy Light(rank 8) \[@mouseover,exists\] holy light(rank 8);
---
Also make sure the alt/shift/ctrl binding is not bound to something else, like another action bar. So if you got the macro on "3", make sure Shift-3, Alt-3, Ctrl-3 isn't used by anything if you are using mod.
---
What do you do with 21 accounts?  Being serious.  Do you farm gold and it pays for accounts plus a medium profit?  It’s not like you can solo Ony with 20 shamans
---
Ahh I see. Would SOSW be better on say a shadow priest vs banthok considering with talents they only need 6% hit to cap?
---
Yeah I just have no interest in wasting time playing rock paper scissors. I love group pvp but when I'm starting half dead without all my cool downs then I'd rather not waste more time trying to overcome it. Unless it's a rogue when I'm on my warrior. They deserve to be 3-shot just for the *audacity* to think they could kill a warrior.
---
Maybe they're going to layer together dead servers?
---
I have legitimately not noticed one bot. Maybe I don't pay enough attention, I dunno, but not one single time have I thought "that's a bot." Literally not once in Classic.
---
I see 2 of my guildees
---
If they had made such a monumental change to how layering works, they should announce it.   
---
Also, layering just for capital cities is pretty moot, as the only thing it does is make them feel empty again. I enjoy seeing 30-50 people between IF Bank and AH. There's absolutely nothing contested in these cities that's worth layering, the only thing it affects is Onyxia head buff.
---
That's a very good question, but as was pointed out, that doesn't look like how layering worked. There's two things wrong here: you swap into her layer, and the swap happens before she even joins the group. Of course it could be some bug related to layering, but if layering had just been re-enabled, it wouldn't look like this. :S
---
&gt; That's under the heading Prohibited Commercial Uses
---
That doesn't mean what you think it means. 
---
&gt; here is the blue post on casinos
---
Gambling rules all over the industry has changed a lot in the last decade, have you been living under a rock? The WoW EULA from that era literally doesn't even exist anymore.
---
Yes it fucks up trading with people as you have to invite them to your party to get you to both into the same layer.
---
That's why I said in my current gear. I'm not quite in full BiS but I'm pretty close. Obviously the guy above me has no clue about how it works or he'd thow out some qualifier. Do you really think the guy above me was talking about in naxx gear?
---
Use it enough it'll turn purple.
---
Check out the price of Swiftthistle on your server. I'm pretty sure that's one of the best goldfarming methods at your level. Probably in the range of 5-10 gold per hour.
---
My live-in girlfriend and I have opposite schedules, I work 40-50 hours a week. I could easily have 3 60s, but then again I don't have kids. I spend a lot of time out with friends for dinner/drinks.  All in all though I have to agree that this man probably could fuck more.
---
Just came here to say its legit dogshit
---
Yes, if you have the rage.  Also, cleave queueing works the exact same way.  So if you are ever cleaving bosses (Lucifron/Gehennas/Sulferon/Domo) definitely go that route as well.
---
You can kind of get an idea if you loot at the casts of top fury DPS wars on boss fights.  You'll see they cleave queue on multi mob bosses, but HS queue on single target fights.  Many of them also hamstring spam to fish for extra windfury proc.

It might take a little while to figure out, but once you get it down you'll notice your increase in DPS.
---
Well no competition for mail gear. Should be easy enough assuming raid has few shamans and gear actually drop.
---
i’m a girl and i’d 10/10 swipe right on raid leading

Gonna miss you guys when we turn into Flamelash NA. ):

Ah, RNG. 2 pairs of T1 gloves dropped, and only one belt.

Not all bots are farmers, some are levelling bots

Mind gem quickening*
---
There would be arbitrage.
---
I would just stand there and /sigh at them
---
Str for PvE dps for sure. The question is if I want to use my lionheart as a long term PvP helm as well, in which case the 100 health would be ideal. 
---
The more I look at it, it might be better to just wait until I get a might or wrath helm and use that for PvP instead, and just use lionheart for PvE dps
---
There's currently another post about layering on the subreddit, also Lakeshire.
---
Seems like it's a server specific bug.
---
Sorry, but it looks like a kid made it.
---
I agree. My mage is at 47 now. Open world aoe leveled from 22 to now. Started zf grave farming at 44, gets easier with every level and experience at it. Just focus on leveling and gold will come. You can farm zf for xp and gold for a solid 10 levels...
---
fuck multiboxers
---
Wait.. you gave a character with your actual name?
---
What's tauren mill???
---
Yes
---
Look at item drop rates on wowhead or AtlasLoot. RNG can be a bitch, or you can luck out. Then it all depends on number of shamans in your raids/guild, and the loot system. 
---
The bad thing is that in terms of +healing/mp5, Tier pieces are pretty crap until you get the 5 and 8 bonuses. Much worse in all aspects except for the +stats.
---
Healing mace will be heavily contested (shamans/druids), Rag shield wanted by every shaman, rings, amu and Only trinket wanted by every healer out there.
---
One of the few times horde can actually win! (I'm horde, btw.)
---
If we used basic critical thinking skills this thread wouldn’t exist.
---
Threat is a genuine concern for raid tanks in this expansion.  Does it help warrior tanks as much as it does for druid tanks?  (The free hit is a maul if the base hit was because of batching)
---
You are fun at parties I bet.
---
No
---
I play on Kurrinax. Were pretty equal ratios. Before BGs you could not go into WPL or EPL because alliance camped the entire zone. They'd even roam corners so you couldn't even grind in a random spot. But yes ratios on a lot of servers ruined pvp, but that's nothing to do with a solution to the problem. People being honor hungry isn't a reason to let the game die... It's a dick move, but its literally a war game you're supposed to slaughter the other side. Camping them in town is stupid, but it is what it is.
---
Are you new or something? It's a well established fact and I'm not about to waste my time explaining it to you, just like I won't argue with people that ask for reasons the Earth is round.
---
The only edits I made on my original comment were to correct autocorrect errors from typing on my phone.
---
It's been proven multiple times, have you never changed zones with someone and had them lag out? Have you not pvped across zone boundaries and had them disappear momentarily? This didn't happen in vanilla or bc (my frame of reference for old wow), and it's related to sharding from the legion client.
---
See my above reply.
---
Allies can reliably get into the same AV when queuing together, that just does not work at all on Horde side due to queue times. Synchronized queuing with 10 people spreads you very likely over 10 battlegrounds. 
---
I understand that the queue times are favoring alliance now, and that's okay. If I had known how imbalanced servers would be, I'd have rolled alliance, but now it is how it is. However the entire point of battlegrounds is a fair game, unlike open world PvP, and right now that is just not the case in AV. In WSG, the answer to "boohoo I lose against premades" is "make your own premade", this option is just not there for Horde in AV.
---
Dont
---
Very helpful thank you. Why not? It wouldn't hurt anything alliance would still have instant que and horde que time will significantly decreases.
---
Alliance do it too if they have the numbers - it’s not a faction thing that makes players dickheads, it generally just happens if one side dominates the other. 
---
What this guy is proposing will solve a huge problem for horde queuing into BGs even if it is against the classic spirit. 
---
Just because he happens to be on a faction with dickheads, does not mean he is a dick who camped flight masters. He should not be punished for others actions.
---
Ok than I just read too fast. Thanks for your thoughts on the topic.
---
Doesn't it say your AV # when it asks you to "Enter Battle?" Couldn't they just hit hide until enough of them got into the same one?
---
Might be worth it to reroll onto alliance if you like pvp. It’s counter intuitive but I rolled alliance for classic because I like pvp and knew I’d have instant queues.
---
Okay
---
I did some bg-s and I found myself running out of mana very quickly.
---
How should I weigh spirit 1/6? 1/8?
---
And TBH, 15 all resi does not sound that good. No one really deals Fire, Arcane, or Nature DMG from Alliance, so its basically just Shadow and Frost.
---
Just download clique bro
---
Not with this attitude
---
You vendor the weapons and DE the non weapon greens.
---
it is christmash after all!
---
6% hit though you will get more hit than needed. Some items will give you hit and crit or hit + AP/AGY and they are better than other items.
---
I’ve seen some other clips of it too now, thanks.
---
&gt;It's been proven multiple times
---
No it hasn't, because shards and layering aren't the same thing. There are no shards in classic.
---
Those things happen. And don't call me Surely.
---
Probably couldn't hurt
---
You're trying to hard.  Be confident in yourself.  Chicks dig that.  Seriously
---
lol.  I glanced and saw Christsmash.  Won’t even start on that visual lmao
---
&gt;Data is *also* synced across raid and guild chats, so that adds an extra level of pressure onto the chat servers
---
Not sure if you're aware but this is 2019, not 1996, there are servers that can deal with gigabits at a time, the data is being synced through text which is basically nothing in comparison to actual player data, every player on the game is paying **at least** 12 dollars a month (assuming the user buys the $77 6 month plan), this means **worst case scenario for blizzard** they get $60,000 every month, that is way way way more than enough to pay for high quality servers.
---
I recommend you at least do basic research on how much data most modern servers can handle before advocating for the removal of an addon.
---
They added this to retail?
---
Maybe it has something to do with the DDOS yesterday?
---
Then you can explain why allies and enemies disappear when changing zones, which didn't happen back in the day?
---
Works for the ony off hand and you can do it in combat
---
Only being in combat and getting hit
---
Oh? Healed most of vanilla in full mail, never had a problem, same in following expansions. Guess classic got harder.
---
And yet every single experienced player I've seen advised to stay away from fury prot early on (full blues is early on) and when people did actual tests the full blues fury prot was worse than a deep prot or a feral.
---
Fury prot scales better than deep prot but it's not a beast in pre-raid bis. Being a fury prot in full blues is one of the worst thing you can do as a tank.
---
I'm probably gonna try both, wanna see which fits my playstyle more.
---
Gotta pass on the raid items though, I got no chance on those.
---
In your opinion, how many stamina equals spell dmg? 4=5? 4=6?
---
Additionally I would like to add that death ray isn’t amazing for most classes but on classes like paladin and rogue where you have a good combo into it they’re great so I would highly recommend doing gnomish first then relearning you goblin once you get the toys.
---
It does say so, yes. If you don't react to it within 1.5 min (or 1:45, can't recall) you are removed from the queue. If 20 people queue at the same time, wait for 15+ minutes and get different AV numbers and choose to re-queue, that is another 15+ min spent with the hope of maybe getting into the same one withiut any guarantees - I don't know about you, but the word I'd use to describe that is 'idiocy'. 'pointless' also comes to mind. The queue time makes it non-feasible.
---
there seems to be a bug with the loot system but only that its happening to me, some items the window doesnt pop up so i can choose whether to greed or need it just automatically selects greed. how can i fix this?
---
steady regression continues, were in the good part now
---
Yes. You can go to dalaran sewers and swap factions to que. As a horde queing as alliance you even get their call to arms buff.
---
You’re on a subreddit about a thing and you’re surprised that people posting on it are doing the thing?
---
How would you like it if people visited r/needlesstrolling and told you to turn off your phone and celebrate Christmas instead of being an unbearable knob?
---
isboxer allows broadcast of certain key combinations to other clients. so if you press shift+1 on one client it could shift+1 on every client.
---
other tricks are "repeaters" which allow you to broadcast mouseclick commands only when they are in a specific portion of the screen. so for example I mirror my healer's raidframes to a region on my main client, I can specifically mouseclick on that region to heal (I assigned all heals with relevant downranks to my mouse buttons, I literally do not map 1-9 on my priest a lot of the time. thats an underrated challenge of multiboxing, you have much less keybinds per char to work with)
---
Why you didn’t pick alliance if you play for PvP? It was clear they have better q times from the beginning
---
I tried this in AV before engaging Balinda, but unless the chicken was right next to Bal, the chicken would not attack. Unfortunately I dont think I could get that close to a raid boss without getting in combat.
---
Blaumeux is a solid, pretty even PVP server based on west coast. I recommend it. When the first census data came out it was the most balanced server, with almost a perfect 50/50 ratio of alliance to horde. I think it has since changed but not by much.
---
I wanted a shaman and all my friends are playing horde. 1-60 is a long grind too again I don't have time. If they had paid level 60 boost once you had a level 60 I may do that. But I doubt they'll add it.
---
What I’m saying is that there are very few actual mail pieces outside of the tier that drop in raid currently.
---
Lol you are shitting us. Hell no. Why would you think that turns women on?
---
It’s nothing I like in a mmo. This is not league of legends or something it’s about the war between horde and alliance and not between horde and horde etc. maybe switch games or reroll
---
All my friends play horde. And I like horde better. Alliance doesnt interest me.
---
It is most likely about betting on matches. If you try to take it so literally, it can be applied way too broadly.
---
Your guild should get one sham to 8/8, one or two to 3 t2, and the rest in high +healing gear. That's ideal past AQ.
---
They already have it in the game in retail so that's a horrible excuse.
---
yea i think that’s your best bet tbh
---
Yet you still fail to see why making that comment to someone sharing the gift they received is downright churlish... On Christmas. Sorry for sounding patronizing, but can we have one day a year we can be nice to people? I'll leave it there, enjoy the rest of your holidays.
---
Is Stalagg really that bad? Are any alliance pvp servers thriving? Is there a way to see the current census or active players?
---
Nice collection
---
I have 4/5 necropile (no luck with the mantle so far) and dreadmist head. I like to do wsg so my focus is with raw stats, stam&gt;int&gt;spell dmg&gt;spirit.
---
My experience is pve spell dmg, pvp raw stats.
---
Well yeah.. they are in the same guild and do battlegrounds together.
---
Hello,
---
Can you send me the link for the video explaining how to farm DM:N ? 
---
I've tried farming the lasher in DM:E and right now it's a little bit too hard considering my stuff :/
---
&gt;Allies can reliably get into the same AV when queuing together, that just does not work at all on Horde side due to queue times.
---
Yes this is because there are at least 3 horde for every 1 alliance. Being the on the side with 3 times as many players is usually an advantage however in this one specific case it's a disadvantage.
---
&gt;I understand that the queue times are favoring alliance now, and that's okay. If I had known how imbalanced servers would be, I'd have rolled alliance, but now it is how it is.
---
Not trying to pick on you but if you did literally any research even just a simple Google search of "which classic wow faction will be more popular" it would have told you horde will vastly outnumber ally on almost every server. 
---
&gt;However the entire point of battlegrounds is a fair game, unlike open world PvP, and right now that is just not the case in AV. In WSG, the answer to "boohoo I lose against premades" is "make your own premade", this option is just not there for Horde in AV.
---
I disagree with your premise here, Bgs have never been balanced to be a 100% fair fight between the 2 factions. They are more fair then open world PvP but that's all. In the end it's still 40v40 you can organize your own bg once inside premades max out around 20 ppl only. The only reason ally can "premade" is because of the horde massively outnumber us you have only yourselves to blame.
---
Women like men who are confident in themselves and their hobbies. Go for it bro
---
I don't know the sims for shadow priest, but I'd guess sash is still better.
---
Layering like this is like blizz gaslighting us
---
Enjoy wiping in AQ and Naxx with that attitude.
---
Is that a thing? Is stalagg get merged?
---
she wasn't in the tram.
---
Yes!
---
Sulfuras is balanced, alliance and horde go back and forth
---
I’ve never tried to calculate it like that. I’ve always focused on getting the most stamina and intelligence as possible. I don’t find spell power to be that important as a shadow priest since your base damage is really good on its own. So the longer you can stay alive the more faces you can melt. 
---
But that’s just my preference
---
I got Captain Zvezdan's Lost Leg to give her, it'll summon my crew to help.
---
Warlock/druid is great. I did it as the lock with my own machinegun imp build. I was levelling from launch on a full server, so it made shadowburn necessary to get tags, and since it was a pvp server we wanted to be able to burn targets quickly too. The druid planned to play as insect swarm balance but played feral instead (moonfire to tag, then tank everything while the lock shadowbolts). It was a lot of fun, and the synergy between the two classes is high. The locks benefits so much from the hots working while the druid tanks and regens their mana in bear.
---
You say that like literally everyone else isn't just guessing when it drop...
---
A low pop server could theoretically be worse than high pop if there are lots of hardcore pvpers on it. And theoretically a high pop server could be extremely easy  if it’s all casuals and you can vault ahead of the majority of them.
---
But I think generally speaking, low pop servers make it easier to make arrangements (like grouping or staggering ranks / colluding). Since most hardcore rank grinders are engaged in that social element of the grind it probably does make low pop better. If you’re trying to get rank 8 or something it shouldn’t really matter.
---
don't need to chat to fish
---
You can know how many rank pts you need to get to the next rank, and also gauge where youd need to be to hit the bracket you need to get for it. The post is about missing the next rank by a slim margin, pumping wouldve helped.
---
This is because of alliance premades. When we decide not to take a game, it starts with like 40 horde to 10 alliance. Blizzard could fix this by allowing group queues, or nerfing the amount of honor that AV gives.
---
Well, I haven’t seen the so called “well-established facts”. All I see are both Alliance and Horde players saying the opposite faction is favoured, including you. You’re neither stating why nor providing any sources for your alleged facts - that Alliance is favoured. Yet you rudely dismiss a person that question your statement. Comparing flat-earther theories with AV balancing is almost as ridiculous as flat-earther theories in itself.
---
I could state my take on the pros and cons for both factions and which strategies are actually favourable for each faction. However, since you’re an expert or have access to these so called “well-established facts”, why don’t you share them first?
---
Which bosses do you need FR gear for?
---
&gt; With 8+ weaponskill, your hit needed is 5.x where X is a number which depend your skill. To be safe, you choose 6% hit.
---
jfc. SHOW ME A ITEM IN GAME THAT GIVES .x hit lmao. you are trying so hard to be smart that you are ending up looking dumb.
---
and the statement is considering you already have 305 skill CAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE REPLY WAS ABOUT. dont try to take shit out of context
---
Arcane is counterspell and polymorph. Grenades are fire.
---
Because it is vastly rushed compared to when it came out orginally. Guilds haven't had long enough time in mc to gear up all 40 raiders and some of us enjoy these progression of the server and we have seen DM rushed and added in ahead of schedule, we've also seen Bgs get rushed in and added ahead of schedule. When every new patch or update is pushed out way ahead of when it was scheduled people complain about it being rushed out because that's just factually what is happening....
---
in such guilds, they might also want casters to delay dropping it until a designated time.
---
Yes I did.
---
This. Be honest, be funny.
---
Had this couple of days back. Needed to wait some 30mins to get in
---
Eh if they’re gonna clear out BWL quickly it doesn’t matter, what else are they gonna spend gold on?
---
On the other hand if they need those spent resources on crutches for further progression.... oof
---
Delete and reroll seems like the only option
---
This is why I dont spend tons of gold on pots for mc.
---
My performance has nothing to do with my performance.
---
Thanks for your opinion
---
Ah the bigdick status of killing Ragnaros and getting good loot rolls
---
I definitely think the reason there are more Horde, at least in Classic, is due to the culture that emphasizes the OPness of Horde racials (whether or not it's true). 
---
I think there is actually good evidence for this from Vanilla WoW. During Vanilla, Alliance actually outnumbered Horde and this was prior to the prevelance of min/max culture. There was also a big spike in Horde players during BC when the Horde got access to a "pretty" humanoid race. It was only when min/max culture became prevelant and it became common knowledge that most cutting edge guilds were Horde that Horde became more popular. People just like to think that they are choosing the "strongest" race/faction.
---
**TL;DR:** Alliance was more popular before the prevelance of min/max culture, and Horde after it became prevelant. This leads me to believe that people actually prefer the "flavor" of Alliance but chose Horde once they got the idea that they were mechanically superior.
---
Wow community: there should be exclusive rewards that only the top players can attain through committed gameplay
---
Also wow community: pvp system is too hard, too much work, gatekeepered, I should get bis weapons without playing 19 hours a day.
---
The grass is always greener elsewhere eh? Why not just accept the existence of this ridiculously cutthroat competitive system and either participate in it knowing the deal, or settle for raid loot that’s slightly worse and infinitely more attainable?
---
Same thing worked for my Hammer of Expertise from the blacksmithing trinket, 3 hour cool down and the hammer lasted for an hour. Used to pop it before bed and then I'd have two hours of use when I logged in.
---
Precisely. This dude gets it.
---
Better idea take the queues and push it to Stormwind.
---
It’s the alliances problem now.
---
Can confirm its org rep. You get diminished of other about 30%. So I got 10 org 3 trolls (just got exalted as an orc with Darkspear Trolls for source)
---
Well, of course I know this meme. It already exists.
---
Wow looks like a fun community.
---
I hear you, but at least with most classes you can't have top DPS with one button on your bar. I would like at least two things to cast.
---
I wouldn't know about females, but *women* care about a lot of things besides physical attractiveness.
---
I’ve actually thought of an alliance pvp alt for fun but not sure what night elf class to play for pure pvp.
---
I’m gonna refer you to your own handle
---
Layering for specific zones already existed for years - it's called sharding. They created layering off the back of sharding for Classic.
---
Thats not how it goes.... Its: "at least i have chicken"
---
Yes raid/dungeon healing is the activity the shield is useful but what is the specific content for which you’ll benefit from logging early on site in order to add an extra 600 buffer (which will be unneeded on content where you don’t take damage and useless on content where you do)? MC trash will break the 2nd shield a matter of seconds after breaking the first. I just don’t see a scenario where the first shield gets broken and you have enough to gain by immediately refreshing it to make it worth contriving back to back usage.
---
Invite me to the bot layer pls
---
But if he wants a relationship and not just a hookup, he doesn't need to attract a swathe of women. Ultimately it depends how wide a net he wants to cast and whether he has a specific kind of woman he wants to be with (a gamer, a non-gamer, someone okay with being a WoW widow, whatever). Personally I think he might as well be honest (and funny, women like funny most of all) about who he is and what he enjoys. But... it's possible I'm biased. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Just focus on hitting 60 then make gold.
---
It doesn't work by magic. Just do some googling. You need to enable combat logging, which writes the logs to a text file, which you then upload.
---
But this game is missing horde
---
You guys realize with longer Queue times horde must fill in the gaps right? How do you fill in the gabs? Oh, well, its world pvp! So, you get everything you hate! yay everyone!
---
Just wish honor was rewarded more based on playing well than having no life/job and exploiting. 
---
Fix this exploit, nerf AV honor, and either prevent AV premades or allow them without any of the queue abuse bullshit for both factions. 
---
If some exploits were possible in their reference client they need to think about what “nochanges” really means. 15 years ago information didn’t proliferate like it does now. If they can’t decide what to fix and what not to then just copy the best private servers because that shit was tested and well-liked.
---
You're not gonna get matches anyways, so might as well
---
I have 39 Friends who can join for a bukakke party.
---
It may not have been fully cleared but guilds were still farming 4-9 bosses for 8 months before bwl to gear up their raiders. 4 months even with full clears just isn't enough time to gear up 40 people when lots of drops that are actually good upgrades have less then a 5% drop rate. My guild has been clearing MC since the 3rd week we still haven't seen a single ToEP, and only 1 brutality blade. Anyway you look at it releasing a raid 4 months after launch when it originally came out 8 months after launch is rushed.
---
My honor for the week was reset when I transferred, lost 50k
---
You know when you read something that's not quite right but you know it'll take way too many words and more than a trivial amount of nuance to explain, so you just don't? You chose to keep writing, and that's pretty neat.

Is that the Ikea dining table?
---
You're not wrong, hand of justice is good for tanks too &amp; that mage is a absolute douchebag for rolling on the tank trinket.
---
Simply said you want to prefer using the hoj unless you know the fight is going to go full prison drop the soap on your ass and want/need the protection you get from the tank trinket.
---
Love from a fellow warrior tank, even with all the bis from mc I still use my hand of justice.
---
(it's replaced by black wing lair drake fang talisman)
---
On my Bumble account i had a two truths and a lie that included "personally slain a dragon"...
---
That topic sparked a conversation and almost a year later we're still together!
---
Considering its usually a toggle of on off before even addressing anything else involving it if they're able to "accidentally" turn something like that on their code is some next level bullshit.
---
Yeah it is.

The Hollow Knight head and nail were a part of a Halloween costume :)

As an alliance player...I love the tears. You all deserved it for going the sweaty horde
---
You should joint the warlock discord and download one of the simulators so you can toy with it. 
---
Felheart is basically never going to be better than RotV for PvE DPS, though.
---
Hoj is bis for tank warrior. Period. As long as you didn’t breach any prior agreements about rolling, you were in the right. If they don’t know class mechanics that’s their problem
---
Tip: before you accept a que, scroll down and check if it’s on the bottom of the list. If it is, it’s a new game. If not, it’s an old game and don’t join it.

---
How much AP and crit does your full blues warrior have ?
---
Shield slam with a blue shield should deal somewhere around 270 damage + 250 base threat, so 520 threat. It takes 1111 AP for BT to reach 500 damage, and you ll realistically get 30 health back from BT in a 6s window, so that's 15 additional threat. And it's ignoring the fact that BT is 30 rage while SS is 20, that's huge.
---
At 10% crit chance flurry uptime will be in the 30/35% range, it adds less damage than the 10% one handed damage in the prot tree.
---
You're also losing 5% parry in the arms tree and the 1 rage every 3 sec from anger management. Unbridled Wrath won't give you 1 rage every 3 sec if you're not dual wielding.
---
You can't have all the stats you need in blue gear, and if you mostly focus on defensive stats and trying to reach your hit cap deep prot will be more threat.
---
Didn’t know this, thanks for the tip.
---
Ah, so I don't have to reroll* saving time. My mistake. All of this just saves me time. It's like I didnt choose to roll tank so I have to wait to form dungeon groups. Its inconvenient and is very time consuming. Also I didnt roll alliance so I have to wait for ques. Inconvenient. That's how retail was made. They took the inconvenient and time consuming things and just fixed the problems that players had and over the years it developed into current retail.

No problem! Good luck in your games!
---
If your attack speed is faster than the gcd wouldn't you be losing attacks?
---
Mark of the chosen ;)
---
But yeah, can’t name TWO better trinkets, and with 2 trinket slots it indeed makes HoJ bis for that second one.
---
Here's a good video with some in-game examples and explanations:
---

---
22mp5 isn't anything to scoff at. Even just using the ring on CD it's better MP5 vs hSP than anything else on any slot.
---
But player two would roll 1-1 which always loses
---
shhhh we already got enough server refugees.
---
wait people actually read bios ? 👀
---
Do you guys seen alliance bots in tanaris? I love fucking with bots but I only ever seen horde ones
---
Ah sorry i just meant the meele buff the chicken provides
---
Bro are you a romance scientist? This is way over the scope of the issue for most people but I love the concept
---
This is a great point. Dps warriors who can’t tank don’t deserve to exclude tanks from rolling on “dps” gear. Warrior gear is warrior gear. The only exception is a dps warr shouldn’t be rolling against tank on tank gear
---
It generally had a decent value.  Hard to say per server, but it's a pretty essential recipe.  Start high and work down til you find a buyer.
---
Most of his videos are from the perspective of a naxx geared tank though *
---
But still really good guides and info, just a bit overhyped on fury-prot, not nessesary until aq40 imo
---
Check again later.
---
My fondest memory is when I killed him a few times. I personally have no idea who he is but the name sounds familiar.
---
No I'm not and no it doesn't. If we had sharding we would have never needed layers. You guys feel free to imagine some more shit to complain about though.
---
If you wanna quest to 60 warlock + druid is really fast and can tackle 5 man party quests with just you 2. If your looking to do alot of dungeons on your way to 60 I'd recommend a tank and healer combo warrior + priest/pally shammy.
---
There is literally one better trinket for him and it’s only for maintanking. Go back to retail
---
Shut up baby, I know it
---
The only sub I'm interested is a cold cut combo if you know what I mean
---
ok thanks
---
I mean, it's best for shammy by a large margin. Other healers can use it but most of them don't need to Max mp5 like shammy does. 
---
Using this on CD and without getting agro this either massively bumps mp5 or let's the shaman trade up hSP while keeping a reasonable mp5.
---
I didn't expect to go on classicwow today and get some solid social advice lol. Merry Christmas
---
What issue occurs with AoE loot? Just curious.
---
Shit. I thought it was a tier lower. I was mistaken.
---
Yes, it's important to drink tea while dying.
---
In other words, quality of life lol
---
Yeah I’m mad, who wouldn’t be. I actually play by the rules and am getting outfarmed by bots and afkers.
---
Booty Bay ain’t far away from Gurubashi
---
You're incredibly incorrect lol. 
---
Most dungeons/raids I'm not pulling agro on my shaman. 
---
Sure I'm not using it on ony/Lucy but it's amazing on something like Gar/rag/golem/Domo. 22 mp5 on one piece is great at this point. The biggest thing is just not being dumb and ripping agro as a healer which anyone who's 60 SHOULD be able to do.
---
Took me 8 hours to get to revered opening weekend.
---
Came back last week, about 50+ to get from revered to exalted.
---
So, If you're ally, I got some bad news.
---
Just wanted to second that this worked for me as well
---
Ooh ok so I just did some of this I got my engineering to roughly 185 and I have spent about 70g so far. On faerlina
---
PVP server, PvP happened on PvP server, learn to play, go to retail, etc etc.
---
Welcome to the flip side of what happens when you grief the shit out of the alliance for a month.
---
Right, but if you joined two servers, you could keep them semi-separate with layering
---
Weird how that typo didn’t change anything
---
You have 3 level 1 rogues...?
---
Hi, have you used Questie, or similar addons?  Not that this isn't useful, its just the manual intervention thats needed for each quest seems tedious.
---
Great for target farming though, or maybe hard to find mobs.
---
It's great for tanking and dps. People are just mad they didn't get it
---
What?
---
It's pretty much just a rogue with less down time due to healing and the ability to take on slightly stronger mobs due to hear form.
---
Honestly the hardest bit was the fucking 8-10 bracket where you have no mana after one mob.
---
That is how competitive you have to be. You literally HAVE to afk in between games/sleep during games to stay competitive in bracket 1, especially as a hunter who gets less kills/hour than a warrior, rogue, or ele shaman. Don't know how you concluded there was 'botting' going on. You can try whatever you want, but my gameplay is teflon.
---
I’d be jumping off cliffs in Thousand Needles just to have fun with glide.
---
Kallic, did they attend to your ticket? The first one I did is going on 24 hours.  I used that blue post and opened a new one with the GM's instructions.
---
Our raids meanwhile had no shaman loot.. Lots of hunter though
---
PvP
---
yeah bots farming black lotus would be an example of them really messing with an important part of the economy.
---
You get all the resist you need from your tier gear, not that you really even need it
---
Something something people get lazy something something
---
I would go further and post your toon as the Tinder profile pic.
---
Ask her if she's into bindings.
---
You can just do 
---
&gt;/tm 8
---
Apparently instead of deleting the paladin drops they replaced it with shaman drops and everyone sees shammy gear all the time (resto gear btw)
---
Your country knows how to supply people their basic human rights.
---
I played with a guy in vanilla that put it on his resume.  He's a really nice guy.
---
I've had similar weird experiences. I multibox. I have 10 chars, and was running them all the get their douse for MC
---
One of the characters was not visibile to the other 9. SHowed on their map that she was sitting at the flightmaster, despite on her client being right there with them... and able to follow.
---
The other 9 were unable to target or follow her though. She was able to buff them, they were unable to buff her.
---
Just reserving names
---
PvP where Stam matters
---
No, think of it as Baldurs Gate, or Dragon Age Mode for wow.
---
Given GMs do nothing at all about any losses, I'm surprised restore feature works for classic
---
Correct. I had CDL stuff to do before this and wasn't focused on ranking. The first week I'm ranking focused and I get standing 6.. It's not hard. Sorry to hear that you've been trying your best and could only make it to bracket 3 as a hunter. You just aren't top cut. I was told an entirely different story by a GM and that's not farfetched since they are such a large company, so it looks like there are multiple stories and we will find out based on Blizzard's actions which one is true.
---
if you drink moderately you don't need to drink zero.
---
What
---
The game is more than just leveling
---
Gnomish engineering invis trinket works in combat but will not drop combat.
---
Cause it's automated.
---
Open a GM ticket and take it from there.
---
You only slam with a 2h, which attacks slower than GCD.
---
Twice this week my mate asked if I wanted to join him for arena farm, twice I said no because I was tired. Twice he sent me screenshot of him disenchanting it... Different rolls and groups each time so not the same chest.
---
Literally none.  Aoe loot is great.
---
You mean TARREN MILL?
---
Glad this is where I ended up when whitemane queues were instantly shit.
---
On battle.net, there is an external unstuck feature you can use on your character. I've had something similar happen to me, and that worked. Not sure if it will work in this case.
---
That would be too much effort for minimal rewards.  
---
Faster you hit 60 -&gt; faster gold farming -&gt; buy runecloth and turn it in for reputation.  
---
You will spend more time by changing locations and doing green quests, that would be better spend at 60 farming gold\runecloth.
---
Nah man, it means exactly what I think it does.
---
The 'rules' have changed with regards to real money transactions. No one gives a shit if you gamble with in game currencies.
---
It's OK to admit when you are wrong.
---
I would just get questie, honestly. You will be able to see all the quests available to you in the world on the map, and that'll help you travel around and get them all done. Unsure if you can get it to tell you about rep rewards but I'm sure there's a setting
---
Maybe next year you can ask Santa for a PrntScrn key.
---
That's gonna take longer than 24 hours with blizzard's costumer "service"
---
I'd suggest going to the razergore discord.
---
That said most guilds will see if you fit in in a trial period of a week (maybe 2) and once the trial period is over, accept you completely as their own.
---
And trials usually don't get loot/the scraps.
---
Can you recreate this in another part of Ironforge?
---
Say you are in a volunteer leadership roll with a significantly sized team of like-minded people 🤣
