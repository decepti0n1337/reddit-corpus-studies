It's driving me nuts and I tried diasbling addons one at a time and reloading the UI but I had no luck.

---
What do you mean by this
---
If your on a populated server though is it worth it to go aoe farm? The few farming places ive went to had to many people to not even bother.
---

---
 Ive been wondering how good is going into an aoe spec over a single target or somewhat of a hybrid since with the amount of people around aoe can be tough making majority of your fights single targets.
---
set the graphics to the minimum and turn off all the different graphical nobs and whistles.
---
I believe it's quartz
---
This?

This happened to me too. Out up a boe for 9s instead of 9gold, sucked real bad.

I said DEoI vastly superior to Sulfuras. It's proc is what makes it insanely good. If it works like on private server, it is unbreakable.
---
I did not say mace is bad, I said it is disappointing. The stun is good but not as strong as it is with TUF or the TBC Herald. Since Classic PvP is much more bursty than TBC, it is just plain better to go sword specialization.

You seem upset
---
ask the healer first before doing it. as long as you communicate your intent, then, it's fine.
---
Aaaaw... ):
---
What pre bis warrior is doing 1000 dps consistently that's completely insane. I've seen like maybe 600 with some world buffs from my raids warriors on single target encounters.
---
[removed]
---
Yes, play on the Macbook I play on and be forced to run the game like shit lol
---
Give priests prayer of mending...
---
A geared warrior is pretty devastating in PvP.  "Best" can be subjective depending on specific situations, but they're almost certainly in the top 3 overall I'd say.
---
Use the whirlwind until you can tank with the ravager.

i literally stealthed in there this morning and opened them. got a sack of coins out of each one sometimes 2. maybe a gold total from opening all but 1 (too close to dog boss)

Key ring is in vanilla... Coming in a later phase
---
Their is no point in having this discussion AGAIN. I spent 2 years having discussions about this type of stuff, and most pro changers dont care what thw purpose of classic is. Most didnt even care to use the search function to see if the topic was or had been discussed, just waltzing in like they were the first one to have their grand idea. 
---
They want what they want and want an "improved vanilla". They don't understand that just because they all think it is better, doesnt mean everyone does. All they want is there few personally chosen changes, no matter what.
---
Same lol, I did onyxia with a pug and my first run ever t2 helm dropped and I won the roll
---
If you've never played retail it's worth a try. It's a very different game from classic so not everyone's going to like it, but I enjoy it.
---
XD
---
Classic cast bars is an addon that will display a casting bar under their portrait when they start a spell, showing you which spell they are casting

Imagine playing as a Fox or a Mechanical Gnome.
---
I've started running BRD at 54 (maybe a bit low) but everyone group I've had seems to collapse at some point. We may get through 1-4 bosses but then something goes wrong and it falls apart. Levels and composition vary, but there have been a few groups we should've been able to do this with for sure.
---
turn off all the anti aliasing stuff which is all about smoothing edges. idk if itll make the game look that crappy but it might help. also the gamma is really high in those screenshots which messes with the shadowing and it all looks much worse than actual vanilla graphics lol
---
That was all your luck chips cashed in, lol.  Don’t get in a car or a plane!
---
Molten
---
Yeah I got to kill him a few times with a guild that was absolutely insane about raiding... because they needed a DPS and I was the best geared sub they could find. They had Naxx down pat but I wouldn’t say they were farming it, everyone there had to perform.
---
&gt;Every Druid is meme spec
---
Nope. Bear is best offtank.
---
Those aren't just warning signs, they're alarm bells. Quit now. It isn't worth it.
---
Tailoring is incredibly easy to level. As ZG approaches you can always load up on the mats again, either through farming your own in dungeons or simply purchasing it. You can probably purchase all the mats for ~200g. If you think Alchemy will make you more than 200g from now until ZG (it will) then drop tailoring for it.
---
Tailoring doesn’t really make you gold, so if it’s gold you’re after drop it. If it’s just convenience you’re after, don’t drop it.
---
Its in the xperl/zperl unitframes options
---
At least on Stalaag we have a serious lack of Shamans on Horde.
---
do /y instead :D
---
No, it's not. Whether you like it or not, the inconveniences and rough edges are what give classic wow its charm. The more the world says "too bad," the more it feels like a "world" rather than a "game" that's been focus grouped to death to make sure you're always happy. Do you like running to dungeons? Do you likr having to buy ammo? Do you like needing to steal souls to cast spells? Do you like the freedom for other players to abuse you in pvp, loot theft or contesting spawns? Do you like having to be dedicated to a certain specialization? Probably not at the time, but the amalgamation of all those factors make for a static world that we're trying to survive and excel in spite of, rather than a glorified mini-game portal under the thin vinear of diluted fantasy.
---
Can we not post this human garbage? Its definitely not world first and this dude is a cancer

Lol

Does this even work? Who’s gonna buy them for 90s each

https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#class=Priest&amp;boss=672
---
Rag, 1-2 minute kills, which fits your criteria. 570 dps first place, and falls down pretty rapidly. Switch to mage or warlock and their #100 does more than that.
---
What is? You don't get any survivability from shadow talents until 40 (besides VE).
---
Understand asking the group is fine but odds are only one in the group is affected so the”group vote” is kind of crap. 
---
If I’m a healer and you were healing and wanted to roll for DPS gear and I said go for it, the DPS might not like it but don’t want to cause issues so let you anyway. Honestly I think you roll for what you are playing. Want to raid heal, level as a healer. Just my opinion but the “group vote” is trash because, as I said, it almost everyone in the group won’t care because it doesn’t have any effect on them at all.
---
I read it. i Can not TLDR this. Assuming this isnt a troll post. all these details are like. vital things
---
If you would have seen the way it went down, you'd get it. I'm not trying to be some try hard prick. But in my personal experience with the game, arcane and fire mages have ruled in skill and rrsults, while frost is some meta meme in my eyes. It was his reaction and decisions afterward that made me notice. 
---
I only wanted to see where and when I could be fire successfully because right now for raids it isn't realistic. Even when told fire is the lesser of specs i always come across different results ingame. And of course that varies player to player. The guy could've used some pointers and I hope him happy hunting.
---
I like comic sans, what's the hub of git?
---
Hold if you can afford it
---
The problem, as I see it, was that they didn't state all the loot rules upfront. They only said the cape was reserved, then sprang the neck on the OP after they joined. That's shitty.
---
Join the discord. Don't worry lost people don't listen anyway so you will be fine! Hope things go your way man, these people are real jerks. What server are you on?
---
To my understanding its MS &gt; OS in dungeons unless you state otherwise no? At least thats how I always played the game. Im playing tank if I want to join a dungeon for some Arms or Fury gear I ask beforehand if everyone is fine with me rolling on it.
---
Oh snap, I see Fleshless in that screen.  I was in Strife with him when we first started raiding lol
---
Cringe tbh. I know everyone is trying to be supportive or whatever but, "You can't enjoy your hobbies now that we are married" is not something that any healthy marriage or relationship is built on. If it's supposed to be a joke, it's not even a little bit amusing except to maybe other wives and women who think this way.
---
Yessss
---
Tailors can use demonic runes to craft things, so you can technically assign a gold value to them.
---
So hows your CrossFit adventure going? Or is that why you’re so bitter lol.
---
When you can make real money off fake money playing a game, you get this.
---
You can't compete with multi boxing mage farmers, pulling a couple hundred bucks a week farming wow and selling gold.
---
It has!
---
Isn't block off GCD?
---
Don't overthink it. Do what your role should do and you will be fine. Dungeons aren't that hard.
---
Me too, thanks
---
No reason to not start raiding alrdy then
---
For sure cata was fun as hell. I liked some of the 5mans it had. All in all i rly rly liked TBC. Perfect for me
---
Barbershop
---
What threat meter is that?
---
They can, as I know deaf people that do. The problem in this situation is that they need to HEAR and can't, so whether or not they can talk isn't relevant. Dumb ass.
---
Dual spec would be nice tbh
---
2 hours of ZF = 100g? Really?
---
too many years playing EQ
---
53 min run this looks more like a challenge than a gold farm
---
Wait really? I assumed classic wouldn't have world events
---
Thanks for the insight! 
---
Feel pumped now. My priest is already lvl 16 again! (I played a lot today :D)
---
Unlimited debuffs on mobs
---
Yes, the numbers are slightly off, hence the "~" in my original post (which means approximate). I made a very quick and rough estimate meant to show how ridiculous it is to assume fury/prot is mandatory.
---
As for rage: Raid bosses are unlimited rage situations, outside of an unlucky dodge/parry/miss string early in a fight. You can use an ability on every single global cooldown.
---
"Then the boss parries a few times and you're fucked." - If the boss parries your attack, you still generate rage. Have you ever tanked before?
---
Its a shiny. There's only a 1/8192 chance of this happening though.
---
PVP!?
---
Rogues only need 1% hit (5% precision 3% wep skill) for raid bosses. I believe shadowcraft is def pre BIS the energy proc is insane many top logs have shadowcraft rogues beating mc geared rogues.
---
Jealous much?
---
You could use harm macros.
---
Like /cast [harm] moonfire; rejuvenation
---
If you are targeting something to harm, it is moonfire, if you are not, it's rejuvenation
---
Yea, and that's time consuming and takes away from the person typing. Look, I get it. Maybe you wouldn't do this in your guild. And it would be great if we could always include everyone. But the solution offered wasn't fitting for this guild.
---
Do it until you take too much dmg then switch to 1h and shield
---
&gt;they have absolutely no threat management
---
They have a metric ton of passive threat reduction from talents.
---
The shit that gets upvotes on this sub haha
---
My server is already pretty dead, Not a lot of PuGs and i don't really wanna commit to a guild.
---
Dragon scale for sure
---
Legal rmt.
---
I dinged in an instance once, jumped around in happiness, into lava, and died
---
What's the reasoning?
---
Except he didnt interact with his stream.
---
Yea but as a healer it makes sense to me. I usually assume I’m gonna get the healing items. If a dps hybrid joins I would confirm this same thing and wouldn’t want to go if all I need was the necklace.
---

Ms &gt; os

patch 1.13 is classic only. 
---
In vanilla it went fro, 1.0 to 1.12 then 2.0 for the TBC prepatch.
---
&gt;the class's greater survivability
---
Shadowform gives 15% dmg reduction, Inner fire gives a ton of armor an all priests come with a bubble. Shadow can also draintank on-lvl elite if needed. Mind control is also amazing CC.
---
What's the add-on that some streamers use where debuffs (such as death coil) shows in the middle of their screen (instead of top right) and bigger?
---
If you don't die, yes pretty easily. There is some slight variance in the number of uncommons and rares but it's legit 50/hr and I only have the 60% mount
---
Love it!
---
That addon hasn’t worked in like a month
---
These days, possibly. Back in 2004, the ratio of women playing male characters vs the other way around was way higher. Much less harassment when other people think you're a man.
---
Omg had no idea. Thanks
---
Same here
---
maybe they call the pre-bc wow game 'vanilla' and want to differentate  because they dont call it classic
---
that is definitely not naxx catchup gear...  it was before naxx and none of it would have been useful in nax.
---
Reality is often disappointing
---
 
---
\-When was the last time you cleared an instance normally without cleave? never joined a cleave group, don't even see them advertized on my server
---
\-How many successful MC PuGs have you been into?I'mnot raiding yet but there are several successful pugs a week. 
---
\-When was the last time you saw an alive fire elemental in the circle of west binding in Arathi? I can go farm them whenever I want too, there usually at most 1 person there.
---
\-Last time you saw Qia in winterspring not camped by vendor bots? this used to be camped back in the day too.

---
I guess you have some optimized clear path? Or you just go through it until you clear all the packs?
---
Exactly, no skill required, thus I dont see why I would charge sky high prices for it. Like if it doesnt take any of my mats and the time it takes me to craft it is like what maybe 10 seconds? I dont see why id charge anything above maybe 5g to make it, especially when you consider that the only reason you have the pattern is based purely on luck.  
---
  
---
Again though, if *you* want to be greedy and charge 50-100g or whatever, then you do what you want. Not everyone is like that.

sorry just a butthurt undergeared priest

Tribal is generally considered the most lucrative since it has the devilsaur set and hide of the wild which are both in high demand. It’s also good for hunter since the devilsaur set is pre-bis for them.

It's just "Boomer humor". I guess if that's your style of humor then that's fine. But "wife bad"/"marriage bad" jokes are played out and unfunny.
---
Great vid. Just got to level 52 myself using this. The scepter was a pain in the ass to get but definitely worth it.
---
What are you having trouble with on it?
---
200 is a solid amount, he'd probably need some combination of the LW epics like Molten Helm, Lava Belt, and Corehound boots.
---
Some blue leather options are Flamescarred Shoulders, Cinderhide Armsplints, Felhide Cap, and Coal Miner Boots, and Wildfire Cape. There's also Drakefire Amulet, Blazing Emblem, and Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector.
---
Finally there's the Volcanic set and Flamescarred Girdle, but those give up all semblance of other beneficial stats.
---
Look up Frostadamus/FrostLive, they both have nice guides with pathing and what to kill/how to incorporate beetles once your zombie clear time dips below 12 mins
---
Oh I'm aware, just putting a player number/percentage out there for the rest of the thread.
---
It is anything but arbitrary, man.  If you can't see that I don't know how else to explain this.
---
I don't get it, what am I missing?
---
MC took 5 days. Naxx will take 3 hours at best and hundreds of guilds will clear it in the first week.
---
wow I didn't knew that either
---
% crit doesnt translate into % damage, especially with modifiers. And if you think Ferals and Boomkins are 12% behind other dps then you're friends are garbage hahaha.
---
not lying man just try it
---
But only one skele per person, so not like vanilla.
---
This subreddit is convinced that actually putting effort into not being dumpster at the game means you clearly aren't having fun
---
Didn't wipe in MC for 5 hours then end up calling it at geddon? Fucking tryhards just enjoy the experience
---
Reached level 60 before phase 3? Get a life

Not wearing strength cloth gear because you actually know how to itemize your character? Wtf go play retail instead if you care about dps

I don’t pvp in bfa. I raid and m+.
---
I think I used a grand total of 4 spells, Rank 4 Flash Heal, Rank 4 Renew, Rank 4 Holy Nova (With clearcast when possible), and Abolish Disease. 
---
Flashed if below 40%, Renew if 50-60%, cleanse bad diseases. 
---
One thing I didnt know about when I did it was the buff questgiver gives you when a group makes it safe, mana + health regen from what I read, wish I had know when I did it. 
---
Only buffs I had were Fort/Spirit/Nightfin soup.
---
“I got carried”
---
I mean everyone on the first few days of the release were posting pics of people queueing for quest mobs. Not hard to believe that they’d continue that on some servers with specific quests, especially if it’s an RP server
---
maybe he's greek.
---
oh well. now you know =)
---
I have a spit macro used mainly on filthy horde 5 to 10 levels higher who gank me

If you got to Naxx in vanilla, anybody who was all about ninjaing etc was *loooong* gone.

People don't seem to get just how few people actually so much as set foot in naxx in vanilla.

You think he gets invited?
---
You didn’t say tanking successfully so if we just get a clip...
---
Don’t use cast sequences if you have high lag - it won’t move to the next spell until it is cast and the server lag is accounted for - this dramatically effects your dps. 
---
If you have a long chain of spells to cast - then alternate between two cast sequences with a reset modifier
---
What SHOULD he have done in that situation? “Not to nitpick” I mean he did a pretty normal mob kill sounds like and you’re championing this as proof frost mages are all incompetent
---
I mean all your posts are pretty bad (I can’t be frost I much prefer my one button rotation to be fireball!) but this is taking the satire too far
---
The hat's not in the loot table on my server.
---
Ehhhh the rake looks a little to much like your typical lion. I am fine with my  flightless bird.
---
You’re probably right, but I imagine there are many guilds clearing MC that won’t be as successful in Naxx.  It’ll be cleared fast, but it’s far and away more difficult than MC.  That place broke guilds in Vanilla.
---
Oh man I miss this show so much now
---
The BRD full clear route is interesting to say the least. Dont know how many will do it like that though.
---
I like to keep a third in the bank now in case I delete one accidentally again.

I just using it for leveling, without problem atm. I still have all the spells keybind. But thank for the input, didn't know.

A try hard guild is in the attitude, not the actual accomplishments. A try hard guild would be one where vent or now discord, is always silent except RL and they are just barking orders. It's organized and efficient, but not what most people would like. A guild can still do great with a more laid back raid environment.
---
As a warlock I've never had issues with anything really. While leveling I could join any dungeon runs, regular or spellcleave. At max level I can join almost any groups due to great damage, utility and summons (tanks are lazy), wipe-prevention doesn't hurt either. 
---
Never had trouble getting into raids as locks although seem to be abundant, they are rare in raids, usually you want at least 3-4 locks for curses, banish, soulstones, healthstones etc. Also, locks boost eachothers damage with shadow vurnability on SB crit. I can also solo a lot of content and farm a lot of gold on my own, favourite atm is selling dreadsteed mount otherwise we got mara, DME solo, eye of shadow to mention a few.
---
I love you too &lt;3
---
I've been in the same boat. My alt is nearly 35 and I can just make them a goblin eng to fullfil the mains needs. Not sure if that would be a mistake.
---
😂
---
Looking For Group channel or the general chat of the relevant zone is your best bet. I've seen quite a few people advertise for Zul'Farrak in Tanaris for instance, not to mention the omnipresent Deadmines in Westfall and common enough Stockades in Stormwind. It's not a 24/7 thing but it's not rare either.
---
Outside of that, just realize that certain dungeons are way less popular. On my server Alliance side some of the least popular dungeons appear to be Blackfathom Deeps, Gnomeregan, and Razorfen Kraul. Depending on when I played it literally felt like it took a week to be able to get a group when I wanted it, though I was mostly passive in terms of looking to fill groups rather than forming one starting as just a DPS. There are also a couple of other things like Wailing Caverns that you technically can do as Alliance but why would you and good luck trying to put a group together. It's not strictly a Horde dungeon but might as well be, even on PvE.
---
Because that isnt what people wanted. They didnt want vanilla-ish. They wanted vanilla.
---
Imagine gatekeeping what people choose to do with their bodies.

What's the fastest way to level mining from 230 onward?
---
Meeting stones were 2 no? The reason why you need 3 with a lock is because the lock has to cast it.
---
the only other options for a worthwhile offhand before raid are insanely rare drops. youre better off getting the guaranteed quest item and calling it good
---
Yes! You were correct. I found it. Thank you so much!
---
For anyone curious, I unchecked the box Quartz &gt; Buff &gt; Enable
---
Quartz aura and buff timer.
---
I'd only disagree with a few very rare exceptions, like briar Reed etc. Otherwise, you can just run with priest healers and find a ton of solid healing leather.
---
You are correct, the point I'm making though is that if you find that to be the most offensive part of the post you're being willfully ignorant of the Horde player being a piece of work.
---
I found it under Quartz, but thanks everybody for helping me!
---
Go play Fortnite, that might be more up your alley.

Hey I just replied to another message. When it happened i messaged 2-3 random people from the guild asking for the name of an Officer or the GM so I could talk to someone about it and they never replied so I gave up. I can also send the screenshots if you'd like just let me know the best way to do it.
---
 can pursuit be counterspelled?
---
the small flame sacs must be similarly overhunted then

If they're casting till their bobber is on mine that won't work though right

Imagine being a tank and not getting to set your own terms.
---
I tank with randos all the time. I’m not at late game yet but I’ve practically lived at SM for weeks. Only one group was kind of belligerent. They weren’t exactly rude but just weird. Kicked me from group after i won the helmet off Herod then messaged me that they still loved me lol 
---
Anyways, point is I have yet to encounter any toxicity from groupmates about tanking. Most people are super grateful to get a tank.

And LFR wasn't even until the last raid, Dragon Soul.

---
And I will probably be there, rerolling as alliance in an attempt to fix what blood elves are only going to make much, much worse.
---
Going in underleveled is the primary obstacle.  If you insist on doing BRD as a &lt; 55 you will aggro packs that normally don’t need to be cleared.  Thus slowing down the runtime of a normally 2-hour long instance if questing in a full clear run.  And the level 58 bosses will be red or orange to you, further downplaying your contribution.
---
There is also a mechanics requirement that is not introduced very well in earlier dungeons.  Primarily, the level 50 bracket predecessor, Sunken Temple, is relatively easy compared to BRD pulls.  So anyone’s first few runs will be a struggle for sure.
---
To smooth out your runs, consider paying a higher level tank to carry as an option.  I personally would not recommend doing BRD before the MC attunement at level 55 is unlocked.
---
Were you able to loot them all?
---
I'm also on the council, i tried to have a discussion about poasibly giving an item to a dps before a tank and our officer put me on ignore and gquit then griefed the dungeon we were doing at thw time. So yeah I don't trust the officers haha
---
What a fucking snowflake.
---
Reroll PvE or quit whining. It's part of the game.
---
only a few though, unlike in vanilla
---
Arena
---
Well in a good guild, and I don’t mean tryhard by good, there will be a way to support you with the materials needed for a BIS.
---
Respectfully disagree. WoW was ruined when Activision acquired Blizzard and the managerial roles changed from people who spent their careers in gaming and wanted to make and administrate the best game possible to people who wanted to monetize as efficiently as possible, losing sight of the fact that long term profitability often requires not maximizing short term profitability. This happened shortly before the ICC patch in WotLK, if I remember correctly
---
Get rid of Blood Elves and TBC is the perfect expansion.
---
People that do this are so cringy.
---
Dude just join LMAO he doesn't have to talk. It sounds like you might be the one that needs help using the toilet
---
I have, it is wonderful and super friendly. And I'm not even in this guild.
---
I mean it means people just have to farm more... 8/8 mages in our raid roster respec to Arcane/Frost on raid night and then swap back to their farming spec right after lol
---
Lol if that's what you wanna think , fine.
---
In my opinion, I’d rather see BC. It’s a perfect continuation of vanilla. Reduced but harder raids, kara, arena, heroics. It was a good ass time and there was never a boring moment. Vanilla is boring compared to wrath or BC.
---
Classic+ I would not be opposed to, but the question you need to ask yourself is do you think Blizzard can handle it? No, and hell no. They’ll fuck it up like they did everything else. Modern Blizzard is ran by potatoes
---
Time to reroll
---
&gt; Anyways, point is I have yet to encounter any toxicity from groupmates about tanking.
---
Truthfully, I've only really seen that here.  Not in game.
---
Crusader strike. I'd really like a button to press.
---
You are absolutely right, this profession is useless. Being a rogue I also made this huge mistake levelling it to 286 and then cancelled it to take herbalism instead (my 2nd profession is engineering) and I only regret not doing it earlier. No idea why guides recommend it, I guess if you are rolling on a dead server where you are the only leatherworker in town you might make some money from it, but on my high pop server this profession is extremely popular and people keep it “just because it hurts their soul to delete it”.
---
Looks great I was hoping to try air brushing a horde logo on a pumpkin soon
---
Too bad it’s horde.
---
Not yet
---
Wow forums at the bar xD
---
\*laughs in aquatic form\*
---
Don't worry about faction imbalance. My server is already 3 Horde for every 1 Alliance lol.
---
Yours reminds me of a ghost from Destiny
---
I have honestly never used strafe even once. I found out about it recently and gave it a try but it was very annoying to use.
---
ZF solonruns
---
i just /laugh. though there definitely needs to be a /pity emote lol
---
I miss my tauren pally.
---
That's so cool, man. Congrats to you all! If you guys ever do this again, and need 1 more person, let me know!
---
You're just pulling stuff out of your ass now. The cases where PvP gear is better then PvE is few and far in between. Even in TBC you were king if you had 4/4. Every dps class would use PvE rings/trinkets/amulets, healers would use PvE to have more mana sustain. The only ones who would use full PvP equip **in PvP** were punching bags like warlocks.
---
And in PvE the only usable things were weapons thanks to their dps. Every other piece was just terribly itemized with resilience (in regards to PvE).
---
This seems strangely appropriate:
---
I thought my life was a tragedy but then I learned it was a comedy.
---
We killed her with 25 before she could use breath...
---
It's not hard
---
What's RL? Does it even exists? Once, I was in Stonefire tavern, searching for the truth. One dwarf there argued that it is a lie created by Dark Riders of Medivh to keep people away from the secrets of mythical tower Karazhan. Any thoughts people?
---
Not exactly, you get reduced XP even if the low level tags and the high level kills it - unless the mob tagged is green to the person w/o the tag. Test it yourself.
---
healing meters are very, very subjective. honestly, they don't really matter, like, at all... but, assuming equal gear, Priests should be outhealing Paladins at this point 'cuz Paladin's don't have enough +crit gear to take advantage of Divine Favor.
---
&gt; Damage meter doesn't scale with UI scale.
---
It does though. You are right on horizontally part. Maybe i make mine smaller.
---
I love arena but it just wouldn’t work in Vanilla. Classes aren’t balanced for it, and it would just devolve into a handful of comps at higher ratings.
---
Just gonna do leatherworking to make my own devilsaur shit, and make gear for my alts and then swap to herb/alch, personally.
---
That's a nice UI
---
Ascalontv (XN), he's actually over 950 now.
---
No one who didn't theorycraft HARD and knew their classes and strategies inside and out cleared Naxx 40.
---
Does it? I didn't notice mine change. Either way you can just resize the window individually.
---
wife didnt make me quit gaming, still unhappy...
---
your havin a good night farming, you can farm a pair of devilsaur pants in hour-hour n half. how long it going to take you to farm the gold for the pants.
---
yes! I just had a chat with someone ingame and their theory is  that the clocks going back caused it to bug out maybe? I thought that was a good idea
---
Gotta go team classic+ on this one. Just because of flying killing world pvp. 
---
Also, new content I haven’t seen before! I’d like to see what they can come up with in a classic context.
---
I know but I was just wondering if there is an actualy way to do it so I dont have to move. For example if Im netted or something I need a way to cancel cast.
---
yes i know, but you can farm 14 hides in a hour to hour half if get your tags, then just buy the 30 rugged for 3g or w/e pretty sure the markets flooded with it from people farming winter spring
---
I don't mind getting ganked one or two times by the same guy, but to be camped by someone 10+ levels while you're questing is frustrating. There's no point to camp someone over and over if they haven't done anything.  Sure if I was going around ganking others well below my level that would be understandable, but just questing minding my own business just kill me and move on...
---
Rogue or Warlock as a alt to my Hunter. Will be pug raiding and pvping. I will level them both eventually but i want to level one before phase 2 and can't decide.
---
He probably just found an afk shadowmelded night elf and took this screenshot
---
What reasoning do you have for giving a shit about it being mail on a ranged dps class(since we're talking about hunters specifically)? Mail doesnt matter.
---
Fire stone 😛
---
Some of my absolute favorite memories of BC were the hours and hours I spent at Halaa.  And I was on a PVE server at that time.  It was definitely not my experience that world pvp died in BC. It was my experience that people who were interested in world pvp got it, and people who didn't want to engage, didn't have to.
---
Better off to come up with a name that suits your characters race. Like a dwarven name for a dwarf... etc.
---
The first one is the only one that is easily readable
---
You mean you're trying to buff the opposite faction? Unless you have them mind controlled that won't work.
---
How so?
---
Blizzard did admit flying was a mistake, transversing the world just became skipping over everything, no bumping into players or random PvP along the way. 
---
World PvP died or at least was very diminished
---
I can’t really think of a non linear dungeon 
---
Apart from cities pretty much every zone died in Azeroth 
---
Getting epic geared was super easy 
---
My criticism maybe completely wrong, I would just like to hear why
---
If if it’s really that rare on your sever, I would be charging a high premium for it. Find the average price for 16 slot bags and add 50-75%
---
Purged by pain!
---
But the Healer gets dicked over.
---
you can call it whatever you want, its still much less corpses than there would have been in vanilla.
---
Lol. Being tank doesn't make you the party leader. Tanks are welcome to join a party and demand certain rules, and party leaders are welcome to kick those tanks.
---
Stormwind rendezvous is a 20 minute escort quest with I presume at least a 5 minute respawn. I just can’t believe anyone would be waiting for that, a 15 man queue would literally be hours.
---
I’m just being a smart ass, I don’t know but I’m sure someone will chime in w your answer
---
Is that on Redtube premium?
---
Here on Golemagg-EU a guild horde has already looted it 7 times
---
OMEGALUL
---
On my hunter, instead of using his fine 2h sword he swings his quiver around.
---
Cuz it takes all five of you to get there so why shouldn't someone else be able to roll on that stuff if it is an upgrade for them?  Because you made the group? If that's the case then why don't you create a group with nobody else that needs that item. Eventually that's just what happens anyway, it just gets old seeing your spam in lfg. And it gets old joining groups only to be whispered that something's on reserve and then having to leave.
---
I wouldn’t personally wait, I’d come back to it later, but I do believe that it’s reasonable to expect a line for it. People do it at the DMV why not in the game? At least you’re home and can presumably tab out and do something else. That’s how long login queues used to be so we’re accustomed to waiting to play the game
---
I'm not playing on a hardcore server. I've seen pugs fail at the first boss in MC, I've seen pugs clear 10/10. I've failed 7 times in a row at ony and done it in one go.
---
It's definitely an authentic experience. I doubt I'll see pugging in the higher tier raids.
---
TSM I believe. It has crafting / mail support.
---
I wish they added titanforging.
---
Getting full t1 as hunter or druid is so easy. If they maybe gave it a 10% chance to roll for extra stats or crit chance it would be more fun to come back to clear mc
---
^^^:)
---
the 14 hides are already 115g, with other stuff make it 120g. So u only get a small profit from turning it into leggings, beside devilsaur is really contested and ran by the maffia. GL farming for 1hr with no issues
---
Use a macro:
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [harm, nodead] damage spell; [help, nodead][@player] healing spell
---
Place the macro on your bar and bind it to whichever key you wish.
---
Not sure what I was pulling out of my ass. Just speaking from my experience and my opinion. That's fine if you like the way it's set up in TBC. I don't remember Vanilla PvP gear quite as well as I only had it after it was relevant.
---
Flying was outlands only in TBC.  You had to be able to fly there.  It was designed with that in mind and worked perfectly.  Getting geared wasn’t super easy, it took forever.  Not as long as vanilla but appropriately long.  It opened up arenas which many people love.  PvP gear I could do without however.  The quality of raiding in BC was fantastic.  I think it’s by far and away the best expansion.  Not perfect, but close
---
There are spawn points at scholo too
---
I seen them go for like 250-400
---
If tanks are in demand, they can do whatever they want, and if you can find a tank willing to go without reserves, then that's also great. Harassing somebody because you don't agree with them however isn't okay.
---
Plus as a mage item it’s automatically worth more in gold because as a mage you can farm gold so ez and quick
---
Position better and communicate better... Bats are annoying but we never died to them as 3
---
Shoutout to his [excellent guide on WoTLK feral DPS] (https://fileunderferal.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/simplecatdps.jpg).
---
I just made the switch to herb. Although I was farming devilsaurs on my server lately. Adding about 50-100g s day if I went to un goro and farmed then.
---
They drop from the oozing in un goro
---
Doesn't thrash blade have a sub 4% proc rate? That's statistically a fairly small amount of extra dps.
---
I don',t think they intended on drowning you, they wanted to keep you down there to be toxic.  To waste your time.
---
uh yeah, and thats a significantly less profit after turning it to leggings to the point of it not being worth than actually having 200g drops lol
---
The guy was agreeing with you his grammar just sucks.
---
&gt;Not sure, I think your criticisms of &gt;TBC are spot on though.
---
do keep in mind this is ment to be a "what if".
---
you might not like the idea but some people do.
---
for instance as a mage i dont like that i cant have a bad ass single target dungeon spec (like a fire spec) and a more raid or pvp friendly spec like frost.
---
dont get me wrong, i dont WANT changes but if they were to add anything duel spec would be the least offending to me
---
My gf made me realise I was playing an unhealthy amount and now I can plays games in moderation. Win win!
---
man of culture :)
---
the sss got me
---
Gratz
---
small world! I built a turbo e30 in high school (~2008) and it was really bad and didn't live long lol. I'm onto trying to turbo mustangs now. You're rolling too good on life
---
Hell, I'll admit, I'd probably want to try having streaming/gaming as a living. But I'm definitely not jealous of Tips. Im more annoyed about the fact that it could've been someone else, someone who is more genuin, and, well, not an asshat. Everyone of course isn't perfect, far from it. But I'd much rather chill and "cool" people like defcamp, madseason, savix etc would be as big as him. But hey, take  it as you want.
---
The dumb thing about them was how KT developed as a character into TBC. He was awesome in wc3 and turned into a wacky ass raid boss for TBC, even though his raid was fun as fuck
---
Sadly. Assuming you’re both equal skill and gear the answer is: No.
---
What class has the highest quality of life? Meaning leveling speed, ease of gearing, ease of getting dungeon/raid spots, travel speed, gold farming ability, etc.
---
It was dwarves that could be shammy right? I remember thinking that made sense. Sunwalker Tauren would've really benefited from a bit of class-race personalization
---
On retail WoW there is an entire guild of deaf players that do Mythic level raiding and they even killed Mythic Mekkatorque which is probably the hardest boss to do with no comms. 
---
You and your friend can absolutely raid and GM's that kick you are just being dickheads.
---
Bruh, he's deaf not mute. That means he can't listen and take immediate orders. That stuff would need to be typed out instead.
---
Sword and board if you want to be a wee bitch that takes marginally less damage and cant hold threat when ur 3 dps press their buttons.
---
Ww axe if u want to be a chad threatmachine with sweepers and cleave. Makes ur healers job easier as all the mobs hit 1 target instead of 5, while also doing by far the most damage in ur typical pug group of monkeys
---
Just make sure you're downloading the correct client, the Classic client is separate from the newest expansion. There is a drop down to select classic when you're looking at WoW on the battle.net launcher.
---
They aren't balanced for lvl 60 at all it would be much worse
---
I remember felguard could 1v1 easily all players at lvl 60
---
We get the key ring soon.
---
Ice block gives you more time to peel away adds. Mage should not have blinked, he should have just got into aggro range and blocked.
---
DPS on Onyxia are limited by the *offtank's* threat, not the main tank's. DPS need to stay below the second tank's threat in phase 1 and phase 2 in order for her to attack the offtank in phase 3. Again, this is the worst possible fight to demonstrate fury/prot's usefulness.
---
Threat on Ragnaros is a non-issue because his punt is resistable. Even if you get punted (why didn't you wear your fire resist gear?) melee still need to stop DPS completely every 25 seconds or so. They won't beat you.
---
Leeway still exists nowadays, as someone who plays with subpar internet and was a Monk, leeway has always been important. It's just more noticable in Classic due to how slow we are
---
Probably not, but it would have been a fuckload closer. Oh, and as JokerD demonstrated, world leveling is significantly more effective than spellcleave, especially without the exploit.
---
Haha the first time I cleared SSC was on my female enh Draenei shammy.
---
I dont understand whats happening, can some1 enlighten me?
---
I spit on all the HordebI kill. It's well deserved in my opinion.
---
I used to think tbc because it was my favourite, but classic + has the potential to be so much more.
---
I’d welcome and really enjoy tbc, but i think a well made classic + that added things like better itemization, broken (bad) specs made semi competitive, arena added and pvp expanded on, no flying mounts, etc, could be great.
---
It just depends on whether or not you trust the current team working on wow to make something that isn’t a huge step towards what’s wrong with retail now.
---
buying painted carrots lul
---
Out?!...wow, me and my guild are still trying to find the way IN to this alledged maze
---
I think he was agreeing with you
---
Engineering is always better than other professions. It depends what your other option is or if you can actually benefit from Enchanting. Do you have good high end recipes for enchanting? Do you want to sit around org/if all day spamming to make money?
---
Bartender.
---
mad
---
Or use questie,
---
So if my hearth is on cooldown how can i exit dungeon like inner mara?
---
Are you having trouble understand the context of my comment? This is what I was responding to: 
---
&gt; in classic you can only have one skeleton corpse, so you don't get mass field of corpses after epic pvp events. 
---
That's simply not true. You still get mass fields of corpses.
---
What’s the addon called that shows health like that?
---
Dude they were 60k and I thought it was just because it was new and should go down a bit later. Should have dumped all my money right there. It's bitcoin all over again.
---
I fuckin snort laughed at the “IM HERE” Alex Jones sound bite when the warrior came running in
---
It really isn’t though
---
Last census we ran as a guild had a 60-40 split
---
And it always feels like there are no alliance players anywhere
---
Bartender replaces my default shit and puts some texture behind it to make it look like the default. Can't have it.
---
That's nobodies business but the Turks.
---
[Arthas calls it "Strath-olme" in the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bePzOaNxKwo#t=7m28s)
---
I call it Byzantium.
---
It's just a conspiracy theory by sylvannas to keep the forsaken in a blissful ignorance. She would rather keep them making mythical potions of mass team killing than actually delve into the unknowns of a possible "outside world".
---
freezing band is insane too, around 1k on my server at times
---
Bring a priest to MC mobs and buff the shit out of them. Love putting Thorns on low level mobs and watch melee kill themselves by attacking it. Elwyn Forest is gear for this.
---
I think you need more addons.
---
Not to even mention the ninjas who waste literal hours of your real life
---
The event is supposed to happen on the hour
---
Armor does not matter a huge amount compared to FR, though you don't wanna stack FR at the cost of everything else.
---
If you are desperate to survive and want to wear as much FR gear as possible, then i advice you to invest in a flask of titans, then you can do whatever really and it will likely work out.
---
It's a fucking raid quest. Why weren't those 15 people in a group with each other?
---
Only 500 on mine and its pre raid BiS so I equipped it lol
---
Laughed so many times throughout this. Thanks for posting.
---
Multiboxers enjoy this as one person
---
no its a troll post
---
Ive just recently hit 60 on my warrior and I have to tell you that you dont *really* need to use a shield until like.. uldaman and thats on specific mobs because they enrage.   
---
You can also use 1h+shield on bosses if you feel like it. Its pretty much a judgement call, if youre feeling like youre just getting slapped really hard, then yeah bust out the shield.  
---
Id only really recommend beginning to use a shield like in Mara and above unless you have a *boss* high dps group where you can bring down the groups in short fashion, but again, pull it out for bosses.
---
unless the warrior is deep prot he should have no problem tanking any dungeon.
---
What do you want the leaderboards to show?
---
Because OP is lying.
---
Everyone? You overestimate how many people will care.
---
It's not even elitism. Onyxia requires you to do very simple things: don't stand in front of or behind her, don't hit her too hard...and that's basically it.
---
My boy Howler making it to the front page.
---
Man I’m sorry.  That’s bullshit.
---
Dalson's Tears, Sorrow Hill, and the Scarlet lumber camp just north of dalson's tears are all great at 52+ (I believe the lumber camp might need 54). At 56 you can go to hearthglen as well. All of these spots are viable to hit 60 off of if you really wanted to
---
yeah i would pretty much always equip items if they're bis for me. that's what they're there for :P
---
“Make all my own shit” - and what is it exactly? Missing a huge amount of resources while levelling just for an ability to craft some trash tier items which you can buy on AH for pennies and which is worse than stuff from dungeon and quests. This is why I call this logic weird - you’re basically lying to yourself that this profession is any useful.
---
could you link the reddit discussion about it please?
---
warcraft-logs
---
You quit reddit cause you're a twat?
---
There's this thing called reading comprehension, ever heard of it?
---
I would assume they can, if mages can....
---
For what?
---
Nice. Your story reminds me of when a druid entangled me (Warrior) underwater. I equipped my Hydrocane and while they kept casting entangle (at least 10 times), I kept shooting them with my gun until they went oom and died.
---
I feel attacked
---
Wait, all of them are playable?
---
Given that hes a rogue, he is probably opting to fo sword spec which gives you 5% chance for an extra swing. So you have thrahs blade chance + talents working together. When I was leveling Thrash balde + vanquishers carried me till 60, and honestly thrash plus any other weapon is great, id just go double sword though.
---
How is wotf better than escape artist?
---
i had pretty much the opposite. 300 ping and 20 fps. i had 40/60 fps outside solo and in dungeons though.
---
Escort quests don’t keep walking when you enter combat, not sure if that’s how it was in any expansion but that’s the one thing I’ve encountered that I’ve actually bitched about out loud to myself.
---
Ketamine isn't there ALL the time.
---
basically torture.
---
Communication is key. As a healer, a druid who opens a dialogue from the get-go about what they're hoping for is almost 100% of the time someone I'm happy to run with, even if it means I might be competing for gear. Hell, I might even already have the piece they want!
---
But then I'm stuck with Bartender's mediocre replacements for the default action bars that are haphazardly reverse engineered to resemble the default Blizzard UI. Don't want that.
---
Just copy paste what i wrote into google
---
no changes no changes 
---
*uses discord* 
---
@_@
---
I read it when I'm taking shits, rli brings me back
---
Seriously? Dont run it and get nothing.  Or run with a pug and maybe get something maybe get nothing who knows. I don't know what else to say.
---
This is so cool
---
If you're not careful, she might swallow your sword...
---
Ew, no. There was just one Alliance guy on top dancing. He didn't kill anyone. And we were killing each other then killing the opposite faction down below.
---
What does AQ stand for?
---
I always bring my SHOOOOOT BOOOIS. What server are you on? Hit me up if you need s group.
---
Kurinnaxx too, kicked off but eventually got back in.
---
You can jump over the wall, it's actually really easy, was with a group that just skipped the entire event, as long as you have a mount you can just hop the wall &gt;&lt;
---
ok to be honest I never noticed that when I used it, but also I quickly disabled all that and laid everything out my own way.
---
I'm good with either as long as they give us some harder dungeons either way. I'm still having a blast but everything is just too easy on the 1.12 patch. 
---
Only Naxx and maybe AQ are going to provide any real challenge. 
---
So either TBC at a patch that doesn't make things too easy or new Vanilla content that adds more challenge. 
---
Heroic versions of vanilla 5 man dungeons might be a cool idea. 
---
Your criticisms of TBC are valid but I still think it had the best raids and 5 man content so I have no problem playing that again. Of course I'd also welcome brand new content.
---
&gt;raid slots
---
And druid gear drops ALL THE BLOODY TIME as well. It's insane.
---
Me, personally, I'd LOVE tbc and then wrath. Realized this last night
---
The goblin literally says he can open the door if he doesn't die. You talk to him and he opens the door.
---
yeah, that's why TBC is my favorite version of wow too. it straddles the line the best. it changes some things that I don't like (it started the trend of dungeons mostly being corridors, and badges meant people mostly just ran 3 or so of the easiest dungeons for faster badges; it also started the trend of each zone being more or less entirely self contained), but it's the best we've got imo.
---
https://youtu.be/rkLvKL1I7Tw
---
I use this build with 3k hp and 5400 mana, without even needing mana crystal most of the time. Also it's a lot more fun and engaging than blizzarding imo
---
&lt;Seventh Watch&gt; is looking for guild members. We will be focusing on raids and would like to start ASAP. Raid times will be Thursday night 10PM-1AM PST and Saturday night 10PM-1AM PST. Whisper players Nayru or Grash
---
The people who creates dark souls dungeons needs to make wows dungeons.
---
thats funny. since in retail you dont do any of that. you join LFG and mash buttons til its over. but in classic you do look up how to do certain things. you just keep failing lol.
---
Me and my wife saw a ton of these sorts while looking for gaming themed cakes and we kind of despise them. If it's just to be cute that's fine and it's well made, but if it actually is meant to mean something it seems like a bad start, whether it be that he actually plays a selfish / unhealthy amount or she resents him for playing at all.
---
The only thing in my marriage that pulled me away from Classic was that Borderlands 3 came out and we had to play it together...
---
git gud
---
I don't understand - just get a pally to bubble pull :)
---
Imagine that thinking you have to look stuff up for a game that holds your hand and gives you everything but not for Classic with its unspecific quests that give you vague ideas of where stuff is.
---
the second wat  
---
is there a picture of this
---
Met a great group of people that play on the same schedule as me. We all leveled up together since SM. We're all in full pre bis in the same guild, still having a blast. Loot comes and loot goes, it's the friends and experiences that stay with you.
---
I’ve run more than a few dungeons where I’ve lost  rolls on 4-6 upgrades then won the rolls on 4-6 nice BOPs that no one wanted.  Wasn’t happy.
---
tldr holy FUCK
---
Durotar from Darnassuss isnt ecen half way across Kalimdor
---
Never had a problem playing with deaf people in the 15 years I've played wow. I honestly wouldn't even tell the guild leader about your friends deafness. Just have him hop in discord and if anything is said he needs to know whisper him in game.
---
Maybe for some late AQ 40 and naxx raids it would be difficult if they can't hear commands and adjust on the fly but for the content we have no it should be no issue what so ever.
---
Fire runed grimoire is garbage for pve compared to the spirit. You would want one of the raid offhands for pvp though, but for pve they dont beat the 20 sp
---
Alliance ganking horde again I see.
---
Gear reslly doesnt matter that much until layer levels. You'll get perfectly good levelling gear from quests and whatnot.
---
Get yourself the Lesser Magic Wand though. It's dirt cheap and really good for the level.
---
My wife and i are doing the same, just make sure you are in an inn at log out, and his ass is outside. That rested exp makes a diffrence
---
Well then you got the classic experience noob
---
Healbot is working well for me. Haven't tried any other ones.
---
Cheers
---
Use both.
---
Get used to stance dancing and weapon swapping from now on to truly master the Warrior.
---
Or just look it up on wow head quick
---
Bridge is out.
---
Pwned!
---
Classic + with TBC content
---
Skeram Alliance
---
...Yes it does. The entire point is to mock people that constantly regurgitate a very common sentiment. See: orange man bad.
---
bind ur spells
---
its frustrating to never win anything, when it seems everyone else wins all the time. which is why im very happy my guild has loot council. i trust their judgement. no more bad luck :P
---
Heteros are so strange. Who would want your WEDDING be like “haha me and my wife have inherently antagonistic feelings towards how I spend my time and that’s gonna turn into resentment real quick women amirite haha”
---
Flying didnt kill pvp. If that were true then mounts in classic kill pvp because they just ride away.
---
Yeah *definitely* going to need this over updated addons and databases.
---
Really?? Man that's so strange.. So you can wear the items but the set bonus itself doesn't apply even though the conditions are met...
---
That's a new one for me. Thanks for the heads up
---
I got Tidal charm yesterday from just logging off there occasionally. Was about to leave for work and figured I had enough time to check. As soom as I logged on, I hit my macro and bam! He was... Somewhere. Fortunately I'm a hunter and my pet found him and brought him to me. First kill on him got me the Tidal charm.
---
Features put in the game to make people like you leave.
---
I've made a ton of gold by vendoring items with underpriced mats
---
But he’s right.  In classic an epic mount costs 900 gold.  It’s a bit of a grind to get but very doable in a reasonable time frame.  Most people in my casual guild has their epic mount, for instance.
---
If we used your 1 = 5,000 figure, then we’re looking at 4.5 million Gold which is not easy to grind even in retail.  Grinding out the ~200k for a token is a bit of a grind, but very doable in a month, but sure as shit not 4,500,000 gold.
---
9 water essences in one water walk cast (10 min).
---
Abusive loot council... Check
---
as a ele shaman, I need on cloth gear that provide me good stats
---
Pretty sure I'm using Leatrix Plus for this:
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/leatrix-plus
---
It has lots of options/utility. You need to activate most of it, so pick through the options.
---
Not sure the map would really work w/o flying at all. Maybe just restrict it to like 30 seconds at a time or something.
---
I created macros for lower ranked spells.
---
exactly what I was looking for thank you!
---
Blizzard released Classic WoW.
---
You'll be fine.
---
Practice is just flat out playing the game. A fighter gets a really good right hook from throwing them 1000 times. Rogue is one of those classes that are very repetitive when it comes to pvp. We open, stun lock, reset, and kill upon re open. You’ll get the rhythm down like a heart beat after hundreds reps. You won’t need to look at your energy or combo points. The reactive stuff is what makes a rogue good but first you need to know a good situation from a bad situation and how to dig yourself out or keep riding the advantage. Have fun man and put in the hours (: you’ll come along.
---
&gt; It was my experience that people who were interested in world pvp got it, and people who didn't want to engage, didn't have to.
---
Well there in lies a difference in what we think of world pvp. 
---
I think world pvp is specifically something that you shouldn’t be able to avoid, if you’re on a pvp server that is. Any excursion outside of city walls makes you a target. To me that’s the nature of the faction war and is the excitement and danger of traveling in the open world. 
---
If you don’t want to engage in pvp, you should, as you did, play on a pve server. I think on people pvp servers that people got preoccupied with getting things done as efficiently as possible, which meant flying to objectives and nodes, thus avoiding pvp.
---
Ah, I’m in entitled Fairbanks alliance
---
I thought keyring was Phase 2?
---
Probably just have to grind a bit longer to become orange with them again. Shouldn't be a huge deal unless you were grinding in the timbermaw cave.
---
We had to have a last minute readjust killing mobs to get within a quest turn-in of each other.
---
315 doesn't resist 100% of the knock backs
---
Ahh, you're our rival alliance guild LOL
---
I’m comparing it the 5m gold BfA long neck mount specifically. The dino and your classic epic mount is the maximum amount of gold getting taken out of the economy outright in both retail and classic respectively. I see these as pretty direct comparisons to each games “ideal” economic state as they are dev set prices for the biggest status symbol available. 1k to ride at 100%, 5m to lazily check the AH god knows where.
---
When you mount up in classic, in my experience I end up running into more enemy players or mobs that dismount me.
---
Flying, that’s it, you’re gone. 
---
On top of this you have to take into account while going about on your mount, you can be dismounted, run into enemy players etc.
---
On flying you legit just fly over everything with no interaction.
---
Not very, unless you farmed them it's just a tiny amount of the other side you'll need to kill more of in the long rep grind.
---
Frens hell this is my server and I’ve grouped with you guys several times! -Donutlad
---
Facial hair AND eyebrows on a Night Elf?!?!? Sacrilege.
---
Better delete and start over
---
Welp seems better than being on Kirotonos 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
RealMobHealth
---
Always hurts to hear that, can be replaced by AQ by warrs.  Meanwhile it's BiS for shamans until BC.
---
Damnit, rolling an alt on Bigglesworth alliance now
---
No
---
If you ain't no punk, holler "we want prenups!"
---
You're not going to find any sympathy here. You have two options:
---
A) This game is ancient, look up a guide.
---
or
---
B) Learn organically and lose what, an hour of your time? That's what the game was like originally. 
---
Take your lumps and gtfo like the rest of us who weren't looking up guides.
---
Yeah, I think people are still stuck in the nostalgia mindset when they were noobs playing vanilla in its hay day and most people didn’t quite know what to do.   Now everyone knows exactly what’s going to happen and the strats for fights are well known, we have BiS lists and know what stats are best for what talent builds.  Hell, we even know what consumables to hoard in preparation for future content.
---
Who knows what the consensus is its anecdotal really. The vast majority never visit forums or reddit and drop input.
---
My money is on TBC and the Wotlk, I wouldn't be surprised if they are planning it now given the time it will take. But they'll leave some classic servers as well. 
---
It makes the most sense business wise, it's the least risk and the least amount of work for Blizz. Plus they know it was popular and people liked it up to Wotlk. Then they spin up new Classic servers again and start the race all over. 
---
I'd actually be fairly surprised if they develope new content for Classic plus I've got no faith the current team wouldnt mess it up. Just look at retails direction and changes.
---
We will have to see over the next 6 months but they'll need to make a call at least internally soon. They dont want to lose the hype or the subs.
---
I'm on Ally atiesh.  My guilds not quite doing mc yet but will start soon.  I'm sure we would be glad have y'all.  Pm if you want an invite.
---
You lose 100 rep per kill, when you **kill** the timbermaw. (I believe). It’s 5-6(??) rep per kill when killing the others to gain rep **with** the Timbermaw. 
---
Sooooo.
---
On that, I don't know. I haven't be using down ranked spells. Still leveling.
---
I though that was the case but i saw a Shaman with a bunch of MC gear doing that so i though maybe that's how you play the class.
---
First mage didn't get PI. Meanwhile all the top priests did.
---
Also, PI over a 1 minute fight is a 5% DPS increase. Not nearly enough to make a difference there.
---
Thank you. Well you never know how these things turn out. But i feel confident that the leadership is unbiased based on how loot has been distributed so far and how transparent they are. Also i like these people a lot. And we have a 20+ age requirement.
---
How long does this event last? Man i hope it stays long enough until i can buy some time
---
the timbermaw FBI is hunting you down as we speak.  you fucked up kid
---
I think they both have their pros and cons.
---
In about 10 years time a pumpkin or other vegetable/fruit with such a hole carved in it might not be so cute...
---
Is your guild from Kronos3? :)
---
Confirmed. TBC/wrath are actual good, well made games.
---
Vanilla is nice, sure, but its full of blizzard's mistakes.
---
As a resto shaman, hunters are honestly my favorite DPS to see in any dungeon group aside from boomkins (personal bias) and exactly one mage (water). Gone are the days of the huntard and nearly every hunter I've run into this time around is patient, friendly, and knowledgeable. Feigning *before* they pull aggro, using pet to taunt a mob that the tank missed off on me until he can pick them up, aspect of the pack whenever we need to backtrack, spotting rarespawns with tracking, kiting/trapping on demand... my experience with hunters has been great. As for the other classes:
---
- Fury warriors are the worst, refusing to tank while simultaneously chasing meters so hard that they always end up tanking anyway and hoovering up my mana.
---
- Rogues have the same attitude but it manifests differently: they refuse to attack skull because they won't be able to build up 5 combo points on it so instead they attack (and end up tanking) literally anything else, once again hoovering up my mana.
---
- Mages have *great* tools but the class attracts the absolute worst attitudes in the game. 90% of the interparty drama I've witnessed has been started by, or at least involved, a mage.
---
- Warlocks... it seems like one out of every two has no idea how a bandage or a roast chicken works, and will just stand there like a lump at 10% hp while I'm drinking. I *want* to like you! You're the player who didn't roll mage! But having free water sure would make me feel better about compensating for your consumables allergy...
---
- Ferals pretty much always get pigeonholed into tanking, and boomies are usually hyper-aware of their negative reputation and do everything they can to overcome it. Honestly, druids in general just tend to be really, really good players.
---
- Allow me to describe both specs of DPS shaman in short: *"Hahaha, I have HUGE random burst and NOOO defensive cooldowns! ...Rez please."* Aside from that, though, they're usually pretty chill.
---
- Priest are... hm. Actually, shadow priests are the fucking *best.* Probably because, like boomkins, they know the reputation so when they finally get a dungeon where they don't have to heal they pull out all the stops.
---
Woof, that was long-winded. But yeah, give me a party of hunters, druids, and priests any time. As far as I'm concerned, you guys are the real MVPs.
---
Been wondering the same thing. I think it would depend if you have core leather gloves / muggers belt. If have both of those I think CHT better but if only one distracting dagge takes the lead
---
Guild banks remove a ton of interaction and community from guilds and the game and is a very very bad idea. 
---
Getting to know your guild mates, which professions they have and who stocks what is an integral part of the community experience.
---
LetMeCast
---
AOE looting.
---
Jealous.
---
Irregardless of if you want these changes or not, I still wouldnt recommend retail to anyone.
---
Another excellent play by the Alliance to reduce the Horde playerbase! Quickly now we must act as wingmen for hordies!
---
Up til recently we had 2 reliable mages. We seem to be atypical but we just came seem to get mages to stay with the game. 
---
 Now we have 5, and probably will get 1-2 more and that seems like a sweet point.
---
Except the 5m mount is for the ultra rich of retail, and not for the common player.  They started this in wrath with the traveling tundra mammoth.  It’s suppose to be a symbol of your wealth.
---
The 900 gold mount in retail isn’t really a status symbol as it’s pretty expected that everyone’s main will have it.  The epic mounts are getting pretty common in classic even now, where as the 5m gold mount is no where near common.
---
But are they actually playing because of nostalgia, or are they playing because it's a good game? The vast majority of people I talk to are still playing the game because it's fun to them. The game holds up remarkably well considering its age.
---
TBC might be a short term cash grab to keep milking content with basically zero development expenditure but I know it leads the game down the wrong path for me at least. Most of my friend group agree, and some of them logged 10 years on retail.
---
Lol.. all horde are rivals :)
---
Sulfuras, Horde. Any guilds like this?
---
Hybrid classes to being more utility.  
---
Not necessarily more dps but at least be able to offer more as a boomkin then the 3% crit increase. Stuff like faerie fire (balance): increases all spells against target by 2% or moonkin aura: spell crit gives a portion of the spell cost or mana regen for a short time.
---
I think what defines a ruined game is entirely subjective, thus making this list kind of pointless. From my point of view, several would be considerable changes that would change the meta forever.
---
Bit of a sidenote, but Arcane **IS** viable. Most of our mages run Arcane power, as boss fights are fast enough to where it makes sense atm. This change would only serve to buff what is arguably the strongest class to yet further heights.
---
Ait, have your group take 5x the time to form because of your inflexible mind. Druids level feral 1-60, does that mean that druids can't roll on healing gear at all unless they say so? What about rogues? They level with swords because of the ease of access, do they also have to tell people beforehand that they want daggers from a dungeon because they currently have swords, even though they had no other options than swords? Oh and what about warriors with twohanders?? Do they also have to say that they're rolling on 1h weapons because they leveled with 2handers?
---
In Canada, 79.3% of court-ordered custody are mother exclusive custody, whereas father exclusive account for 6.6%. But hey, yeah sure, I guess I follow Jordan Peterson too heh
---
Just go play retail
---
9 is insane, best i ever got was 6
---
I've been picking them up as I level up so I have some when I need
---
Had to tell my wife to drown her self after she did just this, and spent 45 mins trying to find the "hidden ways up" pretty sure there is not.
---
Nah definitely not. In our guild only protection potions for Faerlina were mandatory. For Loatheb we used Ony+ZG buff, I don't think DM or Rend was used.
---
Gold was a big issue back then so you were only expected to bring mana, health and protection potions. Everything else was up to you but we were using lootcouncil so there was a pressure to use pots. 
---
Even then people rarely used all possible buffs/potions. Only our MT was as buffed up as the average player in MC is now.
---
Patch 2.0 talent trees. Yes I play Ret Paladin
---
Blacksmithing makes the best pre-raid 2 hander. Blacksmith makes THE best dps plate helm in the entire game... Yup blacksmithing sucks alright.
---
Unless it's a guild run, that healer will fuck off long before the druid can realistically get the loot. Then next group will have a new healer and so on, don't you see how that is not only problematic, but also incredibly unfair? He is tanking the dungeon, filling the role that has to do the most work by far and the role that takes several times longer to find a player for than another healer. If anything the group should be thankful that he's willing to tank and be fully okay with him rolling against the healer.
---
Yeah what he said.
---
Lol high pop server “dead” fuck me you are stupid.
---
Doesn’t matter if all we do is heal. That’s our role in classic. Just like your roll is to hand out water and drop us portals.
---
Hi, /u/Voov24

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dnoj8m/mage_dps_stat_priority_how_much_spell_damage_is_1/).

Way to ignore 2/3 of the comment, like the significant portion with the assumption that the female lacks financial independence.
---
Did STV arena break today? We had a big fight at 3:00 server time and just as we were about to leave the goblin yelled and started walking *again* at 3:08, apparently spawning a second chest but we already hearthed by then.
---
Now it's 10 minutes past 6:00 and the goblin isn't moving.
---
What nameplate addon is that?
---
Yeah, a game trying to simulaye a fantasy world where you have to purchase arrows is a bad decision.
---
Or maybe letting every character be proficient in every playstyle at any given time is too.
---
Bad game design in a tactical game? Maybe.
---
Bad game design in a role playing game? Nope.
---
Don't be so salty. All were saying is that whatever spec each person is contributing to the party should take priority over anyone's secondary plans. If you're not currently healing the group (5m) then it's bullshit that the actual healer has to roll against you. 
---
It's as simple as clearing it ahead of time. If the group is fine with it and you made your intentions known ahead of time, that's great. No one is gonna say that's a bad idea at all. 
---
All anyone is saying is that your intentions should never be a surprise for the actual healer. And if they object, you should yield to their needs, or you yourself should find a different group (don't punish them).
---
Ok THX . Wont start until i Give some profit
---
Blood elves are close but have no place in the horde. 
---
Draenei are space goats who literally crashed into this world from their actual spaceship. I can't think of any other race more oddly inserted into wow.
---
aw, thank you. Everyone just runs around saying HUNTARDS and that hunters bring nothing to the group (which is extreeeeeeemely inaccurate, but can't fix stupid lol)
---
A common sentiment can still be accurate. It's not automatically false just because it's repeated.
---
Because hand of rags is not BiS and is basically an expensive wardrobe item that isn't important to guild progression so if you want to be cursed with buying the mats to craft it, you will get it.
---
Lol now I am going to jump off so I can test this.
---
I can't tell if this person is 12 years old or on some heavy drugs or bipolar. Maybe all three?
---
That's so awesome! Gz
---
Like most things it depends. 
---
If you had Tribal LW and skinning a few weeks ago on my server  you were instantly rich.  I had my Epic mount the same day I turned 60 solely because of it.  DS leather was sky high because the zerg was in need of DS set.
---
Demand and price are down now but they still sell with minimal effort.  As a rogue, I’ve yet to find better gold per hour.  Farming DS leather is also hands down the most fun way to farm for me.  Lots of PvP and player interaction.  You don’t even need to farm the leather to make money if u can craft.  It’s easy to just buy mats and still make 20-30 gold crafting.
---
“A whole bar” lol that’s perfect. My buddies and I would end up a level and a half apart sometimes
---
I haven't really been able to decide what professions to go with on Druid. I'm going HotW/NS spec and want to try to do a bit of everything (dungeons/raids/pvp etc), but I do plan to focus on feral tanking. I'm going to power level enchanting to get smoking heart of the mountain, but am not really sure what to take after I drop enchanting. I'm assuming mining/engineering is the safest for both pve and pvp? Or would herbalism/alch be nice?
---
Druid imo. Travel speed is a given with 30% boost when you get cat (with talents) and 40% with travel form at 30. Tanking dungeons is ezpz after you figure it out(meaning you can dungeon pretty much whenever you want), same with healing if you get the gear but a little harder to find a dungeon/easier to find a raid at 60. Fishing pools is ez money with aquatic form/ pick up mining to double up while in azshara. Leveling is easy solo, amazing in group. Pick up gnomish engineering amd have teleports to both ends of kalimdor(im alliance so may be some bias there)
---
Im sure mage is up there with ports and free water. Get tailoring for cheapish gear before you start farming bis. Getting gear in raid will be more contested.
---
I made a warrior alt tho and spamming charge while running feels like i move hella fast. Im cheating him tho i spent gold for pots/elixirs/greens/enchants/powerleveling first aid.
---
I think this is what people are hoping for if Classic+ becomes a thing
---
That's a little harsh. I think they're both dumb.
---
Nice try, OP’s alt reddit account.
---
Isn’t that just a quest scorpion?
---
There’s only one explanation (not really)... he’s cheating on you! (In wow)

I thought it was every 3 or 6 hours on the hour. Not every hour..
---
Infected. RUN
---
Yeah. Even in jest like this, the suggestion that one partner should give up their passions to please the other is unfunny and probably a sign of an unhealthy relationship. My wife might not enjoy all the same things I do, but she would never want to take them away from me.  The important thing is balancing those things with the relationship. If your hobbies are more important to you than your partner, that's not healthy either.
---
You don’t understand cats at all then my friend.
---
Sulfuras is only BIS for pvp.
---
K here me out. It's the best weapon outside mc  it's the worst weapon drip inside mc  it's got a 2 ppm amd a 18 percent proc chance. It's not a terrible weapon
---
Letmecast, yes. Also stands your character up so you can cast
---
Def and maldoron recently lauded the 30/0/21 spec I will proceed with it, NS does seem extremely versatile for either burst dps or healing.
---
Same.  Did a bit of time in the beta and was having enough fun to open the launch day account.
---
When the comment is funnier than the post
---
Well yeah, or you could just vendor the greens. I’d imagine disenchanting might up the value slightly, but then you have to sell the mats on ah.  
---
I’d rather avoid ah to make things simple, and you can get a useful profession like engineering instead.
---
Seconded on the Leatrix recommendation. Can't play without it. Max zoom out, autodismount, you'll find something in it you want no doubt.
---
Quality content. Keep it up you deserve the updoots!
---
People that call people cringy are...
---
there is a slight difference, hollows end candy, doesn't infact give you underwater breathing, it removes your need to breath. potentially functions the same but it seems like it may allow you to breath under lava as it isn't "water breathing" but "ceased breathing"
---
Okay so whatever you are currently doing dictates what you need. Warriors are far more effective in dungeons whilst specced arms and using a 2hander, should you be surprised when that warrior rolls on dal'rends? Should you be surprised when your rogue wants perditions blade even though he went swords for pre-raid (as he should)? If anything, the healer should find a new group, because they are way easier to replace than a tank. His inflexibility would fuck the entire group.
---
Stam is more important in pvp. I'd say the opposite.
---
In classic? I know you can pull up basic maps with boss locations, but can you make it show routes, and/or integrate with your normal map?
---
Make Istanbul Constantinople Again
---
Marks to turn in for rep I guess
---
Haha what’s up man! This video is so epic!
---
I switched to holy at 40
---
It's useless. Have a 60 hunter, and I just bought the devilsaur set at 60 anyways.... it would be more of a pain to try and farm it if anything.
---
PvP yo
---
But in the grand scheme, Cata was before the game was dumbed down to death.
---
It's absolutely nothing like the unfailable loot treadmill skinner-box that the "casual" tier of BFA content has become.
---
Like, I don't think they realize at Blizz, but the fact that titanforging warfront gear was available absolutely burned out countless players who fell for that mindless grind including me. Combine that with the Azerite grind, expansion-level gear resets every raid tier and it's all just disgusting.
---
And despite all of that effort to cater to casuals I'm **certain** that Classic is a more compelling experience for casual players in the long run. 
---
I honestly think they're the ones that get the most out of classic.
---
Brutal
---
LOL. Never even considered farming that. Mystical Orb of Frozen wrath, 30G
---
It should work... I buff alliance players all the time and I see arcane intellect on them.
---
I didn't say it was false dude. What are you confused about here?
---
Arent you missing like 2/3rds of your spells? Where are they?
---
What haha? Most top guilds have a similar environment to this with lots of banter and fun.
---
The toxic elitist guilds are usually middle of the pack guilds from my experience.
---
Imagine doing that for literally only buffing your side spells. Frozen wrath orbs less than 50g
---
I started to *really really really* buy them in the early days of legion when they were 60-80k and it was REAL easy to make money.
---
Go hunter, they can kill enemies nonstop.
---
Keep that til you can get mirahs song offhand, only upgrade to dal rend set or like krol blade/sword of zeal mh or raid tier weapons, if you want to go daggers for raiding, get barman shanker and distracting dagger.
---
Yeah, and then maybe after a while of feeling compelled to run trivialized content for a tiny chance of a luck roll would utterly suck the soul out of the game.
---
JK I know which one it is and why I quit BFA.
---
Well yes, there are weapons with better stats for PvP too. But it is worth it for the flex.
---
Depends on if any mages on your server really want it who don't raid. Stats wise it's worse than Banthoks, slightly better for pvp...but worse than the pvp belt that comes out next phase.
---
And that's why you'd never be a GM. He's not Exploiting the game. You'd warn and ban people for Mind Controlling other players off of stuff too?
---
Genius. I know what I'm doing tonight! :D
---
GHOST BLOWJOB WOO WOO
---
/cast fear undead
---
/cast flash heal for those scars
---
Don't forget bubble hearth /kiss if need be
---
Very cool setep well done
---
The only thing you can do to kill them is stun them in caster or cat form and pray for crits + procs. If you don't get both, then you barely dent them while they heal to full and start wearing you down. 
---
Even if you get crits and procs during a stun, they can NS heal to full health, and now you have no way of stopping them from running away to heal. Druids regen their mana while fighting in bear form, meanwhile you constantly have to keep yourself in the 5 second rule in order to deal any damage, so your mana will run out first. Druids will win the long game as long as they play smart and they don't let themselves get blown up in a stun.
---
I know at least in BC people all gathered in front of OG on PvE servers to duel with one another. Alliance and Horde alike
---
You need to go to power and energy settings and disable automatic graphics switching. That or install boot camp, which you will get better performance out of the GPU.
---
But like still kind of salt tho
---
Played time?
---
sounds like one hell of a week :P
---
Hey dudes! Silvite Soltis here and I'm back with another gearing guide! With so many people rolling warriors with the intention of getting "dem big crits," I felt like it was finally time to cover this class/spec and help prospective berserkers to get geared decently enough to enter raids, FAST!
---
See the written guide here: [https://silvitesoltis.blogspot.com/2019/10/gear-your-dps-warrior-fast-simplified.html](https://silvitesoltis.blogspot.com/2019/10/gear-your-dps-warrior-fast-simplified.html)
---
Must be alliance then as I’ve seen more than one vendor in BB
---
SKOL!
---
it's not as bad as people make it  out to be
---
In PVP you can pretty much play anything, everyspec is decent
---
In dungeons, some meme specs like paladin tanks are actually not bad here. everything is ok in dungeons since bad specs are usualy bad due to their high mana usage in long boss fights.
---
In raid there is one unplayable spec : tank paladin
---
A few bad but not unplayable specs : ret, elemental, enhancement, boomkin.
---
Shadow and feral dps are pretty good early on but become bad specs in later tiers
---
[https://i.gyazo.com/289a05fd69a336ad9fcdea84ee0f94fb.png](https://i.gyazo.com/289a05fd69a336ad9fcdea84ee0f94fb.png) I wouldn't call those bad specs "unplayable" because they have 20% less dps than locks, they also have decent utility.
---
Litteraly everything else in the game is great  in raids.
---
so true. im having such a blast, especially playing a lot with RL friends from way back (like elementary and middle school).
---
They’ve got good travel speed with Aspect if cheetah/pack
---
Holy shit, I see so many horrible ideas that would outright ruin the game here. Completely killed any drive I had to get classic+, I now sincerely hope they just do TBC instead.
---
the guy has no reason to be there
---
he's CLEARLY griefing
---
griefing gets punished. end of story
---
I had the same problem a couple months ago.  Started healing again last week and downloaded latest healbot version.  Seems to work now.  I'm using healing touch 10, 9, 5, and 4.  No issues.
---
That's not how it works though, because even if you are familiar with how it works, they could just claim that they aren't. Because of that, Blizzard has to punish all abusers equally. If someone reports this guy through sending a ticket, it's very likely that he will have his progress on AGM rerolled.
---
You sound pretty insecure
---
Just have your friend join discord. He never has to say anything.
---
"So anyway, I won't have time to play in the coming weeks. My wife is in the hospital battling cancer, and our son has been missing a lot of school due to mental health issues.
---
"Hunter weapon or what, Am I right guys?? Haha"
---
I would strongly advise against doing this as it's clearly spawning more than intended. You will get rolled back and potentially temp banned if this issue keeps on occuring and more people abuse it.
---
Implying looking up information on the game NEVER happened in 2005 and isn't something you should do...
---
No no, the lava is really quite enjoyable... hop in ;)
---
Nah, certain things just arent balanced because the talent is balanced  for people with more health. I remember when 3.0 came out and ret finally became viable, ret paladins would absolutely RUN THROUGH anyone because their new abilities did so much damage, it didnt matter if you were good or not, that ret was going to get you with insanely high burst, you basically got globaled. Once wotlk released though, yeah it was still strong but it fell in line.
---
It is not efficent, but with downranking you can make it heal decently while mainly just spamming heal.
---
Griefing is actually totally allowed.
---
No counter play? Open your eyes maybe? If you're close enough to talk to the flightmaster, you're also more than close enough to see him.
---
Well it sure isnt getting any of the specific loot i made the dungeon group for.
---
I have gotten 8 orbs out of Strat
---
Yeah. Some are locked behind rep though.
---
Both dalrends in 3h. Both HoJ and cape of the black baron in 2h.
---
It's weird because once I run a place once, I memorized the entire layout. I thought everyone was like this until I saw all the people saying they get lost in WC all the time.
---
Little did I know I have a hidden superpower.
---
the same amount for both 11-14%
---
I've got 3 Halloween Bags (16 slots) on my lvl 55 priest. From running the odd BRD trash farm, im not sure how rare they are but I sure feel lucky
---
level 55 following
---
There are spell coefficients that influence how much bonus healing (or damage) each spell casted. Renew does get 100% so you are correct, but not all spells are like this.
---
Worth it though, enough to remember anyways.
---
I love those runs as much as any. Trying your hardest in groups and still failing means your heart is likely pumping.
---
Mixing swords and daggers is almost always a bad idea unless for some reason one is waaaaaaay better than the other. 
---
Don't buy gut ripper. 
---
Thrash will carry you until 60 - you could even raid with it if you have no luck getting other weapons. It's honestly quite decent. 
---
Dagger skills will feel shit unless you are specced into them in your talent tree anyway. 
---
Daggers are definitely viable and do pretty great damage if you gear properly but honestly I'd avoid it until your lvl 60 and all you are doing is group content as swords is definitely better for solo mob killing.
---
Petrified Leaf and Black Dragon Sinew drop within hours of each other in different pugs. I win both times out of four or five hunters. On my birthday.
---
Give paladins a taunt. I don't even play Alliance anymore but it seems like such a huge oversight to have a tanking class with no taunt.
---
It will run at max settings.
---
You can easily spec full arcane fire for pvp. But fire is useless in raiding, and mages are boring to play in MC, it's just frostbolt.
---
Bridge is closed.
---
I forgot all about this area. 
---
From what I can Google it was likely meant to be a quest outpost.
---
You can just giiiiit out
---
I loved TBC, although it did introduce the first fatal flaw into WoW; the Arena.
---
The Arena was what started destroying the previous sense of community and people being good to each other, because it flooded the game with Counterstrike players who viewed instances like deathmatch maps which could be entered or left at any time.
---
Deathmatch FPS is also inherently competitive, whereas classic or vanilla WoW is primarily about co-operation.  Blizzard introduced the Arena in order to offer the FPS demographic something, but the problem is that because the two groups' thinking is so radically different, they started to destroy the game.
---
So while I'd like to see a relaunch of TBC, it would have to be without the Arena.
---
Strat Live side before the rats on the left side. Someone told me in game that a rogue/ druid friend should scout for you and enter from Undead side and stealth over to Live to check if he is up. 
---
Maybe invis pots would work - or if a warlock use eye of Kilrogg, but the eye would probably aggro something tbh.
---
That raid was the turning point for me. Had to drag myself back to see inside ICC and quit until Classic shortly after. It really was such a downgrade after how AMAZING Ulduar was. Felt like they slapped it together in a few hours. Also that was when they added the attempt limit to hard mode as an artificial time gate since the fights weren't actually hard at all...
---
I was questing in the Blasted Lands and randomly came across a rare spawn...there were a bunch of people doing the same various kill animals quests so not only was I surprised to tag a mob but it was a rare.
---
Killed it and got a meh green (something unpopular like agility or strength and spirit).
---
But right after I somewhat dejectedly loot the corpse I tag another beast...just normal random one.
---
It drops Bloodrazor.
---
I've had purples in the past as quest rewards but never as a random droop.

So much this
---
Did any of you guys die? This happened to me. Leveling partner got ahead because I was the one tanking. If I died he’d stay alive and sometimes kill the mob and get xp while I was ghost running back.
---
Even though everyone hated WoD, I oddly enjoyed my little gold farms. It led to me playing every class to max level. 
---
But then I got too hyped about legion and blew all my gold on expensive stuff in the first few weeks of it lol
---
you must be mad
---
I thought it was one of the better 2h weapons like period.
---
You didn't play beta did you?
---
When undead were considered undead they were getting obliterated by Paladins. 
---
It may not make sense from a wording stand point but from a game balance stand point it's better like this.
---
he has multiple spawn locations I think
---
I love playing Mage but it's so boring to cast Frostbolt over and over in raids. I like them much more in five mans and pvp.
---
Def not high demand for raids. I'm a War and have yet to see a single raid not full of them and declining them.
---
I'd say Shamans are one of the most sought after right now for raids because they have the highest ratio of played to demand. Raids need them and they 2nd least played class behind Druids (which aren't really wanted in raids besides for maybe 1).
---
I'd say overall:
---
1: Shaman
---
2: Probably Locks
---
3: Probably Druids just because there's only like 2 per server.
---
I was gonna say a good way to get over him is to join LFG. You’ll be in the dungeon in no time ;)
---
Bartender4 very customizable. Has all kinds of adjustments to size and shape.
---
except you post an example where there IS counterplay
---
I think if *that* is your definition of a non-linear dungeon then.. theres not that many non-linear dungeons in vanilla to begin with. But I would consider WC to be non-linear, the difference between it and BRD is simply that its shorter.
---
Wat
---
They stopped playing on K3 when Classic was announced.
---
Bought krol yesterday for 300g, they go around 500g on my server.
---
Pissed bro
---
Two days ago I did the test of skull. On the second trash mob in winter spring Mature Blue Dragon Sinew dropped.
---
To think it was in beta for Vanilla but they scratched it just before launch, gah! I'd really like a button to press too!
---
2
---
Lf1m ubrs dal rend MH res
---
Most census put it at 60/40 favouring horde on Yojamba.
---
You didn't specify whether NA or EU, but ashbringer on EU is a decently big server and it was a perfect 50/50 and it's still rather balanced, maybe ever so slightly tilted towards alliance now. Also keep in mind that horde has MANY MANY MANY more PvPers than alliance, so for BGs in phase 3 you're likely to run into long queues as horde and insta queue pops as alliance. On retail it has often been a 30 sec to 2 min queue for alliance and 8-15 for horde, and I would expect it to be similar on classic.
---
Just saying renew has a 100% spell coefficient
---
All you have to do is run your party up the stairs and jump to platform in the back behind the cages. Wait like 30 second and he will de-aggro and go blow open the door.
---
Just happened to work out that we had 2 druid tanks, and all casters besides a enhance shaman who didn't roll need on them for whatever reason.
---
ThOsE wErE BaD Pvp PlAyErs though according to the guy I replied to lmao.  
---
But yeah it was absurd. Pallies were a joke and then suddenly they were sweeping the fields clean with a single press of a button that whirlwinded everything around them. I wouldve been mad, but eh I felt like they earned a few days of fun after being a meh spec for pvp for the entire expac.
---

Wait, there is some kind of letter? Starting a quest?

i dont think fall damage or drowning give durability hits either.

HAHA WOW A MIND CONTROL POST? ON REDDIT? HAHA WOW!!!!!

That's the real shame here, you see this once and you can easily teach the rest of your group how to do it.

I spat my water all over the keyboard now from reading this
---
Haha, your post come up as one of the first results based on what I searched for. Figured it might help someone. Still rocking your priest?
---
I'd like heroic dungeons, with higher drop chance of boes, and more gold.
---
They do, you have to download it separate. It’s call atlasloot maps or something, it’s on the curse website
---
That's the point.  He does't want to play retail again.  What's the worst case scenario?  Come back next expansion and have to run some old content naked to afford enough gear to start questing for greens that are probably already better than what he sold.
---
That's the difference. Lol
---
Nope and some classes have more class quests than others
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
The one that last 1 hour also casts on your entire party and requires a reagent (or the priest one does at least)

How dose taunt work on ragnaros? We killed him tonight and when ever he was taunted as soon as it wore of he went to the previous tank who had the most threat. Is it only fixating rag and not changing threat levels?
---
They are funny for the first few times. Not so after it.
---
Flying is the only thing I disagree with in TBC while the rest of game was beautiful. Flight paths could solve that severance.
---
I loved both vanilla and TBC. Wotlk was still great but I couldn't stand gear score and LFG.
---
And it buffs all party members at once
---
An undead ganking lowbies, what else is new
---
I'm tired of people saying stuff like this. I'm a Rogue and it's easy to get in a group if you just use resources: LFG/discord/guild etc
---
Well most calls are generic. Unless you have a specific assignment, you just do your roles job. You make the things die, or you make the green bars go up. If there’s things to dispel, then get rid of them. Easy peasy.
---
Nope. Didn’t want everyone asking me to heal (I healed for 6 years of wow and got so bored of it). So I was gonna go hunter for ease and good pvp. But then I talked to a guy online and got talked into going warrior. I’m level 50 now and been loving every second of it.
---
The levitate effect/costumr actually makes you immune to fall damage.
---
I've heard on some servers you need to outright let them decay sometimes to send the message.  It's not too crazy contested on mine though.  I actually think I'm fortunate in the sense that I had someone ninja my skin very early in my farming attempts, so it really set the message in stone for me.
---
Meanwhile, as a Prot spec tank, I get people mailing me potions of all kinds, blacksmiths making me mithril plate armor and spurs for free, and Priests messaging me as soon as I log in, asking me if I'd like to do an instance this evening, in the same manner that room service might ring you at an expensive hotel and ask if you'd like anything sent up.
---
That's different though.  The devilsaur are heavily contested for the skin, and it's very unlikely anyone would kill them unless they were specifically farming the leather.  I typically wait until I see someone move away before skinning anyone else's kill.  Never had anyone complain.
---
he is a warlock
---
Yeah I dont get it. People here behave as if people who spend 10+ hours a week raiding would just constantly run in and wipe on the boss. Never thinking what difference which stat makes, never googling shit and never thinking about any other ways to get better.
---
Almost? I thought every guild killed it before submerge.
---
Wouldn’t the research be skewed as you’re not focusing on the audio (playing games) where as when reading you’re intently focused on the text?
---
You buy everything up and resell it. You have to find the median that people are still willing to sell, but you making a profit.
---
For example wool cloth on my server drops low to around 60s, however peopel are willing to pay around a gold. Maybe more, but I haven't tried to go higher. You simply buy everything up to 90s and put everything back up. You might lose couple silver when buying for 90s and reselling for 90s due to the AH cut, however this has to be calculated as you can't sell your 90s wool when you have lots of 87s cloth still in the AH.
---
The 2nd account helps with this, because you have to keep everything off the AH below your own and you can't log off all the time. Say you are in an strat: UD run and your healer has to drink for a full mana bar. You now have 30-45seconds to hop on over to your bank alt on your 2nd account who is logged in all the time to quickly buy out all cloth below your own.
---
This accumulates to hundreds of gold quickly.
---
For me, knowing things enhanced my experience. At least in the leveling content. I had so much more fun than I had back then.
---
I don't have the point value tier list at hand but like 4-5 highest dps axes win it.
---
There’s a difference between good guilds clearing MC in 30-40 minutes now, and MOST guilds clearing it in 4 hours. That is the difference
---
Well... here’s hoping...
---
My guild does this too.
---
Its amazing if you consider how many kids are born thanks to WoW :D
---
I got a recipe for savory deviate delight, which netted me like 3 gold and has helped a lot for random small purchases I needed.  Other than that, my luck has been abysmal, with me losing every roll for every useful piece of gear in every dungeon I have ever done, most of them multiple times.  Granted I am only level 28, but still, I can't believe I cannot win a piece of gear, it seems.  Several runs of RFC, SFK, WC, and zilch.
---
No clue who this guy is but he's 10,000 times more annoying than the streamers
---
Glad to hear that! Have fun!
---
Works fine. You need to do the expose fix thing though.
---
Google it with WoW, you'll find it.
---
You must be shitting me. So let's say the spinal reaper wins it from sulfuras while missing 80 top dmg and 6 dps just for the sake of 5 weapon skill?

---
Are you suprised honestly, that not evrryone knows everything about a game that hasnt existed in many many years? I sure arent.
---
Arenas
---
So what information are you using to determine that its alliance favoured?
---
Priest mind vision can fish for skul. I've done it a handful of times when entering the side/back entrance. I just mind vision mobs until I can target a mob to the left through the first set of gates leading to Liv Strath. After three hops you should be able to see him.
---
Rattlegore, last I saw it was actually slightly alliance favored
---
Based off what data?
---
I also believe TBC to be better. But I'm also glad to experience classic for the first time in my life.
---
Both of those will essentially be a new experience to me. I've only seen classic raids when soloing them in Wotlk and I have only ever did a single raid in TBC and that was Gruul.
---
No xp as a ghost
---
i'll try and learn the arcane explosion AOE for that since it looks like the fastest way to kill these things.

you should never downrank as a mage

Sadly, my first time, I begged in IF.
---
It was shameful but it worked. I hope i never have to be a situation like that again.

the path still exists in retail though
---
I play on a late 2013 13" pro with everything low-mid and decent performance, fans do kick up a bit though but CPU doesn't go over 80 (not great, not terrible..)
---
This is why I am subbed good shit
---
just a lot of idiots in this thread who think their opinions override facts
---
no arguments refuting the facts, just downvotes and snark... as expected
---
To be fair, if the healer is full mana a lot of the time, while it’s ok to throw some dps out, it’d probably be better overall to give the tank a heads up that they can pull a little harder/faster.
---
BRD is huge and what you kill that run will vary wildy. at your level you'll do arena, angerforge, golem, and whatever random bosses and quests people need until you hit the 2 hour mark and people get bored. When you get to level 57-60 your runs will be smoother because you all will be going in with the same plan.
---
[Yeah, it's held by a decomposing Dwarf under the bridge.](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=637/sully-balloos-letter) [There's also another secret quest in the area](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=647/mackreels-moonshine) that you can get by hopping the broken part of the bridge on the Arathi side to the little collapsed area.
---
Cataclysm had issues and it was a downward spiral from there. Personally my favorite time to pvp was Wrath and Cata though.
---
Who the fuck doesn't learn all their spells while leveling?
---
I'll fall on this sword.  You're an idiot.
---
Because learning all the spells while levling is a waste of money. You only need the essential skills.
---
For frost mages and locks it translates into very close to 1% as their main damage crits for double. The ferals and boomkins I've seen were maybe 25-40% below average.
---
Everyone that knows anything about classic levling. You only level the essential skills that you need. That way you afford a mount at lvl 40 instantly and that way you afford everything, never any money problems when levling. Not at 60 either for that matter.
---
I agree. While I only revenge kill, it's good to know there are people like this out there to keep us on our toes and I encourage OPs behaviour.
---
Uh huh, I play one, and we were talking about tanks.
---
I sense someone would be a riot at parties...FUN POLICE HAVE ARRIVED.
---
Bet you’re the same person who jumps someone in wpvp, loses then cries to guildies to come get the person who “ganked” you.
---
This is false, many people are looking forward to twinking brackets and prices will most likely rise when it gets closer to phase 3.
---
Fuckin A! Do you have contact with anyone else from back in the day?
---
/Kaab
---
There are speech to text transcription apps. Google have one for android.
---
You went through the dungeon once, had this issue and didn’t think to say anything the second time around? Like holy hell, try communicating with your party instead of complaining about mechanics. I’ve ran ZF 7-8 times with absolutely 0 issue by saying  “talk to the goblin first once we get through this event” to the party.
---
I got really lucky and have both of them after 5 UBRS runs - world record? 😎
---
Bladestorm + bloodbath. Imagine bladestorm with classic's autohit damage from a warrior. 
---
6 ticks à 1000 autohit. Delicious.

They were only good because knowledge was being presented by someone with it.  Listen to his words during those deep dives, he doesn't have a fucking clue.

I use /cancelaura “mount buff name”
---

---
I managed to find enough alliance players interested to run SFK without quests so I could complete my Verrigan's Fist
---
I wonder what is in game representation of multiboxing couple. A raid?
---
Ok to clear it maybe, but consider this
---
Patchwerk, the gear check boss (IE if you beat him, you had the gear needed to do plenty of naxx, obviously harder bosses exists, but you got enough gear to clear a lot of it) has 3,850,000 HP and a 7 minute enrage timer.
---
that comes out to ~9500 dps for the raid.
---
Here is one from just recently
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/VAKcGJxbmqDyL1tN#fight=29&amp;type=damage-done
---
note the dps of the raid, in mostly prebis gear with some bis gear from MC and Onxy, with no class stacking, and with no crazy consumables (we had Onxy buff, some had DM buff).
---
And the dps of the raid is almost 8k. Now I will admit because the fight is extremely short and only 1 minute, it means that CD based classes will do a lot more damage (like warriors with execute).
---
But I hope this illustrates to you why that I think it will be very much different this time around. Assuming that my guild won't fall off super hard, getting to 9500 dps for the raid won't be hard. We have MC/Onxy, BWL and AQ to gear up and honestly I can see that it wasn't an issue of getting the numbers out, but rather finding the right people IE always there on time, prepared, and is skilled in the non numbers skills (like staying out of fire) to do the place.
---
I think only a few raids were overtuned to the point of impossibility, and I am wagering that outside of end naxx stuff, they are not tuned to be impossible to do.
---
Heya,
---
In terms of PvP i didn't really grind a lot. I think I made it into rank 8 or 9. I did play a lot of PvE though ...
---
I honestly never thought about how ''lucky'' I was to clear Naxx pre TBC. I played in Europe, in the guild named Path of Wreckage towards the end of Vanilla. I remember all the time we had to put in to progress. All the ideas that we had to test in order to down a boss. And after a boss went down it was on farm mode. The next week it would die with one or two tries most of the time. It's the confidence that you've killed something that gives you the boost to do it again easier.
---
It was pretty much a race back in the day and the ''strategies'' did not really circulate soon after the boss went down somewhere in the world. So you had to experiment a lot. Like REALLY a lot. No boss journal describing the abilities of the boss. No boss journal describing the phases. You had to see it yourself. You had to perfect the transition from P1 to P2 just to see what happens. You had to play good for 5 mins just to get a shot of 20-30 sec into the next phase and try to put down a strategy of how to handle things.
---
I remember Thaddius and all the lag that caused wipe after wipe. All the discussion in general, encouraging people to take the night off so we could try to get a good attempt for a kill. In the end our first kill was sometime early in the morning like 4AM.
---
Gothik the harvester, with all the different strategies about how to handle adds, us trying to look for hints around the room about potentially missing something that was causing us to get overwhelmed.
---
If you ask me about the encounter that I still remember most vividly I'll say the 4 Horsemen. I remember that after Goth on your way to the Horsemen there was a room with circles where we used to practice rotations for the groups as they would move throughout the encounter. And then a taunt would get resisted and a try would be wasted ....
---
PS : If anyone from PoW(EU) is still playing , send a pm
---
Worst on rend runs is someone pulling the balcony for wipe and break event.
---
I find it weird you would rate brd 0 but mara a 2. You can truly kill only the last boss if you want, hows that not less linear than brd? It even has 3 entrances because of the portal which skips half the dungeon.  
---
I think my issue is that youre pretty much rating the dungeons on "which one has the most optional bosses" and counting that as nonlinear. When truthfully it should be "how many bosses are necessary to kill to get to the final boss". Just because people choose to only do arena runs, doesnt neccesarily make brd less linear than mara, unless you go by whatever weird criteria, which you did not define, you decided to go with.  
---
Anyway thats truly besides the original point i was making, but again, like i stated before, once you run a dungeon a certain way, youre pretty much going to continue running it that same way after, so having these huge sprawling dungeons like brd, while cool, are also at the same time not that different from dungeons added later in the game. Unless you really really love the whole optional boss design, going to a more linear design is better because if you need a boss like unforgiven in strath, it isnt a huge pain in the dick to find a group willing to do it.
---
Best horde race for PVE content?

Dude, it's the size of a couple of mattresses:  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Rosetta_Stone.JPG/280px-Rosetta_Stone.JPG
---
Then you had some very good boe drops or something to sell. Most people dont have 100g at lvl 40 if they buy all skills. Not even close, I was at 80g (3 days played) at 40 and I bought nothing that I didnt need for example on my hunter. And how is it stupid? There are MANY skills that arent useful at all while levling, and are used very rarely even on 60.
---
Everyone was superhyped about it, then the post-nut clarity set in and no one wanted to farm the mats, so it was pretty much just one guy going for it
---
What? Why take the long route? Just swim to the other direction and there's a path like 20 Seconds further that leads to the bridge. Dark iron dwarves in the way though
---
I love you boat guy &lt;3 im so sad when you aren't there

Shaman has a ton of class quests, so I got bonus xp, and she also did a lot of gathering minerals for her professions (and therefore not getting rest xp) whenever I couldn't play too. That combined to my being 1/3 of a level ahead, though as we're reaching 60 that's compressed back down to 2 bars because it takes some much more xp per level now.
---
As Alliance, what’re your favourite zones in terms of story and feel by leveling bracket? 
---
I’ve just done Dun Morogh &gt; Westfall / Loch Modan &gt; Wetlands. I absolutely loathed the Wetlands so I’ve changed to Darkshire which I’m LOVING. I’ve never leveled Ally before, so I’d love to get an idea of what cool zones I should do as I go.
---
One of the better ones? Sure. For now at least until more raids get released. BIS? No. For example Raggy himself drops Bonereaver's Edge at similar droprate to the Eye and it's just better weapon. And you don't have to blow 50 Arcanite Bars and 8 Sulfuron Ingots to craft it after the drop.
---
Killed a random skele in wpl and got freezing band. Was awesome
---
Oh, just shut up. Nothing will happen. They might delete the loot but even that is questionable because it would require a bit of effort on their side to correct the mistake.
---
Blizz fucked up, they can't expect the players to know the respwn timers in the game. That would be ridiculous.
---
IMO VuhDo is the best healing addon
---
Your study is about reading comprehension in different mediums lol. I fail to see how it’s irrelevant.
---
The addon was updated and is working again, so it depends if people have been uploading their data.
---
Hm I love the forest -&gt; darkshore/westfall -&gt; ashen -&gt; darkshire -&gt; then up to hillabrad/alterac.
---
cool. when that becomes the default modality then you can do whatever stealth shit you want
---
until then, banned
---
Yeah not having this is just dumb.
---
What addon did you use to change fonts?
---
This is exactly why I don't want open sever transfers.... You shouldn't be able to do this on a low pop server and bring it to like ferlina or one of the other super populated servers...
---
You are literally the WORST type of person
---
That's just not practical. Some items are too rare to do that. E.g. neck and robe from Strat UD.
---
I had bears and prot pallies compete with me for healer loot while getting my pre bis. Beats looking for a tank for another hour. And if we decide to run it more than once together it kinda evens out the odds and everyone is playing instead of lfg-ing their time away. Learn to compromise, people.
---
If anything, after making their intentions clear they should roll on healer loot and only pick up bear-suitable loot that isn't needed by other players.
---
For dungeons, a tank as warrior, druid.
---
For raids, healer specially druids.
---
I play horde but that scorp and a ghost saber are the two pets I kept through both vanilla and TBC
---
What if I told you... That you can use both?
---
Go outside you fucking basement troll.
---
The world is not as black and white as you try to paint it. 
---
Obviously there are levels of MS &gt; OS. A pug raid warrior going in as 2hand warrior with windfury will be eligible to roll on band of accuria.  A 2hand warrior will be able to roll on 1handers. This is all within a DPS spec. A restoration shaman will not be allowed to roll on Talisman of Ephemeral Power.
---
There is a distinct difference between healing, tanking and DPSing. A warrior taking DPS pieces is only doable, because tanks are so rare, therefore people put up with it. And still the tank should state that he is rolling on his offpieces, because a rogue can not possibly tell if this warrior is indeed preparing for tanking or gearing for fury.
---
F
---
My advise upon these is : review stats and then consider/need and greed.
---
People who write "this is BiS this is not" are people aswell and can be wrong. 
---
TL:DR - think for yourself
---
I’m going LW as a rogue while levelling. Are there any pieces that are especially good on the ah for selling? For levelling chars, not max level.
---
I’ve had good experiences with most ret pallys but the bad ones really stand out. I had one refuse to cleanse, keep buffs up greater or regular, offheal when I got counterpselled and berated me when I asked him to use his utility spells. The best part of the dungeon.... tank was about to pull Alexei Barov and says fear diamond kill skull. This ret immediately fears skull and starts dpsing the boss. One of the funniest things I’ve seen so far
---
Remember that time where you got rolled up on and destroyed so hard you jumped off yourself and hearthed?
---
Where's that clip?
---
Probably because a rogue has no name
---
That’s not how it works for D/HoTs. HoTs are spread over the life and afaik, all of them end up being 100%. Rejuv is 100%, renew is 100%, regrowth is 50% for the initial burst and 50% of the rest.
---
HoTs are one of the best things for plus heal..
---
We have our tanks at 220 FR, not using any buffs. Dual Wield Fury with Plate FR. Don't go above that while sacrificing threat and hit. Even if you resist Wrath, you will still have aggro reduce, so be prepared.
---
He’s probably talking about the buff itself “you’ve stopped breathing”
---
He said all HoT spells get 100%, not all spells right? So this is accurate. There are 3, rejuv, regrowth and renew. They all get 100%.
---
Makes pugging dungeons for bad DPS a lot more enjoyable. The DPS have a lot more leeway doing stupid stuff than with an arms warrior. 
---
Imp revenge stunning with a 45% chance every 6 seconds alone makes tanking so much more convenient.
---
Considering that you won't see the outside of a dungeon until you have your pre-BiS anyways, there really isn't much of a reason to not go full prot.
---
The addon was updated, so not entirely true.
---
Every weapon is a hunter weapon, told ya
---
I play rogue DPS. I made myself custom hybrid spec as i plan to do PvP in phase 2 two and im not better than regular guide combat swords pve rogues. Im on par with them tho. There is literally no difference in DPS (which might be also because my core is around AR aswell)
---
IT'S NOT A MAN BAG IT'S A SATCHEL!
---
I just bought a bow and quiver for the first time on my hunter (lvl 17) but it won't let me equip my quiver. Every time I try it says "no equipment slot available for that item." 
---
Anyone know how to fix this so I can equip my quiver? I've tried collapsing bags, taking off my cloak, etc.
---
Ah yes. The real world. Where you should never be accountable for your actions even if legally liable and found so guilty in the judicial system. Thank God for the real world.
---
I rolled a lock for classic, I love it, so much fun
---
It's going into the book!
---
Male privilege confirmed
---
Get ClassicCodex and just ride to the spawn points.
---
Why you mad boi? Triggered? Are you a ninja yourself? Sounds like it
---
You can do it until 54. Thats what I did.
---
46-54, thats insane.
---
And have you tried taking your own census?
---
My girlfriend and I have been leveling together the whole time, just barely 51 but looking forward to sharing this accomplishment with her.
---
Why do you only use prayer of healing and holy nova lol
---
I want to get a macro for a warrior to work. Basically I want to stance dance and switch weapons. However I cant get weapon equipping to work with modifiers. This is my current attempt.  
---
\#showtooltip  
---
/cast \[mod:shift\] Berserker Stance; Defensive Stance
---
/equip 2h
---
/equipslot 17 1h
---
/equipslot 16 shield
---
Now this only works while weapons are in sync with the weapon swap. For example if I press the macro twice I will still be in defensive stance but with a 2h. I can't get \[mod:shift\] to work with an equip command. Does anyone know a way?
---
Or NE shadowmeld :)
---
Well I'm quite sure about this :).
---
This
---
Met my bf in evolve and since then we are living together and now also playing classic together
---
they have 80% drop rate of clams, but the golden pearl inside is about 0.1%
---
The amount of kids not born because of WoW is a lot higher propably. :,D
---
I'm also on the exalted AD rep grind, 3 bars into revered atm. What do you think is the best way to get it? I was doing scholo a ton, then my guild told me strat UD was way faster rep because you can run it way faster than scholo. So now I'm conflicted.... Also how many runs did you do? 25 rep per boss kill seems insane to me trying to rack up 21k rep.
---
urgh, not really. in prot spec you will end up being rage starved and dealing very little damage, making it hard to keep up with threat. as a healer i try to avoid deep prot tanks for my groups, a good arms/fury tank makes for much smoother runs.
---
I failed the escort in red ridge mountain a few yards from the turn in because I got into combat with a mob that usually ambushes the escort and my dude just kept walking. I was pissed
---
Shhh we don't talk about those clips
---
Probably not the best place to try and do this mate, if you're gonna break rules you might as well RWT anyway, risk of getting banned is minimal, never heard of anyone getting banned for it and pretty much every guild I've been in since TBC has had guildies selling gold to eachother. Blizzard doesn't care enough to single out a person who isn't making a business out of selling gold.
---
Go engi/mining
---
Also hella slower, and no dual monitor stuff. Consider trying to alt tab long form which usually took 15 seconds for your computer to process the window switching, then a google search taking 15 seconds and any browser page to show up after that... getting information on demand would still take possibly 5-10 minutes and a lot of us used to write down everything on paper just to save from having to alt tab another handful of times. It was a different, much slower internet.
---
but how many slots? cause i'll carry a purse for more of them sweet slots.
---
Time wasted having fun isn't time wasted
---
No. It's a really crappy addon written by someone who obviously have no clue about usability.
---
Go with grid instead.
---
prebis would be arcanite reaper, or dal rends combo if you insist on dualwielding.
---
Definitely

Not post cata

On my priest I got the Vestaments recipe on my first Live Strat and everyone else in group passed, despite it being a PuG.

Also helps to play Paladin or Warlock as your main!

Holy crap I thought that was my mate from last night. Dwarf Rogue crossing the bridge, we were going to meet up at SFK when he was MC'd off the bridge.
---
Wow, you poor, poor soul. You think I cared enough that it boosted my ego.
---
Congrats!
---
I play on a 2015 MBP with fairly basic hardware. It might feel like an air fryer but it works. I play on very low settings, but mostly because i want 50FPS+ all times.
---
I had trouble in MC and dropped to 6 frames with full resolution. Retina makes it a pain. I ended up dropping the render scale and while it certainly looks choppier, i get good fps all the time.
---
A newer version will probably run all much better
---
The opening patch of wotlk was the worst patch in the history of wow. Nothing to do, shit gear (yes yes early xpac gear is bad on purpose), and balls ass easy boring raids. That tier had a grand total of 3 new boss fights, sarth, malygos, and that stupid wintergrasp "boss".
---
Get a Razer Blade 15 instead. 
---
U get a gaming grafics card instead of the ”Mac” tax
---
What’s it like having friends
---
TBC landscape is just “wrong”. All that floating landscape and Weird arcane magic is just something totally alien to me and I never really enjoyed that expansion. 
---
TBC reminds me of those eastern games and MMOs.....it’s just too much unreal things going on.
---
Getting most of my gear from MC early. I literally don't have to play the game for months LOL
---
Try doing that as hunter. I dare ya
---
Purses are just a real life version of 14 slot bags with Bagnon while dudes walk around with 4 slot bags and no add-ons. Why do we keep pretending like we are too good for purses? We complain that we can't carry our shit around and then scoff at carrying any type of bag that may be mistaken for a purse.
---
Most multi boxers are low skill players. Leveling three different classes is much harder than 3 classes that are the same.
---
One time I rolled only 1 below the guy who won HoJ and that was pretty lucky , i always lose it by a mile
---
Colby ? Isnt that the pervert in hollywood?
---
been messing around with the dps calculation spreadsheet linked on the fight club discord, atleast for fury warriors, the difference between Krol + Mirahs and the Dal'rend set is like 4 dps
---
There is absolutely a zero percent chance you guys ever even killed Patchwerk before 2.0 if you "didn't even understand how hit worked and how to spec". It just wasn't possible, sorry. You are lying about this and I've no idea why, but it is kinda pathetic. And patchwerk is one of the easier fights, just an example of HARD timer there is absolutely no way you beat without consumes and proper specs, seeing as how the fight was tuned around those things.
---
He has spy. Says enough.
---
They did for the hours the servers went down for maintenance for the 4.0 patch then Deathwing broke it before we could see it. Very tragic.
---
I just got Ironfoe on my lvl55 War on my first BRD run.
---
I’m a human so I get 55 for turn ins. I think scholo is better because there are roughly 10 corruption scourgestones available. My runs were generally about an hour or 75 minutes. Also the whelpling ’s can drop health scales for a turn in. Remember after you hit exalted you need 25 tokens for the chromatic mantle quest.
---
There is a quest to get Dawns Gambit which allows you to kill vectus and Marduk easily. Never kill jandice. I would stack up 30-50 corrupters stones at a time before doing any turn ins, not really sure how many runs it took but I had strat sprinkled in too. Scholo just has more bosses so I think it’s better for rep overall.
---
There’s really no rush to get exalted. I thought the tabard would be available at exalted but apparently it’s from a quest in phase 5. Rip me.
---
Yea I know, I was asking about the drop rate of clams, not the pearl ofc
---
Footloose!
---
Another thing thats easier for Alliance. Divine Shield pulls. I'm starting to get addicted to them. Just have to fight down the hearthstone urges.
---
My advice is to not try to farm for these. Do something that brings in reliable gold, and buy them from the AH.
---
Uh, no. Sorry, but a toll is a toll, and a roll is a roll, and if we don't get no tolls, then we don't eat no rolls.
---
&gt;That way you afford a mount at lvl 40 instantly
---
Still only buying the essential skills while lvling, but...
---
*laughs in Warlock*
---
Logged in @ Wetlands way back when i was lvl 24ish and killed a whelp that was sitting in front of me. Lazily auto looted/skinned it when I noticed a Tiny Crimson Whelpling in my bag. Apparently it has a .1% drop rate so all my rng was definitely used up that day haha. I knew it would be worth a decent amount eventually, but I couldn't resist summoning it within 30 seconds. Still don't regret it.
---
Welcome to capitalism
---
I think OSX breaks some modifier keys without it.
---
I haven't used it in a while but it definitely screws up keybinds somehow.
---
This is the best comment I've ever read on this sub
---
You’re such a cool dude. I bet you got mad street rep in the schoolyard
---
I've had groups like that (though I'm only up to level 41, so nothing major like BRS/BRD) where no on in the group can actually use a *really* amazing piece of gear that just dropped.
---
I likey
---
depends how much do you weigh?
---
it's not that hard, although I witness a fair amount of overlap in gear demands between rogue and some other classes. Many times people ask me to find a clothie DPS.
---
did you forget to change accounts?
---
Griefing and general pvp are two different things. Also this is absolutely reportable because I've done it before, been reported and been asked to move on.
---
Cool did I ever say people aren’t going to twink in phase 3?  Do you understand how an economy works, even a simulated one on a game?  He could flip that 500g he’d make NOW into  4-5-6k by that time so you’d be stupid to just take all your purchasing power away for months just because you want to twink at an undetermined date... and this thread acts like this isn’t going to drop again multiple times on the same server because everyone and their mother runs ulda at some point but you saw it for 9k in retail because no one did back then.  But yeah no by all means any rare a twink could use you obviously should just let rot in the bank because SOME DAY someone can use it!!  Lolololol
---
i think swifty is the most chill one .
---
Man that is hilarious
---
Yes this is a bannable thing, theres been posts with GMs giving out warnings.
---
It’s really fast, so it gives decent poison procs. Also does good DPS and boosts Agi.
---
Nice also loved the music choice of Death Grips
---
you run in and sapper charge
---
100% skill
---
Heh, the salt is off the charts.
---
... nice.
---
Every run I just do “/rw DISMISS PETS YOU DUNGEON KILLERS” Always gets a few laughs and pets are always dismissed.
---
If there’s that one person skinning the mobs while the pats are walking, I spam “/rw Stop skinning jump down” until they do it.
---
The equipment slot for the quiver is a bag slot. It takes a bag slot instead of the ammo pouch you have. Ammo pouch is for bullets, quiver is for arrows.

you can buy one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nostromo-PC-Gaming-Keypad/dp/B004AM5RB6) they have a button on the side that lets you switch between 3 sets of keybinds
---
What's up?
---
Sup homie? Too scared to answer? There is nothing that you can say that would make sense, you beeing quiet is admitting that this is a circle jerk against streamers. Imagine beeing an internet janitor for free and letting it go to your head hahahahahahahaha, cringe city. Are you mad that streamers make more in a year than your WHOLE family will make in 10 years? Is that why you mad against streamers, because they are rich and you are an internet janitor? :D
---
Are shocks even that mana intensive? Interrupting a steal probably prevents more damage than they would need to heal. It’s like people don’t want to be good at this game
---
I remember as healer just zooming full in and looking on the ground and just using my Ui because my toaster couldn't take the graphics at all. This was in a progress guild.
---
This thread breaks the rules internet janitor
---
They haven't.  Sorry if my reply was vague, I meant they stopped playing K3.  Guild founders still going strong here.

You cant take the tiniest bit of banter yet he is the insecure one? wow gz shadow bolt spam 100dps so good mechanical apm god.
---
Shield block. Shield slam is 31 point prot talent.
---
Only three comments from the history books
---
This guy is lying about clearing Naxx, or he is severly overstating how  clueless his raid members were. There is no chance anyone is killing Patchwerk if they don't "even understand how hit worked and how to spec". That is just straight bullshit, no other way about it. Yeah, world buffs are probably overkill, but taking a log of raiders that are hitcapped and buffed and using to imply you can do Naxx level DPS without those things is disingenuous.
---
Mark kill orders, los casters, cc whenever you can, don’t try to skip mobs when you’re one yard from aggroing, kill all pats. These are all basic tactics that I’ve seen a lot of players don’t do because they came from the retail mindset of pew pew rush through.
---
Some advanced tactics would be: priests can MC a mob if things are going badly, I almost never see a priest do this. Hunter pets can offtank or the hunter can kite away the boss while you kill adds first. Rogues can offtank by stunlocking and blinding and evasion. Warlock voidwalkers can offtank, my warlock has tanked low level instances with void walker before. There’s so many other cc or offtank possibilities than just the standard polymorph most people think of.
---
He has more than 1 spawn though.
---
if a whole guild is there they may be trying to do group vs group fights since there and tanaris are the only two places you can fight your own faction   
---
also if you know about the trinket then you know that the quest is why some high level players would camp it to get all 12
---
Ideally, you would have both
---
I saw people saying Ubrs RF buff is not worth. I disagree.
---
Assuming you are able to enter brs easily (without losing potential DM/Ony buff), it takes about 3-4 min to grab it with a priest while the rest of the raid goes and clean the trash. You go in, priest Soothe the 2 packs at the top of the slop, you pass between them and cm the mob for the buff, and run out (fear if necessary). 
---
Then you jump down to MC. BOOM +81RF which probably means around 3-4 pieces of RF gear you don't need and can swap for stamina/def/whatever.
---
Blue honor gear is phase 5 or 6 iirc
---
Thankfully it isn’t the Kasting Kouch
---
yeah right
---
It’s embarrassing enough to watch couples being affectionate in public but now also here. Gross.
---
12 of the basic green trinket gives the Arena Grand Master trinket. 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19024/arena-grand-master 
---
So people are farming it multiple times each.
---
Two epics dropped while doing jailbreak quest, from the same mob too. Won Lifestone and the other went to a guildie
---
Well played.
---
Do you have to yell that every time?
---
Going through the comments i began to hate this subreddit
---
i got azuresong in my second mc raid too, so great
---
Damn you didn’t have to expose him like that
---
Try going into settings and turning all sounds down, and the music way up. It's easy to miss it sometimes, especially when grinding. I find the louder in game music really helps with immersion.
---
TBC should be separate, OR give us the OPTION to move our existing Classic characters to DIFFERENT TBC REALMS. If existing servers are updated to TBC, that basically means there is no point to WoW Classic in the first place.
---
Fell down the hole in Searing Gorge today saying farewell and good luck in party chat. I just wanted to turn the completed quest in, but noooo....
---
nah they are just controlling it. Once you have the timer set you can control it for a few months until many people have the trinket. You can see APES doing this on Gehennas every 3 hours on their twitch team channel, for example.
---
yeah first guy on our server made 150g/helmet. it's dropped down to a lot less now though
---
Naxx isn't crazy difficult, but it was TUNED around having a certain level of competence with your character's spec and gear choices as well as flasks. They balanced it off the numbers people were pulling in TOP guilds at the time, because they wanted to make it difficult for even them. And those top guild ALL used consumes/world buffs/proper specs and gear. To say you don't need any of those things these days is unclear at this time, but to say people didn't need them back then is a complete fabrication.
---
 It's entirely possible people are all just doing more damage because they are getting above 20fps now, and maybe that is all it takes to trivialize Naxx, I guess we will see. I'm sure APES will clear it in 4 hours and people will claim it's a joke even though they will still be working on BWL when it come out.
---
It's just a basic ElvUI setup
---
I wish I had remembered this when starting. My dumb ass learned every spell every time from ALL specs and I have 80 silver now. Can't even learn Heal 3 on my priest. /facepalm
---
&gt;I knew i'd have some problems getting into groups as a rogue, but even making groups incredibly difficult as one due to warriors being somehow so massively in demand even as the 2nd most played class that most will just decline because it's far better for them to look for caster DPS in their groups.
---
Neatplates and you select a skin from its settings. Might be neon skin but im not sure
---
Haha I've been umming and ahhing for days in this so thanks for your comment. So you think the prices of essences will come down soon?
---
that's just getting to 60 though, it's harder getting there to begin with. the problem is less that and more "it's several times harder for us to gear up because everyone dips into our gear pool because it's also their BiS".
---
I gave in and bought myself a devilsaur set at lvl 55. Still have about 100g left. We will see how long it takes me to get that epic riding.
---
Engi for sapper, and arcanite dragonling for fire is huge. Does a stacking debuff that increases fire dmg taken significantly. 
---
Tailoring robe of the archmage is bis until phase 4 bloodvine. Bloodvine is bis until late aq (replaced by volatile power, 2.5 boots, black blizzard)
---
Doesn't change the fact that the solution to your problem is to make your own groups.
---
I wish you did tell me 2 years ago, i wouldn't have spent 10 days ingame time levelling rogue up if you had! 
---
atleast i'll have fun on pvp with it when that rolls around, assuming i can get cool weapons for it.
---
Where you hit max level is always noteworthy ... I once got it by the exp gained crossing into a new zone. Was pretty hilarious.
---
How did it happen ? Like I hear these stories all the time but like were you guys in a guild and raided together or something?
---
May I also add that Dal'Rends MH is an incredibly rare drop, and "Rend Runs" usually have it reserved, or 5+ people rolling for it?
---
Warriors can use pretty much any 1handers, and high top end damage is kind of trivial for alliance, matters way more for horde because of WF. Sure, swords for humans, axes for orcs and daggers/swords for non humans on alliance is optimal, but anything works fine. You're still gonna outperform every other player of equal skill until Naxx, and even in Naxx you're still above and beyond anything else for patchwerk-style fights. A lot of your BiS gear is either BoE or drops early on. Glad chain is fine even in Naxx, Onyxia neck is a guaranteed drop 2 times a week. Albeit some BoEs are very expensive, most of them will last you a very long time, and some will even last all throughout classic.
---
robe of archmage is basically forever too  
---
i farmed my robes first, working on my mount now
---
Mages, Locks, Priests, Paladins, Druids and shaman all share drops leveling and bis too. You don't have it rough. Gearing is just harder in vanilla.
---
😘😘😘😘😘
---
This is pure gold
---
Where do i find me a partner in wow?
---
Give Paladin a taunt
---
I’m exactly in the same situation but with less gold. I’ve decided after much thought to not spend any gold on the robe, yet. Mount is more important and make more of a difference in the game than the robe will. The robe will have to wait until I have the mount.
---
Pay a stately sized cum*
---
hell man, if you are an independent and committed player, you can make it as rogue. Truly, once you have your Dal'Rend's mainhand you're laughing, as the rest of the gear is pretty low competition, except for a few pieces, and still, you'll be able to find chances to roll on them (Cape of the Black Baron, Truestrike Mantle, Cadaverous Armor.) You can also just buy a Krol Blade and go with that a Mirah's Song. Rogue is an absolute blast, and with a little luck, lots of effort, and a good guild, you can be rocking a sick one hander in phase 2-6
---
Sounds like your mate needs to find a different guild.
---
Run dungeons. 
---
Dungeons = Groups
---
not for the classic version yet, but it was possible in the original vanilla version, so it probably comes with a later update.
---
I have heard this from several female friends. They've even said that they can't stand the sound of their female character getting hit (that they sound weird/awkward/bad), so they always roll male characters..
---
What level are you? You may just be in the slow part of the leveling experience! :)
---
The Son, the Father, and the holy Doot.
---
some people enjoy fishing, winter squid will net you alot in the summer months
---
No it wouldn't, read up on warrior abilities.
---
If it was cheap and easy, everyone would do it.
---
2nd class mounts that eat mana and are on the gcd, no ty.
---
Does your husband also enjoy multiple boxes?
---
the irbs are only in the 10 man version. you need 2 priests in 25
---
Got myself the cho‘ rush blade from DM North instead of Krol. Performs good enough I guess. Saved those 300g. Now own my epic mount.
---
its called something like Stand to Dismount in the addon iirc
---
So far I haven't really had a problem finding people to play with. I just ask in general chat if someone can help me out with a certain quest I'm on or I ask someone who I see near me in the world. So far I have had many positive responses. And this has all been outside my guild even.
---
So my advice is: just ask!
---
Where do people find others to play this game with? I'm always playing solo :(
---
punctuation dawg r u 12
---
Honestly doesn’t even matter, mages farm gold rly fast, I have both, went for mount first myself, got the robe few days after
---
That was in BC though, DOT dmg was reduced by resilience.
---
Didn't you watch the video? They're not nazis.

High quality gif

Yup, welcome to the annoyance of gear itemization! Probably unpopular, but I would've loved it if each class was locked to one type of gear, but there was better itemization for each type... I really like Warriors, being head-to-toe in plate is an awesome look! But you won't be that as DPS...
---
at the rate im hoarding stuff, i might need a 2nd account just to hold everything
---
one of my alts is filled with Free Action Pots
---
yeah, as a druid (but also, priests, warriors, paladins, shamans...) fuck that.
---
I'm not a college student anymore. No time to level ANOTHER character to farm gold to pay for the main one, or pay 50g every other day to respec in a viable farming spec (still have to farm the equip for that you know? druid struggle) just because it's cool that there is an identity.
---
I had this problem using TeamViewer and my Nexus 10 while visiting my in-laws(so not over LAN). I never found a fix for it, but assumed it was just because streaming a game playing was just too much for our internet to handle.
---
The game was FFXIV, which I don't think is too much more intensive than wow would be.
---
My keyboard also wasn't wireless, but this is literally the only time I've ever had this issue myself. I stream to my stream link in our bedroom all the time and never have any control or latency issues. Wireless keyboard and mouse, or wireless controller.
---
That’s exactly why the brought it back in wotlk. Super hyped but at most 5% of players ever got to see it in vanilla. It’s one of my favourite raids but I didn’t okay it til lick king.
---
Link to vid?
---
I mean if I cared enough I’d just put up judgement of wisdom and blessing of wisdom and spam rank 1 SoC. If it’s going to be the long game I’d more likely just disengage and do something better with my life.
---
I never farmed it, so I didn't know. Thanks.
---
*Should we tell him that's a Worg or no?*
---
...
---
Then again, most people wouldn't think to use the rank 1 for interupts.
---
This is bad advice. You should always spec with your weapon you are using. 
---
If you get an upgrade, you respec that weapon specialization.
---
Back in vanilla I attended the AQ event at level 49. A level 60 Alliance dueled me and deliberately lost so I would get PvP enabled.
---
So I just shot him as he was on one health and ran away until the timer went off.
---
Don't think he thought it through very well.
---
Wow, you just really need to be right about this it seems, even when someone provides you with an easy way to fix it. Well, you are not right, as this is not a bannable offense - you are in fact in the wrong. Kind of makes me want to level a rogue and park him at flightmasters.
---
What’s in Tanaris?
---
I don’t see a point in buying it tho, the one from brd arena is alrdy better, not to mention you can get igniting cords in raids
---
yeah thats basically the spec, just move the points from feral aggression into feral instinct and one point from nature's focus into insect swarm.a
---
The shadow damage belt is not BIS in the slightest. Mana Igniting Cord = Better. Go look up any reputable spreadsheet lol.
---
in the middle of gagetzan if you go inside the cage its a FFA mode like gurubashi, theres no chest or other event tho, purely just for FFA pvp
---
I use my 2018 Mbp with no problems. It drains the battery but I can sit in a coffee shop or on my phones 4g with no problem.
---
In TBC they had a taunt (Righteous Defense) that worked like this:
---
- You target 1 enemy, taunt it.
---
- You target 1 ally, target up to 3 target that are attacking it.
---
I love it when people come together for the greater good and helping out guild mates.
---
Damn it, that mount vendor lied to me!
---
Picked up Cassandra’s grace on the AH for 80g the other day. There were two others up for 150 and 200 and a third for 450 at the same time. Also got second wind On my first BRD run.
---
Thumbs up from me, I like that.
---
do it, i will laugh at your banned account
---
They dont Even have a date for p2 yet. So no
---
Muscle memory :p
---
mage with ice block or rogue and vanish can also work
---
Blizzard doesn't care as long as players keep there abo running.  If it turns out classic is the new default they can just cut efforts for retail and really Head for classic +...   From there perspective it really isn't an issue as long as overall player numbers are high enough.
---
As a resto Sham sham fuck this. My guild auctions off the Ony bags. Basically you need to be an AH god or not a healer/tank to get them.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Haha I tell boyfriend his new dress is nice whenever he upgrades. 
---
I’m a pally tank and he’s a mage. We make a great aoe combo. I was never planning on being an aoe combo but that’s how it turned out.
---
These are the only two items required from profession and they are not even BOP - just craft them somewhere else or ask your guild’s leatherworker. All the other items are trash and even when there are some useful ones, you can just buy them on AH for pennies. Not to mention money and effort you waste when you level it.
---
Whoever blame wrath doesn't know shit about the game.
---
Wrath was the last good expansion and the reason my guildmate and I stopped playing after that.
---
It's scary because it's an incredibly slippery slope. The very same comments, the exact same logic and identical reasoning as the pro changes crowd is what turned vanilla into what retail is today. It's also somewhat incredible that almost noone of them realise this risk.
---
Won Arcanist Bindings and Staff of Dominance on my first MC pug
---
Why not keybind ur spells?
---
Invite people to groups when you're out questing. It might not be necessary for most quests, but it's more fun. I rarely go an evening without grouping up for *something*.
---
Another one.
---
you're full of split
---
Got a 6 slot bag from my 2nd kill on server launch.
---
arcane crystals yes, leather no its dropping now
---
It's a really big guild on the server, although I think they haven't organized and raids yet they do a lot of lower level content.
---
Oh wow I never noticed that! I’ve played this game until Cataclysm and never knew thanks 😂
---
just for some context, I tend to play the game more on a casual level and left the guild I was in explicitly because I was having zero fun with them. It started as a rather casual group that just wanted to find people to run dungeons together and it was fun as hell since we were all 25+ years old and had less of a childish mentality behind, so everything was just for fun and giggles. But after a fair amount of member hitting 60 the focus started on raiding and a lot of people started to shift mentalities into a "this is serious now" kind of vibe and a lot of older members like myself were being invited to raid and were still on that fun and giggles kind of mentality, so when we started to joke around as usual we started to get reprimanded and thats the point that I realized I was on the wrong guild and left. So my comment is more in the sense that now that I am guileless and taking a small break from the game I can look back and see that those guys are the kind of people I want to play with and not some abusive tryhards that managed to turn a quasi meme-guild into a try hard bunch of idiots
---
Doing some U/LBRS today and thought to myself I really need to map a rank 1 earth shock and frost shock. I didn't do it right then. But when I get back home planning on it. They are currently down ranked a little because my enhance self can't afford that mana.
---
dumb question: where can you scale the ui ? have not found the option the other day. or do you need a addon for this ?
---
Also, no changes is the "least offensive" option as there's no risk or unpredictability to it.
---
People keep suggesting healbot but that horrid addons force a terrible UI straight out of the early 2000 years down your throat.
---
Use clique instead. Works with every UI (the native one and any other) and just discretely let you do the same thing (click on UI to cast spells).
---
It's just the best addon aimed at doing just that one thing, you can find.
---
This shit is so enraging.

Got edgemasters as a warrior at lvl 50 in sunken temple. Won Viskag with a 45 when there were 9 other people rolling.

And you keep going, get that ego boosted!

Don't know what you mean
---
Played wow back in 2007-2008, remember starting playing around 2 weeks before TBC came out. Anyway back then i was a nelf hunter, leveled all the way to lvl 70. Up the launexperienceexperienceh of classic wow, I never actually thought that warlocks
---
Join a streamer server, AKA Faerlina. It won't risk dying, even 2 years down the line. It is also fairly balanced. Also, go alliance for several times faster BG queues once phase 3 is out.
---
&gt; (briarwood) **Reed** and Dalrend MH reserved
---
i did 80 6 man runs and it was k. going in knowing you had a 50/50 shot is nice
---
You can do way more.
---
First of all you can pull any melee Elemental (those without mana) and add it to the pack of oozes. They have a bit more HP than the oozes meaning you will need mana for one more Blizzard.
---
I don’t remember if you need lvl 51, but you can blink past the elementals and get to the ramp. Can also just use a lesser invis pot. Down the ramp you pull 4 oozes with r1Blizz, run up the ramp, CS pull the furthest ooze of the pack of 5 then walk into to the last two in the back. Ice Block necessary. Total 11 elites. Always have gem, pot and evo for this. Really hard pull cause kiting up and down the ramp interferes with line of sight.
---
Then there’s yet another pull of oozes up the next ramp. CS pull eastern pack of 2, body pull closest pack of 4 then blink past them to body pull 4 more, jump down the cliff, group them with r1 blizz.
---
Not sure if it’s worth the risk. OP’s video is probably better purely XPH wise, but I had a lot of fun leveling my mage and discovering these pulls.
---
Luthien and Beren are characters in a tragic story in LotR.
---
If you was 5-7 on dps, your raid consisted of players that were nowhere near as good as you. If OP is in a guild full of good players, he will more or less be at the bottom of the meters as a hunter in any piece of content post ZG. However, whislt hunters don't get much better DPS from more gear, their burst in PvP certainly improves, and it isn't unusual for a Naxx geared hunter to outright oneshot a clothie in BGs.
---
Start at a stupid number and reduce by 20-50 each time it doesn't sell I guess. Attracts people to thinking it's a low price if they've seen it up so high before
---
in pvp? also after fighting a warlock and still having curse of tongues on you can be a real pain.
---
but yeah mana and casting speed are only minor inconveniences, the gcd is the real issue.
---
i saw SGC get DE'd on a stream once
---
painful af
---
&gt;and the Dark Irons on the other path aren't elites I'm fairly sure.
---
True story, I fell off the bridge a couple days ago, they aren't elite
---
Classic + will just be another retail trash game. The devs that made classic don’t work at blizzard anymore. 
---
Also blizzard north doesn’t exist anymore. Activision will ruin classic +
---
Everyone is over here doing blank while
---
I’m doing blank
---
^ totally correct. Insect swarm is awesome and for HotW I find that bear is better than cat for the spec
---
Sounds like you belong on a PvE server.
---
TBC has its faults, but classic + will just be another retail type trash game .
---
Blizzard north doesn’t exist anymore they don’t have the talent to make good games anymore, just trash games
---
“many Alliance” 
---
... should we tell him?
---
Use modifiers or other keys. I use 1-6 then q e r f g t, then shift and control modifiers for all of them.
---
Spit macro but no keybinds lmfao
---
Ok
---
Idk about you but if I can choose between all DPS doing 1500+ dps or 700 dps I'd most definitely choose the former. I'd much rather clear Naxx in less than 2 hours rather than 4-6 hours. It's not as if I dislike paladins, it's just that the price I pay for bringing one is my time that I would much rather spend PvPing or doing other content with the group I usually spend time with.
---
Your formula is wrong and [based on 1.8, not 1.12](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Normalization).
---
damage = base_weapon_damage + (weapon_speed * Attack Power / 14)
---
Sul'Thraze: 163 + (2.6 * 400 / 14) = 237
---
Scepter: 190 + (3.4 * 400 / 14) = 287
---
Sul'Thraze is hot garbage

---
This thread is about the kill, I don't care about his reputation because that's not something this subreddit was made to discuss, it's about classic wow and a 10 man onyxia kill recorded is worth looking at if you ask me, yeah maybe the world first meme could be edited out, but it's just a meme ( like the other one thousand on front page ), of course I know it's not the world first. 
---
All I can say to the other comments, I don't care, I'm not him and his reputation is his to manage. Derailing those threads on personal comments is against the sub rules, so I don't personally see a point to replying
---
Thanks! I’ll check it out
---
Pretty sure that's the bridge near the mob that drops Tidal.Charm? For all we know, thst guy helped him get there faster.
---
I think it's more fun to heal without addons. It's already a braindead task and healbot makes it even more painful.
---
Thank you!
---
it does unless you put off all your gear beforehand
---
PvE players had a massive advantage over non PvE players in TBC (and wrath). Rod of the Sun King is available in Season 2 and is better than S3 weapons. Warglaives go without saying. Mages basically had to PvE as that was the only way to get Haste on many pieces. PvE healers get access to trinkets and rings that put their mana regen on another level. Archimonde drops disgustingly strong gear for any class.
---
I think he means game master not guild
---
Someone in a different thread said "Depends on what class you are. Before Giantslayer it's one of the best Hunter PvP helms." 
---
You're going to end up in melee sometimes, the point is survivability enough to be able to disengage. Seems decent for that, no?
---
true, but that slot is easily worth it.
---
that’s fair but it’s also worth mentioning that full or semi-full bis with mostly naxx gear is really fucking hard to get. guilds finish kt and are for raid purposes “done” the game. a few weeks worth of clearing naxx you still only have maybe 2-3 pieces of gear on average per raider. you’ve got to be farming naxx for months to get all the gear you need to beat out r14 gear and getting your 39 friends to keep going for weeks of farming the last content after already “finishing” the game on a fully progressed server is a big task in itself. a lot of people going for r14 do it just to have the certainty they’ll actually get the gear their working towards.
---
You should be able to post in /2 or /lookingforgroup a message “   /2 DPS + HEALS (whatever role) looking to find a raiding guild, I’m a deaf player but with my friend I won’t miss out on any strategies!”
---
Or you can just join the discord and not say anything, look up the fights before hand and study them extra hard, if you’re a healer you need to have a lil communication with raid leaders so just try to squeeze that in. 
---
I’m shocked more people aren’t accommodating you and I think that’s because you haven’t found the right places to look
---
Use "squares" options at the bottom of raid frames settings.
---
Weapon speed means if you miss a hit you're without rage for that much longer.
---
Skeleton costume gives you underwater breathing and ghost gives levitation (walk on water/no fall damage)

As a Tank hero, live long enough and you became the villian.
---
I imagine they would include exactly what was available at the time. Seems reasonable
---
Great combo, grays! I always upvote discipline priests :)
---
I switched to holy at level 20. Never since put any points in in wand or spirit tap. I leveled mostly doing dungeons above my level so always had upgrades waiting in the bank. Questing was still doable, but slow. So if you like healing that is definitely viable too.
---
Can devulsaur be tamed?
---
Ok I want to roll on that server now, that’s a classy fucking advert.
---
i do that for every raid too, 50g per respec, so 100g per week for respec, its not that much, its like 2hours of farming
---
I’ve got 3 blood. But what are they used for?
---
How sweet. Brings a tear to me heart.
---
oof, what a dumb rogue. the warrior was way too nice to that idiot haha.

Version 1.11 -

 \* Writing \`/fl w\` without a session name will use the current minimap zone for a session name

 \* Fixed some bugs occurring when deleting a session

 \* Buttons added to loot window: sort by name/gold/kills
---
Basically the pitiful sarcasm attempt of a casual LFR hero who doesn't get invited to retail groups because he's a horrible underachiever. Yawn.
---
It's not that romantic honestly,everyone was hanging out in the raid talking,I was super shy about talking on vent usually and they said I couldn't raid if I didn't use it, I got high and started talking and I became friends with a lot of them. He whispered to me that I sounded cute and we ended up talking till around 6 in the morning. We lived 12 hours apart and it took 2 years but we finally met in person and he proposed not long after.
---
If you're talking about being the main Healer while specced as Shadow, you'll be more than competent.  
---
If you're talking about doing mostly DPS with the occasional heals to help out, it won't be as easy to find a spot because you'll be competing with all the other DPS for the slot. I'm not sure what level you get Vampiric Embrace but once you do, you'll probably do more healing than the main Healer. Especially on trash pulls, unless it's something big the passive healing will normally handle it.
---
Sorry I agree with the rogue. If you are tanking a dungeon you get tank gear. If you want dps gear you HAVE to let the group know before you start, then they will decide if they want to stay and have competition.
---
That’s like my priest healing a dungeon and I just start rolling on caster gear because I’m gonna spec shadow and pvp. Doesn’t work like that.
---
If you don’t communicate you roll on gear based on your role.
---
Hey someone on here from my server!
---
Note a more usual solution for this problem is to simply not invite a rogue.
---
Rogues, to succeed in WoW you need to work on your social engineering. A lot.
---
Just use the interact with target keybind and use friendly nameplates after the first time.. its not that hard.
---
Except having the second highest attack speed after Broken Tooth.
---
Name change = I ninja'd the thing/robbed the guild bank and want to hide my tracks.
---
&gt; its pre raid BiS
---
It\`s also PvP BiS.
---
Miniscule difference really.
---
Congratulations! Your UI is so weird to me though... Why you got a swing-timer as a Priest? And most importantly... *why do you have so many buttons around your minimap?!*
---
Mortal strike does weapon damage + x. The slower the weapon is, the more damage MS do.
---
I personally like that the pve gear that really puts you over the top in pvp is really gated (time-gated, luck-gated, social-gated, etc.). PvP gear has some gates too but it’s just easier and more consistent to get so everyone just has it after a few weeks. I find it more fun when good gear for your spec is just good gear not “good for this specific purpose”. Just makes the world feel more cohesive when you have to venture deep into Ragnaros lair with 39 other people to get the gear that will make you stronger and let you stand out in the world and in battle instead of just by waiting a few weeks to accumulate somewhat obfuscated points to buy gear from vendors.
---
No.
---
Free naxx entry afaik. I didn’t play vanilla
---
A lot of toxic comments above.
---
Congrats mate! Well done :D
---
Meanwhile here I am, level 43... I mean I missed two or three weeks even though I played on release but damn seeing so many 60s makes me jealous.
---
How do I set a raid marker icon as my icon in a macro? I have keybinds for them to mouse over mark an unit but the macro itself shows as a ? on my action bar and I don't like that.
---
Yes because we all know how Warlocks have severe mana issues and absolutely no way to quivkly regenerate it.
---
Would hate to have a class lead not looking at damage yikes
---
-Yesterday in DM with prot pala tank and feral druid
---
-First 5 resets I pugged MC full clears
---
-Early morning or just clear competition camp their corpse one or twice and they leave
---
-People camping doesnt mean theyre botting
---
I dont see a problem here
---
The I see it your giving them the chance to do the hidden quest down there. You’re just being a helpful horde.
---
It would be level 50 enchanting before long, but yes totally.
---
Goldshire Inn?
---
Grats!
---
He’s right.
---
He just has a crazy fast attack speed over others, I don't think his model is unique .
---
Remove the 1% miss on bosses (wotlk)
---
Had the same bug. And then the next chest didn't spawn at the appropriate time.
---
If only there was a way for paladins to be immune to stuff, then this poor dwarf could've survived the troll.
---
Who else remembers noxxromos_door ?
---
Yesterday I rolled need on both "tank" and dps capes in stratholme and won both, the rogue must have been super pissed :s he only asked why tf i didnt leave him the 2nd one but that is actual pre raid bis :s
---
Thank you! Keep it simple people and stop being sour :)
---
It's pretty much guaranteed that any warrior tank in a dungeon is going to be rolling on DPS gear. If only prot warriors tanked dungeons, it would be much harder to find tanks
---
Grats  homie ! Go incendius !!
---
True true... but salt is also salty
---
Is this actually a common occurence for you guys that side with the rogue?  That you are often playing with PUG tanks who only want to tank and only want tank gear, because everything I had read so far indicated the exact opposite and Prot warriors make up less than 10% of the population.
---
I've never seen this crop up in any discussion about tanking before but if it is a thing I can start to make that clear when I invite people.
---
Missed guild's Molten Core run and ended up having to PUG it for that week.  
---
Won t1 priest bracers, and cauturizing band from the same boss with a 92 and 96 roll vs 8 other healers.
---
Like what paddy said toxic comments above and can’t be happy for anyone. 
---
I appreciate the time and server.
---
Bigglesworth as a whole is legit. Horde is great on Biggles, too
---
I can't decide between leveling my mage (lvl 26) or my priest (lvl 20) to 60. There are a couple of things that worry me about both classes, and the indecision is killing my hype.
---
**Mage:** being a pure dps class I would only have to farm for 1 set for pve and 1 for pvp, which is nice. So is the ability to farm gold very quickly. The drawbacks however are that gear is probably highly contended as a mage because I hear that there are ALOT of mages out there.
---
**Priest:** Having to farm for a healing and a dps set for pve/pvp makes it seem like the time investment would be alot worse. Also I'm unsure how good priests are with farming gold as opposed to mages. I've also read on this sub that shamans/druids are underrepresented. Would that mean that I run into the same problem as a mage, where the gear for priests is highly contested?
---
To summarize: How much worse are priests in farming gold than mages? How much difference is there between the classes in gear contention? If any of you have any arguements for leveling a mage or a priest, it would be much appriciated.
---
Meanwhile as a shaman heal I ran UBRS like 3-4 times. The loot in that dungeon is so fucking worthless for me.
---
Don't let the charger fall out gang
---
You need what you will use. You greed what you'll sell. It is that simple.
---
The fact that many Warrior tank items are the same as Warrior DPS items even strengthen your right.
---
Its great for pvp, gearing up BiS (you can go both roles in dungeons) and grinding mobs on the side while u healing/tanking dungeons.
---
In raids u'll get outhealed/outmana-ed by moonglow heal spec hard tho... so yeah its possible there aswell but if u want to heal as much as possible for your raids its not the spec to go.
---
Seems like at revered it's 30g, 2x arcane crystals and 1x nexus crystal. So, doesn't really seem worth getting exalted.
---
Personally I just keybind it to my mouse button
---
Subscriptions don't make blizzard their main profit, in game purchases do.  Classic doesn't have those, so of course blizzard would prefer to keep retail.
---
What is your question?
---
I would rather roll on 0 tank gear and just DPS my way into raids, the tanking is a means to an end, the end being getting your DPS gear.  If I could even get into an occasional team where the warrior tank would not roll on warrior dps gear I'd take the dps spot, but you're living in some fantasy if you think that exists outside of guild teams.
---
Got tidal Charm.
---
&gt;It's not the players fault that Blizzard made a ton of the good loot for hunters and fury warriors leather.
---
i never said it was. 
---
&gt; Shit, hunters use leather for 40 levels then suddenly I'm supposed to stick to stickly mail that's mostly all bad for me?
---
again, blizz's fault and why i wanted to keep this discussion around.
---
&gt;Sorry but that's just the way it goes, you're gonna have to compete for gear where ever you go, and yes people don't want tons of rogues since it makes it harder for them to get stuff they want.
---
compete for several times as long to finish the same sort of gear quality at pre-bis, and what is probably 150-200% as long for raid BiS at each tier. 
---
I don't really get this response though, you acknowledge there's a problem but the only response is "lol deal with it xD". rather than that, why isn't it "yeah, it'd be nice if blizz fixed mail gear for hunters as it kinda sucks for us too, let's try and make more noise and see if it can maybe be fixed one day for classic too!"
---
I am thinking to go solo build for the week to make some gold as I'm horrible at making gold and want epic mount and stuff. Anyway. Currently I'm ap/frost for Mc and have no experience with farming or aoe farming but will try various aoe farming / solo elite farming (like Hearthglen) and such and thinking of a build.
---
I basically made this:

---
The question is if this is mainly solo play (might do some instance runs of course) should I take imp frost nova or rather 4 points in winter's chill? Or any other feedback? I could drop a lot of the arcane stuff but I figured arcane meditation helps to decrease downtime and not having it would make me really terribly useless in instances so I don't think I can skip that.
---
The devilsaur market is crashing. Skins are down to 5g on my realm and falling since so many people have their DS gear already and the spawns are camped. Not that it’s terrible, just that it’s not as good as it was.
---
But you still commented with confidence as if you did know 👌
---
I have my single target heals set on Healbot.  
---
(And they are bound on a second bar in case HB malfunctions and I need to heal without it.)
---
There must be something else bound then which doesnt make sense, I wouldn't have commented otherwise
---
*looks at your list of rogue, hunter, lock*
---
Ahh. You replicate the WoW player base in general, in that you don't want to tank or heal.
---
Think about the two things every dungeon being done at a challenging level of level and gear needs.
---
Hmmm.
---
And if we have a whole player base who want to do DPS *thinking*.
---
Youre bad at this lol.
---
Leatrix Plus has an option to remove them a long with many other options.
---
Do tell how you farm 50g/h
---
Getting gold is easier than people make it out to be. As a holy priest I got the gold for my epic mount, got my max tailoring and Truefaith Vestment and Hide of the Wild and I say I farmed like 7-8 hours total at level 60. There is nothing really to spend gold on (except getting exalted with another race for a different mount) so farming gold is not important.
---
 Getting gear is very easy in dungeons and I would say getting your preraid BiS is actually the easiest with priest. And in raids I would say its about the same. There are usually the number of mages and priests, but it is easier to find a guild with priest.
---
Pathetic
---
I feel like I am missing more with my auto attacks when mobs are at low health (me often low health and mana too). Is that possible?
---
Wrong. You want rank 1 frostbolt to fish for clearcasting procs.
---
Wdym
---
Attack power does not give flat dmg?
---
How does i calculate? 
---
So 1h gets less from atk pwr than twohand?
---
Our work schedules are very similar, which helped. And Ubish has an alt on the rare chance that Uthan and I were not available. But we did get a couple bars off here and there (class quests, professions) and just readjusted as we went. Right before dinging, Ubish and I had to kill some mobs to line up within the quest turn-in.
---
I liked Bartender the most, many options to provide what you want. The only thing you lose with Bartender is the latency bar. Plus keybinding the keys to the Bartender ones is super nice, as it's done on the UI itself, rather than some window with a list. 
---
I see you've had issues with Bartender, but not sure why (beyond "I don't want reverse engineered bars"). Bartender bars do everything you can do with the default bars. But more. Some of my favourite things about Bartender (everything can be turned off, on, tweaked, etc:
---
* OOM colour tint to skills
---
* Out of range tint to the whole skill art, instead of just the hotkey.
---
* Full positional, scale, alpha options for everything (including determining the dimensions of the bars, like 2x6, etc). 
---
* Conditional state control for all the elements (invisible when X, rollover effects, etc). My favourite is making the XP bar invisible until rollover. 
---
* Profiles and presets. Each character can have their own bar layout, keybinds, etc. Or you can give them all the same one. The presets give you Blizz-like, double bar (replaces the micro menu and bag bar with another action bar). Or my favourite, the stacked preset. Which is a series of action bars stacked on top of each other.
---
* A couple options for Blizzard art: you can change the gryphon side-arts, and button background arts to lions, which scream Alliance even more. Or turn off all the art if you want. 
---
If you're still stalwart on keeping your default bars for some reason, I think you're out of luck. You'd have to make do with default bars and *only* default bars.  :)
---
Lmao u guys be twisted over nothing at all xDDD
---
Not to be that guy but people like you actually make me sick.
---
Feel better now ? Lololol
---
If you’re a Druid on horde you can farm the shellfish in Desolace.  Pre-40 it’s good money.  After 40 just grinding mobs and vendoring trash nets more money.  Especially if you’re a skinner.
---
just buy intellect and stamina gear you are missing off the AH.
---
I have come to hate all undead players. i havent met a single cool undead player
---
ffs come at me with honor or let me pve in peace
---
The 28 one is what I started out with before I got hit with du-alt-itis, so technically no one. I sometimes have him on follow when starting out a new char to make sure I don't have to worry about health until I hit my 20s.
---
Was that guy really crying on emperor neck when his bis is mark of fordring?
---
My single target heals are set on Healbot, but are bound on my second action bra in case that malfunctions and I need to still be able to heal.
---
If a tank rolls on the savage gladiator chain that tank is getting blacklisted by my guild and all the guilds we are friendly with.
---
Dude, I was AFK in winterspring inn earlier this morning. Went to make coffee and when I came back I was dead. Checked my combat log and it was some charming gentleman aptly named, Buttholl. I rezzed then /tar Buttholl, and lo and behold, there he was in the bank talking to the trade supplier, Qui. I ran in threw a /spit on him and ran out. Then I went into cat form, stealthed and walked right back in. Sat my ass in stealth on the sole banker and hoped he left something in there. He did. I saw that determined gnome skip of determination walking right back towards me. I had him. I was 57, he was 56, and I had improved stealth in cat form. He slapped my little invisible cat ass and was promptly gangbanged by the goblin guards. I sat there /spitting and /laughing as fast as my hands could emote. I think he noticed it late because he didn’t react right away, but at half health he started moving his character. Instead of vanishing though, he used his precious last few to /laugh and /sorry. I giggled a bit. You can usually get people with it once, but after that they get a little wary. It’s not like you can’t play around it.
---
Good point. I think we forgot to check since our where on cool down from hearthing back to south shore when this debacle started. It was fun I jumped off after 20 mins to see if I could figure it out but in the end I had to throw in the towel and declare the only way out was group Suicide. :P
---
U
---
Rolling need on BoE gear makes it soulbound (like on retail)
---
If you thought the tank shortage is bad now, it would be really bad if you had no fury/arms tanks anymore.
---
You would be looking for hours and prob not finding anyone.
---
BiS comment!
---
Hand of Justice first BRD run. Then stockade pauldrons and force of will the run after that.
---
I'd believe Prot warriors make up 10% of the Warrior population.
---
Of course, only a small percentage of them want to tank for PUGs.
---
Why isn’t the flight master attacking him?
---
you never use innervate on healer unless you're feral or a healer yourself
---
Is there an 30 Int and 30 Stam Staff I could get? Using an Staff of the Eagle with 15 in each stat for ZF Farming.
---
And somewhere far away stands a lonely human priest who just wants her ram 😂
---
Then congrats on making guild blacklists.
---
I knew PvP in classic wasn't perfect... but 40 second polymorphs in PvP? Is this intentional? I opened up on a mage and he polymorphed, got out of combat, drank, and continued polymorph spamming. Then nova. Then polymorph spam again.
---
I think it is more poor social skills (lack of tact) at both sides, so the discussion gets too aggressive from the start.  
---
But from my experience it's indeed expected to discuss this at the  start so everybody knows what to expect.
---
P
---
" its literally just flurry + BT"
---
Its flurry, enrage, deathwish, unbridled, and incentive to dual wield. Collectively these talents function to increase your damage -&gt; increase rage -&gt; increased threat. Particularly on horde it is not difficult for even a moderately geared warlock or fury warrior to be limited by tank threat.
---
Nelf with Hand of Ragnaros, absolute haram.
---
I thought we were all agreed the new meta was magetards.
---
I am now envisioning the scene from the end of Gladiator, but with Mankirk meeting her in the Barrens in a ghostly field.
---
I use Buffwatch: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/buffwatch-classic
---
Yes. Just look at the Blizzcon schedule. Nothing about Classic whatsoever. 
---
I think Blizzard will just ignore and deny Classic and its success, and keep promoting their money making machine Retail, hoping people will jump to retail when they get bored of Classic.
---
They won't update Classic with TBC or Classic Plus, they'll want it to die a horrible death so that people go to Retail. This was their plan all along.
---
How do you get past that mid-game grind where you start having to just kill NPCs constantly to level? This stage is killing the game for me because I get so bored of it and wish I could skip a little to get towards new things to do.
---
I don't believe you! Where is the Reddit post?
---
no
---
So your tank can never get dps gear? He’s tanking to do the dungeon, not because he’s prot. If an upgrade drops for his spec (which isn’t prot), then he can need on it like anyone else. Same with the shadow priest who is healing. If an item drops for them, they can need it. We all do these dungeons to get the gear we need.
---
Hey! I've been checking him regularly since server launch, sitting around for a few hours when I found time to. When it dropped I had been waiting for 9h for him to spawn. I started off by spamming a /tar macro, but now there's a working unitscan for classic! It wont auto-target for you, but it will alert you when he spawns, so you can keep wow on in the background while doing other stuff. It's all about patience tbh, sit around one day for long enough to see him die, then he will spawn 32-48 hours from that point onwards. A tip is to bring Greater Water Breathing Potions so you can sit in stealth if there is lots of competition.  Swim Speed Potions are also nice to find him quickly. Good luck!
---
I must get to 300 skinning
---
I really wish boomers will realize that no one cares about their blacklists, lol.
---
squares and self buffs/debuffs with named spell or id ?
---
I'm still feeling like a boss over it.
---
Destruction.
---
I can help you, have to do the quest chain and travel there. Ign cptberio
---
Ever heard of mortals?
---
Attack power gives DPS. If your AP gives you 10dps your 1.5 speed weapon will get 15 damage. Your 2.5 speed weapon would get 25 damage. Do you understand?
---
Takes my upvote and goose-step outta here already
---
You’re not in the wrong. You’re a dps warrior pug tanking for gear. Don’t let these people tell you that you can’t roll on the gear you need. As you pointed out, you won’t be tanking raids. Probably ever. You need dps gear.
---
Discord is garbage, the death of gaming pretty much. Cross faction colab, things like this and so on.
---
Anyway just have him join discord? I usually mute during raids anyway nobody would notice that he doesn't speak/"listen".
---
Well I dunno but I will bet most ppl playing classic eventually will play retail. I know I will. 
---
My hope is that retail moves towards what was the essence of vanilla.
---
I quested 1-60, and sometimes felt like there were too many quests to do.
---
I guess you were abused in ZF too much huh?
---
Why do all undead rogues have edgelord names? Darkstab, cheaptrix, Forsakenkill
---
Not bannable 100%.
---
I got the +healing breacers from Incendius on my fifth or so kill.
---
So I rolled a night elve druid, but both of my friends went for gnomes, would I be missing out on anything important for druids if I went to quest in Dun Morough from lvl 1 on?
---
Yea, I hate that everyone and their mama needs cloth items, not only are there 3 cloth classes, but paladins and druids often need them too on top of their own gear. 
---
Warriors on the other hand can hog all the loot. Paladins are healbots so generally aren't given dps items when a warrior needs them and they're the only plate class that uses strength 2hs and plate. 
---
Another thing I hate is randoms(that I'm not grouped with or in the same guild) whispering me for portals and water. I don't even carry portal runes with me, bag space in classic is too limited. 
---
And finally, low HP and drinking. I'm leveling a combat rogue alt now and whoever said mages have it easy had to be lying. As a rogue I have no downtime at all and kill stuff almost as fast. Just have to bandage for a few seconds every now and then instead of sitting down and drinking for 40s after killing 2-4 mobs.
---
Poor rogues they have the hardest time finding groups
---
I got a crafting item last night that vendors for 10s.  I log onto the auction house to find people had underbid each other so low the last item was up on the AH for 10s, 5 copper.  
---
I literally got so mad I bought every single one of them on the whole entire server and relisted them all for 2 gold.  The underbidders keep trying but as long as I have gold they will cost at least 2 gold on my server forever.  Out of spite.
---
Best offence trinket for a ret pala PVP for P2? 
---
I’ll have that and insignia - let me know!
---
epic mount will always be bis, gear gets replaced
---
There's probably some sort of transcription service available. It won't be perfect but it may be useful.
---
Whats the message? That you have a tiny dick?
---
To be fair, mages farm the fastest gold in the game. They don't play on the same level as other classes
---
Nah, tanks and Healers get to roll on off spec once they are done with their main spec, especially if it's a fury warrior tanking, and a Shadowpriest healing. They are the only two required roles, cater to them or make friend who will carry you for free.
---
&gt;MUH FEELINGS PLEASE STOP   
---
its ok don't cry
---
What addon (if any) is it called that adds a second bar above your main one for abilities? Also, is there an addon that will give you a list of items that a common mob will drop? Not in dungeons or raids but for example a wolf or defias guy.
---
They're always undead. I'm telling you, it's a fucking trend. The worst people are undead! ^^
---
Level warrior ironman style. That should take you a while.
---
Do those require 2 button presses or one?
---
I'd be happy to be blacklisted by such a stupid guild.
---
Why would he? The rogue isn't attacking.
---
Decided to go farm the Crusader enchant recipe and got it from the first mob.
---
Deliciously evil. Pvp servers never fail to entertain with the way you guys creatively ambush people. Nice work haha.
---
The simple way: Buff yourself, then everyone else. Keep track of your own buff, when yours is running down rebuff everyone including yourself. Basically, use your buff as a timer for everyone else's.
---
What's that top bar add on?
---
Join a less competent raid guild. Not like MC or Ony are difficult.
---
Late to the post but after over a month of raiding, I can say that the 6 piece shadow raft combined with any other gear whether it be cadaverous or devilsaur is absolutely insane for raiding. I cannot day for pvp but the set is so good. Consistently seeing both swords and daggers top dps purely from the set bonus. If you’re a rogue and you haven’t already geared yourself pre raid, fuck the bis list go 6 piece and devilsaur. This will give the more casual player extra time to farm for hoj and the baron cape.
---
I dont know if that is what you mean, but you can enable additional action bars in Interface Options -&gt; Action Bars.
---
What's the addon to your right do? Show cooldowns or something?
---
Nope! No addons needed - You go into System options, Advanced and then at the bottom there's a slider, you have to tick the box to enable it
---
Weapon skill 0/300
---
Yes you can track up to 7 buffs/debuffs
---
2 things come to mind. Got Dal'rend MH on my first kill, not even 60, unopposed. Got a Shackle Key in DM North, didn't even know what it did, went back later into someone else's cleared instance and got a Hide of the Wild pattern (sold for 200g almost instantly).
---
Damn i didnt even realise that isnt in classic, i assume it was a TBC addition then?
---
Guild bank
---
You've got it all wrong, that's just German for "the insect"!
---
But who decided that slow weapons are always better? I've leveled my warrior almost exclusively with DW, because it's Hella faster to kill enemies while soloing that way, the lack of top end DMG is more than weighed up by the fact they you almost and instantly have rage.
---
Reserving items is less restrictive than choosing it to invite entire classes.
---
I disagree, phase two should be pushed back.  I think they were wrong in releasing DM sooner  for “high” end players. Most are enjoying the ride as is an still have a good amount to accomplish left.
---
Just got Crusader to drop for farming only 15 minutes.
---
I mean... there's pve servers just for that
---
You need to do some quests in Darkshore and Moonglade at level 10 and 16, 20 to get some abilities like Bear Form, Cure Poison and Aquatic form.
---
This.
---
People are to dumb to talk or in pure intention, to be able to sorta ninja roll on gear, the group MAYBE had said no.
---
But no grp will say no if the tank says "I will also roll on dps gear". But IF there is someone bothered by it, he's free to leave beforehand.
---
Yes you’ll need to go back to Teldrassil to get your Druid specific quests to learn how to become a bear, aquatic form, cat form so lots of travel back and forth for you
---
That non-vanilla like delay on the PoV switching is triggering me so hard ingame
---
Makes the ability so much less useful
---
Because it's funny. It's a pvp server. Gotta expect it.
---
It just doesn't look right. It looks like they tried to make the default bars by fitting several loose pieces together, rather than it being one unit.
---
I was curious if weapon speed was normalized in this version, glad you mentioned this.
---
Warriors aren't in demand for five-mans.
---
*Tanks* are in demand for five-mans.
---
Because, without a tank, you can't do the content.
---
Got Executioner's Cleaver on my arms warrior at level 48 off of a random non-elite troll mob in the Hinterlands. I'm still shocked two weeks later.
---
I leveled my mage as fire, often killing mobs in the same area as those aoe mages. No regrets whatsoever. It's a PvP server .. lots of people around, so at best those AoE mages managed to grab 2-4 mobs and get ganked in the process.
---
If you wanted to respec into anything go fury/prot
---
Just pick up improved thread and last stand / imp shield block in prot, and the rest in fury.
---
Little bit less dps but you can tank fairly easily.
---
Make an alt, work on professions, work on grinding rep (exalted AD for Naxx? Frostsaber maybe?), world pvp, help any guildees that need dungeon gear still or farm mats for raid consumables when they're more needed, farm gold.
---
Sure I missed a lot but just some ideas for people that are bored already. If people like raid logging that's perfectly fine but the game is what we make of it. If we don't set goals besides get epics then we're only playing a small part of the game.
---
Instant attacks are just as instant on a slow weapon as they are on a fast weapon. If both weapons attack at the same time, the one with the bigger numbers hits better. Coz big
---
Also why kiting works well with a slow weapon. Once your swing timer is up you'll swing when you're next in range. If you're fighting someone with a 2.4 swing speed weapon, and you have a 3.2 swing speed weapon, and you kite them for 4 seconds between attacks, you'll be doing more damage, because both your weapons are hitting once every 4 seconds
---
Not sure where the rudeness comes from when it's a pvp server. I mean... don't go on it and complain you get fucked with.
---
BRD, actually. Grouped with a mage who would run in and pull with arcane explosion then tell me to hold aggro. I told him to go ahead and continue tanking while I whipped out my two-hander. Last mage I did a dungeon with.
---
Thats a dps loss. why would you do that instead of using proper buffs/consumables?
---
Fellow Alliance member on Herod. You should have no trouble finding groups, in general. Obviously your class/roll will effect this some, but Herod Alliance is well populated with tons of guilds of all levels of ability. There's also many MC or Ony pug raids throughout the week. Herod is one of the most populated US servers, just because the H:A ratio is unbalanced doesn't mean there's no one playing alliance.
---
It's also prePvP BiS for warriors. He really had no ground to complain.
---
I had a really bad time as fury prot in 5 mans. Lack of tactical mastery/anger management makes me feel very rage starved.
---
why would you suspect that?  they have no reason to rush
---
They were wrong for not releasing DM at launch, as we are not getting progressive itemization DM gear doesn’t really matter as much as it did back in the day.
---
Just because I’m a efficient player I should be held back in line like everybody else? What is this retail?
---
Get the +5 Mining on gloves enchant, it helps a lot and is pretty cheap ;)
---
Shamans can Tank
---
That was amazing!! I laughed my ass off.
---
Seriously I don’t understand this, half of the game is based around this content and everybody is okay with Blizzard sucking up their sub fees because people are slow levelers, come the fuck on.
---
What?
---
Kevin Jordan addressed this, they want shamans to have a low level dungeon tanking OPTION. But people try and blow it out of proportion that it was some kind of deeper meaning of late game tanking.
---
Ah someone on a thread said it makes the Sprint sound. That's why I asked tho. Because everything I googled was probably from retail or a PS. Hard to find any info on it
---
Cataclysm actually, they were part of the big guild revamp along with reputation and guild achievements.
---
I know... i wish i would be there. 50% of my game time is unnecessery corpse run. Even worse because my server is like 70% Horde
---
All my friends rolled PVP, and i play clasdic mostly because of them (played wow in middle school together)
---
Ah yes, nothing finer than finishing at the same time
---
Wtf?! Fade on 1?!
---
it wont last long because the minority population on every pvp server will NOT be able to play the game. There will be 5 horde camping the flight path, 5 horde camping the graveyard, and dozens more just running around. Your only Option will be to logout and hope they are not there 10 hours later.
---
Phase 2 will be so short.
---
Or we get phase 2.5 and get bgs right after the holidays.
---
Again, a lot of PvE gear was more than viable in arenas. Having stormherald in early TBC was a vastly better than glad weapons. To get a decent amount of points you would have to find 4 skilled people and then compete and other teams consistently, that is gating.
---
As we see now, MC is a joke and is pugged, yet brings gear that is comparable to the best ultimate PvP gear(which took months of gaming non-stop). 
---
For me standing out in the open with gladiator shoulders and title was vastly more fulfilling than going with anything special I got from PvE throughout the years.
---
Not to mention just how many people I saw that got carried by their gear in vanilla, when arenas came we at least saw just how bad they were.
---
I haven't heard this before but this should be at the top. It would prevent this need greed debate for epic and blue boes that people who actually need them get fucked over on.
---
left click interact is a ui option turned off by default
---
Tanks use a lot DPS gear a lot, though. In fact many items designed for tanking are flat out garbage and you'd be laughed at for using them instead of DPS options (cough onyxia trinket).
---
Oh it’s an attunement fee i thought that was everything you enter Naxx
---
Off-spec of their role in the group. He’s a tank rolling on dps gear, which is fine as long as you tell people beforehand. 
---
Would you be fine with a healer rolling on a caster piece or a dps rolling on a tank piece if they didn’t tell the group they were rolling on the gear before the dungeon started? If so that’s your opinion, but to me it seems wrong.
---
It does make that sound
---
Maybe take a week off to remember what it's like to not have to poop in a sock.
---
/thread
---
I didn't know it was possible to feel this jealous after one sentence but woop there it is
---
Same here!!!
---
Actually, it will, because all the farming I did was for, you guessed it, phase 2.
---
And if you don’t think there are guilds that have wayyyyy more saved up for future endeavors then you are sorely misled.
---
Also, it took me nearly two months to get to this point, I’d say that’s a decent chunk of time I’ve invested for myself, I don’t feel bad because I didn’t “take my time” and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience but now I’m ready to actually play the game I want to play and I know tons of other people that aren’t browsing the new section of this Reddit are too.
---
While doing your level 10 bear quest you get a spell to teleport to moonglade, and you can fly for free from there to darnassus, so after you get bear you'll be fine setting your hearth in stormwind and mostly staying over there with them. I wouldn't bother trying to get over and meet up before then though, but you can get to 10 in one 4ish hour session
---
There's also an arena in Dire Maul as well
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA038fP9Hu4&amp;t=175s
---
Warden Staff dropped for me. Sold a week later for like 330g, *after* DM had already relesed.
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn
---
&gt; You target 1 enemy, taunt it.
---
No. RD didn't ever work like that. You're thinking of Wrath, when we had both RD (3 mobs from a single friendly) and Hand of Reckoning (single target taunt +minor holy damage). The only way to have an "it just works" taunt in BC was with a target-of-target macro, and there was no way to avoid taking the extra targets.
---
Because most guides are clueless. Hurr durr warrior = blacksmith.
---
Extremely relevant username.
---
Aww don't hate all mages cuz some are "special" the zf aoe farm really did a number on proper mage play.
---
I hope they ban you so you really dont have anything to do.
---
Try the world channel or general chat in dire mail. It’s legit. They have the mats to summon the spirit which they bought when they fit their mount
---
Ah cool. That's fine then, as long as I can hear it. Was hoping it would pop up like riposte does. I'm guessing the thrash blade and HoJ are similar?
---
It has an animation aswell like a small wind slash in front
---
Best zone to level a 51 warrior?
---
Check out cludes warrior 2.0 weak auras
---
That's great you have that much free time I think this loading screen tip is relevant though- Bring your friends to Azeroth, but don't forget to go outside Azeroth with them as well.
---
Fix Classbalance and/or Fix Itemization/1 Set for every Specc.
---
Wait. Is it normalized? Why tf are people so much up in the air about it then?
---
Yeah I’m fine with the healer rolling on caster dps because like 99% of the time they aren’t specced for healing. They’re healing so we can do the dungeon.
---
Gtfo with this bullshit. We are all here for the gear. You’re gonna have to roll for it like everyone else.
---
Instance hopping was the bannable offense, layer-hopping was actually encouraged by Blizzard if your layer was too crowded and boy oh boy let me tell you man my layers were PACKED I promise ;)
---
Look for Hakurai's guide on YouTube. He leveled as a warrior and did it with acceptable speed.
---
His guide is also available in text.
---
I used to shit myself when seeing one prot pally in wotlk
---
You got all the recipes for your profession?
---
Have you explored all the zones?
---
Have you grinded the winterspring mount?
---
Have you collected all the pets?
---
You got Best in every slot?
---
You collected Best in slot for PvP with current content?
---
Have you made your alchemy alt?
---
Got all the Best enchants possible?
---
To sum it up; vanilla was like this for many people many times through out. Waiting for the next content patch, but finding lots of other stuff to do.
---
Instead of checking one by one, go off of the time remaining on your blessing that you gave yourself. Also a UI add on like perl, will show the actual buffs of your party members on your UI.
---
Like the ravager greenish slash?
---
Why do people think that people who played vanilla are boomers? The game released in late 2004, not 1974.
---
No thank you, this is a huge error that Blizzard made. It's a "good QoL change" that dilutes meaningful decisions /consequences. You should be thinking about who you group with and know you're in it together, win or lose. I've been burned by the one boss kill MC disband and I still wouldn't have it any other way.
---
This is how you create toxicity overnight where you're just a means to someone's end and they're only there for that one boss. People become less connected and patient in the snap of a finger because there's no consequences to your actions. This is the one wipe and done cultures inception. 
---
I promise you this is a masked QoL change that erodes what makes classic, classic.
---
I feel like I would just hearth or log off tbh...
---
Of course shaman can tank
---
Mostly edgelords play undead.  I've never understood the appeal as a race, playing a zombie.  I don't understand playing as a human either though.
---
So that means I can use 12 binds only, right? Cause that's the limit for 1 action bar
---
True shot aura and tranq shot are the only reason a hunter is in a raid atm. Set up for that and get ready for leaf quest.
---
Anything that isnt bleeding edge retail top 10 isnt hardcore. Yet people are assholes, even more when they are bad. What exactly is your point. Classic isn't ''hard''
---
I actually prefer to play alone
---
You have UBRS for that.
---
&gt;WoW subs tripled at Classic Launch and we're probably still half or more of the total subs.
---
literally nobody knows what the sub numbers are or what ratio of people play retail vs classic vs both
---
But it’s efficient and makes the wiping process way easier.
---
It’s not selfish. He just assisted in a 40 minute dungeon run and you’re begrudge him rolling on a piece of gear he can use? Fuck off.
---
not everything is projection, it's just not very interesting that a hunter has tamed broken tooth
---
Wtf dude? Lol I’m baffled 
---
10/10 troll
---
Well done
---
If that part of the game is killing you, then this game might not be for you.  Everything is a grind in WoW.....everything.
---
I dont really understand what you are after, as a druid player I sure learned how to make macros. But you ought to be more specific. 
---
Else you might as well read the wiki from top to bottom.
---
Thank you! I will
---
A little bit like that but much smaller and in white really subtle
---
If you don't have 9% hit yet (which is cap), that should be your priority damage wise. Although getting hit capped as Hunter is quite easy as you can get items such as warmonger and trueaim gauntlets which together effectively give you about 7,5% hit.
---
So I would go for trueshot aura at the least, and then most likely bm for pet survivability/damage for doing solo content such as maraudon farming and just allround efficiency.
---
For maximum dps in raids you should go sv after trueshot aura for the dragonkin/humanoid slaying and sure-footed (if needed) as your pet will die in raids if you don't know every aoe mechanic, of which there are a lot.
---
You can’t only like PVP when it’s convenient for you on a PvP server.  That is the function of PVE realms. The world is alive and that’s part of the charm of PVP servers.  You never know when someone’s gonna be a dick like that, and if you wanna be the dick then you have every right to go be the best Dick you can possibly be.  I personally think it’s better this way.  Not having control over my own fate sometimes helps with immersion and makes it feel more like a real live world.... of Warcraft.
---
1 - didnt say "if wow were real life"
---
2 - there many things in video games that are based on realistic perspective, what's the problem with that?
---
What is the 28 / 86 thing under the portraits? Kind of lines up with your co-ordinates, is it that?
---
I just saw the first sword spec proc. Probs wasn't the first, but I was the green slash. Hard to hear with all the poison proc sounds happening lol
---
I saw posts about people being given warnings for it about a month ago.
---
What Is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?
---
You just fell behind, no guide will save you from that. Do a dungeon or two to catch up.
---
Funny you say that most of my buddies IRL play WoW and we met in elementary school because of this game. Couple of them are in my guild and work 9-5 jobs some with wives/kids and still are getting to the point I’m at, it’s impressive that I’m being roasted for my playtime when it’s not even close to most streamers/hardcore guilds, I just play the game.
---
Didnt realize it was a pug
---
You don't understand how this game was meant to be played. Like most 15 year old games it meant to take longer to get things done. Layers killed this. Why do you need gold for p2. ? If you want to play wow retail is that way untill than you have to wait . They didn't give out a time map it could be months till honor is in. And that didn't even include bgs. 
---
"Actually play the game I want" hahaha leveling was 90% of vanilla..
---
The raids should be tuned up anyway because they are incredibly easy, so that sounds like a win win
---
Based.
---
I disagree. Hunters do just fine damage especially at this stage and can kite at majordomo for example.
---
&gt; I perosnally can’t lead a raid group so i cant make my own group.
---
What's preventing you?
---
Now picture 40 people in Naxx with lacking knowledge, some with high ping, most with low fps, some with unstable connection. Yeah.
---
I really really like the new models.
---
It’s not that I fell behind. Guide says “grind to level 47, then go X for next step”.  Next step is a quest killing level 48 mobs. I’m following the guide to a T. It just sucks for rogues
---
Idk why people bash on LFR so much
---
If you're a raider you can just completely ignore it.
---
And if you're very casual it gives u a chance to see the raids
---
Rolling a tank is the high life. I'm at the point where I just say no to any group that can't port me and I still get groups basically instantly to wherever I want to go. Its insane.
---
Taking time out of your day to be a shit to a stranger. This is what you just did. He went to his favorite place to get answers for his wow classic question, the classic wow subreddit. You figger it out.
---
The answer is in the tooltip... Tradeskill Master
---
You got all the recipes for your profession? Yes
---
Have you explored all the zones? Who cares
---
Have you grinded the winterspring mount? Horde
---
Have you collected all the pets? Wtf lol
---
You got Best in every slot? Yes besides the ring off rag
---
You collected Best in slot for PvP with current content? That’s why I want phase 2 captain 
---
Have you made your alchemy alt? Of course 
---
Got all the Best enchants possible? See question 1.
---
&gt;To sum it up; vanilla was like this for many people many times through out.
---
I agree, but that was also before the game was created. I don’t want to pay a sub fee and to wait for Blizzard to cash in and then release the content when they please, especially considering it’s already made.
---
The biggest problem was their general gearing philosophy for hybrids from the beginning. It wasn't really until BWL that Blizzard finally understood that "gear adequate for anything" actually meant "gear garbage for literally everyone". Even as a Warrior, who has very simple needs all things considered, nearly my entire t0 set is garbage for every spec. No hit, no crit, no defense, no dodge, bizarre allocation of stat points...Like yeah, I looked at the *of the Bear* green I was wearing, and though all that strength was wasted points that could be used for agility and spirit.
---
Used Krol from 51 to 60, amazing weapon. Used it with Mirah until I got both Dal's and really, the damage difference is not that much.
---
"Severe".
---
Use a succubus if you are concerned for the ambush kick combo.
---
I still haven't figured it out:(
---
They can, when i inspect people i can see their talents.
---
It's not a question of efficiency, but just plain old spending too much time on the game.
---
What do you expect of PvP in Classic? It's going to be just a burst game. Without resilience it's gonna get old very fast.
---
I don't really remember tbc for daily quests. Weren't they added on the island with Sunwell towards the end? Might be wrong though
---
Yeah, demographically most of my guild is millenials or younger. We have 1 person who's in his 50's and that's it. If your only insult is to call us boomers then you've got no arguments and are likely a complete moron.
---
That's what I was arguing with a friend of mine about last night. Mother fucker takes three hours of his week to go on all his alts and post shit to the AH.... That would be an entire days worth of time for me. I get lucky if I even get three hours on in one sitting. I'd rather post that shit at a price I KNOW it is going to sell and move on my merry way.
---
Being a tank and rolling on dps gear is wrong. Unless you state it at the beginning of the dungeon  that you are rolling for dps gear. 
---
I am a feral druid - cat dps mostly run with guildies who know that I am a dps and just tank dungeons when they need me to but if I go pug, and end up tanking, I tell them from the start that I am going to roll for the items I need for my main spec - dps. 
---
Be fair with your party member and let them know that even though in this current time you are tanking you are actually dps and you rolling for your dps gear. I am sure it will prevent any of this unpleasant situations.
---
Lvling a warrior with a slow 2h, for example Whirlwind axe, is the must stupid someone can do. Still they do it and insist its the "best of the best of the best" you can do. But that's bullshit in every aspect. WHILE LVLING! That's important. 
---
The faster a 2h is, the more auto hits you do, more Heroic Strike and more generated rage. Also, faster attack speed on a 2h applies directly a higher chance to hit more often. Simple example, if you're missed/dodged/blocked/parried 3 times in a row with WW axe, you've done 0 dmg for 11 seconds, while you've done 4 hits with WW sword and the last hit decided between your or the bears dead.
---
Higher 2h speed while lvling warrior = the higher your dmg.
---
It just depends on who did the theory and whether or not they did it right.
---
Private server stuff had a lot wrong with it that they just now found out about so who knows for sure.
---
I know that for paladins with seal of command the theory is that seal of command has a sort of RPPM mechanic and won't proc more than 7 times a minute. This limitation makes you want a slower weapon since 7 bigger procs mean more than 7 smaller ones.
---
I haven't tested this myself but this is what the guides say.
---
&gt; I sense someone would be a riot at parties...FUN POLICE HAVE ARRIVED.
---
While I don't think that this is a bannable offense, griefing by definition is not fun for anyone but the one doing it. So yes, at parties nobody would care or be entertained by griefing.
---
Its cause they have nice shoes.
---
Oh yeah I completely agree with you and if they decide to let phase 2 last a long time I’d be fine with it, I just know that they probably won’t and will succumb to the complaints of the people who are controlling the games timegate right now (the people shitting on me in this thread ;)) and release a BG or two early.
---
I'm glad they at least met us in the middle on this one. They doubled the actual cap going into classic.
---
WPL or Felwood, maybe?
---
I think phases should take 6 months each to really milk the shit out of Classic WoW. We waited 15 years for it to come out, why don't we enjoy it and not rush through it? Get every class to 60 and actually learn and gear each class before you say you're bored. Do every raid, explore every zone, get rank 14 in pvp when ranks come out in phase 2.
---
I’m 2 pieces removed from full set, hunters are not top of the board, if you are then your raid is doing something wrong. Hunters are definitely not needed at domo..rethink strat as there are better ways.
---
Ironfoe first run.
---
First rich thorium vein gave me two arcane christals.
---
Resilience ruined PVP, the whole point of raiding is to bring your sweet epics into BGs and pwn face.
---
Also, I’ve played on enough private servers to know what to expect, I just don’t want my sub fee being prolonged because people level slow :).
---
Here’s a fun fact about fun. It’s subjective.
---
Hey! I saw perplexitys stream some days ago and I noticed he had his healthbars like in this vod:  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/498448214](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/498448214)   
---
I believe he got RealMobHealth addon to show the exact hp on himself + mobs he's targeting. But I can't figure out for the love of god how to make it like he do. I want to it show the exact hp, (let's say 3909 hp), but when I enable realmobhealth and enable the exact value in blizzard "display option" it says 3909/3909 instead of just 3909.   
---
3909/3909 takes up way to much space.. anyone knows how to simplify it? to how perplexity has it
---
Typical horde....
---
You just could have send a mail back? 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I don't think I can agree with that. At least for priests, I'd consider Hide of the Wild to be clearly better. Archivists Cape is a decent substitute though.
---
2.3
---
Atleast you have money for the repair bills!
---
That's what all my friends keep telling me about my Boom stick. Wait for twinks. Yeah but 6/8 months from now I can't even tell you if I'll be playing or in a position in my life where I can play that often. Still haven't sold it though....
---
Animated chain necklace is better by far. It's an insane neck.
---
I’m with you. Healing is very simple as is, and the action bars have enough keybinds that you can manually have your lower ranked spells spread through out.
---
Granted, those addons allow you to have less spells on your bars, which can be aesthetically pleasing.
---
Yeah but that's only 12 keys, I need more than that, at least 15 ideally 20
---
Why can’t you just wait the 3 seconds for them to skin before jumping? If it’s such a common problem why not be the solution yourself?
---
quick better make another  /s
---
Rogue has no sustain and takes the most damage out of any class. So yeah they are very slow at grinding. Early level is quite good though due to their high DPS and spirit naturally fixing your health issues.
---
During the Reginald Windsor escort event he despawns while the guards are kneeling. Gotta hangout there and look for him on his horse. It’s hard to do while people are attuning for onyxia
---
You can just swim to the right (east) for like 30 seconds and there's a path up to Arathi.
---
Did none of you ever do [this quest?](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4433)
---
It's legit but keep in mind that you have to be on the last part of the questline. Check this [link](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-warlock-felsteed-dreadsteed-mounts) for all steps. I believe 50g is an average price for that step since it costs 250g to buy the mats (which you don't have to). You will still have to farm a lot, or spend hundreds of gold, for the previous steps of the quest.
---
How do you get hp/mana etc in middle?
---
According to the guides ye. Apparently not for orcs TIL.
---
For the life of me I can't understand posts like this.  If you're losing interest then quit playing and do something else.  I wish I could lose interest.
---
My weapons are decent, MH Ceremonial Elven Blade, OH Sacrificial Kris of the Tiger (dagger hemo spec). It’s my armor that is pretty bad. I just went to ah and replaced some low lvl 30ish items. My bracers were particularly old
---
Wait it’s the guy in it’s horse ?? But isn’t it one of them kneeling ? 
---
Also, about onyxia. When I did a quest in the agora tower, I clicked on a globe and a cinematic showed up, showing a skeleton hanging in the ceiling. Is that onyxia ?
---
As a rogue I very much recommend Tactics. It was specifically made for horde rogues which is really sick.
---
I 100% agree with your take, PvP system and BG's needed to be in from the start, the game shouldn't be doing only MC and Onyxia every week for no feasible reason for 6 months. 
---
I don't really get all those comments asking for 6+ months, this game is made if the community plays it, if everybody waits for you then you alone will remain playing and nobody would be able to enjoy, also it's been two months, if you're not 60 yet you're purposedly delaying yourself
---
doesn't exist
---
I know, that's why I said I "can't" undersand it, because it subjective.
---
I definitely did that the other day. Then my next 2 runs, someone else did something similar.
---
You can get a cheeky rez by putting yourself in combat with bear form's enrage, then imediately clicking rebirth. Still can only do it every 30 mins but it might help you.
---
I cant explain the ignore but imo having a 60 in a low level dungeon makes it so boring, it takes the whole dungeon crawler feel away to me. Lvl 60 dungeons are grinds for items, but dungeons like RFD or WC feel like one-time adventures
---
the first two will be one press, the 2h whirlwind is two presses
---
omfg YES that was so funny!
---
Go Sub.  It's not the craziest spec.  But it's a lot of fun.  Daggers with slice and dice, huge boosts to ambush and backstab.    Its swell.
---
That was a fun watch.
---
It's not a bad thing, but we have private servers to thank for this.  During vanilla classes were much more rigid about sticking to their armor types.   Since private servers attempted to emulate the vanilla experience for years and years, it allowed for more time for min-maxing to be done and redone.
---
I've had an enjoyable time leveling rogue to 60. Not really any issues, and lots of shortcuts you can take in quests due to cc and stealth options. 
---
With lockpicking you hardly need any keys to dungeons and can open all locked chests inside.
---
Easy to hide from pvp and campers. I mean you get to be frickin invisible, how cool is that?
---
Bough my first [Recipe: Transmute Undeath to Water](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13486/recipe-transmute-undeath-to-water) for 49g on AH and a second one for 99g and im now making 25g a day by just logging in to my 2 alts.
---
Yeah it must be terrible to have a couple minute break in a multi-hour Raif. Poor melee dps
---
Thank you so much, I just found him :)
---
And lvl 60 rogue near by waiting for them to enablw pvp mode
---
I’m playing on a 2015ish 15” one (or a 2017ish 13” when I travel) and it runs fine. It isn’t beautiful, graphics are set to potato, and the fans get loud, but no issues or skipping at all. Occasional graphic pixelation which is cleared by a /reload. 
---
I am raiding MC and have beaucoup addons including Discord.
---
Hey razorgore.
---
Dances with wolves or Avatar?
---
Stop being a wetty
---
What are you doing my son? - Spooking you, father
---
Congrats. How many hours played.
---
WOTLK quality itemization.
---
Itemization in classic is terrible.
---
It's not the hybrid tax, or talent trees that make classes/specs under perform. It's mostly the terrible itemization.
---
I don't necessarily agree with the entire post, but I do suspect we'll get BGs like a month before the rest of Phase 3, similar to how DM has been released a month+ before the rest of Phase 2. But we'll see.
---
TL;DR
---
Abilities that do auto attack damage + something, like for example Mortal strike, sinister strike, backstab, whirlwind, all benefit from having high hitting attacks since it's auto attack + bonus. Slow weapons hit harder(assuming same dps), thus slower weapons scale better with such abilities.
---
On patch 1.8, there was an AP normalization. You see before that, there was a extra BONUS for having a slow weapon, meaning you essentially got double benefit from having a slow weapon, making those weapons incredibly overpowered. Such is not the case in classic, but slow weapons are still better.
---
By safe spotting are you referring to the actually bannable offense of using the terrain (i.e. standing on top of the wall) to stay away from guards while they kill people, or standing in areas where guards don’t patrol but that guards would be able to reach if they did walk by and kill people. 
---
The first is bannable, the second is completely within their right and they will continue to do it until you’ve stopped coming there or get a group to kill them enough to run them off.
---
Buttholl
---
You want to tank with a 2h? A fast 2h is better rage control for aggro skills.
---
&gt;Just cause you're able to play a lot doesn't mean blizzard will speed things up.
---
Just like Dire Maul huh ;)
---
Also, I do have tons of time to play but I have IRL buddies who work 9-5 jobs, some even longer, and they’re all at least max level by now.
---
The game has been out for two months now, come on.
---
Just have him join the discord. He doesn't have to talk and you can whisper him whatever the guild needs explained. Seems pretty simple solution.
---
Why would you need to team with another guild if you're the 2nd largest on the server?
---
If a rogue is near you the risk of a kick is the least of your worries. Cheap Shot does a better job of stopping you and leaves Kick free for your next cast.
---
It is known.
---
It's hard(er) compared to other classes.  Not necessarily hard though.
---
For raids? Hpaldins and Warlocks in my experience.
---
The first one.
---
got a [response](https://i.imgur.com/AoBaSub.png)
---
Brutality mh, mirah oh, ideal combo really. 9 agi 9 strength give you 18 ap plus crit from agi, better than dalrend really
---
Thanks, I used bartender back when I'll give it a shot.
---
I think it's tough though because the valuable thing is the Devilsaur leather, less so having someone craft it. Those things tend to be camped to oblivion.
---
You’ll eventually replace mostly any gear you get no matter how long it takes. You’ll never replace the 100% mount speed. Absolutely go for a mount
---
Want to trade raid IDs? We’ve been running dry
---
It is probably the 1000th post about a hunter taming Broken Tooth in less than a month.
---
We are happy for him. It's just not an interesting or new post, it doesn't start any discussion, it doesn't have any humor. In other words, it has nothing deserving an upvote.
---
It's a bit rough, but so is the iron to mithril and mithril to thorium grind.
---
Mining is just annoying to level
---
Damage on instant attacks (ability clicks that do damage like mortal strike or sinister strike) fo damage on this formula:
---
[Weapon damage] + (AP/14) * [speed modifier]
---
The modifier used to be your weapon speed. Now it's a static number depending on weapon type. 1.7, 2.4, 3.3, or 2.8 for daggers, 1h, 2h, ranged respectively. 
---
While slow weapons arent nearly as powerful as before, they are still universally better as the damage is still based on its x-y.
---
lol. counterspelling a pala so he can't bubble or do anything really is pretty much the best way you can start a fight. always happy if a cheap pala presents himself on a platter like that.
---
Why? Its a neck. Thats better than what he has. That gives Stam and atp, which is good for tanks.
---
"Tank items" in Vanilla/Classic is straight up garbage, you'd never be allowed to tank a raid of you showed up in full plate tanking gear....
---
Yeah was talking about pve
---
What is he using for his raidframes?
---
Rebirth can be used in battle but it doesn't have to be.
---
ITS SARKOTH
---
No gathering xp in classic. Good thought though
---
For a pure leveling perspective, horde has better fp, town location, however for storytelling perspective, alliance totally blow horde out of water. 
---
If I remember, they hastely put horde zone and quest together. When alliance is based on Warcraft I,II,III lore and map.
---
Guidelime with Bustea's horde leveling guide was ace.
---
I did do 1.6 :)
---
Yeah wait till your 60 and people leave over a single wipe like its going outta fashion. I got way better groups leveling than I do at 60 because people are just zerging for a single item and if their runs arent fast af then they leave to get another group.
---
Because you're on a timer and want to jump immmediately due to the patrol and if you pull that patrol another patrol is pulled etc. and it usually results in a wipe. 
---
Anyone who skins for 10 silver at that spot is clueless. The solution is to NOT skin and risk wiping your whole group over some shit silver.
---
"I gotcha, I gotcha"
---
That's a good idea, no i don't plan to swap midfight - but that only gives 12 keys right? Ideally I need 20, at least 15
---
1. I have no idea what you're talking about
---
2. Angels exist in heaven and angles exist in degrees.
---
3. It helps if you type in complete sentences.
---
Sounds miserable but ok.
---
So your goal is to run dungeons for the rest of classic. Well have fun. The other 99.9999% of us are planning on dpsing in raids because every guild worth more than 2 cents already have their tanks ready and geared.
---
The best kind of groups
---
According to shadowpanther, it's hanzo. But they are all not great offhands
---
I was talking about PvP, that's why I wrote prePv &gt;P&lt;.
---
Did the same on my hunter. But that one is still lvl 60 on retail :)
---
It that an addon,  or a webpage?
---
Then they will be put out of their misery in time.
---
Every time someone on my server does it we start spamming general for them to be reported. Same guys been at it but i hope it helps
---
Woah woah woah a couple characters? What are we NEETs?
---
If you’re not getting 5 levels a month you’re not enjoying the *experience*.
---
Stacking spell power for 30-39 pvp is a terrible idea. You will be killed very quickly if you don't have stamina.
---
Overall casters tend to make terrible twinks if they aren't a healer type stacking stamina/int. Rogues/Hunter/Warrior all better. Most twink pvp is group combat. Warlock's will +spell power gear will just be focused down quickly.
---
thats the nice thing about having 2 or 3 accounts. Not many fuck with my 38 mage when there is a 60 lock and priest both on follow.
---

You don't get enough time after a gouge to bandage effectively.  Blind is your friend.
---
I played EU vanilla so DM release didn't bother me. Plus I didn't play pservers so I'm not rushing. 
---
I'm lucky if I get 20 hours to play in a week, and I'm doing just fine. My plan was to hit 60 by first week of November and I'm on track.
---
People have responsibilities outside of a 9-5 job. Just because they can play all the time outside of work doesn't mean everyone can.
---
This isn’t funny content at all, I hope you weren’t going for that.  I feel like you are reaching at funny in order to promote your stream.  You can definitely tell with the clickbait title, and the anime tits.

+5 Mining enchant on Gloves.
---
Problem with listening to the community in is that almost always only the vocal ones will be accounted for. Atleast thats how it goes with most games.
---
OSRS is the living example. People always jabbering about what they want, and some people take it as a given that the playerbase want it. Then devs poll it to see how much people care, and early on some came out to be incredibly controversial, and got very low support.
---
As years passed the devs got better at realizing what makes OSRS, and what direction players enjoy it to be taken, what values should be upheld. Nowadays a lot of polls pass with 90%+ support.
---
Often of course this causes disagreement, because everyone draws the line at a different place (and by different measurements), so what may be a minor QoL to some, its a severe violation of game mechanics to others. But its to be expected.
---
Most basic is probably the 'Powercreep vs Dead content' present in every game.
---
I really hope that present Classic devs will make a game what a lot of people want, that keeps in the masses as opposed to making a quick buck and living off of whales.
---
Small sidenote about listening to the community:
---
Niche classic-rooted (but amazing) MMOFPS Planetside 2 ('s devs) did a big oopsie. Some kids suggested them to jump on the BR train when Fortnite was popping off, most of the actual players knew this is a bad idea, with detailed reasons why. Stupid executives who don't know anything but money and that "Fortnite = Popular, Popular = Money, Fortnite = BR, then BR = Money and we want money so we want BR!" decided to force the company to make a half-assed BR, pouring almost all their assets into it. So Planetside Arena was born.
---
A month later the game is practically dead, with all the exact flaws the players told would plague the game, the company fired all but two Planetside 2 developers, the company is borderline bankrupt, they are (claiming to be) moving Arena devs back to Planetside 2.
---
And the players just sit there twiddling their thumbs saying "We told you.". Now we're waiting on what will happen. The game is running, prepared updates came out, the servers are cared for, its just very quiet.
---
Any current or future developers: Listen to your players, or atleast think like one. They aren't total idiots. But listen to most of them, not only the first vocal ones. Engage, poll, discuss.
---
Ya, im still level 51 tho :)
---
Unfortunately this is usually what happens
---
If it makes you feel better you can only hold 6 at a time. My buddy was pissy he couldn't get 3 years worth.
---
Sometimes I see screenshots of action bed with "S-1" or "A-1" as the hotkey. When I go into settings, I can't set a combination of keys as my hotkey- what are these hotkey buttons?
---
Got 60 without any grind. Used questie to be sure to not miss quests and did quite a few instances.
---
I saw the off hand drop once but lost it to a guildies off spec.................................... even tho tahts against teh guild looting rules. Its been a week and the guy has not even used it.
---
do dungeons? grouping up is often fun
---
Agreed. But I'm doing an alt finally to kill time. Other then not having a mount its fun. Really can't wait until 40 again and its nice having money this time around for constant green/blue AH gear and consumables. My /played is much better this time around
---
They also have to understand even full main tank need two set of gear, tanking set for boss/raid and  threats set for dungeon/farm content.
---
To each their own. A mix is probably good, but just looking through the cloth options there isn't that many great stat heavy options, most are spirit heavy. He isn't asking what kind of twink to roll, he just wants warlock gear. A the high 30's crafted shadow damage set is going to get him a lot of value.
---
Horde leater classes just do a quest around lvl 26 and get a hat with relevant stats. Alliance relies on random drops (that usually come in "of the owl" variety) until 36.
---
I agree with this. That's just the way it ended up I suppose. Anecdotally I noticed Horde seem to get better itemized rewards most of the time.
---
Shamans got no mount.
---
49. It will all still be there when we hit 60. It might even be easier to get the initial drops you want because of it!
---
^ jaded american right here
---
I’m lvl 51 rn and I frequently level togheter with other people so I guess there are still some levelers
---
I finally saw the mainhand  on my 41st run yesterday, sadly lost the roll though
---
He added your battletag to his friend list. Thst way he can whisper you cross faction.
---
Its pretty poop but no GM powers ;-)
---
Fear not,  this is only phase 1 of 5, theres plenty of time to catch up !
---
Screenshot?
---
Interesting. I was using rank 2 HT on cloth dps when I needed more than a rejuv since it's so cheap and they don't have much health anyway. Rebirth I only use when I know I have time to sit for some mana regen. Sometimes all I use is rejuv/rebirth, wait, repeat if needed. But in general healing touch is the way to go.
---
Strongly disagree. If you ain’t healing that dungeon, you have no business rolling against someone that is.
---
Just fyi in the low chance that you don’t know: that’s a scammer
---
3 mage kids, nuking all your plans.
---
The endgame will always be there. Even if you get there late people will still be raiding Mc. 
---
That being said I hsve a completed 60 toon who just needs raid gear and I’m working on an alt now who is almost 40
---
38 xD
---
Ok cool thanks for the reply :)
---
I'm level 30 and have absolutely no anxiety over missing out. It'll be there lol
---
This is mainly due to the fact they made the Alliance stuff first, then realised how behind schedule they were and started just dumping horde camps and hubs in the middle of zones.
---
Right? I rather have the money now since now I am playing. Feel free to buy it and relist it 7 months later.
---
Down ranking as a mage at this point is just a DPS loss. There's no fight in MC that should last long enough for you to go so oom that you can't recover with evocate and a mana pot.
---
Great, thanks for this. At 60, I heard it's good to keep rank 4 Healing touch as well as the max rank. Do you downrank any other healing touch spell levels?
---
I don’t think our opinions matter too terribly much tbh.  If you figure out which direction will earn Blizzard the most money, you’ll know precisely what direction our game goes.
---
Today I had a 60 warlock: “sry did not plan on wiping in brd, bye” 
---
:)
---
Btw its really easy to wipe at Bael
---
I was going to say the same thing.  We have numerous guild continously farming Ony/MC weekly.
---
Yeah, engineering is just so much fun, but I've never taken it without mining. I suppose wait till 60 when I have time and gold to power level it without the mining skill.
---
Lmao those edits prove you're pretty mad yourself. Stop obsessing over internet points.
---
Then why is it that I see every raid begging for healers and ignoring warrior?  That's really strange.
---
I HUNT ALONE.
---
Alright tyvm for your time!
---
I maintain a list of addon managers for WoW here:
---
https://github.com/ogri-la/wowman#other-addon-managers
---
The main addon hosts are Curse and wowinterface, but there is a small set on [Tukui](https://www.tukui.org/welcome.php) and Github.
---
Why can't i do that with my eng helmet ? QQ
---
I'm the only 60 in my group of friends/guildies, 4 guys in early/mid 50's as well and a lot still in their 30's and 40's.
---
Im fury now level 50 with 19% crit in berserker, was over 25% at level 47 as arms in berserker. If anything leveling up is making me more crit starved due to the way stats scale with level.
---
Yeah, something along those lines. As long as it isn't constant.
---
The blanks are really popular these days. Just wait till battle grounds drop then it will be all about the 360 no scope headshots.
---
I'm afraid I don't really agree. Don't get me wrong, it'd be a huge convenience. I'm currently playing a 0/5/46 Shaman, so I would benefit from this about as much as it is possible to. But these sort of conveniences are what make up the design of retail, and dual-spec is a fairly large stepping stone on the path to homoginization. When every shaman is both a healer and dps, there's no longer much difference between them, and the same goes for other classes and roles.
---

---
No where near endgame due to being an altaholic! Don't really have any FOMO yet. Might change when Phase 2 drops, and the ganks increase dramatically, haha.
---
Do you know if there are any enchants you can only do on yourself (i.e. not on other people?)
---
Died shitloads of times today in Barrens due to that exact same reason. It happened so many times that  I asked myself the very same question you asked. 
---
Like I don’t believe in it, but I can’t not stop thinking that there are some hidden mechanics in the game that does this.
---
Now try and see if you can beat my 15 year streak ;) 
---
/s
---
The lack of this in other MMOs I have tried is why I wasn’t playing one before classic released.
---
You didn't even mention how mind-bogglingly horde favored the leveling instances are, both from quests and location standpoints.  But hey, once you get to endgame it turns on its head and Ironforge is the center of the world so there you have it.
---
[r/frenworld](https://www.reddit.com/r/frenworld)
---
O wait lol
---
Known it is!
---
Disagree. Horde has a better time moving around with their fps/zeps for sure, and might generally have more quests, but I wouldn't say it's vastly superior. Also you should definitely quest in dustwallow/swamp of sorrows as alliance, you just need to do it in the right order and get the right quests (and prerequesites). There are a lot of quests for hillsbrad/alterac, just not as obvious as the horde ones. Basically you might need to zone hop more as alliance, but you should never run out of quests.
---
&gt;cuz some are "special"
---
99% of them, actually. And BRD really shows it, cause all pulls are like 8 enemies  (aka a little bit too many for a non-pala tank to hold threat on)
---
Maybe change your title to “Minimum wage customer service representatives who couldn’t give a toss about your game just make shit up or repeat what their equally bored colleague told them because they’re sick of ungrateful neck beards giving them shit all day and just want to go home.”
---
Dustwallow Marsh is not worth visiting for leveling Horde. There are maybe two or three quests that are okay to do. The only reason to even bother with visiting Dustwallow Marsh at all is to get the higher level First Aid skill and recipes. If it weren't for that, I'd probably never visit Dustwallow. Well, maybe for that Shimmering Flats quest and to finish a ZF quest, but there's no reason to spend any time in Dustwallow as Horde.
---
It had a huge upgrade in BC where many quests were added and it became a viable alternative, in Classicc it's a pointless zone.
---
It\`s useful info. Other hunters know when he spawned and are able to predict his next time more or less.
---
This is incorrect. See the other posts in this thread explaining how normalization works. The tldr is that slower is still better but not as much as before normalization.
---
Barrens was the only reason I rolled horde. Idgaf what people say, barrens is the top #1 leveling zone with clear and interesting quest progression, nice atmosphere and of course the chat. If you know the basic questing route and where to get and do quests, it’s fantastic.
---
Sure alliance has more of those quests that deal with important lore happenings and tie your character to the surrounding world, I give them that. BUT when you are leveling, you are trash in the eyes of lore. You are insignificant adventurer trying to get by, and Barrens is the perfect example of being treated like shit. That is the true Classic Experience™️
---
You should be getting close to getting thrash blade (you can just pay a hunter to get you the ring and thrash, should be pretty cheap now that it's second bis.)
---
Also hemo dags isn't really a spec lmao
---
Whats another lost bag slot to us soul shard hoarders? :[

You mean regrowth? Rebirth is your combat ress
---
You are totally missing what’s cool about this example. 
---
We are not celebrating bad gameplay we are celebrating how they handled a group that wasn’t working well together. 
---
If loot is the only thing you care about and how to most effectively get it you are missing out on so much more that MMOs have to offer.
---
You seem like a salty ESL boomer. Provide a source or stop talking.
---
Blasted lands? WPL?
---
If there is a bias, it’s hard to notice. Several of those zones are skipped over completely for people during leveling, even without dungeon spam. I didn’t remember horde could quest in Dustwallow until I got the flight path for Onyxia.
---
Well 1 those ass wholes tend to be higher level. 2 getting a group as an alliance  player on my server is near impossible. 3 this is just easier.
---
lvl 40, and I started to play at launch week o.0. I know the game, I just dont have time to level up quickly. I have school and work at the same time, so if im lucky I can squeeze in 1-3h every night. If I have assigned school work then none. Pretty much skipped all october, until this week.
---
Dont care really, my level zones are nice and quiet now. Cant imagine how STV was a month ago (heard no mobs to kill, if lucky enough you were able to find a mob, only to be encountered by opposite faction etc). Ill hit lvl 60 eventually, and dont give a shit if everyone has BIS gear by then. Its not like TBC is gonna be released any time soon.
---
U must be horde.
---
Epic mount makes everything easier. Including grind for robe.  Go for mount, it\`s a huge QoL upgrade.
---
&gt;Angels exist 
---
No :)
---
No it can't, but I wish it could.
---
Yeah when you go set up your keybinds you click it with your mouse, you hold shift then press 1 or 2. Now that hotbar slot activates when you hit "shift+1" I use that slot for my rogues kick for example. All my cooldowns are set to "ctrl+1-5".
---
I don't see how you could value 4 mp5 higher than 9 healing, 10 int, 8 stam. But I guess it depends on what the rest of your items look like. If you are really lacking in mp5.. I guess?
---
Who the hell grades a class/role on their “getting a raid spot potential”? That such a nebulous concept, and crazily dependent on too many factors to ever be a consideration. You grade them based on their performance, which warrior is a top tier class.
---
Msbt shows every proc. Trash blade procs - hoj procs - sword spec procs. I had to adjust few things but its pretty neat.
---
Can you explain your action bar setup? I’m a priest, not 60 yet, but are you primarily healing? Or Dps
---
Felwood is viable, but the geography makes it kind of a pain. There's one quest hub at the far south with no vendors or flight path, and one at the far north that has those things. Moreover, most of the quests will originate in the south, and have objectives in the north, which means a 5-10 minute round trip traveling time. A bunch of times, because they only give you a few quests at a time. Also, I had a lot of trouble with rep (furbolgs) and cloth (satyr) farmers killing all the quest mobs. I'd go and do some of the early quests in the south, but bail if/when it starts to get painful.
---
51 is too low for a solo warrior in WPL. I went there around 55 and had a pretty rough time of it. There's one easy quest killing level 50 undead, but after that you have to go into Andorhal and the cauldron fields, with higher level mobs and higher density.
---
Un'goro is good, as are any higher-level quests left over from the 40-50 zones. You can also start the Burning Steppes.
---
Honestly, I haven't had a lot of luck just sticking to one zone for more than a level or two. You pretty much have to hit all the zones if you're not running a bunch of dungeons for supplementary experience.
---
wow! this is news to me. It happened five years ago, but here is the relevant links for anybody who follows: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2jhlzv
---
really unethical.
---
There's this thing called don't infer a bunch of shit that is not even implied either.
---
What is that UI add-on on the top?
---
And you should quit breathing.
---
Spellcleave is like 30+ you can do it earlier in like rfk but almost no one runs that because everyone doesnt have the proper kit yet and questing is probably faster.
---
Block is huge for mages.
---
Graveyard is lvl 30+, library is 33+ or so.
---
Between 30 and 40 the game will start throwing gold at you. By level 40 you should be most of the way to 100g by just leveling and selling quest rewards. Continue to avoid spending on unnecessary things and make sure you install an add-on that will let you decide which useless green has the highest vendor value.
---
rag neck is for caster dps, so unless a priest is shadow he won't get it.
---
i'll keep that in mind
---
He just kept coming back, a guard would spawn and run out of the kitchen, smack him down, and he'd just come back. He was very dedicated.
---
Yes, besides Blackrock Mountain, pretty much all instances are located more conveniently for the Horde. This includes raids like ZG, Onyxia, Naxx and AQ. And it goes beyond just that, Horde has overall a better coverage of both continents than Alliance, with the exceptions of Blackrock area.
---
Of course not
---
It depends what you mean by best. If you're in need for a healer, you won't pick a mage...
---
BRD is hard. you always wipe at least once there if you\`re trying to do a full run.
---
I even had her in the shower
---
Yes
---
I found rogue easy to level but I am a God at that class and wow in general being the best rogue on server it was a cake walk
---
It builds up a part of your identity and your niche. And that matters. As a heal spec'd character, I'm more inclined to group with people and form friendships because my solo efficiency isn't as good as a DPS build would be. Would dual-spec be more convenient for me? Absolutely! But it also means that I would interact less with other players as a result of being more self-sufficient.
---
Tamed her 5mins after I dinged 37, been with me ever since. Gratz dude!
---
Sorry bud. Better start an alt. Most ppl are just nearing 50-60 now you have a few weeks before everyone catches up
---
 Your own dam fault for no lifing the game in a month
---
Two days ago both dal rends dropped after farming them forever. I won em both :D
---
Haha that’s the worst.
---
Alright cool
---
You dont derank frostbolts unless its a rank 1, and even then its used to apply slow not for damage.
---
You shouldnt go oom on boss fights. U got 2 mana crysals, evocation and you can get runes and mana pots on top of that.
---
Even with no int gear you won't go oom unless everyone in your raid is tabbed out and auto hitting.
---
Fair enough. 😊
---
Right? Do the centaur heads in conjunction with the pools quests!
---
and you would only find prot tanks that have way too much mitigation and thus don't get enough rage to build threat and hold aggro.
---
That's not the place to post this kind of information. Imagine if every server posted its rare spawns everytime...
---
That's not the purpose of this subreddit to be flooded by that. Go to or create a server-specific sub / classic hunter-specefifi sub.
---
I'd appreciate that :)
---
Disagree with Ashenvale , but you are spot on with all the others.   I didn't even realize it was so good for Horde, since the last time I played horde before classic was in 2007.  I did alliance on pservers in the past years and just got used to it I guess.
---
Decent write-up. I just want to point out that 1k needles and stone talon shouldn't really be on here as alliance have duskwood/wetlands. It would be like saying the alliance have a bias for no horde quests in those zones; both sides have contested zones that heavily favor one side. Also the Hinterlands quests were added later after launch because the horde had basically nothing there.
---
*remembers Two-Socks being shot*
---
I'm not crying you are

Titan panel
---
I would assume that if a BoE dropped for a solo player, it would remain BoE. It'd only be the act of rolling need that bound it.
---
Lol what? The kill quest line without any reason but to hunt is, like, four stages long. Even then hunting is the theme. All the quests had a reason behind it. Not even figuratively is Barrens like that.
---
Barber
---
Nah, just felt like it would be easier to use an already established definition. You have yet to provide any "data" besides one player who leveled a Horde char and an Alliance char. You have zero evidence for your argument. The ad hominem is even more telling of this.
---
I always play alliance however because the zones are so much nicer. Everything is so drab and kinda crappy in horde zones. The only Horde zone I miss when playing alliance is The Barrens.
---
Boobs
---
Is it the move with shields? You shouldn't be too bad but maybe just slot in a couple more hit %? I duel wield fine in tank gear with 6-8% hit and would understand your issue with higher lvl mobs but if lower level trash it's very odd
---
Check if it helps to deactivate XP bar or reputation bar in the bartender settings
---
Sfk is a walk in the park.  SM is a short run from Hillsbrad.  To get to Gnomeregan, you have to travel through Arathi, then the wetlands, then past the major gathering capital city.  UC is not really as busy or as crowded outside the gates.
---
The Horde are just the superior faction.  It is known.
---
Horde have better access to SM. Alliance have way, way better cities and starting zones. The Barrens is legendary, tho. Kalimdor overall just way favors The Horde, no doubt.
---
Haha yes, but the mages are in full force trying to swap it back
---
Thanks friends- makes sense. Guess I never tried the shift / alt / Ctrl modifiers lol. This really opens up my hotbar options now
---
The sound is from thrash blade, not sword spec
---
"You wanna be a big hunter, huh? HUH? Ok, kill 30 of every single kind of enemy in this absurdly long area."
---
"You are now a big hunter. Go visit Camp Taurajo, they must have more for you to do."
---
*one 5 minute long trek down to Taurajo later*
---
"You wanna be a big hunter, huh?"
---
Yeah, that sounds about right. Without the Int, I'd pick the archivist cape.
---
I think your assumption that you even want to use heroic strike is faulty. Rather you want to use instant attacks like whirlwind and mortal strike which simply deal more damage per rage with a slower weapon.
---
Secondly faster weapons don't generate more rage per se. A 1.2 attack speed dagger will generate about 1/3 of the rage as a 3.6 speed sword. So it evens out with the dagger being a bit quicker to start and less spikey in rage generation.
---
They can teleport to Gnomer??? That’s bullshit what the fuck. There should be an equivalent to SM for them where they have to run through one of our zones getting wrecked by high levels who are literally just waiting for low levels headed to the dungeon.
---
Karma will find a way to repay you. Your evil just fuels my drive to murder every horde I see regardless of level or what they're doing. Everyone in your faction will suffer for your crimes. See you on the battlefield.
---
They are correct, just ironically identical heh.
---
Sad the title doesn't lead to a funny video related to it somehow.
---
That said I play Ashbringer as a Canadian and it's smooth as butter. Was hoping for some lag shenanigans.
---
In raid, single mob threats is currently not a problem for full prot since the DPS gear is still not at place where it outscale warrior basic sunder+6s shield slam yet.
---
It is in dungeons where priest mind blast and warlock soul burn have been a constant pain for tank.
---
Great series.  Cathedral has easier trash (lots of casters, easy interrupt!) but the end boss encounter won't be easy.  Nice gameplay too- you could do a "dungeon strategy for dummies" to illustrate several different things you guys do to maximize the capability of your classes doing relevant 5-man content with only a group of 2
---
Although, having literally the best combo of 2 classes in the game definitely helps!  Enh shaman + 2h warrior is great
---
yes but that didn't stop them from world first raggy and ony. they're just gamers. tho really I wouldn't be surprised to see progress, dreamscape, or salad bakers pull it off either
---
We had two high level mages and an under-leveled tank, we switched from normal tank n' spank to earthbinds, slows and kiting. Most wipes resulted from not knowing the map and running into large grps while not targetting the right mobs. I think the reason we carried on for so long was that we were slowly figuring things out.
---
Something is going horribly wrong if Arm is taking 38+ minutes
---
Maybe that and also the fact that there are fewer servers ?
---
At least for the french region we only have 4 servers in total, 3 of them are always layered, the last one is layered during peak hours...
---
Just do the wall strat. It is so easy. Never wiped there.
---
No, only the one that turns you into a skeleton does that AFAIK.
---
But you're wasting your time if you try to do this quest just for underwater breathing. Noggenfogger Elixir in Tanaris is much easier to acquire and gives you a high chance to turn into a smaller skeleton which also gives the same effect for 10 minutes.
---
You're forgetting about the true reason to visit Dustwallow: basking in the glory and techniques of Nat Pagle.
---
Yea your kind and my kind don’t mix well sometimes 😀
---
Unsure whether to level my Mage or Lock for the upcoming PvP phase. Looking for an simple spec for mostly solo bg's. Mage seems to have way less keybinds and no pet, but SL lock probably can get away with just dots, fear and life drain according to people?
---
Nethergarde keep has literally zero quests. Alliance doesn't even have a flight point in Swamp Of Sorrows or Badlands, that's how bad it is.
---
Dude, you're going on a massive mistake here.
---
You're talking about lvl 60 maxed out hit chance in mind, while I explicitly talk ONLY about lvling, especially 1-40.
---
Will report back
---
You can do basically everything in conjuction with anything, people complain that Barrens is alot of running - which is true - but it’s very logical. Do this bunch of quests here, then run there and do those quests, run to xroads, start over. Levels just keep on coming
---
Yeah, that sounds very plausible.  And in the end they ran out of time to balance it again, hence the many Alliance hubs that feel unfinished or are just forgotten.
---
If we ever get Classic+  they can start with just making the many secondary towns like Nethergarde Keep more lively.  That place is stupid, it's basically 2 big castles and a few other buildings with only 2 npc that do anything, the rest are mindless guards.
---
I mean we’re a little evil
---
No struggle here (if we are talking about the ugly hat), go to the menu &gt; interface &gt; Display &gt; untick "Show Helm". 
---
Voila
---
Never saw this once gathering my entire pre-raid BiS. In fact the only group that disbanded was the one I left after our second wipe because the lvl 58 tank didnt understand what LoS pulling is and just charged everywhere.

All my friends have quit. I'm bored and alone. I have characters on Anathema (28 Tauren Warrior, 31 Orc hunter) and Pagel (30 Dwarf warrior). 
---
I am willing to reroll on your server and into your faction. I'm an experienced tank but I'm willing to flex into a DPS position based on your needs (Healing is not on the table).
---
If all this sounds like a fit for your group, feel free to message me here or contact me on Battlenet (moosemonger#1345).
---
Thanks for your consideration. 
---
\- **PF5K-**
---
As it has been mentioned, I agree that the Horde have a significant advantage in terms of actual leveling and location of camps. BUT I find the Alliance storyline is by far the most interesting.
---
I generally have three, rank 4 (most efficient), rank 7 and max rank.  Max rank isn't used often but it has it's place.  Often I can spam rank four a little bit after a fight has started and then catch a few 5 second rule ticks here and there.  
---
On a pserver I used rank 2 a lot (1.5 sec cast with talents) and I had a mix of t2 epics/offpieces.  I could basically do these level of healing FOREVER because the mana cost basically matched my passive mana regen between 15% while casting + the mana/5 on my gear.  So I had it on my hotbar for emergencies if I was totally OOM I could spam it for ever for about 250-300 hp healed plus more obviously when it crits, spamming it as its a 1.5 sec cast.  Only costs 55 mana base, plus that is a little bit less with resto talents more like high 40s mana cost.  Not too hard to get close to 100 mana/5 between gear and the spirit-based mana regen!
---
And this is how things should go instead of reading all the guides and expecting everyone in group to have done so as well
---
Also, a bunch of class quests are in horde zones like the warlock succubus, warrior berserker stance, and pally verigan's fist.
---
It wasn't fun running through swamp of sorrows at level 30 being killed by horde players and level 35+ monsters when a horde warrior would just hop on a bat to take him to ratchet and stroll over to fray island 5 min away.
---
If you have just one person who has been there before and can lead and you are not underleveled its easy.
---
Ironfoe in less than 10 runs at 58. Only melee in the group

thanks for the info, how is the population and what would you say the ratio is? ive also heard its a different country other than the us server is that true?

People coming up with ways to fuck with people makes the game fun, i know it sounds bad haha but it brings a lot of humour (when its not happening to you of course).

Like when i first read about a hunter naming a scorpion sarkoth and planting him in the orc starting zone, god I had tears of laughter haha. That stuff makes games like so unique

We have to take it as SLOOOOOOW as possible.  You will thank me in 2 years and we will still having fun with 'new'  content.  If we rush everything it's gone next year.
---
Rerolled horde on classic and I agree. They're just so many points when I was leveling my alliance that I thought 'wow horde have it nice'.
---
Just some examples off the top of my head:
---
* Scarlet Monastery is one of the best ways to level all the way from 30-44. You get a ton of good gear that will last you for many levels. SM is handed to horde on a silver platter, meanwhile alliance have to foot it through high level zones and horde territory, often dying a bunch. Then on a PvP server they will get killed whenever they walk outside of the dungeon.
---
* The zeppelin system is way better than the alliance 'equivalent' which is just the menethil/theramore boat and deeprum tram, the latter which becomes useless once you get IF/SW flight path.

* Towns. Horde towns simply feel much more safe than the alliance ones. Take Ashenvale for instance. Horde have a walled city with tons of guards (you can't even get inside without aggroing 4 guards). The alliance town Astraanar is surrounded by a tiny stream with no walls. The most obvious example is again in Arathi Highlands. Horde have Hammerfall which is a walled town with tons of lvl 55 guards, while alliance have Refuge Pointe which is essentially a ditch surrounded by lvl \~40 guards with no inn or mailbox.
---
I just think your wording was hyperbolic when saying the ONLY reason a hunter is brought to a raid is for tranq. Its just not true, their damage is ok, not top of the board, which I never claimed. To a noob, your original comment is certainly misleading but I can see your point that tranq and trueshot is the primary reason to bring a hunter over a warrior. But let's not make it sound like they are useless beyond those two abilities.
---
I disagree. The Barrens is about establishing a stronger presence in Kalimdor by eliminating threats from all sides. You have the centaur, the quillboar, and the harpies, all three of which are civilizations native to Kalimdor who don't take very kindly to this. In the middle of that you also deal with more agents of the Burning Blade, you deal with the Venture Company for the first time, you run into what you eventually learn are the Silithid for the first time, and you also deal with Theramore agents in Northwatch Hold.
---
Oh, and I suppose you hunt some animals too.
---
No it is not expected. It is the least you can do if you planning to roll on a spec you aren't playing.
---
Have fun getting counterspelled when you summon your mounts!
---
No the entire addon with those abilities to far right
---
Yeah most servers are already horde dominant, add blood elves and it just gets worse.
---
&gt;\&gt;SM is a short run from Hillsbrad
---
lol
---
Oh ty
---
yes it was pretty tough\^\^
---
Its not really, I view it as the WOW circle of life. You get ganked all the way up to 60 and then it is your turn to take it out on the lowbies. But i have to admit, I do it very sparingly, brief patches now and then.   
---
But exterminating lowbies needs to be done, lowbies are a vermin if you didnt know?

Tanks want ony neck, not trinket.
---
Why is this kitty so sought after. What makes him better than the others.
---
Wailing Caverns story line? The Kolkar centaurs??? It is fine. The gather quests are fine, and you should be completing them as you complete the other quests.
---
Thanks. Guess I was hoping for a few more. Oh well, guess I'll just wait for a good price on Glowing Brightwood Staff as I could never get Trindlehaven Staff after getting everything else I needed, even the gems lol.
---
what class are you playing? 
---
for example. i play a rogue and my playstyle is different, depending on which class i am up to. i cant burst down warriors, like i do with clothies and i cant fight against a hunter, as i do against warriors. also if you arent in a pvp specc, or pvp favored specc shit can be pretty harsh against players that are.
---
His positioning is the worst. You'd think he would learn.
---
I don't see how his nationality is relevant. He's just not very good.
---
Smelting
---
All I can say is fuck immersion when I have to be walking through hell that is STV on a PvP server just because I'm close to 40 and there are quests fot me to pick up and turn in on the complete opposite sides of the map.
---
As Horde you can do Nesingwary's quests and all the troll quests near your main hub with a flighpoint and a zeppelin to two major cities. Then just hop on the flightpath to Booty Bay and do the quests there. When you need to go back to northern STV just hop on the flightpath back.
---
As alliance you need to walk the whole zone quite a few times up and down. The nearest fp is in Duskwood which takes longer to fly and walk back to the camp than just walking through whole of STV and hoping you don't get ganked.
---
Add to that the walks from Soutshore to Scarlet Monastery and the bottom line is that at least from 30-45 Horde has a far superior time leveling than Alliance.
---
Agreed. Classic+ would eventually just become more and more like retail. TBC is the way to go , IMO.
---
“BRIDGE’S HAUNTED”
---
So old census data needs to be thrown out the window but your anecdotal evidence is sufficient
---
Go ahead and try to pull and kill 8 on the rogue.
---
Where is the alliance town in feralas?
---
You have to remember you're in a group and can't just play like you do while outside of the dungeon. Thats the issue. Warrior tanks play differently while in a group then outside of one not so much for dps. I recommend all tanks and dps to play their respective classes. If a dps is thinking about the group and are actually managing their threat they can be really useful to the group.
---
Your spec depends 100% on what weapons you have. You will mostly stay swords till you start getting daggers from MC(3 out of the 4 melee weapons from MC are daggers).
---
No Changes
---
Pagle Kreygasm
---
Viskag has a 5% drop chance and their will be 7-10ish people rolling on it in every raid
---
Worst attempt at making a funny video, or worst positioning?
---
Another one. The best answer I read is that your epic mount will always be there and like 1/5 of your time in wow is travelling so to further cut that down the better. Where as gear changes with phases so say you buy a bis now maybe in 6 months it's no longer bis but your still flying around on that epic mount.
---
Lol, nah. There is a path on the side he jumped off. Nbd really.
---
She sure is
---
twice yesterday i asked to join someone shouting LFM in /4, both times (over about 1hr30m) after being ignored i asked why and both times i got the same response. 
---
it's not like they just let me know that, i had to ask them why.
---
How much did you need? I can't imagine that being more time efficient than just farming gold unless you needed like 3g or less.
---
He was not afk, I feared him. I died, and he laughed and went back.
---
It actually is. Every single warrior tanking a dungeon would of rolled on that neck. If it was an upgrade for them. And all warriors are tanks. Even dps spec'd. And most warriors tanking dungeons are dps spec'd.
---
I know, that's why i said it.
---
I've never leveled a Horse character, what is considered to be the most enjoyable race to level for Horde?
---
Yea but then you have your Onyxia attunement and we have ours. Let’s call it even.
---
Quality of weapons aside, what about specs itself?
---
He means without the teleporter.
---
Just no.
---
???? What a prick. You went back to this guys post 66 days ago because he said something on Reddit that made you mad?
---
How do you make cinnamon rolls... I'm still at sweet rolls at 60
---
Healing, I see healbot there.  Most of his heals are casted by a specific click on another players name in healbot.
---
Ekzdeh
---
The problem with Ashenvale is that the quests send you there at roughly 20 for Alliance. Every horde player questing in the first part of the zone for alliance are in their high 20s. That's a huge advantage on a PVP server.
---
Lucky fuck
---
Potentially, yes it could drop again. But as people have said it is literally one of the rarest items in game. Saving it for now and selling it for much more when there is an actual demand for it is more worthwhile than trying to make a quick 100g. Some people would just prefer to play it safe than risk losing out on money.
---
 The macro you typed out will work, just make a “STOP CASTING” macro and put it on a bar
---
BRD can be super painful.
---
Daggers are fun and cool to play in pve and pcp, but your dps will suffer in comparison to swords until you get good gear in pve.
---
Of course I will, but that is a pretty massive difference in translation.
---
Also 1-40 you are still wrong.
---
Have you tried using Moonlight Streaming? I always get better results with it than Steam Link.
---
How do I bind alt+1 and hotswitch it? Where do i put that ability if action bar only has 12?
---
I've finally completed my Pre-Raid Set (apart from the Random Roll Stat items or all the Best Green items) and have a good Farming Set for ZF, so now I'm just getting Gold to go Engineering and get my Epic Mount. I haven't started Raids mainly because the amount of Gold you need for Pots and Re-Spec Cost being the most annoying.
---
I was MC horde into the lava pits in searing gorge last night lmaoo. I wouldn't if so many 60's would just leave me alone to quests haha
---
And this is why i just ended up getting so god damn sick of that area. Barrens is such a cool little area and has a funny chat and WC is a great dungeon. I just cannot get over the spots where the level disparity is just so high. I cant stand the hunts and the grind, especially as a warrior that is doing 2 handed, its just been an uphill battle from the start.
---
I tried to suggest this to my friend group, was chastised for the idea. Now we have a spread from 37, 44, 57, and four at 60. Barely played together leveling and now half still can’t do dungeons together. Really sucks the fun out of a multiplayer online game when you have to play solo because some felt the need to hard grind to endgame of a game that is a remake anyway.
---
Go resto then you will not have problems getting loot
---
Love kill quests while leveling though.
---
I leveled faster as horde but had way more fun as alliance
---
I mean, naxx is the same for both factions, considering you port from Light's Hope once you get the attunement iirc
---
Yes, most casters level tailoring to max, then drop once they get BoP robe and take up engineering
---
Nope it's not, it's 100% correct.
---
Level up an alt while you can.
---
19 twink rogue hell yeah! So excited for twinking to start. Of course I gotta get to 60 still
---
Bruh, I spent hours raising my herbalism in duskwood as an orc rogue. Do you have any idea how much fun I ruined while farming briarthorn? I think my favorite thing to do is to one shot casters in darkshire, then vanishing and sprinting away 
---
I'm the best at being the worst
---
They’re not overpriced, they’re correctly priced.
---
Hmm is that Mike's? Did you get it off the twitch app?
---
That's true, I remember Kevin Jordan talking about how they did that on purpose in order to make more options and have the really good stuff feel that much better. Mentioned that when people were learning the game and exploring, any new weapon is going to be fun to obtain. It wasn't until years later when people began to be almost disappointed with getting the other item - solely because now people were used to being aware of the entire gambit of items. By then TBC was on the horizon, and is one of the reasons why they decided to retool all the gear optimizations.
---
The neck was not reserved, Gonagas told the leader to kick me since its a higher chance of him getting his pre-bis when theres no competition
---
Horde favouritism is not just a meme.
---
You want hardmode wow you play alliance, you wanna zoom around with your death metal cosplaying zerg you roll horde.
---
[WOO WOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQmDUEv939A)
---
How much do they sell for? 6 orbs should be a shit ton of gold. I haven't sold an orb for less than 37g.
---
I don't think undead is worse than gnome.
---
Its expected warriors tanking dungeons are going to roll on dps gear. 95% of warriors tanking dungeons are dps spec'd and dps outside of dungeons.
---
Tellmewhen is an addon ive used before but i currently use weakauras. Hope this helps
---
Arcane power is huge, especially when fights are as short as the MC fights.
---
And then there's one less tank on the server willing to group with you. That's all you're accomplishing.
---
thats true for every warrior, it just takes longer in prot spec.
---
So, as someone who is experiencing vanilla for the first time, without the help of questie, because it seems redundant to me, what would you guys suggest as an alliance leveling route?
---
I just hit 40 on my warrior and I went elywnn &gt; westfall &gt; redridge &gt; duskwood &gt; hillsbrad &gt; arathi/STV and now I'm kinda wrapping up what quests I still have in stv and arathi. I want to hit up western and eastern plaguelands, but I'm not sure what areas to level in prior.
---
Hard to say without knowing your level. Personally I would go to Thousand Needles before STV or Arathi, but they're all good choices.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
"Illidan isnt prepared yet." Laughed at this not going to lie.

Thats on you if you don't get it.
---
It’s how you get those sweet, sweet Triprunner Dungarees
---
...You didn't give any calculation you gave a hypothetical where attacks miss with one and pretend like that proves your point...which over an extended period of time your weapon speed is irrelevant to attacks hitting and missing.
---
You take 1000 swings with a fast weapon, you end up with the same amount of dodges/misses/parries as if you take 1000 swings with a slow weapon.
---
With equal dps weapons attacking over 1000 seconds, you will deal identical auto attack damage with a fast and a slow weapon. You will generate almost identical rage with a fast and a slow weapon.
---
So if auto attacks are a wash between fast and slow weapons then the question is what you do outside of the auto attacks. Literally EVERYTHING else is in the favor of slow 2h weapons with everything else being equal.
---
It turns out there are LOTS of good slow weapons while leveling, so you should never find yourself with a fast 2h.
---
&gt;	if you’re not 60 yet you’re purposedly delaying yourself
---
Or we work a full-time job and have other more important obligations that come first... 
---
Seriously, what a stupid comment.
---
Learn about what dungeon tanks really are. Hint: they're not real tanks.
---
If you want a tank, you better be prepared for him to roll on DD gear, because that's whats gonna happen. Period.
---
Fully agreed, though there are some less than ideal things about TBC, I adore all the class synergies and how all classes have at least a couple really powerful spec choices. And tradeskills.. so much better than Vanilla they're almost too good!
---
This comment reminds me of the good old days when I thought bind on equip meant I could never take it off.
---
I mean if they are 100 percent exclusive then they shouldn't be included. They aren't contested zones that horde need. His point is in the zones that both factions quest in, the horde usually ends up with towns and hubs in them while Alliance gets a quest giver or two in the middle of nowhere like STV, Swamp, Dustwallow, Arathi Highlands (no inn), etc.  Nevermind that the Horde has way more efficient major travel hubs connected to their main cities.
---
Questie will do nothing for you in this situation lol
---
whatever you pick you'll end up in Barrens anyway.
---
It's one of the enhanced character stats addon

You can make a weakaura to detect and display certain effects on your target

---
Sign me up, when is the next singles night in Goldsire Inn
---
This was the best explanation I’ve read
---
Everything...
---
Hahahaha. Better get used to reality, guy. Tanks roll on tank gear and on damage gear. That's how it always was and always will be, because otherwise, you don't have any warriors willing to tank.
---
Yeah, sure, we tanks can easily get whatever we want. By carrying dumbass damage dealers thorugh the dungeon again and again and again, until, one lucky day, no special, important damage dealer wants it. Sure. That's gonna happen. We deal with idiots and assholes, we have the most stressful role in a dungeon, and you're telling me we'll get what we want someday, after we've dealt with dozens of groups full of people too dumb to tie their damn shoelaces.
---
Nah, anyone can write letters, but to declare love on barrens chat shows its immortal
---
I don't quite understand why Blizzard decided to add Doctor Weavil and the elite naga into Classic from the start, even though in vanilla they weren't added until AQ and we're very far away from AQ becoming available. It would've been cool if they put Varian in and left him there until AQ is released. Oh well!
---
ya what the other guy said - reason being is that your sinister strikes can proc sword spec talent proc which will reset your swing timer
---
If Classic is doing better than Retail on number of players, then Blizzard will be strongly motivated to make an expansion for Retail that is influenced by the play style of Classic. 
---
That could get more players into Retail where they have micro-transactions and get more players to buy the expansion. If the next expansion was going to be more like Classic, a lot of subscribers who aren’t playing Retail now would give it a try. 
---
The executives do work for the shareholders, not the gamers. But making an expansion that players enjoy and draws more subscribers back is a good way to do that. I really think they might learn from the success of releasing Classic and seeing how many additional subs they got. There are a lot of players who were not subbed for Retail and only came back for Classic. It would be kind of crazy not to learn anything from that.
---
Wetlands, RR, and Duskwood are contested and I think there's 3 quests there among those zones combined for Horde. That's 3 whole zones you don't need to share, might as well just be Ally Territory.
---
Thanks legend. Quick qn tho, what do you mean by "almost all of them apply debuffs and thus can't be used in raid"? Can you please elaborate?
---
Grid + Clique is the best.
---
This, as I plan to give up Enchanting for Engineering. Any idea how much it would cost to get from 1-300 Engineering with Mithril at 3g a stack and Thorium at 10g a stack?
---
Also what alt would you recommend for Mining and Herbalism, I'm guessing an Rogue due to Stealth?
---
thanks for clarification. I am just using the WeaponSwingTimer and disabled the OH, so it should all be set normally.
---
Then I will hit sinister strike after the bar completely filled from now on. (yay I did it wrong all the time!)
---
The key is to do 1/3 and then so some STP and then a lil Ashenvale and the another 1/3 of Barrens as you pass through. Some zones have intro, medium, and finishing quest phases - best to not even pickup the orange/red quests on first pass through.
---
I got HoJ on my first Angerforge/Arena run. Maybe killed Angerforge 2-3 times before that on different runs?
---
Under city is right next to wpl :/
---
It’s not really confusing. If needing it binds it to you, you will only need the BOE if you are going to use it. If you want to sell it, you will have to roll greed. This ensures that BOEs go to those who would use them right away before they went to those who want to sell it.
---
Yeah, my thoughts exactly. TBC is not perfect, but it has the least amount of things I dislike. 
---
Vanilla has too much gameplay flaws (boring raiding, unbalanced specs, lack of high level quests on start) while WotLK absolutely killed the unique feeling of classes, introduced LFG, heirlooms and overall is responsible for the direction game took and still is at. Honestly Cata introduced less bad things than WotLK did.
---
Imagine enjoying plsying the game and collecting gear. Idiots!
---
I figured it was a zone to Zone thing,
---
Won’t happen cause you blocked channel invites
---
Used to be slow weapons did more damage with attacks like Mortal Strike, because they were based on weapon damage. In patch 1.8 these attacks were "normalized", which in practice means that they treat every two-handed weapon as 3.3 speed, every one-handed weapon as 2.4 speed, and every dagger as 1.7 speed.
---
People have posted the formula elsewhere in this thread, but let me give you this handy rule of thumb: **the damage difference with instant attacks between any two weapons is the same as the damage difference in the damage reported on their tooltip**.
---
For instance, Whirlwind Sword deals 82-124 damage and Whirlwind Axe deals 102-154 damage. Whirlwind Axe will therefore deal *at most* 30 more damage with Mortal Strike than Whirlwind Sword will, and on average 25 more damage. If that sounds like a low number, that's because it is. 30 damage out of a 300+ damage Mortal Strike is not much, and while in this specific instance the Axe is typically better, *most of the time* just picking the higher DPS weapon is the better choice.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
PS: since you're a rogue, don't fall for the Barman Shanker meme. It's a terrible weapon post-normalization.
---
I feel like once I’m well geared with plus healing gear I can still put out good healing and switch to disc and power infuse my strongest mage to clear raids faster. It’s also for pvp tho. getting a second set of gear with INT and STAM over spirit and mp5 for a larger health and mana pool and being able to do some damage when I don’t need to heal.
---
Yes, so with what you suggest, if I have Moonlight on F, how do I quickly switch F to become Healing Touch?
---
I have reported them for two weeks now.
---
This was me in high school
---
And it worked
---
If your one of the dumbasses that think playing one. High pop server is the way to go. Phase 2 is going to suck for you. Your going to pray for phase 3.
---
Probably Tanaris/Badlands
---
So rare there’s already another on his server... and I’m trying to save them and him money by saying waiting for something that’s not guaranteed is less valuable when you can sell it now and make money from flipping
---
Tram is much more efficient than taking the fp between IF and SW. It is faster and obviously free (even though the cost is minimal). Less scenic though
---
Yeah this fucked me over... tanked every 5 man up to ubrs. Got full pre raid bis, then got shut down, by every guild when I asked to raid tank for them lol. 
---
I was too dumb/selfless and passed on a lot of pre raid dps gear as I tanking dungeons, now I get to go back and do them for the second time. But hey everyone wants to suck your D in 5 mans, even your officers in guild lol. But they won’t let you tank, and auto loot raid tank gear to the “tanks”
---
that works for HEALERS. Not for dps who have to hardcast to put any kind of pressure on oponent. they would literally self-lock out of their school if all they did was baiting interrupts on anyone not super trigger happy...
---
also the survivability bit is also hillarious considering that was also common complaint that shaman had no defensive CD and despite having mail with shield were barely more durable than clothies, but with terrible version of pushback protection...
---
Bronzebeard baby
---
I’m playing a Paladin and my husband is a Warlock, we’re 56 right now and hope to be 60 soon :)
---
That's a lie though. I was teleported to Southshore when I was stuck in SM. Kinda pissed me off.
---
WHY WOULD YOU EVER WANT TO USE THAT LAME-O TAP SPELL IT TAKES UR LIFE AWAY!!11
---
With that logic you can also say that loch modan is right next to badlands. About the same distance.
---
Well are we just gon' sit around n' wait until he does?
---
What's the name of this damage counter add-on I keep seeing? https://youtu.be/ZJ6VmWP65sE?t=148
---
Or 2% if you wear two of them :P
---
Nethergarde keep is right next to Swamp of Sorrows as well.
---
If your not hitting 60 in a month th do not roll on herod. Your just going to die over and over again
---
There are no Alliance safe zones past ~lvl 32. Everything after that is a Horde gank fiesta. But prior to that? Yeah, Alliance may have it better.
---
Under city is a full faction establishment with pretty much everything. Lochmodan has an inn, armour merchant and an alchemist. Couldn’t even find arrows there.
---
What's the wall strat?
---
Sorry I’m not the master of the internet and have seen everything there is to see. 
---
Comments like this do nothing
---
Not mad just trying to figure out how following loot rules could in anyway make someone a ninja. Clearly you have no argument so you resort to childish insults 😂
---
Flipping requires a lot of effort to make the same amount of gold he would if he just held onto the item and sold it at a much higher price in phase 3.
---
You have to understand not everyone has to play the same way. Some people enjoy playing the AH game, while others prefer to do other things and sell one big item and be done with it.
---
&gt;I don't understand playing as a human either though.
---
diplomacy is a great racial
---
animations are solid for all classes
---
all armor looks good on humans
---
best PVE racial for warriors and rogues on ALI
---
arent gnomes
---
I'd be happy to buy it if anyone has it on Ten Storms, otherwise save it for as long as you don't need money. It will only increase in value and eventually people will be willing to use paid transfers (if it will ever exist) and pay irl or tons of in game cash.
---
Didn't get kicked for handicap or illness got kicked for failure to follow directions...
---
there is no  one rule for all materials
---
some are not needed later as much as now, because raid gear makes it obsolete.  those materials will drop in price because demand drops.  
---
some are not needed now, but needed in later raids  (like nature protections pots)  so those will obviously explode in price.
---
Firemaw Horde FTW!
---
Just keep being a ninja and move on
---
As much as I love my Orc, in practical terms at this point I would recommend the Forsaken.  
---
a}  Cannibalise, Will of the Forsaken and extended water breathing bring a lot of utility to the table; AFAIK, the Forsaken are the only race with two active racials, and Cannibalise is great for eating if you don't want downtime or to spend too much money on food.
---
b}  Tirisfal Glades is IMHO easily the best designed Horde levelling zone in classic.  The quests are generally very well grouped by area, which means that even though a couple of said areas are wide apart, you can still get all of said quests done with a minimum of back tracking.  Even though I love Orcs visually, I always run all of my Orcs over to Tirisfal as soon as I have finished in the Valley of Trials.  
---
I generally only do two Razor Hill quests (*Encroachment* and maybe *Vanquish the Betrayers*) at level 10, immediately before I am planning to go into the Barrens.  This was originally because my first main was a Hunter, and the level 10 Hunter quest takes place there.
---
c}  The only two classes the Forsaken don't have, are the Shaman and Druid.  They have everything else, which means that if you don't want either of those classes, it's very easy to develop a standardised and very fast levelling routine for both your main and all of your alts.
---
d}  The Forsaken mount has the smoothest ride of the Horde mounts, with the least camera movement.  There is just enough to let you know that you're actually riding a mount, but not enough to give you motion sickness, as their particularly is with the Orcish wolf.  I love Orcs as I've said, but I've never really liked my wolf.

I'm about to rerroll to warrior, what should I do to make this change smother?
---
That was us! STV is nuts as Allie also skullflame 🙈
---
I got into a PuG MC group as a tank. At the end of the run, the guild leading the raid asked me to join their guild.
---
No Horde has low 20s quests there, we just dont do them because they are suicide.
---
Makes some sense lore wise I suppose. Aside from Ironforge the kingdoms that make up the Alliance are all battered and damaged from recent conflicts. They’re mostly focused on fixing problems at home and consolidating power. Also they’re allied kingdoms not under rule of the same flag so the dwarves don’t have a reason to be building cities outside of their areas.
---
 The Horde is trying to carve out its place on Azeroth and is expansionist in whatever niches they see.
---
Due diligence with what materials? Its a privately owned family business, if tips father had some information he didnt want tips to find then tips had no avenue to find it. Signing the papers is an assumption of risk that he would have thought was warranted because he trusts(trusted?) his father both because of their familial relation and his fathers business acumen. Your point, roughly speaking, is akin to saying an 8yr old is partially to blame because their parent didnt look both ways and was struck crossing the street.

Only if you play on a pve server. Alliance are outnumbered everywhere on a pvp realm. Horde generally have higher to much higher population on a pvp realm and have a team sitting at every dungeon entrance. The Alliance fights for everything the whole time.
---
Mountain Dwarf + Pink Bird + taurens + elf mask= Error
---
That's what you get for rolling the inferior faction. FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
You're absolutely right.  As a fellow Priest let me tell you when you'll need to use your unarmed skill, Never.
---
I said that I wait for everyone else’s rolls; if everyone else is gonna let the mage have it then I’ll let the mage have it.
---
You reporting the same person multiple times doesn’t warrant a ban, this is to keep people from spam reporting someone every day and effectively banning them because they don’t like that person
---
*splooge*
---
Fuck, it’s everywhere.
---
Ganking people in a spot guards dont see/cant get to, however is where things start to get into the arguable "terrain abuse"
---
Pretty sure both quest at the beach around level 20 and move inland for the later levels; Ashenvale is not that bad. Try Hillsbrad as horde though, that's a fun experience.
---
You can go from 1-25 in the Barrens, a horde *friendly* zone. That's one whole zone to replace 2.5 of our *neutral yet unfair* zones we allegedly have. Terrible comparison my dude.
---
HEAL ME ON
---
Haven't put one in myself for anything but I have heard people say they respnse time ia dog shit. A week though? Thats ridiculous.
---
It would depend on you level and if you are on a PVP server.
---
Seriously. The only real difficult part if it is the damn torch room, and even then it becomes ez mode with a competent mage in the group.
---
Ye but if the group leader is a prick and says "eVeRy oNe nEeD" you not gonna stand and say that he is a prick right?
---
You never leave BRM.
---
Why not? Everyone can use that gold. And gold buys BOE's.
---
Also surely farming gold to get the weapon is a lot better than just randomly lucking out
---
It's easy - always be on the same page, and communicate.
---
If a BOE drops it is regular to type "all Need" and if someone can use as an upgrade they say so and usually the other party members agree to let them have &amp; equip start using it.
---
When you group with people it should lead to "tide rises all ships" and get upgrades, rather than bickering about gold.
---
The amount of dps APES is doing in mc right now in their blues and MC purples is already more than enough to kill Patchwerk with time still left on the clock, and it's not like they are using every consumable and world buff out there.
---
Yeah world pvp on a higher horde server is easier for horde I agree with that.
---
Lo nobody would bother going to Gnomer then. That dungeon already sucks.
---
It also seems like horde has better quest-reward gear (melee/ranged weapons in particular). On my alliance rogue/warrior, I would out level my weapons quite a bit and would look on wowhead to see what weapons were in my level range that either dropped from a dungeon boss or were given as a quest reward, and 9 times out of 10 the weapons that would be a significant upgrade for me were rewards from Horde only quests
---
Hillsbrad is Alliance favored. So is the Hinterlands.
---
A lot of high level zones have no bias(Tanaris, Ungoro, silithis, searing gorge, etc).
---
I mean what are you gonna do at that point; greed to make a point and lose your chance to roll?
---
Same model, different scorpion
---
Then press fucking greed !!!! Someone in the group needs it to USE IT. THINK!!
---
It doesn't matter we all end up in the barrens and go to the same general routes after. Personally I don't like the taurens starting area quests because of all the walking. But it's such a beautiful zone.
---
BoE epics SURE.  But leveling blue BoE's? Fuck that.  Nobody is going to buy a fucking BoE blue right now for 300g that isn't some type of BiS gear.  Need on gear upgrades, greed for the money.
---
Good Riddance.
---
BYEEEEEEE
---
Leave and black list the prick leader and let my guild and his guild know about that behavior.
---
Lol wtf? I would never roll on gear that dps are after. Same with weapons. I have seen both MH/OH drop from Rend. I only just got the offhand because no one in my group needed it.
---
Whirlwind weapon is lvl 30 quest that is  very hard to solo until you\`re around lvl 36 (and already have Whirlwind attack). Before that you just use whatever weapon you can find with highest DPS.
---
How the game was meant to be played? What are you on about?
---
Let people play the game however they like and enjoy. 
---
I played vanilla and been playing private servers for years and i completely hate leveling but i love the game. For him, and me as well the game starts at 60 and thats fine.
---
i have elvui but i cant show the durations left on cc. Any tip?
---
I think Blizz killed a lot of decently balanced pvp realms when they let the realm hops out due to high populations.
---
Unless something’s changed, there’s no free trial for classic.
---
When you use Wrath and Starfire, keep an eye out for when they crit and remember what they crit for.
---
Yea, it is true for specs when tanking, but someone with fury or a fast arms weapon and talents invested outside of prot will be able to generate threat using rage more economically for the amount of threat generated. An example would be trying to tank in prot spec st level 20, you might have mitigation (like bonus defense) but speccing into literally any other talent tree will make you more effective at holding aggro based on the amount of rage used
---
i really think "immersion" plays only a role for a small percentage of players. people want to have fun playing the game and not many take the time reading every single bit of lore
---
Ah yes the low level content, where we all spend the majority of our time. Level 30 is years of commitment to get to...
---
I guess when your skin regenerates, it's just another resource to harvest...
---
Welcome to /r classic wow. Where the stories are made up and the game doesn’t matter. Is there a version of this sub to talk about the actual game and not to farm karma for 40 year olds who never learned to play?
---
Nope. After disabling tsm it's still there.
---
hillsbrad was literally inaccessible when i was in that level range. and then the path to alterac / plaguelands is a friggin bottleneck past tarren mill. its absurd.
---
Not sure, benediction is pretty fairly balanced if not alliance favored. I don’t play on all realms so can’t really know.
---
With the patch we're on it's a little different from what I remember but essentially, you don't use anything else then HT Rank 4.
---
Rejuvenation always up on the MT/OT (you'll get assigned one) and regrowth when things go south.
---
In dungeon, forget about it and just use HT max rank whenever the tank drop low enough to not do too much overheal. Try to cluster your healing so that you have some downtime to recover mana due to your high spirit.
---
Example for dungeon healing:
---
1. Tank down to 50%
---
2. HT Max rank to full the tank
---
3. Rejuvenation to the DPS who are (hopefully) slightly hurt
---
3a. Rejuvenation to the lock if you are not in a risky/hard pull
---
4. Wait until the tank is down to 50% and or there is a critical damage around so you recover the mana spent
---
I suggest installing an addon that show you the mp5 and spirit regen tick.
---
I use also ElvUI that has that natively but there are others around or you can import some Weakauras.
---
Leveling was rough. Be prepared to group for most things.
---
Sounds like you have an attitude problem, and based on the comments it seems everyone agrees this is a YOU problem.
---
To be specific for rogues, you want a slower MH weapon sword for SS strike (2.5 or higher) and a slower dagger if dagger spec (1.8 or higher) b/c the instant attacks from SS and Backstab go based off that higher weapon damage, but the modifier gets reduced to 2.4 or 1.7 depending on if it is a sword or dagger. So you are effectively getting more damage out of your SS and Backstab from a slower weapon in MH than if you had a faster weapon in MH with the same stats. 
---
And then fast OH is for the instant poison procs since the OH isn't used in any instant attacks.
---
You don't get that comment? Deal with it is the response. So many people have to just deal with it when it comes to many aspects of WoW. If you want everything changed so drastically then you can try out retail. Maybe if they have Classic+ they can have better items for plate and mail for hunters and warriors, but you're gonna have to deal with it.
---
Usually if a boe drops I’ve been pretty much passing on them unless I can use them.
---
Now if the boe has a huge payout and thanks to auctioneer it’s been pretty accurate in that regard I’ll need it.
---
If I’m with my buddies we go by the if it’s an upgrade system for you need it.
---
Pugs it’s Everyman for themselves.
---
I use a script to mass sell certain items. They are old scripts I got from a super old forum post tho.
---
I mean if we are nearing or surpassing the dage of top guild right now, I just don't see how you think naxx will be anything but a faceroll.
---
Can you actually explain some mechanics that seem so hard and complex?
---
Because right now, everything in naxx seems like a fucking joke compared to even normal raids today.
---
Where?
---
PvP servers have ALWAYS been unbalanced (except for many RP-PVP servers it seems), they will ALWAYS be unbalanced, and nothing Blizzard does is ever going to change that.
---
They can't change the nature of PvP players. PvP players want every advantage they can get. They don't want "fair" fights, they want to be on the more populous side, they want the best racials, etc.
---
It happened in Vanilla, it happened on private servers, it happened in Retail.
---
To expect anything different is to be naive.
---
You can block by going interface&gt;social&gt;block channel invites.
---
leaks claims tbc n wrath no classic+
---
Most tanks are actually Furies with a shield. And every Fury wants Dal’Rend’s.
---
Thank you. Is it something for people that dont enjoy the normal wow? Played to lvl 20 then quit
---
You're probably right and I used a macro that use both. Memory fades :)
---
Detrimental to progression? They already killed the only endgame content there is lol, not much to progress through at this point
---
Multiboxer claiming to have friends? Unheard of
---
Yeah that’s great man! Pugs seem to be the only viable way to start tanking raids immediately lol. Your probably a solid tank, and going to be really helpful for a guild that is building up their core. Congrats man!
---
Last Tuesday evening, after my server was reduced to 1 layer, I had a short 5 minute queue to log in.  On the queue countdown box there was an option for free server transfer.   I wonder if you logged in and found yourself in a queue if you would have this same option.
---
Reading stuff like this makes me so happy that I picked a PvE server this time around.
---
Damn straight ! All those quest sending me multiple time to ratchet, even for nothing. Succubus is level 20, i have to menethil, darkshore, ashenval then barrens, without getting kill... Fuck that ! It's like warlock was designed to be horde exclusive class, like shaman
---
I mean, alliance's description is literally "Alliance is united by their hate of demonic forces", maybe they were meant to have warlock and alliance priest at the beginning
---
You kiss your account goodbye you lowly gold buyer.
---
That’s commitment right there
---
you can redeem them for cash though, no cap on how much balance you can get
---
Well you can already see the prices of some items shifting dramatically over short periods of time, especially with the release of new content. 
---
Living essences used to go for about 10g on my server, until DM dropped and it became much easier to farm them, so the price dropped to about 1.5g. Black Dragonscales were another, as the prices were higher with lower levels not being able to run UBRS but still needing the materials, but now the prices have dropped from about 1.5g to 85s.
---
What about for righteous orbs when someone needs them to craft something theyre saving up for? Clearly they need to use as opposed to others in the group who needs to sell. Inevitably there's a line drawn in the sand and it's not "no discussion whatsoever". If it were no discussion whatsoever, then this question wouldn't come up so much.
---
The real answer is say which way you're doing the loot before you start the run. Not saying anything, and then being mad about the way people are rolling is the worst option possible.
---
Naxx wasn't so easy that a bunch of monkeys could waltz in and clear it, but it also wasn't as hard as people are making it out to be.
---
less than 1% of raiding guilds clearing it can be attributed to a variety of reasons
---
1) People lost motivation to raid once TBC neared
---
2) People were just bad
---
There's a reason why some private servers have Naxx bosses buffed to double their HP, and guilds still killed them.
---
Nothing crazy but I was randomly asked to tank by someone in our guild.  Honestly hadn't tanked ever as a druid but said sure just bear with me.  Ended up getting 3 pieces of gear one of which was a pretty low drop rate.
---
Wetlands? Duskwood? Then We can count durotar and barrens as contested zones too? because they are the same then.
---
Not all servers are like that. My server is almost a 50/50 split
---
Oh lawd you just gave me butterflies! I might pop on later today :)
---
I've done over 40 arena/anger runs...i've SEEN 0 HOJ drops. And i've only seen Gorosh twice. Not impressed :P
---
I get it for people who can sit and babysit their auctions all day. Or have a strong knowledge and market share for what they're selling. Like on my herbalist character I knew the basic value of herbs each expansion, so I didn't mind sitting on them until the value was close to what I wanted to sell at. 
---
But those irregular stacks of 17 leather and scales I have that I just got from killing quest mobs? I'm going to sell that cheap just to get it out of my bags. I'll let someone who knows the market worry about getting a good value off them because it's not worth my time to do the research and hold onto then for as little as I sell.
---
No pve content in p2
---
Trash
---
Also hunter can farm gold much faster if you are a shaman it can take you 2x time to farm that gold meaning that hunter boe is that much more valuable to you in terms of time than it is to the actual hunter. If you didn't heal as shamy the boe wouldn't have even dropped all party contributed but only one person benefits from the drop that is freely an upgrade for everyone? I dno
---
The same people who bitch about something this dumb are the same people who'd manage to get hit by a train.
---
Exploiting the terrain means they can't move.
---
 So.......... walk away from them lol
---
Didn’t have time? It took same amount of time dedicated  to raid MC progression than it did any other raid (top guilds worked on Rag for months)
---
Raid  times really haven’t deviated much from Vanilla to what we see now and back then you’ve got guilds who weren’t good and raid 3-4 nights and could barely do BWL. 
---
Fact is dedicated and talented players still mattered to clear content, period and you’re guild had to have at least 25+ of those type of players for anything AQ and above.
---
Flipping takes effort if you don’t understand how to buy low and sell high... YOU have to understand phase 3 isn’t even out yet,  there are no twinks - even then it’s ONLY WSG until AB comes out.  Everything you have seen as to how much this thing is worth or how rare it is based on RETAIL knowledge.  Do you realize how many more people run Uldaman every single day now?  If you’re not maximizing what available resources you have right now you’re just a fool because the supply of these is only going to go up in time and if you’re sitting on a guaranteed 500+ gold for something that literally has a TBD date months possibly even a year away you deserve to not have an epic mount by level 50 and then some.
---
I see where everyone is going with this. It seems like the horde is more focused on the mob questing rather then the story based quests. But I think what this is, is an accurate representation of the society in both factions. Politics of the faction, like two different countries, are going to be much different. While the alliance features a society made strictly from a human perspective, the horde are hunched over in their beastly postures, ready to kill the humans. In an almost animalistic way. humans come from a completely different background. Human life is centered around civilization and a central utopia with peaceful and militarized settlements that communicate often.
---
We are hitting near patchwork dps right now lol, what makes you think being aq/bwl and some early naxx geared means people wouldn't do enough dps to be bad?
---
People are stupid, though. If they pull the pat on the ramp and we’re all at the right, they’re going to jump down to us
---
And most servers are not like your server.
---
From behind ;)
---
Hey man, he could be dueling a Rogue, Out of mana, stuck in a net, and disarmed, and the rogue could be at 2 HP and his closed fists could win him the duel.
---
OP should definitely spend time leveling up his unarmed skill be his frustration is totally justified.
---
/S
---
It’s only useful to have high level crafting professions on alts. The point is to collect stuff with your main and send it all to your alt to use. Having gathering professions on a character that never leaves a city won’t make much sense.
---
Orbs are not an item. Its a consumable material. Completely another story.
---
Yeah man, I NEED edgemasters handguards on my hunter!  I NEED gold for my epic mount.
---
I guess that should've been more obvious. 
---
Thanks!
---
Entitled much?
---
And the ally Blasted lands FP is not even half a mile away from Stonard. Swamp of Sorrows FPs is a non issue.
---
Hell I'd take barrens 10-20 over Westfall any day of the week.
---
Whenever I see a low level or low health horde I hit them with the gnomish net trinket and then the death ray. If they survive the death ray I leave and let them live even if it leaves them at a sliver of health.
---
Massive swings. Stuff is worth so much more gold than it was a couple weeks even a week ago. I remember buying nether essences for 60-70s each and man if I knew ahead of time. Now a lesser nether essences is around 1g and a greater is around 2g75s.  And stone! Can't remember which one but I remember seeing it was good to farm but it was barely selling for any more then a few copper than vendor price and now it's 5-6 times the vendor price. I vendored so many too -_-
---
I mean if you're playing with your guild/friends in PoE and a valuable item drops, you usually sell and split the cash. If you're in a pug it's usually gonna be perm alloc anyway.
---
Maybe it is? I’ll give you that. Idk, it’s just aggravating that some people assume I need them to help me because I’m squishy. I’m all for help in groups and stuff, but I like leveling alone mostly. And I know another comment said I’d never use my unarmed, but I’m still wanting it as high as possible. 
---
Maybe I woke up in a mood today and it just got under my skin.
---
Totally agree. I have fantasies of becoming a warrior and party lead to make dungeons a much more fun place, and instantly boot toxic shitheads that are so prevelant in the pre-bis dungeons
---
I'm pretty sure unarmed priest skill is about as low on the totem pole as anyone could imagine. You have no melee abilities, and if you get disarmed, you can still use ALL of you other abilities.
---
Do you also have a weapon chain to reduce disarm time?
---
Miks or mikes cannot remember the name and yes got it off twitch app. Im gona dm you a video so you can see it in pve action.
---
Spirit is not high prio until 3pc T2.
---
Me and 2IRL friends started at the same time,1 is quitting and I just know the interest will wain now, hoping guildies keep me going...
---
Otherwise I'll have to quit/reroll on another server with a PS4 buddy
---
Not yet but I will later.
---
That's funny, and that's why this setting is MVP.
---

---
Did I really get all of those downvotes simply because I said Briarwood instead of Reed? Yikes.
---
Flying didn't kill a big chunk of the game. A big chunk of the game not being interesting enough (beyond levelling) killed a big chunk of the game. Flying just gave people the *option* to skip running through it and save time.
---
You will be shunned out of jealousy and ignorance. Enjoy ur god class!
---
Farm the valuable mats sell them and buy the stuff your alt needs.

You could cut it "short" and go get the WPL Flight, and then run from Chillwind...but then you'd have to die from the WPL mobs 3-10 times or from the lvl 50+ horde that one shot every alliance running.
---
Why does horde get a port?
---
Not sure if you can do what you want, try this
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast [mod:shift] Berserker Stance; Defensive Stance
---
    /equipslot [mod:shift] 16 TwoHand; OneHand
---
    /equipslot [nomod] 17 Shield
---
That video is unavailable because the uploader made it private.
---
What is an appropriate aount to ask for portaling people to different cities?
---
Peacebloom
---
... I gotta admit, this guy has a solid ground
---
Maybe an unpopular opinion but getting ganked while leveling was part of the fun, it is an added adrenaline rush that you don't get on only pve servers. Now that I'm 60 it's even more fun since I can do some of the ganking now.
---
Grave Moss, Plaguebloom, Icecap, Black Lotus.
---
I believe a couple of those can be obtained from the Treants in DM, but they don't drop off Lashers and thus aren't flooding the market.
---
Alliance on Herod. No, you won't have an issue finding a raiding guild.
---
Has this ever happened to you though? I almost exclusively played PvP in BC and WotLK getting Arena Master title when achievements came out. I’m trying to think of scenario where this would even happen. 
---
If you’re getting interrupted it’s because you’re already in combat. If you’re close enough to the enemy that they can interrupt you should’ve stopped the summon before getting locked out of your spells. 
---
In that sense, using a paladin or warlock mount could cause you to join a fight you intended to run from, but getting actually locked out from an interrupt seems unlikely.
---
Maybe you got it done early? I just hit 60, and literally put 3 hunter party leads on my ignore list in 2 days. So many toxic shitheads in pugs expecting you to run the dungeon for THEM just because they are party lead.
---
They can't admit they picked the easier faction with better racials.
---
Thanks. I’m a budding herbalist and wasn’t sure how this affected me.
---
I play on Pyrewood Village. Altoholic, currently mostly playing warrior and a little priest. 27 and 24. For the Horde!
---
\#1 Classic Monk class.  Also Guild bank + Reagent Bank. Really I would love to see the world of warcraft on a 10-15 year cycle where at the end of BFA it merges into the same world (think diablo seasons but on a 10-15 year cycle) with a mix of dev / community inspired new developments / QoL improvements for each box along the way.  Make the game better with each iteration while staying true to the expansion(no flying in vanilla) instead of being laser focused on re-releasing a replica.
---
What addon shows swing timers?
---
I don’t play retail, so I wouldn’t know how their economy is.
---
Not everyone is trying to play the market, some people just want to turn a quick buck and others want to invest and hoard goodies until they are worth more. Who are you to say which is wrong or right? People will play how they want.
---
You seem like you can’t handle people disagreeing with you based on this conversation and many others in your comment history, so I’ll let it go from here. Good luck out there.
---
Im not suggesting shit Im saying what is your leveling options, you dont have to choose any of these and can do 1 leftover green quests per zone or just farm boars in elwyn.
---
Advice : you don't. Get it at 45
---
Nah you can even kill the bosses solo or with a warlock friend. Gives good gold

I have weapon swap macros which also change stance and do a battle shout... all with one button press.
---
I agree with you but it must be annoying if your faction is underpopulated.
---
I'm pretty sure a lot of shamans will get this too
---
Everyone rolls on orbs. If someone needs for an enchant, they use their communication to tell the group about it and hope you are playing with decent folks. Or you make your own run and reserve the first orb.
---
I rerolled from PVE, thankfully I was only 33.  It’s world of WARcraft, you’re at war with the other faction - not fighting them takes away so much playability from the game.  Bgs are one thing but really world pvp is so incredibly fun I feel bad for people that choose to miss out on a huge part of the game.  I guess some people just play for gear or 15 year old boss fights though
---
&gt;Leveling was rough. Be prepared to group for most things.
---
Warrior levelling is difficult! I found grouping and tackling quests that are green to be a good strategy.
---
Well, if we're talking about where we spend most of our time, the Alliance also have a capital city literally on either side of Black Rock Mountain. There isn't really a horde bias.
---
That’s the case for any end game content in all of wows history . People bail on current mythic raid tier progression once they know the next patch is near. 
---
Doesn’t change the fact that only a small percentage of guilds clear the content and if it was easy enough to face roll like people claim and not require profession dedication they wouldn’t of just quit, I get there’s different reasons why people tapped out but fact remains they tapped out because it wasn’t a cake walk.
---
I respecced dagger about that level too, sword spec is garbage pvp. I use backstab in dungeon runs and hemo and ghostly while solo. I think ambush makes leveling easy as you can do half of their hp with it as your opener.
---
Nope hunters get it too with Improved  hawk aspect. The fucker only procs when the mobs about to die.
---
But you can't because they ignored you by then.
---
Huh, I've run BRD probably a hundred times and never knew you could do that.
---
Usually, priests will mind vision to find the torch bearers, then the whole group just hauls ass toward the nearest one. If you don't have a priest, you try to find one from the door, otherwise just start clearing toward the fire elemental on top of where you light the flame and you'll see one on the way.
---
I'd assume as much. Substantially cheaper on their bottom line which I'm sure Activision will not pass on. I was a huge TBC fanatic but after months of classic I am now on the classic+ side.
---
WeaponSwingTimer 😁
---
I wish I knew what this was like instead of watching all my friends speedrun through the content
---
the insect, the!
---
And then they easily camped you till you had to sneak away, lol
---
You might consider it pricky but he could easily say “all greed” and then need it... 
---
On the larger point, it happens where someone will get the boe because it’s an upgrade but either he has it already or he just dosent equip it and sells it anyway.
---
Im in the ‘all need’ camp because although it’s clearly not perfect it does eliminate these really scummy practises.
---
However, it dosent mean it always has to be ‘all need’. If everyone else is greeding, then greed. If the group agrees to give pattern to the mage, warlock, priest then you should also agree.
---
Normally, if you communicate with your group and then wait till everyone else casts their rolls; ‘all need’ dosent make you a ninja.
---
I deleted one the other day. Didn’t know what it was used for lol I’m a mage and must have farmed one
---
This is when you add their name to your hitlist.
---
Are you leveling a warrior with a quiver?
---
You may want to look into add-ons for this if you don't use them already. In particular, a damage meter add-on like recount. This will keep track of all the damage everyone does, and if you click on your name specifically it will break down all of your spells and how many hits misses and crits you did (and for how much!). Very useful for end game stuff.

---
Improved Mana Burn is only useful if you struggle with casters (which you usually don't) and if you do group pvp (which doesn't usually happen before battlegrounds are released).
---
Improved Inner Fire is awesome vs Rogues and Hunters, but useless against anybody else. It can be helpful if you do Diremaul solo farming and have shitty gear.
---
Improved VE is a must have imho as the added sustain is what makes you win mirrors and outlive enemies. Opinions on this vary thou and it also depends on playstyle.
---
Healing Focus is 2 points wasted, since you never cast Holy skills.
---
You can move a few points around inside the Shadow Tree. They are flex choices. However, I didn't find improved Mind Blast to be needed ever (in PvP nor PvE). A lot of people like the increased range for their Mind Flay but distances are not that great in PvP and for PvE you only need it when doing raids.
---
If you want to go for a hybrid spec, try subbing in Mental Agility and Spirit Tap.
---
Oh, thanks. I way overthought this one haha
---
Hillsbrad has a long level range, about 24-30.  There aren't enough quests to sustain you during that time. Depending on your actual level, you could go to Camp Taurajo in the barrens (23-25, lots of quests), Thousand needles (28-30, not quite as many quests but at least a level's worth), or Ashenvale (22-30, similar to hillsbrad a large level range but not enough quests to bring you through the whole bit). 
---
If you're up closer to level 30, then thousand needles or STV are an option.  Arathi quests start about level 30 but quickly get into 32-34 range so you might be a bit underleveled. 
---
Level 30 means you can start running SM GY which is a great spot, and library is doable as a healer at 32, tank/DPS at 33/34 minimum
---
Sex is nice. But have you had a horde help you with an elite mob or escort before.
---
If you aren't successful in the game, don't blame the game, blame the player and improve yourself. Your saltiness won't get you anywhere, you have to look at the things more positive way.
---
You deal waayyyyyyy more damage with a wand. It isn't your forte. No one benefits from leveling their unarmed besides maybe a tank who gets disarmed once in a blue moon. You're wasting your time man.
---
Its that "its not perfect" it is completely wrong. Period.

I've only ever played horde but loved all the old warcraft rts games. How does the storyline on the alliance relate to it? Any examples?
---
cu
---
On a boat? You can't avoid rocket helmet into MC no matter how hard you try.
---
Lol your counterpoints are not very strong here at all. You basically just said “i disagree because im right and because i think youre not right and because you should quest in dwm.” Like OP had pretty clear evidence from both perspectives for a majority of the zones lmao youre gonna have to do better than a biased opinion
---
Thank you for the info, should I buy some greens or blues from AH?
---
Except Wetlands, Duskwood, and Redridge are contested(neutral) zones and Durotar / Barrens are not, which I think is the point that person was making.
---
3 contested zones with basically no quests for horde when they could've been some early pvp hotspots / alternate questing zones? 
---
I dunno what he's trying to say, but just reminding you you're comparing faction-specific vs. contested zones. Guess he's trying to say those 3 "contested" zones aren't really horde-viable questing zones and may as well be considered ally-faction specific?
---
How do you figure that?
---
I get players were bad, that was never the original point being made, just that it wasn't a faceroll like lots of people say it was. Also, can't really compare MC clearing in Classic when we have 1.12 talents, spell balances, updated itemization etc. go look up the dog shit talents the game launched with when MC first hit. 
---
That aside, the hardcore guilds by the time Naxx rolled around had basically the same knowledge we do now and only potential limiting factors were availability of modern mods (though some existed) and PC hardware/internet.
---
I full cleared Naxx, we knew itemization, we knew raid timers, group comps,  we knew everything current guilds know today and it still took weeks of progression. With that being said I don't think it is going to take nearly the same amount of the time in Classic but doesn't change the fact the content was challenging when it came out and it wasn't just due to people being ignorant of how the game worked.
---
Name of quest chain? Not remembering this
---
Prepare to dungeon level. Groups always need tanks.
---
Should I buy some gear before I join the warrior cult?
---
Thanks you, I appreciate it. They asked me to be their OT, which is a role I was hoping for. But due to real life conflict, I may end up being my guilds MT!
---
durotar and barrens aren't contested zones cause you can't kill horde there in pvp without flagging
---
as someone who is basically one of your friends who stopped playing- what is the point? leveling fun but the game gets dull when your only option to progress requires 10 people minimum.
---
Hey I'll message you in a bit!
---
No, I got gold from doing other things too.
---
It really depends on your realm dude
---
In the addon settings there's a list of all the text strings you can use. 
---
Find one you like for health and set the target frame how you prefer.
---
Personal preference. Currently I use TSM + Auctioneer because I like the Auctioneer listing pane and a few other features. If I were just mass posting items like alchemy products or gathered goods I'd probably drop Auctioneer.
---
Dual spec, but im also a druid so i have bias, i would love to be able to play bear druid and be able to switch to moonkin, I would make dual spec at least 500g, probably 1000g. And you should only be able to change spec in a rested area.
---
I finished getting my preraid bis like a couple of days before diremaul then I did diremaul for those items a bit.
---
^(-) **A whole 4 hours of what makes the game great.** 
---
No , it's you who made that moment great .
---
Math. You need 4 tanks with 75% attendance and a 4th dps warrrior or dps/heal druid willing to tank when neccesary for a 40man raid guild. For every instance of 40man team in a guild you need \~4 tanks in a 60person roster. And at least one of them won't be tank mainspec.
---
so 3/60 = 1/20 raiders are mainspec tank.
---
But 1/5 people in dungeon groups are tanks.
---
so 3/4 or 75% of all dungeon tanks are not in fact mainspec tanks, but instead mainspec dps who happen to be tanking this dungeon for you right now. And the real number is higher, because the mainspec tanks get their purple gear stupid fast, and thus have no need to run dungeons.
---
And every dps warrior needs dal'rends.
---
There is no practical limit to how many dal'rends groups could exist at once, it is bounded entirely by how many dps warriors choose to tank.
---
Since you are dum dum I will explain it to you.
---
The general idea still stands and its exactly the same policy. BUT   when talking about a boe item if the rest of the group greeds to sell it and the one person (or more) who needs it wins it then he has to equip it atleast once to prove the need part. With orbs if I need it for an enchant and the rest of the group just wants to sell it if the select greed and I need, there is no way for me to prove that I didn't lie. Therefore its completely another story which is explained when the group is formed. 
---
Thanks.
---
Any half competent warrior can tank if that have that gearset.
---
You get more than enough ticks off with improved gouge without having to wait 5 minutes each time, nor waste reagents.
---
I did lets say two dozen Lava runs and one full brd clear and I never did it any other way :D
---
I don't understand why you kept in the horde favored neutral zones but excluded the alliance ones? Or course the horde has a better place experience when you phrase it like this.
---
Staff of Jordan from random Coyote in the Badlands.
---
the easier faction that doesn't have paladins. This entire thread is overblown with salt.
---
It's still the same number of people going for the same loot pool.
---
Horde is vastly superior. Should pretty much sum it up for everyone.
---
Except this isn't what's happening. The horde is really reluctant to tip the situation into a war. The humans are in turmoil, with a dragon controlling all communication.
---
Fun fact about Duskwood, there is actually one quest for the Horde there. It's in the tower right before the entrance of Deadwind Pass. Not trying to poke a hole in your argument I just thought it was cool.
---
How do you purchase items made available by pvp rankings?  Are there any resources that have prices or currencies required?
---
Wetlands has a god awful positioning for the Alliance town. You will spend a significant amount of time running back and forth if you're not using a questing add-on.
---
I mean these days we're Furies wearing plate instead of leather, but basically yeah.
---
You can bind “Interact with Target” to a key to avoid this situation.
---
Looks like I'm quitting when TBC comes out again then. Flying mounts, no new 40 man, raids, dungeon finder and the new lands etc. ruined it imho
---
I still didnt bother going lol
---
Savage Gladiator Chain on my first arena run with no one there to roll against me.
---
Roll PVE server and stock up on diapers.
---
Whaaat no way
---
Just make another account in your battle.net profile. There's a link to create starter edition, I think that should work.
---
Get questie. It will help show you where to go
---
I got mine in two runs
---
Flight from UC vs Ironforge to get to lights hope
---
Nah, WoW is about the horde. Even in cinematics there's like 3 alliance clips. 2 being Anduin
---
i believe its called RangeCheck or RangeDisplay, i know its build into DBM for fights where you want to be a certain distance from party members
---
Same here.
---
Sounds like OP has little experience with alliance questing. Most of his examples are straight up wrong (like calling hillsbrad horde only??).
---
If you take feralas for example, here are the quests : https://classicdb.ch/?quests=1.357#0+4+1+2
---
I'm counting more alliance quests than horde ones. As I said, alliance has plenty of quests, they're just not as obvious as horde quests.
---
It's around 200-300g on my server. Not many Mages are buying them its seems as it's a PvE server. I could see prices going up when PvP Ranking comes out tho.
---
Having played both Ally &amp; Horde I kinda like the town-mismatch to be honest.
---
Ashenvale? Yeah, Horde have a strong town presence as its' close to Org. and they're a militaristic race, whereas Nelves have open-borders to nature.
---
Arathi? Once more, the Horde are setting out to have a strong military foothold whereas the alliance is just a small Refuge of folk (and it's a quick flight over to Hillsbrad for an Inn/Mailbox.)
---
Speaking of Hillsbrad, I'd say Alliance is much harder to town-raid there than Horde, and if we're talking balance, horde has no place to repair in Hillsbrad (except the wandering merchant.) ((( That or I'm a dumbass now on 3 characters )))
---
Regardless, I kinda like the variation in town design in favor of building a world that "makes sense" vs a balanced one. Wouldn't make sense to me for Nelves in Ashenvale to have giant fortified walls, y'know?
---
Yea idk why people say Barrens is a bad leveling zone? Crazy good zone with rewards ranging for a ton of levels. Also is Horde territory, so don’t need to worry about ever being attacked by alliance until 20/25ish.
---
Looted briarwood reed in my first UBRS run
---
No. The math just isn't there. It's not bad by any means, but as soon as you can get an upgrade you should. It's just better.
---
Yeah I mean if you believe the actions of an adult in their 20s are comparable to the actions of an 8 year old why are you even arguing? Such an opinion holds no basis or consensus in reality or law.
---
Guess it's an expensive way to learn about trust, and that even family cannot assumed to be trustworthy. Would've been much cheaper to look into it himself and do DD. Doesn't matter if it's a private business, you ask questions, if the answers don't add up then you dig further.
---
Knowledge is power.
---
the buttons literally have meaning, ya know =p
---
Source?
---
Once again I never said people were ignorant of how the game worked. But there is a difference between knowing how the game works, knowing hit caps, spell coefficients, etc and actually executing.
---
&gt;Also, can't really compare MC clearing in Classic when we have 1.12 talents, spell balances, updated itemization etc. go look up the dog shit talents the game launched with when MC first hit.
---
Sure, but you can compare Naxx vs Naxx.
---
&gt;potential limiting factors were availability of modern mods
---
What do modern mods let you do that previous mods didnt?
---
&gt;With that being said I don't think it is going to take nearly the same amount of the time in Classic
---
How long do you think it's going to take to clear naxx when it's released on classic?
---
I'm using Mass of McGowan. 2 less damage per swing, same speed, more strength. The crit hurts, but really I like the extra stam.
---
And it's 60g instead of 300.
---
Not have time for a google search?
---
Says: " **Horde has a vastly superior questing experience over Alliance** "
---
Means: " **Horde has an easier time getting to 60. IDGAF about lore, actual player experiences, or amount of detailed content.** "
---
The game was made 15 years ago. Youre literally complaining about nothing. Stop applying modern day logic to it you fucking idiot.
---
My easy solution is just to have a macro that outlines a simple loot rule whenever I’m group leader and everyone is gathered. The rule is simple. “For ALL BoE items, Everyone is too greed. If needed you are expected to equip it on the spot.”
---
Lol haven't pugged in months just know how they work... But yeah keep whining about ninjas as the reason why your undergeared..
---
lmao I'm the dum dum. Your point is basically that you can't trust people and theres no proof for orbs. Well hey, that's the same argument people make to support everyone rolling need on boe epics. Because that person may just sell it later. You're making all the same arguments you were so mad about other people making earlier.
---
She saw the marks on my shoulder
---
I've literally had more cloudkeeper legplates drop from that event than offhands, never mind mainhands.
---
I have my mount bound to one of my mouse buttons so its really easy to mount and dismount on command.
---
Isnt the attack speed normalized in pve anyways?
---
I use the rank 1 frost bolt just to get the slow effect ASAP
---
Is there a tools for finding the most active guild on your server? Not necessarily for raid content but I use guild chat as a secondary LFG chat, so the more active members, the better!
---
Had to buy expensive bags to hold all my TFs. They should really be stackable. Takes up so much inventory space
---
Would have left after the first.
---
yup, and you have 8 bars...how have you filled those up
---
same
---
He literally said alliance have better low level zones until after barrens
---
yeah I always go for funny ganks 
---
like I won't kill lowbies, but I will stun lock them so mobs theyre fighting kill them. hilarious 
---
or sapping people in stitches path
---
What eight bars? There's the default one, two above that one, and two to the side. Where's the other three?
---
People already do guild banks with specialized alt characters, usually run by the GM. Adding back wrath guild banks would change nothing except make it less annoying to pool the resources they were already pooling.
---
I always thought LFG and flying were some of the best additions to the game, at least personally. That would be pretty sweet though.
---
woah thanks &gt;&lt;   
---
well actualy i dont mind it worst solo class... i just worry if people mock me bcz im suck at class im playing bcz it too complex to learn...
---
isnt the game 12+
---
*troll toll
---
mine has 4 to the side, and the main action bar you can scroll to a second set as well
---
I leveled a Orc Lock to 43 before switching to a Paladin which is now also 43.
---
I can 100% say My Questing/Instance exp was Leaps and bounds better on Horde. I had quests being thrown at me on my Lock and was able to skip annoying quests. On my Paladin I'm running all over the damn place and see myself doing every single quest whether I want to or not because of such a lack of relevant quests for my level.
---
I will honestly probably never make an Alliance Alt and Make my Alts on Horde side, it's that unenjoyable. I'll take a Better leveling exp that takes 5-8 days played over faster BRM access especially since you can just go to UC and AFK fly to searing gorge.
---
And so is he. Notice "Brutal" "TK"    
---
Nobody raided with PvP gear(other than some resilience if your tank wasn't def capped), while a lot of PvE gear was better than PvP gear in PvP.  
---
Just stop spreading false information.
---
Yeah. 1.6 vs 2.0 attack speed.
---
Do you not know what a "quote" means? Your username is very relevant lol
---
Be careful, hes already angery.
---
Send yourself some weapons, healing potions, trollsblood potions, and cloth to pick up at the first mailbox. Keep first aid leveled up and use it often. Ultimately the fastest way to level will be to tank dungeons but either way you should keep mailing yourself gear replacements when a slot falls too far behind.
---
Go check out retail. There's still not nearly enough tanks. There's way more viable tank classes and you can respec at the snap of your fingers for free. Still no tanks. It's a thankless job that people tend to shit on if it's done poorly. No one wants to do it.
---
Actually there is a horde town in duskwood called beggar’s haunt with quest givers! Not much of one though and there’s only like 2 quests. I’d hide out there if I needed to afk and reset after some (honorable pvp with equal leveled players in duskwood)
---
2 months ago I was against most changes but honestly a lot of shit could be added and not change much.
---
Dual Spec should be added for 1000g, Guild banks, and barbershop are the easy ones. I'll get flamed but I honestly think LFG (NOT LFR) should just be added. Yeah it was fun gathering people for a while but spamming LFG chat for 30 minutes only to find out you grouped with some boomer or generally horrible player sucks. It can easily kill 2 hours with 0 gain.
---
I don't think class balancing should be changed aside from boomkins. Every other class has at least some use aside from them.
---
Debuff slots would be good but it would also make warlocks #1 at PvP and PvE.
---
I basically just want Wrath of The Lich King QoL in the world of classic.
---
not me personally since i never played lock or pala, but to my buddy. he already hated the gcd block, but never felt 900g was worth it for that. after he got destroyed twice by a mage in AB, becoz he got locked on holy from mounting he quickly changed his mind. its not really that hard for the mage since counterspell has 30yd range. the warlock he made later on nost he didn't even bother with the epicmount quest.
---
G
---
A little advice to help you in the real world 
---
Don’t assume negative intent it makes you seem like a bitter old lady
---
You do realize you can configurate healbot to look exactly like you want? Disable frames you deem useless or bloaty?
---
Think that's the reputation bar, try disabling it
---
I REALLY like that alternative idea you’ve got there, feel like it meshes well with what I want out of classic
---
This, just reserve the first rightous orb. That's 30-50g a run depending on your server.
---
Damn this looks awesome! Wish I had a guild like that :D enjoy the raids!
---
I hate people and try to level during off hours so I have zoned to myself. 
---
Truthfully I enjoy seeing the occasional player on my journey but anymore than 2-5 per zone and I feel like we're competing for mobs too much, slows me down.
---
no because you said he forgot the reed and he didn't
---
You can't mention Stockades without mentioning Ragefire Chasm.
---
Nah it just falls flat.
---
FYI the census addon has been fixed. Two settings, when enabled, use mouse clicks in the ui and in the world to trigger the commands. I've been running the census addon for the last 2 weeks just fine. The data will slowly become more accurate as folks update their addon and start running it again.
---
i agree with you 100% its terrible
---
Simplest method would be to fight some mobs and then check your combat log. Alternately you could download an addon like Details! or Critline and check those after the fact.
---
This is new wow rules. Everyone I know and have seen so far is needing blue boe 
---
Don’t let the fascists sweaty from 15 years ago try to force their archaic views on things.
---
Need boe blues
---
Goodbye.
---
I hope that add voting stations similar to OSRS so I can have a say in what goes into classic. Cuz this is my new life’s work to do. Must train harder.....
---
Krol blade sucks, at least for 300g it sucks. 100g is very generous to spend for one too. Just get a blade of zeal or you can get a rivenspike off the rare in lbrs, spirestone butcher. Works in tandem with sunders. I want a dal rends MH but at this point I doubt Ill see one let alone win it should it drop.
---
Sounds like the whole Effective Health vs Avoidance discussion, where you have to have enough health to survive the biggest burst the boss can throw and long enough to be healed back up following that burst, and then avoidance (fire resistance in this case) is useful.
---
I'll have to see how much HP I have in my full fire res set. Might be worth it to fork up the gold for the Flask if I'm low.
---
Thanks for the insight!
---
Free mounts are the most noticable class imbalance when it comes to gold, but other classes get free stuff too:
---
Mages: free water
---
Druids: travel form 
---
Shamans: travel form
---
Hunter: travel aspect
---
Rogues: can turn invisible, quit complaining
---
Warriors: get fucked, in line with class theme
---
Can you remind me of BC's Dungeon finder? I don't remember it.
---
The same thing still happens in retail as well. An endgame zone that was added in the latest patch has a teleport to it from the main horde city, while alliance gets to fly. It's truly a balanced experience.
---
I see a big fan of addons
---
Yeah, I originally didn't think it was worth it, but doing the math, the amount of stam I can gain by using that buff instead of gearing for fire res makes it worth it, at least until we're more geared.
---
Um....hate to break it dude....once people get to end game content most of them just raidlog......its always been like that.
---
Might change a lot once the PvP trinket is released.
---
Right, I read that you should taunt after every Wrath, regardless if you're knocked back or not, to spare the poor melee.
---
Edit: I was thinking of Dual Wield fury against Rag, but I figured that his normal melee attacks were physical, and thus could be blocked and reduced by armor, so I was hesitant to do this.
---
sounds fun!!!!!!!!! X"D
---
Was doing Strat UD run with guildies and Krol Blade dropped. I dont think I would be able to win this in pug run. Thanks to guild run they all passed and now I have a good weapon and dont have to farm ubrs.
---
Of course, now I owe run for one of my guildies.
---
2 hand Fury ist totally a Thing. gonna Play that too if i got your weapon but i iam Horde and Windfury ist amazing.
---
Deasmines is cooler than wc
---
Right-click your chat tab, go down to General, then I'm guessing Global Channels(?) and press the red button next to the channel name.
---
Nothing will happen to you for simply joining the channel.
---
In vanilla everyone would ninja your boe 100% of the time if you were stupid enough to roll greed. I may sound clueless to you, but you actually are clueless
---
I never said they should cater to mine, I never said they should cater to yours, but 6 month phases because wageslaves like you can’t properly manage free time is foolish in a game that’s been solved for 15 years, regardless of what you think.
---
If you are a 60 running groups, use their utility.  They won't be able to grab aggro and even ret paladin heals will be enough to keep you going.
---
This happened to a guildie of mine! 100g node.
---
Ye sure bro ;)
---
Destiny 2 also ruined my wow group. &gt;:(
---
You miss the crappiest of all Horde zones most?
---
No, he HAS Spinal reaper, and when he was running molten core last week he said he has priority on BRE, someone asked him in chat.  As for getting Hand of Rag that's news to me.
---
karma :D
---
I played a classic paladin as holy for about 18 months, spent the last few months as ret before BC.
---
I was awful and casual but all I did was find people better than me and spam cleanse/freedom and heal them if I could. Didn't matter if I died or whatever, these warriors and locks would pop off and invite me back for bgs every time I was on. 
---
Moral of the story, find someone with good gear and tell them you want to pocket support them and eventually you'll have a list of people dying to play with you.
---
Source plx
---
Welp turns out I'm a dumbass 
---
xD thanks for the direction to Ott though. Fuck.
---
Yeah but travelling between continents with the Alliance travel system is a lot less convenient than the Horde equivalent. Zeppelin towers are right outside Org and UC (and *inside* Grom'gol) while Alliance players, who mostly spend time in Ironforge and Stormwind, have to fly to Menethil or Booty Bay to get to Kalimdor.
---
I thought that mobs had a flat 14% parry chance, regardless of weapon skill vs defense. Dodge is decreased by weapon skill, but only down to 5%. Therefore, even hit capped, while tanking a mob, it would have a 19% chance to avoid a hit, no matter how you geared. This would be consistent with how often I see parries (which are quite frequent in my experience) vs dodges (which do happen, but are fairly rare compared to parries).
---
There's an orc near a wheelbarrow for repairs in Hillsbrad I think
---
"SM is a short run from Hillsbrad."
---
Short? First you have to get to SS, which is a long run.  Then it's a long run, a long swim, and a long run through an enemy zone.
---
you dirty minmaxer, when would this ever happen?
---
Save it and follow the prices leading up to phase 3, which is where we get BGs, then sell it at an opportune time.
---
&gt;everyone one
---
Did you have a stroke? DO YOU NEED A LIFE-ALERT PENDANT?
---
Remember as a lock twink you'll have to get all your shards from PvP. Wouldn't recommend it.
---
But you guys have wonderful cities we have mud huts quit complaining...
---
Hahhaha this made me laugh so hard. Had a multiboxer be super rude to me the other day because I happened to be grinding “his mobs” and I was just thinking “wow this guy needs to get laid”
---
Winning a BoE on a NEED roll should auto bind it so you can’t sell.
---
Is there anything in any version of the game alliance players don't complain about?
---
Honestly the dungeon finder didn't really do much damage, people were already running the daily instances silently even before that.
---
They have a catch-all term they use in account warnings and bans for things like this - it’s called “zone disruption”. Pretty dumb IMO but it is what it is
---
I would ask the gnome what his spec was tbh, height not be running cookiecutter.
---
Those were asked by everyone and more or less needed. When your player base is divided between 3 continents and 90% of players are level max, finding a group for a dungeon during the 1-60 leveling was a fucking nightmare
---
true, the mods around classic announcement up to the demo fervently defended Tips, and the people on this subreddit.
---
I'm just stepping through the logic, mate.  Phases spread out the content and reduce workload on the devs.  Pushing a phase faster means all other content that isn't ready needs to be crunched out or released buggy.  I don't want to see C'thun or Nef with more bugs.  Do you?
---
They released the road map.  Whining that it's not fast enough is your problem.  Plenty of people are worried they will be left behind with a rapid release cycle.  When a significant portion of your players are 30-50, pushing the schedule puts them further and further behind.
---
Haha that's a good point =p
---
An afk UD warrior at the road in Winterspring was MC'd last time to a furblog camp. I swear that dwarf and his guildmate did not laugh at watching him die slowly from a Pathfinder's bow.
---
People seem stuck on pre-normalized abilities. 1.12 MS was a sad shadow of the original release 200% damage with the slow AP multiplier. We used to run around with The Nicker at it's 4.0 speed and annihilate people with WF. It was glorious but not good game design. 
---
Slower weapons are still slightly better but Sulthraze is a great weapon in 1.12 until you're getting UBRS gear.
---
This. I would much rather spend an hour queuing for one dungeon and actually have fun with it than que for 10 mins and get a lame boring speedrun.   
---
I feel like they could find a middle ground, some kind of role queing that doesn't just take you to the dungeon instantly. I love having to actually walk out to SM from Southshore, thank you.
---
I thought we were going to get some funny American EU banter instead we got some dude who doesn't know what he's doing with a cringy border around his camera.
---
How ironic, a post about azeroth being horde biased, by a person being alliance biased by picking and choosing which zones to include to make a point, hmm...
---
Another alliance-favored one is western plaguelands, where alliance has a town with inn and FP, whereas horde literally doesn't even have a single vendor in the area and has to run all the way from UC, which is half-accross tirisfal glades. The late game alliance convenience of BRD is also not mentioned, which arguably is more important since you'll run those dungeons tens or even hundreds of times compared to 1 to 5 times for leveling dungeons.
---
Lmao “dealt with by the community”. That never happens to ninjas no matter what people say about how things worked in vanilla. To have that happen the person needs to be a huge asshole and not just ninja every once in awhile.

I’ve made it pretty clearly I’m on about the distinctions being arbitrary and that you should talk about loot rules at the start of the run instead of just saying this is the way things should work after the items drop.
---
edit: to be clear I used the righteous orbs example because any argument people make against that should exactly match the arguments people make against all rolling need on boe epics, but it's a situation where the general consensus goes the other way. Thus it shows that the arguments for or against don't hold up in every situation and there's some line drawn in the sand that people have to agree on.
---
it's so toxic man. people are just mad here all the time lol
---
Probably not, unless they make the decision to allow let players purchase mounts/pets/etc on the game store. Ultimately it's a lot of work for them and probably not worth it financially just to keep players paying the monthly fee. Those employees could be focused on a new WoW expansion or some mobile game XD
---
~150g right now on high pop servers and will rise to probably 300g+ once WSG comes out
---
What phase are we in now? Is there a time frame or schedule for phase 3?
---
I think he's talking about getting to rfk for the vial? He may have mixed up swamp of sorrows with dustwallow
---
Imagine going up and down this thread being wrong and calling people "dum dums" like an actual child.
---
Get a clue
---
Darnassus’s location is just utter trash. You can’t fly anywhere useful without taking a 20 minute break; it’s even faster from SW or IF to get to most places in Kalimdor for endgame content.
---
This dudes getting angry you’re on his turf. It’s gotta be hard out there for a pimp.
---
Lol you shoulda pissed him off more and told him to get a real profession.
---
Sorry I didn't make you laugh, but that's not exactly my objective with this post.
---
This whiny little bitch sub is brimming with complaints that get upvoted to the top every single day, and people eat it up. The same rant every day. 
---
Then we get captain fuckwit who refuses to un-clench his jaw for a minute to laugh about it. "Nah it just falls flat" ok bud
---
100% agree. It's unfair. However I was just responding to a specific point OP made, not to the transportation systems as a whole.
---
No, not everyone is alliance.
---
C
---
SL should be giving you mana.
---
I did a respec and my mage class captain told me to put 10 points in arcane. World of a difference.
---
But we now know that it ruined the social aspect of the game, there must be a middle point that takes the best of both systems..
---
Now you have learned an invaluable lesson. They always call for more.
---
And let's talk about dungeons.  The Horde starts earlier than alliance does (12-13 for RFC instead of 17-18 for deadmines), easier access to SFK, BFD, Gnomeregan, RFK, RFD, and the most important mid-30's dungeons- SM GY, Library, Armory, and Cathedral.  Also quicker access to Maraudon, ST, and (I think) Dire Maul.  (My Alliance character isn't 60 yet, so not sure on DM, but it looks that way from the map.)
---
Ill trade you perception anyday for an aoe stun.
---
&gt;Prior to patch 1.8, the weapon damage used for *instant attacks* was:
---
&gt;damage = base_weapon_damage + (weapon_speed * Attack Power / 14)
---
It explicitly says that formula is for instant attacks, not white damage.
---
&gt;Before instant attacks were normalized in 1.8, Sul'Thraze would've been bad
---
You literally just made my point. We're in 1.12. It doesn't matter what's in 1.8 because that's not what we're playing.
---
This is exactly what I would want too. BC raids looked like fun as a l80 toon + dk was fun big time, I regret only using mine for farming (and some ganking here and there lol).
---
I don't give portals away for free, water/food I do. People generally tip though.
---
At the current phase we don't have access to the soulforge set which is a nice set of plate with spellpower, but there are some pieces of plate and mail around with spellpower. Would it be viable to combine them with the regular ret stuff out there at the moment?  Talking about pre raid stuff
---
Also, is Destiny a desireable weapon for horde 2 handed fury warriors? I got one for dirt cheap and I'm debating selling it on the neutral auction house - ive made a lot of money there in the past and curious if it'd be a good idea
---
Some people just wanna min max their pve and don't care for the fantasy aspect I guess
---
If you don't all need, you will be ninja'd against eventually. If you want to give someone their robe recipe or an item, trade it to them after your all need out of the goodness of your heart (and enjoy watching them hearth away without equipping it).  
---
There is no middle ground here, if you think all greed is reasonable it is simply a lack of experience talking.
---
They turk err jerbs!
---
Ouch! That really sucks! I think I've seen it drop twice in roughly the same amount of runs.
---
I picture all the people who talk about counterspelling mounts as just mounting up and running away first thing when they see world pvp
---
Phase 1. No, there is no schedule for the release of the phases.
---
As alliance STV is my favorite questing zone in the game.
---
...hinterlands utterly blows though. Wtf were they doing with that?
---
the quick offhand is good come TBC, where u get a talent which makes ur OH hits have a chance to give energy back. If you're lvl 35+ and you're 5/5 sword spec, its much stronger to be with 2 swords cuz of the extra attack procs.
---
Im not saying get a quick MH and slow OH...the MH should still be slower(higher damage range), but a 2.2 sword in OH is much better than a 1.3 dagger with swordspec.
---
Check the warrior discord by the way, I believe its called Fight Club and those guys know everything from the Warrior class!
---
What quest is that?
---
I laffed :&gt;
---
It used to be good. 
---
McCafe is way better!
---
Safer as well
---
Do we really want the current retail devs fiddling with classic?
---
Imagine believing you are correct and not even trying to prove your thoughts. I explained how the need and greed buttons should be handled by the player now ofc you are free to do whatever you like. Have fun!
---
They could put an LFG in that didn’t auto teleport you. That would be ideal. That’s the problem people had.
---
Not really cool but it is permanent, the pumpkin 16 slot bag. Drops from any lvl 50+ undead mobs.
---
You sir seem like a bot with all this information
---
I do wonder then why all the best Speedlevelers prefer Alliance.. Oh yes, unlike you they actually know the game.
---
Could u explain?
---
Poor dwarves snd gnomes with their poor crummy legs. They have to take double steps for every other race haha
---
That sounds like a good compromise
---
Reminds me of when a power outage DC'd our MT (also raid leader) and OT (his brother), just a minute or so after pulling Onyxia.  
---
We had to get creative real quick.
---
You get stats from your melee weapon even if it's completely unskilled
---
I much prefer the Alliance cities from an aesthetic point of view and their starter levelling zones are SO much better. My first 10-15 levels as Horde are terribly boring whereas Ally feels so much better. I LOVE questing in Duskwood too.
---
when i equip an item with +2% dodge, i only gain like around +1.7%. Is that normal?
---
I ended up making an extra 600 water and gave it all away infront of him hahaha!
---
Classic+ would be great, but there are huge hurdles to overcome that make it virtually guaranteed that it won't happen.
---
First and foremost is money. BC is already developed. Takes very little money to release it on some servers, and make tons of money while spending little. Classic+ would cost a lot of money in development, and no matter how they went about it, some of the fanbase would be upset, while if they keep BC on separate servers from classic, they won't upset that many people.
---
Second, there are balance issues. Naxx gear already makes the game fairly difficult to keep balanced (warriors start to have infinite rage, making their dps lead even more absurd). I don't know how all the classes work out in there, but some scale too well while others scale very poorly. BC fixed a lot of these issues, but part of the fix was the raising of the level cap. If Classic+ didn't change the game mechanics significantly, the game just wouldn't be that fun, and if you're going to change the game mechanics a ton, is it still Classic?
---
Its becuase 5 IQ mouth breathers play stinky tuarens and dirty orcs
---
they wouldnt be able to figure out how to lvl otherwise.
---
Oh boo boo y’all have a hard time getting to Blackrock Mountain.  Meanwhile y’all are right next to ZG Ony AQ and Naxx.
---
Sorry, but you can't call deadmines an advantage when the wailing caverns with its 7 quests and high quality loot exists. 
---
Horde also has RFC and its handful of quests. 
---
Horde also has RFK, RFD, (no barrens town or FPs for alliance, they have to go to booty and boat to ratchet and walk, or go to menethil, boat to theramore, and walk through skulled mobs)  and a much more convenient flight path to BFD, all of which the horde quests are far better than the alliance ones, or are the same. 
---
There are no alliance flight points in the same zone as Sunken Temple, and the horde flight to Dire Maul is minutes closer than the alliance one.
---
Stockades also has literally no boss loot (except one rare who has a VERY LOW spawn rate), where at least RFC has reliable items from the named mobs, so there's that.
---
Don’t forget almighty feline swiftness
---
have you seen human and dwarf faces?
---
If they release a raid with a bug time-gating the content further along is not going to make them fix it. 
---
Just like how Onyxia’s third phase is STILL bugged, retail players, Classic or BFA, are always ActiBlizzard beta testers in 2019.
---
Stop making excuses for an incompetent corporation to suck away more money from its userbase, six month phases are absolutely foolish especially when it includes HALF of the games content locked behind it in PVP.
---
Faster hits and smaller hits give the same rage per second, you just get it more smoothly with faster hits. It feels nice but it's not really a damage increase, just a quality of life improvement. 
---
Slower weapon speed is equal to higher weapon speed in damage until you start getting meaningful ways to deal damage aside from auto attacks; the extra damage range affects and improves damage from moves like mortal strike. 
---
One other way slow weapon speed helps out is with the current dual wielding heroic strike bug. If your main hand is slower you can get more off hand hits in per heroic strike cancellation which helps lower the micromanaging.
---
All need was regular 15 years ago too. It didn't take long for anyone who thought greeding was ok back then to watch things ninja'd away.
---
It's not sweaty vanilla players, it's clueless new players who think we should be rolling greed.
---
Vuhfo will show incoming heals correctly since the last patch, they fixed it
---
Horrendous. I don't get half of the changes they make. The garen buff blows my mind, and the Nerf to that buff is a joke. Lol
---
Excellent thanks brotha
---
Horde has better reach and movement, that's true but saying leveling experience favors Horde is bullshit. I feel like you just got bored of sucking horde dick and came here to cry about it. So much of your examples are pure bs. How about you talk about duskwod, redridge and wetlands while stop crying about stonetalon and 1k needles (which actually used by alliance in some way while former are only ally zones with no horde quests)
---
Eggs
---
Ah then I stand corrected. Am a new player. Seen a 30ishg blue boe be ninjad and started following and stating during runs need on blue boe
---
Better wash his beck
---
Lol as if it compares, and it ain’t free if it costs time.
---
And yet people still think you need defense to tank.
---
Did you miss the part where he said he has leveled both factions?
---
Classic+ would be separated from classic.
---
It doesn't matter what the icon is for the two rolls.
---
The simple fact is that if you roll greed you will be the victim of a ninja. Take the control into your hands instead of being a passive victim.
---
As well, I am telling you with full certainty this is how it was handled 15 years ago. Full stop.
---
You are wrong on every account, and behaving like a child.
---
Have fun!
---
I made a guy 120 waters he tipped 5g... I feel like he ripped himself off
---
Just report him.
---
For all the complaints about the later expansions. Especially cata and beyond. The quest experience is arguably a lot better as the game went on. The cata revamp of the old world was honestly a blast to play through on the alliance side(just recently did a loremastee run). Haven’t touched the horde side yet. So many areas that arguably were underdeveloped in vanilla were fleshed out in very realistic and understandable ways. The expansion of dwarven and human interests in kalimdoor from theramore. The escalation of the war for Lordaeron and northern kalimdoor. Expanded outposts and bases. Shifting control of the lands in believe able struggles. 
---
It really does make the vanilla experience seem a bit amateurish in comparison when it comes to balance and the thought put into it. 
---
This is by no means the fault of the original devs. Just a matter of experience and years of trial and error. My perfect wow experience would have the modern world building and quest structure with the more in depth rpg elements of the original wow trilogy. 
---
It’s why I hope that the next expansion takes cues from classic to move back in that direction of rpg mechanics while still keeping many of the improvements the series has gained over the years.
---
I believe that Sulfuras has a horde advantage. However the alliance is very active and can organize quickly. I'm not sure how that will play out in p2 when there's more incentive for open world PvP, but for p1 Sulfuras is probably a good option.
---
DO IT
---
You could run Shadowfang Keep, for a chance to get the twink weapons and sell them on the ah (Shadowfang sword, assasins blade etc). Is a linear dungeon and not that far from undercity.
---
So you’re gonna hang out in goldshire? May the earthmother have mercy on your soul
---
Good bot
---
Being able to Interact in a druid form to vendors, banks, etc. Right now can only loot and skin lol
---
I agree. BC was my favorite, because classes still felt different, the raids and dungeons were difficult (I loved heroic versions of dungeons that would kick your ass when you first tried them). Wrath was a lot of fun: the leveling experience was great, the dungeons and raids were a TON of fun, but it was where "all specs will be equally viable" and "balance at the cost of fun" started to creep in. It wasn't that bad yet, but it was the beginning of the end. Dungeon finder was not the worst, but I would prefer Wrath without it. The Raid Finder that came in Cata was awful.
---
&gt; the racials are good for humans if you want to pve
---
Welcome to Ghostcrawler. Make something OP then nerf it into the ground, and keep mages weak for some reason.
---
You make more money giving it away for free. People are way more likely to tip you well. If other mages don't like it, they can go somewhere else.
---
And forgot to make the ground floor of the inn grant rested status :D
---
No changes, no +.
---
Joana played horde
---
Alliance consistently has the guilds with the earliest server first MC clears for a reason. The leveling is faster for alliance in general.
---
Tbh I have only seen all need rules on boe epics, blues aren't valuable enough to care about (maybe shadowfang after bgs are released but that's about it)
---
Man but Jailbreak with a party of 60s is SOOOO impossible! Way harder than 3 UBRS runs and the absolute hell that is test of skulls! /s
---
Lol, you looked at my comment history??  Such a gentleman.  But want to know something buddy?  You’re disagreeing with my logic and you can’t handle it so you’re bowing out - something you claimed I did.  Hypocrisy is really so incredibly amusing 😭 Thanks for the laugh
---
Inside server LFG.
---
Can you tell me your spots for farming the 10 essences each? I was thinking burnings steppes for earth elementals but dont know about others
---
I think level 1 Enchanting can DE anything.
---
Or maybe start speaking german on a german server....
---
i do this all the time when im bored
---
I mean they didn’t have to do that. I’m pretty sure many more people did it with smaller raids at 70. And if they left it alone, I could have soloed it at 80 or 85 and gotten a corrupted Ashbringer dammit.
---
Is not a constructive comment
---
Yeah. The longer I’m awake the more I think I’m just in a bad mood today and it got under my skin. But you’re the only person who gave a differing opinion without telling me I’m wrong. So kudos for that
---
This. As retail progressed with changes to make things faster for players, one of them was making leveling more of a “finish a zone and move to the next”, to help limit travel time. This is in contrast to how WoW started (and now Classic) by making you go back and forth across zones, often having on-level quests active in multiple zones at a time.
---
How does depression taste and what did you do to piss off god?
---
I much preferred the TBC LFG tool. It allowed people to advertise they were LFG but still required socializing and often you'd split your time between that tool and Trade.
---
Find one that’s AFK
---
... On a PvP server.
---
I've always gravitated towards rp servers.
---
Is there frequent fighting at BlackRock mountain?
---
Horde even has a quest in Redridge.
---
The fact that Feathermoon Village in Feralas is out on an island sums up the alliance questing experience. You have to swim for three minutes just to get to the mainland and do your quests
---
Hi!
---
It'll hit everybody in close. The melee's got to clear out when the UI mod says to, and the MT has to either resist it or the OT's gotta get in immediately or Rag starts roflcoptering casters.
---
My personal best path forward would be to implement the TBC mechanics but skip Outland and go directly to Northrend.  It seems more logical to chase down Arthas after Naxx was the pinnacle raid in classic.
---
But that's probably a boat load of work.
---
Found the crybaby PVE nerd
---
Lol you are so hostile. Is there a reason for that? Or are you just a genuinely angry person?
---
Lol cone of cold before frost nova is pretty standard? It isn’t for the slow. It’s for the instant cast damage before you lock them in place to put some distance between you so you don’t get whacked and interrupted. Maybe you’re the one that’s just bad...
---
noobs
---
Same ruling in Vanilla. This wasn’t allowed.
---
How did you feel after you rolled 100 on the "Orb of Deception" and still lost?
---
Some of my friends only have an 1 hour per day to play, i knew it was gonna happen but i play mostly alone now but honestly i enjoy it much more than grouping.
---
I just like questing alone, i hate the quests where you both need a certain amount of drop and its a crap drop chance % making the quest take double as long to complete.
---
Dont fret m8, enjoy the world and zones, work on your character, and theres always ppl to find if you need a group.
---
i am level 46 and my azeroth auto pilot just bug too it makes me do a quest called alliance relation and its just a greys quest and once its done it doesnt  ask me to do anything i dont quite understand. note that i only dl the addons at this level
---
Makes me angry
---
I think a lot of the decisions are lore focused. The horde is comprised of 2 nomadic tribes and 2 kingdom cultures that wish to expand whilst the alliance is made of 4 well established kingdom-cultures which of them 2 are ancient, and 2 focus of expanding through technology. It isn’t fair, but it makes sense when you see that a troll/orc/Tauren base could be packed up and disappear in less then a day while the humans want to build a massive castle to claim the land as their own for the rest of their life.
---
Until ZG, yes then we have access to turtle!
---
Now my monitor looks tiny 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
if you’re going to do SM, you should grab the chillwind camp flight point and run from there. way faster than through silverpine starting at southshore, but it does include a corpse run due to the mobs in your way at wpl.
---
I tried saying this would happen on the Lol reddit when they hired him but I got ignored/downvoted.
---
Pew pew!
---
thanks. so i shouldnt get crit items ill just stack hit, thanks again for ur help
---
Are you replacing something with agility when you equip it?
---
Nope. They bowed and didn't attack me again lol
---
lol this stuff cracks me up. even when it happens to me. 
---
I swear the other day I got distracted while auto running, I came back to my PC on the way other side of the map
---
Rare? It’s 20% chance haha
---
meanwhile on Fairbanks.. a friend and I LFM’d for another person to help do the Pyrewood Village elite quests in Silverpine.  One person joined then immediately quit party after one death.
---
cheese
---
won an ony bag /roll vs 39 people in a pug
---
Deadmines?
---
The only bop enchant I'm aware of is the trinket from BRD, which is only a side-grade for tanks. Drop ench whenever you want!
---
Having fun done both, it seems like you're honestly cherry picking a bit. Also, you exclude "100% alliance zones" but that's unfair, you have to consider those if we're talking total quest experience.
---
 Just because a zone has a tiny amount of ally or neutral quests in it doesn't mean it's not intended to be largely for the horde and a substitute for an alliance counterpart. I.e. bringing up stonetalon and pretending its supposed to be for both factions but then not bringing up redridge, wetlands or duskwood to counter that is laughable.
---
&gt; Also, is Destiny a desireable weapon for horde 2 handed fury warriors? I got one for dirt cheap and I'm debating selling it on the neutral auction house - ive made a lot of money there in the past and curious if it'd be a good idea
---
Even though it's pretty fast I'm sure someone will want it. I'd think the demand would be on the Alliance side though since it is a sword.
---
lmao
---
This. Currently using addons which try to work somewhat as you described &amp; it hasn’t really affected anything other than that I get grouped up quicker than I used to. Social aspect etc are the same. Teleporting you instantly would definitely ruin things though!
---
HoJ dropped during a Jailbreak run, where the group decided to dip to Golem first because I needed the previous stage of the quest. 
---
We wound up turning the run into a full clear, got my MC attune, hit 56, did nearly every other step of the Ony attune, and ran DM:E with them as well. Lovely group of people, wish it didnt take us to 3am or I'd have done more runs with them.
---
OP needs to post numbers, not feels.
---
His post about Dustwallow Marsh threw me off. That zone has so few quests for Horde.
---
Alliance as 12 quests and Horde has 10 and there are 6 neutral quests.
---
OPs "horde biased" crying needs to go back to r/wow where it belongs.
---
Get that diaper changing bullshit out of here.
---
Is... is that a player next to him..?
---
Where do I turn in the kharan mighthammer quest? I'm using questie and I can't find the npc to turn it in
---
NEED KEY
---
I’m doing tailoring and enchanting. Seems like it fits in terms of RP using magic and all but also you craft clothes you can wear as well as enchant and sell.
---
One of the best necks for tanking is the one from Onyxia head turn in, as threat generation is more of a problem than mitigation. Some dps pieces are amazing for threat and allowing a tank to respec fury/prot for better threat once at soft hit cap and at 20% crit.
---
 'Skolde' actually translates to "Take it Off"
---
I dont want more downvotes to describe what i honestly did. But i got about 25 gold.
---
I copy and pasted my beg message (which i only asked people for a gold or two because i said i wad close to the amount). I got so carried away with the spamming that sometimes people would message me "youve messaged me 3 times now and i already gave you gold the first time".
---
As i said, it was shameful.

You should either go imp blizzard and farm with blizzard, or imp AE and farm with that+CoC (or imp flamestrike and farm with that+CoC). Also as the other guy said you want Cold Snap and you also definitely want elemental precision, in fact you don't need any points in imp frostbolt if your only going to be farming.
---
Wrong.
---
People dress up/use graphics to their advantage or log in at a commonly-clicked spot in the PvP zone of the game in order to trick players into “skulling” (PvP aura that means you lose all items on death)
---
You use souls as batteries...
---
Westfall - like leaving Oz to go adventuring in Kansas
---
/r/woooosh
---
You are correct. Horde stuff was rushed hence why horde zones have a lot of open zones which fit with lore BUT also have a lot leas small detail compared to ally.
---
Hmm maybe dungeon finder for old content? Like when BC comes out use dungeon finder for 1-60, then when wrath comes out dungeon finder for BC. Keep the relevant content the old way
---
It was my first toon. At the time it was the most efficient way i had made gold at that time.
---
I havnt done this again btw.
---
Zygor is a paid product really well done
---
Wait, Alliance have a separate flight path in BB?
---
You could look into [https://github.com/danreeves/discord-speech-to-text-bot](https://github.com/danreeves/discord-speech-to-text-bot). Not sure how good it is, but surely there are similar solutions out there?
---
Oh perfect then 👍
---
What do you mean too early? Are you saying it's wrong to talk about what comes after classic before a certain time? I don't understand what this means. People should talk about whatever they want to talk about whenever they feel like it unless doing so is harmful. I don't see why talking about classic+ would be harmful? I don't really understand what you're trying to say.
---
FAP
---
Elvui, its a whole package with lots of cool stuff
---
I agree, the lfg tool can be fine, just don't automate it, but having an interface to search for groups is good to me, the lfg channel is so busy it's hard to read anything on there, I'd love an interface to filter dungeons.
---
I'm lvl 49 and my servers lfg is just spammed with lvl 60 content, I'd love to be able to filter that out and just see groups my level range
---
This is a statement I can get behind.
---
Pathetic Tier pieces LMAO
---
I have a feeling this guy only has SALT water to offer anyway.
---
Where’s the inn? The bulwark exists and is basically better positioned then chillwind since for chillwind you have to run around Andorhal
---
I am deaf.
---
I am Guild Master with few good friends I raided together in the past time. My raiding guild have more than 35 deaf players in the guild and 15 active deaf raiders currently. 
---
We don't have any issues to make our MC &amp; Onyxia clear weekly (Actually on 1 raidnight only). It's possible to be prepared for everything before a raid starts. You are welcome to ask me for more information. I have experience as GM in a Naxx raiding guild aswell, so its not really an issue when you know what to do and be prepared for tactics.
---
I don't have to use scatter at all, it's a nice emergency thing though. I'm running with a 20/31/0 build and still solo them just fine. Just gotta FD a little sooner on Gordok than expected, but if it is resisted you can salvage it still.
---
do horde get killed less by alliance guards? i think thats my number 1 cause of death, i only play alliance so i dont know how it is for horde. i thought it was weird that there seemed to be a horde outpost every 20 feet in every contested zone with guards constantly chasing me
---
There is no repair for Alliance in South Shore -- Allies do have to repair at the wandering merchant.
---
Yeah he failed to mention ANY alliance-favored zones...  We get it, you like Nightelves, but be a bit fairer in your judgement.
---
Ah, alright. Thanks for the refresher.
---
At that price, I'll just buy from the vendor. No need to inflate a mages ego anymore.
---
To be fair mana biscuits (argent dawn rep - friendly req) cost 60s for a stack of 5. People should be at the very lease be giving some sort a tip if you’re giving them several stacks.
---
aesthetics as well, horde towns are just mud huts, alliance towns look like actual cities
---
If my item does not sell in the AH, do I get the deposit back or do I lose it?
---
Ret and enhancement shaman here. It was nuts lol.
---
This makes absolutely zero sense.
---
Engineering is NOT that expensive right now, especially for mages who can farm ZF and DME as early as 52. On Herod-H it's about 30-40g to get to 175 for grenades and another 100-150g to get to 300.
---
And the phasing and the pushing of daily quests as a regular game mechanic.
---
There was a lot to love about WotLK but looking back a lot of the elements that hindered future expansions were already there.
---
Farm materials/gold, run guildies through dungeons for pre BiS, level alts
---
Try to find a guild that can work with your schedule I'd say, probably more likely to get gear then especially if theres duplicates down the line that the people would already then have.
---
Eh the game really only starts at STV, at which point Horde have it way easier with FPs and quest hubs.  Alliance quests literally send you across the world constantly to fulfill the storyline, while Horde quests are mostly “go kill a bunch of X near here.”
---
The fast speed works very nice with paladins - lots of procs, especially if you put fiery or lifestealing and pair it with SoR. Throw crusader on it to get massive SoC procs.

The reason I asked about horde two handed fury is because bloodthirst just functions off of attack power so the fast speed isn't detrimental. Whirlwind won't hit as hard though. But you'll get lots of heroic strikes. To me it looks like an awesome option for horde fury warriors, but I don't know enough about horde fury warriors to tell if it's a good option.
---
deadmines, stockades sort of evens out with wailing caverns and ragefire chasm
---
Seems like but it was actually my Sprite Darter pet flying faster than the gryphon !
---
What ruined the social aspect of the game was constant expansions (giving more and more space to people, making them drifting apart), lack of elite quests (so you don't need others), sharding (so you are separated by others who advanced further than you on the "main story" of the area) and gear treadmill (making everything you did X months ago irrelevant) based on immediate rewards (everything need to be done in short time, so you don't need others for long), useless crafting items (so what the others can create is irrelevant), flying mounts (so you don't meet anyone on the ground, including the opposite faction, neutering world pvp) and everything happening in a same hub acting as a lobby (don't need to travel around the world)
---
LFG was a consequence, not a cause.
---
I just found out warlocks can use swords when someone shouted at me that the sword that drops in Mauradon was BIS for me (was level 47). Really glad they mentioned it or I would have hit greed on the roll
---
Ya well horde also have SM the most farmed instance by everyone so this argument isnt compable at all. I see the whole oh ally have 3 instances that horde dont need! Well so do ally with ragefire, wailing caverns, and SFK YET you also have the most useful instance right outside the main doorstep of a popular city so again no where near a fair comparison.
---
These people are paying all that money, for all those chars. They already lost.
---
Solved game, and yet you still see so many warriors running around with 300 weapon skill 😂
---
Who tf takes money for water?
---
This is the absolute smallest acceptable tip. I usually give 25-50g.

Sincerely, Not A Mage.
---
Some bandits are causing problems in northshire - somenfuckery about a mine or three, kobolds are involved somehow. Onwards to westfall. Wtf are these golems? Seems this is bigger than just some road side bandits. Much bigger... the (corrupt) nobility is refusing to five aid to he militia in westfall, but somehow you mange to pull through. Into the deadmines and you start to realise the scope of the problem. Can almost call it a revolt.
---
You go to redridge, problems with gnolls and orcs, they too get left hanging by the nobles of stormwind. Dark hire has worgen and undead problems and cant help westfall or redridge. Then you end up deling with a defias dude in the stormwind keep, yes this is the defias brotherhood. (Also this is a very quick and dirty summary written on my phone)
---
That is part 1. Part 2 is called "the missing diplomat" but i dont really want to spoil that without you asking me to. :) 
---
And part 3... Yeah we got a 1-60 theme for human zones. Split into 3 parts.

Of course you don't understand. I am sure you didn't understand Allen Brack  either.

Can you connect this guild to this subreddit?

When you're not grouping with then and need it to farm

yes, it's the same system as Guild Wars 2 and it work wonder.

Nope, bosses have 14% (3 levels higher than you)

For whatever reason.
---
You are such a noob. Who willingly loses gold on purpose and fucks over your class?
---
What the fuck is wrong with you? Grow the fuck up, stop trolling people.
---
I mean alliance definitely has the superior city location for all endgame stuff
---
I mean it's easy to avoid it as undead. But you should visit anyways to pick up flight points for later.
---
Don't apologize, it's justified.
---
I would argue that UC is far from the main horde hub, though. While to my understanding IF is the main Alliance hub. So add in the zepp from Org to your calculations. Probably still a touch faster for horde, but makes it much, much closer.
---
If the item does **not** sell you lose the deposit.
---
If the item sells you get the deposit back, but the AH takes a cut of the sale value (5%)
---
The thing is that to reach level 30 you need like 20 hours of played, but for 30-60 you need like 150...
---
Lol if you’ve ever played alliance you know nobody does stockades. But let’s not mention RC/WC/SFK while we’re at it.  
---
And the teleport is in Booty Bay.
---
It’s literally the backstab ‘moving lines’ animation except white, you’ll know when you see it
---
Not even the same water though
---
That's not my point. You couldn't do that shit to people with gladiator gear.
---
As a fellow bear tank, I don’t take stuff for offspec unless absolutely no one needs it for themselves. And I let the group know why I’m needing it. If you are going to be rolling on the gear regardless, just be up front about your intentions when you join the group.
---
Don't you just hit drain soul right before they drop? Is it really that big of a deal?
---
Pressing F but holding W to move forward
---
Plus HoJ which is another 2%. Plus, at an infinitesimally small chance, the extra swings can proc additional extra swings...or so I've been told.
---
Chance on hit procs from daggers are considered low priority debuffs so it's safe to use them in raids
---
You never leave black rock.
---
You’re right, excellent explanation
---
I appreciate a well timed smart ass remark but this is not one of them.  No shit, skinning is not leatherworking but since you mention two professions in your OP discussing money making it only makes sense for me to mention two as well.  Furthermore, of course LW alone is not going to be good for money making since it's heavily reliant on access to, you know, leather...
---
&gt; Gnomeregan
---
This confuses me since I've only played Horde a few times throughout the years, but how do they have an easier time getting to Gnomeregan than Alliance when Ironforge is just down the road? Just legitimately curious and wondering because I don't know how/why people are saying Horde can get there easier than Alliance.
---
That has never happened to me in all of getting my bis from BRD.
---
I mean mage tier is pretty awful, if he's wearing a lot of tier it speaks to inexperience, but yeah that guy is being a tool.
---
BUT hORdE havE It So GoOD tHOUGH
---
Oof
---
my biggest problem with dungeon finder is simply that it doesnt require you to actually travel to the instance portals in order to get to dungeons. 
---
imo that's the biggest thing that sucked the fun out of retail wow for me. the feeling that dungeons and raids were disconnected from the world. and the world started feeling less like a giant epic fantasy world that you could explore and more like just a menu you opened up to join queues in while sitting in the capital city doing nothing.
---
I'm not even a big fan of battlemasters, despite them being in vanilla. I think actually having  to go to battleground instance portals was a good idea, no matter how inconvenient it was.
---
I’ve done this a few times but always told the group I’ll be needing on other specs gear right at the beginning and nobody has had an issue with it.
---
LOLOLOLOlXD GIVE ME FREE PORT TOOOOOO
---
A large portion of alliance quests are courier quests. It sucks
---
Dual-Wield Fury Tank
---
I really really really want Classic+ to be a thing. It would be amazing, just like OSRS
---
29 Days /played on my main, I have two alts in the 30s tho
---
Lol the one comment in here that all the Horde will get behind.
---
guidelime
---
You seemed to have forgotten, or perhaps didn't notice, that a lot of quests come from outside of a zone for Alliance.
---
Also I'd say Horde have a crappily placed town in Badlands, just as bad as Alliance needing to run from Loch Modan.
---
Really close to Mara entrance and also shellfish farm
---
Yeah the post is hilariously biased. What is the point? Does he really think Blizzard is going to change it or something?
---
Add an NPC are you crazy??? #NOCHANGES
---
I don't typically lurk WoW forums so sorry if this is obvious to everyone else, but I'm curious what the case is against flying mounts? I enjoyed them a lot as a dweeby 13-year-old many many moons ago, and never questioned them because I was young.
---
Is that the only thing I would be making?
---
Wetlands has several quests that you can progress nearly all across the zone, meaning they’re meant to be what you grind on your way to and from menethil. You aren’t always meant to accept quest &gt; complete quest &gt; turn in quest, and this goes for both classic and retail wow.
---
Only 3 piece tier 1, helm, chest &amp; belt. The rest is pre-bis and the spell power ring from MC.
---
The optimal spec is probably 12/22/17 for imp res and pack, scatter and imp fd.  Entrapment can help with bugs and dogs but isn't necessary.    Once you learn the runs, you prob don't need, bit while learning, this will give you the most tools.
---
You don't get it. If you disregard all alliance favored zones, then there is a really clear horde bias. Wake up, sheeple!
---
Yeah I forgot all about Zygor!
---

---
&gt; It's like warlock was designed to be horde exclusive class
---
They actually were. And if I recall correctly, Druids were supposed to be Alliance only to balance it out, but the developers decided against it.
---
lol if you think thats long enough to need a tl;dr you havnt read a normal post from me. THAT IS the tl;dr
---
This is a shortcut if, like me, your primary interest in Arathi is the first aid book guy.
---
But there’s enough content to level up just on alliance kalimdor quests?
---
You can start AoE grdining at 22 at Wetlands in Gnolls. Look up Jokerd mage AOE guide. Good shit. Fire is faster damage to level until 22+ then you respect for AOE.
---
You think AQ is far away on the opposite side of Kalmidor? My guy it’s the opposite side of the damned planet for us.  Naxx is a 8 min flight from IF and to get to ZG we have to run all the way from Duskwood.
---
You are a ninja, plain in simple. In Path of Exile the loot system is nothing like Wow. Shit drops on the ground and you pick it up, and if your play FFA in poe (Which most people don't, they play perm allo) to the quickest fingers go the spoils. Not the case for Wow, I don't get what's confusing about this still. If you don't NEED it don't roll need. Like no shit.
---
I use an application on macOS to disable retina. So your laptop is just running at 1680x1050 instead of twice that. This way WoW can run perfectly fine
---
This is why, in BC, they add more Alliance quests and other stuff for a better Alliance questing experience. They add a flight point to the Rebel camp in northern STV, and they add a bunch of Alliance quests to Theramore/Dustwallow Marsh. There's probably more that I'm not aware of.  It's quite barren of any Alliance quests in vanilla despite the coolness of Theramore as a city and its role as de facto capital of the Alliance in Kalimdor (kek @ Darnassus)
---
If your in town wearing a tier set. I assume it is mostly for the look. If you are in the wild in one. I assume inexperience. Or you just don’t give a shit about the meta.
---
Is a skinning knife with 30 spell power enchant good for a lvl 30 lock? Will i replace it quickly or will it last a long time?
---
I'm leveling a warlock at the moment and I was wondering which of the Shadowweave equipment is worth getting. Anyone an idea?
---
expose armor is practically useless though
---
The only ones that can afford that are other mages and nelf females.
---
yep
---
[i like yuo frens](https://i.imgur.com/QYSiJ6R.jpg)
---
Your choice of city! Hahaha.
---
Maybe it would be good idea to give Classic some further polish in this aspect. Call it "Classic Extra" and finish original WoW bit truer to original vision. Cause, why not.
---
If I had to guess, it’s because some people enjoy this. It’s a computer game, so you’re bound to find some people who think playing is, ya know, fun.
---
I wonder how many will fall for it...
---
no. not eastern kingdoms solo either (which I'm currently lvl 58 in).
---
solo continent leveling requires grinding at a few points. even on eastern kingdoms only I had to grind an entire level at one point in my 40s.
---
&gt; the insane faction imbalance blood elves caused ruined the game.
---
Could you elaborate a bit about this please ?
---
I started playing at the beginning of TBC and I don't remember feeling that imbalance you are talking about.
---
My understanding is that's only true when you move onto terrain where you aren't supposed to be like roofs or such.
---
*song begins*.

...entitled maaaaages, entitled maaaages...’.

Just joshin you :D if someone offered me that much to pick a box I might hit them with a ‘you sure?’, but I’d take it.
---
But oh man was world good
---
Alright, I'll wait until SM with dungeon cleaving then, thanks :)
---
Play as a DPS warrior, but collect tank gear.
---
You won't get to be a main tank in raids, and dungeon tanking can be done in a DPS spec.
---
Tanking well is the toughest role. DPS is easiest. Go hunter.
---
Can't say as I don't use Bagnon. I just use [Auctionator](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24958-AuctionatorClassicquickfix.html) (not Auctioneer!) which can be used to add vendor, auction and disenchant prices to any item tooltip. It allows you to pick the highest value quest reward just by howevring over the items in the quest log. As a bonus it's a massive quality of life improvement for the AH without having 1001 different options like Auctioneer.
---
Other than that there is also a standalone addon just for [vendor prices](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24922-VendorPrice.html).
---
Hey at least you’ve got solidarity with another party member.
---
I disagree with this on so many premises, just about the only time I agree with tipping is finding a mage and having him stop doing what they were doing to make you water. Charging money for a conjure item is insane when it's a short cast and mana. You wanna charge for portals? Fine that takes reagents. But shit that costs you nothing to make is absurd to me. I don't charge melee for wind fury totems or casters for mana tide. Shit I don't charge to heal or cleanse either because it's just expected of me because of the class I rolled.
---
There are two horde towns in Desolace. One is right in the middle of the zone.
---
Wasting your breath.
---
What about the contested zones that have very little Horde quests? Wetlands, Redridge, and Duskwood?
---
Horde bias? In WoW?!
---
It's literally always been this way and continues in current WoW. It sucks playing second fiddle, but that's how it goes.
---
I just leveled from 30-38 almost entirely in SM. It’s baaaad for Alliance. The distance alone is a pain in the ass without even taking into consideration the level 60’s who decide to purposefully try to ruin everyone’s day by camping the dungeon entrance
---
Damn dude you cracked the code, better get the word out!
---
pretty sure you hit with both off the bat
---
True, but stockades is a level bracket above RFC, making it inherently more valuable.
---
It's not ninja-ing if everyone agrees to the rules beforehand.
---
Use your fingers people. Quick blurb at the start of pugs solves this issue.
---
feels good man
---
You don't have to play the game.  It's not your game.  Either accept the that Blizzard has a release cycle that people like or go to a private server.
---
22 because of 3 points in imp. blizzard? Thanks for the input :)
---
I'd transmog it into frayed robes if I could - what else am I meant to wear? It's literally BiS lol.
---
I didn’t, it’s still up. But dude, the games been out for 2 months and you’ve leveled 2 characters to 60. Complete BiS in all slots, and leveled up all professions. You completely no-lifed it and you’re complaining that Blizzard won’t cater to you. Now you’re already progressing through a different video game. Sounds like gaming is the main priority in your life, which is fine but not reality for 99.9% of the playerbase.
---
The fact that someone has a job and life outside Azeroth is so foreign to you (utilizing sarcastic quotes) says a lot. Take a fucking break and stop bitching that you’re not treated like a princess.
---
I love the simple quests in this game tbh. There’s fun in the simplicity imo.
---
Glad I’m not the only one who was flabbergasted by that statement
---
Not the last one, there's dreadmaw too.
---
There’s a safe spot that people can use in front of the vendor for Rune Cloth Bags.
---
This wouldn’t be an issue, but the pattern is a rare spawn, so it could be between 30 minutes to 3 hours of standing in the same spot in order to acquire the pattern, assuming there is no competition for it (which there always is).
---
Places like this you can’t simply walk away from.
---
On top of the cage in the center of Gadgetzhan is another. You have to duck into every building just to avoid being frost bolted. God forbid you want to smelt some ore or check the mailbox without being sniped.
---
Yep! ;)
---
Gehennas is your best bet.
---
All of them! Are you a tailor ? If you got 245 tailoring you can get the mask from a quest in the seating gorge then make the rest from the trainer.  I did this as a shadow priest.
---
I dunno about some of these.
---
Like yeah, Undercity is super close to Naxx, but what % of level 60's are going to be hanging out in UC? I feel like that is pretty 50/50. Similar with AQ. Yeah Alliance have to take the boat from Menethil but then they're in dustwallow, so they don't have to fly across the Barrens. Horde might still get the better of it but not by much.
---
Meanwhile, both factions have an advantageous position vis a vis the world bosses, easy for Alliance on Kazzak, easy for the Horde on Azuregos. And the green dragons are pretty 50/50 overall.
---
.....and I thought some of the groups I’ve been in were painful. But 4 hours?! Ohh god
---
There was no reason to have to backtrack. If you never did the content, why would you join a T5/T6 guild (Which you realistically couldn't even if you wanted to) when you don't even have T4? I was a casual the whole time in TBC and never had a problem finding a guild in my lane. Same with Vanilla, even when Naxx was out the best I ever got was first few bosses with friend run otherwise there were tons of guilds still doing earlier content that was my area (US-Proudmoore)
---
The whole concept of catchup is flawed in a re-release because there is no time pressure to see all content before next expac.
---
Completely blocking an NPC to prevent you from using them is different than *slightly* covering one side of an NPC to trick people into PvP.
---
I don't get what happened in the second clip
---
‘Should’ and ‘tip’ are words that don’t go together in wow. If you want money, ask for it. Otherwise, don’t expect anything and don’t be disappointed with 5g, 5s, or 5c.
---
No horde go to gnomer, even with the teleport.
---
Firemaw is pretty lively, haven't had any trouble finding dungeon groups during school/work hours, of course it takes a little longer than during peak hours but I've been tanking so it hasn't been that big a problem. Does have some queues during peak hours, worst I've experienced in the past couple weeks is 2.5k which took just under 2 hours iirc.
---
General consensus is that it removes world PvP. It's impossible to engage in PvP with someone on a flying mount 100ft in the air. 
---
Additionally, I think it makes the world feel smaller because you can simply fly over everything in a straight line, semi-afk until you reach your destination.
---
Not my fault, not my problem. It was well-known that the rogue class would be overpopulated
---
Maybe for questing and that’s a hard maybe but doing any dungeons requires running across the entire world. 60 horde Druid vs now leveling alliance warrior. Impossible to find groups for SFK no one wants to run, bfd is hard because NE zones are dead. Stocks has no loot. Scarlet monastery is hardcore protected by the horde. On my Druid I was able to bounce through all these dungeons so easily. Alliance low level dungeon experience is crap
---
Missing Diplomat ends out of nowhere though, =[
---
Most tier sets are sadly not BiS. Maybe one or two pieces are. But the full sets are generally considered a inferior versus mismatched random pieces. 
---
Still going to farm them out though. Love me some pretty loot.
---
Yeah. Like in broad strokes, this guy isn't wrong. But the individual points he makes are real silly.
---
&gt; My realm guilds are taking 4-5 hours to clear mc 
---
lol literally how?
---
Technically you are right, however the quest chain from there is for swamp of sorrows no duckswood.
---
If you head west outta there and run the Southern shore of the lake there are no mobs. Then a short run through the welcome bears (bonus if your a rogue, sprint and vanish can get your through without a death) to the road and you don't agro any guards in the horde camp if you stay on the road through it.
---
The run from south shore is much longer and while you can avoid mobs, if it's pvp you're probably going to die at least once anyway.
---
/shrug. Personal preference either way.
---
Theyre literally using the terminology of the subreddit lol If I made my guild name the yankees and tried to say I wasn't imitating the baseball team you'd be an idiot to ignore it.
---
To add onto this, zygores is incredible. I cannot recommend it enough. It does favor horde sometimes but overall I can basically just follow the area and trust than it’s taking me to the best location. It has made leveling a walk in the park.
---
3mp5 is nothing and a bit more int is nothing compared to +33 healing and spirit
---
What (and I cannot emphasise this enough) the fuck?
---
Guy needs to take a chill pill or thirteen...
---
Only when spirit rezzing
---
you do stocks once for the quests
---
All their dignity for sure.
---
Killing enemy players with multiboxing is the same as ganking lowbies without. Result is the same, you oneshot them. Both are despicable in my opinion and rightfully frowned upon.
---
At the end of the day it promotes toxicity. People grief and get griefed by multiboxers. They literally bring nothing positive to a game. Only a little bit of extra money to blizzard's wallet. Which is short-sighted business. Player satisfaction is what  made WoW so popular and blizzard so rich. Back in vanilla days we had way, way less multiboxers, and the sheer rarity of them made them a non-issue. An average player might not have ever seen one in vanilla days, if they even knew of their existence. Yet I've already met more than ten...
---
And the sad thing is that the reason why they roll 5 shamans, druids or rogues or whatnot on PvP server is painfully obvious - it's to grief other players by oneshotting them with 5x-10x the damage. And stop bringing in the world pvp argument, there is a huge difference between being corpse camped by 5 players and a multiboxer(who is essentially 1 player with 5x the damage. That's the fucking playstyle. 5 ambushes or 5 frost shocks in the same instant.)
---
Meanwhile earlier this week you were playing the martyr for healing and therefore you're entitled to rolling on dps gear for solo farming. 
---
Yeah I'm not gonna take your advice on what is and isn't ninjaing, clown.
---
Prepare to be triggered. First run MH drops. I’m daggers so I passed for the fury warrior. My friends are livid. But I’m not going to use it. I would feel like a dick to roll need on it when I’m planning on being daggers.
---
Backup interface and wtf folders then delete them from the classic directory.  Launch the game and the folders will be rebuilt to factory defaults.
---
I just wanna clear content in a reasonable time and learn the fights so that stuff isn’t necessary. That being said I have 0 classic experience outside of the last two months
---
\&gt; WoW with changes is current, retail WoW. Classic, first and foremost, should be a time capsule preservation piece 
---
Except it isn't and there are changes. You haven't bothered to respond to my points, so i'm done with the conversation now.
---
which is why im praying for BC launch -&gt; classic+, revisit azeroth when BC content runs dry, add shit here and there. I think BC is literally just better vanilla in terms of gameplay.. hard to describe but it feels like if u are playing level 70 vanilla, and not "new content only" expac?
---
I’m biased but I started on BC and that would be so nostalgic and awesome for me.
---
Your guess is as good as mine lol!
---
I'm not even 60 yet and I played everyday. Sucks you no lifed it :(
---
No. It's a 10 second cast that is interrupted by combat.
---
If you’re lucky. I had a hell of a time finding a stocks group on two different toons, and on both no one was down for the whole thing.
---
I srsly dont understand what's confusing about need before greed
---
I timed going from the IF bank to the SW bank using both methods. The Fp was actually faster. Doesn't matter exactly if the tram itself is faster than the flight, since you have to run through all of SW to get to dwarven district. This was with a mount btw, so without it the flight would have even more of an advantage.

Let's be clear about one thing : I'm not talking about the PUG experience here when I say to make exceptions. I'm talking about a guild / guildraid that has to at least try to make concessions to integrate their members (IMO). 
---
However in the event of a PUG, I totally agree that you shouldn't force a total stranger you never met to change his organization just because you decided this time to raid.
---
I never got it to work properly on classic, the queue was broken and the amount of luna errors was just too much.      
---
Luckily [GearMenu](https://github.com/RagedUnicorn/wow-classic-gearmenu) works perfectly and is way more complete than TM.
---
If its pug when one drops I'll usually type in chat "all need" so we all on the same page.
---
Precisely. I guess I needed to explain better.
---
Yup, I decided to level an Alliance character this time around and this also struck me as odd. Why the hell would they make \*Redridge\*, an alliance-exclusive lowbie zone, contested? It's not like Stonetalon, where there is at least \*some\* semblance of contest between the factions' presence in the area. Horde on the other hand simply doesn't have any form of foothold in Redridge at all. Mind-boggling decision.
---
2 for 1, have both expacs but keep it level 70. rebalance for level cap. would feel liike a huge classic+ patch rather than miniscule (in comparison) expac
---
I'm on a PVE server too, I wasn't sure if it was worth saving for later and didn't want to risk the prices potentially going down.
---
Depending on your definition, he is. If this isn't a bannable offence, then Activision-Blizzard is being inconsistent regarding people attacking from rooftops.
---
&gt; I played everyday. 
---
&gt;Sucks you no lifed it :(
---
Man this thread has some incredible Reddit mental gymnastics.
---
You'd probably replace it by 45 through something like the zf staff with int and less sp. Could be worth it if it doesn't cost you so much that it pushes back buying 60 boes
---
How much is Alcor's Sunrazor selling for on your server?
---
I don't understand what's confusing about communally agreed all-need being ninja proof. That's not arguable.
---
I love doing dungeons. I’m rarely just chillin, never long enough to wanna swap out gear. That being said I hsve 7/8 light forge and 5/5 deathbone in my bank cause. Haven’t been motivated enough to run UBRS for the lightforge chest yet
---
Warlock and Mage are pretty brainless in PvE. Mages Frostbolt. Warlocks Shadow Bolt. Pick your flavour. :)
---
Troll racial doesn’t directly affect hit rating, it increases your weapon skill. If you press k (hotkey) it should show your skill levels.  
---
Bows should be at 305 rather than the normal 300. This will effectively give you extra hit.
---
as a new wow rogue player, i did not know this. leveling 50-60 was hell and i mainly did it with quests
---
120 level 45 waters is 8g64s at the vendor so he only ripped himself off if he logged off before using them.
---
Also if you gave him level 55 waters then he definitely didn't rip himself off since it's the only way to get waters higher than 45
---
1-2 hours in the evening isnt exactly no lifing it there bud.
---
Yeah, on RP servers alliance out populate horde by 3:1, so doing a /who mage orgrimmar only brings up ~5 lvl 60 mages even at the most busy times.
---
Nice, but needs more hordes ganging.
---
Tbh I hope they make a more fleshed out version of classic.
---
Like a 30 spell power enchant on a vendor bought skinning knife?  Why would you do that?  You could put that enchant on like any level 20 quest weapon or dungeon drop and better off than a skinning knife.
---
No need for all of this, just search "shadowed" on your WTF folder and delete all results. Deleting wtf will reset all his settings as well.
---
I had a pretty fun run where we tried to skip and reset trash and we had to jump up the window and our warlock was the worst at it so he couldn’t even help summon.
---
I'll never pay for mage food and water it literally only costs them mana.

You can still enjoy your ride without cockblocking everyone else ahead of you
---
SFK, WC, RFC, every SM, RFK, RFD vs stockades + dm.
---
relentless strikes full crit ambush/backstab is viable and extremely fluid. I would never not use this method to level.
---
Epic as always, thanks Valdihr!
---
We get to constantly use our expensive respecs so it works out in the end.
---
You Sir, are a man of culture I see
---
There's about 40 realms across the EU server and the same goes for NA.
---
Without doing some hard research, I think it’s safe to say you could use it until you get raid gear.   
---
Unless of course you’re the legendary melee warlock in which case the dps is horrid.
---
Arcane is very big. Bear in mind shatter is useless in raids which is your big damage boost in dungeons.
---
Golemagg is -pvp- but has one of the (if not) most populated horde fraction of all EU realms . Population is overwhelming even when we still have 2 or 3 layers. Future is indeed bright for Golemagg.
---
The first quests for Alliance start inland. I ran into nothing but 25 plus horde players when I was there at 20.
---
Both at the same time obviously ;) ;
---
I don't think a classic+ would be a good idea given how vastly different Blizzard is to when the game was originally developed.
---
To be honest it makes me think of Bethesda making Fallout games, they are alright at best but they miss what made the original so good.
---
A studio where many of the original staff and the philosophy of the company have shifted may as well be a new studio altogether. Similar to Infinity Ward and Bioware, sadly.
---
What raid frames are you using?
---
The ones that come with elvui looks like shit.  I downloaded Luna, but I can't get them to show buffs/debuffs the way I want.   The raid frames from pfui were perfect IMO, but that's not updated.  
---
Any other suggestions?
---
It was Nielsen Superdata
---
So both reputable and inaccurate. Have fun with that.
---
wowhead
---
yes if u get a epic dagg
---
I agree. If they went to the BC route, I doubt they would overhaul Outlands map layout because of the no changes philosophy.
---
I'm on an alliance majority server, is getting to BRD etc gonna be a nightmare?  I was quite keen to run it a lot...
---
I'd say need if you are going to equip on the character you're currently playing. Otherwise it's a greed roll for everyone who is selling on the AH.
---
Need = Main spec equip
---
Greed = Everything else
---
Imo
---
Don’t know if it works inside of the instance (doubt it?) 100% works outside of instances tho
---
It applies to any guard blind spots afaik
---
Jesus, do some homework before you go into these things, guys.  
---
Oh, noes, OP might now consider this post "tOxIc""
---
&gt;literally nobody
---
Stop using that word.
---
as a rogue. what do i do in a scenario like this?
---
Not out yet.
---
Holy shit I was just gonna make a post saying this and I haven't even read your post yet. I'm gonna assume you mention how many zones alliance just do not have flightpaths and horde does.
---
we don't talk about gnomes.
---
Our guild daggers rogue rolled on Viskag a day after admonishing us for being so stupid as to use swords. he won, but was shamed into passing in the end lol
---
Agree to disagree. I said nothing about charging while in groups. But if I’m in a main city doing something and or out in the world, and someone interrupts my gameplay to make them water, I would expect a tip. 
---
I don’t make water to sell, got better things to do than that.
---
Has you jump between zones far too often, makes you grind full levels at a time. The pathing isn’t Efficient either
---
why did u use ur phone to take a pic of a computer screen???
---
Still true for hunters, slower weap gives more time to run between shots
---
Which is true but it's also a famous spot for pvp. So usually there are high-level players for both factions in that area. I was ganked repeatedly in Hillsbrad in my low 30s over there.
---
&gt; There's no catchup mechanics in Vanilla
---
uhh maybe don't join a top 20 guild? i like that every problem this subreddit has seems to be down to the guild choice. You want to raid as ret but your guild wont let you, you want to have catch up raids but your guild doesn't want to, stop blaming the game for your detachment issues no one forces you to be in a not casual guild.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
What are the goblin only items that are good for PVP?
---
Playing games is literally wasting time for fun, so.. what was your point again?
---
It's easier to find pugs as a healer generally, but as far as I can see, a lot of guilds are recruiting warriors or have a heavy lack of them. Lots of 2nd BiS weapons past BWL like maces and axes(for alliance) will just get disenchanted for a lot of groups.
---
Lost a roll on edgemasters last night .... sad day
---
"they missing" was pretty much the end of it.
---
*laughs in deep frost*
---
We have pockets, women don't.
---
My horde guild was top 50. We saw multiple alliance 10 levels above a lot of us on same server. 
---
Look at the top 20 (the most no life of the no life.) 15/20 are alliance guilds.
---
Lol, a short summary.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/onyxia-lair-attunement-classic
---
Yes and again it was OPs fault for trying to explain this to the raid leader at the beginning of the raid. You don't try and explain this shit to the raid leaders as they are organizing a raid because they have 40 different people whispering them about raid stuff. You talk to them about it the day before a raid or earlier and let them know what's going on and then they will probably make an exception for you. If you wait till the last minute and try and get the raid leader to make exceptions your going to have a bad time they are trying to organize 40 people and don't have time to deal with issues you decided to wait to bring up until the raid is starting.
---
Classicwow.live has surpassed everything so far that I have seen. The pacing is accurate and there isn’t much grinding. The only real grinds that I dealt with over the course of a shit load of leveling so far is in arathi highlands as horde. It has you grind almost 2 full levels. Kind of a bitch but considering that’s all you do, it’s not bad. Also it has you do rfc/wc/bfd/zf for quests. But since I’m on my alts with rested I’m way past needing to do dungeon quests.
---
Most guides also don’t constantly map out good time to train, buy ammo, set hearth and spirit rez but this guide is so good about it. There are a few issues like a bad spirit rez(undead starting zone) and a couple of not soloable quests but otherwise it has been really solid.
---
I have level 60, 54, 24, 15, 14 and 6 chars and all in different starting areas for horde and no problems. Also seems like durotar is by far the best but you get to barrens before the undead do so you are slightly lower level than undead the entire way through.
---
You did a great job here, it seem you got it right. But what could've been done? You see... this classic is a risky project. If they launch the original game everyone will complain about unbalanced stuff or  will say "this way would be better". If they change game features everyone will complain that is different, and say "that's not the classic experience" and so on. At this point I wouldn't like to be developer of a game like this. Seems like in every turn you'll make mistakes that will get people unsatisfied.
---
&gt; Some of us grew up since vanilla.
---
Does not sound like it to be honest, at least not with that mentality.
---
Unless you’re a night elf.
---
In a pug, this is the only fair way.
---
Deadmines is a 10 minute swim from gromgol for Horde though. Nothing compared to the walks to the Barrens for alliance. 
---
Source: I did it on my warrior
---
Mage tier is really good when you're out in the wild. Raid bis is basically just "stack as much SP as you can at the expense of everything else", when you're farming or expecting pvp encounters, a balanced set of gear with more health/mana and a little less SP can be a lot better. 
---
If you're aoe farming with a mage, health/mana is much, much better than SP, too.
---
i mean i did 1-50 with quests too but instead of spamming ZF/BRD for exp i just did quests cause at the beginning everything was spellcleave no matter what
---
Looks like half of the bartenders in Seattle.  Thats includes the women too.
---
Got two chars to 60 already, 2600g should be enough for now, gear is bis except for few MC pieces.
---
Not everyone is as hardcore as me, but I know 9 guilds on my server are already raid logging.
---
It may be solid but it isn’t the high ground
---
I know, it's almost always low level characters too, so maybe they're just trying to help?  It doesn't bother me really, I just think it's amusing that folks don't know how much water healers can go through in a several hours of dungeoning.
---
&gt; That’s like horde complaining about redridge or wetlands.
---
It's really not, because once you're sick of stonetalon you go straight back to non-contested territory in southern barrens.
---
In all honesty I interpreted your first message incorrectly. However your attitude was immediately hostile so I didn’t care to correct it. There’s nothing hypocritical of both options being viable, yours just takes way more effort than it’s worth.
---
\&gt;Nelves are open border  
---
Half the WC3 Orc campaign and most of the Nelf says otherwise. They wanna build a wall and make the Orcs pay for it.
---
There are definitely no alliance priests doing this 😂😂😂
---
I don't believe so. Haven't seen anything for it
---
Mograine my main server got 1000 in queue atm. Will check Golemagg aswell.
---
How have your experience with the community been on Golemagg?
---
Horde actually have another Hinterlands quest reward that trumps anything Alliance have access to *anywhere* https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19022/nat-pagles-extreme-angler-fc-5000
---
Alliance do not have *any* access to a +25 fishing pole in the entire game. At least you can outgear Rune of the Guard Captain...
---
Horde is vastly superior over Alliance* FTFY
---
I will ask the opposite question. I have leveled up a 60 troll mage on the Spanish server and now I would like to level up an ally toon on a good EU ally server. Any tips?
---
Mage bis includes T1 helm, wrists, and gloves (for 3 piece bonus). T2 legs as well, but T2 helm isn't good.
---
I have felt similarly about alliance on my server. I think many are deterred right now due to the fact we are so heavily outnumbered which makes leveling kinda difficult. Hoping BG’s lets people get their pvp fix so it’s not so painful, lol.
---
brb quitting w/e guild i'm in
---
I had massive problems with it as alliance and know at least 3 people in my guild that had similar experiences. I've written more on the issues I had with it higher up this reply chain.
---
At first I was super impressed but it became infuriating as I progressed.
---
What do you mean theres no point to pvp? fucking people up is enough reward already
---
&gt;even though alliance has better low level zones
---
You what?
---
Tirisfal Glades is the best starter zone in WoW.
---
There isn't one guard at the alliance outpost in Stonetalon. Not one.
---
And it turns out that's a pattern that follows through most of the game. Alliance barely have any guards.
---
Which is particularly terrible when you get to the cities and you can only get directions in Ironforge.
---
When there are the same amount of grunts in Orgrimmar as in Ironforge plus TB and UC both have guards at every bridge and doorway.
---
Are you ok? Like really do you need to talk? You're coming into a 1 month old post just to smear your insecurity all over it. This may surprise you but I didn't actually write this for the approval of gatekeepers
---
There is an addon that will tell you general spawn locations and respawn timers but I don't know of one that scans for currently live rares.
---
Rare Aware
---
I guess you could always apeel
---
Maybe that’s true for mages as another comment has said. Don’t know. Don’t particularly care since I have never played one very far. But that would be the exception to the rule. Not the norm.
---
When low level players whisper you to tell you "you dont know what youre doing" lmao
---
Good lad &lt;3
---
Your not tipping him you were probably in need and was forced to buy  them
---
You must’ve found a willing group - that’s what it takes for Stocks, takes me 30+ min to fill a group usually.  
---
Also everybody does SFK on horde not sure where you got that notion.
---
I mean, for leveling, discipline is way better than shadow up until level 36-40 ish.
---
Edit: about Priest, not the other classes.
---
max reputations, you have frostsabers, argent dawn, main factions, timbermaw, doing all the quests, getting your alts for crafting and cooldowns, etc.
---
I agree, though they’re significantly cheaper than the normal 60 mounts. It I recall less than a quarter of the price?
---
Get help.
---
Just reroll you will not regret it
---
Vanquisher Sword MH and sword of Omen OH from 37-50ish, then get thrash blade, then use Thrash Blade MH and Vanq OH until 60ish. Makes leveling soooo much nicer. There's a short quest chain in Badlands that you will be a group for at the end but awards a cheat piece with 24 agi on it that's really good.
---
I'm going to start back playing retail for the first time since last year. Leveling in classic was fun but the end game content and this cliquey, weird culture that exists around max level of classic is really off-putting to me.
---
He prolly just tryna get his money for the rent
---
&gt;The irony
---
&gt;but after months of classic
---
*panics, checks date, looks outside... Puuh, only october, still some time to get christmas gifts*
---
Edit: technically correct, tho..
---
sunwell is so far along in the life cycle of TBC.. before then this isnt a problem
---
I would like things to be easier but I feel like 12 days of game play would be for nothing.
---
WoW has always had these patch cycles. It is long. People drift in and out. Lots can accomplish their goals and then just bide their time raidlogging or less. Or alts.
---
I remember rerolling an alt after I got tired of 5mans in 1.3, even have a screenshot of me moping around and chatting with a friend about how we were bored so we made our 2nd alts on another realm. There is a lot to spend time on, but truly... for progressing? Once you know what you want from the game, there is only so much content. This is especially true for people who can play for 3-4+ hours a day. They devour content and progress until they reach a bit of a ceiling.
---
So some quit and some help out others but it's interesting to note the recent cadre of players mostly balk at doing something just for fun, without going for a quest or item or for a guild member. I remember basically living in the game for a couple months, and eventually got heavily into PvP mostly because it was an activity in the game which was almost always going. Then once I finished my grind I was less apt to spend as much time playing. Just how incentives work.
---
Going from horse to alliance, I was shocked at how much better alliance has it, actually. Apart from the nutty about of running from the east to west end of duskwood in the 20s, alliance quests are well developed, close together l, intertwine narratives, and only attunement for alliance is way better than horde. Even throughout retail, I had one alliance alt while maining horde, just to see the lore from the other side, and I was consistently impressed by the additional effort put into the alliance player experience.
---
And then there's Western Plaguelands, which doesn't even have a Horde flight path or graveyard. 
---
If you die anywhere besides Scholomance, or the island the instance is located in, you get sent to the Scarlet Monastery graveyard.
---
And Alliance also have a 2 minute flight to MC, BWL, BRD, UBRS and LBRS, and a pretty short flight to Scholo, Strat, and Naxx from their main city.
---
Time is money friend
---
I don't remember that at all and i had over 300 days /played on my vanilla hunter
---
a bunch of us hunters used a pet passive &gt; FD &gt; trap macro even
---
hi, a week late sorry.
---
I wanted to weight the stats for my shaman 40 so I made some calculation and realised that in term of healing per mana point (HpM)  1 point of intel worth much more than +Healing (or spell power on healing). yes 1 point of Healing
---
\+Healing (power) is interesting only when you have reached the point when you are never oom and solely in that case you should begin to replace +Intel gear by some +Healing gear. that's why healers usually have a few pieces, or even a complete set of +healing gear to replace their mana pool gear (intel + mp5 mana regen) at will.
---
that should interest you:
---
[List of Spell-Coefficients 1.12.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)
---
as a basis: for 100 points of Healing Power you gain a flat out \~85.71 healing point on a spell casted in 3-3.5 seconds.
---
ex: spell is 800 healing with a cast of 3 sec. then you'll get a \~885 heal.
---
let's say that 800 heal spell cost 300 mana : 800/300 = 2.66 Heal per Mana (HpM)
---
1 Intel = 15 mana so 1 Int = 2.66 \* 15 = 17.66 heal (on that spell)
---
100 +Healing = 85.71 more heal so it's 0.8571 heal per point.
---
let's compare with Intel: 17.66 / 0.8571 = 20.61
---
You remember your, our problem, is to avoid to get OOM so a point of Intel on gear is 20.61 more efficient (using that spell) in term of mana pool management than a point of Healing Power (for that specific spell I used as an exemple. replace that spell with the one you want and check the link I provided)
---
EDIT: though if your tank's life goes down faster than you can cast heals to cover the damages then at this point you need more healing power of course.
---
Conversation that has happened umpteen times spanning years. Yes lets continue to beat a dead horse, this is thrilling conversation.
---
For farming I'd stay away from BiS lists as that gear tends to sacrifice survivability for damage. Look instead for a PvP list. Intellect and Stam
---
I personally found every dungeon group extremely fast with no problems or toxic people. But it is subjective. World PvP is great fun at every corner. In /s and /y people are usually very quiet in cities.
---
Servers are finite anyway. I think the route they will take is letting people keep their characters and then create a parallel server once we run out of content.
---
You haven't played horde then, you're pretty much forced to leave barrens at 16-20 and go to Stonetalon. Lots of WPVP there.
---
I have tanked it with decent healers at 250 FR fully buffed without a shield.
---
All 4 kills have been 1 shot with no threat of me dying.
---
Don’t worry. the “content” was overshadowed by music that makes your ears bleed. Overall just a shit video.
---
Looks like this joke is too offensive for reddit, sorry guys.
---
"apparently co-opted by ethno-nationalists." Somebody never went to frenworld. I'm not saying the guild itself is full of nazis. I'm simply saying they're shitlords referencing the reddit community that got banned. "The point I’m trying to get at is if you are liberal in your labeling of anything that looks like a far-right dog whistle you end up looking like an over-sensitive clown," [k](https://i.imgur.com/6kGliTj.jpg)
---
It says free 40 mount. Rad looking 60 so yeah free
---
It's pretty ignorant to say this tbh.
---
And where do you get the lockboxes? I can’t just make them with my mana. On avg you can unlock one lockbox every 10 min if you’re really spamming channel 2. Mage food will always be needed. Every high end dungeon you make 4 stacks for your crew.  
---
 You’re absolutely wrong here dude, I don’t see how you think it’s as passively Easy for a rogue to make money opening lock boxes and pickpocketing then it is for mages to make food for others.
---
Mograine my Home server is pretty good its 51%-49% ally vs Horde, so there is a Good amount of pvp. The community is pretty Good. I have meet some assholes, but not as many as i expected.
---
seriously.
---
im hung the fuck over. i dont have the mental stamina to deal with shit like that.
---
Darrowspike is not Alliance only.

Karazhan
---
I am fairly  geared atm  with beny, 3 pieces of prophecy  and tier 2 pants. And I just switched to disc power infusion build... and I gotta say disc just doesn't heal as much as holy does. I don't go oom  as fast but 31/20/0 is different  and harder to play than 21/30/0. deep holy is better at main tank healing and deep disc is better at raid support and raid healing.
---
The only situation you will ever need to use your unarmed skill as a priest is if you are completely out of mana and your wand is broken and needs repair. My 41 priest has 1 unarmed skill. 
---
Stop being a dweeb.
---
Good, it helps me weed out the ninjas, reputation matters on my server.
---
oh damn mind telling me what application that is?
---
What, no selfie cam? 6.1/10
---
It's terrible but you wouldn't do it that way.
---
What sucks is that you can't easily skip the reverse-wetlands run, when you can just walk over the mountains from dun morogh.
---
Kinda depends on the player. I was really excited to finally do BRD since I just started WoW with classic. I would have happily spent hours just trying to make small progress, learn the area, discover it for myself, etc. Being a warrior I was able to start tanking at 53 for 60s who just needed any tank they could find, so I didn’t have to do quite as much of that, but even so I had groups with several wipes and it didn’t make it less fun. 
---
It’s kinda weird how people say “retail sucks because it’s so easy, Classic is cool because stuff can actually kill you!” but then they act like anyone who doesn’t rage quit a group first wipe is wasting their times. Like, which is it?
---
100g more to feed my Warrior alt. Working out pretty good
---
Most useful reps aren’t in the game yet, AD is revered, I’m horde so no frostsaber.
---
I have no interest in completing every single quest, I would just like to pvp for honor on my pvp server.
---
Agreed - and it had that level of mercy without making the content easy.  Heriocs could be REALLY tough, even with decent gear, demanded the right approach.  The raids were challenging as well, and INTERESTING.  Karazhan was amazing, Zul'aman was so cool, that ogre one existed for five minutes...  And the 25man raids were great!  I honestly think I prefer the BC raid selection to the vanilla raid selection.
---
Can confirm. Leveled tons of Alliance characters and would always have multiple quest slumps where I only have like 2-3 quests in my log at any given time.
---
Leveled horde, and from level 10 all the way to level 45ish, I never had less than 5 quests in my log at any given time. I was often dropping quests and skipping low level quests, hell, skipping entire zones, simply because I had way too many quests to do.
---
Horde just has way more leveling quests than Alliance does.
---
You should read up on the concept of play if you think it's just "wasting time"
---
Low priority debuffs still have the potential to push off other low priority debuffs that are superior to garbage weapon procs.
---
As others have said, be up front so the healer can decide if they want to stick around for that. Personally, I would not be ok with a tank rolling against me for healer gear but that's me.
---
Thank you will go Migraine then
---
It's very interesting to me, I started playing in Cata so I never got to see what questing and leveling was like in the original world. I love hearing all of these stories, and seeing people's viewpoints and experiences. To me, OPs post was very interesting.
---
I did that span in hillsbrad foothills, the mine that is to the west of Southshore almost always has two to three nodes of tin. Unless you’re made of money I wouldn’t buy the silver ore and smelt it. On my server silver ore went for 50s a pop and a silver bar was barely 5s so it wasn’t worth it for me.
---
You're right. If he had ban thok and archmage instead of tier, he would get +7sp +1hit +1crit which is better for raiding when you only care about offensive stats as a mage.
---
Out in the world, the extra stam/int/spi on tier is helpful for pvp and farming.
---
Ideally you go for boots,crown and either bracers or gloves for the 3T1 bonus in P1, crown bracers and gloves in P2 when you replace the boots with the pvp ones. 
---
Either way, people judging a mage for wearing tier out in the world has no idea what they're talking about. Not everyone wants to roleplay as a glass cannon outside of raids and good players have different sets of gear depending on what they want to do.
---
I finally had to download questie on my alliance character because I just couldn't find quests, not the case on horde side.
---
Again, I disagree. The player is asking for a favor - you might expect a favor in return, but that doesn’t mean it should be a tip and also they don’t owe you anything.  
---
It’s so so so fucking easy for a mage to make a few stacks and trade them over, and that will make a warrior or rogue or warlocks leveling experience that much better. I don’t understand why mages just don’t do it for free.
---
Why did you ask a question and then get mad at the response? Lol
---
The idea of further develop Classic, and thus ignore TBC and the rest of the expansion.
---
Basicly what Runescape did.
---
You literally just said spirit is meant for priests in your previous comment. That implies a lack of benefit for other classes, which is wrong; spirit is meant for anyone who wants to regen more out of combat, or during combat if their class or talents allows them to. You don't have to literally say something to say it, context is key.
---
Did you make that oop yourself?
---
You actually think ret is good in PVP.. I feel bad for you. I love seeing Ret Paladins in PVP, they can't do anything.
---
What should I name a Priest  character specifically designed to Mind Control people off ledges?
---
Something funny
---
I still love wow and it's community, I just don't want to play it and I don't want to give blizzard money.
---
Hey OP, go find the horde camp in Felwood.
---
I've always heard that there isnt enough quests for the road to 60, and you will run out somewhere in the 50s. I'm 59 almost halfway and I've had a full quest log almost the entire time. I just had to dump off some quests to get all the quests from Nathanos and Tirion.
---
I've always used it. The thing is,your muscles can be retrained. :)

Only reason I did Gnomer was for the [Triprunner Dungarees](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9624/triprunner-dungarees). Those badboys lasted me from level 30 all the way to 60.

Tip is tip, I always just give water for whatever tip, if they don't tip o well but rude I guess especially with 55 water taking a good 3-4 minutes to make full stack of, but it's a game.

I really like the female priest human animations.
---
Yeah but, like, they deserve it
---
Lol you need to spend more time in school, kiddo. Got no place telling people to grow tf up when you get mad about pixels on a screen.
---
This. They need to give people options or we are back to square one in a few years time.

Found a Staff of Jordan at level 38/39, didn't have enough for my mount at 40 until then.

You port to Naxx from a structure inside the plaguewood.

lol did you guys just stand in the middle of the room and do the boss wrong?
---
When my friends are offline, I play a lot less. Ideally you find people doing the same quests as you. And try to build a friends list with the ones that are cool. Finding a good guild, need one that has raid times when you’re active. The days they don’t raid, likely all active when you are.
---
Found the Wrath baby.
---
Odds are that you are experiencing the "mountain goat" approach where the tank just also his head into all the mobs at the same time. Try using cc and splitting up the pulls. It will feel less hard.
---
I hate how Arathi has no inn for alliance
---
Absolutely. If I know, I'm limited in playtime, I don't try to do a dungeon. They can take forever sometimes. Just do some grinding or farming or work on your proffessions. There is so much more to do than a quick run..
---
I think you need to get killing blow with drain soil active to receive a ss
---
"Run" ride your mount for literally a minute and a half. 
---
Anyways there's no inn in the Western Plaguelands at Chillwind Camp,  Closest inns are in the Hinterlands and Hillsbrad Foothills. Horde also doesn't have to run through/around Andorhal or swim to get to the northern half of WPL/EPL
---
Its all fun and games until the eye actually goes to a hunter.
---
That's completely irrational, but it's your gaming experience so you do you
---
Best thing for me was finding people to level with.
---
Sure, why not. As a warlock I try not to worry myself with these problems. My spells either crit and pull aggro or miss entirely.
---
Not on this sub /sorry
---
I always give free food and water in Stormwind. Love seeing annoyed mages crying because I'm "ruining" their businesses.
---
Also don’t forget about the wickerman buff outside of UC gives 25% faster regen for health and mana and also gives a 25% increase to your overall stamina, lasts 2 hours
---
if he's always on then maybe send him the message?
---
if he isn't, send him a letter back? 
---
you don't need to confess your undying gratitude to someone on reddit or on twitter or anything like that.
---
why is this suddenly a thing?
---
Ally can 2h too but I think for them it’s typically a slam spec
---
Yeah I understand prices will fall due to more supply.
---
The dagger for example TSM was showing it as selling at 15g, not listed. But then over the weekend the minimum buyout dropped all the way to like 6g. I'm not too concerned about low level blues though because I know they will fluctuate a lot.
---
I'm really more interested in how best to sell things like silk, ele fire, and other mats. And also a lot of greens show high prices in TSM like 1-3g, I've tried selling quite a few but usually they don't sell. 
---
After trying a couple of times should I just vendor the greens even though the market price is supposedly 3-5x higher?
---
I'm not having a good time because I don't call people "shitty" for not wanting to make small talk in dungeons? Is this the spirit of classic wow?
---
Gold grinding alt suggestions I suppose? My rogue is geared and basically waiting for weekly raids, im daggers so grinding mobs is kinda awful solo. I've leveled a warrior/hunters/druid to 10 but cant decide what to stick with as an alt to hopefully make some gold on.
---
Hunters are probably the obvious gold machines being able to solo things, but warriors seem like it'd be easier to find a group to grind dungeons to level this go around. Druid seems like it could be a little bit of both or i could just go shaman for some pvp memes. How do you guys decide your alts? lmao
---
Kindred, horde guild on Grob, is offering helms for 150g, mats supplied by purchaser. Plus mats it still isn't crazy to farm for both mount and helm. And to answer your question, I only smoke the finest.
---
I agree, on both points. The post does say that only bosses have that %, but it feels like normal mobs do as well.
---
This warrants some testing I wager.
---
&gt;mage player

Okay, then.

Fast offhands eat your flurry procs, you should avoid them.

Sorry Classic is perfect without any single flaws whatsoever

Rogue tank? lmfao

wait what was part 3? I finished the missing diplomat quest chain. Where does part 3 pick up?
---
There are catchup mechanics for vanilla: 20 man raids, and patch 1.10 dungeon gear (Phase 5)
---
Thank you for the info
---
People do that so it's tradeable after equipping
---
Because some people use the app more.
---
Thank you i will switch. The queue didn't work for me either although it was a nice thought.
---
Thanks for the info. I appreciate it
---
I'd say Alliance have the better zones 1-30ish once Duskwood is finished but after that it drops off sharply and questing is a clusterfuck of simply bopping from multiple zones trying to find enough quests. On Horde, the starting zones were pretty blah but the flow from zone to zone was far more organic.
---
Euthanasia
---
So I've been told (never did it myself), but your gonna want a lot of int and mana pots on hand for sure. Probably pretty damn hard though, might be easier at 54 with the new rank of AE. Plus, you'll hardly get EXP from it, the mobs will be mostly grey.
---
Every version of the game  is unbalanced. Some are arguably even more unbalanced than vanilla, in retail many specs are unplayable in competitive pve or pvp, many more than classic.
---
Warlock was ridiculously overpowered in BC
---
Portal to UC--&gt;fly to LH
---
This is a non-issue though since you just put your Hearthstone at Light's Hope Chapel when you're raiding Naxx.
---
To be honest, if you join enough PUG raids you'll eventually hear some drunk 40 year old talk about how he tanked on his priest all the way to Naxx.
---
I think we should have a code word in our LFG statement for groups like this.  Like "LFG BRD Healer questrun" or something so we can filter out the cleave blow hards.
---
Having you play the game longer.
---
Yeah I'm talking about people wanting to progress past MC/Kara once they missed the curve. Guilds got hung up doing BWL farm runs and never got past it, like having an uber Kara group but the 2nd group wipes all the time and 25man raids (or Aq40/progression) rarely happen at all due to both lack of attendance and gear diaparity.
---
When someone joins a guild and begins to gear up, they're beholden to the time required to get items over the course of months - and at a certain point in the game that becomes so infeasible guilds begin to cannibalize one another merely to have players able to survive and participate. 40 man raid made it easier to carry folks during that phase, but even then it's a time and % game. It causes people to react accordingly.
---
Thanks for the info that helps a lot. Also I'm on a high pop PvE server so I'm guessing prices for most things are lower since they're easier to farm. 
---
Anyway I'm level 39 and about 10g from enough money for my mount, should I just undercut mats and other stuff I'm holding onto to get the sales as quick as possible?
---
Why not? He's level 54.
---
Blackrock Depths*
---
Oh god why did I sell my golden pearls for 10g each fuck me
---
My dude my comment wasn’t even directed at you and you took major offense I’m pretty sure that’s the “classic reddit move” here, but if your admitting to being an adult with no job and no social life and that’s why you got so butt hurt I’m sorry, too your parents, you must be a hell of a burden. I love how you think because someone has a life outside of the virtual world that means they are bad at life. I’m curious how you came up with such logic. 😂

And in return Horde don't have to travel half an hour just to get to Ony.
---
Looks typical for a gnome player.
---
Back in the day during Vanilla I got Nightslayer chestpiece on my first ever MC run. Nothing so far in Classic I don't think.
---
Got the axe,shoulders,head and pants on 4 runs on SM Armory on my warrior.
---
This is exactly what I was thinking. Thank you sir. Next question - combat dag or ass dag or sub dag?
---
You're welcome. XP
---
In terms of months, it's nothing. Only 14 months after expac launch.  
---
If it was re-done Blizzard would have to pad the time out considerably.
---
Only gnomish can make it, but any eng with the correct level can use it.
---
In 1.12 weapon damage is normalized. Sulthraze might swing at 2.6 speed but your instant attacks will upscale that speed to 3.3 for the sake of damage calculation. The majority of raid weapons are 3.4 speed with a few exceptions. What this means is weapon speed hardly matters at all. People who over-emphasize weapon speed don't know what they're talking about.
---
Just not humorous. You come off as whiny yourself.
---
It costs you time. You decide what that is worth.
---
Yeah but then burning crusade came and everyone went blood elf.
---
Ah yes, because the first 30 levels are just hell to get through. Everyone knows the latter half of leveling is fastest and easiest.
---
Don't forget detect invisibility you stinge
---
I agree it's about level range, and Redridge is low level, about on the same level as Darkshore, so wouldn't it make sense for it to be uncontested? Lore doesn't have anything to do with it but I do believe control does. If both factions have a town in the same area, it makes sense for it to be a contested zone, a la Stonetalon, despite the low level.
---
I never used healbot that makes sense. Even in retail never used it before. Does it help significantly?
---
"He said when he botfished 1 k gold"
---
Find a guild that’s working on forming a raid group.  Help people get geared and leveled for raiding.
---
In the post I made mocking whining? Are you sure you understand this correctly?
---
I have a feeling they have fixed it up in retail, looks like you are going to have better leveling experience if you go back there.
---
You get an ID when the first boss kill occurs, however, folks are reporting a bug wherein simply entering a raid instance sets you to an ID so be careful until we get a blue post about it.
---
Not bad! Made me blow air out my nose !

Or a riff on Pied Piper. Maybe Hamelin is too obscure?

So how is your rap?

It just needs to yield xp or honor

This should be [fixed](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/raid-id-multi-generation/97550/34)
---
Ignore video content, I'm curious as to which addon shows spell effect durations like this: https://youtu.be/7CX9wFvBIwY?t=367 - cooldowns and things like Cone of Cold chill effect durations are shown right of center. Anyone have an idea?
---
The horde levelling is better by accident, however the alliance zones are much better. Actually it's just EK is better than Kalimdor. Barrens, 1kn, desolace, tanaris, and silithus all feel the same. And the quests are just random kill quests with no theme.
---
\*laughs in Blackrock Mountain\*
---
thats not classic plus then
---
Dagger rogues do really good damage if they know how to play daggers. I prefer swords as I’ve never messed with daggers. If you plan on going daggers you have less competition for weapons and you aren’t restricted to humans for the racial. Pick the master race and gnome lol.
---
I did most of my 1-60 alone. Partied up for the occasional dungeon, and way more rarely for kill quests, but I didn't even join a guild until I was in the 40s. With WoW, I usually try to have something going on my second monitor. It makes the grind way more enjoyable when you aren't actually focusing on it at all.
---
Ah, the Warriors-should-tank-all-my-dungeon-but-not-gear-for-raids argument.
---
Yeah just get the two rarest drops in the game and it "supposed to be good". Lmfao
---
I find it continually disturbing that these are classically alliance dominated lands recently invaded by the horde yet all the most desirable locations are occupied by horde and the alliance are relegated to inconvenient foothold locations.
---
[This video sort of explains it](https://youtu.be/S3GH5cWPFOE), but the gist of it is that Classic has a ridiculous amount of melee leeway which makes it hardly worth trying to kite as a melee player. Private servers don't have this issue, so it got spotted pretty quick by warrior mains trying to hamstring kite and failing.
---
This happened to one of my groups. The second heal died early but I managed to keep the group alive during the storm &amp; get the other heals resurrected before the next wave. Felt good man.
---
more hit= more crit ONLY when you have so much crit that its pushed off the roll table by misses
---
Thanks man!
---
Almost a must run for melee for trip runner though
---
While I agree it makes sense in-lore, I ain't exactly gonna sigh and go "it's lore friendly" when I'm having to grind out mobs at lvl 43 because there's no level appropriate quests for me, and no one wants to dungeon grind.
---
Yeah but he includes areas like stonetalon but not duskwood/wetlands/redridge lol. Clearly pushing a narrative.
---
Your opinion is false bro get fucked
---
No, I'm spartacus!
---
this is some facebook mom level posting
---
Also he doesn't mention redridge
---
Ye but as he said most people without previous experience of questing in a zone or an addon not be so thorough and pick up all quests related to a specific place in a zone. So it will be a lot of running if you miss a quest or two and have to go back only to realize that you have to, perhaps, kill the same mobs again but for another quest item.
---
Just join the discord. I am always in discord for raids but I'm not even listening most of the time
---
Edit: what server are you on? My guild would take yall. Whitemane us alliance
---
Timeworn mace is amazing for tanking. Used it since 57 and haven't found a good upgrade since. I thought 2.2 speed was a bit slow but it's actually perfect since i talented sunder for 12 rage.
---
It allows you to search based on price per unit.
---
For example I would search for runecloth based on a 6.5 silver per piece filter.  That way you can buy any number of pieces at the price you’re looking for.
---
Good luck, kiddo
---
Thanks, but you're no fun :(
---
Apparently the WotLK version was tuned close to where vanilla naxx40 was. So you'd be doing similar content with 15 less people but 20 more levels.
---
Or you gotta hop into a hammock on ground floor. Those are rested spots.
---
I'm a 60 mage. I picked to craft my Archmage before purchasing my epic mount and I do not regret it. I came to this conclusion after assessing what I wanted to do with my time regarding farming, running dungeons, and pvp. I farm money through zf and could clear 5 runs before my hour instance lockout with my rate mount, I have had no complaints with tardiness going to dungeons/raids with my guild or pugs, and pvp isn't taken too seriously from my experience until phase 2. I ended up being able to farm for it within a week after making my robes with no issues. For the majority of my gameplay during phase 1 the epic mount wasn't too important to obtain. 
---
So...my suggestion is to understand what you want to do with your time and assess which would be more beneficial. If you want to spend a lot of your time farming world mobs or herbs or whatever, I would recommend getting your mount first. If you are spending most of your time in dungeons where your damage output is more valuable, then robes.
---
Fire hardened haubrek
---
Good luck kiddo with that shitty attitude of yours in life bro
---
That is why, no tank wants a second warrior in his group who rolls on the same loot as him. Learn how to tank, when forming a group tell people you are new but you want to learn. You will meet assholes but there are enough people who will be understanding and are willing to help, tell you how to pull etc. Tanking a dungeon doesn't mean you are not allowed to roll on dps gear, just be open about it
---
Good luck with your two 50s bro
---
Lol thanks! 👍
---
Ah interesting, so 25 rep to IF/Darn/SW then instead of 50 to Darn?
---
By private servers vets, easily. By the average WoW player? 99% won't even have cleared AQ by then.
---
From Live entrance go down the first corridor, turn left then turn left again he spawns to the left of the fountain where you need to get the tobacco
---
From side gate once you pass the first mob pack go left in that tunnel with the open gates and he spawns in the back left of the room next to the fountain
---
i usually invite a random doing same quest as me and a lot of the time we do more quests after and pick up a few more people, kill some of the opposite faction etc, Yeah some people just leave after you help them wit the quest but a lot of people dont.
---
Sounds like duskwood for alliance
---
I don’t understand this mentality.
---
The alliance have better racials for pvp (gnome racial &gt; every other racial in the game unless you’re a caster, in which case it’s still amazing but not quite as good as orc stun resistance is and WOTF vs locks and priests). Paladins are much, much more useful than shamans (ele shamans are monstrous, but holy paladins are equally insane in that they’re nearly unkillable with sooo, SOOO much more defensive utility and survivability while being very hard to stop from spam healing). PVE wise, alliance has much better locations for end game content, and again has paladins which means that your DPS can let our 30% more damage (not hyper relevant right now but will be very very beneficial in later raids when gear becomes more abundant).
---
Classic is definitely alliance favored in terms of content, and alliance hold advantages in almost all facets besides WPVP where the skirmish-driven horde racials kick ass.
---
Yeah there's no self only enchants in vanilla.
---
Poor research and/or impatience.
---
ass dag bro
---
you need some buffs and maybe some consumables otherwise its not consistent. this was full prebis minus the hoj
---
Selling shit to twinks is where the real money is at.
---
You're not doing a good job blending in, agent. Return to Alliance base immediately.
---
Depends on where the raid meets, and it usually meets in Ironforge, so ye the run can take a while depending on boats.
---
I'd rather the hearth ngl, what guild doesn't have a Mage?
---
So first off alliance don't have an inn in WPL, the closest inn is south shore. Secondly what convenience for BRD? Are you talking about the quest overload for it? If so can you talk about the burning steppes flight path where horde get instant access to librams and all the neural quest?
---
No lmao. Is thunderfury or maladath too slow too? Alcors is shit. This isn't private servers where rage is broken.
---
No tank will invite a dps warrior to groups if they need items. Just learn to tank or pick a different class.
---
Haha...rekt.
---
why not just by 2 felcloth, and then sell the mooncloth on the ah
---
thanks.
---
so if i leave, and the rest of the group finish, that updates my ID correct?
---
Your best bet is to just level up on both factions if you care enough. As someone who has, Horde have it better.
---
Let’s just wait til TBC where the factions were totally and completely balanced! /s
---
Eye if killrog can do it faster
---
honestly this is better than the star wars font I always see here.
---
No there are no statistics for this. Having said that I suspect faerlina is one of the more balanced servers.
---
If a Warrior Faps i Invul pot or sheep and reset.
---
Warriors don’t beat mages 1v1
---
So they have to open everyone elses locks too? time is money, friend
---
It's the Onyxia chain on alliance, basically. Time to take the fight to the black dragonflight!
---
Edit: If you want to wade through a wall of text I wrote one up in a reply to someone else. Just check the header for part 3.
---
That's actually insane!
---
I reckon the only consume that makes a huge difference is Restoration Potion for Luci. But mostly because it is the first boss and if most of the raid has one it can be a big ego boost for the guild to crush the first boss if they are new in there.
---
But then, I remember being a Mage in a PUG back in the day where every ounce of mana was for Decursing, or we would wipe. Gamers.
---
he said ama
---
What video card do you have?
---
Alliance 1-30 is great IMO, but then it gets bad post 30. IMO as someone whos leveled two alliance characters to 60 twice now, 30-44 is the absolute worst , but then it picks up again with tanaris and feralas until 48, searing gorge, BRD, burning steppes felwood etc.
---
Caveat here is threat gear is often dps oriented, and still good for tanks. I'm going to be rolling vs rogues for several pieces. They arent the bis for mitigation, but you trade a Tiny percentage in mitigation for a giant dps (and thus threat) bonus.
---
I'd even take a WC port
---
wasnt this whole thing about questing?
---
You just set your hearth to kargath and the alliance brm bias is mute
---
Mate, I am max level and have been there, I said in a post on this thread already I am one of the hardcore gamers, I just see the reasoning behind the wait. People have lives, and responsibilities I’m sorry you have to sit on your ass all day making up stories and don’t experience going outside or doing anything that doesn’t involve the click clack of your keyboard.

True, but Jaina comes to *you.*
---
Copy and pasting his tldr for you:
---
TL;DR Even though Alliance has better low lvl zones, Horde has an edge in all zones past barrens, with better positioned hubs and more quests available. 
---
I leveled alliance to 60 and to lvl 20ish as a horde warrior and pretty much agree with him, barrens was kill this and that, while duskwood, redridge and wetlands were the most fun ive had playing the game, but lvl 30 ish on quests for alliance are far out, with almost every zone having no inn or a fp far away from the quest areas. It averages out at lvl 50 tho, but having no major city in kalimdor +Kargath inn gives horde a big advantage
---
What ui is this?
---
I dunno about everyone else but I'd rather play in a toxic group where everyone is proficient and knows their role and flames whenever someone makes a mistake than be in a group with nice guys who have no idea what they're doing
---
So then whats the problem with having Pre TBC talent trees?
---
Huge fan of classicwow.live.
---
Thunderfury is too slow. The only reason it's good is because of the proc doing outrageous amounts of threat. Maladath is good because of human weapon expertise and the raw weapon damage. Slow weapons suck because if you're dodged/parried then you're going long periods of time not gaining rage. Miss your first auto on a raid boss? No rage and the dps immediately pull aggro and die.
---
I like dustwallow, but there is a huge difference between getting the quests to overlap properly and not, and getting them to overlap is not intuitive.
---
&gt; I'm never the type to limit myself to a single playstyle.
---
&gt; But for mages as a class, i only liked fire.
---
You must see how these two statements are at odds
---
Maladath is good for the +swords. It is 'slow' but worth it. Also Parry is better than an armor buff. But that is not out yet. And anyway for damage and threat in BWL tanks get the Nef axe.
---
The speed of the dagger is to provide more heroic strikes rage dumps between your other abilities, as well as more swings for more rage.
---
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOOLOLOOLOLOLOLOLLO
---
If those weren't rare AF you'd be living in a very small world very quick.
---
Kara is my all-time favorite raid.
---
Don't post false information
---
True, it's better with faster weapons, but overall it's still a lackluster talent.
---
If you max it you add 0.4 rage points per hit on average. But you don't hit every swing, especially not when dual wielding, so the actual benefit is even lower.
---
The elite orcs castle, cave and town. Even though they have no quest the horde have a similar strength of units as lakeshire
---
 I also prefer the alliance races.
---
So downranking is still good right now, but not necessarily for the same reasons as it is later.
---
Right now downranking is great because people don't really have that much HP, and overhealing is a sin you must never commit. Rank 4 healing touch with a bit of +healing will be enough to keep most of the squish dps up. Max rank healing touch is p much exclusively for the tank. Always remember the five second rule, and try to get as much mana regening midfight as you can.
---
Noticed you’re forgetting the unequivocal best pvp racial in the game in that self circlejerk buddy. Escape artist is absolutely nuts 
---
Also the dwarf racial autowins rogue vs rogue fights, or at least forces CDs. Warstomp is meh for anyone that isn’t an ele shaman, and WOTF is the most overrated racial in the game (good vs locks and ok vs priests if you’re a rogue... don’t need it if you’re a warrior with zerker rage and casters usually don’t get feared by a priest unless you ignore the priest walking up to you)
---
Agree to disagree
---
Yeah this, why making it difficult with selling the cd.
---
If you want quick money just put it on the AH with a large undercut.
---
Believe I have Intel UHD Graphics 620
---
Thanks for elaborating. Maybe I will do the same.

He didnt say he was completely losing interest, just said he was bored playing solo, and yeah this game is a lot more fun with others so i understand that.
---
Please stop laughing at droods :(
---
I'm so glad I didnt take any time off of work for release. Would take a screenshot of my quests then plan my route while at work. When I was playing it was pure action and went very quickly.
---
I reported it as a bug lol.
---
didn't even know I could go up stairs and still get the rested! I kept leaving the zone!
---
False thanks
---
Guild name checks out.

I'd still choose Alliance even if we didn't have a single Quest in the entire Game!

I read "furries" at first. So as a bear tank, I got a bit annoyed at the accusation.

Question about professions and when you can learn them.
---
I notice you can learn skinning, first aid and cooking and level 1. But you can’t learn leatherworking or finishing until level 5.
---
Where can I see a full list of which professions you can learn at level 1, level 5 and anything else?
---
I can tank but it seems like people are always complaining. I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. I think I'm getting too old for video games.
---
You need 3-4 hits to even hope to do one sunder with an alcors.. for rage dump sure alcors is great for that but all tank weapons are in the same like 1.8-2.2 speeds for a reason.. even a Crul at 2.3 is amazing..
---
REALLY good rewards too.

\+20 attack power trinket with +1% chance to hit. I'm still using it at level 58 on my hunter!

Seriously this is why I'm so sad we're not getting classic+. Just brining the alliance up to parity in places like this would be awesome and completely in line with vanilla design. It's nothing major, just giving the Wildhammer tribe a few more quests for Jin'tha would be great.
---
I've been looking to jump into classic and would be happy to play on any server with op as well :D
---
I am not understanding. How do you get water essences in water walk casts?
---
Some thoughts;
---
What is the comparison of Alliance to Horde dungeon quests?
---
Zeppelin positioning isn’t a zone choice; it’s a continental one. The fact Grom’gol has a transportation hub doesn’t affect my personal assessment of STV—they’ve gotta fly in somewhere. 
---
Similarly, I always viewed Kargath as a supporting town to help access Blackrock Mountain. The reason Ironforge was *the* classic Alliance city was because of its launching points to major endgame content. Horde had to shimmy and slither their way to a great many things, whereas I only remember struggling to do the Azshara world dragon on Alliance.
---
Inequality is one of the things that makes vanilla vanilla. There was no desire to make things equal just for the sake of it. I do find some areas strangely favoured though - Horde have a hub in Badlands while Alliance have a tent, campfire and 2 Dwarves, Camp Mojache in Feralas being so dominant in an area where Night Elves historically thrived and an environment where Night Elves continue to be extremely well adapted to.
---
Looking at "equal for equals sake" in retail really tires me out and makes everything so generic - Alliance lose Darnassus, so Horde *must* lose Undercity. Horde lost Vol'jin, so Alliance *must* lose Varian (or someone or similar standing). Horde lose Saurfang, and Alliance are in the process of losing Tyrande. Similar story for all Allied Races that have been released where when one faction gets a race, the other faction must get one too.
---
I feel this even looking at TBC. Look how Hellfire/Zangarmarsh hubs literally just mirror one another; it feels so forced and boring. Do note that I'm not saying it's one of the things that make vanilla *good*, but it's just a very iconic feature of RPGs of olde.
---
Except Rebel Point not having an FP. Fuck you on that one Blizzard, everytime I have to make a run back through STV I hate my life.
---
Obviously they do have pros and cons and have a very different target audience, 
---
So get off your elitist high mounts.
---
Yeah but the problem with more raids is the way it’s set up, it makes previous raid gear somewhat obsolete therefore making it so more geared players don’t wanna do old stuff and new players makes it harder for them to form groups for it and less incentive too as well. BGs holding off in my opinion is done because once honor is brought to the game gank parties will increase 10x so that in turn will make it hard for the slower levelers and in the long run make them quit.
---
Calculate the price of all the mats and see if it’s less that 1.5k and just buy them that way, but I would never pay that much
---
That’s why I left it combined lol
---
I totally agree with this. I have started my third Horde character and love it. My Alliance Pally is dormant.
---
Yeah, but SFK and SM are awesome and worth the trip. Gnomeregan is awful.
---
You do realize that every server has a different economy, correct? Also, using booty bay gazette or even google would provide you with the answers you are looking for
---
I read a few weeks ago that many Alliance put their Hearth at Menethil (I always set mine to BBay prior) and I can see why. Nestled nicely between Lordaeron and the southern kingdoms while also having a boat taking you to the effective heart of Kalimdor or Darkshore pier
---
You should just buy 2 felcloth and then sell the mooncloth.... ? ? ? ? ? ?  
---
Why go to the trouble of including a middle man just so he can skim your profits?
---
look at nestingwary's eye, the cold, dead stare of an emotionless killer.
---
You need players to fill raid groups on retail. If you lose half your raid to classic then there's a pretty good chance your guild will die as a result. Some players aren't interested in classic and if their guild dies a portion of them can't be assed to find a new one and just quit the game altogether. Classic is actively cannibalizing retail. In the long term they need to move towards improving retail or things won't get any better for them.
---
Any other free guide recommendations?
---
It's a BoE, not craftable.
---
Also you can grab the quest "sweet amber"
---
that screenshot made me feel for the priest. that was probably half their mana.
---
Cool idea!
---
Oh, well ignore me then!
---
Blackstone ring dropped in my first Princess run and I won the roll for it.
---
That's not even getting into the fact that Netherguarde isn't a real town. The mobs there aren't flagged for PvP and just wander around. it's literally a horde grinding zone that blizzard dropped a handful of useful NPC's into.
---
What the fuck? I'm alliance, do we have something like that?
---
I'm on Whitemane, and what I said could've applied early on in the server where not many people have the recipe
---
Now that is ultimate luck
---
I am surprised at asking price for some items as well but then I look up mats on AH and then calculate the cost. It’s usually fair based upon cost of components, time, and scarcity of the product itself. If your the only one with clean water ppl gonna pay
---
LOL.
---
Lol, your best argument involves 2 mid 20s dungeons?
---
Just fuck all the end game shit that’s right outside your door, the dungeons that people will run more than twice while leveling are totally fucking invalid.
---
You are forgetting the main point to all of this.
---
**Blizzard isn't what is used to be.**
---
The developers and team members that made *World Of Warcraft* are mostly no longer even working for the current Activision-Blizzard. 
---
**And I have ZERO faith that Activision-Blizzard can make something that has the same feel and play-through style as Classic does from scratch.** 
---
Classic+ would be cool, but even if it does happen it won't be true to Vanilla and Classic, I would bet my nutsack they will make changes "they believe are better and more inline with how the game should play". And that'll be your Classic+ a new, different, painful death into something similar to current retail.
---
If they could make something that would be as popular as Vanilla wow was and currently is, retail wouldn't be in its current state.
---
Why are you being such an ass all over this thread lmao.
---
Wtf hey that's a ret paladin weapon
---
?
---
They are extremly overpowered and not anymore balanced
---
What make many specs viable in BC also comes from new spells and gear
---
And I love you, random citizen!
---
Implying you can't 2H tank past lvl 20 and until something like 58.
---
&gt;Yeah, LFR doesn't titanforge to mythic my dude.
---
No, Battlefronts. I've never done LFR, I didn't include it in the argument you're addressing.
---
&gt;LOL, because classic WoW didn't have instances right? 
---
I think we're done here. That's enough bad faith for me. If you're gonna just shoot arguments past me there's seriously no point.
---
Gotcha
---
Thanks for the advise, I will do it sometime soon !
---
I followed him around. He patrols from the crashed plane in your screenshot to the top of the mountain.
---
The patches of water require either: swimming all around, or as a shaman, I just use water walk. I got lucky one day and got essences out of every single spot, about one a minute.
---
imo the entire game felt like this, at least to me, until Cataclysm release. Both gameplay and storytelling.
---
I honestly think that's a great idea. Take all the hotdogs of traveling and make them more fluid and obviously used.
---
Can u not read ??? Lmfao. I used the word But, which means a difference is to come. Like jesus christ be a nitpick if u want but it's getting u nothing. I do not limit myself when I play games I use different vehicles, guns, perks, builds. Whatever the case is. BUT in this very specific situation I'm finding that I did not enjoy frost or arcane, at all. I only liked blizzards design of fire for mages. There. Are u happier with the clarity provided for you personally ?
---
It's just to balance out the Raven Hill runs Alliance has to do for Duskwood.
---
Nobody tell him about how all of the original main developers all said they only played Horde, and how all of the story writers only enjoyed writing for the Horde side, and how the plotline for all of the following expansions became steadily more and more Horde focused till BfA was entirely horde focused and the alliance was simply a background role.
---
Yeah, we're all aware they claimed it was a final rush job that caused the initial imbalance. Unfortunately the following 15 years of development put that into question pretty heavily.
---
Is he speaking in Engrish?
---
No, just unzip them all at once and you re good to go
---
Depends on how quickly you want the mount. I would say so long as your not taking a huge loss, then its worth it. Movement speed is one of the most important things in Wow, questing, grinding, leveling. If you can hold off you can make a bit more gold from those sales. You could prob easily get 10g from quests between 39-40.
---
He didn't even hit his target.... he casted it as he was standing. Like it's a large area and he misses ? And again, I get the dmg before slow factor... but the mob was literally nonthreatening. So wouldn't u use a faster and less mana expensive rotation to continue ur horrid grinding and questing ? I think so. Or maybe u prefer downtime drinking all day ?
---
lol wot
---
I agree with your concerns. I wonder if a good way to do this would be up just start giving talents at level 1 instead of waiting until level 10.
---
If I had 9 or 10 more talent points, I can see a ton of new play styles becoming viable and that's really exciting.
---
As far the new spells, make them drop in karazhan just like DM and AQ added new class quests/abilities.
---
Official site says it’s supported.  Do you have a separate dedicated video card or only that on-board?
---
Bullshit about dustwallow. You have to be out of your mind.
---
true - with the info from above i'm actually thinking of giving up my paladin....manually tracking uptime and coordinating buffs sucks. especially for small buffs
---
Well, do they speak German? Or did you coordinate servers earlier, knowing that you specificaly can't communicate in that language? I'm sorry, but being mad at people on a German server for expecting you to be able to communicate is dickish to say the least.
---
The World is so full of idiots. (And i dont think OP is one..)
---
Sincerely,
---
A german Player
---
well you will need it once bloodvine is in game
---
Seriously no one got the joke, I kept scrolling to see if anyone would have anything light hearted to say lol
---
Zul'Aman was arguably the best 10-man raid ever, it was an enormous step up in difficulty from Karazhan (which wasn't a faceroll raid by any means). The concept of hard trash practically arose from it.
---
In Kara, every boss had 1 or 2 predictable abilities, everything else depended on whether you could finish them off before enrage or not. In Zul'Aman, you could be wiped in seconds even on trash if your raid made a single mistake. I still remember our first wipes there, it was horrible, yet amazing. The experience either destroyed guilds or bound them together harder than ever.
---
25-man raids though, not so much of a step-up from vanilla, you get the number of people and you rock. Even for tanks, you collect your FR/NR gear, you build up your stamina set for Kael, and you're good to go. Sadly I wasn't around for BT/MH/Sunwell, but for all I've heard it wasn't much different, just tougher in terms of item level required.
---
Because I’ve played both factions. Mostly horde
---
Unit frame addon? perplexity doesn't have one from what I've understand, and every unit fram addon I google on are damn excessive.. any clue?
---
*sploosh* awww yeah I love when the wageys bust out the "reality" card keep going baby
---
While the information may be outdated, it will help someone become more informed - this seems more useful to me than your suspicion.
---
rofl, this is sad to watch
---
Got...Damn!!
---
It would be easier to go through the portal and get your char automatically copied to a BC server. People would be able to enjoy both games to their fullest.
---
Yeah, classic will be worse for the same reasons.
---
Except you still outnumber alliance on almost every pvp server
---
Yeah I think that’s good advice, thanks!
---
My concern is not being able to deal with 2 or more mobs without blade flurry
---
The context is an Open World MMORPG on a realm with PvP ruleset.
---
Yes, it's been a common thing in the past to get ragnaros or whatever other last boss kills stolen this way if some guild invited pugs to fill in slots.
---
The is a bug atm that makes you saved with mc when you enter it even if no one in your group is saved and no boss is being killed. Don't risk to waste your cd
---
Yes, the bosses won't be there for you anymore
---
I know you're mostly asking about rogues, but I'll answer from the Enhancement Shaman perspective. There are two reasons to prefer a slow weapon as a shaman.
---
First, storm strike is a free weapon swing, and has a 20 second cooldown no matter what you're swinging. Therefore, you get the most dps out of storm strike by swinging the slowest possible weapon because these weapons will do the most damage per swing. It also helps with on hit procs, but those are very weapon specific.
---
Second is that unpredictable burst damage is very effective in PvP. Windfury will have the same dps increase on a fast or slow weapon (~45%) but a proc on a slow weapon can do half of the enemy's total HP in an instant. This makes it harder to time counters and widens the potentially lethal hp range.
---
Felcloth set is also good + bags
---
I've been using Sage Guide with Guidelime. I don't have much time to play so it's nice to log on and know exactly what I need to do next.
---
Yep, for these reasons BC is pretty clearly a superior experience than Classic imo.
---
Fair Point
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
Def
---
Warrior just ding 44 and I can replace my WW axe to this [sword](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9418/stoneslayer). I'm not sure if its worth it, giving i also spec axe specialties so I'm losing 5% crit as well.
---
Yeah someone convinced us to all level alliance, then stopped playing. We all continued to level and now nobody wants to play anymore because alliance is so terrible by comparison. The entire leveling experience is atrocious.
---
I saw sum line wrist guards drop Friday and lost to a resto druid 
---
Still upset about that
---
What's the first 10 minute buff?
---
Horde
---
Fear Ward, only Dwarf Priests have it
---
It honestly feels like alliance are the ones invading a new planet.
---
Damn, back at it again ;)
---
You can have some zones, but, you gotta pay the same price the horde paid. One dead warchief per zone won.
---
or a sea of sun-bleached bones scattered throughout the distance in the background.
---
This guy twinks.
---
You need a swing timer in a slam build to keep track of your next swing so you can judge whether to wait for bloodthirst if its up on next gcd etc
---
2h fury kinda sucks tbh. Get mirahs song and thrash blade and fuck shit up.
---
Lol what are you even saying? Did you have a stroke during that fit of rage?
---
Really good guide that even has class-specific quests integrated smartly into it.
---
meh. It's a pvp world, can't complain about getting camped
---
And it sounds like you don't understand how things work or how to comprehend what you read.
---
I literally died when I saw that. So. Yup.
---
&gt;people who hate on gnomes are all circlejerking hipsters
---
That requires you to go to both Swamp of Sorrows and Desolace (!) before *returning to Duskwood* to hand it in.
---
Yea I'm actually looking forward to trying to tank with a shaman.
---
Would Mirah Song + TB be better damage wise than Earthshaker?
---
30 seconds to trade a few stacks when they are sitting in a city doing nothing anyways.. nah
---
As often as I get ganked by alliance 15-20 levels above me or while I'm defenseless pulling mobs on a quest, this makes me happy.
---
Wait. I’m leveling a rogue for soloing and gold farming. Is this a mistake?
---
For the horde!
---
All the time :D i tell them if a raid of warriors and rogues can clear MC in 19 minutes, I can wear wildheart :)
---
Pisses me off meme specs are a thing.  I wish Blizzard made every class balanced from the start. It be awesome to see more balance druids and ret pally's around
---
Yup thats what happened. Sorry lol
---
But can you fish from it?
---
[SilverDragon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/silver-dragon) has a classic version.
---
With my repair costs I lose gold every single dungeon unless there are zero wipes, it's pretty shit
---
Yes. Or get MH Dal’rend + Mirah Song
---
Lol at least you found 40 groups.. can’t even find one as a rogue
---
Took me 11 lbrs runs for shoulders :(
---
Just buy a decent tablet. Ishit is good for nothing.
---
Surface 3 Dell venue 11...
---
That would be true if phase 2 didn't involve every level 60 on a pvp server camping level 48s for honor. I would much rather have the max level players wait then have the pre level 5p players quit
---
Can we seriously stop nitpicking things and calling them far right or racist? Shit is getting old.
---
Fack remastered, just lack of imagination, we go ahead not backwards
---
so that nvidia card you posted there is apparently one of the worst cards still available by nvidia lol
---
Horde have no reason to ever even be there other than screwing around, while if the barrens was contested you would end up with a lot of ganking as higher level alliance run through there to get to other places. Even as it is TN lift is often heavily camped by alliance making going there really annoying as horde.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
I’m pointing out that it isn’t “an easy run” to this dungeon because of dicks who have nothing better to do than to engage in PvP in which they have little to no danger of losing.
---
Man, back in vanilla my guild got through MC, AQ, ZG and halfway through naxx content just using the chat box. I don’t see what the big deal is. They should be able to make an exception for him.
---
Also, the priest was a dwarf. \*shivers\*
---
Yeah I agree. I just could see the options upsetting people. 
---
I figured they would let us copy one character. But then people who have two or three characters might get upset.
---
I just think there isn't one option that makes everyone happy.
---
So far I’m level 57 farming pre raid bis.  I have rolled a one on anything worth more than 15 gold.  I have had groups with no loot competition on bosses like prince in dire maul west who has 2 items both like 22% chance to drop and they just won’t.  Ran it like 5 times and not shockingly didn’t see any gear.  I’m in like 10 greens and I just want ONE of my drops off my list of like a million things I need.  I’m also doing brd, dm north, etc.
---
Broke my rule and joined a group with loot competition and had one of my items finally drop and actually won a roll.  Then ran dm north and got my next one.  Finally a start.
---
It doesn't matter if he started the conversation or not, Classic is all about interaction so at some point you'll want to speak to other people. Forcing them to speak english with you on a german realm is mostly considered rude, even though most germans are very capable of speaking english. This was the whole gist about blizz announcing all-eu servers before classic launch, it was disastrous. Maybe reconsider your choice with your friends, or live with the consequences.
---
* V
---
* Ctrl + V 
---
* Alt + V
---
All modify the nameplates by default. You can find interact with Target under Targeting in Keybinds.
---
Still works just different melee range for both NPC and the player. Perhaps do some research before you make a fool out of yourself.
---
Blizzard felt bad for the green piles of rage and indecency eating their own boogers in mud huts, hence the facts you stated.
---
Annnd then theres alterac valley BG that had the most well known and well documented Alliance bias, period :)
---
I recall a designer saying that each side had a degree of favoritism in zones - horde had stonetalon as a early ‘mostly for horde’ and Alliance had another zone like that for their side. Then some zones would be a little slanted one way, again same for other side. Ie - alliance Can go to stoneton but generally shouldnt. Theres definitely a couple of those on each side
---
Generally the alliance questing is supposed to be story superior as they spent more time at it. Its horde where it was rushed and they dumped more in (see Kalimdor) .. not sure if one is easier but alliance was supposed to be more pollished if not easier 
---
An interesting case study for sure
---
As a healer, sometimes I'll pull an extra pat or pack just to bring some emotion to the game. It's fun when its challenging. Ofc I only do it when I know I can keep the group alive.
---
I love the feeling of being almost dead and oom and killing that last mob.
---
Uhh, there's no welfare that'l skip you right to Naxx and invalidate all the previous content. There's always a reason to do all content as a fresh player and a progression curve that is somewhat linear.
---
If you're bored of farming ZF/DME, mages can solo princess for 60g an hour as fire
---
I had 3-4 kills and both swords pre 60. I honestly got lucky until MC and Ony where it took me 4 weeks to win anything.
---
Well I learned skinning, first aid and cooking at level 3 last night. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
you also have to delete your hearthstone if its off cooldown, otherwise it just ports you back to your inn.
---
The equation proves that even if you sack your dps by stacking r1 frostbolts, the overall damage is worse with r1 rather than going with max rank. So in this case, it's more benifitial for the overall damage to have the WC mage go max rank.
---
Tell me about it, spent over 1k already easily haha
---
It's not like DM and stockades are easily accessible for the horde, stop cherry picking.
---
Not really a lot German has English roots
---
Found your problem, boss.
---
Put people you like playing with on your friends list.
---
Organise groups off your friends list.
---
If the tank, the healer and one of the DPS all like how each other plays, the culture gets set pretty fast.
---
2H fury is kind of a meme alliance side, most raids will have one just to use the weapon Nightfall once it comes out in phase 3, but other than that I would recommend giving dual wield fury a try or going arms for 2h. 
---
2H fury miiiiight do more damage than arms in pve, but with the same build you could do way more damage dual wielding, and arms in the king of pvp
---
Secondary professions are at level 1. Primary ones are at 5. At level 35 you can max out a profession.
---
the heroes we need but don't deserve
---
Running SM full clear, charge 5g per person, or all cloth drops, as well as your fair roll on items.  You can potentially do this in around 90mins.
---
The sunwell patch was a bit of a disaster for the long term health of the game, but it was supposed to be big enough to tide over to the Wrath.
---
MGT is amazing, but in general I think the fun of TBC will be pretty much entirely before sunwell patch.
---
There should always be a deep frost spec mage in raids for winters chill? I believe. That always allows for more damage from frost bolt. while all others should be full arcane with a handful of points in frost. Check out icy veins website for a raid specific mage spec. Should be Arcane/Frost.
---
This ahckshually makes alliance leveling easier.  Especially 10-30.
---
Geronimo
---
ghould for you
---
You’re a douche. The absolute worst type of WOW player.
---
Lol Powerword shield alone cuts nearly half our mana
---
Honestly kind of annoying that you can get banned at all for killing players in a spot that bugs out guards, that was my favorite thing to do over in ironforge, jump up above the bank and see how many people I could fireball before alliance killed me.     
---
A lot of people seem to pick pvp server without a pvp mentality at all.
---
Not to mention you needed a LOT of badges for some of the good stuff, probably upwards of 600-700 to get everything you might need assuming you didn't have something better from hyjal or BT.
---
Shadow power drakestone in 31 runs
---
This guy’s a fuckup for sure. But we’re not all like this.
---
I use grid, its a bit suboptimal for healing but who gives a fuck
---
Warlock so dosent count
---
Has no flight path or inn tho
---
Nah, I started with BC. Wrath was significantly more enjoyable for me from a visual, storytelling, and design standpoint.
---
You're implying there are no serious warriors deep prot.
---
There are plenty of very competent players downing all available content in a single raid night without being fury prot.
---
Fury prot is only objectively better if your DPS pushes you beyond the threat you can produce with a standard shield slam build. If you have no threat problems and can have beeter mitigation then that's objectively better.
---
Aren't 21 frost dmg bracers still better for pve?
---
If I fly to Chillwind Camp in WPL, kill myself, then run to SM and enter the instance, do I spawn in the instance or do I spawn back at Chillwind Camp’s spirit healer?
---
It's almost as if we havent known this for 15 years
---
The problem with burning crusade for me was I spent half the expansion getting to 60
---
Lmfao if you think this game has nothing to talk about then I feel kinda bad for ya. I really really hope you aren't one playing it... cause that'd be embarrassing af.
---
I'm levelling with a few friends and the only reason we rolled horde is the easier time of running instances.
---
When I started mograine had the highest alliance % at like 49 for a pvp server so thats why I chose the server.
---
The only reason that sucks is that the guards don't properly identify the aggressor, so if you fight back they jump you instead...
---
Reroll if you're unhappy. I did.  Left a 60 and a 38 on another server for a new one.  Lvl  50 now.  Its much faster leveling the second time around. I highly recommend a good speed leveling addon. I hit 40 in half the time this time around. 
---
You have time.  All that truly matters is that you're 60 before p2. I wouldn't wait much longer though.
---
You should mention what class you are :)
---
i play a gnome when i roll alli, theyre still ugly af. so is every race in classic
---
A spiritual victory.
---
i would Not Go for a Slam Spec. Just Spam hamstring to get wF proccs
---
“Devout” + High Spirit
---
Magister's, Dreadmist, Devout, Necrophile, mix and match pieces from those sets to get what you need.
---
This community is so toxic, holy shit. If you don’t want to get ganked for no reason you’re a “filthy casual”.
---
If alliance 2h fury is not very viable because you don't have WF. I assume you are alliance based on comments about Mirah's and Thrash Blade.
---
Go to classic folder right click wow icon (not wow launcher) and select run with graphics card processer, then choose integrated graphics . Worked for me
---
Ogre one? 
---
Refresh my memory please.
---
Looks just like me.
---
Yes.
---
But they don't include the path
---
Funny that you use the word toxic in your post because you seem like a toxic ass person.
---
No I am Horde
---
Honestly I’m actually leveling quite fast using Judgement’s paladin speed leveling guide. If you are alliance I’d recommend at least checking it out.
---
The only downside is he uses a ton of what he calls “breadcrumb quests” where they are picked up in one zone, done in another, and turned in at a later time on your way through a third.
---
Rogues are probably middle of the pack in terms of leveling speed, not bad but not top tier either. You can really only fight multiple mobs when you have AR and blade flurry up.
---
I think part of the reason it seems to work is that both paladins and rogues are single target levelers with similar strengths; able to go from mob to mob with relatively little down time. Rogue just does it all a bit faster obviously.
---
The guide is made for paladins but anyone can follow it.
---
Then why didn’t he include WPL?
---
Yes I just enchanted my gear after that.  You can enchant your own stuff the just keep over writing it.  Sometimes I'd check for cheap greens on the AH to help get some mats.
---
Lol wtf
---
&gt; DS leather was sky high because the zerg was in need of DS set.
---
Leather = skinning
---
&gt; Farming DS leather is also hands down the most fun way to farm for me. 
---
= Skinning
---
It's really not that hard, you failed and now are trying to be pedantic about it to try to cover the fail. It is not working buddy. The profit of leatherworking is so marginal, especially when considering the fact you have to level it 1-300 and via a very contested gimmick nonetheless. 
---
You could've had 10000 gold easily if you took herbing or mining as secondary, and most of that 3000 gold came from skinning and not leatherworking.
---
Now stop the embarrassing replies.
---
Then... I'd have to drink... and that would slow down the tank... the actual player who "sets the pace".
---
But look, if you are such a great Warlock that you demonstrably do have an obvious effect on the speed of the run, I will heal you.
---
If I don't see your performance, sorry but you might wanna pill up or life drain.
---
Wanting to start an ally on EU PvP server. What realm is best for ally, Shazzrah, Firemaw, Gehennas or Mograine?
---
Half? More like two drinks 😂
---
I mean Warrior can be tough, but 2H is the easiest way to be a warrior.
---
pretty shit bank considering the alternatives.
---
then quit its not rocket science. you chose to play in a shitty server so you reap what you sow. theres a reason people waited in 15k queues for a month for high pop servers until they died down. you chose to play a dps warrior (which no other tank wants in group). all of these are your decisions- you screwed it for yourself tbh. dont blame the game you got bigger problems if you leveled to 57 and didnt enjoy it at all. theres alliance on Herod that get ganked 24/7 (almost 90% of the time they cant even run BRD, etc.) but they still find reason and fun in playing.
---
Those aren’t horde orcs
---
Yeah, dude. Horde were massively favored in Vanilla lmao
---
Ouch that stung
---
For raiding you’ll have to go combat because hemo strike takes a debuff slot, but leveling sub shouldn’t be tooooo much slower than combat (about 15% slower or so is what I’ve heard).
---

---
I like how much your work has been coming up at around the same pace as my main has been (slowly [damn you alt army!]) progressing through the game. Just starting to work my way through here and it's a blast. Love your style!
---
wouldnt this be a pathing exploit and bannable?
---
Was it 1k? It's been like 10 years so my bad
---
The fact that no one felt they could speak up and suggest maybe you should do something different instead of wipe for 4 hours sounds a bit toxic to me. Lol.
---
Warriors on pservers were to the point of using /sit auto crit macros to generate rage. Fury tanks only have crushing protection with shields up (where they get less threat than a bear)
---
Crushing blows arent going to 1 shot a bear. You're near or fully armor capped in blues, with 1k or more hp over a warrior. As long as your healers are awake you are going to be fine
---
o god that is horrible. There are a lot of long runs where the mount speeds it up considerably.
---
Horde questlines have a lot more "frontier" issues.
---
You know what I mean though, adding one extra tank per raid (but then doubling it for Naxx) means you hardly need any kind of tank population for raiding
---
This sounds like some alliance whining to me
---
It’s because I got all of the cancer in my group yesterday.
---
You used Hamstring spam?
---
Uh... the lvl 40 mount totally is.
---
You forgot to mention your server.
---
Yes....yes a truth serum...that's what they're working on
---
Hmmm... no, real healers in game and IRL know abou Triage, some players are lost causes.
---
Don't get me wrong though, if the lock is doing like 40% of your groups damage, heal them. In classic you have to conserve mana, so healing any braindead NPC is going to tax your mana and attention.
---
Thanks, im really looking forward to main a bear now. I’m levelling as cat dps at the moment but will reconsider the chance of being main tank
---
Is this a laptop or desktop and have you had an extra monitor plugged in? If its a laptop depending on extra monitor or not and battery life it can swap from dedicated graphics to integrated graphics which are usually intel.
---
Aaah the joy of being shadow and horde...
---
Yeah, you definitely did it early. At this point 60s are trying to get their last bits of gear and will drop group for taking too long.
---
But why would you willingly make a female cow?
---
Played vanilla from dec '04 on, never saw a single boe epic world drop not in a raid. So far in Classic I've had 11 drop. I've only won 3 of them but they were all 200-400g.
---
Dagger rogues are the most fun.
---
Theres nothing like sneaking up on some asshole warlock when theyre like 85% and cold blood ambush them into ressing
---
Vanish, premed 
---
Repeat
---
/Cackle
---
Is this better to level with as a 55 mage instead of Lashers?
---
Who's Asmongold?
---
I kept putting a hunters pet to sleep on the boat, then some guards shot me, i swam away till they got bored.
---
I wish more people knew this
---
Scarlet Monastery is next to a goddamn horde capital city...
---
As a dwarf priest with low intellect because I’m a shadow priest, my buffs cost 60% of my mana so I better be receiving some detect invisibly for my peril
---
is zerking that big of a deal? in raids and stuff I figure that you'd get healed whenever you get low HP so you don't really ever get more than 10% cast speed which knocks like .2 seconds off your frostbolts.
---
True...
---
It can trigger my heal reflexes too.
---
AND vastly higher frame rates!
---
I mean yes you can grind to 25 in barrens, but you'd run out of quests. Most people go to stonetalon before 20 and ashenvale shortly after. If there was enough quests in barrens to lvl 10-25 there I'd totally agree with this point, but I don't think it's 100% fair. Though it's obviously still advantageous because you do end up spending more time in a non-contested zone than alliance thanks to barrens.
---
If you got semi decent gear your good to run mc and ony
---
Seams like the way to farm gold for rogue is pick pocketing runs in brd? And if keys are cheap on th ah buying those to open chests. Its what I am planning on doing when I hit 60. Open world mob grinding or solo dungeon running there are better classes to that on. Depends on what you wanna do on an alt tho.
---
Yeah but he claimed there was an inn. There isn't. Undercity is way closer than whatever the closest Alliance inn is. Also walking around Andorhal is a giant pain in the ass.
---
I always go dagger, but will not start my rogue alt until P2.
---
I was about to farm them... Then got PB and CHT in my first MC. Let's gooooooooo
---
I mean you say that, but I'm still right with regards to every mechanic in every encounter, and all the ways to get there being completely solved. It's a 15 year old game and it will never change. No need to be insecure over the fact that people have figured it out.
---
Personally I prefer alliance
---
Cut out the middle man and farm crap loads of felcloth in azshara
---
100% profit
---
Maybe you fit better to the "later on" stage of World of Warcraft and Classic isn't for you then.
---
https://youtu.be/RWubkbIbrj0
---
Is the fury way a bad way? Should I buy some AH itens?
---
Hidden enemies is pretty good, not sure if it's as good as the defias/vc chain, but definitely worth checking out for the story, even though it peters out after rfc, despite thrall saying that the shadow council is the main enemy every time you talk to him even when you're doing the Onyxia chain (which is also good although possibly not as good as the alliance version)
---
can anyone confirm that this works?
---
Redridge and Dusk wood don't count. They're basically alliance only zones but blizz made them contested because of level range. Meanwhile horde can hide in the Barrens until late 30s if they really wanted to.
---
He also didnt talk about dungeons for the most part, which is laughably in Hordes favor.
---
Like they can even get to Gomer more easily than Alliance for example, its a joke.
---
That was well before naxx wasn’t it?
---
You ever find anything?
---
Or open up new raids and content in classic that don't change mechanics. Stuff that was going on in Azeroth during BC and Wrath back on the two home contents.
---
I guess it's bad from an RPG standpoint to split them up, but from a more fair play perspective it's more fun to split them up. People who are good at PvP shouldn't have to do a thousand other things to do well in PvP. And vice versa. If pve players had to play 1000 hours pvp to clear raids quick, they would be really salty.
---
Man, I got the sword from Baron, it's an objectively terrible OH, but my real one (mirah's song) only gets equipped in raids now.  I use Baron's in dungeons too, it's too cool looking, plus it hangs on your back.
---
Half? More like 3/4ths
---
Fly to Sentinel Hill instead :).
---
When the dungeon becomes safe after a Tribute run, can you loot Knot Thimblejacks cache?
---
I don't know the answer to your question, but im just interested why you would block it when it's something you only see on login
---
It's not a bug, people are just used to private servers cause they never played vanilla.
---
priest Shields absorbed melee crits in vanilla
---
Not only that, just look at the placement of dungeons. Very Horde favourite
---
Stop posting this
---
I can't find it but someone posted there guild recruitment video for incendious. Blows this out of the water.
---
Or Shaman.
---
remind me again which main faction city is closer, orgrimmar or ironforge?
---
which program ur using 2 edit?
---
On hunters, is there any way to make auto shoot happen on right click? instead of it trying to melee?
---
Everything is subjective since these "rules" are established by society and community.
---
1. Yes, all need.
---
2. Yes, all need.
---
Like omg newb its not free i have to pay flight path costs god /S
---
And incase people still try to say shit /S
---
I have run both MC and ony once and now I have Rhok'Delar. Both were random PUGs.
---
Devout means nothing; it's just an item name.
---
It has 15 spirit...but also 24 intellect.
---
It is a generic caster item with generic caster set bonuses that literally all cloth casters benefit from, period.
---
Just because Priests are the only class that can make a t0.5 piece out of it in another 18 months doesn't mean jack shit right now.
---
What is your point?
---
But what of warriors that don’t like tanking?
---
I use two pages and switch between them. Just something I got used to when there wasn't enough room for all warlock spells in vanilla before I knew about bar-addons.
---
Only because the moment you start to flub the grammar all the Germans you were talking to start speaking English.
---
I got the archivist cape of healing. Never thought that would happen 😁
---
Me too! I’m 28 mage, horde too!
---
Ah okay. I smoke too much weed ._.
---
I want to enchant boots with movement speed (minor speed, 8% upgrade), for a new alt, but I can't find the information anywhere : does the enchant bind the item?
---
I searched for a while in google, and I can only find the information that only "certain" enchants bind stuff to their users, but I just can't find which of them...
---
I want to do it on white unbound boots for an alt, and I'm wondering If I could share it with multiple alts.
---
Thank you for your help!
---
It's silly, really. One guy in the guild uses the motd as his own advertising platform, and it just rubs me the wrong way every time i see it. Instead of getting angry, i figure if it's out of sight, it's out of mind, and then he can use it to his heart's content.
---
You gotta go to Teldrassil if you want an owl before mid 40s
---
Otherwise Felwood
---
But druids have actual heals?
---
They get awsome hots and a pretty neat spammble heal that serves them all the way to 60.
---
Their only drawback is group heals and the lack of utility spells like dispell and shackle undead.
---
You gotta make em. Do jed/rend runs, make them yourself and find jed every time. It's high effort but it's the only way.
---
You’re missing that alliance get multiple “contested” starter areas that have no horde quests or reason for horde to be there at that level; Redridge, Duskwood, Loch Modan. Horde get no such special treatment all our zones have Alliance or Neutral quests.
---
They fixed this in retail, you should go back.
---
Sure it is, for those who aren't professional speedrunners or have jobs / kids / etc.
---
Turn off your overlays (Discord, Steam, etc.). I have seen the Discord overlay cause this message when changing graphics settings.
---
I mean, it almost certainly will be TBC.
---
And I was agreeing with you if I didn't make it clear.
---
I have a hunter at 41, and then I started falling asleep leveling it si I rerolled a warrior to 60.
---
Cats have no aoe
---
And why play harder manually making your pet switch targets
---
When you can play smarter and get a pet that can spam a high threat aoe ability
---
Don't hurt me like this pls
---
Yup, but the side gate is the best one to farm. Glad you mentioned it though, because if you’re about to instance lock, what you do is check live side once (near Fras Siabi) before hearthing and trying again later.
---
Where is the alliance inn in wpl?
---
Came here too not convinced devilsaur is worth it, since the hit seems not that good with the new cap.
---
I wrote a guide for solo speed leveling. Did my druid in 4D 10H on launch and am about to finish a warrior in just under 4 days (I did have BIS gear the entire way). I recently updated it too. Read the "read me first". There's a lot of grinding, BUT I give you options so that you don't have to grind one bit. 
---

---
It was a real shame heroics got so easy in wrath that when they tried to get them back to actual challenges in Cataclysm people cried so much Blizzard caved and made them absolute facerolls.
---
It's funny, the Cataclysm Beta is some of the most fun I've had in WoW, but after release Cataclysm is the expansion I played the least.
---
I wish it were that easy. A lot of times you don’t find out people are toxic until the middle of a dungeon, at which point a kick might just mean ‘group over’ and you’re screwing everyone including yourself. Fully get the sentiment though.
---
So... basically cataclysm without the cataclysm
---
Oh wow I had no idea. So let me get this straight private servers dont have this old mechanic?
---
First aid, cooking, mining, skinning, herbing lvl 1. Rest 5.
---
A lot of alliance quests are just right next to a horde town, so you're constantly getting ganked just for trying to turn in.
---
Not false though..  
---
The S-keying PvErs who stomped low geared PuGs during their days off from raids suddenly stopped dueling outside of durotar and were struggling at 1600 rating once resilience came, I do wonder why.
---
Yeah got that
---
Then don't pay the sub fee. It's really that simple, mate.
---
More likely just getting a mage port to UC from someone in the raid
---
how to repost
---
you never been reckbombed in single stun i guess
---
Amazing guide, thank you. There is something I cant seem to find online though. A solid talent spec for being 60 and farming pre-bis items. 
---
Should I using one of the leveling builds, move straight over to a raid spec or is there something else that's best?
---
To build off this even if you're in a guild from the start and are prebis raid week1 it's likely you'll get looked over for the people who were friends with the GM. Merit is not always a consideration for raid tanks
---
U mean lvl 60 alies ganking lowbies?
---
why is that BS? Ashenvale isnt an ally-only zone in any way. In a lot of ways its the most contested zone in the game. and btw horde have 2 fp's there, one on the beach and one in splintertree outpost
---
apparently they eventually patched it to be a really cool night elf design that seemed like a better fit for the zone
---
I just recently got Rhok dhelar on my troll hunter and I am seeing so many conflicting things online about the racial bonus for trolls with bows. Would my hit cap still be 9% or is now 6% ??
---
Go farm gold and just dps with a quel'serrar
---
I will try to place a list for this on the Icy Veins gold making guide soon!
---
I don't see Gonagas saying that. If that happened, you should include it in the image set. But if you are just assuming that, I don't think you are going to find much sympathy beyond 'it happens'.
---
He's 31 he doesn't have whirlwind for another several levels.
---
I was including lbrs/ubrs when I said you can 5 man it.
---
Yes I get that falling behind sucks, but in this particular case the people that get stuck on ony key are the ones that expect to be carried through everything.
---
People also level alts, and they help their friends do things even if they don't get anything out of it. 
---
Let's say you don't have any friends and are in a guild full of jerks. I bet you can still get 4 people to through it by offering them 50g each.
---
These bottlenecks and attunements force you to socialize and recruit others to help, much the really way that elite quests do while leveling.
---
I do share your concern about the challenges of getting properly geared for people that start a year from now but also keep in mind current servers handle like 6x more players than in vanilla. Hopefully that will alleviate most of these issues.
---
Welcome to the jungle we've got ganks and ganks
---
You didn’t know about the BB teleport??!?
---
I feel like there's a balance to be had, to be honest. No indication these guys have no idea what they are doing.
---
every goblin town except Ratchet has separate flight masters for Horde and Alliance, for some reason
---
wow, nice. 
---
&gt;"I won't tell you that you 'knew better' (you did and so did I.)
---
&gt;I won't tell you to 'join a guild' (because they're already full of your class.)
---
&gt;I won't even tell you to 'start your own groups.'"
---
read the third line of his post.
---
man this is fucking genius to be honest. It would give a better sense of the incredible power the night elves are supposed to have in kalmindor, would mean getting back to civilization wouldn't be such a nightmare from feathermoon, and would sort of compensate for horde getting a zepplin that goes right to STV from their main two cities
---
Do items that say Equip: Improves your chance to get a critical strike by 1% effect spell crit as well? 
---
As a shaman, will it help my lightning bolt crit?
---
Uh, the 'best level' Joana was a troll hunter. And talked about how horde was 100% faster. Are you an idiot?
---
The speed levels who spammed dungeons / aoe grind don't count
---
That's exactly something I was thinking about as a solution once too. Very similar to Wrath model except none of the dungeon bullshit.
---
Wrong, we do Stocks for the boosts. 4 people on alts and a mage AoE farming the heck out of it.
---
Now hold on, I specifically remember Ion saying during the Blizzcon presentation that the debuff limit at launch was a game engine limitation and specifically *not* an intentional design choice, and for that reason they were going to increase it but not remove it. Did that not end up happening?
---
It's building gold for consumables for later raids and for wiping the Alliance as they try to get into raids.
---
No, gray quests give significantly less rep.
---
I had so much less fun with alliance quests. All the big chains are 15 quests long and 13 of those are "go to that guy and then come back".
---
I posit it's better to have the sword never drop than to have the sword drop and to lose the roll. To a hunter. Who never actually equips it because he's got a better polearm.
---
Sounds about right! Literally any question you have about classic has been answered 1000 times over and people still don’t know the basics. 
---
I mean I appreciate that some people want to do what we did in classic and figure it out themselves but for some reason the people who are the worst are also somehow the ones always asking everyone else everything instead of doing a quick search online.
---
Like you need it for your wand anyways
---
Hillsbrad is amazing for Alliance, Wetlands are amazing, Duskwood is amazing, Alliance has way more spots than the Horde for a smoother and quicker way from 1 to 40, which is a big deal (as horde you gotta travel a shitton from lvl 20 on. Ashenvale - Soutern Barrens - Hillsbrad - Stonetalon) while as Alliance you can smoothly level through the zones. Arguably STV is good for both sides, even if Kurzens Camp isn't Grom'Gol it is almost unimportant since Alliance has so much other stuff, most Horde Hubs are in contested zones, while Alliance has big and nice areas just for them (Horde has Barrens - Durotar - Mulgore - Tirisfal - Silverpine which are essentially all starter zones, as their only Horde zones)   
---
Im not here to disagree, but it all balances out in a way, Horde has Desolace, but Alliance has Wetlands.
---
1k Needles has the shimmering flat, which the alliance has just as good an accses as the horde (Gadgetzan is just as far away from it as the Horde post, if not even closer to it)
---
 Hinterlands is very good for Horde but on the other hand Alliance has Burning Steppes for that, while Horde has very little there.  
---
Eastern Plaguelands I wouldn't even count in here, Nathanos is not much of a big deal, not necessary for reaching 60 in any way.    
---
Stonetalon+Hillsbrad  =/= Red Ridge+Westfall+Duskwood and Alliance CAN even quest there while Horde has no relevant quests in any of those zones.  
---
Swamp of Sorrows is so disconnected from Horde that Mages can even teleport to it, thats how relevant that area is, although it is very Horde biased, but I don't know any Horde who prefers Swamp over STV / Hillsbrad / Arathi  
---
Arathihighlands I dont know about, never really quested there when I was Alliance, always skipped it since I was always over the level for that area before I even thought about it, specially when you do the Dwarf quests on the bridge from the Wetlands to Hillsbrad, you essentially skip Arathi by swimming arround it.  
---
Badlands. Another very disconnected area for the Horde, if they wouldn't have a base there, they'd be screwed big times, but regardless it doesn't offer much questwise, most quests are neutral, which you mentioned, but they have a little more quests there, since the others are the lategame relevant quests (ony pre) and those dont start out as smooth as the alliance one does in Burning Steppes.  
---
Dunno about Dustwallow Marsh, I always thought its very balanced, questing as Alliance there is super easy and rewarding, its easily reachable by ship, can not agree here, they have just as much quests on both sides, Theramore might seem off on the map and one could argue the horde one is more central, but mostly the upper area of it is mostly relevant for the efficient quests for both sides.  
---
Feralas tho. Youre 100% right. I do not even think about it when Im playing Alliance, but as Horde I cant wait to get there for the first few quests, until I cant see those Yetis anymore.
---
I get where you coming from, Horde has some good tavern / inn positionings and arguably fly points, but its all balanced due to ease of accses to most areas for Alliance. Ironforge is afterall the most central Hub for all endgame related things.
---
Haha great story, stupid horde cant jump
---
That not a true serum. It’s kill this dude before he can babble. Also it a Swamp of Sorrows quest.
---
who the hell has that much gold to blow on food? fake and gay
---
Ok, I'll bite.
---
I mean ya certain classes are hard counters, nothing can be done about that.  Every class has one or two hard counters.
---
Ret has insane burst, a reliable stun on a short cooldown, an in combat "sap", good heals, and utility for everything: You or a warrior buddy want to jump a mage?  Blessing of freedom.  Want to make sure you can break out of fear/sap/sheep?  Blessing of Sacrifice.  Cleansing dots and debuffs makes fights against Warlocks and Hunters a lot easier.  Your mage or healer is being dived?  Blessing of Protection.  
---
Add on top of that Seal/Aura Dancing, a solid PvP profession (Engineering grenades are amazing for this and cover our main weakness of not having a gap closer), plate to make fights against Warriors and Rogues much easier than for most, and bubbling ourselves?  We're quite a threat in organized PvP.
---
Nothing happened to normalization between 1.8 and 1.12 though..So that is what we are playing.
---
Amazing movie dude, had the best laugh evah
---
Haha, sort of the same here. Found them around 20, though. I just picked talents on my own whims as well, probably completely shit spec.
---
Ya this is quite obviously a biased point of view from a salty lifetime alliance player
---
the zoram strand flightpoint is so ridiculous to me. Can't have horde stuck walking across a whole half a zone to do a dungeon I guess
---
Lol, you can pick and choose parts of what i said to suite your narrative all you want.  If you are so certain LW is useless (it's not) then why did you even create this thread?  It sounds to me like you think you have everything figured out, including how to make 10k gold on a whim.  Perhaps, you should have created an AMA wow related, since you are an expert.
---
Better over heal that shit
---
I'm EU Pyrewood Village (Horde) and I know a few decent social guilds that are up for quests and instances such as Shadowmane Tribe and Pull and Beer
---
I calculated the mana cost for me to revive and rebuff after a wipe around level 45. Roughly 12K.
---
Hillsbrad is a horde zone?? 😂😂😂
---
spent around 3 hours in maraudon of all places last night. Time flies when you're.... repeatedly wiping :D
---
Fuck, it's usually faster to take the boat from Auberdine to Menethil and then from Menethil to Dustwallow and fly from there than it is to fly from Darnassus to anywhere beyond Auberdine/Astranaar.
---
Becausd this us my alt and saw guides recommending which doesnt make sense. Look at the people who are 60, they agree.
---
First off you should find a guild that raids, you can talk to the class officers or guild leader and see what classes they are accepting and how loot works for the group (wether it’s loot council or just /roll) and see if they need your class. Second, there are only two raids out at the moment, Molten Core and Onyxia, Onyxia you need to do a long quest chain to get attuned which starts with a quest in Kargath and to get attuned to Molten Core you just have to do one quest that begins with the High Elf outside the instance that just requires you to go most of the way through BRD. 
---
If you have even half of your BIS gear from dungeons you’ll be fine doing DPS in the raids. Learn the encounters by reading guides or watching YouTube videos before hand.
---
It's all good, but turns you into somewhat of a glass cannon. I kept my enhanced gold bloodrobe for some stats and to save a bit on mats/gold. Also, I leveled engineering for a Green Lens of shadow wraith because it's one of the pre-bis hats and you can wear it at lvl 35 (cost me 10g)
---
XP wise, are Mara runs good for leveling at level 49?
---
Why would you try to mount up during a fight with a caster anyways? Pretty much every single one has some sort of CC regardless of whether or not they're able to silence you.
---
I just realized yesterday I'm going to have to leave my guild because of how incredibly toxic they are as raid leaders.. I do not get it.
---
It's good especially combined with a decent off hand like the lvl 35 quest Orb you can get.
---
tbh i'd have much preferred the ride from undercity. It's really annoying trying to ride around Andorhal without falling in the water or aggroing one of the skeletons and inevitably getting dismounted from the firsth it daze
---
The five mans are super fun and only one place outside MC requires 10 people, so not sure what you mean here.
---
But yes that tends to happen. People do stuff once or twice and either get what they want and don’t want to go back, or don’t get it and lose interest in repeating it. 
---
If you don’t get enjoyment from both gearing yourself up over time and helping others do the same you’ll lose interest fast. I did MC and several dungeons last night, I got zero loot. Still great night as most of my friends got cool drops.
---
As someone who has, Alliance have it better.
---
Oops guess we do need data.
---
Hillsbrand horde? Yeah no
---
Hand of justice drop and roll win on my 5th brd arena / angerforge run ever.  Started brd yesterday, got hoj and the 2% dodge pants (im a rogue) all on that same day.
---
Not that it's cool to be mean to others but there's definitely a balance between being nice and carrying people who don't know what they're doing. I have a job and responsibilities, gotta make my limited playtime count haha
---
Lol and now we see why cata happened
---
Dustwallow Marsh is not at all an amazing place for horde. There’s a reason it got revamped later. There’s about four quests there entirely. 
---
I’d argue alliance have better questing in many ways. Wetlands has a shit load of quests including elite ones for you. We have zero there. darkshore is just ten times better than silverpine. In fact Darkshores my favorite alliance zone for leveling. 
---
Then you got Westfall, Lakeshire, and Duskwood. These three zones are pretty awesome. Duskwood especially. What would you compare it to for horde? STM? STM is awful. The quest range is way too big for the few amount of quests you can do there. 
---
Hinterlands I’ll say is 100% horde favored. It was added later because horde were basically screwed for quests around that level range.
---
4 hours and not kill Baelgar?
---
&gt; there's no counterplay
---
Lmao the brain on this lad thinking people will get banned over this.
---
Enjoy getting killed by guards everytime someone does this, I'm sure they'll have a big laugh at your saltiness levels.
---
Looks good! Ill check it out when leveling an alt
---
Would have been more of a climax had he not needed to make bag space. 🤣
---
KOS List:
---
1. "Bullseye"
---
I really don't understand this. I just leveled to 60 on Alliance and never had to grind. I even skipped STV almost entirely, and didn't spam dungeons beyond getting quests done.
---
Nobody is talking about you though? Yeah there are people who enjoy blitzing through 14 year old content efficiently with all the tricks and knowledge of 14 years of wow, and yeah you have people who have played wow for a few months and have never stepped foot in brd.

Play however you want.
---
Nah, Int and Stam arent as important as SP for a lock. The staff from ZF is solid but with and off hand he could be pushing 40-45 SP woth some stats which will be better
---

Nope

---
elite quest in hinterlands - hunter joins party, pulls around 10 mobs with his pet, rages at the 'shit group'.
---
Its fine if you're swords, but i use daggers/backstab because i enjoy it more for pvp and raiding. I just dont want to also respec multiple times a week to farm/raid
---
Half? I prolly need to drink to buff that much.
---
why play then?
---
Eww fuck that, anyone who flames needs to get a life. Why would you play a game that you get angry at?
---
It seems to be the general opinion but man it’s also much more complex to configure I find. I keep meaning to set it up better but I use it on my Druid and I’m feral/much prefer to tank so “eh”. 
---
Honestly considering just using healbot instead. Simpler for sure but took like 30 seconds to have my basic spells on it and the auto buff worked right out the box, something I can’t seem to get working for VuhDo.
---
You forgot the extra blue gear Horde get which helps in said questing.
---
Transferred to heartseeker as soon as I could
---
Stockade equivalent to rfc
---
Deadmine to wailing cavern (altho u can argue alliance has quest to wc, and horde almost will never run DM)
---
SFK to gnomergon 
---
BFD way closer to horde fp than alliance, and on same continent with org. (Running on foot that distance makes difference l, plus the boat ride from EK, cause 90% alliance would be starting quest in the EK) 
---
RFK and RFD. (I don’t need to tell you who has it better)
---
SM, more horde quests, and taking zeppelin is way better than the run from Southshore after taking a flight path, even from IF. 
---
UC isn’t a really bad capital city in terms of where you can get to places in eastern kingdom. (If you are in the leveling range to do SM, hearth in UC is good idea) Where as Darnassus, in the kalimdor, well it’s pretty empty for a reason. The frequent rerun places on the same continent would be ony and ZF, both much quicker with boats(still gotta fly out of main capital to get to boat city on the EK)
---
UC&gt;Darnassus 
---
Brd, upper lower brs, strath scholo, see UC. 
---
Again leveling wise, which is majority of the gameplay right now.
---
Ironforge is the superior city in the entire game, too.
---
Oh that’s right. So then I guess the price is even more justified? It’s like over 1k on my seever
---
That isn’t always the case, as a warrior, if I pugged DM and Foror’s Compendium dropped, it’s a major upgrade and I WOULD use it, but I’m not able to just “buy it off the AH” even though I really need it.
---
 main hand dropped for me on my first run today, oof
---
No, but seeing time in a video game as "wasted time" unless you do it as fast as possible is pretty immature.
---
Every adult i know play video games to have fun, not to do a chore which they want to get done with as quickly as possible.
---
Also not very muture to write "HAHAHHAHAH" in all caps. Also pretty immature to use sarcasm as your primary form of communication.
---
But what do i know im just an old fart.
---
Pretty good
---
&gt;Stonetalon is supposed to be the Horde equivalent of Redridge
---
Nah, that is Thousand Needles.
---
Yeah, just thought it was comical though
---
At least on my server (which is slightly horde favored but pretty close), it's always the horde that are camping all the instance portals in blackrock mountain. I don't think it's too bad for you to get there anyways, zepplin to grom'gol then take the flight path to either northern searing gorge or northern burning steppes.
---
Unless you already have the kargath flight point it's a bit of a hike to get one of those two in the first place though
---
do you mean 180 taps, or 180 entire veins (avg. 3 taps)? Afaik the likelihood of not getting a single arcane crystal with 180 nodes is 0.97^180 (assuming 1% chance each tap, and avg. 3 taps per vein), which is 0.4% chance... quite unlucky indeed.
---
Surprisingly wholesome 👍🏻
---
You should be a little less liberal with what you consider “cancer”. Macros are a staple of WoW and are immensely useful... and all you need to do is type “WoW macros &lt;class&gt;” and copy paste.

Do mages not realize that conjured water disappears after the owner of said water logs off? You'd have to be a pretty daft to compare the price of something permanent to something that only lasts a single session.
---
(I'm referring only to the folks who expect huge tips for conjuring fucking water, especially when in the same group of a dungeon)
---
This is the type of vibe I love. If I wasn't on Alliance I'd wanna roll with you guys :D
---
Imagine not being able to summon for raids.
---
Tried that. Doesn't help. Seems strange it only showed up once I hit 60?
---
WoW classic is the greatest alternate reality of all time.

Deadmines and Stockades.

You'd think people would be mature enough to understand that, but evident by my downvotes, they're not.

Really you just need to get attuned to MC (rather short attunement) and Onyxia (longer attunement). Gear wise, there aren't a whole lot of requirements. On my server there are multiple regular MC/Ony pugs you could join which rarely have any gear requirements. There is no order to the raids, Ony is a single boss and can be quite quick, MC is 10 bosses and can be a bit longer.

Idk I can go into ratchet on my alliance and kill people in the middle of town and guards do nothing. So is that considered a blind spot? For reference he was using the bank and I killed him after he was done and walking away.
---
I would say so. If you want to farm gold, level a warlock, hunter or mage. If you want to stick to the rogue, gathering professions are your friend. Mine is a herbalist and gathering Dreamfoil is the way I finance my raids.
---
I have to admit, questing as AF is pretty bad. Also why is there only like 3 guards in all of Stormwind???
---
Unfortunately there is. However, join the resistance and dont use one!
---
Turn on time stamps. Take note of what happens at what exact time.
---
I’ve been told giving time stamps and specifics of combat log, with precise locations, they can take swifter action. 
---
No credible source, just word of mouth, but it’s logical.
---
What should I level first to 60 and main, between a 48 Rogue and 56 Warlock?
---
I'm so lost.
---
I've played a caster DPS and I really enjoy it but I never mained a melee DPS.  I know I love being a caster but at the same time I want to try something different.
---
Warlocks are awesome in battlegrounds and can farm gold easily  by soloing instances, while rogues are much higher dps in raids all throughout classic (until locks catch up around Naxx), have swords and daggers that look cool as shit, and solo / world pvp is better but not they're not as fun in battlegrounds.
---
Warlocks are rarer but there are more raid spots for rogues.
---
I dont know what to do - do I stick to what I know I'll like or roll the dice and try something I might hate but I also might love it even more?
---
I need to make one of them my main because my Shaman is 100% my alt. 
---
Help is appreciated!
---
Dump the book, Eskhander is amazing.
---
A fury tank can’t use shield wall
---
I'll be honest, I'd rather have done that than the Alliance one. I might be biased though because I hate blackrock depths with a burning passion
---
 It's wbere you make all the money.

Fellow alliance member died fighting a mob in un'goro, so i attacked it and it dropped a travelers bp, 16 slot. Not sure when the loot is determined, but i like to think he would have gotten the bag, because now its mine. Hahhhahahah

Reroll another class ?

In all seriousness your most usefull stealthing up and ganking the healers and mages in the back.

Do you know if there are any places where a Horde can chill in an Alliance town? Like maybe the downstairs keg-storage locations? Might be a fun alt pastime, just have a bunch of alts stationed in locations frequented by Allys but where there's no NPC line-of-sight to call guards.
---
Some guy has the entire ah filled with 5 stacks of delights for like 1g each. I have no idea how this is profitable from a time investment standpoint.

So even if it's just a base account that can only get to level 20 in Retail, will a subscription be enough? Thanks!

more likely they are just too cheap to buy major mana pots.

using rank 1 frost bolt is useful in pvp other than that you should always be trying to use max rank frostbolt.

I'd much rather stonetalon was like redridge and was contested but with no alliance quests or town there. At least on pvp servers it's literally impossible to quest there as alliance anyways because there were 5x as many horde at slightly higher levels. So the quests in stonetalon end up being "wasted" anyways since there's no chance you can do them anywhere near the appropriate level.
---
Shimmering flats is lit for sure though, so glad that place is neutral
---
Even on the non streamer servers all the zoomers  are running round saying poggerz and kappa all the time which ticks me off a little
---
Do a alliance guide please and thanks :)
---
He for sure put that in himself.
---
Second this, leveled as feral to 60 in well under 7 days.
---
There goes my mana...
---
Haha ye I mean entire veins. I’ve got quite the rep in the guild, so some people even game me a few arcane crystals :p
---
2handed furry is fine. 
---
MadSeasonShow is 2HF and has the highest DPS on Ony for Faerlina.
---
Got locked to mc destroying peoples gear in lava.
---
you dont
---
Also talk about the guard situation. Darkshire only has an alliance town in it but is contested? And the guards are only like level 35? So any 60 can just reek havoc by themselves with all the level 20s or so characters. 
---
Even within zones it is obnoxious. If I am remember right, Ashenvale has like level 45 guards for alliance... but level 55 for horde? This is a frequent theme where it makes ganking so much easier for horde as well.
---
I thought I remembered getting level after level in ashenvale on my very first alliance character back in the day, then hit it up for classic like "wait, really? That's all the quests? I guess it's off to eastern kingdoms for me or else die 100 times in stonetalon"
---
Don’t do Zygor. It makes you grind a lot and it doesn’t integrate class quests and dungeons into the guide. It’s not very efficient overall.
---
I highly recommend Classicwow.live. It’s an awesome guide. I’m on my second character using it and it’s the best so far. I was always at least one or two levels above everything.
---
Big gz mate I got a lot of tier one and epics already but the dal rend set are my most prized items by far. Got mine after 67 runs.
---
They give like 10 rep each. When they turn grey
---
Does that really work??
---
The paid sub is what you need.
---
Yep. Also the horde have much better race buffs than alli.
---
Without a doubt and it’s not even close
---
I absolutely HATED Dual Specs with a passion and that OneChange would make me quit Classic instantly.
---
Mine would be giving Paladins a Taunt.
---
Have you seen many druid tanks? I did quite a few dungeons leveling up and my first time in a group with a druid tank was in Strat UD
---
Swim? You can walk on the north side no problem
---
Find a preraid best in slot list for your class and start working on that. You can go to raids with any gear really. MC/Ony are easy.
---
/cast berserker stance
---
/Cast intercept
---
You can Google this as well.
---
&gt;The difference is that Horde literally has no quests in either Duskwood or Wetlands
---
The horde warlock's felhunter quest chain involves killing orcs in southern Wetlands. Very fun and accessible on a PvP server.
---
Most likely how all the Pservers did it. You can just copy your toon over to the new server. That way you can still have a classic toon on classic servers and still enjoy BC
---
Simplest would be
---
 #showtooltip Intercept (# before showtooltip)
---
/cast Intercept
---
Hit twice quickly if not already in zerker stance
---
It's in the works
---
My AH is bugged. It works fine on my alt but on my main it shows nearly 0 items.
---
Searches for normal things yield 0 results, and then on my alt that same search shows items. When I filter there is less than 1 page worth of weapons in the entire AH on my main. How do I fix this? It makes the game nearly unplayable.

Trying to run from the WPL alliance flight point into SM without getting killed at least twice by level 50 mobs/angry horde is always a fun time D:

That ship is a waste period.  It is faster to just swim between the island and mainland, even if the boat is sitting at the dock when you get there.  Don't use that boat unless you're just about to get up and go make a sandwich.
---
&gt;selects random item delete in order to turn in the quest
---
&gt;it's the stack of quest items
---
WHY WAS IT DELETED
---
It's less of a chain and more of several chains that link together that you can pick up at different points. Orcs and Trolls hop on it at Crossroads.
---
Because they don't talk is the point they just use twitch emotes
---
Just try to find a group with warlock so he can summon you back to the instance. Also set your hearthstone to Kargath so you can fly to the quest giver fast.
---
Right, but no one forced to you quit or play anything you didn’t want to. Whatever the experience was like for this group, they clearly all enjoyed whatever the fuck it was they were doing in there for 4 hours, and it’s weird how many people are getting angry because someone else enjoyed something they wouldn’t.
---
Well the trade off is you have to play as a knuckle dragging mud hut sleeping neanderthal

Hahahaha holy fuck

1. No, if it’s gear for a player in the group then they take priority and everyone else should greed. If someone needs a BOE epic to use, they should equip it on the spot so everyone can see.
---
2. Off spec stuff depends, still takes priority over folks that can’t use it. They should still equip it to prove they intend to use it.
---
You're saying they got better at design by being lazy?
---
If the rogue is going to be so concerned about a “tank” warrior rolling need on dps gear, then they should be the one asking before hand. It’s that simple. If you have issues with the way people roll on loot then find a different group.
---
Good triumphs over evil.
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
Imagine not raiding, not gold farming, not actually PvPing, and just camping a bridge in a lvl 30 zone to MC some poor bastard off of a bridge. Horde in a nutshell.
---
Lol troll
---
Many Germans play with the English client on a German server, it just makes things easier when you know the spell, item and quest names in English since the most wow resources are in English.
---
Enough gear drops in 5-mans that you could probably grab whatever wasn't needed.  Wait to roll on highly contested items until you see what the healer does, but as a healer myself who is just looking for 3 specific upgrades, I would rather someone get the gear that could potentially use it rather than vendor it.  I would be really pissed if they rolled on those last couple things I specifically need though- I've run those dungeons over and over with no luck yet.
---
I say "neigh"
---
The best thing to do is just level up and play the game, then you will automatically learn how things work.
---
It's not really something you have to think about.
---
gl :)
---
Or just standing behind the vehicle and the ramp down into the ah- it’s a no aggro zone and you can hit people both at the forge npcs and going into ah.   I fear idiots out of there all the time.
---
48 should be high enough for you to see if you actually like the  playstyle of the rogue. If you do then I personally would suggest the rogue.
---
Might be harder to say on how long they take because that kind of depends on the group composition, skill, gear, etc.
---
I'd say though most dungeons shouldn't take much longer than 1 to 1.5 hours.  This is also at a mediocre pace and a non-speed run type group. However, the time it takes to organize the group and get everyone there easily adds another 10-20 minutes.  A wipe can also add another 5-10 minutes easily and the more you wipe the more likely you'll deal with respawns which adds even more time.
---
Also depends on what type of run it is. A full BRD clear can take a very, very long time (1.5-2 hours) while an arena run (which is still BRD, just a specific run in BRD) isn't nearly as long.
---
&gt; Just stop. You are putting up strawmen to justify yourself wasting other people's time.
---
Point out a strawman, please.
---
&gt; No one wants to bullshit around in a raid and wipe because bad players ruin the game for those around them.
---
There is a difference between "bad players" and "bad specs". And speaking of straw men, i know for sure there are players who dont mind playing with bad players as long as they try to be better and are fun to play with. So no its not true that "no one wants to bullshit around in a raid and wipe because bad players ruin the game".
---
&gt; I'm in a guild that full clears all the raid content in 3 hours and everyone has a lot of fun because we actively kick shitters out of the raid.
---
Good for you, nothing wrong with that. If you enjoy playing like that - great. If someone enjoys playing as ret - great.
---
&gt;  It gives people more time to play other parts of the game or deal with real life while still getting 100% satisfaction from the raid content.
---
Well, there isnt much to do in the game right now except raid. And as i said earlier. If it takes me and my guild 3 hours to clear MC we dont mind that because we play wow and raid to have fun. Clearing it in 40 minutes is just as much fun as doing it in 3 hours - because we dont consider the time spent doing that as tedious or "taking away from our real life".
---
&gt; Stop being selfish. You might not think you are selfish, but you are.
---
How am i being selfish in this discussion?
---
&gt; You are taking other people's time for your own enjoyment.
---
So if i join a guild as balance druid and they are ok with that, i am somehow taking their time for my own enjoyment eventho they are completly fine with me playing balance druid?
---
Get a grip.
---
Just because you feel that the difference between a 60 min clear and a 65 min clear is "in the 65 min clear we WASTED 5 minutes" please do not project that feeling on everyone else.
---
I noticed that the other day, and people told me I was wrong
---
Read posts more carefully. Roughly speaking does not mean it is directly comparable it means that there is a general point which is analogous and clarifies my wider point. Again tips has no ability to access company records unless they are made available to him so the idea "just check for yourself" doesnt hold water. Tips doesnt "have shit for brains" for getting caught up in this necessarily.
---
wow, just what I was looking for!

just 2 things: 
---
is fury/prot gear same as prot?
---
when do I go fury/prot?
---
Sry im a pretty new player.. does it have to do with layering or something?
---
AFAIK I know, it was only hair when it was first implemented.
---
You're telling me you have fun repeatedly failing in easy content, so you're either lying or have some weird case of video game stockholm syndrome
---
Mograine. Best server
---
I'm not gonna say the Horde has it better (because they don't in most cases) but the ability to get to SFK/SM shouldn't be understated for those level 24-42.
---
I ran Horde in Vanilla and Alliance now in Classic and I think the Horde's questing progression made more sense but Alliance has better city placements in general for EK (Currently we're basically next to BRM and have a quick trip to a boat for Ony).
---
I think IF is the best located cap city in the game and people forget that easily while drawing their biases
---
Their friends are probably getting all the loot before anyone else
---
Well i could had... which would had been quite weird since biggest reason to play classic was to play with them
---
That's what I did too and it was great. I didn't miss out on anything :D
---
Shame its so bad. That could've been a legit windfury spec starter weapon if only itd been slow.
---
As it is its still fun for levels 51-60 if you can get it.
---

---
Simple; retail doesnt need anything like that, just max level and a few world quests and youll be swimming in epics to get you started in arenas..... lame
---
Or Ragefire Chasm.  I wonder how many Alliance players even knew there was an instance in Org back in vanilla (or BC for that matter).
---
It's crazy on the bug-report forums. People bring up an issue where classic isn't matching how vanilla worked and there's instantly 10 posts in the thread telling them they're just remembering wrong.
---
That’s correct. 
---
Retail required bfa iirc, however classic only needs a sub
---
If it wasn't for my computer and various games I wouldn't get out of bed.

---
Firemaw is still layered, so probably.
---
The fact that its still layered shows that it has plenty of population.
---
Not at all. I think the dungeon spam meta is boring as hell so I quested my way to 60.  I only ran dungeons once or twice to do quests there and moved on. In my experience, my journey to 60 was much more fulfilling and enjoyable than most others I talked to that spammed only SM, ZF, and BRD. Not to mention all the necessary quest trinkets and prerequisite quests I got done along the way.
---
Go ahead and mention the alliance favoured zones then.
---
Remember that 1-20 are supposed to be exclusive zones so there can't be a strong bias here. Only a few exceptions to this rule such as Ratchet.
---
20-30 are a mixed bag with fairly equal zones like Ashenvale and Hillsbrad along with pretty much exclusive ones like south barrens, west TN, Duskwood and Wetlands. You could make a case that Alliance has the better part of this bracket but not by much really.
---
30-60 (30-50 really since 50+ is mostly neutral) are the zones we can really compare, and where are the strong alliance zones in this bracket? Felwood, Azshara, Blasted Lands, Burning Steppes, Searing Gorge et.c.
---
Any of those you'd like to talk about?
---
Meanwhile running from duskwood to quest in STV
---
I'm going to copy/paste the Hunter discord paragraph about this.  (Here's the link to it too: [https://discord.gg/8TVHxRr](https://discord.gg/8TVHxRr))
---
**7. What does weapon skill and hit chance do for a hunter in PvE?**
---
&gt;Attacking a lvl 63 target (boss) at lvl 60 with 300 skill, you would observe an 8% miss chance with 0% hit from gear/talents. 1% hit is ignored from gear when the skill difference between target (315) and player (300) is greater than 10. For e.g. If you were to gain 1% hit, you would still observe 8% miss chance, and if you gain 2% hit, you would observe 7% miss chance. So in order to be **hit capped** at 300 skill, you need 9% hit.  When you have +5 skill, you get 1% from getting 0.2% hit per point up to 5, plus 1% for having 5 skill, plus removing the 1% penalty if you had any hit from gear/talents. Any additional skill above 5 reduces your chance to miss by 0.1% per point, all the way to 0%. An example of this would be for e.g. if you have 1% hit and 305 skill, attacking a 315 (lvl 63) target you would observe 5% miss chance. If you had 304 skill and 1% hit, you would observe a 7.2% miss chance, and if you had 309 skill with 1% hit you would observe 4.6% miss chance or 5.6% without 1% hit.  **TL;DR** **9% hit** **required with 300 skill,** **6% hit** **305 skill, anything else negligible**
---
Ahh yes Icewell Radiance
---
Tanks don’t get to roll on everything just because they are in a fucking group. 
---
You want dps gear?  Have somebody else tank and you dps then. 
---
Your role in the dungeon determines your “need” on drops, not wtf ever you do in your raids.
---
Yeah but so are mirahs and thrash and significantly easier to get. My buddy has 40 rend kills and hasn't seen them drop once.
---
I've quested both alliance and horde a couple times each. I gotta say, I love playing horde and am a die hard hordie, but I kinda like the alliance questing experience more actually. Horde is worth it Blood and honor!
---
&gt;Also he doesn’t mention redridge
---
Redridge, Duskwood, and Wetlands are all alliance only zones...this is like saying Durotar is unfairly biased toward the horde lol. OP is pointing out all the dual zones
---
Same, but it hasn't really been that terribly bad imo. I mean my gnome mage seemed like it was equally as frustrating running all over the map to find the right level quests. Maybe im big dumb tho
---
Sit in non pvp zone and kill lowbies who attack you by mistake because they cannot see you?
---
You understand many, *many* things changed over the course of Vanilla, yes? You understand many of those same changes will be taking place in Classic as the various Phases are released?
---
Levelling Horde is indisputably faster/more efficient. The zeppelins alone make this true, not even delving into other stuff like The Barrens, FP locations, or how close SM is to UC. 
---
The fact that you can go from a main city in Eastern Kingdoms directly to a main city in Kalimdor is godly, not to mention direct zep access to STV from both cities which makes level 32-45 (an annoying hump of levels) far less of a pain.
---
Biggest question is what does the gf want? She still playing or did she quit?
---
Factions are the same. Both have assholes. Probably your bias towards horde makes it easier to focus on the bad in the alliance. I've experienced it on both sides. Regardless, if you miss horde, go horde. Doesnt make sense to stay on a faction you dont like. I've done it twice now. It happens. Go enjoy horde and have fun. Assuming the gf isnt playing anyways or convince her horde is better.
---
I’m on firemaw also and there is a 2 + hour queue so no it isn’t dying
---
Vanilla also has catch up mechanics. Look at the gear that becomes avaliable in later phases and theyre just dropped randomly in the same dungeons youre already doing at 60.  
---
The trend didnt start with tbc but I also dont see the problem with catch up gear, whys it a negative that people who join late can be on *almost* equal footing as you? The real egregious gear is naxx gear because unlike common held beliefs, its stronger than outland greens and blues, especially what kelthuzad drops, you wont get an upgrade until 70 epic, its *that* strong.
---
Yea I'll just buy from vendor lol - the whole point of mage food/water is that it's free
---
The Horde really feel like they have more one shot quests, at most three parters. You don't really get the epic spans. From a low level Horde perspective, I suppose there is the Burning Blade stuff in Durotar that goes into the Barrens, with you reporting their threat to Thrall, following it up and such.
---
The drips and drabs quests are probably what helps with levelling too - easier to pick up one or two, move to a better place and do a few more.
---
Run speed is reduced by X% in stealth, after movement speed buffs.
---
I don't get why people get so upset about a non-german player on a german server? Like wtf it's just a game.
---
It’s not dying but there’s obviously going to be a good amount of people leaving around level 40/50.
---
These levels suck and this tends to be the range where people will reroll and leave the game entirely.
---
We were averaging 90ish members online with 30 on in the middle of the night.
---
Went to 15 as a high and we have a bunch of 50’s that last played weeks ago.
---
Nah. Watch some of cdews duels against mages, he loses often. Also xaryu has some videos up where he beats some of the harder classes like Druid/lock. The only real hard counter to mage seems to be priest.
---
Yes. 
---
The playerbase is declining atm. Will probably keep going lower untill xmas holidays kick in and people have time to play. If you are leveling atm you may find out that there are not many dungeon groups which you could join. Doing elite quests may also be nearly impossible.
---
And when the new patch comes to retail you may also see player count go down a bit. 
---
But there is always some players playing the game. They might not be doing the content which you would like to do.
---
Which ones - the ones who spam dungeons, farm mobs(not questing) or are horde?
---
I've heard that you can level with lashers but haven't done it myself. But I think this is harder, imo stay with lashers. But hey, try it out :)
---
Item Rack is the one I use. Super simple, plus you can set up keyboard shortcuts for different sets. There's also automated swapping based on different events like being in a city, shape shifting, or casting.
---
Dear Horde,
---
Get fucked.
---

Your friendly neighbourhood Dwarf Priest
---
Questi or questie
---
This is old news, complained about it back the first few weeks of vanilla
---
What centralized position? It is in the bottom left of the map.
---
Yes, I kind of forgot about Maraudon because I'm a WL. I went there twice and that's it. But quite convenient for melees ofc.
---
Kappa
---
I didn't randomly caps anything.
---
Moron.
---
Gadget isnt either of those
---
Also in those zones there are no guards that will kill you for attacking a player
---
And if you think that you can camp in stealth as a 60 to force level 10s to attack you in a controlled zone then you have no clue that they wont even see you
---
They still give rep;  Pretty sure they give full rep too, but not sure.  But depending on your ability to farm gold it may not be the best rep/hour compared to runecloth turnins
---
Haven't heard anything about that, "solo farming" was huge in vanilla and still is. Hunters are farming tribute run and selling gear and even rogues can solo Angerforge in brd with this kind of pathing.
---
It didn't end, it just became an endless grind of dailies for your consolation prize.
---
Yeah, not gonna touch that lol. I’m sure you enjoy/hate your experience the precisely correct amount. Instruct us that we may learn from thee.
---
I would love to correlate this information with the amount of people that quit during the barrens. Sure overall it's great but the barrens is so easy to get burnt out on.
---
Is HOTW spec decent for MC or should I go moonglow?
---
(X) Doubt. Sounds like confirmation bias
---
It probably is, but this is easier to get and it's an alternative :)
---
Adobe Premiere Pro mate
---
It's not trash when implemented correctly.
---
I am a officer at a guild where we have a rule that we make sure that everybody got a loot, if someone have loot he can't get till all others in same role have exceptions with tanks and priest eye.
---
Gm waited 2 weeks in raiding then made officers who where showing good results and now 5 random ppl are in loot council with the rule of the gm that everybody gets loots. Even if your dps is not on the level it should be. You will be skipped loot if you don't attend the raid whitout telling that you can't make it. And srly in 4 weeks we had 0 drama and no one left the raid.
---
I see people on my server everywhere all the time lol
---
Then why is the tsm tooltip still there
---
Benediction
---
Yes we are speaking german. OP didnt state anywhere that he's mad at the person whispering him, also he's a welcome member in our german guild. Expecting someone to leave a server because someone doesnt speak the same language as you is just a dick move. The person who whispered OP couldve just ignore him/dont play with him if he doesn't want to communicate in english.
---
Need more of these runs in WoW
---
I did this grind a little while ago and just turned in Runecloth.
---
The reputation rewards are severely reduced as you’re higher level.  Starter quests will give you 7 rep or so.  From my experience it’s faster just to make money and buy cloth.
---
I turned 627 stacks for about 1.2-1.3g per stack.
---
Yeah, horde quests r much more fun.
---
Spaulders of Valor and rends MH dropped first time i did UBRS.
---
i didnt know how lucky i was.
---
dear god, why didn't i get that sword.
---
Just causally get ironfoe it only a .5% drop rate
---
For classic, all you need is a subscription.
---
For retail, they have change the entry requirements. Now you just need to buy the latest expansion to play the latest expansion, base game comes with subscription. Base game is everything before the latest expansion, legion and below.
---
For real just ignore each other if you're so upset about someone not speaking your language
---
Have people done that in classic? I mean this as aside to wearing wildheart. The fastest times I had heard of so far were around 35 minutes. Is there really someone that has cleared it sub-20 already? I know guilds did it on private servers
---
This has been adressed by blizz, and it won't get changed.  There, your question answered twice.
---
LF Inner Fire
---
I've seen some people write twitch emotes, but i doubt people use them constantly. It's just used like any other interjection.
---
Combat dagger! Gloves from MC and u cant loose🖤 and now with DM out, u can get a very nice belt or off hand, easy.
---
I'm not sure if I should be upset, or tell you an awesome story.
---
Then my job here is done 🙏 
---
Nice try magetard
---
How do you know we're not getting Classic+?
---
Am using this as a warrior too. It's pretty good. Very clear in directions and only a couple of times has it sent me somewhere which was too hard to complete.
---
My only very slight annoyance is it doesn't really direct you to dungeons except for the odd one or two because it's not "optimum". So you sort of need to pause, figure out where all the quests are yourself and then continue.
---
&gt; edgemasters/lionheart. 
---
I'm playing a rogue..Also, farming for an upgrade is the same as farming gold to buy an upgrade.
---
Ancient Egyptians used symbols for words and thoughts as well.
---
Nobody would go to Darnassus regardless. Simply the distance between the bank, AH and vendors is enough to put most people off.
---
I’ve leveled 5 characters to 60 over the years, horde and alliance, and I’ve never stepped foot into that place outside of buying the first aid book.
---
You mean like it has always been since Arena was introduced?
---
In phase 2 the only way to farm PvP honor is to kill players out in the world
---
In phase 3 there will be battlegrounds to do most of the farming, leaving out most of the world pvp farming while in a queue to enter a BG
---
Love this!
---
cdew plays enhance, which is a horrible spec vs mage. Popular streamers with full bis gear and a very deep understanding of the game vs randos isn't how you assess matchups. You can find clips of xaryu and ziko rolling priests too but it doesn't indicate anything
---
I mean if you look into the actual lore of things it makes more sense
---
I'm gonna use this thread to apologise to the group I was running BRD with on Felstriker last night. I joined excited for my first run through and an opportunity to get attuned. The timing was all perfect then as we began to start my girlfriend decided to get difficult. We'd had a stressful afternoon and it was largely my fault. While I thought I'd get to relax with some WoW in the evening she decided that wasn't an option forcing me AFK. I wanted to come back but she demanded I help her with a 'small' bit of her work that ballooned out to an hour and a half long tutoring session with spreadsheets at 10pm. I hope the four of you got something out of BRD and I didn't ruin your night.
---
I'm a fan of Hakurai's. His was made with a warrior so you know it works for everyone.
---
They’re taking a 3 to 4 month break?
---
I prefer to play alone; raids are fun tho
---
Oh shit
---
Never played a mage, but seeing so much mage content lately, espescially with the duel tournament, im tempted to try it. Looks fun! And gz🤓
---
I dunno, I ran two dungeons last night without any issues waiting.  ULD and ZF.  People are play and leveling.  The initial burst of 60s is slowing but by Christmas, most people who started around launch should be 60.
---
As a combat rogue you want a slow fucking weapon in your main hand to make your sinister strike hit harder. And whatever in your off hand; preferably something fast for poison applications
---
Yeah dude, forming bonds with other players and relationships that make carryon for years to come? Fuck that gimmie the gear.
---
Great picture!
---
I have no hurry to reach 60.
---
Im enjoying every moment of the leveling!
---
The amount of damage his attack does is almost entirely done by that fire dot. the actual physical damage is miniscule, a clothie could tank him.
---
The horde have nothing like duskwood, an entire zone with a tightly integrated story and atmosphere.
---
Went farming crusader with a guildie, we killed three mobs and got it.
---
DM dagger is also nice
---
Ah yes I see. The rare Fedfennel in elwynn Forest has high chance of dropping unique 8 slot bag. Very precious when the servers are new, all the resources are little. I wonder if the 8 slot bags are still very hard to come by after classic wow has been out for 2 months. 
---
Captains Sander’s booty bag is the other one. Advantage alliance
---
I’ve gotten bags made for me for free and even given to me for free (8 and 10 slots, because they are such treasured items)
---
But yes advantage alliance, for sure. 
---
If there’s a new server starting, these are definitely advantages new players should take into consideration when picking factions. Non of others facts. 
---
From the link I also see the small red pouch has 1% higher drop rate than rest of others and that’s from the defied in elwynn. Great advantage alliance. 
---
Feel steed saddlebags 10 slotter from SFK, wonder how easy for mid 20s to run through wetland, arathi hillsbrad.
---
and I don't think any of those buildings count as inns while you're at it
---
People often recommend the Robe of Winter Night: +40 frost damage is good for phase 1. You miss out on the extra mana and crit (or is it just hit) from archmage, and its only frost damage instead of all damage.
---
I was told druid were the secodn exclusive class of alliance, so horde would have priest and shaman
---
Would have make more sense to remove mage from horde (never saw a mage hrode in w3) as they're replaced by warlock
---
No FP or Inn there though
---
Not only do we have to get smacked by high level horde running to SM, we also have to either take a fucking long ass path around the west side to Undercity or take the shorter (but still fucking long) run through an area of level 50+ mobs which appear as ?? to us while SM is relevant.  And you're telling me they can just tp to Gnomer?  What a load of horse shit.  The fact that it's OUR dungeon and they still have quicker access to it is so stupid.
---
loot council is the way to go dawg.
---
just show up every week and u will eventually get gear
---
Lol if there's a devilsaur mafia they are failures. I spent all of wed/thurs/fri pushing horde off my favorite spawn point. Got about 40-50 per day in a few hours. I was even able to buy out the AH and reset the devilsaur price (you're welcome alliance farmers) 
---
Not only that but ciroc and one other person were able to drop the price 3g in 48hours. 
---

\#showtooltip Intercept
---
/cast [nostance:3] Berserker Stance
---
So what. So are other classes. So it's more fair and balanced.
---
They're OP but need gear and new spells to be viable? Hmmm, doesnt make sense.
---
Thank you! This is my first ever post.. I thought I will start with this one :)
---
i have afeeling that BLizz will change up the phae release and add atleast 1 bg to phase 2 (Would make sense).
---
No point in releasing the honour system only for bg's to be released another 3 months after......people will do world pvp for a day or 2 then get bored of it. if they release a bg, atleast then it will be an alternate and steadier way to earn honour.
---
I use this, allthough ive stopped using it in battle stance as i want to be able to spam the button and charge. I just have it on the same button across all 3 stance but regular charge on that button in battlestance. you could do it as just the macro but it was annoying me that it would switch to zerk after the charge if i pressed(spammed) it as i was getting into range.
---
 #showtooltip Intercept  
---
/cast [nocombat,stance:1] Charge; [combat,nostance:3] Berserker Stance; [nocombat,nostance:1] Battle Stance; [combat,stance:3] Intercept
---
Your system seems very fair but I would hardly call it loot council. It’s more like dkp without the bidding I would say.
---
Walk above ironforge (from dun morogh), go to menethil, then theramore, and cross the area following the road. Catch up ratchet and whatever quest you have around
---
Way faster to me

It's like working retail or at a fast food restaurant as a teenager: Everyone treats you like shit except for the people who endured the same job or who are empathetic/insightful enough to have respect for you.
---
Excuse me, have you \*not\* experienced the queues on Firemaw?
---
do u hate urself?
---
Nope. They changed it later to that so people could actually buy more than one mount but in vanilla it was always 1000g Mount and 20g Riding-Skill.
---
Not sure FeelsBadMan
---
yes. if they leave the game with intentions of coming back when something happens, it is a break.
---
I was enthralled with this story like the children listening to Bilbo in Fellowship of the Ring. XD
---
Yep I only responded to you because your OPINION sukked bro. Its called realitybending, im a realitybender. I do make my own crafts for the reality. If you say A I say a B. You know what im saying doggie?
---
Phase 2, which could drop any day, lasted almost exactly a month in original vanilla. And that's including a fake week where nobody was pvping while they mailed out physical prizes.
---
I'm not a mage so I might be wrong, but the main interest in playing fire mage is to stack the "Ignite" DoT to stack your dps.
---
If this statement is correct, dungeons fights may not be long enough to stack it in an optimal way.
---
That being said, there fire elem and incendius (BRD) and the 1st boss of UBRS are the only fire-immune dungeon mobs I can think of. So you could probably play fire mage without issues.
---
Don't let them say your spec is not viable. I play SP in dungeons and raid. I like it (and so does the warlock) and it's enough for me.
---
Darn Scots!
---
Lol I buffed and innervated a priest knowing he was gonna go oom buffing me lol
---
Player base technically peaked early into Cata, as the hype was real, but dropped off during Cata pretty hard.
---
So I don't think anyone wants a Cata server.
---
gonna need a resurrection for that I think
---
agreed
---
Same here 2011 MacBook Pro won’t run it even though I could play cata on it just fine
---
You'll regret it until you raid. You'll see the 20 mages and 2 rogues and think "Thank fuck I chose to be a rogue."
---
Trust me.
---
There's only 2 layers max it's easily doable. On fairbanks they aren't doing it though, or are failing miserably.
---
WOW CLASSIC UPDATES R SOO SLOWWWWWW
---
K
---
&gt;They could likely control a few layers
---
There are only 2...
---
We had a hunter get us killed on domo because they wouldn't stop multishotting
---
Thought this was r/Eve for a second
---
If you decide to go ret pally or enhance shammy be prepared to be forced to respecc back and forth between the ret/enhance spec and the holy/restoration spec.
---
Because no one will let you join raids and sometimes even dungeons if you are anything besides healer specc as a pally or shammy. 
---
It sucks but thats just how it is. I would know im an enhance shammy on a PvP realm that cant join any raids because i REALLY dont feel like wasting gold on respeccing constantly.
---
A hearthstone or even a ss would be very appreciated if you feel like you owe them. Really though it’s not a big deal. I feel like a lot of the time people play healers because they want to help others.
---
In war there is no honor. Only losers.
---
While not the same, look into RingMenu
---
Mate, I play a druid. While exping I'm not good at all in pvp (only at carrying a fucking flag) and while dungeonering only to tank or heal.
---
Don't take this the wrong way but maybe it's the way you face this aspect that make it hard to find people to play with. I assure you that I'm not "blessed" in any way. I find my fair share of idiots and assholes but just leave them be in my ignore list and focus on the good people I find.
---
Why do you guys want them to add content at all? Isn't the content they added the whole reason why we're here and not on retail?
---
Generally toxic groups start raging and getting worse after one death though. It's pretty rare that a group that is toxic stays together to complete a dungeon, proficient or not.
---
Cos usually, people that are proficient, aren't toxic. Big difference between toxic vs being critical of mistakes.
---
I transferred every character I had from one server to another with their free character transfer system.  You should be able to unless they changed something.
---
A fair trade, I see.
---
Why give me stuff I need to disable, especially when there are PLENTY of other addons that do the same thing better?
---
No lol not even close. If you have earthshaker you should be doing a lot of damage
---
Winterspring as others have mentioned, one of the busiest end-game spots for Rich Thorium, Black Lotus, Eye if Shadow Blue Dragon Sinew, Icecap, Firewater, Juju's, Frostsabers, etc etc etc. Felwood is a hotbed for Essence of Fire and Water farming, Songflower/Night Dragon/Tubers, Felcloth/Demonic Runes, Timbermaw, etc. Azshara is a popular Felcloth, Demonic Runes, fishing, and herb spot on my server. Ashenvale is a world dragon location.
---
I mean what else are you considering a place for end game content? Dungeons/raids are your criteria? Because that's where people go to zone out of the outdoor world into an instance. Sure there's good PvP for a while like in Blackrock but only until people zone out.
---
Guys I found Jeffree Star's reddit account.
---
And like... friends.
---
I tried to but he ran away on his Ram :P
---
You are scared you won't have good enough gear? Dude I'm level 40 still. I'm scared I won't even be 60 when bwl releases.
---
Nice! Thank you so much
---
Haha
---
First time player here, 37 gnome warrior. I’ve accepted the fact I’ll be taking the robot chicken at 40, but I’d really like to swap mounts ASAP. 
---
Is there a reasonable way to grind exalted in another faction while leveling to 60 so i can get a different epic mount? Or would it just be a ridiculous time sink and not worth?
---
 Don’t really care which mount I just don’t want to ride the chicken forever, it de-immerses me in the game, like how Gimli riding a Model T through Rohan would take you out of the movie.
---
I'm a priest and I confirm. That's our job amirite guys? :D
---
Elwynn, Westfall, Duskwood and Redridge are my go to starter zones for Alliance and the best questing experience. After that I usually grind out XP, farming either skinning or cloth with dungeons to break it up. I'm glad I am not the only one to notice. 
---
If it was just Kalimdor I would understand, that is the heartland of the Horde. But Arathi, Hillsbrad, STV, Hinterlands are alliance near empty.
---
Feralas is just an insult. That a decent hub you need to boat to and the other doesn't have an inn and to get by road you need to run through bears and wolves if you don't want to get killed by Horde guards. Shimmering Flats you want to get to at mid 30s but have fun getting from Desolace to Thousand Needles at that level!
---
I've been using OPie for now.
---
loot council is great if your officers aren't greedy assholes and actually know how to use it correctly. You gotta be the one to judge if that's the case or not. The fact that they shut you down and can't provide explanation is a bad bad sign I'll say that though.
---
I just gave up and bought a krol blade
---
Is it unique? It might be worth getting two of them.
---
It’s difficult to pull but definitely doable at 52. Just not really worth it.
---
Is there an addon the shows the map when inside an area? Such as a cave or a dungeon? Found myself completely lost in the mining caves in Blasted Lands,
---
In the very complicated 9-sided rock-paper-scissors-fire-etc... that is fantasy combat, mages are designed to be the precise foil to a warrior.
---
This goes back to early days of fantasy roleplay, DnD, and even earlier in fantasy lit.  I've always ocnisdered it to be rooted in the core idea of escapist fantasy where the nerds of society are the heroes of their own story and the jocks are overpowered by magic.  
---
if your warrior is incapable of beating a mage 1v1 this is working as intended.
---
Not sure if it it's intended but when I die on the ratchet booty Bay boat, as soon as it goes from one continent to the other I'm always alive with full go. Usually get killed straight away again but at least I make the boat lol
---
It's a meh spec, it works if your guild is cool with it but better off having another rogue or warrior really.  
---
In phase 3 enhance gets to wield nightfall, but even then a lot of guilds toss that to the OT(or even a hunter spamming wing clip)
---
If you look at the aoe grinds almost all of the good ones until about 30 are in alliance exclusive zones.  The other thing people are overlooking is that Stockades is very popular for XP grinding.  None of the horde dungeons are the same way, until SM depending on how you characterize it.  
---
I didn't even realize this was a legitimate discussion to be honest.  I thought it was pretty well known that alliance had the pve speed advantage early, and horde doesn't really catch up until very late in vanilla progression.
---
Mankirk is a Starfleet captain. Mankrik is an orcish widower.
---
I get that your upset that your poorly thought out satirical post wasn't in any way entertaining, but a bit of humility goes a long way. If your post is to shine some light on the piss poor state of whining and low-effort posting on this sub it might do you some service to maybe thing your own post through a bit more. 
---
Anyways food for thought, have fun being butthurt reddit will never be good Bush did 9-11
---
Considering Foror's can entirely fund an epic mount it's a huge upgrade for anyone.
---
I won a forors drop in a pug as a healing pally and sold it to a discount to my main tank in raid, and that still funded a hide of the wild (bis healer Cape), healing power enchant and plenty of consumables.
---
So no way am I passing to the tank even if it's bis for them, because it's also extremely valuable to me.
---
Mages are just as unoriginal in my experience
---
Literally no one ever claimed it stood for "Far Right EthnoNationalist", /r/AgainstHateSubreddits made it up to brigade the sub to get it banned because that's what those morons do.
---
It's the personal interaction for me. I enjoy working toward a common goal with like-minded people. Failure can be frustrating, but positive personal interaction outweighs my dependancy for success.
---
&gt; Another horribly positioned town for alliance
---
That 4 minute run from Stormwind is pretty rough bro.
---
Easier to get hehe. Im at 74 runs and no drop.
---
Mirah's song for sure
---
I sold them for just a bit over 700g. They're BiS for quite a long time.
---
Yea, it was funny because around week 2 and 3 on this sub, people started saying "week 1 I was getting buffed by everyone, now I'm hardly getting buffed at all"
---
This sub attributed it to "the spark" (people's enthusiasm for the game) already dying down some.
---
The reality is the mana cost, I'd love to buff you but I just just buffed the other 3 guys I ran past so I currently have zero mana, sorry :(. When you're a lower level the buffs weren't nearly as costly
---
Kind of like Grom Gol for Horde. Zep to Org, UC. Flight to Booty Bay which can give you a boat to southern Kalimdor. Flight to Kargath/Stonard/etc
---
Playing ret paladin.
---
I tank every dungeon.
---
I off Tank raids.
---
I deal dmg every dungeon.
---
I got gold for tanking because tanks are so rare.
---
I am a great pvp support character (find friends. The strength of paladin is enabling other classes)
---
I have never had a problem with ret paladin expect once I couldn't go into a ony pug run because mooo ret paladin.
---
Paladins are Imo.the best dungeon tanks thanks to their aoe (11 points Holy needed) and are a best healer.
---
Druids are better in pvp thanks to instant travel form.
---
They are also great tanks.
---
I would say get druid. Get feral spec. Learn to tank and you have ZERO problems.
---
For pvp mining and engineer is the best combo
---
o7 CMDR!
---
The only flight path for horde in desolace is at the bottom left corner of the map.
---
Or just like people and drama
---
Oh, okay! Thank you for explaining.
---
it would be cool if they added added some interesting lore quests

I SAID IM FEELIN IT

I just got a HUGE difficulty spike solo questing at level 30. I'm specced frost AoE. Are there any abilities or mechanics I'm overlooking? Using Frost bolt and flame blast single target. Frost Nova and blink away when they get in close. Groups Nova and blizzard. I've tried using cone of cold here and there but it doesn't seem too effective.
---
warrior quests also make you do fucking RFK
---
it's super annoying
---
This is what I do on my healer.
---
Satyr Farm in Felwood or Furbolgs. If it is too contested then it is joining an instance group. Disenchant the drops that are worth less if vendored and use the transmute CD. Pretty much this.
---
This is my current build for all content: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAboZbxtccZx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAboZbxtccZx)

True that. I wonder if it's the beginnings of the Wrathgate incident...

1 in 1000 golden pearl. Not hitting one in 220 clams is not unusual.

With OEB a horde warrior needs 6% hit, what would a human need, 3%?

I love all these quests where I walk 10 ft and turn in for 100xp

That's the follow-up quest. Also, spoilers man.

---
There are two raids at the moment: Onyxia and Molten Core (MC).
---
Onyxia is only one boss and the fight is pretty easy. Organizing a group is rather quick. MC has 10 bosses. To do the last two bosses you need some prep from your group to summon them (Google Aqual Quintessence and Hydraxian Waterlords). Thus organizing a group is harder. The best way to learn about both raids is probably YouTube. There are a lot of mechanics guides out there. Just search for the names. 
---
There is two ways to raid: with a fixed group (guild, friends) or with a PUG (pick up group).
---
I assume you would want to go with a PUG, based on the way you are asking the question.
---
To get into a PUG, firstly you should look up the Best in Slot (BiS) guide for your class and try to get as many items from the list as you can get. PUG raid leaders often do a gear check against this list to make sure the raid is successful. 
---
Secondly you should join the Looking For Group channel on your server and keep an eye out for Ony and MC announcements. Then you try to join these groups and start gathering raid experience. Tell the raid leader that you don't have much experience and would like to have detailed discussing of tactics. A good raid leader will explain the encounters and will generally try to lead the raid assuming people are not experts. 
---
Another tip: check if your server has a discord. Sometimes they announce well organised PUGs on there, too.
---
there are hurdles but its much better than the game just dying, once bc comes out classic servers would be deserted and pretty much dead, classicc+ would be way better upside just look at OSRS
---
Step 1: Make a port warrior
---
Step 2: Advertise your role in /2
---
Step 3: Be flooded with more friends than you know what to do with.
---
You can also set up a discord channel (takes 5 mins) and you'd be amazed how many ppl will join just to shoot the shit with you.
---
&gt;now all that content is invalid because of catchup gear  
---
But that wasnt true in TBC which is what youre complaining about. It wasnt even true for Legion, which is the last time I played retail. For TBC people were still doing Kara pretty much for the entire lifespan of the expac, MGT didnt make it obsolete like your post claims. Even stuff like Gruul was still being ran because even though MGT helped, people still wanted to do those raids and some guilds simply cant do harder raids.  
---
I dont get why people have such a hard on against catch up gear. Means you can level your alts easier, if you have friends who begin playing late in the game it wont take them too long to catch them up to speed, whats the big deal? Like oh they werent suffering through content for half a year to catch up and this is an issue? Again, it doesnt make old content obsolete and if youre in a good guild youll simply fly past the old raid in like 30 minutes as opposed to several hours if you have that 1 raider still needing an item from there. Ive done it before in 3 different xpacs, its not a big deal.
---
Dal'Rend set in 12 kills
---
You're an idiot to think its dying
---
&gt; alliance have Refuge Pointe
---
idk but ive been killed many times while leveling by getting too close. 
---
this just all feels like baseless ranting that isn't actually grounded in reality. Seems like what alliance on this subreddit does best is whining
---
(I know, Little John says "made that up meeself" as his next line.) :)
---
so implement a polling system? Just like OSRS? I can assure you runescape players have 0 faith in Jagex as well, but the polling system has been amazingly successful and the oldschool game has more players than retail. Same could be with classic+
---
Ironfoe is a unique and it’s bis for tanking it drops from emp
---
Cloth turn-ins for rep, but that's a huge money sink. Not sure if there's a better way for you atm tho.
---
Yeah. I’m 27 horde and it hasn’t sent me to SFK yet. Not sure if it will. I just had to take it upon myself to do so.
---
I like how you don't even mention Vol'jin. Poor guy.
---
1800+ queue on my server, which is still layered. So..... Maybe not
---
Currently both Dagger &amp; Sword are the same Combat spec with only a change between weapon specialization. Sword spec does more damage until you can start doing SealFate Dagger spec, but that requires better gear and high crit%
---
Aren't those quests for stuff in Swamp of Sorrows, though?
---
Cry about it Ally noob.
---
I'm leveling my pally faster than my rogue or mage, I think the versatility and being able to send him Gold and gear helps a lot, def if it was your first it's slow but as a alt I think quite fast, full ret atm but heal most dungeons easy! Late game healing is very good and quite easy! Be prepared to wear cloth early on!
---
This.  There just isn’t a lot to do except auto attack and slam judgement when it’s off cool down.
---
your friend the rogue kicks the priest
---
anything else to say, idiot?
---
That would still be nobody
---
I've been playing the game for 2 months and I start to realise how much unfinished the game really is. Would be amazing to see how much on-release content and polish the game would of had if Blizz had more time.
---
Here's mine.  Works from any stance.  
---
/cast \[stance:3\] Intercept; Berserker Stance
---
Sounds like nearly every zone for alliance.
---
My question was answered a lot more than twice. Fortunately, no one else decided to be a prick. Just you.
---
For Reddit....... this doesn't even belong on the internet. Pft
---
Joking about how much mages want for thier magic foods..... How dare you sir.
---
Or madam. Either way.
---
Let the mage downvote conjuring begin.
---
Absolutely love, LOVE the barrens. Not the chat, just the pure questing experience in classic from like 10-20+. After that it sort of falls off and I tend to prefer alliance questing, but I get so excited on a new character to get to the first barrens quests
---
So if it scales the only thing that matters is dps?
---
5 subscriptions on one account, multiboxing with ISBoxer
---
&gt; that being deep prot significantly increases mitigation
---
i never said "deep prot"
---
that's all YOU GUYS trying to make up shit. **the fact of the matter is someone going prot HAS the 5 points in it, and your fury spec doesn't**
---
that is the only relevant thing, and i'm on the winning side of the argument despite your bullshit attempts to make semantics
---
If you only want to pvp then enhancement is fine, albeit it's a below average class compared to others at end game (it's powerful while leveling, but scales extremely poorly).
---
 If you want to raid you'll either need to get lucky with a guild or go resto.
---
Keep in kind most hybrid gear in raids is healing gear.
---
Hotw druid can actually be a decent tank, dps, or healer in the same spec. I ran one once and AV was amazing because I could tank or heal with just a gear swap.
---
They say in classic if your class has a heal button you only heal. While a slight exaggeration, you are still a healer and often will need to do so. It's best if you enjoy it.
---
&gt; You're really overestimating how much a couple DM blues really make things easier.
---
No, actually you're completely misunderstanding my argument.  As the patches went on, many pieces of dungeon gear were improved.  They did this to allow players who were further behind in progression to catch up.  The gear that is included in the game now is upgraded to the point to serve as a catch up mechanic for Naxx level players.  That's not to say this gear will suit you in Naxx (although that may actually be possible for highly skilled players), but this gear is upgraded to the point that players have a path open to become a Naxx raider.  It is far far better than the versions initially included when vanilla launched.  I can understand how you'd think that way when you compare DM gear to the rest of the dungeon sets, but it's a fallacious argument argument since everything has been upgraded.
---
I like to think it's a precursor to the Wrathgate.
---
Oh sorry. Maybe we should travel back in time and ask them to rip a hole in the world somewhere else
---
Go mining and you can stealth mine in the tunnels in silithus
---
Second floor of Goldshire inn, the room with 2 beds. Don't ask how I know.
---
I noticed this happening with my Panda Cub, too. Is it Panda-specific? I have zero memory of this occurring in Vanilla.
---
Take your nostalgia goggles off and realise that 'a big chunk of the game' was simply boring. People were going through the game world in vanilla only because that was the only option, not because it was interesting. But you're pretending that it was because you're delusional.
---
I'm leveling a mage for gold farming and having a caster DPS after a druid feels fresh af.
---
This, I love
---
we aren't? link please.
---
I regret killing Whitemane.
---
He's emphasizing the best he can via text by capitalizing ONE word in his post. Chill.
---
You stated that it doesn't make sense that gear is funneled to one or two inviduals, but that's *entirely* the point of LC; stacking upgrades on one character is a bigger gain overall compared to splitting gear amongst several players.
---
Who would make better use of that ToEP? The Mage who has a few pieces of pre-bis and a rag-tag bunch of Frozen Wrath greens, or the already-stacked Mage that has several percent more Crit chance? Would that Onslaught Girdle be better on the Warrior who already has Deathbringer and Brutality Blade, or the one who is still using a Thrash/Mirah combo? Do you think it's better for the interest of the raid if the Hunter tier is split between players rather than giving one Hunter 8/8 and Rhok'delar?
---
People love the idea of LC, then shout it down when they quickly realise it's not them who is the chosen one. And there comes the downfall of the system - people tire when they don't even get an opportunity at an item even after several weeks. Combine this with the ease of abuse of the system (notice how it's generally the officers and the raid leader's clique who are considered "the best option" while never providing proof and just spout the player is "committed"?) and it's easy to see why LC should only be used in the most dedicated guilds with a consistent team who understand the purpose of the system.
---
LC isn't a system most people are happy with. There are plenty of guilds that run other systems.
---
It’s pretty slow, I levelled my paladin fine and didn’t think to much of it until I made a hunter and the difference in speed was pretty noticeable.
---
That being said if you’re making a twink why does 60 matter?
---
for me the classic+ would be 100% the same game except more npcs, quests, items, dungeons and raids.  no changes in game mechanics.
---
I trust that could do this. I don't think they will do it in this way, it's not flashy enough , not commercial enough.
---
Horde is ez mode in pretty much every aspect of the game
---
I know it's a horde zone but Ratchet isn't that far from wc, rfk and rfd.
---
Plenty of people did Stocks on the few pservers I rolled on. Bunch of quests to do there and it's a super fast instance. Definitely prefer it over rfc. 
---
Kargath fp probably isn't much closer than the fp in loch modan. Mara favors horde a bit, but not that big of a deal. 
---
The run to SM is definitely bullshit for alliance. 
---
Alliance brm access is worth any travel distance difference while leveling imo. You're hitting those instances weekly from like 55+ through the end of classic. Horde either has to set hearth to Kargath or deal with a zeppelin/long flight.
---
21/0/30 shaman, plenty capable healing or dps in dungeons or healing in raids.  Really versatile in pvp
---
I've always thought the Alliance Hinterlands Hub was basically empty? so strange
---
Don't they just use that searing gorge quest staff with 0.5s swing speed?
---
Next to zepelin
---
Yes but also modifiers [alt, shift, ctrl] so you don’t have to remap keys
---
most of the fixes were already made and ready for implementation into vanilla. tbc was a late idea to milk more money (sell the game again) and the fixes were held back as to make sure tbc would have a good chunk of content on launch.
---
i don't see why the fixes and non-exclusive tbc content couldn't be added to classic.
---
Fren was a thing for years. 4chan memed it up and the media bought it. 
---
The ok-sign was memed up. 
---
Pepe has been a 4chan thing for years. 
---
It’s not so much the scary spooky right wing making up secret gang-signs or stealing innocent memes; it’s that American news sources are nothing short of garbage tier that they eat literally any bait up. And since they all either support the blue or red tribe, a bunch of the people there eat it up too. 
---
tl;dr, an entire nation’s culture is being played by autists on a Croation throat singing forum.
---
That one guy with the piccolo.
---
I don't cry to blizzard, I just gank every horde I see regardless of level. They can have some adversity
---
Yesh, but low levels still give no honor. The places you should be worried about are: BRM, Dire maul courtyard, lights hope, and FP at every 40+ town (like gadget, ungoro, etc). Oh and every boat and zepp
---
Watch.
---
It would be like paying 15k for your divers license and 300 bucks for your car.
---
pffft, teach me? I am the one doing it all!
---
Worst still is that your a clothie. That's like having a rat enter a snakes den. Rogues were made to kill you in classic.
---
So you 1v5'd by having four people jump off the boat while the fifth person killed you
---
The auto attack gameplay is a bit boring, especially if you miss twice, then the mob parries and dodges, at this point you're just standing there not really doing much. But yeah you're also pretty much indestructible and your lvl 40 mount is kinda free so...
---
believe what you want.
---
Frens was a thing long before reddit. You’re eating bait, my man.
---
Man, you must melt so fast if you think a complaint or criticism is toxic.
---
Flight path isn't even in the city.  Darnasuss is a terrible capital.
---
It has a FP and inn

PST Littleicy, GM of Censored. We’re really just getting into raiding ourselves but we have a good group of folks getting geared. Tell him Uncommon sent you.
---
I mean it was an honest story, I liked it
---
mhmmm, salt.
---
“Accomplishing nothing” bruh you’re playing a 15 year old video game. Sounds like OP had fun.
---
Yeah sure, maybe when I was 18 and took video games super seriously because my life wasn’t going anywhere.
---
But as an adult, fuck that.
---
what for? once you go 61+ all lvl 60 progress permanently stops for all characters, invalidating literally all content such as naxxramas, legendary quests, items, loot skill ranks, crafting, etc. an entirely new endgame would need to be engineered for lvl 65, with new dungeons, new class balance, new raids, new items, new spells, new talents, new quests, new everything. might as well just add TBC.
---
What is considered the very best boe world drop to get?
---
Nostalgia? Been playing for years mate, I thought I was having fun all this time, turns out all this time it was the old nostalgia tricking me again, damn. 
---
Going through the world because it was the only option is exactly the important part. It forces you to interact and get into fights, shit like that makes the world feel alive and dangerous. It changes the dynamic of the game entirely if you add the option to skip everything by flying over it 2km in the sky. If you can't wrap your head around this simple little concept, I can't help you.
---
Have you not seen Druids at all, or just not as tanks? Because if you're leveling as Feral, you might as well tank a few dungeons, and only a masochist would not level as feral.
---
&gt;yeah wiping is so much fun

*squints*

&gt;wiping

&gt;fun

&gt;rogue

&gt;hehehehe

---
I’m not grouping with you and your vanishing ass.
---
Restating it doesn't make it any less weak.
---
It's catchup for BWL and AQ, not naxx. At this point, it really doesn't matter.
---
If it's such a big deal, why are you still playing? If private servers handle it better, why aren't you on them?
---
Alliance scum.
---
Why not use them both utilising double exp...
---
Its literally the same argument for retail. Classic will kill retail etc etc. It won't. There will always be a population of people who just enjoy playing classic. Considering there have been classic pservers, bc servers, and wotlk servers all with healthy population speaks otherwise.
---
I think that's a mage ability tbh. So there probably wont be
---
I've been leveling an undead rogue with WoWLive guide and I really recommend it. 
---
It's not perfect, but it is really streamlined and easy to use.
---
Ya that's cheap. 1g standard for anything. Lockbox, food, water, portal etc.
---
Looks good! I was thinking of getting guidelime and using that to level an alt but i might try your guide instead
---
Or wetlands, or Desolace, or Hillsbrad, or ...
---
Do you mean... The side action bars?
---
Correct
---
what the actual fuck
---
The outlands (well, hellfire peninsula at least) was planned for vanilla as well. There's no telling what a wow classic, but with all the BC content would have looked like. The best thing would be not having the massive ilvl jump that invalidates the classic content.
---
\&gt;Exception of the blackrock area  
---
So, the two first 40man raids, where the majority of the players play and the only 10 man raid? I seem to remember my Hearthstone set to Kargath for the majority of vanilla on Horde, on alliance I didn't really have that problem.
---
Didn't see that one coming! Great story!
---
Sorry they didn’t take the time to understand your nuanced situation. I think that others advice to join discord on here is good, just to be in there as most people aren’t taking the time to understand the case of each raider. 
---
Hope this didn’t hurt your friends feelings. If it doesn’t work out with this group or guild join another! But don’t get too upset if ppl do something dumb once like this.
---
Ubrs last boss should be a skull, but is lvl 63, which was changed sometime in wotlk.
---
My classic experience is pretty much on point with how it was. So.
---
Agreed
---
maybe you just play like shit?
---
it's not. the difference is. there is new content for retail, and there is currently phases for classic adding new content. if you fragment the current classic population into tbc, without giving the classic community new content. it will die. we have already seen this happen in other games that inspired classic (runescape 'classic' - they started producing new content). pservers always die too, after naxx cycle. what they do to get around this problem as they can't add new content to the game, is to reset the servers and start from scratch, everyone back to lvl 1.
---
Thinking of rerolling a Priest and need honest opinions..... are Dwarfs THAT much better then Night Elf’s?? I really wanna make a NE but I can see why Fear Ward is absurdly good.
---
He's a good boy! Definitely well taken care of.
---
Jumping up onto a roof doesn't require exploits or abuse. Not bannable :\^)
---
Sword is better for lvling.
---
If you get good daggers at 60, then you can be on par with sword spec rogues in raids.
---
I myself have perdition and core hound, and im doing a bit more or the same dps as our vis kag / brutalizer rogue.
---
Dagger rogue Will dominate when AQ comes out, like, a lot, so there is that.
---
You sure? This was the retaliation on what you are doing to hillsbrad everyday. (check the quest texts).
---
Lard Lost his Lunch! is like my favortie quest
---
Da Spirits have granted him clarity, but he was dead before he could appoint Sylvanas.
---
One word: Paladins. 
---
Some more words: 
---
Alliance is very clearly the dev team’s pet faction in classic. 
---
I don’t think they ever expected the adult player base to gravitate toward horde in the way that they did during vanilla.
---
Wetlands Is mostly Like this with the exception of the dark iron quests in the north, the raptor dig site, and the moss fender guy in the middle
---
The alliance favored zones are like 10-25 though
