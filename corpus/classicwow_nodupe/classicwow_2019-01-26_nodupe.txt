&gt;That's why they made the (unblizzlike) decision to outright ban all loot transfering.
---

---
This is 100% the best solution (aside from billionaire company Activision Blizzard actually paying for adequate customer support, which we all know is not worth discussing).

&gt; one of my favorite things to do was kill a horde who was mining and then steal their mining node.

Can confirm "Beta: BFA" is gone from the drop down on the launcher but was there yesterday.
---
?? There is no major difference in lvl 60 arms or fury in how they fare in 1v1 apart from arms having a slight chance vs healers.
---
The GM should have told you to do one. Imagine wasting their time with that pettiness, Just live with simple mistakes no one is going to lose sleep over not getting that loot piece (I would hope)
---
&gt;I just don’t understand people’s fear that their groups will be full of groups of friends that will box them out of loot. Is that common in current wow?
---
People are scared of it becasue we are the people who will be doing it. I will only run in groups of 4 and will steal what ever the PuG wants even if I dont want it and now I straight up have the excuse of "my friend wants it"
---
Current wow all loot is personal and just appears in your bags if you happen to get lucky
---
&gt; I see priests flash healing in raids just so that they actually get a heal on a target before a paladin. It is so inefficient but hey the meters look nice right.
---
As a priest in a raid, we're also flash healing just so that we actually get a heal on a target before a different priest does. :-P But the downside of topping someone up is usually zero while the downside of not topping someone up is that they die and you get yelled at.
---
Also even if *I* know that I am an awesome priest who is managing their mana carefully for emergencies and keeping an eye on the big picture, if I have zero healing on the meter because every gheal I cast I cancel because every gheal I cast gets ninjad with five Flash Heals, I am not sure the raid leader knows I am being awesome. They probably think I am AFK. So it's not just about healers using the meter as an epeen measurer, it's also about worrying that officers who don't know jack about healing will use it as an epeen measurer.
---
So I think during WOD they made the change, and it didn’t really revive twinking because gear scales down in BGs so that even if your decked out your barely 2% stronger than a player in heirloom gear. they also made a change around the same time so that legacy gear sets are inactive in pvp.
---
I think the reason why it's near 50/50 is that the horde is a truly ugly faction to most people. It's also considered to have the better racials by most people.
---
Back in the day people flocked to Ally because the horde were considered ugly as I said. So most servers I remember massively favored alliance. I now think the perception of the horde as the "better" faction is now balancing it's pop against being the ugly one.
---
Point being I think the Allies might be in for a world wind of pain. Just based on how both factions look. Horde will be loaded with try hards and, alliance will be filled with casuals. I worry about that far more then the actual numbers to be honest.
---
It would thrill me to no end to find out my precious horde will be out numbered 5 to one again. As a lowbie you get would get ganked from every angle. Always outnumbered. It built a seething hatred in the horde. It culled the weak and, made those who stayed strong. Just being a 60 horde on a classic pvp server used to say something about your tenacity as a player.
---
I dont really care why it happens , whether you are a meter whore or just letting ppl know you arent afk. Its still poor play and the reason for it doesn't really change my argument.
---
&gt;They're only using sharding at the beginning 
---
Oh you sweet summer child. Sharding about to hit us all like a ton of bricks and never be turned off. 
---
Fuck it, Add tokens and duel spec and character boosts while we at it too. 
---
It's not going to matter. Like said above, blizz will just offer server transfers after a month, because money. Sharding "in only the starting zones" (w/e the fuck that's suppose to mean) will make all wpvp a joke, so its not gonna matter if its 1:1 or 4:1
---
Why? What is the point of a PvP server of you cannot kill another player?
---
&gt; I mean if you take that argument to the extreme then rogues are bad. Ideal raid comp would take a fuy warrior over a rogue everytime.
---
You get it. Rogues aren't *bad* because there are lots worse, but they are *not as good* as a fury warrior (in the 1.12 world where threat doesn't matter). They're really only there to take rogue loot the warriors don't want, and because you can't get all the warriors you want.
---
&gt; Moreover, rogues are worse than hunters because you need even less of them in the average raid. Right?
---
I guess, in a really weird and contrived situation. You'd rather have zero rogues than zero hunters. But once you have enough hunters for tranq shot, rogues are better because they do more DPS and tranq shot is covered.
---
I can see you are struggling here to come up with a creative definition of "bad" to put in my mouth that will sound absurd, but it is not working very well.
---
Normally I hardly ever see players in hardly any zones.
---
Last night I tried a new char and the starting zone was packed. Was taking me ages to do quests and everyone was tagging them quickly and then multiple players were hanging around waiting for them to respawn. Is that good? Bad? I can't really decide. On the one hand, slow questing was a pain. On the other hand, it was so nice to see people again!!
---
Seems like a good decision to me. And yet another piece of evidence that points to people playing twinks to one shot lowbies and not for "a different meta" or whatever else excuse people use when they don't want to admit that they're just doing this to one shot lowbies. 
---
I'm kinda considering building an anti twink guild, its only purpose being raiding the opposite faction's capital and camping twinks. I wonder how many people would be interested. 
---
First main was an undead warlock that I kept until wrath when I fell in love with death knights.  Warlock is likely going to be my first character to level in classic, though possibly pushed out by a tauren warrior because I really got to enjoy tanking.
---
yep allakhazam was around the EQ, SWG and DAoC. I used them for all of them iirc.
---
you're talking about changing a fundamental aspect, skewing balance even further just because some people are going to get unlucky once in a while with a string of bad rng while leveling? really?
---
Agreed!
---
Draenei shamans make total sense since they had shamans-ish guys in warcraft 3.
---
He's taking the quote out of context. For one they said they didn't *want* to touch the numbers or database, but moreover this falls under the category of progressive itemisation. What they specifically were referring to was changing things to non-vanilla values, but progressive itemisation doesn't fall under that.
---
Hahah so funny, you're the first one to ever realize this XD ecsdee

Same model, different color.
---
One of the evilest things I do is get naked and Mind Control people in the middle of town. As long as they're closer to the guards, they rush in and kill them before they turn on me. But what do I care? I'm naked.
---
1. Neither will Classic champ. Spell batching doesn't exist in it.
---
2. GPU is not servers.
---
&gt; I dont really care why it happens , whether you are a meter whore or just letting ppl know you arent afk. If your officers are using HPS as epeen measure, then they are just as bad as the meter whore healers.
---
Agreed, but back in the day it just not the case that every guild had only competent officers, especially if the guild was not the best of the best.
---
&gt; Its still poor play and the reason for it doesn't really change my argument. My argument being that druids would top meters if all healers played optimally.
---
Is the following a correct summary?
---
1. Healing meters don't mean anything.
---
2. Your proof that druids are good is that they would top the healing meters, in a world where every healer is effectively part of a super-intelligent hive mind that optimises for mana efficiency over 100% health uptime.
---
If so isn't this answering the wrong question? The right question would be something like this: You are a competent raid leader. Your raid has a full set of healers including two druids. One raider who isn't a druid quits. All else being equal, do you want the replacement to be (a) a druid or (b) not a druid? If your goal is to make progress in the real world where your healers are not a super-intelligent hive mind.
---
I don't know much and only ask out of ignorance: couldn't it mean they're putting up a new beta for an upcoming BFA patch?
---
if its non cross realm and not a pvp server, that 10% has insta bg queues.
---
Firstly, when dealing with a hunter- No thing is fair. Secondly, all it needs to be is equitable for a hunter to roll need. Half the time anyway..
---
You do realize that there will be more than one server, right?
---
Dreams of using hand of rag? You must be a hunter..
---
Dwarf Priest will keep it balanced. I think a lot of the hardcore min-max groups are going to roll on Alliance for this (and human warrior).
---
What is your definition of bad then? Why don't you just outright state it instead of accusing me of putting something in your mouth?
---
Wait didn't you already say it?
---
"To lack mechanics - like good DPS or good heals - that reward bringing more than the minimum necessary."
---
Necessary is a strong word. I don't think any class is truly necessary. So if the minimum necessary is 0 for all classes, then everytime you take a class you are taking more than the minimum necessary.
---
Druids do have mechanics that reward bringing more than the minimum necessary. 2 Innervates is nice, so is 2 Battle Res. In the extreme case, there could be some fights where being able to switch to a DPS on a dime is also valuable although this never seems to happen in practice.  The number of paladins brought to the raid is typically just the "minimum necessary" to get all the blessings you can. 
---
Yea so rogues are bad and worse than hunters under your definition. Hunters are better than rogues and warlocks and druids.
---
The minimum necessary rogues is 0. The minimum necessary hunters is 3 or 4. You then argue that bringing more  than min. rogues is better than bringing more than min. hunters because their dps is better. But you would still rather take a warrior. 
---
The issue is that a class is more than their raw DPS and HPS. They are everything they bring to the raid. Just because the optimal balance ends up having more than one class than another, doesn't mean they are bad. 
---
My definition of bad would be "You would rather have a different class/spec in the raid than them"
---
RIP tanks with skill. Horde could kill Onyxia aswell - even without undead warriors.
---
Treating players like they are literal children is how they got into BFA's mess in the first place.
---
Happy Cake day!
---
Monitor faction balance at the global level, and set the balance thresholds on a per-server basis at the global target level.  Don't let individual server balance stray more than 5% from worst case (ie target balance) nor let it go beyond 50/50 in favor of the global underdog.  If your faction is over one of these thresholds, ie the topdog pop is 5% over the 60/40 global target, or underdog 5% is over the 50/50 server target, offer free transfers.
---
The most fun I ever had with twinking was the 70 bracket during mists, only queuing into other decked out toons is a good thing and created some of the most bursty games I’ve ever seen in wow.
---
I think the other thread is a better summary of my viewpoint. Who is the one trying to put absurd statements in the other's mouth again?
---
Then you’ve not listened to Ion at all. 
---
Nice. 
---
The reason why combat daggers is better in pre bis raids comes down to where they get damage from. Obviously this is classic so white hits mean a lot for both swords and daggers but, They mean more to swords. Daggers have a higher % of their damage tied into yellow hits.
---
Why is this important? Chances are the dummy you tested on isn't level 63. This means that you are "hitting" it more then you should be. So you are not missing or getting glancing blows like you should be. Daggers gets around this by putting more of it's damage into yellow hits. Which require less hit raiding to make contact on a boss. So when you actually go to a raid you will deal more damage on daggers.
---
What did that have to do with making our voices heard? If they don't listen that sucks, but if we don't express our opinions there is 0 chance we see the game we want. 
---
I think if you are rolling ally Dwarf priest is sexy as hell. If you prefer pve ally is the way better faction as well. All of that being said. Don't you count out Undead Shadow priests attracting try hards. Shaking their little asses with WoF and, Devouring Plauge lol.
---
If looking for max dps you don't run daggers due to 1.9 being included in 1.12, until you get Perdition's which will be beat by the epic swords, which means you only take it if you prefer it in PvP. Daggers were a bit better in real Vanilla because SS didn't proc sword specials. They become ok again in like late AQ gear with Seal Fate.
---
The combat dagger spec is here if you want to play it as are all the other specs you will have during progression.

I do the same and love daggers to (for PvP). Just don't expect top loot if loot council. It's gonna go to the sword rogues.
---
Because DM is out and that mugger belt with dagger skill on it, felstriker (don't count on it dropping) might be close on horde side to Dal'rends or beat them slightly, maybe. Sure someone could do the math. Like I said though good luck on it dropping.
---
Also a dummy ain't a boss. :) White hits are messing with the numbers.

I get it, but we've got to be loud so they don't scratch their heads like apes and wonder why no ones playing when they muck it all up with their modern garbage.

Considering all of those investors. Invested in a company who's motto was. "We make great games". A motto that made them one of the most successful gaming companies in history. I would say maximizing their profits would be to make a "great game" after all if they do pull shit like sharding. I won't be playing. Most of you won't be either. If you were you would be playing BFA. Not on forums wishing for a real game to come back out and, save you from the crap.

The thing is i know it comes from the neck, because if i press on the left side high up on the neck it hurts a lot (left side of head), the headache is the same place. But like i said if i stream 12 hours without cam = nothing happens, after just 2-4 hours with cam = i get this headache

Nightelf priest shadowstalking at the lift in thousand needles then MCing them out of stealth and making them take the faster way down there.
---
Not a vanilla story but a TBC story, I was levelling a Dranaei priest because I was bored, on a PvE server and I did some Wetlands quest or other that flagged you for PvP. I would never normally flag up, I was a man of peace, but it was no big deal because there wasn't much activity and most people were chill and wouldn't start trouble even if you were flagged.
---
But I ran into two equal-level Alliance who were not chill and immediately attacked me. I really didn't want to PvP, and anyway it would have been 2v1, so I didn't even counterattack I just ran off HoTing and shielding and using my racial and generally saying "leave me alone dudes seriously I don't wanna fight". But those two fuckers would *not* stop. I didn't lift a finger to damage them but they still chased me halfway across the bloody map from Menethil Harbor, and eventually I was starting to run out of mana, health, cooldowns and tricks. Clearly they didn't care that they were wasting their time and wouldn't even get anything good if they killed me, they didn't care that I wouldn't even put up a fight, for them it was all about ruining my day for its own sake.
---
At that point I realised they could not be bargained with, could not be reasoned with and absolutely would not stop. So what were my options?
---
All I could think of was a tower, still some ways away, that happened to have some Horde NPCs nearby. I couldn't even remember if they were the kind that attacked Alliance or not but it seemed like my only option so I drank a potion, reoriented on where I thought the tower was and kept running like hell, zig-zagging around the mobs and fearing them off when I had to.
---
I made it into the tower with about 20% health and no mana, breaking LOS and giving me a chance to bandage. And yes, it turned out there were Horde NPC guards and they would attack Alliance PCs and they killed both those arseholes before they could get to me.
---
And you better believed I camped those two jerks after that. They died pretty close to the tower and the moment they rezzed they got a DoT and a Mind Blast and if they tried to get near me I ran back into aggro range of the NPCs. After rezzing by themselves and  getting killed they tried both rezzing at once but that didn't end well either. After dying three more times each they gave up.
---
Once my PvP flag fell off I went about my business. I was, after all, a man of peace.
---
Be careful though... I spent way too much time playing when I was 15 and it had impact
---
Honestly I just wish Ion's mother had listened to the father about that "needed" abortion.
---
Who is Ion and, what did he say?
---
As for your question. Yes probably another druid unless we desperately need a dwarf priest or something. Not sure about horde side.
---
yeah another "wow" moment for me was when i travelled to ironforge from stormwind (through lakeshire and burning steppes etc) to meet up with my guildies, and my friend then told me there was a train, i was like what?? There is a train!!?? 
---
You people actually believe Blizzard execs cared for you in the beginning, it's so cute.

looks like nobody else is there yet op, better ring all the guildies phone numbers and let them know Ysondre is up.

People consistently interchange 'viable' with 'optimal'.

Everything is viable, even ret.

I am confused. What are you saying? Are you saying 2005 they had the same "we are just a business" attitude they have now? Because that statement is indefensible based on their catalog of games.
---
I feel like paladin is just strictly better than shaman for blessings and judgements. I've been horde for 14 years too :/
---
This is my biggest worry as well
---
Nah. It has one extra T.
---
&gt; Um what?
---
People are still trying to claim that classic wont be able to support city raids basically. They are claiming that since a raid on live crashed the server some months ago that when classic comes we wont be able to have city raids at all because hardware cannot support it.
---
No, they aren't joking, these morons are serious and don't understand how a few minor changes to infrastructure can allow server systems to handle the loads easily. They will continue to make this claim until beta is out and.... the FIRST thing people do is a city raid and record it proving this bullshit wrong.
---
Long wait until then though.
---
You actually think classic is going to be such a massive success based on absolutely evidence. Most of the people who will be on classic will be tourists, just like launch day when sub numbers explode and then get chopped in half. There is no such thing as a sure thing in business, and when a company like Blizzard is publicly traded, they have to make sure they provide for their shareholders first and the fans second. This isn't Vivendi where the stocks where private. 
---
Good shit. Thatt'l teach that scum to gank.

I think we might be on the same team and, talking past each other.

&gt;75:25 in favour of Horde.
---

---
Absolutely. As a warlock you and anyone who you choose can have undending breath.
---
Yeah they are very strong with good gear. A warrior in r14 gear is near-unstoppable.
---
Glad to hear you were able to rise above it
---
&gt; Necessary is a strong word. I don't think any class is truly necessary. So if the minimum necessary is 0 for all classes, then everytime you take a class you are taking more than the minimum necessary.
---
I think you know you are being silly. Can we have a conversation where you don't try to twist my words into the most absurd thing possible?
---
In this context "necessary" obviously means something like "necessary to perform the critical functions like tranq shot or tanking without getting crushed that are such an important part of progression raiding everyone takes them for granted". Not "so necessary the raid will 100% wipe on the spot without it no matter what the other details of the scenario".
---
&gt; Druids do have mechanics that reward bringing more than the minimum necessary. 2 Innervates is nice, so is 2 Battle Res. 
---
If this was enough to make them actually good everyone would be stacking druids to stack those sweet Innervates and battle rezzes. But they do not. Because even counting the Innervate the consensus seems to be you are better off with two priests than with one priest and one druid who Innervates the priest.
---
&gt; Yea so rogues are bad and worse than hunters under your definition. Hunters are better than rogues and warlocks and druids.
---
Sorry, but you do not get to twist or fabricate "my definition" and say stupid things like this. If you can't have a conversation like an adult then we aren't going to have a conversation.
---
&gt; The issue is that a class is more than their raw DPS and HPS.
---
No shit, Sherlock. The problem is that the reality of vanilla raiding is that most classes are not much more than their raw DPS and HPS, and that frequently their utility is either not worth a lack of DPS/HPS, or you get 100% of the utility with only one or two members of the class, or both.
---
That's why people want to stack warriors who have close to zero utility but do a lot of DPS. You could say "herp derp but an enhance shaman has utility" and you would right that it has utility and still be an idiot because it does not have enough utility to offset the lack of DPS in a raid that has resto shamans.
---
&gt; They are everything they bring to the raid. Just because the optimal balance ends up having more than one class than another, doesn't mean they are bad.
---
Like I said before, if you make up your own bizarre definition of "bad" (and stuff an equally bizarre definition of "bad" in my mouth) I guess you can get to that conclusion. But to get there you have to muddy the waters to the point where "good" and "bad" have no meaning.
---
Taking everything into account, some classes *are* bad in the very relevant and meaningful sense that you take the bare minimum necessary (as normal people who aren't trying to be dicks grasp the term) and then go out of your way to avoid taking any more.
---
Wait you were leveling a Dranaei priest and Alliance attacked you?
---
Whats wrong with the definition of bad that I provided?
---
Warrior is god can confirm. I've leveled so many of them. I love the tourture because it forces you to play better / more careful and that is good as a tank
---
My main in vanilla was a tauren warrior. And the min/maxer in me is telling me to pick orc. But my WC3 nostalgia is screaming tauren
---
Not necesarily. Yes it might not be fun. But that’s what class difficulty was all about. And i bet you we can find a video of any class with any spec that’s r11+ and kicking ass. But they needed determination and SKILL. If you don’t wanna put that in just roll a rogue or lock.
---
Pandering to “everybody is equal” is how we got the bland game we see today. Because somebody will always fill they are playing “the worst class” and will complain about it on the forums.
---
I always liked how DAoC and Planetside handled this - the smaller faction got an xp boost. 
---
They can't because they don't understand how sharding works at the technical level nor why is breaks when it does. Guys like him think they're so good at the game, have no achievements worth talking about, quit in WotLK, and consider themselves diehard fans while they get farmed by the retail glads and complain about balance that has never been existent in any Blizzard game. Nostalrius wasn't even Blizzlike btw, half the talents ended up just being point dumps, scripting was atrocious, the servers were like triple the population of retail vanilla and spawn timers were completely off. Nost was garbage and fed nostalgia for thousands of manbabies everywhere who have never done any kind of difficult content in their life without paying for it. 
---
It sounded like you were suggesting we stay silent and just pray that Blizzard backs down from bad changes they're trying to implement in your first post?
---
I started twinking 2 months ago, and thats 95% of what I do in WoW atm. The last 5% is farming old Dungeons for transmorgs for the twinks (you can transmorg your gear to look like lvl 60 gear from lvl 1)
---
With Dungeons and loot scaling to your lvl when they drop, makes it easy to gear up pretty cheap. Ive think on a real where I hardly had anything and now I have 4 solid geared twinks and working on more, so its not expensive anymore to make decent twinks
---
With that said, I dont plan on twinking in classic
---
(For people who dont know, players who has turned of XP, and players who hasnt, are in the same BGs again)
---
In vanilla there are basically none.
---
I'm fairly confident that we will see servers surviving such an overload. What does worry me is that GMs actually stepped in and intervened in the raid as it was happening by teleporting players outside during said incident
---
If you want to argue the actual point then you can try responding to the actual words I wrote and not a strawman, you coward.
---
There's no doubt some people designing the game browse this reddit, there's been quit a few good ideas so far.  Like mixing the vanilla server names up into "battle groups" and no one can have a matching name between any of them.  Shrink as needed, I just hope they look at population numbers to make them as even as possible for future populations going from like 4 to 2 etc.
---
There's always server merging if it's REALLY bad.
---
I'm continually stunned by the sheer number of people who've had bad experiences with ninja looting hunters in the past.
---
Patches are pushed to the PTR rather than beta. Different branch.
---
Still not getting how multiple warrior tanks is necessary but multiple priests/paladins is just a luxury. Taken for granted is awfully subjective

Please be horde and play on RP-PvP server. I'd love to have a mage friend to talk to. I can't buff people beyond lesser invisibility sight and Unending Breath and those arn't always useful, but I do like mass producing Healthstones while on zeppelins. 
---
Wrong way around. IFF you have a well balanced raid with good gear, consumes, world buffs, etc then raiding can be easy.
---
Mages will be expected to deal damage during raids. After a few weeks of raiding you won't really need to make much food but water is always in high demand.
---
Outside of the level of the "training dummy" which could effect weapon skill depending on how you tested:
---
It's also possible you've trained a higher rank of Backstab and Eviscerate than would be available in pre-raid gear (the AQ20 books). Backstab would be roughly a wash (assuming the SF spec is the 1/5 DW spec), however eviscerate is absolutely used more by SF.
---
Also you should really clarify how you tested. "Lack of cooldown use", what does this mean? Using AR/BF for Combat but not BF/CB for SF? Or not using AR/BF/CB at all?
---
Loot sharing good, sharding bad.
---
It's also promoting #changes. Either you want authentic 2500 caps or you don't want vanilla, you can't have both 
---
I'm pretty sure it's just a joke.  
---
My first was a Paladin, but I don't count him because I stopped after level 20.  
---
My actual main was a Mage, followed by a Tankadin in TBC.  I'm gonna roll a Druid because change of pace.

Even Vanilla was an unfinished game that pulled people in because it was the super casual version of Everquest, and only because Sony killed EQ2 and SWG. Vanilla was great, but it was nothing to dickride old Blizzard for, especially when it shipped out a mess and people just dealt with it because that's how things were back then. Had classic released today as a brand new game, it would have died in months only to be mentioned in "top 10 anticipated games that didn't live up to their potential" videos. 
---
He got down voted because it's an ignorant statement. Yes companies have obligations to their shareholders, but that doesn't mean they forgo all product design and customer relations. If they believe Classic gets more money by keeping tokens out, they will do it.
---
Classic is useful to Blizzard for a number of reasons:
---
- it gets a ton of lapsed subscribers from earlier expansions to resub 
---
- it allows current subscribers who are in a lull with retail content to use their sub on something else
---
- likewise classic players bored with current content may find retail to be fun and maintain their sub (+ pay for future expansions)
---
Introducing a bunch of retail monetisation schemes is likely to largely impact the first and third points, which in turn hurt the second point (due to a dead community in classic).
---
I'm sure Blizzard will constantly run the numbers, and if they believe introducing tokens makes more money for then than it loses in subs on a long term view, they'll do it. But to assume they will just blindly introduce it because investors is incredibly short sighted. I know that's a common pitfall of companies but behind public outrage there's usually some logical economics behind those kind of decisions.
---
Leaving tokens purely in retail is likely beneficial anyway - players are forced to buy the latest expansion if they want to farm for a token, as opposed to not paying anything to do it in classic.
---
A good hunter can break top 10 dps but they're really there for tranq shots and kiting. A hunter who can execute kiting strats is an asset to a raid, but you don't need many of them so usually they're competing for raid spots. In AQ and Naxx it gets really bad because you only need 2 of them, so the rest are just subpar dps more or less.
---
You didn't make a point you clown you just made a generalized opinion based on nothing then called me myopic, ironic.
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
Toxic as fuck, it checks out, this is indeed a private server player 
---
teach me how you aged 12 years in 14 years
---
I think its better to meet people while playing the game rather than meeting the people because you can't play the game  
---
Most people on reddit use that line as a joke, but no guarantee

[Ion Hazzikostas](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ion_Hazzikostas) is WoW's game director. He said "/u/Haptiix is wrong and smells of poop."
---
He also may have mentioned at some point around last Blizzcon that tokens wouldn't be coming to classic.
---
Doing WSG with too many rogues usually means a loss from my experience.
---
I actually can't find what i was responding to.  lol.
---
Probably some variant of people didn't know what BiS was back in the day - which makes me scratch my head because we did.   However, for pre-MC 1.12?  No way we knew.  Gear was buffed so much so much since 1.3.
---
Just not having blade flurry alone makes you lose against combat dagger on any fight with cleave. Adrenaline rush also favors all the short fights in mc/bwl. 
---
Its also imo harder to play since the amount of combo points you get is unpredictable and you are using 2 finishers instead of just one. More planing and decisions. 
---
Combat dagger is just so much reliable imo.
---
No I meant literally the opposite lol
---
Ive never raided in vanilla or that much at all for that matter, what do you mean they kite? Like do they take aggro or something? I know kite means to run away lmao
---
You mean the Ele that gets one shot in a global against a fury warrior, or the ele shaman that's stun locked and gets deleted from the game by literally any rogue? Boy was killing shamans fun and easy 
---
Bringing an Infernal crashing down from the heavens onto the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind. Honestly just burning the Alliance cities to the ground and setting up shop in the Mage Tower/Mystic Ward and murdering alliance teleportees. I've orchestrated many hour long sieges on the Mage Tower and I plan on trying out my Mystic Ward tests.
---
I mean, if you wanted to sit in the instance for half an hour waiting. I think we did it once in MC, and I believe if you left the instance they basically told you tough luck
---
I played for over a year before I hit max in TBC (started Apr 2007) - Finally hit max on a Rogue. But tanked at the end of TBC on a warrior and played pally first at max in WOTLK.
---
I still have a heart for heals and tanks, but I really really love Hunters and I keep going back to it over the last few expacs.
---
Will be playing Troll or Nelf hunter depending on faction.
---
Raptor mounts are my favorite in the whole game.
---
More like I take anything he says with a grain of salt given the current state of Blizzard and the direction they seem to be heading in.
---
I mostly did it to higher level mages while leveling in wpl. Being level 58 added extra insult to it
---
Ele Shaman is a T1 PvP class/spec, Ret Paladin is a bum PvP class/spec. 🤔🤔🤔
---
Have fun getting downvoted by the circlejerk
---
Just because you've never pushed past 2k rating, doesn't mean arena's are bad. As far as additions to the game, arena's have made more sense than literally anything. But hey, not everyone can get brutal gladiator and that's ok. 
---
While flying worked in tbc, blizz couldn't/wouldn't shut the gate on it for future expacs, and it got easier each time. But I personally hate wpvp so it worked great for me
---
Not a typical WPvP story, but cool nonetheless and something I'll always remember. I was leveling a Paladin solo through STV and died a couple of times to a 60 Undead Rogue outside Gurubashi Arena. I /cried and /hugged him and I guess he took pity on me. I ran into him many many times as I was questing and instead of killing me he'd use whatever it was that would shower me with rose petals. He even convinced other Horde not to attack me. 
---
I ran into him again in Tanaris a few levels later and he kept emoting for me to follow him. He ended up leading me into what would be Caverns of Time. 
---
Each time we saw each other out in the world from the on he'd throw down rose petals and emote me and move on. Ended up tracking him down in Ventrillo some time in BC, but we lost touch after that. 
---
Eh, if I have to choose between late-vanilla pvp (basically 2-shotting) and late-tbc pvp (resilience everywhere), I'd personally go with resilience. 
---
It's rhetoric for the purpose of highlighting how the modern automated speech and behavior policing of Activision Blizzard is incompatible with a large, social, and at times hardcore world like Vanilla WoW where there is rivalries, competition, and oftentimes massive frustrations which are a part of the game!
---
5 of us being corpse camped by about twice that many of our biggest rival guild at the time. They were all dancing really close together. So we rezzed and 4 of us sapper charged. Managed to kill all of them, and we quickly gtfo of there to prevent retaliation.
---
This was during the pre bg honor system days. It was standard to corpse camp anyone high ranking for an extra 2 kills (it was rumored that you got no honor after that, but I think we were wrong). So I had been camped by members of that guild so many times, and vise versa. To come back and win with half their numbers while being camped was amazing, though. We rarely beat them with even numbers and full health
---
I imagine they won’t make too many servers to start with.
---
Most will be roughly 51/49.
---
Eventually the imbalanced servers will get free faction-specific transfers to other servers to equal it out.
---
I never saw any major imbalance in vanilla and i played on 3 servers (and one was full of russians). I know it was an issue on some servers i’m just saying don’t worry about it.
---
Present!
---
My level 30 whirlwind axe was ready
---
If I had to choose between shamans and pally's for Naxx, I'd take the pally 100% of the time. 
---
didn't a Blizz community mod say we haven't received any new updates because there isn't anything to update us about.
---
Nost got a lot of tickets and 25% is a huge amount of players. 
---
That’s a test case scenario. The data doesn’t lie, but I see a lot of fifteen year old annecdotal memories of how people think they remember it was. 
---
I hate the idea of loot sharing but I use to 100% do this.  Me and my cousin were both pallies so we would ticket a gm if one of us had a change in heart on who wanted to heal that week 
---
Did you kill them with fucking Rez sickness? They’re tankier than any class but paladins and maybe druids lmao. Get your lying ass out of here 
---
&gt;  res runs are made by people who bring more than just 1/5th of the group.
---
No... they don't.  They are bringing 1/5th of the group.
---
It's the sense of entitlement that the person who is doing the res run has that is off-putting and it's bleeding through in your justification for them.  You're trying to rationalize why the person reserving an item deserves to reserve it.
---
&gt; Sometimes they're the tank
---
Tanks are more deserving?
---
&gt; Sometimes they're overgeared for the content
---
Having more gear makes you more deserving?
---
&gt; Sometimes it's a 4/5 or 3/5 guild run just needing one more person
---
Guild groups are more deserving?
---
&gt;  If the group was advertised as "Runeblade res",
---
"Res" groups didn't even exist back then, and we didn't even know the Runeblade existed.  It was a different time.  If I could do it over again I would have voted to let them roll for it.  I was, well, 15 years younger at the time.
---
The only thing that is ignorant is assuming that Blizzard is going to monetize classic like they have done with retail, it's one thing to be skeptical, but to making an assumption into a foray that Blizzard has never attempted before is just as ignorant as blindly believing nothing can go wrong. 
---
More like you have server lag in Isle of Conquests and the start with 80 people on screen and huge spell delay. People aren't "morons" for noticing the current tech is broken and not meant for a MASSIVE multiplayer online game. It's meant for things like Overwatch. 
---
80 people in the world is even worse with the virtualization. 
---
**Imo only a "moron" would claim Classic will somehow magically work better than the modern game on the same client and network infrastructure.** 
---
The  OP is on an official server. Try to put over 300 hunters on the same server on retail WoW and see what happens. Spoiler. You won't hit 100. 
---
The only class fury cant global are pally's probably a pserver baby 
---
Agreed. I hate that Blizzard just kept making things easier and simpler for the sake of "balance". In the end true 100% balance is impossible so stop chasing it. Making a class dependant on the faction was a great idea and kept the game interesting. If you wanted to roll a shaman well sorry buddy it's horde or nothing. Faction mattered back then, not so much now. 
---
Unless you have flasks, DM tribute buffs, Darkmoon Fair buffs, ZG buff, Onyxia buff, Songflower and Nanoboost + Mercy pocket you're not going to one shot an ele shaman, SL lock or warrior. You absolute fucking walnut. 
---
Hahaha no you’re right I haven’t listened to a single thing this person has ever said and I never will. 
---
I can accept this post. Its a big improvement from your initial attitude. I also dont disagree with anything youve said here. Private servers arent perfect which is why almost everyone I know on private, is itching to play Classic. Hell, we wouldnt have Classic if it werent for the private guys. Private servers arent 100% accurate. But they are close enough that they are relevant. 
---
I actually have a couple of videos saved for pserver babies like yourself, I'll link them when I get off work and you can go back to petitioning for nost 2
---
I’m fully on the July 16 tin hat train
---
Whats wrong with a website that provides a free service but supported with ads?
---
Nothing wrecks mage, mage top pvp class in classic. Prove me wrong.
---
Phasing and sharding will help. It's not like guilds on private check out both factions and roll accordingly. /s
---
Want to know Blizzard's "fix"? Cross realm BG's, which is no real fix, but it gets their influencers easy content since they are on a PVE server with raid content that has been nerfed 5 times over by Ion and all their stalkers will pile on one faction.
---
So two changes that will destroy the community. Welcome to Classic!
---
Purely subjective opinion 
---
50/50 across the whole community is not the same as per server unfortunately. There might be global population balance, while many servers are 90/10 or 70/30 one way or the other.
---
Oh fuck off don't even act like it was impossible to name change, you just couldn't pay for it like you can now.

i wish things were still awe inspiring and terrifying like these dragons and their mystical portal areas were ;-;

How was TBC the beginning of the end? It was way better than classic and that's coming from someone who played Vanilla wow. TBC was the PEAK of wow TBH.

Yeah stance dancing was a thing, but tremor totems?

Thanks for playing though.
---
If they’re confused about that, then they’ll probably be be recommended a sharded server.
---
All you need to know about these content creators from Blizzard's own mouth. Stop letting these people speak for you and realize you have a voice. They don't care about you and last time I checked you are human beings and not lemmings following unethical people.

---
Blizzard doesn't exist anymore. I wouldn't put anything passed Activision though. Fuck those fuckers.
---
To mix speculation with facts is dishonest. 
---
Yeah there is. There's nothing wrong with this.
---
Playing what? You said it wouldn't hit 100, I showed you a video of more than that.
---
My point was the first sentence, and it's generally true and sound logic.
---
Um ok? Any proof to backup that tinfoil list? The article does not mention DM and raiding MC in 20 people...
---
Have you played vanilla? It ain’t happening mate. And if it does via nerf it will be a giant fail and everyone will go back to the pservers.
---
As long as we have the pservers they have to play ball.
---
There are some fights where hunters can kite mobs away as a form of cc. For example, Majordomo can be constantly kited by one or two hunters while raids kill the other mobs in that fight, making the whole thing way easier.
---
After leveling a warrior and a hunter to mid 40s on LH the number of bad hunters is unreal. All of them would have been much better off rolling mage.
---
Really made me decide to be that one solid hunter in the mess. I’m sure there are good ones, but a lot of them were just so bad.
---
The only speculation there is based on their modern game being completely broken in large scale wpvp on the same client and server infrastructure Classic will have.
---
**You are speculating that Classic will magically work better than the current game they are trying to sell. Based on nothing.**
---
Yep, that is the case.
---
Pro-tip: get in a decent guild. Most people will loan you the money to get everything you want. Though remember to pay back!!!
---
I remember kiting one of the emerald dragons into Orgrimmar. Horde skeletons blanketed the ground like snow.
---
I did the Skettis grind twice for the netherray. It took around 6 hours with a 70 mage and 3 hours with an 80 rogue. Considering it's all contained within the one area, I didn't mind it. 
---
Yeah I played real Vanilla unlike a lot of these content creators who pretend fury warriors were viable DPS and leading dmg before AQ. 1.12? Means you need less than 40. Multiple itemization nerfs on top of DM at launch, spell batching (which I didn't even add to the list) which makes heals land instantly which will led good healers conserve more mana/save a wipe and 16 debuffs is going to make these raids complete faceroll. People will do it with less than 20. 20 is a conservative number.
---
Nah I just probed the patch server directly. wow\_beta still exists as a program code so this'll be an issue with the bot.
---
The catalogs program code gets updated all the time.
---
[here's the reddit thread... and yes, it's just as amazing as you've described.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a49628/figured_yall_might_want_a_good_reason_to_roll/)
---
Rogue beats Mae 1v1 if specced right with equal gear
---
Warriors are hands down unstoppable when aq hits.
---
That’s why I love vanilla balance. You suffer early on as warr but if you stick it out, when aq rolls around, you feel like a god amongst mere mortals.
---
Before then you still killing it if you get lucky with drops
---
100 people standing around doing nothing? I showed you a video of 80 crashing a server with the same streamer engaging in PVP. I showed you another with him showing that servers used to be able to handle it. I also included multiple tweets where he says the game isn't even a real MMO anymore due to what a joke the servers are.
---
Like I said nice try.
---
That was weeks ago. 
---
Come on Activision astroturfers. Downvote this faster and throw out some more tinfoil hat comments. Reporting people to the Federal Trade Commission is fun. Why should Blizzard shareholders get all the fun of suing this unethical company. The FTC should get some fine money to.
---
This company is a joke. 
---
I see where we disagree, then. I understand your opinion, and I can respect it, even if I do not share it. 
---
Although I really don't think 
---
&gt;When 5 people enter a dungeon they enter as equal. If someone with BIS gear chooses to invite green machines and carry them that doesn't entitle them to take whatever they want. If Mr. BIS feels that way, then let him solo the dungeon.
---
is true. It's not really about entitlement in my opinion. Expecting people to join would be entitled, or expected other people to let you have the item even though it was never said that it was reserved is entitled. 
---
Some players do bring more than 1/5th of the group. A tank brings a shorter wait time, which means you spend less time in IF/Orgrimmar. Someone with a significantly higher dps is very easily considered more than 1/5th of the group - dps contribution to a group being almost exclusively linked to the damage they deal. Running a dungeon with 800 total dps and running a dungeon with 1500 total dps is night and day, for example. More dps makes everything easier. 
---
When you bring high dps or a tank, you save other people's time, and time is valuable. I see it as a trade of sorts. I give you an easy run, you let me have this item. I spare you the headache of looking for a tank, you let me have the item. It's up to every individual to decide whether the trade is worth it or not. 
---
I certainly do not believe that every member of a party is an equal. Although merit is kind of irrelevant. I personally don't care whether someone "deserves" an item more than another. It's not really something you can measure anyway. But time saved, headache avoided, those are tangible factors that help the person who does not get to roll on the item. If I was a fresh 60 warrior and someone was building an Ironfoe res run, I would join in a heartbeat, knowing that I would basically get carried and have free reign on all the less rare loot. 
---
Again, that's assuming the person is not an complete idiot who spams "LF4M tank heal dps emp run IF res" on /2 while being in greens himself. 
---
P.S.: I'd rather deal with someone I know is entitled than someone who goes behind people's back and engineer groups for his personal benefit instead of the good of the group. At least the first guy is upfront about what he wants, and isn't afraid to tell everyone. Honesty over secrecy every day of the week. 
---
My first character was Night elf rouge named Tochio back in vanilla. I remember making him because my Aunt and Cousins at the time had gotten me into game, switching over from a Ragnarok private sever (Light side/LegendRO). Out of all the classes and abilities they talked about and explained to me, the rogue really stood out since in Ragnarok I was already having fun with the assassin class. So I pretty much jumped right in, leveled him to like 10 decided to make a hunter and never looked back.
---
In classic, I'm going to be playing an Orc Shaman. Not really sure what spec yet. I played a Shaman through out Vanilla, TBC and WotLK. I'm looking forward to playing my shaman back when I had fun on him.
---
ok
---
Dude... saaaaaammmeeee
---
Claiming that interns could implement the progressive itemization in a few hours is just poor speculation. If Blizz doesn't have data prior to ~1.4 how
---
can they accurately do this anyway for those previous patches?
---
Sooo 2-3 months of early DM farming will ruin the economy... by your evaluation, the economy will be ruined because of DM REGARDLESS. When it comes out is irrelevant. You also speculate that this won't be nerfed, which is actually expected by a lot of people. What % of the population is going to hit max level and start utilizing this content in those early months? A tiny minority most likely, and how many of them will be the classes that are able to farm, if it's even possible in Classic? An even smaller margin of players.
---
20 man MC in early raid tiers for gearing? Who can do this at that gear level, even in 1.12? The 0.001% if anyone.
---
You are SO high on your own farts.
---
I don't watch a lot of "influencers" (lol) but those I have checked out are pretty outspoken about your criticisms that are actually valid.
---
except that's a generalized opinion not some great truth, all classes are wanted in raids and besides that you're correlating class talent balance with leveling difficulty, I didn't even bring up talents, I brought up a benign idea that wouldn't affect anything besides low-medium level questing/dungeoning maybe you tried reading.  I've already dropped the issue because someone had a concise point and broke down why that wouldn't work out, but holy shit all the immediate "no changes, because reasons" responses is obnoxious.
---
I wana twink now...
---
Quite the monologue.
---
Lol I remember getting hand of rag. Big moment.
---
Kiting and running are different. When kiting one has superior range and uses it to pick away at a foe that can't attack back.
---
You didn't even correctly guess what I claimed you were speculating about, and now you're projecting. Stop and think for a second.
---
I never mentioned talents either...
---
The context is important. I judge hardness by if the mechanic is easily felt with or not.
---
If you take a modern 40 man raid from retail and stick them into vanilla naxx, it would be a faceroll. Because every class have an interrupt, a cc, a heal, and a movement ability.  
---
Now if you look at naxx with the current context of vanilla classes and abilities, it is really hard. It’s hard to get 40 geared players for the raid, and even harder to do some bosses.
---
I know players that get upset when people die on things that are supposed to be “easy” but they fail to realize that only a couple of classes can dispell and we don’t have more than 3-5 in a raid right now.
---
Distracting dagger from dm is also an amazing piece for dagger rogues, offhand slot
---
lol
---
And her hole.
---
All online games have a server tick rate, that's not unique to spell batching. Vanilla's tick rate of 2.5hz is very low by modern standards.
---
For the second one, he's not referring to visual effects, but game effects. The server load per player is much higher in retail, which combined with a higher tick rate makes overloading the servers much easier. 
---
Don't worry man I support you and I agree with this list.
---
chunga chunga, chunga chunga
---
Best fox confrim
---
Yes, hunters will always be needed. Just play it if you like the class. Even the top-tier guilds bring at least 1-2 hunters for Naxx, and more casual guilds will bring like 4+
---
i played vanilla back in the day and even once and a while on private servers now. I honestly wouldn't mind sharding for the first bit of release. 
---
There is a special kind of amusement in that. Yeah you're getting camped, but you succeeded in making them very salty.
---
Lol have fun with your attitude..
---
Stop posting lies 
---
Ah shit. You had me going for a while. This one was a bit too blatant though. In the future, stay a bit more subtle. Obvious trolling is bad trolling.
---
Goodness that seems like way too much work.
---
So what is it that makes a solid, not bad, hunter?
---
Freezing trap on the booty bay pier right before the ship. /wave ar a frozen enemy as the ship leaves and they miss it.
---
Duuude. Just like losing weight and workmode.
---
I don't want to play TBC. 
---
I'd only be for it if they created new TBC servers. Maybe allowing free transfer from vanilla servers. 
---
If Blizzard announced plans to roll vanilla servers forward to TBC, there's a high chance I'd quit then and there.
---
You idiot, city raids, dragon raids, whatever. Classic will have them despite you claiming it wont. But because morons like you ca be anonymous online you fucktards will disappear once classic goes live and the raids are actually happening despite you claiming the architecture wont be able to handle it.
---
And it will be without phasing. Your silly ass will just up and disappear. Fuck outta here clown. If you don't think Classic will work then fuck off to some private server and stop trolling this subreddit.
---
I named my twink Shammy this a few months ago. You can tell the older players
---
By who whispers to compliment it lol
---
Infernals in Goldshire.
---
That's just the DX9 working as intended.
---
&gt; I'm fairly confident that we will see servers surviving such an overload. What does worry me is that GMs actually stepped in and intervened in the raid as it was happening by teleporting players outside during said incident
---
Thats fine, again, these unfounded fears of GMs stopping world boss raids is exactly the type of stuff thats not going to go away until people are actually raiding the cities and the dragons and doing so successfully. Some of these worries just stick around annoyingly until literally proven wrong in real time.
---
6 months to go.
---
Befriend a Warlock of Imps Flame Shield and Druid for Thorns.
---
You aren't a "fire mage" in vanilla, you're just a mage. Sorry you ~~have to~~ should use your whole kit. 
---
Somehow I doubt this guy has an issue with casting sheep, blink or CS in retail, if he knows what any of those even are. 
---
I sincerely hope they launch BC and Wrath servers. But I'd be ok with classic for a wile until they are able to make BC/Wrath servers.
---
Looks like baby doesn't understand that people have other opinions yet :c
---
Going to make my character on every server and attempt to snatch some names on PvP servers.
---
&gt;Playing what? You said it wouldn't hit 100, I showed you a video of more than that.
---
You are arguing with an idiot and a troll. Yes you proved his statement 100% false but he was never arguing in good faith. He simply moves the goalposts when you prove him wrong. Don't bother.
---
You sure this isn't the BFA beta because that thing remained around for ages, it was still on my launcher whenever I quit BFA at the time. Plus the classic thing from Blizzcon was a demo, not a beta, which makes it even less likely to be connected to Classic. 
---
My main was a NE Warrior. The logic behind my choice of warrior back then was "all the other classes look too complicated." Pretty sure my choice was also subtly influenced from playing a lot of Barbarian in Diablo 2. Wouldn't mind playing warrior again, but I'd like a class that is more self sufficient in PvP and to just try something different.
---
I won’t tell you my secrets 
---
Ah I think I do remember you! Are you still playing retail!? 
---
I'm planning on starting again for classic I haven't played since wrath. 
---
I think they toned it down a bit for BFA. I went there by mistake trying to get to classicdb and was pleasantly surprised to see the page wasn't killing my cpu. Still won’t trust them if they put a classic version of their website though. 
---
I don’t think they would ever do seperate servers for classic and TBC/Wrath. That would just split the player base too much with retail/classic/tbc....it would be too mixed.
---
If they did go forward with expansions (I would like them, after 2ish years) then they would just convert classic.
---
But I think it would be more likely to keep classic and finish the 4-6 “hidden” zones, adding them as content patches and not expansions. Which would be super interesting.
---
Not sure if they would actually devote manpower to doing that though because they have to update retail as well.
---
Just my thoughts...
---
If I remember correctly. If you out level some places the ! isn't over some quest givers heads
---
Fuck I miss doing world bosses. It was so much fun especially if horse showed up and it turned into an all out war. Damn it I might start playing classic again 
---
... And we would go right back to private servers. The whole reason they rereleased classic in the first place. 
---
No. There was no way to shut off experience in vanilla. 
---
The fuck are you on about? You said:
---
&gt; Try to put over 300 hunters on the same zone on retail WoW and see what happens. Spoiler. You won't hit 100. 
---
so I linked a video showing you more than 100 little shits running around in the same zone. You didn't give any further criteria to your challenge, you said you won't hit 100 hunters in the same zone on retail, that's all you said and you're wrong.
---
Viable and optimal are not the same thing. Optimal has a potential answer that is objective. Viable, at its loosest definition, means you can finish the content. Since literally every boss in vanilla was killed in vanilla by raids that didn't even have 40 people in them, anything is technically viable.... so long as the rest of your raid is optimal enough. That is the issue. The rest of the raid is carrying you and people in better guilds realize you are dead weight. They could literally do the raid without you. Now some people are nice enough to carry you, but since a 40 person raid has ~660 slots to gear and they get ~27-35 pieces per raid, not all of which are always even usable due to RNG, it is actually straight up better to have an empty slot if the content is completeable without the meme spec, you'll gear up faster and move up to the next raid tier. Plus, from an admin side, dealing with people who are ready to go when you have more than 40 people is actually a headache. It is easier to have exactly 40, or less, raiders and if someone is sick, on vacation, etc., just raid without them. 
---
Basically the best argument you can make for "viable" but not optimal specs is it is fine to bring them so long as you literally never give them gear, they never make a mistake that costs the raid time, and they never take the spot of someone better. 
---
Just for Blizzcon my dude.
---
Legit jump scares from King Mosh. How was such a giant dinosaur so sneaky??
---
I agree that classes will do fine in raids, and you can get invites to raids as a boomkin or a ret. Thing is, you're not going to hit 60 and go straight into raiding unless you already have a raiding guild that you're in with people who will take you.  Most people will be looking to get into 5 mans to get gear to get accepted into a raiding guild. It will likely be harder to get into 5 mans as a boomkin for like Scholo, Strat, DM, LBRS. If you get stuck at that stage, it can be painful. Is it impossible? Nah. It'll happen, but it will be way easier for a holy priest to get into an end game 5 man than it will be for meme specs.
---
One of the more satisfying things in Classic, was levelling in Loch Modan, and seeing the entrance to Stonewrought Pass. It felt sooooo cool once I got to a high enough level to do the quest to get through the gate. 
---
Your posts remind me of this dumbass I used to own named Falathrin.
---
He goes batshit crazy all over the r/classicwow subreddit, none of his statements backed by legitimate evidence, but by speculation fueled by a game that isn't even played the same way. He's a private server baby that hasn't realized that not a single pserver that has been released for classic is legitimately blizzlike.

One time in BC, I had guildies summon my level 49 warrior twink to a big hala fight in Nagrand. I managed to hamstring a priest, but didn't do too well otherwise.
---
Naxx was so serious that people farmed the Root Tubers in some zone that I cant remember because it healed for a little bit but was it's own cool down. Full bandages, pots, flasks, oil, best enchants you could get. Back then you needed resistance gear and people farmed that too.
---
You did what you had to do outside of raid time so when it came to raid you could progress. Ya it was pretty much a full time job but it was something I enjoyed.
---
&gt; This is happening because there isn't any news. There has been complete silence from ActiBlizz since Blizzcon.
---
News only silences these dudes for a few hours. If you go back, you can find a person claiming there might be tokens like 2 hours after Ion said there wouldnt be tokens in classic.
---
The thing is, the trolls justify it by saying "Nothing they say can be trusted though". So with that, not even news helps. Only the release will. And I would imagine at release these same people will make up imaginary upcoming patch notes that add LFR etc etc and claim it will happen "eventually" because "Blizz cant be trusted". Same shit, different package.
---
Yeah that might be it. I looked up the split and it was about 56% horde to 44% Alliance when I played. It probably just felt overbearing cause the horde queues for battlegrounds would be like 30 minutes so they would go and gank lowbies to farm honor kills. Where if you wanted to pvp as alliance  the queues were nearly instant for battlegrounds so they would rarely Wpvp. It just felt like there was a massive amount of horde in the world haha.
---
&gt;There is no class balance in classic
---
Yea, I hated mana burn too.
---
&gt; I just don’t understand people’s fear that their groups will be full of groups of friends that will box them out of loot. Is that common in current wow?
---
Its not common now with personal loot, and it certainly wasn't common back then. If you read, it seems a LOT of people didnt even KNOW you could xfer items via GM... So a lot of them likely assumed it never happened to them. Finding out that it was happening all these years later is a shock to people. Maybe they prefer being able to tell themselves it didnt happen, versus the very transparent nature of loot sharing.
---
Too bad classic is running in the new client so your netbook won’t even pass the installation test.
---
Sorry broski
---
You can just be a naked warrior and taunt pets, forcing them to attack you. You might die but it makes the warlock/hunter die regardless of having pet on passive or not. You can also hit shamans/troll priests that have their lightning shields on for the same results.
---
Certain raids being more fun than others is the perfect example of something that is NOT objective. That is the equivalent of saying chocolate is objectively better tasting than vanilla. 
---
Where did you find this OP?
---
[Original Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/SpiritualWarning/comments/ajxr84/stormwind_university/)
---
I don't understand this topic coming up constantly. They are committed to Classic. It is happening. Probably in a year or so after Classic release if the numbers for Classic are good, they will internally start to plan TBC, which may well involve #Changes depending on the community desire, we may well see an OSRS system for instance to deal with some of the things people didn't like about TBC. That is when they will start to talk about it. If you want it to happen, subscribe to Classic. They are a business. They'll do it if they see the money in it.
---
So, at a minimum, expecting any comment publicly from Blizzard on the matter is *two years* to early. So if that is what it is going to take, check back in two years.
---
When bosses actually had a sense of wonder to them 
---
I kinda want a weird amalgamation of all three put together
---
Gotta use the ublock log to see what addresses are connecting and add them to the white list :)
---
As someone that played through all of TBC when it was current content, I’d have to agree with the “world” comment. 
---
By the end of 2007 literally every zone in Outland, minus maybe Nagrand, just felt annoying. The color pallets weren’t a good choice for long term play. The game really doesn’t sell itself as a “sci-fi” game, yet at last half of the zones belong in that genre more than fantasy. 
---
I was pretty happy when WotLK came around. (Until I got sick of snow. But that’s another rant.)
---
One time I camped I guy so long and so hard that he contact my guild leader on ventrilo and offered him 500g through neutral ah to kick me out of the guild.
---
He took the money, kicked me out of the guild. I ganked him again without a guild tag. Then my guild leader reinvited me and I ganked him again after that. He came back into vent having a legit meltdown. At that point my guild leader designated him kos target for our guild of 200 people and declared him an enemy of the human ethnostate.
---
Wasn’t that a 5% bonus to *base* HP though?
---
E.g. a Tauren 70th level warrior theoretically has like 6k hp naked, but 15k in a mix of T4/t5 gear. 
---
The bonus gives him a total of 300 extra hp, not 750.
---
I feel like at those numbers almost any other racial is better. If 300 hp is the difference between life and death for a tank something else is going terribly wrong, since most boss abilities hit for far more than 300hp.
---
i remember in vanilla i had transmog, kept a set of mixed scarlet monastery gear and some red sword for a cool red ninja look. only costs half a bag slot :)
---
I legit wish I could understand what you’re trying to convey here. As written, and as a native English speaker, I honestly can’t parse it. 
---
&gt; There was nothing there that could give me any xp so no chance of lvling out of bracket.
---
Reading &gt; you
---
It was a fair fight, but rogue needed their CD to do anything. Mages could keeping pounding in BG without being insta killed the moment you were out of CD. 
---
One of the BiS BT prot weapons is a one handed axe. So yes. 
---
THink your replying to the wrong person
---
But if you bought retail you get classic so there is no competition
---
Everyone knew you could transfer items via gms. I had people begging me to do it with them in SM like 4 or 5 months after launch...
---
sorry i guess arenas are bad because blizzard decided to really balance around them which lead to classes becoming very similar and losing what made them stand out.
---
MC still was run when Naxx was out, mats gold some items in there were still good, with level cap of 70 all vanilla content was thrown out the window to make way for TBC
---
That's all this fucking fool does, every single one of his posts has been nothing but doom saying.
---
A lot of the “this counters this” is nullified by engineering/rare items. Vanilla’s mainly about who’s better/more prepared.
---
That's probably exactly who he is 
---
You are correct. Reading while driving probably bad idea. 
---
This is my hope for post naxx instead of rereleasing tbc.. how sick would an emerald dream exp be with a new level cap but the same game philosophy as classic. Ugh.. probably never going to happen because they won’t want to divide the lore but a boy can dream.
---
Indeed I am but I was stabbed 16 times as a child so I hope you can forgive me.  
---
Turn wow upside down and add in some head and you got yourself a thottbot.
---
dont suck next time
---
Grade A content. More.
---
The good ol' days. I didn't discover thottbot until TBC, although granted I didn't even make it to 60 in vanilla. Probably could have if I knew there were three talent trees and didn't try to level my Pally as holy lmao.
---
I guess?
---
By his own admission Kungen, the GM of the first guild to clear Naxx, took about a month off from progression to watch the World Cup. 
---
That doesn’t sound that hardcore to me. But ymmv. 
---
the og ankle biter
---
You can always play on a pr*vate server right now.
---
“She doesn’t even go here!”
---
unless you were swifty lol
---
Interns could. Nost already has all the old itemization which can be found on internet archives. I could do it myself with a group of homeless people in a week. Nost saved them that time.
---
Best thing I saw in Classic like this was 2 friends and myself (one being a warlock) all dished summons to ourselves, and then convinced a gullible warrior that we knew a short cut to BRD. 
---
This short cut obviously involved jumping over the ledge near lava, where we had summons waiting, this unfortunate warrior did not.  Felt pretty bad, but after a few laughs we summoned him out and tossed him some silver.  I dont think they patched not being able to do accept summons while falling until sometime during Wrath. Definitely did this more than once lmao
---
If you think people legitimately want broken raids and broken content? I have some scrap metal to sell you in the middle of Paris. This is one of the most blatantly astroturfed reddits I've ever seen. It makes the Star Wars reddit and all The Last Jedi fake fans seem legit. You actually think this company has any ethics left. They don't. It's why they are being sued by their own shareholders.
---
I play PvE so I can smoke and not worry about pvp. Healing dungeons and raids high is fantastic. 
---
&gt;Mythic is mechanically harder than Naxx but tuning is about the same. 
---
Really disagree with this one.
---
Patchwerk is amusingly a really easy 'Patchwerk fight' compared to modern ones, what was hard back in vanilla in terms of throughput is probably heroic level these days.
---
If you take a mythic guild into Naxx they might struggle a bit learning the fights/mechanics, but in terms of throughput they aren't going to have any problems whatsoever.
---
90% of the time when a rogue ganks me I'm sitting and drinking.  Which is, of course, a big part of mage game play.
---
"We want #NoChanges! Wait, not that kind of #NoChanges!"
---
The only people these 'changes' have any noticable effect on is the hardcore players and that is only to make faceroll content a little easier. Also Cross-realm BGs were in Vanilla.
---
Noticed you have a second job too. I have one also. And I'm also quitting when WoW releases lol. And I'm ALSO working to lose weight haha.  
---
Fun stuff.  
---
Odd, I use to murder them on sight with my rogue.
---
Modern game can't do it. Thinks it's gonna magically work in Classic where they have no microtransactions. Calls other people "morons".
---
Going pve with my gf cause she doesn't want to be ganked, I wonder how I will like it. Always been into PVP. also love healing
---
Unrelated rant but here we go... Min/maxing is sooo boring. If you wanna do that go ahead. But I’d rather play with the Rogue in full Shadowcraft gear telling hilarious and interesting stories over the Pre-Raid BiS dude who gives “underperforming “ players heat for slacking. Like come on, it’s MC you can 18 man Gehennas. I know cuz I’ve done it. As a Boomkin.
---
Play how you want, know that not every Guild is for you. Find a good set of people to play with and kiss the notion of maximizing everything bye-bye. Vanilla allows you to do that, which is great.
---
Edit: min/maxing blocks out variety of classes, specs and gear. A min/maxing Rogue will never wear Nightslayer over Pre-Raid BiS. A min/maxing Warrior will never use Plate and Two-Handers. It makes everything blend into this “Tank - Healer - DPS” mess since everyone’s using the exact same gear.
---
The economy and AH blows, though.
---
Keep selling that revisionist history when TBC was just around the corner when Cross realm RBG's were coming and it had to be dumbed down to a short BG because BG's no longer mattered with Arena coming and Arena needed fast queues. **Why don't you do me a favor and tell me how many days of Vanilla had no cross realm BG's vs had it.**
---
You might as well claim that welfare Rank 14 gear is "Vanilla". 
---
My guild had 4 hunters in a raid on a good day.  Which if I remember correctly was about how many we needed for a smooth Chromaggus fight.  Which was odd because had close to 30+ hunters in the guild.  I think a lot of them were just farming alts.
---
Feral Druids can do very good damage, but the risk of them not doing so is so great that you’d never bring them over a Rogue because that player is almost *guaranteed* to do great damage.
---
Same way that motherfucker in Hellfire Peninsula was. That thing even roared to announce its presence. 
---
I mean a Warlock can probably kill you inside the Death Coil depending on crits at a certain point as well.
---
Stuff gets a little weird once you're into AQ/Naxx gear.
---
Did you never hit the Windows key by accident? :o 
---
&gt; Still not getting how multiple warrior tanks is necessary but multiple priests/paladins is just a luxury. 
---
Where exactly did I say that?
---
In what context?
---
Polymorph is nuts in Vanilla, however Mages get straight up destroyed by Locks in a 1v1.
---
While there are a lot of people who say the Night Elf run was memorable - as someone who rolled human I have to say the reverse was more memorable for me. Go from basic fantasy forest to Ironforge through the snowy mountains and Loch Modahn then across the ocean and when you get to Ashenvale everything is so alien and purple with that haunting musical score. 
---
I've always wondered why Blizzard fucked hunters on ranged weapon drops.  For melee classes, there were tons of viable weapons but for hunters, the selection was so limited.
---
Yeah, that's fair. I'm kinda ambivalent on the PvP vs PvE server at the moment. I know a lot of people who will be rolling on PvP so I'm tempted to roll with them, but at the same time I think wPvP is pretty shit. 
---
There usually is some kind of uneasy truce at launch though, with everyone wanting to level and not trying to draw the anger of the opposite faction. Also I'm planning on no lifing anyway so I'd be ahead of the pack. 
---
I actually don't understand people who engage the opposite faction on sight. I did this for like 10 levels on a warrior from 30 to 40, it's just a massive advantage to be the engaging party in wPvP so by charging everything I saw I was basically guaranteeing a kill. 
---
But it got boring in like 10 levels. Maybe 50 or so kills. How do people consistently do this shit? 
---
Then again, there's people who play twinks and go to low level zones when they're 60 to gank. So I guess some people just enjoy unfair fights. Can't respect people who do this. 
---
Oh well... it was a neat idea I guess. 
---
I would like to meet the fury warrior globalling a shaman, particularly because that means no Windfury.
---
Is the shaman in full cloth with a 2h or something? Mail+shield is a lot of armor for physical classes to get through and while Shaman generally do fall over when focused, it takes a reasonable amount of time to kill them.
---
Warriors globalling mages, priests or rogues are far more common tbh and even then it'd be Arms that would generally do it, you really want Sword Spec.
---
yeah maybe a 90% is too much but a 30-70 isn't too terrible.
---
Not using a good comp and players is wasting time. If you are a good player do you want to spend hours wiping because of a handful of literal retards who can't follow a two button rotation? Or are you going to leave and go with a guild interested in getting it done quickly and correctly?
---
With DM and songflower and ony buffs, there is no reason not clear mc and BWL in an hour, with mediocre gear.
---
DM buffs + songflower + pots = mc in greens and a couple leveling blues. On classic retail, MC will be done the very first week it is available, by guilds which picked a proper guild comp composed of players who are familiar with the content.
---
Shamans are great, however alliance generally have the advantage in premades are paladins are simply better. 
---
It is so difficult to kill a paladin and it means alliance can play defensively whereas horde have to try to force quick kills or else they lose.
---
I used the root tubers from felwood in the MC, BWL, and in PvP.  Awesome little item.
---
&gt; Yeah, that's fair. I'm kinda ambivalent on the PvP vs PvE server at the moment. I know a lot of people who will be rolling on PvP so I'm tempted to roll with them, but at the same time I think wPvP is pretty shit. 
---
I love it.  Really ads an element of danger to the world.  Learning how to escape ganks is also a lot of fun.  I never resented being ganked, I always tried to get even.
---
&gt;Lot of tanks were using daggers until like AQ (where you got good fast 1h weapons to get threat).
---
Did you last play on a private server several years ago? Fast vs slow weapons isn't a big consideration as tanks don't have the rage to spam Heroic Strike. DPS/weapon ilvl is generally the thing to look at but once BWL hits everyone just wants a TF anyway.
---
&gt;But when the threat issues are resolved the more gear you get, the tastier that 5% bonus HP becomes.
---
Threat issues get worse with more gear lol, threat doesn't scale as well with gear as damage does.
---
Why not just limit foreground FPS in the options?
---
&gt;Old content always becomes irrelevant with game progression.
---
Not really true for vanilla because first of all, gear progression was slow as shit so there was almost always something someone needed from MC, second Thunderfury, everyone wanted to farm that weekly.
---
Onyxia had to be done every week because you wanted the world buff, and there was also this sweet 18 slot bag, you wanted throw away epics as well so you could disenchant them for the guild vault.
---
I don't really think in any stage in vanilla that any raid becomes obsolete, not even ZG because you constantly want those shoulder  enchants.
---
I guess you've mostly covered it but the 'worst' griefing is likely when you have a mage and a priest.
---
You can cycle Polymorph and Mind Control DR's to effectively kidnap a player indefinitely and run them wherever you want.
---
It’s moments like these that make world of Warcraft so special and such an amazing game to play 
---
Every tank always wants thunderfury regardless, which is a reason enough to run MC throughout the entire expansion, every week.
---
Yeah, but with more gear some classes gets more threat reduction as well, like it something you have to figure out as a guild/raid how much DPS you can pump in without fucking over the tanks. The better weapon they have and the more damage they can tank or block the more threat they get.
---
I dont have any evidence for Sanctity Aura actually. This is the way I seem to remember it working but this was just from what I asked people at the time. SoC damage was strange though. It was counted as melee attack damage, but pierced armor as though it were a spell. It was melee damage though and didnt benefit from spell damage. Things like Holy Protection Potions didnt work on it. Early on it did 100% weapon damage, but since it pierced armor it actually hit quite a lot harder than your regular melee hits. Then they changed it to 70% with an increased proc rate, which still made it hit harder than regular melee on Plate and Mail, but less against Leather and Cloth. So based on those facts I knew and what I had learned from other people back then, I believe it doesnt work with it, but i cant actually say 100%.
---
As for Spiritual Focus, theres fights like Vael and Visc where youll be completely useless and I dunno, being a hard carry on any fight makes me feel pretty bad. Theres also fights like Huhu where youll be severely gimped at the moment when youre going to be needed most. As for the AoE farming, being able to solo farm was like, half the question posed in the topic, so given the topic at hand, its pretty important as part of the hybrid spec.
---
Noooo no no no serving merging. It destroys the game and the community. The only big streamer that’s gonna mess server population up is ammondgold.
---
I'm really interested to see how that works out. For the record, I do agree with you that (particularly with Rank 14 weapons) there should be some sort of "item stat progression", but, where does that end? Should we do just rank 14 weapons (as far as progression goes) or should we open it up to other items and, if so, which ones? 
---
It's questions like that which make nervous (and not at all envious for the Classic Devs). 
---
I mostly prefer bg's for my pvp Because I like to choose how often I die. Nothing stops you from turning on wpvp on a pve server. You'll never get to attack first but somebody will usually engage. Yeah, I think I'm going to try shaman healing for the first time in classic. I do like the options that a priest has but I dream of chain heals.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ZYE0kme.gif
---
I raided lots in Vanilla through Naxx, and never on Pservers.
---
The way I've always interpreted Vanilla difficulty (which may be wrong...) is that the difficulty comes not in the complexity of mechanics, or the finesse of your gameplay but the the tolerances for error.
---
So as an example, a vanilla mechanic might be something like a boss doing raid wide AoE - not rocket science to handle, just heal through it. The difficulty lies in that the raidwide AoE is likely a relatively high amount of damage, that requires a relatively high amount of Mana to heal through.
---
Point being that if you are not a healer with a high amount of throughput, with mana effecient heals, and are well geared enough to have big heals and a big mana pool you are going to wipe the encounter despite it's simple mechanic.
---
If a meme spec doesn't have the HPS, or HPM to heal through that encounter no amount of skilled play will compensate for it.
---
In that way Vanilla mechanics feel less like you are graded "A through F" and more like Pass / Fail, and as such there are stricter limitations on what class / specs are actually viable.
---
That's my take on it anyway. 2c.
---
&gt;I find the community is far more trustworthy, agreeable, and fair than these forums would have you believe. 
---
I'm sorry but what community are you talking about? If it's the private server you play on then I question how that translates to Classic given the (imo reasonable) expectation of private server players being a minority of the total population.
---
If it's retail then I don't know how you can say that with a straight face given retail showed over and over what people do to get gear in group loot settings.
---
Yeah but then everyone who wants either Vanilla, BC or WotLK won't be able to play the game they want/remember, which was the whole point of Classic.
---
25/26/0 is probably the better technical build for both PvE raid and PvP, but I went with the spec in response to the other spec being discussed here.
---
Holy Reckoning is better for farming, raids and PvP, though its a different style PvP. This spec is meant to be a pocket healer that can capably defend itself when attacked, it is a healer first spec. Your basic strategy when attacked is to heal yourself, get a big Reck bomb, heal some more, etc.
---
20/0/31, Hybrid Ret, is really the most true hybrid spec for PvP. You will be using a 2h and you will try to pick fights. You will be healing yourself when needed, but perhaps only once a battle (in a 1v1). In groups you will be either healing, attacking or both. This spec is more if you dont just want to be a pocket healer all the time.
---
&gt;The better weapon they have and the more damage they can tank or block the more threat they get.
---
Uh... Kinda?
---
The more damage they mitigate/block the less rage they get. 
---
The tanking meta these days is a little more TPS focused which skews things as you mostly have Fury Warriors running around with Defiance in high end guilds. However for standard 'tanks', DPS scale a lot harder than your TPS output does, getting a set bonus doesn't really change much with that.
---
The AQ trinket is ok but it's kind of the only option to decrease threat generated.
---
The fuck are tokens?
---
Dreggo, a Tauren Shaman. Named him after a versatile hero from Fantasy General, which fit since Shamans are versatile as well. Played him from vanilla to Wrath in 2010, at which point I stopped.
---
Trying to get some vet school classmates to play Classic as well, though I'll probably play a lot more than they will. So... will likely roll an Orc Warlock to play solo since leveling is quick with them and I barely touched the class before, and an Orc Warrior (that my lock can feed items to) to play with my friends.
---
In BC, you couldn't summon off cliffs anymore but our warlock trolled people without flying mounts by summoning them to the floating islands in Nagrand. 
---
I'm not saying get rid of classic, just that down the line some years from now I would like to see something taking the strengths of all 3 expacs and rolling it into one.
---
I really hope exp off is in classic.
---
It really wouldn't hurt anything. Twinks will be around with or without it. And battlegrounds don't give exp in classic to begin with so its not like it changes anything there. It just will allow twinks to do dungeons 
---
Yeah, but thats also why threat reduction classes are kings of vanilla, especally rogues with feint and vanish, hunters have feign death, and mages have like 30% standard threat reduction + tranq totem/ blessing of salvation.
---
I never played tank, but I know the raid have to manage their threat according to their tank, so they can't just faceroll their keyboard throughout the entire fight like in retail.
---
That is objectively not how Lights Hope Northdale is.
---
It’s about 70/30 allies over horde.
---
Are you seriously in the same position I am? I've always mained priest and debating going sham for chain heal and totem buffing. I love the orc cast animation and raid utility. However benediction and mind control call to me. It's so hard to not have levitate, mind control or pws again.   
---
  
---
Never played orc but I've also never played troll priest. I'm literally 50/50 and I think about it slot everyday at work
---
More like listened, but doesn't trust him for shit.
---
Considering the dude has, ever since become game director, been completely untrustworthy. He needs to prove what he says with action.
---
Nothing like running around for a quest and bumping into a "?? Boss" to get the heart pumping!
---
Is that like how they never were going to allow name changes, server transfers, PvE to PvP realms, (want me to continue)?
---
I think the (very valid) point being made is Blizzard has a habit of changing their minds when the money flow suits it. 
---
My first one was when I was in Duskwood getting my but kicked by everything. wasn't safe on the road due to the wargs and spiders, wasn't safe questing due to random elites patroling high spawn area's and create death traps. Just when I thought I was safe in Darkshire, everything would get wrecked by Stitches and it was AMAZING. Duskwood was the first time where I felt fully immersed in the game.  
---
honorable mention to the quest I couldn't remember where you dramatically walk through Stormwind and all the NPC's gossip about you or salute you, every single time someone else was doing that quest and walking with the NPC I would emote and get in behind them.
---
It is true though, and it's good to be skeptic.
---
Blizzard has brought this distrust from the players on themselves by saying one thing and then doing another. 
---
Sharding was supposed to only be used for very heavy loads when it first got released in wod, look at it now.
---
They keep saying they want our feedback, and then completely ignoring it.
---
They then promised class changes in 8.1 and then when it didnt happen they claim class changes only happens at the start of expansions.
---
The list of blizzard screwing players over and going back on their word is long. So, unless they literally sign a contract that legally prevents them from doing shit like adding tokens or increasing sharding. I will always be wary and skeptic of classics future.
---
In private servers, yes. I don’t remember that at all in real vanilla.
---
This idea won’t work anyway as the other commenter proved. 
---
Besides I just booted the game on the netbook. Lowest possible settings 20 FPS. 
---
Current wow it's not possible to do at all, since everything is personal loot. 
---
But before that and When loot trading was first added, it was definitely abused to he'll and back with pre-made raids.
---
People used to make pre-mades with friends, then roll for everything they wanted so they could give it to each other.
---
Or groups of friends would join a raid and so the same.
---
I encountered this every single week during ICC. Most notably for the trinket that saurfang dropped.
---
It is a very real fear for a system that can be very easily abused.
---
Frost, frost, frost.
---
The utility is absurd in world pvp and the survivability easily outpaces the other two.
---
Fire is viable and even preferred once you get some gear on you post 60 and post MC bust frost is the only thing worth doing 1-60.
---
Arcane is a joke. A whole talent tree and the only think used is the % hit on the first tier.
---
They said the same thing about sharding on retail when it first released in wod too.
---
"Sharding is only for when loads are too severe"
---
Yet now they use sharding so extensively that basically everyone has their own realm.
---
You should be very skeptical. If they keep their word. Then great! If they don't, then you aren't disappointed.
---
Sounds like your issue lies in poor choices of guilds and friends, not loot system.
---
&gt; That's all this fucking fool does, every single one of his posts has been nothing but doom saying.
---
Yep, I noticed it thats why Im going to start calling it out. Including a list of their trolling and reporting it in future threads. Make these doomsaying trolls change accounts every 2 weeks.
---
&gt;Well you don’t have fun then. I’ll be in my guild where we can do what we want. Because I don’t have to do what you want or think is meta.
---
Well fun is subjective, so I think we can both have fun. If one of your main interests is community and you can create a community that accepts your playstyle, I am certain that you will have fun! However, the wide body of players will trend towards certain expectations and you may have issues finding sympathy when running sub-optimal builds, specs, gear, strategy etc etc etc... BUT, if you find a group of dudes who are willing to tolerate you and you guys have fun together, I am happy for you AND if there is any place where that kind of magic (horror) can happen, it will be in Classic!
---
Probably the only class I had major trouble beating in duel, you wonder what blizzard was thinking when they decided to add a health regen on sheep, but leave chain seduce in-game. 
---
Don't listen to the other guy rambling about muh private server meta. It has nothing to do with private servers and everything to do with how rogues work at the most basic level.
---
The rogue's main strength is its CC. You can't apply that in teamfights because rogues get blown up the second they come out of stealth in those. Warriors have plate armor, defensive stance and usually a lot more HP than rogues, and even they have issues being up front in teamfights. Rogues are just way too squishy.
---
They're usually stuck on "defending the FR" because of how they're useless in teamfights. Even classes like lock/hunter, which are usually the "hold the node" classes, aren't that bad in teamfights in comparison. Locks have decent dots and burst potential while hunters have constant pressure on dispellers with viper stings.
---
Now add to that racials. Orc racials means that orcs have a nearly 1/3 chance of resisting any stun you throw at them. This means opening on them is really risky because you'll lose the fight a lot more often. Dwarf racials means you're screwed out of blind if the dwarf you're fighting has a functioning brain.
---
Rogues obviously will do much better in pubs than in premades because teamfights aren't as organized and because communication is a lot worse, if it's even existing in those pubs. It doesn't change the fact that rogues are squishy as hell and will be popped if the other team sticks together to a certain degree though.
---
TL;DR rogues are glorified stunbots. OP in 1v1s but weak as hell in actual BGs.
---
I don't understand the obsession with making things "like vanilla" outside of the actual game.  
---
At this point I wonder if we actually want that, or if we're just trying to seem more nerdy and "next level authentic" than the next guy.  
---
Some people find killing lowbies over and over “fun” for some fucked up reason. I mean if you like one-shotting people, go kill critters. 
---
But ganking is part of the game, and i would attack people within 8 lvl range of me, and leave the rest alone. Unless there is a specific issue like to camp a ganker, or to sinply retaliate if I was attacked first. 
---
It’s just like boxing, you fight people within gour own weight class. No fun watching heavy-weight beating on a feather-weight right? 
---
Is this reddit going to pick a server at launch?
---
But if Blizzards makes sure they are a month apart in content then they get mlre sub money 
---
Mine was somehow getting to Level 10 on a Human mage and realising that Elwynn Forest WASN'T the entire game. I took one look across the river and thought "Wow, that forest looks dark and spooky. I'mma check it out!" As soon as I step foot in Duskwood, a Level ?? wolf aggros from a million miles away and chews me up in three hits.
---
I had the same moment with the one in Azshara... I vividly remember a sense of danger and thinking, “I shouldn’t be here”. 
---
It was however beaten by the Fel Reaver in Hellfire Peninsula. I remember the immediate sense of death and thinking, “holy fuck I have to quest here?!”
---
Why do people censor the word private? It's not like a mod isn't suddenly going to know what you're talking about. Surely there aren't mod bots auto banning the phrase? 
---
It's mind-blowing how many people are desperate enough for Classic to share your opinion
---
I just don't know where they would go with the story. The two major things they've done with the Nightmare since then have been super fucking lame, I have such little faith in it to pan out well.
---
10k people participated. That’s a very reasonable sample size. 
---
The classic crowd want vanilla. The BC crowd don't mind flying. These are different things. 
---
Exactly.
---
Everyone thinks they are going to be pushing the envelope for world firsts.  In reality this takes 24/7 dedication for months and 99% of players won't be in that league.
---
Also, a rotation does not equal difficulty.  Once you've put a few weeks in, your rotation becomes as mindless as pressing 1111111111111111.
---
&gt; the other piece is the sort of raid leader culture. you say you can complete most of the 40-person raids w 25 competent people and that's probably true, but if you fill those last 15 slots w ret paladins or whatever, what does that say to those 25 people who showed up in a more raid-appropriate spec? it's a sort of social contract to all put in similar amounts of effort or attitude. while you can carry those 10-15 people, do you want to? 
---
I don't think this is a trivial issue. If I am putting in hours per week farming consumables or getting buffs or farming gold for respecs or whatever, and someone else isn't, my hours per week are subsidising their laziness. There has to be a certain amount of give and take, not everyone will always be on the same level of effort or commitment or skill, but it is entirely reasonable for the serious players to not want to subsidise someone else's choice to goof off and leech epics.
---
Plus, in the medium term, the most likely outcome is that once everyone figures out that the guild &lt;GoofOff&gt; lets PvPers and leechers hang out in raids and get epics, all the serious players in &lt;GoofOff&gt; will defect to a better guild while all the leeches in the server will queue up to be in &lt;GoofOff&gt;. So they won't end up with twenty-five players carrying fifteen numpties, they'll end up with forty numpties wiping in MC.
---
I don't want them to do expansions but just make new updates and raids
---
TBC made all druid specs viable which I will forever love. 
---
This guy is a known troll who somehow hasn't been banned. All he does is post nonsense day in and day out.
---
They are definitely only focused on getting classic out first and will seriously evaluate afterwards.
---
I do hope they do something cool like make a timer: After a minimum of one year and once the first 30 guilds have cleared Naxx, a 6 month timer starts until BC happens. My number 30 is arbitrary, I simply mean for it to be a number that will bring about the idea that it "Is challenging enough that exclusivity will breed desire"
---
I started on a PVE server as an Undead. After few days I finally made it to Hillsbrad, my first time in a contested territory.
---
Like everyone else, I ended up grinding Yetis for Helcular's Rod. Safe to say, it didn't take long till I ran into my first Alliance.
---
I tried starting a duel but they would have none of it. I flagged myself, no dice. I laughed, they laughed, we went our ways.
---
But the whole experience didn't sit right with me.
---
Next moment, I logged off and started again on a PVP server. Eventually I made it back to Hillsbrad again, and as soon as I saw my first Alliance, I attacked him with everything I got and got my first HK.
---
Hooked on PVP ever since. If it's red, it's dead.
---
I totally get where your skepticism is coming from, I really do. After all the shit they've pulled recently, it would be foolish to trust Blizz in any capacity.
---
But my opinion isn't based on what Blizz says. It just seems like the most sensible option to me. It's absolutely how I would launch a game that is guaranteed to start with a massive server load then level off at a tiny fraction of that. 
---
What are the other options? Provide adequate servers to handle the initial spike knowing they will soon be useless? That's kind of unreasonable to expect. Launch with servers designed for normalized population? The game will be unplayable for weeks or even months with huge connection queues and overrun starting areas. 
---
And I don't think they will have any need to use sharding once the population levels off. The reasons they use it now (high server load, phasing players for story quests) won't exist. The population will be very low and there will be no quests that require phasing. 
---
Why would anyone go to a website called influencer update?
---
What I don't get is why don't they just make it so that if you roll improperly, or someone ninjas, that's just the way it goes? 
---
You snooze you lose. Also if you ninja your reputation will get ruined so... Pretty much current vanilla.
---
About a year vs about half a year, not that huge of a difference tbh especially when you consider PvP wasn't balenced till 1.12. If revionist history is the name of the game then you are forgetting that cross sever BGs were requested by the community and the majority of people liked it. Also arena battles used to stalemate into very long matches too when people knew what they were doing.
---
The statistics I looked at was specific servers, the three biggest ones (and basically only ones). 
---
But there is nothing that guarantees it will only be used for launch.
---
They said sharding would only be used for when servers are overloaded when it was first implemented. But that ended up being a complete lie.
---
There is nothing stopping then from sharding again for the aq event, which was notorious for lagging the servers. And on top of that a lot of people that would come back just to experience it.
---
Sharding would definitely get implemented there if current blizz gets to decide.
---
All in all, I understand why they want to use sharding. But I do not agree with using it.
---
I would rather have more powerful servers (can be done) with some queues. As its possible to just remote home from your phone and login before you leave work to not have to wait when you do get home.
---
Sometimes i feel like people write these long response essays and then log over to a different account to respond in a positive manner to make there essay valid. 
---
Yeah, not having any starting zone shenigans is super fun haha I would love to give blizz open hands to use sharding ”when it makes sense” haha and yeah even though I will miss the weekly GM ticket to fix the mislooting that actually never happened haha I would too love to ruin the community for loot trading haha.
---
Imagine being this simple
---
Yeah it seems that way sometimes doesnt it. 
---
:P 
---
Jokes on them I don't read
---
You are 100% right, for some reason I had it in my head that there were no high tier one handed axes pre AQ40 but I was wrong. 
---
Edgy right out of the gate huh?
---
It wasn't a thing from the majority of the time you played. I believe it was late-wrath where it was introduced. I definitely noticed alot of abuse of it, and I remember it happening more and more as time went on. I would get whispers from people asking me to roll for them. 
---
One other point is that dungeon loot REALLY wasn't that valuable in Wrath/Cata and onward. Most people ran dungeons for their daily *awesome points*. In Vanilla, each dungeon takes *hours* from forming a group to finish, and the pieces are valuable. This will absolutely bring it out.
---
Personally, I'm fine with Loot-trading if it's just MasterLoot or Raid specific. It will be borderline catastrophic in dungeons though. It just puts an air of distrust and betrayal in what should be a carefree experience.
---
Aq is a good point. I could definitely see Blizz use sharding then to try and keep up with the extra load (which would be a fucking travesty). That's definitely a concern I agree with you on. 
---
But besides that I don't think it will be much of an issue. I think the population will just be way too low to require any sharding 99% of the time. 
---
Bro... If one boss out of a tier doesn't need two hunters but one, you still need two for every other boss.
---
But having Sulfuras is just a reason not to roll on Thunderfury, the real hunter weapon.
---
Ive been banned for 15 days on two separate occasions for simply using the Pserver name AND suggesting that it could be played but not directly encouraging players TO play there. This is a Classic forum and they do their best to keep it that way. Unfortunately that means we suffer from some friendly fire from time to time... About 90% of us here all play pservers because theyre SO damn close to what Vanilla retail was, but unfortunately that has to remain under wraps at the time being. My only regret is that I didnt start playing Pservers sooner... For those who had the opportunity to play Classic, lets call the experience about 75% Blizzlike and VERY short? Pservers are about 95+% Blizzlike and unless you were hardcore during vanilla retail, you wont notice any of the subtle nuances that are different. That being said, DO NOT PLAY ON A PSERVER!
---
Hi,
---
I need some help deciding between Warrior (DPS), Rogue and Mage.
---
I am interested in pvp, especially word pvp, but i also would like to experience every raid and possibly clear them.
---
----
---
**Regarding leveling:**
---
I will most likely start in a group with friends, but a lot of them are not committed as i am. Which means:
---
* They are not interested in min-maxing.
---
* Everybody will most likey choose the class they want. 
---
* I will have more time to play.
---
* They maybe even stop playing after a few weeks or months. 
---
So i probably should choose a class which can do fine solo, right? And i am also wondering what should i do with my time when they can't play but i can?! Should i already start a second character or just doing professions?
---
**Regarding lvl60 content:**
---
I am a competitive person, but i don't have much time these days, so i won't push for rank 14 or anything too hardcore. But i still would like to win most of my encounters and be a threat in group pvp. Do i need decent gear for that? Is this possible with only around 20-25hrs/week? 
---
It would be nice to have an answer to all these questions for each class i mentioned in the beginning.
---
Also if you think that another class would fit better for me please feel free to say it and why.
---
Thank you!
---
This is the worst kind of advocate for No changes... I mean, no changes was always a pretty ridiculous mantra, and those of us who are reasonable adults kind of smirked at the idea, but this sweaty idiot ruins the cause for those of you who are trying to voice your expectations of Classic.
---
I guess because there are many people, who also work shifts, that it wont be difficult to find a guild that suits your needs. Maybe try the forums, thats what i will do as i also work shifts. Good luck, mate.
---
In my mind the raiding is different. In retail you raid to kill the boss. In classic you raid to get the loot.
---
Retail = Harder encounters / Low time investment to gear character
---
Classic = Easier encounters / Long time investment to gear character
---
&gt; I wonder what Blizzard is going to do to help encourage a population spread? 
---
I wonder about this a lot too... The launch will be incredibly important. Once players are invested in their characters they wont want to reroll... So starting with the RIGHT amount of servers is key. We know there will be A LOT of casuals who will try the game and quit shortly after, so I am not sure how Blizz will contend with this... I could see them starting with 2 sister servers like tichondrius 1 / tichondrius 2 for the first 2-3 months and then merging those servers. Sort of works as an alternative to phasing but its certainly not Blizzlike. I think offering a preorder deal would do TWO important things, it could give them a strong idea of how many servers to start with AND it could lock players into specific realms. For example, preorder gives two character name reserves - you could even have an interactive booth on the site to allow players to completely create their ingame avatar before release AND to reserve their name so they are ready to go on day 1.
---
Honestly, I have no clue what theyre going to do, but they need to do something for themselves and for us because this could turn out to be a giant shit show otherwise. I am not suggesting any of my options above are likely, nor are they appropriate, I am just thinking out loud. Screeching NOCHANGES at the top of your lungs is not productive and it doesnt acknowledge the REAL game developing dilemmas that Blizz has to face.
---
Theres 2 big issues I see pro-Loot sharing commenters overlook. 
---
Firstly, the first argument I usually hear is that you can Ninja-Loot anyways. Not necessarily so, unless you have lead and swap to Master-looter, or Need when everyone else greeds (Which, grats, you should get it any way?). If you do ninja, it is plain to see. You can take a screencap and show the world what a dick Xxsephirothxx is, and that you shouldn't group with him. With Loot trading, any abuse of the system is secretive and under-the-table. This only makes the community skeptical and distrusting of itself, rather than banding together to flame the obvious bad guy.
---
Secondly, and this is important: Loot is VERY important in Classic WoW. I've witnessed some cases of abuse in the mid-life of WoW when personal was not a thing. Mostly friends and strangers whispering me to roll on an item, or other guildies being dicks together. 
---
It was annoying, but you could easily re-run the dungeon in 12 minutes on the spot, and have a 30% shot at getting the piece you want. Meanwhile, a nice weapon from fucking Deadmines will make you kill creatures twice as fast, make leveling easier when it's normally hard/tedious. Plus, it could take you multiple attempts to even see it drop. If you are grouping with a friend and have a double chance of getting an item, in retail you would save ~30 minutes. In Classic WoW, you would save yourself ~3 hours. There is just so much more reason Classic will make people abuse it's system.
---
I think a middle-ground is allowing it for Master-Loot or Raid-only groups, its easier to notice somebody wearing a piece they didn't win, or somebody not wearing something they won. Maybe this is Blizzs' plan, but we really can't be sure, and it's not unreasonable to speculate that they will include it for dungeons.
---
Can anyone who disagrees with me please voice their opinion on this? I just think it's a huge oversight in copy-pasting a modern feature to the old game without acknowledging the huge differences between the two games, and the wildly different impact if could have as a result.
---
And then by the time those players are advancing in endgame everyone will know not to group with them or invite them to their guild..
---
I plan on keeping a blacklist, and if everyone does, you'll have to pass 39 other players' blacklist in order to get into a raid, and a lot more to get into a half decent guild. All it takes is one player, especially if they have a screenshot or video to prove it, to get someone kicked from a raid or guild, and you know damn well I'm telling every guild master I can contact with said proof.
---
New game in the style of oldschool. 
---
Not at all like it was in 2007 however it is a fun game.
---
It works for runescape due to an almost never ending grind. 
---
To reach max level it takes around 2500 efficient hours and experience is still able to be gained past max.
---
That doesnt include gear, money etc.
---
Id prefer classic to be an almost museum piece. 
---
Runescapes death was due mostly to a crappily designed/implimented new combat system.
---
People have been leaving wow for a different reason. 
---
Mmmmm... Server merging will be a thing. Have you ever played on a dead server? You cant kill a community thats dead dummy. Ive been on live servers with less than 200 items on the auction house. I have played on servers with larger than a 80% deficit between horde and alliance faction balance... These servers are dead and they lose subscribers VERY quickly. It isnt good for the new players who have no opportunity and it isnt good for the developed players who are stranded without anyone to interact with.
---
I think the sheer lag in classic raiding (especially during peak hours when several guilds would be progressing at the same time) made several of the fights unplayable, or vastly more difficult than they had to be. Barely any loot to go around so progression would get stuck while you geared up your raid. Lots of people quit, then you had to regear people all over again...
---
And while attacks were simple, in my experience managing Mana was actually a thing and you might have to down rank spells and use consumables at carefully timed intervals to give yourself the best chance of lasting the fight with good uptime. I was in a pretty good guild for the time, could routinely full clear AQ40 for months, and Naxx up to Sapphiron before I quit. 
---
Make that cheddar. Ninja reserved on 15 servers. Wait for 6 months to a year and sell it for 1000g+ per server. "That wont happen" - watch me. "Buu uBUuu buu buU No 1 PAYZ that MuCH 4 a NAME?!?!?!?" - Yes. They. Do.
---
Anyone in support of sharding is misinformed about how it was in vanilla. Servers need identity. In vanilla, walk into IF and you'd see familiar names and guilds. That asshole ninja, the weird enchanter. Not a ton of people running around from different servers. Fuck that. 
---
This is sadly entirely too true!
---
People will try. You will get pockets of players that will try to form but life gets in the way and people will be influenced more by their friends than they are from people here. Its best to choose something that suits you, your timezone and your close friends and then build relationships with people who share a similar schedule to you. I know NightkingriderDragonSlayer666 is a super cool guy who is trying to lead a Classic guild and is promising you the world, buuuuut most of these guilds will fall short so I'd worry about the guild when youre ready to join a guild and benefit; at 60.
---
I think by summer they probably mean Q3 which is july 1st-sept 30th.
---
Has a lot to do with who you have available... You can start with an idea of your comp but MOST of the people who SAY they want 14 and start with you, probably wont even make it to level 60, let alone grind the ranks with you. 
---
You are going to meet most of the people you rank with, as you PVP and find people with a similar schedule to you. Im calling it right now, NO ONE will start at level 1, with 9 other people and level at the same speed to 60 AND start the rank grind together, AND have all 10 finish together, it will never happen. Please accept my challenge and prove me wrong - you cant.
---
A good player who is a sub optimal class is better than an optimal class that is shit. A player with a ton of time on his hands, that is shit but negatively affects the bracket, MAY be better to take onto your team so you can control his honor gain than to let him be shitty by himself and still force your team into a lower bracket...
---
There are SO many considerations. What about the feral druid that is AWESOME for you guys in WSG? Hes kind of useless in AB, so youre just not going to bring him? Thats bullshit. What about the "main" premade team you are facing, what is their comp? If you are able to counter them, THAT IS THE OPTIMAL comp and that may not be a cookie cutter build.
---
Nothing is certain for the time being. You’re guess is as good as any of ours. There’s a long time between classic release and naxx, so developers have plenty of time to decide what the best course of action is. Many people are hoping for fresh vanilla content additions, and even though I would personally enjoy that myself, I find it hard to believe blizzard would dedicate time and money towards new art assets/dungeon designs/raid implementation. It would probably be cheaper to continue on and remake The Burning Crusade. I would be quite happy with that as well. It all depends on how classic is recurved, so even if vanilla wasn’t your thing guys (I’m looking at you reddit), if you want any chance at a TBC or Wrath server, then cheer on classic WoW with all your heart. That’s the only way you may see your personal favorite expansions remade 
---
My first "WoW" moment was leveling a gnome warlock in newbie zone. I got a quest to go to Ironforge and I remember having to run a long way (or so I thought at the time). I was at the bottom of the ramp and there were a bunch of people running around with red names attacking other people with green names. At the time I didn't know what a skull meant for me level wise so I just started casting shadow bolt... I missed a bunch and got resisted. All of a sudden I was dead. That was my first pvp experience... that was my first WOW experience. It was amazing...
---
Why wouldn't it be? Horde racials are a massive advantage in classic, Without a doubt every top or even semi competing guild will be horde. 
---
My first wow moment was when I saw rogues with the red defias bandana.
---
Or the same size
---
But we are all older and all wiser, I want to play Alliance but would never consider picking them due to the massive racial imbalances. Then its paladins vs shamans, I think paladins inch ahead but not by much and fear ward which whilst amazing can be replaces with WOTF or a well timed tremor.

SGP will be a PvP server based guild playing the Alliance faction. We have a decent core of 5 to 7 players who have raiding experience in both live and private server settings and are itching to take a second crack at the endgame content vanilla had to offer. 
---
Older, wiser, and way better at using macros, I want use the knowledge I have now to to help give players that same opportunity in a positive environment focused on building a strong community and end game progression. 
---
If you have any interest in raiding endgame content in vanilla or are just looking for a cool place to to level and make friends SGP would love to have you!

Feel free to reach out to me via reply, DM, or Discord [Hi Im Otis.#4847] if you have any questions!

Why? They rolled on loot for their friend who needed it, They are using the system as intended. You would also have to shitlist 95% of your server becasue its not going to be the same as the few ninja's you had back in the day. 
---
Remove it and if your ML fucks up live with it, The loot will drop again. People are so scared to live with their mistakes. 
---
I MC'd a main tank off of the blackrock mountain ledge and the entire raid chased me. Me and my friend (a warlock) began fearing and MC'ing numerous players into the lava. As they closed in we slow falled to the small rock near the MC window entrance and continued to fear and MC people in lava. We never died and killed about 10 of their raiders.
---
Me and my same friend had low level shamans we would log onto during all the alliance raiding schedules that we knew of. We would hide them in random places within blackrock mountain and dispell as many world buffs as we could as the raids ran by.
---
One time a friend of mine who was a hacker (kitty scripter) found an unpassworded URL that logged all the accounts for elitemmorpg gaming. They sold gold and character boosts. We had a list of about 50-150 character names, levels, accounts and account passwords in this huge text document. We proceeded to go through all of them farming dishonorable kills, dropping proffesions, DE'ing gear, taking guild banks, betting INSANE sums of gold and items outside of ORG/IF while dueling on their characters... We justified it as vigilante justice for people who we viewed as cheaters, but the reality was that we were just dickheads who wanted a good laugh. Best items I ever deleted were sulfuras, many TF bindings and a ZG tiger. They were likely all restored.
---
One time we locked a character down with ganking for an entire weekend. We took shifts. After awhile, a guy PM'd us begging us to let his GF have her character back. We demanded ransom and he complied. After giving us the gold/mining mats I told him that he had paid me off, but not my friends. They continued to camp her character for another 24 hours. The real joke is how much time we spent on the game.
---
Soooooooooooo many memories. I could go on all day...
---
OOOO a good pvp related one was my grind to rank 13. I got their and struggled to afford the gear. So I started wrapping blacksmith hammers and C.O.Ding them to level 30-40 characters for 5g each. I would often buy the really cheap blue / epic patterns on the AH and send them out as well for people who asked for additional chances in my lottery so that they would continue to purchase. I targeted level 30-40 players because they tended to have gold for their mount but were often incredibly dumb when it came to the game, so they were pretty easy to exploit. The scam worked well. Too well... I began making hundreds and hundreds of gold per week. I got banned within about 1.5 months. The next patch you were unable to mail C.O.D items that were wrapped. I like to think this was my contribution to WoW. I know, this one was only SORT of PVP related...
---
Uhhh... So many more too...
---
So instead of having loot trading have a rule that all requests for loot moving by a GM will be binned no questions and if you persist you will recieve a temp ban, The GM's time is worth more than "lol soz I rolled need on this plate helm as a mage but my friend (and the 2 other warriors in the group) wants it can you give to them pls"
---
Why are you for changes in Vanilla? I thought this sub was #nochanges?
---
So you're okay with changes, but only when it fits your personal criteria? Hokay dude.
---
One of my favorite world PvP experiences came while leveling my Tauren warrior in the Searing Gorge. I was minding my own business when of course a dirty gnome rogue tries to gank me. Lucky for me he screwed up his stun rotation and I was able to start getting some hits in. Once he realized he might lose the fight he vanished and tried to run. I war stomped and broke his stealth so he popped sprint and evasion in an attempt to run away. I mounted up and gave chase. Upon seeing this he attempted to jump down the large crevasse that cuts through Searing Gorge hoping to shake me by utilizing his safe fall. The shining moment came when I jumped in after him, switched to zerker stance mid drop, intercepted him to prevent myself from taking any fall damage, then summarily executed his ass. 
---
My all time favorite PvP moment came during early BC. As a horde player I jumped on the Belfadin bandwagon right away. While leveling in STV (I was around level 36ish) I started to get harassed by an alliance hunter. He was a few levels lower than me and couldn't do much as I was easily able to kite him around trees and heal myself. I was also speced protection which allowed me to mitigate a large amount of damage he was doing. As I'm laughing at this guy trying to kill me I get attacked from behind by a rogue. I quickly start taking the situation seriously as it is now 2v1. I turn to face the rogue to start blocking his attacks. I focus more on keeping myself healed simply because I know a rogue will eventually kill themselves on all of my damage reflect. I continue to use the tree we're fighting next to to block LOS from the hunter and help reduce the damage he is doing. As I'm getting into the rhythm of the fight, ANOTHER alliance dog joins the fight, this time an arms warrior (lucky for me he was pre mortal strike). By this time I've already gotten the rogue down to low health, but he hasn't fled yet. I continue to kite around the tree healing myself and reflecting damage back to the rogue and warrior. Eventually they realize they are not going to be able to kill me and start to run, but it was too late. I'm able to kill the warrior with my hammer of wrath due to his lack of escapes, the rogue pops evasion and sprints away, and the hunter is still trying to plug me with arrows. With the other two gone I turn my attention to the hunter and start chasing him. He quickly turns tail and runs, with me laughing in the distance. The satisfaction I felt at that moment was unsurpassed by any other PvP experience I've ever had. Not only did I win a 3v1, but I was finally able to show a few alliance bucketheads just how OP paladins were. 
---
TL;DR Gnome rogue attempted to gank my warrior. I turn the tide of the fight and start chasing him. He jumps off a cliff to try and escape and I jump after him using intercept to negate fall damage, killing him at the bottom. 
---
Leveling protection blood elf paladin in STV. Alliance hunter, rogue, and warrior all try and gang up on me. Kill warrior and scare off rogue and hunter. 
---
Because they make decent use of the loot the fury warriors don't want, is my guess.
---
But under the loot sharing system its not ninja looting. Its hedging a bet. Just another part of the game. 
---
WoW if it was a zelda style pixel art top down mmorpg XD
---
Jusy give people on dead servers free server transfers. Why the fuck would u merge servers.
---
\&gt; I think the sheer lag in classic raiding (especially during peak hours when several guilds would be progressing at the same time) made several of the fights unplayable, or vastly more difficult than they had to be. 
---
I think this is something that gets looked over a lot when comparing vanilla to later xpacs. Most players were probably averaging between 10 to 20 fps in 20+ man raids. Not to mention using mass voice chat was less accessible and internet in general being much worse. 
---
I upvote to agree with the kid, right?
---
&gt; How about instead of that, you see "Stabbyz -- Tichondrius" and a bunch of random assholes from other servers?         
---
That's not how sharding works..       
---
Private servers themselves aren't taboo here as a ton of the people here play one them, what is a taboo however, is trying to bring ps-specific things into classic (front-stabbing,/sit macros or gigantic pops).        
---
There were barely any if any at all clusterfucks of people at launch of actual vanilla, the pops were 2,5k-4k with dynamic increases according to some interview i can find if you ask me to.        
---
Yeah same, i think its the most realistic route for them to go. A true classic plus, could be awesome. 
---
Kara is a no brainer. The dragon keep in Wetlands, Mt. Hyjal. Would love some curve balls too, like maybe deeper into Blackfathom Depths is the remnants of a naga city still thriving idk.
---
Its already being changed... Loot trading is a non blizzlike change.
---
I agree no changes, No loot trading. 
---
yeah, bfa is so perfect, its time to make something new
---
People consistently interchange "viable" with "optimal", even though they know it really means something like "not categorically worse than something else in the same slot".
---
A nude level one toon is "viable" in the sense that thirty-nine other toons can carry them to a win in a raid. But if you had the choice of a BiS-geared mage or a nude level one toon you'd pick the mage, right?
---
A melee hunter or an OOMkin or something is "viable" the way a nude level one toon is, but not "viable" in the sense that you'd ever take one to a raid over a minimally competently geared and played mainspec DPS.
---
Loot trading existed in Vanilla. It was used quite often in cases of incorrectly assigning loot, miss-clicks, etc. GMs would gladly reassign gear as long as you stayed in the instance and waited long enough for the ticket to go through.
---
The only difference is that in Classic this process will be automated, with no need for a GM to physically be at a computer.
---
Removing loot trading is anti-Vanilla. Why are you being a hypocrite?
---
The pops were capped at 3k mostly iirc, which is fine imo. The point I was trying to make was that unsharded ridiculous pop private servers running off of a rented datacenter in France can handle it, why can't a multi billion dollar company?
---
And there are so many obfuscating terms for sharding/phasing/CRZ that I have no idea anymore. Either way, it wasn't in vanilla so it's detrimental IMO. Not seeing people is bad. I'd accept it if they came out and said "Only for the first 2 weeks in 1-15 areas", that'd be fine. But knowing the entire world can be permanently sharded triggers the shit out of me. 
---
Brilliant. So merging destroys server community, but allowing the entire server to transfer wherever the fuck they want doesnt? Smart guy. Why the fuck would you merge servers? To preserve realms and communities that are dying probably?... Sort of like what Blizzard did in actual vanilla.
---
As of right now I haven't heard or read anything hinting at a continuation. Seeing as "end of Vanilla" is ~2-3years from now (if they have vanilla-esque release times of raids). 
---
I'm guessing you will hear something about Vanilla+ / TBC sometime after Naxx is released in Classic.
---
This was never the case. A GM might swap an important piece of raid loot but you would get told to get fucked if you asked to have a deadmines blue traded over and it would take days to do so. If loot trading has a 4-7 day time slot then yeah sweet lets do it, Something better is going to drop during that time. As it stands this change is not blizzlike and will only stand to be abused by people like yourself (and myself, And the entire population of the game honestly) which is why you are so adamant about it staying. I say save the people from themselves, Keep classic wow alive. 
---
If the servers are dead there is no community. 
---
Brick killed a guy.
---
&gt; A GM might swap an important piece of raid loot but you would get told to get fucked if you asked to have a deadmines blue traded over and it would take days to do so.
---
This is 100% untrue. Source: GMs answered my loot tickets within a couple hours on the regular.
---
Why do you keep lying?
---
While the idea of "new" content is interesting, I personally would prefer to see a continuation through BC. It was the only expansion in my opinion that didn't take away from the old world. Players still interacted the same way that they did during vanilla. Vanilla zones were still populated and heavily utilized during the leveling process. As far as I can tell a vast number of the issues that players have with retail WoW did not exist yet with the BC expansion, and really only started with WotLK (group finder and the like). Continuing through BC would definitely give Blizzard another couple years of milking the Classic WoW idea. I'd also be down for Blizzard to start making changes to the game if they do re-release BC. Changes such as the removal of flying mounts, not allowing cross server dungeon finders, and other things that caused the game to diverge so drastically from what made Vanilla such a great game. But that is all so far in the future that it seems silly to discuss much further than I already have. 
---
Classic WoW is a preservation project for gaming history. It is not meant to be a new WoW reboot. So yeah basically we play 1.12 forever after Naxx launches. The thing is there are many players who want to experience all the content, but don't have the time to invest for progression raiding. On the Classic servers they have all the time they want. You aren't forced to rush because there is new content all the time, which is a good thing in my oppinion.
---
My guess is they eventually release TBC servers but don't expect Classic to have new content.
---
No one is lieing here, I also tried to have several pieces of loot traded that were either ninja'd from me or for me after several days wait I was told we wont be doing that and the ticket was then closed. 
---
Right. But what is dead? Is dead 1000 active players? 500? What is dead? A lot of players wait out the storm because they have established guilds and dont want to leave... A dead server doesnt mean there is "no community", it means that its VERY weak and suffering. If you take two weak communities and merge them, they are able to keep their friends and their guilds while gaining a larger economy and playerbase. Typically Blizz also factored in faction balance when merging. Instead of 3 hours BG Q's these servers finally had 30 min Q's. It was a massive improvement.
---
Wouldn't be to sure of that, theres more big streamers going for it, like sodapoppin for example. 
---
I don't believe you. Can you show me proof, because otherwise I think you're just making shit up to win an argument.
---
The fact is: Everybody knows that GMs would answer tickets about transferring loot. The only difference between that and the new system is that instead of a human clicking the reassign button, it'll be a machine doing it.
---
Very good points. Especially the fact that all classes in retail have movement and defensive abilities to deal with the additional mechanics is important to consider. 
---
Mine is not, I'm sorry. What I tried to say was that you take a clock from outside the game next to your desktop. You fly from A to B anywhere on the world and take the time if you do the flight for the first time. Once you have the time you just fly up to the sky ceiling, set your direction and set an alarm. Now you can just fly from A to B without ever having to the touch the ground.
---
&gt;why can't a multi billion dollar company?
---
They changed their "servers" to run off of a cloud system rather than a proper server blade like it was back in the day, This new system can not handle too many people in the same place. We will see full on sharding throughout the entire game no questions. 
---
Between that and loot trading its shaping up to be nothing like World of Warcraft. Guess I can always enjoy private servers despite all their shitty drama... 
---
True but I am of the opinion that should Classic be a huge hit, they will want to keep those customers coming back.
---
I guess we'll have to wait and see. If Classic is wildly successful I think they will rework future expacs to please that segment of the population.
---
Of course not becasue it was from decades ago. I am yet to see some real proof of this loot trading being a thing either though (again outside of top end raids) 
---
Im at the point where yeah put it in let the ninja's have their day, Kill off classic wow early then we can all go about our day. 
---
Yeah thats right, thats why i need use a database
---
&gt;I think the sheer lag in classic raiding (especially during peak hours when several guilds would be progressing at the same time) made several of the fights unplayable
---
That's fair, however skill doesn't let you play around that in Vanilla.
---
Even then the lag is more harmful on mechanics rather than tuning generally (hi Thaddius).
---
&gt;Barely any loot to go around so progression would get stuck while you geared up your raid.
---
Not as much of a problem by Naxx tbh (in terms of not enough loot). Naxx does have some pretty heavy requirements which leads to burnout and the need to regear new players, however there are a ton of good pieces available once you're into Naxx.
---
&gt;in my experience managing Mana was actually a thing and you might have to down rank spells and use consumables at carefully timed intervals to give yourself the best chance of lasting the fight with good uptime.
---
As a healer.
---
As a mage or warlock you had enough mana to avoid downranking.
---
&gt; How about instead of that, you see "Stabbyz -- Tichondrius" and a bunch of random assholes from other servers? Or you don't even see your guild mates?
---
That's not sharding, that's cross realm.
---
But sharding sucks too.
---
That's garbage. So no massive world pvp battles with 80 people? I remember entire GUILDS crashing emerald dragon pulls of the opposite faction. It was a glorious bloodbath. Hardcore nolifers would scout bosses and there would be chaos. Corpses turned into exploding mushrooms. Whining on the forums after. Fucking awesome. 
---
If what you said is true, the game will die because Blizzard half-assed it and it won't be true vanilla.
---
Well look, there's at least a few good things to come from this
---
1. We will have access to true 1.12 values and more code, meaning private servers will be fully accurate. 
---
2. People like Esfand, Tips Out etc will migrate back to private servers as well as the core vanilla audience, causing a resurgence in their popularity and allowing the game to be run by those passionate about it instead of Kotick. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25895
---
Massively untrue statement made by him... There are TONS of streamers, even streamers for Classic with fan bases in the thousands... Consider a WoW server is made up of 2-5000 players, one streamers fan base (even if that streamer is relatively small) could have a MASSIVE impact on the server.
---
Would be sick but I doubt it honestly
---
I hope it is for real and not a joke! 
---
Sharding = splitting people into separate micro-servers. This is mostly done to reduce operating costs, as you can better manage your servers by shutting down those that aren't in use. It also has some other side effects such as less ping, as each individual server won't have nearly as much to do.
---
Phasing = putting players into different "game states", usually based on quest progression. This is done for the RPG element, so that they can change the look of a zone based on your progression. As a result of player A and B seeing different things, they also become unable to see each other unless they are on the same game state.
---
Cross-realm zones = Zones that allow players from different servers to see and interact with one another.
---
They're all awful anyway. But personally I don't think you need to worry about sharding. Their reasoning for considering it as an option for launch is valid. The problem is the absurd number of tourists that Classic will get. They are probably aiming to fill the servers to like 200% capacity or such, so that when the tourists leave, the servers still have a healthy population.
---
There's also various reasons why they really can't utilise sharding in the long-term, as they have pointed out themselves. Consider Kazzak or the Emerald Dragons. In the sharding approach, there could be multiple world bosses, or alternatively you could only see the world boss if you're on a specific shard. That technically doesn't stop them from utilising it in zones that don't have world bosses, but the fact that they brought up such things themselves gives me confidence that they understand the problems of sharding and are truly only considering it for launch period.
---
Best classic pvp guild was “local defence” from skullcruser US. Raid comp didn’t matter too much for them. Was all about time put in. They had more rank 14’s than any other server. They controlled the top ranks only allowing the chosen two to get rank 14 each week. 
---
it makes no sense to me at all. 
---
raiding is the fun part, preparing is the chore.
---
I would rather raid for 3h instead of 1h then having to run arround the world alone clicking on gear icons for even 30 minutes.
---
Tokens are items you can buy for real money and put on AH to sell to other players for gold.
---
When you buy one and use it, it gives you one month of sub.
---
Gonna need a hefty redesign of some of Outland for that, but could be interesting 
---
I think mine was the ground beginning to shake, then looking around to find an Ancient Protector looming over me.

Sharding world bosses is a HUGE mistake. Like massive. So is sharding things such as fire elementals in Arathi, blackrock mountain etc. 
---
Guilds fought for control of world bosses and strategic resources. Devilsaur Mafia was a thing (cancerous but fun and adds community depth imo). They were strategic resources and led to drama. 
---
Not everyone is supposed to kill world bosses. In fact, they're luxuries for guilds who dominated. People who played for 15 hours a day would camp them and battles were fought constantly especially during the AQ chain. 
---
This topic comes up constantly because like I said, there are a lot of people who want TBC more than Vanilla. Complaining about this is just silly, we wouldn't have gotten classic in the first place if people weren't so vocal about wanting to experience Vanilla again. 
---
1. What @underthingy said
---
2. What was there to update? New raid, new battleground? All they're doing is bugfixes, who cares about fixed bugs if you can't play it yet?
---
Not to mention groups of Dwarves and Gnomes crowding the one Night Elf that ran all the way to Dun Morough to sexy dance for silvers in the pub. Everyone is going to have different memories of things happening on what is supposed to be the same server.
---
I'm against the grain to a lot of r/classicwow, but Ion has given us plenty of reason to reason to be skeptical. Not just questionable opinions (titanforging, players couldn't find a vendor, etc)... but since he promised major^(ly needed) shaman reworks a couple months ago "in an upcoming patch" only to say in a recent Q&amp;A not to expect it for another 1.5 years or so.
---
So yeah, Ion's statements are short on trust.
---
you would have to look up the "beaten corpse", not "Mankrik's wife".
---
Fortunately, one day, a comment appeared...
---
The sign is down, I repeat the sign is down!
---
AFAIK 'token' refers to the 'wow token' in retail which is basically blizzard-sanctioned trades of $ for gold/vise versa. In retail, $20 gets you 1 wow token to put on the AH, which someone can buy for a market-determined chunk of gold, so they can redeem it for $15. (no resale allowed). 
---
I haven't read the transcript, but apparently they denied that tokens will be in classic.
---
Imagine how much the guy who writes april fools patch notes are looking forward to this years work. Write patch notes for 1.13 to include LFR and other things they obviously know we don't want. Easiest piece of work he will ever make. 
---
Fuck sharding
---
Go combat daggers until you have a boatload of crit. I was combat daggers into late aq/early naxx and was still one of the top dps
---
Is there actually any MMO out there right now where you could do anything like this?
---
&gt; We will see full on sharding throughout the entire game no questions.
---
They basicly already adressed this on blizzcon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
That's just diabolical
---
My first wow moment was when i opened the world map and saw how big the game was compared to my character marker.
---
We weren't taking about use of drops, the statement was "why take melee dps a when melee dps b and c do more dps?" and my follow up was "Why take b when c does more?"
---
Thanks a lot dude, what kinda thing would you like to see?
---
Dethecus-salute here ... o7
---
Where is the haha button in Reddit? 
---
I was amazing to find huge high lvl dragon in the middle of low level zone.  Then getting ganked minute later by lvl ~40 undead rogue while running back to Darkshire.
---
&gt; Shamans are great, however alliance generally have the advantage in premades are paladins are simply better. 
---
Depends at what stage the server is. Super early it is Horde favored, then as BWL gets cleared it swings to Alliance, but once Horde gets AQ geared elementals in their premades it equalizes again.
---
WSG was slightly Alliance favored and it was not really due to Paladins, more ramp/gy advantages. I would argue that post-AQ Horde is stronger in AB, both due to its LM advantage and stronger burst ( Horde Elemental/Lock combo vs 2x Ally locks ).
---
Well, the reality on the ground seems to be that rogues are good enough to make the cut in raiding guilds on pirate servers, even if they aren't quite as good as fury warriors.
---
There's a big difference between a toon that does 90% of what a fury warrior does, and one that does 40% of what a fury warrior does.
---
IMO the actual raids force you to play your class more perfect. There are enrage timers etc. so you have very little space on not playing absolutely perfect on your class. Mechanics are important aswell, but on most times, they are a bit more forgiving than classic (aq40/naxx) mechanics. When you did any little mistake back then, it could be a wipe. Like overnuking slightly too much in certain situations - the boss can't be taunted back, can't be moved and the raid instantly wipes.
---
Bosses like Onyxia, Twin Emperors, Cthun, Geddon etc didn't have complex mechanics! But if even one out of 40 players lost controle about that one thing they had to do, the fight is lost for everybody.
---
always found loch modan so small and boring
---
agree with you on duskwood though
---
how would that even work if they make it like on live where name is attached to your account for 6 months   
---
or even if it didnt work like that, is it punishable as in someone pays you gold for name and you dont give it to him  
---
Ulduar level of boss/dungeon design with current level of class design while using old school talent trees in a huge vanilla world instead of a tiny expac world. Vanilla level of gear drop/catch up mechanic.
---
This is the dream. 
---
Most of the fights one person will outgear the other so unless you only want to duell i would not worry too much
---
Oh my god the nostalgia. I spent so many hours just reading in this guide as a kid! 
---
Accepting gold for summons and then intentionally opening a port to the incorrect city. Ganking people ALL day.
---
do you mean yahoo?
---
Eve online is famous for it's massive battles
---
I think you're comparing Vanilla to Retail.
---
Blizzard is a company. Voicing the desire for Classic is one thing, but I'm sure a bigger factor was sub retention/reasons why people quit. Money is the most important thing to a business. That guy is right. If you want #changes or classic tbc, your best bet is to sub to Classic and ask for it when the time comes. 
---
turning off xp was never in vanilla, so why would it be there in classic? It would actually be a real change, because you would suddenly be able to turn in pvp tokens (gives xp).
---
Entirely depends on the amount of people playing Classic. If this sub is right and Classic ends up taking over the majority of the wow playerbase, they will 100% develop more content post naxx to keep people subbed. #Changes2022
---
&gt; where name is attached to your account for 6 months 
---
Huh?
---
&gt; is it punishable as in someone pays you gold for name and you dont give it to him 
---
Its punishable to reserve a name for sale. You dont advertise you are selling it ingame... And you dont allow him to take them name without a downpayment. There is some semblance of an honor system but you can usually find mediators to host a deal. A lot of websites that host rank selling or mythic+ runs will also act as a host for this sort of deal where he gives them the gold, I give them the name and then they make the exchange.
---
If they screw up classic people will move on and the greatest game ever made so far will lay to rest in the hearts of true gamers. but until then people who are speculating everything will be disappointed no matter what is done or said. 
---
That's a terrible idea, actually. A timer on TBC doesn't make people want to rush into Naxx quicker, at least not most people. That's partially the reason why so few people cleared Naxx in the first place. Not enough time/not wanting to spend tons of ressources into getting Naxx gear when TBC is around the corner. 
---
As someone who probably won't be in a hardcore guild, I really hope they don't rush into content that would make Naxx gear obsolete too soon. 
---
To be more specific, servers were clumped into battlegroups with a set number of servers per battlegroup. Not all servers were connected to each other.
---
This means that if you are a frequent PvPer, you should still see the same people in your bgs, you just won't see all of them around your server.
---
This is not upvoted enough... The validity of any class is VERY gear based. Both the gear you are wearing as well as your opponent. Classes change dramatically throughout the course of Vanilla. Rogues will always have a high win percentage as they have the ability to choose their fights and use heavy cooldowns AND they typically have some pretty easy ways to retreat if the fight isnt going well. However, that high win percentage does NOT equate to rogues being overpowered, the reality is actually quite different for rogues, especially as the game progresses into later patches.
---
I’m all for Authenticity, but why would it be bad if we had legion textures ? I play pservers with updated textures and it makes the game so fresh yet so solid 
---
Unpopular opinion incoming...
---
The only solution Blizzard has ever been able to successfully implement for faction balance is server merging. Works incredibly well because they HAVE the numbers of both factions and then merge them creating a healthy environment. This does not come without its downsides but as it stands, this has been the only successful (by my measures of success) implementation of faction balance.
---
So glad this movement is finally dead.
---
Only works on mages and warlocks but with gnomish mind control you can make portal then take the enemy to your capital city and a warlock can use dark pact to drain all there mana and finish em off with dots.
---
as this is a bug, it probably won't work in classic
---
the portal stuff isn't trolling, just douchebag.
---
the ally &amp; horde om the same server won't work in classic PvP servers unless you multibox, in which case you pay twice as much, and you totally deserve to have toons in both factions.
---
They said it would just be at launch, just on starting zones
---
Thottbot didn't have a dark mode though. Add that and I'm all in.
---
Right. Which is why that community has a solid balance - limited servers. Far different situation when there are 20-40 servers or more. Players will reroll as soon as they face faction adversity or worse yet transfer if the option is available. Pockets of players will begin to emerge and strong influencers like streamers will wield huge fanbases that will follow them around. Balancing retail Classic is on a WHOLE different level than 3 prevalent private servers. And to think, a Pserver can have over 20k active players (6-12k online at any given time) yet when a serious guild decides to quit, reroll opposite faction or go to a fresh realm, the faction takes an INCREDIBLE hit and a ripple effect goes across the entire community.
---
Would really rather focus on the here and now and see some Classic Related news, like a BETA
---
Loot sharing wasn't in vanilla why would it be in classic?
---
No sharding? Yep, that’s an upvote.
---
Lol, your point was who wins 1v1
---
Battleground is an entirely different ballgame.
---
Rogue and mage serve different purpose in battlegrounds you can’t really compare them. Mage can dish our aoe and ranged damage, rogue stealths to cap points and dishes out big burst, and can cc from stealth for days. Mage will easily get bigger damage stats than a rogue but what matters is who influences the game more for the win, and that entirely depends on the player 
---
The Automod does remove comments on certain creteria relating to said less legal servers.
---
Trolling =  The art of deliberately, cleverly, and secretly pissing people off, usually via the internet.
---
Also, trolls are by their very nature, douchebags.
---
&gt; the ally &amp; horde om the same server won't work in classic PvP servers unless you multibox 
---
Had 3 accounts in retail vanilla, will have 3-4 in Classic. One in the AH, one for my GF, one for Ally and one for Horde. I have disposable income.
---
That's daft really. 
---
There's another irony in this: Everyone's assuming equal skill/experiance/prep/understanding and reasearch. 
---
A good class doesn't make a good player.
---
An experienced ret paladin is going to beat out your average Joe because they:
---
* Had to work for it, fully understanding how to get the most out of thier class.
---
* Are willing to put the time in to sticking with it and getting the resources needed.
---
* Are not looking for an easy win by doing what they community perception tells them.
---
And this isnt just private server vs retail either (where I think the gap will be WAY more visible. It happens on private servers too, where being an enthuisat doesn't make you good.
---
At the end of the day, reading information in a book about driving a car won't make you an F1 legend. In much the same way, all the info on the net is not only probably a little off but it isn't going to make you a dps legend either.
---
Example: https://youtu.be/1yWXeywPj3U
---
Obviously this is a highlight, but before this video people would've told you even this wasn't ever going to happen. (Not to mention people who raid with this guy will stand by him having similar performances elsewhere).
---
Fact is: Community perception is already twisting to memorys of vanilla community perception, Instead of what's real.
---
TLDR: If you can understand your class, do the work needed and put in the time to gain the experiance, you'll perform higher than your average player/most people making you viable.
---
he‘s referring to the incoming class homogenization of wotlk and onwards.
---
As for actual mechanics to pay attention and work with, newer expansion do win with many more proccs and abilities as well as enemy skills to work around.
---
For theorycrafting though, tbc and wotlk were die probably much more demending due to more talents and skills/spells to work with.
---
To the MODs team credit, if you send in the modmail the link to your comment and that it was faulty removed they are quick to restore the comment.
---
Fair enough. Suppose there's too many to manually check before removing? 
---
Fucking read before you rant 
---
firefox ( or chrome or other browsers...) had addons for that even back then, still do nowadays. Darkmodes for all sites, wether they offer it or not.
---
You're mixing up "viable" with "possible".
---
Not convinced with that, modern theorycrafters are all basically computer programmers as they use APIs. There are also less skills used in rotation pre wotlk than there are now as a general rule. 
---
Either you see them or you don't...
---
Kind of hard to check every post, every comment manually. And the sub is only going to grow. (Inb4 we pas the r/wow subreddit kek)

Nah man. Ion is as passionated as we are for Classic, because he was and still is a hardcore gamer and theory crafter, he knows whats up and why we want Classic and don't want modern shit in the game. 
---
He's playing devils advocate, pretty sure he passes to Activision that Classic will inevitably fail if they introduce crap like that.
---
Just chill the game will be fine.
---
Retail is beyond fixable and the target audience is entitled casuals, he's designing exactly that for retail. So it makes all the sense creating an authentic Classic to grab the oldschool and more hardcore people who left the game long ago.
---
He might be. But he has yet to prove it.
---
Until he prices it with actions. I will not trust him.
---
They could very much add content that adds no story, just more world. Like an additional level 30-40 area and such.
---
This. I've been the same way as you guys for ages. There's a difference between raiding and speed running.
---

---
I agree with you 99%.
---
The "is the guy playing a meta class" thing sais nothing to me, other then he/she read online that "fury warriors are best" and they wanted a quickshort cut to being OP/Flavour of the month.
---
I'd jump straight to your second point.
---
Otherwise I 100% agree.
---
Fair points,
---
I would argue that Naxx swings it back to alliance given Paladins getting well itemised plate again for their role (also the Cleanse set bonus is pretty nuts).
---
No.
---
They don't usually announce the start of their F&amp;F alphas, but it does let us do some datamining, and is always a sign of impending beta within 1-2 months.
---

Authentic Vanilla experience btw. Clap.

You know If we repeat it everywhere, you gotta believe us.
---
This community will get what they deserve. unfortunetly. 
---
Keep downvoting all GIGA game-impactful concerns and things, (these idiots obviously  don't even understand why they are impactful and important, "not a big deal", "you are overreacting", "we don't know yet", "blizzard knows what they are doing") , and upvoting memes and naive flower gamer moments from 2005. thats much more important.
---
horray.
---
as expected community get flooded by casual braindead loyal idiots without a clue.
---
Then you rely on the extension developer doing it right, there not being any weird tags on the site that cause certain text to be treated the wrong way, images without proper transparency are fucked, and the addon could easily get abandoned over the course of the years and years that you'll need it.
---
It's easy without.
---
I don't want easy, I want fun.
---
Raids are fun, farming is not.
---
If we're going to kill the boss anyway, why spend 2 hours + doing boring farming to reduce the fun of raiding by an hour, when you can just spend 2-3 hours raiding instead.
---
I mean - Unless you want to speedrun? In which go ahead, but I ain't keeping up. F that.
---
Yikes...
---
Even a regular elite at the same level tore you up.
---
If I ever found a grey border elite I usually had to message someone around me and party up to take it down.
---
Classic doesn’t spoon feed you shit
---
I think the problem with loot sharing is only dungeons. Noone bats an eye if there is loot sharing in raids since you have a master looter anyway. Loot sharing in dungeons only encourages ninjaing/item selling and should not be implemented.
---
Seal Fate does not make that much sense for PVE dagger rogues in general.  The point of SF is to provide extra CP generation and allow extensive use of Eviscerates.  
---
As a dagger rogue your Backstab simply yields the best energy/damage output ratio and it is not worth to use Eviscerate at all in the majority of situations (The only exception I could think of is the mob being low HP and about to die next second and you don't have enough energy for BS but you have enough CP and energy for Eviscerate). Soyoen and Youfie's dagger rogue theorycrafting does not even include Eviscerate as a part of dagger rogue rotation at all, it's just Backstabs and 100% SnD uptime. 
---
Keep in mind that you are also losing Blade Flurry and Adrenaline Rush (Both are insanely powerful CD's) if you go SF. 
---
Pristine servers weren't classic servers. They were an idea given by blizzard to the community. What it was going to be was retail but with mobs having higher health, lfg/lfr turned off, higher xp per level, etc pretty much vanilla-ify retail as much as they could.
---
This is so easy for blizz - dig up the old files and just release the game. Make some tweaks for api and done.
---
But then it’s: Hmm.... what if we make loot shareable? Not realizing that ninjas, small groups of friends and guilds hugely benefit over the average solo player
---
Every time Modern Blizz adds something they fuck it up.
---
Blizzard, step the fuck back, release Classic as it was, and stop ruining your games.
---
Alex Jones is that you? In all seriousness the way people are reacting to you is fucking nuts. Until we get some hard concrete evidence of these things I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt because actiblizz has been a soulless husk of the early blizzard days. I am concerned for wow classic. 
---
The biggest issue with adding more content would be power growth. As it stands, there is a huge gap in power between players in AQ40 and Naxx gear and those in dungeon blues at 60. Whilst it's fine to have that, adding in another tier of raid content would push that bar even higher, to the point where things start to get silly. 
---
There's also distrust in the community towards Blizzard. A big reason why #nochanges is so prominent is not because people think there were no issues with Classic (there absolutely were and are) but because they don't trust Blizzard to make changes without stuffing things up. Change one thing, the argument goes, and you open the door for Blizzard to change other things, and then you're on the pathway back to where retail WoW is now. 
---
Now can we be satisfied with a relic frozen in time forever, as you say? I'd argue yes. I'm currently replaying Diablo 2, a game that has never had more content added to it since I stopped playing it years ago, and I'm having a great time. I can load up a playthrough of Half Life and know that I'm going to love it, despite having played it before and it having nothing new. It's about the experience. Doubtless people will reach the end of Classic content, clear Naxx and decide to stop playing. But they can always come back to it later if they want to and do it all over again. That's what people are ultimately chasing: the old experiences all over again. 
---
Never in a decade, ever heard of this happening. This issue affect less than 1% of players.
---
Loot sharing fixes a problem that doesn’t exist.
---
And in the process it creates a system that lends massive power to ninja, small groups of friends, and guilds, at the expense of your average solo player.
---
You are probably being limited by the integrated graphics more than the CPU.  I had a Samsung N510 with Nvidia Ion that ran retail WoW acceptably.  Not well, but passable.
---
Agreed about the greatest game being laid to rest if blizzard fucks up.
---
But we are not speculating on loot change.
---
Blizz announced it already, wrote a full blog post about it, it’s been coded and likely already implemented. 
---
They don’t mention stuff then not put it in. They tease with stuff they’ve already prepared and worked on.
---
This is classic modern day out of touch Blizzard. Spending resources on a “fix” that no one wants to a problem no one had. And as a result, creating a new loot system that gives power to ninjas, guilds and small groups of friends, at the expense of solo players.
---
So yeah. Fuck Blizz and fuck the loot change. 2019 Blizz will kill Classic WoW before it even drops.
---
&gt; Confused by arguments that classic raiding isn’t difficult BUT there are only certain ‘viable’ specs
---
The content isnt difficult if people are optimizing and not using meme builds. The inherent difficulty hasnt changed in the past 10+ years, but the approach players take has... Youre on a team of 39 other players. Players are typically NOT using the spec they want to take. As a part of that team, you make a sacrifice for the majority. You are not obligated to do this, but it makes you more desirable to play with and makes finding a spot easier.
---
&gt; A lot of people are talking about class balancing or viability of  certain specs or “memespecs” etc. But I also see a lot of discussion  about how MC40 can be effectively done by 25 efficient raiders. 
---
Right. It can be done by 25 efficient raiders with proper specs and itemization. It can also be failed by 40 players who are suboptimal.
---
&gt; I’ll take an OOMKIN who is literally OOM than a dead mage in the fire. 
---
Sure. So will I. Will you take 2? How about 3? Where is the threshold for meme specs? Surely with a raid of 40 people you can squeeze in 5? Every guild has their limit. As a method of maintaining fairness and order, many guilds will set that limit to 0.
---
&gt; Looking for general discussion on why raid composition is so highly  discussed in these threads when there is probably always going to be 5+  spots up for grabs for good players who don’t have min/max talents or  specs. 
---
Because THESE forums are occupied by people who have been talking about Classic since before it was launched... Have been dreaming about Classic for over a decade and for a lot of us, have been playing Classic (private) while we have waited. We are not casuals. We are occupied with the game and how to optimize our performance. Not all of us, but a large majority of us, which is why you see those discussion trends. Even casual fans wont be googling "Most funnest hunter leveling build", they will want the "best", most "efficient", "Fastest" build... Its just the way things go.
---
laughs in mage/hunter
---
One of the first raid bosses I did was the first few in MC. But the first time I went into Onyxias lair. I had no idea what was in there. When I walked around that corner and you see her there. There was my first big wow moment!
---
I really don’t want to make assumptions but if I may perhaps get a more comfortable chair and consider more physical activity or at the very least stretching. As you get older you just need to do more to make sure you feel good physically. If something doesn’t feel right that’s a sign you have to make some sort of change. You are not alone. 
---
Rogues shouldn’t even be rolling on or equipping swords in classic.......those are hunter weapons....
---
You do not bring a feral druid for only damage or tanking. Unless the druid can do both a warrior or rogue is always better to have in the raid. What a feral druid offers is flexibility.
---
\- They DPS on fights where only one or two tanks are needed.
---
\- Mostly DPS on trash
---
\- They off tank when there are adds, then switch to DPS in the same fight and do a lot more damage than a warrior would in the same role (since they are stuck in tanking gear).
---
\- They tank bosses that have timers since they out perform warriors in TPS (AQ+)
---
\- They decurse with int set (highest mana pool in the game)
---
Unless the druid is played like a hybrid they either become a shitty version of a rogue, or a shitty version of a warrior that's only "optimal" on a handfull of bosses. If played correctly a druid increeses overall raid DPS with the added bonus of not taking plate - tank items. 
---
Server merging destroys the game. It’s disgusting that people are even suggesting such a thing. Where do you fucking people come from.... 
---
Luckily I doubt this will have to happen due to how popular classic will be  
---
Worked in vanilla, will probably work in classic until they patch it. Worked past vanilla, unsure if it works on live guess I could try though.
---
We want our old good game, not a time machine.
---
&gt;The rest of the raid is carrying you and people in better guilds realize you are dead weight. They could literally do the raid without you.
---
Exactly. Carry you, while I PLAY an optimal build to create more throughput so that YOU can play a meme build and then share the loot I EARNED with YOU, when you arent even willing to take a spec that helps us progress. Worse yet if we are wiping or arent clearing ALL the content... What if we are failing by 2-3% and we have 5 meme builds in the guild? Being part of a 40 man team requires teamwork, and sometimes that means being a team player.
---
What the fuck are you talking about. I can’t tell if your trolling or stupid 
---
Your right, forgot Rogues need to roll only on Bows for the ranged rogue/warrior ragnorous strat. 
---
Anyone rememeber when. The weapon speed was so fast melee was better off ranging rag?
---
&gt;Where do you fucking people come from....
---
I come from retail vanilla, where server merges were a common occurrence. You should have been there, it was sweet!
---
&gt; Luckily I doubt this will have to happen due to how popular classic will be 
---
ERRRRR! WRONGO! There will ALWAYS be faction imbalances. Servers will trend and others will falter and if players arent incentivized to join a realm, they wont... That deficit will multiply and thus will balancing issues eventually causing both sides to suffer.
---
I’ve been playing wow since 2005. Server merging was not a common occurrence. I remember the first big server merge was in burning crusade from what I remember. So what if there’s a faction imbalance?! This will always happen. It’s not a big deal that they need to do some bull Shit. Let them pan out naturally. 
---
I’m assuming your a sharding, phasing, and cross realm BG kind of person too. It’s gross. 
---
&gt; Server merging was not a common occurrence. 
---
Oops. Only it was. Perhaps if you played on populated realms it wasnt. But thats the issue isnt it? Players will choose the optimal realm.
---
I can go on my account all the way back to 2005 and see my transaction history. TONS of free days played for servers that were occasionally down that I had toons on and several FREE transfers to dying servers. Of which, the dying servers would then be merged with another realm. 
---
&gt;  So what if there’s a faction imbalance?! This will always happen. It’s not a big deal 
---
Mmmm.... You havent been on a dead realm. 85% faction imbalance, and about 200 auctions up. No one raiding, and no world PvP. One side has instant PvP queues and the other has 3-4 hour PvP Queues. All players are suffering and subscriptions are bleeding by the day... You see, if you dont fix the cancer, people just quit because rerolling isnt really an option for a lot of people. "Why dont they transfer" because for a lot of people in a guild, thats the same thing as rerolling. Merging allows Blizz the opportunity to take two suffering communities and merge them with a positive effect. If the population of one server is low, and so is the other, merging them allows the communities to remain intact while fixing the larger issue. This was usually done based on faction percentages which ALSO allowed Blizzard to balance the faction split for an even great effect. I suppose your solution to this GIGANTIC issue is just to let it die, lose the subs and forget about the community? Brilliant. They should hire you as a community manager, youre a really bright guy.
---
add frost nova and psychic scream to that, and holy shit, that combo can be ridiculous. we used to do semi-premades with a few friends, with my shadow priest and a mage friend often rushing to alli base, while others quickly captured stables (the node next to the alli base) and tried to hold off alli from capturing other nodes. 
---
the trick behind this was a quite twisted one: a mage and priest sitting on the enemy graveyard meant we could instantly CC the respawning ally and hold reinforcements off for quite a while, giving others time to cap all nodes. not the easiest thing to pull off, but if you've succeeded, it was a rather quick victory.
---
There was a post recently where they counter the warrior charge in combat issue. Activision said that even there vanilla server they used did one thing. Which was opposite of old videos on YouTube and other platforms from back in the day. Concluding that the server they base there info on isn't even right... So that argument doesn't stand if even they don't have the right info.
---
Shadowmelded moonkin standing on top of NPCs for quest turn ins where there are guards nearby. Horde players run to the NPC spam clicking to hand in the quest, but accidentally autostrada k the moonkin who pops up at the very last second. Guards proceed to kill horde.
---
There servers won't be able to handle 4 raids of 40 in azshara, look at BFA
---
Mortal strike isnt just heals from healing classes but also potions, first aid, onuse heal trinkets/items etc.
---
So in a prolonged 1v1 fight mortal strike can make or break the fight.
---
Warlock with felhunter out definitely has an edge, however the mage still can win if he is able to burst down the WL. In a longer fight, the warlock will more likely win than lose.
---
It has zero consequence and only enhances the longevity of the game by giving people that much more to do. This type of thinking is so toxic for a healthy Classic community
---
I’ve mained both and had elites shred through my pet even as beast mastery 
---
Mage has it easier but still hard. if the elite resists a single frost nova it’s usually a wipe
---
Succubus has a huge drawback when you dont duel but have a 2nd person with you, so 2v2 the succubus dies in a sweeping strikes + autohit + whirlwind. 
---
So in duels its huge, in small scale PvP the warlock severely hinders himself by having succubus out.
---
For me it made no sense. 
---
I liked mages being learned in various branches of magic, but having a more thorough knowledge in one aspect.
---
Just like a geologist working in the oil industry. He might have an overall knowledge about the different stages of our earth's development, but his main knowledge and application is in finding if his company can frack on this patch of land.
---
A mage can cast powerful fireballs, but his effectiveness in the arcane is limited.
---
Appears that despite cross realm and phasing they are still connecting realms to this day... Here is a general list of connected realms in their current state:
---
  \*As you can see, merging realms is common place and has actually DECLINED since crossrealm has existed as the only incentive to merge at this time is based on server economies. Though I couldnt find an accurate timeline of when realms were merged... This should give some insight into how common this practice is.

No, BFA is out of Beta. New existing expansion pack patches are pushed to the PTR server. Not Beta. Whatever they are replacing it with would be an alpha/beta.
---
im just fucking around, its really luck and timing tho. a hunter can kill everything if he has the space to kite and noone interrupting him tho, still gonna take forever haha
---
From what I understand of an interview with Ion (I think), they're not just looking at the immediate future, but also what Classic will look like in 15 years. This makes me think they'll be doing Classic cycles, relaunching the content progression every 2-3 years. At least to me, it would seem silly anyone would think Classic could last 15 years, if it stagnated forever, once the Naxx stage is released. With cycles, you also give people, that won't be there for Classic launch, to experience it all later, when the next cycle begins. 
---
That is simply down to the configuration. I am no tech wizard but a shard and its capacity should be totally configurable 
---
&gt; I  think to be successful, Blizzard needs to confirm to us what the long  term plan is for The Burning Crusade and later expansions.
---
They could release a literal turd. A piece of human feces wrapped in a box with "CLASZIK" written across the front of it with purple lipstick and I would buy the collectors edition. They dont need to do ANYTHING to be succesful IF your definition (like theirs) is to turn a profit. They dont owe you ANYTHING and you will consume whatever piece of total garbage OR gem they decided to churn out. Youve been waiting too long NOT to buy whatever they create. Will you stay? Maybe not. But all they need is a few million of us to purchase and play for a month and they will have banked a BOATLOAD of cash on content that was over a decade old...
---
Us: "Blizz please sell me what I already own thats VERY old but DONT update it and allow me to pay you a monthly fee to play it please?"
---
Blizzard: "Alright I guess... Are you sure... I think that you THINK you do, but maybe you d...
---
US: "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE NO CHANGES REEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Blizzard: "Alright, lets make it for these screeching retards"
---
Moejel you are wrong about this. Dead servers happened in classic to a lot of servers. Andthe cross realm bgs didnt help them much. There were tons of attempts to open free transfers to those servers in vanilla but none of that really worked which is why they started merging. It was a horrible thing for people stuck on those empty servers, unable to experience raid content because their faction was dead.
---
Really wrong of you to claim it never happened just because you didnt experience it. A little googling would reveal the truth. Not only that, but these dead servers happened in classic when WoW was still growing massively in popularity yet servers still died.... so they will DEFINITELY still die this time too...
---
I had a 60 twink that I did A LOT of low level dungeons with to help friends. Was always pretty fun.
---
oh i know loot trading will be in game and it will fuck a lot of stuff up but hopefully people abuse it so much that blizzard takes it out from all the complaining on the forums. If they listen at all lol. I meant like cash shop and tokens i really do hope they get it right or the month i spent figuring out my plans for when classic launch will be all for nothing.
---
&gt; While lvling, make sure to use a sword in MH and a dagger in OH to get your weapon skills ranking up at the same time. 
---
Was this sarcasm? Please tell me this is a joke... NO one roll with sub-optimal gear to maintain your WEAPON skill while leveling... Play with the best weapons you have access to that do the most throughput... If you get a new weapon, you can skill it up in a few short minutes, this isnt a very long process unless you are taking a weapon up 1-200 skill points. At which point you can travel to MANY unkillable NPC's and use them to grind your weapon skill with ease.
---
4PVP servers. 2PVE, 1RP server. That's how it should be. And don't ask about RPpvp/RPpve, we all know none of them leave the Inns. 
---
Everyone here is insisting on their own made-up meaning of "viable". I am just saying that we should understand that when people say "X is not viable" those people do not mean "it is utterly impossible to clear content with an X in the raid" or "no X will ever get into any raid", and you should respond to what they actually mean. Not to something they never said that, that you have to redefine their words to make them say.
---
Eh BG's are fun but get your guild together than 'steal' the MT of an enemy guild. 
---
They will have to wipe you to get their tank back.

(On Pserver last week)

Just respecced my Pally to ret/reckoning. Level 47. Had been full ret for a while.  I’m in Tanaris so I decide to take this reck bomb thing for a spin. I go outside the walls of the city, /sit like 6 times on a mob just for good measure. Get nice and critted up (Btw: I thought that you could see charges on reck stacking or something, but I guess not). Decide to head out to the pirate cove because there’s usually some good hordies over there. Just as the tunnel comes into view, a 43 rogue comes into vision leaving the tunnel. I’m thinking, “oh man this is perfect.” We have a short stand off, both of us just staring at each other. He dismounts and then I see a 43 orc warrior come into view. Rogue went invis so I knew they were a party and had decided to stunt on me. I get sapped/charged/every stub in the bag. I don’t play rogue so I don’t even know really what all is happening other than I can’t move and I’m already at half HP. I’m spamming my SoC key the whole time. As soon as I “wake up” I simply turn and click on the rogue. Deleted from the game. One shotty (reck bomb, so really like 5 shotted+SoC prob). It felt amazing. The warrior stopped hitting for a second and I knew irl they were both probably pretty stunned. I then duke it out with the warrior and eventually kill. Had to pop bubble and lay on hands though rofl. It was still sick...to me. 
---
It just goes to show how rarely I played Alliance, that if my mind wanders "red text" and "Alliance" become the same thing. Obviously they were Horde players and the guards were Alliance. I remember the name of the priest toon, and that I never made sixty with it.
---
Be Warlock,
---
Go to starting zone,
---
Summon Infernal,
---
Set free.
---
But i guess its not funny. 
---
Eyyyyyyy! We got ourselves a Vanilla man here! Pay attention, this is what someone who ACTUALLY played vanilla says!
---
They've said multiple times they won't shard Wbosses. Hell, it was even one of the major points they brought up. 
---
yayaya my class was good I don't want classes to be good to blablabla.
---
Balancing =/= homogenization. Except in your short-minded world.
---
Hang in there Tribalbob, ive been arguing below like a motherfucker! Were gonna come out of this thing unscathed brother!
---
after nax there is an option to be copied to a bc server or stay on the last patch forever.
---
id probally stay on the nax patch forever and make a new character for the bc server
---
&gt; in BC horde had much better pvp racials, the best for warriors(orcs) , the best pallies(belfs) , the best for shamans(orcs), the best hunters(orcs), the best rogues(ud/orcs), the second best druid (xD), and the best casters in PvP(ud)  
---
which is why everybody race changed to human for perception...
---
After playing druid on retail for so long, when I tried a druid on a private server I found myself really frustrated with stupid stuff I got accustomed to like not being able to talk to NPCs while shapeshifted or rejuv not automatically taking you out of bear/cat form to cast and having to do it manually.
---
Orc is certainly better, but the argument can be made for tauren tanks. If I planned on main tanking as a warrior I would 100% go tauren, they just fit the "feel" of a tank so well
---
Stop using so many ellipses.
---
I see where you're coming from but here's how I look at it. 
---
As a frost Mage, my main abilities that have the most significance should be frost. In modern wow, to maximize dps, I will use frost abilities. I do know a couple small arcane abilities though. I can polymorph and cast arcane intellect. 
---
I just hated being a frost mage when my highest aoe was arcane barrage instead of blizzard, or fire blast instead of ice Lance. Just doesn't make sense. It's like a professional quarterback being better at catching a ball instead of throwing it. 
---
Thats how private servers work. And thats how I hope will classic dont. Do you really want to experience all expansions again? I dont. I wanna see something new. Something unique. 
---
You say this like your know it will be the case. No one knows what will happen. This is what you *hope* will happen.
---
Gnome priest... ?

Wow

That's different. As someone else in the thread confirmed, the beta of BFA was still in the launcher until a couple days ago. It had just been sitting there.

I would not at all be opposed to them making some new raid dungeons in a few years time marginally harder than Nax so pvp won't be too broken. I myself will never play that content as I cannot dedicate enough time to WOW to play it. Huntard here I come!
---
It's actually pretty easy and smart to rotate your MH/offhand for weapon skill, and way easier to do it as you go then to realize at lv 40 you got a nice mace and have 1 skill in maces. If you're powerleveling to 60 for sheer time, sure, skip this. Otherwise, this is like saying "do your professions as you level" it's just 1 way of doing things, not a 'wrong' way. 
---
And bandaging your pet as a hunter is perfectly fine, what are you on? Everyone should level up bandaging and hunter's care more about mana than they do about banking 50+ extra bandages they never use because they so rarely take damage while leveling...
---
Well having the biggest shoulders on a warrior does increase the intimidation factor lol
---
i think it will release on the same time, so they can blame the massive increase in subs on their shitty bfa patch
---
there is no competition, they share the same sub
---
Should does not mean will. I've been with blizzard from the start and they are very lawyer like, they will shard everything unless the numbers drop to a couple hundred. 
---
TBC
---
I hope they don't change anything past the final update. I want the game to be frozen in time, with no changes, and no updates.
---
&gt; if you want any chance at a TBC or Wrath server, then cheer on classic WoW with all your heart
---
That's exactly why I'll play Classic.
---
Everybody has its favorite, for me vanilla raids and overall gameplay are too old and limited (too few mechanics, no challenge before AQ, low skill ceiling rotations) while I consider TBC heroic dungeons and raids to be the all time best PvE content released in WoW while LK was the best state of the balance regarding builds diversity.
---
I really hope Classic will have a big enough player base in the long run to be profitable to Blizzard and trigger the remake of TBC as well. Fingers crossed.
---
Just gotta plop down bridges/stairs where you need flying. Shouldn't be too hard.
---
You play it until you get bored, then play something else and leave the game as it was for people to play untouched as we asked for and Blizzard have promised.
---
If you want to play something that isn't vanilla, there is the main game or perhaps tbc if classic is a roaring success.
---
Maybe they will sort their tech out? Who can say at this point but yeah their choice of words fills me with enough doubt. That plus loot trading is enough for me to sadly skip. Well I might play a bit to ninja some stuff and show the downsides of loot sharing to people before I officially peace out but we shall see. 
---
If they do add content, I would only be fine with them adding more "lower-tier" content. Content with middling Lv 60 stats. So you'll have more raid options with new tier set bonuses, but you won't be increasing the powerlevel because Naxx gear will remain at the top.
---
These threads make me wonder how many people are really going to stick around... When suddenly everyone realizes that they aren't OP and the game is actually hard work.
---
If you want to see WoW after Naxx, they have a version for that.
---
Unless you are highly mobile I would advise against a laptop for gaming. I basically have no choice and really miss a desktop despite my laptop being £2500. For less than $1000? Dont do it to youself.
---
What the heck is a 60 twink? That's a contradiction.
---
Google some "alpha wow" videos. Karazhan was planned already for vanilla back in the days. Also bigger cities like if or uc. They just get greedy and let it for expansion. No I dont wanna play tbc. I wanna play vanilla but longer, greater, more challenging and even more epic. 
---
He meant to say malware.

uBlock Origin + uBlock Origin Extra + Privacy Badger works for me at least

That's what wowhead looks for me on basically every page.
---
Facials matter, just make sure to keep that mouth open!
---
&gt; Patchwerk is amusingly a really easy 'Patchwerk fight' compared to modern ones
---
What do you mean by that? Patchwerk is a gear check and not supposed to be mechanically intensive as a boss. It's a boss that tests if your raid has good enough gear to proceed past it.
---
Are you saying that in retail gear check bosses are harder because it's harder to gear your raid? I don't really believe that, seeing as the loot system seems to be one of the most complained aspects of retail WoW not to mention as far as I know (I don't play retail) every boss drops something like 5 items for your 20 player raid, whereas in vanilla bosses drop significantly less items for a 40 player raid.
---
So unless you meant that similar fights in retail are harder mechanically I don't really agree with that point, and even when it comes to mechanics a gear check boss isn't supposed to be about them anyway.
---
It’s gonna clog up your PC so much you might actually believe you’re back in 2005. If they have a news section for Thottbot as well you can bet your ass they’re gonna write about how great feminism is as well.
---
EXACTLY. So what do you hope for? This should be discuss thread. This is my idea, to make it even better. I dont think blizz will realize that anyeay.. but,  whats yours? 
---
Exactly this. In my mind, the "final battle" (I didn't realize it was a no-ending rpg) was at The Altar of Storms. 
---
\-Truth  
---
\-You haven't seen the revised boss health numbers yet, pure speculation.  
---
\-Have to say I agree, not from a balance but from a fun perspective. Because balance is subjective and we haven't seen any final versions yet, again making it pure speculation.  
---
\-DM launched less than a month after release on EU and KR, and only a tiny portion of people even made it to 60 on NA before DM, Ragnaros wasn't even killed on NA until 6 weeks after DM release. Calm your sh\*t.  
---
\-You haven't seen the actual droprates yet, pure speculation.  
---
\-If the content rollout being condensed slightly is such a big deal to you, I'm suspecting you of having an entitlement problem. Also we don't know the actual timeline yet, pure speculation, and terrible speculation too, most people are assuming a stretched schedule, because it makes logical sense. I'm starting to doubt your intelligence.  
---
\-What? If you're talking about stuff like titanic leggings and such, it's pure speculation as we don't yet know if they'll be available at launch. Could you stop assuming so fucking much, holy shit.  
---
\-Even more speculation, I'm full on doubting your intelligence at this point.   
---
\-I know many people that raided for all of vanilla without even killing Razorgore. Your memory is pretty shite, there were huge canyons between players, guilds and factions on many servers.  
---
\-Which streamers are advocating Xrealm BGs? I'd like to know so I can stop supporting them.  
---
\-To be fair most of these "issues" are completely made up in your head, so you can't really fault them for most of them - claiming people are "ignoring" the current activision blizzard drama is hilariously stupid, as literally every wow content creator has gone bananas over it and released multiple videos on the subject.   
---
    
---
Go put on your tinfoil hat and go scream at the DMV lizard people, maybe they'll listen to your incoherent babble.
---
Some guilds even discourage people to get r13/14, they found out most people quite wow shortly after reaching their goal.   
---
Its so fan to play premade vs premade and observe how each team change and evolve their composition only because you try to outplay each other.   
---
Amazing.
---
Does that work with polymorph too?
---
unless they don't consider it a bug, in which case it could work for all of classic
---
Ret being top of the charts? What the fuck are you talking about? Was he playing with 5 year olds? That is not possible on classic servers. Like I said paladins are bugged on private servers, so it may be possible on those broken servers but not on live, never. 
---
It doesn't matter "how good you are", your entire rotation is autoattack. Even if he has every consumable/pot/flask/etc in game versus players in greys and greens, he still would not come close to "top the chart". It is simply not even remotely possible on live servers, stop being delusional. 
---
Ret paladins are great in pvp, not in raids, just deal with it and accept reality or you will have a shitty time on live servers. 
---
You could (I’m sure you can’t anymore),  Polly someone in the world, cast portal to wherever city, have your priest mindcontrol the person out of sheep, have him take the portal. 
---
Agreed. You can built a decent gaming pc for $700-$1000  and it’d be 100000x better than any gaming laptop. 
---
In later patches, if the elite was "flying" like drakes then they didn't give a shit about your frost nova.
---
Why bother typing that wall out if you were just going to put a disclaimer at the very beginning about you being a smarmy twat? 
---
Perhaps it could also be done to a tank about to pull a world boss
---
Yeah I get the feeling, but I don't want current day Blizzard to be developing it. They don't exactly have a good track record with this sort of thing.
---
I'm not looking to take it serious at all just lay back and playing. 
---
No need for the hyperbole. Mine may be pricey but it's not half bad at running most games on ultra settings. Certainty better than a $1000 pc would.
---
However, as I said, a pc is the smart choice unless your job involves a lot of travel,  as mine does.
---
Like other posters have said, you'll get a better desktop for cheaper, if you don't have a very good reason for getting a laptop I'd recommend a desktop. However if you do need a laptop, I'd start checking Newegg and eBay for refurbished laptops and good deals. Get something with a graphics card, not integrated graphics, and it will probably run wow classic with no problems.
---
Fuck no. Unless you want a laptop for \~mobility reasons\~, I cannot recommend a laptop for vidyagaems. Just build your own system, much more fun and you may learn something while youre at it. And no \~wireless gaming\~ either, run a goddamn cable, make the effort.
---
It's just a better experience on a 28"+ monitor. Mine is 19" and it is just not as immersive for gaming. Trust me. You will have a better woe adventure on a desktop.
---
It would be a 4:3 CRT monitor at 1024x768 with a framerate cap of 25fps outside and 12fps in raids.
---
Rotations having less skills is not an issue for theorycrafter. As an example, Warrior and Retadin theorycrafting involved a lot with working around auto hit timer and less about a rotation.
---
Furthermore, if you had "free time", there was always engineering.
---
While there was less use of API back then, theorycrafters back then were still programmers or people with a statistical background or interrest, developing simualations and running statistical tests or calculations to show a superior built was common.
---
The amount of possible combinations is less after WotLK, this is a simple fact made by WotLK and TBC having the biggest number of talent points and talents avaible + amount of skills possible to be used. On top of that, there were more mechanics to calculate into (Resistance, partial resists, crushing blows, etc.)
---
Not sure about the amount of procc items now and back then since I'm not really that much into current retail. But with the lack of direct access to procc rates, a lot of time was spent on figuring out how certain proccs work (Windfury effects in particualry).
---
I know I would I would never argue that 
---
Don't think that article ever was countered, the Blizzard interview talks about charging a neutral mob, all examples in that thread are either hostile mobs, PVP combat or footage from private servers. None of the linked "evidence" video's actually features neutral mobs when i last checked that thread. 
---
Interview is here in english: https://www.wowhead.com/news=289806/wow-classic-interview-with-brian-birmingham-and-omar-gonzalez-for-computer-bild
---
Relevant quote from the interview:
---
&gt;  If you attack a neutral creature and turn off auto-attack while your character is still heading for the enemy, the stun ends, and he will walk away as if you were not even there. 
---
I know that ;) a desktop just doesn't work for me now days. 
---
idk. why do people think that vaccinating kids is bad? why do they vote for an useless media figure to be their president? people do stupid shit.
---
It's just stupid to make any plans when the actual game isn't even released.
---
AND YES IT'S A MUSEUM Game, FROZEN IN TIME. 
---
They said they wanted kids to see the game how it was back then. Especially their own kids. Period.
---
I can not comprehend how much clearer blizzard has to be for this threads to stop. 
---
Shout out to the mod who flaired this post 
---
ah okay, so a bit more bright?
---
The Alliance bridge is an insane choke point compared to the Horde's base. No such choke exists for the Horde.
---
There is the backdoor method to the Alliance base, but it's not necessarily easy to jump up there, nor does it leave you in a very advantageous location (you're surrounded by high level elites).
---
If it's necessary it's necessary, not much we can do about it really. I think "Blizzard polish" is more important to them than anything else. 
---
Nifty!
---
Hi, /u/dnpuntold
---
This is what people around here can't seem to grasp. I would have loved to see the original wow team build out all of those unfinished areas, but those people are long gone.
---
The people who would step in to help if they were ever to introduce any new content would likely be the same team that has been working on the last couple of expansions.
---
You won't even beat Naxx, so don't worry about it.
---
Yeah I thought about this one too.  That bridge is pretty commonly defended, but the horde have a choke point too going up to the frost wolf towers.  Granted the horde tower archers dont have very good LOS to the chokepoint. 
---
Hi buddy, dont think anyone has mentioned this, but I would get a desktop If I were you 
---
I'm currently raiding vanilla private servers on an ASUS ROG G75J laptop since 2014 and it works great.
---
The keyboard is great. The performance is great. Only takes some getting used to having a 17" screen.
---
Speak with our wallets. Don't buy game sub if the game isn't how you want it. 
---
OMG, now I so ashamed of myself. Holy crap
---
since the sub are the same for classic in retail there are 2 options. --
---
-blizzard has token in classic directly 
---
or
---
- players need to exchange their retail gold for classic gold, so classic players can buy their tokens in retail
---
either way they will be in classic
---
Orc, Rogue. Never ever had a Twink in Classic.
---
Was in a Hardcore Raid and the preparation for Rogues and other Melees in terms of Buffs is ridiculous.
---
Don't have the time for that again. Fell in love with healers during TBC, which is going to be my new main, Priest or Druid. Not so much preparation and I enjoy them more in BG.
---
Absolutely recommend Rogue, for everyone who has the time to farm all their shit, every week for Raids or want to be the King of WPvP. One of the best classes in Classic hands down.
---
For me it's just a huge time investment that I don't want to do again.
---
God I love vanilla wow
---
The best for leveling your mainweapons is to either store an insanely fast weapon you found in the world or buy some lvl 5 vendor item.
---
Leveling daggers you will want to have a 1.3 dagger and leveling swords you will want 1.6 to 1.9 swords/maces/axes. 
---
If you realize you found some nice mace at lvl 40 you proceed to level. You need 10minutes missig mobs to catch up on your new weapons higher points. Only 149/150 or 299/300 will take some time but it has nearly no effect on gameplay and its a waste of time to level the last points specifically in the world
---
You'll never get anything labeled as a gaming laptop for that price, unless it's used and then I wouldn't trust it.
---
Something like this would run it, but don't expect anything fantastic;
---
https://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=1TS-000D-02366&amp;ignorebbr=1
---
If you do go with a weak laptop make sure you trim the OS fat off with a version of Win10 LTSB or Win10 Lite, Win7 is good too if you have it.  Keep it lean by avoiding background processes like Steam autoupdate &amp; startup crap.  Peoples computers are usually functioning at a fraction of their power because of all the junk they have running in the background.
---
&gt;I’m talking about the general population of players.
---
People here are talking about a game six months before it's even been released. That's not the general population, that's hardcore enthusiasts. Last survey I looked at it was what...70% of people here are private server players? People who in many cases been playign for _years_ a game that's ~14 years old?
---
People and opinions in this sub are probably not representative of the average person who will be playing Classic.
---
I know and if I was still a kid I would get one. But the truth is I'm older now and have a heavy work schedule. I'm not looking to be the next great raider or pvp King. Just looking to mess around for a couple of hours here and there. 
---
You can get to the GY without aggroing any elites. 
---
/r/suggestalaptop
---
Yeah, I’ve wondered what Blizz will do about this (if anything). There are clear imbalances in this battleground that are really a bummer. The safest bet would be to leave it the same to avoid the floodgates of nochanges but at the same time, it would be nice if this battleground was on even footing. Even if they just changed the horde towers so it’s easier to be hit, I think that would make a world of difference in terms of competitive balance reflected in win rates.
---
Only a new hunter would try to tank like that tho. Turn off growl and use distracting shot, then kite and turn off pet attack if it gets too much threat. 
---
Besides, a hunter can kite an elite to death even without their pet.
---
Thanks 
---
According to the 1.12 numbers you need to beat 94% of the competition on your server for several weeks straight to be able to reach rank 10.
---
With 1000 players in the pool that means you need to score in the top 60 every week. You need 40000 RP for rank 10. So if you score exactly on place 59/1000 every week you will gain a little more then 8000 RP every week (depending on the competition). Lets say you gain 8001 RP every week. This is the minimum to beat the 20% weekly decay to be able to reach rank 10.
---
Under these circumstances you need 41 weeks to rank from 0 to 10.
---
If youre scoring better you will reach rank 10 a lot faster. If youre #1 on your server (1/1000 in this case) you will gain 13000 RP every week. Now you only need 5 weeks to rank from 0 to 10 and 7 more weeks to rank from 10 to 14.
---
Nah. Please don't change anything. The map includes things like cavalry and bosses for a reason.
---
I have experienced the IBGY choke on live; does that contain changes from Classic? 
---
At this point it's too late to change anything.  There are lots of BG's, and going back to rebalance one of them is simply not a priority.  They did rebalance it in TBC, when they introduced the reinforcement system that keeps the game from turtling for too long.  I know they made some changes to how the NPC's worked etc....  but really there's no reason for them to go back and change anything.  Honestly I wouldnt want them to change it, even though I mostly play horde these days.  If I keep getting wrecked in BG's on my horde character, I'll switch to ally and queue for a couple AV's to make me feel better.
---
No, you could always just charge right up there no problem.  
---
Is wowhead filled with malware?
---
By the time you get all of those pieces the BC revamp will launch. 
---
Yeah instead of some constructive criticism of mine, or even share your idea with us, offend me. /applaud   You dont know nothing Jon Snow
---
I suspected this might be the case.  What I'm probably remembering is that in the process of many players trying to cap stormpike GY, it was very common for an errant tab/attack or AOE to accidentally agro an elite NPC and then you had to dedicate to kill them otherwise they would wipe you.  This is much less likely in the push for Frostwolf GY due to the physical location of the NPCs.
---
Depends on the elite, and sometimes not unless you cleared the area and had some serious time on your hands. There were times when the respawns surrounding the elite came back while you were still kiting.
---
Don’t get me wrong hunter and mage are great solo but vanilla still made it require skill
---
I'm not calling for change, did you even read the first 2 sentences?
---
&gt;What do you mean by this? Patchwerk is a gear check and not supposed to be mechanically intensive as a boss. It's a boss that tests if your raid has good enough gear to proceed past it.
---
Because the original poster was talking about tuning, which is about meeting the dps (or healing) checks in any given fight. Patchwerk bosses are entirely about tuning because they have very limited to no mechanics to deal with aside from a berserk timer.
---
Patchwerk is a very easy boss in Naxx these days because people play far more optimally. Anyone who killed bosses like mythic Butcher/Guarm/Krosus will pull far above their required weight for Patchwerk. The tuning on retail bosses has become far tighter than what it was in Vanilla, maybe excluding C'Thun.
---
&gt;Are you saying that in retail gear check bosses are harder because it's harder to gear your raid? 
---
No I'm saying that gear check bosses are balanced around closer to optimal performance. I would estimate that the heroic versions are similar to Naxx in terms of tuning (where people need to know their class but really min/maxing throughput isn't required to down the boss).
---
If your guild implodes around Naxx and you lose half your core then you'll likely be set back to AQ/BWL to get through later bosses, however with the amount of raids and gear available by the time Naxx hits it's not hard to gear a few new players up with normal retention/churn. 
---
I min max. I get server firsts. I’m done arguing with an apparent wall who can’t seem to understand that I’ve literally seen people in pservers that have never played vanilla and didn’t have their experience ruined. They played how they wanted because they had their own guild. Tbh they were the friendliest people on the server. You have your opinion. I have mine. But don’t tell me you need players like me when you have never played with me. You don’t even know me or my playstyle.

Say NO to cross server bgs. If you want instant queues, play retail.

Vanilla is about the community, any type of cross-server function immediately removes community from the game.
---
For the horde 
---
Damn! Who's cutting onions in this thread!? 
---
I did. But you're complaining about balance, which has the implicit desire for a change. I *really* enjoy the meatgrinder bridge fights, and I'd miss it if they were gone. I played Horde in vanilla retail, too, so winning isn't even that much of a priority for me. In a game that won't change at all through its lifespan, entertainment is more important than in-game reward.

On a pserver they kidnapped a raids MT and brought him from Searing Gorge BRM entrance all the way to Menethil harbor.

Sorry read through the comments previously. Was meant as a joke

At the end of vanilla, not the entire time.

---
A big ass staircase leading to The Arcatraz. Lmfao
---
They don’t think it be like it is, but it do
---
1.12 was at the end of vanilla too, and that is what we are getting
---
Vanilla Naxx was hard. There are a few fights that do hold up to current raid design. But only 5-6 of the bosses were on the level of current raid design, and none near the difficulty of the hardest fights in the game (Yogg 0, Heroic Rag, mythic Kil'Jaeden, ect). In terms of encounter design C'thun also certainly holds up as well.
---
Though there is also 2-3 fights that were hard for different reasons which we don't see in current design. Sapphiron for the frost resist (which gimped you just to survive), Razuvious for needing one specific class ability/engineering tool to not backfire, and Four Horsemen for being a gear check JUST for the tanks.
---
You _can_ if you know exactly where to go and don't have any &lt;60s with you (remember, AV is 51-60). It doesn't really ever happen in practice with any more than maybe a group of five.
---
I was just killing some boars one day and had my back turned to the Horde patrol. Let’s just say that was not a good idea.
---
Officially there is no plan yet. In a recent Interview with ComputerBild (German Magazine) they have stated that all their focus, right now, is on making the classic experience as good as possible.
---
My guess is that classic will remain classic forever. There may be TBC instances spawning afterwards with the option to COPY your character to the TBC realm. But as someone else said, it's nothing more than a guess/wish and we'll simply have to wait and see how classic turns out.
---
Honest thoughts though: Classic will be fine and fun but quite frankly the game is kind of dying - so is Blizzard in itself - and I don't think we'll see anything else except Classic.
---
Never understood why people like AV. Not shitting on you if you do, I just hate the place myself. I get my rep and never return as a horse player.
---
It's an imbalanced zergfest that leaves no real room to actually play th game. If you as a melee run into the other Zerg you get oneshotted and die. As a ranged you're just trying to get some spells off and pick off any people who overextend. Hardly fun gameplay in my eyes.
---
And apart from the things mentioned in the OP, alliance starting point is further into the BG so they even get to the middle faster than horde. You also have a LOS place to hide right before you caps hordes last two towers in the base, whereas horde has to run over the bridge and into alliances towers taking barrages of arrows while doing so. Everything about the BG is alliance favored which makes it terrible in my eyes since the Zerg vs Zerg playstyle isn't any fun to begin with.
---
They moved hordes starting point further back sometime in vanilla and made it so you don't dismount riding through the horde base as you used to. After these changes winning AV became very rare as horde.
---
I'm so glad to have people like you to interpret my implicit desires. Your clairvoyance must be of great use in the toils of your day to day life.  
---
Only way to avoid a losing streak and turtle is to do a premade of 10+ AV as horde is just cancer.
---
I also hope they take herbs and ore out of AV since like5-10 people in every game is just running around collecting herbs. (Yeah that’ll be me)
---
Fair enough, but I don't really agree with that last part of your post. I've heard of people going for 5-6 months without weapon upgrades because they just never dropped during raids or someone else got the item and it didn't drop again for months.
---
Even when I was personally playing in MC or Onyxia pugs people were offering gold 2-3 times the price of an epic mount for certain weapons because they were so highly sought after if they ever dropped.
---
Even if a Naxx guild has to go back to BWL or AQ to gear up new people it might take quite a long time, maybe even a couple of months to get a couple of people into decent gear. 
---
It all depends on RNG so I wouldn't say it's easy just because the gear is available.
---
Someone will have a rude awakening when they try to roll their Gnome Priest in classic
---
Yeah most people like myself aren’t going to rush to 60 and immediately gear up for raiding or prep for the Rank 12 PvP grind. There’s people who want to do that, good for them, hope they have fun with that. That’s the beauty of Classic, like you said, in that there’s never going to be any more expansions that make your raid or PvP gear obsolete relics. 
---
Since I plan on making characters from both factions and every class, try more PvP than I did when Vanilla was fresh in my mind over a decade ago, and collect rare mounts and max out every profession, I could be perfectly happy with just Classic for at least a couple years or more. 
---
Then get out the sub reddit for classic wow?
---
Those games have some of the worst matchmaking in existence.
---
&gt;I've heard of people going for 5-6 months without weapon upgrades because they just never dropped during raids or someone else got the item and it didn't drop again for months.
---
See this is more of a thing when it's just Ony/MC or even into BWL where there are a lot more limited options particularly for some weapon types (Hi Vis'kag/CTS). However AQ gives a few more options and then there's a lot of high ilvl loot in Naxx. So if your guild is into Naxx and speed clearing AQ/MC (probably leaving BWL to pug or w/e), you see far more loot than what you would when it's early Vanilla and there's 10+ melee looking for the 5% drop off Onyxia.
---
&gt;Even when I was personally playing in MC or Onyxia pugs a year or so ago people were offering gold 2-3 times the price of an epic mount for certain weapons because they were so highly sought after if they ever dropped.
---
Odds are that people in those pugs didn't have access to higher bosses so they are effectively stuck in early Vanilla in terms of weapon drops.
---
&gt;Even if a Naxx guild has to go back to BWL or AQ to gear up new people it might take quite a long time, maybe even a couple of months to get a couple of people into decent gear.
---
It does not take months to get a few people geared once Naxx is out. You smash through content with a good guild when you are that geared so there is a lot of gear dropping. Now a lot of it won't be BiS but there are a ton of pieces that are huge upgrades and certainly let people pull their own.
---
Your core raiders in this scenario will likely have a lot of the pieces already so everything outside of BiS/really strong pieces gets funnelled onto the new guys.
---
It does take a long time to gear up a guild, particularly in early Vanilla, however assuming you have a decent core then once it gets geared you can gear up recruits/new players quite quickly. Weapons/Rings/Trinkets might be the exception as there are limited sources depending on the patch/tier, but it's nowhere near as bad as that early "everyone wants Vis'kag" stage.
---
Basically. 😂
---
Cross realm was a feature of vanilla, therefore crossrealm is part of vanilla. "go play retail" is the dumbest suggestion of all time.
---
Yep, agreed 100%. I will completely ignore my teammates and pretend they're bots in bgs then probably get bored and quit just like in retail.
---
"but my queue times!"
---
Essentially the same excuse used for having to manually form groups/spam LFG chat for a dungeon. Too hard, takes too long, I need my 1 button queueing. Why is that not wanted, yet cross-server bgs is ok? Makes no sense.
---
Cross server is NOT vanilla WoW. KEEP CROSS SERVER OUT.
---
yeah from n o s t 
---
I'm confused about why you're upset.
---
The first time I heard that roar was because he was right behind me and as I turned my camera, I was body pulling him and I nearly jumped out of my chair haha 
---
Cross realm bgs should simply NEVER be added. They were the start of making wow not a MMO and completely destroying the community.
---
If people want cross-server instant queue bgs(btw they're like 10m queues on horde on retail for 5 years now so lol?) they can go play retail.
---
Leave all cross server shit out of this game, it's anti-mmo.
---
Also this is the same image that's been upvoted to the top nearly every week, with wording changed a little.
---
Being an aspiring warrior tank, I suppose I should be ready for splash of lights all over my face 
---
( ͡º˵◞͜ʖ◟ ͡º˵) 
---
Of course you clear content fast when you're in a good guild, most decent guilds can clear all of MC + Onyxia + ZG + BWL in a single day.
---
But you're not going to go into Naxxramas with a MC weapon, right? You need something a bit better than that, so just because there's a lot of content to do doesn't mean that you can grab any weapon you want from any raid and you're set for Naxxramas.
---
The only reason why people do stuff like MC once BWL / AQ are out is because of Thunderfury.
---
You also have to consider the fact that most people in the raid won't have motivation to go back into tier 1 raids once your guild is in BWL or AQ just for 1 item or to gear a couple of players.
---
From personal experience, when I was playing WotLK a few months ago I was supposed to get the second legenady healing mace in our guild but since TogC was out and ICC was about to come out the guild / raid leader wasn't going to force 24 people to clear Ulduar every week just so a healer can get 1 item when nobody else needed any upgrades from there.
---
Same thing in vanilla WoW, your T2 geared raid isn't going to want to clear early raids just to gear some new people and no one is going to have motivation to do that if we're talking about a serious raiding guild.
---
If your guild is already in Naxxramas chances are you want people who are already BWL or AQ geared and probably won't be recruiting people who are in MC gear.
---
I'm upset about why you're confused.
---
It was a feature at the end of vanilla, when they started to make bad decisions.
---
You can't pick and choose what cross server functions are ok, ALL of them are bad and none belong in a true MMO experience.
---
If you want cross-server gameplay of playing with and against npcs, go play retail.
---
Ha. As i typed google i wondered about that but was too lazy to put any more thought into it.
---
Lol what's your issue
---
Hmm idk.. I see some sides advocating for new content, or also they could add TBC and then wrath. Honestly they’d be stupid not to, seeing the huge demand for “Original wow” I know Wrath was the dying point for WoW but there’s still that MMO aspect of the game compared to BFA.
---
&gt;But you're not going to go into Naxxramas with a MC weapon, right?
---
I mean you'd certainly pull your weight still with a Vis'kag or even a Perd Blade.
---
&gt;You need something a bit better than that, so just because there's a lot of content to do doesn't mean that you can grab any weapon you want from any raid and you're set for Naxxramas.
---
Except as I just covered, the tuning for Naxx is not particularly punishing in terms of throughput required. You don't need every single melee to be running CTS/AQR to be able to kill bosses and have those players be useful.
---
A lot of people have the idea that if something isn't BiS for the patch then it's garbage, which is not at all correct. 
---
&gt;The only reason why people do stuff like MC once BWL / AQ are out is because of Thunderfury.
---
Band of Accuria tends to never get disenchanted either, even deep into Vanilla.
---
&gt;From personal experience, when I was playing WotLK a few months ago I was supposed to get the second legenady healing mace in our guild but since TogC was out and ICC was about to come out the guild / raid leader wasn't going to force 24 people to clear Ulduar every week just so a healer can get 1 item when nobody else needed any upgrades from there.
---
Except a ton of guilds do clear MC for the duration of Vanilla?
---
One of the biggest differences here is that getting a tank TF lets everyone in the raid do more damage.
---
&gt;Same thing in vanilla WoW, your T2 geared raid isn't going to want to clear early raids just to gear some new people and no one is going to have motivation to do that if we're talking about a serious raiding guild.
---
Farm nights are a thing? This is why good vanilla guilds focus on being efficient, so they can plough through the farm content and get drops for those who need it. As I said BWL does tend to get left off once Naxx drops, but that's about it.
---
&gt;If your guild is already in Naxxramas chances are you want people who are already BWL or AQ geared and probably won't be recruiting people who are in MC gear.
---
In which case they don't need gearing up? I don't really understand your scenario here.
---
Not in this case lol.  Im just starting to dive in to classic info.  Just hoping for a great launch.
---
is it worth going for both dagger and belt?
---
It happened in every single random MC run back in vanilla.
---
Funny, I thought the opposite was true:
---
 A stealthed horde player can sneak and take an alliance tower more easily then an alliance player trying to cap the flag in that small room.
---
 You have to run through that winding town and a small entryway to get into the horde base. Lots of people talk about the bridge - but what about the Horde's gate? Thats a MUCH better choke point.
---
The final towers on either side are MUCH more defensible than the alliances final 2 towers. 
---
You can simply run by SHGY as a horde and pull all the guards giving the horde a HUGE early advantage. 
---
that is quite interesting, do you have a link to the theorycrafting doc or information?
---
I didn't think about that tbh, because i always run dungeons with guildmates and voicechat. Even throughout the last years i very rarely played with unknown randoms..
---
And you are totally right, that everybody would be encouraged to roll for their friends aswell. That would be totally fucked up.
---
Yeah.  It was braindead monkey design.
---
I know!  One open to archers while the other isn’t!  Long bridge with giant pit beneath for one side!
---
Not Blizzards shining moment.
---
You have never played classic, where a boss drops 2 items for 40men and 1/2 of all items were bullshit, so that everyone raged when the right item dropped.
---
No

Horde towers are much easier to cap due to the LOS issues I outlined in the post.  Again, I've played both factions extensively and it's not even up for debate.   As horde you must kill an archer before you can cap, as ally you don't have to.  Regardless of which faction you have to run through archers to get to the flag.  
---
Roll a horde character, and see for yourself.

"in pvp"

Even the guards are gone. :'(

I've been playing vanilla, and only vanilla, for the last 4+ years. If you can't see the merit in this suggestion then idk what to tell you. Ignoring the possible benefits of this on very unbalanced servers is nothing short of stupidity.
---
Some people really have a tough time grasping this no change thing.
---
&gt; I mean you'd certainly pull your weight still with a Vis'kag or even a Perd Blade.
---
Okay, so now you are saying that certain loot in MC is so good that it carries you to much later raid content after saying that the only reason people pay high prices for them is because they can't get anywhere past pugging that content.
---
If you read your own comment here it's pretty clear that the reason why people pay so much gold for these items is because they are good and like I said, highly sought after. And like I said, some people still go several months without these items.
---
I've heard a streamer say that their guild was clearing MC + Onyxia + BWL + ZG every week for 6 months and he didn't get a weapon upgrade because none of the good melee 2 handers dropped during that time, so my comment wasn't pulled out of my ass when I said that.
---
I'm not really looking to argue about different things regarding Naxxramas etc, I'm just pointing out that in vanilla it takes a long time to gear players and it's not always super easy because it depends on RNG. You can gear someone in 2-3 weeks or it can take months, that's just a fact that I've personally witnessed.
---
This would be fair if you took pics of thunderbluff or darnassus 
---
Well, the reason why I was being curt, was because the toxicity that was out there previously when private servers were being questioned was really severe.  To this day I still have my own fan club.  It's water off my back and most of them aren't worth my time so I said as little as possible.
---
Seeing all this gives private servers a bad reputation.  A really bad one.  If you disagree, disagree.  But don't go on a swearing rampage and act like a child.
---
It all started when I said private servers weren't the Vanilla experience.  Even if 1.12 was done correctly on pservers, it still wouldn't be the Vanilla experience.  1.12 was one patch.  My experience was raiding from 1.1.  That also is not the Vanilla experience.  If given a frankenpatch, most likely a happy medium would need to be found.  Well, a vocal minority of pserver players lost their lids.  And frankly, they need to stay away from Classic.
---
Case and point.  "In Vanilla, mages specced arcane power and greens for pre MC BiS".  Uhm.  No we didn't.  Not even close.  Mana management used to be a thing.  Want to speak for pservers and 1.12?  That's a much stronger case.  But not, "Vanilla".
---
Anyway, cheers.
---
&gt;WoW tokens should only add game time to the retail servers.
---
Nah. The only thing they can do is not allow trading between the two versions.  
---
What? Why?
---
I can't be subbed here unless I have unfallable reverence for ion and blizzard or what?
---
I am here because I am looking forward to classic, same as everyone else. I just don't trust everything blizzard says.
---
Yeah, this is nothing more than wishful thinking anyway. Classic should and will stay at 1.12. It wouldn’t be the same if new patches like a 1.13 were added. 
---
I don't get it
---
They’re the only bosses in the tier that you “need” hunters for tranq shot. You don’t need tranq shots on KT, Patchwwerk or 4HM. 
---
Painfully true.  I remember doing BGs back in the day where I felt I was middle of the road or slightly above average and playing frost mages.
---
If I could force out a blink, I could outburst them and win.  But there was this one frost mage.  I was chasing and chasing and trying to force that blink so I could charge.  I was literally the kid chasing the Ice (spec) cream man and he wasn’t open for business.
---
Every pleb mage I had been fighting before would have absolutely been impatient and used their blink.  But this guy just wouldn’t.  He held on with the grip of a post mortem corpse in the snowy Borean Tundra.
---
Ended up having to say screw it and charge because I was being kited worse than a Ben Franklin discovery of electricity.  So I charge and the second, the moment, the INSTANT I charge, he blinks and then kills me.
---
Well played mage... well played.

Yea iron forge was never this populated in vanilla, would have crashed the game back then if it was

I'm not a strict no change person but let me make a flow chart to help if you think the change is good for them.
---
Is it a change?
---
No? - Good!
---
Yes? - Bad!
---
Player 1 gives gold to Player 2 in classic.
---
Player 2 gives gold to Player 1 in retail.
---
Player 1 buys token on retail.
---
Player 1 has bought game time on classic with classic gold.
---
No need
---
I used to head in with several rogues and we'd all time our ambush and gank the tank of the opposing faction, wipe them, and then secure the world dragon for our raid.  The best of times.
---
Yea I figure at that point though your hunters are core members of your raid team, if your guild really drops 1 hunter after 6+ months of raiding just cause they don't need your tranq and can get some more dps out of another class that's a pretty lame ass guild. 
---
I’m firmly in the no changes camp for Classic and TBC (if an official server like that ever happens) but one of the only things I disliked about Wrath was the Dungeon Finder.If it were up to me, the one and only change I would make to a potential Wrath server is I would never have added the Dungeon Finder. I highly doubt many people would be opposed to that being removed, and nothing else would be altered. 
---
Why not try to make the game as best as it could be I'm not talking about changing a lot of balancing or whatever. Surely you can't be for leaving game breaking bugs in the game? I don't see the point of the extreme no changes stance just seem to miss the point of classic.
---
Blizz did a great job with token on retail.
---
They just wont affect classic cause it will only affect gold in retail so yes some ppl will probably farm in retail to purchase time in classic but to perform this you have to play like a no life. So the effect on classic will be 0, however the price of the token will probably be inscreased for retail.
---
The only issue is regarding Blizz strategy to make classic more profitable...
---
Nah the no change crowd is too rabid to listen to any reason.
---
I don't think there is anything to worry about.  Do people not remember how much gold buying and selling went on during vanilla?  It was rampant - and the economy didn't fall apart.
---
Yeah, occasionally. Occasionally so can self heal from bloodthirst. It evens out. So again, in 1v1s, arms and fury are pretty equal vs anything but healers, where arms have it slightly better.
---
Can't use reckoning bomb in classic, that's also not pvp just a dps meter skewed by training dummy+exploits.
---
While I agree with all you wrote about alliance advantages, I played a horde warlock in retail and we won most AVs. (75%-25%)     On our server (Maelstrom EU )  the Horde was considered to be slightly better at PVP, and the Alliance better at PVE.       Maybe that was the design idea behind this giving the alliances some terrain advantages?
---
I don;t know if the horde advantage was about skilled pvp players in general choosing horde races , or about any horde race pvp ability advantages...   Any thoughts on that? 
---
It was the same in AB and WSG,  pug on pug Horde won more.  
---
You’ll have to keep it plugged in all the time. 
---
Mechanically the encounters aren't difficult.  You don't have to position as precisely in later raids, you don't have to keep track of as many moving parts or transitions.  The encounters are straight forward.
---
Mathematically the encounters are difficult and you can't bring 25 moonkin, ret, shadow contrarians to a raid or it will fail.
---
Do you see the difference now?
---
That was fixed by 1.12, if not earlier.
---
Sadly, those abilities were probably pruned...
---
Maybe in TBC? 
---
Nah,  Balinda was definitely easier to kill with a hand full of players. 
---
I think ultimately the ally bridge was the biggest advantage. A couple of allies can successfully stay behind and defend at the bridge with the help of the NPC archers sniping you out. Then throw in the Elite NPC pathing in relation to the towers and its poop. 
---
I guess my biggest issue after playing hundreds of played days in AV is the PUG factor. Pugs won't ever bypass stuff because either they do not understand the best path or they wanna pvp. So they will end up fighting on the those direct linear paths. The problem is there are 3 or 4 potential choke points in the ally favor because of how the maps were geographically designed. 
---
Everything you said about the unbalance is true. The reason it was so popular among some people (myself included), is just the fact that it was a colossal, zone-wide war and the only such of its kind. Especially before they started removing NPCs. The imbalances took away some of the fun, but damn if it wasn’t a cool idea.
---
Yea, works just like that.  
---
yea, people act as if gold will magically be generated as opposed to just traded  
---
Jebaited
---
exactly
---
Awesome. I’ve actually never really rolled rogue, I play pally/mage/druid. But yes, definitely viable (;
---
They are getting love.. from you, amirite?
---
i actually think this will be a problem from other games ive played.
---
a) for a longblost of obvious reasons being able to buy gold with a visa card is negative for vanilla wow. 
---
if wow token rmt's are using visa cards to buy potions and gear it makes the prices more expensive for people who want to just play the game.
---
Things like a mount beingba pain in the ass is very tempting for players when they know they can just spend real world money.
---
The main problem i see is blizzard are to cheap to hire game masters to try and fight gold sellers and ban bots. They want raid gear trading so they dont need staff to do that which i actuallybunderstand but makes me think its unlikley they will be wiling to disable the token and have staff there to ban gold sellers.
---
Blizzards solution to gold sellers was to sell gold themselves , so i thinknthere is a very good chance you will be able to buy and sell wow tokens in classic.
---
b) if you can buy wow tokens in vanilla retail players will play just because they will be cheaper than in retail wow. This will add what is essentially a large number of human bots just farming gold to pay for their retail game time. 
---
If a bunch of retail players are playing just for tokens , the prices of tokens will go up, people will be more tempted to buy wow tokens for gold then spend that on the auction house.
---
this is basic inflation cause by a system that has no business in vanilla wow.
---
c) ive thought about this quite a lot , unless blizzard thinks of some solution that does not let players buy gold off the cash shop i wont be playing classic. 
---
Vanilla wow is not balanced for blizzard sponsored RMT
---
Yea I get that. But that’s just how it was then. I remember it well, and I don’t think it’ll frustrate me, but I’ll definitely have to get used to it again.
---
Feel like I wrote this myself. Same encounter, same feelings. Good memories. 
---
I see and hope they implement no changes like that. What could happen is much later down the line, \*if\* they introduce new content, like new raids and/or dungeons, they could create better itemized gear for specs that underperform in raids, like ret pally and balance druid. But even that would require a ton of community feedback before implementation.
---
It will happen because from a business perspective it just makes sense.
---
As a frost mage, this is my favorite!
---
I can see where you’re coming from. If dungeon finder was taken out of wrath it’d be a trillion times better.
---
iirc nostalrius is, talking abouit "pservers" in general should also be allowed in context to Vanilla / Classic related stuff, i.e. something like "Pservers are generally overpopulated compared to Vanilla". Directly naming active pservers however is not allowed iirc. 
---
Actually, there is a choke point for Horde, it's just very far forward and I'm not sure how practical to use it is for classic:
---
The ramp going up by Iceblood Tower and Iceblood Graveyard.
---
Became much more famous after the objective for AV got changed and performing "scorched earth" became a viable strategy.
---
Well, it's not so much who is "allowed" to do it. We wouldn't let people come to C'Thun/Naxx progression nights as a PvP spec, for example. But in general, if someone is just as skilled and devoted as everyone else in the raid, and they genuinely just want to main a weird/off-meta spec, then we would give them a solid spot in our raid. This never really resulted in other people wanting to slack, it resulted in people wanting to flex meters so they didn't lose to the Ret Paladin, and ultimately having 1 Ret Paladin was fine for the utility it brings anyway, so it's not like it really hindered our comp noticeably. On the contrary, if 2 of our Fury Warriors show up in Arms spec doing half their normal DPS when we're trying to kill Patchwerk, and putting up MS debuffs randomly/overwriting other debuffs, then they're sort of just directly hindering everyone else's ability to play because they don't wanna pay a respec.
---
The thing is though, once you have Vanilla content on farm, there's absolutely room for some of your Fury Warriors to show up as Arms, and your Resto Shaman to raid in his 30 point Ele/21 point Resto PvP spec. None of the guilds I was in really had problems with too many people "slacking", and they were mostly pretty casual environments where we'd raid anywhere from 4-14~ hours a week depending on progression/what was out (clearing BWL/ZG/AQ/Naxx every week takes a while, but it was a fun grind with the right people)
---
This sorta went on too long but yeah, I get where you're coming from but I don't think it should be too big of a deal. If your guild is truly struggling because too many people are showing up in PvP specs/offspecs, then that's pretty much the GM/officers' responsibility to wrangle them in. In that situation it would be pretty obvious that people were just hindering you out of laziness anyway, and I can't see a guild "degressing" in Vanilla content.
---
This is the "friendly vanilla WoW community" I think
---
No it won’t fall apart but I don’t like the fact that WoW Tokens will have influence
---
No increased level cap, only horizontal progression, similar to what OSRS does.
---
C'thun absolutely had complex mechanics.  I say this as someone with AOTC on every raid in Legion.
---
Really love this BG as well. It’s the only reason I’ve stepped foot in vanilla private servers, and it’s the only reason I will play retail classic. The possibilities of the time it takes for a game to go on really makes it feel like the OG classic experience. Summoning IVUS, and the Horde Ice guy, and attempting to defeat raid bosses against a raid of the opposing faction. Ahhh it’s just the best thing ever in classic and I just can’t wait for it to come out on the upcoming retail servers. 
---
Immersion is built by presenting a believable world with rules and physics familiar to the player's real world experiences. Concessions are necessary for gameplay in a tab targeting based MMORPG: the existence of magic, bosses carrying gear around on them, bosses ignoring healers, a horse being summoned out of thin air. If such things are taken too far, however, the experience starts to feel like a lobby experience and not a real world. I found that AoE looting was a step too far. When I no longer had to rummage through the pocket of each corpse the fantasy and immersion were more damaged than they needed to be. That was apparently where my personal line was, where too many gamey convenience systems overwhelmed believability. 
---
I mean retail when there are a bunch of servers. Basically the overall group will be balanced, and in the case of private servers since there are so few they end up balanced. But when there are a lot of servers some will likely be super unbalanced, but the overall numbers will be balanced. Like offsetting 90/10 servers, one alliance overpopulated and one horde overpopulated.
---
Ironforge used to be the place to be in Vanilla WOW. 
---
I have very fond memories of AFKing under the Alliance Bridge, and behind the Horde boss hut.  Much honor gained, much Netflix watched.  Best BG ever I dare say.
---
Once I started botting though I never BG'd again.
---
Itsy funny how in Hearthstone this matchup is completely reversed. It's like Blizzard wanted to give warriors payback against frost mages
---
I know that on paper, and in places like the arena, the fact that horde (undead and orc) racials favor PvP situations is a factor.  However, I do not think that it is nearly as big a factor in 40 on 40 PvP.  I have noticed over my years of playing this game, and having unsubbed for 4 of those years, when you come back the dynamics in BG's are different.  There is often a predetermined outcome that most players have resigned to at the beginning of the game.  It is pretty clear to see this when you go away for 2 years, then come back and queue for the BG that your faction used to always win and then you get absolutely crushed.  
---
I resubbed last November and I haven't done a single BG since then, but when I played in WoD every single Isle of Conquest was won by the alliance very quickly.  During Cata it was just the opposite.  In Cata the horde won 9/10 times in battle for Gilneas, and when I returned in MOP we lost every time.  The group dynamic matters much more than the racial abilities/personal gameplay preferences of the players.  
---
If 40 people get queued into a BG that they always lose, a few are going to fight like hell but most will just flop over and want it to be done with.  If 40 people get queued into a BG they always win, they will go "balls to the wall" and enjoy the easy win (this of course makes them susceptible to being caught off guard by competent opposition).  There are cycles for sure.
---
If it's premade vs premade in AB or WSG, it will come down to which group has more serious PvPers, so racials and faction biases may come into play more then.  But in a PUG v PUG BG, the group dynamic is much more powerful than any racial ability.

Im sure eventually they will change some aspects of those classes. I hope they do. If they dont release TBC or new content then at least make meme specs playable for nax and such to switch it up. 
---
What game breaking bugs are you referring to?
---
I will embrace my shortcomings as elemental shaman in raids, will grind gear in raids and outside as resto, respec and blast people with my OPness in the world and BGs.
---
They totally wouldve nerfed the one-two-shots had they been viable in raids.
---
So I personally am happy to have a crappy raid class, so I am even more overpowered in other aspects of the game.
---
Nothing specific but my point is that it feels weird that the goal is to recreate vanilla good and bad instead of recreating all the good parts and maybe fix the bad ones if there's an easy solution. 
---
Very few people will be investing enough time in both Retail and Classic to make this be a problem. It just won't be an issue, realistically. 
---
How is ash bringer better than mom?
---
If they ever give poll on what you want classic's future to be, vote for further development (if its option).  
---
Thats about it.  
---
For ppl wondering, the above list seems to be US only.
---
Yeah the only thing that will affect the load times would be NoScript. According to that extension, WoWhead attempts to load something like 25 external scripts on every page, which is absolute insanity. Shady porn site levels of Javascript. 
---
Interesting choices and niche stats, unique Gear effects and clever spec choices in the talent systems. So many things Blizzard deemed "clutter" in both the Diablo universe and the Warcraft one. We live in a world of instant graduation now and even though I know a lot of people want to return to the past ways there are too many new gamers and they all like simplicity and accessibility so it's an uphill battle. Here's hoping classic reignites that spark
---
Wait, if server merges happened in Vanilla, how did they handle duplicate names? Nowadays you have those name abominations, like Illidonger-Aegwyn and Cheesycrust-Tichondrius, but who had to namechange back then?
---
Yes it blocks ads nicely but thw problem with WoWHead isn't the ads, it's all the external Javascript that the site loads, which pihole doesn't touch. 
---
Fun to play?  The attitude on hybrids is so delusional in this sub. A ret paladin presses about 2 buttons every 8 seconds and just stands there auto attacking the rest of the time. 
---
Not really, because it goes against the vanilla philosophy of "hybrid tax". 
---
They did perform some adjustments over the time but the whole idea did not change until TBC, when a rework was kind of required in relation to a massive amount of upcoming changes and new stuff.
---
Havnt tried ret-paly in MC/BWL I say dont do it. Its boring af. Its basically auto-hit-simulator.
---
Cool story bro, thanks for sharing
---
Sure you do.
---
It was cool because you could be losing the war UNTIL - you and a small group of people someone sneak up to Stormpike and cap the GY.  Alliance don't react in time and just enough Horde reinforcements arrive to solidify the Flag Cap.  More people flood to Stormpike and pretty soon the tide of the battle has turned and Horde eventually win.  All because one small crack squad succeeded at a high-risk mission.
---
AV is a battle of such epic scale that you have little side adventures going on all over the place.  It was both glorious and awful (when the game turtled for example).  I am not disagreeing with your dislike of AV, I understand it has many flaws, but the fleas come with the dog as they say.
---
More then you get from dungeon
---
You wont be in top tier guild if you can only raid log, so dont worry about it.
---
But, yes, stockpiling consumes or amassing a large bank while you have time will help in the leaner times.
---
Rarely wipes... not gonna happen! So hard to tell but including flask maybe 150g/night of multiple wipes, including consumes and repairs
---
I was speaking about dungeons, not raids. I am ok with loot trading in raids.
---
he'd literally die to three scortches
---
I like when wow did stuff like this this where some rando “??” Mob would walk around low level zones,especially in BC with the fel reavers dumbass walking around 
---
There are no Horde NPC archers shooting you at the front Gate.  There are serious LOS issues for the HORDE NPC archers when you come up the hill into the final area.  Choke points are irrelevant if you don't have adequate forces to defend the choke point....and the alliance archers on the bridge provide a huge baseline force that makes it much much easier to defend.
---
You're looking for burning crusade. 
---
&gt; Then get out the sub reddit for classic wow?
---
Judge, jury and executioner?   
---
You're not the arbiter of 'what all fans should believe', ya know.    
---
Fallacious "us vs them" black &amp; white thinking, without any gray areas, is harmful on the whole.
---
Do you even play WoW? 
---
Thats not how the token works at all. You can't trade tokens from player to player. 
---
A player (lets say Player 1) can buy a token, he wil get the token (i think this token has a silver icon) and can put this token on the AH. You can't trade it from player to player. He can't set the price for the token, the game does this for you. The token AH is region wide.
---
Player 2 can buy a token on the AH, he will never know what player is selling it as its region wide and no player name is listed as seller. 
---
Once player 2 has bought the token he can use it for gametime or battle.net balance.
---
So no, can't get a situation where player 1 can give player 2 classic gold to buy a token for him on retail and transfer it. To get gametime on his account Player 2 always needs to have the gold himself on retail to be able to buy a token. 
---
So the only way WoW tokens wil "interfere" with Classic is that someone that plays both Classic and Retail can buy his own sub with gold if he has enough gold in retail each month. 
---
Now should Classic have stuff like race change / realm transfers for sale then you might see the situation that you also can buy these services if you have enough retail gold. 
---
However if ppl want to buy gametime with Classic gold that shouldn't be a problem. You can probably always find someone that wants to gift you WoW gametime trough battle.net for a sum of gold. 
---

&gt; Then you’ve not listened to Ion at all.

&gt; Nice.

From this forums own sidebar: [What we know so far](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow)   
---
**How much is it going to cost to play?**         
---
* Classic will require an active World of Warcraft subscription, which costs $15/€15/£10.         
---
* You are not required to own the latest expansion.       
---
* You will be able to pay for your subscription with WoW tokens purchased on Modern World of Warcraft. It is not clear whether or not you will be able to buy WoW tokens on Classic.           
---
Nah, frost resist gear has tons of stam.
---
No one expects the Classic Inquisition!
---
four scorches
---
Yeah - different sets of gear for different situations is something I'm looking forward to.  Good to see Pantheon is taking that direction.
---
Hoping for slight balance changes AFTER NAXX PATCH.  Mostly to make sure they just get the standalone game correct and so people can be happy with their game relatively untouched. Others have said even vanilla was in constant flux of changes, so it only feels appropriate do you have some balance tweaks. I posted this in another thread and I'll just link here:   
---
"Not only that but redoubt in general should be changed to how it works in TBC, where attack in general proc it.  Make consecration innate spell and help protadins with mana
---
   
---
In general they should just add a talent per hybrid DPS tree (near the end) that helps with Mana Regen. Talents in particular:   
---
Shamanistic focus - enh sham.   
---
Unrelenting storm - ele sham.  
---
Dreamstate - moonkin.   
---
Predatory instincts - feral.   
---
Sanctified judgment &amp; sanctified seals - ret.   
---
Careful aim / combat exp - hunter.   
---
Focused mind - spriest.   
---
Surge of light - holy priest.  
---
Overall they way they fixed hybrids in TBC makes a lot more sense, druid trees in particular. I'd hope if they do any changes, it's not anything new to the game in general. These talents were devised by the old crew and make sense to the build especially if added late in the tree."
---
The "no change" crowd already has accepted a ton of changes to their vanilla wow experience.
---
Yeah thats exactly how a paladin plays they have no other abilities, you’re sooo knowledgable. Why would someone play a paladin. /s
---
What he mentions has nothing to do with GPU. The modern game does a lot more calcalations per combat activity so 2 raids of 40 ppl aoeing in retail causes a lot more load on servers than 2 raids of 40 ppl aoeing eachother in Classic would. 
---
If modern WoW server can or can't do what they could do in 2010 isn't known unless you work on those servers yourself. As none of us probably has a clue of how many resources (memory / cpu e.t.c) are alloted to a VM / Container making up a shard. As normally one of the benefits of a virtual infrastructure is that you are very flexible and can very fast scale up and down the resources assigned to VM's  and / or containers.  
---
It really depends on whether you're progressing the content is on farm. 
---
During progression the costs can go as high as 400-500g per raid (assuming full consumes every attempt and 2x flasks). 
---
Assuming that the content is on farm and you're not minmaxing then it won't be a lot different from any other raid, 50-70g per run probably.
---
I think a frost mage switching to fire is gonna have a tough time doing anything, especially when the guy is practically immune to nova and snares.
---
You don’t trade the token. You trade gold for the token.
---
The frost mage still would have Ice Barrier and the warrior has horrid attack power. If the mage can juke shield bashes / pummels he should be okay. Fire Blast does a lot of base damage along with Arcane Explosion. I'd be really curious to test it out though.
---
Greetings fellow inhabitants of Azeroth, Wobblecogg Sprockett here to announce that Random Encounter is now recruiting new members prior to the release of WoW classic edition. We want to have a strong core of players ready to go on launch day of WoW Classic.  
---
Random Encounter is a guild for older/mature gamers. We have jobs, kids, spouses, and many other responsibilities other than World of Warcraft. We are laid back and are not too worried about being the biggest, OP, 1337, guild on the block. That does not mean we are not skilled at what we do though. We take our time seriously because many of us don't have a lot of it.  
---
We at Random Encounter do not look at age as a simple number. Your maturity and general interaction with the guild is what we are looking at. If you're a 16 year old with a mature demeanor and attitude you are more than welcome to join.  
---
We are currently working towards building a team to take on all of the content WoW Classic has to offer. We want to build a cohesive unit of casual yet skilled players. We hope to have all types of players including a competitive raiding group. When raiding does start we are going to plan for 2 nights a week for 3 to 4 hours. (This may be adjusted obviously) The main goal of the guild is going to be a community feeling where all types of players can come together and play without the fear of drama. My goal with any guild I have run has always been about not just being another chat channel, but being a place you can truly call home.  
---
Alliance or Horde?  
---
 FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Type of Server?
---
We will be playing on a RP server for a more relaxed atmosphere. I know this isn’t for everyone, but I have always enjoyed this type of server. I don’t usually RP myself but I do know quite a few people that do/have in the guilds I have run.  
---
What classes are you recruiting?  
---
 We are currently recruiting all classes.
---
Who are you Wobble?
---
I am a US Navy military veteran of 8 years and I am medically retired due to in service sustained injuries. I have been playing MMORPG’s since around 1997 with the launch of Ultima Online. Ever since then I have fell in love with the genre. I filled every type of role in a guild/clan from the lowliest recruit to the guild leader. My most recent endeavor as a leader came from leading a Free Company in FFXIV until a health problem forced me to take my leave from the game 2 years ago. I have a very extensive experience with Vanilla WoW and its raiding content. I was a member of a hardcore raiding guild during Vanilla on the Rexxar server with a guild called Oracle. We opened the Gates of AQ on our server and cleared C’Thun. We downed about 7 bosses in Nax before our guild leader took everything we had saved in the guild bank, and server transferred just before BC came out without informing us that they were going to do so. From then on I promised myself that I would run a guild the right way and never do something like that to anyone. With all of that said I am truly ready to lead this guild and provide an amazing place for people to log in every day and play WoW Classic.
---
If you are interested in joining please visit our website at [**https://randomencounter.enjin.com/**](https://randomencounter.enjin.com/) and follow the instructions there for how to apply.  The process is a bit in depth, but we only do this to ensure we have a good group of like minded folks. Thank you for your time and I hope to be hearing from some of you soon. Keep your feet on the ground.
---
Very Respectfully,

Wobblecogg Sprockett

PS If you would like to get in contact with me with any questions you can reply to this post, contact me on discord via hobbit#1603,on my blizzard account hypno44#1447, or via the message system on the guild website.
---
We haven't heard anything about Classic recently because BfA isn't doing well and they need this time to focus on the new raids. I believe we'll hear more about Classic 2 weeks or so into the new raid.
---
Wut
---
For my memory, the choke point for the Alliance was always at the front gate of the Horde fortress and/or the Keep entrance to more towers -- we would "hold off" more Alliance there than in any other location -- and hold them for hours.  It was easy if you died to decide which GY to rez from -- behind the Alliance at the door and/or inside the fort.  So many Alliance, if they got to our leader would rush inside, forgetting that some of us were just waiting to rez (timing is everything) and then rush inside and interrupt your fight with our leader with sheeps, nova's, fears, traps, and those pesky and timed saps / stuns / blinds on Alliance healers.
---
This was one of the best, BEST, BESTEST battlegrounds ever made, and yes, dammit, it played correctly IT TOOK TIME.  These rushes to the bosses, loss of calling out the cavalry, holding certain GY's, and charging / AOE'ing those towers took timing and a lot of team work.
---
It started to change as well, this lovely BG as more and more guilds got BWL gear, understood the strats, and would just mow down the competition as they headed for the victory.  I miss seeing the Alliance hidden among the bushes, just wanting to FISH and dancing for his life.  Some of those GY fights were the best fights.  I remember one fight where we (as Horde) were rezzing inside the fort, and rushing the Alliance at our towers -- and finally pushing them back.
---
If you finished an AV, you were tired, exhausted, thrilled, happy, and willing to go do it again tomorrow.  I do miss the weekend AV's -- and I absolutely hate the shortened version of the BG.
---
One of the best WoW memories ever. 
---
Well they fixed sit Critting from triggering talents. That was a decent bug fix. Unconfirmed reports of wall jumping being fixed (plz no). All previous bugs before 1.12 should have already been fixed. 
---
The demo they showed us had a bunch of new bugs but I don't know how reliable that info is considering it was a stand alone demo with features only for said demo. 
---
I'd like to have the experience as close to vanilla as possible and I can't remember any game breaking bugs besides some quests you had to abandon in order to complete. The rest is just fun bugs (wall jumping) and bad qol bugs (flightmaster with a warlock pet out sometimes desummoned the pet with no soul shard refund).
---
It used to be at least. I haven’t touched the place in years.
---
I wish we could have TBC without alliance Shammies and Horde Pallies.
---
I will be 2 options. Some servers will have normal progression from vanilla-&gt;TBC-&gt;WotLK-&gt;Cata-&gt;MoP-&gt;WoD-&gt;Legion-&gt;BfA for the #NoChange crowd. Others will get the other type of server with new original content in spirit of vanilla. And everyone will be happy
---
Probably, but I was a stupid kid who probably was like...  hey cool how did I do that
---
I love sapping in the docks. So funny.  
---
In cata (when lfr was released with dragon soul) it was common that you queue for lfr with 15+ ppl and you pay the others to give you the loot. Or you pay mates to roll for you, so that randoms had nearly no chance on receiving an item. That was an easy way to gear twinks.
---
My warlock would get a couple of dots off on an afk flying player that almost always killed them.  Fun stuff.  Not sure how I dealt with the fall damage back then, I don't think warlocks have any type of lev or slow fall.  I must have been an engineer back then....so long ago.
---
The ONLY people who say X class does crap damage in pvp are people confusing Raid memes with regular Classic gameplay.
---
ANY CLASS can be built to global another class unless the target class is tanky as hell. Pvp exists OUTSIDE of Raid buff scaling. Sure the best premades will buff up like mad but this still resides within the scaling limits of classes.
---
Any class built to dps will wreck you in pvp if you aren't prepared for it.
---
I laughed.   But I will still need roll any 1hand I see drop.  
---
Love,
---
Rogues 
---
Reckoning is a deep prot talent my dude 
---
You should stick with retail.
---
I think if the Mage reacted to this and swapped his style accordingly he would do OK. But imagine running into Mages with this gear set in a battleground and watch their confusion as spell after spell is resisted
---
IMO if they decide to go with "new content in the vanilla theme", I think they should backport the things from TBC that were ACTUALLY intended to be in Vanilla(certain class changes, a retooled Kara with equal but different statted gear to Naxx40, etc) before they ran out of time and moved them to TBC.  Then they should leave out all the TBC specific systems (flying for example and any content that required it).
---
Why do you even need consumables? Is your raid full of enhancement shaman retribution paladins and balance druids?
---
So you don’t want to play classic wow. Gotcha. You want a weird hybrid version that won’t exist. 
---
SF&amp;E is the only way to Pve though right?   
---
Just make it an ethereal teleporter thingy kinda like the goblin teleports or the portals in Acherus where it ports you up and down.
---
It really wouldn’t be anything like vanilla if these changes were made, and if they did change some things, they would end up changing more.
---
Summer is Coming!!!
---
Correct - TBC introductd some of the things that eventually killed the game, but the damage happened much later.  The exception was Flying, which you could argue had the immediate impact of killing WPvP.  All the other changes in TBC were great (or at least ok) at the time, but were magnified in later expansions and became more problematic.
---
Based on my memory, I would rank expansions TBC -&gt; WotLK -&gt; Vanilla.  If I were to go back and replay all 3 in a row, I might change that order to Vanilla -&gt; TBC -&gt; WotLK.
---
Your memes have no power here!
---
They can add in gear that sits between AQ40 and Naxx.  They could also add in gear that's equal to AQ40 and equal to Naxx in power/progression/ilvl, but with different stats/bonuses.
---
That it is brother! 👍
---
Thanks for linking this, never seen it!! Gives me some good ideas for my Warrior for classic. :)
---
That it is brother!! 👍
---
Lmao!
---
Why did I never think of this on my druid in vanilla this is sinister.
---
If you limit the best methods for gph, what’s left? Slower gph methods it would seem. 
---
Mage is too squishy for me to enjoy. Huntard all the way here!
---
Not soon enough 😩
---
That would be hilarious. I think after the second frostbolt and a nova all resisted the mage would just polymorph and run away LOL.
---
One thing I did think of though is that if the warrior is prot, the mage probably stands no chance. Shield Slam removing Ice Barrier would be essentially gg.
---
The reality: "Warrior gets close crits you for 4k youre dead."
---
Chill out there are minor differences ok find, just skip impr. enslave.......
---
You didn't even mention the solution "done by amateurs". 
---
Did you mean the dynamic spawn rates of mobs and resources that obliterated the RPG and PvE leveling experience the original Wow had? The total drowning of the market with Raid resources that was originally (as quoted by original Blizzard Wow designers) balanced against a very specific server population?
---
Did you mean the complete disaster 10k server populations are on the Classic Wow concept?
---
lol I hope you don't mean that. 10k servers exist for one reason only: To sustain the BG rotations at level cap because those servers ONLY EXIST FOR THE HARDCORES WHO RAID AND PVP AT 60. Private servers with a fraction of the server peak Raid just fine thank you. 10k private servers are pvp playgrounds ONLY. That is their only purpose for existing. They have nothing to do with emulating a real Classic Wow experience. It's ironic that the tout the "Blizz-like" concept moto after corrupting the Classic concept nearly as much as "fun" servers.
---
;)
---
Sure but a speed run could conceivably pull two of those at the time..what was what I actually wantrd to know. 
---
I DONT KNOW IF YOU ARE SERIOUS OR SARCASTIC PLEASE SEND HELP!
---
And warlocks get screwed, especially on the Horde side.  No threat reduction talents or skills.  No blessing of salvation (if you're Horde) and you will never get a Tranquil Air group unless you run with 8 shamans.  All the shamans are devoted to the melee groups for Windfury or healer groups for mana tide.  I suppose a raid leader could swap shamans into healer groups for mana tide, but I was never in a guild that did that.
---
I’m guilty of being impatient as-well...
---
I have literally done this to a ?? Rogue in STV before, he chased me for a very long time until I swam out in caster form, pretending I didn't have seal form, once we got below the point of no return I rooted him and seal formed away.
---
But how would you change the PvP system? Just saying you think it's unhealthy doesn't help at all. :(
---
Nor am I a noob teenager playing wow for a first time with too much time on my hands. Not to mention we ARE getting a weird hybrid version as it is. And stubornly ignoring problems and avoiding improvments a 15 year old game needs is just lazy and a bad business model....
---
Because those servers add dynamic spawn rates on mobs and resources to counter the FACT that game was not made for 10k players in the world. 
---
Those servers are NOT Blizz-like even though they say they are. Only the players who did not play the original Classic realize how far gone 10k servers are from the original game.
---
Most of you here are yelling "NO CHANGES" yet totally ignore how massively corrupted dynamic spawn tech servers are from the original Classic Wow.
---
Reducing Honor decay would be a good start. Maybe also increase a honor gain when playing full premade vs full premade
---
On a full Naxx clear with zero wipes I use the following as fury warrior as 3rd or 4th OT/dps

You are wrong. Some people, like me, can TOLERATE some changes that are nessesary, BUT, right now I am not sure if I will play Classic. I will for sure test it and level to 60, BUT, I will quit if sharding, loot trading or any other added features ruin my Vanilla experience.
---
Sort of? If you had a top speed mount, which wasn’t really common. 
---
If I was on an epic flight mount, and saw you doing that on a normal speed mount, then I’d do the mage blastwave + slow fall trick and blow you right off your mount.
---
If I saw you flying and wanted to PvP. I’d just follow you and wait for you to land. 
---
In addition, TBC added 4 wpvp objective areas. All of which were busy on the PvP server I was on at the time. Wpvp was very much alive in Hellfire, Nagrand, Terrokae and Zangarmarsh. 
---
So. Not really. It just made types of travel and bit more convenient. 
---
Yes they did. The game is build on 1.12. 
---
ENJOY! 1.12 is the best balance Classic had. Deal.
---
You are a good sport !! This is what real WoW is all about.  
---
Because stuff like this is a good idea that sounds fun on paper but more often than not when it ends up being more of a pain and an inconvenience than an interesting twist
---

I believe it's up to seeing how Blizzard responds to the success or lack thereof, of Classic Wow. Rumors already reveal that Blizzard has hired a more old school RPG manager from the Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077. If he is to head Blizzard more on the RPG side including Wow, then we may see consideration for more horizontal, world building style content in Blizzard RPG games.
---
It would be very easy to use existing assets to add more old world content keeping with the 1.12 lvl 60 content limits. It all hinges on success and whether or not Blizzard feels the PC RPG market is still worth investing in.
---
No! One of the things that ruined things for me as World of Warcraft progressed was that every class became good at anything. 
---
In Classic we had Warrior Tanks, Mage AoE, Druid Combat Ress etc. Each class was specialized at something that made them unique. 
---
I don’t want Druid’s to be viable Tanks, I don’t want Rogues to match Mages in AoE, I don’t want Shamans to be able to do anything as good as anyone else. 
---
Hybrid classes SHOULD be worse than every other class on each independent thing. The caveat is that they can be HYBRID and offer a bit of everything. 
---
Highly doubt they would make changes to weak spec. Your best bet would maybe be in a few years once content gets stale they would maybe poll changes like these. But who knows
---
Why is chess more popular than checkers? 
---
The original server blades were like weaker than a raspberry pi now.

Thanks for your post.
---
“I still had a blast and enjoyed every single moment.” 
---
I appreciate you reading.
---
UI improvements won't be a problem, have a look at [pfUI](https://gitlab.com/shagu/pfUI). It will have to be rewritten because of API changes but I'm sure they'll do it reasonably fast (or port [ElvUI](https://www.tukui.org/download.php?ui=elvui) if it's faster).
---
I won't comment on PvP because I don't have the knowledge.
---
As for the rest, a calendar would be really nice and guild banks would stop breaking the TOS because of account sharing.
---
I don't agree though on having more spawns for Black Lotus nor any other rare material because it affects the economy.
---
Even if they moved the spawns or change the timers it wouldn't do anything in the long run because people will found out all of them precisely after a while.
---
No changes. The only thing on your list I'd consider is DK's. WoW on release didn't have them, but gained them as part of a patch. This means there was a time when they didn't exist.
---
You know what killed WoW? Quality of life features. It has died a death of a thousand cuts. The fewer quality of life features, the better. Nearly every change you suggested requires community interaction.
---
Play retail if you want more quality of life features
---
Hell yeah I love classic podcasts. Definitely going to listen while I drive. 
---
&gt; Back in vanilla when most people knew very little, everyone was accepted
---
Wasn’t like this on my server.  My raiding guild was scrub tier, and we knew that you don’t spec arms, ret, shadow, balance or survival for raids.  This was mentioned in that MC Raiders song too, so I thought it was a widely held belief.
---
Hardcore private server players will dominate if they choose to. Nothing anyone can do about this. It simply goes with knowing a game so well.
---
As for guides: Take then with a grain of salt. Vanilla emulators guessed at a lot of real Classic mechanics. Blizzard has recently confirmed with the Nost team on how they didn't get everything right. Guides will likely be pretty dead on but there will be differences for sure.
---
Flying mount ? NOPE
---
Dungeon Finder? NOPE
---
Level 70 80 90 100 110 120? NOPE
---
Just expansions with content like NAXX ect ? YES 
---
Change my mind 
---
And not to diminish lad's effort or anything.
---
But half of this is not important, it's only to push through a percentage of boss health or to shave off a bit off the clear time.
---
All are IMPORTANT, but not necessary.
---
i did understood you wrong there, sorry for that. I do think this ultimately wont matter though. Classic gold is a lot harder to get a hold on and thus a lot more valuable than retail gold. I can't imagine any way where it would be more efficient to farm gold in Vanilla and trade that to someone that in turn will give you retail gold to buy a token opposed to farming the gold in retail yourself, which would be a lot faster. 
---
Great story!
---
That is somewhat true. Half of these consumables is mostly tryhard purpose in order to clear Naxx in one night. It should be noted that consumables are more important for tanks than any other class in Naxx.
---
I do not find ferals uncommon on private servers. There aren't many in a raid but they are common.
---
There would be same amount of BL spawns, there would be only more possible locations in each respective zone where they can spawn
---
Personally consider it clever use of game mechanics.
---
Thank you 👍
---
I'm not even in the no change crowd and these are stupid changes.
---
Don't forget "Tokens will share a market between Classic and Live, meaning anyone on classic can buy 1-200k gold for 20 bucks, and I can't imagine any other way they could implement this."
---
You're either trolling or full blown retarded. Nothing you say is true, stick to pservers with your toxicity, you've made baseless false claims about who I am and my playstyle simply because I called out your bs.
---
That's retarded, classic raiding is dumb af.
---
The Truth about ferals:
---
Most level as feral for obvious reasons. Most heal in raids for obvious reasons. Those that stick with feral through raiding are hardcore players willing to tryhard in order to be the best in their role.
---
MOST PLAYERS DO NOT TRIHARD ... and therefore have no future as a raiding feral and never did. On several servers and in several guilds I have see more instances of a shortage of viable raiding ferals than a surplus. It's because the reasons to not stay feral outweigh those willing to stick with it. 
---
If you want to raid as feral ... you've chosen to play the game in a way very, very few are willing to play.
---
I played Horde, longer than you I'd wager so I wouldn't even try that rout. Horde have it easier in AV, it was a joke that horde would win 14/15 games on my server. The archers are nothing man, did you even play vanilla? A single feral druid can cap a tower effortlessly. If a mage was defending a horde tower it was nearly impossible to cap alone. The horde also have much better GY placement. 
---
So true but loved the rock paper scissor system.
---
There is a huge difference between improving bad design and QoL for the lazy tho.
---
Not a popular opinion, but I agree on the PVP changes. People have literally died from no lifing video games before and I don't think things that require 18-36h binges to stay competitive, should be something that we promote.
---
Oh when the game was an actual mmorpg lol
---
The dungeon companion is really cool. It has strategies for all the AQ bosses but doesn’t have Naxx. There is brief info on Naxx in the Master Guide
---
Hey guys, hope you enjoy our little chat about life and classic WoW - technical side of things went pretty badly wrong on the processing end but the next episode will be all good ;)
---
Example?
---
Thanks a lot Jay! Drive safe, my dude x
---
Ninja rogue. Axes aren’t for you.
---
You shouldn't worry early on about consumables, let alone of Naxx variety.
---
No Guild will prepare for Naxx early on and control / focus people to farm Fire Resistance Potions, maybe Nature Res ones.
---
You'll get accustomed to the alchemical pooling when the guild progresses on and you'll likely never notice as most "Good" guilds will prioritise their elemental farming as a Guild activity.
---
It sounds manipulative, but when you're a part of the machine of alchemical machine you'll take it as just another Guild activity that might force you to slap arse with the opposing faction or compete with your peers.
---
At a point (most) guildies imagine themselves as a community that takes care of each other (consumable wise).
---
And you'll be a part of a smaller entity of the whole meth lab that creates the potions.
---
(Even then, only some are required if the group works as the boss mechanics dictate, the potions and elixirs only amplify that and enable people to recover from fuck-up [What every one does whatever their experience or preparation.])
---
NO change people are so pathetic, I hope they all get pissy and quit day 1 so the real players don't have to deal with their stupid snowflake bs.
---
True. Let's hope they don't give any tools what-so-ever, to let people change names or do realm transfers. Both of those should be prohibited for this to truly work out as you suggest I think.
---
Mister, mister. Your language hasn't been nice of late.
---
Lots of twinks
---
Play another game and hope it's still there when I get the urge to level another tune
---
My time in WoW Vanilla was often about some to go where they've seen the experience from sometime before.
---
Can we make a server without ret paladins since you want to change things? You are the reason most hardcore pvp players rolled Horde in real Vanilla. We got sick of the victim complex and incompetence.
---
If you read my whole comment, the why is in it... "Nearly every change you suggested requires community interaction."
---
Shortsighted? You literally have a version of WoW that has quality of life changes and people are dropping it. It is a literal example of what happens. Your suggestions are flagrantly shortsighted. You're expecting to repeat the same mistakes and yield a different result.
---
No changes will lead to a true classic experience. Those who don't want that have BFA which is full of Quality of Life changes.
---
Eu-pve-alliance

Warrior main tank looking to join a semi or hardcore raiding guild
---
I’ll be playing a warrior, most likely, so I don’t quite understand what you mean by “when I’m rich”.
---
Accumulate money and wait for the next expansion.
---
People bitch about area loot because it would make AOE mages lives easier but seem to forget about how many times a mob will run up the side of a mountain and die, leaving you with no loot. Oh, ya it's because these people never played Vanilla WoW.
---
Isn't there a horde patrol that fucks kids up?
---
Guy doesn't even know what the hell he is talking about LOL.
---
True.
---
For me it's not about the rig-gear back then, but about the design philosophy. That's what made the game for me. It's not the archaic graphics. I would be perfectly ok with more updated graphics for instance, that won't ruin my experience. It's the gameplay that matters.
---
Changes that enhance enjoyment of the game? Never! /s
---
Nothing.
---
Kiting warriors with rank 1 frost bolt for so long that they just give up trying to kill me.
---
Obviously nochange dogmatic cant tell the difference between calender and lfr.... nochange will kill wow, maybe blizzard will be smart and start a fresh server after every AQ opening
---
Good. Leave more room for actual improvements to the game so its more fun.
---
Don't listen to all these elitist dipshits. I've been using laptops for all my needs (including gaming) since 2004 (the real shitty days) and they work just fine. Just do your research and make sure you get something that fits your needs. 
---
Everyone is going to disagree with you because they never played Vanilla WoW and only have experience on shitty private servers they think is a 1 to 1 copy of Vanilla.
---
You will see people coming out of the woodwork to support any PvP change, including removal of DKs.
---
And have its value crash harder than an f1 driver? 
---
"It has zero consequence"
---
No it has consequences, you just don't see it. It make twinking easier (part of the challenge of twinking is getting all the items you want without levelling past the level). And  it allow rankers to twink at lvl 59 to get more honor (they had to nerf it on one pserver where they allowed xp off because people were getting higher rank far easier than lvl 60).
---
If you have played horde for longer than me, it wouldn't be by more than a few months - if you played since launch (weird flex but okay).  Since you started at the beginning, you'll remember that the horde entrance to AV used to be significantly further south than it is now.  That in itself is a huge disadvantage.  Please enlighten me on how horde graveyard placement  favors them significantly.  Also, I didn't say that the archers are difficult to kill - its merely a fact that you must kill one before you cap the flag.  Unlike the alliance which does not have to kill anything to cap.  Even if it takes you 5 seconds to deal with an archer, it's still an advantage for the player who has no archer to deal with.  
---
While some of your comments are a bit abrasive, I will say that this comment (among others) ring true to the negative effects of a dead server.
---
I was on the receiving end of a server that died and the AH sucked, no guilds recruiting, and no way to experience content.
---
With 40+ days having been played on that character, I wasn’t about to reroll on another server nor would I have wanted to pay even more on my subscription to move them from a situation I didn’t cause.
---
Easier to just walk away and play another game.  Which is why (finally my point) I agree that server merges will be necessary for the longevity of many would-be consistent subscriptions.
---
And the elites are usually higher level or close to it than everything else in the zone, so you might be there killing mobs your level or 1 or 2 less but the elites are 3 higher than you and those resists just fuck you right over.
---
Yeah, I keep going back and forth but I think I've settled on liking the idea of there being more content. I mean the potential is there. Original Karazhan, original Uldum, original Grim Batol. The Dragon Isles. Azshara Crater BG. I guess they could do something w/ Hyjal?
---
Kinda hard when everyone can just ride dragons.
---
I spent like 3 hours running around Stormwind. It was great. 
---
Same. 
---
Just in case you're not trolling, many of the few guilds that tried Naxx in 2006 have cleared several naxx bosses with close to no consumable. At least when not speaking about the ultimate hardest ones.
---
Don't take too seriously that kind of posts.
---
I think somebody did just draw [Thunderfury, Blessed blade of the Windseeker].
---
Yeah! I had a super similar experience, because Duskwood always seemed so cool but I couldn't go explore it without high level spiders eating me.
---
Area Loot? Absolutely not. It removes a lot of the extra risk from AoE Grinding. Head turning I don’t care about personally.
---
If that was in Darnassus, I hate that Darnassus doesn't get the love it deserves because the buildings and everything are super pretty. And the music is amazing.
---
Yeh, MC isn't the raid to compare difficulty with. 
---
Just like my last reply to you, I’ll add my 2 cents for impact again.  Server merging is currently the best way to balance factions while not stepping too heavily on the NOCHANGES zealots with QoL improvements.
---
2 buttons is still more than mage 
---
I live for this big endless zerg.
---
I really loved waiting in starting zones and handing out gold and bags to new players. 1g wasn’t a big deal to me but it was like a cheat code to new folks. Made me feel good. 
---
Ok tough guy
---
As he said, thats clearing and raiding in ONE night. It is tryhard but then again when you have it on farm you dont want to "waste" 3+ nights on slogging through trash and bosses when you can speed it up.
---
Dont forget that the more gear you have from naxx, the better you can farm. 
---
A warrior + shaman combo can farm 80-100g/hour in Naxxramas gear, so there is really no reason why you shouldnt farm for 1 1/2- 2hours and just buy the ingredients or flat out the potions.
---
Well a warrior and a shaman/healer can do Dire Maul East jump runs and farm A LOT of gold. Unless they change that in classic.
---
I really have tried to make ele viable for PvE but it's rough. 
---
It sucks that they don't have, in the elemental tree a talent that mages have called Master of the Elements. Like c'mon man. 
---
And max rank Lightning Bolt is super weak compared to max rank Frostbolt or Shadowbolt. :(
---
\^ Victim complex ret paladin who asks for buffs who thinks reality is online bullying.
---
So you got a few bosses in AQ and never did naxx. OK. 
---
Ret is great in PvP. There were many a GM ret paladin on my server and other servers.
---
I hope for this server scenario to happen.  I’d love to experience all of the content I missed when I started towards the latter part of BC.
---
Being able to have one version of the game as an option and then another that’s parallel and transitive, but not made easy to level in either, would be amazing!
---
Nobody gets hurt on either side unless leveling in BC was somehow much easier than in classic. (At least, to the lvl 60 mark.)
---
Looks like I need to find a healer or (if I go Horde), a shaman!
---
Blizzard talked about vanilla bugs. They want to fiz bugs but understand some bugs was part of the vanilla experience. So we dont know yet how they will do.
---
\^ Victim complex that didn't play any or barely any of the said hybrid classes and that doesn't want balance to change and to be challenged with his main pure DPS class #warrior #Mage #Rogue
---
and this is a Vanilla bug. So that's why I'm asking the community here:
---
Is this a kind of bug you'd be okay with the devs fixing in 1.12?
---
It’s weird, back when Classic was live, we raided around 25s hours per week, Sunday to Thursday every night, progress nights, banging our heads again bosses in AQ40 and Naxx
---
On private servers 2 nights per week was all that was required, there was no head banging against bosses but there was a lot more time spent farming consumables 
---
"Obviously nochange dogmatic" you obviously didn't come here to change your perspective by reading what you've said today.
---
"cant tell the difference between calender and lfr..." you didn't just post about a calendar did you? you wanted 5g respecs, a new honor system, and a litany of other changes with far reaching consequences.
---
"nochange will kill wow" you think wow is not dead right now?
---
"maybe blizzard will be smart" let me stop you right there. blizzard is dead. it was eaten from the inside by activision.
---
You've made no attempt to clarify your point, address my counterargument, and insult or strawman anyone with a different opinion than you. I will assume at this point that you are dug in. Enjoy playing your QoL version of WoW known as BFA.
---
Arcane Explosion would be a horrible choice in this situation. The Warrior can try to OOM you here as you're resorting to your weaker elements, and resistance gear like that comes with a lot of stamina.
---
The best choice is to just kite while using non-frost spells. Just use r1 frost spells to keep the Warrior at bay while relying primarily on Scorch/Fire Blast/Arcane Missiles.
---
&gt; As he said, thats clearing and raiding in ONE night. 
---
He didn't say that in that particular comment. He said that in another one, which can be confusing for new players. the guy above answered to the top comment.
---
But you are right for the rest.
---
No it’s not. Progression raiders were spending upwards of 20hours a week raiding.
---
There is no such thing as a "ret pala". Its a made up word. In Vanilla there are Paladins and paladins are one of the best or the best in all content both pvp and pve.
---
Do it be like that
---
trade it for gold on live and get blizzbux  
---
Having potentially 4 additional hits (which happens very often when in a big fight in BG or getting stunlocked by a rogue) was still powerful enough for me to oneshot certain players back then, or at least do a lot of damage. It's still a legit spec even after the nerf. Don't you think?
---
14 years later, I don't remember why it sucked, just that I hated it
---
&gt; While some of your comments are a bit abrasive 
---
Its lonely at the top...
---
&gt; I was on the receiving end of a server that died...  no way to experience content. 
---
It becomes an entirely different game, or lack there of.
---
&gt; server merges will be necessary for the longevity of many would-be consistent subscriptions. 
---
Yep. They were part of vanilla, they ARE part of retail and they WILL be part of Classic. There is really no sense in arguing otherwise... Classic WoW will have everything we can expect including (but not limited to): other players, auction houses, mailboxes, mana AND server transfers! Yaaay
---
Wow what a brain !
---
It's extra damage, yeah, but relying on the right circumstances in a large fight or against a Rogue is so inconsistent, that 99 times out of a 100 it'll still only be an extra hit.
---
It's still extra damage, for sure, but it really knocks down Rets by a huge margin compared to private servers.
---
Boi, I got my charge cooldown
---
As unbalanced as Warrior vs Mage was, I think Mage vs Warlock was even more one-sided.
---
nice mental gymnastics  
---
Right. Wasnt meant to be a complete list, just a quick glance for context. There are a metric TON of servers that have been merged. 
---
19 rogue twink,29 warlock twink
---
It depends on the server economy. But during progression I was spending approx. 300-400g per raid, 3 times per week
---
I wonder if this is actually true though. Most new games fall into this category of what you are describing—however, theoretically, part of the reason why classic wow was so successful is because it constantly forced you to undergo delayed gratification, which is much more similar to real life accomplishments than current video game accomplishments. You needed to do difficult, sometimes unenjoyable things, to get a desired outcome, and it made you enjoy that outcome even more. It is basic psychology, something that has been completely abandoned by the way-side in recent years.  Taking the hour+ to first walk from Darnasus to Stormwind as a level 11 wouldn't be described as fun, and there won't be any flashing lights or bells and whistles when you get there, but it will feel more real and better at the same time. It would take a few paragraphs to articulate why, but for what its worth, it *does* feel better.
---
However, to OP, 4-5 hours is plenty of time to game at once. Consider your lack of "motivation" to play longer than that actually "motivation" to go do something that will actually help your life—like exercise, learning, working, dating, cooking, etc.
---
Spend money on consumables that are very expensive. Greater Shadow Resist Potions, Invisibility Potions, Free-action Potions.
---
Right? This sub is toxic af. Forget talking about making a good remake. They just drag their heals about every change proposed that they havent already accepted.
---
\^ Guy that thinks what button they press matters when they get the same gear on all hybrids but enhance/ret, when WoW has 40 man raids unlike TBC and you HAVE to have a lot of people healing or people like you couldn't be carried and wouldn't get to raid anyways.
---
Mages respec and press arcane power frostbolt. Healers respec and press a heal spell. 
---
Enhance and Ret get crafted and free GOOD weapons unlike other classes. Arcanite Reaper pre raid into The Unstoppable Force is about as good as it gets. Both classes are also much less gear dependent than warriors and warriors don't even have a good plate DPS set until AQ. They were leather and mail, except they can't immune and heal or help their team with utility that rets never use because they are played by 5-10 year olds and people who are bad at games.
---
The mistake in Vanilla was not that Ret and Enhance weren't "dps viable" in a raid. The mistake was making the specs in the first place. They brought horrible, entitled whiners to WoW who are never satisfied unless their class is completely broken, when most rerolled from warrior and rogue after they died to level 10 murlocs and caster trolls in starter areas. 
---
It's the reason they cry about those two classes so much. They know they failed at them.
---
So the one thing that's going to slap you in the face is the amount of consumables you need and the amount of time it takes to acquire them.  Either farming the mats yourself or the gold to purchase them (black lotus lol).  I'd say half of your raid time each week is raid prep, at least initially.
---
Agreed, just put AA there incase someone corrected me, as it would be good for keeping the warrior in combat at range if Fire Blast was down/fire school locked or getting extra instant damage in under the same aforementioned circumstances.
---
Another class I think would have just as much trouble would be Warlocks with Shadow Resistance. Assuming they weren't destruction, I don't know how they would handle 200+ Shadow Resistance with just Searing Pain and Immolate. Then again I'm not sure how one assembles +200 Shadow Res gear without dropping under 4000 life. haha
---
If I was really rich in WoW I would deck out my main as much as possible, fuck an alt. Then I would only log on to raid or grief in wPvP.
---
Yeah lot of people here who seem to think desktops are an absolute requirement. I don't have space in my apartment for an ugly computer desk/chair setup and have been playing wow the last 2 years on an Acer Aspire from the couch with no issue. Ran me about $550 four years ago, nothing to rave about but runs fantastic. 
---
&gt;horrible, entitled whiners
---
This accurately describes your post lmao.
---
Yeah I re-purposed my reply somewhat, didn't want to diminish this lad's effort in listing of the possible buffs before a raid.
---
Great info, thanks
---
rammas
---
You get downvoted by TBC fanbois.
---
They still don't get it, but they will. TBC is NOT GOING TO COME after Classic, as much as they want that. Those who are TBC fanbois are not many, in reality, but plenty on this sub. Mostly Arena fanbois, druids and paladins who want TBC just because they can actually tank something, and RP-ers who want Belfs. I am sorry for them...but it is not enough to justify TBC, FINANCIALLY.
---
Classic will be extended 3 years down the road, with new raids and dungeons, while keeping the same lvl cap and talents, without any change to classes, specs, skills, talents.
---
It is the most logical choice and the most financially viable.
---
its insane how many hours raiding took.
---
like wipes took like 10 minutes to recover from if no one went afk. 
---
so 6 wipes and you have lost an hour.
---
getting everyone to a raid could easily take 20-30 minutes if you were disorganised.
---
it depends if everyone is going in knowing what to do too, like if everyone is not on the same page people can wipe the raid.
---
i think the first few weeks a fuckload of guilds will fail, then there will probably be a few pretty good guilds that can knock everything out pretty fast on every server.
---
Yeah this never happened or it was on a private server, using rank 1 seals against a shaman when u were level 41? Sure man. And then everybody clapped!
---
This reads like some erotic fan fiction. It's fine that you guys are excited but this is just hilarious.
---
Correct. Technically I did Naxx in BC with a group of 70s but that doesn't count. 
---
So people who never played a game are willing to stand up to preserve it as much as they can because... they never played it?6
---
Yes, there is. The best balance ever in all WoW lifespan.
---
I think that a beta test is highly likely sometime soon™  because it serves multiple purposes: 
---
1. Marketing. Beta and all the streams/videos it creates is an awesome way to market a game. 
---
2. Testing the game for bugs in a way that is not possible behind closed doors. There is no way to test the product in fullscale without a beta. Many of the bugs only appear when a large amount of testers start hammering the product. And those saying that "lmao classic don't require beta because it is an old game hur dur!" are simply wrong. Classic does require testing for the technical side of things because it essentially is a new product. Sure the gameplay designing is already done but that is only half of the story.
---
3. Stress testing. Beta is the best way to see how their servers handle real scenarios and how much if any sharding (damn you sharding!) etc. would be required.
---
I explained that 5g respec in my personal experiance is a better gold sink then 50g.
---
&gt; Nearly every change you suggested requires community interaction. 
---
I dont get it, how is this even bad? Vanilla is praised because it promotes community interaction.   
---
Maybe you should first tell me whats wrongs with my suggessiotions then using lame 1 liner: NoChange, go play retail if you want QoL! that doesnt explain anything nor does it bring any constructive debate.
---
I love vanilla PvP, its ton of fun, but I havent meet 1 serious pvper in all those years, who supports current system. Reducing honor decay, removing DK, increase honor gain when  playing full premade vs full premade would be a good start without the need of full honor rework.
---
Cross-realm sharding, obviously
---
ive seen you post this same thing like 3 times its not a bug dude. seal of crusader sucks balls 
---
Doesn't sound like Vanilla. There's retail though.
---
&gt; Marketing. Beta and all the streams/videos it creates is an awesome way to market a game.
---
same as private servers. Trailers and such things are really the only difference.
---
&gt; Testing the game for bugs in a way that is not possible behind closed doors. There is no way to test the product in fullscale without a beta. Many of the bugs only appear when a large amount of testers start hammering the product. 
---
especially in such project. Devs can never get the idea to change something, and players will find it wrong, you see.
---
&gt; Stress testing. Beta is the best way to see how their servers handle real scenarios and how much if any sharding (damn you sharding!) etc. would be required.
---
There should be no sharding required. Sharding is probably just meant to give authentic vanilla experience to new players (back then, only a small group started at day 1)
---
But in later game, there will be situations when zones will be overrun, and sharding would be completely gamebreaking
---
It's an imbalanced zerg-fest for most of the time with mines and strong guards to forward the fighting into a choke point (Atleast during early patch AV.)
---
What people did not understand they had to get resources from the mines for commando attacks and pelts from the opposing front bases for mounted assaults.
---
These could turn the tide of the battle with any kind of support as they were still NPCs.
---
After a while there was a possibility to summon a big stonking elemental to assist you in your attack.
---
There were a lot of different ways to try to turn the tide (Shredders) and if you got in far enough you could release and turn in insignias to summon 3 different Wing Masters to bombard your opposing force.
---
After the nerfs it turned into a zergfest instead of a class spesific battleground that required everyone to play their part.
---
buying 3x3 dragonlings (green, red and black)  for my 3 best bank alts obviously!
---
Depends how hardcore you are. If you are hardcore you will spend a RETARDED amount of ingame time for the first 3 weeks to a month. Then its cruise control and you get world buffs, clear MC and BWL ALL within 2 hours of logging in. So hardcore is A LOT of time upfront, and then a lot of coasting. Casual is less time upfront but you have to consistently put in time forever.
---
I'm not the one trying to change a 2004 video game because I failed at it.
---
autism speaks
---
Yet they did not say the magic words “there will be only one Kazzak”. Care to elaborate why you think they express themselves in such a fuzzy manor?
---
Can't that be skipped though? Something with a frozen waterfall and jumping? Maybe I am remembering incorrectly 
---
&gt; its not a bug dude. seal of crusader sucks balls
---
Well, that's arguable. What is your definition of a bug? SoR was fixed to not proc more often than SotC because it was considered a mistake, a programming error. A bug.
---
If it wasn't for this bug SotC would be the go-to seal for anyone with a trinket proc, weapon effect, or enchant. It would also give you more mana / life back on JoL/JoW.
---
The only reason SoR is picked over SotC is because SoR does all of that too, accidentally. It wasn't fixed till 2.1.0.
---
It isn’t necessary ffs
---
Nah autism tries to buff a class the designers said was specifically designed for new players from a 2004 video game, when you don't even play the class right or use it's utility like all the other ret paladins. 
---
yeah, WSG had a strong: 'we never win , so let's go farm Hks in the midfield'  vibe going on in pugs when I last played alliance... 
---
But for AV, back in the old days rushing was not a thing (at least not on our server, most battles took hours)   so  it was not like one side gave up before the fight started.   Both sides had a group of serious players that tried teamwork,  solo agents and people who just did nothing useful.   Horde usually had slightly more serious players I guess. 
---
and I am perfectly fine with mages and warlocks being stronger on alliance in raids,no problem with it what so ever.
---
If factions plays raids differently and have a different experience I am all for it. I played horde warlock,still did DPS.Had threat issues,and was mostly a "support" role, and that was okay.
---
Shadow Priests too - they usually eat up Warriors but it'd be a fun surprise throwing on 300 shadow resist and watch them burn through mana trying to land SW:P
---
Dual reflectors are a good source of resists without losing much of anything.
---
thats how it functioned it seems normal. seals are paladins replacement for abilities and his seal of righteosness is an extra attack so it procs things the same way a warriors whirlwind or mortalstrike or overpower will. reckoning isnt intended either to be saved up for charges and they left it like that in all of vanilla and then changed in tbc. i guess they should fix that unintended feature of storing 4 stacks of reckoning
---
Look I'm all about vanilla's class identity and philosophies like "Bring the player, don't bring the class," but this is just wrong. If you want the paladin's buffs, that's not the end of the discussion. You now get to pick which paladin you want. Specs matter, and if the raid leader gets to choose between a strong healer and a weak dps, he's just going to bring the strong healer.
---
Yeah I'd say non-Destruction Warlocks and Shadow Priests are the only classes that have major issues with resistance gear even if the player properly adapts, with Frost Mage coming in close'ish after that. They just don't have enough tools of other schools to really be capable of doing much adaptation. Every other class can adapt in one way or another.
---
That being said, I think resistance gear would still be effective against the majority of players. I seriously doubt most players would notice or be able to adapt quickly.
---
Bitter much?
---
We are NOT implementing changes. 
---
That lad being me.
---
In 90% of those transactions it will actually work like this:
---
Player 1 gives gold to player 2 in Classic. 
---
Player 2 laughs at player 1, keeps his gold.
---
Player 1 opens a ticket. Blizzard says “sorry but we don’t get involved in deals between players of this nature. You’re on your own.”
---
Also, why would it matter if gold in Classic could maybe kinda sorta be used in a roundabout way to obtain game time?
---
Lastly, I’m failing to see where the “transfer gold from retail to classic” part happens. Eli5 that please. Your previous examples do not make sense. 
---
Thanks for reading.
---
“Seal of Command
---
Rank 1
---

---
Seal of Command
---
Rank 3

140 mana” 
---
Thanks again for reading &amp; sharing.
---
I'd like to clarify that the given numbers are the total amounts, not for each boss.
---
i.e
---
Means 4-5 GNPP in grand total. Basically 1 for each of the mentioned bosses. Again, this assuming a ZERO wipes raid.
---
Gifting game time would make more sense. The OP is jumping at shadows. 
---
[repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9fbir3/warrior_vs_frostmage/)
---
If KTM is available, itll be easy. If it isnt, it wont.
---
This was great to read! Can't wait for this as well! One day I will be 60 mage. One day.
---
No problem, glad you got some satisfaction out of writing up your fantasy scenario. 
---
Do you mean 300-400 per day as in 900-1200 gold per week?
---
Now I feel somewhat silly. 
---
But yeah, your list is a tryhard one and I was trying to generalise it for the masses, really for no reason.
---
as classic released we only get 2 raids at first.
---
So MC+Ony take around 4-6 hours at first. inlcuding everything, traveling, waiting for ppl, fuck ups and such. then it became progressively faster as raid get gear and a hang of things.
---
as bwl released you'll need another evening for that. 
---
overall usually on average it can be packed in like 2 evenings.
---
Bitter that someone makes up a story? Why would that make me bitter? His post alone could supply this sub with memes for a whole year
---
Progression time commitment is going to vary, but here's how long raids tend to take when they are totally on farm with 0 wipes to give you an absolute minimum baseline. You really want to dedicate three times as much time as I list to make solid progress during progression:
---
MC: 1 hour.
---
BWL: 1 hour.
---
AQ40: 2 hours.
---
Naxx: 4 hours.
---
This doesn't count any time needed to get to the raid or prepare world buffs like Ony/ZG head turn ins.
---
Hardcore speedrunning guilds can clear raids in about half the time I listed but requires max consumables, world buffs, everyone being really focused the whole time and using speedrun strats, etc.
---
this is why we need a beta
---
We're very concerned with retaining the features that built great communities back in Vanilla and BC. Any QoL risk taking away from this.
---
I think AV gets a bad rep for being alliance favored which i don't think is true at all. I've played both factions and gotten exalted with both several times and i would say both have advantages.
---
The alliance advantage is really only one thing, the bridge. Two towers and a bunch of elites is tough but fortunately for the hordes they can skip all of that. The horde got a similar choke point though between iceblood and tower point with two towers and a ton of elites as well with no way past but going straight throug. After alliance cleared that choke point they still have another much easier one to get through by the horde base that is still two towers and a bunch of elites. The alliance equivalent to the iceblood/tower point choke is incredibly easy to by pass for hordes with only one tower since alliance have one completely useless tower of the side.
---
The second horde advantage besides having two choke points is that Drek is just way stronger than Vanndar, [2.5 times stronger.](https://external-preview.redd.it/LRpLO9C2ADnbBvrkpol45DicrQntKpc1yRtsug2y4tw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4ba38444536fa7d816c17a817e60306c83f8ab2d) Stun and avatar is nothing compared to the cleave and frenzy of drek. It only takes a few hordes teleporting in and disrupting the alliance to make them wipe on Drek while it's almost impossible to actually wipe on Vanndar.
---
Shaman looked at OP and OP bubble hearthed
---
&gt; reckoning isnt intended either to be saved up for charges and they left it like that in all of vanilla and then changed in tbc.
---
This just isn't true, my dude.
---
If it was, then after the Kazzak fiasco they wouldn't have reduced the charge-cap from infinite to four. They clearly still wanted Reckoning to have a charge system able to be saved up.
---
I think you're confused. What *wasn't* intended was the /sit bug—to manually create a stack by /sitting. *That's* what they patched, and [here's the bluepost showing this was fixed long before 1.12.](https://web.archive.org/web/20061206141810/http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-paladin/1069149.htm)
---
&gt; “Can I sit down to force a crit and gain a charge?”
---
&gt; “**Charges will not generate off auto attacks or npc attacks by trying to sit down and force a crit.**”
---
#
---
&gt; seal of righteosness is an extra attack so it procs things the same way a warriors whirlwind or mortalstrike or overpower will.
---
That's a semantic argument. SoR adds Holy damage to your weapon swings. That doesn't necessarily mean it should procs things the same way a weapon swing would.
---
It seems like it wasn't intended to, hence the patch notes:
---
&gt; “Seal of Righteousness: This seal will no longer cause additional chances for weapon procs to trigger.”
---
Love the story!
---
Classicast recently did an interview with Kevin Jordan who was responsible for class design in vanilla.
---
Starts at about 1:21:40
---
In regards to Paladins being listed as an easy class Kevin says: "this is sort of one of Rob Bordeaux Classic blunders at blizzcon where he sort of listed the philosophies behind the classes and one of them was 'easy to play' for paladins, which sort of set the community off, 'its the baby class...' I always considered it more of the chess class"
---
I guess its all perspective. I mean, as someone who has played almost all the Classes at a high level, I think that you need to acknowledge that rogues do incredibly well in 1v1s. They arent the killing machines they were misinterpreted to be in Vanilla, but they also arent weak... I mean, if you start talking about druids, spriests and ele shamans I would raise you SL warlocks. I think if you consider the entire body of PvP balance (which changes in regards to world pvp, duels, premades etc) SL locks are likely the MOST broken single pvp spec. But that doesnt really matter does it? Because hunters have the highest value ability in group pvp - viper sting. Paladins provide some of the best pvp healing available. Dont discount the mass heals that a priest can do to a group sustaining heavy spread damage... But what about the druid flag carrier that is the ONLY efficient answer to flag carrying... I mean... The game finds balance in imbalance and the game is certainly not designed to be balanced in duels or world pvp or even general pvp... The game has SOME semblance of balance in pve, and even that is questionable.
---
I'm mainly going engineering for you bastards. The things I do for you.
---
Who are the "haters"?
---
Rank 14 was special because of the dedication it took. If we remove that dedication, then how do we make sure that only the same percentage of the population is rank 14 any given time? We can't all be rank 14.
---
5g as a better gold sink is an interesting theory, but I think you underestimate the number of hardcore raiders/pvpers who stomached the cost. Making the game more accessible to casuals doesn't necessary mean a better game. Also, with fewer respecs the community begins to learn who you are. Who is that guy? He's the toxic pvp shadow priest. Your reputation is more than your class in vanilla; it is also your spec.
---
Your black lotus suggestion means less scarcity. Scarcity = value. Same thing with rank 14 weapons. The more people have them, the less they actually mean. Vanilla was designed for hardcore players and casual players. The more things you give to casual players, the more you disincentivize players that want to stand out. It used to be so epic when you saw a rank 14 or two in your game. Furthermore, dungeons provide nearly the same or better weapons for a fraction of the time investment. If players want a "healthier" lifestyle for their gear grind, they can just raid. I'd rather have Ashkandi or Hand of Rag than rank 14 on my warrior.
---
Many of your other UI requests can be done through addons and workarounds. E.g. You want voice communication? Find an app for it. You want DKP system? Find an app for it. You want a calendar? Find an app for it.
---
None of this approaches the problem that many of the changes you are asking for require a team of world class game designers to execute them to not have unintended consequences that ruin the game in another way. Many things in vanilla wow were "imperfect", but those imperfections created some amazing experiences and friendships.
---
In short! Many of those QoL changes can be solved by working together in game collaboratively on a solution.
---
How would that change anything? People would still compete over honor, just much more honor, requiring just as much time.
---
A calender is very useful guild tool for organizing and tracking guild events and such, so you dont need to use web pages for every guild activity. And please explain me, how would a better Proffession window UI be threat to communities. They are completly player sided...
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
That is one ugly looking human.
---
It's not necessary. It has never been necessary. I'd say the proof is in the pudding on that one.
---
Tldr
---
Because you wont be uterlly punished for missing a week or 2 when real life gets in the way of ranking for example...
---
I agree he turned to insults which was pointless, i also agree with his points over your own though and dont call him a kid man you've 99 in your name, you are barely of adult age and call others kids just seems off, im not flaming you or trying to pick sides though :) 
---
A vocal minority that complain about Blizzard using their modern engine to make Classic. The obvious improvements to the graphics are a clear example of why it's a smart move.
---
Let's hope they have an Argent Dawn or Moonguard classic server. ;-)
---
but world of roguecraft....
---
How did that effect PVP Qs? Near instant with those numbers or were there more alliance but fewer PVPers
---
What is this incoherent madness? You have the writing skills of a deranged serial killer.
---
&gt; Yeah, and this is the biggest reason why TBC sucks ass.
---
Why you say this.
---
I'm definitely gonna be grinding this out once I get home from work! Great work, can't wait to play it!!
---
Finally someone who makes sense in this thread. I really wish some of these quote-unquote haters, would realize that we are a lot better at making Graphics nowadays than we were when Wow first came out, we should get to enjoy that without it's screwing up our game.
---
I have no idea, I'm not a game dev, and any changes that I would mention will just have the NOCHANGES crew bombard me with downvotes. All I am saying is that its an extremely unhealthy system as it was, mentally and physically.
---
Whats left is the other GPH methods that are equal to the first that
---
Do Not Require Resets.....
---
That's the point I'm trying to get across. Theres several at the top that don't require resets yet yield the same GPH. People will just do those instead.
---
Thanks have a great day 😜
---
here is something thats worded the exact same way. now we can nerf warrs sword spec because it was nerfed in tbc.. which would be dumb but this is what you want 
---
[Sword Specialization]: This talent’s free extra attacks can no longer trigger additional extra attacks.
---
thats patch 2.2 and worded the same as the seal of righteousness change. 
---
I play on a private server and I have a lvl 60 hunter. Same level elite mobs are easy to kill, even though you have to use heal.
---
Reading your comment made me wonder if elites are nerfed on the server or if pets are buffed, but they claim to be blizzlike in this regard.
---
Reddit, spread it through the guild and friends list. Eventually people will know
---
Its stupid of you to be here if all you are here to do is go into every thread and claim that Blizz will do the opposite of what they said they would because they cant be trusted.
---
Thats some ignorant shit, just go play something else you can trust. Why the hell would you spend all your time shitting in these threads?
---
I would personaly welcome option to enable HD textures.
---
There would be the same amount of BL spawns per day. There would only be more possible locations, spawn nods, where they can spawn in every respective zone.   
---
Some of those addons like auctioneer and improved mailbox are fine. Others like calender are buggy and unreliable. If nothing else, I atleast hope new addon support will be able to solve this problems.   
---
Changes for Honor system shouldnt really be that about making r14 accessible to casual. Its more about limiting the unhealtiness,burnout and ingame toxicity that grinding honor for \~15h/day every day for a few months bring....
---
Thanks for the post pal. 👍
---
So they can never give us an update now even if there make progress because at some point in the past they stated there was nothing to report?
---
Professions, alts and rep
---
I havnt seen anyone hate on using the new engine.
---
It would be stupid if that is what I do. But it is not what I do.
---
I am here to partake in classicwow discussions. Sometimes I post skepticism, sometimes optimism. No one is one sided unless they are a troll.
---
If you don't think I am not looking forward to classicwow as much as anyone else, then fine. But I most certainly am. I am just being skeptic as to what blizzard says or some of their decisions as they don't like up with my own opinions. 
---
Also, it's healthier, in my opinion, to be skeptic about anything you spend money on. Always question what they're trying to sell you. Or you will get sold on bullshit.
---
I'll probably level a Warrior alt after I get my Hunter to where I want it to be financially. I'll use the gold I've amassed to fund the levelling and gearing process for my alt.
---
Wall jumping is something that’s going to be fixed, so the back door wont be a thing. At least I think I remember reading that, not 100% sure.
---
Not sure if it’s considered better, but the life drain proc scales with spell power. 
---
Mages from what I can remember were great at leveling! You’ll get there wether it’s static leveling or casual play. The beauty of classic wow is that it’s ment to be a preservation. You can take a month or year to acquire your goal because they are essentially “removing the treadmill” sort of speak. 
---
Good luck out there buddy maybe we’ll run into each other as either friend or foe. Any way it’ll be a blast!!
---
The graphics don’t bother me, but I am slightly concerned about other things that are different on the modern client. How rogues energy replenishment works is one example, spell batching is another.
---
Uh oh he's back again
---
I do have my limits. Axes and wands can pass 
---
The PvP and bank, mailbox I agree with. Not drop rates or anything like that.
---
You are an orc among men
---
Thanks I appreciate it 🤙
---
&gt; The mistake in Vanilla was not that Ret and Enhance weren't "dps viable" in a raid. The mistake was making the specs in the first place. They brought horrible, entitled whiners to WoW who are never satisfied unless their class is completely broken, when most rerolled from warrior and rogue after they died to level 10 murlocs and caster trolls in starter areas. 
---
This shows that you definitely have completely lost sight and understanding of what a game (most notably a RPG one) is. And I'm really sorry for the likes of you.
---
And also, just because you didn't get inspired by paladin retribution or shaman lore / way of playing does not mean your view is righter than other's people.
---
The only real problem in Vanilla was that WoW is a complex game and it was obviously impossible for Blizzard in a world like ours to develop a close-to-perfect game where all classes are perfectly balanced and asymetric / heterogenic at the same time, in such a relative short amount of time. Hence the "problems" we can see in Vanilla, that were mostly fixed in TBC, as close to perfect we had, to eventually get worse and worse with the expansions from what I know.
---
Seal of Rightousness's extra Holy damage was fixed to not count as a second weapon swing (which it *technically isn't.*)
---
This is why Holy Shock doesn't proc enchants, JoL/W, or weapon effects, even though it's also a source of Holy damage.
---
Maybe it's just me, (my eyes aren't as good as they used to be) but the pictures look the same. Just the right one looks more dark.
---
Blizzard has already stated that there will not be tokens in Classic. As is that’s not even what the OP is about. 
---
That seems like a very ineffective deterrent by your own admission.
---
Karazhan was planned for Vanilla in the same way Northrend and Outland were. It was there in the earliest stages and some work was done but by early 2005 Karazhan was already slated for Naxx. 
---
John Staats book has more info.
---
I clearly remember having 4 stacks almost always when duelling a rogue after his initial combo and just putting him at 20% hp if not dead after HoJ and a burst of mine. But of course it's less broken without having infinite stacks.
---
How? I dont play with him. None of my guildies will, and the 1.5k in the reddit group wont if they checked the post. Out of 4k on the server thats at least 1.7k. And that was from one ninja moment. He does it again in another group more people will be aware. 
---
Not until you significantly outgeared the content. Many pulls had to have multiple tanks, kill order and CC.
---
General chat and yell
---
Great pass!
---
Nobody gives a shit. Except you sadly.
---
Something like that. Flask of the Titans was about 110g on my server. But once we had a wing on farm, I stopped using flask for that wing so it started to cost less and less
---
That's harassment and not allowed on Blizzard servers...
---
Looks the same.
---
&gt;and the 1.5k in the reddit group wont if they checked the post.
---
What reddit group is that who can have so many players from the same realm?
---
Create alts and sit in BG all day
---
Lvl 19 hunter twink, lvl 29 mage twink, lvl 39 shaman twink, doing wPvP constantly popping FAPs on my warrior, helping newbies out with 14slot bags + starting gear + some gold
---
Well, for one example, this warrior is *massively* gimping his damage, tankiness, overall effectiveness to get this level of frost resist. This player spent a ton of time and money putting together this build, and its only use is stunting on mages in front of Org. That makes it probably more trouble than it's worth for most players.
---
"The game was rigged from the start."
---
Why even wear gear? Wouldn't wanna have to spend gold on repairs ya know...
---
Still among the most useful consumables you can stack, titanic, lionheart, stronghold, arcanite reaper, edgemasters, wPvP with lots of FAPs. 
---
You can easily spend 3k gold on gear as warrior
---
Every bit you lower the bar for r14, there are more people who will say "I want to go for that." This by definition makes it more accessible. More accessibility = more r14 weapons. More r14 weapons = no scarcity. No scarcity = who cares? 40 other people have it. There should only be a limited number of rank 14's. It isn't meant for many people. It isn't meant for me. I'm okay with that. It is not the responsibility of a corporation to play the role of parent. 
---
Furthermore, if you want to form an agreement on your server that everyone puts in x amount of honor grind, then that becomes the mark. What does this take? Community interaction and problem solving. If you approach rank 14 as everyone for themselves, it will be hell. So... Don't... And again... Raid gear is pretty powerful and accessible.
---
They brought up the rogue energy thing at blizzcon and confirmed it will be as it was in vanilla.
---
As far as spell-batching goes, all we've got is a "we'll look into it" from them.
---
Ok sure
---
I mean, I agree that hybrids are better than how most people around here think (bunch of retail players that don't understand what a support class is). But your post still sucks.
---
Ye I believe that..think the context here is those speed run guys that have interesting aoe rotations, they probably outgear the content by quite a bit
---
Don't blame me, it was how Blizzard designed Vanilla WoW in 2004. They later changed that in TBC.
---
I mean, Blizzard said it was necessary. I don't see why they would lie about that. 
---
Thats without the epic mount, and saving that much takes forever as you are constantly using consumeables at a higher rate than anyone else.
---
Haha i feel you , especially about the ele shamy part . I remember legit 2 shotting every single mob in strat live with a lighting bolt + a shock or a chain + a shock
---
Very few players ever become rich in vanilla. 90% of your gold will be spent on consumables and if you have the luxury of having excess you'll likely use that as an opportunity to play other games. This game consumes your life.
---
What you want them to ban people for being ninjas? Of course they will still get groups the most you can do is avoid or gank the ayer depending on faction
---
And idk if I can put the reddit group being its a private server and most pservers have quite a few players. Some with 4k players. If you really want to know I can DM you the post
---
&gt;Look I'm all about vanilla's class identity and philosophies like "Bring the player, don't bring the class
---
Lol that's not the philosophy in Vanilla. It's the opposite. Vanilla is more, Bring the class, with the optimal spec for your class-role and consumables, oh, and skill if you have that, can't hurt...
---
Naming and shaming is allowed....
---
19 Rogue Twink, 29 druid twink, 29 paladin twink, 29 rogue twink hmmm
---
&gt;it was how Blizzard designed  
---
more like lack of design  
---
they had no clue what they were doing for the most part  
---
no its not different you can easily say sword procing more procs is unintended and they fixed in tbc.. just like how you say seal of righeosness is unintended and they fixed in tbc so it should be fixed in vanilla. 
---
You can’t name people on reddit either.
---
I think that every realm will have dedicated discord group where many players will hang out. Those groups usually don't have those restrictions and you can name and shame as much as you can. Probably someone will maintain a list of those ninja-looters. From now on you only need a simple addon to periodically import that list (or just check it manually if you want to avoid addons) and that's all. Those lists will be moderated and hopefully abuse will be prevented by requiring screenshots, etc.
---
I don't really trust in-game shaming. Even if it won't be punished, it's not effective. I did not play in vanilla, but I played in TBC and WotLK on small server and I could remember only a few times someone called out ninja looter in /1 and I don't think that I even bothered to add him to black list, because I didn't trust some random guy in chat.
---
&gt; more like lack of design  
---
they had no clue what they were doing for the most part 
---
Agree. But you still have to ask yourself what you want. Do you want Vanilla or do you want something different.
---
No it's not.
---
Pretty sure you can in this sub or any non blizz sanction sub. Or just blur out your names.
---
no 
---
An additional Holy damage component attached to a normal weapon swing doesn’t count mechanically as a second weapon swing in any other instance. 
---
Can you cite where it says that? Not doubting, just haven't seen it myself and I think it adds a problematic layer to the ninja looting issue.
---
I'm searching for the wording in the rules. In the meantime you have a blue post here: [https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613453787#post-12](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613453787#post-12)
---
"And" here is being used to distinguish two separate ideas, not to distribute ownership of two things. I shoulda' worded that better.
---
When AV launched, we didn't have enough horde PVPing on our server, so AV would generally only spawn on weekends. The NPCs were strong enough at that point that, as long as it was 40 on 40, no one would win, so the game would go on all day until about 2 am when the horde wouldn't have 40 people playing anymore and eventually lose
---
A very different time. 
---
Haha. Not a chance, pal!
---
Personally, I want improved vanilla. Make classes and raids actually fun and engaging for the most part, don't change anything else (apart from adding new content, like OSRS)  
---
Paladins having crusader strike like they were supposed to have (removed in beta) won't turn the game upside down  
---
(just an example)  
---
For me personally, I don't really care to be honest. I just want Vanilla, as close as possible to the historical authentic experience... If Blizzard want to run custom servers on the side, I'm all for that.
---
You should not take the privet server times as gospel. Armor and resistance values ar off in privet servers and boss mechanic are not coded right either so it is a guess how hard raiding will he. It is a good guess that mc+onyx will be pretty easy like all first tire raids in every expansion 
---
Have you ever actually opened a wowhead page without Adblock enabled? First of all it takes forever to load because the sheer amount of ads. Second it has videos auto playing, audio that will pop in suddenly while the page is minimized, and all sorts of other shady things. Even opening the site on mobile is a terrible experience. I've since switched to other sites and haven't looked back.
---
The thing about wowhead is nothing the site is providing is of any value. If you ever look something up on the site 90% of the time the answer is probably in the comments section uploaded by a community member as volunteer work. If the community as a whole moved away from their site they would have nothing. Luckily it's very easy to copy and paste the comments and that's what competitors have started to do.
---
Good thing this only pertains to Europe
---
&gt;Personally, I want improved vanilla.
---
So start a petition for that so we can have authentic vanilla and on the side custom server. Don't try to ruin Vanilla for the rest...
---
People like you basically want TBC capped at 60 without Outlands. That's fine. But you know, the vast majority of the community want the historical authentic experience.
---
It happened in vanilla constantly however.  
---
I mean, that's how it's been done since launch. I've never heard of anyone getting banned for it. 
---
It doesn't. Naming and shaming is against the rules on all Blizzard forums and game and have always been against the rules.
---
and judgement of command working as a melee spell that does magic is unlike other spells in the game. it too can trigger procs and does 2x damage instead of 1.5 but its a magic ability 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8URSUWm0

Go into the forums right now and try and fine a single naming and shaming post...
---
&gt; People often claim that its not a problem because the ninjas will be alienated by the community.

As a notorious ninja looter during retail vanilla. I rarely felt consequences for my actions... In fact I ninjad domos chest twice, in two separate guilds on my priest and still found it easy to jump in another guild. Whats worse is this issue will be compounded if the server pops are increased... I can do WHATEVER I want on private and NEVER hear about it again. Loot trading will be a massive issue that I will definitely exploit if it is available... For everyones sake, I hope its not available.
---
As far as naming and shaming is concerned, it never worked. People like to romanticize that servers bound together to eradicate poor behavior and vanilla was the apex of server community, no one cared... It was hard enough to get a full guild to give a shit that someone took something from you, let alone a server.
---
First you have to get the content on farm mode.
---
Second a casual guild will take much, much longer clear times as they aren't character maxing. 
---
Third, if you are in an Elite guild, runs will be much faster but you are expected to farm for pots/flask.
---
4 hours is just not enough time unless you just raid log with an elite guild. Most elite guilds won't put up with stuff like this.
---
Chugging endless amounts of Swiftness Potions in pvp and of course a lvl 39 survival hunter twink with Pendulum of Doom.
---
How so?
---
Doesn't need to be rich but, 49 warrior twink.

I remember that there was this wow trivia addon. During quiet hours, I ran trivia games in gchat and award gold as prizes to the winners. 
---
I also gave away gold prizes to winners of  low level (less than level 10) duels, which I would host outside SW bank. 
---
No, and crusader aura wasn't added until tbc.
---
There is no crusader aura in classic. It was added in BC. But pursuit of justice does not stack with the movement speed boot enchant 
---
Ok thank you guys. Been that long that I don't remember
---
Then do it outside blizzard forums? Here? /yell in Ironforge?
---
A warrior can use a 1.5g free-action pot and absolutely destroy any mage.
---
A warlock will resist nearly every spell of a mage with some T2 and his felhoiund out. A mage would stand a better chance melee'ing the warlock.
---
It's even hard to kill a felhound pet as a mage.
---
He said general chat and yelling, not forums.
---
2.5 times more kills by an NPC doesnt mean its 2.5 times harder... nice try man.  By that logic, Drek is more difficult than Onyxia (using the same list).  More kills just means that more allies make it to drek than make it to Van, thus a bigger % of deaths.  I'm not bragging here but I've been a part of many wipes to Van....sorry to burst your bubble.
---
I can't find the wording anymore. It used to be specifically in the rules. Now it's more broad and generic about harassment is not allowed. If you do anything on the forum or chat that can lower the gaming experience for someone else, it's against the rules and you can get banned for that.

&gt;Any behaviour that endangers the gaming experience of other players.

I paid for and played 1.0 at launch.  I can no longer play the game I bought and will not be able to even when classic launches.

This is from a warlock perspective. Ok so assuming you raid for 4 hours a night you will most likely take 2-3 days per clear. During progression you're gonna want to be flasked 100% of the time but for this example let's assume you're only using one flask per raid and saving it for crucial encounters. Bare minimum you're gonna want atleast 10 greater shadow resist and greater nature resist potions. Greater fire resist. 10-15 of both elixir of spell damage and shadow damage. Weapon oil. 10 mana potions and dark runes. Limited invulnerability potions for incase you pull aggro. Enough zanzas to afford the stamina potion. Bandages. There's a few more defensive consumes you can take but they're a bit excessive. Some nights will be cheaper then others and during progression expect to go through a few thousand gold very quickly. If I planned to raidlog naxx I would save every copper from the moment the server began and would put every ounce of free time into farming gold, and even then you might not have enough depending on how long the time between AQ release and naxx release. You don't want to be stuck loggin in after work to furiously farm gold 4 hours before raid time it's a very miserable existence.
---
Interesting
---
They had to nerf set bonuses and buff (significantly) tier 4 and 5 sets to be competitive with naxx gear and some of the obscure vanilla items. Most of vanilla had the odd set piece or specific stats which were by far bis. Naxx changed that by massively raising the stats to the point where nothing else competed. I'm not saying it should be changed, I'm for a pure experience, only that it was an out of character jump in power for vanilla and obviously affected by the upcoming expansion.

Naming and shaming is by definition endangering the gaming experience for someone else...
---
I disagree. If you use that logic then ninja looting endangers the gaming experience for other players and therefore ninjas will be banned by blizzard.
---
Yeah. For that I use an extension called noscript.
---
Yes sure, but that's specifically allowed: [https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/900641023](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/900641023)
---
Which vanilla experience? There were constant changes throughout vanilla.
---
Either you're happy with changes or you want 1.0 as it was at launch. 
---
Nope. It's not a bug, it's a mechanics. If it's unbalanced, so be it. Even some bugs I'd like to be reproduced if they significantly altered gameplay, like forcing crits with sitting down and getting profit from those crits.
---
Lol there are only 50k on this reddit and thats internationally. And half of them dont even browse this sub everyday. And there will be more than 4k per server.... Just everything you said is wrong
---
&gt;Which vanilla experience?
---
Anything withing patch 1.1-1.12.1 So "balance changes" for some specs is not ok because that's from patch 2.0.1 and forward.
---
Regardless of what you are leveling, voidwalker.
---
You technically aren't allowed to account share on retail. Shouldn't be a major issue.
---
No to Black Lotus spawn change as that would make content easier. Private server made clearing content on easy mode because everybody had flasks and onyxia buffs at all times. Getting pots and onyxia was a real luxury on retail.  On P server I was running the onyxia at all times. Huge difference. 
---
Sorry, it was sarcasm because you linked the EU forums.
---
They have this addon for vanilla as well :)
---
Can you please highlight anywhere where that says that ninja looting is allowed.
---
1.5k = 1,500... i really dont understand what you are saying
---
Time to TWINK
---
No matter how you cut it this was a terrible idea on blizzards part and, is only supported by people who never Ed actually played classic. Loot is way to rare and, coveted for this nonsense. Now people have to live on master loot or get screwed. Every hunter on the server about to have half of dal rend. 
---
REMEMBER - In classic your pvp trinket doesn't get you out of every incapacitating effect.  On a recent private server I was reminded that the warlock pvp trinket has fear break but NOT stun break.  As an undead warlock I had 2 fear breaks (WotF and pvp trinket) and NO stun break.  
---
Extra incentive to go orc warlock for pvp purposes, although honestly if you don't have your succubus out that stun-lock rogue is going to kill you....orc or not.
---
As a horde player. Alterac Valley was bullshit. Also as a horde player. I wouldn't have it any other way. Some of my best memories of classic wow was leading charges over that span. Some of the funnest wow.

You changed topic. I asked where they say that ninja looting is allowed. Your quote says that people cannot be called out on the forums. These are different.

'That certainly does not mean that we condone such behavior but there is only so much that can be done.' Quote from second link. They do not condone ninja looting so it is not specifically allowed like you said it was.

Great post - I smiled the whole time remembering similar encounters. Classic cannot come soon enough

I’m glad you enjoyed the short story buddy! I’m highly anticipating the relaunch of wow. It cannot come soon enough!!!

They wont see the post. This sub only has 1% of the subscribers that will play classic. And the chances that this 1% is from the server you are complaining from is even smaller than that. Complaining about a ninja on this sub will get you nowhere.
---
False. You should have R1 frostbolt bound at all times.
---
I literally see no difference apart from the brightness appears to have been turned up?
---
Drain Life is not actually super strong, between knockback and taking real damage because its Vanilla, Voidwalker is always the way to go
---
There just may be more sub reddits when classic launches.
---
Besides if people dont pay attention to the chat fro. Guild, sub reddit, un official forms. Just put them on your ignore list so you dont have to play with them. Again not difficult. Ninjas have always been apart of wow and always will.
---
I don't know what the rules was in Vanilla. But today it's not allowed.
---
Likely this is a tanks frost resist set for Sapphiron in Naxx. He isn’t useless, he’s just testing it on a mage while he’s at it.
---
Yes, I agree, ninjas have and always will be a part of WoW, but complaining about a ninja on THIS sub specifically will get you nowhere.

Tell me about it thats why I stopped trying!
---
Hybrid tax should be done with raw numbers, it should be a utility cost. 
---
Kitty should be able to do the same raw dps as a rogue, but rogues also get stuns, poisons, lockpicking, trap disarming, pick pocket, vanish etc. 
---
Moonkin should be able to do the same raw dps as mage, but mages get freezes, blink, portals, conjuring, polymorph etc. 
---
Collect 4 things that were on a 10 minute timer, so it could take a long time.
---
Ret and prot are not strong specs, why fix bugs that make a weak spec worse?
---
Fair enough, it may have explicit uses in PvE as well.
---
The gameplay we're seeing here tho is still something most players wouldn't want in the game at all. A 1v1 where there is truly no skill involved, just gear. A fight that's decided before it starts. Modern game design would say that's not healthy. Obv Classic had a lot of that to some extent but this is an extreme example.
---
Always bring out blueberry.
---
Of course this is an extreme example, that’s why it makes a good video. It also helps that frost mages usually have an overbearing matchup against warriors in the first place, so seeing an avenue/path to winning that matchup with something as simple as frost resist is appealing to warrior players. 
---
A combination of creating a log-in queue for over-popped factions and free transfer either from an over-popped faction to a server that is under-popped on the same faction, or x-faction.
---
Wanna stay where you are? that's fine, but there will be queues.
---
Friend wants to join you where you are? that's fine, but expect log-in queues.
---
Wanna stay on the same server community? that's fine, faction swap (solo or with your guild!)
---
Wanna stay on the same faction? that's fine, server hop (solo, or with your guild!)
---
As far as I can tell, just offering the free swap alone doesn't get people to move, this gives a detriment for over-popping that doesn't separate friends, combined with multiple options for escaping it.
---
Definitely looks brighter, but zooming allows you to see sharper edges, better shading (inside of the right arm and left side of shoulder/face) and even the buildings in the background have a slightly higher resolution. This is the kind of optimization that they were talking about while keeping with the same look and feel of Vanilla. Seems like they’re getting it right in my opinion.
---
That doesn't change the gameplay in that moment, which is wholly one-sided as a result of choices made prior to the duel. I think most game devs today would say that's not acceptable, either player should always have a chance however weighted.
---
The guild I raided with in vanilla was 100% a meth lab 
---
But how is his matchup against the other 26 specs in the game? He’s thrown all his eggs in one basket.
---
And sure game devs now babysit the players. Which is why live has lost all its appeal. Every class has an interrupt, and or silence, multiple gap closers or gap creators. They all function the same and have no creative ways to cover their own weaknesses.
---
Which is about the amount of time someone playing casually would take to get to 41...
---

&gt;What you want them to ban people for being ninjas?

I'm making a point that Loot Trading will be an incentive for more Ninja Looting and I'm trying to make people aware that it's not easy to report ninjas on retail...
---
&gt; Naming and shaming is by definition endangering the gaming experience for someone else...
---
So does ganking, yet that is allowed. Guess what, those ToS are written in such a way that Blizzard could always terminate your account. They are written by a team of lawyers to give as much power as they can to Blizzard to cover their butts. It is an overly generic statement that could apply to literally anything. You quitting in the middle of a dungeon technically is endangering of my and the party's gaming experience. Someone refusing to leave a raid instance that you have kicked could be considered endangering but it is allowed as it is also their lockout.
---
Oh by the way, calling people out on the forums will not get your account banned or terminated... It will only get you a forum ban and that is only if Blizzard bothers to go through the posts and cares. They treat the two things as separates. Given they don't care enough to supply GMs to bother with loot disputes I find it extremely unlikely they are going to bother trying to source and punish players for naming and shaming in game unless it is a massive amount of people are reporting the issue. Do they punish every person that repeats what is said? Or do they waste a massive amount of time trying to parse through logs to find the first person who said something? What about if it was said in a 3rd party chat first then multiple people bring it up in game around the same time but faster than possible for a single person to do? Yes by the ToS it is technically not allowed but neither is most actions since they can all be viewed in a negative light. 
---
&gt; Oh by the way, calling people out on the forums will not get your account banned or terminated... 
---
Try and fine a single naming and shaming post on any Blizzard forum since forever...
---
To be honest, I really just want it for that satisfying sound effect when you open it.
---
Is it  possible to level enchanting to max this way, assuming your character is high enough level?
---
To be completely honest, if you gave me these two pictures without labels and told me to point out which is which, I would have a hard time. But, you can clearly see that they tried to tweak + improve a couple of things such as the background which is always a nice thing.
---
&gt;Naming and shaming is by definition endangering the gaming experience for someone else...

So is ninja looting.

You mean when different people were added to the team like Brack who has ruined WoW? The guy who said you think you do but you don't, which stupid ret paladins are trying to make reality instead of plying Brack's current game they helped ruin? Ret Paladins are great DPS in BFA. Have a blast. Whole game sucks and all classes are basically the same, bur hey you got what you wanted. Sit in your grave and own it. Don't try to ruin WoW all over again.
---
God I loved the keyring. Gave a fun side progression that was immediately useful to those around you.
---
So are you going to be ok with removing reckoning bomb if they give you consistent dps like a dumb fury warrior? You can't keep both. Then you will cry you can't one shot rogues.

&gt;So is ninja looting.

Yes but that is allowed in wow and have always been allowed... In fact, ninja looting is physically impossible in wow so it can't be against the rules...

Go shaman. Level as Elemental and you can heal dungeons without a single point in resto which makes finding groups a breeze since you can fill two roles. You can probably heal some lower level stuff as enhancement but I'd bet the mana would run try quickly unless you kept an intellect set. Also while there are sure to be tons of priests and mages rolling on all the cloth, you can wear leather and mail, and there's nowhere near the same amount of competition for int stuff like that. Also you can have a shield and those are cool. If you get tired of casting you can always go melee.
---
I kind of dont like how a graphics "upgrade" entails that you just make things brighter and cleaner looking, old one has alot more personality imo.
---
So it's okay for some specs to have been fixed because they were lucky enough to be selected to do first But others are out of luck because they were last on the list and had to have their already planned changes implemented in TBC?

If you wanna drain tank I suggest you go demo spec into sacrifice demon and sacrifice your voidwalker. It gives you 3% hp/4 which is an insane amount of life regen. Pretty much let's you lifetap all you want without having to stop. I usually pull with shadowbolt -&gt;immolate/corruption-&gt;lifedrain/wand depending on pushback and if I need the healing. Because your hp regen is so high you want to keep your mana bar near full so you're always benefitting from each regen tick. If you're geared and you wanna get fancy with it you can juggle a feared mob while facetanking for increased efficiency. Due note you're giving up some +damage with this build so you will need atleast some gear.
---
I have seen no one complain about the lighting or anything since they give you a classic option and it's almost exact In fact the "lighting" difference is mainly just shadows. Set it to low and you basically have old WoW's "atmosphere". I HAVE seen people mention weather. You are basically talking about "haters" who don't exist and the weather question is a good one. Weather was pretty awesome in vanilla.  I'm not gonna say it was perfect or anything or that everyone liked it, with some of those awful filters, but many DID like it and if they can't match it exactly maybe heavy weather would be a nice middle ground. BTW you don't need low resolution pictures. People actually got into different zones in the Demo.

Drain life is actually very strong, not dps wise but for leveling it should 100% be used in every kill except for when chaining 3+. It is essentially a lifetap that damages the enemy. But warlock shouldn't be tanking much in pve anyways

Just to make one thing clear. ALL classes are optimal in ALL content. When you raid you need ALL classes and when you pvp you need ALL classes. All classes have specs for quests and all specs are viable and good in dungeons.
---
What you are talking about is healer-hybrid dps-specs that are not optimal in raids. That is by design. All helaer-hybrids was designed to be sup-par in raids as damage dealers.
---
And to answer your question. YES.

Weird comment. I can tolerate anything from within Vanilla patches but not balance changes from outside Vanilla.
---
&gt; Either 1.0 forever or changes that were planned to happen in vanilla that were delayed til TBC due to timing constraints should be acceptable. 
---
I'm fine with any historical authentic vanilla content. Blizzard only have one backup from 1.12.1 so it's litterally impossible to get authentic historical content from earlier patches.
---
If that's what ret paladins want, sure.  
---
Why does cleanse have to be nerfed again? WotLK paladins have that and massive damage and its fine.   
---
&gt;When they did give you all this crap, then they had to give dps classes heals  
---
That's not how it works. Classes were given heals so they could do the same content.  
---
Nobody is saying that everyone should be able to do all content. But they should be able to participate.   
---
&gt;Now all classes are the same and the game is horrible 
---
Nice meme.  
---

---

No, you can't level easily by disenchanting, and on top of that going above apprentice rank enchanting requires a higher level. I think there might also be level requirements on enchanting rods too, but not positive. 
---
I can't say with 100% certainty but I think they do stack
---
Im sad because I recognize someone obviously making up a lie? Haha okay

It's actually hilarious how delusional you are. He did that to not make Esfand look like an idiot or his audience, which is mostly ret paladins. He flat out says the entire design of the class was made to be easy right here and that it was intentional.

https://classicdb.ch/?spell=26023
---
People forget that Blizzard had to quickly change the game so that you could only need on items that were a certain armor type, shortly after adding loot trading.
---
And this was because of all the ninja looting happening...
---
In classic such a system could not work as paladins need cloth and warriors need leather and mail and so on, so I don't see how with that being the case, blizzard could stand back and say ninja looting is impossible. I really hope they only allow loot trading for master looted items or something. 
---
Right looks richer 
---
40-man karazhan
---
I want bugs fixed because it makes sense. You dont remake a car that keeps breaking down - you figure out the problems and fix em. Not saying the game is broken but you can't fault blizzard for up holding their standard of releasing quality content.
---
Sight.... Naming and Shaming is not allowed in-game either... It's considerate harassment on the forum and it's considerate harassment in-game. Harassment is not allowed. Ninja is not considerate harassment.
---
How much of this is actually required. If you were in a purely progression guild just looking to clear could you need anything close to this or is this purely for speed running?
---
It's simple really. You only get a handful of items per boss kill. There are 40 members in a raid group. Those items are highly coveted. People want their bis loot. You're not gonna get the bis loot if you're playing feral/balance Druid/Ret etc. can you do it and get by? Yea. Is it less than optimal? Yes.
---
We did a semi guild semi pug MC run on a server that should not be named about a week ago. The cache after defeating Majordomo is not locked by ML so anyone can take the items.
---
We had a pug Hunter ninja the hunter quest item from it and leave the raid. We messaged the leader of his guild who asked for proof, we provided it and he was kicked from his guild. And everyone in our guild and the raid added him to our ignore list. Word will spread, trust me.

Can't warriors just zrage out of fear? So then it's really only ranged healers that need protection, and in raids, you don't need every priest to be dwarf. I think trolls are the best for pvp hands down though

Voidwalker. Dont even bother to get another pet til 60, you wont need it.
---
It's literally impossible to "improve" vanilla. As soon as you add changes to Vanilla it stops being Vanilla and becomes something different.
---
I want to play Vanilla. You want to play something different.

it was intended for chess players 
---
Vanilla is a solved game. If you don't like the reality of what your class will be doing at endgame then roll a different class that you can tolerate or don't play.
---
This relates to the wow forums not in game, naming and shaming has always been allowed and is still allowed in game. 
---
Forum rules are not the same as in game rules 
---
Don't take these posts seriously dude. Private server people responding and they have no idea what is required and what isn't. They overdo it by miles. I cleared most of naxx using pretty much 0 consumables in vanilla.
---
Like what? Trying to get a class changed and buffed  meant for new players and small children from 2004 every day on this forum or the WoW Classic forum?
---
Another warlock. SL lock has 0 bad matchups, period. They have a massive health pool, massive damage reduction, a massive shield, and incredible sustain dps + cc + kite potential. Shamans could be problematic in wpvp due to purge, but Orc = problem solved. So really, only an opposing warlock who banishes your pet will be the most challenging opponent. Again, in wpvp, anyone can jump you and give a good fight, especially rogues.
---
Is Naming and shaming considerate harassment?
---
Nah just one where you aren't posting batshit crazy posts every 4 hours
---
No. It’s considered naming and shaming 
---
If I can prove to you that it's considerate harassment. Will you change your mind?
---
Yeah Chinese gold farmers were 10x worse lol 
---
Considered*
---
The atmosphere of Tirisfal does feel more appropriate for a lock, but the first ten levels is a very short amount of your time in the march to 60. You can always head to silverpine forest after durotar if you wanted.
---
Wahhh let me keep everything that warriors don't have but make me do the same damage and also one shot people. Wahhhhhh.
---
I don't think ANY pve in wow is a challenge, it's more like the dumbest person in the raid finally "getting it". Maybe if you're speedrunning it. Other than that, if you have half a brain fighting a scripted battle shouldn't pose a challenge to you. So I wonder what do people actually expect from pve, for some it will be just a sense of accomplishment, getting the hours in, for others - means of getting gear for pvp. If the challenge is your goal, you probably should look for it in different aspects of the game, or a different game.
---
As I stated though, it’s allowed in game perhaps just not in the forums 
---
He never stated that this wasn't on a pserver. Why are you acting so salty over someone who's just having fun and sharing experiences?
---
&gt; we do NOT call people out here on the forums, that is considered harassment

Naming and Shaming is considerate harassment. Harassment is against the rules on all Blizzard platforms and forums and chats. The rules never actually mention "naming and shaming" anymore.
---
Who are you and why dies everyone downvote you?
---
I’d make a Warrior, buy an epic weapon for every 10 levels, level up engineering and blacksmithing, and destroy the world. 
---
But in reality I’ll just make a Warrior and be an undergeared peasant because I’ll never be rich.
---
I dont hate any of them seeing as I'm only there for 2 hours or whatever.
---
Most favorite, teldrassil, maximum comfy (minus Barrow dens)
---
Least favorite would be mulgore because its so.. open
---
Yeah no. Most of this is not required by any means.
---
Considered* 
---
Imagine being so delusional that you think a guest 14 years removed from something, trying to be nice to the hosts (Esfand plays ret) and most of their audience (people that never raided until WOTLK like Tips Out) = reality, when he flat out told you the class design in a panel with media in front of all the other WoW designers who didn't disagree with him or talk about chess lol.
---
The "challenge" as he said was balancing too much autoplay AFK class design, with having nothing to do.
---
Then you have to make the argument that something is harassment on a forum but not in a chat...
---
You just proved my point “we don’t call people out on the forums” calling people out on forums is considered harassment on the forums.
---
Calling people out is not considered harassment in game.
---
Loot trading should be raids only this sounds like a solid solution. 
---
Naming and shaming is allowed in game, that’s the only argument you really need 
---
Sure. But its not "vanilla".  
---
Its Classic. I want to play Classic.  
---
And btw. You are already going to play improved "vanilla". Even the private servers you played on were improved.  
---
You will never have vanilla wow as it was back then. You are going to play on the patch with the most improvements in a content they were not made for.  
---
Enjoy your "vanilla".  
---
Consumable aren’t required most of the time, at least up until the end of bwl. Your main tanks will generally want a flask and as many buffs as possible, but no consumables are really required for most of the raid. 
---
Your a bit of a dick if you don’t bring some mana/health pots, your putting a lot more strain on the other healers. 
---
It may get more difficult in aq and naxx but I don’t have much experience with them. 
---
good argument  
---
You spelled AB wrong 
---
play forever
---
Loatheb requires greater shadow resist for every pull. If you wipe this boss can easily cost your raid upwards of 1k+ collective gold. Good luck killing 4horse without any resistance potions. Even easy fights like thaddius become just so much easier with resistance pots any good raid leader is gonna require your raiders to bring them as every wipe bc you slacked is less time spent progressing through bosses. If your guild survived long enough to this point you're likely long used to it.
---
Telling people to go play BFA if they want a changed Paladin class isn't "batshit crazy". It's what the leads on Classic told people to do.

 **BB**: We don't have any plans to make changes to any of the balancing in 1.12. We're starting with 1.12 because we feel like it's the most complete and balanced version of the game that was available at that period. That's where we're starting at, because we feel like it was very complete. I don't wanna say that we wouldn't listen to the community, obviously because the community's passion and feedback are really important and we really believe that every voice matters. We're always listening. But we do wanna make sure that we get this authentic recreation**, because if you want the modern balance changes, we have those in Battle for Azeroth.** If we wanted to get what we would do today, we have that. It's already available. But we don't have what we did back then, and we wanna give back people what we did back then, especially on things like class balance and that authentic gameplay experience and those authentic gameplay systems the way that they worked.  
---
Mulgore is a bish because of how long you have to run everywhere, especially with a big Tauren, because it feels extra slow.  
---
However, the bright sunny green fields and Native theme is just relaxing and makes me feel happy. 
---
&gt; And btw, you are already going to play improved "vanilla". Even the private servers you played on were improved. 
---
I know, but do you know what. No vanilla server have ever balanced specs... No Vanilla server have never used feature, talents or adjusted numbers from classes and specs to make some dps specs more or less viable. They ALL try to be authentic with the game play. Sure some use different respec costs, dynamic respawn, but no one have used different talents or numbers for ret palas...
---
ye it's still 25h/week, but only like 4-8 in raids and rest in farming (though it's less than in vanilla)
---
Bad graphics on both sides, Disappointing.
---
"We know vanilla means vanilla." -Ion Hazzikostas, talking about Classic WoW
---
You don't want classic. Stop trying to pretend you do and ruining it for the people who *do* want it.
---
Yeah I said most. And yeah Loatheb is the one you really need it on. The others? Not so much. Consumables makes everything easier yes, but required on anything but the tanks with the exception of Loatheb? No.
---
"They hated him because he told them the truth."
---
I think this is where you can make your argument.  Naming and shaming is NOT endangering the game experience for someone else.  Their bad behavior endangered their own experience, NOT your calling attention to it.
---
Worth a shot.
---
Battle Royal mode confirmed after Naxx. Yeet!
---
Cross-realm-anything and sharding are different things, one does not necessarily bring another.
---
Right one looks better tho.
---
I don't even care to be honest. It's not a debate. I don't care either way. I'm just writing facts...
---
It takes that other guild having integrity to do this, but yes this is the way it should happen.  If there are guilds that don't care or a community that doesn't care it won't work of course.
---
There was a guild on a recent private server that would start a 40 man MC PUG, get everyone saved to their Raid ID, only to find out that that Raid ID was for an already cleared MC.  They basically screwed people out of their MC lock-out repeatedly, intentionally.  
---
Nothing you can do about those people.  I truly hope the scenario you listed above is the gold standard that 99% of WoW Classic player adhere to.
---
Hopefully Blizzard makes WoW 2 and if they don't someone else will. Star Wars Galaxies was great at one time. EQ was great at one time. Ultima Online was great pre Trammel. MMO's didn't start with WoW. Vanilla just did a goob job at having a theme park with enough open world and community to work. Every expansion made that worse. Blizzard is who killed MMO's. Not all their fault. A playerbase of idiots who never played MMO's before WoW lobbied for changes like they still do on Classic. They don't understand why things are the way they are, because they simply either don't care, are ignorant of MMO's before WoW or are simply stupid.
---
Whiners wrecked every MMO btw. Whiners got Trammel in UO. Whiners got wellfare Jedi's in SWG. Whiners made minigames the priority in WoW and destroyed class design asking for impossible balance.
---
&gt;We know vanilla means vanilla
---
&gt;btw let me bring in some changes that I think are for the better of the game  
---
&gt;btw we also won't do real vanilla but pseudo one like private servers coz why would we waste resources when you !diots eat that shit up :)    
---
-Ion Hazzikostas, talking about Classic WoW  
---
&gt;You don't want classic  
---
I very much do. Original WoW with the original idea behind the game and further beyond. Can't wait to play it and in the future to vote for improvement so all you brainlets that can only spam 1 button will cry :)  
---
You're constantly posting super toxic responses to ill-informed players who post maybe 1 topic a week. And you post back to back to back posts addressing them, it's like you just want to hear yourself rage. Nowhere in your past 3 posts do you comment with any sort of tact about how they should look to BFA. You're just super toxic
---
Voidwalker mostly however if you go the draintanking route there are ppl that swear with imp once you get Dark Pact.
---
I however have never done draintanking as a lvling method so take it with a grain of salt. Try it and see how you like it.
---
Pandaria dungeons in time travelling mode. Forever. With myhic+ mode.
---
&gt;Sure. But its not "vanilla".
