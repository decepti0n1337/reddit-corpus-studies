No.

---
You would know...
---
I'm 19 now and started at the same time as you both with pservers and retail. Went from raiding in a top 300 guild on retail WoD to playing vanilla because i felt more rewarded for the time i put in. With that said i will probably never go back to retail with the path the game has taken. Cleared Naxx on Lightbringer a few months ago and cant wait for classic to do it again on official servers. So i'll rather do the vanilla content twice than play on retail.
---
Wrathbaby here! Started during the scourge event. Horrible time to be a noob tbh.. ghouls everywhere! But yeah can't wait for Classic. 
---
Badass
---
Doing this sort of thing using Guest WiFi is probably fine. The fact that you can even open a non-standard port and pass encrypted traffic over it would indicate that there is no firewall or content filter on that network.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you were to try this sort of thing on even a reasonably well secured corporate network it wouldn't work as no competently configured firewall would allow traffic of this sort to pass through it. You could try to set up a VPN to funnel the traffic through a standard internet port but people like me are paranoid about data exfiltration using this method and employ tools to catch you if you try. 
---
I'm 26, started playing in TBC. Not sure when exactly, but I was raiding up to Magtheridon on farm, can't remember if we had much progress in Serpentshire Cavern. I'm interested in Classic, not sure if I'll start straight away. Might let the dust settle first and see how balanced the servers are before I choose one 
---
I started when I was 11. I'm 25 now... Am I old? :(
---
They need more buttons. I would totally buy one if it was like the razed naga. 
---
Sharding shouldn't exist, but I can kinda see the problem with loot trading. Either you get it or you don't. If somebody looks an item, they aren't going to trade it for you. If anything it encourages MORE ninja looting. If an awesome *insert class item* drops, my friends will all need it too so they can trade it to me 
---
Cat is an incredibly leveling spec and, in raids, is shit only in the hands of casuals. 
---
Bear is not shit, and tanked many raid bosses in Vanilla. They are also desired as off-tanks.
---
There is always at least one raid spot guaranteed to resto druids. 
---
There are a couple of resto specs (feral+resto, balance+resto) that are viable in pvp. In fact, resto druids are probably the absolute best flag carriers in WSG.
---
Crit chickens are not a great pvp spec, but some people swear by them. Their mana problems are not an issue here.
---
The problem with druid is that NONE of these specs excel in their role (except flag carriers) so the class gets shat on for that reason. Everyone wants to dominate in the class of their choice, and vanilla druids do not allow that. It is a challenging class to play, but it is by no means unplayable unless you are trying to shoehorn a particular spec into a particular role (i.e. raiding as a boomkin).
---
This made me think - if Classic really is "no change" will we have random stats on gear again? Like mail hunter armour having spirit on it? We could do without that.. 
---
Yup this is vanilla wow way to capture it Staysafe. Mained Horde in 05 so I did t have to get in hour long zone wide debates about DM
---
That thing was a piece of shit. I couldn’t believe how bad it was. 
---
Hell yes.
---
It’s bad. People nowadays know how to deal with enhance shamans so your life will be pretty rough. And the gearing up is awful. 
---
So...we get Naxx released AND the pvpers all leave? 
---
Sounds like a win-win.
---
 Nah man, they've earned the right for that rite. 
---
Can I get a USB instead of disks?  But i more than likely would yes.
---
Curse you legions of players who can't get over your nostalgia for the things you did when you were 3 or 4 years old!  Why can't you just be nostalgic about your macaroni art and gummy bears instead?
---
Just need a sub. It’s a way to get people to play both Classic and Retail. 
---
This is pokemon
---
Nope. There’s some very authentic private servers out there that you can level on. 
---

---
Yes hunter gear will have spirit again. We could not do without that. 
---
I destroyed mine tanking through ICC. Had to get a new one shortly after we downed LK.
---
Hi all, 
---
I'm stuck deciding between shaman, warlock, and priest. 
---
My main objectives in classic is to be decent in PVE leveling, at least "ok" in raiding, because I'll be raiding pretty mediocre as opposed to casual or hardcore min/max, and to be decent in pvp. I'm not really worried about being the absolute best in anything, but I do want to have a good time which implicates competence at some level. 
---
I originally mained a shaman in vanilla and I really love the hybrid feel. Being able to cast damage, melee, and heal are awesome, and the leveling experience is super fun for me.  My main issue for the shaman is being pigeon holed into resto. I don't mind healing on raids but I'd prefer not to constantly respec for farming / pvp.  
---
Another minor concern with the shaman is the insane amount of action bars and spells to keep track of. It wasn't a problem for me in vanilla, but I also could have just been really bad as I didn't keybind to anything near the level I see discussed on the forums today. 
---
The warlock seems fun because of the easy leveling experience and ability to farm. Plus being viable on one spec - SM/Ruin for pvp/pve/raiding. The free mount seems awesome too. 
---
My biggest concern with the warlock is soul shards. If I'm going to be raiding during the week - I know having to log in early before raids to farm is going to get annoying fast, if I can even pull it off with my busy schedule.
---
Another minor concern with the warlock is competition. Unlike vanilla, it seems everyone and their dog wants to be a warlock in classic, which for me kind of makes it less desirable for me. I guess I like being a special snowflake. 
---
The priest class seems really fun. It seems like an interesting class and it's game play seems fun to me during the leveling up phase.  I wouldn't mind healing on a priest because it wouldn't feel like I'm giving up most other aspects of the class to pigeon hole one particular flavor.  It would also be really fun to pvp as shadow for a bit. I'm not really that into pvp healing. 
---
My main concern with the priest is seemingly little ability to farm, and I'm not sure how long I would actually like to heal as a main role in general. I also like some level of self sufficiency that the priest may lack in end game.  I'm not sure how priest population will be, but I know they're always super desired in groups. 
---
So what do you all think?  Should I stick with my original main (shaman) for a second go around?  Or try something new?  This is such a big decision because I'd hate to invest months of game play to get to 60, only to be disappointed by a lackluster end game experience. 
---
FWIW - I'd be going orc warlock, Tauren shaman, or undead priest. I identify most with the Tauren shaman personality wise, I absolutely love the undead newbie zones and theme leveling up, and I hate the orc starting zones and don't feel too strongly about the orc character models, but I feel any other choice for a warlock is clearly inferior. The starting zones/theme is only a very small portion of the whole experience after all. 
---
One of my main goals here is to not succumb to altaholism which seems to be deeply imbedded in my DNA. 
---
Sorry what is clicking?
---
You won't play on the strictly vanilla servers just because other servers exist?
---
Because many people clicked back then. Even legendary players like Hydra clicked some skills in TBC. Nowadays a clicker cannot get past 1250. 
---
?
---
You’re right. But tanks do need some fire resis for Rag. 
---
wow that false quote that doesn't reflect what I said at all. Good job.
---
Some people still believe that. Although the rogue one is pretty good. 
---
I’m 20, started when I was maybe 7 or 8. Think it was late TBC/early Wrath. I miss the old world and how immersive it was. Wish I was old enough to actually be good at the game pre cata so I’m excited to be able to go back and really get into it!  
---
I really wonder how people like you are going to react when blizzard gets a million little things wrong with Classic. Because they will get many, many things wrong. Are you going to ignore it all? 
---
[removed]
---
I started in TBC but Druids were a force to be reckoned with in PVP for awhile
---
Yes, I would.
---
&gt; The reason Classic WoW is coming is because players want the original game.
---
Personally I want the design decisions that went into the original game. The specifics don't really matter much to be.
---
EVERYONE was clicking back then though. Skill was just determined with who clicked faster. Nowadays it's different.
---
EU4 is a clearly superior game 
---
The most common myth was that killing bosses in a certain spot or in a certain way increases the odds of rare items like mounts dropping. 
---
Welcome. 
---
Most of the hunter pieces are pretty good too, close to being pre-raid BiS. Very high Agility which hunters get a lot of value out of.
---
I mained Druid from TBC to BFA. 
---
But going back to what they were in vanilla? That’s a no from me dawg. 
---
Instead I’ll be playing their nature-loving cousin class: Shaman
---
I think they can wait longer than they do on Private servers. 4-5 months after Naxx came out, there was still a decently healthy 3-4K people on before they merged the realms in preparation for the new one. The old one only really died when fresh came out and there was just 400 people on, to where there’s just 200 now.
---
Here’s what I think a solid idea is. Release WoW Classic. 8-12 months after Naxx, release BC. Simultaneously, release a fresh realm PVP/PVE for each region, if there are enough subs for that. After 2 weeks to a month, merge the dead/wounded Vanilla servers so there is still a post-Naxx community available, and a place for you to play your elite toon you worked so hard on.
---
Merges are never pretty but it’s better than just having a bunch of dead realms when the masses inevitably move on to fresh Vanilla or BC.
---
Edit: was messages that my original comment was deleted for mentioning private server names, so this is an edited comment.
---
Ehh not really. Shadow Priests need good gear to shine. R14 gear specifically because it gives them more HP than a tank. An undergeared Spriest is an easy pray for any melee or Hunter. Not to mention they go oom after 3 spells. 
---
Warrior has one of the lowest skill ceilings in the game. 
---
More DRs...
---
I agree with Hunters being very braindead but very strong early on in Classic. And later on in AQ gear things like Elly Shaman, Shadow Priest, and Warlock can melt faces with little effort. 
---
DA:O is amazing 
---
Dude you got to level 41. That’s 2 days of playing. I’ve leveled to 60 over 5 times because of server shut downs and you’re crying over level 41?? 
---
Streaming wasn't popular before crz.  I agree It'll be the biggest issue for larger streamers, which is why they already said they'd be rolling on pve servers.
---
If you like Dwarves and Priests, I say go for it. It's the best race to be if you want to be an Alliance Priest. Fear Ward is a beast.
---
I personally will be going Undead Warlock as that's what I've played since Cataclysm but never got to in classic thru wotlk (mained a hunter). 
---

Gnome warrior.  
---
I leveled my gnome warrior as an alt in vanilla almost as a joke, but I loved the brutality of the attacks. She ended up being my 2v2 arena character in TBC, and then my main in Wrath.  
---
I love the fantasy idea of a tiny character wielding a huge sword that weighs 3x her weight, and swinging it with ease. In Wrath when I got Shadowmourne, I went in to arena to test it out, and I killed a tauren druid inside a global cooldown after proc + switch. It was hilarious to see a tiny gnome kill a massive tauren with ease.  
---
I also love female undead warriors for this same reason.  
---
Warrior specifically: I already said I enjoy the brutal attacks, but I also really like tanking, and I like the tanking style of a shield wielding class. Tanking on a warrior is just as fun for me as DPS'ing. Tanking also takes me out of my comfort zone and forces me to lead the group, which I did during Ulduar and ICC 10 man heroic/achievement farming groups. I was super quiet before those events, and then I actually had to leave the group on vent and it was a new experience for me.  
---
I really wish I could change title. I'm trying to make it a discussion, that also helps me maybe.
---
I rolled undead warlock as my first toon when I first started, but joined a different server.So I never went back, but I still have nostalgia for it. :)
---
They always resist a lot. You have a 1% chance to get a resist so when you pull 15 mobs you’re bound to get a frost nova or blizzard or Coc resist. 
---
Thanks for the kind words. Many things will more than likely be confusing and weird for new players, and they won't see the value in following a thought out guide before it's too late, but that's part of the fun. You need to suffer some in order for it to feel particularly good when you eventually do something well. I made it so a handful more friends would make it to 60 and have no interest in marketing it aggressively so many won't have a clue it even exists. Who knows, maybe by the time people start wanting to level another character it will be high enough on google results.
---
If you like it now, you might be happy to know that I'm in the process of nuking the warrior class quests from the standard route and adding a new section for all the class quests so users can pick and choose what to do. This time of year is particularly busy for CS majors because of internships, but I'm trying to squeeze in work here and there.
---
lol I was watching roguecraft 1 the other day and people claiming how broken rogues were when there was SO much counterplay to basically everything in the whole video.
---
Most people just went afk after they got cheapshotted
---
I'm 18, and I'm gonna be playing the feces out of classic
---
Also: I have played wow since 2005
---
I also love warriors, but I like the idea of healing one in classic, for comradery.
---
May be what's influencing me. I really hope I can meet a cool warrior to heal when classic launches.
---
“My pet can tank it...”
---
Good job lads. New blood is more than welcome
---
&gt; I started in TBC but Druids were a force to be reckoned with in PVP for awhile
---
In late TBC/WotLK, there was no class spec I could not reliably kill 1v1 except for pure healing specs. Even when 3.0 first came out and ret pallies were temporarily insane, I could play about 50/50 with them. There were just so many class tools available that, with time, an experienced feral could wreck so much shit. It was unfair, to be honest.
---
The answer is always gnome, anything else is unacceptable.
---
Cross realm BG's were around in vanilla so it's very likely that will make a return.  
---
Personally I hope they only do cross realm BG's at certain off peak times of the day when queue times are too long. But then and only then.
---
what is confusing? one is a video, the other is a book
---
I'm 15.
---
Your best option is to watch video guides from private servers that are close to retail, or to read up on the many guides that get posted here ... honestly though I would encourage going into classic knowing as little as possible, as it would be more of an adventure, thats just me though.
---
Epic gamer moments in history
---
I would rather them just bring back the Trading Card Game. Hearthstone is gay but the tcg was legit. 
---
The backpedal made for a quick escape!
---
I started playing late 2005/early 2006 when I was around 8! So I'm lucky to have gotten the taste of vanilla wow, so it will be extra special to experience it again, this time with a lot more knowledge. Super excited for release
---
Dwarves though. Lol 
---
They get a pass but they're on thin ice
---
Aye. I just love their lore (in other iterations) personality and looks. :)
---
Yeah I actually like dwarves too because I loved gimli growing up...someone's gotta play those thicc bois
---
I'm 21, can't wait for classic :) we need to bring back good games!
---
No
---
That's actually why I like them. Lol.
---
Dwarf Priests are very desirable for their fear ward. Can’t go wrong with it.
---
I’m going Mage. Probably Human because I like the diplomacy racial. 
---
Welcome
---
Vanilla players. Us just starting will be Classic players. Personally I'm a wrathbaby. 
---
I think the collector pets and such are a sure thing. I’m betting they’ll come with the next Blizzcon ticket.
---
Druids definitely made me rage quit BGs for the day 😂
---
Old Maggy is a pushover!
---
Players of a superior game? 
---
The best pocket healer for a warrior is a paladin. Might consider that.  
---
It is? Due to bubbles hurting rage?
---
PUMP THE STOCKS
---
That’s not true at all. Stance dancing was a huge thing for warriors in PvP. So many crucial PvP abilities were spread across all 3 stances. Switching stances also dumped a lot of your rage and would change how much damage you would do and take. A great warrior has a handle on all of this. There’s a lot of intricate timing and skill involved if you want to play a warrior correctly in PvP. 
---
sstvNPC Classic WoW is pure nostalgia sstvNPC Classic WoW will not succeed without class updates sstvNPC Classic WoW needs transmog sstvNPC
---
The problem is Naxx gear breaks the game.
---
BWL and early AQ is where the game is most balanced. Naxx gear pretty much makes resilience a necessity as you blow things up and it'd make any new raid tiers trivial.
---
EverQuest had a great system to make expansions without adding levels. IMO, Vanilla could've made gear iLvls between tiers much, much less pronounced. But WoW is already designed- I don't see them making any changes. 
---
Im 17 and I’ll try world of warcraft out, never played it before.
---
It’s vc. Dm is dire maul. 
---
lol? I was watching sodapoppin and reckful with more than 10k viewers each in cata, way before crz.
---
All day baby 
---
Two BM Hunter pets could for sure
---
&amp; very legal
---
Yes - and just for a copy of the collector's edition OST. I would love a physical copy of all the beautiful music in the game. 
---
Reincarnates?
---
Bitter vets
---
lmn
---
Does bad DPS even with full consumes, but you can keep Nightfall up while giving real DPS totems. A guild might take you simply because they need shamans and there aren't enough resto shamans.
---
Ele is a top PvP spec when geared.
---
Old balls bruv.
---
It's DM, and DM is also DM
---
Dual wielding as an arms warrior 
---
Doesn't exist? I thought this was about raiding after Naxx, where I'd presume all gear from and possibly before Naxx is what is being checked by the fights.
---
Old Dogs
---
It is good pre raid gear. You are confusing the word good with best, and that's a huge issue I see top frequently. It is not the BEST pre raid gear, but it is still good.
---
Lol that guild chat
---
If your brain can’t tell your finger to lift off shift when it’s not needed than you are probably more than retarded. You are hopeless.
---
Like I said, stay stupid, these binds are too advanced for you. 
---
I feel like enchanting is an end game profession that will only see profits with the best of the best enchants.  You might as well get that lvl 5 alt at the very beginning of the server and have him be your disenchanter.  I’d lvl with skinning and keep a few leathers to craft goggles while you eventually lvl engineering.  Once DM is released you can skin the dog packs in DM N.  You can drop skinning for engineering once you get your epic mount. 
---
dont worry my man if its anything like private servers you will be surprised half my guild is around 20
---
Recolor? T2 was entirely redesigned for all classes. 
---
The video you're linking is just talking about the book. I'm confused because you are implying that they somehow are relaying the same information 
---
You can’t rank up in pick pocketing. You rank up in lockpicking. 
---
I leveled to 60 as Assassination.
---
Vanilla Veterans
---
Vanilla Generation. VAG for short.
---
Pathetic
---
Yeah you know what I mean, it was just a placeholder item 🙂 
---
Yeah it will be a thing. But you’re mostly going to face other 19 twinks. The days of one shotting level 11 Mages are long gone. 
---
Why are you here??? LOL
---
I like this one the best.
---
I remember one of my friends did the level 30 warrior quest for the 2h axe. I helped him all the way and it was so long the quest line. When he finally did the last part and got the axe, he disenchanted it by mistake. And before a gm could restore it, he was 40 plus. Was so funny, he just said, where did it go?! And then when realizing what happened just screamed noooooo. 
---
Oh man.
---
sharding the starting zones for the first couple days of release would be the only time id want sharding in
---
Your peanut brain can't imagine a scenario where you might have to jump while using a spell bound with a shift modifier. wow.
---
Also in the top US guild
---
More specs as warlock than mage? Strongly disagree there. Warlock has smruin, dsruin, SL, and Nightflag. Anything else? Mage has deep Frost PvP, deep Frost pve, deep fire for pve, AP Frost, AP Fire, and Frostfire elemental.
---
This is coming from someone who mained mage and is leaning towards warlock. One of the plusses for lock for me is the pvp/pve versatility of sm/ruin and not having too many specs to worry about. 
---
But elemental mage is oftly tempting...
---
Vanilla saggers? 
---
W E L C O M E 
---
I'm not OP and I don't have any screenshots or anything but i've definitely seen it happen on recent major private servers.
---
Classic Dads
---
Fair enough, thanks for the correction. I meant, I didn't understand how anyone actually used pickpocketing. It seemed impossible to me.
---
My recollection of twinking was everything feeling slow and boring. Might end up making a 39 twink, since engineering is phenominal in that bracket.
---
They shouldn’t bring it back. I bought one to upgrade from my MX518. 
---
The paint wore off the buttons in a few months the the right click failed at the 6 month mark. Binned it and got my MX518. 
---
I think steel series make a competent mmo mouse as an alternative to the naga. Let’s leave this failure of a mouse in the bin. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **7th Cakeday** projectmars! ^(hug)
---
I've played 19,29 and 39 since tbc and plan to pick a bracket too play in classic. Likely 29 because its pre travel form druids. Might roll a 19 again out of boredom eventually. 
---
Second NoLife
---
Im going to spread this myth like the plague come live just for fun. 
---
Dwarf ret paladin. I've never played ret and dont plan too raid this time around. Warrior is my normal go too but 4 xpacs of tanking burnt me out. 
---
If I decide I want too raid I'll roll an alt that people wont laugh at. 
---
Well I should have been more specific. Were you wanting to heal with a warrior in PVE only or PVP as well?  
---
If you want to heal a warrior in PVP then yes, paladin is the god of PVP healing. Made even better with a warrior. Blessing of freedom, plate armor means warrior has to protect his healer less, no bubbles for rage starve, BoP in nuke situations. There's a ton of good stuff.  
---
But what if for the post-Naxx raid having Naxx gear wasn't enough for the average Naxx raider? To do the post-Naxx raid without seeing a spike in difficulty would require gear that is *stronger* than what is found in Naxx, and the only way to get gear like that is from the post-Naxx raid.
---
So there's a conundrum: to get the better gear requires you to already have the better gear. It can't be done. So to breach the gap you have to rely on something other than better gear. You and your raid group have to be *better* than the average Naxx raid group. You can't just out-gear the spike. You have to face it head-on.
---
Oh my gosh I forgot this. When I was new to the game I was in the typical horrible leveling guild. There was this weirdo that every time someone joined he would say “welCUM” like it was the cleverest thing in the world.
---
I loved T2 before it was reskinned. You could tell pretty quickly when you're about to die. Rogue opens on you and he has that generic red helm? You're pretty much boned.  
---
I plan on having a 19 and a 29 twink.
---
I guess I should have stated more quality of life builds.
---
Mage has a lot of builds, none of them come close to performing across the board like smruin.
---
even a ds build offers more versatility.
---
Planning on having two twinks. Level 19 bracket and a 39 bracket druid.  
---
Not sure what I'll be doing in the 19 bracket yet.  
---
In my guild you could see Ragnaros in there if you zoomed into first person and looked closely enough. 
---
Nice
---
Can you post a source for this? I don't think it specified that anywhere.
---
I also have been playing wow off and on since beta. I remember the open stress test where you were stuck in the looting position. I remember the night before launch where demons and chickens attaches crossroads and the chickens launched players up in the air real high. 
---
I’m here just to call you pathetic though 
---
Pathetic for being old
---
I had a hunter that I got all the way to ashenvale, level 16 or so, without getting my pet. That was my first character, and I couldn’t figure out why the game was so hard.
---
Definitely! Had some really fun times on my 29 holy priest.
---
Did u tho
---
level 20 lfg dm gee it must be dire maul
---
A buddy and I were famous for camping the crossroads on our two is (hunter and rogue). We used to sit there for hours an get big crowds of level 10-20 to gang up on us. Great times!
---
I shouldnt but probably. 
---
And the new books will be printed on toiletpaper anyway. 
---
&gt;  There’s no way a reprint wouldn’t slash the price of the originals
---
There are still originals for sale in 2018?
---
Pathetic together 
---
gen xers?
---
I played back in vanilla and I've played a handful of private servers, the extremely casual players are the minority, which is the player you are describing. Most of the really casual players won't make it to level 60, and vanilla WoW is a *very* hardcore MMO compared to modern WoW. Everyone has a different idea of what fun is in vanilla and that's what is so cool about it, but mark my words, the majority of people will care about making their character the best they can. Min/maxing is really fun in vanilla and the fact of the matter is that some specs and classes are just flat out inferior. That being said, I cannot stress enough that people should just play what they want and how they want, but don't project your playstyle onto the majority of classic wow players when it is objectively false. Also, using a dps addon does not make a player toxic, sure people who post the charts after every encounter are annoying but when used properly it should be a tool to help you improve as a player. It takes a lot of coordination and effort to get 40 people to work together to progress through raid content and most guild leadership is going to have expectations that people will carry their own weight.

PvE makes a lot of sense. When I do play on a PvP server I usually go out of my way to avoid it anyhow because of the annoyance that can accompany it. I live in the Mountain Time Zone myself.

did that say staysafe lol?  Hey are you staysafe from nost/lightbringer.

PvP sever - burning steppes - Alliance.
---
Horde hunter attacked me and another ally player just outside the FP. 
---
I was highly uneducated in the mechanics of the hunter class and proceeded to focus on the pet whilst my temporary companion soloed the hunter. 
---
We won, no thanks to my companion, and he proceeded to give me the biggest bake about pvp/hunter mechanics I’ve ever received. Mind you, it was totally deserved. 
---
Logged out, rolled a hunter to learn more and took his message with me to this day. 
---
Pretty sure after I received his advice I said something stupid like “I panicked” his response was definitely along the lines of “don’t”.
---
Simple but effective WoW lesson.
---
Hunter is perfect for you then. Theres like 5-6 abilities in rotation, the option to keep going without manabreaks (autoattack and pet dmg works too) and a legit dynamic with how you manage your pet hp heals in relation to your mana.
---
THere's a small science to it. Super rewarding and fun solo class.
---
I was running a Deadmines group and my IRL friend thought it would be funny to delete my hearthstone while I wasn’t looking. I got so pissed I punched him in the balls and we started fighting. I thought he permanently deleted my hearthstone. I found out a few mins later you can just get another from your innkeeper. Felt pretty stupid after that

Yeah, 19 has always felt a little braindead to me though. Will definetly hit up the 29-39-49 brackets though.
---
I'm 20 so not too young but I started in MoP and have pretty much zero knowledge of Vanilla. Guess that's a good and bad thing lol. Just hoping to play an MMO which allows me to invest time and get equal reward as well as having a sense of community that a lot of people talk about.
---
3 BM Hunters can tank pretty much any 5 man without too much trouble.
---
back to Windfury totem and Hamstring spam. 
---
You’re completely outclassed by mortal strike as a fury warrior unfortunately 
---
Dude dm had mad loots. Well worth the run over for horde players. 
---
Wondering why pallys tanks couldn't get aggro when I opened every pull with a pyroblast.  I didn't understand the concept of aggro until almost 60.
---
Carried a sword on my mage to melee things if I ran out of mana.
---
Completely ignored wands.
---
Leveled up blacksmithing on the same character.
---
This gave me PTSD
---
Basically these also i will put up with sharding at launch in the starting areas only but i would prefer they did not.
---
I feel you man.  Took me 289 hours to get to 60 on my paladin and the server is progressing to TBC.  From what I've heard that's a death sentence for private servers.  I never would have rolled that server if I knew from the get go that they were going to move on to the next expansion.
---
This seems pretty good. Imp scream and silence are both super strong in pvp.
---
Impressive considering crossroads isn't contested territory.
---
I also see some keys before a key ring, and an AV battle commendation.
---
&gt; Stamina usually bought you the most EHP, which was useful when your healers weren't quite as attentive.
---
That's ultmatly what my guild's raid leaders decided too.  Having super high migration actually reduced threat generation, which is why my guild's MT sucked ass holding aggro, while the OT who stacked mostly STA had mobs stick like glue because of the extra rage from less migration.
---
No u. It's VC.
---
My guild used to bring 15-20 warriors to raid.  Vael's left expectancy was about 10 seconds after hitting 20%. We couldn't understand why other guild's strugled on him.
---
Im currently 19 and have been playing private servers since I was 15 when the Elysium project came back up with the nost servers. I started playing in TBC when I was 7 when my dad set up an account for me and we played together. I've leveled 2 60's and raided into mid AQ40 on one of them (had to stop because I got my first job RIP). Now I long for getting into Naxx on actual classic but hope that I have enough time now. 
---
I absolutely tanked a five man or two in BC as a BM hunter when our tank left the group and we didn’t wanna wait for a new one. 
---
Three druids capping BS, LM and mine before you even get to point A. It's gonna be great.
---
Don't forget 59 &lt;3 
---
On my hunter I didn't wear more than 30-40 FR on rag, mostly from MC set items.  I just topped off with tubers and banaids, and used a FR pot before the fight.  I'd get tells asking why I was #1 on DPS on the fight despite not having the best gear.  No one liked my awnser.  You can't do rag without tons of FR!

Im currently 19 and have been playing private servers since I was 16 when one of them came back in late 2016. I started playing in TBC when I was 7 when my dad set up an account for me and we played together. I've leveled 2 60's and raided into mid AQ40 on one of them (had to stop because I got my first job RIP). Now I long for getting into Naxx on actual classic but hope that I have enough time now.
---
Huh, never heard that one on my server.
---
If boss hits for 600 dmg @ 75% reduction = 150 dmg per hit / 3000 hp = 20 hits
---
If boss hits for 600 dmg @ 30% reduction = 420 dmg per hit / 10,000 hp = ~24 hits. 
---
4 extra hits could be a solid 2.5 seconds which would be a enough time to cast a heal off. So a argument can be made to stack stam.
---
It's honestly going to depend on what the community is like over time. I hope that they take enough time with these things that we don't just have Naxx cleared in a year and everyone bored/looking for something new or a reset. Let the game have it's lifespan and see what people actually want. I 100% believe people want Classic WoW, but until we have it on a Blizzard server with opportunities for development I don't think people really can know what should be next.
---
I'd like to see them watch the game and see how the communities develop.
---
I read that manual so many times lmfao
---
This would be the fury spec because you can raid with it and PVP. Fury in 1.12 is not BAD like it was in real vanilla until AQ. It's just not as good as Arms.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxbhbZVVzmgxoVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxbhbZVVzmgxoVo)
---
But...if you are going to rank I would just buy a Arcanite Reaper and play Arms. I'm not about that ranking life. I like to actually sleep so I play that fury spec until Ashkandi. This would be the PvP Arms spec. Specialization of course depends on what weapon you have. **This is also your leveling spec because fury sucks before you get hit.** You do the mstrike tree first. You take anger management asap, sweeping strikes asap, imp hamstring asap because it lets you beat a lot of clases and solo elites when retaliation is down. Booming voice is there for rogues. Demo shout reveals them. It's one reason Arms is simply better than fury. The other being mstrike and the crazy things you can do with Sweeping strike on multiple targets with abilities and whirlwind. 
---

---
If you need the list of why Arms is better
---
\- On demand burst is more consistent/reliable
---
\- More utility due to revealing rogues from decent distance and mstrike being the most powerful debuff in the game in pvp.
---
\- Imp hamstring lets you beat a lot of classes that fury gets streamrolled by

What about CN for Clicker Noobs.
---
Don't lie we all clicked back then
---
Enchanting is money sink until you pick up good enchants at 60.  People tend to forgo it while leveling.  I suggest tailoring/mining, build up the ore you need at 60 and then drop mining for engineering. 
---
Up until RFK or so you can get away with it. I remember clearing SFK up to the werewolf boss with a hunter pet because it took our tank an hour to get there.
---
Right, from now the only change I support is Blizz going through and making all these crazy rumours true.
---
It should be dm and DM
---
Warriors have a very low skill ceiling compared to most other classes. Of course there are ways any player can distinguish themselves by having excellent situational awareness and knowing what the most valuable thing to do is. But warriors have relatively few utility abilities and being locked into melee ranged limits their reasonable options at any given moment.
---
For example here's just a small selection of the decisions a warlock constantly needs to make in PvP.
---
Dispel magic effect from an ally or enemy within 30 yards (8 second cooldown). To make the correct choice the warlock needs to be aware of all the magic effects active on all targets within a 40 yard or so radius. Perhaps I'd like to dispel fear from an ally, but wait corruption and siphon life are on him too so that's only a 1/3 chance. Oh hey look our rogue just started stun locking the enemy soul link warlock maybe I should dispel soul link. Oh wait a paladin just ran up and used HoJ on on me, bingo that's the best one. Poof, stun dispelled. It's often a very complicated decision that needs to be made in a split second many times throughout a fight.
---
Spell lock any enemy within 30 yards for 8 seconds, also silencing for 3 (30 second cooldown). Hm, is that priest's heal really worth spell locking right now? Could it lead to a kill? After all he's just going to start spamming mana burn on our healer if he gets locked out of holy. Or should I wait till the mage starts casting a polymorph. Oh hey I can dispel magic maybe polymorph doesn't matter that much, but wait I recognize that mage's name and know he's smart enough to put detect magic on a polymorphed target so that's only a 50/50 chance. Maybe I should wait till the enemy warlock starts casting fear, after all locking a warlock out of shadow is more useful than locking a mage out of arcane.
---
Meanwhile that same warlock is simultaneouslg choosing how to use his own globals. Which target being feared will benefit my team the most? Can I afford to get in range of them? Will anyone interrupt me? Oh shoot there's an enemy mage and my addon hasn't detected that they've used counterspell yet, I don't want to get locked out of shadow school if they notice. Maybe I should just use instants instead first until I run out of worthwhile ones. Hm, but we have an elemental shaman doing some serious nuke damage so would it really be so bad if the mage counterspelled me? At least I can swap to using immolate and searing pain, that shaman is fucked if he gets nature locked.
---
Warrior decision making is so straightforward by comparison. And I say that as someone who mained warrior in retail and did tons of arena in TBC and WotLK where it was critical that I use every tool at my classes disposal to the fullest.
---
That will be helpful!  I'm also curious what was going on with levels 38-40 on the Alliance side, although I did find the inserted picture funny.  
---
Posting on Reddit is an xp waste! Get back to grinding! 
---
Pets designed for tanking like turtles can tank pretty much anything.  Problem is it has to be single target only, which slows the group down.   
---
I'm definitely going to twink. I'm thinking 39 or 49 bracket. Probably ele shaman but maybe I'll change my mind.
---
If you want to rank that high then you should really go arms. And just raid with arms as well. It’s really not a big deal for the first raid tier. Once you rank up you can respec to fury in time for BWL. 
---
With loot trading there's is option C, roll on everything and then auction it off.
---
That there was more than one spec... 
---
I leveled to like 55 as Holy before learning this. I had fun though. 
---
I rolled a dwarf priest as my first character.  Had no idea what professions actually did, so when I ran into the mining training in Ironforge, I learned that (figuring dwarves and mining made sense).  
---
Ended up with mining and tailoring all through vanilla. 
---
Troll, because your only hope is try and DPS him down as hard and fast as possible before you go OOM from mana burn, the extra damage you take doesnt matter,  so a blackout proc will make your chances even less.
---
Priest vs Paladin is honestly one of the hardest counters in the game.

I definitely started as a clicker 😟

I'm 17. Joined in WoD (lol) and hated the endgame as a Ret Pally. Alts weren't worth it much except for the pvp since the fastest way of leveling was dungeon grinding. It felt really dumb and I always felt like I missed out on so much going through old raids for transmog/mount runs. Last year in July is when I first tried a private server of vanilla. Now THAT is more my pace! Everything felt more important and the leveling was somehow slower and more rewarding than a 100 level system. I didn't play too consistently and am still working on getting to 60 on my UD lock (level 51 atm). From what I've seen on Youtube and forums, the endgame seems a lot more important and a lot less selective. I absolutely HATE ilvls and the ridiculous numbers/scaling and not being invited to a raid because someone else has a higher number than me. Classic really seems like my chance to shine. The world is so much more full, the community is way more important, and the game truly feels like an epic journey. I'm most likely going to play an Undead Rogue on a medium population RPPvP server.
---
TL;DR I'm 17, joined in WoD, prefer classic way more, and you can probably find me as an Undead Rogue on a medium population RPPvP server come classic.
---
My first character was a warrior. When doing dungeons, I managed to equate tank=warrior, however, i had no idea what tanking entailed and would just DPS and let healers and DPS take threat from me.
---
At level 40 i wanted to respec Arms "properly" with MS. I was looking carefully at all the abilities and noticed HS gave "increased threat". I asked a friend of mine what threat meant and he told me it makes mobs more likely to attack me. I asked and wondered why anyone would want to be attacked more. He said "for tanking".
---
All of a sudden it all clicked in place, combined with realizing i was one of the only classes that could wear plate, in that very moment i finally understood what tanking meant and realized how bad i was to that point.
---
Not sure why you're downvoted. Nostalrius took 8 days from launch day to clear MC, and they did it with 38 people in whatever gear they had 8 days after server launch. 
---
Dual Fury is ok, you always have full rage, have tiny CD for intercept, you do good damage even while using shield, have more burst button, if you have r10+ and good main hand wep you are will feel ok. 
---
But mortal have more utility and aoe and shine while you have pocket healer.  
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **5th Cakeday** awesometographer! ^(hug)
---
I’m 16 and have played on classic servers and retail only
---
Loot the puppy!
---
Yeah, its sad to think that era of gaming is gone forever. The closest you can get these days is to play games on launch day and rush to completion before information spreads throughout communities. 
---
Ask mage to heal me. 
---
It's amazing how, given a low enough chance of something happening, people basically revert to medieval superstition.
---
I see now, particularly since the idea from the start was that gear didn't have an immensely big gap from existing gear.
---
The thing is though, how much skill is there without creating entirely new fights and raids? If you were raiding in places like Naxx and AQ40, chances are the majority of people know exactly what they're doing. Knowing the fights and knowing your rotations like muscle memory was the baseline requirement in a place like Naxx (or so my raiding friends told me; I was never geared/rich enough for the like, 5 guilds on my server who actually ran Naxx). 
---
From what I understand, there wasn't much in the way of 10 competent people carrying the other 30 people like in MC when it came to places like Naxx, which is why such a small portion of the playerbase ever cleared it - barring obvious stuff like looming expansions making them seem moot. Is there really any room for improvement when everyone knows how to clear the raid?
---
I was obsessed with being frugal to the point of inefficiency. Besides clogging my mail with items I had to send back and forth between characters, and using greens like 20 levels old, I was just too cheap regarding buying my mount. My first character/main was a shaman, and I hit 60 I believe sometime during the  AQ patch (well before BC) but never bought even a normal level 40 mount-I just ghost wolfed everywhere, even by the time I had gotten blue’d out from dungeons, tried a couple raids, and gotten rank 8 in pvp. I even did this into the beginning of BC! I was still ghost wolfing around Outland at like level 67 in outlander. I ended up buying my normal mount, epic mount, and flying mount all on the same day, and my epic flying mount a few days later.
---
Idk why anyone would downvote this. It honestly does make sense, considering that when I see "LFG DM" I have to shift+click the name to check the level. Some people just don't specify which part of DM they are spamming LFG for.
---
Paladin is very defensive and supportive. There are a limited number of things they can do in a given 1vX scenario without engineering and trinkets. They excel in group pvp, but it generally isn't as exciting to watch unless you're into healing most of the time.

When abbreviating deadmines as VC what does it even stand for? DM makes way more sense.
---
Using proc-based, no stat fist weapons on a Hunter (Eskhandar's Left Claw, Bloodfist, etc). Not bringing bullets to raids, afking during the fights, and so on.
---
I have the Legendary edition, have had it for little over a year, but sadly it's not great, despite cleaning it keeps double clicking on single clicks randomly (which started a few months ago). Could just be mine, or maybe I did something wrong, I'm not sure. Also the darn thing doesn't work on private servers because it didn't have support at the time.

I don't suppose y'all have recommendations?

Crazy thing is Staysafe didn't even play Vanilla, only private servers

As a 12 year old warlock I never trained fear because I didn’t train spells that didn’t do damage. I finally learned fear after a few months at 60

Not really wow but more mmo in general. When Vanilla came out my neighborhood friend and his parents immediately started playing as they were huge blizzard fans. After a few weeks of watching them play and I saved up the money for the box and a month or two of sub. Log in, make the most normal of all human warriors and proceed to level to goldshire. One of the quests I picked up there had me going to stormwind so I messaged my friend on how to get there and he replied with a single letter.
---
"y"
---
Now remember I had never played an mmo, or really any online game with chat. So at this moment I thought he mistyped and asked the question again, and this time he replied more sternly.
---
"Y???"
---
I'm getting frustrated now as I have no idea why he is saying. We end up going back and forth for the next 10 minutes with my trying to figure out what the hell he was saying before he explained that y = why and a bunch of other lingo he was using.
---
The only other "Vanilla" moment that stands out to me would be my friend coming over because I got assassins blade on my twink after grinding SFK for a month and told him that the enchant i got didn't look anywhere as cool as what he told me it would. Apparent my video settings had my particle effects at the lowest while everything else at medium to high allowing me to get a crisp 15-20 fps and during bgs 10-15. He ended up helping me lower them so I averaged 30-35 while bumping particle effects. Lest just say it was a whole new world for me.
---
DAE &lt;extremely popular thing to do in vanilla&gt;?
---
how is this shit even on this sub?
---
want to play the game as close as you can to a blizz like classic? play a private server
---
want to play the game as close as you can but don't care if it's accurate to classic? play retail
---
those are literally your only two options
---
I'm having the same problem. I'm leaning towards warlock because I loved my warlock in TBC. I don't plan on raiding so the DOT limit doesn't bother me but I hope they remove that. I know people want NO CHANGES but why would you want the debuff limit for the sake of having it? I'll probably go undead because I don't like the orc models
---
Not really a moment but I remember I would spam serpent sting on my hunter in raids (like deep AQ40).  I knew it really didn’t add dps (honestly probably hurt dps) but I did it anyway because I was bored.
---
Similar for me.  I rolled a human warrior and picked herbalism and alchemy because I thought that as a warrior I would be using many health potions.   It worked out alright I guess.
---
First time I realized that there was an option to see herbs on the mini-map was a good one for me. I think I was over 200 Herbalism at the time and this was back when herbs **didn't sparkle**
---
&gt; I got so pissed I punched him in the balls

did he give you some conjured food and say, "here. sit down and eat this. it will heal you"
---
Mitigation*
---
It's a lot less forgiving than the retail version. 
---
I admit, my idea was based on the idea of implementing new raids, not just adding bigger numbers to existing raids. Although... I am a fan of the Ulduar-style hardmodes. They make for a nice in-universe explanation for why the bosses are harder or give better loot. Zul'aman timed runs, the Argent Crusade and Gordok tribute chests, Sartharion with multiple drakes up, summoning a harder boss in the Ring of Law, they're all content I like and wish there was more of. But all that gets back to the original issue. People have to go out of their way to design this stuff.
---
By some margin, it was 'tanking' as a warrior without a shield, defensive stance (literally didn't have it), or indeed the slightest clue that my role was to keep things attacking me and me only!
---
Around that level is when you start running out of good quests to do, and mid to late game zones and quests are designed to be much further apart from each other that it's torture to do the trecking on foot. A mount is essentially a 60% increase in XP gain so everyone should spend the last few levels before 40 grinding mobs for gold so you can afford a mount right away. There's plenty of suggestions where to do this on youtube.
---
People who play slowly and tinker with the auction house alot and can therefor afford a mount without grinding will be miles ahead of the guide because of rested xp while people with 60s already can deal with the spike in difficulty because they're funneling gear via the other character. Alternatively you could be doing a SM run every now and then for fun which would more or less normalize the gap.
---
Back when my family was sharing 2 accounts between everyone I remember heading over to my cousin's house with my brother and sister, and because they also played WoW we wanted to show them our characters. We happened to log in just as our oldest brother was at the last boss of a dungeon he was grinding for weeks for a specific piece of gear - which dropped while he was disconnected. He blew up at us when we drove back home lol
---
Since that's what it takes to prove you're better than someone.
---
This is a video game, not a war.
---
It's much more analogous to a sport than anything else, where the spirit of competition and sportsmanship are fundamentally important concepts.
---
It's a piece of shit, the paint rubs off and the buttons get gunked up real easy. My buddy has owned two. 
---
If he's already ganked you then sure, turn the tables with numbers. If you initiated the conflict and still lost then you deserve a few deaths.
---
But healers don't have infinite mana to pump up crazy healing. That's why mitigation is also important.
---
Two different usernames
---
A level 60 character have 96% chance to spell hit an even leveled mob, but only a 83% hit chance against an endgame boss (lvl 63). So if you are into raiding, spell hit is rather great thing to have.
---
It's legitimately not the worst backup plan in dungeons during absolute disaster scenarios. 
---
Was given an [Ironpatch Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12976/ironpatch-blade) by a random 60 while leveling a warrior that would eventually become my first 60.  Had no idea why every weapon that dropped for me was trash for quite a while.  This was strange because I had leveled multiple other characters up to level 50 beforehand.
---
I assumed spells couldn’t be cast if a mob hit you, so I’d cast 1-2 Smites then proceed to only melee. Probably did that for the first 6 levels. 
---
I assumed that yellow sword next to an outline of armor meant I had the highest damage of anyone at my level. Then wondered where my weapon went. 
---
I assumed that, because I was level 8, this group of skull players attacking Thunder Bluff wouldn’t see me as a threat, so I proceeded to serpent sting one, thinking they’d ignore me when there were stronger enemies to fight. 
---
I died at the speed of light. 
---
I never had a specific moment. I spent a lot of time reading the forums and was pretty savvy. Looking back though, the main reason I was *dirt poor* from level 5 until level 60 was definitely because I felt compelled to buy every single recipe or skill rank that I could learn along the way.
---
There are a lot of blacksmithing recipes and warrior skills that you can leave at rank 1.

---
Meaning someone with Naxx gear will have little to no competition and just spend most of the BG stomping through casuals?
---
Sounds like the twink experience aka boring af after a few days.
---
While true it's not exacly a very good point. People have wanted all the quality of life improvements too but in the end they ended up making the game worse. People would also gladly accept a free full tier 3 if it was offered to you but in the end it would ruin the game for you.

---
Bittervets
---
that's not a valid excuse. There is many ways to keep mana up and heal during raids and not many fights goes long enough to require 2 innervate on the main healer attached to the tank. 
---
on a 5 man dungeon - this is a non issue
---
Wow.
---
Hey bro IMO you should play priest, farming is decent. You can farm in every spec and do the DM north plant runs with holy nova and divine shield.  Levelling is fun and even solo grinding for elements isn't too bad since you never oom in raid gear with all that spirit.  Can respec shadow for a whole different gameplay feel too!
---
It stands for VanCleef.  
---
The end boss of the instance.
---
Wanting to save gold made you do dumb things as a kid. I wanted to save 1 gold my first Priest needed to respec Shadow after leveling as Holy for so long, so I deleted it and started a new Priest.
---
Spending all my gold on an epic at level 39 instead of getting my mount at 40. I mean it wasn't THAT bad. I pvped for a good 2 weeks at 39.
---
it's alright, sorry if I sounded combative. yeah, back then, not a lot of people knew about the awesomeness of troll priests (their racial spells and berserking + mind control were seriously overpowered), so our numbers were few and far between.
---
thanks for the info about the curses in classic! yeah, curse of tongues was something of a weird case, in 2v2, it was godlike (not a lot of a dispellers) to fuck over most healers and spellcasters.
---
I gave a 90 gold loan to some random guy who was 40 and didn't have a mount. I can't tell if it was really dumb or if I saved him from World of Warcraft taking over his life because he never logged in on that character again.
---
Im an outcast on this topic, there is no change I can think of that would make me say "I'm not going to play this"

the last boss...DM makes the most sense for multiple reasons. not only are low levels not looking for dire maul runs but you specify which dire maul run when you are posting lol
---
I havent seen that video in at least 10 years
---
except noone says LFM DM for dire maul. you specify which section. 
---
&gt;Some people just don't specify which part of DM they are spamming LFG for.
---
then those people are just dumb
---
I agree, it does happen a lot though.... You can't fix stupid.
---
Pretty sure autoattacking with a wand wasn't in the game for a fair while at launch so really no one bothered with it back then. You clicked 'wand' and it attacked once and you got the GCD so it was super bad.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patchwerk_(original)
---
    Hateful Strike - Base damage is 22100-29900 physical damage, thankfully this is mitigated through high AC. The average hit is ~8000 damage on a fully buffed BWL/AQ40 geared Warrior in defensive stance. 
---
Made my hunter a blacksmith because I thought that was the only way I could craft mail gear for myself when I eventually turned 40.
---
He probably died from heart attack, caused by you giving him that fortune. 
---
true that lol
---
Yeah I factored in everything. Crit, armor, miss chance, etc. Hunters don't get 0.7 DPS from 1 AP. Not even close even fully raid buffed. This [guide](http://forums.crestfall-gaming.com/index.php?/topic/1794-vanilla-hunter-guide-the-arrow-and-you/) has some reasonable estimates at how much DPS each stat point contributes based on a raid hunter spreadsheet, though the site appears to be down right now. They listed their assumptions and I adjusted upwards a bit by adding in faerie fire and curse of recklessness and came up with the following DPS contributed per point of stat for a hunter in mostly MC/Ony BiS gear:
---
Agi: 0.44
---
AP: 0.16
---
Crit: 4.32
---
For the 49 BM hunter I plan on making I calculated this much DPS added by each stat:
---
AP: 0.08
---
Agi: 0.19
---
No, because I already own it and I better get access to all of the goodies I had back then in the new server as well.
---
That's when they double down and say that Blizzard can't mess up and that the private servers were wrong, and then they'll ignore the footage from Vanilla proving them wrong.
---
By the time your guild is progressing in naxx, tanks will have the gear yo be def capped.
---
MC, BWL, even AQ40 do not require def capped tanks. 
---
I know clickers/keyboard turners have done the mage tower challenges. You can do it, it just makes the game way harder than it's meant to be.
---
The Gnome voice can be pretty grating.
---
Lol! Thanks for sharing
---
I kind of like pvp and pve tbh. I've always liked battery healing in pvp though. Maybe dwarf paladin then? Or would human be better?
---
You bastard. We fite now. 
---
is classic our gen's midlife crisis?
---
I'm 16 and started in mop, I used to play on nostalrius but then that shut down so rip
---
Can you explain what you mean by totem twist? I'm new to shaman
---
High chance this will happen my man.
---
Noticed the Carrot on a Stick and the Argent Daw Commission trinkets, now there’s a classic combo 
---
Trying to \^rebalance\^ classes, spells or raids. 
---
now that i can actually afford one, hell yea
---
you'd have to Google for less basic info because I'm not a shaman but it basically works like this.
---
When you drop windfury totem it pulses once every two seconds or so, which gives everyone in your group a windfury buff that lasts for like ten seconds. So you drop windfury, let it apply the buff, then you can switch out windfury totem for Grace of air until you need to switch back to windfury to refresh the buff 
---
For paladin it's really just which one you like best. Arguments could be made for human sword/mace specialization and perception, but I personally would take stone form on a paladin.  
---
Yes, ganna make a 39 feral druid, with a high stam high crit build for shred spamming and flag running.
---
Ganna be a recreation of my old vanilla druid. Rolling a different class as a main this time around.
---
Pve Nightfall boy
---
Pvp fun early on and against noobs. Easily countered and kited by anybody with a brain. Mount up and demount at the player for maximum lulz.
---
I think I'll stick to priest. :) 
---
I honestly think 39 is the best brackets. Far more casters become viable, but still no mounts or 31 pt talents.
---
Each class gas a far more defined role due, and mobility is still a huge factor.

[Gandalf was not a wizard](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3jpksw/gandalf_was_really_just_fighter_with_int18/)
---
So supposedly for those crazy enough, the rank 11 mounts do not require level 60, and are technically possible at level 54 to use.
---
HOWEVER, it may be impossible to get enough honor to get to that rank at 59 without battle group BG's to increase the pop in non-60 brackets.
---
Yes, but i hate using it. 
---
Is AV 51-60? I can't remember but if that's the case, maybe it's doable 
---
Please undo this bot action. I thought this would be an interesting poll.
---
I'd also be peeved to see a 59 with r14. 
---
39 Ele is solid, but has some mana issues and uses a ton of cloth gear.
---
A 49 Ele shaman is a fucking monster, especially if you can get all the dire maul and brd mail gear with SP. I worked out a potential 49 build (31/8/0) that had 290 spell power with only a couple easy buffs (I.e arcane sliders) and buffs.
---
It may also be possible to get zg shaman enchants if you main is also a shaman for 49... But I'm guessing the legion base game engine may not make that possible.
---
I specced my Rogue into Hemo, because it seemed to be a popular ability among rogues.  *"For the debuff it applied, obviously,"* my stupid self thought.  So naturally I would Hemo to get the debuff on the target, then go back to Sinister Strike until the debuff fell off and I needed to reapply it.
---
My first 60. An orc warrior named Gruntapult.
---
It would be so awesome if we had the old models for a couple months. and also if BG's weren't on release maybe a month later and once released we all had to queue up in barrens/ashenvale for WSG, etc
---
Those values don't seem right... are you 100% sure about your source? Did you check any other sites for confrimation?
---
YES
---
My "main" for farming and pvp will be a female Orc Hunter BM specced.
---
This is one of the least gear dependand class/spec/race combos, especially for PvP. Others being SL Warlock, Prep Rogue, Shadowpriest, most healers and there are certainly some combos I didn't mention. But I personally really like the Hunter class, because they are also fast and efficient grinders.
---
My other toon will be either a Shaman (race undecided), or a Warrior (almost certainly Orc, maybe Tauren). This toon will be focussed on group content and I play it with my buddies. The class depends on what my friends want to play when classic actually comes out. We will be 3-5 ppl so we plan on filling all three roles and mainly go for dungeons.
---
Original T2, that’s some OG shit right there
---
mainly because freedom
---
I agree if you also have time to farm a full set of consumables. But for someone who doesn't have time to grind alot Engineering isn't viable for PvP nor PvE.
---
The Herb/Alch/Fishing combo for example has massive utility for both PvE and PvP, even surpassing Engineering, and is the combo that usually makes the most money with the least investment as well. It's just not BoP/crafting skill locked like Engineering so you don't get the exclusive rights that warrants it over Engineering if you have the income to support your Alch *and* Eng consumables.
---
Nothing good came from ZG
---
As someone who: Played vanilla, got rank 12, and raided through the easy parts of naxx, I can tell you this was 100% not the case.
---
Still a fun class! Make sure you build a shadow off set so you can occasionally melt people's faces. You won't regret it.  
---
Oh yeah. He feared the nerd rage 
---
Yee. Went away from the keyboard and he snuck on 
---
I played for 8 levels with the camera angle facing directly down on my head.  I didn’t know how to bring around behind me. 
---
Two things, first I made a hunter on the wrong server. I leveled him to 8 the first night and didn't realize I had to buy more ammo. So I just used my melee wep for everything. 
---
Then the next day comes around and my friends tell me what server to roll on (Azgalor) So I reroll a orc warrior. I end up getting to around 25-28 and tell my friend that I'm having a really difficult time. He comes to my house and looks and I've yet to train a damn spell or talent. So then I rerolled one last time to a mage and stuck with him until I quit in Cata.
---
Looking forward to a much better starting experience this time around. 
---
Wish there was a way to download all my old chat logs 
---
No, he just said, "i can't"
---
I don't know how you raid healed in Vanilla, but personally as Horde main healer priest you had to use downranked heal and gheal every once in a while to keep the mana. It was only in full t2+ when you started to be able to spam more but even then with flask and full buffs.

&gt;  It appears companies need to learn to not to grow too fast - which is what I believe happens too often. Because why would they need investors if they can just grow naturally?
---
I get this, but I also think it's easy to wax poetic about "how things should be" rather than looking at the cold truth.
---
Let's say you started a company developing "widgets."  100% your own hard work and ingenuity went in to creating these widgets, and they're unlike anything people have ever seen.  The product takes off, and before you know it, you're faced with a choice:  do you want to grow your company, or do you want to get paid?  Many would choose "grow the company," because after all, the promise of a bigger payout in the future makes it worth it, right?  So instead of taking an extra $500k home in the next year, you take that cash and invest it back in the company and hire 10 people at $50k each to help you make even more widgets.  Demand continues to grow, and soon, you can't keep pace with the orders... hell, you can't even afford to hire more people to keep growing at the rate you need.  You'd need 100 new widget makers to make enough widgets, but you don't have an extra $5 mil laying around to make those hires.  So your options are to either disappoint your consumer base and ruin the good will that's gotten you this far, or seek additional funding.  And there's only one way to get funding at that scale -- going public.
---
So you sell 51% of the company for a massive influx of cash.  Now you can hire 1000 new people to fulfill all existing orders and even branch out into some new products, and there's still money left over!  The top owners of the remaining 49% appreciate your hard work so they give you a bonus.  Here's that bigger payout you were hoping for when you decided to grow the business rather than take the $500k a few years ago!  But we've seen what happens after this.  Now the investors control the business.  And you are *legally obligated* to operate with their interest in mind.  And you and I both know where that leads...
---
Now obviously this is a very layman version of things.  But what you said stood out to me...
---
&gt; Because why would they need investors if they can just grow naturally?
---
That's the trap.  Growing a business to a national or worldwide scale takes ***a lot*** of money, and it's almost always more money than any of those companies have access to while they are on that path to growth in the first place.  So owners have a choice of growing naturally and never making money -- because they are investing every spare penny they have to keep hiring and growing and living in the margins -- or going public and getting paid while *also* still growing the business.
---
I'm not arguing any of this is the way things should work.  I'm just trying to point out that it's not as simple as saying *"It appears companies need to learn to not to grow too fast."*

Spending a week for each quest that took you to multiple zones in each continent.
---
Btw do you know why priests get unique racial skills, but other classes don't? Or do they?
---
It's an MMO.  That's literally the point, for many of us.
---
I have seen this happen in PS. 
---
I'm going to turn you into a belt.
---
I leveled as a resto shaman until level 45~, I figured if I can heal myself I would never die, until someone noticed and told me I should try out a damage spec. So I made the logical choice and leveled as ele until 60.
---
I'm 100% that guy lol
---
Happened to me too, I got stuck in a puddle and couldn't figure out how to swim up.
---
I was lvling as a shaman with my warrior friend and I would sit down to drink after 3 pulls while he would be killing stuff still.  It 100% felt like he was my hunter pet.  Let them call you your pocket healer as long as they get you free kills, xp and keep enemies off you.  
---
Leveling on Fury good til 40lvl, lvl when you can pick ms, so many good talents, crit, piercing howl, enrage, flurry, ye you have op impale in arms, BUT you don't have a crit on leveling, and you don't have bers stance til 30lvl, so many talents is just a waste.  
---
Gnomes can be warriors? ffs I finally decided ;D
---
Casting interrupt moves/spells. I leveled my shaman as enhancement and spell casters would own my ass. Corpse runs galore. I'm embarrassed to admit I was in Feralas before I learned earthshock could be used to interrupt spell casts.  I was getting my ass owned when another shaman was running by and stopped to watch me and asked why I didn't just interrupt the mob's casting spells. Once he explained I felt so stupid. 
---
Getting lost in Elwynn Forest trying to take a shortcut to Stormwind. Wandered for a while until, relieved, I found the road again and followed it to Goldshire.
---
A while late I discovered the map.
---
same, downrank heal, ur priests should have +healing gear/ench. Flask, pots, all that jazz. Either have a innervate and if u have a shaman who is assigned for caster, be within the totem that gives mana regen. Also know when to cancel ur heals and wait 5 seconds for mp regen tick when possible, as much as possible. 
---
It's easier to deal with mana problems and healing tanks and less worries of overhealing if they have tons of HP. So as a priest, we like to see tanks with a higher health pool, because mana issue is easier to deal with as oppose of tank with low HP and isnt mitigating dmg. He can only rely on hp pot, healers and a measly healthstone. 
---
we have innervate, mana totem, mp pot, items / consumables that takes our HP to convert to Mana or items that grants extra MP or MP5, engineer has something too. 
---
my first character was a hunter but I really only wanted to melee. I would start out with serpent sting then go melee them. I really only wanted hunter for the pet ; P
---
Bad Dudes.
---
Something something #nochanges
---
I had a guildmate who leveled a Hunter up to L27 before he even knew there were talents points. He literally hadn't spent any talents points up till then. He found out when he complained in guild chat that the game was way too hard and he was going to quit because he couldn't keep up with anyone else leveling or do any instance runs with anyone he knew because he was so far behind. Everyone was wondering how a hunter could think the game was too hard at L27 and asked what spec he was.....we linked him to a solo leveling build and some class guides/theorycrafting sites. He went nuts....thanked us for almost a month straight.  He claimed it took him less time to do the last 30 levels than it did the first 27. 
---
and DMT is what Joe Rogan wants to talk about
---
ok I actually laughed thanks xD
---
this thread is a goldmine for entertainment I love it
---
Man I really can't wait for classic after watching that! I really enjoyed your video!! (The audio does clear up) having 19-20 fps while just having fun with your friends is what it's about man!
---
That's the spirit , we all love Classic World of Warcraft, to have fun with friends! &lt;3 
---
So you leveled to mid twenties with just heroic strike rank 1 basically?
---
I dont know what your talking about, but there is a shit ton of awesome caster dps gear there and a bunch of one offs for others. And just a great pug raid in general.
---
pvp wise they are the best warrior race for alliance
---
I learned that you couldn't zone into a raid after a boss fight began when my guild was doing blackwing lair and I got online late. They pulled chromaggus while I was still on the way in and I couldn't get inside. Of course that was the only time he dropped netherwind for my guild while I was in it and they ended up getting sharded.
---
Is this a "myth" meaning it was disproved in retail vanilla?
---
Or a "myth" because it doesn't work that way on pirate servers?
---
Yeah if there's one change I'd make it's toning down naxx gear slightly.
---
Vanilla OG’s
---
If you are dying to spike damage you need more effective health (stamina/armour).
---
If you are dying because the healers go OOM you need more avoidance.
---
If you are dying because DPS are threat capped and you can't beat the enrage timer, you need more DPS (hit/crit/strength/whatever).
---
If you aren't dying and the boss is, it doesn't matter.
---
geared hunters with the ZG trinket=Pog
---
Herb/Alch is a great one if you aren't planning on eng/mining for class/pvp reasons. It's really satisfying to be able to make your own consumables for raids.
---
You forgot the one goober who always says "whale cum"
---
Yes I will prob have a rogue at each bracket at some point but my favorite will always be 19 I think, the competitiveness of that bracket is just unreal when you start to get to know the other twinks and see them all the time. 
---
If you're going past R10 you should really be arms with a 2hander. Fury is doable but you're talking about nonstop pvp at that point.
---
I always wanted a good sword on my Warlock and bought Black Knight for 9 gold right after a level 60 stranger gave me 10 gold to help me out.  I spent even more to get a glow on it (lesser beastslaying) to look like the high level guys.
---
I had this idea that I was like Buffy, and would spend hours killing undead in the Darkshire graveyards for fun and to get wool.  A few dots, succubus and me meleeing away!
---
I didn't realise how much gold this was, really, I just thought level 60s were all millionaires.
---
Looking back, it wasn't a mistake really, since I had such fun.  I did hate and fear Mor'ladim, though, right until I later finished his questline, which remains one of WoW's magical moments.
---
I still have an itch to buy Black Knight, even now...
---
I spent like half an hour trying to figure out how to get rid of the items in the “buyback” option when I was selling my loot because I thought I had to manually drag each item from my inventory into each buyback slot. 
---
DAE plan to grief levellers and noobs with overpowered characters that make bullying them easy?
---
DAE plan to downvote whoever calls it griefing and post long-winded, disingenuous justifications for it?
---
I was suuuuuuch a scrub when I had my human warrior main. I remember just spamming intimidating shout because I didn’t realize what it was doing. I was kicked out of many a stormwind stockades dungeon groups lol
---
Imagine considering PvP in a PvP setting "bullying"
---
Intelligence doesn't increase damage at all though it does increase dps by a small amount because it increases crit chance.  However, since dots don't crit, intelligence will have no effect on your dot damage at all.
---
Equally weird though. "Weirdo, giving someone what they asked for "...
---
Ah. I still wouldnt use it though lol.
---
True, if you know about his supernatural Maiar side, but it's fair as he did describe himself as a wizard in the books (and movies) and Tolkien does too:
---
“Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.”
---
"Yet in the wizard's face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow; "
---
In some MMOs he was possibly more of a cleric, but he used fireballs and lightning bolts, so in he definitely fits the magic user archetype in Dungeons and Dragons and a Mage of sorts in WoW.  What do you think?
---
I'm certain those values are accurate. You know the formula for AP increasing auto attack DPS before any modifiers is 14 AP = 1 DPS right? That puts AP at being worth 0.07 DPS before factoring in talent damage +% damage boosts, special attacks, crits, armor, misses, etc.
---
You might be right.  I recall not bother with wanding on my mage and looked for wands based on stats.  
---
I was 33-34 before realizing there were talents. It was bad. “I wonder how much intellect I got from that level..... I gain 1 talent point...wait... what?” And then I went arcane lol.
---
Dude, 1 to 10 is hell for me with no pet.  I can't even imagine the pain of 1-16.
---
Why do you need a name? Why would you even mention this unless somebody asked?
---
So many classic players are like the WoW equivalent of vegans and crossfitters
---
You’re only boned if they’re undead.  ;)
---
That's actually the best leveling professions for a warrior. 
---
I wanted it when they announced it but am-so over that shit at this point
---
I actually ran out of ammo on a VC run not too long ago.  I was pretty close to 20, so when I refilled my ammo before the VC run, I bought mostly the level 20 stuff.  I thought I'd level pretty quick while running VC.  Turns out Vanilla is awful for XP in dungeons.  I burned all 800 rounds of level 10 ammo I had by the time we hit the pirate ship.  So I meleed most of the mobs on the pirate ship, ended up pulling lots of extra stuff by accident.  I hit 20 on the last mob before VC, swapped in my level 20 ammo and blew his ass away.
---
&gt;No TBC will release
---
You literally don't know that, don't be shocked if they do
---
Ok, I remembered to follow up.  Here is my path:
---
* **Level 10-14: Improved HW** \- Bigger bang for the buck than Tidal Focus
---
* **Level 15-19: Tidal Focus** \- Won't have enough crit or sustain to make Ancestral Healing worth it yet, Imp Reincarnation hopefully won't be needed yet, and it's better than Totemic Focus.
---
* **Level 20: Totemic Mastery**.  Healing Grace is useless (you generally pull aggro on things that have 0 aggro on them), and Nature's Guidance doesn't help heal.
---
* **Level 21-24: 4/5 Healing Focus.**  This will be helpful for when something else has 0 aggro.  As an alternative, you can go Ancestral Healing and 1/3 Healing Focus.
---
* **Level 25-29: Restorative Totems.**  Mainly because you'll want them later, and there's nothing later you'll want to skip.
---
* **Level 30-32: Healing Way.**  You can get NS first if you want, but I'd rather have something I will be using a lot.  This is an 18% boost to HW once stacked, and it continues to stay stacked.
---
* **Level 33: Nature's Swiftness.**
---
* **Level 34: Finish Healing Focus.**  As an alternative, you can put 1 point into Tidal Mastery.  Or, if you got Ancestral Healing, you can go 2/5 Healing Focus.
---
* **Level 35-39: Purification.**  2% static healing per point is amazing.  Keep in mind that's also a 2% HPM boost.
---
* **Level 40: Mana Tide Totem.**
---
* **Level 41-43: Ancestral Healing.** My thought process is to get the boon, and then get Tidal Mastery for the crit chance next.  But you can reverse this if you want.
---
* **Level 44-48: Tidal Mastery.**  5% crit is good, but I think up until this point everything else we've done is better.  I gave options as to when to get Tidal Mastery, Ancestral Healing, and Healing Focus.  At this point you should have all 3.
---
* **Level 49-53: Ancestral Knowledge.**  Extra mana sounds nice, but it's 5% for 5 points.  It's still more useful than the last two talents we're gonna grab.
---
* **Level 54-55: Improved Reincarnation.**  Might as well grab it now.  You could grab it before Ancestral Knowledge, or after Totemic Focus.
---
* **Level 56-60: Totemic Focus.**
---
Now you have the level 60 build that you've built into!
---
That's literally the point of having extremely difficult content with extremely strong gear, you're supposed to be strong.
---
Literally what is this take holy shit lmao
---
I want everyone to have the opportunity to get them, as it was back then. It is laughable to me that people who have the original CE should be somehow recognized in Classic. How entitled do people have to be to think that.
---
I repeatedly sold my 1h+shield by accident.
---
Best was when we had 2 warriors in a maraudon quest group and we both realized we didnt have our 1h+shield on us. He had it in the bank, I had sold mine.
---
2h tanking it was then. Poor enh shaman with some +int gear. :(
---
Tell me that Zin'Rokh is bad and I will end you!
---
ALL PUMP AND NO DUMP
---
I didn’t know you could learn spells and I didn’t know you had a spell book. Which means when I started leveling my shaman and accidentally threw out my lightning bolt and healing wave from my action bar I meleed all the way to level 12 until a friend told me about it.
---
Assassination backstab spec? Me too!
---
#justhunterthings
---
I used to wonder why the old website said Enchanting was recommended for advanced players only.
---
Originally I figured it was because green-purple weapons were hard to come by in sufficient quantities. 
---
Apparently, it was actually to keep half the WoW population from running around naked while punching everything because they accidentally disenchanted everything they own.
---
Waaah people are going to get gear that I'm not good enough to get myself! Then me and my shitty pre-made won't be able to faceroll 90% of our games anymore! Waaaaaah
---
Waaaaaah
---
Be a warrior / rogue and grab yourself some throwing weapons and you're all set
---
Thinking about a 19 hunter. That was good fun in vanilla!
---
On retail, you can "invest" $60 and skip the leveling.
---
Retail WoW is not real WoW. 
---
Did they change the models AFTER ZG was released? I thought it was way earlier
---
The first 12 levels of my first character ever, a gnome warrior, I spammed right-click on all the mobs I killed... Realized at lvl 12 that one right-click would do.
---
This reminds me of my favorite vanilla experience. I was doing Hogger with a lvl10 warrior. He hit me hard and we died. I asked him to taunt next time. His answer: "Taunt!? I ain't crazy, than he's gonna attack me."
---
It’s not the same game. That was vanilla this is classic. I have the CE and pets on my retail account. I would love this new endeavor to have its own collectors edition especially if it comes with a different book or movie about the journey it took to get here. Starting with the kid asking the question at blizz con. 
---
I don't see what part of the ordinary dictionary definition you are struggling with.
---
People use PvP in games as a way to bully others all the time. For a certain subset of PvPers that's the whole point of PvP.
---
There is a difference between a game permitting you to do a thing, and you having moral license to do that thing without being judged for it. You can take a 1200 health toon into 10-19 WSG, because that is a thing that the game lets you do. And you can and will be judged for it if you do. Simple.
---
I never understood the appeal in killing non twink chars as a twink. There is literally no competition, its like a trained shooter with a hand gun slaughtering a mob of medieval peasants 
---
I'm still not 100% sure I'll be able to play, but if I do there a pretty good chance I'll make some twinks. No way I'll have time to raid seriously so gearing up twinks and just having fun with my main will be my plan.
---
Gnome mage, dwarf priest are superior combo for pve and pvp, undead Warlock better for pve, but orc better for pvp. 
---
So i think better roll priest, because there always lack of them. 
---
Holy shit he's not pretending
---
Didn't know up to lvl 25+ that my shaman can use totems. I thought the instant shocks were his special thing... Had to go back to valley of trials to re-do earth totem quest. It was emberassing 
---
I mean you have it in your title just use - Old Bastards
---
It's tongue in cheek sure, however as a diehard LotR fan I must say, speaking a sealing spell in the tomb of Balin and defending it from the Balrog's counterspell was quite a feat of wizadry. The whole cave in which the tomb and the orc captain with his spear was located collapsed.
---
He nukes a great number of goblins in the Misty Mountains in the hobbit "a very ticklish business, touch and go" and in some battle (Battle of Five Armies or the Battle on the Morannon) he's described sitting in silence preparing a particularly difficult spell to take as many goblins with him as possible. Then the eagles come to the rescue naturally.
---
Or hurtling down from his pine tree into the goblins to kill lots and lots of them.
---
The reddit post is still funny.
---
In vanilla dm was deadmines because dire maul didn't actually exist for the first 5 months. 
---
Had a group of 59 twinks on frostmourne oceanic server back in the day that got a warrior Grand Marshal. It's possible. That was alliance side though which didn't often have long queue times.
---
When I didn't know how to leave a party, so I insulted the group leader until he kicked me...
---
Just don't make fresh servers, and if they do atleast not untill the batch of servers released before that the content is fully done. 
---
“Catch-up mechanic” is one of those buzzwords in modern WoW that just absolutely makes me want to vomit.
---
Great way to make investing time in your character feel completely pointless and unrewarding.
---
Looks alot less intimidating ingame. 
---
Played 6 months on German servers without knowing the language
---
Just priests. I have no idea. I thought I heard somewhere that they were going to do that with all classes but my brain could just be making crap up.  
---
I really have no clue. Just the way it is.  
---
I deleted/vendored upgrqades if I didn't like how they made my character look....
---
Took a kindly higher level player to tell me how wrong and stupid that was
---
sharding past the first month of launch
---
I didn't realize you could use the mouse to turn until I dueled a warrior at level 50 and he nearly got a flawless victory on me. I asked him how he turns in such a tight radius and he said "use your mouse" and my brain nearly collapsed after figuring it out.  
---
It's weird though because my keybindings were on point, I was just a damn keyboard turner at the same time.  
---
The quality of my game play increased dramatically after discovering the mouse turning bit though.  
---
It's amazing that there are still keyboard turners and clickers in the game today. I was watching a private server raid and saw a shaman key board turn to turn around and run when he became the bomb on Baron. I was amazed.  
---
There's even a mildly popular streamer who keyboard turns and clicks.  
---
I didn't actually. My brother got me into it and I had a couple of keybinds from the get go. Just kept adding more (he got annoyed with me about it too, heh). 
---
'dood' is 'boob' horizontally flipped, 'poop' is 'boob' vertically flipped, 'qooq' is 'poop' horizontally flipped, and 'dood' is 'qooq' vertically flipped.
---
I see alot of comments about how bad this mouse was... I didnt even care that the paint wore off like wtf its a mouse lol. I literally have never found a mouse like this again. it had symetrical wings on its side that fit my hand like no other mouse i have ever found. You can find mice with wings, but you cant find them with equal wings. If anyone knows of a mouse like that please let me know. I have spent countless hours searching.
---
I started when I was 9 and was almost 11 when Vanilla ended. Had two 60s, was Hunter class leader for my guild (lol) and got to mid-Naxx.
---
You mean Vanilla I assume?
---
If so, it’s honestly been too long so I can’t remember, but I’m sure I did plenty of stupid stuff.
---
Can’t bother writing a fake story either.
---
Vanilla release date: Nov 23, 2004
---
Dire Maul release date: Mar 7, 2005
---
Burning Crusade release date: Jan 16, 2007
---
Okay so 3.5 months out of vanillas 2+ year existence DM was in fact Deadmines. The other 20+ months it was def VC. 
---
If you truly played before 1.3 (DM release) then hats off to you. But I suspect you’re a staggered release private server tryhard. Anyone that actually played vanilla would know that 99% of people referred to as VC. 
---
Thanks for the downvotes. 
---
But not at launch: they were patched in later
---
It took me to around level 20 to figure out how to talk to people correctly. I remember someone selling 6 slot bags in general i kept typing i want one but got no response.. I also remember my first character i was in Ashenvale someone messaged me asked if i could help with a VC run i said yes then quickly realized first i had no clue where the Dead mines was and second that there was another continent. I ended up quietly leaving that group after i googled and realized it would take me 45 mins at least just to get there.
---
Tell you what if BG's aren't cross-realm when it comes out then twinking is probably gonna be dead if they run with the old WoW server population caps, cause trying to get a 10-19 BG on a certain server that goes far beyond that rumored cap can take like 10mins in off-peak hours, and that off-peak hour has more players than the rumored cap so it would be a lot longer on official servers. 
---
it's no different than people killing low levels. Cause you can. 
---
The 2 hour BoP loot trading window. 
---
Well I know I'd want some gratz if I hit level 5040.
---
Lol. 
---
I really though this would have ended differently 
---
I deleted my paladin because he did no damage when I got a new 2h sword. I didn't know about weapon skills back then.
---
I levelled my warrior to around 45ish without any talent points because I didn't know you could respec, didn't want to choose wrongly......and I loved shields so it took flipping aaaaages
---
Found a gnome 
---
(Bare in mind I’m probably only 10 years old at the time) Was a dwarf paladin in westfall, Horde orc warrior with a skull as his level was attacking Sentinel Hill, he switched to berserker stance and because the stance shows a dwarfs head I figured that meant he could kill dwarfs easier so I shit a brick and ran away :)
---
When I discovered that wands exist for a reason. I leveled my priest till 22 without using a wand xD
---
Christ
---
I love the bit about your epiphany though haha
---
They'll all know English though.
---
if you want someone to fill in when you're missing a third i'm available.  
---
my name on origin is zekkzekkzekk
---
Idk. As long as they get it right.
---
Invalidating gear combined with the strategy of 'no BiS' with titanforging and RNG coming out the seems is counter productive.  It'll be nice to have a structured gearing system again. 
---
nah we made our own characters and played with her to let her set the pace. I think it would have just put her off if we tried to rush her or told her exactly where to go or what to do x)
---
Now that's video content creating! Thanks, laughed hard. :)
---
They did say that classic is more of a fan project of theirs and don't care how many people want to play it. I hope they keep it as is, but if they do want to explore other expansions having a different server entirely for it would make the most sense. 
---
I joined at the tail end of vanilla wow (got to level 54 just before TBC), I've literally never seen anyone refer to it as VC in vanilla. It might just be on a server by server basis, so your server might've called it VC while others didn't.
---
Sitting out of combat legit increases HP regen (but not mana).
---
You will have a rough time solo. You will have a rough time before you are geared. You will have a rough time if you do not like to tank dungeons.
---
You will have a fantastic time if you play with friends. You will be loved if you like tanking and can do it competently (don’t even have to be great). You will enjoy yourself immensely once you are geared.
---
There are always warriors, but there are never enough good warriors. If you are a min max dps type of player, or a tank then warrior is a good choice. If not, I think you’ll be more successful with a different choice.
---
at arround lvl 20 on my feral druid struggling to kill mobs on my lvl i realised there are class trainers to learn new talents and improve old ones.
---
Downsides are you'll get annihilated by murlocs early game and you will be competing with not only other warriors but also rogues and even hunters to some extent for gear, so unless you're willing to tank dungeons and just never invite those classes it could take a while to gear up.
---
Upsides are if you put in the extra effort you can become the best tank, one of the best dps and a meat grinder in pvp.
---
How are Warriors in wpvp? Im assuming terrible when you're undergeared but they're good when geared?
---
It was most certainly not good for several classes.!
---
I'd argue dwarf is better for rogue.  
---
The same rules hold true: 1v1 will suck for most fights. Group fights you’ll feel unstoppable in. This gets better with gear.
---
Didn't mean to insult people. Thought pocket healer is a legitimate term used in the community. 
---
Do we have connecting flight paths in this patch. I think it was introduced in Classic at some point but not sure when?
---
I think I actually started off with a mix of keybinds for main spells and clicking for less used stuff. But I'd been playing EQ for years so I was used to having number hotkeys at least.
---
Hmm maybe ill just level a rogue then i leveled to around 40 on a rogue when nost was around and really enjoyed it i just kind of miss swinging a huge sword around so i was wondering how warriors were thanks for helping me out it means a lot (:
---
How does horde get to Darnassus?
---
Definitely not
---
Bro. You always take a girl to Teldrassil her first time playing. ALWAYS.  
---
I feel like we would mostly do BGs, but if there is a generic build, that might be better. 
---
you will allways struggle wpvp 1v1 vs other classes unless they are significantly under your gear/skill lvl
---
If you back yourself in to be an above average player in terms of skills and commitment, it’s a great choice. Though end game they’ll be heaps of warriors doing dps, so maybe tanking is the way to go.
---
No I won't. And if you have to ask why, you have to come out under this rock. The news are available for everyone. 
---
They are fairly accurate. For the purposes of getting a feel of playing vanilla/classic, they are authentic. I really dont see how you can fail getting on, even a technically challenged dude like me had no issues.
---
Sounds like fun, I could do that for decades on end 
---
This is literally how I felt the first time I played MC =)
---
Happy memories 
---
Can confirm made it to Yogg server first as key board turner. 
---
I still hate myself for not being better. 
---
I started playing in the open beta and played from day1 until late 2006, then started again when TBC came out. 
---
On the 3 servers I played on during vanilla it was always dm. When I came back during TBC some idiots tried to claim it was VC but they were quickly corrected. 
---
No bc.
---
i can hardly find words to describe how important this is to me. Without this beeing the Case i would not come back after so many years because i simply dont have the time to chase a neverending loot spiral.
---
Last boss in ST is perfect to start the fight with a pet tanking, maybe even the best one. It can take the heat and once the sleep comes, main tank takes over.
---
Great, now where do I get this "girlfriend" you're talking about?
---
I would call myself an Original. 
---
she got to decide and although she laughed uncontrollably at how silly the gnome looked, she did NOT want to be an elf
---
I agree with you, and I pretty much bought WoW day one when it came out. Exclusive *anything* as well as achievement trackers are fucking cancer and have no place in MMOs. I hate nothing more than games that do this kind of shit where they put the old guard on a pedestal for just being present for certain events and then take away said items from being earned again by new players. It's especially annoying when you are the sort of person that plays daily, but then miss out on key events because you had health issues or whatever, only to be told you should've been there and that now it's too late. It's just a spit in the face. 
---
Yes
---
Bad, engineering makes it less horrible, but you can't afford that anyway
---
I always wondered why hunters don't use a pet as off-tank cc in trash packs?
---
Broken tooth, I choose you!
---
Yes, the idea that people should be recognized for shelling out 60 dollars 15 years ago seems antithetical to the philosophy of vanilla. I understand they want the recognition and they can get it in retail. Classic , as I said before , is a clean slate for everyone. 
---
You are right, but still no need of full set imo. If u get the chest too u have 4% hit and 1 crit, with the boots too u only gain 1% crit more and u are forced to have Tailoring at 60. I rather have bloodvine chest and legs and the boots from BWL. But that's my opinion.
---
Heard a rumor its cancelled :O just a rumor but its been how long and no word? Just a thought but if they did cancel they wouldn't say so until summer because why have more months of backlash!! I hope I'm not right and the rumor isn't correct but. Summer 2019 blizzard announces the cancelation of classic release to focus on creating better games and development for current games! Sorry if it comes true
---
WoW tokens
---
I think he means ‘lemon.’
---
Classic Wow or TBC
---
All they need to say is no changes, they have said that.
---
Now all they have to do is remove loot trading and automated report system, and you know. Actually make it no changes
---
boomers
---
It is, and no one's seriously offended. I just think it's a dumb term is all.
---
CRB was vanilla. I lol at these "more Catholic than the Pope" #nochangers who don't even want vanilla in "their" "vanilla".
---
I'm 20 and when I was younger I watched my dad play with wide, wishful eyes.  Now I finally get to have my go, and i only wish he was still interested in the game to join again.
---
I played a ton of lvl 19 back in the day.. definitely going to make one in classic, although I want to try out 39 because it has the slowest weapon in the game: Pendulum of Doom. Its one of my favorite weapons...
---
Also I kinda want to try something different and make a lvl 40 world pvp twink, because I get a mount, and access to lvl 40 talents..
---
C.O.L.D. S.N.A.P. B.O.I.S.
---
Raid viable for a short time with t5 set bonus
---
This Sir, is exactly what I want it to be too. Would be perfect!
---
Honestly I’m more excited to meet and play with the younger players. Tired of these “back in my day” attitude of the older players. Classic is for everyone.
---
wpvp does suck with warrior, but it is imo the most fun class for BGs. I am same, love swinging my huge thing around, watching crazy big numbers flying.
---
Good job. I made sure that when my partner just turned right and wanted to explore I did my best to get us there, even if it was so far away from being leveling efficient you could get.
---
Running around in the **world** of warcraft is amazing, i wished they had focused more on the world and less on raiding content sometimes, even if I'm a dedicated raider, perhaps a smal team that spent all their time adding smaller quests, finishing zones, redesigning some crypts that look 100% the same etc.
---
I had to do this intentionally just so i could bet a decent 15+fps in dungeons
---
As a rule of thumb, if you don't get charge+hamstring off you're dead.
---
You'll have an easier time getting daggers and fist weapons but you'll never match a human rogue's raid dps.
---
I wonder what was even the point making the outdoor map for AQ. Maybe if they didn't waste time on that they could actually finish Silithus on launch.
---
If you are dying because healers go oom you need more dps -&gt; higher threat. In MC / BWL you don’t need to be def capped (only perhaps for Chromo/Nef)
---
Nothing 
---
Mage + pally or warrior for horde (ideally you would have 2 60s for Max speed - this is how the. Hinese do it on lightshope).
---
 Obviously you can do it with just 1 but slower which would be a mage
---
This would cause more outrage than diablo on the phone considering theyve already received payment from people to play the demo.  They'd likely release a bad private server before they announced the cancellation of the project.
---
I don't care about 60s in greens, I care about enjoying myself. Rolling over 60s in greens is boring as fuck. I've already done that for hundreds of hours when required to in expansion content for honor gear in new seasons. It was never engaging or challenging.
---
Sounds like it'll be even worse with no resilience and no tangible reward.
---
Lol. You should try challenging yourself, it's much more fulfilling.
---
Fuck yes, I'd frame that shit
---
Oh it would be terrible, if that happened it could be the death of them. I can't wait to play classic, its a terrible rumor
---
Im 14 and really excited for WoW classic I have no one to play with cause no one seems to want to play with a 14 year old and everyone my age dont really play mmorpgs I have experience in WoW legion but I stopped playing by BfA because I wasnt happy with how the game was
---
Nobody in EU called it VC and I'm pretty sure dire maul was already in the game for EU release.
---
&gt; If you are dying because healers go oom you need more dps -&gt; higher threat.
---
True, if the problem is that the DPS are threat capped. Otherwise, back to avoidance.
---
&gt; In MC / BWL you don’t need to be def capped (only perhaps for Chromo/Nef)
---
You don't *need* a lot of things. But crushing blows are a damage spike that could cause a wipe and getting rid of them is certainly a viable way to be a good tank.
---
Go look up the definition of "bullying".
---
I assume you're talking about mages. Aoe spec is perfectly capable of questing and running 5 man's. It's not particularly great at PvP but it has high survivability so it's fine. Only thing you'd really want to respec for are raids. 
---
Most people naturally didn't want to com in english which is fair given their choice to play on German speaking servers.
---
wow,classicwow,woservers subreddit stalking game :D
---
Sure, there isn’t just 1 viable way. In truth it is a mix of a lot of things. It is you and up to 39 other people so you can mix your stats in a lot of ways. If it works it works. Personally, I focus on threat and it has served me well because we have capable DPS and healers. If my healers sucked or DPS were trash I would certainly opt for more effective health.
---
I found mine in classic wow - its not only the best game, its the best dating app too!
---
My turn to post this video tomorrow. Just letting u guys know
---
Like I said way back at the start, if you aren't dying and the boss is, it doesn't matter. It's only something you need to worry about if the raid is wiping and the tank is the issue.
---
I am not that old lol
---
So the originals ?
---
I kind of agree 
---
i disenchanted my epic dagger instead of envenoming it.
---
Porting to a city before delivering a quest.
---
The feeling has been there for the last 10 years. Got to learn to live with it.
---
Playing BotW (again) right now.
---
I started during the BC launch, and we were still having the DM vs VC argument. DM won out most of the time. By the end of the expac, all the "but we should call out VC!!!" people were gone and I never heard it again.
---
So to me it's always going to be DM.
---
Image having this set already and it suddenally going through redesign.
---
Warriors shine at endgame in all the aspects. Both pvp and pve. The problem is reaching that point. You will die 20200202202020202022020 times before reaching 60 for both from players and mobs.
---
Honestly I agree with you on this. Not saying they should inform us every day about their progress, however some info let's say once per month would be nice.
---
Or some kind of Q&amp;A, but for Classic. But yeah, we need more info.
---
Don't think so.
---
If you aren’t dying and the boss is there is still room for improvement and good tanks will always strive to fill that gap, just my two cents. 
---
She lives in Brill? 
---
I'd kill myself if this happen.
---
What was that lower bar on the bottom of the screen called again?
---
Titan panel
---
I remember being disappointed at first. Not later though. 
---
What info is needed?
---
They're remaking it. They're not re-tuning boss fights or doing anything that require patch notes. They're just working on making everything stable until they're (most likely) going to have a short beta phase for stress tests.
---
It's not about not "handling it" but instead spouting unfounded rumors. What is your source?
---
the lack of consumables..... I see one (?) mungoose
---
We had guild flasks! 🤔 
---
There's a difference between not being equally viable and being so bad in a role that you will never get into a raid.
---
Retribution Paladins for example have some of the worst DPS in the game that doesn't improve until they get gear that Arms Warriors would be fighting amongst themselves over. There are several methods in which their viability can be increased, and you could do one of several things:
---
* Adding Crusader Strike as a baseline ability available from level 1 - This gives pallies an extra button to press and was actually something Blizzard considered when originally developing the game.
---
* Allowing Exorcism to be cast on non-undead targets, but maybe add a guaranteed chance to crit on Undead targets.
---
* Adding a greater incentive to use higher ranks of Seal of Command. The problem with SoC is that most pallies downranked it to Rank 1 because the PPM proc always did the same damage, while the damage of the Judgement was rather inconsequential. I dunno what this incentive could be... maybe a debuff on higher ranks of the Seal that would benefit the raid?
---
* Adding Seal of the Martyr as a baseline ability. A seal that does more damage than Seal of Command or Seal of Righteousness but which causes damage to the Paladin would be interesting. This was something that Horde Paladins got in Burning Crusade and which Alliance Paladins briefly had until the ability was stripped from them in early Wrath.
---
* Give Retribution Paladins the option to dual wield, which would immensely buff their Seal of Righteousness build. It's actually hilarious that Enhancement Shamans gained the ability to dual wield in later expansions whereas despite being holy plate wearing warriors, Paladins are still unable to do the same.
---
Early in Vanilla I thought I had to right click for every auto.
---
I spammed right click during combat and wondered how anyone could play without breaking a mouse.
---
While your options will most likely be limited if you play a class, specc or role in a nonoptimal way, you'll find a guild fore sure if you put into the time and energy. Especially if you are the one bringing lots of other non dps positive stuff to the table.
---
You do not need a optimal raid group to finish all the content in the game. It will certainly help, especially aq-naxx. Some guilds will care more about who you are, how active you are rather then having the most optimal specc and class for your role. 
---
Retribution paladin can bring nightfall, or be really open about respeccing if a healer is needed. Making him a asset nonetheless even if he bring shit dps.
---
Druids can dps and tank quite well, and a guild these days (in private servers atleast) usually want atleast one good feral druid player, especially for clearing farmed content faster. 
---
You will have the biggest problem with balance druid I think, but while your dps will be low you are not worthless on healing even when you dont respecc, you will still be accepted in some guilds, even on the merit of playing mostly dps as I hardly see there being less guilds around this time, since its much easier to build up the administrative part of maintaining a raiding guild, meaning there could be a shortage of raiders compared to how many guilds there are. And if anything most guilds would rather fill the dps spot with someone active then to raid with less then 40 people.
---
Well the evidence is blue posts from 1.10 (posted above) people who played 1.12 and the classic demo.
---
The magic formula is that you dont get reckoning stacks from NPC white hits when sitting down.
---
The only way to abuse it is maybe server lag and the server thinks you already stood up when you spam it.
---
Warcraft 3.
---
So they can't handle a "spouted unfounded rumor" haha ok smh
---
Go back to troll school, boy. That was weak.
---
what about Elixir of Fortitude? Winterfall Firewater? Jujus, FAPs, LIPs, Food? Protection potions, E gineering?
---
Be patient. Good things take time. 
---
If you aren't dying and the boss is, making any of your numbers bigger is an improvement and it really doesn't matter which you make bigger.
---
Should have. According to wowpedia they became linked in 1.10.0.
---
honestly stfu
---
Evidently it wasn't, it got all the snowflakes jimmies rustled including yours! But you are going to say "nah not me you just bad troll" even though it affected you enough to make you comment ;)
---
Yes, because I didn't think of getting the CE first time around.
---
Yeah I agree, if you actually get HoR then you get a huuge powerspike, especially if you manage to obtain the maelstrom trinket aswell. from T2+HoR and upwards, you are very scary in PvP, just gotta do everything you possibly can to deny getting kited
---
Hang on, I thought there were travel nodes in Silithus and Un'goro?
---
Only tryhard guilds will force you into a certain spec, and if you don't want to min/max you shouldn't join a tryhard guild.  
---
  
---
This whole class x can only play spec y in raids is blown way out of proportion, you just won't be first pick in a pug, but pugs suck anyway. 
---
Was that a osrs reference?
---
This, 100%
---
wow dude why the profanity?
---
I'm a veteran btw. Served in STVietnam back in 2005. 
---
Did I mention I'm a veteran?
---
I found it was my biggest moment, but the first one that comes to mind is having a lot of trouble leaving the starting zone, because I'd totally slipped half of it and was underlevelled. Getting through the trogg cave was terrible!
---
Let’s agree to disagree.
---
OMG yes! Also they CAN open a TBC progression or even wrath after that, BUT WITHOUT messing with the classic servers, you go through the dark portal you char gets copied to a new server and the old one remains untouched. 
---
P.S. I don’t think I can’t wait anymore, retail is a chore and ALL private servers are sh*t
---
Tbh I don’t think it was required for ZG. But did all those stack? Wasn’t that fixed back then. Don’t remember mate, so long ago. I remember always being broke though. 😃
---
I will never purchase anything blizzard related after losing my job of 7 years
---
I think the impact of the +5 Swords racial is slightly overrated, at least for Rogues.
---
There is a debate as to what exact formula determined glancing damage on retail (Athan's, Hermit's and some other one iirc), however they are all pretty close and they ALL show that basically the first +5 bonus skill (300-&gt;305) was insane, the next 5 points were very good and above 310 you would have a gain significantly lower (some formulas implying no gain at all after 315, some other a slight, but that's another story).
---
Rogues had their talent revamp in 1.12 and for the vast majority of Vanilla they did not had the +5 skill point to all Weapon form the combat tree, which all Rogue take in PvE spec.
---
With 0 +skill, your glancing blows, which represent 40% of your auto-attacks, deal 65% of the damage of a regular swing against a level 63 target.
---
With +5 skill, this becomes 85%.
---
With a Human +5 Swords, this becomes 95%.

This means if you're a Swords Rogue Human versus non-Human, and without taking into account Maladath for now: being Human grants you an increase of your glancing blows damage of roughly 11,76%. It is significant, and translated to around 4,7% of your overall auto-attack damage considering GB represent 40% of your attack-table. Then as a Combat Swords Rogue, auto-attack represent an important fraction of your DPS, around 60%, which makes the benefit of the Human +2,82% - roughly.
---
This is a lot interns of Min-Maxing, because this means that all other things being equal, you'll do 2-3% less damage that a Human Swords Rogue as a non-Human Swords Rogue.
---
Now in addition to the above, you could also consider that the Sword Maladath gives +4 Swords. Spreadsheet calculations have shown that Human do not use Maladath, since they already have too much +Swords with it, due to the formula works.
---
This means a non-Human with Maladath would have 309 Swords, i.e. a GB damage reduction of 6.49%, while a Human without Maladath would have 310 and a 5% reduction.
---
This would give the Human a +1.59% average damage on his GB, i.e. around +0.64% on his overall auto-attacks which, on the basis of auto-attacks representing 60% of your DPS, would translate to a whopping +0.38% overall DPS.
---
On the other hand, of course we should factor-in that the Human bonus allows the human to go for a better off-hand than Maladath, which is commonly accepted as being the Brutality Blade at this level (BWL-ish) of gear.
---
I guess this further reduces the gap between Human and non-Human, as the DPS increase for the human going from Maladath to Brutality might be lower than the one of the non-Human going from Brutality to Maladath - I haven't ran any math on this last statement though.
---
The exact number regarding the modeling of the exact opportunity cost for each Rogue regarding the weapon choice would require a lot of maths since it would require to take into account the exact gear of each rogue and a lot of assumptions regarding fights etc.
---
Note I also excluded the slight bonus in hit and crit that you gain from +skill. I think they are negligible but would slightly tilt the balance in the favor of humans of course.
---
Anyway, long story short, as a non-human Swords you should except to do around 3% less damage than a Human before Maladath, and if you have one the spread should be even lower.
---
It is significant if you'remin-maxing, however it isn't *that* much if you're not. I feel someone not experienced just reading the comments here and there about how OP the human racial was would feel that he have no chance to match the DPS of another Human Rogue if he isn't, while this is far from reality.
---
The fact that most Rogues topping the meters are human is indeed related to the fact that they are human and min-maxing, but also to the fact that they all know to play their class and that very few rogues that are min-maxing are non-human, it's not like a non-Human couldn't compete with them *AT ALL*. They're just good players who don't want to sit on any extra damage.
---
P.S.: I used Athan's formula for all calculations related to GB reductions above.

post details some of the numbers / gains expected when fighting a lvl 63 boss. weapon skill isn't all that important in pvp as i believe its capped. but yea its pretty beneficial

burning crusade

I started playing about 6 months before TBC launched, and it wasn't until MoP I realised that I should bind "a" and "d" to strafe left/right instead of turn left/right. I had been playing WoW for over 5 years holding town mouse 2 everytime to use strafe movement.
---
These dudes are clearly about to die.
---
Although he’s Actually the easiest raid boss in vanilla 
---
Troll priest with this spec [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGRbbZf0tZVMGpcz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGRbbZf0tZVMGpcz) is amazing for PVP, both in premades and 1v1
---
Dwarf hunter wearing Raging Beserker Helm. Checks out. 
---
We'd all love some more info, but i don't think it is unusual to not provide more. Honestly, looking at this community, I would be extra hesitant given the very aggressive and outrage-prone nature of the community.
---
Uh, no xD It was added in MoP.
---
Is she single?
---
When my husband got me into this game years ago, moving was the first big hurdle as well. Funnily enough, he was the one who moved with the keyboard so naturally, he was trying to teach me to do that, but I found it extremely uncomfortable. I figured out by accident, on my own, that I could use the mouse to move, and I never looked back.
---
Agreed for the most part.  However, i liked how they used to "retune" endgame difficulty after a few months.  Raids remained difficult, but opened up to slightly less hardcore guilds.
---
A friend of mine and I used to take tours of folks down there. We got on top of the front gate first from the outside and then jumped down into it. It's a big flat spot with a huge valley in the middle. 
---
All you really need is 2/3 imp blizzard and you can aoe farm. So it’s fine for raiding. It’s not great for pvp because you don’t have frostbite. 
---
Some people are actually this dumb bro
---
Indeed. Space Invaders is the game of my childhood, nothing else fits like the Original.
---
/player.additem 2000g
---
Yes.
---
Serious question, what is VC? I've never heard the term before
---
In no particular order.. 
---
When I first started, a few mates already played. They told me to roll a mage and "just do *damage*", so that's what I did. I thought frost nova was crap, cause it did so little *damage*. Sheep? Forget it.
---
I was called out in a BG for wearing a ring from the Deadmines, at level 60.. I simply hadn't come across anything better, cause all I did to level was grind mobs endlessly. Besides, rings don´t do damage! 
---
Think I was \~level 65 when someone told me I could sheep beasts.. 
---
Nice! Hopefully you will enjoy it 
---
With the Alliance ship. The better question would be: Why should horde go there? (Except for raiding Darnassus)
---
Tips is a chode
---
Good stuff. But Brutality is by no means better than Maladath for humans. Maladath is still bis for human rogues till Naxx. 
---
I stayed so far away from enchanting for years because it felt like only these badass elite players could have both the money and materials/understanding for this. The thought of how expensive it was used to freak me out, so I'd just continue to mine and herb hah.
---
I’ve seen this spec a few times now. What’s the overall objective. I feel like shadow form is just downright OP, but could be way off 
---
There is 
---
Honestly the less info the better, if they release any information on classic there will be one side that'll just complain we are a minimum 3-4 months away 
---
First release there was none. Cenarion Hold came in 1.9, but I think one node roght at the entrance was added in 1.6 with Thunderaaan.
---
Having a good power curve is one of the best things about classic and one of the main reasons retail has become a failure. 
---
You will still know that you are the original collector. It doesn’t hurt other players that they are able to get it too.
---
Yes 
---
Revantusk Village in The Hinterlands also missing. 
---
Seasonal servers? Have seasons which last 6 months or 1 year long and when the season is over, transfer any characters made to the main servers.
---
Dude, very very few people did all that shit back in vanilla
---
Ideally there would be a separate Classic CE that only works in the classic and the retail CE only works on retail. Both sides would be happy.
---
Ffxiv, apex legends has been a good time, gw2 always has something for me to do, working on wc3 skills for reforged.
---
Ohh, im sorry to say this but - your husband is a noob. Good luck with the divorce!
---
Thailand
---
Superstition was that the loot is effected by who is the raid leader in game. Suffice to say after we got an Eye of Sulfuras and a Left Binding in an MC run when I was the leader, I always got to be it :D 
---
I'm 21 and I started with the cata demo before moving on to vanilla private servers.  
---
Sounds selfish but as a warrior who enjoys tanking indo not invite warrior dps into my group. You are free kills for any hunter or mage in wpvp, even ones who are 7 or 8 levels below you. 
---
LMAO-- he could be a fantastic player, but he just doesn't care!
---
There's usually at least one these players hanging out in the same spot on the currently popular pserver trying to own the Horde noobs.
---
It would be nice If it was part of a new collectors edition 
---
Especially back in that patch. The full-on consumable stacking didn't really take off until AQ and moreso Naxxramas, and even then only among really hardcore guilds. If I'm not mistaken explicitly utilising world buffs for kill attempts only started among top guilds in late Naxxramas.
---
oldschool rs
---
I got Joanas guide and decided to level a Hunter, after failing so miserably on my mage... I was level 10 in mail wondering when I got my bow or pet.
---
I had, of course, actually rolled a warrior.
---
In hindsight I did very well on him! 
---
Charm fear and sleep. Warlocks fear, and how of terror. Succubus seduction. Priests psychic scream.
---
Oh man when’s this coming out. The wait is killing me
---
I remember seeing a skulled rogue in Brill and thought he was an NPC, I got so excited trying to kill him a few times....
---
I'm 24 and missed Vanilla by a few months, joined sometime in TBC. 
---
After I came back in Cata I always felt like something was not quite the same but I still had fun during that time. It was only when I tried WoD that I knew that the devs don't make WoW for players like me anymore. I recently tried BFA but honestly it's just a bad game now. It hurts to say that because WoW is a game I've sunk thousands and thousands of hours in and I am passionate about, but it's straight up bad these days. (Not that anyone here isn't aware of that.)
---
Anyway, very excited for Classic to drop. It might surprise a lot as to how well it does. The old game had a fantastic formula that just sucked you in and made you become so invested in your character and the world and there's no reason to say that young people who try WoW now won't be captured like the older generation was.
---
Got his bijous and coins too, his rogue doll, his fire res gear. Neat screenshot.
---
Vanilla problems require vanilla solutions
---
Warframe 
---
Si si
---
AQ quest chain.
---
You're right in saying boomkin and cat are not viable dps specs in raids, and bear is 99% of the time never taken to progression raiding.
---
However, when I played back in Vanilla, I vividly remember an Alliance (I played Horde) r14 boomkin repeatedly topping the charts in AV every single time I played.
---
With the right gear boomkins can be absolutely lethal in BG's, and are as others have said very good flag carriers.
---
Cat on the other hand are just worse rogues imo. Still good fc's, and might be better at defending a base in AB.
---
It was patch 1.9. Ahn'Qiraj.
---
This. My concept of buffs up until AQ was bringing a couple greater fire protection potions and health potions to MC and BWL.
---
My never really seriously started to look at consumables until C'Thun.
---
I linked this map in your other thread, why create another post?
---
Will I have to purchase BfA (or something else?) to get classic? Or can I just sub up to get on the servers?
---
We are going Druid - Mage
---
I played warlock in vanilla, but this time around on private server I needed a nightelf since my partner picked night elf hunter and I really wanted the first levels to go smooth. I have no love for rogues, did not want to play a warrior and never liked shadow priests so druid it was, also since i figured we'll have a easy time with dungeons as i could heal, dps or tank. 
---
When we hit about 54 we got invited to a raiding guild and they where intrested in having a feral, so i got the guides up and started working on it. Never looked back since then as the versatility is awesome.  As I got several comments from even guild mates about how useless feral druids where it also became kind of  principle to prove them wrong.
---
I am glad she is going mage for I have always coveted the quick gold farming. She is picking it more for the sake of class fantasy I think as she lit up when hearing about making water, bread, portals and becoming an alchemist, picking herbs and brewing potions. I think a feral or a resto druid fits perfectly into it, combined with the versatility and overall challenge as a class I am set on playing a druid. 
---
Private Server...
---
It is literally a fictional war, acted out by the players. There are honorable people, like ourselves, and there aren't honorable people, like those who crash funerals.
---
I don't attack unless in self defense, but I also don't expect others to be that generous. Maybe play on PvE servers? 
---
I think it's fantastic. It proves that Classic isn't just blind hype from behind rose tinted goggles.
---
You can tell it's an authentic vanilla screenshot from the lack of consumables in the bags!
---
"pRivAtE sErVerS aRe Baaaad!"
---
It's also the first bracket where hunters and rogues don't completely dominate everyone else and most other classes become viable. Takes a whole lot longer to level your twinks to 39 though, unfortunately.
---
Hateful Strike cannot crit.
---
What do you mean afk? If you think they went afk because they're not moving that's the whole point of the Roguecraft series.
---
They *can't* move, because they're stunlocked. Depending on your class, some of the PvP trinkets didn't remove stuns.
---
They're not afk, they literally cannot move. 
---
What you are missing here is that when tanks dont go for full mitigation gear, the DPS are able to go more or less all in, which leads to dramatically shortened fight lengths.
---
How do you beat a shadow priest after he's mana burned all of your mana?
---
How do you beat a warlock after you've used your trinket and he's burned all your mana? 
---
Go for melee hunter if u like big 2h crits. Ez
---
He'd better have gquit after that.
---
I'm gonna Zug Zug that shieldboi to pieces until I get that item.
---
Look, warriors are great fun and wanted in groups, in spite of the high population. Great gameplay and class fantasy. 
---
The downsides will make many people stop somewhere in the questing process. So what, play it till you get to 60 or till u burn out. No bigggie
---
# WE HAVE TO TELL THEM! TWEET THEM! SEND THEM STUFF! DO IT! MORE DOTS!
---
Honestly overlord emberseer is easier 
---
As of right now. Apex Legends.
---
Oof.
---
He may be, it wasn't him talking to be fair, he had some experienced warlock on. Didn't realise his name meant down votes here! 
---
Isn't the ship from Auberdine going to Stormwind instead of Menethil Harbor?
---
Please dont play classic.  
---
I guess play retail then?
---
Interesting question, I'd say a sub will be all that's necessary but I wouldn't put it past them
---
Ah, so the rest of Deadmines is cleared and only Vancleef is up. Makes sense now.
---
Hi, /u/EmergencyBrick
---
Played a Warlock. Took the talent that improved Firestones. Would melee enemies with Firestone empowered dagger.
---
Still remember fighting those spiders in Loch Moran like that.
---
Every class has better and worse spec. That never changed in wow. That didn't stop people playing these and finding guilds where they were accepted. Classic is not about only big numbers. Every class is unique because it brings utilities like Soulstone, Blessings, bubbles, Poly, traps and so on and on. Except rogues. Greedy fucks have numbers and that's it. (Poly&gt;Sap).
---
I think we’ve got to learn the actual date soon if it’s mid this year (summer)
---
You are talking about one aspect of playing a warrior - the decision making aspect.  I think you have forgotten how much you know about a warrior and their gameplay.  
---
The gearing and mechanics of actually playing a warrior are what I referring to.   2h vs DW.  Fury vs. Arms.  Choosing how much hit/crit.  White Damage.  Glancing Blows.  Swing Timers.  +Axe/+Sword skill.  Hamstring kiting.  Choosing the proper speed weapon to fit in skills.  When to charge or not (warriors wait for a mage to blink before intercept).  Rage management.  Consumable use.  Waiting for a dodge to use overpower (if I remember the skill correctly).
---
As a warlock I may have more difficult decision making.  But everything else is much more simple.  I stack stamina and spell power.  I stand and cast spells, I just have to choose the right spell and the right person.  There is some pet management also.  All i do is stand and cast spells, maybe click a button for my pet occasionally.
---
I'm more of a PVE guy than PVP, so I do look at things through that lens sometimes.  Warlocks are even more simple in PVE, spam shadowbolt right?  Anyway I think warriors are complex, but maybe that is just from my vantage point.
---
The land of freedom and justice, where the free and honorous live! ZUG ZUG!
---
The masses wanted it.
---
they have said all you need is a sub
---
'I'm a hybrid, I'm a warrior but I play like a rogue' 
---
I said this in my first or second run of Deadmines at level 18ish. I was 12 years old. I thought the only special part of a rogue was stabbing people from behind, so thus when I was on my warrior I would attack people from behind and pretend I was a rogue.
---
This is discounting the fact that it wasn't until level 30~ish that my friend who got me into WoW inspected me, saw I had cloth, leather and mail on my warrior, with 2 handed sword, and my talents randomly spewed across the 3 talents trees on whichever icon I thought was best. He told me how talents work, that I needed mail until I could use plate, and said 'hey, maybe you should play Fury, you get TWO 2H swords!'
---
Since then I've mained Fury Warrior
---
Which warrior looks better, orc or human? 
---
I dont play a warrior, but my friend I run dungeons with does, he refuses to group with another plate. And I know theres a lot of tanks like that out there.
---
&gt; I’m just mainly worried that when I cap I’ll be forced to heal as a Druid or pally.
---
So dont play a pala or druid then? If you want to raid in Classic and not heal dont choose a heal class.
---
I have guildmates to this day who keyboard turn.
---
I've raided in some good guilds and on ZG release, if you have Mc and bwl gear there's no need at all for consumes unless you're suuuper hard-core, it's easily cleared. Some ppl popped a mongoose for the heck of it but popping jujus and shit? Nah dud
---
I thought I could DPS as a Ret Paladin at 60... with an 2.8 speed weapon.
---
Last big WoW update basically gives players a free peiece of ilvl400-ish gear. You had to work up to mythic 10s to get gear that high before. Completely invalidated all my hard work and  killed my motivation to play the game.
---
You're right, I've been living under a rock. *Why* won't play on the strictly vanilla servers just because other servers exist?
---
&gt; It might just be on a server by server basis, so your server might've called it VC while others didn't.
---
Must be. Every server I was ever on called it VC. Personally I roll my eyes when people call it DM.
---
That's not the reason and you know it.
---
&gt; Catch-up mechanic” is one of those buzzwords in modern WoW
---
It's not a buzzword. The constant poaching and leaving in guilds was a huge problem.
---
Coulda been worse, I tried to run my level 18 mage north from Lakeshire... through the Burning Steppes...
---
I think his corpse is still there on the road with the level ?? elementals.
---
I don't think so. They already made the game, we know what to expect and we know that they are committed to an authentic recreation. There isn't anything beyond that they could communicate that would be of use to us. Most of the work they do is probably technical in nature and not the type of thing they feel needs to be talked about.
---
I seriously have no idea what you're talking about. OP said there could be both unchanged vanilla servers and changed vanilla servers. OP said if you didn't like the latter then you could play the former. You said you wouldn't. Why?
---
Paladin, Shaman and Druid sets were trash.
---
Mage, Priest and Warlock were pretty bad.
---
Warrior, Hunter and Rogue were OK
---
I also buffed the living Hell out of Teldrassil and Darkshore on my Druid when I started playing.
---
Van Cleef
---
It bothers me to look at other people's bag arrangements. I always keep at least my backpack empty to catch all the new stuff I loot in one place. It also makes vendoring trash much easier.
---
Princess Theradras?
---
This is not bloodfang gear.. this is tier 1 rogue gear, nightslayer...lollll
---
I dont. Last thing I need to be reminded of is cringy 15 year old emo me.

Now you just need the Holy Grail and it’ll be complete.

A few days ago I saw a lv 8 gnome there and right when I was about to kill him he goes into this random ass chimney and glitches out to where nothing can get him. True cowards.

Yeah, that feeling when you dodge the first two mob attacks and it's like: ah fuck.

Like those?
---
That Enchanting shtick is a classic.
---
Say something like “I tried to remove an enchant from my weapon and my weapon disappeared can anyone help?” in Trade chat and watch the responses explode. Always gets some laughs.
---
“Remove an enchant? What do you mean? You can’t remove enchants. Did you disenchant it?”
---
These are awesome suggestions.. be hard getting that trinket in BWL though I could imagine
---
Is it true what they say: "time is money friend"?
---
Yep it was horrible lol
---
But why factory sealed?
---
No, time is time and money is money. 
---
There is no port in Stormwind in classic. The ship goes to Menethil and you have to make the wetlands run as a Nightelf. 
---
Stacking armour as a hunter in an attempt to take less damage.
---
That was like, my first time getting my feet on the ground in WoW.
---
I never opened them. And don’t plan to.
---
Because of collecting value I think.
---
I didn't discover that I had talents/talent points until 20+, when my step-brother informed me of them.
---
Was between 20-30, though don't remember the exact level. Pretty sure I was in Duskwood at the time. Not my finest moment; I was a stupid kid. :3
---
Vanilla still sealed is very rare and is worth way too much.
---
I can guarantee you won't get that trinket. It is priest only.
---
Isn’t the Priest’s fear a horror effect? So WotF cannot break it?
---
Have you seen the price a sealed vanilla CE goes for? Honestly it's a hell of an investment. 
---
Ahh the most forgettable zone, Ashzara. 
---
You can host your own private server for free, good for testing stuff without any interference, also gives you GM commands if you wanna mess around with them / utilize them  
---
Pm me if you need a link for download, its free and easy to set up
---
Wondering “why is that ally just standing there looking at me” two seconds before the blasted lands dragon ate me for breakfast
---
Are world dragons a thing? How do they work / how is the loot?
---
I'm against sharding, although it seems like it may be a good idea the first month or so since the servers will be overwhelmed and it will be hard to quest. Great point!
---
Wow interesting! Did you play Vanilla back in the day?
---
No, Priest fear isn't horror. One of the Warlock fears is though - can't remember which one. 
---
What's the deal with those?  It seems like everyone plays them, even reputable content creators and such, but it also seems to be kind of sketchy. 
---
What will be the worth in Euro’s?
---
I agree, I really hope they make Classic as close to Vanilla as possible.
---
Agreed! Even cosmetics would ruin it for me.
---
Maybe I like to play feral as Druid?
---
But you know u have to
---
I'm the same way.  Old eq player. I use the number bar for my main stuffs and click anything else. 
---
Seeing all this talk about 40 keybinds blows my mind. Does this come from contemporary retail?
---
You don't do it by changing the game, you do it by playing your best and changing the player mindset instead.
---
yeah, so what? 
---
Brill girls are only skin and bones! 
---
The cheapest vanilla sealed ive seen so far is about 3k usd
---
The 3:00 mark in the video is the greatest bait I've seen in WoW history.
---
As a vegan classic fan former vanilla player.  I feel attacked. 
---
Not sketchy at all.
---
A friend convinced me to try.
---
It is a classic server that uses an old WoW client.
---
Instead of hooking up to battlenet, it goes to another seever.
---
Game works great.
---
I cannot post the name of the server i use or this will be deleted.
---
However, there are about 200 people on when i play in the middle of the night (baby duty)
---
Hell no, it was the most unsatisfying PVP I've ever tried. I tried it again when they froze xp and made twink-only BGs but the queues were almost as boring as fighting non-twinks. I just don't get the attraction of facerolling weaker players.
---
Then by all means play a feral druid. You atleast know the level 60 situation. You may or might not be able to raid. There is plenty to the game besides raiding 
---
I've always seen it more of a strength that playing within your region makes a stronger bond as it is another level you connect with other players on. (also less lag obv) 
---
Because they get kicked from the group for having growl active. 
---
Think about how much energy people have to do vanilla because it means a clean slate.  
---
Imagine a rule set server that does this periodically after much of the end game had been explored.  
---
I think this is the best way forward. I tried introducing a friend recently but basically did everything wrong. Told him what to do, where to go etc etc and we got to lvl 11 and I don't think he's that into it... Keeps saying that he doesn't understand what all the hype is about. 
---
It's gonna take a bit of time to recover the situation, but I  think going in with the same attitude as yours will hopefully do the trick
---
I would suggest you to go Holy Shock and put the rest of the points in protection tree. The only talent you really need as a 5man tank is Improved Righteous Fury and you can easily get away with the rest.
---
You are really going to miss Holy Power, Holy Shock (you can use it as a taunt kind of thing as tank) and Divine Favor when you're healing. Holy Shield is a nice spell, but compared to the stuff you get in the end of the holy tree it kind of fades away.
---
Cannot get rank 14 prior to 60.
---
Dungeon sets VS Pre-raid BiS, help me understand which one is better and why. I mean, I am perfeclty aware what BiS means, I'm just wondering how it's better than the dungeon sets, specifically mage.
---
Would you trade all these for a sealed vanilla?
---
Explicitly using world buffs was a pain in the ass since the dragon head turns ins had a several-hours cooldown unlike on private servers. It wasn't until AQ and like you say Nax that it became worth the effort to hold onto your head to try and time it with your read.
---
Lol.  Clearing naxx has very little to do with 'being good enough'.  But I generally do agree that people who invest the time into it should be rewarded for that time investment.  If the pvpers want similar gear, they know how to get it.
---
I haven't been part of this subreddit for long but I don't see any reason to auto-remove those types of posts? 
---
That sounds like pre TOC wotlk.  That was a good time for raiding.
---
This proposed rule didn't exist before, so in the spirit of this community my response would be #nochange
---
Agreed
---
There should be good populations for PVP and PVE, I am thinking. I have always played on PVE servers. I wouldnt mind doing a PVP server, but since I will have somewhat limited time, getting ganked might really cut into my progress.
---
Alliance here! :)
---
Honestly nothing, I tried the new game Apex with friends but didn't really enjoy it. I'm pretty much just sitting on my ass watching youtube videos/Twitch streams, reads different forums and obviously here on reddit... I'm only 3 months in on my "vacation" and I'm bored to death because there's no games that I enjoy
---
Cool. If I get super impatient maybe I'll give it a shot. I do want to try and keep classic fresh though. 
---
There's something really satisfying about the male human 1h sword auto attacks... I dunno what it is but I never get bored of watching them lol 
---
I mean youll want healing focus and divine fury anyway, even though flash heal will be your go to heal for the most part. 
---
Regarding blessed recovery my guess is that the strongest heal will be prioritized, as thats the case regarding other hots like renew and rejuvenation.
---
Private server players are going to be a drop in the bucket compared to the new players, old players, and live players checking the game out. That elitism will still exist on the fringe of high-end content like it always did, but it will be diluted server wide thanks to new blood.
---
Getting an early level owl for your hunter
---
Same here. I actually like to do battlegrounds and stuff, but the ganking does not appeal to me. I am East Coast, so we are only a few hours difference. :) Are your Horde or Alliance?
---
Indeed I thought about this but it would be awesome to have when doing stuff like BRD AoE pulls when solo grinding, the damage reduction is big
---
You're going to have a big wake up call when you realize servers like chronos aren't true vanilla.
---
Take a look at the comment I linked in the OP. There are about 10 different threads discussing this topic over the last period pointed out by that user. It's getting stale, but from the reactions I'm getting here I see I might be the only one who feels about it that way.
---
Shave my body hair, wear revealing clothes and keep myself slim I guess?
---
Dungeons were glitchy and had serious pathing issues for the longest time. People weren't running Strath and Scholo 10 man because they wanted to, you pretty much had to because it was guaranteed you were going to get multiple bad pulls due to glitchy pathing that would wipe a smaller group. Pet pathing was doubly glitchy, and having a pet out in a dungeon was asking for a wipe. Eventually this was fixed but the culture of "put your pet away!!1!" remained.
---
19 is where it is at
---
Do not hate me:( but what is bis
---
&gt; Downsides are you'll get annihilated by murlocs early game
---
LOL it's so true. Leveling a rogue meant you could barely fight 1 murloc. 2 = certain death, pulling one after another = certain death.
---
I assume it was the same struggle for you warriors too.
---
Are rogues as dominant in PVP as everyone makes them seem? I want to play a Spriest for PVP but It seems like I stand no chance against rogues and wouldn't enjoy it.
---
Get rid of them! Who cares what comes after. Let’s play this game before worrying about after. They can make their own subreddit for it. This is classic discussion not tell me your opinion on what fits your expectations for post classic discussion. 
---
astrology in a nutshell
---
Neither did this subreddit.
---
Human female casting animation by far.
---
Any would, but that's because a sealed Vanilla CE is many thousands of dollars and the other CEs all cost a fraction of that. 
---
That’s interesting that they stuck to the same design throughout the years. Very satisfying to look at
---
Best in slot.
---
It's a term used to refer to the best piece of gear you can get for a specific gear slot for a specific build. 
---
We had this one too.  "The loot table RNG is based on the raid leader's character ID"
---
That's a truly beautiful trifecta of decisions.
---
I remember doing this back in the day. It's a pretty sure-fire method to handle a mob. Hopefully it will be used more in Classic, if pathing is way less buggy.
---
Gnome death animation - beats everything by a mile 🤓😂🤣
---
Nice!! Ive got the same sealed collection going on. Only ones I dont have are Wrath and Legion, and obviously Vanilla lol. I cherish my BC, its like another child. Im hoping that one day 30 years from now some very rich old fans will drive the value of these up on ebay lol.
---
Selling all the herbs I collected to vendors in order to buy white armor and weps from them.
---
Lets hope so!
---
Exactly, I feel you brother!
---
The dungeon sets are just a combination of baaestats. Stam/intellect/spirit/strength/agi while pre raid BIS has secondary stats like hit and crit which you will need and want. The preraid isn't terrible it just isn't usually as good as other pieces that can be acquired 
---
People do specify what part of DM they're doing. At least now, anyways. Why would somebody want to join a group, where the group *leader* can't even specify what dungeon theyre doing with a single keystroke.
---
I've just switched to saying "deadmines" because abbreviating a dungeon after it's last boss is kinda weird when it's the only case of that. 
---
Honestly, trying to stack up self-healing procs isn't all that helpful in the long run.  In terms of aggro, if that's what you're looking for, the lawbringer 8-piece bonus is good (due to amount and that it's a party heal), but you've got much better ways of healing than things like the life-steal enchant and the darkmoon card.  More damage dealt by you means killing things faster (and generate more threat) is much better than small amounts of healing trickling in to you
---
Crest of Retribution into a force-reactive disk will both damage mobs faster and put out more threat than the Skullflame shield (and I think over time even a Drillborer if you can get one may be more threat).  Until you get the full Lawbringer set (for the party heal), the Soulforge armor is both easier to get (at least the first few pieces, depending on when the quests are added in) and much more effective due to the spell damage on it (compared to Lawbringer's +heal).  And Spell damage would be a better enchant on the Hand than life-steal.  And finally, if you don't need the instant heal procs that much to stay alive (because Paladin heals have artificially reduced threat), I'd say a Sageblade or Azuresong is probably a better choice than the Hand long-term - again, boosted seal, judgement, consecration, holy shield and (slightly) ret aura damage will do much more for you than a little extra healing.
---
Yes I would
---
If we pass April without getting any updates at all, that's when I will start getting annoyed again. Just like we all got annoyed last year when we went like 8 months without a single post about the progression and the outcry from us made them do one of those dev watercooler posts.
---
I have heard from several people on different forums ALONG with one of my friends that will play on launch that they need to take time off work this summer to play, but they can't do it without a date, obviously. So.. I hope Blizzard realizes this and doesn't wait until the last month to announce it simply because classic is not a "frontrunner" game. It doesn't make sense that they would, but still.. if they pass April without providing us with anything new then that's weird as hell.
---
Did you expect them to deliver it a few months after announcing it?
---
Are you reffering to the World Bosses? I can tell you about them, there are six in vanilla, and they are:
---
Azuregos, a blue dragon in Azshara.
---
Doom Lord Kazzak, big ass demon in the Blasted lands.
---
And the four nightmare dragons: Emeriss, Ysondre, Lethon and Taerar. They all spawn in front of their own portal.
---
They all have a respawn time from around 2-4 days, it varies. And they all have very good loot, that are excellent for raiding, especially the Nightmare dragons as they could drop some Nature resist gear for AQ. They all require a 40 man group to down, ish.
---
Even in pugs for ZG on pservers nobody uses consumes, because its a waste of gold and/or time for the easier dungeons. 
---
Maybe a FAP for spiderboss and a LIP for Hakkar if you overaggro, because you were not watching your aggro as horde warrior.
---
Isn't the instance Maraudon in Desolace? Out by the Valley of Spears? I belive it was a 36-46 level range too. Otherwise GREAT maps! I saved both and im going to crudly paste them together on paint!
---
I would suggest heavy tps build - switch gear for fights that require special itemization but remember your biggest friend is high healthpool and armor, high defense is only needed on certain fights
---
Meh, I wouldn't really care if they were removed either way but it's not hard to just scroll past them. 
---
Yes please. It's a dead horse being revived and beaten with a stick all over again.
---
End the animal brutality. 
---
I'm gonna try to get my GF into Classic after it drops. Still thinking the WASD movement and camera will be the biggest hurdle to a console gamer.
---
Making it to 60 is a huge time commitment so we want to make sure people have an honest view of what their gaming life will be at 60. Part of this being an MMO is that in order to experience all of the game, you will need to work with others. So the choices you make and the mechanics of the game will have an impact on that. 
---
So you like playing feral and want to be a raid MT? You have to convince 39 other people this is a good idea in opposition to the mechanics of the game. Good luck with that.
---
Back in reality, feral can find a spot as a 1-of in most any guild who can OT, does better dps when not tanking than a 3rd tank-spec war, has a nice support buff, innervate, brez, and can help with decursing on some fights. So long as you go into the game with that mindset and not frustration that 39 other people aren't will to try and push content with a sub-par MT with poor gear support in order for you to play how you want, you'll be fine.
---
Isn't it best to use WASD and the mouse in tandem? 
---
I don’t understand this 
---
Yeah, the question was Pre-raid BiS in comparison to the Dungeons sets, but the dungeons sets also have secondary stats, their set bonuses, so are the set bonuses inferior to the secondary stats that the Pre-raid BiS have? And also, if I were to start raiding in full D1 set, would that be wildly accepted or frowned upon?
---
Sodaaaa
---
I should of mentioned that I'll be most likely healing dungeons until I get the T1 set so I don't mind that.. sadly i can't get the engin shield as I have blacksmithing and found a great (secret) money making tactic with it so I wouldn't change that at the moment so Skullflame seems to be the only option.. hand of ed would be for aoe solo tanking and pvp but if I can tank 5 man without problems in full t1\`using it then that would be awesome till I get something better like you suggested (I like this build because there are loads of benefits with BiS wep/shield being BoE and also the chest).. it defo sounds fun and would be a great way to start my first 60  
---
That being said any more suggestions like rings and stuff? cheers
---
Nah, I understand the impatience, but them releasing anything less than the full information on everything about the game will not satisfy the toxic fringe of the vanilla community, and will only spur more conversations which will go something like "Why aren't they clarifying X? That means we should assume the worst!"
---
When they are getting close to release (or when they start up a beta) is when they should start conversing with everyone.
---
I was between 7 and 8 when my family picked up Classic. I only got to around 55 before BC dropped and i started somewhere in mid-late '05. 
---
Also, it's hard to just say that mmo's arent in right now, when they're all just shitty. 
---
Damn, so you're saying you still haven't experienced even BC/Wrath in their day? Classic is great, but you should stick around for the expansions too, the first 3 versions of WoW are the most fun game experiences i've had.
---
Ok look, if yo uplan on being hardcore, and you decide to play a balance druid and get invited to other hardcore players' raids or top guilds, you're actually stupid. However, if you plan on just playing the game and raiding with your random guild, then fuck yeah bud more power to you.
---
Don't expect to roll a balance druid and then get invited to a hardcore group. Do expect to get invited to other less demanding guilds, though.
---
And also, if you want to play Feral, some of the best loot is outside raids, where FERALS ARE LEGIT NEEDED. The pvp gear is simply insane as a feral druid, like bis till AQ/Naxx. 
---
So there is people that want to discuss post naxx content and what feels like a majority of people that dont want to discuss it, I think the biggest problem is that there is too many of them and many dont even add anything to the discussion. 
---
Put it into a weekly or a monthly discussion and remove any and all individual post naxx posts, while i sympathize with those that are tired of the posts I hardly see it being in good manners to ban all discussion about post naxx content. 
---
Feralas
---
I'm a little worried about how late the beta may be. IDK if 3 months is solid given the company's track record in recent years.
---
Classy Babes
---
Oh I see, thanks
---
Theres so many posts about every topic... because theres not much to talk about. If we obeyed every compulsion people had to silence 1.14 post, silence loot trading posts, silence low effort posts, we would have almost nothing left on this server.
---
You wont miss Holy Shock, its on too much of a cooldown in classic and doesnt heal for much. You're far more likely to miss BoSanc.
---
Divine Favor and possibly Holy Power though maybe.
---
I'd recommend the 30/21/0 HolyProt build that gets BoSanc so a paladin in the raid has it, and has enough holy points to heal as well as a pure holydin.
---
I would try to keep it that way. I'm playing private atm, because I want to... but, considering it's so close around the corner, relatively speaking, I would absolutely wait, to keep every memory fresh with the Classic launch.
---
Unless theres sharding in the 1-20 zones... in which case, i'm glad I experienced it authentically on the private servers.
---
I picked one up last year for $2300, prior to that I hadn’t seen any below $2500. 
---
aw u miss the only relevant one imo. still nice collection
---
Do a lot of faction wars break out during / before these fights on PVP servers?
---
Vanilla Babies.
---
Human Female using a Staff or Polearm in melee combat.
---
Otherwise known as "I'm trying to kill a spider on the wall over there at max range".
---
This is a good idea.
---
Honestly anyone that played and enjoyed retail at any point in time should at least try out classic. It's still sort of the same kind of game, but has a really unique feel. You will love it
---
5 grand! Holy smokes man. Great on you for not opening it. 
---
Summer 2019.
---
I reckon it'll be sometime at the end of July as a guess.
---
I legitimately thought the same thing until I looked it up. Kinda blew my mind a little bit that the models didn’t change until early 2006.
---
I really wish I had pre-ordered more than one of those back in 2004.  But nobody expects video games to ever really be an investment.
---
Thanks for posting the inverted b! Now I can do my favourite emote with the cans on.
---
d-_-b
---
I still have the "wait for sunders" habit. I see people in BFA just rush into pulls and DPS like its no big deal.
---
The reason why humans are favored for ret pve is due to the weaponskill allowing your gear set to be less oriented around hit chance, and the reduction on glancing blows helps a lot too. This way you would be able to orient more spell dmg gear into your BiS set rather than poorly scaling strength items. Not to mention, the small crit increase from sword/mace skills actually matters if you want to min/max as a ret paladin.
---
I will miss playing with the odd person from across the world, for a little bit of variety. But, i will not miss having half the population behind a language barrier.
---
It's one thing on the big modern private servers, where you have 6-10k concurrently. In that instance, you can only play with half (being split between horde and alliance), and then half of that again (being split between different languages). There's still a 6-10k pop that can mine the world's nodes, herbs, kill quest mobs... and there's no language barrier for ganking.
---
So one thing I'm looking forward to in Classic, is less region-scattered servers. I don't mind a % of people to be behind a language barrier, but as it stands on private servers, theres a whole world of people that will gank me and jack my mithril, but only half of it I can really communicate or dungeon with.
---
I know thats the reason but the amount of Good swords/maces compared to axes are ridiculously low and Most guides show you axes as prerqaid bis and so on and at that time, racial does Jack shit:p
---
Reading is pretty important my dude. The F in RTFM stands for "full", not "fucking".
---
I remember him farming up to it as 59 and that he hit 60 when he got it so he could use the weapons. He must have just hit 60 and finished the grind or hit 60 when he knew he had enough honour. This was a hella long time ago haha
---
I said this in another thread, but the reason those PS players are generally cancerous and on edge is because they are paying nothing and there is no permanence to their character. They get their jollies however they can because their character could be snatched out from under them at any second.
---
There was a fair bit of elitism in Vanilla, not because the game sponsored it, but because it is simply human nature. Guilds attempting Naxx and AQ40 sometimes had players looking down on certain players in MC and ZG. That being said, Those MC/ZG players still looked down on players with lesser gear than them.
---
All in all though, because getting gear back in the day was so hard, people really had a spirit of camaraderie. Everyone is paying money to die and work their ass off and do the best they can, so lets all work together to make it as painless as possible.
---
There is no doubt in my mind that the attitude on retail classic will be 100 times better, even amongst former PS players, than it is currently on any PS.
---
Anyone know the chat addon, specifically the font replacement? It's exactly what I used in vanilla and I'd love to try it again
---
Nobody can force you to do what you don't want to do. If you're fully committed to Ret or Balance, you can do that. In a way, strongly identifing with your spec will help differentiate you from the larger population who is just using the spec to level. 
---
However the flip side is, you can't force any guild to bring along a sub-par spec. And make no mistake, Ret and Balance are absolutely sub-par specs. The easiest way to get into a guild as one of these specs is to join early during leveling, ideally as an officer. Baring that, you'll likely need to get to know several members of a guild before you can get an invite, since nobody (for good reason) is going out and recruiting ret pallies.
---
And even once in the guild, you'll be working against the current as players will naturally be skeptical of you. You need to bring your A game at all times, play to your strengths by offering your utility whenever possible. JoW, clensing, auras, know how to really work your toolkit. I was in a guild where a ret pally officer basically destroyed our ability to recruit. He never ran any aura but sanc, refused to cleanse, only judged Crusader, wouldn't even help the healing team with rezzing. Good players would join, see this asshat, see him not getting told off by leadership, and move on to better guilds.
---
So what's the take-home? You sound like raiding in vanilla is a high priority to you, and you sound like you really want to dps in a raid. If that's the situation, I think you should seriously consider rolling a pure dps class: mage/lock/hunter/rogue/fury war. Otherwise you're putting your long term goals at risk. Personally, I've rolled and committed to hybrid specs, but I always did it with the mentality that if that character never ended up raiding, I'd be okay with that.
---
If anyone in the EU has an UNSEALED Burning Crusade and/or Vanilla collectors edition (codes can be used, just good box condition), please DM me - very interested in buying!
---
BC and Lich king are pretty awesome too
---
I know, it’s like $3k
---
Why babies? Why not warriors or kings or legends? 
---
Would that be the guilds name? I could get down with that.
---
The thing is... it's not "people" that are the problem "not letting you" raid as a non-viable spec.
---
The problem is that in Classic a lot of the hybrid specs were just BAD in Raiding situations for a number of reasons which you can't refute.
---
You could easily convince a nice raidgroup to let you Prot Paladin Tank a few bosses in a raid, but it would be MUCH harder and worse than a Warrior doing it due to the mechanics of the class. It's not about being oppressed, its because the game just was like that.
---
As a feral tbh you can likely get raid spots with the right group. Bear tanking was really good by 1.12 in Vanilla if you put effort in to gear properly and it was only really the damage intake that sucked compared to warriors (but by Naxx a lot of warriors were tanking in half-fury spec without a shield and woudl be MORE squishy than a bear tank so that's fine). 
---
A focussed bear tank who went kitty on other content would be viable to play although you may have a lot of competition as most raidgroups wont take more than one feral. You MAY have to heal on some fights depending.
---
As for paladins, don't expect to Protection Tank anything in a raid simply because the class sucked at boss tanking. Low single target threat and absurdly mana hungry, it was great for 5 mans, good for raid trash, and absymal at bosses. 
---
But all the above is just for raiding. Ret paladins were REALLY good in 5mans due to their utility. Prot paladins were great AOE 5man tanks. Bear tanks were arguably better 5man tanks than Warriors as they held aoe threat easier and did more personal damage, and feral kitties were "acceptable" as a dps as they had nice backup healy/tanky options. Same in PvP.
---
It's really only raiding where the hybrids fail and for good mathematical reasons. You have to understand that and accept that finding a raidgroup to let you TRY your preferred style is going to be difficult and the more you try to force a hybrid into a key role hte more you may be holding that raid group back on success.
---
But I never died.  Can I use lvl 60s that I never used past classic? 
---
BIG EXECUTEEE
---
But I never died. Can I use lvl 60s that I never used past classic? I am not Hindu.  
---
This is good. I am bitter they ruined WoW and consider myself a vet. 
---
Yeah, I hope so aswell, I hope people will be patient with me.
---
I like this for the simplicity.  
---
I come to this community to go through the comments and read all the awesome stories that people had in Vanilla. The indepth class discussion in the stickied threads are also interesting. That's quality content for me. Removing the repetitive posts would create more room for that I believe.
---
Why old dogs?  The dogs I had during beta are all dead now. 
---
deathcoil
---
It has been answered, and the two game versions will be kept completely separate. Nothing will affect the other.
---
So to be true to the time period...  Guild named Will it run Crisis? Although it probable that I am in midlife this is not a Corvette.  or is it?
---
That bonus made it the top spec for that class, for T5. Not just visible. 
---
Thank wow jesus
---
Ah I see,thank you!
---
🤔 that means I can’t use an English client with chinese servers? 300 ping sounds massive and far away from a nice gaming experience. I am using Nord VPN (obfuscated servers) at the moment but it is not very reliable and playing wow should be impossible. 
---
I like this because it is simple. 
---
Yes! That’s what it would be :P
---
dunno. i feel like the the only real CE is the one when the actual game was released. but thats just me
---
I was thinking because the starting zone and dungeons would not hold the intrigue for us.  I can lead you through Gnomeregan but I won't we amazed by it. 
---
Human female casting, especially healing spells.. my fav! Can’t wait
---
Need a fancy name for it
---
Yeah the hunter 4set is really sick.
---
But that's still very contrasting to how everyone uses to wear the sets.
---
BC sucks &amp; where is classic? Don’t tell me you started at BC!
---
yea, imagine trying to hunt down gankers
---
only they vanish into a different shard as soon as they change zones, never to be seen again.
---
I feel like the people that think it was called "DM" are mostly either Euros, or people who wipe their ass standing up. It was VC on one of the most OG servers out there, from day 1. Never was VC referred to as DM. People started calling it "DM" when private servers became a thing.
---
Holy shit this sub is getting desperate for news.
---
A 22 minute video of level 1's attacking things.
---
Send classic news soon please, I can't take much more of these posts.
---
Bye felicia
---
Yes i strongly agree with you bud. This is one of the many reasons these private servers are such garbage. Private servers are full of try hard no life losers. With classic coming out all these nerds will be spread thin where you only see very few try hards per server depending on the server and the rest will be normal people just playing and enjoying the game
---
Its their perogative though, isnt it?
---
The solo "pain" of warrior leveling is hugely oversold. Keep your gear (particularly weapons) up to date, range pull if you think it's not safe, run away quickly if it looks like a pull is gonna go bad, and stick with quests your level or lower. If you do that solo leveling on a warrior is a breeze. And since you can instantly have a group for any instance and 90% of instance gear is for you, keeping your gear up to date isn't too hard either.
---
However, where you really feel the pain is world pvp. Mages can kite the shit out of you, rogues can run circles, healers can outlast you, and you're missing crucial skills till your mid-30s while being more dependent on your lvl 40 talents than any other class. At this point I almost always level up warriors with alchemy. Swiftness pots, FAPs (yeah I use them in wpvp, no regrets) can turn a fight in your favor. I've run from ganks with swim speed potions, evaded enemies with lesser invisible pots. The lower level elemental protection potions are a huge buff that casters aren't suspecting. Or you can just accept that leveling solo on a pvp server is gonna suck and play nights for the least chance to run into the opposing faction. In group wpvp you're a wrecking ball even at lower levels.
---
Why?
---
It's a hybrid spec that allows you to heal and 1v1 efficiently. Shadowform is only good for dueling but bad in real pvp (bgs, group pvp, world pvp against skilled opponents they can just run away from you since you don't have any slows) check this guy out hes a good priest that uses that spec: [twitch.tv/yolamz/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/yolamz/videos)  
---
Omg this lmao
---
What year is it? And where are my pants?
---
I'm 17 and started playing WoW during TBC. I would just make trial accounts over and over and would try to level a Nelf each time. Started seriously getting into WoW during MoP. I'm very excited for classic to come out!
---
But why?
---
I never played the crack but am aware of it. 
---
Does this game round decimals in a sum? I know that decimals count in equations, but it's somewhat unclear to me if rounding occur in regards to final gain. For example, Blessing of Wisdom rank 6 is 33 mana per 5 and talented is 39.6. Combat log show 39, some addons (incorrectly?) show 40.
---
Is there even a cutoff? Are sum decimals simply discarded (meaning zero)?
---
Empty backpack in vanilla? Pffft. 
---
Or maybe they’re downvoting you because your comment adds nothing to the conversation. Which is literally the reason Reddit has a downvote button.
---
I did start at classic but didnt get to have a CE
---
??
---
&gt;i'd like to roll a warrior because i enjoy using 2 handed weapons and im not really interested in playing a ret paladin. 
---
if you intend to play 2h in pve the only real option is using a 2h statstick as hunter, everything that can dual wield uses 1h's, and if it can't it's probably not dpsing, see shaman/paladin.
---
Yikes I think you really nailed it with the observation that lack of character permance drives much of the attitude problem on private servers. Much of the elitism is driven by a desire to move as fast as possible. You can see where a group of people who've stuck it out through server admin drama, legal drama, and Chinese DDoS attacks might be in a place where they just don't have time for noobs anymore.
---
y?
---
I'll give $15 for the lot
---
Classy for classic and babes for me and other OG wow girlies. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
The dungeon set is inferior in every way. [https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=181/magisters-regalia#see-also](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=181/magisters-regalia#see-also). 
---
The Mage set only offers base stats i.e. Intellect, Stamina and Spirit (Intellect does not increase spell damage in Classic). At the same time, the set offers no spell damage, 0 spell hit %, and 0 spell crit %. The set offers one useful set bonuses, which is 23 spell damage for acquiring 4 pieces.
---
I wouldn't say wearing some pieces of the set is frowned upon, but any half descent raid group would expect you to at least try and replace the set with gear from dungeons that actually improves your damage eventually. Spell hit % is your best stat until hit capped and it can be hard to come by early in progression, which makes it very hard to justify wearing the dungeon set over the pieces listed for Stage 1 pre-raid BiS in this document: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ\_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS\_P3OaKUY/edit?rm=minimal#gid=1992086259](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/edit?rm=minimal#gid=1992086259)

Last night I actually really thought about mages. So much convenience. :)

I love druids, but afraid of how they play on vanilla, I've heard bad things. Could just have been lies though. 
---
Tier 2 before remodeling, check it on google yourself. I know it’s not full bloodfang 🙂

Why would you correlate downvotes with anger?
---
The button is there to allow people to down rank comments that don’t anything to the discussion. Comments like yours, e.g. a weird trolling kind of a thing, are why they have that button.
---
Odd that you’d wallow in that, and take it as a badge of honor. Especially with the notion that you’ve made people mad. Which isn’t whats happening. 
---
People are seeing your made up troll post and downvoting you because it’s a made up troll post that adds nothing at all to the discussion.  
---
Hope that clears things up for you sunshine.

Could be prat, it was a thing in vanilla as well. Or chatmod.

As a warrior leveling I struggled to single pull the murlocs and kill them to reach the quest objective before the murlocs started respawning. Its a rough life.
---
I completely understand. It just hard for me because I enjoy playing kitty for instance and don’t mind healing it’s just I don’t wanna be forced to. I appreciate you filling me in and easing my worries. 
---
I been playing on private servers and have a 44 Druid but don’t wanna finish because with blizzard servers coming soon a lot of people will jump ship over there. I don’t have a bunch of free time because of school and work and wife so I won’t be a hardcore I still wanna actually experience the raids I never got to do. If I have to play holy priest or resto Druid to I will. 
---
Would it be old dirty bastards or odp?
---
if you have never played a classic warrior, you may want to level a pure DPS class a little first to see if you can get some green drops to feed your warrior with
---
makes the process WAAAY easier
---
simple green weapon upgrades early and often will literally takes days off your leveling time... compared to hours for other classes
---
Activision screwed over the whole Diablo fanbase. They screwed over Heroes of Storm fanbase. They are being investigated for fraud and where there is smoke there is usually fire. They created WoW retail, which means: they created an MMO where you pay full retail price, pay monthly fee and with micro transactions.
---
Don't get me started on their plans for mobile games for every IP they own.
---
And you expect ME to finance an abomination, just because you want to play WoW forever? That's not what I want them to use my money for. They should provide us with stable Classic Servers, decent Service and regular bug fixes, server maintenance etc. Including a very close to realistic WoW Classic experience. Which is  BTW why we are in the sub.
---
IF but only IF, they do a decent job. MAYBE we can talk about it. But right now Activision is treating on VERY VERY thin ice here. I'm done with Activision, EA and Bethesda screwing us gamers over, again and again.
---
How about we WAIT and let them do a good job? There is 2 Years of content FFS.
---
The shoulders and headpiece? Jesus Christ that’s terrible looking
---
Do you have to be female?
---
Lmfao, the struggle. I remember being at like 80% hp, and trying to pull a murloc and either dying, or running away and then dying.
---
Nope. Waited long enough and have played plenty on private servers by now
---
People have always a tendency to parrot things they hear but dont really know much about it ^^ 
---
Hell no- everyone is welcome, but I’d never make a guild and don’t expect anyone to use that name 😂 just popped into my head and had to share
---
Just messing with you :) nice collection! 
---
r/4PanelCringe
---
So true 
---
I have a whole guild of folks that I am hoping come back for Classic. However, your post and the comments after it have made me think that I need to get my wife to play with me! She likes games (we play the hell out of the Far Cry series, as well as old school games), and Classic would be the perfect time to get her in since I quit playing retail. This will give me the Classic time I want and the "together" time that I hear about literally every second of every day...even when we are together. 
---
It's not. Look at the prices they actually sell for versus what they're listed for. Nobody is paying more than a few hundred bucks for one. Listed price doesn't equate to actual value.
---
You can play with an english client on chinese servers, but on vanilla that would be irrelavant since everyone else would be speaking chinese and you’d effectively be playing single player classic wow, which isnt very fun. 300 ping isn’t as massive as it sounds since stuff is straight up just slower in vanilla wow overall (well, maybe not if you’d like to pvp as a frost mage, but almost everything else works). Also nord is trash, at least get expressvpn if you arent willing to use a shadowsocks service.
---
Retail WoW at 300 ping is indeed basically impossible I’ll admit, but if you really wanna play that just play with the english client on chinese servers, nobody talks on retail anymore anyways.
---
The problem is that they don’t want to really discuss it.
---
A majority of those OPs are essentially statements. Not discussions. They’re not being posted to discuss, or convince. They exist to circle jerk. 
---
As is, man, like, anyone that’s been on this subreddit for more than a few months has seen enough of those threads for a lifetime. 
---
A perm stickied thread with links to old discussions about that subject would likely better serve this community than allowing those already done to death discussions to continue. 
---
Especially when a lot of those threads are inspired by old data, or tinfoil hat Youtubers that, despite spending weeks data mining, haven’t made the effort to actually read John Staats book or the recent Vanilla dev AMAs 
---
Human has better posture
---
But you said you never reach 60 in Vanilla. Feral druids have a super weird rotation and need a lot of expensive consumables and need to farm maces from Gnomeregan 24/7 and will still do way less damage than rogues and warriors...
---
That is not true, there are tons of interesting posts created EVERY DAY. 
---
&gt; authentically on the private servers.

---
&gt; authentically 
---
&gt; on the private servers.
---
....uh, keep telling yourself that?
---
Xp values are wrong unless.
---
Dynamic respawns likely exist. 
---
Values for things are all a guess.
---
Super authentic. 
---
I know this sever. I know they give you BiS gear to start. Is this spec viable with lower gear?
---
Yeah didn’t think about getting ganked, if we only have two hours to level on a certain work night I’d hate to get briefed that entire time... hm
---
Are you dead set on alliance 
---
I think the slow pace of Classic WoW is so very beginner friendly, especially for people who have never touched a video game.
---
Maybe there is a whole new player base is the making.
---
If there was ever a game to start playing video-games with, it's Tetris or Classic WoW.
---
Those do look sweet thought, I'd love to have the art books inside.
---
Very surprised so many people are happy with not having more information.
---
Yes I understand they need to work on the game, I'm fine with not being updated on that, because I expect a release in summer as they stated.
---
But there are plenty of worrying issues, such as loot trading and progressive itemisation.
---
Your raid tank will miss it way more than you will, since you're going to run with Wisdom in 5mans anyways, unless your party does not mind drinking after every pack.
---
30 seconds is not a huge deal and it's the only spell in game which can heal your target right here and right now besides LoH. It does not heal for some insane numbers but with proper gear it can even do decent damage (1300 crits). Moreover, this is the tool you're going to use for pulling packs or getting a loose mob from the healer. 
---
Waiting on a decision *is* a good idea. You should try that sometime because from here it looks like you already made your decision.
---
With all the elitists from private servers coming around for classic, will i ever get invited to raids as a feral dps? Or will they force me to OT or heal because "druids don't do dps"
---
Imo this whole subreddit has become a massive circle jerk with the majority of posts being about new content, wow tokens, sharding and meme specs viability. So for that matter I wouldn't mind auto removing "content after naxx" posts and would appreciate if we extended it to also remove discussion posts about sharding, wow tokens and meme specs as well. 
---
That’s kind of the point with something like a *collector’s* edition 
---
People say the same about the 2007 iPhone which goes sealed for over $20k. 
---
???
---
you can google "xxx (currency) in ( other place's currency)"
---
That’s awesome. I think you should save up for the Vanilla one. It will only go up in value so no money lost. 
---
I don’t think hybrid  good. I’d go full shadow. It’s extremely strong in pvp. 
---

&gt;Classes: Priest
---
More authentic than Classic will be. This I can guarantee you. 
---
IIRC the rounding rolls over to the next tick. So you'd see something like 39, 40 then 39 mana gained
---
How can you guarantee that and what are we using to determine “more authentic.”
---
As I’ve already mentioned XP values are wrong on Mangos. We know drop rates are a guess. We know damage from boss abilities is a highly educated guess, but a guess nonetheless. We know Onys deep breath mechanic is wrong. We know triggers for many boss abilities are a guess.
---
Your guarantee means nothing. Unless you can answer that.  
---
This was me. &lt;3 Classic
---
It's just hell, for 2 reason
---
\-You'll never be full hp and drop low anytime something doesn't go according to plan
---
\-As long as you can't stance dance(depending on your build) you have no way or retaliate anyway.
---
So yeah, a solo leveling warrior is very easy free honor for anyone passing by with full hp, not only mages.
---
Maaaaaaaaaaaaann, fake sick days were the absolute best thing in the word (expect for tuesdays of course).  I'd stay in bed til my mom went to work and then instantly hop on WoW.
---
But OP doesn’t have a sealed vanilla CE...?
---
This was great thanks for making it
---
Staysafe this vid is your best yet. Thank you. 
---
I guess you’re right, I’m mostly surprised with how good the older ones look compared to the newer ones, they’re beautiful
---
Things you will never see on a 3k cap server. 
---
I very much prefer "alternative gearing options". Catch-up mechanics are defined by being less work for equal reward. I'd like it more if it was equal but different work for equal reward. You want a nice armor set but don't want to raid? It'll cost you a lot of gold and a variety of mats, you'll have to do a long questline, and you'll have to face off against a variety of new and difficult bosses. That's not easy. It's only different. *That's* what I want to see more of.
---
There may be numerical differences between Original Vanilla and best-guess Private Server replications. They aren’t very noticeable and don’t make much of a difference, so Classics gameplay and leveling will very much *feel* like private servers.
---
Something like sharding is inmediately an unauthentic Vanilla experience, even if the quest xp is exactly right. I’m still not telling people to play private servers when Classic is out, but if anything past Elwynn or Durotar has sharding in it at launch, that’s already ~15 hours played in a game that’s *nothing* like Vanilla. It’s not even the *biggest* deal if it’s in the 1-5 minizones or 1–10 zones, but anything past that is a decent chunk of leveling in a ghost-world, which is already a more catastrophic change than slightly wrong quest or armor values.
---
I respect your choice, but if you ask about the best spec to PvP in shadow you should take a look at undead. 
---
If you are gonna be full PvP you have to be full shadow to be really efficient.
---
But it's vanilla you can play hybrid spec, it may work in specific situations. Don't forget to up engineer
---
Was thinking of this too. The ticks seems to jump between the two except for the combat log, which I intepretate as the most accurate, but not sure.
---
I'm 22 I don't know if that counts?
---
You don't. You don't alleviate anything. #NoChanges
---
Amazing work you have done, keep it up! Thank you so much for sharing this with us :)
---
Source?
---
It's great to see a Gnome main tanking MC lol
---
Lol you are the reason retail sucks ass
---
I don't think we need any news at all. They have told us and re-confirmed its release for Summer 2019. The only news I expect to hear anytime between now and then is when they announce a closed-beta.
---
Anyone got both maps edited together?
---
It's not so bad. Even with a relaxed pace you can do 1-20 in less than 24 hours played. 20-35 in about one to two more days.
---
Retail
---
It's the official name. 
---
Most definitely, vanilla CE shouldn’t work on classic and classic CE shouldn’t work on retail. It would be beyond messed up if they introduced the pets to retail again via classic CE.
---
Excuse the literal trash on the bottom of the picture, in the process of cleaning
---
&gt;There may be numerical differences between Original Vanilla and best-guess Private Server replications. They aren’t very noticeable and don’t make much of a difference
---
Except they are.  
---
People playing in Vanilla, and leveling guides made then, don’t indicate that you can quest to 60 without a lot of grinding.
---
People that play on Private servers with massively inflated 2.3 xp values, constantly say they can. 
---
That’s a major difference. Finishing every quest available to you, and then having to grind half a level for any new ones, is how Vanilla worked. Private servers do not work like that. 
---
That’s a major difference. As someone that played Vanilla when it was live that’s one of the huge delimeters between Vanilla and anything after it. From TBC onward you could just quest all the way up. In Vanilla you could not.
---
Sharding is nothing compared to that glaring flaw. Especially with the way Blizz proposes using it, e.g. only to smooth out the initial launch.
---
As is you’re wrong about sharding having an impact like that. When Vanilla launched server queues were tiny, and users had to have a box copy the game (of which there were limited quantities) to play.
---
So you didn’t have 300+ people per starting zone all competing for the same quest. In fact in Vanilla, for a lot of people, they played in an empty or mostly empty starting zone, since they didn’t join in the initial wave.
---
So, in terms of authenticity, no, you’re wrong. Sharding will at worst cap starting zones at maybe 50-100 people per shard. Which is likely much busier than authentic Vanilla servers were, at launch. 
---

(It's just a short transcript.) There are blue answers elsewhere too about it being separate, won't try and find them now, sorry. :)
---
Private server PvP, you mean :)
---
There definitely were some really nice unconventional "hard modes" in vanilla, like the Stratholme undead-side rush. I think it'd be really cool to have those kinds of additions in just more instances and raids overall. That kinda stuff however needs hiring people who have experience with the clunky old WoW and know it's "balance" (or lack thereof), yeah. Which there's probably no shortage of, but I don't see Activision-Blizzard's employers hiring people who made illegal servers. I was pretty impressed alone when the Nostalrius team got to meet with Blizzard's executives and game directors.

Nobody cares what you think. How laughably presumptuous of you to think that we do and should bend to your will. Are you some kind of psychopath?
---
really depends on the type of people raiding tbh. hardcore no, casuals probably
---
All these together is maybe 1/3rd what Vanilla is worth
---
I started playing Horde back in vanilla, and until I stopped playing 2 years ago I mained Horde. Recently I started playing on a private server as Alliance. I'm only level 32, but have loved it so far. I am really into the lore of Warcraft, so expanding my knowledge of the lore, and "new content" from quests and exploring has been amazing. I would recommend at least having an alt to experience Alliance, I regret not doing this sooner. Cheers!

Alternatively a warlock can kill himself with hellfire and revive himself behind the door.

I’d youre going troll, definitely go shadow. Their racials are so good with shadowform.
---
If you’re not a healer you won’t be as high a priority either. So when your team needs heals you can always pop out 
---
Oof, I ask the community their opinion on something, therefore I must be a psychopath.
---
&gt;A perm stickied thread with links to old discussions about that subject would likely better serve this community than allowing those already done to death discussions to continue.
---
Aslong as its possible to discuss it there i see no issue with this solution. 
---
&gt;The problem is that they don’t want to really discuss it.
---
I hardly see this being true, obviously they, (including me) want to discuss it, and while several have done a shit job in starting that discussion there is atleat one example of you being wrong. I've read far from everyone of those discussions but the [most upvoted post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/top/?sort=top&amp;t=year) in this subreddit for a year is a discussion about just that, [what happens after naxx](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a16wwq/unpopular_opinion_the_future_of_wow_classic/)
---
The frontpage would have gotten wind of it for sure but still, people want to discuss it so just let them, especially if they can do it without pissing of a lot of people with the recurring bad posts.
---
You ever try getting buzzard meat in Redridge? It's the same thing.
---
OOOFFFF
---
They're getting dismantled cause workers organizing is the only real threat.
---
I always had fun being able to carry a full WSG game by myself in 29 39 and 49 brackets.
---
When you would just random queue and get messages from people on your faction saying thank god you are here. Was a nice feeling
---
Fair point. If that is the kind of content that gets the most upvotes it is obviously the kind of content the majority of the community is looking for. I guess I'll just have to go look somewhere else, thanks!
---
It's not the size about sharding thats the issue. It's the phasing in and out, the impermanence of your connection to everyone else in the world. If everyone there killing boars with me at level 1 is in the same world as me at level 10, then thats a much better way to handle it. Getting shifted to a different plane every 500 feet is much more of an issue.
---
If *anybody* just quests to 60, they will have blank levels where they have to grind. This is still true on Private Servers. Revantusk village, Silithus, and Thorium Point are examples that made the problem less of an issue. Even if you do most quests in-game, you will probably be able to find time to dungeon *alot*. 
---
IDK if you mean that mobs have 2.3x values as well? It really doesn't seem like it, as somebody who played in Vanilla. The quests as-is give, like, 4/10 of a bar at best, at higher levels, so if places like Nost/lh only have quests values wrong, that still is quite a minor change, given that *most* of your XP comes from killing.
---
&gt;Guys the Tier 3 will destabilise the Warsong Gulch! It's gonna be too strong! Somebody think of the fresh 60s in greens!! Everyone will run around in full tier 3 and then the server will be ded!!!
---
What drugs are you taking man? Its a known fact that the population will plummet once AQ gear starts rolling out. 
---
Kind of like how people who started in Wrath were deemed "Wrath Babies", people who start in Vanilla (ironically the earliest you can start) are Vanilla Babies. It's probably more self-deprecating than calling ourselves the Kings, though.
---
And can he open the door from inside ?
---
Like “we want TBC” and the another guy answer “ WOTLK too” *sigh*
---
This isn't really Priest-related, as much as it's just PvP general.
---
Consider a well-geared DPS + an undergeared DPS. Now consider a well-geared DPS + an undergeared support. The undergeared support, by extending the lifetime of the well-geared DPS, is effectively lowering the difference in gear between himself and the opponents.
---
So the answer to your question is moreso, just how far are you behind on gear compared to the average PvPer? If it's far, you'll want to devote yourself to more of a supportive role, rather than a front-line role. And that doesn't just go for healers. Undergeared pure DPS classes should put more emphasis on CC'ing and disrupting the fight than you would if you had good gear and can reliably kill people on your own.
---
I will say that Shadow Priests are a bit more gear reliant than most. A lot of the time they have to fall back to DPS race and/or face tanking, which is something more gear related than say kiting or controlling opponents as a Mage or Hunter. But even so, it's still largely just an analysis of how your gear compares to that of your allies/opponents.
---
&gt;Last big WoW update basically gives players a free peiece of ilvl400-ish gear.
---
Isnt that bad? Last time I played retail my itemlevel was nearing 800 or something. Why is suddenly ilvl 400 relevant gear?
---
I’ve never seen a person convinced to change their initial view in any of those posts.
---
So is it really a discussion. Or is it a circle jerk?
---
I’ve yet to see someone that starts with the stance of “we need post Naxx content, Karazhan was supposed to be post Naxx. Therefore Kara post Naxx” ever really aborb the facts about what they’re saying when those facts are presented to them. Doesn’t matter what the responds to that person is. They don’t budge. 
---
Doesn’t matter if you show that Kara was supposed to be in TBC as of like 1st quarter 2005. Or that finished Kara clearly wasn’t made for 40 mans. Or that gear scaling would be really messed up on any post Naxx content since Naxx gear is already OP. That doing Naxx gear but for other specs will break other things. Or that the OSRS model probably won’t happen at Blizzard since WoW is a fraction of their overall income, unlike Runescape and their parent company. 
---
Or or or.
---
So, I honestly disagree. People want to circle jerk. Not discuss, when it comes to this particular subject. 
---
Discussion would imply an actual exchange of differing ideas. That doesn’t really happen. 
---
If it did I’d agree. But I’ve participated in way too many of them to feel that way. 
---
no way, feralas is a hot leveling zone, ashzara is just this dead footnote with like 5 quests that aren't even in the same level bracket as each other.
---
2019 Reddit shittalker and a person who would have been getting 2 shot by me in 2006.
---
yes maraudon should indeed be by the valley of spears.
---
How can you forget trash blade!?
---
This has happened too many times to me. Every character I level now always do the scholomance key questchain before I hit 60. It's well worth the 15 gold it costs to do the quest.
---
No classic? Scrub
---
Devouring plague is incredibly overrated, its really mana inefficient and has way to much cooldown.  
---
For PvP i'd say Dwarf &gt; Troll &gt; Undead
---
Yes, you can pull a torch on the wall inside to open the door.
---
I honestly hope that they do. The main reason is that Nostalrius was BIG, but everything else after that is even bigger. We're on the point where Vanilla is pretty much "solved". There is MODERN strategies covering every aspect of the game, due to all the hype and official legacy announce in particular.
---
However, TBC is not as popular. Most of the class guides, raid strategies, known farm spots et cetera et cetera are still pretty much 2007. There lies a huge room for exploring :)
---
So yeah, would be nice if they eventually come up with that.
---
Quest xp was increase by about 30% in 2.3. That is the set of values private servers are using. 
---
That is a huge number. It drastically changes the game. 
---
As some other people say in comments, just forget what you've heard about spec viability. This is a pure product of minmaxers in pservers players.
---
Many guilds went up to AQ40 and even Naxxramas in Vanilla with non-optimal raids, offspecs, and even with close to no one using consume in the raid.
---
Yes warriors, rogues and mages do more DPS than hybrids, but that doesn't prevent you of clearing all Classic content with some hybrid DPS in your raids. What hardcore pservers players are doing by screaming all that is only for the sake of being able to clear content faster in average, but that is not the point for most people. 
---
Don't forget WoW is a game. Don't fall in their trap where they say you should feel guilty in regard to your raid if you don't play an optimal spec. If someone does not want to play with you, then you will find other players to play with. That's very simple. Hardcore pservers players are a vocal minority in this sub. Classic won't be like that for the most part. And the major difficulty for raids will be to gather 40 people on every raid night. If you are reliable they will gladly accept you in raids whatever you play.
---
stat squish,numbers were getting out of hand
---
Why is mop and legion rated 12 but the others T?
---
If all your primary goal is just AoE farming, then Soulforge or even potentially the blue PVP set are definitely better than Lawbringer.  Lawbringer gives you some more armor and sta than the others, but +94 spelldam (on Soulforge, more on PVP) will more than make up for that, not to mention that Lawbringer spends points on resistances and spirit which has little benefit to you while farming.  
---
For trinkets, look at things like Uther's Strength and Force of Will for absorbing damage, or Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom and essence of pure flame for killing faster.  Rings, if you can get one the Naglering is great but any rings which boost spell damage (the AQ20 Paladin ring is nice) or armor/block/defense are good.
---
Yup, or another possibility would be to get killed by the other faction. On Nostalrius when none of my buddies had a key I would just AFK at the door since I knew I would get killed within 5 min due to the massive population.
---
If someone proofs to be trustworthy and has a certain threshold of quality and pride in their work, then I would do that, but Activision has to earn some respect back, because they have no standards left.
---
But fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
---
Rolled on a sword with +1% crit... for spells. Had not even realized that "crit" and "spell crit" were different things until then. In my (weak9 defense, it was the first item with spell crit I'd even seen. Still, should have been reading the tooltip more carefully.
---
They did a stats squish before bfa and changed the ilvls
---
A lot of people obviously don’t play private and it shows. Most people specify which wing, but I see a couple dozen a week that don’t. 
---
do we really need confirmation that vanilla is beginner/non-gamer friendly? we had videos about elders playing wow 15 years ago
---
Nice collection, missing that classic though...same as me to be honest but mine are unsealed.
---
The holy grail though...sigh...one day I will have one lol. Good luck on your search for a decently priced one :)
---
Haven’t played since vanilla, but I skipped Feralas completely haha. Only went there for Dire Maul. Just a personal thing I guess
---
What Sebover said, sorry, I wrote my first reply on my phone so it just auto corrected the hell out of it. But yeah the dungeon sets aren't really good.
---
I started playing on the Kalecgos server in '05. They always called it VC. But it seems that the majority of servers called it DM. Which does make sense, I'm just used to it being called VC. 
---
I don't care what people call it... but not everybody feels that way.
---
Sell them. Dead game is dead 💀 
---
5.0.4 is the prepatch before mop came out
---
It's treason then
---
Let's just be a bit careful with wording here. There are plenty of really nice people on Private Servers too (I met a lot when playing on them for about 5 years) and being a try-hard does not automatically make you a no-life loser or a toxic player.
---
Jamie, pull that shit up
---
I did use both Prat and Chatmod in vanilla but I'm pretty sure they didn't offer custom fonts. 
---
After doing some googling and searching around I'm 99% sure what I'm looking for was called ClearFont.  
---
The original ClearFont downloads have all been erased from the net but its later version ClearFont2 comes with the Calibri font which seems to be what the original ClearFont used.
---
Me with hamstring, berzerker rage etc on warrior 
---
And its gotten even worse since the Classic announcement. Some servers are shutting down entirely on Classic launch, and the ones that aren't are going to have a small husk of the community still playing on them. 
---
This.
---
I grinded sulthraze on my hunter back in the day. It looked cool and it was epic, so that was all that mattered.
---
get a rogue or someone to suicide next to the door.

---
Yeah why is everyone here pretending like you're forced to open and read every post about post-naxx content. I got bored of the discussion a while ago so now I, y'know, don't open those posts. But they still get 50-60 comments every time, so clearly some people out there are still happy to discuss it. 
---
I think trolls are under-rated and that shadowguard is much better than DP in the matchups that matter, but WotF still gives Undead the edge in PvP overall imo. 
---
I’m going to make a guild called “non viable” and it’s all filled with random ass specs and we still clear content
---
Leveling rogue to 60.
---
No.

Sounds right, but you can also just change the fonts wow use yourself.

Any idea number wise on how sor vs soc compared dps wise with equivalent gear and consumables? 
---
Enh sham was really op in vanilla. I got living proof like recordings and such on my hard drive

Nah, I'd say we're fine. Among the online games, classic Wow is less suspectible to cause this (another reason why the game is that successful nowadays), and here's why:
---
1) The game itself is pretty chill. You can peacefully quest, listen to the Azeroth vibes, observe the surroundings for easter eggs, get into the lore etc. There's not that much that can trigger you in general.
---
2) There is no race in Vanilla. You're not forced to chase the numbers and climb the ladder. If you fail, you aren't losing anything but your time (Therefore hardcore players are speedrunners). 
---
And I'll be very generous if I say that those people (PvP rankers/PvE speedrunners) are 10% of the total population. EVEN on private servers. 
---
Choose a pack that has the same mentality as you do and everything's going to be good.
---
3) Playing this game overtime if you're bored is a chore. Considering how much you shall commit to do stuff. It's easy to play the game of dota and bitch about everything because it will end in 30 mins. Meanwhile in Classic, by that time you'd only get to a raid and spend 3 more hours. Not that many people would torture themselves like that, they'd rather quit and bitch about the game on the forums (but that's a little different story xD).
---
I have cataclysm and Legion. I wish i had vanilla, tbc and wrath. But i was too young to buy such things back then.
---
The quest xp rate is 100% correct on private servers. Leveling on private servers is a carbon copy of vanilla leveling. 
---
Are the boss values incorrect? Probably, that’s why private servers like to play it safe by highly overtuning the bosses. 
---
Because then the game would be easier and less balanced.
---
I don't think that the lack of absolute permanence is a very serious matter from this point of view. What happened to Nostalrius was an exception in the world of pservers when they instantly agreed to sacrifice all their work for the sake of official classic, even though it had a very unclear perspective in 2016. 
---
Nevertheless, even now you can still play your nostalrius characters on their successor's server, and they have managed to provide a decent and stable vanilla experience for the time being.
---
I think that the biggest stumbling block between pserver and other folks is going to be the attitude and vision of the game. People would come back expecting to do things in the way they used to do earlier, and the one can't blame them for doing so. Yet game might stay the same, but the way how it's played will differ. And that's where the storm will rise.
---
People from retail would have the same problem from the opposite side, their vision of the game would be imprinted by BfA and the way how things work in there.
---
My friends are bad about this when introducing me to a game they've played for a while that I'm new to. They constantly want to rush me to the end game and tell me how to do everything. I'm sure they think they're being helpful but it really ruins the experience and they wonder why I'm not as in to it as them.
---
in that case, a and d to strafe instead of turn  
---
I may or may not have read OP's post a bit too fast.
---
I wish I could toss $2300 at something I'd never use.
---
The ones that sell for $200-300 are not sealed and obviously already claimed the pets (or else they would be worth hundreds more). A sealed CE would easily sell for over $1,000.
---
Stayed up all night boys, managed to hit level 11 on my alt.
---
For a fury pov the glancing is very important actually cause it generates smooth rage gen; its not uncommon to spend rage based on your rage gen on a fight given your gear/consumes/wbuffs and suddenly get an unlucky string of two misses, a dodge, and then your next couple swings are glancing. 
---
Eventually you can easily cap your entire rage bar in a few seconds and be suddenly dry for a bit, people significantly underrate a smoother rage gen, which weaponskill greaty affects

T is a rating for the ESRB in North American ratings system. 12 would be PEGI from Europe's ratings system. 
---
Bold of you to assume my basement will allow sunlight. Lol
---
You sound far more toxic than most private server players.
---
Did you buy them as an investment? 
---
This
---
I think he means:  why did you never open them? Isn't the whole idea of these things to enjoy the artwork and other extras? 
---
What matchups would those be?
---
I'm glad someone brought this up. Hey, r/classicwow, why have we collectively neglected this issue for so long and not talked about it?
---
No. They’re using 2.3 xp values and have for some time. 
---
Sad you don’t know that. But there’s been plenty of discussions about it here. 
---
They don’t have solid documented data for pre 2.3 values anywhere. There aren’t vids of people completing every quest and thottbot/wowhead pulled live values. 
---
You’re right. After warlords, cats doesn’t look so bad... all I did was dungeons and rep grind tho so I don’t have much to say about it
---
Cant tell if sarcasm
---
When I taught my day to play long ago the camera and movement controls were the hardest thing for him to master. I made him be a warrior so he could tank my shaman through dungeons and that probably didn’t help either... 
---
You just got to the top of the building and jump off a couple times.  It is known.
---
I still have my code for the murloc outfit unused from the first blizzcon. That with anything?
---
My comment was only from a Rogue standpoint, as I have no in-depth knowledge of the Warrior class but your comment makes sense, in addition to the fact that they do not have a +5 talent (they do have the epic +skill gloves though, but given their price / rarity, one cannot assume their warrior will have them) :).
---
Well, I'm not going to edit and type "/s" above. But I bet with a little research you could figure it out.
---
No they don’t use 2.3 xp values. You are utterly clueless. Every quest in the game has been verified using vanilla clips mainly joana’s 1 to 60 series. Every single quest and mob xp rate is 100% authentic to vanilla. 
---
&gt;Consider it a later game gimmick.
---
In fact it is the opposite, you can tank up to mid 40's level, after that the lack of plate is too much of an issue. Low levels you will be able to tank if you have an open minded group. Use down ranked earth shocks on CD and max rank as your 'taunt'.
---
Pet tanking was for when the actual tank dropped the group so you would try to pull mobs while looking for another tank.
---
the price of these kind of things only goes up, so (if chosen wisely) it's a very good investment.  the only problem is you do need to have some initial money to get started and you need to actually sell some items from time to time to recoup the money.  I did this successfully with magic the gathering cards , but I  sold them too early (to pay off some student debts)  Made a few thousand, but it could have been tens of thousands if I had waited another 5-10 years 
---
But what good are they if you can't use the stuff inside them?
---
Heal priests are great but they don't make the most compelling pwning vids.
---
Whether tri-spec or full shadow your role will primarily be utility. Mana drain, silence, mind flay, spamming low level SW;P to get blackout procs. You will have some difficulty melting faces solo until your gear progresses. That said more damage and better physical mitigation of full shadow is still a valid tradeoff instead of investing in all three trees.
---
You might not want to hear it but honestly a heavy disc/holy build focusing on healing is probably the most impactful PvP spec early on. With lower gear positioning yourself to take advantage of mana burn or silence will often get you killed. On Horde side your defensive dispel is very valuable, staying in the back and healing primarily won't give you the most opportunity for highlight vids, but is very likely to be the best way to improve your likelihood to win a bg or medium sized wpvp encounter. It also has the benefit of matching your PvE spec relatively closely.
---
I mean you could do that but the game you would make would be nothing like Vanilla so you couldn't call it WoW Classic, because recreating Vanilla is the entire point of WoW Classic.
---
If you had nothing to add to the discussion other than to say the discussion has already been had in a really smartass way, why did you open the post in the first place? Not everyone stalks this sub 15 hours a day. I didnt know a post like this was already made a while ago, you couldve simply just said so from the beginning
---
Veterans of the First War ;)
---
Yeah youre right
---
I think a lot of people play a game they hate is because they've played it for so long it's just pretty of their life now. To stop playing is them acknowledging they've wasted so much of their time. Not the time they enjoyed the game. But the years they've hated it, but couldn't stop because it was just their daily routine. So they take they're anger about the situation out on others.
---
I see, so I assume the same goes for D2 as well, and in addition to that, upgrading to D2 is a huge investment. Thank you for clearing it up!
---
LMAOOO this made me crack up xD 
---
&gt;Not everyone stalks this sub 15 hours a day. I didnt know a post like this was already made a while ago
---
We have a search feature for a reason. Also blizzard has already had it clear they have no intend on balancing. If you want modern balance they have BfA.
---
That's inevitable, yes. Even guild drama on the same faction will emerge. All the killstealers and whatnot
---
Yeah, for sure. Not to saying I wont have some alts on PVP servers though.
---
For my main, I am going Alliance. I am remaking all of my old characters. LOL! Same as with the servers, I will have alts on both. I get into Alt-oholic mode. :)
---
&gt; and we still clear content
---
Some content. Slowly. Congrats on the 6 hour MC clear.
---
slave market in Gadgetzan sells nice ones , try the neutral AH! 
---
Impressive. /envy
---
ouuuf +F
---
Visual novels, I have a very long backlog
---
Alright, I'll bite: trying to rebalance classes for PvE is the best way to further unbalance PvP, possibly tip faction balance, and make PvE content even easier when people are already worried about the difficulty being too low. That's a high price to pay for a small group of people to have a higher chance of getting to play a different spec during progression.
---
I used to time my 1-6 runs on almost all characters and zones, in all expansions up to Cata. Regardless of how fast you were, when solo, 1-6 in any zone and any class took between 55-60 minutes. From Cata onwards with the huge power creep and heirlooms, it was a bit quicker.
---
And I think from 6 to 10 it was another 3-4 hours if you weren't dicking about. 
---
I think I'm gonna try 1-15 on launch night with a *healthy* dose of junk food. This actually reminds me how awesome D3's launch was; I was loaded on Red Bull and jacked off to Error 37. Good times.
---
Lol. Sure thing. 
---
 I had that bow on my hunter all the way untill 60, and i think its one the reasons why i couldnt afford a normal mount untill 60... spending fortune on arrows
---
Matchups sort of implies classes in which case I'd say the consistent damage and stun proc is preferred in duels against locks, rogues, warriors, and paladins (though that's an easy matchup anyway).
---
More generally I think DP has much lower value against prepared PvP opponents in duels or world PvP (who will know how to reset the fight when DP is used if they cant cleanse it). In battlegrounds (again assuming the opponent is somewhat with it) paladins will just cleanse it away.
---
DP is great for rolling noobs, but the consistent impact of shadowguard (hex is also slightly better than touch imo) is more useful against more capable opponents. That said WotF still makes undead the preferred PvP class in most cases imo.
---
Sure it is, for pvp you want to stack a lot of intellect (and stam ofc) as a priest. so as long as you have between 5.5k-7k mana you're good
---
I hope we get more shit like this when classic releases.
---
Warrior/Mage/Shamy/Paly will be the popular classes. Druid the least popular and then warlock. Priest/Rogue/Hunter are the middle ones. Rogue popularity depends a bit on server type. Locks and priests are more popular on horde.  
---
Overall it really doesn't matter though. If you want to be a snowflake you can play Druid but there'll be decent amounts of everything else.
---
I think it will look like this: the 4 healing classes will be at the bottom. Top will be Warrior, Mage, Hunter and Rogue in that order. Warlocks will be right in the middle. 
---
I don't know about others, but I plan to play a Priest, Paladin or Shaman. (Possibly mage for ports, but I don't know)
---
I plan to partner up with a warrior or lock or something, when it releases. Just gotta find one first. 
---
I don't know about statistics, but if there are surplus warriors struggling, I think I can find a duo easily as a healer. :)
---
I leveled a night elf hunter to level 28, then had no clue where to go once I finished duskwood and STV was 2 levels too high for me... so I restarted as a dwarf hunter named "Bobbo" and figured the new starting area would help me level past 28. I shit you not, I leveled the dwarf to exactly level 28 and promptly ran out of duskwood quests. Eventually, I spoke up to my brother about it who told me about how many other zones there were to level in. Turns out, I hadn't touched ashenvale on either character.
---
yhea this is the content we all need
---
I shall keep that in mind, i'd go for both sets then lawbringer for PvP and try soulforge for AoE, nothing to lose having both!
---
I did the whole Taelan Fordring quest chain and escort and picked the healing ring. I'm a warlock
---
Interesting, a lot of people are saying warlocks will be way more popular in classic than they were in vanilla. I guess it makes since that pallies and shaman will be more popular than the polls say because they're split between horde and alliance. 
---
That makes a lot of sense. Who do you think will be the most and least popular healers?
---
Nice, are you going pvp server or pve?
---
“I hold threat better with a 2-hander.”  A direct quote from me when my warrior was in her early 50’s and ruining a run for some guild members. They booted me and had a competent 60 finish the run for them. Thankfully, my replacement was extremely kind and educated me. I went on to be a primary raid tank for that guild all the way till Wrath.
---
I actually kept a screen shot of a whisper from a random player saying that I inspired him to roll a warrior after I tanked an UBRS pug for him. Probably my favorite memory from Vanilla. 
---
I like pvp servers. 
---
And the weather! Don’t forget the rain and myst!
---
Doing key quests to open doors, lol plebs. 
---
*This post brought to you by the Rogue gang*
---
I can understand the dispell. But Shadowguard is mana consuming too, with "only" 3 charges for 250 mana
---
Shadowguard isn't useless, but it's no DP. DP does about 1.5k dmg and heals for 1.8k at lvl 60. So that's about 3.3k HP health differential for one single global cast. It is absurdly strong. Yes it costs a lot of mana, but it has the exact cooldown of innerfocus and a spriest has nothing good to use inner focus on anyway, so the manacost is almost irrelevant. Yes it is great for rolling noobs. And also beating decent players. And really good players. And 2v1s, and when you're outgeared or outlevelled. And you get WotF. So I agree with you, UD is the preferred spriest class, and it's not really close.
---
Priests Pallys &amp; Druids on Alliance.
---
Not sure about Horde, but Priest #1 again followed by Shammys then Druids.
---
to flex
---
No, stoping lower geared players is literally the point of getting geared lol.
---
You are not prepared
---
I have [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAKvIx6eQpA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1017) ready exactly for this kind of posts.
---
Will we have both moons again? Or was it patched out by 1.12?
---
We don't fucking care. Thx
---
Based on private server distribution, it seems to follow the same pattern - Warrior at the top, Mage 2., Rogue and hunter tied for 3. And 4., then Priest and Warlock, Shaman + Paladin and Druid as a last. Now this could change a bit due to various factors for classic, but it's really hard to predict. My bet is that at lvl 60, it will stay around the same.
---
It’s definitely VC. DM is dire maul 
---
"I don't like something so I think we should delete all traces of it from the subreddit" Yeah man you're a little off.
---
Could’ve at least modified this copypasta to suit WoW’s sky somehow.
---
Yeah I think when it actually comes out there will be a pretty strong 'noob effect' where a large amount of people in 1-2 months into Classic will be people who didn't do any polls and haven't played private servers before, which basically means there will be more hunters/rogues then the polls say. They probably won't have a huge effect on what the lvl 60 and especially the raiding population will be like though.
---
At least 50% of the player base will be new 
---
We it has always bee VC since vanilla. At least that’s what people on blackrock called it 
---
I wish WotF weren't so good so that this could be a more interesting conversation, but as it is its not worth defending trolls too strongly.
---
I do think the more you prioritize bgs compared to duels the closer it becomes.
---
bad mage is bad
---
thank you for your contribution
---
I am 22, not too young but younger than most ages on this sub. I actually started playing WoW when I was 8 yrs old just because my brother and his friends all had it. I mostly watched my bro and dad play, but I did get a nelf hunter to early 40s in Vanilla before BC rolled around. 
---
I stacked agility because I thought it made me run faster lol
---
Kirill 1, 2
---
ret pvp
---
A lot of people are looking to get people who previously didn't play wow to join them in classic. This is useful information to many people.
---
Thank you!
---
i read on here at some point that on private servers, while not specifically based on character, loot was based on raid ID so people could go into MC and use something like atlasloot to query certain desirable items (onslaught girdle, CFT, etc.) and if it worked then the item was set to drop. as such they’d use that character without logging/leaving to get the instance ID.
---
this could’ve all been wrong, though. i know i read it on here and so.. yeah, not 100% believable.
---
Im a collector so yes and no lol
---
Logical. That was how the original Diablo worked.
---
Exacly the same situation for me, I was 13 when vanilla came out so. I Didnt even know there was CE back then.
---
No thanks
---
OSRS and PUBG
---
haha lol. yeah i started at 8 too becuase my mum &amp; brother who played together let me play for them. I could remember my mum getting me to farm ores for her 
---
I played classic as a warlock but this time I also want to heal as a druid. I've seen videos that druids weren't that great in wow so I'm wondering could I realistically get a raid spot as a resto druid or is it going to be hard to get one?
---
&gt; another shaman was running by and stopped to watch me and asked why I didn't just interrupt the mob's casting spells
---
Vanilla social dynamics in a nutshell. People were helpful.
---
If all you cared about at all was premade BGs then yeah troll would be pretty strong because DP would rarely do anything with dedicated enemy support, but you're going to have a hard time getting a consistent premade slot as a shadow priest anyway, and in organised BGs WotF is still a really strong racial - and especially for a support priest in a premade which is what you'll probably be specced.
---
In vanilla I never had a problem even with geared rogues on a warlock but other classes I can see them being a problem 
---
omg that is right. it has been so long i forgot, my bad.
---
never played anything except vanilla
---
hmm, does it now?
---
lmao, she put your youth to good use
---
As you point out warrior and warlock would be ridiculously strong. Ele shamy would be nice but not majorly different. I don't think it would make much difference to anyone else, they either need 3 trees (like rogues) or the 20/30 point talents are meh so you don't build around them (priest/hunter/druid/pally).
---
&gt; right click failed
---
aah, oldschool problems of vanilla WOW
---
I think it went missing before 1.12
---
I believe the original Pat Tauren Warrior HWL video was made following a bug that allowed warriors to get both MS and Deathwish.
---
Big problem is that they will lose they worth when wow will not continue or worse even go off.
---
Baught Warhammer collectors edition sealed for 15 euros ;) 
---
No, the only "change" acceptable is to revert the threat, especially Shield Slam.
---
 It won't make the others tank stronger but i'll allow them to bright more.
---
But don't worry man, we start with 1.12 ! So you won't feel bad about raiding as enh shaman etc.. the early raid content will be easier from start. So no reason to be refused in raid.
---
It bothers me that you spelled "you" correctly once but not the second time you used it.
---
You will definitely get a raid spot if you go resto druid. Druid is one of the least played classes and very often in demand. 
---
I know the video you're talking about, but looking up on the creator's comments it seems like Deathwish wasn't used very much in the video (about 3 times in total throughout the entire montage) and that the largest crits were done without it. There's definitely more potential than was utilized.
---
Best I can do is tree fiddy
---
July 16th :O:O
---
Deluding yourself, mate. Naxx isn’t hard, it’s time consuming. 
---
^
---
Overpower procs all the time on leveling mobs. Bleeds/rend do decent dmg at low levels and you sword and board until the teens. Warrior is actually really fast at low levels. Anger management passively gives rage which isn't in the tooltip.
---
The 29 Corspemaker axe is OP and drops off the first boss in a instance and is easily farmed. When you get WW/Sweeping strikes Arms is borderline OP on more than one mob due to how sweeping strikes interacts with whirlwind and bouncing. After corpsemaker you get WW axe which is also OP.
---
You shouldn't  touch fury until 60 and you should be tanking instances as the arms/leveling spec anyways. The only way I would consider it is if it's an alt with blue BOE one handers/enchants until corspemaker and then I would respec. That's something you can do if you are loaded and have a ton of gold way down the line. Even then you still would be arms at 51 with Iced Barbed Spear.
---
Why is no one talking about hex of weakness? Mini MS is just wonderful. 
---
$11 btw
---
When people say “full shadow” what do they mean here?
---
Just off the top of my head, ele shamans would get buffed significantly, as they can use nature’s swiftness and the last elemental talent point in the talent tree. 
---
I did not learn poisons on my rogue until 60.
---
Wasn't there yellow ghost wandering around? I remember dueling down to 1hp then pulling a mob to die. 
---
It's pretty straightforward once you know what the stats do. Stacking intelligence on mana users is a bit of a noob trap when it does very little for you while levelling, in general +damage gear is far superior (if you can find it). It also depends a bit on if you want to pvp or are on a pvp server or not in how valuable stamina is.
---
At the start Rogue, Paladin, Hunter will be top. Then rogue population will fall off a cliff when people realize warriors are op/broken in 1.12 and rogues are pointless and you will see a lot of rogues reroll. Mage population will be end up very high due to so many warriors. Rogues will actually be rare on PVE servers because in PVE they are just bad fury warriors with no utility. There are going to be A LOT more warlocks than there were in real vanilla. Way more. Hunters will drop off because they will be bad ranged in 1.12 with 16 debuffs like they were in Naxx and because hunters have a much harder rotation in raiding than the rest of the ranged to do less damage (not very fulfilling). I think a lot of the hunters will end up Locks. Paladin will always be popular because many of the people that play them die 100 times before level 20 on the other melee classes. Enhance Shaman will be popular for the same reason. 
---
Because we're "old bastards"
---
Hm, maybe they should consider not doubling the amount of stats you get every raid tier instead :D
---
I’m Interested. I used to play on MagicWow.co.uk
---
- JC
---
that's quite impressive, it must hurt to be missing the best one
---
Yes, holy shock/prot spec is the way to go if you want to tank some 5mans without switching spec all the time.
---
Rogues are fun to gank with while levelling but really aren't a strong pvp class at lvl 60. A spriest at can pretty much watch a movie on the other screen while beating them.
---
&gt;Private servers are full of try hard no life losers.
---
Probably easier to call everyone else tryhard nolife losers than it is to admit maybe you are just bad?
---
The dungeon sets are terrible. A mage with no + dmg might as well be naked.
---
Yes it hurts man
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGRbbZf0tZVMGpcz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGRbbZf0tZVMGpcz) this is THE priest pvp spec. Awesome for both BGs and solo. All the best priests use it. Shadowform is shit in bgs as all ur dots will be dispelled and ull be oom 6 seconds into a group fight. 
---
Let me save you a bunch of reading. It's about 5 percent more damage. You can make up for that with consumables easily. If you are a hardcore player you can raid as any race. This is not TBC with a failed esport where Arena is all that matters and BG's have been made pointless. This is not modern WoW where they have wannabe esport difficulty in PVE. The difficulty in Vanilla PVE is farming, time commitment, dedication.
---
If you are going to pvp a lot be a dwarf for rogue. They racial, is very, very strong for rogue. You will escape hunters that destroy other rogues when they get the opener. You will win rogue rogue mirrors often because you can immune blind, and because you are alliance you don't have to deal with perception.
---
If you are going to PVE mainly be whatever you want. 
---
I won’t want any alts for some time though. We can roll alliance!
---
If you want to hybrid go smite disc. For pure damage PvP go full shadow.
---
Madman
---
Better time that just right! Can’t miss the launch!!
---
well if anyone deserves to find a good deal on one, it's you. I'd rather you get it than someone like me
---
Awesome!! I didn't know about this. I guess I didn't think wowhead would have a classic version of itself. In retrospect it makes sense they do, I guess I never looked. Thanks for linking it!
---
Come on.. When you have done MC a hundred times, and some shitter show up late, expecting everyone to wait while he gets his pet from the stable and buys consumables from the AH, you have every reason to be upset.
---
You must really want an owl.
---
I wanna buy these and hang them up, how do you know someone didn't just reseal a bunch of socks though
---
Why do you think warlock will increase in popularity?
---
Well considering nobody here has actually shown that these players hate the game, your post is full of shit.
---
Because I bought them myself in stores
---
While you can theory craft a lot of different things, the easiest way to rationalize this question is "what class would benefit from having both a 21 and 31 point talent?". Asking in this way in vacuum makes the analysis a bit worse but a bit easier.
---
As a Druid, the only real improvement I can see would be getting access to Leader of the Pack and Nature's Swiftness for PvP purposes. It would provide a nice damage increase and survivability bonus but wouldn't be too insane. Otherwise, it is hard to imagine anyone being super happy to mix 31 balance/resto with 21 point feral faerie fire, or even 31 point resto with 21 point nature's grace. Moonkin having access to nature's swiftness also doesn't do much as Starfire is an arcane class skill.
---
All in all, it would greatly improve their flexibility and tool kit, but would absolutely not make them broken or imbalanced in any way.
---
I'll leave this here too: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAi0ofxt0d](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAi0ofxt0d) if you play together with a mage or elemental shaman. It's not shadow but still a popular pvp healer spec that goes well with a caster friend. Good thing with this is that you can raid with it too. But it lacks offensive abilities for solo pvp
---
You can start cranking out transmutes at 35 though, so that's nice.
---
Imagine missing the launch of classic. Gotta wait 15 years for another F R E S H launch.
---
I'm honestly kinda scared that ending up on a streamer's realm will seriously interfere with the experience. I was about to stick with pvp realms anyway, but may will be just wait a few days and see which streamers end up on which realm and avoid that realm.
---
Luckily I'm in EU so this won't be such a big problem as it will be overseas.
---
This is ideal twinking. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like 
---
Praise the Sun!
---
Ahh yes...people can talk about racials all they want, but animations are ALWAYS the reason I decide on class/race combos.
---
My personal favorites, female human spell casting, male dwarf gun, NE male bow, and male human 1H/shield.

&gt;Regardless of how fast you were, when solo, 1-6 in any zone and any class took between 55-60 minutes
---
and then like 18 hours in Goldshire inn (offline, of course)
---
It would also enable a 21/31 ele enhance shenanigans with 100% crit bonus, elemental devastation and storm strike.
---
My first character was a dwarf hunter. I quit him at lvl 8 because I ran out of ammo and thought that it would be really expensive to have to keep buying it (I came from runescape)
---
Unfortunately, no map for Eastern Kingdoms, because Blackrock Mountain has erupted, and they're cancelling all flights because of that Eyjafjallajökull ash.
---
Or not, it was horde killing the flightmaster
---
hopefully the retail servers will have learned from Nost, and allow huge pop servers.
---
Just do the quest.
---
that's more like middle
---
In Vanilla, I thought you had to use walljumping to get to those NPCs in the Wailing Caverns skull. 
---
Cue a forum thread (on the original forums, of course) about the future removal of walljumping and I posted lamenting about how we wouldn’t be able to get to those guys without it. 
---
A Blue popped up and told me that if I had to use walljumping to get to them, I was doing something wrong - or something to that effect. 
---
I melted into an infinite puddle of shame and embarrassment. 
---
In the end, I did figure out what I was supposed to do, but my god was I dumb.
---
Awesome 
---
wait, and marshals refuge?
---
Yeah that’s the one I’ve been seeing. However some take Vamp. Is that by choice? 
---
For Hunters, it would give them extra utility. MM/BM Hunters would get Intimidation, and both BM/MM Surv/MM Hunters would get Scattershot. 
---
Rogues too would benefit quite a lot.
---
I know the build I loved to use in TBC as a rogue was a HARP (Adrenaline Rush, hemorrhage).
---
You could do 0/31/21 and get hemo with adrenaline rush.
---
You could also potentially do 30/0/22, allowing you to get full 5/5 seal fate in assassination, and still get hemo and prep.
---
Warrior is probably the biggest outlier here with MS + Deathwish
---
&gt;Feralas
---
that damn transit point between Ashenvale and Tanaris, when flying from Darnassus to Silithus
---
Boy if you think vanilla is beginner/non gamer friendly, let me introduce you to retail WoW
---
Can we just ban the upvote/downvote function on this reddit? It serves absolutely no purpose. This is some excellent entertaining world PvP that gets downvoted for seemingly no reason.
---
&gt;justice
---
by "justice" you mean randomly prosecuting people because they're the wrong race?
---
Justice will be if you give us half of Draenor, as a compensation for invading Azeroth.
---
Or wait, you destroyed Draenor. Then you have nothing to pay off with, not my problem. Soldiers! Camp 'em, to the end!
---
This is Europe after Brexit. Teldrassil is the UK.
---
Yes, it's because those priests are geared so they deal good dmg, in that case it's worth taking a point from improved inner fire and taking it. But since in classic you won't have that gear for awhile it's not really worth taking it since ur dmg will be low anyway. 
---
Original Classic WoW
---
Normally, it bothers me too, but I’m consciously NOT reacting to this.   ERP (Exposure &amp; Response Prevention) is a type of cognitive behavioral technique that helps people who REALLY are OCD not become anxious over “u”. 
---
Sounds like a plan my friend! :) Do you have any guildies or friends playing? I'm pretty much coming in solo, I think.
---
approximately 3 minutes
---
Paired with which class? Windfury totem is pretty sick
---
I had the same experience with spirit on a shaman. A few points makes a difference at low levels. I learned that basically all stats were useful on my enh shammy.
---
Some stats are still not up to par though. Anything with health/5 is still underwhelming.
---
You humans never learn... Brothers, to arms! Teach the weakling a lesson! Lok'tar Ogar!
---
&gt;Targetted item will be DESTROYED 
---
those kids. When they see caps, they won't read.
---
I would look at class distribution on current vanilla private servers to get a general idea too. 
---
reminds me of that Robes of Insight on my night elf female priest, which I sold along with other low-level gear, once I got to Outland.
---
Fortunately, somehow, it got restored with Legion's wardrobe system.
---
If your buddy is an orc warrior, and you don't want to roll as a shaman to give the alliance the gift of WF crits to the face, you might as well just roll a paladin in a dress and RP in goldshire
---
also, take everything you know about TBC 2v2 arenas, and throw it out a window.
---
smh fam tbh
---
I had them like one row below, on the end of my backpack.
---
Warlock, Soul Link + Siphon Life
---
If you want to do more then heal shaman is good. That class has a ridicoulus amount of abilities for very specific situations. I always looked fondly at the memories of removing ret pally seals
---
Do your 90 minute MC clears make your chode feel bigger? It doesn't make it bigger.
---
Sorry to inform you, but you just did.
---
HAHAHAHAHH Meme game:ELITE
---
Correcting:
---
\[1. General - The Barrens\]
---
I am not the healer person from the post. Also, what do you mean by the comments on arenas. Were they really THAT different than how people tend to say?
---
Warrior. 
---
Introverted nerds tend to have a lot of disposable income.
---
Titran bar?
---
Winter is coming?
---
but that was that one guild, not one guy
---
They have shadowform...
---
&gt; ...you have every reason to be upset at him.
---
I don't think so.  It's fine if you want to have certain expectations, but it's on you to make sure new recruits meet those expectations before bringing them along if you're going to be that serious about it.
---
You can either be elitist and not let newbies in at all, or you can be accommodating and willing to help someone learn, but accepting a new recruit and then just getting frustrated by their newness is a misstep on your own part.
---
because it was huntard, not hunter, and petard, not pet.
---
A lot of people seem to get a hardon from pointing out that something is from a private server and downvoting it.
---
I’m assuming this group has a Warrior tank, just use a skeleton key. 
---
That’s a Cata addition I think. Or if not, certainly a later patch one
---
I know just theorycrafting them both  SoR has a higher potential for dps BiS... but I’ve never raided with SoR so I haven’t done an irl comparison 
---
Why doesn’t the rogue pick it?
---
TBC arena really has nothing to do with vanilla. Resto shamans and resto druids we’re completely different classes in TBC.
---
Can we add blacksmiths to this gang?
---
Its coming out September, day before fall.
---
Looking good my friend!
---
Haha.  I see what “u” did there.  Usually, I’d get mad and downvote the “u” and upvote the people bashing them.  Then I’d rant about it and be all wound up.  Didn’t do that.  It’s really not a big deal that they typed “u”.  I’ll live.   
---
I’m basically typing these responses as a way to deal with this, and it’s helping a lot to keep the anxiety away.  
---
For real. There was a plastic film over the metal parts that would slowly peel and became so grimy that it would actually block the led lights. That said, for a young me, it was a nice introduction to a "gaming mouse".
---
Titan panel YES :D
---
Thanks
---
The 1-20 experience is pure kino on Classic regardless of race.
---
How far you go afterwards depends on how determined you are to reach the end game.
---
Yeah I’ll be solo for sure 
---
Except shamans are one of the best kiters in Vanilla, with frost shock and earthbind totem.
---
Ok, now tell us dishonestly
---
&gt;"Get a rogue"
---
Everyone knows grand marshal gear is hunter gear
---
Orgrimmar not the real orgrimmar :( 
---
Nah it was in classic. Had both horde and alliance FPs
---
It was there in early BC I at least. I remember leveling there with a flight path. P sure it was a goblin.
---
Warriors aren't that hard to level
---
&gt; get a rogue or someone to suicide next to the door.
---
get a rogue, or someone to suicide next to the door.
---
Only thing that needs changing is boss health totals to offset some of the changes that weren't present in the original game (i.e. MC debuff slots were different than they will be in 1.12). 
---
However, I don't even think Blizz is changing that.
---
I literally said thats a factor to worry about in the post. 
---
You can still be neurotic without being OCD.
---
Druid, because it is the sacred class of WOW
---
If you want to dps in raids with a 2h over dw just make surr you are horde as windfury makes 2h comparable to dw 
---
And that's a lovely bit of analysis! 
---
I know you’re making a joke but I liked getting keys/attunements.  Before achievements rolled out it was always cool to have a full key ring. 
---
Well that and in /1 chat saying you had key almost always got you 10 whispers trying to get you in their group. 
---
but Fall officially begins September 23 or something like that
---
My biggest concern is the current server infrastructure. Theres been a couple debacles about streamers gathering 60-80 people for an event, and one shard not being able to handle it all that well.
---
It's mostly the intial 1-5 zone that *benefits* from sharding, but the 1-10 zone will still need sharding to satisfy Blizzard and tourist players. 
---
 
---
But imagine how densely populated Barrens will be? Sure, theres time for people to spread out in levels, but thats still a large chunk of Horde from all 4 races into one zone. If the need for sharding was minor, as in, say that Elwynn was sharded, it would only be into a small number of shards, then that would be alright. But given the reputation Blizzards servers currently have, I don't think it's obscene to say that Elwynn would get split into, like, 10 shards. Consequently, places like Barrens and Westfall would need at least a few shards, otherwise you have people complaining that 1-10 was fine, but it's *impossible* to quest in Barrens, for example. It will be night and day community-wise from 1-10 to 10-20, so there is still some worry that sharding will extend past 1-10.
---
6 minutes until release
---
I agree that shaman would make the best PvP healer. You have windfury totem for your warrior friend. You also have frost shock to slow any enemy so your warrior can be in melee distance. And you have tremor totem to stop fears. If you die, you can reincarnate and continue healing your friend. You can also cast chain lightning to do decent damage. 
---
The first time I did a dungeon (The Stockades) I did not know that you get revived if you enter the dungeon again so when I died I revived myself at the Spirit Healer and had to do the rest of the dungeon with the Resurrection debuff.
---
Further I had no clue what is the difference between "greed" and "need" so I rolled on something "need" although I could not use it (yeah, I played hunter...of course :-p).
---
I can still remember that the tank, a lvl 40 druid, kindly explained me afterwards how everything works in a dungeon. 
---
Rip Nost that was a fun server. Hope Classic is even better but Activision Blizzard is ruining my hopes about it. I’d like to be proven wrong.
---
I remember how it saved my life, after that hours of dazed deaths in Tanaris. As soon as I landed in Un'Goro, I always had to instantly find a repairer.
---
Lol
---
Bannerlord when?
---
5 CD's that would only install a part of the [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher. Priceless.
---
Your pet will take it away from you
---
Don't worry, I'm a grammar nazi too. Despite my unfortunately poor grasp of it.
---
It grinds my gears when I see people carelessly substituting "you're" for "your".
---
They are all good, you can’t go wrong with any of them. Priest and Druid would be a bit better at keeping the warrior alive due to their CC and HoT’s, but Shaman is no slouch and would dramatically decrease the amount of time it would take for a warrior to kill something, thereby lowering healing requirements.
---
Maybe the only tricky part would be mobility. Druid’s and Shamen have various speed increasing forms whereas priests go it by foot. If there is any ever separation, you’d be in big trouble.
---
With Divine Shield and Divine Protection, your immune to all spells and physical damages. You can still interrupt other players casting.
---
And while they can’t cast spells on you, using Blessing of Protection can be dispelled off you since it only protects physical damage, spells can still be cast on you.
---
You still however can interrupt other players spell casting with any shield/protection in. You just can do physical damage when Blessing of Protection is cast on yourself.
---
Hope this helps.
---
i don't get the part with the tower of azora... did e-rp go down there regularly or something?
---
Would that even work with Stormstrike?
---
"Spells" generally doesn't count melee instant attacks, does it?
---
Why is nobody bringing up Engineering in here? Pretty much solves a lot of their mobility issues. And after all, its the player not the class that makes it good.
---
2h fury is a stronger 1v1 class vs nonhealers, as they simply output more dmg through deathwish and flurry, whilst also having the imp shout for rogues and imp intercept for a 20-15 cd, which is very useful, and whilst the imp hs can help you beat certain classes, this when calced for its low procrate is as useful or less than the higher dps and imp int. Also you shit on other arms warrs due to this as you can for the most part hs kite and get in 2 hits to their 1 hit done correctly due to your as speed.
---
Stormstrike doesn't deal nature damage, it increases the damage nature spells do. So it would work in conjunction with elemental spells
---
I see what you did there. BS = Skeleton key / Scholo Key = Skeleton Key. HAHA!OH! 
---
Work work
---
Eh, shaman really only has ghost wolf, and that isnt very useful without the talent in enhancement
---
The air space above Eastern Kingdoms has been blocked by volcanic ash from Blackrock Mou...
---
or nevermind, hordies again killed the flightmaster
---
I has to be this. The sheer survivability is absolutely disgusting.
---
Facebook memes
---
What streamer
---
Ah, so you mean for getting bigger earth shock crits after stormstrike?
---
Hmm, sounds kinda meh to me. You're not gonna be rocking much spell crit as an enhancement shaman.
---
Hawkwind maaaan!  :D
---
Not so fast, how about SL Ruin.  can you imagine Drakedog with SL, althoufh i believe he went deeper into Destro. still.
---
Shamans and paladins will be up close to warriors and mages, those are the most popular ones I think
---
What is so important about clearing content so fast?? It’s not going anywhere??
---
Ayy surprised someone noticed, let alone knew who they were
---
Thank you, was wondering
---
"of the Wolf" = for hunters
---
of the Boar could be for paladins?
---
60-80 people plus whatever was already on that shard could end up being a total pop of 300+ people. We know that 40/40 PvP battlegrounds work without issue, those would clearly be a single shard. 
---
Really seems like the 120+ range is where stuff goes wonky and as many have explained that’s less about server infrastructure and more about your own WoW client and the amount of incoming data. Without spell batching there’s substantially more i/o required per player around you, since spell data is essentially steaming real time, instead of batched. 
---
As is I never saw more than 40 or so people in the barrens, ever, in Vanilla. So if they had sharding there it wouldn’t be the end of the world. It would just make Classic more like Vanilla and I’m basically 100% ok with having an authentic experience like that. 
---
Looks great to me bud, good work!
---
I swear I could sit and look at maps like this for hours.  When I was still very new, level 10 or so, I spent *so long* trying to get to that little unmarked area west of Tirisfal Glades, but never found a way over the mountains.  To this day looking at it on a map still taunts me... just that big gap of nothingness.  What secrets is it hiding?
---
It can be pretty relaxing. Listen to some old jams, kill things...
---
Priest for pure survivability for pvp and ease in groups/raids.
---
Shaman for more offense, utility, and variable play styles.
---
LÖL
---
I've spent so long there, grinding that monkeys for their un'goto soil
---
and all that trips to Tanaris to get that mithril casing for your partymates
---
If I play alliance I would go dwarf priest. Not only do they have magnificent beards, Priest is in dungeons super fun and that fear ward is op. 
---
But I would need to twink a rogue. Can't live in classic without stealth. The skill opens up a whole new world. 
---
On horde side I would go druid. Not only tons of versatility. I also like them more in bg. I can heal, I have my stealth. Just overall a super underrated class. 
---
I will choose a side when I find the perfect guild. Or go solo horde. 
---
Retail can't handle 100 people in the same shard and you want them to make a 10k cap?
---
It was at the very end of Vanilla and game ruining.
---
People downvote everything, doesn't matter if its private server or not. 
---
Is the keyquest so hard? i remember only many people havent keys. In classic this is one of my first things. making all pre quests and try to get all keys.
---
No, the worst thing I hate is pig shit
---
And the fact, that no shower or bath will clean you afterwards
---
R14 gear was intended to be the best pvp gear all of Vanilla, according to the Vanilla devs.
---
He didn't try or tried on a dead server.
---
Literally only two ways someone couldn't accomplish getting on a private server.
---
Month 1:
---
25% Druids, 50% of them balance
---
Month 10:
---
3% Druids, 0% of them balance
---
You're the type of naxx geared dragonslayer who I kill over and over 2vs6 and laugh at.
---
New servers will start just like they did back then.
---
But will progress through patches/"stages".
---
PvP is the entire game, Vanilla has no PvE content or fun PvE class design.
---
:(
---
It's all about the survivability of the healer. If you're fighting a Warrior-healer combo and you're trying to kill the Warrior first... you've already lost.
---
&gt;the problem is that Naxx kinda devalues a lot of gear just like TBC
---
but still you have to go through previous tiers, as naxx is not that easy to just hit 60 and get there.
---
&gt; I like the late MC to mid BWL era the best 
---
definitely early AQ for me, from the pre-material-collection, to first few weeks into the raid

Unless your the guy that found it for like $20
---
I remember leveling my first druid to lvl 10. Died while doing the bearform quest and it stated "failed" in the quest log. I thought it was permanent so I logged out deleted the druid and made a new one. Thank God I didn't die the second time around. 
---
Bruh you have no idea.  I live in the middle of NC.  If I travel ~1 hour east I hit Smithfield, and the entirety of the eastern third of the state just smells like pig farm.  Not even kidding, it was [kinda a big deal](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/smithfield-foods-ordered-to-pay-473-5m-for-pig-stench/) a while back.
---
Dude that's what I hope for. I'll just take a week off when Classic hits and I'll play shit out of it like during the good old days.
---
Me not that kind of Orc
---
Yup. The entire leveling process I usually grind the shit out of maybe 20 or so levels just strait grinding. 
---
I never have any issues with gold, by the time I hit 60 I usually have enough money to cover all my pre raid BIS items+ being really close to epic mount money as well. I'll farm mobs that I know either have good vendor trash or items that sell well on the AH. Yes it's a bit slower, but not having to worry about gold is a huge benefit. 
---
You should take the sickness and go back east then, huh? Or perhaps you should have bubble-hearthed right when you knew the fight was lost ;)
---
I am not a computer expert, but I would assume it has something to do with the improved effects/graphics and more scripted content in general. 
---
But what I do know is that some fucking amateurs managed to do it on their own budget, so why the fuck shouldn't blizzard be able to?
---
And I want them to make a 20k cap, Nostalrius was like 15k and it was beatiful and felt so much more alive than retail wow ever did. But they also had some custom feature to compensate, like dynamic respawn rates. While Blizzard will fuck the game up with sharding instead.
---
Haha nice, yeah druids are superficially very attractive. 
---
Awesome work
---
Gorgeous! If ya make a poster of it I’ll throw money at you
---
I realise this is one of the most asked questions... but I really don’t know what to play :(.
---
So far, I managed to decide I’ll be playing Horde. If you would be so kind, could you please tell me what class you will be playing and why?
---
Thank you so much for reading. I’m an absolute noob, but I’m extremely excited for classic!
---
The problem isn't graphics. The problem is that WoW during Vanilla handled had a specific server structure designed to support a ton of people. But over time that evolved into a server structure designed to support many small shards of small amounts of people. 
---
It could be very difficult to revert to that old structure while keeping the modern client. 
---
It’s funny because technically these things are useless! Expect maybe a mousepad from cataclysm edition! :)
---
Onyxia Wipe Animation

FIFTY DKP MINUS
---
Found this https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Western_Tirisfal_Glades
---
how long would his beard be?
---
&gt; this should ONLY happen if there are servers that remain strictly classic with no changes as well 
---
Agreed. So-called fresh servers.
---
Throwing $2300 at useless shit would be great!
---
Majors could get presence of mind / arcane power and ice block which would be really powerful.
---
Classic and Vanilla should be 2 different entities.  Vanilla is gone.  Classic is now.  If you were an original Vanilla player, you should retain your perks and they should remain unique.  Classic doesn't automatically put you in a time machine.  Achievements in your profile should fall under "Classic"  not "Legacy" or whatever it is.  Reach rank 14?  Great!  It should fall under "Classic".
---
Frankly, I see all this talk of "fair, not fair, i want what they had back in the day, etc" eerily reminiscent of what started the path of what retail is today.  Exclusivity was a part of Vanilla.  If you can't deal with that, do you really want Classic?
---
&gt; the price of these kind of things only goes up
---
Not necessarily. That is dependent on demand for it going up as time goes up. Take sports cards for instance, my dad and I collected for many years thinking it'd be great money down the road. Mark McGuire rookie cards, Steve Young rookie cards, Montana, etc. Outside of a select few, the last time I checked the value of them has really done diddley squat.
---
There's a reason SL/SL was so damn good/popular in pvp in BC. You didn't do nearly as much damage as other warlock specs, but my god, were you tanky in BGs. 
---
Before anyone on this subreddit types “Can we get classic wow class balance” they need to watch this video
---
I am sure they could figure it out if they want to. I would be extremly disappointed if they keep the low-pop servers as Azeroth (only vanilla, not TBC, not Wrath or any other expansion except maybe Cata) just flourishes so much more with massive populations due to how spread out people are.
---
You have the stereotypes of vanilla which was probably true back in the day where you had 1-2 raiding guilds per server, and you had to spend hours looking to form groups for dungeons or elite quests etc. And basically both of those issues are solved with a bigger population where you can always be active, always progress and the world is always alive in every zone.
---
Like an actual MMORPG.
---
I thought rogues sucked because after a while they did no damage.  No one told me I had to repair my weapon.
---
Great collection :)
---
BTW: It's good that pandaria is still in foil - there is no reason at all to open it and play ;)
---
hmm, Law of Attraction
---
Thats acid
---
WoW does have a nice rhythm to it that makes it fun to play, just on a base leve. Some activies/classes are more fun than others but its not hard to just get in a groove and kill time. I don't have much tolerance for things that feel tedious so its pretty impressive that grinding in WoW doesn't bore me out.
---
GM gonna be so random with all the known contenders getting vote kicked
---
Not necessarily the case for D2. Some pieces of rogue D2 are better than prebis for example. I would suggest learning your classes stat weights/priorities and then looking at prebis vs dungeon set stats. It's not that complicated once you understand what each stat does.
---
So have you tried EVE online?
---
Lol true
---
Kids these should go back to Fortnite. I don’t have time to deal with noobs now that I am an adult and can in no way relate to them or their way of playing.
---
I thought my feign death would actually make other players think I was dead. Then they continued attacking me and I got angry because this stupid ability obviously doesn't work.
---
They are useless, but for a collector like me they are worth alot!
---
If more of my friends played it I probably would have loved that game!
---
Hahaha that’s amazing!! Beats my one of running on the tram lines to IF... I thought it was ‘horde land’ bless 13 year old me
---
Haha oh my I remember doing this around the same level, I’d keep getting 2 meters further each time 
---
Its listed as a MoP patch on the wow wiki, and its called 5 (FIVE, not four) .0X. Its a part of MoP, not Cata.
---
I will be maining a Warrior and leveling a variety of other classes at the same time off of rested XP, as leveling and farming is probably my favorite part of WoW!  Very rough tier list and reasonings behind them:
---
* Warrior - Main, want to tank at 60  
---
* Mage/Hunter/Warlock - first Alt(s) I want to have a speedier and more relaxed leveling experience than I did leveling my Warrior.  Also farming at 60 with a Mage or Hunter seems nice.  
---
* Shaman/Rogue/Druid - Shaman will be what I'd like to heal as at 60, and I'll probably only play my Druid with my wife whenever she plays.  Rogue would be higher, but I played a Rogue almost exclusively for like 5 years back in the day.  
---
* Priest - I have the least interest in Priest, personally.  I'd rather Shaman heal.
---
Wait, what’s the difference between classic and vanilla?
---
You are assuming it is going to be current retail system. Not the wrath system they directly referred to during the Blizzcon presentation. Ion directly referred stop players from using the "oops didn't mean to click that" excuse. If it going to be greed/pass only then don't bother having it since that is a minority of the loot issues. "Misclick" needs or wrong ML are the majority of loot GM tickets.
---
Why though?  Its not like its a top notch phone worth using.  Its just wealthy people swinging their dicks around over who can piss away the most money on worthless shit.
---
Something like a WoW CE is cool because of all the shit that comes with it (if you're willing to break that factory seal).  A 12 year old first gen smartphone?  Big whoop, whats it gonna do, sit on your mantle?  Its not like it has a code in the box that gives you a dope homescreen on your current gen phone or something.
---
Then it also doesn't make sense to put it in at all, if the idea is to transfer items that someone needed on by mistake.
---
They could definitely figure it out, the problem is that Classic isn't exactly expected to be a massive profit. The only way they can justify it is to keep costs low. If would take 2-3 years to rebuild old servers then they just wouldn't make Classic at all. 
---
I can only see a thumbnail-sized image of your map. Do you have a link to a higher-resolution version? It looks like it's really well done and I'd love to get a closer look.
---
That's a great trio. Spec the priest for shadow and you're good to go. 
---
Time can be traded for money, but money cannot be traded for time.
---
Abit harsh on the "rogue will be pointless" statement. Warriors sure are the de facto dps masters but  rogues aren't far behind and there are other reasons to play a specific class anyway.
---
Besides, I myself are gonna stand there with a grin on my face when all the 20+ Fury warriors and rogues tear each other apart over who gets what in MC when that one piece of weapon finally drops.
---
If you run a prot pally with a priest and a decent aoe dps class you could probably aoe pull pretty much every questing area. 
---
You’ll also have the rarest portion of the group for dungeons.

Vanilla is the "back in the day" servers, up to the release of TBC.  Classic is the upcoming rerelease of servers designed to emulate Vanilla.
---
Ah sorry, thanks! 
---
Lots of things about vanilla were bad, I agree. Let's change them!
---
Classic WoW was out 14 years ago, its not like their servers have the exact same limitations now as they did back then.
---
You might be more technical than me, if private servers can fund it out of their own pockets then there is no way that a multi-billion dollar company blizzard can't do the same.
---
And they said they would drop out sharding eventually (they probably won't) so from my perspective it seems like they will have to make that change anyways.
---
Reminds me of illegal Danish 2: escape grom org, the Figur Scene with thrall, when Thrall select a Character.. Thrall!! 😂 best Moment 
---
Hmm.
---
Can't present any evidence.
---
Can't present a logical argument.
---
Can only randomly capitalise and thinks that is good enough.
---
Found the pirate server player?
---
Games should be played, not collected.
---
Submitted a ticket because my blessing of freedom didn't stop polymorph.  Granted those were frustrating times early on as a paladin when literally every class could just run away.
---
I didn’t really appreciate the relaxing nature of Grindy games when I was younger. It actually kind of annoyed me in wow when I was a kid. Now I look forward to farming with some music or a tv show running in the background. 
---
Having a class dilemma.  I mained hunter in vanilla and absolutely loved how they performed in world pvp and solo que BGs easily topping the kill list and staying very low on the death list. This time around I kind of want to try something different and fully experience the vanilla PVE as well as PvP.  I dont mind tanking and like fast forming groups so I'm leaning warrior.  But I'm worried I will get frustrated with warrior in pvp due to their lack of survivability and poor performance without a pocket healer until well geared.  
---
Also considering warlock because that was the only class I had trouble with on my hunter back in the day and I like their tier sets and the class overall has some fantasy appeal.   But again not sure how they perform until well geared and everyone talks about what a pain it is to farm soul shards tho that doesn't really seem like a big deal tbh.
---
Mage is on the list too because they seem to have great outplay potential in pvp, good PVE farm, look like fun on raids, and the ports and summon water etc.  I'd like to explore the world of mage aoe farming too.  But I remember how fun and easy it was to wreck mages on my hunter in battle grounds so I don't know if I would enjoy the mage if the opposing faction is hunter heavy. 
---
Any insight? How are warriors, locks, and mages in battle grounds around early release for pservers?  At what point do locks turn into unstoppable 1v1ers?  Are mages still as squishy as I remember (blowing up to an unseen aimedshot + multishot crit) or do they become less susceptible to burst with better gear and if so when? BWL? AQ? Naxx?
---
&gt; Having super high mitigation actually reduced threat generation, which is why my guild's MT sucked ass holding aggro,
---
That's when you tank with no pants on.
---
Lol, I had a bug where I died in burning steppes but my ghost appeared at the graveyard outside of STV.  On principle I decided I'd run back to my corpse rather than take rez sickness.  About 30 minutes later I used the unstuck feature and took rez sickness.
---
That'll do it
---
BfA is also after vanilla, no changes?
---
yep and I'll quit again.
---
UBRS groups without a seal :) fun times
---
Warrior plus Paladin is one of the strongest combos in game with very nice leveling and long term perspective (Unless he has a ret dream).
---
Regarding the last slot - I would say a mage would fit the best, everyone loves free food, portals, CC and AoE capabilities, moreover it's a very new-player friendly class.
---
I used to spend hours and hours doing those loops around Un'goro for the thorium nodes...get some music to jam to, shoot the shit w/friends, mess with the devilsaur mafia a bit, help guildies w/ quests, toss my haul on the AH and make some serious $$$...man those were awesome times. I can't wait to see if it still holds the same magic for me!
---
Because they won't suck like they did in 1.1 for PvP and they won't suck in PVE due to 16 debuffs and the shadow priest debuff. Locks will be = to mage dmg and might actually surpass them in tier 2 with hit.
---
1.12 locks are about as strong a class as there is in the game in every facet. Gold farming, leveling ease and speed, 1 v 1, world pvp, 2 v 1  ,bg dmg. They can also do a lot of things with one spec and not have to respec. Mages can't Mages are still a great class but expect to see TBC representation of locks and not 1.1 vanilla where no one played them. 
---
It's a myth because fire res is not required. I dont see why you would try and make this about private servers as if there is some major difference between vanilla and private servers that suddenly means you dont need FR on the entire raid, and somehow this went unnoticed for ten years.
---
Your post is an attempt to shit on pservers, plain and simple.
---
I was just curious because I had heard rumors that sor dps builds don't function properly on true to vanilla servers and there isn't much info to actually verify anything out there. 
---
Something very close to this:
---
1. Warrior.
---
2. Rogue.
---
3. Mage.
---
4. Hunter.
---
5. Warlock.
---
6. Priest.
---
7. Paladin.
---
8. Druid.
---
9. Shaman.
---
oh come on. As if you and 39 other people weren't thinking "I hope my T1 pants drop today" 
---
;-)
---
Collectors.
---
I see you were affected as well! I am so sorry my rumor emotionally struck you
---
You already nailed the best single variable to optimize over:
---
&gt; don’t want to fight over loot. 
---
Accomplish this and it's basically impossible to have a bad trio.
---
Secondary to that trying to get a tank and healer within the trio will make dungeon groups a snap. Though a Pally kind of forces your hand on this account depending on their preferences.
---
Given the flexibility I'd look for trying to bring in some nice QoL perks in the party. Mages with ports and conjure food/water is the biggest in my mind.
---
More money than sense.
---
Heh, all these suckers in this thread I'm here sitting on my Beanie Baby retirement fund all comfortable like.
---
There's a lot wrong with those lists, Things like recommending Flurry Axe to Warriors and recommending shaman sets with more than 150 less healing than actual BiS
---
Not really, warriors are actually pretty squishy and healers can be poly’d or feared or silenced. If you try to cc the warrior the healer can just dispel it.
---
Because no one cares about sub par private server players, if you’ve seen the vods of Monkeynews playing retail before he removed them you’d realize he’s nothing but a 1.8k player, gonna be hilarious to see these people face actual good retail players when classic is released.
---
so, what's the monetization scheme gonna be for this?
---
do I need to buy WoW again? is there a sub? 
---
starting to get really excited for this. my friend got me into WoW back in vanilla and I played on and off for years, but haven't touched the last two expansions. 
---
Priest is most fun, pally is most consistent, Druid is trash in vanilla (unfortunately), and shaman is pretty faceroll. 
---
I'm partial to priest 
---
Collectors item 
---
I was that hunter everyone later made jokes about, running around with all kinds of weapons/gear when leveling, just because they looked cool, not knowing anything about what stats to pick.
---
Man, being a complete noob in such a huge universe was an amazing feeling.
---
Check back into my channel a few months into Classic's launch and I'll have some real numbers for you :) 
---
That's an awesome spreadsheet. Are there comparable ones for warlocks or warriors?
---
DURR DURR DURR BETTER NOT RELEASE AQ OR NAXX CUS IT WILL KILL DA WARSONG GULCH
---
Watch out, there's drool on your keyboard
---
Clearing naxx isn't hard - guy who never cleared naxx but watched a youtube video about how it was mostly matts farming
---
Great take buddy real glad you're sharing your opinion on this, thanks for enriching the forum
---
&gt; It's a myth because fire res is not required.
---
Okay. Where is your evidence? You repeating it over and over is not evidence.
---
&gt; I dont see why you would try and make this about private servers as if there is some major difference between vanilla and private servers that suddenly means you dont need FR on the entire raid,
---
Well yes, that's exactly the issue. I've never seen Rag on a pirate server, but I saw Rag in real retail vanilla as a healer. And I've seen people claim that pirate servers get Rag's fire damage wrong which makes the fight ezmode.
---
Which lines up with the fact that nobody thought you could kill retail Rag in greens with zero fire resist, but it's common knowledge that pirate Rag is easy to kill that way.
---
So do you have any evidence anyone in real retail vanilla ever killed Rag with no FR on the raid, wearing greens?
---
&gt; and somehow this went unnoticed for ten years.
---
It's obviously not unnoticed if we're talking about it.
---
&gt; Your post is an attempt to shit on pservers, plain and simple. Like everyone else around here.
---
Oh, you poor little snowflake. You're in a circlejerk where anyone who says anything bad about pirate servers gets downvoted and you *still* feel like a persecuted victim.
---
Levelling lockpicking to pick doors, lol plebs. *This post brought to you by the suicide gang*
---
transmog
---
micro transactions
---
I was contemplating testing some stuff out also. My main intention is to heal but I would be interested to do a little testing to see what exactly you could get out of a dps paladin. 
---
Just need the flight masters location and it's perfect :)
---
I'm 17 and started playing WoW December 2011. I tried Vanilla on a pserver and I'm really really really hyped for Classic :D
---
And to elaborate on that, specifically NOT 3/3 imp blizzard because your cone of cold slow will be weaker than blizzard and not debuff the mobs.
---
Some people are just toxic, and like the old saying goes, "misery loves company", so they often love to force their misery on others. I just try my best to identify them asap and remove them from my gaming reality.../ignore can do wonders for keeping the toxicity from ruining your enjoyment of the game.
---
A mindset/test I often hold myself to is: "If I meet an asshole in the morning, and that's it, then I probably just met and asshole; if I meet assholes all day long, then *I'M* probably the asshole."  If I meet an asshole in a 5 man, I just roll with it and accept that it's Life; if I start meeting assholes all the time in a guild or a group or raid, then I know it's time to bail, because I'm just not compatible with their shared idea of how to play the game and *I'm* toxic to *them*. Just separate yourself and find others with like mindsets :)
---
Yep, I like to farm. I put on some good audio-book and I'm good to go. It's almost like meditation after a stressful day at work.
---
Makes me all relaxed and chilled. And of course I have the typical RPG syndrome of just storing everything I find. I always got that feeling of: "someday, someone will need this item."
---
Another emotionally struck snowflake, how cute. How could someone possibly say classic could be canceled! haha you nerds are pathetic. Your emotional capacity is so low you are triggered from a rumor so you tell someone not to play. Poor baby, I hope blizz releases soothers for all you man children
---
There's a reason my vanilla guild called me the handy dandy walking talking lock pick on my rogue, they'd always forget about keys...
---
Weapons not so much, but they are sure going to battle to the death for the Band of Accuria.
---
That almost tickles my old Rogue senses. If I wasn't so dead set on healing, I would go Rogue. Any day.
---
&gt; if you’ve seen the vods of Monkeynews playing retail before he removed them you’d realize he’s nothing but a 1.8k player
---
Holy moly, the desperation in this subreddit about discrediting everything private server related is bordering on hysterical. You are talking about a game that is 13 years removed from Vanilla. Effectively you are saying Player X is shit at game Y, because he he was not a top notch player in Game Z.
---
You are making absolutely no logical sense.
---
Will be a Orc warrior. Won't have that problem. That is for the people who play Alliance because they need easy mode raiding. I can dps with slam 2 hander due to windfury, BWL 1h Axes &gt; Swords and because people suck at 2h slam dps I will get Ashkandi and blow people up in 3 globals while people cry about 10 minutes of cooldowns and minute long encounters with rogues that can be countered with a consumable, the dwarf or orc racial or tagging a mob to prevent the blind and on an on. People who are stupid enough to actually believe the world of roguecraft propaganda video are in for a big surprise. All but a SMALL number of hipsters on rogue rerolled to warrior after Nost (and the rerollers instantly became most of the best warriors) and that's because they don't rank or anything because rogues are garbage in everything but WSG sitting on a druid and the control/duel spec isn't really gear dependent anyways. You either have cooldowns or you don't against many classes. The hipsters sit there and duel all day when those duels mean nothing because Vanilla PvP is about consumables and trinkets that are all known commodities now and that are actually used in pvp. People don't trinket the cheapshot anymore...
---
Rogues do one thing better than warriors. They are better at 1 v 1 before tier 2. They are worse in every other facet of the game and have no utility. Also warriors don't invite rogues pre raid bis to get gear because they want the same gear due to hit and dual wielding. Rogues are a nightmare to gear in 1.12  If there was a payoff it would be fine. There is no payoff. I would rather play a druid over a rogue. if I had to play stealth. Just as strong 1 v 1/worldpvp and good at other things.
---
Ok.
---
Should I unbind S? I use it sometimes :shrug: I've been 2400+ in 2s/3s back in TBC/WotlK with occasional use :/ 
---
And how many of us accidentally clicked on the wrong flight master
---
Just go druid. druid is as good 1 v 1 and in world pvp/duels. Offset is easy. Heck a DM quest item that will be in at launch is better than the rank 14 weapon for dmg on a druid. Druids are very strong in 1.12. Most people that play them are just awful.
---
If the idea is to settle intra-raid looting issues, then the window doesn't need to be 2 hours, which seems to just increase the possibility of ninja looting.
---

What's with the "white pride worldwide" button?
---
Theres a difference though. That was from a time when Topps really fucked up. They produced WAY more product than was in demand, and effectively tanked the market. 
---
Glad you agree! baby steps at a time
---
No :)
---
The TBC patch in vanilla is also listed as 2.0X that's how they always do it
---
This just seems like someone who figures that they will never see max gear and doesn't want people to have better gear than them. 
---
A lot of people here are saying that you can clear all content, just slower, and I think they are misleading you to a degree. There are some bosses that are designed as dps checks. Vael being the famous early one. There is a reason he was known as the guild breaker. Guilds that were too casual, and too lax on spec, composition, and consume requirements could not beat him. For every "meme" spec you bring someone else has to make up that dps. It's no different than bringing less than 40 players.  There is a point at which it can't be done. After bwl it only gets worse. Bosses in aq get incredibly difficult the longer the fight lasts. Same with naxx and it has at least 4 dps check bosses. It's totally possible a handful of these hybrids can make it through all content, but it's because they are being carried by a good guild. With the exception of a feral druid, they do have a niche role so you could see one in a raid through progression. The vast majority will end up respecing or stuck at some point in progression watching their guild implode. 
---
&gt;Which lines up with the fact that nobody thought you could kill retail Rag in greens with zero fire resist, but it's common knowledge that pirate Rag is easy to kill that way.
---
&gt; So do you have any evidence anyone in real retail vanilla ever killed Rag with no FR on the raid, wearing greens? 
---
You are displaying an incredible level of dishonesty in your post, but I expected nobody else from a fanatic. First of, nobody ever claimed Ragnaros in full greens is easy. Literally nobody. This is a strawman that you use because it's easier than to argue against my actual claims.
---
Secondly, you KNOW there is no proof that anyone killed Rag in Vanilla wearing greens and no fire res. You are taking a riddiculous extreme and asking me to provide proof of this, as if my inabiltiy to do so somehow invalidates my argument.
---
What IS known, is exactly how much damage each of Ragnaros abilities does and often they are used. We also know exactly how much HP you get from stamina in Vanilla, and the information about what kind of items it is possible to get before you enter Molten Core is easily available to anyone. Fact is none of the abilities used by Ragnaros does nearly enough damage to kill anyone before the healers are able to heal them back up. The biggest difference between todays meta and back then is that every healer in the raid is sitting at 500+ bonus healing instead of having stacked intellect gear and the dungeon sets. This makes a world of difference when it comes to healing, as you can just downrank endlessly with major mana potion and dark runes and literally never run out of mana.
---
&gt; Oh, you poor little snowflake. You're in a circlejerk where anyone who says anything bad about pirate servers gets downvoted and you *still* feel like a persecuted victim. 
---
Nice personal attack here. I suppose the cognitive dissonance of Vanilla not being as difficult as you remember might have been too much for you to handle, hence the complete lack of any arguments.
---
I'd love a classic wow map poster, been looking for a long time.
---
Well...yes.
---
But it seems to be a common trend that pvp is wildly inbalanced once naxx geared players are involved.
---
Shit my guild didn’t use consumables at all expect flasks and we killed KT. And not even everyone used them, just the tanks. 
---
I'm 14 and have been playing since bc, too young to remember most of the gameplay so I want to see what I missed out on 
---
Naxx gear is already only slightly better than AQ gear, there's a bunch of pieces from even BWL that remain BiS forever, it's not as simple as you imagine.
---
Or maybe you should go look up the definition of PvP instead of whining and crying.
---
Leveling druid as feral and putting talents into balance spec.
---
Well that's what I plan on doing, right now. Although I'm going on a PvE Server, I want to hit the BG very hard this time. Druid felt great on an instant LvL 60 Server. Heal, run, dots everywhere with stealth. It was just great.
---
elemental mastery gives your next spell a 100% crit chance
---
Druid is really good at certain things.  Being able to completely neutralize a melee class has to count for something.  
---
It could have been written better but he meant:
---
get a rogue [to lockpick]
---
or
---
someone to suicide next to the door.
---
All you need is an active WoW sub and you can play Classic!
---
This sub itself is already a vocal minority, and min/maxers are a further out subset of that vocal minority so your point is (I hope) well received!
---
So raid Naxx and help balance pvp?
---
What? No! Better wait for WC4.
---
You can just buy the key at the Alliance flight master... was it 50G?
---
That would only affect Topps cards pricing, not the rarer ones. Different companies always had different prices in the hobby, and I don't recall many Topps cards being collectible. Even among rookie cards certain ones were more desirable than others and we always made sure to collect the ones that were more limited.
---
Didn't matter, last I checked, all of the prices hadn't gained anything.

I wish WoW had farming. It was the profession I put the most work into in Lord of the Rings Online. Growing tea, coffee, and pipeweed in the fields of the Shire. Cooking lamb with mint sauce for easy gold on the action house. Those were the days
---
You don’t open it. Neither de WoW CE or original iPhone.

I probably shouldn't be doing this but oh well.

We're going to get some interesting news from the team during the second week of March.

With weapons bought from the vendor, And gear bought from the vendor.
---
Cyberpunk, Bannerlord and FF7R too please.
---
Better idea. Make sure Classic lasts as long as real Vanilla did and make sure there is time between raids. Full Naxx gear is only a problem for a VERY small time frame if Blizzard copies the original release structure. If they try to turn vanilla into a 1 year game? The entire thing breaks. Don't worry about Naxx. The entire thing would fail in a matter of months because hardcore players would have a gear edge they never had in real vanilla for a year and a half.
---
Naxx is still not going to be cleared a lot. Has nothing to do with mechanics. Has to do with farming. AQ raiding starts to cost money. Naxx is costs a metric crap ton of money, especially if you are respeccing for pve/pvp, which is 100 gold a week.
---
People want additions to Vanilla or rebalancing. Forget that. If Classic is wildly successful (and it will if they do it right) then Blizzard can make WoW 2 or do a soft reboot of WoW and if they don't, someone else will. They will know a year in, they can start developing it. Another 2 years and they can release something polished.
---
Screw TBC and screw trying to fix something that wasn't meant to be the end of WoW (NaxX). TBC is garbage. Bg's are made pointless, arena causes homogenization and an impossible attempt at balance. Small raids do the same. The world is completely dead and there is no WPVP.
---
Play Classic first and think about what makes it great before you ask for other things. A lot of you are going to realize that TBC sucks to.
---
Never played vanilla. Lovee tbc tho
---
this is the real conspiracy theory
---
Honestly I'm a no changes guy who wants a history peice for the classic servers. As it was.
---
However.
---
If they're planning on new horizontal content expansions following classic then naxx does raise the bar very high in terms of inflation. 
---
That's not what I want tho. I want Classic, TBC, and Wrath.
---
JUTY
---
I prey you are wrong, I miss the sense of community and the getting to know people on the server.
---
Until you run into a Warlock and they resist 5 MBs in a row and are probably literally LOLing at you on the other side of the monitor 
---
Thank you so much for your reply! So your warrior will be your nr.1 main? That sounds cool man!
---
What faction/race will you be rolling?
---
Also I’ve been looking into shamans, they seem so fun. Plus the added bonus of wolf form seems really, really cool and convenient!
---
Thank you again for your detailed reply brother!
---
It's true! They seem lackluster at big heals but they are maneuverable, great at kiting/survivability, good for flag running, can pounce+roots for big cc. Just not fat tiddy heals. 
---
If you are comfortable using a lot of buttons and are a pretty strong player this. Pure resto shamans are bad in vanilla and the best way to play shaman as a healer in PvP is the idea that "the best defense is a good offense".
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVzez0xo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzVfMqZZVzez0xo)
---
Go tauren or orc. When melee sit on you drop a fire nova totem use the tauren racial or iron grenade and a chain lightning and the warrior uses sweeping strikes. People will explode. When they don't sit on you try to conserve mana with level 1 eshocks, nuke with lightning which is pretty efficient on mana and throw heals on the warriors and make sure they have windfury and use tremor, grounding when needed.
---
On Alliance the answer is simply Holy Paladins. Horde is offensive, Alliance is defensive. That is the big difference in flavor of the factions.
---
20k paper weight.  Completely worthless.  Even opening the old phone is worthless, at least the CE has value if you open it for the pet/item codes.
---
Its literally just wealthy people swinging their dicks around, nothing more.
---
Not sure why you're attacking me when I mostly agreed with you.  You know nothing about me and making claims about me with no information, then sarcastically claiming that I'm "enriching the forum".. that's quite a bit of irony my friend.  You need to get real and admit that naxx is a time investment more than a skill check.  You literally said that people are "not good enough" to get naxx gear, and all I said was that being good has little to do with it.  If you can no life it, you can do it.  Easy as that.
---
Your posts have all been extremely negative and attacking the people posting here, so maybe you should calm down a bit and then you can join me in "enriching the forum".  If all you want to do is make personal attacks, make claims you obviously have no idea about while accusing someone else of the contrary, and sarcastically spewing vitriol maybe you should just stop coming here.

And you say that with the experience of a 2200 ranked player in TBC?
---
WoW died in 2009.
---
Huh. Well, thanks for the answer! Appreciate it!
---
But instant Starfire
---
Why I don't agree with nerfing naxx gear some just don't have the time to get to and raid naxx. God I'd love to be a part of that instance and dive into it since my guild in vanilla was pretty casual so only had just had BWL on farm. But due to real life responsibilities it just won't happen. I'll just have to watch some streaming and be jelly. 
---
That's ok, priests can lol at the warlock after they resist 5 fears in a row as well. They both have 60 shadow resist. The main difference is a shadow priest gets a very easy +10% spell hit from spells while a warlock gets none.
---
To some degree yes. That's your reward for spending hundreds/thousands of hours building a character :) Classic rewards time investment. And the time needed to get the level of gear you're talking about is huge. Only the top few percent of people will get there.
---
Killing yourself to opwn doors, lol plebs. *This post is brought to you by the key questing gang*
---
Warriors with deathwish and mortal strike. 
---
missing the horde fp from Shadowprey Village to Camp Mojache.
---
I took that many times because going from TB &gt; Shadowprey &gt; Camp M was about twice as fast as TB &gt; Camp M.
---
There isn’t a single spec that “isn’t viable”. Gear and class knowledge are what matters. You’ll never fail an encounter because someone had “the wrong spec”.  
---
The “best” and “most efficient” spec is a different discussion.
---
I was thinking the same thing but with shaman above druids hehe
---
I really hope we get new servers every now and then, but unfortunately I doubt it'll happen more than once, if that.
---
But isnt the journey to 60 then getting geared enjoyable most steps of the way?
---
"majors" .. lol
---
When did they introduce the tooltip telling you whose loot the corpse was?
---
I agree with you. I find questing an alt or farming rep/reagents/lvling profession etc SO relaxing. Its really nice to just throw up a playlist of one of my favorite sitcomes on the side monitors and just zone out and slowly progress at the same time. 
---
None. 
---
I didn’t knew classic will be a CIV game.
---
Didnt notice that until you pointed it out, thats a little concerning
---
The old saying “anyone better than me is a no life loser and anyone worse than me is a noob”.
---
By the way its placed he definitely wanted it to be seen. Big yikes
---
This thread makes me realize how fun it would be for classic to implement event weekends or something where you get an extra talent point but only while in BGs. Could make for some fun shenanigans!
---
Well the OP wants to just collect them.
---
also unbind s.
---
no
---
Warlock can summon though
---
Mage should be considered. Presence of mind + Ice barrier, awesome for PvP.
---
Interesting posts, could you explain a bit more on why rogues are a nightmare to gear in 1.12 compared to other classes?
---
Long chain quest from what I can remember.
---
"you people"!??!?
---
I didn't use the word skill, I said it's hard, which it is. Things can be hard for a variety of reasons, several of wihch you just listed. It's annoying when people don't even reply to your comments properly and reply to them as if you've said something completely different.
---
Naw, just get a rogue to suicide next to the door
---
Basically tbc spec, where I got rank1 in 3s arena and 5s. 
---
Warlock requires 3 people to summon, so if you have to summon one of your three, it's going to be a hassle asking strangers to help.  
---
Mage is the better choice for transport.  
---
I don't know about that, I paid some guys to paint my house for me while I did something else.
---
Pretty sure you can't, right?   
---
Also he built almost full destro and played short cc's into full burst, which is extremely fun!

No, because EVERYTHING is saturated in the market. 88-97 baseball is virtually worthless because there are warehouses and warehouses of product that isn't even worth the paper it's printed on for the vast majority of it.
---
I used too farm 3-4 hours a day just too raid. After I quit raiding I kept farming for some reason. Everything from ore too low level boe twink gear. Depending on my mood

Sadly Starfire is Arcane.

Instant Entangling Roots tho

Sounds to me like your paladin friend doesn't want to heal. He's going to be the drag of the group I can tell.  
---
Paladin, hunter, priest is just fine. You don't need to min/max your DPS pre-60. It's the post-60 that you should worry about.  
---
You can heal, your paladin friend can....tank if he's up to it?, and then your hunter guy needs to learn how to trap. So find a tank and a mage and do 5 man dungeons at 60 for gear.  
---
Everything before that doesn't really matter so much. If you guys get jumped in PVP, mana burn (priest) + viper sting (hunter) if you want to see most mana classes turn into a wet noodle in about 3 seconds.  
---
Definitely rolling a Tauren Warrior.  When I first played from late vanilla through early Cata, I mained a Rogue the entire time.  I got my Warrior up to 80 during late Wrath and was pretty lucky to gear him up quickly.  Fell in love with Warrior tanking in ICC and can't wait to give some more attention this time around!
---
My Shaman experience is also limited to Wrath, so I can't speak to the vanilla shaman experience very much.  As I understand it they are best as healers, though you can get by as Elemental in casual raiding and PvP.
---
Nature's swiftness only works on nature spells. Starfire is arcane.
---
Can't wait for that drama.  
---
So does this make you a ninja looter?

Prot Paladins in vanilla are so abysmally bad. A well geared Prot Paladin couldn't hold aggro on Bloodlord's raptor because a Fury Warrior cleaved+whirlwinded it. 
---
There are viable specs, there are meme specs, and there are completely useless specs. Prot Paladin fits into the last one.
---
I seen a offensive priest use holy...I was very surprised of the damage output..but I am 100% positive it was a very over geared priest with trinkets being nonstop used.
---
Some people just cannot be pleased =/
---
Pally and warrior are the obvious combo. Adding a mage I think would be ideal, but any dps really would be fine. If you want to heal you could make a priest maybe?
---
Hahahahaha ha :| good1mate
---
It's actually the go-to DPS spec for an enhancement shaman, unless you're rocking a Nightfall and playing PVE in which case you'll go for the hit rating in the resto tree instead.

I found it here from a year ago [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7rcvif/low\_effort\_meme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7rcvif/low_effort_meme/)

good maths lol

Just kind of interested what a lot of people here's experiences with Vanilla WoW are. I'm sure this has been discussed to death, but I only recently started paying any attention and so I'm kind of at hype stage 1. Did you play original Vanilla? Did you just play a bit? Do all the raids? Heavy PVP? Did you play on private servers? Only played more recent stuff and want to check out the old stuff?
---
I played vanilla from day 1 and ended up quitting towards the end of TBC. Started with a PvP focus but when it became apparent that you had to PvE to PvP I started raiding and never looked back. Mediocre guild on Horde side until we stalled at the Twin Emperors and then rerolled on the same server to join a very good Alliance guild who I finished Naxx with and then raided with in TBC.
---
16 here, been playing WoW all my life and am a little too hyped for Vanilla
---
Ruin would be better, especially for geared warlocks. Siphon life isn't very good in Vanilla compared to TBC, as it only gains 0.5 damage per point of spell damage in vanilla compared to 1 damage per point in TBC.
---
D'oh!
---
Gnome female is obviously the best version of everything.  
---
Honestly , I hope they are worthless lmao , they already are worthless as you cant even use them ? So kudos to you wasting money on something ! 
---
Idk have you tried looking for yourself?
---
Me and 2 friends this on retail vanilla. We did druid, hunter, rogue. That setup was far from optimal, but we made it work like a charm - mostly the Pet tanked, Druid did heal/dps, and then we were really careful with CC and mob order. Cleared every instance up to (and including) Sunken temple, except for a few bosses we actually had to give up. Was so much fun!
---
Naxx is when I quit the game until they (hopefully) release a new fresh start server.
---
The gear is completely overpowered and ruins PvP.
---
I'm all for gutting the hell out of this gear, even if you were to update PvP gear to be equal to it, it's still far too many stats for the game and would make PvP 1 shot fests.
---
Yeah, Naxx gear ruins PvP completely and many PvPers I've talked to said they will quit immediately after the Naxx patch due to this.
---
Oh no I won't have a 15% chance to freeze someone what would I do if PvP happens 
---
For me it was getting stuck in a high level zone and not understanding what a hearthstone was. Got one of my guildies to come bail me out and as soon as he got there I realized I could right click on the stone a return home. 
---
GM on hunter is a bit overkill tbh. Rank 13 is more than enough. ZG in classic is gonna be out with Battlegrounds, so your effectively pushing another couple of weeks of hardcore grinding for what is 18 stamina, as you can get MH &amp; OH from Hakkar that has the same 28 atp &amp; 1 crit.

dont know why but this made me laugh so hard with tears
