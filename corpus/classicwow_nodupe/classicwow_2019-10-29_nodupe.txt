Too many metasexuals who think that the fact that they read a spreadsheet built by someone else and watched a youtube video makes them an expert on the game, but have no understanding at all about how threat and aggro work. My policy is that if they want aggro so bad, I'll let them have it. I just try to keep the healer alive and don't worry too much if the DPS are eating hits, it's a self solving problem.

---
---
Isn't BfA the first expansion with no PvP servers?
---
I also noticed i suddenly had a insanely long time in my raid without crusader procs, dual wield with crusader on both weapons, then when i re equipped my weapon i suddenly started getting procs again. Classic is full of bugs still and blizzard doesnt care. They alredy got their sub money and know that the ppl still playing likely wont quit over this bug anyway
---
You fish the same spot rather than looking for nodes? Is that as fruitful? Love the Pic BTW.
---
Yes. It’s rough, but they are so fun.
---
Cool. The OG version of the death knight now. Still blows my mind to see a few DKs drop relevant raid bosses, even if really geared.
---
[deleted]
---
Wait, you can eat and drink at the same time?  I suppose you can learn something 47 levels later....
---
This has happened to me on a wyvern before.
---
I've never seen it say 75-25 the worst one I saw was 63 - 37. Do you have the data for that claim?
---
Which is only one time per minute. The ability to hit 3% more with white swings, but also yellow abilities is significantly better.
---
I'm genuinely interested in your math. How did you arrive at this?
---
It's really not bad, especially if you go alchemy and herbalism. On my warrior alt I do that and run around with tons of buffs and 3 shot mobs with pretty decent regen.
---
I main a lock in a guild farming MC and this is precisely what I do. Bank the extra few shards for the next raid and boom, I've got 50 ready to go.
---
(Wrong person)
---
This is an item that will last 2 full raid tiers and then you need to actually get the drop in AQ. For some reason I feel like the 4-5 min per run is worth it.
---
Can say as horde on Blaumeaux it’s def seemed p close to even when I’m out questing in contested/neutral zones
---
Bro why are you so angry about this, are you trying to make some kind of point? 
---

---
Yeah, Alliance is quicker, but it’s not gigantic.
---
**&lt;SFK&gt; Horde - Herod - PvP** is currently recruiting all roles for leveling and raiding, with a plan to begin raiding in late 2019. We're a group of friends who are looking to stick together while raiding. We're also looking for class leaders for a variety of roles - right now only Shaman, Warrior, and potentially Mage are covered. SFK has an experienced raid leader planning to raid Tuesday/Wednesday at 8 PM EST and Sunday afternoon/evening and we're looking to divvy up loot with a DKP system.
---
We're welcoming all players whether you're a vanilla WoW veteran or a newcomer to vanilla raiding. We'd prefer players who are closing in on 60 so we can begin raiding in around a month, but if you're lower level and you plan to stick with your character, there's a spot for you in the guild. We only require two things of our guild members: be nice to your fellow guildies and kill all gnomes on sight. A guild Discord is also on the way.
---
Private message me here on Reddit or whisper Grimka or DncingPnguin in-game for an invite or with any questions you might have.
---
Oh man. Ok. So as a Warlock, you use cloth gear. It's been a long ass time since I've played a Warlock so I don't remember their specific itemization. Cloth gear with Stamina/Intellect/Spirit would be my guess. 
---
Green gear is the best you can hope for at your level. You won't see much for greenies until around 15 when they become more common from bad guys. You can always buy some from the AH but that can be expensive as you level. Learning what instance/dungeons are and how to have fun in them is what I recommend.
---
I haven't failed once doing it that way though.
---
I'm not really sure... I wasn't paying too much attention to it. I think that someone told me level 49 quests are still green at 60. I'm trying to avoid doing 49 quests and above so I can do them after I reach 60 and get that sweet extra gold.
---
Good to know. 
---
Should I not sell linen cloth away?
---
How can I acquire new armor? I'm levell 11 and I have Fire Wand, nice spells but shit armor cant find anywhere any better :( I can't use the stuff enemies drop. Think that's why i'm having difficult time atm
---
The cheap shot thing is spellbatching mate, it really should get removed because it's utter fucking shit. 
---
The vanish bug is sometimes due to spellbatching, as in the melee attacks of the enemy lands in the same batch as your vanish and just cancels it out. As for what you are showing I'm not sure whats going on there, I'm a rogue my self and never gotten this unlucky.
---
Rogue feels SO slick when you play and so great to watch in PvP.
---
Oh how can I bott looks fun

Seems like it's not a bug

Oh shit! Glad I'm rogue then
---
If you learn the basics then warrior will be about as difficult to level as your rogue is. 
---
This is a good starter:  [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/569512059780333618/616721473331265556/PBBVRYR.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/569512059780333618/616721473331265556/PBBVRYR.png)

*Mr. Sulu, engage damage control! Act like we didn't say something dumb.*
---
I think I recognize the guy, and if I'm right, it's a guy on my realm who has been farming it pretty much constantly from 54 to 59, so while I'm not sure it's 600, it could be quite high.
---
Except go tank a strat live and go dps one. Guess which one is wayyyyyy more involved/stressful/whatever. It’s tanking. I’ll go dps Jed/Rend all day, but I can only tank a few before I need a break.
---
yo
---
&gt;You wont be using MCP every pull too
---
Why not?
---
Simply (and briefly) put, in endgame healing there are lots of damage going around and being able to cast on another target without having to first select then press a button can make the difference, especially in a raid.
---
Moving around, in pve, is something you can learn to do blind. It's learning a pattern most of the time.
---
Damage can have sudden spikes and random targets or just a dps aggroing unexpectedly.
---
Have fun on your new server!!
---
Edit: you could try consulting a GM don’t think they will do much but you never know.
---
Its the best blue 2h weapon. Unless you get lucky in MC there is nothing better.
---
It's not a big deal, I'd just keep 2 sets. Tank and heals.
---
Being able to tank BRD and upwards will get you your tank set, and you'll end up collecting healing gear along the way.
---
Once your healing set is halfway you can do either, which means you can pretty much find a group for any instance you want in under 5m.
---
Later on, you just ask healers if they are ok with you /rolling for a piece, and most are because tanks generally don't do scholo/strat that much
---
Finally some sense in this thread.
---
I've actually never seen anyone complain in an instance.  Had people just drop the group and hearth, but never any outright bitching in chat.
---
Only instants, and only once, because the action of casting the spell breaks the mind control. So for instance you can Renew, or PW:F an enemy player. But why would you want to, lol.
---
And this is something you believe is correct? You feel like blizzard designed the game to act this way and this is intentional? This spot was put into place so that you can freely attack players without worrying about the intended behavior of the guards? The guards should act this way?
---
Or do you MAYBE think blizzard made an oops? 
---
In the game =\= intentional. Ask the guys who abused layering to get ahead and the guilds who abused game mechanics during certain boss fights to clear certain hardcore raids.
---
Blizz actually added that mechanic to the "Not a bug" list earlier this evening.
---
"Some monsters have a “Thrash” mechanic and can proc multiple attacks against players in a very short duration.
---
Note: Most of these monsters can also “store” these procs and unleash them all several seconds later. An example of this is the Princess Theradras encounter in Maraudon. The Princess will store her attacks if kited and can land several attacks instantly when she catches up to her target. This behavior is consistent with the reference client"
---
While it did happen back in vanilla, i had no idea it was actually an intended feature.
---
Get ready to tank nearly every dungeon then.
---
Wow, that's a pretty good Hunter weapon
---
I get that. How do I get cloth gear, even the most basic shit available? 
---
Stamina / intellect / spirit doesn't ring a bell at this point ;/
---
I see. Do you happen to know any good guide for reading about instance/dungeons? Because I don't know anything about them. And they are group only, right?
---
Also, the patch were on added things like Spellpower to most items
---
my man
---
Vanish didn't work for the entirety of vanilla. I would submit tickets every few days crying about how mobs would attack me through it and break stealth. 
---
It may not be busted in the same exact way, but vanish being busted is Vanilla-like.
---
It was more common in TBC.  You could get a rogue up to 100% avoidance, which trivialized fights like Gruul.
---
He's  probably the warrior that lost hand of rag roll XD
---
No body:
---
Level 60 warlock: I'm packing heat all the time
---
This is very helpful, thank you so much!
---
It’s actually harder than you think to do this.
---
DAoC free shard was popular earlier this year and I played it a lot. At one point I thought it would be fun to make my way to those leveling in the frontiers and slay noobs. I ended up one shotting a few noobs and felt like a total asshole. I just couldn’t do it. I was wasting their time and mine for nothing. 
---
For someone to corpse camp and grief someone without reason, they legit gotta have a screw loose upstairs. Probably pulled wings off flies for fun.
---
This is my goal.
---
Guild goal is, by the end of classic to have me specced out in naxx gear and see if I can tank MC. 
---
We have theorycrafted it super hard, and believe with naxx gear I can do it! (Clearly, that isn't an accomplishment for any other class, but just to say a shaman tanked rag, lol)
---
Lvl 54 haven't had vanish bug happen yet
---
Hmm that’s really weird. Would’ve been nice if they’d mentioned this weeks ago lol.
---
I meant they are nature damage immune more than anything. So druids cannot farm lashers with hurricane. On private servers, they weren't. Can't remember about back in vanilla days but that's what I mean by "nerfed". The gold/hr is still pretty decent if you can kill them!
---
&gt; At 300 weapon skill you won’t miss level 60 mobs. 
---
lol no.
---
I am so goddamn excited to play BC content when it's like, populated and relevant you have no idea
---
I can confirm, I am much better at running away now
---
&gt; Our heals are slow so we get beat to the heal all the time by pally heal. I’ve seen lots of 0 of 1200 land a lot because they beat my 2.5 sec cast with there 1.5.
---
You know priests have a 1.5s flash heal too, right? For almost 2.5x as much healing as a paladin's?
---
Playing a feral tank is like playing a Hunter -- except you're the pet.
---
Sorry im not that used to professions...so you make potions(?) and those give you buffs?
---
Is Elixir of the Mongoose bugged? I heard a few people talking about how it doesn’t work right now and doesn’t show any changes in stats in the character pane. Is this true? Should I hold off on buying them until then?
---
YoUrE aN eLiTeSt BrO
---
It's worth noting that a lot more mobs have Thrash than you may think. So a lot of mobs can double/triple hit you and it being legit. But indeed, I have been hit a few times by mobs that do not have multi-hit type abilities listed on any of the database websites. Earlier today I set up my combat log to log more stuff, and hopefully see if it makes any mention of a procc on them. I'm still really not sure which one it is.
---
But you won't be getting one every hour, that's why you won't average more than 50..
---
It's a great way to burn out or to start hating an instance.
---
You can always come back for it, a little crit really isn't that big of a deal if you can do a couple runs and get half a dozen slots that will increase your damage more
---
They are all in BRD trying to get their SGC and HOJ?
---
Also, you roll either way. Always bugged me that one of the icons was dice. What does that even mean.
---
Rogue is so much fun tho
---
In Desolace, there's a strip of elevated land along the Sartheris Strand; the entrance is to the north of the road that goes out to the coast. The far end of it is where the roaming Giant, the Kodo packs (and probably Hyena packs) all spawn from, so be watchful when you're around there.
---
But its pretty hidden and not on the way to anywhere else, so nobody goes there. I was farming there and in that area around level 37ish.
---
I love exploring the World of Warcraft...and had never even known this area existed before!
---
I always sheep the hunter and kill the pet first just so he remembers not to ever attack a mage again and then deadzone him hard to finish him off
---
Yes. Because warriors want to dps
---
As a 60 warlock who raids and partakes in end game stuff, I've never felt the need to carry this many SS? All my raid has their hearth set to Kargath and for the few who fuck up and forget, well I just summon those. Maybe I'm missing something? I guess if I was so soulfire on CD then maybe I would need more shards.
---
its funny to see people mad about the exact same things that made blizzard put in LFG, change mana, remove threat and change dungeon length
---
Probably because so many say that then immediately pull aggro and die after lifetapping.
---
may your friendship never end....waiting for screens from 2030....
---
My friends take it in 2 run lvl 54 :(
---
LoD yo
---
Wouldn't it be cool flavour if mouseover listed the soul's "name" (that which was drained to create the shard)
---
When a wand drops and there isnt some spelldmg to fire/frost/arane, you as a priest are also allowed to roll on it...
---
 Shut up loser lmao
---
Don’t stress it, ony and mc will be farmed for a very long time and as people get burnt out/bored of mc/ony, then more spots open up too.
---
I dont quite know what the 16% is about because if your laughing at him not having 100% drop rate for hands then your basically questioning world of warcrafts entire loot system for not having obvious loot on every kill.
---
Mages are the only class I fear as a hunter because it's a 50-50 shot whether or not he will dead zone me and kill me or try to charge a frostbolt like a fucking moron.  
---
Warriors also suck because of the hamstring anti-kite. But scattershot can help.   
---
Nothing helps for mages.
---
The only persistent factor between both vanishes, is that he is still actively being melee attacked during both vanishes.
---
If you check @ 10sec when the vanish is used, he is still being cleaved and melee attacked by the mobs behind, this ludacris range is the spellbatching system as well.
---
It sucks that it happened twice, but i highly recommend getting so far away from mobs that you havnt been hit with damage for a few seconds before hitting vanish.
---
So I have not used maces or my gun really at all and I'm now lvl 38. Should I start using them more to get their respective talents up?  I'd hate to be lvl 60 and then realize there's some insane mace I can wield. I thought I'd be respecting to strictly daggers after a while.
---
[removed]
---
No idea, I’d think not, and it would just be exactly 1/4 of the heal value.
---
Jesus add realm or its fucking pointless
---
Vanish is basically a lottery at the moment, probably works 50% of the time at BEST. 
---
Yes it was like this in vanilla, but it was a known bug that they couldn’t find a solution to. It was finally fixed in wotlk/cata.
---
The no changes idiots can honestly go eat a bag of dicks over this one, it’s a game breaking bug and should be fixed.
---
Wait really
---
As a shaman tank, the biggest issue I've seen is shaman have the most downtime between fights. Warriors and druids can just go from group to group while I'm drinking after most pulls. We're also the least durable tanks when it comes to physical damage. Good tanking mail is hard to come by and we'll always struggle with mitigation stats (such as defense).
---
That said, we're viable for tanking any 5-man and can at least offtank in UBRS.
---
It's my first time ever playing WoW and I started out as a gnome warlock, am lvl 23 now and /played for roughly 34hrs now but it's getting increasingly difficult since I always solo everything and I'm running around looking for my quests and mobs and stuff :'(
---
Any suggestions as to level faster?
---
Me? I've tanked for 14 years and wanted to try something else. I miss tanking..
---
Priests are true aerial combat kings. Fly up, levitate, throw dots, mount back up, use the yellow damage ticks to find your target again,  levitate, throw dots, repeat until target dies or you miss your levitate landing.
---
No and the reason is that we like to see people progress not see 60s wearing a level 19 set of armor 24/7. If you want transmog go play retail.
---
80% of the video is APES footage though
---
Same with Scarlet Crusade + Zombies in plaguelands
---
Not the class, but i regret rolling on one of the highest population pvp server instead of a slightly less populated one. 
---
I'm playing a couple alts on the medium pop server and have an amazing time, people are so much more nice there, there's no comparison possible.
---
Now they opened free transfers to that server but sadly my friends don't want to leave the high pop server at all, so i'm stuck with my 60 on a server i don't really like. Kinda sucks tbh.
---
Why the fuck isn't there a 1-60 prot talent guide on that photo. I like pain.
---
Lamented? Holy Paladins are revered
---
I don’t play one but I think they would only be fun if you’re down to play a LOT/have no life because they are so gear dependent. If you can only “casually” play, you are going to feel like you suck for a while until you get good gear. 
---
Edit: I’m a hunter and I out dps any warrior who doesn’t have epics or isn’t perfectly pre-raid BiS.
---
Apologize  to all the people in your guild who didn't an opportunity to roll on the eye because of biased loot rules that favor the upper echelon. And it's not much of an accomplishment if you didn't allow anyone who can use it to roll on the eye. It's straight up disrespect to everyone else attending the raid.
---
Down with the sickness if it's a warlock video
---
You're a fucking unicorn dps. I bet you also know to slow runners so they don't aggro extra packs, unlike 90% of dps (to the point that I have to stance dance just to hamstring sometimes because otherwise we'll get another pack and risk wiping). Or to wait or slow roll your dps until I actually have a hold on some mobs.
---
I'm not saying that he is doing poorly.  Only that an expectation to farm 100+ runs for any item is more than is necessary for raiding.  He is getting a nice set of data to analyze but to say that this offhand is needed for raiding is a bit silly.
---
I would normally agree, however in this case it is a [literal mage wand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10766/plaguerot-sprig) as in only mages can equip it.
---
Still can't find a guild on skeram that allows an Ele sham to raid, how did you find one that will let enh raid
---
Stealth, Vanish, Shadowmeld, Prowl can all be seen through by some mobs or bad luck/positioning. Vanish has a chance to fail just like Feign Death and is higher likelihood to fail if you're next to the mob. You are indeed in stealth as you run past other mobs without pulling them but you are still in combat, same as if you got spotted stealthing around before engaging in combat. Sure this sucks but don't call it bug; you got rocked.
---
because its THE best thing you CAN farm , and not hope for RNG  megatitanforgedofdoom to be better cause it has a 3rd stat and a socket place
---
i prefer to farm something i have control over praying  rngesus
---
/2 LFM Strat Live, need TANK, HEAL, and 2 DPS! Orbs and flask res!
---
How do u get the extended character stats?
---
Is it swing first ask questions later type thing where if I see a hunter I should be charging in?
---
Lotus 80g?!?!?! WTF
---
On my server a lotus goes for 15-18G I believe and crystals for around 40.
---
No idea on the pearls.
---
Transcendence-germany
---
I've been helping a friend for over 200 runs and another warrior I help out occasionally is over 300. So tired of RoL.
---
Nothing is ever good enough.
---
Hunter, I'm a warrior
---
This guy doesn't even know that Shamans have tanking talents and a spell with high threat generation for a reason.
---
Disappointed by my horde brothers, you ZUG ZUG goblin-size brained bois shall all therefore burn in hell that is retail BFA.
---
The difference is that he doesn't have to start again tomorrow, next week or even next patch. It's BIS until AQ so 12+ months. The grind ends.
---
Besides, he didn't *have* to do it to stay current. There were other options that were almost as good with much less effort required:
---
* BRD : 8 str / 2 crit
---
* Scholomance : 10 str / 2 crit
---
* Dire Maul : 8 str / 20 agi / 1 crit (Can easily be bought for 30-50g from a hunter's Tribute run)
---
This is the exact same reason why i abandoned my 60 lock for a druid.
---
I got vexxed today while playing my warrior alt. I see one warrior shouting for tank in LFG last spot. I say why not, and whisper for an invite. Group already has three warriors and a healer. Two of the warriors are higher level than me. I saw there thinking, jeez l only have 3 points in prot at this point and have been tanking since the point l was able to. These warriors could easily have tanked the dungeon an hr ago instead of lounging around in lfg.
---
Ok didnt know that. In that case ok you shouldnt roll on the wand ;D

I figure Joana's guide would still be relevant. You may have to grind mobs a little bit more. There are specified level checkpoints in the guide whereby it is mentioned if you haven't reached x level yet grind some mobs before starting the next quests. So with a group where you may not get the same xp per kill as a single you might have to do a little bit more grinding.
---
Nvidia has a setting to spread a window over multiple screens.
---
There are still a bunch of quests that don't show up it's a mod it's not perfect
---
People in this game dont understand thst part of dpsing is managing threat. This is not street fighter you dont just press the buttons as quickly as u can. Tanks cant hold aggro with auto attacks like retail. Sometimes you gotta take the hit on the dps meter so you dont get smashed.
---
*rolls a 12.*
---
Funny, alliance whitemane in the 45-59 range right now has a huge amount of warriors coming up, and struggles to find healers. It's super weird. Probably the universe fucking with me since I rolled a warrior.
---
I love giving out these fishes. What always baffles me are that some psychopaths don't even eat it right away, they save it for later!
---
At 60 you are going to be using daggers or swords almost exclusively unless you get Ironfoe. There maces that are strong for leveling which is why I said don’t take a specialization, but that does not apply to level 60. 
---
There is a very good weapon progression table found here. 
---
https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm
---
Health potions will also be a massive aid in leveling war since you have no healing aside from food and bandages
---
I don’t think he’s high enough lvl for that yet
---
Doesn't physically hurt to look at.  
---
    
---
No.  
---
^Not ^at ^all.
---
Now let's plot on graphs so we can see at a glance the category of disgusting people who took the fish, ate it and didn't say a word in return.
---
Makes perfect sense thank you. Out of curiosity, why is the metric for hit 90? Is it because we need a total of 16 hit for cap and at 6 we are we ten away from 100, so we get 90?
---
I enjoy playing what is top dog, min maxing, speed leveling. Why do people make blanket statements of what is and isn't fun
---
I really hope you’re not a mana using class ha. Otherwise, enjoy the extra 10-15 seconds added to your life every time you eat!
---
Damn we found a clicker boys!
---
Both those pieces are amazing for tanks too. Just look up tank preraid bis list you you will see a lot of it is dps gear so we can keep threat off idiots.
---
On what server? There is no ore available ever on whitemane.
---
Just capitalize on it, srsly never going to have to farm for bwl/aq/nax at the current economy on AR. It's wonderful. Going to be able to just pvp full time and have all the shit farmed for raid.
---
No, not unless you were making backups of the files he described at specific times, and it doesn't sound like you were.
---
It's also a really hard to answer question; we don't know which addons you're using, or how many. Could be two or 20. Unfucking them could be simple or impossible without going back to defaults.
---
All I saw was a filthy undead rogue dying... what’s the problem?
---
Isn't funny
---
Well until BGs  are out. Then Resto Shammy will be god again.
---
Yep, just checked actually. [Proof](https://imgur.com/a/crSMejn)
---
On trash the debuff shouldn’t matter though, right? Especially if you start draining at 3-5% health. I see 4 drain souls on pretty much every trash mob and no one has said a word.
---
I had a really easy leveling experience because I found a couple pieces of good gear and mailed them to myself
---
Well I don't think anybody says that. When people recruit saying they want people in full prebis they are tacitly excluding outrageous proc pieces like this, the bracers from Incendius, the Live Strat caster cloak, etc. Spirit of Aquamentas and the BRD cloak and the DM North bracers instead are fine unless you're seriously trying to push world class logs.
---
Yea, but when you get an item you have it. There is no warforged or random shit.
---
1-60 prot guide: Die in a spot you can ress without being attacked.
---
Yeah. if you go to SW at night/midnight in Classic vs retail you can see the difference in how bright the game is in retail. There wasnt an actual gameplay reason for this but I remember it on a patch note / blue post years ago. 
---
If you ever see " late night raider " type guilds, its for those people.
---
LOL
---
I thought engineering charges can't open chests in vanilla? That was only added later I'm pretty sure.
---
Someone who has been "forced" to heal or tank rolling on their MS should be okay, but not the reverse. Also, if they are rolling on their MS while healing then they should be treating healing gear like it is their OS, and letting casters or whatever have first dibs. 
---
You should never get to roll need by default on more than one spec.
---
yeah no that I understand but I've been getting a lot of pally gear and was trying to see if it was possible some "sustain"//"lifesteal" build and whatnot, just for the lulz.
---
Yeah the compilations that somehow never show clips of the shammy getting nuked by clothies or arms warriors
---
My time came when I was tanking ZF a month ago and made a comment “Most of us prolly 25+” and our pally said “I’m actually 17”
---
I did the math and prolly tanked ZF in vanilla while he was a toddler
---
Yes Broeken Tooth in Badlands is the fastest attack speed at 1.0
---
I'm fine with ANY attitude thrown my way. Trust me. Speech skill on point here. 
---
If some nutcase wants to insist we do things his way jist for us to fail over n over then he can get bent. I'm a pretty solid group builder and I can relate with ppl often enough to see if they would or will be toxic. I've seen a dozen macros from healers, at ks, or raid leaders announcing how this instance works, what we need to avoid, and how we should react in situations. I'm not asking for a macro yelling "hey follow me or get lost!" I jist wanted to see if anybody had a funny, neat, educational or otherwise decent macro message they say in the start of a dungeon
---
You will melt faces as a Shadow Priest in PvP
---
So PVE with tight timing or positioning requirements was tricky.  But not that bad as long as your ping was stable
---
You need to go to the ACTUAL tribal LWing trainer. 8 don't know who it is for alliance. But for horde I was supposed to get a quest in thunderbluff.... But it was actually at the master tribal Lester worker in stv
---
when would I be able to purchase a server transfer?
---
Yeah that means its meant to be like this. There's many "bugs" that got fixed later such as the double charge with warriors. Blizz intends it to be like it was in vanilla. For good and for bad.
---
No because fuck Faerlina.
---
Nice tip ,I also love to explore stuff from  time to time . There are quite a few places that can simply amaze you
---
If it makes you feel any better I got it on my first ever run. I'm a hunter too :)
---
Quit till P2
---
If no one else needs it, or if you specify that you're healing (because they need a healer) but rolling on agility gear as your MS. Then healing gear would be your OS, and you would only roll on it if no one needed it. 
---
Basically, you should NEVER be rolling need on more than one spec, because that isn't fair to others in your group. If no one needs it, then sure roll need on whatever, but otherwise choose a spec at the start of the dungeon which is your MS and one which is your OS (even if that isn't the role you're doing).
---
&gt;Darnassus is easy to raid, but nobody cares about it anyway.
---
That's why it got nuked by blizz.
---
I don't, because they brought that on themselves.
---
Yes. Neutral guards are level 57 their aggro range isn't that large. Also, it's not just "that spot" as I and other people have already mentioned there's plenty of other places outside of guard range in Everlook and in every single other neutral town.
---
I've already debunked your "terrain exploit" theory and now you're just grasping at whatever you can.
---
On what grounds are you telling me that not only am I wrong despite all the evidence I've presented, but that the behavior of EVERY SINGLE GUARD in the game is wrong and that you're somehow right instead? And what's with that weak strawman comparison at the end of your post?
---
Just admit that you were misinformed and stop spreading misinformation yourself to make up for it.
---
U need a guild.... lol
---
I'm just hanging in there as a healer. A few more bits from raid and I'm making the switch to face melting mode.
---
It's a really not that bad, but it can be challenging. You will notice your below average mob kill speed, and other limitations very early on. At level 30 have a friend help you get Whirlwind Axe and then watch the dramatic and deserved increase in power.
---
Warriors are extremely satisfying to level in my opinion because of the clear character progression you are going to feel and experience along the way. From tiny fragile weakling to absolute muscle bound freak is quite the transformation.
---
Weapon upgrades feel like Christmas, literally every time you get a stronger one you for sure notice the increase in your strength.
---
At worst, warriors can take a little longer to level for the average player, and there are a lot of us in the game right now, but I will tell you this, if you want to level a character that is satisfying, powerful, and desired in groups if you gear right, and aren't scared to pick up a shield every once in a while and tank, you're going to have a good time.
---
Why do it later if you have the patience of doing it now?
---
What class are you?
---
Yeah, I figured that every penny had to be saved. Congrats!
---
Not what he asked.
---
Always figured that was the case since she's got like 6 arms and stuff.
---
Your server sells xmutes for 15g? Jebus
---
Lol only 100 runs? Filthy casual.
---
If they are leveling they probably have bestial wrath which breaks sheep, makes pet immune to cc and increases its damage by 50% for 18 seconds. This makes this strategy basically not work after level 40.
---
Yeh but the thing is they were working on a fix but just didn’t implement it in time. 
---
It’s like saying that they should keep in the other game breaking bugs for authenticity, it doesn’t make sense to gimp the game on purpose.
---
You can soulstone any friendly player, independent of whether he is in a raid or group or just running around solo in the world.
---
If they couldn't rezz after you solstoned it can have  two reasons
---
a) Soulstone just ran out in that fight. Happens more often than one would think. I always have a Soulstone in my inventory that is also present in my hotbar to show the CD and allows recasting right away.
---
b) Person fucked up and is not man enough to admit it.
---
In that case you say: 'Must be a bug' and move on
---
In you experience it was most likely one occurence each 😃
---
Unfortunately too many people just read what’s on a BiS list and think this is the only gear set you’ll ever need. People don’t understand how to gear their characters for specific roles.
---
As a warrior I have around 6 gear sets (with overlap). Different gear sets provide a lot of flexibility based on the situation.
---
- full mitigation tank gear
---
- threat tanking gear 
---
- aoe tanking gear
---
- FR gear
---
- dps gear
---
- plate dps gear
---
With a GM like that come certain kind of officer cliques and their boot licking lackeys a little lower in the raider ranks.
---
Sure it's possible this guy only wants two items reserved but since he's maining a Ret paladin it's quite clear there's a lot of gear funneling going on just so he can outDPS tanks in raids. You can be sure that super secret spec of his requires all the fury warrior gear that has to be passed to him when gearing up.
---
That's it really.
---
The dwarf is in the Chamber of Summoners in BRD which is quite close to the end, make sure you give the items to the chalice (exactly what you've noted) before starting the event.
---
After that, make sure you talk to him again to complete the quest and you'll get the ability to smelt Dark Iron ore.
---
Just keep in mind that the only place you can smelt it is inside BRD.
---
Yeah, no. Sometimes I feel like I should record just a night or two and show how many times you actually get killed running into places like BRM, or the winterspring/searing gorge flight paths, etc. The camping can be so bad that it's pointless to actually play. Don't think anyone signed up for that.
---
Also, why is it always the same "you signed up for it" or "go to pve"? Maybe people actually like pvp servers, when its actual pvp and not just 1v10. How in the world could 1v10 pvp be fun for ***anyone?*** I think a lot of these "complainers" would be content if it was a 55:45 horde favor compared to 80-85% Horde.

---
When i was leveling, there was probably a 90% chance someone in the group would ask me for Mark when I did a dungeon. Think everyone thought every Tauren healer to be a druid I guess. Now I'm leveling a druid on another server so I can fulfill their wishes...
---
Lol I was going to say, if you want no changes, Vanish actually probably needs to be broken some more. It works amazingly consistently in classic.
---
Yeah... its still broken, just so you're aware.
---
If you have the tukui desktop client you can install the classic ElvUI via the client
---
If you get jumped by a hunter you may die before you can even attempt to dead zone them, depending on their gear level and crits.
---
Wait, so your argument is that you don't have to compete for your items in 99% of instances so you should be rewarded for that *convenience* by being defaulted potentially hundreds of gold?
---
Warriors CAN be a pain, sometimes. It def seems slower, mostly only when you're going solo tho. As long as you're willing to tank, you'll never spend more than 5 seconds looking for a group, but that comes with the caveat of having to deal with people not paying as much attention to what's going on as they are recount. This is solved easily by only running with a guild, or people you've grouped with while levelling. Trying to explain to people you can't really AoE and they shouldn't just use theirs, or attack random targets, or /assist macro their attacks can get old real fast.
---
You will NOT be allowed to dps a dungeon, ever, no matter how much more fun you have doing it. The fact you're in half leather, focusing entirely on +atk power/str/agility gear will be ignored. If you DO cave, buy a shield off AH and try, you'll be blamed for being too squishy when you die. You are the only class EXPECTED to maintain 2 full separate sets of gear.
---
Your best bet for profs will be mining/BS. This can keep you fully geared at all times. Sure dungeons will get you some nice gear, but you won't be dependant on them. You'll be replacing gear fast enough to not need the drops anyway.
---
Tauren is a nice race for warrior with the extra HP, and AoE stun but Orc also has some nice benefits with the 5 bonus to axes, and stun resist.
---
Exactly. Op is complaining about people expecting tanks to know the whole dungeon, so maybe they should take their healers input when the healer want to drink to full. Maybe the healer knows something they don’t about the next pull. If people are already dying during the drink from 75% the healer was probably right to wait ‘til full mana.
---
Feign death still suffers from a variety of the same problems you guys have. You can feign death with a rogue on you and it won't actually get you out of combat.
---
What they basically ended up fixing was feign death completely breaking when you tilted your character , because character rotation would break the animation which canceled the effect but still triggered the cooldown.
---
I'm other words nothing is really fixed and hunters are still pretty fucked
---
They don’t. It’s why you see it in /4 so much.
---
Was that FunkyMonkey? From the guild Disconnected?
---
If they were working on a fix in vanilla for this it wouldn't have taken until Wrath of the Lich King to be implemented. They are slow, but not that slow. They already spoke on "bugs" like this which is why I referred to the charge thing. You were never meant to double charge like that, but it still worked in vanilla like that and Blizzard put it back in because they want it that way despite it being a bug. Im not saying they're right or wrong for it, just that this is their line of thinking.
---
Those are demonic runes. You can tell because they're green and they stack.
---
Get him a ”I got to 60 in WoW Classic and all i got was this lousy t-shirt”-shirt
---
Do the rep books even drop yet? I’m all for getting a head start but 1 rep a kill when you can farm books and dukes later for waaay faster makes more sense. Also not sure if there is any rewards yet.
---
I know right. Participating in actually fair fights inside BGs is a lot harder than ganking half dead lowbies bro XD
---
Same deal for me as Alliance on Kirtonos-US. 4th highest Horde pop server. They have a free realm transfer right now. Very tempted to use it, but friends and such keep me there.
---
Upvoted for dmaw
---
I can only speak from a warrior perspective as it's the only class I've leveled so far.
---
It was tough every now and then. At times you will die over and over... and over again because you accidentally pull two mobs or because you're in a dense area (fuck WPL) but in the end I dont look back on it as it was something dreadful.
---
I enjoyed it.
---
Expect to tank. Consider yourself lucky if you get in a group that accept that you only want to dps. If you don't have a problem with that I'd say go ahead.
---
I love playing a warrior. Now that I'm getting pretty well geared it's so satisfying passing mages and rogues on the damage meter that has always been topping you. Dps warriors are some of the best dps available so you'll have no problem finding spots in raids. Be aware that Fury gear is few and far between atm. You can go for a month of raids and still not get a single item.
---
The Gordok King (Final boss of North/tribute runs) is like level 62, with a 5 level difference you will struggle to do significant damage but you can definitely kill him in a group of 5.
---
Tribute runs may be difficult due to your higher aggro radius, but nothing impossible.
---
DMW and DME should be quite easy at 57, the final bosses are 61/58 respectively, so you'll still do decent damage against them. 
---
Basically you can do any of the wings, but I'd suggest holding off a level or two until DM:N to make it easier for yourself and your group.
---
Actually in German it would be "Das Insekt". Not sorry for ruining your Joke. Im German, we don't know Humor.
---
Man, I love that channel! :D
---
you can tank as a holy paladin quite well. I used to run dungeons where I would tank and heal and would bring 4 dps. It has it's problems if you have a lot of interrupts but it works pretty well in a lot of situations.
---
In BC when spell damage gear was fairly common, I would tank, heal, and top DPS with my consecration dots if the group was not particularly strong
---
dude it takes a long time to get a random group going.  even an organized group will take prob like 20 mins to get everyone on and ready.  its why blizzard changed the way dungeons are done.  unless you are on a really weird server i find it hard to believe it's easier to get a group as a dps then a healer and you will still spend an hour getting a random group together as a lock.
---
Oh, I don't actually know!
---
Scum!
---
When they're so confident they're right that they per-emptively ignore you so they get the last and only word  
---
"I mean, n--" NOT LISTENING, LALALALA\~
---
Just a PSA that if you’re not in a hurry you can just wait for AV and get the wolf mount from there, since most people are gonna go for exalted with frostwolf anyway. And it only costs around 550g IIRC
---
Only seems to be eu
---
I don't think it's based off the retail client as Classic doesn't have multi-core optimizations
---
in vanilla the diaries sold for 50 silver, in classic they are 2 silver
---
PP runs are not worth it.
---
Sap breaks stealth for me, and you need stealth to pp.
---
At low levels in nice gear I hit like a wet noodle as a holy paladin. Couldn't hold any threat. I feel like at 60 in the right gear with enough talents filling out the other trees for mitigation, tanking as a holy/prot paladin becomes much more viable.
---
I loved most of the classes in BC. The only reason I don't want BC (besides the obvious) is because I'd go back to having 2000 alts again. And they'd be 95% draenei. :')
---
&gt;This is griefing right?
---
Absolutely not.
---
&gt;I was so frustrated when it was happening to me and I alt-f4 and didnt report anyone know how to report opposite faction without having them right in front of you to click on their portrait?
---
Did you try do something different, or did you keep going back to your corpse and repeating the exact same process and dying every time?
---
Ever thought of just *not* joining reserved groups instead of pissing and moaning about it online?
---
Nope. I give people who aren't big ass pussies about a very specific item have the opportunity to get their pre-bis and I've had well over a hundred players *happy* to give up the item for a chance to have an easy tank run.
---
If you aren't happy about it, then don't fucking join, you whiner.
---
How long did you wait from announcing to killing?
---
Its hard to judge as he is "pvp"ing with the opposite faction even though all he is doing is making the game impossible for him to play and not killing him
---
Getting both is good. Edgemaster a must for fighting 63 enemies but not required on lvl 60-61 mobs.
---
And resto druids are going to heal significantly worse than a similarly geared priest.
---
Guess you better reroll.
---
If you're lucky enough to have the option of need/greed an item, even if that item is too high for you to use yet, then that's just fine! 
---
You were there, contributing and have just as much right to roll as the healer did (imo)
---
Pretty much, what you said
---
Made it into a mini calculator for anyone interested

Yes, when you’re in execute range you’re using all your rage to spam execute.
---
This guy, listen to this guy.
---
He literally said at the end of the video “I’m harassing him”. It’s definitely griefing. Very toxic.
---
"wtf are you talking about, why on earth would we give lock prio or bonus roll on ony bags?"
---
No, if you can fix the issue by killing the other player then it isn't griefing
---
By griefing I mean a bannable thing, he is definitely griefing but it isn't bannable or reportable
---
You're fine, take your time and get to 60 while having fun and not trying to rush to it.
---
If you join a raiding guild you'll find that it's probably easier to get full T1/leaf since more and more hunters are getting geared.
---
Hell my guild had to call in a 58 hunter the last MC because we didn't have enough in the raid without the leaf.
---
Grats on all the dope gear, but god have mercy on your soul for using that axe..
---
All tanks want the neck, that’s what I said.
---
No. Neither the sets or papers are dropping atm, but if you’re planning on going for Scarab Lord and have nothing else to do, why not start the grind in order to get a headstart?
---
Honestly, killing anything with double xp will net you insane levels of xp/hr. As of right now you are probably in the top 10% of players in terms of uptime efficiency because you always have rested xp.   
---
Just keep working and getting that money and don't worry too much about the world of warcraft.
---
So I know vanish can be tricky. I think it's the mobs having to be turned off of you while u vanish and sometimes they delay, mid swing and hit u. And when that hit lands JUST after ur entering ur vanish then it breaks it and ur fight goes on anyways. Broken indeed.
---
But the cheap shot thing I have actually seen for myself. I'll ooen on a lower lol mob with cheapskate so it isn't like they saw me invisible and hit me out of ut. I literally opened with it and got swung at. That's a bit broken lol.
---
What's the faction balance on Kromkrush?
---
I don't see many Alliance players out in the open; and I often have to switch zones since one questing area is quite literally filled with blood thirsty Horde.
---
Thanks, it had not run out on the two times they said they weren't soul stoned, I have been paying attention to those two and have a timer and had watched the buff was still on them (can they click if off?). Maybe just them or possibly a bug but thanks for replying because I was worried I'd missed some different mechanic in raids, there was no drama over it just my own piece of mind wanting to know i'm not fucking up.
---
I sure am. They're both parts of the game that should obviously be considered by the average player part are often glossed over.
---
Difference is his grind is extremely optional.
---
Yea he was clearly joking about it being rude
---
Tyvm!
---
Why are sensitive kids always posting interactions like this? This subreddit is full of this garbage.
---
&gt;Did you try do something different, or did you keep going back to your corpse and repeating the exact same process and dying every time?
---
I'm so confused, did you actually read the thread? Dying/corpse camping isn't what's going on here...
---
What? My shadow priest soloed him at 41.
---
Well warlocks are very good at leveling because you can dot and kill 2-4 mobs at a time, making you gain xp faster. If you’re having trouble finding quests then maybe look for a guide or do some dungeons.
---
Pretty sure this was only people who accepted trade since some of the people in the nothing column ate it immediately. Might be a mesh of afk and no response though.
---
Literraly dropped for my group 10 min ago.... 2 druid, a hunter, a mage, and a warlock
---
Harassment that can be solved through pvp (killing the mage) isn't harrassment on pvp servers
---
You can hit 60 in over a year and be just fine. Pretty much every guild will still be running MC in a year, hunting the rare patch 1.4 and 1.5 items like robe of volatile power, mana igniting cord, wild growth shoulders and cauterizing bands on top of TF bindings.  
---
Same for BWL, Rejuvenating Gem, Drake Fang Talisman and such pieces will very much still be in demand even when Naxx is out.  
---
The only thing you'll be missing out on is doing the progress, killing bosses and being in the guild screenshots from first kills.
---
Most boss fights in molten core last about a minute. If you pop the trinket for 15 of those seconds then the trinket is worth about 1/4 of 175 sp, which is huge. Better than 2% crit I'd guess but you can do the math to know for sure.
---
Actually you are right, on the few occasions I had an unstable ping yeah it was a problem but we had decent connections so for the most part it was just a steady ping and steady lag that would be tough pvping on some classes but not really noticable in pve.
---
I mean... how is that an argument though? Could he have *not* done that if he wasn’t taking other classes weapons..? And do you need a warrior to pull 700 DPS to kill him (nope)? So why would you not let some of the people who come along every week actually get some cool loot and tell the warrior to hold back and do a measily 600 DPS instead if it actually becomes an issue?
---
We give our tanks every *tanking* item that drops before it goes to anybody else... weapons go to the DPS. Aside from anything else if you tell every single person who shares an item a tank *might* be able to use they have to let them take it? You’ll lose your best DPS.
---
MC is clearable in greens and blues. It’s *easily* clearable if you’re in a mix of BoEs and end game blues. If you’re insisting on giving every single drop to the tanks until they have literally everything, my guess is the GM is the tank or something because it makes no sense to do otherwise.

Now you can play the game.

Did you watch the video? There is no corpse run? You cant move or fight back. Hes not trying to kill his targets hes justing harassing them. Laughing and wasting their time?

They can remove it just like any other buff with shift click.

Lol you say that as if getting prebis is actually hard/time consuming for a priest.

Jealous of warrior helmets and wants a Tauren. I main a 60 Orc Prot Warrior and love it.

Nah id say you are just in time for the party. We are all having a blast and most of us havent even finished the first raids yet. Honorable kills and battlegrounds arent even out yet. Hell id argue that you are in fact at home getting dressed and pounding some beers getting ready for the big party!

Should've played a damn rogue like I did during original classic, only had to open lockboxes and I was at least paid for that. It's gonna drive me mad, I'm telling you, MAD!
---
Oh man i would have such a hard time using ones made from players.
---
I agree with you OP in many ways. I rolled warrior after loving it in vanilla. Well I expected I'd be tanking and prepared to do it. However I soon gave up on this. I constantly groups that just played like it was retail. It isn't easy for a tank to get aggro on packs of five+ mobs at once, especially after the battle/demo shout nerfs. So we need a moment before you AoE or go ham. I keep trying to tell people that and instead I'm the one whos called bad. I'm the one told to learn to play. The worst is warlocks who insist on using their crappy hellfire which gets them aggro instantly on half the mobs, forcing the healer to decide to heal me or them. 
---
Now I just gave up tanking. I will only tank if it's a group of friends or guildies. It's amazing how smooth runs go with people who know what they're doing. I don't make runs go slow, quite the opposite actually. I just say give me a few GCDs and then feel free to all out. This keeps the runs quick and easy.
---
&lt;3
---
Probably all hunters
---
Keep digging that hole. Always entertaining to see your kind double down when they realize they're wrong. Says a lot about your character. You probably do this IRL too. Think about it, for your own sake. Most people will eventually distance themselves from your kind. Maybe you've already noticed this?
---
you should look up some world mob farm spots.  like bats in plaguelands.  they arent nuts like pservers but a profession plus bats should be like 20+gph and they are not contested at all.
---
When I had this happen, I logged into my mage and my rogue was still standing at the mailbox.
---
Mining is great for money, but it depends on two major factors.
---
The Zone: Winterspring is great, but I swear there must be tons of guides/youtube videos because I see tons of people tanking the exact routes and basically taking everything before you get there. EPL is amazing for RTV/STV and chances are if you check any of the slime/undead-heavy areas you'll find at least one. Burning Steppes/Blasted Lands are also good, but I find that there's not as much RTV compared to the others.  
---
The Time: Going in the morning, or late at night and you'll find that pretty much every node spawn is up. Going during peak hours generally means that you'll spend 1/2hr-1hr farming for one node then competing with 2-3 other people to get it.
---
Basically if you go to areas like EPL/WS at off peak hours you can make a ton of money mining, otherwise it's very difficult to turn a profit without some luck.
---
My issue was the healer mind blasting things immediately, honestly. With DPS who wait 3 seconds, it's not so bad! I felt really smushy and Consecration did all my damage. I didn't want to tank on that character anyway: I'll still be giving her a holy/prot build. Just saw Quissy's video about using it for Dire Maul and I dig it. I was considering it for the Sanctuary blessing anyway. That sealed the deal.
---
That said, as a chronic idiot (I mean...altoholic) I have a second paladin I made just for tanking. I love him already. I'm feeding him little bits of gold to level engineering and I'm gonna have a ton of fun tanking with him I think!
---
It's bugged, but shit like this used to happen to me all the time in vanilla.   So...bugs working as intended in my eyes, as much as I hate it.
---
How do I shaman tank early to mid levels? I want to give it a try.
---
if I had a nickel for every time I tapped down to low health and started draining life, only to get healed back to full before it ticked more than twice...
---
You dumb? The mage can’t be killed. All he has to do is poly and tbag forever. The 15 minute video didn’t tip you off to that?
---
I'll buy it once it has an in game guide
---
Holy fuk you snowflakes should just go to retail. You actually wanted to *report* him for that? The fuk, ask for help, don’t go full Randall mode.
---
I wish they had BGs on PvP servers :[
---
How dare other people like things different than I do!
---
Diminishing returns exist, and there's multiple ways out of this.
---
Challenging Raids bosses didn’t really happen to wrath and even then just stay out of the fire lol
---
Great answer.
---
We're at well over 200 runs so far for a buddy of mine, not a single chest. Probably seen the orc maybe 20 times or so, give or take a few.
---
It's super dumb, but BiS is BiS.
---
No
---
I think you need 250LW.
---
Yeah IIRC vanish never worked right in vanilla, even through multiple fix attempts. Even when it does work properly, you can't vanish with mobs beating on you like in retail. You have to get some distance first or they'll just hit you as you vanish and knock you back out of stealth.
---
That dropped on my third run lol.
---
Edit: stockade pauldrons dropped on my second.
---
Malown's Slam is a good contender for second. You automatically emote when it procs, literally flexing on your enemies.
---
The grimtotem tauren fight random stuff in feralas.
---
use rank 1 frost nova, and roll with another mage. when in doubt just iceblock
---
You want to be an orc, not tauren.
---
Can we all take a moment and appreciate the forward thinking and brilliance of /u/mortalmena ? Would you also consider pouring cereal before milk in the morning?
---
It's because the tank or melee in the group doesn't want loot competition
---
Isn't the average around 8 days? That's how long mine took and that's not trying to be efficient so 7 isn't that far off...
---
I told a Feral Druid that he can assist with Tanking in open world quests vs some elites - he proceeded to bitch about how I was a shitty Tank cause I couldn't hold aggro (I was specced into Fury and was 2h while my 1h skill was low), he kept saying "I'm Feral, I'm not a Tank!" without actually realizing that Feral is DPS AND Tank. I explained it to him. 
---
Now he'll forever be on my shit list cause he bitched about my Tanking abilities as a low level Warrior when they wouldn't even let me get aggro. Frustrating as hell when I'm trying to help someone else out and they bitch that I'm not good enough for them despite the fact I'm spending my valuable time Tanking for them when I could instead be doing something far better.
---
Git friends or guildies. This situation could've been resolved through pvp which means it doesn't fall under harrassment (at least it used to not fall under harrassment)
---
TRAITOR
---
Most Warcraft creatures are straight jacked from DnD, which is in turn jacked from mythology. 
---
Eg kobolds, elementals...
---
Do you think assuming a level 56 warrior can reasonably defeat a max level raid geared mage is fair? When the mage can reset the fight almost whenever they want?
---
Sorry that seems wrong to me.
---
I'm.not sure what video you watched..
---
I never even trained the other ranks. Rolling with another mage isn't a bad idea, though! I'm sure some better gear might help (more mana/health would help for sure, or more powerful spells hitting harder), but until then... :)
---
Nah it wasn't, according to Staats anyways. They just had weird abilities like that. Warlock has higher threat for example and Mind Blast is a SUPER high threat priest ability.
---
I love tanking but for the reasons you stated I rolled holy priest. While in PUGs I try and help the tank babysit and communicate as much as possible to have a smooth run. I'd would rather it be a nice paced smooth run, than a fast paced, hectic cluster fuck as you described with mages AOEing and ooming. I wish there were more tanks but I completely understand why it is the way it is.
---
Yes it's griefing.
---
No it's not against the ToS.
---
I would just alt-f4 for a few minutes.  
---
[Read this.](https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Griefing) And I mean really read it. It's not against ToS.
---
There's space for one nightfall swinger per raid. Still wouldn't give them sulfuras any time soon.
---
Lmao this is a weirdly targeted comment. You ok?
---
That being said, the thing about communicating through text is that we don't have vocal cues like tone, pronunciation, etc. to go by, so there's really no surefire way to parse sarcasm. Context clues and whatnot only do so much. 
---
That's part of the reason why things like emotes/emojis, text formatting and the like exist. That and, y'know, good ol' /s. It's hard to figure out without something denoting sarcasm or other intent. 
---
Except for you apparently. I'd love to know how you happened upon this apparent magical ability to sniff out "obvious" sarcasm.
---
That must be nice.
---
My guild tried coordinating an IF raid last night on Kromkrush and the majority of the horde replied, “but there are not honor kills yet, what’s the point in raiding cities?”
---
Call in friends or guildies or other people in the zone. Blizzards stance (or used to be at least) is that if you can solve a situation through pvp, not necessarily 1v1, it isn't harrassment
---
Ya trash doesn’t matter unless it was a dumb pull/set up that you have to recover from. Depending on the Warlock, you’ll still go through those shards easily. Some warlocks are leaned more on than others for summons and health stones. My raid has one warlock that the MT/raid lead will always default to for summons/health stones just because he knows the warlock is prepared.
---
iirc it's based on 7.2, and 7.3 or some time in BFA is when the multi-core optimization came in
---
Ah yeah someone doing that kind of crap can really mess things up. Like what purpose does mind blasting things at the beginning of the fight do? You can mostly deal with it as a warrior because of how good taunt is, but you get one resisted taunt and it just snowballs.
---
I want to play with you guys
---
Base chance to hit a boss at 60 is 83%, the 6 from talents get us to 89, and 90 is just a nice round number that anyone with Ban'thok sash (pre-raid BiS) will have anyway.
---
No it's not greifing because its player versus player. The problem could be solved by killing the mage. Obviously a warrior stands no chance to kill the mage but you can get friends etc. It's essentially no different to spam sheep someone and to corpsecamp them, and both is allowed.
---
I don't disagree with you and I have no personal experience finding groups as a DPS so I obviously cant definitively say it's easier.
---
I just see FAR FAR more spam for LF DPS/Tank in LFG and Trade than I do LF Healer.
---
Really it's the Tanks that bind it all together.
---
I think the key point though that others have agreed with was the idea that healers would be extremely in demand and it's definitely been the reverse experience
---
Im already hard from 2v1ing Alliance players in Hillsbrad. Lotsa baddies under the blue banner just sayin’.
---
Me an my buddies have it up always, usually eat em till we are ninjas.
---
Welcome to classic?
---
When they pay for tanking services and stand there and do nothing. 😂
---
As someone who mained a shaman back in the day, you are seriously putting shaman on some mystical pedestal.  
---
Incredible dps: pve-no.  Pvp: some burst capability, but good luck being kited, stunlocked, silenced, in general cc’d to death, totems die in one hit.  No cc escapes and no real cc besides frost shock and earthbind totem. If enhance, a slot machine that almost never pays out.
---
Meanwhile paladins are a nightmare for some classes to finish off.  They can remove all sorts of nasty shit from teammates and blessing of freedom and protection are great.
---
Raid healers: ok sure, chain heal is good.  No blood lust, no totem recalls, probably forced to totem twist which is so annoying.
---
Totems only hit your party and last 5 min. Blessings hit everyone and can last 15 minutes, follow us and stay up if the buffer dies.  Just the blessing of salvation alone is so nice.
---
The only thing shamans are “incredible” at is taking gear no one else wants or can use rather than throwing it out.
---
The truth is I think the horde are in for a rather rude awakening when bgs launch because there will be an even amount of players on both sides.  Most servers are swarming with horde and almost all the pvp initiated on me is two on one, where I can hold my own fine, and I honestly like the practice, but then 3 more guys show up and Zerg.  Once the bgs start and they notice all these shaman who watched YouTube videos cropped down to 3% of a pvp players game time highlights that are getting melted instead of healing they are going to be pissed.
---
Once I got my epic mount and Sword of Zeal, I bought 16 slot bags and maxed bank slots with 16 slot bags. These are quality of life improvements that will last the entire expansion, so I went ahead and got them. Plus, as a rogue, I don't have anything else to spend my gold on.  I pretty much raid log and farm juju/elemental fire/firewater/herbs if I'm not raid logging.
---
Is this griefing? Probably, yes. A dick move? Absolutely. Is this bannable behavior on a PvP server? No, I don't think so.
---
Ask for help on regional or global channels. Ask your guild. Ask your friends. You're playing on a PvP server, hostility between factions is what you signed up for.
---
Is this the same guy making the same tank rant post every week?  This one reads like a copy pasta of the last.
---
https://youtu.be/t6cht4djp-8
---
From I understand there is a higher gear req than Mara but it yields more gold especially if you have gathering
---
Check out the warlock discord too there is more info there
---
You're half right.  Most tanks are indeed fucking awful but tanking is not hard.
---
Hence the "I can even imagine".
---
Again did you watch the video?
---
Sure Diminishing returns but Sheep and slows are different DRs.
---
The video is pretty clear, Sheep until DR then slow kite with cone of cold and ice nova until Sheep DR wears off.
---
Am i wrong?
---
I had gnomish boots, mind control cap, and the gnomish invisibiltiy device i feared him(which is hard getting enough rage) and I still couldnt get away. This doesnt even take into the epic mount factor.
---
So tell me what are the multiple ways to get out of this?
---
The corpse in the background of that roll screen isn't smooth, close to a good photoshop but clearly a photoshop!
---
Cuz it gets destroyed after 3 uses
---
Could you imagine being that guy?
---
The more people on your group gives you better % for loot?am I right? Asking here
---
I think the response is a joke as well..... you should probs understand how to banter
---
That's not dependent on servers.  This is classic, there were no BG's at release, they were added later. I think Warsong is the first one, not 100% sure on that.
---
Who doesn't loot? As a skinner I have encountered this issue for years and I just do not understand
---
Thanks man. Do you have a formula to see how much damage gain a boost in spell power gives you (as you do for crit)?
---
Okay, hold the phone there, brother. M'uru pre-nerf was although not impossible like C'thun pre-nerf, only killed like 3 times because of his difficulty. Let's not claim everything was knife through butter style till Wotlk.
---
Hi peeps, I'm trying to make more friends since I'm not so good at the game yet and soloing results in a lot of deaths (rogue). The friend i was leveling with is getting busier with school and our schedules aren't really lining up unfortunately. 
---
Anyone interested in leveling new toons together? I'll likely be on around 10-12ish on weekdays. Doesn't matter if it's alliance or horde as long as its not Stalagg-Alliance since Stalagg's where my current horde toon is, and I'm thinking of playing either a Mage or a Priest!
---
What are your primary professions? Use those to make money.
---
My first reaction to his post is that you're probably a mediocre tank at best. Someone who is stuck in the old system of tanking vanilla, when its been in fact been proven that traditional tanking, at least in low level dungeons can be done without a traditional tank. This game isn'tas hard as many people remembered but people seem to be stuck on the idea it is. There is a huge point to speed running and it annoys the hell out of me that people try to downplay it. Once content, any content has been beaten it is only natural to figure out how to do it better. I rather you fail and spend 3-4 hours completing a dungeon trying a speed run so that the next few attempts will be faster and every other attempt after that will be faster than going at a snails pace every single run because you need the healer to be aat 100% mana when he can heal the whole dungeon without drinking already.  
---
So the DPS are always trying to push cause if the healer and tanks are capable, they can go all out and finish the dungeons faster, nothing annoys me more than tank who insist that everyone needs to be at 100% mana before he pulls or has to single target kill everything, its so inefficient and slow it's mind boggling, I feel like these tanks are so stuck in their bubble that they are incapable of doing anything else.  There are undergeared DPS warriors who "tank" scholomance and stratholme without issue, yet here you are not capable of tanking low level dungeons.  
---
I've tanked for as long as I have played and with classic I went with DPS, I have never seen so many weak tanks in my entire life.
---
buddy of min saw 4 HOJs drop in consecutive runs and made fun of me for it for days because i went to bed instead of farming anger till 4 AM
---
Is true, but they are also over farmed (your server maybe not)
---
Not a bug. It's a mechanic.
---
we might be in the same guild...
---
You mean Curse of Recklessness?  That I have bound on my X key on a macro that will cast it on my target or whatever mob I have moused over so if a mob peels off that I'm not focused on I can simply mouse over and press X?
---
    /cast [mod:shift,@focus][@mouseover,harm,nodead][group:raid][] Curse of Recklessness; Curse of Recklessness(Rank 1) 
---
In case anyone asks.
---
Literally everyone in the raid rolled.
---
I know I was joking because you seem to be suggesting that I don't have access to bgs the same way you do on your little pve server
---
My guild banned summons to raids. Be there on time or get cut.
---
&gt;o
---
It's a problem for the level 40 mount, but the engine sound isn't present on the level 60 mount.
---
Well, this isn't for the Gates, you can't headstart the gates, as far as I'm aware, this is for Earthstrike trinket, if you grind it now you don't have to compete for as long with other people doing the grind in phase 5 when the faster rep and rewards are released. 
---
And since P2 PvP isn't out yet, there's nothing else to do for people in their bis gear.
---
That doesnt contradict what I said at all.  If you enjoy minmaxing, do it.  If you don't, don't. Pretty fucking simple.
---
&gt;So tell me what are the multiple ways to get out of this?
---
Protip: Sheep breaks with any instance of damage.
---
What server are you on? I’ll dps for your group any day. I’m an enhancement shaman with windfury and strength totems. I don’t use rockbiter weapon in dungeons, and I always wait till there’s at least 1 sunder before I start attacking. Also I throw out bonus heals when stuff get squirrelly.
---
I got that part.
---
I just didn't get how you could imagine it. (;
---
Those dice rolls would have made me sweaty
---
playing a priest, and beeing able to get wands of the AH, then it kinda stops beeing a challenge, thats basicly all you need to level it.
---
I dunno, what sick bastard wouldn't have a 5th Warlock
---
&gt;!because I do and it's great fun!&lt;
---
Yes. Fully. That's why no one likes to tank! Lol
---
I was confused too. The answer is questie is bugged and all you have to do is go to the tribal leatherworker for your faction. They will give you one final quest before you become tribal good luck
---
yep this is what I did too. Dont have key though.
---
Can 5-6 man Rend easy. Don't need a full 10 man.
---
it's easy to kill hunters
---
Well there is a path along the cliffs.
---
&gt; I expect you to use the few seconds of out-of-combat I give you to start drinking, and I expect you to get up in time to keep me and the rest alive.
---
You had me until here.  The correct course is to pull so long as the healer has enough mana to keep you alive, and then once they are under that threshold you wait for them to drink to full before repeating the process.  Wasting the healer's drinks is rude.
---
Vendor trash would have you close 90g, you spent too much money on junk (usually bags, professions, and AH armor/weps) unfortunately there are no get rich quick methods at level 38, you will be walking for quite a few more levels. Let this be a lesson.
---
I Wana see the post "so I accedently transfered to arcanite reaper. I thought that the shop was selling cool tramsmog skins and I really wanted the skull axe so I clicked to give it to my character and now I'm on a different server! This is blizzard's fault for not being clear on what they were selling in the shop, I demand a transfer back! "
---
Very nice.
---
Usually DPS who pull aggro don’t mind it if they get it.  I let them take a few hits and take my time getting it back.  Speaking as a warrior, you have tools to keep two on you no matter how ham a close-level DPS goes.
---
I may lose aggro on &gt;2 mob pulls.  But I hardly ever had a problem with 3-elite pulls, hell, even 4-elite pulls are ok, mainly cuz I’m fine with DPS taking hits.  They get aggro, I let them get hit a few times, but they don’t die cuz I keep healer alive and I peel off of DPS if they can’t take the hit.  Healers haven’t complained to me, they’ve complained about DPS taking damage to DPS though.
---
Tanked my way to 50 so far on Arms fwiw, so I’ve tanked up to Mara.  Dungeons probably get harder from here on.
---
I did 5 per hour and I play 8 to 12 hours per day and I got to my lvl 60 aprox at day 5
---
u blink in, nova, one frosbolt, coc, and then AE until he is dead. Fireblast too. gg. u dont even need to sheep pet if u get them both in nova.
---
Same
---
Why? What happens then
---
Very true. Also in Strat UD vanish doesn't work with the undead, it does with the rats, but anyone else, you're fucked.
---
Stand outside of melee, and inside of range
---
Everytime somebody hits me 1st. I am a peace loving gnome who loves to help horde players kill mobs but if you dare to hit me you deserve to feel my wrath. They will know not to fuck with Åkerlund eventualy
---
Pearls are going up to 70 amd down to 55 like every other day on gehennas, bought 10 when they were 20g each to sit on/use for upcoming enchants
---
thats news to me
---
oh man I figured they would have given the hardcore PvPers of lakeshire pve bgs early
---
I actually didn't tally the orc at all I only tallied total arena runs &gt;.&gt;
---
Well that makes sense, I am still a poor level 34 warlock.
---
All need is the only way.
---
First make sure it’s the classic version. Secondly you don’t need to make a new folder. Select both folders then extract them to the addon folder for classic.
---
Sounds like you need to get good. Tanking is about embracing and managing chaos. If every run was textbook and went according to plan, it would be boring like it is in retail.
---
Anyone who is mad you for doing this, it is only because they cant
---
4am?
---
That is assuming Orc fury. If you are prot/tank you can get all your gear from dungeons. You can use thrash and mirahs and work to dal rends as well. The devilsaur part is true however. But those really only run you like 200g for the pair and are going down. Really not too bad to be honest as far as it goes. And just take 1st orb reserve as you tank strat live. Ive gotten probably 9 orbs that way now. I only paid for the other crusdader mats and a 5g tip for guildie. I probably paid 17g for my crusader in total
---
plus so many people dont bother opening the claims unless they are farming them.
---
Dishonorable kills from killing NPCs.
---
Pretty much how I got my mount money lol. I was drunk as fuck walking around IF inviting people to group so I could turn them into pirates. Ended up getting 40g from a mage.
---
You kidding me? I'm tossing those out in Desolace, Stranglethorn, and anywhere else I see pals in the water. They love that shit, and I love making people happy.
---
I didn't realize neutral guards were 57, which would explain why I was getting aggro everytime. I was getting camped at a lower level by a 60, who was obviously out of aggro radius. 
---
Either way, this type of play is punishable. It's unintentional and you know it. I'll take a 60 and leave them there camping until I get banned and post a screenshot.
---
No1 mentioned this but blasted lands for just the rares and all the misc quests there. It’s a nice place to grind gear if you’re behind on dungeons.
---
If I see a fury with thunder fury in my raid I'm out. That will be a wipefest. It causes so much threat, especially if the tanks don't have one.
---
Thanks for this!
---
I remember this from back in the day. Apparently they have no real way of stopping an auto attack after vanish so sometimes (read: a lot) you get auto’d out of vanish. It’s never actually been fixed 100% as far as I know.
---
Finally I see someone else who does this, my NE warrior is using the set with edgemasters, I haven’t seen another warrior with black dragonscale armor yet
---
“I’m not your buddy friend!” (South Park)
---
BRD AOE XP runs
---
Especially if you're on a PvP server. If youre alliance, stay out of the light.
---
Yeah I thought about maybe just making it melee classes only, but my main is a warrior, and I leveled a rogue to 60 in Classic. You think that’d make it tougher? I could always level an enhancement shaman I suppose...
---
Yes they can. Been doing it the last few days trying to farm SGC. There are guides on YouTube as well.
---
Neat idea! 
---
Couple thoughts:
---
If you’re forced to vendor your starting gear this will exclude a lot of classes since they can’t do much without at least a weapon. 
---
Trinket slot will be pretty hard to fill from only the AH.
---
Getting to the level where you could buy a better weapon would be a *fucking nightmare* on a warrior.
---
Sounds like you should focus on retail and see if classic wow hooks ya ;)
---
I had an enh shaman yesterday try to argue with me about dropping wf totem. He just flat out refused because "agi helps both of us". It took the rest of the group yelling at him because they were afraid the tank was gonna leave after I asked 3 times and he argued every time. I love tanking and want so badly to do it, but fighting against your own group who just want to big dick dps more than they want the run to go smooth is more trouble than it's worth a lot of the time.
---
God daymn... I've only been able to get like 8-9g for golden pearls on Yojamba.
---
So the ToEP averages to around 29sp so about 23 more damage and 2%crit gives about 12 damage making sp that much better
---
That’s why I didn’t level a warrior 😂
---
Well, that and my main is a warrior.
---
they can https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COEoiRChP2U
---
It was so people could keep the names they paid to reserve.
---
While good in duels and single target dps, I find shadow pretty much a liability to most 5 mans. 
---
I get the respec costs are way too high, so I decided to wait till 55 to respec holy and just dungeon grind some BIS while getting xp.
---
Immune works too. That's why I spam rend on targets that can't bleed while I'm leveling weapon skill.
---
I pally get ret tank all level 55-60 dungeons it’s a hell of a drug and super fun!
---
Even through TBC vanish was buggy as fuck.
---
Enhancement isn’t too bad if you supplement your PvP with lots of engineering and obtain a decent weapon. 
---
Don’t expect a premade spot as the premade spot for shamans are for elemental resto hybrids. 
---
Some “easy” to obtain gear (phase depending) includes skyfury helm, TuF + Don Julios, SGC, legs of destruction, bloodmail boots/gloves, warp wood binding, baron cape, mark of Fordring, full swathe of engineering trinkets/hoj/PvP trinket. 
---
This gear will be ok during the BWL era. 
---
AQ post you’ll just get stomped. 
---
I’d suggest resto-ing your way to greatness and building your offsets like I am. I have a full resto raid bis +/- a few pieces like the rag shield, most of the good ele pieces (missing TOEP/rag shield) and all the items for enh enlisted above plus an earthshaker.
---
Tldr play resto and collect enough gear to freespec to your preferred spec for the other six nights of the week you aren’t facerolling MC and BWL (later).
---
So you should just shard it then?
---
Sunder is pretty good.
---
Been pick pocket farming for the past 3 days in BRD. I've had vanish/prep fail on me maybe a couple dozen times or so, but it's a rare occurrence out of the couple 1000+ pockets I've picked, sure it cuts in to your gold per hour and is an inconvenience.. but last I remember, this is how vanish actually worked in vanilla, it was always very temperamental
---
Yeah it is the only raid. If you need to sap pulls in UBRS you need to get yourself a better group. It mattered maybe in the first month when people had all greens but now it's a joke.
---
I play alliance on Kromkrush and am currently lvl 40. Getting to SM kinda sucks, but I feel like it's like that for alliance on any PvP server. Overall in questing it feels like there is a slight horde advantage. Alliance has a really strong presence though. If I get ganked, I post in guild and in general. 10 minutes later, alliance are overwhelming in response and camping the guy who was ganking lowbies. I've also experienced quite a bit of good world pvp when levelling with friends where it's our group vs a horde group like kill each other a couple times and then go back to questing. Honestly I feel like most world pvp happens simply because everyone has a quest to kill 10 murlocs or whatever and there are only 5 that spawn every few minutes. So we try to kill each other so we have a better chance at finishing the quest lol.
---
I feel like it's about as balanced as a PvP server can really be.
---
While your written English is on-point, you somehow still fail to perceive and understand what is being written. Every single post you made in this thread is a proof of that. The fact that you deem it necessary to write huge wall of texts with every response to get a point across that could be shortened to a single paragraph proves it even more. You are literally misunderstanding every single thing. 
---
And I'm not about to waste anymore time on another white knight living in the clouds.
---
Have fun in life.
---
OP didn't mention using edgemasters, is human, and tanks can use daggers. OH dagger is fine with edge's but in this case he should just stay in his lane.
---
unfortunately that’s gamers for you. A lot of them are virgins. Make sure you report them for racist language though
---
Cant debate this. I would do the same In an instant.
---
&gt; I really gave it a fair chance sitting there for 3.7 seconds waiting for a swing
---
you know hamstring kiting is a thing, right?
---
Ofc it will
---
Now you reroll and start over
---
Did what I could. Unfortunately, I reported most of them for what they said in G chat which goes mostly unregulated.
---
I realize the joke is funnier with Hunter, but 
---
*Enhancement Shaman walks in** 
---
would be far scarier. 
---
All stats functional. No excuse to not let them roll.
---
I dislike the toxic culture people force on others, with BiS (didn't exist even through *TBC*) and the way they grind and grind for items that largely make no difference. Then convincing other people who are new to play a certain way. The meta-awareness of games leads to guides that convince people to think a certain way, and *that* robs them of their experience. The end result is an idea that you can only really raid one particular way, and it ends up affecting people in ways that are unacceptable (telling people that they shouldn't play how they want despite achieving everything in game) and acceptable (telling me that Fury Warriors were the best class in vanilla, which isn't morally wrong, but yikes).
---
By all means, use meters, but then that always leads to people posting them and drawing direct comparisons. I can't see a piece of gear drop for Warriors without one Fury Warrior we have going on a mathematical tirade, getting the math wrong.
---
Why? You don't need to be 60 to do most of the content in the game. =)
---
It's still 5-7g on my server.
---
Hahah this is true. I would love to play a fury warrior with one, but man it would be hell with the threat.
---
Tell me why it's necessary.
---
&gt;I don't get your point but fun is subjective, especially in harmless cases like these. 
---
If that's the case then fun is me telling people on a forum they don't have to visit that their way of playing is wrong. "Fun is subjective" is a great thought-terminating cliche but not much else. I've seen people rage quit from a game because they didn't get what some guide called their BiS weapon, despite the fact the weapon was from a lower instance than MC, and they've been raiding MC successfully for 2 weeks.

Slideshow
---
Uh just because I prove you wrong
---
Doesnt mean I'm angry
---
BIG YIKES if that's how you feel everytime you're corrected by someone.
---
Lmao post like this make me wanna camp graveyards more often. So what are “you doin now” on your 45th UBRS cause you can’t win the roll on that piece of gear you need cause you can’t find a good group to play with. It’s a game you utter loser. Acting all high and mighty cause he didn’t 1v1 you on your terms. Get fucked.
---
I'm a prot warrior and I always use Blood Fury when it is up. That extra rage helps build aggro on groups and keeps everyone alive. Maybe I've been doing it wrong but if the healer only has to heal me then I feel I'm doing it right.
---
Super easy, and only takes about 25 mins per hour. You just /camp reset if it's not Gorosh, and go again.
---
The reason why it’s karma is the mage was killing people outside MC, then the mage got feared to the other side of the MC entrance and zoned in. The mage then got saved to someone else’s molten core raid id.
---
TLDR: karma for killing and gets locked to molten core
---
I had a mage in greens wanna AoE pull UD Strat.
---
I let him try ONCE and after we all got back intold em to let me pull or gtfo my group.
---
This ain't SM anymore.
---
Dont have one
---
Loot gets replaced
---
It’s gotta be because it looks like we’re getting our shit kicked in. All of a sudden we take a few “hits” from a “mob” and it’s like “oh shit, an add peeled off, better keep him alive”
---
What addon to you guys use to save and switch gear sets? I need one for aoe grinding on my mage with int and Stam gear, then a set for raids that is glass cannon
---
I mean for me if skull is the first mob to die that’s a win.  I love to chain pull and aoe pull but skull needs to die before aoe that gives me a chance to build threat before everything chases squishes. 
---
Even if I’m not aoe pulling if a tank marks a target there’s good reason. Like for example they shield bash healers or they do crazy damage or they do aoe dmg on melee. Killing these mobs first means less down time for heals and faster clears for teams. It’s a no brainer or atleast should be. No one wants to full clear BRD in 4 hrs. They want to do it in 1 if possible but it’s not if everyone kills a different mob on their own lol. Idk that’s my .02$
---
TLDR doesn’t matter if people open with different mobs like casters to pull to group with kicks or w.e as long as the marked target dies before non marked targets. I play melee too I don’t like to attack shield wearing mobs if there’s a caster but sometimes I have to.
---
"stares in visible confusion"
---
I have yet to see anyone cc anything in that raid. Just pull it all and mow it down. If you bring somewhat competent people you dont need cc. Guess we know what kinda groups he runs with.
---
I actually swam there waaay back in vanilla, so seeing this post is really bringing back the nostalgia.

**Horde or Alliance - US - Any Server - PvE**

*Here's the rub:* I bet on the wrong horse out of the gate. I'm looking to completely Re-Roll with a new group of folks, hit 60 within 4-5 weeks, and start raiding with you ASAP. I'm in my mid-30s and I'm an old school, old timey raider that isn't looking to waste anyone's time. I want to find a fun group of friendly people that don't have all the time in the world to play, but still take their raiding seriously!
---
**Who Are You?**
---
* Semi-Hardcore or "Mediumcore"
---
* Not pushing World Firsts or Speed Runs
---
* Healthy PvE Servers Only - No RP or PvP
---
* Looking for solid, high attendance members
---
* Raids after 6PM PST, or Anytime on Weekends
---
*No fuss, no muss. All I'm asking is to hold a slot for me, cause I'll get there. I'm primarily looking for find a solid fit at this point in time. So Either Faction, and Class is Largely Negotiable (RDPS or Healer, most likely). Upstart Guilds that haven't started raiding, but fit my times are more than welcome to reach out. I'm Bear#2222 on Discord.*

---
Why?
---
I leveled with a pala Tank, good Thing was, je had to sit down after every pull aswell
---
Super easy, thats why majority of Hunters won the Duel agianst Mages in tipsout 50k Tournament.
---
I'm pulling 93 - 97 percentiles with 3k mana (more buffed) and I don't have to mana pot any more.
---
If you're in a greened out guild yes, 3k mana may have to be stretched.
---
TL:DR I farmed my own Chest solo because what's been said is right - you need 8/8 to replace the chest. At the same time I don't want drama. Hence the solos.
---
I tank and I love it. It's my group. Always. Even if I join last I am now the de facto leader. Yes. You are correct. You are expected to know everything. That's fine. Watch a 5 minute YouTube on new dungeons. That's part of the role. You set the pace. It's literally your show.
---
I have found that to be a successful pug tank I am not to view the dungeon's mobs as my opponents. My own ragtag team of face rolling idiots auto following me and wiping cheeto dust onto their shirt before hastily pressing an "oh shit" ability are the true enemies. Light up that unmarked mob. Pull aggro. I'll peel it off you. I'll take that aggro. I'll watch that mana bar and all surroundings. My shithead radar is strong. I am a finely honed instrument of daycare support. Bring it, puggle-fucks.
---
I keep my 20slotter on my normally. That way I don’t feel bad when I would normally have to lose a bag.

The gap comes from the fact that the video is talking about a private server. These were all based off of guesswork and changes made after TBC patch which increased rep gains by a lot (not in the patch notes).

---
Some of the best experiences I’ve had in WoW are chill raids. It might not be feasible to run pug MCs depending on your server, but pug UBRS is certainly easy and popular.
---
Anyway, lead the raid, make the loot completely fair (roll mainspec), distribute crafting mats fairly etc, and do it on a regular schedule. You’ll make easy friends, loads of people will get the loot they need, and you’ll be “that guy” that does the chill raids.
---
It’s probably better once you have a base of semi geared people and you can do MC or Ony or something with a bigger group and cooler loot.
---
In a world or reserved loot, elite raiders, cliques and gatekeeping, a free for all raid is a lot of fun for peeps that might not otherwise get to do it.
---
You do need to raid lead properly so you want to know what’s up with each boss and how to delegate to the tanks and heals and decursing mages etc.
---
I plan on doing this once my alt is leveled because  raiding with a guild on my main and can’t spoil my lockouts.
---
I'm not OP but that read clearly as a joke
---
What do you mean? Now you can finally play the game
---
Nahh, shits fine. This is how markets are meant to work.
---
They keep the price where they need to be not perpetually high.
---
I've seen one in probably around 70 runs, lost it to another fury war. The RNG feels wonky for gorosh, I won't seem him for 15+ runs then I'll see him like every other run
---
Yep. More tank damage = more threat = more dps damage. And the DPS are often not going full apeshit because they don't want to pull threat.
---
I know this is not of much help accomplishing it now, but back in wow I used an addon that did just that when I was raiding. So it was possible then so it quite possibly could be done now. Beyond that I'm not much help, sorry.
---
Interestingly I have cleared Dmw 4 times (first one at lvl 55 with no 60s in group) but haven’t stepped into mc yet since classic
---
I have been played vanilla on PvP server. I do not  remember such etiquette on the world mining, but it is usually the case in dungeon mining.
---
If you don't like gamers you should look into leaving gaming related subs.
---
Report, ignore and move on. Unfortunately there's not much else you can do. 
---
I feel like there's more to this story though... I've never heard of anyone getting this much hate just for leaving a guild.
---
&gt; But once a high level player is there, every caution and standard practice goes out the window.
---
As a tank, I've been on guild (or otherwise) "fun runs" with higher level characters before on close to half a dozen recent occasions, in three major instances; Razorfen Kraul, Razorfen Downs, and the Scarlet Monastery Cathedral.  In only one case did we wipe twice, and both of those were my own fault.
---
This type of instance run can work, however there need to be a few major conditions.
---
a}  The players involved need to be intimately familiar with the content in question, almost to the point of boredom.
---
I've been doing Cathedral runs, at various points, for 13 years now.  It also isn't an instance which requires a lot of aoe/multiple pulling, or really any kind of exceptional measures whatsoever.  The only tricks to it are not pulling the entire population down on your head, not pulling Mograine early, and the tank making sure that Mograine doesn't get loose while the DPS kill Whitemane.
---
b}  The players involved need to have a high level of skill.
---
While I still make stupid mistakes at times to the same degree as anyone, at least based on the feedback I've received, I'm inclined to think of myself as one of the more competent tanks on Remulous.  I believe constant practice is very important.
---
You might think that the rules are being thrown out the window, but in situations where this type of run is conducted properly, that isn't really what is happening at all.  The rules are still being followed; it's just that they are with a high degree of fluidity and speed, because the people in question are sufficiently familiar with the content, their roles, and (ideally) each other, (at least as players) that delays and pauses are not necessary to the same degree.
---
c}  There ideally has to be intense trust and familiarity between the players involved.
---
As someone who played a deep Survival Hunter in vanilla, and who primarily plays a 31 point Prot warrior in Classic, I am normally one of the slowest, most defensive, and most rules-dominated players of this game that you are likely to find; to the point where I expect that many people here would accuse me of being just plain bad.
---
So I understand very well that slow, careful pulling, with breaks for caster mana, careful target selection, allowing the tank to generate aggro before the DPS begin firing etc...all of those things are very necessary.
---
In the right situation, however, when I'm among friends, I have a good healer, and I also know that my DPS aren't going to act like idiots, I can still be persuaded to take my shield off, use my 2h, and be faster, more relaxed, and less formal.
---
Report, report, report. I went thru 3 guilds before landing one that wasn’t full of dickheads. Look up your new guilds info, either here, discord or blizzard forums. Those that have robust no fuckwit policies will say so in thier rules and regs.
---
So I've noticed this for the windfury, or so I think. I have not done any actual data mining of any kind but I start to feel like windfury doesn't work sometimes, so I switch to rockbiter and then back to reset it. It seems to work, though I was using it more as a mental reset after getting frustrated. Since windfury is random its like taking a break from the slot machines.
---
I'll be interested to see what data you find!
---
We've gone whole days without seeing him, it's pretty ridiculous. 
---
Part of me thinks he shows up more on certain days, but I haven't been keeping good enough track to claim it as such.
---
Probably tunneled a little and didn't realize why he wasn't hitting very hard. I was running around the other day questing and started fighting a naga and was like "why am I not doing shit for damage? Why is this naga I've killed a dozen times hitting me like a truck!?"  
---
After he killed me I realized I forgot I had rez sickness.
---
Shit happens :)
---
The math is incorrect. The expectation is for it to happen less than 0.3% for all series of 26 swings. So that leaves more than 99.7% series of 26 swings where you do get one or more proc. We're talking close to 9000 swings. If you swung them back to back with a 3.6 speed two hander, it would take 9 hours.
---
Yea you bring up a lot of good points, I guess I’m just wondering if spending DKP on those non set piece resto epics are worth it right now OR if MC is still new enough that I should simply take a get all I can get approach
---
For instance I got the Salamander Scale legguards the other night and they are itemized so much better than T1 or T2 legs, but I might end up in a situation where I have 3 epic healing legs which just feels greedy and strange. Having tier gear feels better for completionist sake but other than stats it doesn’t feel like an upgrade
---
Both are BiS Tank pieces lol

Go to smoulder web , horde smashin alliance puss all day
---
Holy shit Grobnar, that totem is plenty polished you can fucking chill bro.
---
I get tired of tanking after a while.  It gets extremely old almost dying every other pull while the healer's mana is at full.  Idk if theyre watching netflix or what.  When I bring it up, I get told to pull more.  Then 3/5 people die and I logout.    
---
Good healers are hard to find, but good dps is insanely difficult to find.  Being a DPS isnt always about balls to the wall dmg.  this shit isnt retail man.  Wait for 3 sunders or at least a maul on my druid before you multishot for 1000 and for some reason refuse to feign then continue to rage in chat while I refuse to yo-yo run back and forth to get mobs.
---
Report them in game and compile an email out of game with screenshots (?) if you have them, if not try as best you can to narrow down the time fram of said chats to help Blizz in their investigation.
---
Good thing you left, sounds like a horrible place to call home!!
---
Ps: there should be guidelines on how to move forward with this on the official forums/site.
---
This is the kind of stuff I like to see :)
---
Hunter 8/8 is bis by far.
---
I actually came from Stalagg lol. Where STV had ganking parties against the alliance and level 60 shamans sitting in badlands ready to grief people by the rock elementals. Those 15K que times ultimately did it for me to move.
---
That’s scrub stuff. The real pros only do red quests because they give better xp!
---
I tank because I'm too impatient to spam in lfg for ages, not gonna lie. I have a few good healers and dps on my lists which helps. Eventually you'll meet enough people that you don't need to pug which is great
---
It's all about the colour contrasts, the deep oranges of Durotar with the yellow barrens.
---
Then you go past the back entrance to Orgrimmar and, I'm Alliance but credit where it's due, Orcs have their architecture down.
---
Then Southfury River, Ashenvale on one side, Azshara on the other. Mm.
---
Going over the Lumber Camp and as a night elf you consider what you just thought about Orgrimmar and think "Yeah, but eff those orcs!"
---
Then segueing into the fel greens and oranges of Felwood and the ancient Might Elf ruins.

Rokdelar is so much easier than 8/8. No point in saving dkp for it over set pieces.

---
Yea exactly, like for most classes getting all your T1 is the simplest / makes the most sense in terms of marginal upgrades in say Agi or damage mitigation (although less more nuanced I know), but for Shaman there’s the weird items like I listed in my post that seem outright better. I guess I just keep raiding and try and collect 8/8 EF, 2/8 T2, and all three of those non set epics so I can really optimize but that just feels like a ton of gear / DKP, not to mention OS if I want to PvP efficiently.
---
I've run UD like 20 times for the cape, these gloves dropped like every single run..
---
Yup. I hit level 60 on friday. Rolled to prot spec and got my pre raid bis over the weekend. I'm no stranger to tanking, but it's just becoming too demanding. I cant enjoy my game time because its spent trying to deal with said scenarios. Constantly asking "give me 5sec for aggro" "dont pull" etc .... People just rushed me along all weekend and it sucked. I like to take my time, but everyone's got the speed run mentality and if they miss out on a piece of gear, its game ovee...  thinking of rolling back to dps.
---
&gt; Any combination of outcomes on 26 swings has a tiny chance of occurring; having specific effects totally nullify the chances of something happening is something else.
---
No, if we were to reverse this, you have a 99.9% chance to get a series of 26 swings with at least one windfury proc. 
---
You cant dispel ghost wolf by casting Stormstrike by the way.

That's fine though. At least the gear is being used. Seems senile to just DE stuff.

The issue with that is we can’t collect payment until they’re already there, and then they have no reason to pay.

We must be better than the mages. Our class utility is for the group. We summon demons to do our bidding, we aren’t evil.

I'm not sure what you're talking about, but if I'm a healer, and an item is a big upgrade for me, I'm needing on it. That's how WoW loot has worked since forever.

You need to get yourself eskhandar's right claw.  If I remember correctly, you still do full damage when disarmed with a fist weapon too, you just can't use abilities that require a mh.

This is wrong. It puts the healer unbelievably behind and any extra damage the DPS haphazardly take has to be neglected to heal through a self-inflicted mortal strike.
---
Ayyy, it took 25 minutes for the victim blaming. Reddit's slowing down!
---
Your Cache folder holds nothing important to addons or settings. It is recommended to delete it if other things are weird, like bad item info.
---
It also keeps them from figuring out what got them spotted and banned/making workarounds. I know the woweconomy subreddit was super up in arms over multiboxing botter druids in retail recently, and this is the reason that has been stated as to why they're not banned as they're found. Best not to give them any recourse to recover.
---
Also: people thinking that it’s “hard” are misguided.  It’s pure luck, not skill.
---
What is it, exactly, that you're hoping to see when you set your cvars?

Yeah, as an example i experienced yesterday there is a MASSIVE difference in DMN between groups that can CC and groups that cant.

I didn’t have axes trained. Couldn’t even equip it until flying to Ironforge.

Got my 15th kill on him today. No chest so far.
---
121 kills on Angerforge so a few more than that on Arena I guess.
---
People who say they've seen it 3 times... fucking give me some of that luck.
---
Yea and truth be told fights don’t get much longer in BWL until Chrom or Nef so the only real set bonus I’m eyeing right now is 3/8 T2 which is obviously unattainable for now. Plus I just feel like the T2 helm and T2 pants are just inferior to Salamander Scale / Helm of the Lifegiver which just feels awkward. I guess just collect what I can get but it feels like a DKP sink and I was hoping there was a bit more refined / explained BiS phase 1 list
---

its 50 rep per turnin (55 for humans)

assuming you need 21000 rep you would need 420 stacks get it or 8400 cloth 
---
just divide the amount of rep you need by 50 to get the number of stacks. round up
---
?
---
Pretty cool playstyle
---
I got that my first run at level 52 :D
---
I keep forgetting to go back to Stormwind and learn that. I'm level 55 now.
---
No it's CPU lag, it has utterly nothing to do with networking. It happens when the server is overloaded aka too many players, too many instances per machine etc. 
---
Also, i'm not 'complaining' about anything. You are wrong. It's not an opinion. It's on 15 year old videos \*proving\* this was intentional behavior. 
---
Blizzard staff even said so.
---
It's also astonishing the amount  Warrior "Tanks" I see that don't use Sunder.
---
The longer MC goes the more likely you have folks (especially if there's low turnover in the raid) that simply don't need tier pieces since they already have it.  
---
I'd say if you're in a guild that is comfortably clearing AND they don't mind if you hoard DKP (and thus hinder the 'progress' of your character) why not save DKP for some of the real gear in BWL- some of that stuff is a much stronger upgrade.   Maybe do some rock-bottom bids on the t1 gear if you don't feel great about it so you get it at a bargain
---
I guess I don't count any of that as social interaction.
---
To me, social interaction has nothing to do with the game, like talking shit in barrens, small talk in G chat, shooting the breeze with randos. To me forming groups is bussiness... as far as the game goes, im fine with it being automated.
---
Probably going to be a pain to read that but here's my take: Ele Shamans are versatile but they're probably one of the least straightforward specs in the game, and people do tend to play them like other "pure" spellcasters. But Elemental isn't a traditional caster, it's basically a battlemage type class, you need to be 20 yards or less from your target to be able to use your full toolkit, and while you don't have a wand, you still have a weapon and an offhand slot. A big mistake would be to think you should never melee as an Ele. Fast 1h weapon + flametongue + searing totem rank 1 for some insane Broken Tooth-level spell pushback on any caster. You can purge, use shocks and totems, you don't necessarily need to cast much to beat someone, especially if you have Elemental Mastery, all you need is to find a 1.5 sec window to double crit combo your opponent while he can't kick you. 
---
I have Hand of Edward the Odd which can make my next spell cast instant so I have even more incentive to melee hit between my spells when possible (ofcourse against rogue/warriors you'd rather just kite if possible, against Priest you'd want to drop Tremor before getting close to them, etc). But any fast weapon works for pushback. Ele Shamans can be optimized and played as pure caster, and in some pvp scenarios it's the best way to play them, but if you want to get the most out of your Ele in 1v1 you'll sometimes need to play in melee range. 
---
Most people would have you think that "weave spells between melee hits" is an Enhancement Shaman thing but nop, it's a Shaman thing in general and an Ele should sometimes weave melee hits between spells in pvp! I mean, unlike Enhance, as Ele you actually have the choice between casting or going up close. If you're sitting there spamming your hardcasts while wearing cloth and no shield, waiting to get kicked, you're playing shaman wrong, YOU are the disruptive class, use your grounding and shock wisely against casters, use your slow wisely against melees, use your shocks, purge, totems, weapon, Lightning Shield to do damage on the run. Fakecast -&gt; stop to kick opponent -&gt; drop grounding -&gt; chain lightning into shock will often work against casters. Melees who get the jump on you you need Nature's Swiftness and/or consumables/trinkets/grenades and/or you'll need to juke them (which can be hard with spellbatching). That is until you get your ZG class trinket, at which point they'll just kill themselves attacking you ;)

Then you have hybrid Ele/Enh builds if you really want that 2 hander. 31/20/0 is a viable pvp build even though it's hard to gear for and probably not as well-rounded as 30/0/21 or 31/0/20 builds, mostly because you'll need a lot of hit and spell hit gear to compensate for the loss of the points in Resto if you want to be capped (any "weave spells and melee hits" spec will have this issue though). But it has all the melee mechanics of an Enh Shaman except Parry (so, 2handers and Flurry mostly, then you have Elemental Devastation builds too), while also having Elemental Fury and Elemental Mastery which are more reliable than 2H windfury procs and work better with your endgame gear (I have T2.5 in mind). But why not both, right? You can have the 2h WF procs AND the big CL crits. Realistically this is a build for well geared Shamans in later phases, usually you'll want spellpower on your gear and a weapon that scales with spellpower. Neretzek used to work well for this kind of Shaman as its proc scaled with spellpower. Or you can go the 1h approach, usually you'll combine it with trinkets like Darkmoon Card:Maelstrom or such (let's see if they scale with +sp in Classic). It's not optimal but you really do feel disruptive when mages run away from you to escape windfury and get one shot by chain lightning, and when melees run to you to stop you from casting and you just WF proc them into a shock crit.
---
Well I'm all about that weave melee and spells playstyle and imo, Shaman does it best.
---
That is both really funny and really impressive. Glad your guild was like "eh fuck it, tag along and level it up, meters be damned." lol
---
By *far* the biggest contribution is simple: the game at this patch level is absurdly easy compared to what came before it. Seriously, people who weren't playing back then have no idea how much harder places like UBRS or Scholo were back then.. even as 15 and 10 mans respectively. And that's not including the *many* tweaks and lowering of difficulty/buffing of classes and abilities were put in place from patches prior.
---
My first UBRS run after the nerfs we were all super nervous going in as a 10 man instead of 15, debating over if we should run our fully epic'd out mains through first to see what the difference were... only to laugh at the insanely simple pulls and no need for CC 99% of the time. I still remember heading to Draks room and looking at the trash, saying "wait.. this is all there is now? Hah!".
---
I mean to be clear.. all of that is fine, the game frequently crossed the line from "challenge" to "punishing" back then.. that's a big reason things were changed. But so many people are acting like people playing today are vastly more skilled than the people from back then which simply isn't true. The information you need is a lot more accurate and accessible, but that isn't stopping 9/10 people I run in to being just as stupid and ignorant about the game as they were 15 years ago. Most of them don't so much as know the boss fights, let alone what gear to wear or why they're wearing it.
---
Lol can confirm AR feels like a dead server.  A dungeon group is a pain to fill.
---
Really enjoyed this thread....interesting data!
---
No you can't
---
Agree for dungeon mining but haven’t seen in mining out in the wild.
---
Level 60 Fence-sitting shitheel Feral druid here. Even though I lean towards bear form/tanking talents, I'm still really struggling with the decision between [Blackhand's Breath](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13965) and [Mark of Tyranny](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13966/mark-of-tyranny) (both are BiS for cat and bear respectively, I have to pick one or the other.) I guess what my decision boils down to is: is it easier to find raid spots as a bear druid or a cat druid?
---
That's a lot cooler than my "aggro one and run away forever until his pals leash" strategy.
---
When they added focus targets it helped me a lot as a tank. Put healer as focus so their mana bar is always in my face.
---
I mean, I’m not really that much of a victim lol. No I called them out before I left, basically just mentioned to someone else that I was going to report them. Didn’t really think that was pertinent though
---
Never blamed anyone, just said that there might be more to the story since I've never experienced anything like the OP has mentioned, despite seeing probably close to a thousand people leave their respective guilds. 
---
But it only took 8 minutes for someone to take my post out of context and try push their own agenda. Reddit is doing well it seems.
---
Im a NE warrior too and now I'm curious what your gear set looks like
---
My issue lately is just the attitude people have. 
---
For example, I advertise a Strath Live run needing DPS and get a group. No one asks for quests, but one person asks for the cigar boss as we’re about to pass it. No big deal. Then we get the keys and he basically demands we do mailboxes. I make a comment saying we’re just looking to clear, and he says something along the lines of “well I wouldn’t have asked if I knew you were gonna cry about it”. Like wtf? 
---
Or earlier today when I’m advertising first boss of scholo only. Level 58 boomkin asks for invite, but wants full clear instead. I tell him we’re doing the first boss only and I generally only take 60s to skip some packs, and oooh boy. I’m selfish, classics been out for 2 months and I need to stop taking it so seriously, people need quests done, and etc.
---
Like I’ve tanked about 80% of my wow life-time(started as prot pally in bc) but this is the first time I’ve started getting very annoyed with the community. About to swap DPS!
---
&gt;We do have fantastic AOE threat
---
I love a good pally tank. By far my best dungeon experience was a pally tank with the full 5p Deathbone set from Scholo, Skull of Flame, and a few spell power pieces. Dude needed minimal downtime, and held threat on everything. At a few points it really felt like retail dungeons, just pull 3 packs, LOS to clump them, then aoe.
---
So they do level resets? I mean that's an option.
---
Not one I'd care for.
---
Minecraft servers do the same thing often.
---
Yeah, the warriors in my guild all have the chest now lmao
---
I used Shadowcraft and the Darkmantle for most of Vanilla, the proc is just absurdly good. Plus for whatever reason the game just never wanted to drop rogue epics which was kind of annoying but such is life, I did get a Perditions!
---
In classic I'm up to four piece T1, but if I could actually get SC to *drop* I would absolutely still be playing about with the 6 piece and figuring out if it was worth dropping or not.
---
It's so deep you're more enh than resto for that talent.
---
this is life as a ginger as well
---
Sometimes I want to dps because as dps I can focus on things like snaring runners and generally helping clean up the pull with utility, and the the tank focus on keeping the healer alive. If I pull aggro I can easily switch to shield and bunker up for a minute if I need to. Just the other night when a pull went bad I was able to aoe taunt and shield wall and me and the healer managed to kill all  remaining mobs after a serious abortion of a pull. When I'm tanking I am so busy trying to maintain threat on every mob that it's hard to keep track of where each dps is aggroing the mobs I'm not hitting off to.
---
happens with gouge too, lost count of the amount of times a mob has not only hit me after I gouged but also ran through behind it. pretty annoying.
---
I don’t know if it’s on my end but you might want to turn down your graphics settings.
---
Omg your frame rate..
---
Jesus Christ fuck off and let people play the game however the fuck they want. Not everyone wants to run BRD a hundred times because some spreadsheet indicates an imperceptible advantage.
---
This kind of bad luck sucks. I saw it my first three runs doing ud side. :/
---
Hamstring? Feign death ice trap. Walk away and kite.
---
What in the world....Just to show i'm not crazy, here's my screenshot haha.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/7dS4VQ0.png](https://i.imgur.com/7dS4VQ0.png)
---
Yeah money literally couldn't buy what I/most of us have as a setup today.. the technology just didn't exist.
---
Hell just something as simple as a higher resolution, you can *see* so much more! I have a 34" ultrawide, the amount of screen real estate is absurd.
---
maybe, so I thought the Halloween candy that made you orange gave you the fright debuff ability. Mobs hitting you will be affected by fright. Except after my candy ran out  I was still seeing the Fright debuff on mobs occasionally. :/
---
Well depending on the healer, it's not exactly very tough.
---
For example, Priests; 5/5 in silent resolve is still quite an advantage to dps.
---
Thank you sir but I will continue with my preferred method of SMASHING tab 3 4 5 6 keys
---
&gt; or a cat druid?
---
I mean some raids want a bear as a fourth tank, I don't know of anyone actively looking for a kitty. If raid spot is important I would choose Bear out of the 2. IMHO opinion resto would be easiest to find a raid spot though.
---
Gromgol for sure. I fuckin hate having Kargath as my hearth set. I know dungeons are all there but literally nothing else is
---
Oh, for sure, just trying to help. As an alliance Warlock, all the undead are the bane of my existence.
---
I'd play undead more for their animations than WoTF.
---
Umm... you do know retail tanking pretty much is chaos too right. Only difference is it works out more often.
---
Wolves eat rabbits. Does that count?
---
Oh, that's a tough choice. You can always sit on it and see how you feel in a few weeks? Or you could look at which one would be easier to replace? Or you could consider which one would be useful for the other spec? Both are good for PvP too. 
---
Good luck.
---
I haven't had to summon randoms yet, I've had a bunch of messages and If im saying put i say "sure i'm at x if you find 2 people will to come help" and then never hear back.
---
are you braindead or just trolling? 3 mobs are mid-swing when he vanishes the first time.
---
Shut up and piss off.
---
Darkshore was so underrated in vanilla. Now it’s widely known as the best leveling zone for alliance. It’s like ungoro tier or hinterlands for horde.
---
That would be huge fam. Let me know in game what I can do
---
Even better Alliance :P
---
Yeah I never implied any wrongdoing, I just figured there was more to the story since I've literally never seen anything like what the OP described over years of WoW.  
---
The OP then clarifies that he did call out the guild members and threaten to report them, which likely prompted the outage, and I can understand since people can react negatively to something like that. There was absolutely wrong with what OP did when he called the guild out, and I was just seeking clarification since it's quite an extreme scenario if it happened out of the blue. 
---
Apparently that was close enough to victim blaming for /u/lukn, so I'm guessing he's projecting or something since any request for clarification is somehow an affront to the 'victim' (that doesn't even consider himself a victim).
---
Enjoy your *inferior gaming experience, you macroless pleb!* I mean... each to their own. Best of luck to ya!
---
I don't know much about cooking or fishing sorry. I bought food from mages. I pay 10s a stack and I've never had someone say no. Most of them give it free. But that only works if you're in a populated area.
---
Hey I think you hit me in the face the other day.
---
Congrats :)
---
THING WRONG WITH ME
---
Are they completely random drops off anything? Or how does it work?
---
Blink in and keep cone of cold up at the whole fight, hes 60% slowed and you can do whatever you want in that point.
---
Lol I suppose I don’t have a good comeback to this.  I played as a warrior once and did really like it.
---
I did the same one! Bout as detailed as I can do haha. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/8ySB54F.jpg
---
Yeah a raid group of 60s held TM hostage on my server. Even tho we flew to UC to spam Horde just didn’t care. At lest not the ones that could do something. 
---
So we had to fight with 10 60s about 20 40-50s and the rest was 30 and under. 
---
Didn’t get too far against 40 60s. 
---
Shame on us shame on the Horde!
---
A good shaman knows how to totem twist
---
I think they "fixed" that.  Now it seems that if you aggro multiple mobs of the same type and kite one, the rest will follow until said mob is dead.
---
Do you mean traveler’s backpacks? Journeyman are 14slot
---
Blizzard just posted this is not a bug and matches the reference client.
---
That is super impressive. I knew exactly what I was doing going in, had some addons and still only hit 40 with like 3 days played.
---
Because every guild I've joined already has three other tanks that never show up to raid but I can't get a tank spot even though it's been my main role for over a decade
---
Yeah because it's ridiculously easy and can be done semi-afk while tabbed out half the time.
---
If what he says is even true regarding the vendor price (is he getting that number from private servers where they sell for 45s each or legit old vanilla?) they're still very much worth it. Reliable 50+ gold per hour that takes no skill and no specific gear or talents. There's not going to be that huge chance at a big BoE epic payout, but they're consistent and easy. 
---
The diary isn't that common anyway. It's the least common item you'll be getting. Listed at under 2% chance on wowhead. I have my rogue parked in BRD at the moment, and just log in for about 10-15 minutes and do it in that short span. I feel like I get a diary every other circuit, if that. A circuit takes about 8-9 minutes as long as you don't have to wait for vanish. Theoretically, I'd end up with 5 or 6 in an hour at that rate, and even if they sold for 50s each, you're losing out on about 3 gold...
---
Yep, fixed.
---
I mean we are talking about a game that people said were the best game ever for about 7 years now. 
---
I think it would have been impossible to get into classic without high expectations.
---
What can I say, I prefer decisive victories.
---
Me on my warrior at 41 with like a week worth of playtime.
---
Same. This was not a thing. This is a thing op does and no one else.
---
&lt;Intoxicated&gt; - Horde - Fairbanks - is looking for late night raiders on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 12:00 -3:00 AM for our core raid group. We’re in need of all classes for any roles! Feel free to message me here, on discord or in game!

Akwar
---
I waited till 53 and I regret it. You can easily do the first parts 51/52 but make sure you let people know that you want to do BRD 'early' or something like that.
---
This on a Monday? I dare you to try on a Tuesday.
---
Oh no doubt man. 1.12 had super nerfs and made things a lot easier.
---
&gt;Hit it on the head. I love the phrase "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast." I use it all the time. 
---
Thats a cool saying. I'm gonna start using it. 
---
&gt;but also use FAST heals which typically are less mana efficient.
---
*LaughsInHolyPally*
---
That is literally how threat works. If someone else pulls, the tank will have 0 threat on those mobs. If the tank taunts and takes damage from that mob, the healer has to heal him. The healer will now be second on threat to all the mobs that the hunter pulls. If the hunter uses feign death, the mobs will go to the next person on their aggro table. That's the healer.
---
Ill stare deep into the eyes of my healer at the end of the fight as they sit down to drink. I’ll dark part what I can and life tap the rest.... as my manA reaches full and my health low I immediately bandage. The healer continues staring into my eyes... he’ll watch one tick and by two he’s casting a heal.
---
Yeah, I've had this happen a few times to me but seemingly only while doing BRD pickpocket farming. I've had pretty decent luck while leveling I suppose.
---
It only ever seems to happen on the same types of mobs he's pickpocketing in the video though. It hasn't happened to me yet on the Ring of Law spectators or the mobs just below that near the shadowforge lock.
---
Leave the thread up so people with similar problems can come here and read the solution.
---
Lmao correct.
---
All the tryhards rolled Alliance, at least on my server. Alliance got literally every server first and successfully raided Horde capitals whereas Horde hasn't even tried.
---
Makes sense. So what I'm doing right now isn't too far from what I should be doing then.
---
Old school, maybe, but I use two /eq macros to do this. You can look up the item ID on wowhead to save space if you're running short on characters.
---
We do that because some of you are silly and can't manage your resources as well as others. Had several of these warlocks that were adamant that they didnt need healing, but died constantly because they tapped down to barely any health and would keel over from any kind of AoE or overaggro.
---
  
---
Doesn't matter whether you suck or are godlike, we just cba to deal with it on the off chance that you suck :p  
---
^Also ^I ^sugarcoated ^the ^hell ^out ^of ^it, ^there ^are ^more ^bad ^warlocks ^than ^good.
---
Sounds like your information it right. It's not linear. Explanation in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLD12oUwJoE&amp;feature=share
---
lol, this comment is lowkey insane but I enjoy it because of what it represents.
---
So I'm gonna lay down some hard truth, shadowpriest to shadowpriest: You are playing a suboptimal spec when compared to the pure dps classes.  
---
Don't delude yourself that people should be fine with one of the dps in a 5 man group drinking for 30 sec after every pull because we're adults and this game takes way too much time as it is. Be very aware that a mage can walk into the 55+ dungeons in his quest greens and perform OK but a shadowpriest is gonna suck in those circumstances.  
---
You basically need to tryhard to make your spec work as well as the other dps classes - get to 60, get your BoEs and experiment with mixing them with stat heavy pieces and downrank SwP and use less MBs to make damn sure you're not OOM after every pull. And don't think about stepping inside a raid without Major Mana Pots and Runes, otherwise you'll regret it when you see your name at the very bottom of the dps meter.  
---
If you get any elitist being shitty about priests only being healers it's best to disarm them with jokes or being nice, and know that starting your own groups is a great way to run dungeons!
---
At least you get invites "Sorry we already have one hunter, fuck off"
---
Ummm the bigger one looks suspicious, hope you don’t have any black neighbours
---
That's true too. Most people in vanilla really only kept tabs on the guilds on their server which, in some cases, wasn't very populated versus other servers. All these people, spamming the instances every week; isn't surprising there's lots of legendary drops.
---
I am also considering rerolling because of this. These people all come from retail and probably never experienced vanilla before. They're used to just all out nuking the moment a tank initiates a fight and they're unable adapt to the vanilla dungeon style.
---
Fact, you don't need any talent point in Holy to be able to heal in any dungeons. All that matters is to have the right gear and the right methodology for healing (ie: using Clique addon to cast heal by mouseover on unitframes).
---
Not exactly until the mob dies but you gotta run really really far now
---
No, you just understand the context and how unreasonable it is and realize theyre most likely not serious. Thats what i assume unless they make it clear they're not joking. Then i laugh in their face if they arent joking lol
---
P1 - Stand on her side to avoid breath/tail and do low dps, don’t pull agro
---
P2 - Split the raid - half on each side, spread 8 yards to avoid fireball AOE damage, kill whelps and nuke the boss. Wherever she flies to, she may randomly deep breath, travelling directly across the room from where she is. This will kill you if you stand in it.
---
P3 - Let tanks establish threat again, she will AOE fear periodically and the cracks on the ground will cause fire damage.
---
if you can’t parse understated sarcasm without it being bookended by emojis or unbearable html-style redditisms like “/s” then I struggle to imagine you’ve ever really understood a novel with jokes in it or anyone irl who’s been sarcastic without putting on a theatrical chandler voice
---
Someones gonna be at the top.
---
All I'm reading here is a bunch of bad tanks.
---
First: Don't bring any dps to your PUG that isn't a mage or warlock.
---
Second: Don't be a bad dungeon tank like warrior or feral, go paladin tank.
---
Third: Bubble pull 40 mobs, have the mages nova when bubble ends / consecration is down.
---
Fourth: When nova ends have another mage nova, begin massive DPS.
---
Fifth: ??????
---
Sixth: Don't come to the forums to bitch about tanking for pugs if you aren't going to put in the effort to make sure your PUG run goes smoothly for you.
---
\-49 Pally tank
---
Seems to me this might be a side effect from the long spell batching window. It allows certain effects that are in order to occur simultaneously. 
---
So you stealth, but mob pops an instant cast thereby stunning them and breaking your stealth simultaneously.
---
This was a known bug in vanilla.  There were many attempted fixes.
---
Are you really comparing a resto druid healing to a shaman attempting to tank? Go someplace.
---
Why do I need to be liked by people who aren't as good at the game as me or as informed overall? Particularly on servers I don't play on when I already have a guild to run with.
---
Just trying to figure out what's at stake.
---
DAE hate pirate server minmaxers??? xddd
---
I'm a big proponent of letting anyone roll on whatever they want, especially if they mention it beforehand. People are just salty about not winning rolls.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean for it to sound like the guide was bad or wrong. Just that I won't ever do that. Harpies are the fucking worst and I actively avoid that particular area in general if I can.
---
No, it is not a good idea.
---
That's fucking disgusting.
---
I played vanilla as a miner and this was not a thing.
---
Cool my rogue friend off tanks in Ubrs . Seen warlocks off tank it too.  Sorry to say a shaman off tanking in UBRS is nothing special. MT it and let me know please

Of the eagle is always good for cloth, leather items of eagle or monkey, mail of monkey or of bear, and plate of the bear.

For the Alliance!!
---
Wtf?? 49 holy Paladin rolling on that shit? What’s he even doing in that dungeon?? Little dress wearing light wielding weirdo would make me end it all 😭
---
Thanks I appreciate it! I’m really working trying to lvl my hunter fast! My goal is 5 days played but I know that’s pretty optimistic... lol. I feel what you’re saying though, I was a little over 3 days on my rogue when I hit 40. I feel like leveling another character on classic first has given me a huge boost on just knowledge on leveling faster as this is my first time playing vanilla.
---
No, It's Helm of destruction.
---
Pre-shielding is a terrible idea if the tank has no rage
---
Frost Mage can perform extremely well even with their blue BiS gear in every single phase of classic without the need for raid gear. They have so much utility and damage.
---
Shadow Priests are next, being able to be insanely good with tailor and dungeon gear (but mana hungry). They are undisputed best 1v1 class by pure damage though. 
---
Next is Rogues, but you'll definitely want to do at least MC for Barbarous Blade and Core Hound Tooth, which are weapons that will carry you through the whole game. So will the tier 1 gear. By the time you hit 60 there will be MC pugs on a regular basis. Great at world PVP, not as good in BGs. 
---
Next are Hunters. They absolutely require Tier 1 and a good bow (Rhok'delar) but with this they'll be good throughout. They are awesome in group Pvp and a top tier skilled Hunter will dominate everything. They fall off damage wise between BWL and Naxx but become amazing again in Naxx. 
---
Then you have Druids, who can perform well in the first three phases with simple gear and HotW build. They are top of Warsong Gulch and a good Druid can pull off amazing things. They fall off really hard post-AQ without AQ gear.
---
Finally you have Elemental Shamans. They are harder to gear but have gear options nobody else uses, but they do require some stuff that Mages and Warlocks will want in PvE. And you can't raid as them. Still, they are insanely fun.
---
You can just talk to Kromcrush after you kill king but before you get king buff/tribute to get the third item.
---
OG has two entrances, which makes it kind of impossible to protect. If you have one raid you can just sneak in and kill thrall in a minute or so. Meanwhile if you look at stormwind you basically have to run through the entire city population if you want to get to the throneroom.
---
all my guild mates have baron cloak is it that bad? I passed on all of them since I'm prot and have raid cloak
---
I ran BRD today for 2 hours and at 58 I got a quarter level haha did they run around not killing mobs??
---
This is basically the same thing as the fd bug which blizzard addressed.
---
Basically for each batch there is a que for what takes place, the issue was not that combat wouldn't drop but instead the qued attack would go through before the enemy dropped target, keeping the player in combat. 
---
I'm sure due to vanish placing the player in "stealth" it might make the issue more complicated, maybe the vanish failed because the mobs in the video simply didn't stop targeting the player when they became stealthed and "re aggroed". If that is the case then queing drop target before the player enters stealth in the batch would be the fix. It makes sense seeing how stealth wasn't broken after he used prep but was still in combat, this is my own speculation though.  As someone who's leveling a rogue myself I haven't had this happen yet but I'm hoping it gets fixed.
---
I think a rogue would be a great choice for a casual pvp'er. Not that rogues don't also have a high skill ceiling, but because the entry level is very low. For many people, especially the less amazing ones or those in pve specs, your average cheap/kidney combo can be enough to decide the battle. Gear doesn't need to be anything special either - shadow priests are very similar in being easy to play, hard to master, but they rely way more on gear.  
---
Most other classes have more of a linear skill curve compared to rogues, especially hybrids imo.
---
Bear, eagle, monkey, whale
---
That's what's supposed to happen.
---
You might have brain damage.
---
Delet dis
---
This is what I was looking for before I was going to post this myself. Thank you.
---
Mara is more braindead and DM east is harder and requires to think is what I'm gathering. Feel free to drop by the lock discord for guides etc.
---
If it's like original vanilla MC and Ony will be run through out the game, it'll become less frequent but there will still be guilds farming it and pugs going.
---
You missed a 0 there buddy
---
why would a leveling priest ever have 5/5 silent resolve
---
I imagine it will be far more difficult to find groups for pvp on pve realms. I have no interest in wpvp but it is important for me to be on a pvp realm for groups.
---
Isn’t that phase 3?
---
Re Priest threat. I only have 1 point in threat reduction (most healing priests right now probably do). The way I deal with it is I do not heal right away just as a dps wouldn’t. If I suddenly have to throw out some big heals I will do a pre fade. I am usually the last person to pull aggro. Occasionally it happens but I don’t feel like it’s a huge concern.
---
I do feel your pain and understand where you are coming from. The problem is that tanking in groups OP describes (virtually all of them in my case) is extremely stressful, and the mana of the healer is easily forgotten between all the other things you need to be on top of. One dungeon was literally a hunter multishotting on pull (sometimes pulling ‘for us’), his pet with growl active, the shaman opening with earthshock and the rogue opening with ambush all on different mobs. I for sure did not pay much attention to the healers’ mana bar or my own health bar for that matter, I was trying my best preventing us wiping (we only wiped 3 times in library), so I was very grateful when the healer called for mana break when he needed it and ready if I was unsure/distracted before the pulls.  
---
The morale is playing with bad/ignorant players causes a lot of stress no matter the role.
---
and make using the shard from a player on that same player double damage!
---
???
---
Dude... that is going to save me some cash lol
---
I double checked the sub to see if this was r/casualracism. Took me a minute to realize what the pumpkin on the left actually was. It looks like a confederate flag. Might seriously want to consider smashing the pumpkin first before someone beats you to it and smashes it against your window not knowing what it actually was lol.
---
well that's pretty widely known, isn't it
---
I clearly have no idea what I’m doing here.
---
SM is in no way necessary. I usually skip doing it since its just faster to ignore leveling dungeons.
---
Nope. I just ambushed a mage for 1800 and got the backstab off for another 1200 before he blinked 
---
2 shotting people is hilarious
---
Yeah same I find having roughly 20-25 is plenty for raid night. Plus there's plenty of trash in MC to get more if need be.
---
MIKE WAZOWSKI!
---
please no. Any time you save by raising the threat ceiling and doing more dps is doubled or more by the healer having to spend longer drinking. And that's the best case scenario where it doesn't cause the healer to go oom and then the group wipes.
---
No im sorry but i feel its better for me to get all the ore from a node rather than anyone else. Same way with chests.
---
There are many potions that give sizeable buffs that last an hour long. You can use them at the same time.
---
Timeframe=\=frequency of play. They can be totally unrelated. I could say ive been taking shits for my whole life, doesnt mean i shit all day. 
---
Also when they say “running BRD” its a pretty broad and open-ended statement. I highly doubt they were doing 2 weeks of full runs.
---
Yes youre missing something but its not difficult to figure out the implications...
---
Want your alt to sit safely at the vendor huh, but I think that is outside The guard agro radius and not safespotting.
---
What is your “this”
---
not destroyed. just out of charges. can still be a stat stick or vendored/DE'd
---
Akama
---
Dude I don't know, for all I know you're absolute dogshit since you cannot comprehend why this guy wants to increase his DPS. If you want to be an unlikeable guy keep at it. I do not care.
---
WTF is this bs?
---
No one noticed this before now?
---
Need on BoE epics is pretty standard. I haven't seen one drop and not have everyone need roll on it.
---
Yeah man you play how you want. Some people think the time and the gold in this game need to be optimized for you to enjoy it haha. Grats through man! Bet you’re crushing the meters!
---
My server isn't as full but still is well populated, some prices rose like on arcane crystals but it could have been a coincidence as people are constantly buying those out to raise the price. Devilsaur leather got more expensive for sure but only a few g. Water essence prices rose a bit.
---
I'd be more worried about if queues are coming again
---
What are you referring to?
---
They also fixed a lot of old bugs.
---
We are well past #nochanges.
---
Am I the only one who has noticed the enormous number of Dwarf / Night Elf hunter bots? They're literally everywhere.
---
There are lots of bugs that exist because of their batching system. Cheapshot, vanish, gouge, kidney shot - all of it suffers.
---
However, that problems also impact other classes.
---
It's a cast, it shows up in combat log, and they animate for it.
---
I thiiiiiiiiiink they mean the plane crashed into the side?
---
The tier set might look decent but they are tanking sets. The irony in this post is you’re gonna be wearing half rogue gear and a golden dorky helmet if you aren’t prot
---
Is this Thalnos NA?
---
Grob horde side: lotus 55g, essence of water 18g not sure on the others
---
DEAR BLIZZARD 
---
FIX THE GUARDS 
---
THANKS
---
Imagine thinking PvP is one shotting lowbies who have no chance of ever killing you.
---
I'd love to meet people like this and see what goes through their head.
---
Hey
---
pass that luck over here...I wasn't paying attention in DM E and a/the tanking cloak and ring dropped and I greeded it (i'm prot btw).
---
that stung XD
---
Well it can be casted halfway through a 6 second kidney so I'm pretty sure it's when the yeti gets hit.
---
Mage sword*
---
Than don't come here?
---
of the tiger is also pretty good for rogues and warriors
---
Go pally
---
A lot of people are really fucking bad at the game and this is the only way they can feel powerful or kill someone.
---
You think this is bad, how about they fix hunter. There’s so many bugs that it’s fucking barely playable. This shit is small in comparison, coming from a rogue main
---
Pretty smooth to me
---
Nothing in this game is smooth
---
Expose them to society on here
---
I suggest getting your characters to 35 and getting 250 in professions.
---
Leatherworking, Tailoring, Alchemy all have cooldowns that you can sell for a decent chunk of gold.  This makes your alts generate passive income that turns into a lot over time, especially as you make more alts :)
---
Youre actually at an advantage imo. The rest of us are in blues that took us weeks to farm and then getting into raids where we have to roll against 5 other people in raids that are still “progression content.”
---
Youre gonna get to 60 and be able to get into into these raids in leveling greens when theyre full farm content and most of the people are already geared so you’ll have minimal gear competition. 
---
Im leveling an alt for this exact reason. Youre arguably in a better spot than the rest of us if your end goal is tier 1.
---
Yes he does
---
At least 1 mage rolled saying "imma throw 30 spell power on it"
---
I didn't miss the point I just take a different moral from the story. You are definitely only telling part of the story. If you didn't like what was happening in guild chat and just left none or this would have ever happened. I'm not sure what you did to piss them off but there is more to the story.
---
No, only if they're coded as a pack like the gnoll camps in Westfall, the dragons in Sunken Temple, the King and Observer in DM N etc.
---
Same and not crying. No one calling me a scrub for settling on 2nd best weapon, looking at you DM mace wearing “tanks” lol
---
Heartseeker needs more horde
---
A few rogue questions, when you stealthe and do a /emote command to someone will they be able to see it in the chat? Like "\_\_\_ has waved to you" Also what's better between the two just by itself no set bonus - Shadowcraft leggings or Devilsaur leggings? With the shadowcraft pants on I gain about 25 more agility but lose about .2 crit. With the devilsaur pants on I lose 25 agility but gain +9 AP and .2 crit.
---
Whoops haven't played in a like 2 years bc my pc broke haven't had the cash to replace it id love to play vanilla
---
I did a Google search. All of the wikis just said if you want a raptor mount as a non-Troll horde you just need exalted as darkspear
---
You can change password and it forces log out of all characters.
---
As a healer i would get yelled at when I rolled on upgrades that casters wanted. Don’t know why they feel entitled to loot
---
Yeah, having known bugs in the game wasn’t part of the no changes movement. Blizzard even acknowledged that.
---
got 2 slows tho, shouldn't have problems
---
Even with a Complete BIS, I'm never seen Necropile Shoulders once and only seen Boots once. I'm still 4/5 on Necropile and 5/8 Tier 0 because I'm too lazy to get Pants and Boots (Nercopile is better anyway and BIS Belt is better).
---
I feel attacked.
---
You could block Guild invites in the interface tab and you can also just ignore everybody that whispers you rude things. Not trying to be a dick but a simple google search would’ve told you this. Why bring the drama here?
---
yeah, that and like your contrast is off or something.. looks all whitewashed and just not bright.
---
ahwell, A for effort anyhow.
---
I mentioned it in another comment. 
---
Another guy in the guild asked them to stop, and i said to him I was reporting them. Then I left
---
34 Lower Blackrock Spire runs for Hands of Power.  Never saw them.  On the 35th run a mage and the healer both needed and the mage won them.  At least it didn't go to the healer... I will never go back
---
Are other classes not like this? I’m hating leveling and this seems accurate. Warr is the only thing I’ve leveled so far
---
It's never too early/late to reroll if you're not enjoying your class, I rerolled after reaching lvl 36 on a mage and went to 60 with a rogue instead.
---
As for your last sentence, I have no idea what you think hes stereotyping or what 'motive' you're talking about... do you wear a tinfoil hat?
---
Excuse me! EXCUSE ME!! We are trying to cry about PvP on PvP servers here! Take your practice of rational thinking somewhere else please.
---
Damn vanish works much better on private servers.
---
Reasons
---
Not a phone in sight, just people vibing
---
&gt; I’ve also noticed they haven’t fixed the bug where mobs that you kite for long enough will sometimes hit you for multiple auto-attacks at once when they reach you.
---
Not only did you hijack this thread to discuss an entirely unrelated bug, it also happens to not even be a bug in the first place. Blizzard already confirmed that's normal for mobs with the thrash ability.
---
Mistakes happen, people have to learn about these things somehow, so don't worry too much about it if it is truly a one-time error. Just keep in mind that in a /roll situation, if you pass, the item should go to the next highest roll. Otherwise you'll get groups of players that will always roll for each other.
---
I dont know about the first question but as far as the devil saur youre gonna want to make sure you're hit capped before anything else.
---
I mean it's obviously worthless. You said so yourself.
---
Poorly
---
Devilsaur, only real benefit of AGI is getting more AP and Crit, and if they are higher on Devilsaur then you have your answer.
---
You are mixing Blood Fury and Blood rage
---
Both healing amounts (As seen in the nameplate) are both from max rank renew.
---
Yeah honestly probably for the best. Unless you have a guild to back you up, you’re not getting Hand
---
I cleared MC/Ony week 2 as MT. I never experienced any of these issues until I play alts. The crop of casual players not 60 yet is atrocious at the game. All I'm trying to say is it is much better at max level. 
---
I'd suggest joining a guild or using the add-on Character Notes to avoid the painful casuals as much as u can. I have 2 tanks at max level and I control everything about my grouping experience, which I thoroughly enjoy.
---
Welcome to the internet. But seriously, just turn the game off and live your life. Problem solved. Don't ever let anything in wow get you down.
---
Are you grabbing a but if gear with spirit on it? Spirit is really effective on warriors
---
This has proved shockingly successful
---
Hey buddy, relax. First off 2.7% crit is far from imperceptible and second I was simply stating there’s more to benefit than just the really rare item. Take a chill pill friend
---
Big noob here, I'm rolling an undead mage, I'm not very good at using the num keys, what mouse would you guys reccomend? Also I see people talking about macros and rotations, is it possible to macro my entire rotation? Are macros bannable? What are good addons and where do I get them? Thanks in advance to anyone that replies, sincerely your friendly neighborhood magelet!
---
Expose them on reddit.
---
Server/guild name/individual names.
---
These fucking scum deserve to be shamed.
---
I had like 300 gold at level 50 and used it to twink out my warrior in a bunch of really good gear including Kang the Decapitator. The end result was that I was able to fight one  mob at my level with only losing 40% of my hp. I could even kill a whole three mobs at my level, if I had potions and elixirs on with all my cooldowns up. 
---
...then a mage would run by and pull like 12+ mobs and aoe them all down without losing a point of hp. I'm sure I heard him whisper some sort of anti-semitic remark as he walked past, too.
---
Lol, wow
---
Wait for pvp to be added.
---
99.999% sure that’s against the sub rules
---
The mages alone are enough to not ever want to tank. They will spam aoe on two mobs, immediately oom, pull agro, then complain if they ever get agro or if the dungeon isn't going fast enough, as well as refuse to use single target. They are cancer.
---
In the original Vanilla I didn't hit 60 until Jan 2006, just after AQ40 was released. I still ended up decked out in T1 a few months later and then decked out in a mix of T2 and AQ loot by the time Naxx came out in June 2006.
---
If you stick it out you'll probably find that guilds have MC, ZG, BWL, AQ20 + 40 on farm and have been doing them for so long that it's a cakewalk and you'll have no competition for gear :)
---
Big yikes
---
GET GET GET GET GOT GOT GOT GOT
---
BLOOD RUSH TO MY HEAD LIT HOT LOCK
---
Now you're just on a rant, sounds like you're repeating shit u read on reddit but out of context. 
---
The game is not hard, nobody claimed it's hard, OP trying to figure out optimal builds is not hard.
---
Holy hell being a mage I don't think I'm ever gonna get close to bis gear my lord
---
Man I love being a hunter
---
Nothing annoys me more than when i join a dungeon group as a druid tank, we cant find a healer so I heal, the tank gear I joined the group to get drops and I then get shouted at for rolling need on it.
---
I eat/drink/bandage out of combat, but it's up to the healers to deal with my tapping in combat. What drives me nuts is when they hardcast a heal on me and completely overheal me rather than just using a hot. I love renew/rejuv/regrowth because I cam tap away and make sure theres no over healing.
---
My first wow character actually
---
No need to explain yourself. It's our pre bis chest. They can f off
---
Oh damn.

Got a Gut Ripper drop the other day. Will this go up in value or should I just sell it now? ~40g on AH on my server. I’m a rogue, but lvl 54 so I’m assuming I’m a little past the phase of it being useful to equip.
---
I have a holy pally main, 2 mobs and your done? I can gather about 7 felcloth mobs and like 14 skeletons in WPL, Conc and heal conc and heal with SOW always up. EZPZ. Holy wraith is good
---
It doesn't. It's only if the attack is in *very* close proximity to the the other mob that this happens and is apparently a classic thing, not vanilla.
---
hydrocane is from Viscous Fallout in Gnomeregan.
---
Assholes it sounds like. Some people never matured between the time they were edgy teenagers back during original release and now
---
&gt; Get over yourself bitch.
---
I can smell the teenage angst through my monitor
---
I remember coming across it the first time and immediately jumped the zombies because i i thought they were players.
---
I ended up getting double teamed by both mobs.
---
To get a better view you should roll horde... and never look back
---
There *are no* issues past the first time you blithering idiot. He never left combat. There was a ranged shot in the air during the 2nd attempt, which is EXACTLY MY ENTIRE POINT.
---
Vanish was ALWAYS meant to take a measure of skill to use.
---
It ALWAYS required distance, LoS'ing the mobs or CC'ing them etc.
---
It's only because of ignorant wankers like you complaining 24/7 that blizz even changed it mid TBC.
---
First step to saving for your level 40 mount is buying 14 slot bags at level 30.
---
See you all at the bar.
---
\&gt; Honestly, I have never come across so many bugs in a game that have caused so much death. 
---
I take it somebody hasn't ever tried to walk up a slight gradient in a Bethesda game before then.
---
Kinda its time limited unless you have a bunch of alts (ootl btw whays sgc?)
---
How's leveling as a disc? Do you think it has many advantages over lvling as shadow?
---
I soloed Bangalash on my disc priest at 43. I don't know why people think priests can't solo anything while leveling.
---
They didn't say anything about not liking gamers though, they just stated the troof
---
I’m so flattered you took the time to read everything I wrote here... It’s a shame your fishing expedition was fruitless.
---
It just goes to show how petty you really are, perusing through my posts in the hopes there is something you can latch on to. If I wasn’t worth your time, you wouldn’t have taken the time to respond at all. Which only proves you have nothing better to do than engage with people you deem inferior.
---
Send me a PM I’ll send you an autographed picture, it’s always great to connect with my fans.
---
Whoomp there she is.
---
If u are sm ruin and dont get to use corruption a ds ruin has minimum 15% more shadow dmg than u, since u will not proc the 2x shadowbolt almost ever im guessing? While ds ruin just sacs the succubus, also maybe he had crit gear? :)
---
Also, are u manapoting and demonic/dark runing? Was he? Since those 2 have individual cds  they are great for locks also during raid, i never lifetap until i have used both a major mana and a demonic/dark rune, to keep my dps at its most efficient
---
What's your talent build if you don't mind me asking?
---
As I understand it Righteous Fury + Greater Blessing of Kings generates threat on a per-cast basis. So say you have 7 hunters, GBoK will increase threat by 114x7. Cast  2 or 3 times and you can exceed 2000 threat. Three GBoK casts cost less than a single consecrate.
---
Are you really defending the guild for harassing someone?
---
Dwarves are easily the best PvP rogue race Alliance side.
---
Haven’t they already confirmed Classic BGS are cross realm though? Or is it just easier to get premades?
---
If I’m not mistaken, the goblin sapper charger is not tied to the goblin engineering. Any engineer can craft it. This is what I saw before even finishing the goblin quest line.
---
How lovely.
---
Is this Elvui? The name plates are really nice
---
I see, thank you!
---
Time...
---
I was once in a group tanking and everyone else in the group had some form of crowd control (slows, roots, stuns, etc) and none of them would use them, so we kept getting runners pulling more groups and wiping. Was infuriating.
---
Download a damage meter addon and see if there's a noticeable difference in healing over 5 minutes. 1 tick of healing isn't enough info.
---
In some cases, healers have better options available than casters, and thus may be needing an item that is good for them, but amazing for a caster due to lack of alternatives.
---
yes but normally there arent 20 dps below the tanks
---
More like they made a broad generalization about millions of people like an absolute idiot. Good try though.
---
Very stupid
---
I love desolace! Its a great zone.
---
They would have to redesign zones to release TBC and Wrath without flying because whole zones were designed around it originally.
---
Blink in.  Frost Nova Hunter and Pet together. Stand out of range of pet and in Hunter’s dead zone. Sheep pet, then Frostbolt Cone Hunter and spam instant damage while staying at 5-8 yard range.  If he scatters, ice block and cancel quick as a makeshift PvP trinket.  If he feigns, don’t run on top of him as he likely laid a trap there. This is one of the easier fights for Mages.
---
This is a functional problem with batching. I doubt it gets fixed : l
---
They seem dead set on the ridiculous batching mechanics
---
Wait, reasons? I thought we were discounting the any possibility other than cowardice. *Now* it's important to be reasonable? 
---
You're safely in the majority. Maybe don't question the motives of others moving to get the same benefits.
---
DUDE! It's Alektri...Don't know if you remember me but we made a few WoW videos together!
---
How?
---
You're right, maybe they should have said "internet users" instead. Also, where did they say they don't like gamers? You can be critical of something and still like it. C'mon lol
---
Saw this ok some fury prot monstrosity the other day. I bet he is a real joy to heal at this point in the game.
---
My friend got this on first try
---
GZ, this might hurt your feelings, but the first time I ever saw that shameful orc after about ~10 arena runs he dropped it.... I'm sorry. But congrats !
---
Renew heals the same amount (plus or minus 1 depending) regardless. Every single time you cast it. It cannot crit in classic. It is a set amount. It is the best way to tell the difference in my spellpower since it's coefficient with spell power is 1 for 1. Every spellpower = Renew heals 1 more.
---
WTF -&gt; Wow Text File
---
Yes, but the reason that many people prefer hitting the hit cap (9%) as a first priority is that many fights are so short that a single miss can be a big deal. Like when a fight is 30 seconds long you may only shoot about 15 times and one miss in that situation means you lose 8% of your total damage for that fight.
---
For anything but hardcore raiding, 10 Agi is roughly equal to 1 hit, but most people prefer to have hit cap for raids before focusing on other stats.
---
&gt;at my level
---
Well, there's your problem. If you ain't fighting mobs 3-4 levels below you, you're doin' it wrong as a warrior. Pick areas to quest where most mobs are in that range, and you'll have no problems fighting 2-3 at a time, or 5 in a row before eating.
---
You could macro it (I don't have one for a mage roatation, sorry!) but each button press can only cast one action. So for me, I have one button on my Warlock that I: Press 2, it casts Immolate, press 2 it casts Corruption, I press 2 it cast Curse of Agony, press 2 it starts auto casting Wand. You would need a macro like that but for mage it would essentially be Frostbolt then Wand, and then if you want to AoE farm (check out some youtube guides for this), it's Frostnova, into Blizzard, Nova again and Blizz again with some variation here or there.
---
The lie about 600 runs lol gold
---
Sweet, thank you for this!
---
Report it
---
For any 26 consecutive hits, op calculated that the chance none of those specific hits are windfury to be .3%. There are 350-26 = 324 (heavily overlapping) sequences of 26 consecutive hits within that sequence of 350 hits. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of  26 consecutive nonprocs is equal to the total number of possible sequences times the chance any one of them is entirely nonprocs. 324\*.3% is about 1.
---
The fact that these sequences overlap heavily  actually doesn't matter, linearity of expectation holds regardless of the independence of the random variables.
---
The other response you recieved is asuming that you are performing repeated trials of 26 attempts and only checking if any specific one of them is all nonprocs, but that was almost certainly not what op was doing when he found this dead zone. (who would chose 26 beforehand as the number of swings to look at?)
---
The number I give is slightly misleading, however, as it considers seeing a string of 27 nonprocs as having seen 2 strings of 26 (the front 26 and the back 26), and e.g. a string of 30 as containing 5 strings of 26. But it still should only be a few hundred swings to have a good chance of seeing 26 consecutive nonprocs.
---
&gt; /raid: Type 1 for summon
---
I have so much respect for pve warlocks.
---
Possibly a cap
---
When I use to play. I use to come across people asking for help for a quest they were way too low level for.
---
One of them was they were trying to do hogger at level 5 lol
---
As Horde I'm having a blast there but I wouldn't think it would be as fun if someone were Alliance.
---
What guild were you in? I played on akama for all of BC -&gt; WotLK
---
Most top tier players are fury prot right now you get 9999999 threat basically and swap back to your shield like this version of classic I dunno bout your guild but the dps is 30 times higher than usual I pick my things on AlkaiserX and Kurgan along with Skeram in terms of the fury setup due to TPS being absolutely higher. So it's not that bad it's the same mitigation in the end overall you just need proper gear to do it to do it overall if not you just stay prot lol
---
Id guess he's a hunter that wants to solo dire maul north tribute
---
A-fucking-men!!!
---
Right side flight path in ferelas (right next to thousand needles). Right next to it is the alliance tribal leather working gal. If you have completed all the wild leather pattern quests, learn them all, then talk to her.
---
She will assign you to make 2 of the wild leather pieces, I think the vest and helm. Do that and turn it in and you should be good.
---
Ok
---
What are your mh and on weapons?
---
Hey look guys it's this joke again
---
ok but we literally have video evidence that it doesn't always work
---
Um yes? I had a group all we did was dungeon spam lol
---
Uggh, in Vanilla I was an officer in a guild that had some pretty toxic elements.  It was ok at first.  A bit further in one of the other officers confided in me that he was gay, and that he didn't really feel comfortable with some of the other offices/guild leader because of all the anti-gay stuff they were spewing.  
---
I went inactive for a while after we rerolled and switched sides, and then came back and was constantly harassed for my DPS sucking...  They were in Naxx, I was pulled in at 58 or something and was still in leveling greens.  I left a short time later - man, people in this came can sure suck ass.
---
I can see his run energy, gg account
---
Hit cap on gordok is 6%. Miss rate is based on weapon skill vs their level so having 305 skill against a raid boss (63) is the same thing as 300 skill against a 62 mob which is a 6% miss rate.
---
It was mostly in the first week when I was leveling, upgrades are upgrades when you’re trying to get to 60.
---
sgc = savage glad chain
---
haxssssz
---
May as well stop playing, nothing else to do now.
---
Lmao I only play dps only classes so far because I don't wanna be forced to tank or heal
---
Reminded me of this as well!
---
I appreciate the grind. It may be pointless, but so is everything else we do in this game.
---
It's Ice HUD :D
---
No its not
---
You should be fine as long as it's not encouraging harassment of them or lying about what happened.
---
This is Blizzard's response to the feign death bug which I assume is the same thing. [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feign-death-trap-bug/278131/381](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/feign-death-trap-bug/278131/381)
---
For those who don't like links:
---
*Hey everybody, I wanted to take a minute to talk about Feign Death. Hunters are understandably very concerned about the behavior of such an iconic ability, with a variety of important uses, and I want to assure you that we’re aware of your reports and we’re investigating. This one isn’t easy at all. In our reference builds, many of the same behaviors that players are reporting do occur, but sometimes with slight differences in timing or consistency, which makes it really difficult to even identify a clear bug in the first place. However, despite this difficulty we have made some progress here.*  
---
*The first issue is that Feign Death cancels when you move, including if you turn, and very often high-skill hunters are running from an opponent, turning to shoot behind them, and then Feign Death to drop a trap. It some of these cases, Feign Death is failing because the spell-cancel on turning is more sensitive in WoW Classic than it was in 1.12. We’ve tracked down why it’s more sensitive, and we’re testing a change now that relaxes the spell cancellation to make it less likely that you’ll inadvertently trigger this if you’re trying to stop turning to cast Feign Death. That said, if you continue turning after the cast, or keep turning during the cast, you can still cause Feign Death to be cancelled. This fix will go out soon as a hotfix.*  
---
*There are other reports about it taking too long to drop combat, or having combat re-activated because your pet is getting attacked, and we’re still looking at those issues. We’re tracking a couple of leads there, but we haven’t got this bug in our sights yet, so it may take a bit more time to figure out what’s really going on here.*  
---
*I’m sorry it’s not a silver bullet, but hopefully it gives you some peace of mind to know we’re listening, and still investigating the issues.*
---
:\_; I used it for awhile so I'm very use to it lol

Lol that’s one reason I don’t play a rogue seriously

Hahaha I'm a hunter made a group with a druid tank and got.it after 2 tries.   Grats

Don’t let no-lifers set your game pace. You’re doing fine
---
It's because I was joking about this item not existing due to it's drop rate.....
---
Some people use the razor naga with its numpadlike buttonlayout. I just have two buttons. Which make it 6 with shift and ctrl modifiers.
---
I have rebound 6-9 and the rest to the right to completely other keys like F, C and R. Also use them in combination with shift and ctrl.
---
Rebind q and e to spells.
---
It might be possible to macro entire rotation, but highly inefficient. Try some basic macro to startwith to get a feel for what they even are. Basic combine spell macros are not bannable.
---
Just play more and get a feel for what in the ui you would like to have more info about or just check out most popular addons and try them out. Worst case? Delete them.

is that really an option? getting a level 9 pet when ur already in ur 30s, sounds terrible
---
I regretted rolling a warrior from level 30 to 59. It's around the time you reach Redridge on Alliance side that you realize leveling alone is going to be horrible. Bandaging between each battle, dying to bad RNG (miss, dodge, parry, resist bleeds, enemy heals, Pats!), expensive gear repair.. And it doesn't change for the rest of your experience. Truly maddening all the way through.
---
Then I hit 60, started getting Pre-Bis, switched to 1H Fury, grinded dungeons with guildies, farming mats for raids, raiding, etc. Totally different class now.. all that efforts starting to pay off and it's finally just fun again.
---
No I'm not.
---
are you kidding? he popped sprint and ran directly away from them man, he would have to have like 5k latency for that to possibly be an issue and it's very clear by the responsiveness of the mobs that it isn't the case.  it's a bug.
---
Naaa its just your imagination
---
It came across more as a woe is me sympathy post and since the story starts with you threatening this group of people it's a little hard to see it from a sympathetic angle.
---
I've read 80% chance several times, but in my experience it's 50%. Definitely higher than regular cables.
---
I admire the attention to detail, right down to the little squirt of jizz coming out the top.
---
My guild went and claimed world first city raids of Ironforge, Stormwind, and Darnassus a few weeks ago. I agree where it seems like there isn't much interest in horde raiding the alliance for some reason.

I leveled as holy/disc from the beginning, 0 points in shadow because I dislike the shadow priest archetype. Sure it's slower, but a lot more enjoyable for me to be *the* healer. Gonna hit 60 tonight after 13 days /played. First time WoW player too.
---
Casting renew is a healing effect not healing. Some items give + healing and effects
---
Yeah you have to find a guild willing to support you. Farming this crap solo is gonna be damn near impossible. This is like 30K worth of mats or gated behind like a 2 year grind to farm it all yourself.
---
i lost the first HOJ i saw drop after about 30 runs to a hunter
---
this was after the DM release announcement
---
Yes, It’s under the name of Tukui now though
---
Its tech they put in to stop people doing that kind of thing to avoid ques
---
No joke am hunter got it at 56 on my second run. The very salty tank left the party and the other hunter cursed me out then blocked me. Still happy I got so lucky!
---
I have a mageblade but still don’t have reed. I run it over and over just to lose the roll when it drops. Lost roll 6 times now.
---
Got begged to tank a dungeon for a group on my druid. I joined.
---
Group was 2 warriors and a paladin.
---
I've been using Elvui all this time, might have to try Tukui out!
---
Agreed. Its hard to coordinate a group. So i run Fury dual wield tank. Thats the only way I dont get treat pulled from me. And in a interesting way, people act better and focus on my targets, instead of me running around with a shield.
---
Negative. If I take off my greens that leave out the word "effects" then it still decreases healing.
---
Your main tank is using a bot.
---
Succ him off while he's in MC.
---
Not enough limited invulnerability potions...
---
Best HUD addon out there imo
---
A 41 ganking a 60?
---
I tried giving out cheese in front of Silvermoon once and everyone just cancelled the trades. That day I went from bored to sad :(
---
Agreed. It's BIS for melee - forever.
---
Flameguard+weapon chain is the way to go for pvp. Also lionheart lacks stamina, I believe crown of destruction is just better.
---
Hit cap matters more in shorter fights because one missed attack is a much larger lost dmg % than in longer fights.
---
It’s not a good feeling, it’s relief. When I finally got belt from BRD arena I was just relieved I didn’t have to go into that hellhole anymore. There was no joy.
---
3 million retail players that demand new content that costs blizzard development. 
---
3 million classic players that demand #nochanges  that costs blizzard next to nothing. 
---
They'll lose people buying expansions but that's $50 every 2 years while their real earner is $360 for 24 months subbed.
---
Im no expert but defensive weapon enchant spell, a shield and lots of earthshocks. Go try it!
---
Quick tip on soul shards - in burning steppes there are these cute little level 52 imps with 800 hp that spawn in packs of 5-6. Corruption everything, drain in order that you applied corruptions.
---
Also it's hard to consider '6' through '=' real keybinds (if you assume he's using WAD to move)
---
Haha your talking like you ain't one of them
---
Playing healer especially has helped me recognize just how important aggro is in classic dungeons. DPS need to chill out with aggro.
---
That's good then
---
Currently playing Bigglesworth Alliance which seems to be loaded with warriors/tanks. Considering transferring servers to make it a lil easier to find groups. The ganking is also really bad at peak hours so I'd like to go somewhere a little lower pop. My NA options are Anathema, Arcanite Reaper, Earthfury. I would love to transfer somewhere with a shortage of tanks! Can anyone on one of these servers confirm if theirs is right for me?
---
I'm a nice tank, I often run strat live not reserving anything, I sometimes run brd in full for nothing, I obviously run anything for guildies if I have time. I like tanking and I like pug because most people are quite funny so I do a lot of it without asking anything. 
---
Now people /w me to tank strat rush condemned then reset until said rogue get the mask, people ask me to tank ubrs with everything reserved, people whisp me when I'm in raid to tank to save that dwarf princess... and yeah some people do get mad when I say "well ok I'll come if you guys give me the first orb".
---
Guess I'm a bit too entitled I should probably act like a tanking bot programmed to serve.
---
I don't know if it translate in English but in my country we have a saying "give a hand they'll want your arm".
---
So first of all, https://imgur.com/KKm7hez. You can see the shot hitting him *before* he vanishes... 
---
He enters stealth a 3rd time after using a health potion, it even changes him to his stealth bar (as mentioned about 4 times now), please explain how dots or weapon swings made him do that, this one of those incredible measures of skill?
---
You've insulted my intelligence about 3 different ways so far yet remain incapable of basic comprehension, should have realized earlier there's no point arguing with a fool, you do you.
---
Interact with others. Buff those you can and thank others when they buff you. If you didn't catch their name then drop a comment in the zone chat thanking their class for the buff/help.
---
If someone is asking for help with an escort quest and you have the time to spare then help them out. Some of those chicken escorts are a pain in the arse so you're bound to make someone's evening by running with them. 
---
If you spot a warrior at quarter health with 3+ mobs on him stop and toss him a heal. Or a rez. Or just generally help out others with mobs if they look overwhelmed. (Just don't do what I usually end up doing and pulling aggro. &gt;.&lt; )
---
For the most part you get out what you put in. Talk to others, banter with them in zone or party chat, encourage them and share in their accomplishments or commiserate with them on their losses. Help those around you where you can and you'll notice them go on to help others, at least from what I've seen. 
---
Just connecting with the people you are playing with can go a long way to help form a positive community. :)
---
Sorry if that was a bit rambling, hope it helps!
---
There are a lot of other great ideas that people have mentioned. I really like the idea that randomCAguy wrote of mailing folks useful stuff so I'm going to start sending spare health pots I have to warriors that I meet along the way.
---
Why?  You'll replace it soon after.
---
You really need to consider the phrasing “by up to”. Just because your healing power increases, it is never guaranteed. However, it would most likely be higher over a long fight.
---
Also, it looks like you are losing some Intelligence which can be converted to Crit Chance. Obviously, it is small change.
---
Finally, one or two small “upgrades” to your gear is not going to be that noticeable.
---
You need to understand that people who don’t know these things you rant about are most likely not a nerd like you, have never played a tank or wow for that matter. 
---
These weren’t real complaints in vanilla wow , they were  just part of the struggle and are only now whinges cos you think you are smarter than newer players. Which let’s all be honest from a non 60 tank is quite irrelevant lol. 
---
Thinking that in order to continue to play and have fun as tank requires all other classes to be playing ‘correctly’ is a very good indication that you are playing wrong.
---
So instead of thinking you are doing nothing wrong, why don’t you try telling your group what you want or how you want to play, since no can read your mind different groups play differently. Change your style, learn the game not just one meta you can’t evolve from.
---
Mages are horrendous in classic in my experience as well. Not just bad players, many of them, but I've come across so many arseholes. Particularly gnome mages.
---
&gt;The people who were ok with the changes stuck around in retail and kept playing. You're currently posting in a community where the majority prefer the original version of the game. No flying is one of the cornerstones of that preference. Got the sense that the above wasn't obvious somehow.
---
You still haven't explained how flying ruined the game.
---
&gt;but here we go again with a little more of the thinking done for you: it enables a player to cut themselves off from the world while still being in it. It stands against the design philosophy of the original game and is a considerable step down in fun for the crowd that likes vanilla.
---
Here we go again with a little more thinking done for you: If a player chooses cut themselves off from the game world in order to save travel time, that means the game world wasn't worth the travel time.
---
&gt;It stands against the design philosophy of the original game and is a considerable step down in fun for the crowd that likes vanilla.
---
Getting dismounted by random level 40+ mobs is very fun! Whew, I think I've heard that a grand total of never while I played in vanilla.
---
&gt;The game being more risky and challenging makes it more rewarding and engaging.
---
Dealing with getting dismounted when you're max level and trying to head to your dungeon isn't risky or engaging, it's just annoying. Otherwise people won't bother to fly. I love how you twist words in order to suit your narrative, it's hilarious.
---
&gt;Going from any point A to any point B became in essence a timed teleport. Believe it or not, most people here are not big fans of that
---
If you're not a fan of a certain type of playstyle that is fine, but that doesn't mean the playstyle ruins the game.
---
&gt;this is not a case of me trying to tell others how to play.
---
Denying other people options most definitely is.
---
&gt;If you think the game world is boring and annoying, I can only assume you only play for the instanced content. You do you man, but I prefer wow to be an mmo.
---
If the world was interesting enough, people would do that content. There's already interesting stuff in the world like world pvp which people do. Getting thrown off by random monsters on the way to the dungeon isn't one of them, and that's why people chose to skip it.
---
Also, flying mounts doesn't make an mmo a non-mmo. They fit fine into a fantasy mmo setting. The problem here is lack of interesting things to do in the game world once you hit 60, annoying travel mechanics, long travel times etc. And all of this is further supported by the fact that despite calling these things 'great' you have to force people into them (otherwise they wouldn't do it) and then somehow tell me they enjoy it. It's like forcing a Mcdonald's burger down someone's throat and then saying they are eating it because they like it. This has got to be the funniest backwards logic I've seen in a while.
---
Heya!  I'm a Sergeant in The Legion, a super casual leveling guild of 250+ members founded by U.S. military vets.  While we do have goals to raid in the future, right now we're focused on helping each other level and keeping the game fun.  There's always a group running dungeons, and a fair mix of all levels to keep everyone going.
---
If you're interested in joining us, my in-game name is Anasirra!
---
I addressed this in an earlier comment.
---
I mean, maybe cause my warrior is geared, but I can literally chain pull 4-5 mobs with no problem at level 35. I never understood this meme, cause I kept up on gearing the entire time
---
Everyone does shit like this, even Alliance. 95% of pvp in this game is a larger group ganking solo players or smaller groups so don't pat yourself on the back lmao. There was an Alliance raid camping Kargath on raid night, killing the flight master and anyone who hearthed in. Most people are shit cowards who love unbalanced fights in their favor.
---
Pretty sure int increases your healing done as well
---
So do you just not loot anything and prioritize XP over gold?
---
I didn’t mean this op was like that, I just meant the situation at large. 
---
I could see how it wa worded that way thought
---
A soul stone should as its a conjured item. A soul shard however will not, it's basically a reagent.
---
&gt; costs less than a single consecrate
---
But consecrate is free and GBoK costs 27 silver.
---
NOW THIS IS PROFESSIONALISM!
---
If you are manually extracting and moving the folders, the problem is almost always that it is the wrong subfolder. Open up the add-on folder and see if there is a folder within that folder with basically the same name as the top level one. You need to move that folder out so it is the top level folder. It won't be able to dig through subfolders if the hierarchy isn't correct. 
---
Of course, it may be a different issue, but in my experience this is usually it.
---
are you on stonespine cause I saw excatly the same looking cow there the other day?!
---
gz on loot :) 
---
I play a ud female rogue there myself
---
Glad to hear it. With any luck (some green weapons) it can get pretty sweet.
---
No, it doesn't. It only adds spell crit chance.
---
What are you camping btw?
---
Alliance - US - Whitemane - PVP
---
Fully pre-BIS feral tank. Looking for a guild willing to take me as feral. I'm currently spec'd 0/30/21 and normally raid as healer, but I don't like it. I've tanked every dungeon during leveling with no issue.
---
If a guild were to pick me up as feral, I would Respec full feral to match
---
The rub is that I can only raid late on weekdays (only after 11pm on weekdays, weekends are open)
---
Attuned for MC/Ony and close to finishing hydraxis quest for runes (Honored with waterlords)
---
is a Tauren Shaman that bad? How wide is the gulf between the best shaman race and the worst? I plan on leveling enhancement till 40, then elemental till 60, and then respec into resto. I'm mostly focused on PvE
---
Learn how to read boys! It’s fuckin’ embarrassing
---
50   saw the boss 3 times , never the chest.
---
You should try at least Undead horse.
---
Taurens can surely use that one:  [https://i.redd.it/s935w9mjk9q31.png](https://i.redd.it/s935w9mjk9q31.png)
---
Check out Zygor's guide. Has an in game guide add-on and has been working well for me so far. Level 33 on my mage with 1 day 12 hours /played
---
&gt; I believe it’s like a 5-7 yd range?
---
5-8. same as the dead zone for warriors between melee range and charge/intercept range
---
Dude I remember seeing Warlocks in vanilla using a Krol Blade.
---
YOU JUST MADE THE LIST!
---
Somber and depressing environments make me happy.
---
Good to rule that out then. You should record a series of videos (mouseover the thing and show your connection too) and upload them as a series so that they can't use that as an excuse (pretty typical first line of defense for game developers).
---
It's real close. The alliance on Kromcrush is fierce
---
No joke I’m lvl 19 and can’t take a mob of 3 16s by myself
---
Like everyone else has said - come on into Azeroth! I can't imagine the core population disappearing. Some come and go - great. I have been playing since launch day and my highest is 47. I have a couple decent alts, too. I like to be serious but I am not rushing in any way. I don't care about all the people at 60, I'm having a blast healing, tanking, and DPSing on my toons.
---
Enjoy the game! Come on over!
---
I don't think BWL is until phase 3 so you have a while to catch up. People will still be doing Ony/MC.
---
Rofl
---
I renew the tank every time. No real issue with threat. If it’s a big pull, I’ll use fade to be safe.
---
grenades are incaps not stuns (pink swirly instead of blue spiral)
---
I’m lvl 22 horde, where should I be leveling? Ashrnvale mobs are wrecking me
---
600? damn dude. it's a 9% drop off a 1 in 6 boss, 600 is wild. I got it on my second arena run.
---
Locks are confusing. I did a lot of testing recently and while SL Locks have a ton of survivability and can go toe-to-toe with most classes 1v1, even with pre-raid BiS, their damage output is limited. Hell, it's even limited in MC/BWL gear. Their SM/Ruin or Conflag builds require a TON of spellpower, which is why Warlocks get the most profound power bump in the game AQ-40 and beyond. Warlocks are lower on the DPS charts in MC/BWL, whereas Hunters are really high, and these things flip-flop as the raids release.
---
Basically, if you want to SL Lock for  your entirety of Classic WoW after only getting MC/BWL gear, be my guest, but a lock who spends a little more time getting that sweet ZG/AQ20/AQ40/Naxx gear will be absolutely insane in PvP. The other problem, too, is that SL Lock isn't great for group PvP and doesn't perform well in BG's where as an SM/Ruin or Conflag Lock with really good gear can lead almost every chart.
---
The main difficulty comes from the bosses itself and the long horrid chokepoint that leads to them. It is the perfect defense. If you are fighting invaders before reaching that point you are doing it wrong.
---
DW on a survival hunter for some nutty pvp
---
that was not a thing at all except in dungeons.
---
Yepp thats true.
---
Vanish definitely did not always work perfectly in classic, but not sure if this is worse. It can be resisted too afaik on top of bugs.
---
thats it, im gettin me mallet
---
What is this "luck" of which you speak?

---
"That's it buster! You're going on the list! And I won't make it flattering either!"
---
It’s a mechanic they lifted from Diablo. In fact a lot of the gearing systems in modern wow are very Diablo-like.
---
My entire retail experience was playing Alliance. There was enough content that I always felt satisfied but eventually running through the same areas became repetitive. 
---
When I tried classic wow, I went straight back to alliance and brought back some of those memories. But I felt like I was missing out on half the content by ignoring horde. I switched to horde and have not looked back. 
---
Regardless of your faction claim, I think every player should at least try and enjoy each faction at least casually. You’re paying for this game, you might as well get the most out of it.
---
You never really get to know how to play anything well if that’s your strategy. Playing one class for thousands of hours and knowing all the details is a much more satisfying experience IMO. The whole purpose of the grind to 60 is to learn how your class functions.
---
Yeah guildies got there's at 100s to 200s
---
Yeah, the warrior design for tanking is terrible and nobody knows wtf is going on. They don’t realize you need to build threat, and in order to do so you have to have rage, in order to get rage you have to be hit...
---
Rogues stun, warriors charge and stun, priests shield you, hunters shoot too fast, mages aoe, and warlocks have no idea what their threat level is, it’s just insane.
---
Tanking as a warrior is extremely frustrating, and then only good thing about it is that you get to run dungeons whenever you want. It’s not fun to quest, it’s not fun to solo, the repair bills are super high, and nobody else wants to tank. Even the tanks I run with don’t want to tank! They want dps gear and to gtfo of tanking as soon as possible. 
---
Really sad! I’m tanking, because I hate competing for gear on dps and spamming all day for groups just to get shafted. 
---
The community is really utter shit at lower levels so I’m hoping at max level there are some better people. Rogues always seem to have the worst attitude. 
---
If you’re wondering why there’s a tank shortage... the OP is right on.
---
I agree that if they could use all the unused stuff to finish it would be the best route.
---
But again, you'd be looking at a **different** team of developers trying to put together the stuff for this unfinished content. And I still don't think they can do it and keep it inline with Classic. They'll add changes they think are "better for how it should be played". They always do.
---
you do get reasonable XP doing Angerforge runs. imo 54-58 is the optimal time to try to farm Sav Glad and HoJ, acquiring them early lets you focus on running the higher level content when you get to 58+
---
A little louder
---
Do you farm them, or just lucky?
---
You can just 2 man it at 60. That’s how we got it for one of our warriors. Took about 8 resets but we had been running BRD Arena since 51 so overall over 100 runs, close to 200.
---
Nice stats, I like your style. I always hand these out in the open world or dungeons and sometimes people hand out small trinkets or potions.
---
Try Stonetalon.
---
Same boat
---
It is funny to see mages do that though.  Its kind of a spectical to me
---
It's true I did scholo for the first time a week ago the other night and the rogue basically took the lead to the point where he was chucking raid markers out and telling me about bosses special abilities and everything.  
---
We wiped about 3 times but noone was fussed. The next run I did I knew everything I needed to know about the dung and we completely destroyed it, it was fantastic.
---
Yeh but it's so big
---
You wouldn’t use this tactic on every pull as long as mana and threat is not an issue. Prot Paladins are already expected to consume as much as possible, so if this is a threat increase, I’m sure it will be a welcomed one.
---
It seems like most all the quests are green
---
Same problem.
---
**Different** people are going to be making that content for Classic+.
---
Not the people who made Vanilla, the thing you are currently enjoying. Not the same spirit of play. It isn't 2004 anymore, they won't get it right because an imitation is still just that, **an immitation**, it can't compare to the original 9.99999/10 times.
---
Sav Glad: 9% drop from a one-in-six boss. 1.5% odds per run.
---
Cadaverous Armor: slightly better than Sav Glad, 1.1% odds on 5 guaranteed bosses in Scholo and 4% odds on a sixth boss
---
yall farmin the wrong instance
---
For the same reason why as a feral druid I don't roll need on that stuff, because I can just get by on what I pick up from quests for 'healer' gear.
---
If a paladin rolled need on dps cloth gear because "I have more mana for holy shocks and consecrate" I would put them on my black list and kick them from the group.
---
Your 'need' for better gear to heal higher level dungeons does not trump their need for gear to level better, if I can heal gnomer in level 16 green int cloth you can heal dungeons just fine with lower leveled gear.
---
Lol I just got inventors focus sword which gives +1 % spell crit for my lock at level 48. To find out that this is my pre raid BIS is funny to me. That and the ring from mara are classic examples of this
---
I'm level 40 and the most I can do is 4 same-level mobs. But only once every 30 fucking minutes.
---
I apologize if that's how it's coming off. That's not the context I'm trying to convey.
---
If an expensive item drops etiquette on my server at least is for everyone to need.
---
I never got why people get mad, if say a krol blade drops, and it's worth 300g, it's worth that amount to everyone, including a rogue who says he needs it. If it's worth more than 300g too him then he should buy one for 300g.
---
Would be nice if unlike the majority of this subreddit ask "is this a bug" rather than ignorantly asserting things are bugs.
---
Thrash displays in the combat log, quite literally stating the mob has gained an extra attack. Blizzard didn't need to state it. Its right there in the game.
---
Lol nice
---
Kind of a curse we are better then prot warriors so we get stuck in the off tank role.
---
Hunters are obviously really strong levelers but don't have sustain either, unless semi-disposable pets count as sustain.
---
I had tailoring at 60 to make my Robe of the Archmage, made myself 2 pieces of Mooncloth, then dropped tailoring. Then I just had a guild mate make me 2 Mooncloth bags with my mats. From there my plan was to buy two more 16 slot bags after my epic mount. However, I got lucky and two actually dropped during my grind.
---
Do you know them? Do you know their friends, families and loved ones? No? Then your no homie.
---
So let me comment
---
...I feel bad for you
---
The original ring was the one from Wailing Caverns that gives int, spir, and stam. \[Deep Fathom Ring\]
---
The new one is \[Fordring's Seal\] (5 int, 4 stam, 37 healing sp)
---
This one is fake. He couldn't find a group.
---
There are pretty well known tests for randomness - I don’t really have time to dig it out of the logs but if you pm it to me I could run them.  
---
However, it’s really important to remember that streaks are expected in random sequences.  Some games (dota2 is a well known example), use non uniform distributions to reduce the impact of rng on the outcome of matches - the more hits you get without an ability proccing the likelier it becomes.  It then resets to a number below the expected rate to prevent a streak.  I’m gonna guess wow does not do this.
---
Also you’re gonna need days worth of windfury data.
---
That’s alright! As long as you’re enjoying the grind that’s all that matters.
---
I hate pictures like these where i have to look at everything in the picture and search for the thing op is refering to.
---
On major domos' chest in Molten Core.  Am I able to  join the raid after The Eye of Divinity has dropped and get it looted to me?  I believe that worked in Vanilla. Thank you!
---
Can you please enable advanced combat logging, start logging via `/combatlog`, and reproduce this bug? I need to confirm my suspicions about what is happening here with the time stamps provided with combat log events.
---
That gem went previously unnoticed. Oh how the mighty have fallen.
---
I started with a savannah huntress from the barrens and used it until my Stranglethron tiger. The tiger has a slightly increased attack speed and dash.
---
Try installing the Twitch app.  From here you will be able to browse, download and update add ons all from one easy to navigate location.
---
Thats how you go oom
---
ima just say it because im fairly certain its going to be the new meta: warriors, go black dragonscale 3 pc minus legs. 3 pc gives 2% crit and you'll come out ahead with AP.
---
I couldn't disagree more. Classic is a blast to play IMO. PvP feels fun because abilities are impactful and you notice them. It isn't balanced, but being "balanced" is what killed the fun of the game in so many ways. Look how PvP is just flat out dead now on live compared to many expansions ago. This is something that can't really be argued either, I mean hell we used to have entire forums dedicated to PvP discussions, and it just went away as people said fuck it. PvP wasn't the best in vanilla, far from it, but its more enjoyable to me than the crap that's on live now. When everyone has everything and fights take forever to finish. 
---
I just like how on classic every class has it's strengths too. There is no class that is just pure garbage in PvP.

There is no allegiance to a side, I have no emotional attachment to a side, it’s just a game in the end of the day. 
---
That’s like asking people why do you like a playstation over an xbox. people can still use both.
---
I’m talking BRD gear. I was wearing low level green plus healing bracers until the 40s or later. I’m talking damage and healing gear
---
The main culprits are omnicast boots and the cape from the hound boss. They’re both pretty much bis for healers too 
---
A feral druid would never use spell damage I don’t think you have the experience for input
---
What game are you playing?
---
Undead players aren't labeled as humanoids tho ?
---
You're kind of missing like 30%-50% of the game if you only ever play one faction.  So, I think it's worth it just on those grounds.    
---
I like having a character on each faction in order to enjoy both sides of the story.  Sometimes I want to group with a shaman, sometimes with a paladin.  Depending on the server, the type of people you'll be in contact with will also change drastically.
---
not a single point of threat from the hunter transfers to the healer in ANY situation
---
it's literally NOT how threat works
---
Are you trolling by not linking an actual picture?
---
Where are all these green quests at? My warrior is 41 and every quest I can find is yellow.
---
I've never seen gorosh or the chest but I see the ogre an avg  1.5 times per 5 runs really annoying.

If I'm going combat rogue - what order do I use my talent points? I can't find a guide that tells me.
---
spam hamstring, levels up weapon skills nicely because if you miss you still get a skill point and don't lose any rage
---
Now try that with a druid plays all 3 roles, at least shards you can delete them
---
Who would you give sulfuras then? It's nothing but a pvp weapon.... And for warriors there are far better options
---
I’ve gotten two ever and I’ve been 60 since launch week. They were from the same node on consecutive days last weekend
---
I ran into a bot in azshara that was farming satyrs.  He would do the usual stuff- ran in straight lines, kill, loot, sometimes sit to eat.  He was a rogue and never once used stealth.  He had a really simple route, only about 10 mobs so it was easy to predict where he was going.  I killed him a few times, and it was weird he could *kind of* fight back.  Since he could apparently only use basic skills he would just chase me, again, in a straight line, like the fucking terminator never catching up.  Being a warlock it was pretty easy to kite him or fear him into mobs.  I did this this for like an hour.  If you quit doing damage to him he would return to his farm spot so I equipped a level 1 curse of agony and got him to chase me into ashenvale where the guards killed him.  I waited 10 minutes for the rez timer but he never came back so I can only assume it interrupted his script or maybe all his gear broke.
---
You need to empty the first quiver to be able to replace it. Just like some bags
---
I would compared it more to rooting for both teams in a sports match :p
---
No worries then. Perhaps an lol, a smiley face, or a thank you may help you out with your responses.
---
I did empty the first quiver of all arrows and am still having the same problem :(
---
Are lollipops only from the Halloween event? Because if so then this theory wouldn’t pan out since I had the same exact thing happen over a month ago (horde side in org AH). I mean you may be right, but it prolly could be any item and it just shows as a lollipop for whatever reason.
---
too fucking real...
---
Coolest glitch I ever encountered was a replicatable bug where your enslaved demon would suddenly last permanently. Even after logging in and out it would still be there, but the pet bar would be be gone. However, you could then summon a normal pet demon and control two pets with one pet bar. I'm currently leveling a warlock to see if it still exists in vanilla or not.
---
You just gotta chose the right file path, ez pz
---
Then why you play the game? There are way more entertaining games. If it's not the lore and the adventure experience of the game why do you  enjoy the long hours of running from one place to another, profession farming, level grinding etc etc etc?
---
which is a good point. city raids are lame substitute for no bgs
---
Because I like raiding and pvp. Nothing to do with lore
---
 [https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/priest-healer-pve-stat-priority](https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/priest-healer-pve-stat-priority) 
---
Sorry about that. D: (Assuming you mean't "doesn't"). I should have mentioned it in this comment. Renew has a coefficient of 1 as per icy veins. So 1 spell power = 1 additional health healed. That's why I forgot to mention it.
---
Yes, CU is basically vaporware at this point. It’s been “in development” since 2012.
---
I have an addon that lets me ignore infinite people
---
It also lets me ignore from certain guild names.  Look into that
---
I don't get mad, but I definitely understand where you are coming from. Before I started playing, my good friend hyped me up for about 6 months. All he talked about. And one of the things I was led to believe is that DPS will let a tank build up threat on pulls before they attack. Ha. Haha. Hahahaha. I've never seen this happen once, and as a completely new wow player, it makes me self conscious when mobs start running all over and I'm frantically trying to grab them all. What I think is funny, however, is how perfectly ok everyone seems to be with running dungeons this way. My first time tanking uldaman, I was constantly asking for tips and asking if I was doing ok because mobs were just running all the over place, I couldn't hold aggro on a single enemy for more than a few seconds. Everyone says, "you're doing great man". Lol, really? Cuz it doesn't feel like it lol. I've come to the conclusion that most people have ran the majority of the content so many times that it's just not a challenge for them at all anymore, regardless of how well I tank. As long as the healer is the good most runs end well. That's been my experience, at least.
---
Classic has changed. DPS are entitled. I get asked to 'hold aggro' yet I'm using sunder etc on CD. I played a rogue in classic and it was YOUR fault if you pulled aggro. It was YOUR fault if you died. In MC, Rogues weren't even entitled to heals! We had to bandage and avoid damage.
---
What I don't understand is why do rogues not vanish at 75% to clear aggro and go dps crazy? Why do hunters not feign death proactively instead of re actively? Why is it the tanks fault for not generating threat?
---
I find as I get more tanking gear, I don't generate more threat, I take less damage. Whilst dps are ever increasing their threat generation. How do they not comprehend this ? Why has these responsibilities been so lost in classic but so enforced in vanilla? I really don't want to tank, even for friends, and I enjoy tanking.
---
There is no etiquette
---
https://i.imgur.com/nGvglfN.jpg
---
Dude, you have the strongest conviction to spend hours and hours of leveling and grinding just to enjoy pvp and raiding.
---
&gt;img
---
I sincerely hope you get banned for trolling.
---
That's 3 whole seconds after he tries to pop vanish.
---
At 0:06 you can easily pause to see the projectile less than a foot away from him, mid-air, while he has the vanish buff
---
Hey. What bow is that?
---
I never had issues like that. People in my group communicated like normal humans and agreed on something that was ok for all of us.
---
I said "let me mind soothe this pack" and sometimes people were ok with it and sometimes people wanted to clear it just to be on the safe side. 
---
Sometimes we cleared packs that can be skipped (a couple those in Scholo) and sometimes we didnt. And most of the time people didnt care if we skipped packs or didnt.
---
If a mage got aggro from aoe he usually used some cooldowns to survive. If he dies tank would usually type something like "wait 3sec for aggro", mage would say "sry" and we moved on.
---
Most runs I had people say basically nothing and we just clear the thing. People never threw tantrums when they didnt get their way.
---
Honestly I cant relate at all.
---
I recommend getting the Questie Add-On. Helps out a tremendous bit. Good luck!
---
I think Skystriker? Not sure of the name. It’s a level 34 BOE with 2.10 speed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma
---
**Prisoner's dilemma**
---
The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma", presenting it as follows:
---
Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other.

This needs someone to make a scankey diagram: http://sankeymatic.com/build/
---
Is that a druid boasting on about 1v1 open world pvp? Outlandish.
---
Check to see if your Atlas Loot addon is up to date - I definitely see “random enchantment” in mine.
---
Wait so your telling me that as a prot pally if I cast BOK it will generate enough threat to essentially taunt?
---
Well, at least nowerdays all healers have green cloaks so it adds a bit of variety :)
---
I remember Laughing Sister attack Bears in Ashenvale
---
Get intercepted and hamstrung again. Die for real. Rinse, repeat.
---
Elunes’s Grace is literally the worst priest racial, you cannot dodge while casting and it is dispellable. Priests with good gear are hard to kill, that is why premade teams cc them instead of killing them, and dwarves have an answer to fear and blind. Elves and humans sit in 20 second cc chains while their team gets killed off.
---
Oh, no. You’re right. My bad.
---
Transfer one char play with another on classic?
---
that one achievment
---
The wolf is hungry and didn't notice you were there until you started shooting at the dude 2 inches away from it
---
&gt; There was a ranged shot in the air during the 2nd attempt, which is EXACTLY MY ENTIRE POINT.
---
The SECOND vanish attempt is at 0:10. Do you even read what you write yourself? Jesus fucking christ
---
Can anyone actually talk me out of rolling a gnome warrior? I’m thinking of rolling ally on a new server as an alt, and the combo really seems fun. Other than the usual “that’s just not optimal stat wise” is there any real drawback?
---
I played with a guild I loved on a private server as a feral OT all the way thru naxx. They told me they didn’t want a feral in classic so I rolled one on a different server and now am main tank and raid leader for a top 20 guild (US). FeelsGoodMan
---
My personal favorite is “wheezed softly”
---
Yea sadness for rogues and mages. Too many rude ahats who treat everyone like an npc, only there to help them. That would frustrate me.
---
If you want to craft your own gear then LW is good, but if you want to make money or min/max then I would choose something else like herbalism for gold.
---
At level 39, I have literally never looted a bag
---
Amen!!
---
Haha probobaly stupid, but I like the idea!
---
Heartseeker and Earthfury need Horde.
---
Yes it does. Spam heals means you're always topped off
---
Any warrior who isn't tanking DM or Start Live is leaving gold on the table.
---
Do counterweights and sharpening stones even do anything for druids ?  
---
I thought their melee damage was independent from weapon damage
---
I'm having trouble seeing on Icy Veins where the order is for talent builds. Sure, it shows you a complete lvl 60 one, but what order were they used in wile leveling?
---
I think that’s the biggest part, at the moment you can clear onyxia and MC in 1 night. I’ve already got an epic mount, enchanted preraid BIS gear so what else is there for me to do at the moment?
---
Really hope they bring out pvp in November, people are going to be very bored if not.
---
You don't have issues with felhunter locks? :p that's your natural counter.
---
No, he his spec is trash, because its centered around a bad talent, not because lots a hybrid spec.
---
You legit could rsync your settings on a script to launch the game if we weren't all using launcher tokens for authentication these days.
---
RIP the good ol' days of username and password.
---
Except they're the best at group PvP too...  they're good solo as well.
---
O am on my phone atm, so I won't do the math, but it isn't hard to do.  14 AP is 1 dps.  1 in 5 attacks proc wf use 1 atk per second with main hAND
---
*Their intelligence is growing*
---
It is indeed auctioneer. That bloated mess of a tooltip is indistinguishable.
---
You can heal
---
Wow snobs.... there back
---
I always will. Its a long term investment from my perspective.  I am there to tank.  If DPS trusts me to do what I want them to do it makes everything much easier later on.   Lets say I need to go farm something.  Well, remember those 20 jed runs I took you on?   I want payback now.  Lets go out and farm xyz for what I need.  Quid pro quo.
---
If you think it sounds fun and don't care about optimal, just do it.
---
Which again is just a true statement of 60 dungeons but the post is about low level dungeons. Those are not single target dungeons so your statement makes no sense.
---
It doesn't help that the youtube dungeon guides are all fucking atrociously bad.
---
We're all melee DPS pre 36. It is literally all single target.
---
Any "of Shadow Wrath" cloth or wand that's level 45+ will sell quick to a Warlock. Bear, Monkey, Whale all sell well too, as others have pointed out.
---
u/titletoimagebot
---
As someone that has tanked 90% of dungeons to 60 twice on classic
---
This thread is ridiculous, everyone wants to be a dictator and act like the role is unbearably complex. All you do is pull, hold aggro to the best of your ability and let the dps/healer do the rest 
---
Fucking control freaks man
---
Bear here. I MTed MC the past 3 weeks.
---
1 % crit chest out of the tribute runs (for hunters). I did about 60 runs until I saw my first. In run 61, the second chest dropped.
---
Gear is relevant for last boss, not the other 3 tho
---
You sir, should eat a bag of d***s. 
---
Your strategy revovles around preassuring a shitty system (cds on patterns and recipe). 
---
You are removing enjoyment from many casual players for your own sake. 
---
Shame!!!
---
I'd go the other route.
---
Try it as a single player. No AH and no dungeon loot. Quests are fine including dungeon quests. But that blue off the boss? Nah. Those arent for you.
---
Would be interesting to see how far you could get acting as if it was a solo game
---
This worked for me! Finally got it, feels good
---
Crazy how that works. I've seen the sash 4 times and I've only seen Gorosh once, and obviously didn't drop the chest.
---
If it really was an accident, you can both open a ticket and a GM should help out.
---
Oh come on, why is that such a hurdle for you. I'm not gonna roll on a russian server incase I'm not able to speak russian, that's just ridiculous that we have to discuss why there's a principle there, lol. He's free to stay, but it's not adviced whatsoever unless he values these friends over his own experience.
---
#thesamepeoplewhowantednochangesnowwantchanges.
---
Tbh sounds like you're a slow tank, that's when dps gets 'I'll pull for you'. Most dps play with multiple tanks and know how far they can go with dps.
---
Tell the healer to call for mb or keep pulling even when they're low, usually they have a pot in store.
---
Man up mate, tanking=being alpha in the group
---
Why are their names plates yellow?
---
It's a PVE server.
---
Make a character on the other faction and announce where you're looking for fights.
---
Same for Spriests. I got Eagle while leveling and still using it so far. I lucked out on the Green Lens but this one is going to be a hard one.
---
Perfect, thank you.
---
&gt; saying that hunter pets could unstealth a rogue right after vanishing because it could "smell you".
---
XD
---
That's like losing the strat crossbow against another class as a hunter... oh wait, that happens a lot
---
It provides loot to underperformers.
---
If you are raiding with a guild you want the gear to go to the right places.
---
Chillin with friends after dungeon.  
---
Giving free balls to anyone who played with us.
---
Stallagg.
---
In low level dungeons "tank" doesn't mean what most people thinks it means. The tank is just the guy who gets all the mobs in the same spot; the guy who goes first. It's no different from grouping with 5 people and doing an elite quest in the open world. You don't actually need a "tank" in the sense that "no one else should be getting hit" until mobs are like level 56+
---
Don't think you can disenchant, enchanted items.
---
For the alliance!
---
More like warforging, since you only need to have 1 roll happen or not vs that nonsense of many rolls
---
Not optimal is only a minor difference at 60. We're talking 1 or 2 stat Points...
---
Someone elses skill up is worth nothing to me.
---
A rising tide may raise all ships but I fly.
---
nice! I didn't get lucky with random drops this time around. Back in Vanilla I had Truefaith vestment recipe drop which sold for good chunk of gold to get epic mount.
---
You chose to be on a PVP server. PVP stuff happens on a PVP server.
---
So you killed our leader, that was raised by humans and is up for peace with alliance anyway?
---
"Where the fuck do you think you're going, bitch?"
---
"somewhere other than here, sucka"
---
Is there any dedicated spec for this? I'm leveling a hunter which will solely be used for gold farming, seeing as tribute runs is one of the best methods through entire vanilla it seems interesting.
---
I totally agree, especially with a group as tanky as we were.  But there are more reasons than just threat to be using Sunder. Especially given our group comp at the time.
---
Very easily, Rockbiter on 1h with shield, level into enhancement for block etc.
---
Use ES as your main taunt and focus on marking targets with skull as dps [focus.you](https://focus.you) can earthbind totem or def totem, I like earthbind so that anyhting that runs to your ranged takes too long to get there and you should be able to win threat over again.
---
Exploiting the game is not PvP stuff
---
Yea, and then the dps flip their shit when you roll on dps gear.
---
If someone already pressed greed, which should be the go-to in these cases, you just screwed their chances...
---
this depends heavily on your tank, if your tank is a dps spec but tanking and you are shadow then it's going to be a bad time. 
---
and unfortunately it's easier to find heal specced healer than tank specced tanks so it's not fair but it is what it is
---
Does this honestly seem that surprising to you?
---
Stonetalon or hillsbrad
---
So true lol.
---
Though it gets better once you get your quest axe at lvl30. Once you get to lvl40 if you keep your gear mostly close to level you will do ok. Still a struggle though, compared to other classes.
---

---
ohhh ok, thanks
---
Did you report them?
---
Took me 6d /played for my hunter to reach 60, without any guide, but just dusty memories. What's your goal?
---
there's just no reason to farm hands of power if you can just buy felcloth gloves off the ah for a pretty cheap price. so i think if you can get your BiS gear that easily, it would be a dick move to roll need on it if you have a mage in your group for example.
---
Main goal for Classic was to get this mount on a Gnome Warrior.
---
Saw one in IF back in Classic with the Drillbore disk and the QS Sword and thought he looked so cool.
---
First, ran my ass to Teldrassil at level 3 after getting around 1s50c for profs, mining pick and skinning knife.
---
Made sure I did every NE Zone quest zone or ones that sent me there for spill over quests. - Dark Shore, Ashenvale, Feralas, had to skip a 2-3 in Stonetalon due to Horde.  
---
At level 50 when I did most quests that I could centering around NE, I was one bubble into Exalted.
---
Did a few BRD, ST for quests and got lucky winning the Dreadforge Retailiator drop on the 2nd quest run through BRD which was great because I knew I wanted to just farm cloth until 60.  
---
I farmed the Satyrs in NW Felwood from 52-54 for Runecloth and Felcloth. Droprates for both are pretty mediocre.
---
From 54-60 I exclusively farmed the Ogres in Deadwind Pass. And I mean nothing else that gave XP. Rationale was I was going to farm these anyways for Runecloth, might as well farm them for XP too and save quests for gold bonus at 60.  
---
I would pay a mage 99s 99c for full stacks of L45 food and fly to Deadwind and farm for 3-4 hours until I ran out.
---
I was about 8-9 bars in when I hit 60. I started doing quests I ignored in Felwood, Winterspring, Un'Goro, Azshara, EPL, WPL, Searing Gorge, Burning Steppes.  
---
Leaving ones that took too long, not-soloable, elites I went back to Deadwind and farmed the rest of the way. 
---
The ogres dropped Stockade Pauldrons(Sold for 90g), and only one Superior Strength enchant mat (Sold 69g to guildie) when I was 1-2 bars away from Exalted.
---
It's tougher now with a single layer, the cave with the Ogre Warlocks are highly contested through out all times of the day. Sometimes I wish I had rolled Human or Mage but nah.
---
They were in the inns upper room able to kill anyone who walked in there without guards attacking them. As well the top of the inn casting down on low levels
---
If you plan on doing PvP I'd create some macros just to save some space for keybinds. For example I have a macro that casts the highest rank Frostbolt I have, but casts level 1 Frostbolt when I press shift+that number. Useful if you just wanna slow someone real quick with a 1s Frostbolt cast. There's a bunch of other macros too, just google around a bit.
---
In PvE I'm pretty sure you can get away without any macros.
---
gms are understaffed they will probably get banned in a few days
---
What's the bag addon you have?
---
You cant say that 100% exclusive zones are not worth mentioning... Cmon you can level from 20 to 30 with out hordes contesting you. In hillsbrad there are quests for 30+ allys and if you are in pvp realm, most of the time this means if you are leveling there as horde you are getting your cheeks clapped by skull leveled allys left and right.
---
Accurate asf. Even with pots and food buffs and gear bought in AH I can still hardly handle 2 mobs.
---
That’s not manipulation at all, that’s always been the case and works anywhere, that’s the same way you farm bloodsail rep.
---
It's just a merit system.
---
You accrue points for whatever the GM deems is worthy. Usually it's attendance and boss kills. You then bid on loot with it, the idea is that it ensures regulars who pull their weight get loot.
---
However I've been screwed out of gear in the past by DKP so don't believe people when they say it's incorruptible.
---
GM who thought ("shit my fave healer doesn't have enough DKP to out bit this pleb...") "ohh, wow... good effort my fav healer! You get a bonus X amount of DKP, ohh!? you can out bit the pleb now...".
---
Usually guild leaders use a spreadsheet or a web based table to keep track. So they can fudge the numbers if they want. However if they do so they do so at the risk of drama.
---
I think there's a few plugins too.
---
It's situational. Are you tanking with sword and board? Are you 2 hand tanking, how much better is your weapon compared to the rest of the group, what is the ratio of pyshical dps compared to spell dps. Lastly how much of a dps increase is it, I think I read the melee cleave spreadsheet somewhere and its not that huge, sunder 5 in a raid is way different than in a dungeon. 
---
Just tank efficiently as long as your group is moving at a fast pace it really doesn't matter.
---
and it's healthier!
---
I am 45 and killed Tethis on my own without Retaliation yesterday. The feeling was great. But Gnomish Shrink Ray helped a little, and grenades. Also I died twice, once with 23HP on him, once with 66.
---
39 runs deep into strath UD, 27 into living, never even seen any of the necklaces drop for my warlock. 1 run into scholomance and vectus drops his necklace! Priest rolls need on it and roll a 100, I lose. "I'm going shadow when PvP comes out".
---
Okay, thanks Mr priest.
---
yes and yes
---
Have u enchanted the mace with healing power maybe?
---
If you name and shame with no evidence, you're lying.
---
That's how anyone doing such a thing on the internet should be treated.
---
It's right there
---
This is completely unnecessary.
---
Explain to me how you get bloodsail rep from killing low lvl players in spots the guards can’t attack you?
---
I play alliance. I’ve been one shot by those bastards.
---
10/10 play shaman
---
What's the best way to lvl a hunter pet quickly? I'm lvl 20 now with a lvl 10 bird and it's a fucking nightmare. Mobs my own level destroy me without a pet, mobs that are grey don't give XP to my pet. Help
---
Dude Icy Veins has a slider so you can see every 10 levels of talents at a time. 
---
Do you actually look at google results or wowhead or icy veins? I feel like the content on any of those is not the issue here.
---
Because you attack the guards instead?
---
Don’t like it? Take res sick and your away from them, simple.
---
Arcane Crystal, if I’m not mistaken.
---
rad
---
Great raid healers, and at least on my server they seem to be at a major shortage. We had 1 shaman get 4 pieces of loot in one night earlier this week because he was the only one we could find even after spamming LFG for more.
---
Up to the GM
---
I always let people k ow I enjoyed their presence if I did. Whether "nice chat man. Have a good one"
---
Or "the heals are flowing like my juices seeing these heals"
---
Or "holy fuck the mage knows where his off button is!"
---
I'm a druid tank so a little self honour is always good too. Especially if people get too serious.
---
"Dude. I'm a bear. I roar. I can kind of tank, pretend to be a rogue, heal but cant res,and I'm like a mage and can do caster da- shit I'm oom."
---
Just be the person youwish youd group with.
---
"Treat others as youd like to be treated."
---
Oh. Also told the gnome who kept trading me trying to make me die to fuck off and crawl up his moms ass where he belongs.
---
You know, the little things to keep the game going.
---
&gt;1% crit is still about 18 sp  
---
Where are you getting that number from?  
---
In pre raid BiS, my spreadsheet is telling me that 1% crit is worth 8.21 SP, which is way off your number of 18.
---

They weren’t doing it to attack the guards... they were exploiting around the guards to kill low lvl players. Not a single one attacked the guards

Like I said in another comment, the group was very stocky so the spread of the damage was no issue for survivability. It made our healer's life hell and he frequently ended the fight completely oom and going melee waiting for his mana regen to kick in. Yes, he was Sword and Board. It was 2 warriors a Druid and a Paladin, so some spell damage but majority physical. and again, it's not about trying to get sunder 5.
---
Bloodmage Thalnos has just over 1000 amor. Sunder 3 is 540 armor reduction. That's halfing his armor for 45 rage. Charge in and Bloodrage and by the time you've applied 2 stacks of Sunder, you've gained enough Rage to do a 3rd one. You've now perfectly set your group up for damage and you'll never lose threat. then you get to straight dps. It's not a ton of set up. 3 GCDs right at the beginning of the fight.

Assuming correct drop chance, it is more probable that he will get the item before you.   
---
For the same reason a coin lands both heads and tails, and dice land on each side, the previous outcome does not impact the current one, however given a large enough pool, the dice will land on all sides a close to equal amounts of times, unless loaded/surface imperfections/etc. Drop chances aren't affected by those physical imperfections, so the probability that an item drops in 1001 runs is higher than 1 run.  
---
An analogy, if you roll a 6 sided die, and it lands 99 times on numbers 1,2,3,4 and 5, the chances of the die landing on a 6 on the 100'th roll are still 1/6'th, nothing changes, however, rolling more and more, it starts becoming more improbable that the die doesn't land on a 6 (assuming a fair/untampered die) in the next 100 throws, and so on.

Not surprising, even with the fast loot addon (I'm assuming you have on autoloot AND you have the fast loot addon) the opener most likely happens either too fast for the actual looting process to take place OR, this might be related to the 'batching' system in place. My guess is that what happens is that first the pickpocket action is engaged (but no looting occurs yet, only pocket loot is opened up), and then the looting action DOESN'T take place next, the opener gets queued up next instead and THAT takes place.
---
I have so many good cool downs nobody bothers trying to gank me
---
thats what i was thinking myself... it cant be that hard. the real factor is how good your healing gear is, right?
---
Xmute arcanite has a 48 hour cooldown...it would have taken 8 days to do all five transmutes on one char.
---
Not even a joke. Had this happen to me. I have been hunting Cape of the Black Baron ever since I got level 60 \~a week after release. After what felt like 40 baron kills I finally saw the cape drop. Yes, drop. The other 39 kills I didn't even see it drop.
---
There was a druid in my group, he was the tank. He marvelled at my gear. Rhok'delar, 7/8 pieces T1, Onyxia Tooth Necklace...  only my cloak was still some green quest cloak. At the start of the run he said "The cloak is BiS for me, too. But I will pass for you. You have been trying to get it for so long mate."
---
Even though the druid promised, I was not the only one rolling need on it. The Ret Paladin rolled need, as well. And he won. He said "kthxbye" and hearthstoned out. The druid made a dumbstruck face, just as I did, and said "What was he even thinking?".
---
Not only I, but also the druid that so generously passed on it, got screwed over by that Ret on this day.
---
I have always been tolerable towards Ret Paladins. "Let them have their fun", I told myself. "They only enjoy the game, and vanilla raiding isn't that hard. No need to play something that's optimal." But from this day on, I began to really loathe people that play this garbage.
---
At the end of the day the difference is really negligible unless you are aiming for best healer then MAYBE all factors come in but what's the point?
---
Hey my dude, this has happened to me I feel you. If they were exploiting from a rooftop where the guards couldn’t physically get to them, or you couldn’t get to them that is against the rules. But the spot your talking about is just a blind spot to guards in the inn and isn’t against the rules. Call some guildies in to help or something. Good luck!
---
The equation is 26/0.003=8667 only if you decide **beforehand** that you'll look at the next 26 swings. If you have a long string of swings and are looking for any sequence of 26 consecutive nonprocs, then all but the last 25 swings are a start of one 26-swing sequence.
---
So 9000 swings would contain 8975 sequences of 26 swings. First one is swings 1-26, second one is swings 2-27, third one is swings 4-28, etc. If you are looking at 9000 swings recorded over 9h of gameplay you'd expect to see 8975*0.003 =~27 strings of 26 (or more) consecutive nonprocs. Or about 3/hour of gameplay, or one every 20 minutes.

I miss this the most playing horde without blood elf
---
I got my wife to play Classic with me, as growing up all my friends didn't play. 
---
I never had "friends" who I know in irl, play WoW except recently. I was visiting Chicago while visiting my hometown, and met up with my 2s partner as he is a Special Ed's Teacher in Chicago. Got Das Boot at the german pub and some more drinks later. It was a fun night :) 
---
He doesn't play classic, and I am kinda sick of 8.2.5 at the moment and I hadn't had the courage to tell him I am sick and tired of playing Ret / Arcane 2s. It just doesn't work. And Ret is blah without gearing so that is my own issue.
---
For Alliance it is Desolace, Arathi Highlands, Alterac Mountains, Swamp of Sorrows and partly STV.
---
They were in both. Just a long night in stv just to end off being camped trying to turn quests in
---
No, just get out there and start whacking people in the shins!
---
Both of us are definitely joking. :-)
---
People who don’t like druids tend to be min/max mentality people, they are not the best at anything (dps, tanking or healing) but have amazing versatility, great toolkit during raids and are great fun in PVP, especially organized pvp like WSG. If you want to have the best at something don’t be a Druid, if u like to do lots of things well Druid is great.
---
Ah, unfortunate.
---
If you have a drop from a boss on reserve you can swap to ML just before that boss. If res item drops, loot it to you, if another drops, shift click it to show it to the group and ask them to roll for it - give to winner. Set back to regular looting after sorting it out. Done!
---
You're not smooth
---
Druids are in high demand. But it's complicated. They are not the best healers, and their tier set is not that good. They also can't rez but once per hour, which can be rough in dungeons. However because few people play druids they are in high demand. As they have several vital abilities. They can restore another players Mana. And that once an hour rez, is the only rez that can be done in combat. Leveling a druid is great, and it's pretty easy to find a raid spot in guilds if you want to heal.
---
When "Transfer Aborted" actually saves you time...
---
They dont item recover random blues. I already tried when t0 boots dropped and they didnt get looted, they just \*poof\* vanished.
---
Only quest items that are not retrievable by other means such as carrot, skull etc. can be retrieved via this system.
---
9. More. Levels...
---
But in the end it doesn't even matter
---
Oh im evil.
---
They are as not many play them.
---
Druid feral dps is only somewhat middle of the pack on alliance side due to them not benefitting from WF. Requires you put in effort to farm MCPs.
---
Moonkin DPS suffers from mana issues on prolonged fights, but can pack quite a punch. You usually stack them up with mages or warlocks to get the crit buff, which is quite substantial. Playing a boomkin requires a lot of consumables to sustain mana though.
---
Bear tanking is top notch. You have more TPS than warriors and are tankier, but suffers from not having any cooldown...or thumbs, so you cant tank things like chromaggus. Also requires some effort put in to farm MCPs.
---
Druid healers are always loved, as they have innervate (and decurse). They have some of the highest manaefficiency in the game, but has generally lower throughput and no quick heals to pad meters, so you gotta compensate with a bunch of extra skill.
---
In dungeons during lvling your bags will be full of gearsets, as you basically just spam "DRUID LFG &lt;dungeon&gt;" since you can fill all roles efficiently.
---
&gt;Thrash displays in the combat log, quite literally stating the mob has gained an extra attack.

Relics are a gamechanger

At the moment, you're right. The moment relics hit the game, they're on par
---
I am a druid. I am special.
---
I mean I have almost exclusively done dungeons with dps specced tanks lol
---
I have done almost all of the end game dungeons healing as shadow with warriors not even using shields (not meaning every single run, just in general). Only one I have not done it with is strat.
---
Considering that people already know they'll cop month+ or even permanent bans for this kind of harassment, yes.
---
Hell i'm currently on a month long chat mute just for saying i'm sick of gays hitting on me and not respecting that i'm straight.
---
Whats the population ratio on that realm? Also how hard is 1-2 coordinated and prepared raids to stomp over all kinds of level range and not in raid random playeras around AH... lol  pathetic. Get ur ass in arena or rbg, then brag achievements. This is as good as group raid ganked STV
---
Few Pally related questions. 
---
Is there a good guide on a leveling spec? I assume a Ret/holy hybrid is the way to go but I’ve heard prot is good too. 
---
Is there a good guide on how to maximize playing Ret at end game? I planned on going a bit of hybrid to pick up some talents for off healing or buffing when needed but I’m primarily interested in maximizing my damage. I know it’s not ever going to be amazing but I wanna do the best I can do and have never really found a good guide for that (I.e. the consumes to carry, gearing, rotation, etc.).
---
Not right away though, even between pulls they usually wait until you begin to eat your own food and THEN they heal you, because then it looks like you're trying to take their job.
---
When people talk about insane threat abilities such as max rank earth shock, shield slam and in this case apparently GBoK, then they are well aware it isnt literally a taunt. 
---
They mean it generates so much aggro, that it basically serves as a taunt, because every mob will look at them.
---
IT eventually becomes a threat issue, as prot pallies run out of mana :D
---
damn, how many different versions of WoW were you playing at the same time?

You are very right. But some people get hurt. It's ridiculous. Had a priest leave a deadmine run b4 it began because he was already shielding the tank (we were doing the quests outside and ALREADY having issues with threat.)
---
He goes "oh another party that's going to kick me for using bubbles?"
---
I respond "what? Of course not!" 
---
I figured he didnt know how rage generation on tanks work. I explained and he left the group "I know how to heal and you're too opinionated for me."
---
Like dude.... just take some advice.
---
I mean. I legit just had a mage that didnt know to buff me, the healer, with arcane int. He also didnt trade me water when I traded him and said "I'm thirsty please!"
---
Took the tank to caps "MAKE THE HEALER WATER MAGE."
---
He then traded the hunter.
---
"Wtf lol not me trade pocket." -hunter
---
Then he trades me 40 water. And 2 pulls later trades me again. 40 more. I'm like "dude I got plenty lol."
---
Long story short. This crap mage (I thought) was just obviously new and had no issues going forward after some advice. He didnt listen the first 3 times as it must've been missed. It took something that looked mean to get his attention.
---
He got 3 blues that run. Thanks us for the patience and told us to have a goodnight.
---
That priest though? Absolute child.
---
Some people will hear you OP. Others won't.

I just repeat the serenity prayer xD

Well, it’s doable if I kite them, but that’s a pain in the ass. And melee fighting them is just a shitshow

I've gone to the site multiple times - where on this screen is the slider? You're being unnecessarily condescending.
---
5 stacks on sunder basically almost doubles my damage on a target as a shaman...
---
Yah basically. I woulda used two swords but the dagger just got way more dps than any sword Ive gotten so far
---
Where the level 22 snapping turtle in the water?
---
Just a warning, but if you are interested in raiding finding a guild for a ret paladin will be real hard.
---
Do you want to raid or PvP?
---
nah sorry that's ridiculous
---
tank privilege is that he gets to roll need on any items he wants for offspec or main spec 
---
if you are dps warrior you wait and see or ask if the tank needs something before needing it yourself.
---
Can you link the Discord? I'm also wondering what to farm without gathering professions.
---
Every single RFK dungeon ive been in, theres been a huntard trying to get corpsemaker....
---
On my realm, things like that work... On most realms, it won't

That's a realm thing, not a classic vs retail thing

Just tame a let that is your level.

Please do not pre-shield tanks.  I click it off if I see it.

Am i hypercasual? Im only lvl 28..

What are the other bugs besides feign death? Genuinely asking

This post reminds me of a guy I knew who played with 6 ping on the regular. If he logged in and saw his ping was about 8, he would log out immediately because according to him the game was "unplayable". Weird fellow.
---
It kinda does create a toxic environment yes
---
Of the eagle has been keeping my mage alive pretty easily. Always enough mana and can even use mana shield without gimping pulls until you have ice barrier.
---
&gt; so you wont need to taunt
---
Considering they don't have taunt, that seems fair
---
having played a lot of pservers, IMO s3 with BT pieces (excluding the ridiculousness of warglaives) was the best PVE PVP balance. S4 with sunwell just amped things up to absolutely ridiculous levels while BT gear was better balanced against s3 gear, a lot of the DPS heavy items lacked stam and the weapons weren't THAT much better
---
s4 + sunwell was just ridiculous

I use the naga with 12 buttons and never going back. U can shift 1-12 and ctrl1-12 thats 36 spells binded not even counting the F or R or E.

How are the prices of core leather for you guys? On my server it’s is going for 2.5g ea, but back in the day I remember it going for close to 40g ea

Priest only has a group heal that is extremely costly to use and cannot be used outside their grp... People generally dont use it...
---
I do this to see what guild people are in lol
---
Oh you guys don't have a healer? How are you doing the dungeon as all melee and no healer?
---
Same scenario last night, me as a mage and healer needed and the healer got it feelsbadman
---
yeah im thinking of just buying gear like that but I also want to see if some blues from dungeons will give me better stats for it.
---
In sane
---
Holy shit.
---
If you're frost, you can ice-block - cold snap - ice block for the BW duration and then try. Though if the corpse run isn't long the hunter will kill you next time since BW is on 2 min cooldown while cold snap is 10 min.
---
Keep in mind that there's plenty of other trinkets which do damage. Or the offhand. Like the book of dead, people called it trash and I nearly won the roll on it.
---
Dude. Pop the skeleton, switch to your regular offhand(+20 sp aquamentas for me).
---
It's a free skeleton. OP
---
Copy pasting my comment from other day when somebody asked the same question.
---
 I dinged 60 with like 8 of pre-raid BiS, but now a decent amount of items are from Dire Maul which is a bit harder. I would say you can do most of these like 2 lower than I said here if you got for example a full guild run or a bunch of lvl 60s that know what they are doing. But these are the lvls I would go with randoms in lfg channel. Failing/rough runs is just such a waste of time I like to be on the safe side.
---
Helmet: green BoE + healing from AH (55 is best I believe), requires lvl 50
---
Animated Chain Necklace: boss before last boss in Stratholme UD, needs lvl 60
---
Burial Shawl: like 1% drop from multiple bosses in Scholomance and a bit higher from Barov. I would say 60. Lower level is acceptable too, but I think this instance is actually the one I had the most problems with just because people take lvl 58s+ who have no idea what to do. You can get the second best shoulders from AH "Elder Wizard's Mantle" or the first boss that has prison key in brd which you can do at lvl 52 doing "quest" or "xp" runs.
---
Hide of the Wild: Craftable boe, before you get that an alternative is the Cloak of the Cosmos from Immolthar Dire Maul West, lvl 60 because its easy to get, cloak from the boss with prison key in brd lvl 52, and the +healing rare from boss in Stratholme living which is rare and requires 60 I would say.
---
Robes of the Exalted: final boss in Stratholme UD, lvl 60 - the actual BiS is Truefaith Vestments which requires tailoring 300 which you should get imho.
---
Flameweave Cuffs of Healing: Incendius from BRD. These are a bit hard to get because they need to drop first and then roll the proper enchantment. If you are doing a quest run (early parts) you can do that at like 52. Lava run (you kill Incendius and Emperor) is something I did at 56, but they are a little bit tricky and you need to do it with others who know what they are doing and can help you the first time and have some patience to explain lava running and how to skip the torch room. An alternative is to buy a green bracer with 33 healing (same as these), but without 10 Fire Resistance which is basically the same.
---
Hands of the Exalted Herald: from killing Moira (she is with Emperor and you need to save her once to be able to get loot from her, the quest chain starts from The Smoldering Ruins of Thaurissan). lvl 56
---
Whipvine Cord: final boss in Dire Maul East, lvl 55 but maybe people wont take you because your higher lvl would mean more trash would need to be cleared. The actual healing is easy.
---
Padre's Trousers: hunter boss from Dire Maul West, lvl 60
---
Boots of the Full Moon: Captain boss from Dire Maul North, lvl 60
---
Fordring's Seal: quest chain from Fordring. The first quests are lvl 56 (require 52) and you need to go into Stratholme living. I only did this dungeon once honestly, but I found it kinda not super easy so lvl 60 probably.
---
Rosewine Circle: War Master Voone from lbrs, lvl 55-56
---
Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas: quest reward from book "Holy Bologna ..." which can be bought on AH cheap and requires you to go to library in Dire Maul. Lvl 60
---
Mindtap Talisman: Magister boss in Dire Maul West, lvl 60
---
Mana Channeling Wand: from final Ogre Magi boss in Dire Maul North, lvl 60
---
The Hammer of Grace: one handed mace that drops after opening 12 coffers vault in BRD or The Vault of the Seven from BRD. Lvl 52 lets say. The problem with getting this is that finding runs that do this is super hard because the only good loot is this hammer and there is no incentive for anyone to do this except healers afaik. I think I never saw somebody asking for people for a full run of BRD (takes 2h) or a run that opens vault in chat. I had to start one myself at 60, and lead a bunch of low lvls who were interested in exp. A decent alternative until you do this is staff from Emperor which you can do at 56.
---
Brightly Glowing Stone: offhand from last boss in Dire Maul North. You can get it during Tribute runs too. Lvl 60
---
Shit. What do you do then?
---
why?
---
I thought healbot and other addons couldnt decide what heal to use for you anymore?
---
He will likely feign death in the middle of your frostbolt cast so don’t rely on it, you’re better off CoC and fire blasting him into a couple of arcane explosions. Or if you have cold snap you can do the above twice.
---
Tanks are boring and rely on group play to get anything done. You're useless outside of dungeons, you can't grind mobs or do pvp on the fly. I totally respect the people that sacrifice their fun to tank/heal, but it's not really smth I enjoy.
---
They want money.  Micro transactions get them more more then sub counts.  They want micro transactions.
---
I do this all the time. Common courtesy...
---
If I was you I would farm some Crowd Pummelers and see if you wanna farm at least 10-15 every week (cat), or rather 1-3 (bear).
---
Tried to farm that shit for 40 runs...never dropped, gave up and got one from DM instead.
---
You look like jason-antigoni
---
You took a screenshot of irl
---
This is really impressive. 
---
Would you mind telling me how you got this good at 2 on 1 battles ?, just so much arena in the past ?
---
A.lot.
---
Okay, can someone help me differentiate between a couple of different weapons for a DPS warrior? (human two handed).
---
The Rockpounder, Barbarous Blade, and Bonecrusher? Which one is the best out of those, I'm having troubled deciding. I already have rockpounder so is it even worth going for either of the other two?
---
Or should I ignore all of those and try to get Dreadforge Retaliator even though I'm a human
---
I'm leveling my druid as feral -&gt; resto. I'll probably take LotP first and then respec for HotW/NS closer to 60 so I can tank/heal/dps in dungeons and also sologrind. I'll probably make a macro that I'll click then invited saying I'll probably need on all tank/healer/rogue gear if it's an upgrade over my current since I'm specced so that I can do all roles.
---
I'll just repost with a normal pic
---
If they get the cast off don’t stealth... it can’t be used to evade spells that have already been cast. Should have waited for the first bolt to hit you then vanished.
---
Back in the day people used a week to clear MC
---
I am a healer dudu with a tank OS. We can never find a tank, so sometimes i just say fuck it and tank, and the healer flips out when i take his healer gear... DMW for you right there.
---
its about 60-70% horde, not that it matters you sound like someone that cries a lot about others having fun
---
No don’t! This is much better
---
What server?
---
People were unaware it generated extra threat from righteous fury, as the wording on RF implies it wouldn't
---
That is not the leveling guide, which was the third result on google:
---
https://www.icy-veins.com/wow-classic/classic-rogue-leveling-guide
---
Then choose Swords or Daggers, and talents are at the top with a slider.
---
Ya fucking donut.
---
I think you'll have fun on a pve server, provided it's populated... Some pve servers have more active pvp players than other pve servers, so some research might help
---
Toggle pvp on if u decide you want to allow someone the opportunity to gank you, and toggle it off if not.
---
I'd expect plenty of people will pvp on pve servers come phase 2
---
I rolled pvp but went pve in vanilla. I enjoy both. I don't mind being occasionally ganked on pvp servers, but I DO mind the people on my faction who want me to join in, killing enemy players 30 levels below, or "friendly" enemies who are vulnerable questing. You do you, but don't act shitty because that isn't what I enjoy doing
---
Good luck everyone, my favorite moment had to have been and will always be walking through The gates of Stormwind for the first time.
---
Resisted
---
I had the name hemosexual and someone reported it, I was devostated
---
I dunno if this is top level, but the 24 hours of chaos that followed the opening of the AQ gates will always be the best memories for me
---
This is actually pretty big. This might allow Prot Paladins to use full mitigation gear with fast attack speed and seal of wisdom and just rely on GBoK to and mana regen from a fast weapon like Flurry axe to tank.
---
&gt;Blizzard will likely not create an entire work around on the spell batching system for just a few abilities
---
Nor should they, they should simply remove spell batching entirely, it's absurd we are forced to deal with that in 2019, I really can't grasp why people actively like bad game design forced on them.  It was a technical limitation that improves nothing.
---
Hello, we are accepting prot paladins as of this moment. Come to Orgrimmar for gear inspection (Earthshaker EU).
---
That WOW classic in the bottom left tho, *they knew! *
---
Seriously
---
Last time was 2 days ago, where the other hunter in the group SPECIFICALLY explained to the huntard why corpsemaker was a dreadful item for hunters (he said he had lost it the past 2 runs). When we got to the boss, it dropped, i rolled on my enha sham and won. He got mad, i kicked him because id rather 4man it than waste more time with someone who is incapable of understanding the basic concept of str = no boom for hunters...
---
I ignored mine and went for the 2nd best
---
5% drop rate then have to get lucky with frozen wrath. No thanks
---
Another programmer here, can confirm having 999k gold is impossible. There is no combination of 1s and 0s that can represent this number within 32 bits. Maybe it was 99k and your mind added another 9 subconsciously. Nobody has perfect memory. Or it happened in Cataclysm when gold was changed to a 64 bit integer.

The beautiful thing about raids in classic is they layer on top of each other without completely obsoleting each other or overwhelming players with too much "optional" content.
---
The LFR/Normal/Heroic/Mythic stack with a full expansion level power spike between each raid tier just feels kinda gross, oversimplified and overly burdensome with how much time you can spend on them if you feel compelled to do all the difficulties for whatever reason. (Titanforging incentivized people to actually do this, at least early on.)
---
Answer my question. In a PUG then, am I entitled to roll on anything I want because I can use the gold from vendoring it? 
---
This is the same argument you are making here. Literally the same. Its a PUG so people can need roll on anything they please for whatever reason?
---
He looks like he’s about to blow that treasure chest
---
About 80 ST dragon runs, and I have yet to see ANY spell damage Drakestone.
---
Those one or two misses really add up
---
This is true.  Wanna know why level 60 gnome mages go around wrecking horde/low levels? It’s because the entire time they were leveling they were getting killed on sight and camped constantly. Became bitter and then started taking it out on different horde players as payback.
---
Same but mine is water.
---
in vanilla as ally i never really touched swamp of sorrows or badlands. But with questie showing what quests are availible in capitals swamp is rly good now. And badlands had a decent amount of Qs aswell. 
---
Im also surpised that dustshallow wasnt as terrible as i rememberd.
---
Could be ghost mushrooms. 3 spawns in skulk rock in the Hinterlands.

does an oom pally healer who's only usefulness in the fight is auto attacking count?

RP servers have special name rules, gotta follow them.
---
It's stupid that someone can report a name and it immediately gets flagged for a rename, even though theres nothing wrong with it.
---
I'll take "never happened" for $100.
---
I'm thinking the same for seal of command. I believe Blizzards rng calculation uses some value like cpu clock time to get its procs from. Maybe they are using a different value, which is used for procs individually and with spell batching, once the check is made the value to calculate the proc has already been reset, and as such always comes up as false. Seal of Command definitly is getting calculated differently then in classic, the calculation for it to hit or not is done after the attack happens and not before.
---
My favorite is when I specifically wait a minute before bandaging/cannibalizing/eating, just to see if the healer is going to heal me, he doesn't, I start bandaging aaaaaaand there's the heal.
---
I disagree. SW is unreliable due to the long CD. Druids have much higher hp pools, physical mitigation and TPS compared to warriors. In order to generate adequate threat, warriors needs to dual wield making the succeptible to crits and crushes, so that argument against the druid is worthless.
---
People saying that druid tanks are sub par, are just parrotting youtubers who dont really know anything about tanking.
---
Does Renew snapshot when cast? If you had some other gear or buff when casting that could perhaps account for it - otherwise I have no idea. Spiritual Guidance can't explain it either I think, it'd have to be an awful lot of int to be a major contributor.
---
Weird - but since you can't recreate it, perhaps some buff/gear and snapshotting?
---
"Progress" aka wiping over and over and over and over and over....don't worry about missing that part of raiding.
---
I did that for original classic. You could loot Heads in AV, I had the famous Dwarf Priest on our Server head in my bank well into TBC.
---
I'm not really sure where the 'more impactful' comments come from, honestly.  I don't see how Eye Beam or Heroic Leap could ever be referred to as not impactful by any definition of the word.  TTK is lower if you're smashing ungeared folks with a Hand of Rag, for sure, but there are loads of impactful abilities in pvp in retail, easily seen if you watch some of the arena tourneys.  But I even mentioned that if you enjoyed pvp classic has some appeal.  I'm all for having preferences but some of these arguments are just making things up.
---
No I wouldn't because I'm not an asshole that thinks I'm more important than everyone else who put in equal work. 
---
Not everybody approaches loot in the game so selfishly.
---
Oh dang, really. That's really helpful, thank you. I made this toon to try and surprise a friend of mine, I did not read the rules.
---
Can’t believe you don’t dedicate a bag to scrolls to buff other players who are so kind as to ask.
---
Report report report.
---
I honestly didn’t bother going there after seeing the amount of people camping the pattern + a warlock doing that. I just killed the lock then went back to org and bought the recipe for 36g. I made the gold back in 2 days. I took a screenshot of the lock and submitted it in my report.
---
It’s interesting the different tactics people use for these runs. I’ve pfobsbly done 100+ tribute runs in the last couple weeks and mine look way different than yours
---
Though on the flip side they rape in PVP and will always be welcomed in pre mades
---
Why do you have [nocomabt] mod in bloodrage? If you cast it in combat you gain a little extra threat and it doesn't put you in combat. Also if you go zerker stance and use berserker rage and then go defensive, you'll get much more rage in combat
---
Again, stop crying, it's the option you chose by going on a pvp server
---
Doesnt everything in instances chase forever?
---
&gt;if they don't the dps will and then you will still be lo
---
It’s because you have rage and it’s decaying. So if you don’t pull quickly you’ll have to pull without rage and have to auto attack a few time before using a skill, making it almost impossible to keep agro
---
Dps warriors don't get as much BIS gear out of raids, as other classes, because their sets are mostly for tanking.
---
Raiding, dungeons and DM East lasher farming is all you can do as a holy paladin now.... Also group pvp later.
---
Definetely gonna have to level an alt for soloing/pvp in the open world...
---
If I had to pick only one class to play, it definetely would not be a paladin.
---
I've compared it to recount and skada, and details! have always been far superior. Especially in range. Most dungeons people topped their own meter with Recount or Skada, but with Details! it was always the exact same for everyone.
---
i played a rogue back in the day. current vanish works exactly like it did back in the day. sorry for you
---
Oddly you can mount up ON the lift, but the platforms for some bizarre reason are considered an indoor space &gt;.&gt;
---
Actually it is pvp by definition
---
Yes premades,
---
You sound like a prick tbh. Instead of complaining on a fucking web forum, just go dps and stop bitching about the same shit we've all seen 100 times in this sub. It's not going to get any better. You'd be much better off playing the latest expansion
---
No it indicates that I’m surprised that 2 people would cancel the trade.
---
Amplify magic on the mage?
---
i played a rogue back in the day and today. it's not worse.
---
Ben drowned, didn’t he?

Easily replicated too. If I recall correctly, you can run up against the door on the top floor, and when the elevator arrives, the door opens and somehow you clip through the elevator and fall to your death.
---
That might've been [Bloodcaller](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19864/bloodcaller), which looks pretty much identical.
---
dm:e is 1-3 with 1 guaranteed (can confirm, am doing this myself)
---
and I heard there is the same situation in dm:n but I can't solo that so I can't tell for sure
---
Grow some thicker skin, thank you, lol ;)
---
Gear is definitely relevant for the last boss. If you're below 3k HP, 250 shadow spell damage the fight can be very punishing and you're sometimes forced to use health potions.
---
Having a few of the better T1 pieces helps a lot on that fight.
---
The gnolls aren't coded as a pack
---
Thanks for your answer but i already found that out myself :P everything is working now
---
It is not griefing lol, it is pvp by definition and it is what you chose. When you get mad overthink your choice instead of blaming others.
---
Entirely possible to do in Ashenvale/STV with Purple Lotus and Swamp of Sorrows with Blindweed. I think any reasonably devoted herbalist will hit cap around 40.
---
Do you farm elemental fires and dreamfoil? Because that shit takes a lot of time...
---
There's not even nearly enough vendor trash to make 30-50g per hour from lasher farming.
---
Thank you for saying this
---
At level 19 that’s not really a surprise.
---
Got the belt for offspec on my shaman the other day after it dropped twice in a row and our mage got it the first time. Haven't even seen Gorosh yet.
---
T2 pants are sick, but they were buffed really late in vanilla to this state. They are far too strong right now.
---
As a Tauren warrior,
---
how did you get this screenshot of me?
---
No melee classes can kill me. Best healer in the game. Best buffs in the game. But the best part is that I'll be able to wear the most awesome gear set in the entire game.
---
Hmm we tried this and she still went through 4-5 others before the tank.
---
dazed
---
You are not useless outside dungeons as a tank. 
---
And who pvp as fury if I may ask?
---
He is the taxi driver that drives you in circles to charge you more money.

WoW just came out and my friend gave me the starter pack with a (14-day??) trial. My wooden-pc barely managed to run it and oh boy leveling was hard with fps like 2. Created a human mage and i remember when my friend casted a fireball with hes PC. I was like "oh, so that's how it supposed to look :D".
---
Had an Ele-Shaman back in vanilla named Blitzkrieg, nice fit I thought.
---
Got reported and even banned for 3 days iirc
---
Did they lower the drop rate for orbs and raise it for arcane crystals?
---
I remember seeing this, maybe it was a thing when people were not trying to efficiate everything but rather tried to get to 60 'at some point' rather than after 3.5 days played?
---
Or maybe common courtesy is dwindling at the same rate as common sense seems to be.
---
That's not a victory at all. Don't know how people think it is lol. I didn't die so nobody won.
---
Both Mara and DME are a lot more gold per hour with herbalism, but I wouldn't personally bother with DME over Mara if you don't have mining because DME takes around 30-40 minutes to complete in average gear, and most of the loot drops are around 2g each.
---
Dominating every class in 1on1 :P
---
This. We feel your pain rogues. Us hunters have had it pretty bad and it doesn't look like it's going to get any better.
---
Salty boy plays the "no life" card  :D
---
As stated many times before you should overthink your choice and btw you compete from the moment your character was created by definition. If you just want to pvp when you are in the mood go to a pve server  ;)
---
&gt;  you run into what you eventually learn are the Silithid
---
I don't remember this part. Who do you run into?
---
Since it doesnt have to relate to Classic my favourite moment is when I won the Headless Horse mount on my lvl 65 tank.
---
Sorry, the z thing was tried but it got voted off the island.
---
There’s a shortage of tanks because there’s 9 classes to choose from, generally with only 2 of those being tanks. Each faction also gets an off-tank with shammy/pally. All of those classes can also be played as dps specifically, or even heals. 
---
Say there’s 10,000 60s on your server. How many of those do you think are actually warriors/druids that want to/are prepared to tank? Quick maff
---
Yeah I was really regretting rolling a prot warrior especially between levels 25-55. It's miserable being nearly unable to kill mobs your level without dying. 
---
I've since rolled a resto shaman in hopes of that being my main(severe tank/warrior overpopulation on mankrik) and I can still outshine some other classes when DPSing and healing at the same time.
---
and lose lmao
---
Yep :)
---
Yeah saw the chest on my first gorosh sighting
---
The current Classic client is based on 8.1: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.13.2/API_changes
---
Worst thing is that you'll probably keep your current gear until lvl ~35, so it'll become worse and worse over time.
---
Come bwl and zg you will be able to raid more than one day a week. I hope it'll balance things out.
---
Blizztard be like: Thats spellbatching for you
---
Eventhough none of it was like this in vanilla :D
---
same issue with hunters and FD
---
You don't need thunderfury to get AoE threat like warriors...back of to the row, please.
---
This just has to be from leveling my first Tauren, running around in Mulgore during night time, slaying beasts and fetching water pitchers under the full moon. I ended up not going to bed before finishing every last quest in there, even ended up climbing some mountains (or trying to) to take in the views. So serene, so awesome.
---
The game is so much more mysterious, hidden trash mechanism, hidden level requirements :D
---
Chain reserved.
---
Charge &gt; stance dance for Berserker Rage &gt; Bloodrage &gt; Demo Shout &gt; Thunderclap (depends) &gt; Sweeping Strikes &gt; Cleave x2-5 (switch to Berserker Stance for the Cleave and then back as long as you're not above 30 rage. Make it 25 if your rage CDS are gone.) &gt; Intimidating Shout and bandage if needed.
---
Also throw in wep swap macros &amp; stance dance for disarm etc. It's sweaty, but you really don't need Shield Wall or Retaliation unless you're fighting casters or mobs that disarm or CC you. This is my experience with WW axe and a few blues. I'd imagine Ravager would make this easier.
---
Sometimes you draw the short straw due to misses &amp; resists of course, but health pots usually weighs up for shitty RNG. Also, not trying to sound like a douche - just noticed quite a few warriors just standing in Battle Stance and spamming Hamstring. Hopefully this helps some of them.
---
//35 warrior who, obviously, hasn't unlocked Mortal Strike yet.
---
You know, I actually did play a Druid on a private server a while back... my bank and my bags were nothing but gear, consumables and buff reagents. Yuck.

https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19864/bloodcaller
---
Sick pic.
---
For all the min max pro player people on reddit it sucks balls because everyone gets bis weapons anyways the moment they step in any instance or raid.
---
For everyone else it is a good choice as a warrior even in pve. When gearing around it you can top the meters especially as a human. We gave it to a human warrior which means you reduce competition for other bis weapons especially when running a constant raid setup with 12+ melees. You can easily 2h fury dps until AQ/Naxx with it.
---
Bagnon for classic. You can find it on curse.
---
use rank 3 renew, heals for &gt;700 with decent gear for &lt;100 mana
---
He’s not wrong
---
same for me but i was 60 at week 2-3, got my 2nd crystal today..
---
Good luck everyone. This year looks to be a great Blizzcon!
---
My greatest memory was making my way to Darkshore for the first time after Cataclysm was launched. 
---
I had been playing WoW on and of for a couple of years prior to Cataclysm. But my reaction to the devastation of my beloved Darkshore and the town of Auberdine, I was blown away! I really loved that town. My first character was a night elf hunter &amp; my imagination was captured by the beauty and tranquility of this place. To see it all ripped to pieces but that horrid dragon was rather upsetting. 😥
---
Careful there, might be a trap...
---
Make it zoom in with a slight rotation with an explosion effect when you proc windfury.
---
Xn one of the warlocks is also super chill and extremely knowledgeable about the game. It’s a smaller stream and he talks with everyone whom asks decent questions.
---
Lock here, got the mask needed by a mage because he wanted the intellect. He knew shadow dmg is useless, just wanted the int.
---
Ah you good I'm lvl 25 atm and enjoying every bit of it. Did like 3 runs of WC over the weekend with some questing in between. Enjoyed meeting all the random ppl in them runs. Think we wiped like 3 times on the last run cuz of bad pulls but we all stuck with it and finished it lol. Cant wait for higher level dungeons!
---
Red elite quest? Yeah I can probably solo that
---
Have you seen most of the people who entered that tournament?
---
Me: Mum can we get WoW classic?
---
Mum: we have wow classic at home
---
WoW classic at home:
---
I dont think MS &gt; OS is a rule for pug dungeons.  After 43 runs into DM west, the mp4 trinket dropped.  I rolled need as a priest, do did the ret paradin and bear tank.  However, we all lost to the warlock....  
---
I was pretty pissed, but the group informed me that its standard.  If you might use it, roll.  Sucks but that's why everyone runs 'reserved item' runs and guild runs.
---
My favourite memory is from wow classic (first time playing wow). I was questing in Darkshore with a fellow night elf. After having done all the quests at our level we attempted the Wetlandsrun and managed to get there with only dying once at 2 am in the morning. So many areas which I have never seen before. From then on we sporadically did dungeons together and are now in the same guild clearing raids. 
---
I have another favourite memory. Being part of the server first Onyxia kill. Me and the nightelf from the first memory started a pug for onyxia at 2100 we got 26 people and attempted Onyxia. It took us till 0200 to kill her, at the end we had 32 people.
---
People at 60 with full pre-raid bis or even some raid pieces probably don't have much to do if they don't want to level alts, so why not spend time grinding rep then.
---
Hi, /u/CharlieTheHomeless

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/domjy5/what_about_this_game_makes_you_the_angriest/). 
---
Ice Block, probably Cold Snap and Ice Block again to survive the pet. Then hope you can start over without having lost too much health. So you Blink to him again and Nova him. Poly the pet, maybe bandage up if the Hunter forgot to Serpent Sting you, then nuke the Hunter while staying in his deadzone.
---
Or instead of Polying the pet from the start, you can Poly the Hunter instead. While he is CCed, he can't command his pet to use Intimidation and I'm pretty sure the same applies to Bestial Wrath, so then the pet should be an easy kill. Refresh Poly on Hunter, bandage back up if needed and kill the Hunter.
---
1v3 warrior every day in the crater :)
---
&gt; Only time you'd need to be in defensive stance is a quick Taunt/Revenge to bring something back on to you if needed
---
this is wrong, only time you should be in anything but defensive stance is when you are sweeping strike/charging/whirlwinding
---
Exactly!! Their ice block stun is so incredibly annoying since they get à hit through cheap shot
---
Generally, I'll wait if its your own water. If there's a mage in the group, I'll keep going because it's literally free. If you don't sit between each pull for a sip, you're slowing us down a lot.
---
+1
---
the \#nochanges hashtag is more of a joke at this point :D
---
Gnome is the best choice for pvp, also.
---
Or the old 1v1 with a regular old mob that is the same level that turns into a horrifying moment when you miss/get parried 4 times in a row with a slow weapon and you can’t take that last couple of % as you watch your health grind away.
---
Could always do that on my hunter, though 4 levels might get dicey depending on what kind of mob. If it’s a caster mob, ya it’s dead, but if it’s a melee mob it might be a close call. Because honestly, if my pet goes down I’m pretty much finished. Feign will more than likely be resisted, kiting will just get me into more trouble, etc etc
---
Just adding: SoS is arguably the best place to make some gold while reaching 300 at or around 40 as well. Sells for a lot on my realm, and needed for some pretty useful potions / elixirs.
---
As far as I remember it's undead mobs level 50+ that drop them in Classic.
---
Good luck! My favourite memory has to be playing at launch as a Dwarf Paladin. It was my first MMO and I remember how great it felt to finally buy my last piece of white gear to complete my set. Looking back, I had no idea what I was doing :D
---
My record in MC is 11.
---
what do you think about Guidelime Bustea's Leveling Guide? It's free addon, just follow the instructions on screen
---
You might be able to walk the walk but can you talk a walk?
---
They also forgot to make them tanky.
---
Eh, when Mages ding 60 they get the mental challenge of spamming frostbolt over and over again without going mentally insane. Oh, and conjure my drinkies! 
---
The leveling is fun, the raiding is an awful experience imo.
---
Don't Starve (Together) has the most mobs vs mobs behaviour. Common creatures hate monsters. You can provoke hounds to bite ent who will beat crap out of em, while other hounds would see that and try to help member of their pack, but all would be killed by ent anyway, unless there is like 30 of em and some burst into flames upon death. Spiders are really territorial and you can kite someone onto their Web covered grounds or bait one spider into other creature summoning reinforcement and even starting spiders civil wars. e.t.c.
---
WoW couldn't handle this level of exploits in 2004, so no mobs fighting, except for some predators hunting some critters.
---
True, but all of that is worth it when you hit end game and the mage peasants look up at you and beg for you to tank their dungeons. Then you look down at them as they drown in their excess and whisper, "Just spellcleave it, bro."
---
Wow that must have been both exciting and annoying at the same time! Funnily enough the servers still don't seem to cope now.
---
I did this for my classic ui. Remind me in 6h and I get you all info when I get home.
---
Mass of macgovan is nice alternative to Krol blade on the cheap. Tho it is a mace so no sword specialisation.

DM was pre-released, though.
---
Dal'Rends is 3rd bis, if you're hit capped. No +15 agi enchants yet, so Brut blade (60 ap 1%crit) and Strat Polearm (1% crit 56ap) are both better than Dal'Rends (1%crit 50ap)
---
It’s really sad.  
---
Too many streamers using autohotkey to bot afk while sleeping when servers had 5 hr ques and acting like they were setting up fans n shit to cover their cheating asses. 
---
Now, you almost literally have to use an advanced afk script and risk ban just to camp a spawn , which is totally a huge part of the classic play method.
---
The wipe is inevitable, warlocks begin tapping like mad and start Hellfire, only for healers to throw them some final clutch heals...
---
Yeah I was just maing an Unbreakable referense.
---
It would have been interesting to add race/class, to see if there are some trends.
---
That interface hurts my brain.
---
We have a guild on our server with very strict rules against racist or offensive jokes. Each week they lose members because most people think their rules are ridiculous. We had a raid with them and someone made an offensive joke in discord. The joke wasn't the funny thing, but the reaction was extremely funny
---
I get it that some people thread humor differently, I hope you aren't the person just overcompensating, because that's what a lot of people do in 2019...
---
I honestly didn’t realize how rare this was because I saw it 5 times within 30 arena runs.  I’m a mage though so I wasn’t exactly looking for it haha (also never played vanilla)
---
And take a video of the screen with a Nokia 3310
---
Lucky to see an arcane once a week kinda thing haha
---
This is amazing!!! Appreciated!
---
Looking good!
---
how hard is it to gear a mage? I'm considering rerolling :/
---
SUN OF DA BEACH!
---
Doing the TBC attunement chains with my guild. It was such an epic adventure and challenge to partake in with my irl friends. I also Made some friends from across the world I still speak to on a semi-regular basis.
---
Yeah, that was the justification the mage's friend in the group tried to use after the mage got called out on it.
---
Killing Saurfang Damn thats impressive.
---
Most tanks that want to get paid usually just reserve something reasonable from the run.  That seems to go over well with most folks.
---
"broken" as in you could vanish to deny melee hits/spells coming at you?
---
sure.
---
I played rogue in TBC and it worked pretty damn good

Boo hoo

if Blizztard removes spell batching it will fix ~80% of the bugs people are having.
---
Id never buy tanking services. Everytime i LFM some tank answers, for free. Only 1 time it took more than 5 mins when it was like 8am and i was looking for uldaman group.
---
Glitching first time under Stormwind
---
But you can't spam revenge on CD....
---
That is fine. Questioning my memory doesn't bother me. Questioning my integrity, like the armchair coders here, does. Thank you.
---
This might also make some flight paths actually usable without constant dying lol.
---
Name checks out u/EvilSandwichMan, However i do not think this would ever be a good idea for you.  
---
there is still reputation in classicwow and on servers, you do not want to become the guy that is greedy as hell, and doesnt want to tank unless he gets paid - it will become like this, and then you cant come to raids, because people dont want to pay you etc etc..  
---
i would say its a bad idea..   
---
Besides that, if anybody should pay you, you should not have rights to any of the drops, and or money.
---
Wait for 60
---
This!!! I love hitting up this hub as alliance right when the quests are green. I take the boat from booty bay to ratchet grab FP, then run and grab Lower Wilds FP then to the hub. Pick up all the quests then run and grab gadgetzan FP. Go back and do a nice circle to complete hub. Great setup for later and solid XP!
---
Soled as protadin at 42lvl.
---
0.66% according to my calculations.
---
Two dragons together have about 20% chance of of dropping one orb, and once it drops, wowhead claims there's 3.2% chance for it the have the shadow damage modifier.
---
You seemed like an easy lunch, because he knew ghoul would eat only your brain.
---
My favourite moment was getting T2 robe and healer ring on my guilds first Nefarian kill.
---
The picture is not about sniping Thrall unnoticed, though. They are occupying the most busy place in town...
---
Does anyone know where the boots of elements drop off? Its one of the lbrs bosses. Some sites say urok  doomhowl, others say omokk. Its clear to me that they changed location back in the day, but what I don't know is if we are before or after that in classic
---
Clear trashes over and over again you mean 😂
---
Ahhh...forgive me it's been...12 years since I've done this lol
---
Yeah Level up by selling tank Service.
---
The only reason I would ever buy a tank Server is because the tank is overgeared for that dungeon anyawy. Why would he come? Because I pay.
---
No other reason for me.
---
If you sell your tank Service and still roll and gear and Need the gear. That is just wrong xD If that was the  case I would start charging as a DPS too.
---
Dude buy a $100 laptop, classic will run on a damn battery plugged into a potato
---
Hey it's me, the guy with a prot war engi/alch main who rolled a mage miner/herbalist. My god a mage is so fun to play, and liberating. Having a blast just leveling right now, and the feeling of power and utility while questing is amazing.
---
Playing a Night Elf Druid for the first time, after having mained NE in WC3 for a while with Druids of the Claw my favourite unit. The feeling of oneness in Teldrassil. Wisps roaming around, earning the right to transform into a bear, seeing the Ancients of War at the Darnassus entrance. There is no better starting zone, no better themed race, no better WoW memory than those first levels as Night Elf Druid for me.
---
I was actually thinking of building my character SPECIFICALLY for service, so that would mean that by the time I'm selling my services, I'd already have the equipment I need and I'm just getting paid.
---
The idea was that I'm doing this SPECIFICALLY for gold (or silver) profit from running the instance and the gear all goes to the players to do with as they wish (so we could get a warrior DPS for instance, and any drops they can use they can still get no problem). I would also spec my warrior into protection as well. Gear is not important for her as my main is still a rogue and this is just some services being sold on the side.
---
I swear all I see in this reddit is Alliance good horde bad. Most horde beating Alliance posts are instantly down voted.
---
Agree about world PvP but tier 0.5 is meant to be catch up gear
---
If you're hit capped is a big "if" for non troll hunters
---
I maintained cooking while leveling my war and it helped immensely. From 30-60 I had the spirit/stam buff consistently and always had plenty of food for reduced downtimes.  I loved having it and would recommend it to all warriors.
---
Those that sell are usually raid geared, usually cover is anything that’s not needed by others as an upgrade (bags not included) is the tanks. (All boes and bops)
---
It's just odd because the minimaps show no terrain changes at all from patch 1.0 to 3.0, they are 100% identical https://wow.tools/maps/Azeroth/
---
Random. 2 dropped in Scholo and 1 in LBRS, so it's not entirely from UD
---
I've also had times when I gouge a mob with less than 0.5s remaining on a stun, they'll still somehow get off a melee hit even though they're going straight from a stunned state to an incapacitated one. 
---
I think it's because of pseudo-spellbatching. Like the spellbatching we have now is just an artificially implemented one that tries to mimic the way things were in Vanilla, and not an identical copy of the version that exited then.
---
I use a 20 slot Soul Pouch and that's all I need. Never struggled with running out as long as I use drain soul on the trash we are clearing.
---
or make them whine on reddit /shrug
---
You can charge for tanking, sure, but by charging you are hopefully passing on all drops
---
&gt; you should not have rights to any of the drops, and or money.
---
And I wouldn't, I should've specified that in my post (I think I'll edit it now). I would run those instances as tank for free first, until I get the gear I need, and *then* run as a service. But definitely agreed on not getting rights to drops. Reputation is important, and even if an epic BoE drops, I wouldn't roll on it at all, the idea is that I'm selling a professional service and I would be specced protection as well.
---
Thanks alot. You were one of the only that actually answered my question.
---
I like using ElvUi but I cant seem to make it work with Classic Threat Plates. Is there a work around for this ?
---
I believe wowhead is a pretty good source for this. According to wowhead it drops 16% from Urok.
---
I remember the opening of the dark portal, I was level 58 on a mage at the time and the whole thing was full of horde and alliance just getting along. Some dueling, some dancing and even full guilds that hated each other just sitting and waiting to go! Was such an exciting moment, would have been around 16 at the time.

Org got destroyed on pyrewood village EU last week. Then there's about 200 of us in Org but on another layer 👍

Apparently not, since people are asking how to farm gold as a rogue.

I'm not paying to heal someone through an instance, ever.

Classic Wow release. WoW game was introduced me when WotLK was announced. I was never able to play vanilla. It was pain - queues, no mobs in starting zones, no gold, no friends but it is already history fifty levels later. Every boss kill is a little achievement for me.
---
Can you post this please?
---
Interesting given that a Wow developer used the same/similar name. There are even items in game named after him
---
The first time I managed to get my hands on the Whirlwind Axe as a Warrior was a memorable and glorious moment in WoW for me.
---
(vanilla) my lowbie friends wanted to see an infernal so I showed them. Then they wanted me to relog and show them my alt.... :P

This makes me even more psyched to level my protection paladin. Dungeons while leveling is already a breeze (just bind skull-marking to your scroll wheel and tell the DPS to not be a bunch of babies), so with this you can even raid.

you get energy refund if your attack is parried/dodged/miss/immune

Getting Herald of the Titans achievment back in late cata

As my warrior is still low level, running a Strat group is still a far off thing. Once my character hits 60 I can run them in that manner (I've seen people reserve first orbs for the tank before), but there are lots of levels between 20 and 60, and lots of dungeons with a high demand for tanks.
---
So, I'm leveling a Shaman (level 54 right now), and I switched to Resto spec from Elemental a while ago, and before I was Elemental I was Enhancement, and honestly, I don't have as much fun on my character anymore. I switched to Resto because my guild and some of my friends said that Enhancement isn't good for raiding and I would have a hard time getting into groups.   
---
Now I don't know what to do because I love playing Enhancement and being melee, but I want to be able to get into raids and stuff to potentially get more gear from there as well. I was even considering making another character because of how much I don't enjoy Resto as I thought I would. Any advice?
---
Fishing for tanks, that's a new one.

4 months per phase, AQ is phase 5. That's 16 months. He was even lowballing it.

Blizzard has said 6 phases is 18+ months.

What? This is how it should be tbh, working as intended #nochanges
---
The unkillable mobs in Blasted Lands. Some are called Servant of Alistarj, but there are others too, afaik.
---
Im a rogue and a little tip for other rogues: go pickpocket all the mobs at start of the fight, then when you're done the tank will most probably have enough threath to hold your dps.
---
Worked in a store back in 2005. This kid came in the days before christmas and got his grand father a copy of World of Warcraft with 30 days game time so that they could play together. About a week later the kid, his grand father and a gang of the grand fathers friends from the retirement home came in to get copies for themselves as well. It was a hit, apparently.
---
Sometimes it's just the disorganization of the guild, not because you're assuming I'm some noob, but whatever.
---
Don't charge your peers, take a crusader orb or something.
---
You can charge when you're an overgeared tank that can speedrun everyone through.
---
Not Soulbound? I am disappoint
---
the problem i had with pally, is you cant kill anyone, no slow people just blink away or sprint away
---
I feel like im missing a story here...
---
If you don't wanna grind Dal'rends then I'd definitely buy Krols if you can afford it. I'd also throw a crusader on there because you might as well, won't be replacing until you get a lucky raid drop
---
Demonshear sounds better than Barb if you're arms, purely because of the better speed.
---
Right? I'm glad that 4 minutes of the video is dedicated to the tank and spank boss encounter and all but how but a little information on the irritating as shit trash on the winding ass path to get to said boss?
---
Yes, so much this. Luckily this mostly disappears at 60, or then it's just that you're running dungeons over and over with decent people you befriended on the journey to 60 and / or guildies. 
---
But very relatable.

---
&gt;Cast  2 or 3 times and you can exceed 2000 threat.
---
Casting will also proc global, so you cant spam it. Casting it 3 times takes \~3.5s. Even if it increases your threat by 2000, are you in range of (2000) the tank you are supposed to TAUNT from. On bosses where you need taunts, most likely not.
---
This on the other hand can open up more of retri tree, when you dont really NEED conc for multitarget tanking, you can just spam bok instead.
---
Heal gear, Mp5 gear, Spellpower gear, Reflect gear, Tank gear. Sometimes I regret my decisions to lug all of this around, but then I see another shiny and start thinking up ways to incorporate it.
---
Can someone give me a rundown of what being the 4th tank in a guild entails with only a single raid team?
---
Are you in general the standby in case the 3 core tanks dont turn up and then you get to raid.  If they all turn up you might then have to scramble to find a pug as likely a dps warrior depending on how much time there is between your guilds raid day and the reset day and what pugs are running.  This also means that you will then be progressing two different specs effectively progressing at half the speed.  Is this all correct (including any assumptions I've made)?
---
I've never seen a premade that wanted rets. They don't really do anything in organized PvP that a combination of warriors and holy paladins don't do much better.
---
Gadgetzan, it’s cool!
---
Lol you right I just have other priorities wow consumed my life bc I used to be a PvP and raid leader I loved it but I gotta get my shit in order first
---
Mages can't really pull as much as the reddit circlejerk believes. They can pull a lot if its weak adds that are green (as seen by those who level by farming mass pulls). If it's proper quest mobs they can do 2 mobs and they are oom always. So yeah, grass is always greener on the other side, I started leveling my warrior and it's a lot more fun than mage imo.
---
Well fair enough in that case I'm totally happy to pay.
---
Though I usually run with my guildies :D
---
GL and HF on your way though!

Grand Theft Dino

When I first started playing I saw a lot of people flying through Elwynn Forest and I asked if there was a flight from SW to Goldshire (Didn't even have SW FP at this point). I was told to go back to retail and I never played any other WoW game :(
---
Off the top of my head I know that pets are borked. Eyes of the beast doesn’t work and telling your pet where to go and to stop etc is not intuitive
---
Just love to see it! Ive stolen atleast 20 devilsaur leathers by now and it never gets boring!
---
Wands actually get boosted by agility. 
---
Thing is, the scaling is so bad you won't notice a difference
---
I’m a level 60 mage that can clear deadmines in 15 minutes and stockade in 10 minutes and I have yet to find anyone who even wants to pay enough to make up for me not just looting myself.
---
I think if asking for gold while leveling a tank was viable/worth it, it would already be a thing. It sounds like you just want to get paid to level by tanking.
---
Just rush 60 and tank all the strat lives for first orb, you’ll get more money, faster.
---
Uh, what realm is this? Sounds horrible. 
---
Form groups with people you've befriended while leveling and / or find an active guild, helps a lot. Even if you get 1-2 pugs, the majority will be sane and normal players.
---
Only in PvE. And hit is fairly easy to come by, regardless.
---
39-43 or thereabouts has been the slowest for me.  I think it's because that is the point when you're struggling for a mount.
---
I solved both problems by largely staying in the Scarlet Monastery for more than two weeks.  I'm level 46 now and I have my mount, and probably around 10 gold at the moment.
---
I've made low level alts in most classes, but the only two I can really stand for any length of time in this game, are either a Prot Warrior or a Survival Hunter.  I will grind with Prot even though it is slow, simply because I enjoy the rotation that much; and the same with Survival.  It's also because, I primarily value classes or specs with defensive survivability, in the sense that when I am out soloing, I want to be able to cope with having pulled adds that I haven't planned for.  In Defensive Stance with Prot, using Shield Wall at the very end, I was once able to tank five raptors in STV solo, one after the other.
---
I will never raid with that attitude of course; but that is what I enjoy.
---
When there's adds, you normally allow corruptions on the adds so each lock has at least 1 corruption up.
---
Argent Dawn reputation: should I stack on Scourgestones or turn them in and stack Tokens? Considering this for XP.
---
Bold of you to assume people can read
---
My favorite WoW memory is ... I had this friend in Vanilla that had never raided because their schedule just didn't allow them to, but we found a guild that had one raid day a week that they could attend. Their first raid, and first Onyxia kill, was just absolutely magical because my friend got their T2 helm, the head, and a cloak and they were just so ecstatic. It was very cute. Nobody else needed any of the loot.
---
Proooobably? If it works anything like the DM trib chest, then yeah.
---
The dual blade is only bis because you can do x2 15 agi enchant on them...which does not exist till phase 5.
---
Strat polearm is much better otherwise.
---
people really need to read stats instead of using those bis sets as gospels(even though I do concede they are correct 90% of the time)
---
I have it on no combat because I have bloodrage already bound on another key and this prevents me from accidentally casting it when I don't want to during a boss fight. It's better to be able to use it exactly when I want to than every time it's up.
---
Wait until AQ40 and Naxx, see how long that takes.
---
For real. I know the point about Classic is sticking to its old roots, but Mages seem really strony in my opinion. I’m a 46 undead Rogue. 
---
They can make their own food, water, ports, buff their teammates, level the fastest, can take on so many mobs at a time, etc. All I can do is, pickpocket? On top of this, when I am LFGing for dungeons like ZF or Cath, it seems people only want Mages these days. I’ve been kicked from countless groups simply for being a Rogue. 
---
I love being a Rogue, but it feels like Mages have such an upperhand in terms of utility and DPS, and it puts me down a bit as a new player— especially because Rogue initially stood out a lot to me, and became something I fell in love with instantly. 
---
Last note, someone did tell me future raids will make other classes (such as Rogues) more powerful through the better gear they will acquire, so I’m hoping that is the case.
---
Getting all the gear in raids, cuz only 2 druids in our raid and the feral guy dont need setpieces
---
Feign being the biggest issue but even if your feign drops combat after like 2 seconds it can still take another 2 to get a trap down if it even works at all.
---
Pet management is scuffed, sometimes your pet will pull mobs from 40 yards away, sometimes your pet can stand inside the 
---
mob for 5 seconds without aggroing him.
---
You run away from mobs they will basically take up to 3x the time to evade since they first leash onto you, then the pet and then you again.
---
Scatter shot gets broken by your own pet frequently and even on use effects on ranged weapons will break it. 
---
Players that run over a trap with a 100% mount won't get trigger the trap like 8/10 times and even if you just walk over it normally there's a chance it doesn't get triggered at all.
---
If you're specced into improved concussive shot and it procs there is around 1 second delay between the slow and the actual stun being applied. 
---
There is probably more but off the top of my head that's all I can think of right now
---
Are you mad? 
---
A ret can heal as efficiently as holy if specced right and burst dmg is as hard as a war
---
Got mine yesterday also. Before that I dropped book for wars/paladins and sold it for 750g so I bought my epic mount also. Week before I did Benediction. That was a sweet week for me. Gratz on your T2 and eye :)
---
Damn how epic would it be to make a raid and go to a major city and then at the same time change layer on the entire raid. Suddenly hundreds of enemy players appear out of nowhere in the middle of your capital and starts slaughtering everyone.  
---
I'll call it "The trojan layer"
---
what is green mage gear? just random green cloth?
---
or has it a name like the bear gear?
---
thanks :)
---
Jesus
---
Who cares  leveling is the biggest content in Vanilla
---
Only and mc are braindead boring anyway
---
Kinda hard to show their raid getting completely wiped, reactions, logging out etc without using their footage, dont you think ? And theres been comments like "i've never seen apes lost arena trinket", maybe its time someone showed clips that arent made by apes members ? :)
---
I was so excited when they added in Sealed Tome of the Lost Legion for locks in MoP. It was such an epic class quest to do. I farmed it myself too and was so excited to get my green flames, but man was I not ready, lol. I'm not the best player so doing the encounter with Ebonlocke was one of blood, sweat, and many tears! After about a week of trying I finally did it and it was probably my proudest moment in WoW (as I said, not the best player). I even got the title "of the Black Harvest" which I felt pretty badass using during Legion on my lock.   
---
If you're looking for classic memories, well I didn't play during classic but started in BC and my favorite memory from that time is when I got my frostwolf howler after farming AV rep. I remember before even playing the game I saw that mount when looking up info on WoW and said, "I want that if I ever play".
---
Woosh
---
Nope, rolled dwarf priest on SkullFlame-EU. Am the shadow priest for my guilds raids, can heal all dungs fine, can solo farm nicely and world pvp can be fun. 
---
But, I do want to make a melee class alt. Not sure which though.
---
and I havnt heart the word aggro used for a long time. Threat has been used for the better part of 10+ years.
---
I believe Hate was used in Everquest and other pre-wow MMOs.
---
i miss the early vanilla versions of the max lvl dungeons.
---
Sometime in the later patchs all the dungs got nerfed so hard. Probobly around the same time ubrs became a 10man dung instead of 15man.
---
Ya, sorry, I'm new to wow and didnt understand server differences...
---
11 not 3. And pointless because of Maraudon or DM:East.
---
Feels bad, I got full deadbone in 3 runs
---
Stand in his face
---
Sheep the pet
---
I have levelled 10+ Warriors during vanilla, private servers and now classic.
---
Every time I have a great time. People who say they are a pain to level are just bad...I'm not joking.
---
You can solo 1-60 with little to no trouble at all. Retaliation will make short work of the odd elite quest.
---
Keep first aid up to scratch as well as cooking for food buffs.
---
*Captain, they're adapting!*
---
Yes. Arcane Crystal farming is a huge secret.
---
Get a real weapon.
---
Is there any data available on average / estimated run time for different dungeons / dungeon runs? Ideally 5mans around level 60 (BRD (1st half/2nd half/full), Scholo, Strat UD, etc.)
---
I imagine it's pretty subjective depending on group composition / skill, what's included in each run and group's appetite to skip or move quickly.
---
Any kind of indication or comparison available?
---
Alchemy costs surprisingly little to level, and can make serious gold if you are smart, and still a reasonable amount if you aren't. Soon as you hit level 35, unlock 300 Alchemy and grind to 275. Pay 5g for the transmute arcanite bar recipe and make 5-10g every 2 days thereafter.
---
This is the correct way of doing things. 75% is most often the sweetspot when doing 5mans. It gives you 3-5 seconds to build threat while the mana users finish their last part of drinking.
---
You could still get critluck or/and overpower "luck".
---
Had some mobs fall in 8 seconds due to first 1 avoid + 2 white crits + overpower crit + Mortal strike Crit and execute.  
---
Always extremely surprised though.
---
I had 45 gold to my name at 40, but being a Paladin, it didn't matter. 
---
You see we take care of our own. 
---
Simply by being the being the most awesome class in the game, I got my Palamount for free from that nice guy in Stormwind after flashing him my Palabadge! Yay me!
---
If you would raid with 40 people without anyone using an addon or watching a single guide, it would last much longer
---
BiS lists, addons and guides makes everything much easier
---
Assassination blade is only a small bit worse, and costs many hundreds less.  You cld get 2 with ench for less than the cost of one Krols.  I'd go that route tbh but up to you
---
and play UD male rogue with punk hair in classic
---
You can't really wear gear for both, though. If you wear Judgment to hybridize a little, then your crit rating suffers and you become less reliable.
---
Also if you're sinking 21 points into holy to get the reliable big crit heal every now and then, then you're gonna miss Repentance, BoK, Guardian's Favor and imp. HoJ, which are all pretty essential to PvP ret.
---
And yeah, a white hit, Seal of Command crit into a stun for a Judgment of Command crit absolutely slaps, it's really good burst damage. Problem is how unreliable it is. 
---
Warriors are much more reliable. They press a button and do their Mortal Strike and it's on the same (if not stronger) level as a SoC proc. They have higher crit ratio (typically around 30% for PvP if axe specced in p1 gear), and much stronger mobility if dispelled. And just for icing on the cake, Mortal Strike carries the single strongest debuff in the game in terms of organized PvP, too.
---
Rets are ridiculously good in small-scale, unorganized PvP though.
---
No, never charge for tanking, it will come back to bite you later. 
---
You may feel like some diva because of how needed you are in 5-man dungeons, but when it comes to raids, there's more tanks than raid spots.
---
Today you killed some npc vendors. All the other days you get ganked and cry.
---
It really works! Also I've named my new pet skeleton, Bob.

It’s relative easy to gear, fun to pay, and super versatile... I wouldn’t change it for any other class.
---
I wouldnt say hunters have sustain, more like very strong damage mitigation
---
well, a good mage will realize that if there’s not a ton of mobs to aoe and the other classes don’t have aoe abilities, it may make more sense to roll single target. unfortunately we have many mages who one AoE run, think they’re pro gamers, and then cast flamestrike and spam arcane explosion on a 2-mob pull. i typically prefer the old-school dungeon run more but i’ve been in a few AoE groups that are tight and it’s satisfying clearing like 20+ mobs in a few seconds. some people just don’t understand the time and place i guess
---
I'm gonna chuck it on an old HDD tonight and see if anything changes
---
So...wait: Is this something that was never discovered in Vanilla?
---
But you're very special as a Rogue, aren't you?
---
Lots of comments complain about tank rushing to next pack and not letting healer get mana. I don't mind that. Healing a perfect party who do no risks is boring and make me sleepy. I'd rather try speedrun every dungeon and use my consumables to overcome the odds. The game is much funnier when you treat it as one and you don't mind the cost. Engineering is best profession out there and it makes my day everyday inside dungeons
---
Third party it may be, but it is the most reliable you will find save a direct Blue post and by far the most info-stuffed source you can find.
---
If you Ctrl+F "keyring" it also says (paraphrase) "keyring was said to be added with the first major patch after release, supposedly meaning in P2".
---
No one is going to pay you to tank low level dungeons, if they had to pay someone they'd just get a lvl 60 to boost them instead, plenty of that happening already. I see some desperate people yelling that they would pay for a tank but honestly it doesn't seem very lucrative. At best you're going to reserve strat liv orbs but that's not going to go on forever.
---
Like another person, how are you grinding this? If be keen to do it too
---
What if it's a druid?
---
Yup. I had Herb while leveling. My alch was essentially free. Had to chime in 15-20g tops.
---
Boe = Need (Unless the group talked about it before it drops)
---
True, considering you said it's league below, It's probably worth the time going for them then. 
---
So if the Barbarous Blade is the best of those, then what's your opinion on that blade vs Dreadforge Retaliator or Demonshear? If you were me, which would you spend your time trying to get
---
wait are you leroy? you messaged me out of the blue lastnight to brag about getting this and then logged off
---
Its possible the brutes also have this "thrash" ability, and the last person who aggro'd em allowed them to gather a few charges.
---
Im unaware for how long these charges are kept, and if they are even wiped between combat or not.
---
Actually, its in AQ and Naxx that other classes start to out-dps warriors. Mostly mages due to fire spec and rolling ignite. That being said, Warriors will often top meters on some bosses in AQ/Naxx aswell. Warrior is a strong dps class in all content of vanilla really.
---
I’ve started playing WoW in TBC, back then we didn’t have our local servers so I was playing one some heavily Russian-populated EU realm (maybe warsong, can’t remember for sure).
---
I’ve started pretty late into expansion and had a blast leveling my hunter.
---
My favorite memory is probably getting my first ever purple - it was a Phoenix-looking bow.
---
It was so pretty and such a significant boost for me, I couldn’t be happier at the moment :)
---
Kings is the cheapest greater blessing.
---
Ahh, okay!
---
So how would this work actually? Do you have to buff on every pull or does it work just passively as long as the buff is applied?
---
They hotfixed threat on shouts. At the start of the month. From what i can tell, battle shout does nothing. Wont even pull off a facepull with 0 other threat on the table. Demo shout isnt much better.
---
Kings has a particularly low mana cost compared to the others, I think that is why it has all the focus.
---
What
---
u can Charge people money of u go online and get 10 whisper to Tank some dungeons..
---
then...  yes
---
Man, alliance are weird....
---
Favorite WoW memory is when my guild finally took down Nefarian in BWL.  After all the attempts and failures it felt like such an accomplishment.
---
But GBoK is not a holy ability.
---
Second this \^
---
Just spell batching and it's working as intended.
---
Depends on your loot council.
---
I think it's unfair. Because everyone raids and shadowpriests only have the "warlock" gear to use because their Tier set is healing.
---
Either way if your LC decides so then OK.
---
If you use DKP this Problem solves itself. He can of course use his DKP as he wants.
---
If it is FFA then it solves itself. Everyone can roll on what they need
---
Stack them until u hit revered, then turn them in and use tokens.
---
Just random green items with your preferred stats on it.
---
For dungeons and raids this normally is:
---
&gt; Spell hit% to 10% &gt; spell crit &gt; spellpower &gt; int
---
Playing low level pvp instead of leveling. It wasn't very clever and I fell behind my leveling friends, but I had good fun amd at least ranked up to Grunt
---
Greater blessings apply the buff on all people of the same class. I.e. you target a warrior and cast greater blessing of Kings, then all warriors in the raid get greater blessing of X. For the single target version it doesn't work this way of course.
---
same I have my 19 rogue mostly easy to go
---
Correct. Not sure if Kings applies more threat or if it's purely the lower mana cost that's the reason it's mentioned specifically.
---
It's a lot more fun?  Why do you feel that way?  I'd miss the portals to speed up the leveling, the utilities to get out of bad situations, and the speed of questing/leveling in general.  
---
But you are right, the grass IS always greener.  Just curious as I have a lvl 60 warrior and generally hated most of the path to 60 lmao.
---
they have double the bite force of a lion
---
Im not necessarily saying retail is dying in any dramatic way, no doubt it will carry on for a long time to come. But surely the fact that blizz has released something like 800 employees over the last year should tell you something about the health of the game.
---
And with classic undoubtedly now pulling both new players (or old players who left a while ago) back into the game, as well as cannibalizing players from retail, i have to imagine blizz is looking at classic and trying to figure out how to use its momentum to either revivify retail (because - "dying" or not, its not where it used to be), or develop a way to monetize classic in a more robust way ($15 subs that allow you to play both versions of the game i can almost guarantee will not be how it works a year from now)
---
I myself played bfa from release until about february of this year, and left until classic launched - i just wasnt having fun with the game. I WANT retail to be good, and i will undoubtedly play the new expansion when it releases. But, if i dont enjoy it i will also undoubtedly return to classic, and by that point i hope blizz has made a decision about the future of classic.

---
What is stupid about organic and unscripted player interaction? Some would argue that it's the most satisfying form of pvp. Instanced battlegrounds make pvp almost like a chore where the main objective is farming honor.
---
World pvp makes it feel like the main objective is killing the other faction for natural reasons that align with both the story and defending one's faction's contested zones to help people level safely.
---
It's honestly two completely different ways to approach the pvp mechanic in general and I personally feel both are valid. Codifying the pvp system allows it to be grinded which allows it to have a progression system for hardcore players. But humans will always take the most efficient path and it's no secret that battlegrounds deincentivize world pvp in general for this exact reason.
---
Personally I feel the goal should always be for the two systems to live in harmony. People have suggested only having bgs available certain times of the day for instance. Probably not the perfect solution but I'm not a game desiger. In the end it's probably something that should be addressed but won't.
---
 Spectacle or sceptical?
---
You told them you were on vacation but the wording you chose implies that you lied, is this what happened? 
---
Start a new account I guess.
---
Well TIL :p thanks
---
the best is having 2 mages and not seeing a single sheep and no proper aoe being done
---
Looks like a moving painting
---
had two eye of shadows drop in 5min when farming those elites in darkwhisper gorge. 
---
luckily i had my heartstone placed in everlook so i hearted, and quickly mailed the first one away. Then rode down and thankfully enough the corpse was still there so i could loot the 2nd one :P
---
Then i got greedy and decided to keep farming more. 6 hours later (around 150kills) i went to bed having not seen any more drops.
---
No, just put ground clutter to 0.
---
Warlocks and especially mages are mostly egoistic dicks, from my experience. Don't worry about them
---
Not everyone is going to be super try-hard about their rank. If I play BGs, it's because I want to play BGs. If I world PvP, it's because I want to world PvP. I do know that world PvP will happen less because of BGs, but I don't think it's going to be as bad as you say. 
---
Or maybe when someone says "flying killed world PvP," I should correct them and say "World PvP died in early vanilla with BGs"?
---
LPT- Turn ground clutter all the way down when in Un'goro and you find everything.
---
I mean druids got that underwater farming down, but who's really afraid of getting ganked by one underwater? Last I checked aquatic form would be hot garbage in pvp due to being so limited.
---
That's what we've been doing...
---
The t0.5 would be nice to have, but as others have said, it’s meant to be a catch up to get people geared enough to enter zg, then move into aq20

I call it cat hearding.
---
How can they justify a ban because your account was played on two ips. It doesn’t make sense and isn’t enough proof to justify a ban for account sharing
---
I did that in Retail, eventually getting every class somewhere around lvl 100. While it is very nice for doing the AH shuffle, I don't plan to do it all again. Though I will admit, that druid looks tempting, now that my lock is 60.
---
not completely true, there will be some people levelling alts now and plenty of those alts will be fury warriors from good players
---
Jesus christ just report them and fucking move on. Report the people whispering you, block guild invites or join a new one. This shit is solved in 10min, but you spent your time writing to everyone else about it here instead
---
The lag was insane, i was stood at the flightpath as a ghost for ages cause i didn't dare res!
---
Once i'm geared I will form a raid on all of your cities sir, believe me.
---
It was known, the problem is a complete aggro drop you're not going to be able to catch up still :(
---
Classic launch!
---
Started playing in WoTLK, was amazed when I first time get to Outland and then later on Northend.
---
By the time they catch up you’ll have 3 sets :P
---
Is there an add-on that announces spell interrupts? I've googled it and have only found add-ons like that for retail
---
Are you talking about a guild raid environment or in dungeons?
---
Cuz in dungeons, no one should pass on anything that they will use.
---
You don't get banned just for sharing your account. Unless the person you're sharing with has a suspiciously Asian accent...
---
I didn't mean it was completely unknown, simply that many people are just now learning of it
---
1 in 10 ratio is being really generous to be honest. For the vast majority of the game it's 1/20 with people playing off role to fill the other tank slots when needed or half the tanks in a raid playing off spec most of the time.
---
Don't share your account and you won't get banned.
---
Hey, bleeding edge retail raiding was fantastic last I tried - miles ahead of classic, it's just the rest of the game is missing.
---
9 pumkins
---
because they wanted a mechanostrider first, but then realized, after turning in all of that cloth .. they can't ride them, humans are too heavy after all said the smirking gnome ..
---
so with a hanging head and small tears forming in their eyes, they flew to Darnassus instead, because at least humans can ride the fierce battle kittens the elves keep around
---
2v2 Rogue/mage arena in season 1 of TBC with my cousin. Getting 1800 rating was huge for us :)
---
Horde tends to attract the shitty players who need every small advantage they can get (WoTF and orc stun resist). They will go tryhard mode in world pvp where they can outnumber or outlevel players but in BG's horde tends to get dominated hard because it's even grounds. I played vanilla, TBC and WOTLK and it was p much always like this, feels like it'll be even more extreme now
---
Easy answer
---
Wold PvP takes no skill whatsoever  just for the fact that there is barely any los which nullifies a vital part of PvP 
---
And I am not talking about open world 2v2 or 2v1 I am talking about the 10+ vs another group 
---
It's probably because I have always been an arena player since they added it but world PvP is the biggest "fuck do I care"  in this game  and hell I don't play pve whatsoever
---
This looks like vanilla to me.
---
These uncommon adventures are the most fun.
---
There is no "need" to level better. As there is no "better" leveling, just quicker maybe. Well, casters do level quick enough anyway
---
Stop being such a pussy. You're the tank so that means you're in charge. Make your own groups and don't take people that don't know how to follow orders. You do the pulls and tell the rogue/hunter to attack the skulls. Just tell them you'll kick them, if you're the party leader they can't do shit.
---
Rule with an iron fist dude, pugs are the sometimes the worst but usually it's the leadership that can make it work.
---
&gt;I believe it’s like a 5-7 yd range?
---
hey, he specifically asked not to quote him on that
---
No, people coming later into the raids get their gear much faster, because others already got their gear
---
We're three hunters and each piece of tier 1 gets rolled by one or two hunters. In 3-4 weeks, if we get a new hunter, he'll gear up ridiculously fast most likely. The leaf questline needs some farming, getting that early will delay your other progress a lot. Just get 60, farm some pre Raid BiS and your mount. If you'll get the leaf in 2 month, everything is fine :) I don't think p3 will come that soon
---
Lmao
---
I dunno why everyone's being dicks in here. 
---
This is one of the more common false-positive bans, and people usually get them resolved.
---
&gt; First off vanilla, was no more difficult than classic, that has been debunked many a times already so let’s not go there.
---
I don't think you understood where I was going. What Vanilla was released, the raids were much harder, the itemization was *terrible*, talents trees were arguably worse. The context in my reply being your post and you commenting upon the "8 weeks in". Therefore I'm using the data from 8 weeks into Vanillas release. 
---
&gt; The guys who roflstomped MC in the first week, were doing so on private servers too, which if you’re arguing there was a difference between classic and vanilla... would further debunk that argument.
---
No it would not, because the version of MC they were running, the items they were using, the talent trees etc. weren't the same as when Vanilla was released. 
---
That doesn't even touch upon another thing I mentioned, the learning curve. People today know how to level up efficiently, they know exactly what to do in every aspect of PvE, Addons are available for ease-of-use etc. Without even considering such factors but simply stating "Legendaries at 8 weeks in. What a joke." is flat out silly and pointless. Of course it's going to be different, the whole "authentic experience" is whatever you make it out to be. Of course if you are going to play the game like you would play retail, you aren't going to have an "authentic experience", but I would've thought that would be expected by everyone. 
---
I honestly don't know why you wrote the second half of your reply to me, as it seems pretty irrelevant to what I wrote.
---
Prot pally dps in raids.. isn't really much behind a ret to be perfectly honest. standard Ret is dogshit rng, at lest prot is probably willing to do a spellpower build.
---
when they added knockback mechanics it [certainly was](https://youtu.be/IiVH-7_nL70?t=499), but that wasn't until WotLK iirc
---
It really depends on your guild.  They may want to gear up all guild tanks so they have a stronger pool to draw from.  Rotation is for the Guild / Raid Leader to manage anyway - not only for gear but for happiness.  
---
Most guilds should be clearing MC/Ony now so the tanks ahead of you will get bored or not require gear from them soon so you should be able to take a slot.
---
If I was you, I'd ping the Guild / Raid Leader to understand what role they have in mind for you and how they'll manage you with active raids.  I'd also try and find some reliable PUG's / other Guilds on your server who may need a tank that you can rely on as fallback.
---
Once again; getting my rhok'delar was my all-time favourite highlight of my whole experience, can't wait to get there again! And can't wait to grab the popcorn and watch the show haha.
---
How
---
System/graphics/ground clutter
---
Good point! The question is, how do you manage to do it?
---
 Not 100% sure but i think this is how they do it.
---
First go to the spot you want to let to return to, have your pet on passive. Then you click “Stay”, now you send in your pet to pull, once it gets aggro you click “passive” again to make your pet go to the spot.
---
You have PvP and you have PvE. Dungeons is a way to gear up for raids. If raiding/prepping is not for you, then PvP must be something for you. If that's not the case either, then you're a social chat-player. Seriously. If not raiding and PvP is nothing for you then WoW is not the game you should be playing at all when grinding dungeons is ALSO NOT your cup of tea. God damn go play another game already if tier 0.5 is too long to wait and is the only thing you play WoW for.  
---
Battlegrounds and dishonorable kills was added so people would stop killing NPC's you kinda need, like flightmaster etc. Yes it killed world pvp but that's the loss for the better!
---
You are playing Classic. You are playing Vanilla. Beside cruical bugs, stop complaining or go play retail!
---
edit: seems that others have problems with the file \Cache\ADB\enUS\Dbcache.bin and it helped them by deleting it everytime. cant try, not at home.
---
MC took most casual guilds months to get their first Rag kill. It's a solved game, everyone is going in with their best gear and know the fights. It lasting a handful of hours isn't intended.
---
whoa lol.
---
Goddamnit.
---
Still worked 😉
---
Another example, strat dead, purple banshees=melee, whites=ranged. Same for spiders and gargoyles. Screechers=ranged with a melee aoe fear, gargs=dumb melee, crypt beasts will run to you the others chuck scarabs that go to the nearest target regardless of threat if you try to LoS them so your entire group needs to pay attention.. for once.
---
Report the Guild
---
Call them out on Reddit
---
Make sure those People suffer.
---
Get them banned pls
---
At least get the guild disbanded and some People banned :3
---
You make good points about the weapon upgrades making big differences.  You'll want to snag the Whirlwind Axe.  You'll have that until the Gatorbite Axe from Maru.  In the 30s-mid 40s I was having a good time as a Warrior.  After that it was madness again.  Especially 50s...EPL/WPL were kicking my ass, and I had to respect to prot ASAP to even begin tanking those end-game dungeons effectively.
---
in nicer terms, he's basically calling you out for defaulting first to blaming your dps, when you by your own decisions have a heal capacity is markedly lower than if you were not offspec, *forcing* your dps to kill faster to cover this deficit.
---
Have your pet on passive, click stay. Send it to attack, when you click passive again it will return to its stay position.
---
Mage winning Senior Designer's Pantaloons off of Fineous darkvire over me as holy priest left me salty for a moment.
---
So if you go from Cat to Bear and back to Cat, without canceling predatory strikes, you won't get it when you go back to cat?
---
Arcanist Crown vs Netherwind Crown? They're kinda similar unless I'm wrong to assume the SP difference between the two is compensated with the 1% Spell Hit on Arcanist crown.
---
&gt;Fuck you piece of shit, well deserved suspension, good riddance.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Hope you get banned
---
no, its possible to build this process within a ingame wow macro. so this shouldnt be bannable.
---
My favorite memory was when I tried WOW for the first time at a friend's, I created a Human (can't remember the class), and started the zone. Some people were talking about how the Dwarf starting zone was great, and that it was close to Ironforge.  
---
I then took to myself to discover it, and I asked them how to get there, and they replied "The shortest way is through Stormwind." So I kept on levelling, and arrived in Stormwind, by that time, I was the only person still awake in the house, and decided to set sail for Ironforge... Level \~10 ... after countless deaths, a high level saw me in whatever higher- level zone there was, and asked me WTF I was doing here... After a good laugh, he asked me why I would not take the sub... and escorted me all the way to Ironforge (as apparently, I had already made more than half the way).
---

---
Me: Alright then. Keep your secrets.
---
I frequently play from 2 ips, from work and from home
---
my behaviour has to look 100 times more suspicious than yours yet I never had any problems so I doubt we have the whole story here
---
Most casual guilds will fall apart in AQ and Naxx.
---
Uhhhh...I love you
---
Same. 200 alliance was hard with 5+ sec delay. :)
---
why are you trying to melee in MC ?  
---
Go back to your healing spot pls
---
Oh fuck off. This is super common and I don't click people's names.
---
Y'all are ridiculously cynical and anyone who's been here more than a day knows it.
---
But he is tho. You can say he's not wrong, but he is. Maybe go read into why Blizzard did what they did instead of confirming random conspiracies on Reddit.
---
Pallies roll on literally everything
---
Being invited on my 56 paladin to a 15 man ubrs run back in vanilla.
---
Ah it is the same guy who got banned for gold buying hahahaha
---
But you're not really gaining *that* much from the holy talents. 12% increased healing and mana refund on a crit and that's your lot for those 20 points, as far as healing goes.
---
Anytime I see a lock join a party who doesn't have imp threat reduction I go 'They do know their threat capped right?'
---
ZG and AQ25 was catchup gear.
---
My favorite memory is the evening I spent playing with one of my (soon to be) best friends.
---
That friendship has lasted from 2007 until now, so many adventures later.
---
Gotta love Perternato, great people and know what they're doing. Definitely the guild I'd join if I were guildless.
---
Yet to have a single terrible experience as tanking, currently lvl 45.
---
I'm curios about the following for anyone who had terrible experiences tanking.
---
At which level and instance ?
---
EU or USA ?
---
tyvm, I figured it was simple but that's embarrassing lol. ty ty
---
I always thought the mobs dropping these are in EPL but good to know thanks :)
---
No we cannot get BGs already. Follow the Vanilla releases or go play retail ffs
---
Am a math person: 
---
You probably don’t need to do anything complicated. Exactly as you said to test this guy’s theory. Track consecutive proc-rate. So if you have a list in your text file, 1 to n, check each value i. If i is a proc, check i+1. If the proc-rate is 20%, for each proc i, i+1 should be a proc 20% of the time. 
---
Then just output mean and standard deviation I would think.
---
Oh poor rogs, I almost cried it was so sad.
---
LOL mages bad amirite? Fkn mages, the hunters of classic! Never gets old!
---
Feels more accurate to ESO as alot of the heals you have requires you aim directly at them. The times the dps run around for no reason and you miss the heals is agony.
---
\*Psst\* check his post history.
---
That looks neat. I'm not familiar with it, but it looks like a powerful tool.
---
Yeah I tried it and it is more like 25g/h
---
And now you take the other 80% of players into consideration, who are not bursting through the content yet.
---
Doesn't matter how easy MC is. Some of us aren't even lvl 60. Many who are lvl 60 haven't been in a raid yet.
---
And you know what? That's good. I don't wanna have Naxx out in a year just because some no lifers couldn't fucking control themselves and calm down a little.
---
THANKS!! I have been going CRAZY from this...  
---
Never ever happened to me while playing a rogue previously in my whole life.   
---
Only on classic WoW
---
It was super fun to see this many people in ogrimmar. Keep it up Alliance of Dreadmist. Will see you when world pvp is up! Thanks for showing that you care about the server. We are cumming for u &lt;apex&gt;.
---
ok......
---
Did my first raid yesterday as 30/0/21 - was top shaman heal (overall) - so I can encourage you!
---
get your emotes ready next time. a nice /thanks would be in place.
---
Yeah, pretty sure he said it as a joke. That's usually what I expect when someone calls anything "rude" these days.
---
Fuck, I'm prot with shield slam and I'd /RATHER/ be tanking as arms in 5 mans tbh. I'd rather just be able to mindlessly charge/ss/ww and then go to dstance to hold aoe aggro. That's infinitely better than anything in my fucking prot toolkit.
---
You build up threat to gain aggro, they aren't exactly synonyms to me.
---
Consecration is great for stealthers in PvP 
---
Intel and Str - vital
---
Reduced CD on LoH is just a touch. 
---
Difference between my set and a str/agi ret is when we’re low health, I can heal myself to full, carry on and do practically the same dmg, whereas they’ll be OOM and do nothing.
---
Even if you did buy gold you shouldn't be banned. Buying gold keeps people that can't handle the game in it playing longer so im all for it
---
Saving this. Many thanks
---
Done it for every remotely important roll, has not worked. I claim fraud and BS!
---
It's the better PvP combo, escape artist is amazing as melee.
---
Supply and demand. Don't mind at all and find the tanks who charge usually are better and more confident
---
99/100 when someone appeals a ban and blizzard tells them to fuck off its because they did exactly what blizzard said they did.  He didn't just get banned he tried to appeal it and was sent packing.
---
I do and it's still hard to see.
---
I’ve gotten 3 16 slots now just from them dropping, no way am I paying 30-40g for a 16 slotter
---
By default, but some are coded to stay in their rooms to prevent exploits.
---
FYI, 6 protection warriors means 2 empty groups out of those 40 people with no tank.
---
I always took the dice as "cmon, daddy needs new shoes"
---
/u/Literally_Pelley Why are you refusing to respond to the valid points being made here? Since your initial reply consisting solely of personal attacks and immature outbursts was removed, I'd love to see your actual response.

6 in \~30min.

On my server one goes for 40g - thats 240g in half an hour, not calculating the Thorium - damn.

Imagine being so insecure that you have to cover up your mistakes with repeated blatant personal attacks.

You may have left a VPN on then disconnected it when you noticed.

They do indeed.

&gt; If you use an open bid system the cost of the item should be the highest bid. This addon defaults the price to the second highest bid.
---
This is how its supposed to work. The winner of the item is whoever bids highest but you don't spend what you bid, you spend whatever the second highest bid is +1.
---
&gt;They mean it generates so much aggro, that it basically serves as a taunt
---
There is no amount of aggro a skill can generate to basically serve as a taunt.
---
After a while into the fight even a massive threat generation will not be enough to instantly turn the mob when you need it.
---
Go to retail
---
This is a pretty old problem. It's because you have aggro but a boss can't 'reach you'. Instead of evading some bosses will try to teleport you first.
---
My favourite WoW memory (boy, it’s hard to choose) is the time when my guild defeated Ragnaros for the first time back in Vanilla, after all that hard work through Molten Core for weeks and weeks, and the guild being rewarded with Eye of Sulfuras. We crafted the hammer for our guildie that very same night, and people gathered outside Ironforge to watch him duel anybody that wanted to.
---
Yes you are completely wrong. You will have People running you through MC that are already decked out and you will be full in 3-4 runs of MC :P
---
People never stop doíng MC because of alt characters and legendary Drops. As well as some amazing weapon Drops etc. 
---
You will never be too late :P

A priest outrolled me on the chromatic carapace. All I have to say.
---
I feel like I covered the point when I said that I good tank would let a healer get full mana when drinking whether from 5% or 75%, it doesn't matter. Of course when the tank doesn't notice, charges in and starts taking damage the healer has to get up, but even stubbornly drinking from 75% to full takes like 5 seconds. If the pull is so hard that the tank gets killed in 5 seconds without heals then that's an extra point for not charging in without checking that everybody's ready. Just felt like a moot point to make.
---
You're actually wrong, in the first instance Stealth and the Vanish buff are applied for a fraction of a second, but he takes damage straight after, meaning it falls off.
---
Get glasses, turn on herb tracking, increase contrast on your monitor.
---
My best memory? It's hard to narrow it down, however I would perhaps say it's the multiple memories of world PVP and interaction. From stalking Grom'Gol on hunter, to waiting in ambush in Dustwallow Marsh. I wouldn't always win my encounters, but the thrill of the fight, adversity and immersion was always second to none.
---
And then afterwards I would have a relaxing fishing session somewhere serene.
---
Reported a both in Silithus over 3 weeks ago, he was still there yesterday. I sometimes kill his pet while he's fighting mobs, but like he just logs out for a few minutes then resumes again.
---
I got so sick of slow weapons that at level 47 I bought [Taran Icebreaker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2915/taran-icebreaker) (sells for 10g on my server) and went 2H fury. My actual DPS barely increased (was using [Stoneslayer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9418/stoneslayer) beforehand), but it was a refreshing change of pace.
---
[This](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/02305-05050131025012051) is the build at 50 if you're interested.
---
Your first sentence and the rest of your post contradict each other.
---
I agree. I always thought the Plaguelands PvP towers should have been in from phase one or two. Dungeon .5 sets in 2 or 3 would make a lot of sense too.
---
I honestly can't deal with lock. Yeah nobody fucks with you in PvP but the mana issues on top of always having to collect soul shards suck. I constantly just feel like a shitty mage.
---
Their BIS absolutely stinks in some areas, I feel like they're entitled to be this way and this comes from a Priest

My favourite memory is starting WoW a late night in 2004. I was messing around on a single player in a Warcraft map. My uncle walked in and said "oh you're still playing that game?". He took over and fired up WoW from one of his file folders and I rolled a tauren shaman, thinking they could bloodlust (my favourite spell in Wc3). I was 9 years old at the time, and I've been playing ever since.
---
DM E farm as lock for example is significantly easier with t1 gear, 3 hours sometimes is not even enough for full brd run, having multiple alts with different proffesions etc makes you gold easier and so on
---
&gt; bellyachers
---
My favorite memory was the Tuesday morning I woke up and finally reached Commander and getting my epic mount for 90g instead of 900. I was clueless at how to make money back then and just pvped all day.
---
https://discord.gg/dE6ZjE Hope this helps and you can ask away there too. I'm thinking mara at least is still decent gold per hour without gathering professions. It's consistent gold.
---
&gt;Assuming correct drop chance, it is more probable that he will get the item before you.
---
No. They both go in an do it once so it's equal chance of them getting it. 
---
If you count Xn doing it 1001 times and /u/AMA_IamForsaken doing it once, yes it's more likely Xn will get it.
---
The first time experience in 2006 leveling all up to 60 not caring about gear , leveling speed, gold and making new friends while doing this.
---
Yes they do
---
Amen brutha
---
lol, you really think i will hop from layer to layer and bother myself with this for nothing? i dont care about faction killing faction leaders, i just like them see corpse run, so if i am around i help, wont bother with layers tho
---
I've had 2 false positive suspensions for different reasons, one of which was on a friday, which I had to wait for the next frigging business day to resolve.
---
I understand that's not the experience of a majority of players but seriously guys...
---
P2.  
---
Everything else is in its final state, including the r12-14 gear.  
---
The original rare sets are an outlier that just has new items generated while everything else was updated. It makes absolutely no sense to introduce the earlier version when everything else in the game is in their 1.12 state.
---
What would be the best enchant, the agility one?
---
Dont know if Im unlucky but I rarely see any Rich Thorium...still no arcanite crystal too. Probably my only chance will be DM East runs and I need 12 of them for the fucking helm.
---
It's literally the pre-raid BIS for hunters as well. It's a clear winner as well, not like the marginal boost that comes from dal'rends that some BIS lists state. While I'd never roll against any melee for dal'rends I'd have happily rolled against a warrior for gladiator chain. That said I just AOE farmed RoL with 3 mages and a priest for a couple levels until I got mine.
---
Having the first Perditions Blade drop off Rag in vanilla and pushing all of my DKP in to win it. I had a few hundred points more than the next rogue but spent it all to send a message. No ragrets
---
its just an exhausting way of saving some bandages. if I can kill mobs constantly without stopping and lose in 1 min the hp of a bandage i basically have 0 downtime. now combine that with mobs that drop runecloth etc. and you no longer need to kite. only elites you might need to kite, but i just activate recklesness and they melt, so no need there to kite as well. 
---
also kiting is mostly only interesting if mobs hit fast. if a mob hits slow or average speed you maybe skip 1 or 2 attacks each mob while you constantly need to monitor your swing timer to not lose dps etc. 
---
not a fan of the method but for people who like to save bandages and food, sure, why not. 
---
hamstring kiting for me I only use if I aggro 2-3 mobs. i hamstring 2, run away, kill 1 (while the other 2 are not hitting me) etc.
---
Ive never experienced the 19 tick, i would be so pissed. 21 is my bread and butter. Being on 39 energy and ticking to 60 is my wet dream.
---
If your are in the UK then this is pretty much illegal. So take screenshots, evidence and open a ticket. Report the whole guild
---
i have 2 60s, a mage and a rogue, i have never experianced someone open trade without asking nicely for water or opening a box
---
Im so stupid ... why myself created a rogue :(
---
There was a mage who made a jed/rend run with Reed on reserve. I saw him lfm healer for like 30 minutes to an hour. It eventually got to the point he was offering to pay for them not to roll before I stopped seeing him appear in lfg
---
Watching my brother adventure to the Dark portal when BC was launched
---
Also helps a lot for knowing when to weave in/out of melee combat with warriors if you're bleeding them and crippling kitiing out of melee range (but too close for intercept) etc.
---
There is nothing to no life. If you ding 60 you are ready for MC and then you beat it instantly and game is over PvE wise.
---
well, seeing the big crits can be very appealing as well ^^
---
Well if you look for a place to present your hardcore xtreme pvp skillz then maybe wow classic isnt the place for you.
---
Have you heard of Fornite? If you love LOS then youll love Fortnite cause you can actually build barriers to hinder LOS! Also its for free so you save money too!
---
You need greater blessings which u get your first of at level 52.
---
Another healer chiming in here. I don’t mind tanks pulling while I’m drinking, but please for the love of all that is holy, can you not pull outside my LoS while I’m doing so.
---
There’s nothing more infuriating than sitting down to drink, and then having to get up and rush to the tank 5 seconds later because they charged into a pack of mobs in the next room and your heals won’t be LoS.
---
Anyone knows if anything similar to legacyplayers will be available for Classic? Having historical data of how the guild performs (and improves) as well as each individual player - absolutely loved it!
---
Killing the Lich King on 10man hc with my guild.
---
&gt;Or maybe when someone says "flying killed world PvP," I should correct them and say "World PvP died in early vanilla with BGs"?
---
Maybe you should, because it's what happened.
---
1.3*1.2. Gives 1.56 increase. Test it yourself if you want. Works on classic as it should
---
I kiiiiinda agree....but currently my lockpicking is low, so if I can skill up, I'm more than happy to be spammed by them (though I'm rarely in cities or anywhere where there's tons of players, so unfortunately I'm not getting this at all), but I can imagine how annoying it is when your lockpicking is as high as it'll go or when the people doing so have locked boxes that won't skill you up.
---
It matters because we can get more in depth knowledge about this problem... Rather than have to sift through screenshots...
---
People called me mad when I said I level as prot.
---
But my warrior (whos a raid tank atm) leveled as prot spec all the way to 60. If 2hand arms spec took 30secs to kill a mob, prot one took 45secs but when non prot spec had its hp down to around 65%~ with one mob and has to sit down after 2, my prot could literally go non stop mob killing one after another with a stable 90%~ hp, only eating after like 20 mobs in total killed. With all the armor migitation and shield block spam (+revenge stuns) you barely take any damage while you kill stuff with the auto attack dmg.
---
It's not 'catch up gear' 
---
I mean if you only reach max level in june next year and want to catch up, you'll grab a few item from BG reputation, go to DM, try to join a pickup group for MC/ZG or ask a friend to take you once in a guild raid where they have almost everything save a few items.
---
But you certainly won't farm full T0 then pay hundreds of gold and do additional quests to catch up. T0.5 is mostly a challenge activity for players who don't like to raid and completionists.
---
I was doing Uldaman yesterday and  noticed every elemental in there was immune to banish, is this a bug or how its suppose to be? The weird thing it even lets you cast it and then you get "immune" when it lands?
---
I dont know how you do onyxia atm, we dps gather up and take the fireblasts ON PURPOSE as it drops their aggro. And the only tricky part is when shes landing anyways. Tanks take all the whelps, have full rage and when others give them like 5 seconds, it hasnt been a issue.
---
And this on horde, with no salv.
---
Private bidding. Everyone bids what they think its worth privately to the loot master. The winner is the person with he highest bid at the end of the timer. They are charged the second highest bids worth of DKP + 1.
---
What did they hotfix to change soloing them?
---
&gt; There shouldn't be a reason to summon
---
Meanwhile I just did 9 summons for a UBRS PUG.
---
Sidestep running allows you to run without dazes, check hamstring kiting, the only effective way to level solo warrior.
---
They never said, planned or was willing to release a different game, so stop whining about something that never will happen. Nice insults, i rate them 1/8. Next time you call someone a sweaty nerd, go in front of the mirror and take a deep breath through your nostrils. Nerd.
---
I'm more surprised you found nodes to mine in Ungoro
---
Bought Elemental Fire a few hours ago for 6.4g on Gehennas
---
Most rage generated by tanks comes from incoming damage.
---
Slower weapons also get more value from HS, as a higher amount of damage gets converted to yellow damage, which can't glance and can crit for 220% if you have impale (though you probably shouldn't).
---
Lots of things "have been known forever" yet you see the top 1% players DW tanking, having close to 300 defense, and using muggers belt on non-humans to get dagger skill. Not because daggers are great, but because dagger skill is easy to get.
---
You can enter the warrior theorycraft discord if you want and discuss specifics there. They'll also tell you weapon speed is largely irrelevant at this stage of the game. 
---
The main reason tanks don't take brutality or viskag is because it's not needed and furys would get mad.
---
Noob story?
---
It took me until yesterday to get to lvl 60...
---
What does that have to do with people who get banned and then denied their appeals?  I didn't say 99% of people who ever get banned did what blizzard said they did I said 99% who have their appeal denied did.
---
Blizzard hands out lots of bans with little "evidence" but when they deny an appeal they've looked into it and decided you're full of shit.  They're usually right.
---
Funnily enough I remember Vanish being worse than it is in Classic, and that it hardly ever seemed to work properly.
---
Seems like Blizzard doesn't care about botting. Seen several obvious bots that have been reported and are still running around in south west of tanaris.
---
I think downing VAEL for the first time, it took a LONG time to finally get it down. With the CD on her spawn you couldnt just do numerous pulls.
---
I dinged 60 weeks ago. 
---
I'm doing dungeons daily. I take some days like this sunday for farming. Just browsing all the 55-60 zones for herbs and ores. I help guild mates with dungeons or leveling. I farm rare recipes or items. Sometimes I do quests just for fun and gold.
---
I haven't done DM:N or DM:W a single time. 
---
There is so much you can do in this game outside of raids. The game is far from over for a long time, even without MC and Ony.
---
If you think raids are the only reason to play the PvE side of the game, you should probably just play retail or another game.

It’s good at 60 till you can get a replacement from raids, although there’s no point dual wielding until you can get hit gear, don’t get me wrong it does work before 60 but it doesn’t feel good and you’ll kill everything much quicker as a 2h arms warrior as a 40 warrior
---
Ah yes, Arena. I too love running around pillars endlessly.
---
So stupid.
---
Get a life and stop responding on your alt Reddit account lol
---
Except you are not flagged for PvP when using a flight master.
---
i showed you my box pls unlock
---
Can we please ban this troll already?
---
I read all of those as lv 1 "insert number"
---
Super confused myself.
---
Play paladin if you want to brain dead heal, play preist if you actually want to think about what you're doing. Preist has a high skill cap, paladin doesn't have a skill cap.
---
Fyi, you can have a maximum of 30 bars of rested experience accumulated after 11 days.
---
This is my main and I’m on 8 days something hours
---
Now you can pull every mob in LVL 60 dungeons with the LVL 51 whelps that spawn from the sword.
---
Right, but I think gear wise you're in the top 5-10% right now. This argument would assume that the tank inspects you before the run and makes the case that since you're somewhat raid geared it's possible to pull fast. On the other hand I've had cases where I've already popped all the cooldowns, potion gone, rune gone, mana tide gone, I'm at 10% mana and the tank still goes for the next pull. It's a really hopeless feeling knowing that you can't do anything unless you drink at least 5 seconds. In cases like this, when I'm out of combat and the tank is dying fast I'll just try to stay out of combat to ress everybody. If I'm in combat then it's just damage control by yelling out for everybody to use their cooldowns. Like I said, the healer knows what tools they have and if they're ready for the pull.
---
Sweet. I was confused by atlas loot showing the rare set as being released in P6, while two blue sets exist on wowhead.
---
Pretty sure I've seen a bot just like that on my server as well. Same hunter always hanging around in that area, all day all night.
---
I guess I just dont consider farming ores thrilling content.
---
Haha get destroyed
---
so?
---
To be fair:  
---
The tank shortage is just for dungeons - guilds are searching desperatly for heals / dd's atm since only 2-3/40 are needed for mc.
---
We had a guild applying for fusion yesterday that wanted to bring 4 tanks 1 heal and 5 dd's.
---
Ah yes true. It's actually my video, it's just so long ago I don't remember exactly when it was :D
---
I shouldn't even have tried to discuss with an internet troll...
---
Only been posted like 10 other times.

Interesting! Will check it out because if so you are big right
---
I'm right, google it!
---
The one night I’m not online cause It’s date night with my missus.   Next time I’ll be around to defend.
---
Hunter feign death into ice trap is not working correctly. So serious pvp is not a real option. Also as soon as phase 3 hits hunters are going to be bottom of the barrel for dps in raids.
---
IMO, no.

Greater Blessings provide a buff to all characters of the same class in a raid in a single cast. And you get threat for every single character. So the more characters of a class there are in the raid, the more threat you generate from a single Greater Blessing cast.
---
Too many items are multi class. Aurora stone hammer is needed by druid and shaman. Mage blade is bis for mages and holy paladins. So many melee rings and items can go to warriors, rogues, or hunters.
---
That's a 15 year old debate which with WoW Classic just has come back in full swing. You'll find proponents for both options and then some in between.
---
To avoid this very problem I've made a macro asking the group to vote on how such drops should be rolled upon which I post at the start of a run. At least then everyone is in the clear how it will be dealt with.
---
But in the random group you most likely won't do that since the chance is so low. And after it drops of course the people in the group who could use it are in favor of "only need if you use it" while the rest just sees a big pile of gold.
---
IMHO in random groups I tend to agree that people who can use a blue item should get it but equip it right away. Most of those aren't that valuable in the grand scheme. Purples on the other hand are a big pile of gold and 1/x of a epic mount. On those I would roll need as well and state so beforehand.
---
Much harder on Classic than private servers due to the hitboxes and leeway mechanics being different.  Especially as a Tauren where my leeway is much larger.
---
Made me think about how much I hate westfall
---
I was revered before I saw that xbow, ~25 runs or so, and these are not fast runs because people are idiots in strath ud
---
Anything to get that cheap karma
---
I started in BC. My favorite memory was probably when I got into outland for the first time. I was only around level 38 or so and a mage I befriended gave me a portal to Shattrath. In my mind Outland was like this elite place where only the best of the best players could hang out, it was super fascinating to me. I was allowed to follow the mage around as he did random quests in Nagrand and I remember just being in awe of how insanely cool everything looked. And I got oneshot by the mobs who were like 30 levels higher than me too a lot. Even though it's so simple and casual exploring Outland was probably the most fun I ever had in this game. I've never been as immersed in a game as I was back then.
---
Probably depends on the server, I've had almost purely positive experiences on mine.
---
Running through dustwallow marsh with my friends at low levels to go gank in the barrens and dying to everything on the way. 14 years ago now.
---
mc was a few ppl for a week.  i wouldn't call that a lot of resources
---
Ugh, it's basically impossible to farm on my server now that it's down to one layer. Super horde imbalanced and high pop. I've pretty much given up on EPL.
---
Wasted gold in buying bag slots at the bank, before I realized they started costing 50 gold. 
---
&gt;.&lt;
---
Strange since they've said multiple times that they don't.
---
Or let them /roll after the loot roll passed and see if they would have won.
---
I had this too as a tank. 
---
Your job is keeping your healer save, cause every hit taken will interupt, increase his cast duration. 
---
Its not your job to keep the dps save, if they gain aggro often, the healer will soon stop healing them cause its annoying to waste mana on triple income dmg.
---
Tell them that basic movespeed of enemys is 20% more as players, they cant outrun the monster but the tank.
---
If they dont run at the tank for a quick taunt, just tank the other ones and let them die.
---
!Remind me 6 Hours
---
Reply to wrong person champ?
---
A bit hypocritical. One of the WoW devs was named Tigole and he was hardly fooling anyone with that name.
---
Why should he split?
---
Some people might not know that. And in those cases I would allow them to /roll as well and see if they won.
---
one of the places I took new guild members to back in the day on the rp-pvp server I played, it was an initiation of sorts, they had to jump down (trusting me to bop them) and afterwards there were some duels and then a small story/conversation, was always fun
---
anyway we got there not by swimming but climbing mountains and then running across a large unfinished map, can't remember the exact route anymore though :P
---
Whats the difference between lesser and standard invisibility potions in PVE besides how long they last? They're super cheap on my server and would make getting to king on a solo tribute run way less of a headache if they're the same thing.
---
My favourite WoW memory is me raiding with my friend guild. We all quit our respective guilds and joined up and formed a 10 man raiding guild, sure I stopped doing hard mode but we started doing fun mode. It was epic.

Since one of the newer updates it works perfectly fine! Great addon :)

---
That does not even make sense world pvp is not supposed to be about skill. It's about having spontaneous pvp, city raids and large scale battles.  If you're looking to Showcase your skill as a gamer you're playing the wrong video game genre
---
MMOs are the least skill-based genre of video games.
---
It's like me saying I'm an incredibly skilled tic-tac-toe player when there's board games like chess and go.
---
Just need some good RNG sent my way, farming the tiny crimson whelpling even though I should be leveling to 60. Probably not the best way to make gold but will help pay for my first mount and training 😁
---
&gt;anwhile if you look at stormwind you basically have to run through the entire city population if you want to get to the throneroom.
---
Which failed spectacularly.
---
Now you got the full lvl 30 melee starter pack
---
Raiding Karazhan in 2007
---
Well turns out its just not enough, they said tanking is not just button spamming and keeping aggro, u gotta look into it and know rvery aspect of tanking on how to be a "proper" tank, yet they refuse to exactly pinpoint what im doing wrong
---
I ran DM (deadmines) and the tank reserved the 2-handed hammer that Mr. Smite drops. We got to the fight, the hammer dropped. The tank needs on it, cheering.
---
*the paladin also needs on it without saying a word even though he agreed to the reservation, and he won it*
---
thanks good to know. Do the two different pots share the 10 min cool down? Didn't think about that
---
Definitely not dead
---
*Hong Kong Police Corner Lone Protester in Alleyway - 2019
---
Thank you for your answer. I guess I have to really try it to understand it. Untill then I’m really comfortable with click target and cast spell with keyboard/ fingers. At least thats what I’ve been doing healing as a resto druid in retail m+ high keys. Yet again retail and classic... not really the same :)
---
But I also guess that this technic for healing isnt only a thing in classic.
---
On retail
---
No, its still layered and one of the more populated servers in EU, its only dead now because you're trying to play at 10am on a Tuesday.
---
What did it take?
---
Out of interest. why don't you intend on raiding? It's really easy and it only takes like 2 hours per week right now.
---
Because hoarding dkp instead of getting upgrades just so you can get a preferd piece holds the whole raid back. These hunter items that op is talking about are good but not until they get 8/8. People arent gonna give up instant stats for that. 
---
And its unfair to force them to lose dkp that they want to use on a better upgrade later.
---
You are right though the problem is the guild. If they dont have the same common goal for everyone to get better and stronger so the raid can clear easier then stuff like this would make any loot system fail. If a guild is fine with a dkp system and people are using it properly to take upgrades and not be greedy about gear then it's probably fine.
---
But ultimately people are stupid and it should be up to guild leadership to protect the other raiders from stupid decisions. I would rather be in a guild where I trust the leaders to have the best interest of the entire raid in mind and can put the gear where it will do the most good for everyone. Stronger raiders equal faster and cheaper raids for everyone. Which in turn will mean more time for harder progression later on. If that isnt a guilds goal then none of this really matters cause they wont make it into bwl anyway
---
As i'm farming shadow drake scales in burning steppes, i stronghly disagree.
---
keep it as it was .. classic all over with all dumb shit
---
Are ally buffs hidden? I see only your own buffs but mages have amplify magic which increases spell damage and healing taken if they are crazy enough to use it.
---
Exactly what I'm doing. I got Assassin main and Hanzo OH until raid. I'm only level 51 I'll ding 52 this am likely. Omw
---
I just hit level 30, and I have 1g. Where are some good lvl 30-40 gold farming spots?!
---
Achieving the 'The Undying' title back in WotLK when the raid was current. My Guardian Spirit on a DC'd tank that (logically) couldn't hide for the frost bomb/breath while Sapphiron was on 1%, to avoid the death, was definitely my prime moment of raiding up until then.
---
Another high - Karazhan when it was a 10 man raid. I think the raid I enjoyed most out of all, due to having a small group of friends that we did it weekly with, progressed through encounters that we couldn't do the week before..
---
Dungeon Set 2 is planned for p5, not 6.
---
Look at the bones!!!!!
---
I play PvP by my rules. If you were on my server I would camp your body based off this comment alone. I'd have my 800 person guild come and make sure you couldn't quest. Its been done, and will happen again. People with integrity don't get camped.
---
always know that there are more people playing at your speed then people rush to 60. you just hear and see more about 60 players .. 
---
keep calm and enjoy the game in your pace
---
He even agreed, they wanted it to be catch up gear, but it really isn't because of how expensive and relatively bad it is conpared to other easily available gear.
---
whats you're point? ruining someone elses experience who isn't PvPing is a sign of bone headed immaturity.
---
I am offended by this statement. I have frostbolt on 2.
---
You keep Teldrassil and we keep our self-confident, evil, plotting Sylvanas who has found new meaning in protecting her Forsaken (with all means necessary etc.). Not that made-up, whiny "broken character" Sylvanas who, despite being a leader to her people for 15+ years has a breakdown when some kid says "I pity you". Deal.
---
Yeah, I thought it was 5 or 6.
---
Do you have any source for the rare PvP set coming in P2. I didn't find anything.

Simply incorrect. We have had patch 1.4 / 1.5 items in MC and other such things.

As an overarcing theme, yes, but with logic applied where it makes sense.

This is one such place.

We had the most horribly desastrous BRD run a couple days ago. I don't know when was the last time I had so much fun. So many things just went hilariously wrong.
---
I couldn't stop laughing. When everyone says the game is sooooo easy it's really embarassing if a premade group of friends who are frankly pretty good at the game fucks up so badly for 3 hours straight. Absolutely glorious night. I pity the fools who cannot derive joy from failing in classic.

I dont play a priest but i thought the lower rank greater heal was more mana efficient than any of the flash heals in level 60?

Bone crusher is more or less free, so I would get it regardless. You get it from DM W.

Dreadforge is strong, but Barbarous blade is stronger. If you are an Orc, go for the axe, if not, the blade - easier to get.

This is essentially the same thing when you have rules for incremental bidding.

Still doesn’t change the fact that the addon doesn’t support it.
---
You use to be able to take them on one by one by damaging one and evading the other, but a recent hotfix made it so that damaging one member of a group that's linked to pull together will make all other members avoid evading. You can still kill one and then evade the other, but until then you have to survive against both and kiting them in ST is much more unpredictable since sometimes one of them stay on the top of the ramp where you kite them while the other one follows you down.
---
We're not even in honor phase. People are just ruining other players experiences and causing them to not want to play.

My first raid as a fresh 60 after playing for about 4 months since March of 06 was a zul gurub, my irl friend was a tank for his guild DaKine on the realm darkspear. He got me in the guild and into the raid and also got me to download ventrillo. Now I was trying to set it up as quickly as possible and had no idea what I was doing, somewhere along the line managed to set my username as DaKine. After a while someone noticed someone called dakine in the channel and they sounded upset in their American accents (I'm Australian), they kept asking who was DaKine to speak up and change their name, I just sat there and played dumb, I didn't have a microphone so I just sat there and waited for them to resume the raid. We get up to the last boss. In my excitement I thought I would help and use my expose armor on the boss. I soon learn that this gets rid of the sunder armor stacks that the tanks merticuloisly built up. They lose aggro, the raid wipes. Another rouge who was very nice to me the whole time, whispering me instructions on how to level up my first aid past 225 (I didn't know how) then goes "never use expose armor". I was a noob wrecking ball. Sorry Dakine raiders of 06.

I don’t have any questions, I just wanted to unload and didn’t think this deserved its own post.

WoW is the first game I’ve ever played that  isn’t a phone game like Candy Crush, and I know I’m still new to the game (this is going to be my third week), but I am getting more &amp; more stressed out as my level rises. I really enjoy the game. But I’m not good enough and I feel so self-conscious about interacting with other players. I hit level 34 tonight and I still haven’t done any dungeons because I’m worried about ruining the run for everybody. I know it’s stupid to be so stressed out over a game but there’s so much information to take in, it almost feels like everyone else is speaking in a foreign language. Literally a foreign language—I still don’t understand a lot of the shorthand... It took me forever to understand what “LF1M Tank WC” meant. My brother played Classic back in the day and he’s the one who convinced me to start, so I have someone to call up if I’m totally lost but I hate asking him for every little thing. At least when I was a total low level I felt comfortable sucking but I’m starting to feel like I won’t ever develop the actual skills to be a good player. The guild I’m in invited me because my brother’s in it and while everyone has been friendly they’re all veteran players who are approaching 60. Everyone also has jobs and real life commitments so I feel bad about wasting their time since they’re an extremely efficient group of players. I just don’t feel like I’ll ever catch up.
---
At what point is the game not worth it? I want to play so bad but it's not 04 anymore. I can get 15 to 20 min a day tops to play and MAYBE a dungeon a week. My highest is 36 and that's because I took 3 days off work due to illness.
---
Could grow a spine and get over it, people's words only have power over you if you let them.
---
Back during classic, forsaken registered as undead if I recall correctly. I remember this because I remember heading into UC at some point with (can't remember which class) and turned on to detect for undead, only for all of UC to light up with dots :p
---
thanks, yeah I tend to avoid AE unless it's an emergency or to quickly finish up a fleeing mob. Do you nova before CoC-ing?
---
Yeah, no bs titan forging. Either that 0,3% chance offhand of shadow wrath drops or dozen of ones  with useless rolls do. About to hit my 300th kill so I'm bound to get one any minute now, that's how the probability works, right? Unless I get unlucky and have to run a couple hundred, or thousands runs more. Still glad no titan forging is involved because zero point something drop chance is, in the end, definitely not the same thing.
---
dont green and yellow quests give same exp?
---
They did it this way on Kronos 1, and it was great. It added relevance to the 0.5 sets and associated dungeon boss drops.
---
BUT those items were overpowered as fuck, making easy content even easier. They are even better than raid BIS for some slots, breaking the normal flow of gear progression. This is especially noticeable for Rogues where 4pc Darkmantle + 3pc Bloodfang + Boots of the Shadow Flame was BIS in BWL tier. I would expect this to be the same on classic as 6pc Shadowcraft has been tested to have the same high proc rate of 2ppm
---
This shouldn't have made me laugh as much as it did.
---
You're literally gaining nothing from camping someone in a non-honor phase. You are truly an idiot. If you actually want your PvP server to be fun during the honor phase you wouldn't be a brain dead camper causing people to not want to play. But then again, most WOW players are braindead Fortnite mentality scrubs.
---
that looks like the desolace tower on the coast?

or maybe should learn to play

Screenshot, screenshot, screenshot, report ticket

Why do I need a tank for dungeons? There are plenty of relatively good equipped furys out there and I have \~680 heal+
---
Shall I start charging people for healing them?
---
Try running away a little bit and using LoS to drop combat. 
---
Some of the mobs have stealth detection and will still see you after you pop vanish.  I found that running away a few yards and using LoS makes it 100% work vs the a chance of dropping combat in front of the mob.
---
This is almost spot on my situation.  Raiding is never going to happen for me.  I might be lucky enough for the odd PUG, but I'm never going to be in a situation to get gear from raiding.  I'm on the cusp of level 40, and my plan is to take my time and work my way through T0 even if it's not BiS, because it's a nice objective to have, then I'll have a go at working my way through T0.5, again because it's something to work towards.  I played in vanilla, I know how much/little there is for non-raiders to do at 60, so I'm taking my time to relax and enjoy the journey.
---
When you say you are no good at the game, what do you mean? Can you give examples?
---
It could be you are just like everything else, and are overthinking it. What class do you play?

I heard it called stutter stepping

You can actually kite Cairn outside of the city and safely kill him with a few friends. Used to be a big thing when faction leaders gave Honor. So maybe the easiest if done correctly.
---
I was just trying to make a point and 5 seconds seemed like a good time. Of course it should take the healer only a second to start to drink when out of combat when they need to. Just that I've had long pauses when the tank doesn't pull and we're all just standing there. When I finally tell them to pull they go "mana?". If somebody's bitching at you for letting them drink then they are just a bad person trying to find a reason to be angry at somebody.
---
heres a simple trick, it works best when you get friends to join you:
---
step 1: park the character you want to pvp with in goldshire or westfall and log out (both areas are good to start fighting in and might have high lvls reinforcing during pvp encounters)
---
step 2: make a new character lvl it to 10-20 or get a lvl appropriate char for the specific zone, run it to goldshire or westfall, and flag the character for pvp and start annoying random people
---
step 3: people will fight back or call for help
---
step 4: once enough people are flagged for pvp, log in on your main character you wanted to pvp with :) and have fun!

Can someone explain to me why he looks so ugly? Is he currently wearing BIS armor?
---
Yeah for sure, you could even argue that you can 1 man it.  Main point being you have a possible epic drop right next to the entrance of the dungeon with like 1 pat you need to kill before getting there.  Hell you could even skip that pat and get there without killing any mobs.
---
What did you do to farm.momey for the mats?
---
It works with all, but blessing of kings is the cheapest to cast so thats the one that is used.
---
My favorite source for tanking content is skarmtank. He mainly does content about furyprot (a tanking build used in speed clear builds) but he is also very knowledgeable about deep prot and very dedicated to help every tank there is out there. You can find him on YouTube or twitch.
---
That being said you aren't necessarily doing anything wrong. DPS players tend to complain about the tank all the time. They want to have it all and while it can be frustrating at times I would use this as motivation to become better.
---
Hope you stick to tanking, in the end there are never enough tanks around for dungeons :)
---
Wow community getting older. That means more people are playing after work/study not instead of.

When I was 13 I watched my 2 older brothers go into DM in full grey as an under leveled hunter and warrior.
---
They spent an entire night cheesing themselves past packs wiping countless times to bosses just to struggle through.
---
I was barely level 10 yet and seeing this kind of "end game" content push my older brothers to their limit was an amazing experience.

for most classes getting all your t1 is definitely not your raid BIS

Next time you see them being ganked, just stealth on by :)
---
Lost the Mageblade 5x to really terribly equipped people.
---
Maybe at the very beginning, but it wasn't uncommon to clear both MC and Onyxia, for example, in a single day once people got geared and fully understood the mechanics.
---
With each new tier though, you're right, we spend more than a few hours per raid.
---
Tons of consumables and 2 sets of gear (threat and mitigation). And demonforged armor+skullflame shield for large packs.
---
:(
---
Every time i see a feral tank it fills my heart with joy.
---
My favourite moment must have been the opening of the Black Portal / launch of TBC. People queue for the game at night and the chaotic war between the factions guarding the gate on the outland side of the portal. Impossible to play the first days but so much fun and so much new to explore.
---
Look at this guy calling someone a sweaty nerd on the classic wow subreddit. We're all nerds here.
---
It resets aggro on everyone it hits. So people stack on the highest threat target, get aggro reset and we heal them up.
---
Stop trying to compare Onyxia's head to typical vendorable loot then as if they're the same thing at all.
---
Vanish got resisted like other spells can.
---
Interesting. There arent however many attack speed increases in the game :/
---
I have a dagger in my back exactly like your story. been hunting after the wand in Scholo. 30+ runs and it's the first time I see it. our healer told me he's gonna pass on it.
---
the run goes pretty smoothly and the boss dies and my wand drops.
---
healer waits until last second to roll need and wins it. insta leaves and has me on ignore.
---
The money is a moot point. Strictly about time for me, though I guess the same premise applies
---
I´m not tanking expert, sthill I wouldn´t 100% rely on others opinion fully. I had a lot of people trying to tell me how to play just to tell me wrong stuff or had a rather awkward opinion on how the game should be played. In general if you can keep aggro away from your healer (especially with multiple mobs) you are fine. The rest is a mixture out of dps need to watch not to outdmg your thread and you need to build enough threat to give your dps the option to fully go out and have max dps going. The icing on the cake is then if you can mitigate dmg to a point where you can stand in longer/bigger battles

Haha yeah of course i remember you. Sent you a pm!

I've been saying this for months now.
---
Changes.
---
Well the exception here is MC loot. They dint have T2 drop in MC, they had bindings drop from start, you had the domo chest at start. Tbh, i think they cba to do two different versions of it.
---
I was doing UBRS because I'm trying to get my full T0 warlock set, and the only thing I needed here is the chest.
---
The chest droped on the last boss, I roll need and I'm so happy because I'm the only warlock here.
---
A mage rolled need too because it's a up for him. 
---
I lost the roll.
---
Yeah it's a up for him sure, but it's really not a great robe, he's gonna find so much better easily.
---
But for me it's was the last piece of a legendary set :(  
---
We talked after that, he was sorry, he said that he didn't even know what a tier set was.
---
I was so mad at first, but it's an honest mistake, life continues.
---
Re hallowen costumes was plating at the weekend and got bat costume by my mate.  Si without thinking leaped down from enormous boulder in the thousand needles. Note to self nope cant fly even as a bat wannabe.
---
Not true.
---
i find healing boring if no dps rips threat
---
that being said, in UBRS (which is basically the only dungeon i see pugs) i have yet to see a single dps warrior switch to shield or hamstring kite if they are about to have a date with the floor
---
It is. The point is the content is so easy efficiency doesnt matter so the whole raiding healing experience is just an absurd race to top the healing meter.
---
This is the exact point, no one is going to pay you for tanking until 60... and that’s only if you have really good gear. Don’t waste your time if you’re not going to tank just to tank
---
Try this instead:
---
 /use \[mod,nochanneling\] Mind Flay(Rank 1); \[nochanneling\] Mind Flay
---
If you´ll ever group up with me, just tell me you are new and dont know what you are doing/what to do. WoW nerds like me are usually happy to show off their knowledge. What sucks is someone _not_ telling they dont know what to do, dont wanna be told any tips, or just randomly leaving.
---
You can just type "Noob looking for a group to do dungeon X" into /1. It might take a while, but youll find a group that will happily show you the ropes.
---
The mantra is "If the tank dies - healer's fault, if the healer dies - tank's fault, if the dps dies - their own fault". So healing wise the priority is healer&gt;tank&gt;dps. If the dps is being stupid and pulling stuff, don't blame yourself.
---
Blizzard is not designing the content pace around you most people have not completed the current content go play another game and wait
---
I'm also new to wow and started playing with a veteran friend. Don't take it so seriously.. I found the community is, for the most part, extremely helpful and friendly. There is also need to use the abbreviations, just ask in /1 if anyone is also doing a quest.   
---
Also I am pretty sure that if your brother convinced you to start with this game he won't mind questions :)   
---
Don't try to be the best or play "perfectly" - Have fun!  
---
Wow is a huge sandbox to do with as you wish. If you want to play with those veterans, maybe read some guides or watch some videos to get an overview and google stuff you feel are interesting or important.

Paladin. You rely on your autoattacks to do all the damage and has an almost zero interactive rotation.

I'm looking for a reddit (classicwow) post with a short video of an Ubrs run where a player is bump from the balcony (in the whelps) with the "wrecking ball" song playing. 
---
Does anyone have a link ? Can't find it :(
---
Hamskring kiting would probably have saved you then. It's not as good as on private servers, but a mob that hits you 3:1 will probably only hit you 2:1 if you hamstring kite right at the edge of the leeway zone.
---
&gt; I feel like there's more to this story though

Yes, I weared this untill I got my robe of the archmage on lvl 58. If you have tailoring it's really worth it to go grind the essences starting from lvl 54-55. Tht way I was able to get my robe of the archmage at lvl 58. Good luck!
---
I’m a Hunter. I was told they’re easier to play so I’m hesitant to reroll &amp; try a different class. Plus I don’t want to start over because I’ve already sunk so much time into my character. I can (obviously) kill mobs and get quests done but I need to step it up, esp. when it comes to kiting &amp; I have poor control over my pet (accidental Afros, forgetting to watch its health bar, etc.). I don’t know how to verbalize everything because it’s so much information to process, like optimal setup for keybinds, maintaining threat on my pet, remembering to turn Aspects on/off, and then little things like, I didn’t know until yesterday that you had to manually upgrade ability ranks on my hotbar, I thought it was done automatically when you went to the trainer. I don’t think I even know what I’m doing wrong, is the thing.

So apparently gamblers have figured this out a very long time ago and if you Google "Streak calculator" there's a million of them that will do this, 
---
350 "hands" and a streak of 26, with a 0.8 probability to continue the streak. The chance of it occurring is (P=0.18) so not a significant result. 
---
You would need something like 40 non procs in 400 swings (16 min with 2.5 weapon) for it to be on the same likelihood as rolling 1 out of 100 on a random roll.

---
It's good if you need to dump rage.
---
If you're healing as enh, I assume you're doing instances under 50. The thing is that some pulls require precasting on the tank. They take &gt;50% of their health as damage in the first second. Depends of the tank, depends on the instance, but the healer will (or should) know this.
---
They've said they'll help out with raid loot (and also the reason 2h window excist for raid loot). But not dungeons.
---
I find your post extremely helpful because its so hard to find this information for vanilla/classic, so thanks for that. But I have a question. You said 10 spirit is 1 mp5. That would make it 2 mp5 during spirit tap. He said he has to choose between 4 mp5 gloves and 10 spirit. But your calculation means that those 4mp5 gloves do DOUBLE the mana regen of the other gloves EVEN WHEN spirit tap is activated. So in this 4mp5 vs 10 spirit situation he should definitely pick the mp5, yes? I'm also curious how much spirit would mp5 be worth for a leveling priest and a holy lvl 60 priest also.. it's not so simple for lvl 60 because it also gives healing, but then spirit tap is not a factor. Would you know how much healing 1 spirit would give at lvl 60? Meditation seems to equal 66 spirit to 1 mp5 when casting nonstop in a raid.. mp5 seems to be insane at any lvl tbh, even for priest.
---
Big difference whether it's a single mob or a pack of 5 or a boss. If the tank knows their limits then then it's all the same with my rant. I mean, everybody should know their limits. If the tank knows that they can stay alive for 30 seconds and pulls while I'm at 0% mana then that's alright. I try to keep an eye on the tank's health to see when I should finish drinking and jump in, sometimes I don't even have to.
---
I hope it's 3.
---
Well ofc they should but screechers wanted #nochanges.
---
No people are used to warriors needing dps items, people just assume you are a fury warrior tanking for dps gear.
---
I recall feeling it was the point at the time.  I was casually leveling in the barrens and thinking, “finally, I can’t get some peace from these town raids”
---
I was going to say, rogue is almost as bad, the difference being that you kill faster and therefore don't take as much dmg, well that and you can just skip a lot of content using stealth if you don't think you can survive a particular pull.
---
As a tank you can set/demand the rules. If they don't want to roll with you, then they are more replaceable. Just be crystal clear as soon as you join a group - and you should have no problem. 
---
As a physical DPS if I know that if something like the Cape of The Black Baron is also going to be rolled on by the tank, I won't react with shock/sadness when it happens. If I'm 90% expecting the tank to let me get it first and suddenly he's rolling, it's kind of a big letdown. Just communicate.
---
Well sometimes mobs are immune to CC, that's all. I don't think it's a bug.
---
For the same reasons some humanoids are immune to sheep or MC
---
agree
---
Had a dps warrior in DM like 6 levels above me with 2h casting a single rank 2 sunder on each mob so I couldn't sunder. Same run was a rogue doing expose armor. When I asked him not to and explained why the response was basically "you sunder for minus armor, now you don't have to". Didn't finish that run, don't have time to explain exact threat mechanics mid-run.
---
the highlight of this vertically filmed cellphone video of a computer screen
---
my thoughts exactly
---
What are you talking about. ZT seems very alive and well. 
---
You're however always welcome to make a new character on a 'proper' pvp realm if thats what you're interested in.
---
Ignore these top 2 comments. I've got 60s on both PvP and PvE. If you don't give a shit about getting ganked there is 0 difference. Just roll PvE if you want.
---
If you are orc warrior then sure. It's a pretty good purchase to get it while leveling if you can use it anyway.
---
Exactly this. Main-spec over your off-spec everytime. 
---
Asking the group beforehand is a polite thing to do.
---
We want more geared main-specced people in the world, not geared off-specced.
---
The content is trivial. If you get 40 lvl 60s in a raid the bosses fall over. You probably noticed in trade chat there is not a single guild that is doing progress or raids multiple days.
---
this is why i love this game
---
Wonder if switching Auras back and forth would count as a threat generator pre-54 (Greater Blessings)?
---
It's a dumbass point if I ever heard one. The moment honor is a thing most won't dare to get close to civilians.

That's why myself and a few friends created a world pvp guild focused on raiding towns and cities and could care less about getting dhks. We do occasional raiding to gear up.
---
If I could make one change to Classic it would be getting rid of DHKs
---
I farmed my gold fairly easily in Desolace. It's a horde only repeatable turn in [quest that rewards you 55 silver if you turn in 5 shellfish](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5421/fish-in-a-bucket). It can be a bit contested, but in the early/late hours it's good money. Was about 10g/hour for me, something like that. Other than that I killed loads of spiders in arathi highlands that rewarded good vendor gold.
---
Oh yeah!
---
My favorite memory is of me &amp; my cousin when we used to duel for hours on end in front of storm wind for gold.... then when lost I would say I needed to go to the bank and logout .... lol good times....
---
Just dont invite other warriors/rogues/hunters etc. Beauty of playing the tank. 
---
Casters shouldnt have a problem on u rolling for 2 sets
---
I laughed at that straight face, but then I saw your name. Incredible!
---
Feral tanks are usually dicks I’ve found, they get the most mad about slight incompetence.  I play with my son most the time and mistakes will get made, especially when a kid is playing, warrior tanks are always chill, usually wielding ravager and fine with some aoe, and react well to asspulling... but 9 times out of 10 a feral tank will instantly kick him for doing anything wrong
---
Another thing that’s different with Vanish in Classic vs Vanilla is that in vanilla you could unstealth after using vanish and run at 100% ms while still having the vanish buff on you, you weren’t able to use in stealth abilities tho! 
---
But if you remove stealth after vanishing in classic you lose both stealth and the vanish effect.
---
Whats the min level to get into LBRS, UBRS, Srat and scholo groups?
---
I dont really have many places to quest anymore because I want to save Plague lands for quest gold farm at 60
---
Walking back and forth between raven hill and darkshire in duskwood. Doing Qs and turning them in again. 
---
Put in general:"I wish there was an autowalk button"
---
My embarrassment was great.
---
At the time, the stated reason for introducing it was to give people who didn't raid a way to get some gear progression, which was something that non-raiders had been asking for for ages. Which is why it is so long and expensive to do it - it is the 'end game' for non-raiders who've got everything they need from the lvl 60 dungeons.
---
It seems to be an unpopular opinion these days but back in my day I did what I do now: LFG UBRS. Groups for that place take ten minutes to form and you always walk away with a few greens and a blue and come out 20-30G richer. It's not as minmaxxed as some of the farming routes but it's also much, much less boring.
---
Why does everyone farm Timbermaw rep?
---
On my server they go for 50 to 55 with arcanite bars going for 65 to 70.
---
Though I'm a warrior so I have other reasons to farm arcane crystals. :)
---
I hope so. 45g a crystal is fucking ridiculous. DM was supposed to drop prices but they doubled instead.
---
Yes, you dont rest without subscription.
---
Classic is very casual friendly as are raids, the most hardcore part is splitting the epicks amoungs the raiders in a way that results in the least amount of butthurt people.
---
Those standing in battle spamming hamstring might just be working on getting their weapon skill up after acquiring a new type
---
My favourite WoW memory is when my high school friend and I were 5 man pugging and I got my first ever Epic drop that I sold on the auction house for 300G and split it with my friend! 
---
The feeling of getting the drop, not knowing fully how much it was worth or how good it was, was amazing!
---
It was a Flurry Axe. For any of you who are curious.
---
I questioned this myself. At 6:22 I had two from one node.
---
Why does the Succubus Seduce just not work so often? I hear the cast aand I'm spamming it but it just doesnt go off 5 times in a row and then I die
---
You can try Maraudon Princess/Tinger runs. Look up ebbnflow on youtube. Also look into dm north duo runs with a rogue.
---
Felcloth bags, the one with 24 slots.
---
There are plenty of times on the internet where it looks like someone is obviously sarcastic, but when asked further it turns out they are actually just stupid.
---
There's a definite amount of micromanagement when it comes to Hunter. I main Hunter on Horde, and have done so since vanilla. 
---
If it helps, I don't use macros at all. Make sure you've trained up your pet skills, and check out websites like Petopia. Their classic page has lots of useful stuff for hunters, such as where to get pet skills, what they do, etc. 
---
It's a tough one, as I don't find Hunter hard to play, so can't really relate on too much on the issues you are having. 
---
Send your pet in, give it a sec or two for growl to go off (and make sure you're getting the latest rank from a pet trainer), apply Scorpid Sting, then auto shoot with the odd arcane shot/multi shot thrown in (multishot if there is no other mobs around). 
---
Also, level as Beast Master. Your pet becomes an absolute monster by late 30's, able to tank 2-3 mobs at a time if you heal it. Check out this guide for useful tips:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/hunter-leveling-classic-wow
---
Post your played time. Probably Most relevant info
---
In Monkeynews Gurubashi clip they're like 36 people in the raid though, while the Spy addon is showing 56 horde. Not really impressive to be winning when you're outnumbering them almost 2:1.
---
The mage gloves would be bis for a while because they give 1% spell hit, rogue 4 set bonus would be bis. Other classes I'm not so sure
---
You can but you will regret it if u ever raid naxxramas. Because past revered  you only get reputation for turn-ins and tokens themselves and undead bosses in strat and I think scholomance. Each turn in you miss 25 or 50 reputation I don't remember exactly, which you could have used when revered to get to exalted.
---
Stock up on free action potions makes shaman pvp much more enjoyable
---
It is out of range.
---
Lol, remember I got mine from ragnaros.  
---
Perfect 100/100 roll.
---
Best dungeon xp farm clpse6 to 60?
---
But how do you focus that threat to a single mob to taunt it without pulling other mobs,for single target tanking
---
lol thank you! :)
---
Dude he has you in his notes now. Game over.
---
I think the soft consensus is that Hunter solo DM tribute is the best gold for one person , but I think warlock runs are good enough, and princess solos work too, especially if you can sell Blackstone rings
---
Repost?
---
nice
---
that unbuffed hp too as a rogue in p1, nice
---
Why would you roll tauren for warrior?
---
Surprisingly little. We both walked away thinking way less of the usual healers and dps teammates we get LOL :D
---
I enjoy it because the mobs are slightly lower level, but it's also pretty competitive on my server as well.
---
A wise sea mariner once said, "No rest for the unsubbed." Then he died.
---
#nochanges taken to the next level.
---
Level 60 process 
---
Druid 9 days ( mostly afk as i said )
---
Priest 5/6 days 
---
Rogue 7 days
---
It's perfectly normal to have such lucky or unlucky sequences in randomness given a big enough sample size. Because of biases in the human brain you'll notice and remember those sequences far easier than you'll notice their absence.
---
Flip a coin two hundred times and you're virtually guaranteed to get a streak of 6 of the same result, and still extremely likely to get a streak of 8: https://youtu.be/DntEoGG7RyY?t=348
---
I've a 49 mage and had it happen to me, I generally remind them to say please.
---
If you play once per week for 2 weeks and only  spend your time in BRd, you still run BRD for 2 weeks AND hardly play.
---
Don't vanish while moving it makes it work about 9/10 more times.
---
My bad, meant Heroic Strike.
---
We do actually! They only house soul shards however and they use regular bag slots so while we have lots of room for our shards, we end up sacrificing normal bag space and have less capacity to carry with us consumables, gear sets and so on.
---
Grats. I got mine + Ironfoe on 4th BRD run.
---
Seriously, that’s over 500 hours in 2 months, or 8+ hours per day. So sleep, work, WoW would take up like all but a few hours every day.
---
22 days played out of 30?
---
Just make your own groups, and don't ever invite a plate wearer
---
Not really. Here's an even easier example.  
---
If both of us toss a coin, both of us have a 50% chance of landing heads.  
---
If I toss a coin before tossing with you, the chances that I get a heads is 50%. However, considering the previous roll, the chances of me tossing a coin and it landing heads two times in a row (compare this to the item not dropping in two consecutive rolls) is 25%. Considering the previous roll you have a chance of doing   
---
* Heads-&gt;Heads  
---
* Heads-&gt;Tails  
---
* Tails-&gt;Heads  
---
* Tails-&gt;Tails  
---
Hope this clears it up.
---
Is this kinda time doable on Alliance?
---
Would there be much of a difference?
---
Well then that fury warr should tank his own dungeon...
---
show your work! what formula are you using for haste? (it's wrong i bet)
---
I’m pretty sure there is a cap on how far you can rank up each week
---
There are no super reliable methods, but if you buy cheap coffer keys or prices for archmage pattern are high on your server, you can get more than 50 gold/hour.
---
I raided into Naxx in Vanilla, but we only ever killed 1 boss.  I always told myself my goal would be to beat Naxx if Classic was released.  I just don't have the time in the evenings to do it.  I play an hour and a half before work each morning and with all my hobbies, I'm lucky if I get an hour in an evening to play.  I'd essentially have to give up an entire evening of either my hobbies or seeing my friends to raid and that's just not something that's a priority to me right now.
---
it pretty much lasts you all the way to 60 since the buff is on half the time, only real pre-raid upgrade is draconic deflector/skullflame
---
You got the whole pay for tanking idea wrong. Its a strictly 60 lvl thing and u tank dungeons where u don't need any loot from. You should have done that dungeon multiple times without wipes and should know ins and outs, not just go there to level.
---
 I do strat live for first orb and ud for 10g or greens every day, carried some people in st for 8g once. Its not a leveling thing and u need to understand where tanking for gold takes it roots from.
---
 Its a thing for overgeared warriors who have nothing to do and no efficient way to farm past dire maul jump runs, so they tank for hire dungeons like sth live where even ungeared tanks don't need any loot. 
---
Keep in mind people rarely want to pay, too. They'd rather look for tank for 1 hour.
---
No that person is an actual stupid person.
---
Theres 2 schools of though for boes of value either everyone rolls need or everyone rolls greed unless you're going to wear it.  Only an absolute muppet would roll greed then cry at someone for rolling need to wear it.  Legitimately the dumbest person
---
Can you pool the 15min over the course of a week? I personally think if money ain't the issue a session of 2 hours a week is definitely worth it.
---
This is what I thought too. However, playing on a medium/low pop (actually now more of a medium/high realm, thanks Blizz!) I've had the free transfer option at least twice during the time I've played - but to be fair, it might have been to even less populated realms. With the few IRL friends who play Classic playing on the same realm as me, I did not really look into the transfer options further. 
---
What you're saying makes sense, probably you get the option to transfer between other low and perhaps medium pop realms, but most likely not to highly populated ones.
---
If you're gonna ask the same question twice, just ask once.
---
Little old school collegehumor for ya
---
Well, just trying to show the most efficent way of boosting in SM-Armory, and i think its fun challenging myself with big pulls, having that many 36-37 mobbs on you actually does a lot of damage, it might not be as easy as you think.
---
Wowhead classic shows pickpocket percentages for heavy junk boxes 5-10 times (at least) higher than what I experience. Am I doing something wrong or is the data incorrect?
---
What stat weights are you using for int, stamina and spellpower to have it come out ontop of the fire runed grimoire?
---
You sound like a delight to play with mate. As a tank I love when i get a dps with this mindset!
---
Noce video, what does your build and gear look like?
---
You did nothing wrong. It's an upgrade, they couldn't use it, gold is nothing compared to a players need for something he is legitimately going to use. He was just salty because he wanted to sell it. 
---
If you had needed it then just sold it then that would be wrong :)
---
as a healer, honestly, it depend. 1,5 or 2 "tanks" make things very easy for me
---
You didn’t know, and if you’re referring to the Scarlet Chestpiece; one just sold on Windseeker-NA for about 115g.
---
But no seriously, Blue BoE’s are fair game for everyone even if it’s an upgrade. Your best bet would be to ask
---
Let's go!
---
Please stop making everything taste of salt.... I'm really full of sodium from all the other Q.Q'ers already
---
oh man, this reminds me of pretty much the exact same scenario in Vanilla. was levelling my rogue and found a hunter bot in the same place. Followed it around a bit and killed the pet a few times, and then killed the hunter, but made sure the mob got the last hit for the durability hit lol.
---
I uploaded a video of it, but I think it was on Google Videos so it's gone now.
---
Your number is closer. If 1% crit was 18 sp then my crits would need to be averaging 1800 more damage than a non crit, and they definitely dont. In full preraid BIS my non crits are about 800, crits close to 1600, so 1% crit is worth approx 8ish so.
---
It’s fine mate, but I usually ask if they are ok with me needing it as it’s an upgrade. They usually are fine with it. 
---
But if like freezing band dropped I would tell everyone to need on it, and then use it if I win
---
Classic doesn't have "artificial spell batching". It's caused by literally the same system as the original spell batching.
---
Sure. You can keep living in your bubble telling yourself you're right. 
---
And keep up your reading skills. A+ effort.
---
I don't think uldaman has many differentelementals so are you talking about the red statue guys? It may just be a quirk of that particular mob. Also there are a lot of them at the end boss, they may also be immune to cc becuase of being a boss fight mechanic, not sure.
---
Like all casters, you need Int+Stamina and Spelldamage. So some Warlock t0 is decent for example. Priest Raid sets are for healing, so you cant use those.
---
My favourite moment was the first time killing Lich King in 25 heroic mode as first Guild on the Realm in Wrath of the Lich King, getting The Light of Dawn Title.
---
And we found the tank
---
As a night elf I care about Darnassus :(
---
What I said
---
&gt;	But you're right. What I say is just anecdotal and we need data. Humans are pattern recognition machines and will very often see patterns where there are none. I'll start making an effort to actually collect all my logs from now on.
---
What you said
---
&gt;	It's perfectly normal to have such lucky or unlucky sequences in randomness given a big enough sample size. Because of biases in the human brain you'll notice and remember those sequences far easier than you'll notice their absence.
---
Please don’t repeat me word for word next time. Try to add to the conversation.
---
Yeah exactly this. I’d only have been upset if everyone agreed to greed and you needed it to sell it.
---
How long does one run take?
---
mostly AFK but yes.
---
This is what i needed, thanks alot :)
---
Always presume wowhead is wrong unless proven otherwise.
---
As a very casual retail player previously, I think my favourite moment was clearing Molten Core for the first time on Classic. I've never done that before, and I know it's not really a big deal but it felt great at the time. First time I've seen the Ragnaros cutscene too!
---
There's tonnes to do for the majority of players, just not a lot to do for the people who blitzed through content super quickly. The average player is barely 60 yet. 
---
My guild leader has 27 days /played. \*Of course\* he's running out of things to do.
---
Playing 3vs3 Arena during early Wotlk, trying to get Rank 1. (Ret, RestoShami, Hunter and Ele, HolyP, Hunter, depending on our mood)
---
There's a lot of juicy patterns available in later phases (enchanting). Better to do it now than on the phase release and fight even more people doing it.
---
Your gear&gt;their wallet  I don’t care if you could sell it for a 60% mount, if you need it for gear purposes, it should go to you
---
Is the threat generated static amount all blessings, or could rank 1 Blessing of Might be spammed on yourself between weapon swings to also build some decent threat? Or is this threat generation on worth a global if it's a greater blessing hitting 5+ targets?
---
Ye thats around 8 1/4 hour a day since release.
---
I mean sure, I wanna believe I only spent 4 hours a day too, but I know that there were day where I played \~ 12 hours
---
going with my school friends into RFC the first time
---
What point are you trying to make?
---
Why do you have to be so extreme? Just because there wasn't absolutely 0 world PvP doesn't mean there wasn't a significant and noticeable decrease.
---
Id rather go Engineering than BS. Blacksmithing is almost useless I would say.
---
Mp5 and crit are some of the best stats for healadins
---
Well.. you see... yeah, ok, that's a good reason
---
It's obviously not going to die, but I definitely think it will be ALOT more noticeable in classic compared to vanilla. I'm betting p2 is going to be my absolute favourite phase in classic and the absolute worst for some.
---
Didnt get looted is a lot different than destroyed/deleted
---
To walk through the tunnel, and to get Firewater for raids/selling.
---
A rogue ninja'd (I'd say) the lavishly jeweled ring for the +2 agi. Won against the healing paladin and a mage. DM so it's not the end of the world but he was serious about it ^.-
---
No it doesn't.
---
When I have 20k threat lead on you you won't turn the mob istantly.
---
R7, 8 and 10 armor (old) was added in patch 1.4 (phase 2)  
---
R12 and 13 armor (old) was added in patch 1.4 (phase 2)  
---
R14 weapons (old) were added in patch 1.4 (phase 2)  
---
R14 weapons (old -&gt; new) were updated in patch 1.6 (phase 3)  
---
R7, 8 and 10 armor (new) was *added* (not updated) in patch 1.11  
---
R12 and 13 armor (old -&gt; new) was updated in patch 1.11  
---
Additional R14 weapons were added in patch 1.11  
---
Is what I'm saying.  
---
The logic being that if we're getting the patch 1.11 itemized r12-14 gear now (phase 2) it would make no sense to hold out on r7, 8 and 10 armor until phase 5 just because they were updated differently. It also makes no sense to hold out on the 1.11 rank 14 weapons just because they arrived late and their counterparts will be in starting in p2.
---
Feel free. I'm not there lording myself as this wow god, but if the group would be faster without you than with you, why would I keep you?
---
but the game is so easy now, if you just spend a little time getting semi - ok BIS gear (hell even just buy greens from AH with the correct stats), learn your dps/healing rotation and genereally act nice, there's plently of guilds that will just let you have a spot in their raid group, or raid group nr 2/alt raid. Also most PUGS wont really care and just invite you, some will be dicks about gear checks, but  a lot dont give a fuck. I'd even argued that the tire 0.5 are more time consuming, and harder to get, then just showing  up in MC once a week for a couple of hours.
---
Young as in your experience as a warrior, not individual age maybe
---
I got my HoJ on one of my first anger runs at level 58 \#blessup
---
The difference is that hands of power are best in slot of the mage, but not the warlock.
---
Right.  Force people to grind multiple copies of their characters.
---
I just heat people acting like pickpocket is useful, but I get a chest maybe every 25ish mobs.
---
I'll let you in on a secret, shadowpriests don't need gear for pvp, sure it's better that you do, but the talent tree is so strong becuase it was made to make up for shitty itemization in pve. Switch that over to pvp where hit doesn't matter and Stam and damage mitigation is huge.. well shadowpriest has baked in damage mitigation and a spell for knockback mitigation. It's all good stuff man, the pvp gear rewards work well for shadowpriest.
---
Yeah this guy is talking like everyone is in an APES caliber guild when this group of player is maybe the most refined, ready and skilled guild of WoW Pserv/Classic history.
---
The paladin healers.
---
I equipped Shadowfang and Assassins Blade? (Both BoE from SFK, Fucking stupid first WoW luck) on my rogue.
---
I had no idea what twinks, or even how to use the AH was for that matter up until I got my new warrior leveled.
---
That would’ve been nice money.
---
I'll agree to that. Sometimes it's not bad though, grinding as you wait.
---
I was tanking at 51, respecced back to Arms at 53 cus of this reason alone. People don't let you establish threat.
---
&gt;	However, it’s really important to remember that streaks are expected in random sequences.
---
I’m not *that* mathematically inept. 
---
Why windfury? Why not just combat data? If we know the character’s crit chance then it would essentially be the same and we’d have a lot more data to work with.
---
But you dont know what the warlock is currently using? Could be a worse item? An upgrade is an upgrade, the warlock worked just as much for the drop as the mage and is just as entitled to roll on it?
---
I regretted Rogue from 1-59, the solo leveling experience was hell with it. Post 60? Nope.
---
To date I've never seen a 19 tick. I've not seen video of one either; the last time this issue was on the front page, it was just a bunch of 21 ticks and abilities getting parried and refunding energy.
---
My conjecture is that 21 ticks happen because the server tick is running a little (1/20th of a tick) slow, due to server load and whatnot. A 19 tick would then happen if the server tick was running *fast*, which should never happen.
---
Rather being a dick and tank the dungeons and try to counter the tank sortage problem than being an useless selffish guy who could easily tank his own dungeons but rather take a dps spot and let others do his job.
---
Lol get fucked
---
Sounds weird. Is there any source or some kind of proof you could show us?
---
does that actually need a source reference? how the world has changed
---
Think its 17% but I'm pretty sure boss mobs will always have a 1% chance to resist no matter how much hit you have
---
Once AV is out, you can pick the mobs in the mines for about 10s each and a box \~1/4 of the time. The mobs will respawn their pockets in about the time it takes to do a full circuit of the mines, too.
---
Well, when you get to 60 every DPS is going to be sucking your dick so hard you might pass out from dehydration. 
---
So respect the warrior hustle.
---
I'm a druid so I have it super easy leveling, I just hope I can find a spot with a nice group when I hit 60.
---
And what class is that again?
---
From what you've written here and within the comments, I'd strongly suggest rolling on an RP server.  You seem to have an idea of a "character" rather than just a regular main/alt.  I believe the idea of a blade for hire would go over much more smoothly on the RP servers, rather than the other servers where people are more worried about min/max. 
---
Otherwise it just doesn't really make sense from an efficiency standpoint.
---
Yep, critical piece of info IMO - time between ticks is enough for someone to land 2-3 attacks while you stand there waiting on energy.
---
Nope. Had a healer constantly complain about pulling too many mobs (even though we had 2 mages and he himself was massively over levelled for the dung) kicked him and got a new one instantly. 2nd healer complains that we should skip trash (even though I’m there for XP). Dropped group and joined another one, while they went back to their questing in random parts of the world.
---
what's the point of tier0.5 when everyone who has a guild can raid MC/BWL and probably are doing good in AQ? we can't transmog anyway so ...?
---
Stepping into karazhan for the first time which was also my first step into raiding.
---
Yes I did the same thing after I died completing the Crashing the Wickerman Festival quest :)
---
I love WoW but let's be honest, it's ultimately just a very fun waste of time. A million things you could be rather doing than playing WoW. I'd always wished I had poured all those hours learning a skill instead, like music production, but here I am again addicted to this game...
---
Rogues?
---
You hit the nail on the head. I prefer tanking, it's fun, but its tiring. Some days, when work or life has exhausted me, it's fun to just come home and kill shit.
---
So there are 2 different lines of thinking. Bring more healers for more heals or Bring more DPS to make the fight shorter. When my guild did rag we used 8 heals, 2 tanks, and 28 DPS. Would have used 30 but we were short.  With that comp you should be able to burn down rag before the first set of adds.
---
They arent thats true but thats their advantage over pure dps classes and if you give up you only advantage then dont expect to benefit from it. Thats why I but hybrid dps classes on the bottom of the priority list especially dps warriors. Dps warriors is under ret pals because retpals atleast understands and humble enough to know if he give up his advantage and chose to dps then dont expect the tank to only need on tank items. And this MS&gt;OS bullshut is the reason none tanking the dungeons and you are sitting in 30p ques for a tank or paying 50g/run for those few 1 in 10000 real prot warr main tanks.
---
all that info and all i can think about is how /bonk doesn't work for me in classic lol
---
Those things don't make it a cast. Prime example is Touch of Weakness on a priest. It has a cast animation, it's listed as a cast spell in the combat log, but it is activated when hit. 
---
As /u/kwiknikk said below, they "cast" it part way through KS, there is no way it's an actual cast (unless it's really bugged).
---
What the other guy said, and it's also super useful while leveling. I am currently early 50s, and regret not setting up the macros earlier. It's basically 1-3s per mob, and the occasional healing potion or lockbox. It takes a few minutes setting up the macros, after that it's zero additional effort, so even with the small returns, it's really worth it. I do agree though, the droprates of boxes are horrible.
---
Check out this guide for setting up the macros:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/pickpocketing-classic-wow#useful-macros
---
It's true tho lol
---
Easily get 50+g an hour as a rogue farming felcloth. 
---
Get some decent dungeon gear and a couple of nice daggers you basically 2 shot mobs that drop it.
---
I unsubbed from Tips when he reported Alex to the cops. As toxic as Alex might be, it instantly made me see Tips as the cringe little man that he is.
---
Plus, he knows so little about the game. All he did was make videos with good players and make it look like he knew that.
---
Ron Jeremy's little nephew isn't much better, either.
---
Here https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/550001-053-542300512003151
---
The hype and population of Classic has died down for sure (for now until future stages)
---
However there will always be people playing especially on the big servers, no worries there
---
Or rogues. Or enhancers. Or feral druids. Or hunters.
---
Sunken Temple class quests should be in the game as well. It's kind of pointless to delay lvl 50 class quests.
---
Hey that was me. But I'm an altoholic and my "main" is only 42
---
No it’s very selfish to gatekeep any items because some (in often cases wrong even) list from the internet says it’s BiS. 
---
Part of the game is grinding anyway. RnG is designed so someone who have never done a dungeon before will have the same chance of a drop as someone who is in there for the hundredth time.
---
Upgrade is an upgrade regardless of what is BiS and need is for upgrades. They both put in the same amount of work and they both had the chance at the dice.
---
Meh, at 60 they can pull 10+ dwarf elites to farm.
---
Has to be downing Onyxia for the first time. I remember our guild MT spending forever farming stitches to craft breastplate of the chromatic flight. Everything just felt so challenging and earned when you did it back then.
---
Yeah, this would matter more back in the day when the content wasnt so easy, but people regularly pug this content
---
Not OP, but I'm on my way to 60	and extremely worried about trying to get into a raid group where I actually get any gear. I don't have the time to commit to ANY time slot as I work a rotating shift that rotates every 6 weeks that makes it hard enough, but I also have an SO and other life responsibilities to take care of.
---
Wish there was more end game content like people for me :/. Time played isn't an issue as I still get 10-20 hours a week in if I want.
---
Ret paladins are worse...you need to drink after every fucking mob.
---
that all seems a lot of work whereas you could just roll a rogue and stand there mashing the SS key :P
---
I see very little whining coming from ssolutions.
---
Fury is the Main leveling specc, this is because you gain several active effects that boost damage, attackspeed, rage generation and HP regeneration. All highly useful while leveling solo or as a group.
---
The other specc are good at lvl 60 for various types of content. Prot for raids, arms for PvP.
---
I had a Onyxia fight where I was hit 3 times in a row from her fireballs and still ended up first in the aggro table on phase 3. As a frikking holy paladin with Salvation. Popped bubble and after the 12sec I was still first.
---
I think that conclusively disproves your theory.
---
Is there some kind of fuckery to put curse of recklessness on yourself/allies to have that sweet fear immunity? Debuffs are removed at the end of a duel no?
---
Fucking annoying when they kill named quest mobs lmao
---
I don’t have that problem, so not sure.  Make sure you are not trying to seduce something that is actively taking damage, as the damage could break the seduce.  Also, if you are spamming it, is it possible you are interrupting your own cast, since it has a cast time?
---
16
---
This is how I feel. This time during original vanilla was my all time favorite point in all of wow. Someone not as into pvp who mostly solos is going to hate it
---
Only thing I would add is everyone needs to start agreeing on stuff before leaving town to head to an instance if at all possible.  He assumed (wrongly) a certain speed and he shouldn’t have pushed it once he realized you were going at a different pace.  Having said that, since some want efficiency and some want to smell the roses a bit (I’m more smell the roses), people need to hash it out early.
---
People who can't dedicate a consistent schedule of hours every week?
---
great work ,so many details .
---
My favorite memories were always the expansion launches, running around in a brand new zone flooded with people, and new content.
---
#NoChanges
---
Every system has downsides, but I talked a lot with various people, both in guild and on this reddit, and it's the best I've come up with. Well see how it goes this week (first week of implementation)!
---
One suggestion I'm still thinking about was to include Eye of Divinity and Ancient Petrified Leaf in the Tier 3 Ragnaros/Onyxia loot, because they both give to tier weapons, like those bosses. Ironically, it was a priest who suggested this, not a dps (since a dps, other than a hunter, would obviously benefit from this).
---
I forgot they did the wpl and silithus pvp stuff tbh
---
Betting all my dkp on the drilldisk from garr. God, my 13 year old self was happy back then.
---
Some of the drops from the bosses you have to summon during the questline are absolutely crazy though. For instance, a caster offhand drops from the boss in L Strat which is flat out BIS until the offhand from Twin Emps.
---
Well, at level 60 it's a whole different story of course. At level 60, warriors have the best life imo, they can just choose to tank and get gold for going to instances they need.
---
Warlock
---
Yeah, in the mid 40-s you can just chainpull your way through anything 4-5 levels below you. I had maxed out first aid since like level 38 as well.
---
(Hint: by your mid 40s you want to stop prioritizing spirit and get more agility/strength instead. Your hp pool becomes too high for the regeneration from spirit to be that valuable.)
---
Hey. Some people don't know this so I'll go ahead and mention that - the princess doesn't drop any loot unless someone in the group had previously saved her, and then only they will be able to get her loot. Maybe that's your problem? The gloves are not a very rare drop. Please disregard if you already knew that friend! :)
---
Playing rogue for the first time and finding out stealth made you invisible. I asked nearby players if they could see me.
---
I think it just proof you were snipehealed and didnt trust your fellow healers. Or missclicked fury on.
---
Set 0.5 is an improvement on the dungeon sets you can find in lvl 55-60 dungeons. It requires a lot of quests, dungeoneering and gold to improve all your pieces.
---
With the patch that introduced this there was also an event in EPL that tried to increase WPVP (world PVP. Meaning PVP outside of battlegrounds) Horde or Alliance could dominate EPL opening up questlines and flightpoints while your faction was in control.
---
But since this patch was implemented so late in vanillas timeline these events and quests were hardly ever started let alone finished by most players. People were also much too busy in Silithus trying to complete their ahnQiraj sets. 
---
In short there was just too little time and interest in this event to make it feasible. OP wants this part of the event to be set forward in the timeline so that it might actually be utilized this time.
---
this is caused because shit spellbatching, a 2005 feature made for poor internet connectiones applied to 2019 1gb connections, there you have it
---
World pvp objectives is not a good source of honor, it'll be the same players, so reduced or 0 honor from killing them, and you can't capture the tower if your faction holds it, so it's either win trading or go somewhere else.
---
Were you on Shattered Hand by any chance?
---
It IS easier for anyone to raid now though, especially Molten Core, but other than that I think they're good points.
---
World PvP objectives would be interesting to have *before* battlegrounds this time
---
I remember pretty well from vanilla. Hunters have a base miss% of 5% at even weapon skill to defense and then they gain a flat 1.2% per 5 weapon skill of hit. They should also gain a tad bit of crit too. It didn't ever work the same as melee. Fairly certain on that.
---
congrats to you and the rest of the penis guild.
---
Helping guild mates, farming recipes, and material gathering, can be thrilling content. I understand you are god tier at this game. But make an alt, or maybe go outside lol.
---
Leveled to 60 as an ally without ever setting a foot in STV. It is possible
---
Oh this sounds great! I’m a USAF vet myself so might fit right in, thank you :) I will message you here and try to catch you in-game later this evening.
---
Well, this attitude lets us to ignore the optimal leveling aspect safely and level by doing green quests, slowly but steadily.
---
Weird. They are supposed to be after the honor system. That’s lame.
---
Epic 30 minutes lag of my life
---
The only way you're wrong is if you were leader of the group. Then you could just kick that mage.
---
But sounds like you weren't leader, so no, you're not wrong.
---
Do you even classic?
---
The day I got my last AV mark. Played during TBC, got them before reinforcements were added.
---
Please keep this idea alive. I dont have time to raid and having the quest available at least BWL time would really make my time feel more meaningful since raiding is so far beyond what my schedule allows.
---
DM E is pretty alright
---
you are a young warrior, what ever you were before does not make you an old warrior
---
How can you not get a raid spot when no tank is showing up to raid?
---
I met some of my best friends in TBC by doing a random Kara pug. Still talk to them to this day.
---
It was a group from their guild I was the random tank they didn’t have.
---
Even the people who argue that the monetary value of a BoE outweighs its utility as a gear upgrade say that everybody should need.
---
The advice by Wraithwing81 below is quite solid. Definitely look up the guide he links, you could even search for some others and spend some time outside the game to read up about the class. 
---
Google "Classic Hunter UI", perhaps +beast master, and look up some images to get an idea of what you'd like in terms of UI and setup. If you find something you like but have no idea what addons (getting mine from [curse-forged](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons)) are being used, posting a link to the picture on here usually turns up multiple answers quite quick. You might get an idea of keybinds there as well - but for the most part I think people use the keys 1-5, qertfghzc, all mouse buttons and any of those combined with Ctrl, Shift or Alt. That alone gives you at least 54 keybinds (not counting mouse buttons), which should we easily be sufficient. You don't need to use many macros I believe, but you could look into [this resource](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/hunter-dps-macros-classic-wow) and make keybinds for at least /petattack and /petfollow (I think) in order to have a keybind for your pet to attack a target and to run to you/follow you. That, in addition to skills you use frequently in combat, should be bound to keys that make sense to you and become part of your muscle memory. 
---
And if something doesn't make sense ingame or you don't know how to do something, ask in /1 - usually you'll get a number of troll or sarcastic replies, but there are an awful lot of helpful and decent players out there.
---
I think you will have plenty of time to raid even if you can’t dedicate a set time to it.
---
On my server at least we have constant pugs for onyxia and MC every day.  Assuming you can play for 2-3 hours in a row ( once a week ) you can easily raid.
---
Or join a guild and clear everything in less than 2 hours, it isn’t like 15 years ago anymore here you raid 5 nights a week.
---
I get that it doesn't reset threat completely, it lowers it by a lot though. If your way works out for you then fair enough, just stating facts - it does NOT remove ANY threat for people hit in the fireball AoE so grouping together is completely pointless and just causes extra raid damage. She targets the person with the highest threat, and that person gets their threat lowered, no one else - simple as that.
---
I see, you've been farming sky shadows!
---
6 arcane crystals in 30min? That like 700+ g/h :D
---
My favorite memory is actually staring a new character in classic an remembering all the little details I forgot.
---
I'm on ZT and it's not dead during peak hours. Even at 2am last night few groups running level 60 dungeons.
---
First all of thanks for your tips, really appreciate it! Second of all could you show a talent tree for arms what i could go with? :)
---
3 man should be fine ;)
---
Damn only 700g. I'm pushing 2000 still after getting epic
---
Bring your own healer and then we can talk.
---
You should not spam that button, you should just press it once.
---
Correct, so far almost all of MC bosses are one shotted making the raid around 2 hours unless people slack too much. I'm talking about pugs, not guilds who do it around 1 hour. I reckon the later raids will take much longer(AQ40/Naxx).
---
Party on Gallows end roof Razorgore - EU
---
I have no idea how you keep mages and warlocks around then.
---
That can’t be an unpopular opinion.. ^^
---
gearing alts.  not every guild has the resources to let alts gear up in 40 man raids.  People could just casually improve their alt a bit this way
---
Dont they pay you though?
---
And there are examples of T1 being better than T2, who cares
---
This isn't retail, try pulling that off on your blue geared mage and you're dead.
---
If you're leveling the Xp is your fee. 
---
I'm in almost 100% prebis. I have enchants on most of my gear, I bring consumables on my dollar. The only time I charge is reserving Orbs in strat, skins in scholo,  or if someone offers to buy a tank while I'm doing something else. Ofc most of my runs are primarily guild runs or runs with friends. I dont have a lot of patience for pugs
---
I am an ally rogue currently lvl 34 and I am questing in Thousand Needles atm.
---
Any tips on what I should look out for or zones I should level now?
---
Thanks in advance :)
---
I’m sorry but what is Mp5 referring to?
---
this picture is so cool and high fantasy. Love the Naga coming out of the water in the dark, kind of reminds of the Illidan/Naga Frozen Throne intro.
---
Glad I almost never had experiences like this. Reading this sub makes you think every dungeon run is full of toxic people
---
Yeah...not many people are going to do world bosses to get Nature Resist. There will probably be a handful of extra guilds that clear it than those that did in the original release, but it's still a grind that most won't complete.
---
Fair enough ! Retail is designed for late game, but I guess that's not really why I love warcraft, it felt hollow to me.
---
First, ask the party leader to kick the loser. You're the tank, you choose the pace. A good tank will wait for everyone to be ready, obviously. If the leader is the loser in question and refuses to chill, leave. Fuck em.
---
And why are gnomes KoS?
---
Because any time I saw one, I got attacked. Hitting first is an ingrained response now.
---
The circle of life continues.
---
When you are lvl 60, the only way to make your character get stronger is to get better gear. 
---
The best gear rewards come from the most difficult content which requires a raid of 40 players to enter Molten Core and Onyxia's lair, which requires a big guild because you need to have 40 lvl 55-60 players active at the same moment and it requires players to sit down in front of the game for multiple hours straight. 
---
Many people can't access that, so Blizzard created a decent gear set for each class that doesn't require a raid, but a long and costly quest chain instead.
---
But it's not in the game right now. This gear and quests were released near the end of Vanilla's life just before the first expansion (The Burning Crusade), so at that point, most players either had already better gear from Molten Core/Onyxia/Blackwing Lair/Zul'Gurub/Ahn'Qiraj, or had quit the game because they couldn't access raid content, so no one used the sets.
---
OP is saying Blizzard should release this content NOW instead of at the end of Classic's update cycle when it's almost irrelevant. And I agree.
---
Yes, and that's a valid point, but don't make the argument about it helping with the flight point camping.
---
and there are examples of blues/greens being better than T1
---
Does leveling with a shield and going prot make it an easier time?
---
literally got it my first run before I was even 60
---
Perhaps he wasn't comfortable going faster.
---
Playing as a Warrior. Hit 40 got Mortal Strike. Never used it because it did the same damage as Heroic Strike for twice the cost. Thought that was the dumbest thing ever and didn't use it. Until yesterday. Have played warrior for quite some time now.
---
And then when you summon, half your raid is standing near you ignoring the portal instead of clicking. /rage
---
Understand this: As the tank you are the king of the group. Your word is law. If DPS doesnt respect your wish then leave. If DPS kept pulling trash even after I had told him not to, I would leave 100%.
---
I share your assesment but I would also like to point out, that most Hunters lack the skill and gear to pull off a Princess solo run. 
---
There is also a hotfix incoming which makes mobs hit you multiple times if you fail to kite them. That change should make it so that need to kite flawlessly everytime.
---
It's been tested over on the paladin discord and consistently pulls aggro in MC. I don't know what to tell you.
---
I ran LBRS like a dozen times for hands of power. I fucking LOATHE that dungeon. They finally dropped! The day after, Dire Maul and thus felcloth gloves were announced to be coming much earlier.
---
I completely agree about the PvP part and am not knowledgeable enough to comment on the tier 0.5 issue. 
---
IMO they should cap the amount of progress you can make in BGs during a certain span of time. This way, BGs become the "daily" grind and WPvP becomes the "extra" you do if you didn't get your fill doing BGs.
---
This would also encourage those prone to max their PvP progress from BGs to go out and pillage WPvP locations. As I remember it, it used to be the hardcore people who just grinded BGs to the end of time and some oddballs who didn't know what they were doing (and weren't one of those "feared names" either). The ones best at PvP were the ones you never saw out in the world.
---
Would be much more impactful for both immersion and WPvP if someone popped a message in the defence channel saying "Please send help to Southshore, *THAT* guy is here."
---
So as a feral tank Iv tried quite a few farms (Mara, DM, Strat Live) but recently the best one Iv found is actually the Deadwind Pass Ogres.
---
These Ogres have an absurdly fast spawn rate, very low armor, and do little to no damage to tanks. They Drop 1-3 Runecloth at 50% chance, sometimes Major Mana Potions, and not to mention tons of raw silver that quickly adds up to about 10g an hour in raw gold looted. 
---
Druids are amazing at farming this spot in particular because of stealth, self heals, low armor/soft hitting mobs, and ability to pull large packs with AoE.
---
On average I make about 100g farming this spot for 3-4 hours casually, could be even higher with some intensity.
---
hA wHAt aN iDiOT

^^^/s
---
lol id just find another rogue. you aint special.
---
They claim it was to simulate the internet of the day, but really I think it was done hoping people would find it frustrating and return them to retail where there are all the microtransactions, then they can say they were right all along that "you think you do, but you don't"
---
10-15 gold is not much in the end, I would not sweat this one. That said, for the future:
---
Ideally, in a nice world, gear upgrades should be prioritized over gold - but what do you think happens if a BoE Freezing Band ring drops in a group with one frost mage and 4 other members? The ring is probably worth 400-600 gold, depending on what realm you are playing it might fluctuate further still - as it's a pretty darn great ring for a Frost mage, especially if he/she is ever going to PvP. 
---
But at some point it's just not realistic to assume that people who can't wear (or should not use) an item are going to be nice and won't roll Need on it, since they can probably sell that gear piece to get a BiS item for their own spec - they just see it as added gold. For this reason I've started holding off the item roll until conferring with the group in case something of decent or great value drops; ideally you should establish loot rules such as this before the run starts, but not everyone does that. 
---
Better then to discuss briefly with the group and come to a consensus; often it's best if all roll Need, because it only takes one liar to overthrow a "everyone rolls Greed" agreement and screw over the rest. I'm not a fan of this, but it seems to be the safest choice.
---
this is like a warlock bitching about summoning. its what you do.
---
Trying to swim to moonglade from Org with my druid friend so he could show me how cool it was.
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25354-NeedsFoodBadly.html
---
That's what I use. It will auto generate a macro for you to use that multi functional in and out of combat
---
There is nothing as frustrating as having DPS pulling for you when not asked to. It is the very opposite of "*fun*"
---
If I had pre-raid BIS I would hold out for the tank set piece. You don’t need much hit unless you’re fury-prot.
---
Stealth
---
No it's not ninja looting, it's common sense.
---
Because he didn't want to. He's the tank, he leads the party
---
Gratz, most retarded comment i’ve read this month. The game is 15 years old with content phases they announced well on time, you literally knew there was no point in rushing smh. Ive got 26 days played, but i still log on every day for some daily chores and most importantly to be social with friends/guildies/world. If you want a washlist of things you HAVE to do daily, then install retail and play that while in content draught.
---
How would one go about figuring out where to invest gold? I played awhile back when I was a kid but I didn’t pay attention like that to the market. I just feel like rn im sitting on gold that could be potentially growing but I let it sit. Im a 45 orc w 250g atm. I just have no confidence in my knowledge of the market so I don’t want to invest till I feel fairly confident that it will be worth.
---
yes
---
but warlocks are bit screwed, as the destruction tree has no + hit talents and your main damage spells like shadow bolt and shadowburn are destruction. So for warlocks it is very hard to reach hitcap.  (It can be done, but you need stuff like Nefarions Tear from BWL, a weapon from AQ40 and Naxx and lots of stuff from aq40-naxx.  )  If you have +10% hit from gear you are doing good.
---
I agree with pretty much all or all of this. And like I said, if the tanks's taking everything into account correctly, dps should be following the priority order, it's there for a reason.
---
I'm a tank first, now trying out a rogue, so sometimes I see things that the tank missed that I wouldn't have, so I see problems before they happen. It's totally possible the tank has a different solution in mind to deal with them that I don't realize, but I'd rather stop problems I can see before they happen than follow a kill priority order.
---
Ignoring the tanks plan is the exception, not the rule. For some tanks, I've made exceptions for most of the instance.
---
Given that you've previously rolled a head, the chance of getting a head in the current roll is 50%.
---
Given that you've previously rolled a tail, the change of getting a head in the current roll is 50%.
---
Prior to doing the previous roll, your chance of getting two heads in a row is 25%.
---
But, once you've done the previous roll, whatever you got in the previous roll can be forgotten about. Your chance of getting a head in the next roll is 50%.
---
Got that out of a random mob in Silithus 15 years ago, I was very pleased; it wasn't referenced anywhere back then.
---
And as usual, the lone feral druid gets screwed over.
---
I cannot fathom why these are held back when the likes of Rhokdelar is in game. Ooh my class gets a staff (maybe if you can be arsed) that lasts a few levels/voidwalker item, big deal, ruins the BIS hunter weapon for sure. The notion they are "catch up" items is ridiculous.
---
Your guildlead has no idea about classic tanking I guess.  
---
Onslaught is BiS for Tank warrior.
---
I don’t think you did anything wrong. The mage should chill, especially since you said something about him pulling too much. What dungeon were you running? I understand moving too slowly being annoying in an easy, albeit, time-consuming dungeon. But at the same time I’m so sick of this AOE trend. I’m tired of mages trying to blizzard down a pack of two mobs. I’m sick and tired of them telling me I need to pull more so they see more numbers on their screen so they can spam DPS meters during the fight. I’m tired of all of it. So believe me when I say I get where you’re coming from. That said, I usually endure 3 or so wipes before I start considering leaving the group.
---
Not at all. I was tanking SM and there was this incredibly annoying shadowpriest who kept trying to mind control mobs and then got mad when they were getting hit after it wore off. Once they used it on the marked target we were focusing I just left.
---
He master looted.  Since I can't stealth I had to avoid the initial Hydras and I stood right at the entrance to the cave with the first pack of Dimetradons.  It was a balancing act to not pull aggro and I think had I done it at a slightly lower level (was 52) we would have needed to kill some trash.  He went on to kill princess then looted me the ring.
---
Maybe he's not comfortable with a higher speed. That should be enough.
---
&gt; damage *could* break the seduce
---
Any damage breaks Seduction, unlike Fear.
---
Lol that you guys downvoted me.  Have an updoot.  I dont disagreee with the tank making the pace or being the puller, was just suggesting a QOL improvement of more communication.  If, after said communication, the mage doesn’t want to play, bye mage,
---
Just talk with them about it. I mean afterall you are still all rolling for it. It is not like you are Lootcouncil and just giving it to yourself over the others.
---
it is still a fair roll
---
It is an exploit. Only private servers bullshit differenciated between the two.
---
Gnomes (like undead on the horde side) are the race with the best PvP racials, so the people who intend to gank lowbies gravitate towards them.
---
Clearly.  Quick chat ahead of time may improve this.  May not.  Ymmv
---
If you are an alchemist buying rare transmute recipies is a good investment imho.
---
Contents nowadays is easy enough to be PUGged. In the old days PUG MC runs didnt start until late late vanilla, now PUG raid groups are an everyday occurence.
---
10m ZG raids will be PUGged right from the start, giving non-raiders a raid to do, if only just a couple of bosses. They do 10m UBRS already after all.
---
Not gonna last. You can already tell from the fact that most pugs don't kill Rag (some do but I think its safe to say most don't) that BWL won't regularly be pugged (I am still +1 pugging every week so I would love to be wrong about this).
---
I just don't get why every tank basically needs a ready check between trash pulls that take 10 seconds to kill.  Holy fuck just pull the next one why did the mage have time to drink to full then start pulling mobs.
---
Just grab the next pack no one's asking you to cure cancer
---
I'd rather shoot myself than switch to mobile.
---
&gt;priests not specced to reduce threat
---
Nobody is spending point there while leveling my friend.
---
Jesus, that's a lot of played leveling.
---
7. Be an unemployed loser that lives with parents 
---
Lol
---
This BS was for private servers.
---
If Blizz get enough proofs and report it BANS. A friend got banned for It.
---
Only if there are caster druids in the group and only 1 Paladin
---
i wouldt say died down is the right term to use but the queues arent that long anymore
---
EPL should have been active from the get-go, it's not very good at the best of times but at least while the bulk of people are active in that zone, that's a good time to enable it. It's bizarre some of the choices even if it does accurately reflect the timeline of release.
---
&gt; Assuming correct drop chance, it is more probable that he will get the item before you.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy
---
You came to a thread that it is discussing the logical progression of items in the game and proceeds to ask the question “who cares?”. As stupid as they make ‘em
---
Why can't you find more hours somewhere? If you have only 15 minutes of alone free time your life sucks. You must be prioritizing other hobbies, having 5 kids, no wife and a 60h job, and require lots of sleep.
---
"Item dropping at least once in 1000 runs" is a different event to "item dropping at least once in 1 run"
---
Each run of the instance is - in your words - an isolated bubble. All previous runs are independent and irrelevant.
---
In dungeons roll on whatever you want. In raids, you should probably content yourself with getting the loot after the dps warriors. IIRC onslaught is really good for tanking as well...but keeping your buddies happy so they show up every week is important too.
---
You get defaulted tank gear, even though dps warriors could use it for off tanking, so they would be pretty miffed to have you get dps gear too before them...even if it's good for tanking too.
---
Staff of the Shadowflame is good for healers, but they shouldn't roll on it till all the dps casters get it for instance.
---
Too bad it breaks after 2 attacks
---
And what you do as a normal human is ask politely first so you aren't interrupting my banker, mailbox, or auction house window out of nowhere.
---
Being a rude asshole isn't funny once you get out of high school. You'll just be an asshole with no one that wants you around.
---
It’s easier than ever to find decent pugs, you definitely don’t need much time or a guild to raid in this phase
---
You need the hitcap for yellows. You don’t want to miss your first shieldbash
---
&gt; he pulls it he can tank it.
---
hahahah classic :D
---
Tank: "you pull it you tank it"
---
Dps: "pulls and tanks it"
---
tank: "Wtf he didnt stop pulling now I'm mad so better leave group"
---
:D
---
If 1 mob resists just sheep it, if 2 resists it s hard, if you have cold snap do it asap and cast a second nova.
---
Nope.  People need to shut the fuck up and get over themselves.
---
It's insane that people complain about world pvp yet roll on pvp servers. I thought that was the entire point? Anyway, OP is totally right that battlegrounds kill world pvp. I really enjoy BGs more than raiding, but it's arguably even more of a grind than raiding ever is, so there's a downside that it heavily incentives grinding. I agree with OP that they shouldn't do everything necessarily in the same order as it was originally, as it wasn't always effective. But remember that having tons of objective-based things to do is part of what made Retail such a bore and a chore to play.
---
People who complain about PVP in a game called Warcraft will never be happy.
---
It's like playing a flight simulator and complaining about the presence of planes.
---
Look at what top players of your realm are doing (content wise), look up what people might want for upcoming PvP releases, and make some informed decisions. 
---
If you're sitting on 250g at 45 you clearly aren't doing bad to begin with.
---
I don't mind the 0.5 tier items themselves, but the questline that you have to complete in order to obtain the items involve being able to summon certain bosses in dungeons. Now, some of the loot from these bosses is absolutely crazy, especially if it was released during BWL. At least that's my opinion on it.
---
15 agi is phase 2 25 is phase 5
---
But you do feel like a special snowflake it seems.
---
People aren't. They're just upset that sometimes a tick for 19 energy comes through instead of 20. I've had it happen on both my rogue and druid. At least it's broken I'm both places.
---
Dont hyperbole it :P
---
Our guild still takes 6h for MC spread over two days. And yes, we're a very casual raid guild. PUG mc doesn't consist of hardcore raiders, so they're not going to finish MC in 2h. Trash and raid composition, people leaving/joining, loot discussions also cost a lot of time.
---
Yep, consider this the #nochanges, Classic experience. 
---
Flaws and all. *grumble*
---
Not every guild rips through raids in an hour. Let us know how you're making out when BWL, AQ and Naxx are out
---
Apparently according to some redditors because the Iron Boot Flask for warriors is OP the class quests should not be released until way later... even though the rewards for the other 7 classes are not that great at 60
---
My rule is: I write All Need on BoE Items. Then I need/pass when BoE drops. Even if a partymember needs it, you can still trade inside the group. But at least everyone could roll this way.
---
Well, you want to do dungeons at 60 don't you? YOU. NEED. US! ;)
---
Running BG Premades and completely decimating our opponents!
---
Lmao the first name on the list "Davinci" is one of the players I dislike the most on the server lol, the guy is just rude and greedy. Reaction: NOTHING, not surprised.
---
That sounds pretty risky lol I’m lvl 60 with max alch/herb and epic mount and 5 raid epics 😅
---
I'll tank for free, and I won't take drops, just because your idea is stupid and you should feel bad, everyone with the mental capacity of a grapefruit or greater has now been made dumber from both your post and this very comment.
---
Good day to you.
---
Is baron cape better than rsg cape for hunters?
---
Its every day. When i enter to play classic :P
---
My favorite wow memory is aoe grinding with my irl friend as prot pally and mage in Western plaguelands during burning crusade. We noticed a dwarf hunter named "Gloink" a few levels lower than us just killing 1 mob at a time. We didn't think much of it. After awhile we got tired and logged for the night. We got up the next morning and noticed gloink was still there... 8 hrs later farming. We also noticed he had gained about 4-5 levels since we logged off! We sat trying to figure out how that was possible when all of a sudden we see him accidently pull and elite from the nearby mobs. We thought for sure he was toast. All of a sudden he begins channeling something... And BOOM hits the mob for over half it's hp!! We freaked out "dude that hunter just shot chain lightning wtf???" I don't know what it was about that but we laughed for probably an hour. From that day on our guild MoTD in bc was "Gloink shot lightning" (we did end up googling later and discovering it was gnomish deathray of course but it was still hilarious to us and a great memory)
---
shitty weapon goes to shitty spec
---
I dont see the problem xD
---
if he takes Thunderfury then theres a problem
---
In all honesty, sounds like classic isn't your thing, try DOTA.
---
Unpopular opinion?  I think this is a great idea.  By the time BWL comes out, I’ll probably be decked out in MC gear.  Why would I collect the advanced dungeon set?  I’d be working on them now if I could.
---
I dont have the time I had 15 years ago either. My guildies took 2 and a bit weeks to get to 60 at launch.
---
It was just a joke.
---
Nah he's probably the same guy that think only rogues should get locked chests.
---
Need&gt;Greed. Equip&gt;AH.
---
Yep. He provided math which didn't support his statement. Gambler's fallacy at work.
---
The trinket at Exalted seems neat.
---
One of the excellent ones indeed then!
---
I do think that there's a large scale minor personality difference (not every healer, but healers as a group are less outspoken and more conflict adverse) between healers and tanks, and that if you proactively (in pm) let them know you are open to feedback about the speed, you will get more of it in a positive way and will lead to additional healer love.
---
Oh hell yeah. Awesome explanation tbh. I will infact be going for this armor since my dreams of Lionheart and Might/Valor are looking pretty bleak. Hope it gets released. Thanks again!
---
Some of the gear you can obtain from the bosses you have to summon during the questline (and can freely summon afterwards) drops some loot that definitely is better than pre-raid BiS, at least for casters.
---
Priests are the only class with defensive magic dispel on Horde side so you need a handful of them for fights like Lucifron.
---
Even old men can be young warriors :)
---
In my experience you never get shunted for asking and following.
---
The only way you get people angry is, if you don't listen or say they are wrong (when you are clearly the one guy who has no clue about the boss/dungeon/route/mechanic). However, from your post you seem more of a reflected kind of person so just ask questions and follow the leader.
---
Maybe, havent played since cata so wouldn't know :)
---
Lot of stuff you gotta think about before a pull, from marking targets, to making sure the healer has enough mana. That’s why tanks set the pace, some can do this faster than others but it all has to be done.
---
Yeah, no such luck. I like where your head's at, though
---
How about the loot from the bosses you have to summon throughout the questline? Some of them are flat out ridiculous for casters and easily trumps pre-raid BiS (and some of them aren't replaceable until AQ40).
---
Even with BGs there was and still will be world pvp over resources and farming spots, or even things like raids fighting eachother on the way to BRM etc. Flying definitely killed that aspect of world pvp.
---
It says he got less than 100... 79 to be exact.
---
My bad, turns out 15, no clue why I thought I had 20
---
Didnt downvote anything, but communication is slightly pointless since tank pace is the reasonable default xD
---
Im all about hotkeys but comeon, is it that hard to just open your bag and right click?
---
I don't expect anyone to play "slow". 
---
Professions, dungeons and guilds **are** all content. Raids are not the only content nor are they the only relevant content. If one simply ignores all the other content it's not Blizzards fault.
---
Reddit is a small part of the WoW Classic community. And it's a part of the community that is so engaged that it wants to see daily content of the game. There are many, **many** players who are more casual than even me. 
---
The players that are bored of the raid content already are a tiny minority. That's all I'm saying. Nobody has to play the way I do, but if you rush through everything and ignore content left and right, don't expect Blizzard to cater to you.
---
The thing you're not considering is that you wouldn't be sitting idly doing nothing waiting for your turn to taunt. You'd passively generate considerable threat from your damage abilities, same as every tank. What holds prot paladins back is no one button to considerably increase threat. Their only option for decently high threat output was an 8 second consecration.
---
You see, druids don't even need to land.  
---
Fly up, throw Moonbeam and Insect Swarm, turn into bird, fly up again.  
---
Repeat ad infinum :)
---
lmao
---
there are already over hundred of changes xD
---
\#yeschanges
---
I'm still not convinced rogue isn't just as slow all things considered. Severe weapon drought between BFD and RFD, undesirable for instance groups,hard to find armour that every other physical dps wants, not enough agi to get much dodge chance while levelinh, DWing miss chance
---
Wars arent without problems too, dont have an instant attack for half the game, limited escape methods, but they have the benefit of having much better mitigation, very little or no gear competition for plate  while still being able to use leather and mail, very desirable in dungeons, access to a ton of 2h weapons which aren't very contested.
---
&gt;and consistently pulls aggro in MC. 
---
After how much time into the fight? Because every fight is pretty short in MC.
---
A lot of people, myself included, don't like adhering to raid schedules. I prefer huge guilds that basically do in-house PuGs of tier 2 content.
---
I'm a mage, honestly this breaks my heart so if you're a shaman trying to get loot from this dude just whisper a mage to boost you through for the love of god please. I'd do it for free honestly, since the guard would die like two times faster. maximizing gph.
---
RPing In Goldshire In TBC, it was always so busy back then :(
---
Just tell them that they have a few options: Kick the mage, find a new tank, or the mage can grow up and stop pulling.
---
i don’t have the exact answer you’re looking for, but i slightly recall playing an Arc raiding mage back in BC
---
This works on most classes, especially at that level. It’s infuriating when you’ve got half a bar of health left and they’re at 2% and suddenly they turn into a raid boss and your weapon skill drops to 3. 
---
Happens more often than coincidence should allow for.
---
My name was flippynips, a rick and Morty character,  i had to change it because the easily offended got upset
---
&gt;Clearly he isn't saying this makes Paladin the most effective in every single boss, like those who specifically require taunt
---
This is exactly what he's saying when he sayis that spamming BoK works exactly as a taunt.
---
And he's wrong.
---
If you are focusing your damage properly and use only Frost skills, all fleeing mobs are already slowed. In that case you can just cast yet another Frostbolt and that guy will die in time.

---
Apes aren't refined, they are a bunch of pikies.
---
IF you can solo the ogre guy in the arena in front of Dire Maul he dropped it quite frequently for me in Vanilla. I used to solo him as a frost mage and sell it on the AH for a good chunk.
---
So hunters are not allowed to roll on orbs is what you are saying?
---
warrior trinket is insanely good. Phase 5 is a bit late, but phase 1 is definitely too early.
---
I agree. The tier quests were fascinating (I know that, because I helped a rogue friend do some of his) but ultimately pretty redundant.
---
You're playing phase 1 with 1.12 talents and items so...  it's not Vanilla yet you're still playing? I mean it's why I can't take this #nochanges seriously. The game is way easier than it was it doesn't seems to trouble anyone who spammed this tag for months but suggest any minor change and the game would be broken...
---
And yes, they probably won't change it and maybe useless to discuss it but then... just don't talk about it if you don't like the subject? why do you post dozen of messages in this thread and whine about people discussing it?
---
Classic is NOT about objective based things to do. It's more about the freedom, the vibe, the community.
---
I can understand why it’s frustrating especially since you need a whole new gear set to DPS respectably for a raid. My advice would be to find a decent guild and join expecting to DPS but let them know you’re interested in being a OT as well maybe one week you can fill in for one of the usual OT that can’t make it and go from there.
---
So the tank is playing like shit and wasting everyone's time because he feels like it?  You put tanks on some pedestal for some reason.  Tanks can be just as dogshit as any other role and people should call them on it.  I've got dozens of tanks marked so I never group with them again. They're rarely so bad that I leave the group but you sure as fuck won't be getting my god tier healing again.
---
versatility+utility
---
99% of ppl playing my class are noobs so it's easy to shine
---
I see the issue now :) You are doing Rotgrip the hard way aren't you? By "hard way" I mean you pull him up to the bridge with Doom, wait for him to come up there and then cast new Doom and jump to water after few casts once he gets up to you? I used to have issues with this method as well.  
---
Now I don't even need VW for Rotgrip and he rarely hits me the way I do it. Pulling is very similar (Doom from the bridge, usually can do also Immorale and Corruption before he gets too far), but I don't wait for him on the brigde. I wait at the cascades above tinker (the middle cascade). There I do the 2nd Doom, immolate+corrupt and run towards princess refreshing the corruption (and Siphon if SM specced). Rotgrip dies +- in the area near the giants on the way to princess. The only fuckup that can happen is if he takes a hydra with him (I would say 30% of my 150 kills) and you are not careful enough. But it's still pretty doable, at least with my universal SM/ruin build that includes curse of exhaustion (exactly for this hydra to get the space to kill Rotgrip first without any trouble with the hydra).    
---
At Princess, I think I don't understand your VW argument with VW dying. Only purpose of VW is to bait the AOE so she stops moving and casts for a few secs. Once she starts the cast you put VW back on follow or sac for shield if VW is about to die. If you are DS specced, you Demonic Sacrafice VW for hp regen after you bait the AOE once or twice. Or as DS you can even go completely without VW and use HS to heal up once she gets to you and does that multihit for 60% of your hp. VW is not supposed to permanently tank it or something.    
---
For fresh 60's SM ruin is definately safer build to run for Maraudon farm. Spell power difference between SM and DS is only 5% (SM = 10% vs. DS = 15%) and also while DS you more likely use VW for DS to get the passive hp regen instead of succ for shadow dmg. So that turns the tables in favor of SM (for Mara solo farming).  
---
PS: If any solofarm for locks is gear dependant, it's DM east, not Maraudon bosses :)
---
My favorite WoW memory was probably downing Nef for the first time, then that same night watching the George video where I saw for the first time what a fury warrior was capable of on that fight.
---
Good point. I totally ignored that fact because I am never around for the loot distribution. By that time we are already clearing Ragnaros trash. I'll ask our loot master tomorrow on how that works.
---
oh right, with t0.5 rogues only need 4 pieces for the good set bonus. Yeah, 4 t0.5 + BWL raid gear is surely gonna be BiS in phase 3 then.
---
The theory crafting that would come from this will definitely be interesting.
---
What box? I can't see it. Oh, that little thing?
---
I second Skarmtank - I'm not much for YT guides in general, but this guy hands out the facts and doesn't go for extra viewers by trying to be overly funny, cringy or stupid as so many people with a YT channel or twitch stream do. 
---
I'll just also point out that the Fury/Prot build he advocates in many videos is NOT suitable for entry-level gear, ideally you'll want some BWL gear and better mixed in for it to work properly. Skarm also touches on this point, but wanted to put it out there to cement it further.
---
I've done this once, got insulted while helping out, I don't do that kind of groups. I prefer to play non toxic and in no rush, if that's not your playstyle I'm not your tank ^^
---
About the PvP part:
---
The PvP "Honor" system (which is literally just a PvP kill point system) isn't in the game yet.
---
"New" content is going to be released in "phases", and wich each phase comes new dungons, new items and also PvP objectives. ([see this for more info](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-six-content-phases))
---
Have you seen the red instance portals in arathi highlands and alterac mountains which  you can't enter and say "you have to be lvl X or more to enter" even if you're way above that threshold? Those are PvP Battlegrounds which aren't in the game yet. Lots of PvP objectives are inside those.
---
Near the end of the game's development cycle, Blizzard released PvP objectives that don't happen in the Battlegrounds, but outside in the world, but they were irrelevant since it was better to just hop in a battleground and do PvP questing there.
---
OP is saying they should release the world PvP content right now while it's still relevant instead of at the end of the phases.
---
&gt; What holds prot paladins back is no one button to considerably increase threat.
---
Paladins have no button that puts them straight on top of aggro table. And that's exactly what's required in some fights.
---
Having a competitive threat generation doesn't help when you have to tank swap at a certain exact moment.
---
Honestly, where? I got mining and herbing and on my server every time i've tried Un'Goro I found like one mineral per idk, half and hour maybe? Literally nothing, so I just dropped for herbing so I can herb in DM-E
---
&gt; NO CHANGES  
---
&gt;EXCEPT THE CHANGES WE LARGELY AGREE ON    
---
pathetic
---
Yes it was very small. Yeah I dont sit on reddit everyday like you so I didnt think about posting it until now. And its not cropped, its alt Z. And it did get attention. Just look my even worse screenshot i uploaded some days ago. If you dont like old screenshots, just downvote my post. Karma farmer, I have 2k in over 1 year. Then im the först farmer in the world rofl
---
I think my favorite memories would be one) back when my guild was running MC we got into a 40v40 battle on the chain in Blackrock Mountain. It was just chaos. The priests on both sides were just mind controlling people off the chain into the lava below while everyone fought to stay on the center. I don't even remember who won the fight or how we did in the raid. This was the highlight of the night. Two) was clearing karazhan for the first time. With a smaller raid it was just me and 9 very close friends at the time so it felt like more of an achievement cause some of us weren't very good. It wasn't a team of all-stars to say the least. Good times though.
---
Getting the "Immortal" title
---
What other epic gear is easily available?
---
People who can only play an hour here or there and don't have time to be raiding can still progess if 0.5 was out, but are stuck with not much to do without it.
---
This advice is pretty golden. Have my upvote!
---
11 here and 58
---
He's on a RP realm and there are rules, that's why
---
I like how you try to make it sound like there's a lot to do and all you could come up with is marks and checking the healers mana lol....  if that's taking longer than 5 seconds I have to wonder what's wrong with the tanks brain
---
For me, it's the huge change in needed tanks from dungeoning to raiding. Everyone is constantly needing a tank for dungeons, but I don't think I ever see anyone saying they are needing a tank for MC or Ony, they already got the couple they need before they started posting in LFG
---
Seems pretty hard to be a casual tank, because you basically have to have a guild group or start the group yourself.
---
I’d always assumed that 0.5 came before MC
---
That just it. He didn’t tank them he would pull them ice block leaving me to pick up the pieces.
---
Nah you kinda lost me there.  In an mmo, particularly classic, communication is never pointless.  There is no doubt tank has the leverage but geez, make a minor attempt to chat it up.  Funny thing is, I tend to agree with the tank and was just adding on a point.
---
You sound like you need to reroll or play a different game dude
---
I lost it to a healer in my first run at lvl 52 who didnt care that it was bis for me at 60 and only MC belt is better and for him it would be replaced very fast.... I still dont have it and with 50+ arena kills i am starting to give up on it
---
Tell me more about this Engi Better Tank please, i'm curious.
---
For Alchemy i got hooked by that potion that makes you immune at fear charm poly, don't remember the name, but please again, tell me more.
---
Shadow priest has entered chat
---
Yeah, some of the trinkets are insane for certain classes. The hunter one is 150 AP and 2% hit for 20 seconds (2 min cd).
---
this is just obnoxiously wrong
---
What? I thought these were 100% drop rate? I think I've seen them 5 or 6 times in a row.
---
Supposedly he drops a nice felt hat or something but I don't believe it.
---
meeting my wife in the barrens :)
---
Yeah and the priest t2 legs we have in classic are just insane compared to the original classic numbers until 1.10 or what. Other items may be the same...
---
They honestly should have kicked the mage, inv warrior and another dps.
---
Is there a point to + mining skill enchantment? You don't increase your chances of getting crystals or anything by being above 300, right? The only point, I'm assuming, is to get over a bit of a hump in some of the ~20-40 zones where the nodes are too low to give you experience but you can't mine the next one up yet.
---
hoots in oomkin
---
When I joined WoW for Wrath of the Lich King, I rolled a prot paladin and was having a good time.
---
So 12 years later I thought why not start like that again.
---
By level 21 I thought screw this and levelled a hunter to 60, now I'm back on the paladin!
---
Many classes don't even wear t1 because it's already worse than the stuff that you can get from dungeons. The only classes that care about T1 are: Hunter, Rogue, Holy Priest and Tank Warriors.
---
Of course I am talking about T1 compared to pre-raid BiS here, whoever doesn't care to farm pre-raid BiS might obviously benefit from T1.
---
no, he’s apparently a fREELANCE GRAPHIC DESIGNER even though the thumbnail for his video looks like it was made by someone in elementary school.
---
Lay freezing trap outside of taming range, autoshot mob at near max range, concussive shot mob, then hit tame. Gives you maximum time for the tame, and tags the mob to you.
---
Yeah Im not going to lie, I just bought a Krol, partially because its an epic, partially because I didnt even realise Sword of Zeal existed but mostly because that sword looks cool AF.
---
Welp, back into BRD I go.
---
One question to ask yourself about this is: Do you have your own computer to play on? As he might be very happy that you play WoW but maybe not so much if it's to the expense of his own play time.
---
https://youtu.be/wz8REXvemKc
---
Honestly we've been having a lot of issues with the phase 3 transition so if you have any ideas of what we can do to fix it please share :P
---
This would imply that you're skilling mining forever and never hit the cap.
---
Why do random people need to take your previous actions into account?  Especially if they already capped mining and your arguments start to get invalid.
---
I.E. mining a rich thorium node means you share the chance of an arcanite crystall and this one is more worth than a skillup.
---
You do it either in deep conviction or leave it be, but don't start praising the "right way" to play the game.
---
0.5^20 × 0.5 = 0.521 ?  
---
You're going to have to explain this to me.  
---
Landing heads 1 time is 50%.  
---
Landing heads 2 times in a row is (50%)^2.  
---
Landing heads n times in a row is (50%)^n.  
---
So far we're on the same page. So landing heands 20 times in a row has a probability of 50%^20 , which is 0.000095%, this algorithm doesn't change for the 21st throw. You cannot honestly sit there with a straight face and tell me that throwing 21 coins and having them all land on one face is extremely **improbable**
---
How the fuck are you finding thorium nodes at 6PM?
---
Mainly Cloth and the Icy enchant.
---
My favorite wow memory was showing up to gruuls lair as enhancement on my shaman one raid night back in BC when I was always resto and the raid leader being impressed with my performance and letting me be the raid team’s token enhancement shaman for the remainder of the expansion.
---
I’m only asking for the guild vault to be added. Guilds are already in Classic.
---
Finally grinding out and completing everything to have every enchantment in the game. Weeks of rep grinding, running AQ 20 and 40 and Ulduar every reset, finding all the rare world drop enchants. Just the feeling of sitting in trade chat saying that I have that to any enchant people could ask for and every twink I made I didn't have to ask around for enchanters.
---
This is the true big brain tip wtf
---
lul
---
I levelled up to 55 as Shadow and then switched to Holy.  Healed all the way with no struggle.   I didn't even downrank any spells for dungeons so I'm not sure what the problem could be.
---
Could you get the Recount addon and have a look at your amount of overheals?   Are you spamming Greater Heal when a Heal / Renew could suffice?
---
That’s not a chat.  Pertinent point: my suggestion of a chat was before things got rolling so it could actually be a quick convo of “so are we steamrolling?  Waiting for markers?  How’s this gonna work?”  Once people are already pissed at each other, good luck.  At that point I understand where people just roll with the “in the tank, gtfo” speech.
---
From the bosses you have to kill to do the quest line.  Some of it was pretty ok.
---
All the other group members were a guild. The healer had already started making excuses for the mages shitty behaviour. I would have bailed as well
---
He clearly said rouges, not rogues
---
Oh man when im tanking and some priest use Mind Control i usually clap and praise his control, he is able to take one mob and keep healing at the same time, good dps and is very helpful to the party, so i use raid marks and everything go fine, the tipical priest healers are really boring and dont very skilled.
---
How is that the tank's problem?
---
What offhand should you pair with the mace? I’m leveling and have the 50 armor / 1% shadow proc skull
---
Where does most of the gold you make from tribute runs come from? 
---
I guess you need enchanting to disenchant useless BoP items. Otherwise your profits would probably be lower, right?
---
Then you try to sell items from the chest to other players. So you need some time to find buyers, negotiate, get them to the chest etc.
---
Finally you can probably sell some of the potions from the chest. Did I miss anything?
---
Yeah kinda sounds like you are a prick
---
There was a post yesterday with this video: https://youtu.be/q9bR4HFwfzY?t=120  
---
The strat they use is the MT and OT stack up on each other in p2, and they get targeted with every single fireball.  The idea this guild is working with is that if the Fireball (not the splash) hits multiple people, the threat wipe/lowering doesn't appear to happen.
---
My favorite WoW Memory was getting the Immortal title with the Black Proto Drake. It is still one of my fondest accomplishments. I still sometimes get random whispers where I got the mount from :).
---
Getting my level 40 mount.
---
I didn't realise that was a cone/arc ability - thought it was simply AoE. Thanks for the tip!
---
I tanked all the way to 60 and have been healing and tanking at 60.  The only reason a mage would ever be able to pull mobs with me tanking is if he's pulling while oom or he's pulling while the healer is oom and if the healer is oom and the mage isn't I really have to wonder what the healer is doing wrong.   Once the casters sit and the healer is over 50% I'm pulling.
---
Also remember that spells have a travel time.
---
I abuse that when tanking as Feral, so I can get a nice, long, slow Starfire in, then buffer Bear Form. It's like pulling with a gun, but better.
---
My favorite memory is first time stepping in Mulgore , best zone ever
---
The best part about being a tank (or healer, to a lesser extent) is groups need you more than you need them.
---
Fear!
---
"Mana per 5 seconds"
---
then you are arrogant or just new to dungeon farming at 60.
---
&gt; I don't think threat was ever really the problem with Paladin tanks in raids. If anything it's their only strength.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The downside is taking more damage than Warriors while still being susceptible to crushing blows and critical strikes. Druids make it work because they have significantly more armor and health than Warriors, which makes them better offtanks, while Warriors are better main tanks.
---
&gt; I think Paladins work in dungeons. But raids are another story. Blizzard went out of their way to make sure Paladin tanks don't work in raids. If you bust your ass, you could take an offtank spot in a guild that doesn't have a Feral, but you would just flat out be better as a Warrior or a Druid.
---
Paladins can tank raids.
---
Rolling a BE pally in TBC with my buddy at the time. We leveled all the way to 70 as holy/prot with only dungeons. The reactions we would get from hordies not used to AoE tanking when we pulled half the instance in one go and tanked/healed it all down was priceless.
---
Gotta make sure that lighting is right.
---
Furies are far far better tanks than protective for dungeons if well equipped. That most ppl dk that yet
---
Getting my first boe epic in Vanilla. Staff of Jordan.  I immediately equipped it.  Selling wasn't even on my mind back then.
---
You‘re all wrong. Pepsi is best. Especially the one with the Extra-Citrus taste. I do enjoy Vanilla Cole to be fair - but here in germany it‘s rare to find the original taste, just sugar free variants cuz people are to dumb to watch their health.
---
Pushing is definitely offsetting, sometimes you get orderly teams that make the time enjoyable, rogues and mages that cc when necessary with out ewen telling em, group following kill order, or some good guild groups that just need tank. 
---
But often you get groups where single target DPS with nukes that for some god awfull reasons have increased threat (thanks Blizz) dpsing the one unmarked target, mages that have only blizzard,frost nova cone of cold and arcane blast on their actionbars, or mages that have the instinct of aoe nuking accidental puls before you have the chance to get to them (and not that they would kite em away so you have time to deal with the not yet dead pull) 
---
While leveling there are a lot of dungeons you don't need a serious tank you might go with kiting or melee DPS warriors or shamans tanking. But the chaos often makes the experience more stressful then necessary. 
---
You'd rather just chill as a DPS validating yourself on a simple DPS meter.
---
Tanking is not hard it just takes a lot of patience
---
Nah, it’s not any slower. Get a good arena/anger/golem group and you can do 5 runs per hour.
---
&gt; No, but no one wants to carry you, either. If you want to be in a raid where the other 39 people are putting in effort and playing to the best of their abilities, then you have to play to the best of your abilities.
---
Using the word "carry" in a 15 year old game, never thought Id ever see that.
---
Thank you !
---
You made the right decision leaving early. I’ve been in your situation and I can say for sure you made the right call. I mentioned earlier that I will endure 3 or so wipes before I even think about leaving a group. I ran ZF once with a mage with the same mentality. Loved to pull mobs as the group was finishing off the previous pack of mobs. I’m like to think I’m a pretty chill guy, I don’t rage that hard in a video game, our healer is good and we don’t wipe at all, so I don’t say anything. We get to the pyramid portion, and the mage pulls EVERYTHING. We wipe, NPCs die, and the run is completely fucked. I basically lived through the future of what you run would’ve been.
---
Can you fail mining like you can fail at picking herbs? It might lower that chance if so.
---
damn, sounds pretty good then. thanks for explaining.
---
I was wondering if casting a holy light on yourself would get you a good ammount of aggro too, but i dont think so
---
Princess already hits you multiple times, she has thrash, and thrash is like herioc strike, it queues up to be used on the next melee hit, so if you kite her she will eventually queue the ability, and then if she connects a melee hit it will count. Whats more interesting is that it also seems that either multple can queue or that it can also proc off itself... its got some weird observed mechanics.
---
Honor points =/= ranking points.
---
Very short: Every week players are ranked by honor gained. Then they get sorted into brackets, with the top bracket containing only very few players and the bottom brackets holding the majority. Each bracket corresponds to a fixed value of ranking points (RP). You start with zero RP, every week your current RP decays by a percentage of its current value, and you gain RP based on the ranking bracket you ended up in. Each honor rank corresponds to a certain RP value. 
---
Even if you consistently end up in the top bracket for honor points, it will take multiple months to accumulate enough RP to make rank 14.
---
I think I'd disagree. Only one person needs to know where they are going. And tanks need to be the ones the know...how to tank. If you don't know the mobs or packs, pull back and los, fave enemies away, adapt to which targets a glass cannons and target. Just be attentive if you aren't familiar with the dungeon and it comes together pretty quickly, be aware of your surroundings and you won't have issues with pulls.
---
And no, I don't see how it in any way falls on the tank to kniw all the quests. If someone wants one dine they'll tell you
---
No, you made money. They just paid you for the items.
---
The key part is keep undercutting until they run out of money.  If you have more stock than they have gold, their attempt to reset the market at a higher price fails.
---
It's not an unpopular opinion, you just almost hit the nail on the head - t0.5 is too powerful compared to MC/Onyxia and also fairly impossible to get right now (45 min stratholme runs will destroy 95% of people trying to do it). However, it is precisely at the power level of BWL and is similar to ZG gear in catching up/pvp, so it is PRECISELY perfect at phase 4. Or phase 5, to be done while war effort is on. 
---
PvP objectives sure, but they never really mattered.
---
Who master loots deadmines lol
---
You don't need the don't raid. If you can raid MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 you don't need tier 0.5. It'd be best put in now, so if you don't raid you're not too far behind the raiders.
---
I cant believe this mage, it's funny that his nova got resisted though
---
Onyxia's fireball is not a normal player one.  It is cast at a target, but it ends up hitting the ground where that target was standing when the cast finished.  It's possible to only take the splash damage from the spell, even if you were the target for it during the cast.
---
So Pally only raids can be a thing?
---
If you want their first born child it’s yours. If they ever question you take their wives too. That is what it means to be a king.
---
Plenty
---
The possibility of the item dropping never changes. It's drop rate is the same for every instance and assuming otherwise is what gambler's fallacy is.  
---
The probability that it drops in 1001 runs is higher than the probability that it drops in 1 run. They are different things.
---
I get what your saying, but its already two months in, and Im falling behind in a big way.
---
If I want any chance at getting into a guild and raiding than I have to perform better than the other 100 Rogues waiting to take my spot at a moments notice.
---
If Im not consistently pushing top 5, then whats the point of even bringing me?
---
Kormok, Jarien and Sothos, Mor Grayhoof, Isalien, and Lord Valthalak all have loot tables beyond their need to be summoned and killed as part of the t0.5 quests.
---
Yup you can either tolerate the "playing like shit" tank or you can wait another hour for one.
---
It's an antiseptic for warriors to make them want to wash their hands of the class.
---
No? It follows the target and always hits the target
---
&gt;All the other group members were a guild. The healer had already started making excuses for the mages shitty behaviour.
---
Or being genuinely puzzled over his guildie's behavior and trying to keep the group from collapsing. I don't know about you, but I sure didn't know how decent everyone was (as a player and / or person) in the leveling guild I joined on my way to 60 - surely there are some bad apples in every guild, let alone leveling guild, no? I also facepalmed over the behavior of some of the DPS players in my guild when I was healing semi guild/semi pug runs. I did however tell them to stop acting up.

Onslaught is BiS basically forever for fury so yeah.  I understand that it’s a really good threat piece but hit rating is so damn hard to find.

Yeah the helmet fucked up my looks lol

It's https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18421/backwood-helm
---
Still not as bad a bug as absorb shields negating melee crits entirely.
---
Why is it better though? Absolute noob here
---
It's not a case of hopelessness at all.  I played launch-pandaria, but I'm older and wiser(?) now.  I know how much time I want to devote to WoW, and I am in a guild mostly of in-game friends from back in the day.  At level 39 I am second-highest level in the guild.  We are all in it for the social aspect, and taking things slow and just enjoying the ride.  There are lots of things I could do if I dumped my friends, upped my play-time and went for it.  But that's not why I play, so as I say, raiding is never going to happen.  I know that in WoW, for me, the levelling experience is better than the end game experience, so I'm setting my pace so that I can do things like read quest text, help lower level guild friends, explore the world again and just not care.

&gt; I guarantee that if you were to "LF1M Prot Paladin for MC" you would only find trash players. Good players understand the limitations of their class. They don't show up to raids trying to tank on a Paladin.
---
What's hilarious is that it's the complete opposite. People who show up to raid as a paladin tank have to put in an insane amount of work compared to prot warriors. Only good players can make raid paladin tank a thing.
---
People are just bigger assholes now than they were 15 years ago, because everyone is entitled and has way too many tools to fuck each other up vis-a-vis censorship for toxicity, racism and whatever
---
Its because blizzard likes mages better.
---
Does Wrath get extra threat from Bear Form?
---
I use Wrath as a ranged pull, then pop Bear Form while it flies (spells have travel time) to the target, akin to Warriors who shot things, but with more damage.
---
And this stops the assholery the poster experienced how?  Literally does nothing for two 60s coming and killing a mob in 3 secs...
---
I maxed frost resistance on my pet, not sure if that had anything to do with it :P
---
But yeah, super satisfying xD specially when he was being a dick, was just minding my own business.
---
MC/Onxy will be farmed well throughout the game until nax and also then, as people will always be willing to run PUGs - pservers had active MC/Ony pugs while Naxx was on farm and t3 was common.
---
Not having dishonorable kills !
---
The worst part is seeing that Blizzard has some ridiculous cap like 20-30 mobs, if that cap even still exists anymore, and I'm assuming all their other aoes are the same.  
---
Meanwhile all our AoE skills are limited to small numbers like we could even tank enough mobs in xp range in melee range to abuse it half as well as Blizzard.
---
Happens with hunter Feign Death too, not that it resists but it just doesn’t seem to work sometimes.
---
For hybrid classes and for those who PvP, tier 0.5 is better than MC gear due to better itemisation. E.g. Arms warrior would do well with tier 0.5 currently.
---
Yes you can
---
I have a Warlock main and wanted to point this out.
---
Cat would have it, then bear loses it, then cat has it again.  (every other shift)
---
It's very easy to see with "Leader of the pack" and power cycling cat.
---
If you use the normal power cycle macro,
---
    #showtooltip Cat form
---
    /cancelform
---
    /use Cat Form
---
 and spam it. Then every time you hit the macro.
---
Leader of the Pack will toggle.  so that you only have the buff every other cycle.
---
(Same thing happens to Predatory Strikes but it takes a ton of testing to prove it.)
---
If you manually cancel the aura 
---
    /cancelaura Predatory Strikes
---
    /cancelaura Leader of the Pack
---
Then both will be up every cycle.
---
Swing and a miss. I said *I think* it’s a fundamental flaw with whatever RNG they used then said it may be bias and we need more data. Reading comprehension. Kinda difficult sometimes, isn’t it?
---
This sub is just a cesspool of negativity. 
---
I loved like 99% of interactions I had in classic, but reading this sub makes it seem like everyone is toxic, ninja looter, elitist or an asshole in some way. In fact negative experiences were so rare I remember them all because they stand out so much.
---
Uh oh
---
There will be - it's one of the most common epic boes.  Be patient and buy it with your gold.
---
I thought when you fought a hunter as a mage, the first thing you did was polymorph the pet?
---
&gt;  most of the farming spot I know (essences, herbs, etc) are over farmed during pick hours (which is when I play)
---
I got some bad news for you, Champ.
---
Anyone else had self heals fail as ‘immune’? I’ve noticed several times my shaman is healing during a fight and the spell finishes with no affect. Last night it happened for two casts in a row and I caught the ‘immune’ text over my portrait. I was under no visible debuf and pretty sure the last one I was out of combat. Do heals have a low percent chance to fail?
---
Yep can confirm my best is about 25 except for the rare occasion you get some good drops like travelers backpacks or something
---
Wait.... what??
---
I thought I did, but i REALLY did
---
&gt; lol crushing blows and crits are a 2005 meme. only trash guilds gear for defense.
---
&gt; paladins are shitty because of trash single target threat and no taunt.
---
&gt; i dont understand why ppl like you still feel the need to comment on stuff you clearly know nothing about. sorry for the toxicity but it's true. mess of misinformation on this sub
---
lol threat and taunt is a 2005 meme. 
---
Learn to leap frog threat and properly cause threat (gbok spam, consumes, etc...)
---
P.S. I find it hilarious that the person who think they're informed are still not completely informed yet.
---
&gt;  Or enhancers. Or feral druids.
---
What are those?
---
The only perk of playing a tank is that you get to make the rules. Just make your own group and let everyone know, you won't have any issues.
---
It was just a joke
---
It is.
---
Herioc strike adds damage to your auto attacks mortal strike is an attack you do in between your auto attacks.
---
thx man, I will try this as soon as I hit 60... next year lol :D
---
Different strokes for different folks
---
I think you should go back to school.
---
I completed MC in a pug week 2 in about 3 hours. Pugs now are easily doing it between 2 and 3 hours.
---
It's definitely possible for them to.  But if I was an enhancement shaman I wouldn't hesitate to heal probably up to RFK or maybe SM library if a group was advertising for a healer.  After that you have to keep too many bag slots with int gear and it gets annoying.
---
&gt;There's lots of examples where T0.5 is better than T1 and T2. In some cases T0.5 outclasses the epic pvp armors like it does for the ele/resto shaman pvp spec.
---
this was pretty usual in vanilla. At least many or even MOST didn't raid on the highest raid tier. Or they limited themselve to ZG or alike (i know that's raiding too, but still).
---
The idea that almost every player does raids was introduced after bc.
---
I played very long and was VERY serious about my gearing before I even entered a raid. I very long did not join one of the 2-4 available proper raid guilds on the server and therefore only entered first tier raids or karazhan in BC. Only when I changed the guild I managed to make progress through Sunwell in BC, but this is how it often was.
---
A lot of players were serious in end game gearing but their reach was not the same, so they decided themselve what their endgame is.
---
And?
---
Wrong twice.
---
I'm on the fence about leveling warrior as an alt, sounds like a thing I need
---
Yes I was!!
---
Looks like the rare PvP gear is p5 or p6 as well. Way late IMO
---
How so?
---
Where in any section of my comment did I remotely suggest that it would have been the tank's problem?
---
It's just, you know, a nice thing to do, listening to the one other player (apart from the tank) that tries to keep things from going south when shit like this happens. Just leaving the group without even saying a word to the healer or replying something along the lines of "if you replace the mage or keep him in check I'll come back" would be a nice gesture *in an MMORPG with social interactions and a community* \- just leaving without any communication at all is the one thing I would have done differently.
---
ALL HAIL
---
Unless you’re on one of the free transfer ghost town servers this isn’t reliable income. Any and all felcloth dropping mob areas are jam packed with chinese botters, just like vanilla.
---
Shadow Wrath gear for Speists a good example.
---
It doesnt really bother me though. Some slots BIS should be easier to get. It was the same in TBC, Orb of Soulhunter was BIS right up until I think Sunwell when haste changed to affect dots.
---
76 runs until i saw/got my hands. I got them before omokk pants. LBRS just hates me. It took ~15 extra omokk/voone runs for the pants.
---
&gt; This would imply that you're skilling mining forever and never hit the cap.
---
You aren't going out of your way to mine Iron and Mithril nodes for gold per hour.
---
You're either grinding for specific raw materials to another profession or trying to level up mining for its own sake.
---
&gt;rich thorium node
---
I never said precious nodes were included, I said specifically somewhere that they weren't and max level players were never who I was talking about.
---
&gt;You do it either in deep conviction or leave it be, but don't start praising the "right way" to play the game.
---
What? We can discuss game theory academically and in economics but actual games? Nah. That's just too much.
---
Oh shit yea that's way better
---
Hasn't been my experience, it's always 30 minutes trying to find a group where no one else needs it, with people constantly dropping, asking about also doing xyz other bosses. Then you go, and one or two people leave, etc etc. 
---
Massive hassle, slow and inefficient vs a 6 minute reset 2 rogue run. Plus you get to split the blues among 2 people so that's 15-30g an hour there.
---
He's soooooo mad haha
---
but yeah that shit also happened to me in my time farming those beasts. There's a good reason why I dropped skinner
---
I'm a wow virgin and rolled a warrior as my first toon. It was such a massive realization that I should be fighting mobs way lower than me (or get fucked). Then I rolled a hunter, and now I'm glad I didn't do it the other way around or I might have quit before lvl 30 on the warr
---
Right, my understanding is that the extra attacks proc extra attacks etc etc. So even though the procs are few, theres an increased chance of hitting a string which contributes more overall dps the longer a fight goes.
---
Also, how are you measuring your proc rate? I ask because Details isnt giving any info on extra attacks that I can see, just registering them as white hits.
---
No way. Too expensive. Waste of arcanite. Considering there are these free alternatives or a weapon chain + better gloves, stronghold aren’t close to mandatory.
---
Staying up until 3-4 AM everyday during the summers in high school playing with my buddies and talking on ventrillo. Not a care in the world except WoW
---
Don't forget to give away your gold before you quit. Peace.
---
You need WAY more upvotes for the effort. 
---
The quality is beautiful. The mouse key is beautiful. Your taskbar is a load of shit. Your fingernails are beautiful. 
---
Yeah.
---
If you didn't leave, they would likely never think about them doing something wrongly. 
---
I'd as a healer would leave a group if they act up like that. Almost did it yesterday in ZF
---
People watch streamers clear it in 2h and then brain fat into thinking they themselves can clear it that fast just as easily. Some people base their entire experience of the game on how a streamer played it and if they aren't doing it that way then they are failures in their own eyes.
---
The difference is that boes have roughly the same value to everyone, this is also known as the market price.  Whereas the value of BoPs can differ substantially from player to player and any reasonable person can recognise this which is why they press greed on BoPs they won't use.
---
Thanks for posting, 
---
I get the #nochanges thing but I always assumed it was mainly for gameplay and over all world design / accessibility or loot philosophy. 
---
When I started reading that people want literally the same game without ANY changes I had to scratch my head in wonder. This wasn't even possible from the start as the build used for Classic is derived from Legion (iirc) and not a rebuild from Vanilla. 
---
Why not fix some bugs, why not give some form of QoL a chance which were obvious shit decisions even back then?
---
No one's talking about a massive overhaul, but stuff like a slight reduction in respec-costs, auction house fixes or like OPs example, a better release schedule for some stuff wouldn't hurt anyone but some stubborn people not wanting a change for the sake of no change.
---
I get it, people have lost faith in Blizzard, rightfully so, just look at retail WoW or other recent stuff they fucked up and as soon as you change something what's stopping them from altering more? 
---
I guess we can't have this certainty but I'd risk it for a better overall experience, this is obviously just my 2 cents.
---
I believe that neither stance here is completely wrong, nor right.
---
I honestly don't know what it is about mage players. Last mage I had problems with would start AoEing 3 seconds into a pull and then complain when I couldn't hold aggro. Now, I don't mind if you want to cast blizzard and then kite the mobs while the other dps help you beat them down, but they don't use blizzard. They run into the middle of the pack, cast cone of cold into spamming arcane explosions then expect to survive. They're actually braindead.
---
15 bucks, little man, put that shit in my hand.

If that money doesn't show then you owe me owe me owe.

Like I said I'll usually finish the run just like I'd finish the run with a dps who's doing absolute jokes amounts of damage but they're never grouping with me again after that.  I'm not trying to be a dick I just don't want to spend 2 hours in a no wipe ubrs run lol.
---
I've joined groups seen the tank is on my list and left it's no big deal I also have a list of good tanks and most are willing to tank for me because they know it'll be a quick smooth run.
---
* end fight at full health and low mana
---
* tap a few times to even them out for faster recovery
---
* eat/drink at the same time thinking you did the ultimate big brain move
---
* get healed to full
---
* sit there wondering if you should just stand up and tap orkeep drinking until mana is full
---
makes for an interesting game in between pulls because mages always give out less food than water.
---
Nope. Left groups for similar reasons. Like a rogue that refused to ever attack the marked mob even when told to, took chests without rolling, and pulled a boss when I told them to wait because my rage ability needed another 10 seconds. The healer guildie of his said the same thing yours did. Screw them.
---
Imo thrash blade is better than assassination blade.
---
40 dungeons are definitely a spike in difficulty from the 30 dungeons. That in combination with you not being heal spec and most tanks not being tank spec means you will need to drink after most pulls to be safe. Try to get the last hit on mobs to get the spirit regen. I would reccomend sticking shadow to get important quests out of the way before switching back to holy for dungeons. Buy drinks from mages when you log in if you know you will be on longer than an hour or so.
---
No, you are wrong.  Watch this video: https://youtu.be/RMIMsfpa2nk?t=176  You will see Ony cast a fireball at Vim, and you can see Vim move away after the cast and the fireball hits an empty area.
---
If you're serious about ranking, then you're for sure killing any opposing faction that is green to you for maximum honour and top brackets. World PvP won't be dead as rankers will be farming high lvl flight paths and node farmers. 
---
I do think agree with you though and they should release them next phase.
---
I don't have the talent where blizzard slows... Should maybe respec to that
---
I used to have this problem all the time. At 60 I dont get complained about pace as much, both because I tend to set a pretty decent pace (in my mind) and because I tend to skip pug groups. 
---
While leveling though, I would definitely LoS groups for safety and go slightly slower than necessary to ensure we didnt wipe, and mages in particular would lose their shit because I wasnt pulling 5 mobs at a time. I was also well ahead of the "average" leveling curve, so most of these people were the ones who considered themselves "cutting edge" and yet were still 3-4 weeks behind MC first clear.
---
I googled the proc rate. I’m not saying thrash blade is bad, it’s good. I’m saying it’s not as good as Sword of Zeal or Krol blade.
---
it's 25,  been using it like crazy.
---
When you attempt to humble brag, but the simple math contradicts your entire brag....
---
Shadowbolts crit fucking hard...
---
Well you're an exemption. Most people don't have tank friends readily available.
---
Four Horsemen Naxx

#nochanges FAILED. There have been many, many changes. Hundreds, if not thousands of changes compared to vanilla wow back in 04. While we're on the topic of changes, add dungeon finder already. Game is sooooo boring without dungeon finder or BGs. Level 60! Time to farm leathers and help my level 40 friends through dungeons.
---
Why would you open a fight with shadow bolt?
---
Been there, done that. I once accidently ninja'd some crappy healing pants in strath UD cause I got overly excited about the damn Baron Cloak finally dropping lol
---
No changes.
---
No, fuck em
---
Ok, that’s reassuring! This is my first character on Wow ever so I’m still learning all that stuff
---
But he's not tho.  You can say he is wrong, but he isn't.  Maybe go read why Blizzard keeps making rhe same mistakes over and over and over and over and then come back and explain it to us because we're all fucking clueless.
---
Or ticks pooling (at least for my cat). I use Shred teice, go down to 4 energy. Waiting, waiting, nothing... and then i'm at 44 energy the tick after the next one
---
The people who were doing MC as early as week 2 were hardcore people. I can guarantee you that most pugs right now aren't clearing MC in 3 hours.
---
Not at all. I had a rogue repeatedly do this to me so I bubble and hearthed out as they were wiping.    
---
The abusive whispers were most amusing.    
---
The tank sets the pace though they should obviously take the healers opinion into account.
---
I'm a noob as well, but have been leveling a warrior in classic (so I think this is correct?). 
---
Mortal Strike lets you place a hit immediately, whereas Heroic Strike is dependent on when you swing next. For warriors, big 2H axes that swing slow are common. Waiting for the next strike could be like 2.5 seconds and a mob could get a few more hits in. 
---
I also like to use Mortal Strike kinda like an instant Execute so I don't have to dump all my range on 1 mob before moving on to the next one.
---
You wont make much money with LW either way. That salt shaker CD is a steady income, though.
---
You no take candle.
---
if you can find rend or even full run groups with no other skinners its GOOD money. Depending on your server the black dragonscale alone is damn good money.
---
My favorite WoW memory was probably when I got Thunderfury. On retail. On a level 90 rogue...
---
Not very impressive. But still cool to me!
---
Alright man... firstly this is a game, and nobody needs anything from the game other than a good time with friends.
---
First thing you want to do is get in their dead zone then kill the pet.
---
oh yeah, i think youre right.
---
Its hard to spot on first sight, but the highlight of classic azshara has the shape of retail azshara.
---
Mine is killing mythic blackhand as tank, hand was shaking to the core.
---
Spy shows 21 at 0:38 in the video. The list displayed is in included in that number, not excluded.
---
Me and my friend are duo leveling warrior and priest. lvl 12 atm and we have a small problem: I (the priest) can't heal without pulling aggro (groups of 2-5 mobs).
---
Are we doing anything wrong or is this normal in this level bracket? He even got a +3 strength +3agility green drop weapon. 
---
I'm not even using my wand or other spells because of this.
---
Just stop chiming in at this point.

Identify people with the shiniest gear in a major city, look up their guild name and ask them about their raid progression - or just follow recruitment messages in /trade to see how many raid bosses certain guilds are downing. If someone does full raid clears (very likely at this point) you can bet many more casual guilds are still progressing those same raids. Look up what kinds of consumables and crafting mats each class would want for a given raid tier. Farm or snipe said mats and sell for profit. Now look up the following raid tier and see if there's something special that's going to be in demand in the future - buy en masse now for a reasonable price, sell later for a profit. That's more long-term, though.

I’ve never played warlock endgame (currently 55) but maybe they’re ruin spec for raiding so shadowbolt might be their highest damage spell
---
Its not catch up gear.
---
If i were in your shoes I would simply defer to any DPS up front.  So if anyone else needs I would pass, and scoop up any items that would otherwise be greed to everyone else.
---
First time I was killed by a defias pillager. That was the start of a great journey of anger through westfall
---
how hard is it to type
---
/w %t "Hi, can you open this box for me, ty."
---
I've thought about rerolling as a Priest since healers are more scarce than dps's. And then once/if I hit 60, respeccing as Shadow because I've heard good things about it.  
---
What would you think of such a plan ?
---
&gt; Is it more probable to get it in the runs near that median ? Yes.
---
not sure what you mean, but as written, the answer is no
---
they are not
---
Welcome to feral druid town.
---
When you were arms, were you spamming sunder armor as your primary attack?
---
If the tank has to "keep things from going south", that's a problem that he has to solve. Why would he voluntarily keep going with a group that's ok with a mage like that?
---
And he didn't leave "without any communication at all". He told the mage to stop being a jackass, then left when said mage didn't.
---
I feel like regardless of what spec you go into, spirit tap and wand spec are borderline mandatory leveling talents.
---
It’s deadmines, not Onyxia......... I’ve literally never seen anyone deserve loot in deadmines. Just seems kind of unnecessary imo.
---
Warrior leveling feels great in the low 40s. You've got your 31pt talent and as Alliance to get the Bonebiter quest reward from SM.
---
Well, then classic probably isn't the right game for you, dungeon finder was one of the first steps towards a lesser sense of community, no thanks.
---
That's a very good point. Keeping the morale of the raid group up is important, more important than gear.
---
Only real point of disagreement is that its not necessarily true I'll get it before BWL. I remember back in BC, I had to do arena to get the gladiator shield, because I didn't even see a shield drop before Illidan, nearly a year later. But in the end, this doesn't matter.
---
Got both hands of power and skyshroud leggings on my first lrbs run as a mage.  Sry.
---
Do you play a werlock? You open with shadowbolt unless you’re specced for immolate
---
Right?  fuck'em all :D
---
Stat weights are what most BiS lists are based off. I’ve seen a few lists that take into account having or not having certain items I.e. for sets or being at hit cap but most, especially in this phase, are purely stat weights.
---
Perhaps :p Perhaps I am Lorde Ya Ya Ya
---
I think I'll go with thick hide for now, until I see a need to do something different.
---
For AE threat, my biggest problem is that the Mobs get frost nova'd and cone of cold before the LOS pull even makes it to me, or even gets stacked up, so I'm stuck running to each mob in a line trying to maul each one, before the single mage finishes blinking to blizzard position :-(
---
I'm not worried about Open World. When our alliance characters failed to hang on Herod, we moved to PvE server rather than move to  a Majority alliance PvP server so that we could still pretend we had PvP skills in open world.
---
Tauren Hunter in vanilla, in the Barrens, telling my irl mates about the super expensive green I found on a plainstalker and that it sold for 1 silver. I thought I was rich af. Huntard.
---
Drop drain life from this equation, at low levels tapping and a quick drink is better.. otherwise it's a waste of mana. I would corrupton, agony, wand, immolate, shadowbolt (this is also a waste of mana) recorruption, wand... drain soul.. should be dead. For mutil mobs, really VW with aoe taunt is ok but not gonna hold aggro off of full dots unless you spec into improved VW. Fear and kite is your best bet.. use range to your advantage
---
Friends and guildies are not the same.  I don't know about you, but I sure didn't know how decent everyone was (as a player and / or person) in the leveling guild I joined when I was still low level and neither did I do dungeons with every one of them - surely there are some bad apples in every guild, let alone leveling guild, no? I also facepalmed over the behavior of some of the DPS players in my guild when I was healing semi guild/semi pug runs. I did however tell them to stop acting up. 
---
No need to ignore (let alone spite) the one guy who probably just tries to keep the group from collapsing, and who probably gets at least as much shit daily in dungeons as a tank does while trying to keep people alive through countless mistakes that seem to happen every run.
---
Yeah. Kind of busy with job/wife/kids. I can sneak away 15 min in the morning while waiting for coffee and some weekend mornings if I wake up super early
---
I did a random MC pug raid a week ago and we spent nearly 2 hours inside without killing a single boss.
---
&gt;Blizzard will not change this and they have said the won't do changes to make the game easier for noobs ***or push content faster for the nolifers.***
---
You mean like releasing Dire Maul ahead of phase 2?
---
Thanks so much for the helpful info - it’s definitely cost me one or two deaths. I’ll dig in and see if there’s some modifier to only target humanoids or the like. Guess any hunter/warlock pets would just be on their own
---
If you want your vw to hold threat longer, dont start out with hard damage like immolate. My rotation is
---
CoA (or other curse) + Pet attack. 
---
Corruption
---
Wand or life drain/lifetap ad needed
---
Eventually you'll still pull threat. If they still have a good chunk of health, throw an immolate and drain tank, or if you have the space, fear and wand or life drain as needed. 
---
Pretty soon, or even now you can ditch the vw and use succubus just for the extra damage and initial threat. At 60, this is what I do
---
CoA and pet attack, and wait until pet is engaged. 
---
Siphon Life (normally this or the ticks rip threat)
---
Fear (immolate if chunky healthpool)
---
Then wand or life drain when they get snagged on something. They'll more likely die before the fear is up.
---
I'm far from hardcore I'm just not shit at the game.  I've never had anyone except a butt hurt tank complain about the pace I tell the tank to go at.  Most of the tanks are happy with it too but have been tried by dogshit healers to take forver
---
&gt;furies
---
OwO
---
I only started in 2015 during late Warlords. Doesn't seem like much now, but killing Archimonde the first time in a guild team felt pretty good coming from where we started as barely more than a semi-organized PUG.
---
The glitch is still there, it just happens less.
---
It works slightly different then when it resists. Basically, the game sometimes doesnt register that you feigned.
---
&gt;Lol def not faction changes.
---
Yep. Imagine all your friends changing faction, and there you stand on your Shaman/Paladin...........
---
That depends on the server. Sure, Ony pugs are super common, but on Fairbanks-A, MC pugs aren't. There are maybe 2-3 per week, tops, and they probably don't go all the way through.
---
It helps when you're running between packs.  But yes on boss fights most are over in less than a minute.
---
Most of the gold comes from vendoring the high-value BoP items, disenchanting the low-value BoP items if you have enchanting, and typing a quick /1 WTS Tarnished elven ring, 30g (for example), 20g for stealthers.  
---
If you sell it to a stealther, you can just run out like normal as the stealther makes his way to the chest, so you lose barely no time, and you can trade him as you pass him on the way.  
---
You can also escort casters if the staff drops, or tanks for the lodestone/cloak etc. On Firemaw the items go for 30g each, and you can give discounts if they want to buy multiple items.  
---
The potions in the chest are also quite valuable, a stack of 5 major mana potions go from 7-10g, and you make up quite a lot of them as you farm tribute. Healing potions are also decent money.  
---
At this point after dire maul launch the class books have started to lose a lot of value, but you can get some gold from them as well.   
---
Rule of thumb is to not spend more than a minute looking for a buyer. If no one responds after a minute, just loot yourself and run out.
---
MAGES ARE THE NEW HUNTS
---
Age is but a number. Deputy Willem could be a 5,000 year old half-elf for all we know.
---
I would argue this is not an unpopular opinion. The 0.5 sets coming earlier in phase 2 make total sense. The world PVP objectives, not sure how early they should come out but phase 5 seems silly.
---
It's true I can't argue with that but I don't need the tank to be good I just need him to run into the mobs faster.
---
I think you're right.
---
Mages are the new hunters, and I tend to no longer invite either to my parties.
---
Stop digging your own hole
---
Force Reactive Disc
---
I'm kinda new to the game, and i aoe when there's 3+ mobs, some druid told me about the aoe threat (I still don't understand it completely) however, i'm always looking to improve and i listen to anybody. However, i always poly or focus marked targets, i don' t even have addons so i don't really care about dps, i care about helping my teammates and not feeling useless.
---
Misleading. Mobs that are coded to pull together don't leash separately. Mobs in the world that pull due to random proximity will leash back if you only hit one. As a warrior though, you'd be tanking the others while trying to leash
---
Because ironforge and sw are bs to attack and conviniently have no easy access unguarded back doors like the horde cities do.
---
Just trying to get to 6%, which is damn important regardless of your spec. Right now I have two hit rings, hit ranged weapon, and then I'm getting 1% from mail boots and 2% from leather helm (Mask of the Unforgiven). Problem is, that drops my armor by around 600 or so. Manageable at this stage, but I'd really like to be hit capped in plate. But I don't need Onslaught girdle for that. I'll just keep farming UBRS for the wrists and belt there.
---
because soul stones are hard, just below diamonds on Mohs sale.
---
There are talents for giving you x% manareg in that 5 sec window
---
You can see in the video that if you speak to Kromcrush after king is dead BEFORE pickig up king of diremaul buff - an extra item appears in the chest. I also figured it out after 10+ runs :p
---
&gt; I even messaged the upset member that left and offered 10g to them to return to the group.
---
Don't get bullied into giving things to those people. Nobody should whine for a 10g-worth low level item, especially if that's an upgrade that you will equip.
---
Great idea!
---
The reason you know it's Ret pally loot is that it doesn't drop in a raid
---
That brings it's own set of problems. I have rarely used that spell without adding at least one mob into the mix.
---
As an extra satisfaction i got to kill the mage again when i respawned :D -  https://streamable.com/1d49v
---
I was wondering why there was a spirit healer there, which is why i was next to it in the beginning (was showing a friend).
---
&gt; If you toss a coin 999 times and all of those times it's been heads, statistics tell you with fairly certain accuracy, that the next toss will be a tail. The chances again, are still 50/50, nothing changes for the 1000th toss.
---
This is contradictory. If the coin is a fair coin, nothing about those 999 previous trials gives you any information about the next toss.
---
If the coin is not a fair coin (or not known to be a fair coin), then after 999 heads you have a lot of confidence that it's weighted to heads, so the next toss becomes increasingly likely to be a head (not a tail).
---
If you sat at the start of a run of 999 and said what are the chances you'd get 999 heads in a row, you'd calculate some very small number. If you calculated the probability of getting 999 heads in a row followed by another head, you'd find that it had exactly the same probability has getting 999 heads in a row followed by a tail (in both cases its 0.5^1000). You can tell from this that, given that you've rolled 999 heads in a row, your next roll has equal probability of being a head or a tail.
---
&gt; If you toss a coin 999 times and all of those times it's been heads, statistics tell you with fairly certain accuracy, that the next toss will be a tail.
---
Absolutely not, if we accept that it's a fair coin
---
If the mage is ready to go everyone should be ready to go.  Mages have the largest downtime.
---
They just dont seek to realise how long it takes to drink in Classic. I just let them die sometimes. I can baby sitting. They'll learn.
---
So either it's the tank or healers fault. I'm done arguing with you. It's clear your opinions are set in stone. Enjoy your flawless WoW classic experience lol gotta lie on the internet.
---
Flying didn't kill player versus player. Players killed player versus player.
---
Yeah in all my years of playing a warlock I have never and will never soulstone some random dude for a buff lmao. Only on rezzers in dungeon groups and myself otherwise.
---
Just be sure you poke holes in the jar's lid so the baby can breathe.
---
I think it's a lot more fun to get the shit kicked out of you with friends than it is with randoms, haha.
---
The attitude of the party is all that matters I guess. We wiped three times from silly mistakes in WC last night, but it was no big deal because everyone was really upbeat about it. It's when people get pissy that it starts being annoying.
---
Mages are a dime a dozen. Holy pallies are not. If they are that petty, we will replace em in a second
---
Start small. Start with rune cloth. Observe the prices, and I mean literally write down (or use an add on) the prices. I've made probably around 200g just from buying low and selling high. I buy any stack of 20 that is under 1.3g and resell for 1.7g to 1
---
5g. 
---
I chose runecloth because I felt like it was a pretty sustainable method.
---
sighs in Ele sham
---
I have. I buy all my spells despite the guide telling me otherwise.
---
lmfao, I went onto wowhead to check the item stats and I see [this](https://i.imgur.com/Rk6uhMP.png) lol
---
Sneaking out of school to attend my servers AQ Opening event
---
So, I don't know about guild lead (you're likely right), but I am the raid lead of my group, and the main tank, and yes, I am aware that Onslaught is BiS for me. That's the dilemma here, is that it's BiS for me and BiS for dps warriors. Most people have been saying that since I have other options that are fairly decent, while dps warriors do not have those options, that I should pass it to them.
---
Just continue questing and leveling as usual. Gold income will be a lot higher the higher your level is.
---
That might turn out to be a death sentence if there are multiple mobs nearby
---
Since always. Get a job and move out.
---
End game is different for everyone. Some raid, some world pvp, some BG or arena pvp, some level alts, some just professions. I am a pvper and am waiting for those phases.
---
Wisdom does not appear to give threat, at least according to tests from the Classic Pally discord.
---
The real end game.
---
Ya that’s sounds like an infantile approach.
---
In the Maul? How the rare elites are very strong and you always get contested by other players
---
About to ding 55 on my Warlock finally.  Since doing ZF once at 44 I've only managed to get 1 mara run for quests and 1 partial BRD run (where I didn't get to finish a single quest).  Should I keep plugging away at quests for a few more levels or is it a good time to start farming dungeons for gear and xp?
---
Yeah I've already admitted my mistake. And this is entirely correct:  
---
&gt;If you sat at the start of a run of 999 and said what are the chances you'd get 999 heads in a row, you'd calculate some very small number. If you calculated the probability of getting 999 heads in a row followed by another head, you'd find that it had exactly the same probability has getting 999 heads in a row followed by a tail (in both cases its 0.51000).
---
I hate when people do this. 
---
The same annoying people who put it on their youtube title as clickbait because they don't know simple math, or they flat out ignore it.
---
I always handle one rule.
---
You pull it, you tank it.
---
Simple as that...
---
* I recommend using scatter on doomguards, since they cast cripple. You can switch fast to the warlocks if you see immolate is about to be cast.
---
* I only reset the instance if I haven't spent a large seaforium charge. It's nice to learn the timing for multiple different cycles - and it can even save you some time depending on where Fengus/slip'kik/patrols are :)
---
* After 40 runs I think I found 2 class books on the ground, and 2 dropped from Gordok himself.
---
I’m having the same. Exact. Problem. And I can’t farm a better weapon. #shamanlife
---
Yea mostly the same for me too. Only in Kargath once or twice did someone randomly pop a gold in a trade window without saying anything.. I hadn't even learned the portals though lol
---
yesterday someone wanted to buy water in org, I said sure. noticed he was 54 so couldn't get gucci water which made it easy to make 6 stacks of lvl 45 water. I never said a price cause I didn't really care. got 2g for it :D
---
Cell phone pic of his computer screen "graphic design"
---
Aye, I think I will, though I'm leaning towards passing it to them. And there's only one reason why I'd ever loot council items to someone, and that's if we had hit a hard wall on progression via something like a dps race (where tank threat wasn't sufficient) or we were suffering tank death issues. I don't see that being an issue though for a long time.
---
I've noticed this too
---
I've been told to buy better water before. I'm like naw, I can hardly afford new abilities as it is, I'm not paying 1g in water when half the time they dont even let me finish it before they pull 6 mobs in SM bath out of LOS and I need to blow many on shields and flash heals to save their ass.
---
Your only mistake is that you didn't let that guy aggro and die lol. I would try to kill him :D Other than that you did 100% right \^\^
---
That tiger stat dire nail tho.
---
the one where you use consumable, mana pots and runes to spam flash heal.
---
You can't heal while having a target mc'd.
---
Dungeon grind your way to the top is the 1-60 Prot guide.
---
This is a blatant lie. Please stop talking out of your ass buddy...
---
haha! pretty much what he said to me too
---
I agree.
---
Items worth hundreds of gold should be rolled by everyone. Just because you are able to use that item, doesn't make you entitled to get hundreds of gold all alone when it took the whole group to drop the item.
---
ahhh, there's that ptsd kicing in
---
Ive been in groups where the mage is ready before the healer and pulls everything and causes a wipe. It's not just a meme, I've seen it happen
---
Well, as far as I remember, I used this method since vanilla up to when i stopped playing (start of cataclysm).
---
However I came from "select a target, click/press spell on my action bar" and once you get used to this other way of healing, you can't really go back.
---
Havig every heal on a mouse click (and combo, like CTRL/ALT/SHIFT+Click) makes actually simpler to manage the movement as well.
---
My resting position is having my hand on the `wasd` buttons, with my fourth finger (dunno the word in english for the smaller finger of your hand :P) hovering on the SHIFT/CTRL area.
---
My thumb is usually hovering over the ALT/SPACEBAR.
---
just by having this position I have this combinations for spells:
---
- Left Click, Right Click, Middle Click (I also have a cheap mouse with a fourth button on the side)
---
- CTRL + Left Click, Right Click, Middle Click
---
- SHIFT + Left Click, Right Click, Middle Click
---
- ALT + Left Click, Right Click, Middle Click
---
W, A, S, D + SPACEBAR for quick movements (altough as I said, it happens rarely)
---
Also, by just extending my index or middle finger  I can reach 1,2 3,4,5,6 keys which usually have some utilities buttons or just some damage spell/skill if I really fancy filling it between one heal and the other.
---
My Reasoning for assigning spells usually follow this:
---
- bread and butter spells: straight on the mouse click
---
- Oh SHIT! Spells: SHIFT modifier (SHIFT remind me of "swift" or "shit" :P)
---
- Slow or situational spells: CTRL modifier
---
- Regular click/right click on ALT modifier (select a target, open contextual menu)
---
Lately i'm experimenting with the no-modifier and alt-modifier switched as I tend to tank with my druid and only cast spells between pulls. It's up to how it feels to you.
---
&gt; Humans are pattern recognition machines and will very often see patterns where there are none.
---
Which is the funny thing about **True Randomness**, which would actually be more clustered and we would start perceiving patterns and call them bugs in the coding. I am not saying Blizzard is using real true randomness, but they may be using some kind of illusion of true randomness.
---
There’s no reason not to buy all your spells. Don’t rely on a guide either. You’ll find you have knowledge but few connections and it’s easy to pick out who can follow a guide we’ll but who can’t think outside the parameters. Guides also rob you of the experience of really learning.
---
But all your spells for sure.
---
Also, VW are okay threat generators but they don’t have a taunt. You need to let them build more aggro. They aren’t designed to be basically an NPC Warrior you play with. They can, however, deal with adds that come to you. Put a VW on an add that runs to you and it’ll build threat while you deal with the main target.
---
The beauty of DoTs is that you can throw them all on and then just wand for the duration. Not sure why a guide would even tell you to use Shadowbolt since wand DPS is an obviously better option.
---
I've done one MC pug so far, and we cleared 8 bosses in about 2.5 hours. With enough douses we would have killed Domo and Rag in 30 mins. If you're spending more than 4 hours to clear the whole thing, you're doing something very wrong.
---
Warrior is hard mode, there's a damn good reason it's hard to find tanks.
---
Thank you this all makes sense.
---
My favorite memory is (or rather, will be) talking to my manager about Classic. He played during Vanilla through WotLK and then quit gaming altogether. Now that I'm playing he gets to re-experience it vicariously through me. And purely by coincidence I'm the same race/class that he was 15 years ago!
---
Thank you very much!  I didn't want the extra functionality with food, buffs, potions, etc. so I altered main.lua to be [this](https://pastebin.com/259tdaDX) if anyone else is in the same boat as me.
---
Haha, this reminds me of those hotel dudes that carry your luggage upstairs and stand at the door until you tip. "aren't you forgetting something sir?"
---
Rerolling my 6th alt 2 months in while sobbing.
---
Each pull may be slower than chain pulling, but you’re less likely to wipe.  If the pulls go smoothly you’ll clear the dungeon faster than chain pulling and wiping over and over.
---
With only a few select PvP servers where the alliance all transferred off,  early every PvP server is even or fair 45/55.
---
PvE servers on the flip aide are overwhelmingly dominated by alliance (65/35 or beyond)
---
Mage is a retard fck em you are totally right
---
Ok thank you both, so really just dont focus too hard on it when I get to 60?
---
ty
---
Because I know that’s how reserving gear works, but like I said in my original post that you replied to btw, who master loots in deadmines of all places
---
weapon skill doesn't apply to feral druids
---
You should train all the weapon options.  As a druid weapon skill doesn't matter.  The weapon just gives you stats not speed.  Just use whatever weapon has more agi/str.
---
Yes this sounds v good, I like the idea of something simple and sustainable.
---
Prot good.
---
My favorite WoW memory was my first world PvP encounter back in Vanilla. I was heading to SFK to help a friend with a paladin quest and an Orc shaman popped up. I was a terrible player and had no idea what I was doing to I popped a swiftness potion and ran for the nearby Alliance-friendly village. Don't think he knew what he was doing either because he ran in after me and got smoked by the NPCs.
---
Huh? Horde and alliance can be fury warriors. I'm confused.
---
got mine yesterday around 25 runs, 3rd gorosh kill
---
damn I need to find the warlock's equivilent
---
ZG is more than puggable. It's fairly trivial for retail raiders since the group size isn't different and the mechanics are so much easier. Gear requirement isn't that high either.
---
It absolutely makes sense to me and i say at all the time. Taking it slower and more smoothly as in being patient and letting the tank get threat, ccing, etc ends up being faster than dps trying to sprint through the dungeon and pulling aggro, using more mana, risking wipes, etc
---
I’ve thought about this aswell! I imagine you won’t come too far tho.
---
It was Smolderweb NA. My guild has almost 1k people and the mage was from it. Im considering joining another guild. The tank was also from my guild. Idk, Im going to try a few times this week and go from there.
---
Start your own group, mages and rogues are the worst. They always want to pull pat's and shit. In a place like strat, one bad pull will wipe you.  I give them a warning "let me pull please :)". If they do it one or 2 more warn them, boot and replace. 
---
DPS are a dime a dozen and there's no reason waste time on people that are going to make your run horrible. 
---
Most importantly,  they have no idea that as a warrior you MUST take damage early for rage. If you don't get rage, everyone is dead.
---
Bot ignore a mob if tagged, but if you time your tag right, he will still generate enough aggro before moving on to a new "fresh" target. That so, if there's enough target in range, you can push a bot to aggro more mobs than he can handle. (And more or less kill him). That's a good way to get them to stop for a moment.
---
To each their own. Maybe you'd like retail?
---
i got my drakestone of frozen wrath on my second ST run as a frost mage.
---
Oof, I got mine after 30 runs of arena on my hunter.
---
Warrior sub about level 15 was pretty rough but somewhere around 15 I finally got a decent weapon and it started fealing a lot easier.  To pull a single mob you'll want to invest in a bow or a gun or even throwing knives.  None of them really have stats that I can think of until much later so just grab whatever you can find and go train the appropriate skill for it.  Sometimes they'll just be too close and you'll have burn potions or find someone nearby to help.  Sometimes you may need to kill one and hamstring and run from the 2nd until it leashes and you can rest and go back, but in my experience this usually just resulted in me dying while running away.  Just remember to try and aim for mobs a level or 2 below your level and it'll be much easier.
---
If it were flawless the random tanks would pull faster :)
---
Feign Death in hunter ??
---
Blizzard needs to fix the damn servers and give them.more hardware. Its fucking infuriating to not be able to fight back when a city raid happens because the lag gets so bad.
---
I’m guessing others here might have assumed you were asking how gear-dependent mages were, the answer of which is not as much as other classes making it easier for them to meet requirements. As far as competition goes they’re currently the hardest I’d say, unless you somehow find a guild that doesn’t have an abundance of mages (to which I say good luck with that).
---
I'm new to Classic (but not to Vanilla) and decided to skip rebuilding my first ever WoW character (Hunter) and instead level a warrior.
---
Wow. Just wow. This meme is true.
---
I'm looking up some guides to remind me of how things used to be. Weapon damage and speed, the importance of Agility, etc etc. So much more helpful!

I agree here - at least not ignore the healer guy completely, but rather try for some diplomatic solution - either rejoin and say that if the mage does it once more, they can look for a new tank, or just give a choice of either looking for a new tank or a new DPS. That's what I would have done.

---
But yeah, this seems quite good.
---
Honestly, aggro gear is tank gear too, yes vanilla/classic items are weird and bad because some classes just get boned, still I would prefer a tank who keeps the mob on him over a DPS warrior getting aggro and dieing almost instantly with his leather bis dps gear
---
I just love a good 'ol skirmish where everyone dies
---
I think I can survive without your god tier healing, almighty one. I’ll just find a lesser-tier-but-still-perfectly-serviceable healer and keep on moving at a pace I’m comfortable with as I learn to tank with a class I’ve never tanked with before. 
---
You’re right though, tanks can be just as bad, but the way I see it, mr god tier, you have two options: 1) do what you’re doing now, which only helps you, or 2) help make the tank better. More serviceable tanks on your server, the better your server becomes. I’m not sure if that option has ever crossed your omniscient mind, oh great one, but you might consider condescending unto the unwashed masses and imparting some of that godliness. Just a thought, please don’t strike me down in righteous anger. 
---
Also, if you’re on Atiesh, feel free to add Rally to that tank blacklist, (it’s Rally with an alt character “a”), cuz I ain’t runnin with ya.
---
Yeah also I usually put up the stacks for 24hrs. They almost always sell.
---
There's 8 warriors in my guild's raid group. 3 of them are tanks. 1 takes a tank set with them, we have a feral druid with tank gear as well.
---
Half of the warriors will never tank in raids. But most are perfectly capable of tanking dungeons, and will generally be asked to do so if they PUG.
---
What you're saying is that half of all warriors should never be allowed to roll on gear that helps their raiding spec in dungeons if any hunters, rogues, DPS warriors or ferals are in the group.
---
To that I say: good luck finding any fucking tanks.
---
Correction, op got unflagged after failing to be able to attack anyone due to lag.
---
I feel like... maybe lvl 7 LOL
---
Still work on getting your bis just be aware we are  wont see a good boost until BWL/AQ.
---
Why might be think it's wrong? Because his actions affected 2 other innocent people and he's not a sociopath. It being a video game isn't relevant.
---
Favorite memory is my first time raiding MC a few days ago with the guild and getting 2 epic gear!
---
What the fuck are you talking about

---
The first Rogue sinister strike is 0.1 Seconds after the tank melees the boss
---
People do this with gear too. They focus on BiS lists not realising a bit of stam for example goes a long way towards raid survivability.
---
No. Go find another tank.
---
You can get away with 8% hit in MC. I have tested it though and you do miss. You mot missing could have been good RNG.
---
That beig said.... its way to easy to get 9% hit. If you have he bow, get the hit scope and youre 1/3 of the way hit capped.
---
Porting some people because they were doing some last minute crafts or other stuff is ok.
---
But anything else is not acceptable.
---
For that reason guilds use invite times and a set starting time.
---
Warlocks have to fly so you can to.
---
It' a set date, not some random group with guys all over the place.
---
But why was the mage ready before.  If he like evod and pulled yeah the mage is a jackass if the healer just isn't sitting when combat drops that's his fault.
---
Tanking used to be something Warriors were forced to do. Protection tree is necessary for main-tanking still, but there are too many Warriors who like being Protection, I think. If you have the leverage to say that you don’t want to tank but you are for the guild, do that, but really I think they’ll find someone. You may have to respec and refocus your role. At least you would in my guild.
---
This. I mainspec a healer so I generally dont lead dungeons. It blows my mind the risks people often take to skip groups. Groups, which often get pulled anyway.
---
Totally forgot about the new r14 weapons. Makes sense that we get all of them in p2.
---
You could get Sulfuras on a decent class, just sayin'.
---
My server. Amazing how few names I recognize for the amount of time I play. I'll have to give a few of them shit for not thanking you.
---
Nah I'm saying you're a joke. Not your character, or your class, you.
---
Who the fuck cares if a shaman successfully tanks?
---
A douche.
---
This post exactly. My first character was a warrior that I suck out till 60 but I learned quickly that classic tanking isn't for me. It seems like nobody will focus skull and that the dps try to make my job as hard as they can with their burst. Whenever I try to los pull and a shaman opens up with an earth shock before the mob even gets to me, my blood boils. Tanking isn't for me. I'm leveling a druid now to go resto.
---
My jungle loooooooooove, owey owey owe. I wanna get to know ya know ya
---
I think it was drops in general. Got 3 essence of airs in a row today.
---
Wrong: The healers are the kings. The faster tanks understand this the better. 
---
Tanks are the first line protectors of the group. If they fail to do so every others party member first job is to protect the healer.  
---
The more healers let the incompetent members die the faster they will learn.
---
You can't see how old an orc is. They all look the same...
---
You're exaggerating. 2 hours to kill Ony and clear MC is very, very fast. Maybe some pugs are doing that now, but the pugs on my server sure as hell aren't. It's far along the tail of that bell curve.
---
Slaying deathwing for the first time! Is atrted playing in cata so it was a huge achievement for me
---
i like battling other mages I'd say I'm slightly ahead of the pack in straight 1v1
---
Best memory has to be Pandaria release when I got the server first Skinning achievment. The hype was so real! 😀
---
Are there complications with earthbind totem or why are you not using it for this?
---
It makes no difference. I'd have no problem kicking a guild mate if they are being complete assholes.
---
The bad players go towards the least resistance.
---
No, as usual, fuck mages.
---
You weren’t wrong, no, but with a good party there would be little downtime. Don’t listen to DPS. Instead focus on how you and the healer coordinate best and the DPS will follow.
---
Mentioned to a Guildy that I was thinking about farming it up and he said 
---
"Fuck that!, I'm not running that place to farm it..." 
---
You can solo... just walk in and kill the two dragons...  it takes a few minutes each try
---
"Oh really?"
---
Gets the +20 on his FIRST KILL.  As expected of course....
---
While levelling almost everyone is a dps, some people just do others the courtesy of tanking/healing so dungeons can be done. So while levelling I would say there isnt even a need to inform people you will be rolling on solo gear.
---
At 60 I would say it is a good idea to inform people up front about what gear you want to roll on.
---
Bullshitting my way into my first mythic raiding guild and trialing on their Mythic Krosus pulls that night a month after my first logjn. Very nervous, didn't want to fel rush off the edge into the water. I quickly realized they all suck and was relieved I had found a guild I could learn with and not feel bad about dumpstering later. Thanks and sorry bros.
---
Which is still extremely lucky that it was just 1 miss.
---
Well, at least you can still pull and spam BoK to keep light aggro until you have packed everything and drop Consecrate
---
You must have some pretty bad FPS if it's causing you to run into multiple groups at once.
---
Just checked this morning and it's definitely up to date. I use the twitch client to keep my add-ons updated each day. I just don't understand what's going on. I checked to make sure I have the most up to date version of Atlas Loot Classic, I even downloaded it from the wowinterface website and installed it manually just to see if by some chance there was a different version depending on where you downloaded it from. I also disabled all my other add-ons except Atlas Loot Classic and still didn't fix anything. I also can't find a setting in Atlas Loot Classic that would turn something like this off. Pretty frustrating.
---
This has always been my understanding.
---
My speed depends primarily on the healers mana. I usually start off slow, and if I'm not denting that blue bar, I'll pull more until I can clear 25% of their mana in a single pull.
---
Honestly I wouldn’t use lifestealing on anything over crusader unless it was on a 19 rogue twink
---
We don't judge here :P
---
Depends on prices on your AH. I like farming satyrs for felcloth/normal cloth/runes as well as recenly some undead in EPL while waiting for rich thorium vein respawn. I had skinning, skinned lots of devilsaurs and the end after into tailoring.
---
What are you even on about?  https://imgur.com/Zj1KDXk This is Vim before the cast is finished 
---
https://imgur.com/JXXbjqt this is Vim as the fireball hits the ground.  Vim does later take damage, but it's obviously just splash damage if you watch other people getting hit full on in that video.  People that take the fireball to the face get to 1/3rd health.  Vim started at about 2/3rd and only drops to 1/3rd from the splash.
---
I actually fully agree - I didn't know I wanted this, but I do :)
---
&gt; There's so much to this game even without raids being a thing
---
That was my whole point. I know it sounded a bit harsh but thats the truth, classic only has *so* much to offer for a casual crowd and its the part of all wow parts/expansions with the least content for a casual player.
---
Retails LFR e.g. offers a phenomenal way for casuals to gain better gear to feel some kind of progression while grinding casual daylies for pets/mounts etc. Wich both dont exist in classic - thus my question to why at all discuss irrelevant tier sets, that are meant for nonraiders to feel some progression, when there is nothing to use that progression on for a casual player in classic.
---
Ofc "fun" is allways an argument to play a game. But that was not what the discussion was about.
---
My guild uses a weird loot system, and I wanted to see if it also didn't make sense to other people.
---
It's a hybrid system of roll on tier 1/misc gear up to once/week with loot council on tier 2/high priority items.
---
So basically you can only win one piece of tier 1 per week unless no one else wants that piece, but still have a chance to win tier 2/big ticket items via loot council. Sounds okay in theory, but there are problems with it.
---
The first issue is that the loot council factors in if you've won gear recently. By winning a tier 1 piece you are basically also locking yourself out of any loot council gear.
---
The second issue is that even boe tier 1 loot locks you out of winning other gear that week. This creates a system of people afraid to even roll on gear because it's a slight upgrade because of not wanting to be locked out of a bigger upgrade deeper in the dungeon.
---
Does this make sense to other people or am I just being crazy?
---
Would one of these options work for you
---
Disable error sound, hide error frame, do stuffs, then reenable the frame and error sounds.

---
Yeah fair enough, I suppose when I ask myself why am I even engaging in this in the first place when it would be faster to just farm with my main (I wouldn't even have asked for much, not more than 1-2 gold for something like SFK), I honestly can't even answer that. If it was about profits, I'd make more just farming with my main and when I hit 60 with the tank to just reserve something like the first orb in Strat.
---
When I really give it some thought, I suppose I'd only be tanking for a change of pace from playing rogue. Some of the folks I've worked with for years have been of the mindset that 'if you're not getting paid, then why do it?', and it can get kind of hard to get past that mindset. The idea I wanted to apply was that I'd be rolling up a protection warrior who's geared out for that level range whose selling their ability to tank professionally, but this IS a game and at the end of the day we're all playing to unwind, not as a job. It's not exactly the most pleasant experience to need a tank and the only one available is asking for cash, I suppose it is pretty toxic.
---
Climbing to the top of ironforge!
---
Wow. That's like saying "here you clean up this mess" yah kick or leave in that case.
---
It is not as bad with druids. You have a lot of Buttons for out of form and formdancing.
---
But in General you'll have almost all tank abilities in your bear form taskbar. Damange in your cat. Spells in you Standard (out of form) or owl form.
---
Heals I just have all over the place xD
---
So I don't really have to Change anything buttonwise when I Change my role. I do have to have a different mindset though
---
While I agree with you, this just goes back to my first statement: if you're going to gear a feral like that, there is no reason to not use a fury/prot instead, especially with innervate and bres barely ever needing to be used during MC/Ony.
---
People are in this thread talking about min/maxing and leaving stats/dps on the table and completely ignoring the fact that a fury/prot will push out infinitely more DPS than a feral in threat gear.
---
lol, rogues have their own fun too though
---
Eh, you can only summon if two of their party is already there so they pay and work it out themselves, not your problem.
---
Oh yah if someone wants to waste time traveling when leveling the more logical path is Booty Bay-Ratchet-Theramore-Menethil-Rut'theran-Auberdine. I got started right after turning in Nat Pagle, hence the order I went in
---
Dude just keep your orc hunter and make whatever class you want on another server. Then when you feel like playing hunter with your friends do it. You feel like playing alliance  with a pally do it, find a guild, be friendly, boom, wierd internet friends. Don't delete your character just don't log in to him if you don't want to play
---
I don’t disagree. If a tank is waiting for everyone to get back to 100% everything, ya nudge them along, that’s poor pacing.
---
Finding skull flame shield in corin's crossing at level 59 during vanilla. I sold it to my guild bank and with that DKP I bought 5/8 T1, it was actually insane. Also funded most of my epic mount.
---
What should I do when I'm level 12 and can't complete quests like Disrupt The Attacks, The Zhevra and Hidden Enemies?  Shadow Bolt is good but 2.2s cast time is way too long and my pet does only 6-12 damage. 
---
I still do not know how to first aid myself, how to cook or how to fish even though I bought a fishing pole. The game tells me absolutely nothing! Going to watch some videos later today but man I don't like when a game doesn't tell you anything.
---
I feel like this is just a low key AITA to confirm your actions that you already know were justified
---
Read the rest of the comments. I’m talking about situations where the tank just doesnt pick up the full pack. Situations that are 100% the tanks fault.
---
I was thinking of using Thrash Blade as MH and Flurry as off-hand
---
Play whatever you want to play.
---
Being the primary "puller" in MC on my Hunter. Getting to go ahead of everyone else and kite the next pull back to the raid. Taking those risky shots when patrols were crossing paths and hearing the raid gasp as I almost pull two giants. Using Control Beast to send Champ, my wolf, out to Baron Geddon's room to bring him back into Garr's room. And playing Eye of the Tiger over Vent whenever the raid needed a pick-me-up.
---
If DPS was truly your concern, you would be using a fury/prot instead of a feral running threat gear.
---
Hunters don't have to deal with glancing blows, so extra hit doesn't help them out.
---
It sounds fun until you get to a zone like hillsbrad and 3 level 60s corpse camp you for 6 hours. 
---
That was my night last night.
---
You can check [https://classicwow.live/](https://classicwow.live/)
---
I play tank for my guild, strictly to get prioritized loot.
---
Not from what I've seen. I think I've done five pugs now and we always manage to summon by back-and-forthing dowsers if necessary (except for one disastrous one that was hardstuck on Geddon) but only one killed it. So that's three fails, one success, and one no summon. Saying Rag is easier than Garr seems just obviously false to me.
---
How?  Is it a soft cap?
---
I'm tanking one of the horsemen for let's say 40 seconds (I don't remember how often you needed to switch tanks on them). At that point I need another tank to come and grab it from me asap or the debuff will stack too much. And at that point I'll have about 40 seconds worth of threat on the boss.
---
A warrior can.  
---
A druid can.  
---
A paladin can't. Because they don't have taunt.
---
DAE think mages = new huntards ????
---
Not wrong. Sucks for the other guys though. Should’ve kicked the mage but he was probably the party leader.
---
I'm surprised I'm not seeing GDKP runs honestly.
---
Yeah, because theyre not tanks, theyre just warrior DPS and theyre like, "Meh, yeah I can tank"
---
I was saying that warrior DPS with a 2hander is competitive with dual wield on the Horde side. Windfury is what makes it viable.
---
Without windfury on the alliance side, warrior DPS with a 2hander doesn't even come close to dual wield fury.
---
So Alliance side, 2handers are inherently PvP gear, since they suck as proper raid DPS weapons.
---
It’s spend all, if you want an item your bid is all your DKP. There is no “i only wanna spend 7”.
---
It is very good Crit item in path of exile (the diamond flask).
---
&gt;/4 I'm a tank

Some Endgame shit right here
---
I think you'd be better with mirahs song in offhand as the scholo quest for hit at later levels (58-60) but duel wielding with low hit (which is evident in lower levels) can really suck, so being a human with flurry might not be worth
---
Thrash blade is from a mara quest and it'll last you until dal rends in ubrs.  I personally think krol blade is a waste of money unless you really want to jump into raiding asap and for some reason need good gear to do that.
---
Someone else linked shadow panther and I've seen that site before but never used it but what I'd use is sixtyupgrades.com on there you can see lists of the "best" gear under any conditions based on preset or custom stat weighting.  It's very easy to pick out which gear you want to go for when it's all consolidated and ranked in 1 place.
---
You're the real MVP
---
Playing a warrior allowed me to improve my general approach to fighting multiple opponents by "adjustment of the charging direction in previously scouted territory based on re-evaluating of the tactical situation at hand". 
---
At first I died to ridiculously obvious unfavorable battles. But in time the improvement resulted in more and more victories. 
---
Now I can deny almost any enemy a victory over my little Ragemachine by superior tactical moves on the battlefield.
---
The only dents in the steep victory curve are caused by unavoidable mishaps like unruly peacefulness resulting in a calm,unraging mind or the "miss-tress of misses" (a witch yet to be burned!!!).
---
So stand tall, my fellow warriors, and do not succumb the cowardish flight employed by the lesser classes. Allow yourselves to be the magnificent, bloodbathed harbingers of war and slaughter that you are destined to be !
---
Faerlina is the streamer server, so be careful with that. It’s a different server feel with that many streamers on there.
---
But it is a problem when it is better. A lot of classes and speccs already only need 3-5 raid items from Phase 1. The rest being overshadowed by dungeon loot. Reducing that number even more would be stupid.
---
People have trouble with dispels and facing cleaving mobs away from the melee, and output in general (threat, damage and healing). The average player is pretty bad.
---
I'm at around 170 runs so far.  I've only seen Gorosh once so far.   Congratulations.
---
You did the right thing
---
The decay prevents this. If you're in the lower brackets, you'll never keep enough to get to R14.
---
Who the hell still plays on a 4:3 monitor?!
---
I want the instant cast Voidwalker trinket asap
---
People have been toxic, dropping groups soon as their boss dies in the instance or when they get quests done etc.
---
It doesn't feel like classic at all in some parts.
---
Pala is pretty simple, druid pretty complicated in pvp, more than warrior, but in raids and dungeons isn't very hard and druid impact isn't big, so you can't topping metres with druid dps, warriors always bis in dps or tank role.
---
Sounds like a legend
---
can't always spare the time it takes to open a bad, hunt and click.
---
E.g. you have half a second before tank engages for next pull and you get flagged for combat, and you "Must" start drinking before .
---
Or
---
You've successfully escaped a hordey that was trying to gank you, and now you need to eat + drink + shadow meld, so you can recover before he finds you again.
---
I just can’t wait.
---
I guess I still don't understand the incentive for the tank to do anything other than what he did.
---
thank you
---
Vanish is supposed to provide a way to dodge projectiles and spells which are in the air. The only thing correct in your post is the part where you noted it does not do this. Rogues in vanilla are particularly vulnerable to spells without Cloak of Shadows, resilience, high HP, healing, nor any other dispels to remove them. Thus, it's only sensible that Vanish should provide a 0.5 or 1 second immunity to all physical and magical damage before it drops combat. This is how Vanish was fixed in WOTLK and it was a reasonable band-aid.
---
It's laughable that you are defending Vanish (and Feign Death, by proxy) in their current form.
---
Yes they are.
---
This whole conversation started because of that.

Hunter fd has some similar issues. You have to stay still for 1 sec of global cooldown for it to work you'll just waste the cd and nothing happens.

yeah, he just wanted the crit, and its spell crit.

I also think that shit needs to be done about world pvp dying in phase 3. Phase 2 is gonna be awesome. We need to keep that going. Imo, have honor be worth more in open world. Bgs will be more consistent but make world pvp still lucrative
---
Kinda hard to tell how you should behave, sure maybe you were slow. What I know for certain is that you act like a bitch. Even need a bunch of random people online to tell you that you are a good boy lol
---
whatever floats your boat.
---
You can play Horde with your friends and roll Alliance to some other server and solo. Lots of social guilds out there, I'm sure you won't miss out.
---
It is really common to get bored grinding xp and leveling, take a break, play some other class for a while and if you feel like playing hunter, you can go and do that. You can have multiple characters. At least that is what I do.
---
Its around 2.6% crit for warriors and 26 AP.  There just isn't really anything comparable until phase 5.
---
That's exactly what I am talking about: if she is being kited, she can store up multiple charges of this and will hit you enhancement shaman style in your face once she reaches you.

It's Blizzard's attempt at nerfing solo Princess runs.

no no its a feature that was accidentally added with spell batching

Global warming.
---
I don't think there's anything that complicated about pve. But when you look at how some classes are able to take on 2 or 3 enemies at once in pvp by timing abilities and cooldowns perfectly along with managing engineer grenades etc then classes like mage and rogue start to get quite complicated.
---
You think you can tank any fight requiring precise tank swaps as paladin?
---
I am a fury warrior. But I always have my tanking set in my bags. Never know when you need to be able to get really clutch with some tanking.
---
Yah I was surprised at the resulting numbers but I think it's because I only did 100 per dock. Even twice that likely would have evened it out some. 
---
And of course going after pools would be much better. This was a fairly useless exercise other than the fact it made it more fun to grind
---
Sounds a bit odd. I'd just go for a guild using DKP, alternatively a system with DKP with trinkets/weapons being loot councilled to stop people from hoarding DKP for those pieces and not getting any tier/misc stuff. The second option requires a dedicated raiding crew and a fair loot council, which can be hard to come by.
---
Either of those options, or just pug it for MS &gt; OS or MS &gt; OS +1.
---
Nope.
---
Love when mage frost nova's the mobs I'm standing next to and tank runs off to pull the one they missed leaving the rest to start hitting me because I'm the closest now

Will BWL be easy like MC is now when it releases? What is the first content you can expect guilds to have progress raids?

---
Wow calculates things like this in a weird way.
---
You probably think, "Hey I have a 4sec attack speed weapon and have 40% haste, that means I attack in 2.4 seconds."  You then look and realize that is not the case.
---
The way the calculation works is 
---
(Weapon Attack speed)/((Haste amount/100)+1)
---
So if you have a 4 speed weapon and 40 percent haste from SOTC it becomes
---
4/((40/100)+1  Which is 4/(.4)+1 which is 4/1.4 = 2.85.
---
The calculation is a bit inverted from what you think it would be.  Instead of being 4x.6, it's 4/1.4.  And 2.85/4 = .71% which is why you are thinking it gives 30% haste.
---
I remember back in Wrath I was leveling feral while my best friend was leveling rogue. All of a sudden a party of 5 players start to chase us. We begin to run away and they are chasing us across all possible zones when we look like we are about to go down, we run into a raid that was summoning just outside a raid. They turn around and you literally see a ball of players starch the 5 enemy players. 
---
After about an hour or two we spotted each of the 5 members of that party solo leveling. We would take turns pretending to solo level while we corpse camped them.
---
I get bitched at by random pugs all the time about packs they think I should be skipping.
---
Like bud, I've been tanking for 15 years and I know what idiot DPS are gonna accidentally aggro, might as well clear it on purpose and avoid the headache of wiping/nearly wiping later.
---
35-40
---
Also, fuck Desolace.
---
Exactly, it's not a chat.
---
The tank sets the pace, it's literally part of the tank's job.
---
You want another pace? look for another tank or roll tank yourself.
---
Thought that was Cijo
---
Why type that out when an open trade window with 25s is enough?
---
So funny,  I feel your pain,  gotta lay down the rules early and boot those who don't want to work as a team.  Preferably not the healer but dps are a dime a dozen. Bring a warlock for easy replace
---
interresting, think it might have something to do with your internet connection. good = no 19 tick.
---
My vote is either druid or warrior
---
im 6/8 Tier 1, 1 piece of tier 2, and still using a level 43 quest reward necklace because i cant get one to drop.

You cant really say which is the hardest/most complicated class to play, it all depends on for what purpose. Like most classes in vanilla are easy if we are talking about just raiding, where you rarely have to make use of most of what your class is capable of, but if we talk about potential situations that would require the absolute most of your class then there are a few, that are way harder to master than others.
---
- Warriors would be one as you say. Basically the skill cap of a warrior in dungeons is extreamly high, as that Warrior could be tanking and doing a great ammount of dps, interrupting most things and kiting shit all on his own. It just requires a lot of macros, weapon switching, stance changes and all that kinds of stuff, but you rarely every see a Warrior do even half of this.
---
- Mages is another one, and yes most people would probably laugh at this. But unless you have tried to AOE farm the hardest things, while also maximizing what you do as a Mage, you are not allowed to talk. You have to do everything at the exact right time, while moving perfectly, to gather up the mobs and not take dmg and all that stuff, not easy at all. Also in PVP mages got a rather big kit, that is hard to utilize to a maximum.
---
- Druids - Once again super easy in the standard raiding situation, but using all forms, all spells and whatever you got to uptimize PVP and dungeon skill is super hard and you also rarely see any druids do any of this stuff.
---
- Hunters in situations where you have to kite and at the same time pull your pet ouf of dmg situations and so on. Most things are very easy as a hunter, but to do the absolute best it requires some serious multitasking, watching yourself and your pet and controlling both at the same time.
---
These would be by list for the most complicated classes if you talk about situations that potentially would require the absolute most skills out of your class.
---
Indeed, and in classic you don't even need to wipe over and over. Having corpse run wipes can really negate that time you tried to save by just wiping once. If we say that it takes around 20 seconds to kill a pack (and with good dps that might even be stretching it) and you might have 2-3 packs per run to bypass with a risk of pulling it, then just pulling it accidentally and wiping ONCE will take a good 3-5 minutes to catch up to where you were compared to 40-60 seconds of just clearing them instead.
---
Just making up numbers and estimates though, but that's my take on it.
---
Paladins have some of the best Solo options in the game for grinding AoE.
---
Er....not really, depending on which stuff you do. I had a simple group (priest healer, 2 warriors, 1 melee shammy, 1 mage) and we killed princess in under 10 minutes.
---
The difference is we also did landslide before princess, then jumped down to do crock -&gt; goblin and that run took about 25 or so mins. But that's 3 additional bosses.
---
&gt;It's a sellers market for tanks in classic.
---
It sure is! Still, providing the group with the options to either get the mage to behave, or to replace either the mage or find another tank, would have been a much nicer way to solve things. Fighting bad behavior with bad behavior (punishing 3 other people for 1 player's idiocy) is not the way to IMO. Be better than them, and all that.
---
Walk backwards and clip, watch mob swing timer, run away. 
---
I didn't think I'd have to explain the whole mechanic lol.
---
Warrior tank and two DPS (Rogue, Warrior, Paladin, Hunter can all use this)?
---
Not that crazy.
---
Personally, once I entered a dungeon I dont leave the group unless there is some major bullshit happening. And even then I warn the group beforehand, given it is not beyond their control. But thats just me. Generally speaking, you can leave any group anytime you want for whatever reason you consider appropriate. You always risk burning bridges that way, no matter how reasonable you are. But as a tank you would have to be quite the pain in the ass to not find groups anymore.
---
There wasn't any hotfix made or scheduled to be made that I know that changes the thrash mechanic, she's been that way since classic released and the thrash mechanic has always been around though I don't know if this multiple queued up one has been a thing in vanilla.
---
That's subjective, so it's rather hard to refute it on behalf of other people.
---
I'm not quite sure what you mean by this post. I agree that there are more warriors that want to tank than there are tank spots in a raid, and I could easily dps if I chose to, but I enjoy tanking, I'm quite good at it, and I have a lot of experience doing it. I am also the raid leader, so I get to choose who does what.
---
If you mean that I'm replaceable, sure, I am. Anyone is. I just don't see the relevance this insight has to this discussion.
---
&gt;entire purpose of the class is to fire tranq shots
---
Switching gear on bosses isn't that hard and a dps sim has nothing to do with a boss mechanic being done correctly
---
Yes, "young" has other connotations in English language than just age of a person.
---
Seeing as it takes alliance on my server 3-4 corpse runs to get into dire maul, I have little complaints about world PvP dying in phase 3. Hardly any EU servers have balanced factions, we've been getting ganked at the entrance of dungeons for a long time now.
---
I don't need food or water often...or ever.
---
Yeah sure, its Pre-Raid BIS, but it's Best in Slot for Warriors for the REST OF THE GAME. Lol Why would you even waste time running Arena when you're going to use 8/8 Giantstalker anyway? It's time management, and being courteous to others' time as well. Hunters, and Shaman pass to warriors, and if you're running Arena for it, you can Duo it at 60 without breaking anyones heart.
---
i am using mik's scrolling battle text
---
I believe a war and healer can do diremaul east jump runs if you have herbalism and mining it's good money.  I don't think leveling gear is a huge issue but I haven't done them with a war.
---
I think this is a GREAT IDEA.  Glad to see you got traction.
---
You're lucky you can hide in the water, alliance's "Barrens" (westfall) we don't have lions, we have murlocs, they swim.
---
Did you even watch the video? He is clearly 10 yards away when he vanishes.
---
Go with your friends. I prefer horde over alliance but the reality is my character is the center of the screen and 95% of the time I don't notice him minus whatever hair/helm he has on. All wow models are trash. If you have good friends who have similar mindset and goals then stick with them cause they are extremely hard to find. I can count the number of those kind of friends I have that still plays on zero hands.
---
I mean look at toep... 175 SP for 15 seconds (1 min 30 second cd)
---
That’s already in, big busted
---
Summoning guild members over a cliff so they walk/fall off, good times in Blackrock Mountain.
---
That's almost, like, a YOU problem.
---
I've added a bunch of people because i've done dungeons with them.
---
Also easier said than done.
---
But muh classic mythic+ strats! Gotta get that classic:r.io score :')
---
For PvE Id say:
---
- feral cat dps: dynamic powershifting
---
- Hunter: Autoshot rotation
---
- Fury Warrior: Heroic Strike toggle
---
I think with those player skill has the highest ceiling.
---
For PvP I dont really know.
---
That because at least one person got killed in the open world during TBC or Wrath, flying didn't kill PvP.
---
Screw that guy.
---
But for real, Tanks can do whatever they want in this meta.  It's a tank's world and we all just live in it when it comes to dungeons.  Just please don't be a fury tank. lol.
---
I had a similar experience in BRD. I was also in a PuG that got to Rag in 4h over the weekend. We didn't get Rag, but the whole raid didn't take very long.
---
Or add a scorpion way back and dying from the poison you can do nothing about (since damage ticks stops bandages)
---
I will take a look tonight. I doubt I had any idea that wall walking was even a thing back then
---
For healing priests atleast the trinket reward is MC level powerful or even more so. Its probably too soon to put that in a sunken temple quest reward.
---
I'm not a rogue but I definitely think that.
---
I suppose I could post in this thread, if nothing else than for entertainment of what may happen during the con.
---
lol you just made several assertions without backing them up or elaborating. Your poor communication and your attitude is toxic.
---
I just assume npcs can see your time played.
---
It still is relevant at least.  Helps on bosses since you'll never reach the effective hit cap for white attacks
---
Stopped playing my warrior as well. Constantly being asked to tank, then dps give no shit, start aoe the second they see something, blame me for aggro and then start flaming and I'm like "I just charged in when your entire mana bar was already empty"
---
It's part of the tank rules. He who tanks, makes the rules.
---
I think you forget alot of the classic players are casual and have a life. Play retail if you want progression every month at max lvl IMO. Classic is perfect with a slow pace
---
Correct behaviour. Tanks control the run. If a DPS pulls onto you, tell them not to do it again. If they do, quit. There's always another group, there aren't many tanks. Pull at your pace, not theirs.
---
But back in the days is not the same as now. Blizzard changed the talents and gear around.
---
how is hit on cd good lmao?
---
its an extra trueshot aura, there are better permanent ap trinkets out there
---
That obviously depends on how good your guild is. But i'm pretty confident many "lesser" guilds will have evenings of wipes come BWL.
---
27 runs at DM E for the healer belt, it didn’t dropped, went to MC and got the set belt.
---
10 runs DM N for the healer boots and it have 25% chance
---
On the other hand I got Second Wind trinket at third run and Briawood from Jed ubrs at third run.
---
You going to die in an all out fight. That sob hits like a truck. 
---
Your best chance is to cheese Anger once the adds are dead by wall jump kite.
---
Asmongold just downed rag yesterday with a pug filled with idiots. If they could do it, anyone can.
---
yeah that sounds about right, if you want to know why we do that. its not because we think your being rude or anything
---
its because your probably the 10th person to ask in the last 20minutes. the moment we start to make water for people, somehow every spell caster in the area comes out the woodwork asking for water. some of em arnt even max level, so imagine making water for a lvl 55+ then a lvl 30 comes up and you have to remember which spell made the lvl 25 water and so on and so forth.
---
oh shit i was totaly fixated at the dps number
---
ran out of the quests for the first part of redridge but not high enough for the eastern part of redridge
---
The only custom I've been exposed to is that the first person to tap it, gets it. 
---
Grey areas can be someone killing a mob in order to clear the vein, in that case the vein *should* go to the person that got there first (at least in my opinion).
---
Gonna have to disagree. For mages at least some pieces are straight up better than tier 1. Call me old fashioned, but I dont think 5-man loot should be superior to 40-man loot until *much* further down the road.
---
My favorite memory is how 12 yo me rerolled to a hunter from a warrior in vanilla after playing for a couple of levels when I had just started playing, the main reason being it took too long to run from enemy to enemy on the warrior, not realizing I had to purchase skills that helped with that issue, such as , Charge.
---
I suppose my favorite memory was the first time I came home from college after finals and stuff and being able to play without worrying about having to study or when I was going to sleep. I wish I could recreate the feeling of relaxation I got from playing right then, even though I'm a working adult now who has few such worries.
---
Mind you people complain about paladin tanks due to going oom and having no taunt. They arent considered viable despite having a dedicated talent tree. 
---
This isnt a memespec as much as an abandoned idea. Shaman could OT a caster where you have so much time to build threat a taunt isnt needed.
---
That being said, it might be possible - but why? For the lulz?
---
Idk man. You should recognize the best cc in the game and save your taunt when you see that.  I get giddy when I have a shadow priest mc’ing battle mages in strath live. They mc, spam the mobs aoe, and manage to pretty much kill both of the other mobs and the mc mob before mc is over.  If it’s not, I taunt it and we clean up the remainders. There is a similar mob in scarlet.  They probably started to mc skull to troll you.
---
what? i said all of the information you would need. 
---
you can disagree, but youre doing it in a... toxic way.
---
So the shortest reason I tank is because I am a warrior. Every warrior is a tank no matter what spec they are. I was shocked to see so many warriors who didn't even have a shield/1h in their bags.
---
Also dungeons always go smoothly when I tank. Whenever I let someone else tank, its always a disaster with multiple wipes. Generally nothing ever goes wrong when I tank.
---
The only thing that happens that really pisses me off is if I do a LoS pull and there is a caster mob that aggros to the healer before it can come around the corner to me. For whatever reason, every single healer is programmed to stand like a statue in the middle of the hallway getting fireblasted by the mob endlessly. All they have to do is walk to where I am to LoS the caster mob and it will run down so I can taunt it, but they never do it. They just stand there.
---
Isn't that the whole point? 🙂
---
What you need is to clean up your room and get some damned agency in your life. Puff up your chest like a lobster and stand by your choices! 
---
—JP
---
I like it being later because it makes leveling alt's more interesting later in the game for the more hardcore crowd. I'd be willing to bet too that people who aren't interested in raiding or PvP also aren't playing super hardcore and are probably not close to max level.
---
I kill them too with not much resists. I guess bad luck on your side
---
For all the people who actually have a life i disagree with this.. shit I'm not even 60 yet.
---
&gt; The Tier 0.5 sets will be an oddity completed by one or two people here and there, but largely ignored
---
I loved farming this stuff in late BC, early Wrath. Novelty gear to show off before a raid or in Org. 
---
And then they added transmogs and the tokens from the Faire.
---
Yeah.... After 20's VW will be much less effective and you should switch to Succubus or to Felpuppy after 30. 
---
Only good use of VW is a bait for large mob groups and super OP sacrifice shield for pvp.
---
Keep updating your wand as its your best dps after dots, untill you hit lvl 46.
---
At 46 you get Drain Life rank which is superior to wands.
---
Dont use Shadow Bolts without Nightfall progs. Its not worth it.
---
One mob.
---
Send the pet, then dots and then wand it.
---
Multiple mobs.
---
Do the above + fear juggle rest.
---
haha kudos dude. Let's indeed hope that others can learn from this too!
---
yes the same reason I'm not using Frostshock, generally speaking slows are always a bad idea doing something like this as they cause the mobs to desync.
---
the more the mobs desync and split up because of it the less time you have to do the ledge jump and the more likely you are to die.
---
Mages are the exeption to this rule as they can garantie that all mobs are slowed at the same time for the same amount of time, Earthbind Totem is just too unreliable (mostly because of mobpathing RNG).
---
Paladin+Warrior. Pump the warrior up with gear and chain pull open world
---
Yeah, our next one is going to a feral druid.   So that will be a huge improvement.
---
Assuming the tank is a warrior. Oof
---
Typically I only summoned core roles free such as tanks and healers. But DPS (especially mages) have to pay per shard.
---
They use bots to level
---
I always communicate with the healer when tanking and if he keeps saying pull more, I do.
---
Yeah they are definitely missing opportunities to learn from their past mistakes.
---
It's probably because the community knows more about the history and design philosophies of the original game than the authors now. It's really sad.
---
Tank who go slowly in dungeon aren't a problem at all! The problem are believing-PGM who think it's faster to pull 50 mobs at a time without checking mana in the group... So many bad tanks in wow classic atm you are so happy when you find one who do fine
---
Pretty sure it has to have been deleted within a certain time period but if I'm wrong lmk
---
And as a Warrior tank I prefer Priest healers. Priests &gt; Shamans &gt; Druids.
---
Not yellow enough, try coming down to Lubbock Texas for a day and you will feel right at home.
---
na you ded if you try that :D
---
same with trying to kill the pet, its a complete waste of time and only works vs bad hunters
---
No. This community needs to learn that not every group experience will be the same. Just because one group went fast doesn't mean all groups will be turbo cleave. The real tragedy is that I'm sure the mage didn't learn shit, and will continue behaving like a jackass with other groups.
---
Except you didnt DO anything ... you just exchanged existing loot for new loot.
---
Thats a really silly position.
---
Armory in one pull, hm? Then where was Herod then? 
---
*\*Snorts and pushes up glasses\**
---
I have 4 bars of experience to get 25 gold to get my mount right at 40. Besides earth elementals in badlands, which were an absolute PvP warzone last night, whats the best thing I can do to get the gold as soon as possible?
---
Only time I’ve abandoned a group as tank is when 2 of the DPS started bickering over nothing. They were being incredibly toxic. One of them was corpse running (halfway through strat live) and I just hearthed out. I whispered apologies to the healer and other dps, and they were pretty understanding. Saw them recruiting for another tank while I was joining an UBRS group, but idk if they finished.
---
Or bring an enhance shaman
---
I'm a priest and want 2x freezing band for pvp.
---
It's okay as long you don't get pissy if it happens one time. Some tanks are too touchy.
---
i was trying to farm the heart of the mountain enchanting recipe from lord roccor which is one of the best trinkets for druid tank. it like never dropped for me, but once it did, a mage and priest both rolled on it with the reasoning "im enchanting too". but it doesnt matter if you are enchanting because you would never actually use that trinket. its bop to the person who makes it. you cant sell it or anything
---
Frozen wrath is better than raid gear for mages. That's just classic itemization.
---
Hi, /u/AnxiousOmar
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dopxc0/molten_core_loot_which_items_are_better_for_which/). 
---
No, I get that there is no gold incentive. I'm asking what the social incentive is for the tank to stay. Allowing and encouraging bad behavior seems to me that it will have the opposite effect of what you're trying to accomplish by having the tank stay.
---
If they are in leveling gear, they will need a dps to come with them.  You have to be pretty geared to 2 man jump runs.
---
Get better at reading.  They do Amazing BOSS Dps.   We have few hunters 2-3 in most raids, and they're in the top 5 more than almost any other group.       
---
       
---
Some bosses the Hunter's take the top spots EVERY time.       
---
They point is,  They're better then most at DPS,   They're kit is huge.   They have more utility than any other class.   They can do almost everything better then any other class besides some very specific (mostly pvp) things.    
---
Show me another class that can do EVERYTHING a Hunter can do.     
---
Hunter's have too much.
---
I honestly haven't tried, trying the kiting method atm.
---
AH but you're making the classic mistake of forgetting about the dual wielding survival hunter
---
Alliance but ya, I feel your pain.
---
Ah tried to solo farm just Herod for ravager on my 52 warr but kept Aggroing a few guys on the way so it wasn’t efficient. I guess I wasn’t patient enough to realize pats will move on and there is a clear way.
---
The most vocal people are usually the people with the most time, so they don't give a fuck about your time or any QoL improvements.
---
Probably around May actually.
---
same! except that I decided to go on a cruise for fun. And yah the horde are *aggressive*. It's fun for pvp but probably would seriously mess with fishing. They already try at the docks
---
You are using a lvl 51 Weapon: 3.8 Speed; 123min - 185 max
---
You are using Windfury Weapon Rank 3 (lvl 50)
---
You are hitting lvl 51-52 skeletal mages.
---
I see that you have hit the mob maximum at 205 dmg no crit, this would make your minimum at around 143, but the minimum i see is actually 156. Glancing blow occur 20% of the time against mobs of your level (same as windfury). Glancing blow deal 75% damage or 205\*0.75 is 153: A glancing blow for you should be lower than 153, so you havent made any, which is odd.
---
You have made 7 melee critical strikes in this data you show, but zero windfury proc, while windfury should be at 20% and critical strike around 10%-15%, which is odd.
---
Could it be that you have already reached the proc per minute maximum and are now waiting for the next minute to start?
---
*if windfury is 20% its 640 hits per hour at 1.00 speed or 240 hits per hour at 3.0 speed or 189 hits per hour at 3.8 speed-&gt; 3.16 hits per minute* 
---
*3600 seconds in one hour, at 1 speed thats 3600 hits, and windfury will proc 20% of those 3600 hits.*
---
*at 3.8 speed you only have 947 hits in one hour, and 189 hits will be windfury procs. When you put this on a minute you divide it by 60, and you end up with around 3.16 hits per minute or 3 windfury procs every 57 seconds.* 
---
You would take advantage of a slow weapon by using more instant attacks like stormstrike. Otherwise you'd be better off with a 2.1-3.1speed  2-hander.
---
Also WoW works with a table-based attack resolution system:
---
glancing blow take precedence on critical strike
---
I would assume that critical strikes take precedence on windfury proc since windfury only happens on ordinary hits.
---
This mean that when fighting the skeleton sorcerer your attack table might look like this:
---
Miss 10%
---
Mob Dodges 10%
---
Mob Parries 10%
---
Glancing Blow 10-20%
---
Block 0%
---
Critical hit 15%
---
Crushing Blow 0%
---
Ordinary hit 100%-65%=35%
---
So 35% of your hits will be ordinary hits, and with a proc per minute of 3.16 every 60 seconds, that means thats 35% of 3.16 its around 1.1 proc per minute with your weapon on this mob.
---
I have also encountered similar dead zones with a paladin procs Seal of Command, but Seal of Command procs on any attack, even on glancing blows, parry, dodges and miss.
---
Windfury says "each hit" which is considered weapon "ordinary hit" = non-crit, white hit.
---
Let us say it accepts critical strikes as "hit" that would only push it to around 50%, so 1.6 proc per minute.
---
If you don't want to raid or pvp, then why are you playing classic WoW?
---
Unfortunately, while those are the minimum you can do those dungeons, most groups won't take you if there's someone with a higher level available. Especially in Strat and Scholo, it can be very easy to facepull an extra pack.
---
But if you don't raid, you SHOULD be far behind raiders.
---
TiL. I've been pasting and cutting in paint 😭
---
If you have a high level alt, invest in gear, potions and food. Won't cost much and makes life easier. Once you reach 30, you can comfortably farm 2 mobs at once
---
no changes tho
---
I can't tell you how much +hit it's worth, but yes it means you need less spell hit to cap. In classic there is no "miss" for a spell it's either resisted or not and +hit lowers the chance to be resisted.
---
Just hopping in to say you can probably throw a Berserker rage into every pull in a dungeon(and most solo pulls) make a macro that shows berserker rage tooltip, switches to berserker stance and then casts berserker rage. From there you can probably whirlwind to pull more threat from the mobs your group is not targetting then swap to defensive and start your tab-sunder. Also a macro that switches to berserker rage and then casts pummel when tanking with a 2 Hander or dual wield is a must-have for interrupts, just make sure you get back in defensive if you need too.
---
Opening would be charge&gt;bers macro(while charging)&gt;demo shout&gt;whirlwind&gt;defensive stance&gt;bloodrage(if available)&gt;tab sunder.
---
Bloodrage may need to happen in bers stance if you want to whirlwind, depends on the size and type of pull.  Also try tanking dungeons with 2h If you are arms spec, itll still work for a dozen or so levels if you're 40
---
It takes one wipe to more than destroy any gains from skipping a couple of packs. There are obvious packs people can skip, where there's like 30 feet between a static pack and the pathway you need to go, but if you have to jump ledges and parkour to skip a couple of packs it's simply not worth it.  
---
If you can do some light parkour and skip 6+ packs....completely different story.  Like jumping from the ledge into the lava in LBRS where you can shave like 30 minutes of the dungeon clear time off by skipping totally meaningless packs.
---
Hunters are pretty complicated, as are warlocks.  
---
Druids are pretty complicated too- PVE rotation for cats takes some getting used to, and PVP is really interesting cuz you can effectively switch between 3 forms all the time depending on situation.  You can also be a friendly dispel bot, offensive root/faerie fire, heals, offensive damage (cat) or offensive utility (bear stun/feral charge)
---
No, on the mangos emulator on private servers it sold for 50s. It never sold for 50s in "vanilla".
---
Guy with me the other night by Ulda. We did greater earth elementals. Appreciated the help. Afterwards went to do some easier quests like scrap metal off ogres. Found black dragons nearby. Killed like 10. Whelping dropped. He loots since it's only white loot. I tell him wow that's rare...and really expensive. He just keeps it. No roll or anything. I was a little salty since he was just sort of tagging along with me at that point. I didn't need help and didnt ask for it. He has already done those quests. Sadness.
---
You might like the smell but if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen
---
Sorry I don't really feel that way just wanted to use that phrase lol
---
I really hope Blizzard gives the Night Elves another shot at having a city on retail.  I love the Night Elf aesthetic. Just a cool place to hang out.
---
BWL will be tougher than MC so I'd expect pugs to struggle more with the organisation and tactics needed.
---
However the top guilds will have it beat in the first week almost definitely. Especially those coming from private servers.
---
I did bwl back in vanilla but I really can't remember much about it. Something to do with a chess board that my guild spent days/weeks wiping on.   
---
It'll be tougher but not as tough as it was originally because the general quality of the average player is higher..
---
I remember the first time I sold a crafted green ring on the auction house in TBC. 11 year old me was so happy.
---
Just forget about it and keep leveling. You’ll get it when you get it.
---
At the time, I was too geeked out, lol.  Phone was nearby.
---
Lol, bend it any way you want.. Man-hours? Who calculates a drop for them by man hours?
---
Also, you assume no one will need it from Onyxia, if even one person does then you need to factor that in... Also 5 day reset.
---
If u don't count the reset then u need to factor in that you can do an arena run in like 7 minutes, then log onto an alt and farm something else etc until the reset is up and log back in...
---
You're really stretching here.
---
Yes. And it has always been. Just not for tank swap fights, and still not possible.
---
If it's the same account you cannot, you would have to have two separate WoW accounts to have both logged on simultaneously
---
Buntards. They love national league baseball.
---
Non raiders? Either you play the content you have (raids) or you can fk off to another game. raids are the big part of wow you cant just have some of the biggest part of content left out, and then complain about how there is not enough content. Wtf
---
warrior bad 🦀
---
Stranglethorn PvP while leveling. It will be extremely fun in Classic once we get the Honor system.
---
Which drain life ranks are you referring to? The rank of the spell itself of talents?
---
I hate this stuff. Seems like the idea of efficiency is to always go-go-go as fast as possible, risking wipes in every pull, with the goal of being Uber fast. It generally isn't. It is generally annoying and not very fun. 
---
Also, IMHO, this mentality is highly propelled by streamers that calculate every single detail to get as much gold/xp/loot/BiS per second. Feels like a job, TBH.
---
Ok, so I'm a Tauren arms warrior and atm rock the Dreadforge Retaliator. Last UBRS run Blackhand Doomsaw dropped for me and I kinda dig how it looks + polearms are cool.
---
All BiS guides tell me DF Retaliator is a better choice, but could any argument be made favoring wielding the Doomsaw? It DOES have higher listed DPS...
---
What is the point of getting a 0.5 dungeon set if you don’t raid or pvp? Clearly people don’t care about gear if they don’t raid or pvp. This just sounds like you want your 0.5 set because you do crap dps, I really don’t understand with all the loot available why you want this set so bad and so soon. They are attempting to give us as authentic of an experience they can.
---
I'm not too worried about how long it takes for me to hit 60 so leveling progression isnt something I am too worried about. Just set a goal when I started to get my mount at 40 and hoping to get it haha. Will try that spot though
---
Yeah nothing to see here me and several others were saying this well before the timeline got established. Beat down by the #nochanges crowd.
---
its just weird because when i attack people they move? i don't get how standing in the corner makes this okay without it being a glitch or exploit
---
How dare other people have opinions!
---
Just level more.  The single easiest way to farm gold faster is to fight higher level monsters
---
Probably was making up for my time working on Invincible....
---
Just curious what part is hard?  I 2 manned it for a bit with a random mage he kited aoe pulls but mostly tanked the bosses except the last one where we did some z axis shenanigans.  Is the last boss the problem without good ranged dps?
---
Oh boy, good luck for Solenor, I found it the toughest of the 4 demons back in 2005!
---
Define serious. I was a fairly hardcore player in BC and Wrath but stopped because i had a baby. That was almost 10 years ago now and I definitely would like to raid, but now I have three children and if they take a long time going to sleep, I can't get up and just leave them. Similarly, if any of them wake up in the night, I may need to stop what I am doing to soothe them back to sleep.  I can't do that in a "serious" raiding guild, but I would still like to raid in pugs or as a backup player from time to time when my schedule allows.  But I cannot sign up for raids because my kids always come first, and I don't want to sign up for something and then be 45 minutes late because bedtime went off the rails. So I am definitely not a "serious" raider, but I would still love to have up to date gear that would enable me to jump into relevant content when I can.
---
What is karma even for. lol
---
at 60 can a warrior and feral druid solo Mara Princess?
---
This is thinking small. We going 40x pally power
---
just think of what you will enjoy more. for example, i love being a support, so that would be paladin or shaman, and since my friends are in alliance i play paladin
---
after all, the most important thing is that the class/race combination feels good to you; you can always make new friends in classic
---
Back during Vanilla, I didn't get into WoW until 2006 -- it had been out over a year by then. Then it took me 6-8 months to reach level 60. Everyone was still talking about Molten Core and Onyxia then, almost 2 years after the game's release.
---
Even when The Burning Crusade came out, people were still running MC and Ony. There will always be people climbing, before, with, and after you/me/us (I'm just level 40). I really think the only people who might move on from caring about what you're interested in are those who are hardcore pushers who, honestly, probably wouldn't be fun to experience the icons with (for non-hardcore pushers).
---
Especially while leveling you don't have to min-max. 
---
At max Level you can look at a guide. See what Overall stats you should aim for (I'm sure you'll know that by the time anyway) and then start gearing.
---
That will also give you an idea of what dungeons you should be running for decent gear.
---
You are totally good after that.
---
No Need for min-maxing really. Plenty of People like you that just want to Play and they still get along great.
---
probably due to the xp split of having a 60 in group
---
That's pretty shitty....
---
Another option would be to state that you leave if they don't kick him. That way you give the others a chance to finish the dungeon. After all it's not their fault. But overall your reaction is understandable.
---
You ca't ask other people what right or wrong is. You have to consider yourself what you believe it to be.
---
Would you be okay with someone else doing it in your group? Are you willing to face the consequences that will result from your action? If you can answer yes to both, then in your ethical view, it's an acceptable thing to do.
---
No. This is expected and understood by every reasonable fury warrior. They do not want to tank for whatever reason (ping, lazyness, performance anxiety), so it's their loss. Roll on tank gear, roll on dps gear, and kick any warrior that steals your tank gear to the fucking curb.
---
They honestly should change the time line of Wow Classic.  Make it more interesting.  It should be its own iteration of Vanilla. We have 15 years of hindsight to plan this correctly even if it doesn't come in the order it originally did.  It should be its own tale re-puzzled to fit correctly.  
---
The OP is correct.
---
Do I have to shit while pressing Win+S or is it a special button not everyone has?
---
Still on over 4000 dreaming whelps for the emerald one. Can you give me some rng?
---
I always wanted to role an elderly, Gandalf-esque mage, but this always would throw me off that course .
---
Obviously not
---
It sounds like you're on a pvp server, so I would recommend dungeon grinding. SM, with a good group that's dedicated to do as many runs as possible (needs to be worth the effort of getting up there and running through the inevitable horde army camped there). Make sure you empty your bags as much as you can before you go, and have as big of bags as you can reasonably acquire. Just by vendoring the greys and greens you win there, you'll make a couple g a run (I think Cathedral averaged me 4-5g a run, factoring the odd blue I'd win).
---
I did. Until I did all content.
---
I've met far fewer stupid hunters in classic than I met back in vanilla. As many people have said, mages are the new hunters when it comes to really dumb behavior that hurts the group.
---
What does sword of seal usually go for?
---
Yasssssssss
---
You are wrong in every regard.
---
That's understandable. I think the curiosity comes from the fact that it would take as long to farm t.5 as it would to just find a guild and get into a groove with raiding though. Maybe not as high as Naxx, because the prep time for raids is much higher, but MC/Ony/BWL/ZG/AQ20 are going to be relatively easy.
---
You dont even need a pet. I leveled mine with my imp phased the entire time. Just dot and drain tank.
---
Not at all. I do the same stuff as a healer. If a dps pulls a pack I let them die. I'll be happy to rez, but your idiocy will cost you that 10% repair bill 💁🏼‍♀️
---
Yep...I went to great lengths to point out "they are a 1:3000 drop. Really rare". No fucks given.
---
I lost a BRE in a pug the other week and this comment is giving me all kinds of PTSD from that. I think a level 59 warrior won it, I mean it's a fair roll and good for him but I know in my heart my loser min maxing ass would put that to better use any day D:
---
What’s your S strike macro? Does it trigger auto attack before hand? Can you post please?
---
When I found the entrance to deadmines first time, I couldn't get in, too high step. Thought it was bugged, had to google. Finally went inside, carefully made my way to the precious tin ore deposits, and saw a strange portal. I hesitated, not knowing where it would teleport me. Went in, found myself in the same kind of cave. Strange. Went back and hearthed away to smelt the tin ore. That was like a month ago
---
I had about 6 real life friends that raided together in vanilla.  Our pally in the group loved to divine intervention the hunter (not real life friend) who was the designated puller right before he would pull.  It always got the guy confused and then briefly fired up.  The raid wasn't too serious and always laughed about it.  It never got old.  I always laugh when I think back on it.
---
If you're aware of British slang, munter=ugly woman.
---
The Devs have always been out of touch, except when it comes to trying to make money.  What you end up with are careless and poorly thought out decisions.  Be it certain items or content, all they care about it trying to make more money than they did yesterday.
---
Where's the **shit** key?
---
as a mage... no. you were not wrong to leave.
---
Well I didn't play back in the day. First time I played was in BFA. But the most memorable moment in Classic WoW was the day my friends joined to play with me, even though it only lasted 2 weeks and then they quit. I got to taste that MMORPG with friends feeling. I've played a lot of games with them, it's always nice to have your RL friends sharing those moments!
---
The best back in the day was the SomethingAwful forums guild on Mal Ganis realm. But you had to be a member of Somethingawful forums.
---
If you have both Dal'rends swords, the set bonus makes them suparior to Flurry/Deepwoods, but the difference is minor. This is because Bloodthirst is based on AP, not weapon damage.
---
Haha, oops. Fixed.
---
But yes you must be shitting while pressing the combination.
---
Havent seen a healer being able to negotiate deals like tanks can for blessing the group with their presence. Until you can yoink a much larger share of the spoils as a healer you're valued less than a tank
---
I like the capital and Zone Names, but the chat seems to much imo.
---
Grouping with other locks and getting my 💯 steed back in vanilla! It was a blast
---
😢
---
A voidwalker is totally doable!
---
Your problem is you're starting with immolate.  Immo does a big burst of up front threat, and your voidwalker doens't have time to cast it's taunt (torment) which does a static amount of threat. 
---
Try this rotation instead
---
Pull with COA + send voidwalker
---
corruption
---
life tap
---
immolate
---
wand wand wand!
---
shadow bolt as necessary once corr/immo drop off if you need to do some more damage. 
---
The VW is all about striking a balance. If you do too much damage too quick you will pull aggro and the meatshield is  useless.  Where a VW excels is in consistent, steady damage where you aren't taking any hits and can life tap/bandage to sustain yourself.  Occasional bandage on your voidwalker, or consume shadows.  
---
Also don't be afraid to turn off VW taunt if it has plenty of threat lead or when the monster is low HP. 
---
The VW will be MUCH more effective if you have 8 points in demo for improved VW (+30% torment effectiveness).
---
Are Arcanum's one use items?
---
Sounds like something imma learn reaaaaal fuckin quick when I hit 50!
---
lol
---
Smooth AF leveling experience, and unlike hunters I actually bring utility!
---
Yes, but also during the daytime. It isn't until afternoon that it gets busy.
---
I'm an enh sham and have a mage leveling partner. We try to look for dungeons we can quickly and easily 2-man for quick cash but we'd never be able to pull this off since shams have zero aoe threat generation
---
MC was created in a week
---
Hi, /u/Designed_To
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/doq7n2/when_i_take_even_one_step_into_the_barrens/). 
---
&gt; Do I just split the graves into 3 separate pulls done on foot? I aggro the boss before starting so that the zombies go to him, as videos instruct.
---
Yes, you can't do the mount strategy without epic mount. Pull one row of zombies --&gt; iceblock --&gt; kill. Pull second row --&gt; cold snap --&gt; iceblock --&gt; kill. Pull what is remaining and kill it without ice block.
---
&gt; Is there any precise technical guidance on how to do this?
---
The cone shoots out in whatever direction you are facing when you hit the button. It sounds like you have your character turned because you are strafing rather than facing the mobs as you hit it.
---
I meant health bars over the mob's head. Right now they are under their base model and would prefer if they are over their head.
---
Mist of pandaria boomkin playstyle. One of the very few good things in the later expansions but that was spot on and so much fun to play.
---
He was just replying to the fact that Alli keep killing Thrall, and not the other way around.
---
This kind of a problem in retail too. Boralus -&gt; Shrine of the Storm has me fly over the dungeon, get the debuff, and end up stunned and teleported as I'm landing. 
---
Every time.
---
Regardless you should be speccing into it. Anything that reduces resist chance or miss chance should be on your gear or talents for raids, since missing a 800+ dmg spell is not good.
---
Also side note, if I do remember correctly a lock used to be able to debuff your shadow resistance to the negatives to increase their shadow damage to people with negative resistance, not sure if that's still in game or not.
---
Two questions:
---
I just hit level 35 as a mage (horde) last night. I'm at 2 days 12 hours played. Is that reasonable?
---
Also I'm finding quests to consistently be higher level than I'd prefer. Just finished the 31/33 stv stuff and I'm seeing solid 35-37+ stuff. Should I run specific wings of the monastery now?
---
Thanks!
---
Time and money lost from wiping is massive. That people value saving seconds over risking minutes and gold is mindbogglingly stupid and definitely comes from a modern retail mindset. There's corpse running, repairs, rebuffing and walking back to where you died, often more than once if your in one of these "special" groups.
---
World PvP doesn't die with BGs because people still need to access the world for their activities, be it Raid, Dungeons, World Bosses, World Buffs, Farming and yes, some people will still roam the world looking for PvP.
---
The difference in P2 is the hardcore rankers will be out in the world while in P3+ they'll be in BGs and "natural" PvP will occur instead of farming kills.
---
Can confirm. Happened to me this time around, too. Farmed one for hours in vanilla and when I was walking through Wetlands for Kargath flight path I figured I'd walk by and kill one for old times sake. Dropped on my first kill and my drop luck at 60 has been horrible ;\_;
---
100% agree. My personal rationale was that it would allow me and my group a friend's to stay relevant and not have to do 40 man content since there's less than 10 of us. Also gives you a reason to keep running dungeons after getting your 'pre-raid BiS'.
---
This is what I meant
---
I outrolled 6 warriors and 3 feral druids.   Get wrecked nerds.
---
Well my pally is a bit lower than you with lv 32 at the Moment but i fed hin with Blues gear like this Blue fire proc Axe for lv 28 dont remember the name rightnow but with good gear and a Bit luck ur a Monster in wpvp.Yesterday i was attacked by a lv 34 warlock with his captain bluesack and i got realy lucky as i judged soc in him criting,Soc up again autohit crit,soc proc crit +weapon fireball proc deleting him from 100 to 0.he than Used soulstone only to go Down in 1 gcd again.god i felt strong
---
No.  Spell misses show up as a full resist which is only mitigated by spell hit.  Spells can hit, but only deal partial damage due to enemy resistance which is what this talent can reduce.
---
This is what I do. 34 points in fury. I dual wield dps and tank when needed. If you have engineering, bombs are amazing as a tank for holding aoe threat. Just make sure you have a full set of tank gear. Tons of my dps pieces are leather.
---
If you're on windows, you can use the sniping tool. Just search snip in the box below, click new, and save. I use it all the time.
---
I play retail as dps/heals and that stuff pisses me off still. You were right to leave, mage was an unrespectful impatient douche.
---
Wow very handsome orc also :) very nice taste of looking :) mmm i like it. handsome beard very nice :) with new sword
---
People who complain they don't have time in retail dungeons is one thing, but in Classic there's literally no excuse
---
Never piss off the tank. Going to spend the next hour looking for a new one...
---
What's your days played? To me playing anything over 2 hours a day is no lifer. Not 2 hours WHEN you play but averaging 2 hours a day. You're literally choosing not to go out and do other things and instead are spending the majority of your free time on WoW.
---
I say this as someone with like 25 days played, by the way.
---
Yes, mages don't use a ton of T1, because other raid gear is better, NOT because other pre-raid gear is better.
---
There are some slots where the pre-raid gear is better than the raid gear, such as the briarwood reed. But for most slots, the stuff you get in MC is going to be better than anything from 5-mans.
---
I guess they would rather not have a tank then to have them tank???????   ouch... Leave that guild  =)
---
It’s clear that you’ve never played classic. You don’t have to do mathematical equations in classic to figure out if the thousands of items you receive is actually relevant. And like I said you actually have a reputation in the game in the server community.
---
40 is nice because every level until then gives you interesting talents and you get new abilities.
---
After 40 it's mostly your 2nd talent tree which isn't that interesting, and you're rarely getting anything new or part of the core of your class, just rank-ups. It isn't at all as fun.
---
So reward people that don't put time in? That's retail shit.
---
Lol isnt that the pve end game of wow ?
---
He also "accidentally" needed a pair of gloves that he was already wearing.  This caused our warrior tank, who wanted them for his main spec, to refuse to go on unless we kicked him. It didn't look like it was an add-on either, because he greeded and passed on other items.
---
1. Remove titanforging and reintroduce the concept of BIS gear. There should be some finality to the grind throughout the xpac.
---
2. Remove the azerite power grind, or drastically reduce it. Have it be consistent across characters so alts aren’t always so far behind.
---
3. Expand the talent system. I don’t expect full on talent trees, but at least 2-3 more rows of talents.
---
I’ll check it out regardless, but these are my top 3 changes that would have me genuinely excited about the next xpac.
---
Alright, this makes sense. Thanks for explaining!
---
I would stay skinning until you at least have all of the mats you will need to level engineering purchased and stashed in the bank.
---
god have you ever heard of Google?
---
Spoon feed me Information please
---
There were quests, bosses, stuff to do. That WAS the thing to do.
---
Switch over when you have difficulty healing dungeons groups.  Depending on gear/skill, you can heal dungeon leveling groups all the way to 60.  I swapped at like 54ish and thought it was too early.  Just make sure to supplement with max level water you can use and some extra mana pots.  Realistically, I'd swap at 58 or so.
---
Well my even more unpopular opinion is that I hope they will release BGs asap. I still have some things do (finishing Hydraxian Waterlords, getting my Lock Epic Mount) but that's basically it. That leaves 2-3 hours of raiding every week or playing alts. BGs will solve this...
---
I know, hence my opening line (which addresses his question):
---
&gt;10-15 gold is not much in the end, I **would not sweat this one**. *That said*, **for the future**:
---
The rest is more food for thought for when he reaches a bit higher level and might face the scenario I outlined in the section which you are referring to.
---
But , #nochanges??
---
Enhancement is a meme spec, just like Ret.
---
Pvp vendors and regular class balance updates for competitive arena.
---
Taking the Zeppelin to UC after playing for days near Orgrimmar and just being absolutely mine blown when I realised how big and the varied the world was, and how little if it I'd seen. Never been so excited in a video game
---
I'm too casual, and don't want to play resto.   They are rad dudes and I hope they dominate in the upcoming content releases, but I'm at home with &lt;edema ruh&gt;.
---
Make Azerite Essences account-wide
---
LOL, underrated comment
---
I was a custodian for 50 years, but now it's high-time I show these whipper-snapper kobolds what's what.
---
Yeah, I use it all the time at work.  Just wasn't thinking correctly at the time.  I loved this little guy back in the day, and to get him in about 10 mins blew my mind.
---
Getting 2200 for the first time in 3v3 on my rogue in Wrath :D
---
People this time around are so hyperfocused on min/max, they don't simply want to have fun. People keep saying that the community is amazing on WoW Classic, but all I ever see are toxic tryhards.
---
To play two at once?
---
I've played classic since its release.  But this week I needed a break and got back into retail.  Whay really captures my attention is following a story line.   It feels more purposeful.  However I know after 2 weeks of just grinding out rep, daily quests and dungeons, I'll probably get bored of it again.
---
That's racist.
---
Awesome, cant wait. I raided tbc/wotlk and never vanilla and doing MC was a huge letdown.
---
Thanks for the replies.
---
Favorite WoW memory is questing in Grizzly Hills after a long day in high school. Used to play with the windows open during the winter so I could feel the cold breeze and immerse myself even more.
---
So much this. I had a tank leave our Mara run after one wipe because hunter’s pet pulled half of the dungeon. Like dude, the rest of the group had nothing to do with it, I spend my own 3g to summon your ass here because you didn’t have a FP and then you leave like that? Fuck that.
---
I'd love to see your raid bis list for mages in current content that doesn't use a single piece of T1 gear lol
---
It's a toss up between teleporting and free water. There's so much money saved by being able to do both.
---
I can't go back to daily grinds after classic. I love that playtime between raids is OPTIONAL. For once, I can play WoW and join my friends in other games or rl without feeling guilty about my neck/weapon AP level, or not getting that day's chunk of rep. 
---
Ironically, I still play classic more than I would retail - but it's because the objectives I chase are chosen by me, rather than pushed on me.
---
Yeah, I've already tempered my expectations for the rest of my time in Classic, lol.
---
Holy shit thank you
---
Nah, friend, you good.  If he can't do his job without trying to do yours and then you get smack talked at you. It's perfectly legit to leave.
---
Fury warrior who wants truestrike/rend swords can tank, rogue or 2, mage or 2, maybe a warlock, healer. 
---
I’m the fury warrior in this scenario. I reset UBRS til i find jed, then run it 6-7 man. Still waiting for shoulders. I got the UBRS key so I can start the group myself amd pick who comes.
---
it's almost like different people have different opinions
---
Gratz on having 3 60 toons. 
---
now what? sit around? wait for 2 years as the content slowly rolls out?   
---
this isnt Retail. you're not getting any gear or e-peen at endgame that we all haven't seen. it doesnt really matter to me how much time you spend gaming, and I Still think getting 3 60's this quickly is impressive regardless of how much time you play... but to what end? 
---
I realize that everyone wants to play classic for a different reason, but i dont understand when that reason is to rush to endgame and raid - as fast as possible.   
---
I mean.. all the strats are available, and all the secrets of the game have been discovered (mostly) so, there's no real "Challenge" to this. I mean, that's the Retail mindset, and if that's the mindset, why not just stay in Retail? 
---
Now, Im not saying that the rush for server first isnt fun or whatever - but once that's done, and unless youre in a guild that already has a raiding plan and strat put together and you are helping with that...  but other than that? 
---
but, hey - it's your 4ish, no wait 5.5 hours a day plus weekends when youre not skating to and from the gym.. so, my opinion means Literally nothing here.
---
You can go further south along the coast, there's only a few pirates you have to run past, but I've had my best luck for stonescale eel near them.
---
That said, right now Ony pugs are a very real thing. I couldn't do our scheduled ony night last week so I pugged it. It formed and killed Ony in under an hour, first pull.
---
I probably will play retail when the xpac drops, but as usual it will be for a few weeks after launch. Since there is no point gearing, i will probably do a story and a raid once and I'm gone.
---
Read before comment please... I have searched in Google mr.smart
---
You can use the gearing list for Prot. While also grabbing the Threat marked gear and some Fury DPS items. 
---
Prioritize getting crit to 20%ish while still maintaining a decent Defense bonus. 340-350 might be good enough I'd have to look it over again.
---
If you are Human or Orc using your racial bonus weapons keep your hit at 6% minimum but even as high as 12% and beyond is fantastic, especially if you arent utilizing the HS Toggle method for offhand swings.
---
TL;DR Gear like a Prot warrior and swap out TPS gear when appropriate.
---
If I ever see that play executed, I'm not even gonna be mad, that's just smart as hell.
---
He didn’t. He said it was for his off spec.
---
Countless hours spent fighting in AV!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_azvBdVgz0
---
Watch that Video
---
There is no BIS list in General.
---
You take tank gear. Which is your prot bis list above.
---
After that you add fury gear and swap shield for weapon.
---
Find out what works (where you take too much damage - where you could take more damage)
---
Find out if it is even needed first. If you are asking for a build. Chances are you are not even Close to make this build efficient or to even have to use this build. You Need a lot of DPS for this to be worthwhile (I mean your DPS Need to be geared well) and your healers too...
---
I have done that a couple times when being impatient, then I get myself killed inevitably and apologize with my tail between my legs.
---
Getting my War Raptor mount.
---
Playtime is subjective. Some people would call that fast, some slow.
---
STV has early 30s and late 30s stuff; very little in between. For the mid range you can head to Arathi Highlands or Desolace, or just farm SM if you prefer.
---
And blizzard will suffer the lack of foresight by having less players. it will be all accounted for by the universe.
---
Look up minimum specs, hit the local pawn shop.. that's about the cheapest you're gonna find probably
---
I know everyone emphasizes orcs here but i am a 60 Tauren warrior and I use a flurry axe. I don't think I'll replace it until I get raid weapons.
---
It's amazing for fury OH and a ridiculous prot MH. I still use thrash blade as well, I don't think there's anything that can replace these two weapons until raid
---
Is the play experience that different on Horde vs Alliance? I have a 31 Human priest on a pvp server, but part of me wants to roll a troll priest somewhere else.
---
Maybe I should roll a shaman? That way I'm experiencing the horde without releveling a class I already have.
---
My favourite moment in WoW was when I net my nemsis.
---
Was leveling my first toon ( Troll Hunter) during WoTLK. While questing around STV I stumbled across a human warrior slaying a poor Hordie. He finished him quickly and headed towards me. We fought, but he won. 
---
During my few days in STV I kept stumbling this fellah, sometimes I won and sometime he did. Those fights kept going during my entire leveling process all the way up to 80.
---
For some time I didnt cross him anymore. Then, during a BG, I see my old nemsis. My health was already low from a previous fight and he made his way towards me.  I was certain I was done for. Suddenly he stopped, bowed and started eating. And so did I..... after regaining full health we gave our bows again and fought. 
---
After this BG, everytime we met, we would have this unspoken code of honor. 
---
Cheers and good luck!
---
Yeah and the perma cheetah. Nice job though!
---
My favorite wow wow moment was either getting Realm First Cooking for Cataclysm (/flex) or obtaining Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest.
---
AQ hammer + bag of Whammies/Tome of Knowledge is better on average, and until we get agi to 2h Maul is better for counterweight apparently. Staff is a great pickup and for pure mitigation is bis for all of classic though
---
This.
---
Your job of tank is to pull and set the pace of the dungeon. If everyone agrees to go faster, then you can go faster ... while still being the one who still pulls and leads.
---
Personally, I would not have left the group. Instead, I'd just let that mage tank until he gets the message. That's why I'm grateful to be playing a druid. My spec allows me to both tank well and dps ... and I have no problem with dpsing if someone else wishes to tank for me ;)
---
yea that is definitely part of it.  But I usually don't see the same mob resist that many times.  Just extremely unlucky I guess.

Nope, being an asshole in Classic should have consequences. Tanks sets pace. You gave fair warning. He decided to be a D Bag. So you left. Was a teaching moment. If he didn’t learn from it it’s on him.
---
Kind of, should have ask the other to kick him first and if other do not try to help yes. You just screwed the other 3 for no little reasons when they could have agreed
---
This is how the retail problems began, asking for things like this.
---
That's always how these posts go. Using a single screenshot to frame an entire battle into whatever spin they want to put on it.
---
Classic does not have alternate progression paths like retail. You cannot be serious about endgame without being in a guild, raiding every week on a schedule. Without raiding, you can't get very good gear, and what good pieces drop are a fluke, rather than reliable. 'Playing endgame seriously' means you are foing everything in your power to enhance your character. Playing seriously and playing without raiding are mutually exclusive in Classic.
---
The throughput gap between geared and non-geared players in p2 is really deterministic. 
---
This was well known YEARS before classic came out.
---
My Retail warrior still has 23 severed Night Elf heads in his bank to this day.
---
59 mage here and almost no one ever asked me for water
---
Cancer sPeLLcLeAvE on the other hand...
---
No, you gain ranking based on your position in the weekly honor gained charts. Just to get from rank 13-14 requires you to be #1 honor gained for 3 or 4 consecutive weeks (I forget which). So you might be rank 1 honor gained the first week the honor system is released, but it might only bump you up to rank 7 or 8.
---
Yeah this is a pretty good takeaway, especially for melee... we're OP against lower level and UP against higher level. Lmao tried tanking ZF at 43... let's just say we gave up after 5 min (my team was also melee heavy and barely higher level than me). Stupid misleading recommended level 42-46 my ass.
---
Good mages are certainly not a dime a dozen
---
that's literally what you always do in World of Warcraft.
---
World PvP is great. Last night I was working on my Hydraxian Waterlords quests with my mage buddy (I'm a warrior). We got out to Sillithus and there were some Alliance out there farming or doing their quests too.
---
So we played a game of cat and mouse, displayed some brinksmanship, drove off challengers, bagged a few alliance that got too cocky and finished our quest. Nobody was camped. Nobody was needlessly harassed. It was just a matter of contested territory just like it should be.
---
It's a great tool, however Win+Shift+S is at least native to Windows 10 so no real excuse to not use it for people who don't want to bother installing and setting up 3rd party tools
---
It was Lagged but you could still attack someone at least for a little. Nobody was really dying tho
---
"non tank weapon" What does that even mean?
---
CHT or Perdition blade + ACLG is literally the best in slot threat setup for any non orc/human tank. Full stop. They are tank weapons. If your tanks are holding threat fine without it, that's awesome for them and they can pass it off. But all that means is your dps aren't doing their full potential damage.
---
All those traitors still alive not trying to take our beautiful city back
---
As a general rule, AOE shouldn't be used on small pulls with elite mobs. Instead, save it for large pulls of regular mobs like the skeletons around Mordresh in RFD.
---
It's quite simple ... most DPS can only reliably hit one target at a time. So by focusing down that target, it removes a source of damage against the party faster, and allows the single target DPS to focus on a new target and burn it down. So in the end, it takes about as long to kill a three or four group elite pack by single target DPSing, while at the same time making for a much safer run by removing how much damage the group is taking on that pull. Plus as a mage, you can use polymorph to move a mob from the equation until the very end.
---
Plus by AOEing, you're scattering the mobs all over the place as there's no way that a tank can reliably hold agro on all of them if you start AOEing non stop. This causes mobs to start rushing the back lines where the fragile casters are, especially the healer. And if you Frost Nova next to your healer and run backwards to avoid damage, you're instead telling mobs to start hitting the much closer healer.
---
Basically, just don't do it. I know it's cool and all, but I can tell the good mages from the bad ones by the fact that they know when to AOE and when to single target dps.
---
My favorite memory is quite recent, in classic even.  I was questing in STV, getting some gorilla giblets.  A duo Hunter and priest decided to kill me every time they saw me, even after I showed myself out of stealth and waved.  Later on I see the same duo doing the stranglethorn fever quest, where you have to give the witch doctor the hairs and summon the gorilla. I, in an act of sweetest revenge, sat where the gorillas were spawning, and when the big boy himself showed up, shot him with my bow.  The tag was mine, they had to deal with his four buddies, and I get away with finishing the quest while they lose all their hard earned gorilla hairs.
---
was using devotion while running to reduce the damage taken, but once we started killing them i should have switched to retri aura ye, just forgot.
---
I did a tribute with a fire mage last night. God I miss fire mages. Best mahe yet.
---
Really depends on the level of your group. It happens quite often if you're able to chain pull.
---
35 was when I rolled my Paladin alt. My main (Druid) is now level 49 and my Paladin is 30. I usually switch between them depending on which one I'm more burnt out on, so these past few nights it's been my Paladin, especially because pretty much every single questing zone that's left for my Druid is a Horde party 99% of the time.
---
I raid, but I still disagree. 0.5 is way harder than MC and the gear is worse for the most part. And what about people with epic PvP gear? They can have some of the best pve gear available without stepping foot in a raid - should they be far behind raiders?
---
The levelers/altaholics? I one had a gf who would just level a char to max level, then I'd ask "yo, wanna play with me now?" and she would just let the char age and start a new one. It was all she did. And I'm 100% sure there are many, many MANY of those around.
---
Looking at your specs your PC should run classic at max setting without an issue. I mean, I'm running classic at 1080p, medium settings at 40 fps on a 2 GB Mac Mini from 2011 with integrated graphics. It's well well well below even the minimum requirements. 
---
Do you by any chance run windows 7? If that's the case then check Task Manager so 'svchost.exe' isn't using up most of your cpu and/or memory. It has a tendency to do that.
---
EVERYTHING OR NOTHING!
---
Slow is smooth and smooth is fast
---
Going through the Dark Portal for the first time...then in WoTLK getting realm first H:Lich King and winning the roll for Invincible
---
Even I downvoted myself don’t worry
---
Yeah Tuesday through Thursday is the best time to sell that kind of stuff. Pretty sure the deposit with those is really small so if I were you, I would just dump all of them like this morning for 24 hour auctions at prices significantly higher than the current lowest.
---
yeah I really want tier .5 but it will be useless by the time it comes out
---
I thought with the Heroic Strike "Feature" the faster OH is better now but maybe I am incorrect
---
&gt; We're already doing that....anymore and raiding becomes obsolete.
---
That's hyperbole. Adding in Tier 0.5 wouldn't make raiding obsolete.
---
If any DPS intentionally pull a pack I just stand there afk until the packs down. Firm believer in "you pull it you tank it". This is why tanks are hard to find. People act like shit to them so no one wants to do it, then they complain they can't find one.
---
You probably need to clean your computer, physically it might be dusty. Doesn't look like you should be having issues, this game can run on a laptop worth $200. Take the side off the desktop and clean the heatsink for the CPU
---
My favorite WoW memory is finally downing Heroic Ragnaros in Firelands for the US 1st kill of him.  We had over 500 pulls on him and one of those pulls, the stars just seemed to align with all the mechanics in the final phase.  We even screwed up a geyser and a new safe spot spawned directly next to us.  Still the biggest rush after putting in tons of hours and long 15 hour raid days for 2 weeks on him.
---
We ended up doing the live raid at Blizzcon that year and it's still one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life!
---
I usually farm my mount money off of cats in STV with skinning, but I don't know if that will get you the G/hr you're looking for.
---
I just realized I love my server, haven’t had to deal with this bs yet
---
I have a low level Pally alt.  Best ranged pull I've found is dynamite.  It has half the range compared to a proper weapon but better than nothing.
---
My favourite memory that I've had so far as been in Classic. My buddy and I had just learned fishing from the trainer in Orgrimmar and we cast our lines into the small pond that many call home. 
---
While fishing there, an Orc came and looked at us both as we fished, and then cast his line himself. This would be the beginning of my favourite memory, as I knew there was nowhere he could run. 
---
Zap was the name of this beautiful Orc who had decided to fish with us, so I decided to make banter. I accused Zap of stealing my fish, of which he told me I was stupid and didn't understand how the game was played - but I understood his game. I continued to accuse him, saying that he was trying to corner the market, and that he wanted all the fish in Orgrimmar himself; he continued to refute this fact while casting insults along with his fishing line. 
---
After about 15 minutes of this going back and forth, I traded Zap one of the off-hand fish (the smallest you could catch) and told him he didn't deserve it, but we were friends. He told me that we weren't friends, and he unequipped his fishing pole and said his last words to me: 
---
"I hope I never see you again."
---
To this day, I try to send him fish that I get and any garbage that I find in the waters, to remind him that I am still here, and always will be, for Zap.
---
Cool TY. Still farming the MH but had DW/Flurry combo and didn't know if I was wasting my time, thanks a ton!
---
No you are fine. I do the same thing as heals in that of people pull before i have the needed mana  to, you know, keep them alive, and if we die it’s whatever but if they start complaining about bad heals or something like that because they are constantly doing this, then i leave group. I can always find another group.
---
wait u were in a duel with warlock WHILE killing him?
---
Same with my lock. Hit 40 and just parked her.
---
No, he's saying when you're in a party the mob is only lootable by one person. He essentially won the roll by virtue of the fact that the item RNG'd into a mob he won the loot for.
---
He does also mention he played more on weekends. I’m thinking that was is sole activity. That’d make up for a large portion of his leveling. But I’d still he didn’t really do it in that timeframe.
---
I love enhancement but the improved weapons totem is a waste of talent points in any spec.
---
He is not old it’s just the effects of what drugs &amp; alcohol does to the body, DARE to be different!
---
I was interested in this so I wrote a program to simulate it: https://dotnetfiddle.net/fXDNvn (Just click "Run" at the top)
---
As written it simulates 100000 runs of hitting a mob 350 times with a proc rate of 0.2. From running it myself, the average streak was about 21~, which is roughly in line with what you're suggesting when considering it didn't take into account /u/rrowland's correction.
---
It really seems like one of those things where it's more likely than you expect due to the almost combinatorial nature of the problem. Kind of similar to the [birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem)
---
One of the Great Classic Blunders, really. Like getting into a land war in Asia or going against a Sicilian when death is on the line
---
It’s almost as if r/automenuu summoned you, holy shit.
---
That is not accurate. There is a 2nd roll for resistance, which is clear with any non-binary spell type. Fire spells have partial resists, the chance to hit is completely separate. That entire site seems to have completely left out the resist mechanic and confused it with the hit/miss mechanic.
---
Like skipping half of SM cath in the courtyard.
---
These hours raiding with people that are not around anymore.
---
For a furry warrior you need a nice fur suit that fits your personality.
---
Just kidding.. Have you tried google though?
---
Yeah obviously that guy didn't do the timed Strat runs or anything for the chain.
---
Yeah I think you're talking about "progression" (stuff to complete), rather than "for fun". I'm trying to say that classic doesn't need "progression" stuff for casuals because there its lots to enjoy. The people who require progression stuff will 100% be on retail (and other new gen games) rather than old skool games like this. Older games were all about fun, not the need to have something to progress on or tick boxes
---
This may help you from knocking yourself out. However, it does nothing to correct the other buggy behavior with mobs tracking you post vanish. It also does not address the problems with the batching system and mobs getting free hits on players after being hard CCed.
---
The german players give a fuck, incase you haven't noticed by now (no idea why you wouldn't have). Just because you don't care, doesn't mean that we should do the same. I think the general opinion here is clear, take it or leave it. The fact that you still don't see how it would be a problem if more people acted like OP, tells me you aren't too invested into the community-aspect of Classic.
---
I sure hope so :D
---
That depends on your income. 
---
I have friends that spend $500-$1000 a month on their old timer car(s).   Others spend it on having children.   Don't underestimate the purchasing power of the nerd with a  good job
---
Mimimi he said im to slow mimimi . Just let him die Then he learn it. But instant leave the group because of one poor guy is such a pussymove. 
---
U let 3 other people pay for one guy.
---
Guys dont be like the Mage.
---
But dont be as this leaving kids aswell.
---
Its classic , not bfa.
---
What ever you do, the people will remember
---
Same thing, you see him take 478 damage on the same batch he uses vanish
---
I'm level 44 on my druid and I really want Warden Staff. It sells for about 300-400g on my server so buying it is an option, just one I'm not fond of. Is there any method to farming specific boe epics?
---
No problem! Have fun!
---
Was in a BFD group a while ago with a lock in the group and when most people had arrived at the instance the lock asked us to summon him. He left the group and called us assholes when we told him you can't use meeting stones to summon in classic.
---
Idk why you're getting down voted. It's clearly just a cute funny exchange between you both haha
---
yeah i farm 20 of these a night doing princess runs. Takes a few hours, but I usually hjit the ah up with 15-25 a night.
---
I know people don’t like this answer, but if you don’t want to raid and see that content, then don’t play the game. Classic is the best wow has felt since wrath, and that’s really where blizzard went crazy trying to please all the people crying over this same stuff. The entire idea behind these games was to join a group and kill stuff, sorry if you and your 3 buddies IRL have decided you don’t want to play with other people and are upset you don’t get the same rewards as people who put the time in but you’re just wrong. I’m only level 40 right now, I’m not some try hard that spends all my time on this game, and even when I hit 60 I will probably struggle to find the time to run the raids, but because I came up through this system and experienced it when it was new I don’t care. Just sitting back from a distance thinking, wow this is how this should be. Stuff like full badge gear, becoming heroics drop epics from every boss, to Lfr, they diminish the value of an “epic” for the sake of everyone having them and feeling like they have options too. Sorry but if you’re not raiding, you should just accept that blues are your best gear, and move on, because the mentality you’re speaking of, where causal Non raiders want a “progression” path of their own is seriously what makes retail such a trash game. The idea that a group of 5 people can get the same or better gear than a group of 20 is just stupid, and has made raiding on retail feel unrewarding, not to mention the absurd amount of difficulty choices and ilvl scales, makes “causal” raiding feel even more pointless. Like great now everyone can do everything, you still have a cap, your progression is an illusion, because if you’re doing easier stuff your gear is still inferior. So in classic you’re upset you ran out of dungeon gear to grind when you don’t need better gear for the content you’re doing, while on retail you have a continued sense of progression  because you get the new raid content everyone else gets but your gear is still trash and the equivalent of wearing dungeon blues compared the mythic raiders and their gear. Basically blizzard listened to people like you constantly crying they had nothing to do to stay relevant, ironically even with the addition of the content your talking about, you’re still not relevant. Go play retail please, it’s already been ruined with all your QOL changes that you’re asking for.
---
That was hilarious. Thanks for sharing.
---
I mean, you can't eat your cake and have it too.
---
This is on Atiesh isn’t it?
---
Meh. Depends on the situation. I play WoW, work a full time job, *and* live at home because my mother is disabled and needs help with pretty much everything. I wouldn't call myself a loser, but apparently you would.
---
I actually have noticed this since day one of leveling my shaman. Seems to happen right when I change target to heal right after I have been dealing damage to a mob. Almost as I am healing prematurely when I should wait a sec for targets to change if that makes more sense. No mouseover healing
---
Ty, I just tried 2 times today, first time a random horde came and shot at it, I honestly think he thought he was helping, that said, I killed him after he did it :D
---
Second time he despawned 5 min into the fight for no reason, so now I'm just waiting for respawn.
---
I don't get it. Isn't it better to give gear to the worse equipped player, so they can compete, instead of giving it to already good geared players?
---
Technically level 44 is half way.
---
My favourite memory is definitely from classic wow, I was just a kid but I remember the day I finished the paladin charger questline, it took me months to finish it! I could only play wow during school holidays but I remember every session I would grind money, mats, everything to carry on the questline, it was a great feeling when I finally finished it!
---
So British women?
---
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit. Where’s the buff food, I need to rebuff after seeing this
---
I didn’t leave right away. He did it a few times after he was told to stop.
---
Neat!
---
&gt;Shadow guard is a “ lightning shield”  style move that does damage to melee and casters when struck, it also has spell push back for casters
---
AND it can procc Blackout
---
We have disenchanted Brigam 4 runs in a row &gt;.&lt;  tank and both dps warriors already have it
---
Well considering even in retail, mobs will sometimes still chase you after a vanish tells you something. The fact is vanish has always been buggy/broken for as long as I can remember.  I know it sucks and has been a common complaint on the forums for years,  but you get classic with all its blemishes as well.
---
If it was just one idiot I'd say either he leaves or I do. If I was feeling particularly nice I might give him one last chance to get his shit together but otherwise the group wouldn't be big enough for the two of us.
---
tombstone, deathdealer, bloodthirst, heaps breastplates that are *almost* as good, available right now
---
this is still the best though
---
Mages are the best ranged dps by far, and you should stack as many in a raid as possible, while keeping usually 3 hunters and 4 warlocks.
---
If you don't want to be one of 8+ mages in a raid, then don't play mage. It will happen.
---
Warlocks are in short supply, and raids love having more warlocks, if you're looking for a spellcaster that will let you feel more unique.
---
Druid is the most complicated to play well in pvp if you play as a hybrid which you should. As a feral dps it's probably the most complicated as well. Healer is easy though
---
I would stay hotw/NS for as long as possible. You can get way faster into groups as tank. You can announce that heal is you MS, that will need on heal gear instead of tank gear. Every once in a while you will still need to heal, so you can practice healing then. The way you heal does not change with moonglow, its just 9% more efficient.
---
If they ever fix feign, the trinket will be quite nice. Changing trinkets on feign is part of the hunter rotation.
---
And we will wait for you with open arms and pointy swords. But you don"t need to be geared to do this with this many people. I am only 55 and the lowest in our raid was actually 34 ( he even got a kill or so he says). I can imagine that horde will be pissed enough to form a counter raid soon
---
I don't know of one, but did not try googleing.
---
Stunlocking alliances scums
---
Because people can’t all agree on the same things.  I for one don’t want cheaper respecc costs.  I like knowing who is specced for what, and when I run into a mage who I fought a week ago, I like being relatively sure of what his specc is.
---
Specc and talent swapping on the fly cheapens the hard decision of compromise between raiding/pvp/farming.  With cheap respecc, you get homogenized builds everywhere
---
I've done both and all I can say is you guys are acting a little entitled. You want the gear but don't want to put the effort via guild or pug. Maybe this just isn't the game for you?
---
Oh, summer child. Vanish has been "working as intended" since the days of beta. Us old rogues know vanish has always been broken, and Blizzard refusing to acknowledge that *is* the \#NoChanges experience
---
Now, bring. back. *Swirly Ball!*
---
I use a program called Lightshot for that, it also lets you draw and write over the image! And there's also puush, that has similar functionality and lets you automatically upload your clipboard and get an easy link to send to people.
---
We were just doing if you show you roll but it looks like they are switching to council.
---
It sucked because yeah it's great for the lucky bastards that seem to always roll high. Great they are rolling in almost max T1 already but the rest of us have nothing.
---
Np. However just fishing in one spot is definitely faster. This was to make it fun but it's not efficient
---
Sometimes you just need to ride the bull - creed bratton
---
The staff and mh/oh have the same spirit.
---
Search the forums. A lot of us tanks have made several posts with tips and advice. Always make sure to make your targets and use all your abilities. Shield slam, revenge, taunt, heroic strike. Make macros for quicker reaction times, etc
---
No. It is worse. Mobs have a sort of 6th sense in Classic that I never saw in Vanilla. Being broken out of stealth is much more common now due to the bad batching system. The problems with hard stuns also extends to all classes. Anyone can use a hard CC and then be wacked by a mob. You see other strange behavior during stuns, like mobs changing their positioning.
---
You're right to go at your own pace and find a group to fit that pace. However, I have seen tanks who are really slow and waste time. For example, they wait until everyone is at 100% mana, then everyone is standing behind the tanks waiting for them to charge, the tank then marks everything and gives a ready check. Doing this for every mob group is extremely excessive.
---
Mage feels like having many conveniences and few inconveniences. No need to buy and carry much like food, ammo, poisons. Having pleasure to share conjured food and water. Easy escaping from bad fights with mobs. Clear abilities always all available independently from states like druid forms or rogue invisibility. Safety of ranged casting, and it's often just a couple spells to use. Finally, buffs last long. Paladin could probably be simpler but re-blessing every 5 minutes can grind some people's gears.
---
I just posted a map of what we have planned in case that helps. That satyrs are in the hallway after the second courtyard so they shouldn’t be an issue. Just trying to get to them

I really hate the idea of a DKP system in raids, I've never really been in a guild that runs one so would be intrested do you guys who are in one of those guilds like the system? I'm an officer in my guild and just mainly dish out loot on /roll or some bits get loot counciled say is a sword rogue wanted a dagger kinda situation.
---
You know that, and I know that. The average enhance shaman not so much :p
---
Slow and steady baby. 1 single wipe can delay even the slowest of tanks. I think I have had like 1 wipe in the last 5 dungeons I  have done and they have all finished in an hour or less.
---
See, I already have my BiS gear and have absolutely no reason to tank any dungeons unless helping out guildies. So if I’m being asked to tank for randoms and I have no reason to and could just level my alt, I’ll ask for 10g or first orb depending on the dungeon.
---
This actually does not matter since every xpack is a game on its own essentially and doesnt require anything from before it. That said they are pushing that collectible shit too much. Like they know the only perople still playing BFA are people with OCD who feel the need to collect everything. I think the 8.2 patch added like 30 mounts to the game.
---
I got my hunter to lvl 50 and that was where i started not having a lot of fun, so i decided that maybe hunters not really my thing, so i rolled a rogue and im having a blast and about to be lvl 50
---
I’ll give this a try. Thanks.
---
The resist chance is going to be the same as any other spell, but the gernades do deal fire damage meaning that players with a lot of fire resist (which is pretty common these days) will have a higher chance to resist them. Another thing to mention is that I am fairly certain the orc passive does not give a chance to resist grenades.
---
As a first time wow player I ran Scarlet Monastery - Cathedral with no knowledge as how the encounter was going to be. When the priestess sleeps you, mind controls a party member and revives mogaine I was losing it.
---
Both MC and Onyxia are relevant throughout the whole of Classic, the notion of "missing out" on a raid is non-existent like in retail. People will run both instances either for the legendaries (and some very good epics) in MC or the bags and gold from Onyxia.
---
I definitely need to start building my healing set, thanks for the advice!
---
I'm lookin forward to this as a feral druid with herb.  Find basically any partner with mining and we're set.  We can each take all the relevant nodes, duo the bosses no prob, or if it's an AOE mage I can simply support with heals and hurricane during trash pulls, then the mage can frostbolt spam on bosses to kill the boss before I die =p
---
I guess I don't know what you are referring to. Could you elaborate?
---
cool I need to set that setting for my Mage. I had to do the setting to block unsolicited groups due to all the gold farmers randomly inviting me while I am fighting.
---
Just uploaded an update, which supports raid frames. Wasn't yet able to test it in a real raid situation though, since my main is lvl47 (spending too much time programming Addons ;)).
---
Feedback and/or bug reports very much appreciated.

It's not always that they don't want to raid. Some people have weird work schedules that prevent them from joining raids at the times most guilds on their server do them, play specs that people really don't need/want more than one of per raid, or just can't reliably set aside 2-4 hours twice a week to raid.
---
If your healing gear is good, you can easily heal most content as shadow. If you are planning on wearing your damage set, you will have a bad time.
---
It's one thing to ask the tank to go faster if the healer can handle it but to pull the mobs as dps is idiotic.
---
honestly if you are literally only capable of making it to level 36 before you reroll and start posting mongoloid threads like this on reddit, you are far past the point of saving
---
Level 44 is super early to consider dropping that gold imo. I tanked MC for 2 weeks with this:  https://classicdb.ch/?item=9408
---
before I shelled out 350g for mine. Also keep in mind that Unyeilding Maul is now in the game, and 99.9% as good, while being much more obtainable.
---
My favorite memory in wow downing 10 man Sartharian +3 drakes in the first night of attempts after failing for a few weeks attempting the 25 man version with my guild.
---
Other than that, my favorite memory is the wow classic launch. The chaos of a community so excited was incredible.

You really think world pvp is going to be great? What realm are you on? World pvp is going to be trash because its for whoever has 3 raid groups and 100 sapper charges....WSG needs to be released in phase 2 or else everyone will be bored of world pvp within a week. If they prolong wsg until next year march a lot of people might unsub until then
---
Its just RNG. I mined up to 60 rich veins in DME, got 0 arcane crystals, one blue sapphire, one huge emerald.
---
I have seen Azerothian diamond drop once in +100 runs. Good thing those are dirt cheap.
---
An act of God.
---
Solo BGs is fun, however since people do everything to game the systems these days compared to before I'm guessing you'll run into a lot more premades than you did in vanilla.
---
It's sad. You're good son, definitely not a loser.
---
An upgrade is an upgrade yes, but one is crafted, one is dropped. Felcloth gloves are crafted super cheap, cheaper than running lbrs 34 times. Now before DM dropped absolutely, but why run a dungeon repeatedly when you can get them crafted for like 30g
---
My wife does this.
---
Auctionator (not on twitch) is 100 times better. Thank me later.
---
The first time I participated in the Ritual of Doom back in vanilla.  Group of guildies summoned my level 20 ass to Westfall so that I could help them with the ritual.  Watching from my corpse location as the Doomguard rampaged through the Alliance town is one of the coolest MMO experiences I've ever had - rerolled to a Warlock an hour later and it ended up being my first max level character.
---
No budget really but if it started to get really expensive I’d start considering a new pc.
---
So first of all I agree I have been playing a lot. But my point wasn't really about *me*, but rather about people getting lvl 60 this week, which is a lot different.  
---
But also I still think that, while I've had several days of "no-lifing" the game, I've also had many days not playing it at all, or maybe 1 hour max. Always been spending time with friends and family every weekend etc. My point was really that as soon as you play more than "casual", it doesn't directly go to "no-life".. Because, what then is the next tier? What do you call someone who has no job and plays like 12h a day all the time?
---
anyway, I'm no-lifing these comments right now when it really isn't that big of a deal lol!
---
happy grinding to you too sir
---
No.  You told him the consequences if he kept acting that way, and he acted that way.  You are playing a video game, not a job.  The only thing you are beholden to is social repercussions.  In your case, you have none since you are morally in the right here.
---
Daughter, but close enough. Thanks man haha. Just backing up swift\_beaver's comment.
---
&gt; You don’t need much hit unless you’re fury-prot.
---
This is false. Getting hit capped is your number 1 goal and you should strive to be at the cap in every one of your gear sets.
---
With my gear (not even fully pre-bis yet, rerolled recently) it's about 130g/hr with mining. I'm going to get my epic mount later today and then I'm going to power level herbalism and that should put me at an upper ceiling of 200g/hr.
---
got the gloves the first try after saving her then killing her. Also, the tank got so excited that he ninja'd gloves? Both these items drop way before princess, somethings not right, especially cuz you'd be talking about the gloves, and probably say "this is the run! we got 2 pieces already" I see these gloves constantly when I was running princess.
---
So for people saying this still wouldn't help with a tank swap fight... Would combining this BoK on a raid group and then a BoProtection on the other tank during a tank swap be a viable combo for a mechanic when an instant tank switch is needed? Assuming the other tank switches the BoP off of course.
---
Definitely the two form/stance dancing classes. Feral drood and a warrior. Tried feral DPS in pve, switched to tanking because i figured I might as well have a group whenever I need one if I’m doing that much work anyway
---
Eviscerate is bugged as well, sometimes it deals less damage than the actual tooltip. And even accounting for armor it deals less than it should.
---
The movie was 20 years ago, I wasn’t sure lol
---
honestly people with as weak of a brain as you should probably just shy away from video games. Maybe go sit in a pasture all day and just eat grass, something more within your comfort zone
---
As a tank, you can always pull the mob you're still tanking to be closer to where the casters have pulled it ... and then just let it tank the mage until the mage dies or the healer pulls agro, in which case then you can taunt it off.
---
If I'm tanking, I'll let anyone in the group tank the mob if they really insist ... EXCEPT the healer. I refuse to let the healer pull agro. Unless he's spamming Mind Blast, in which case he's an idiot.
---

---
whats wagio.io?

Hmmm I just deleted because that advise was useless in that case :D

Hmm invisibility potion is the only Thing I can think of then...

---
At the Point where this druid is in front of the door he has to unlock. He uses a jump where you can loose agroo.
---
It is probably too far away to just run there... Maybe if you send the voidwalker first to tank and make it to that place.
---
This way you could loose agroo there and move on from that if possible somehow? :D
---
Thanks for the advice! I'm sure my guild members won't mind if I tell them what my plans are.
---
I have max ele precision 3% hit from gear (arcanist helm, banthok, and star) and arcane subtly. I get at least 1 to 2 resists every other Zombie pull in Zul'farrak. The chances of this happening have to be astronomically low. But I have to use reset spots or cold snap every other pull consistently to avoid messups. This goes to the other post about low level mobs doing too much damage. These level 40 zombies never miss or if they do its less frequent than they resist a level 60 spell. Something feels wrong, wish I had better data from Vanilla to compare.
---
Huge crits, PvP is ez mode, not a ton of competition for tier gear in raids, free/cheaper mounts, lots of fun/unique spells.
---
Made my wife roll shaman.  I always have WF and SoE on my warrior, life is good.
---
Now change it all to Comic Sans.
---
As someone who has an account full of Rogues, it is much worse than it ever was. 
---
I expect to fail vanishes from time to time. The failure rate in Classic is much higher. This is due to the weird batching systems and the lack of proper flags in said system.
---
You can see the issues clearly during various CCs (from any class). Mobs will often be under the effect of a CC and then still fire off an auto attack. They will also change orientation (turn 180). This is not Vanilla behavior.
---
In addition to that, the game reacts to stance bar changes at a much slower speed than in the past. In Vanilla I could cast vanish and immediately go into a Cheap Shot. In Classic I have had to train myself to wait for a split second. Else the game will not recognize this and I will cast the previous bars ability. An ability that isn't even on my Stealth bar. 
---
These issues extend to multiple classes and there is a huge thread about i on the bug forms. The other big ones of note are the Hunter FD issue and Warriors are using up more rage than they should. 
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/execute-trigger-delay-is-doubled-compared-to-vanilla/304950
---
The problems are plentiful and not isolated to Rogues.
---
I haven’t had a direct problem, but I have seen much more of it in Classic than retail.
---
Bad attitudes aren’t exclusive to pugs. Guilds aren’t come miraculous cure-all for being a shithead. And being “real full time gamer” and not a “gamerdad or soccer mom” doesn’t excuse that sort of temperament.
---
Cause as you just said, upgrade is an upgrade, doesn’t matter the alternatives. You are in that group now, the gloves drops, they are better than your current you can need them without feeling guilty of anything. You are not obligated to compare it with any lists or check for any other upgrades or alternatives before you roll. Thats how it works and how it should work
---
good times
---
A dual wielding survival hunter in melee *is* one of the Classic mistakes yes.
---
80% of what can be regarded as "complicated" in World of Warcraft is due to **poor keybinds or no keybinds** for important spells/skills.
---
For example with pet classes,lets say warlock,you bind your petattack to shift scroll up and pet follow to shift scroll down. Play 1 or 2 hours like this and it will drill into your muscle memory. Now most pets have 1 or maybe 2 abilities that you want to use without clicking on it's little action bar. You also want to bind said abilities to a button,with the lesser used ability to shift+same button.
---
Thats literally it. 
---
For **warrior** you want to use several **stance change**  \+ **weapon equip** macros. These macros are usually nothing fancy but you do need to spare some time setting them up..
---
For example:
---
* \#showtooltip Shield Wall
---
* /startattack
---
* /equip Carpenter's Mallet
---
* /equip Worn Large Shield
---
* /cast Defensive Stance
---
* /cast Shield Wall
---
Where im getting at is nothing in World of Warcraft can be regarded as "difficult". The only factors in your success are patience (to set this keybind and macro crap up) and class knowledge (you dont need to be wowwiki,just know stuff like Polymorph can break on damage,hunters cant use their bows up close etc).
---
I always reply with 40s per box either they pay or they leave you alone. Now I have 6-7 guys coming to me with lock boxes and money already prepared because I always stay at the same in UC. Pretty nett passiv income tbh.
---
Flying definitely killed WPvP. Once you have a flying mount maps no longer have negative space and natural areas to funnel players through.
---
The ability to fly from point A to point B and avoid players or hover 60 yards in the air and be untouchable is the real issue.
---
There were hotbeds: outside Kara, elemental plateau, orgrila, skettis, netherwing and eventually Sunwell Plataeu, funny that most the areas have some sort of anti flying mechanic or no flying at all.
---
Getting my Bloodfong Hood with a 2 roll. I rolled first, then the other dude rolled a 1. Ventrilo exploded. Good times

Thanks man, appreciate that.
---
Different company, but still, a story:
---
My RS account got compromised so one day I woke up to a bunch of mails about purchased memberships. I immediately contacted Jagex support telling them that someone got access to my account and used a, most likely, stolen card to purchase bonds.
---
They ignored me.
---
I wrote a few days later again, reporting the same incident, "I think you should really remove all these bonds from the game and give back the money to the person who's card has been used".
---
Still ignored.
---
Then a few days later I get a mail "We've gotten a charge back from a credit card used with your account, it will be locked until you pay the missing amount of $118".
---
So yeah, that's how I quit playing runescape.
---
Then maybe that metric is a bit... off? No?
---
I mean... what would you call someone who has no job/family and play like 12h a day?
---
Definitely try and get the bracers and belt from UBRS. You can also use Rune of the Guard Captain in a pinch for more + to hit. Also, if you haven't already turned in your Ony head quest, the necklace from Ony is way more important than the trinket for you. Tanks need to be tanking the necklace. You don't replace it until Naxx whereas there are plenty of trinket options earlier.
---
No no, no no no no, no no no no, no no no no no no no no
---
Nothing. Would quit again like I did when Cata was released.
---
I don’t mind having something to work towards, but it should be something you complete every other day or like two times a week. Not something that resets every 8 hours. They’ve already shown some willingness to reconsider titan forging, so I don’t think this is out of the question.
---
It’s also partially just the number of things to complete.
---
World quests. Mythic +. Island Expeditions. War campaign battles.
---
When it was just world quests and mythic + in legion it was a lot but still WAY better than BFA. It just needs to be trimmed down noticeably.
---
I wouldn't discard spell power on tank Palas.
---
Together with the life stealing shield (flameskull) which has 100% spell power it is still great.
---
Sure 30 spell power does increase your aoe consecration by 10 dmg but it is 10 dmg to everyone.
---
Sure single target get 100% spellpower but theoretically aoe spells have unlimited dmg increase.
---
This was when BGs were first introduced and you had to go to northern Barrens to get into WSG. That's a ZG item.
---
A locked chest without a rogue in a party is a lost chest. Obviously locked chests are for rogues ONLY, unless someone has keys.
---
Yeah, i don't recommend pulling 4 groups. Thats just dumb. One group at a time is fine. If you've got 3 mages to aoe, then maybe it would work.
---
in the 2nd courtyard you can evade on all the raised sides of the ramps leading to the center.  you need to get up there so they evade before they get really close though or their fat ass model will let them just wack you anyway.

That's my secret - I'm always shitting.

I dont think I would be able to justify the spend, but if I were to able to farm an area that had it as a drop I wouldn't be opposed to sinking hours into that.
---
Blinking (almost) across small rivers in places like Wetlands is a nice small pleasure though
---
I'm not saying it's a conspiracy, but I've literally seen multiple players from both factions with it on Faerlina. I just wonder if the mats are easier to get now than they were back then or what? Seeing a few people with legendary weapons just cheapens the experience to me. 
---
I guess time will tell when Thunderfury is available. If every warrior has it then you know something is wrong lol.
---
Where can I find a guide for this?
---
Fire J Allen Brack.
---
Yeah fair enough. Since you were already there and didn't know any better it's really the group leader's fault. If they needed you for summons then you had the same right to roll on loot as anyone else.
---
Once you're 60 this won't be an issue, so I guess no big deal. There's a lot to know in this game.
---
Like I said, in my humble opinion they might be doing themselves a disservice by at the very least not handing them out to tanks.
---
and change to DisableAddOn to turn it off
---
If you have an air compressor, use that. It will be messy, be prepared. If not, can of compressed air is okay. Some people will say these methods can throw moisture at your pc, but I've never had an issue.
---
About a month ago our long time crew was powering though SFK runs. Our mage joked about how he would lose his mind if a Shadowfang dropped for us. The very next pull the werewolves in the lofted section dropped one. FULL ON INITIAL PANIC. We finally settle down and decide we should just split the profit as none of us have 60s yet. I took on the responsibility of getting it sold and it felt damn good to mail my friend \~27g each before even level 30.
---
Any tip is more g/s/c than what I had to begin with, in fact when in opening them I will got trade immediately and let them decide if they want to tip or not. My enchanting though, that's a bit different.
---
Do you know the levels of mobs / quality chest that roll the boe epic table?
---
In a way, it dropped on a body he looted, which is the same 50/50 chance as a normal roll ?
---
boomer tanks taking 2 hours to do 15 year old content "slow is smooth, smooth is fast" smh
---
This was when BGs were first introduced and you had to go to northern Barrens to get into WSG. Bloodcaller is a ZG item.
---
I want it for all the reasons it's there. The intended purpose is for guild members to put stuff in and take stuff out. There are multiple applications of that function, I only stated the use for alts because that has become more relevent as people hit 60 and start alts.
---
this works in full screen too ? doesnt back you out or some shit ?
---
- Rickety, shitty houses? Check.
---
- Old style windmill? Check.
---
- Flat, shrubbery landscape? Check.
---
Must be westfall.
---
if they did that to me I would make sure to put them on ignore and never do one for them. that shit annoys me to no end.
---
TBH, people that don't raid probably dont pay attention to the meta either, or that most of us raiding are wearing blues and dont want many of the tier pieces.
---
Verily, the three things a man must never forget to include in their plans, be it building a survival hunter, warfare in Asia or dueling Sicilians.
---
Oh ok gotcha
---
I hit 60last week and I’ve found 2 black lotus just doing my quests in western lol. All random. Was shocked when I saw it’s price when I picked it.
---
I have heard the split threat drop before and I believe it more now. I was specifically targeted by this chain of fireballs (as I was targeting her to DPS) at the time and saw my self being the target. I actually lived through it just I was just spammed with heals after the second one.
---
If I have time I can try to review the logs to find and see how many other were hit during this stretch.
---
I hope Windings is next.
---
yeaahhhh this... it took me 47 tries which I felt was a lot and I know that number is real because of dbm lol
---
Leveling my hunter with my best buddy as warrior was my life elixir 12years ago.  
---
Years passed, we got older, Classic was announced, we were hyped as fuck.  
---
It was this day Classic came out, like 1h q we created our chars and were 12 again.   
---
we grinded a whole weekend for like level ~25 and it felt awesome.  
---
Level 55/58 atm wanted to start raiding this weekend.  
---
wish us luck
---
I think the changes suggested in this post make sense, but it's definitely true that everyone plays this game differently. Personally I have had quite a bit of time to play classic, but I don't have a 60 yet because I haven't committed to one character. My highest guys are 50 and 44. My 44 is in a guild with a bunch of MC raiders and I've seen them talk about "sub-60s" with some disdain, as if they don't deserve the same respect. Some of us just prioritize different things.
---
listen man my apologies this is a really good thread
---
I agree that it's fantastic for PvE :)

---
I am not sure what budget was for you but I got a 17” Asus gaming laptop on New Egg last year for about $1200-$1300.

It had almost the same specs that a Razer laptop had they were trying to charge $3500 for.  I’ve had no problems with it and live the choice.
---
If he’s pulling extra mobs and the group isn’t dieing, then technically you could be going quicker couldn’t you?
---
I'm a Rogue, I was in SM lib and had a wonderful experience. Tank and healer were friends and the tank didnt talk at all. Before the corridors I said to the tank it might be a good idea to pull out into the hallway to prevent adds from runners. Tank didnt do this and fought in the door. Well they ran and pulled the room. We died and I said that was what I wanted to prevent. Priest called me worthless garbage because I couldnt kill them. Bruh I can only do so much ffs. I do amazing dps but I am one person.

Except that people who tried those "Amazing 50 gph pickpocket farm" guides for multiple hours report back that the claim is bogus because those guides never take into account downtime for resetting, backtracking, lockpicking, vendoring, resists. Do a search for "pickpocket" on this sub and see for yourself.
---
RIP
---
Or worse yet, healer burns all his mama keeping the DPS up and nobody says anything, so the run is slow while the healer drinks after every pull and the DPS is pissy about how long it's taking and how "bad" the tank is.
---
What are you talking about? All the gnomes I've seen there have lots of friends.
---
Things still need tranquilizing all the way up, and 3 makes it very unlikely to mess up the rotation, from what I've heard.
---
Does Onyxia's Wing Buffet permanently reduce maximum threat? My guild was doing Ony last night and after the tank (same from P1) successfully picked up threat on P3 some DPS would still pull aggro 5 minutes into the phase even with white damage. Some players even stood for 2 minutes doing nothing and when starting white DPS they still pulled, healers also pulled threat. We were raiding with 17 people so everyone was especially careful about their threat, but it didn't seem to matter what we did.
---
Afterwards we did a 35 raid and had a different tank pick up Ony at P3 and it went very smoothly, no threat pulling. A guildie of mine says that each time the tank gets wing buffeted his maximum threat output gets reduced by a certain %, not just a temporary drop life fade/vanish, but his attacks will only do a fraction of threat as before. It would seem that this is plausible since we had no issue with a new tank on phase 3 who would be starting at 100% threat. Can anyone else confirm this?
---

How do you plan to use this info to help the entire wow classic community?

---
Maybe you should sit in a pasture all day and graze grass instead of trolling on Reddit. Seems like something more in your comfort zone.
---
The comments on reddit would have you think every tank is a pleb who doesn’t move fast...thank god there are good people in game and reddit is NOT representative of the actual player base. 
---
Have had so much good pugs with a tank with the right attitude...push it.
---
I often protect all casters as a rogue, I know I don't deal the most damage so I make "you" (casters) deal as much as you can (while still dpsing). But as I said, not my fault you "spellcleaveomegalul" every instance. Rogues can disarm each 5-10s while dpsing while a warrior can't... There is use in every class and some have privileges over others. Assuming you are a mage you got free food and portals, as rogue I have lockboxes and chests. One can't have everything because THAT is being greedy (or needy?).

I'm in exactly this situation of trying to spoil my warrior alt (DM was kind to my hunter main haha) and was wondering what you ended up doing. Im gonna have a flurry with crusader sitting in my bag at 42 for tanking anyway so I was thinking of trying out dual wield and maybe even buying a 2nd flurry for shits. Did you end up trying this?
---
Don't open with immolate if you're worried about pulling agro. Just send in blueberry, then coa, corr, [immolate if you must], wand. The wand from BFD (Gravestone Scepter) has higher dps than drain life at your level.
---
But pulling agro from blueberry is a real problem, especially if you are wearing + shadow damage gear. Check out [Dive's Draintanking Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qdUs229_XvkR1NCeTrJkybL5BDXGIh7q/view) for a playstyle that avoids this issue entirely.
---
I leave so many pugs as tank
---
Yeah, had me doing tonnes of quest I’ve never done before. Including one which sent me all over Kalimdor and EK called “Sweet Amber” that was quite fun!
---
If all the dungeon loot is better than the raid loot, then yes they are pointless. That's not an opinion. If you're endgame is dungeons because you can't bother to raid, why do you care if raid loot is better than yours? You're done at that point.
---
Probably like 50/50. I’m in a good guild and they know what’s up so I’m not too worried about finding a guild and stuff just looking for ways to maximize my play. I know buffing and off healing is a part of my kit just wanting to max myself as best I can.
---
I disagree, but a thoughtful post by the OP so thanks for that. Good read
---
I think the only mistake here was assuming the rest of the group would be in on it and leaving rather than confronting the problem. It's easy to assume that they're silently complicit when actually they're almost certainly on your side if you forced the issue, as the tank is the de facto group leader with the healer pulling his strings, and everyone else is pretty much just grateful to have a group.
---
I would've let the rest of the party know that there are three options. The mage stops his bullshit and gets in line, he gets kicked, or I leave the group. Only two of those result in the party getting to finish their run, so what's it going to be?
---
You have no obligation to anyone other than yourself, you get to decide how fast you tank (so long as the healer's fine with it), and there's a billion other DPS in the sea, whereas they have to wait for another hour to find a tank at best.
---
No, its not guaranteed at all. there is a much hgher chance you'll skill up, but not always. its the same with every profession. sometimes an orange wont give you a skill up. its not common though.
---
I think you're misinterpreting your own test data? Take a look at the output:

---
&gt; Shortest streak was 8
---
&gt; Average streak is 21.12089
---
Particularly:
---
This agrees with me, not the person you seem to be agreeing with. His assertion was that there should be 1 every 350 on average. Your computation is confirming there are 0.18 every 350 on average. That's 5.5x less likely, in line with my calculation.
---
you and your friends should leave, that's some dumbass leadership

Onslaught is also BIS for Fury for the basically every phase. Funny how you think the Fury warrior is the loot driven one when they get hardly any drops at all in MC. I have raided MC for 4 weeks with 0 loot to show for it (DPS warrior drops are trash in MC). Still haven't looted one epic in MC/Ony. So yeah I'd be very pissed if a tank took this while already having multiple pieces of Might set and Wrath legs.
---
I'm glad someone else realizes how powerful MC is. My dps as a spriest is often less than stellar unless I burn through mana and water, so mind control is my go-to against humanoids. Toss a vamp embrace and a DoT on the marked target then assume direct control of another add and go to town. Some of those suckers hit HARD too with some strong abilities to boot.
---
Solved this issue with my Ducky Shine Mini keyboard. The bottom row is fully reprogrammable so there is no windows key on the left side of the keyboard and thus no accidental windows key presses. Added bonus is that the keyboard works with a function sublayer so the windows key was replaced by a second function key and that made using the sublayer so much easier too!
---
it's totally worth it. you will learn to drain souls during all your regular activities  
---
you get a free pet for every time you rez in battlegrounds  
---
I own 2 soul shard bags and i keep them full, in my bank in case i ever run out. if i need more i just run a 5 man dungeon and drain nonstop.
---
I said "too easy" as in easier than they already are.
---
There is a lot of stuff that doesnt make sense to implement in future phases since they decided to keep the 1.11 item stats.
---
All the raids untill AQ will be a breeze anyway now and some of the stuff that will be implemented later is worse than some stuff that is implemented now.
---
Nah just save your money to train skills and get your mount.
---
Also innervate. Basically allows a healer to spam heals for 10s
---
Right. Which is why we need more data. They’re almost guaranteed to not be using true random numbers since those are extremely expensive to generate. Most games use pseudo-random numbers which most people agree is good enough. What I’m saying is that it seems more biased towards streaks than I’ve found with RNG in other games. 
---
Again, humans are terrible at recognizing true randomness. Including me. Which is why we need more data. 
---
If love to be proven wrong. It would mean less work for me. If I’m right we have to gather stupid amounts of data, get enough attention so that Blizz takes notice, prove it’s biased within a certain margin of error, etc. If the initial data gathering, far less than what’s required to prove a hunch, proves me wrong I get to shrug my shoulders and walk away.
---
he was talking about raids, so i don't think you need to precise that, except if he intended to raid before lvl 52...
---
Just to provide you more context. This is how it looks:
---
https://youtu.be/bTSzhJTHS5I
---
I second this! I would love to change my font.  How are people doing this?!
---
ahh since you're stalking my posts, try to find the commonality between all the threads I shitpost in
---
I actually find it less useful than the original manual snipping. I liked that it went to a separate window I could mark up with highlights, circles, etc.
---
Is there a way to preserve that portion of the functionality while retaining the hotkey?
---
Since I am using a guide my goal is 5 days. A little optimistic but I think it’s possible.
---
I don't open lower than 225.
---
Save it til your mount. Just focus on the absolute necessary talents you need while leveling til 40. You can buy a few consumables but as a druid, you probably don't need any. You can run dungeons for armor. SM library/gy will be coming soon for you and you can get some armor from that.
---
The only time this happened to me was with a mage as well.  A scholo run, the mage rolled need on a +shadow damage item.
---
lol, theyre bags 2 slots bigger than the ones you can get readily. It doesnt impact anything aside from memes. Besides, If I'm rollin up to raids with 30 shards, a tank can fill his bag with shit too.
---
I was referring to phase 2 and world pvp. Being a lone wolf who hates pvp is going to be rough during that.
---
Blizzard makes the enemies so slow they won't move anywhere. And if he starts it after some time he won't even pull aggro.
---
Thanks for clueing me into that. I had no idea. I'll try to do some research on that.
---
Might be a silly question, do set bonuses grant per item, or just for having them all equiped? 
---
I'm looking at the blue dragon scale mail set and am curious to know if the added resistances will be 4 for having two items equipped or +4 per item.
---
I said I’m trying not to be too mad about a video game. I still got up and went to work today, lol. Just had to share my frustrations with some people not in my guild who would understand
---
Hmm I haven’t heard of that one.
---
But the caster form also got 360% armor :P
---
Bought mine for 300g. Seems to be about the going rate on Pagle US Alliance
---
The players failed with their nochanges protest. Blizzard never intended on no changes. They planned on changing many things, and they did.
---
More utility decisions in trees. Often you have to decide between DPS or utility, and obviously dps will win. Make more decisions purely utility preference.
---
Thanks mods for running the giveaway, I'd love one of these!
---
Leveling with 2 of my friends but because of different irl responsibilities, I'm finding myself with more time to play classic than them.
---
Was thinking of rolling an alt with the only goal of using that alt to farm for gold. What should I roll? Playing as alliance on Kromcrush if it makes any difference.
---
As a warrior I am on your side, Lately I have decided to only DPS dungeons because dealing with other PUG dps makes me want to pull my hair out. It takes me 10 seconds to find another group as a tank so if DPS wants to be an asshat I'll leave every time.
---
While I feel bad for your other party members (assuming they weren’t acting like the mage), I see no problem in you leaving. You can pretty easily find another team as a tank and shouldn’t have to deal with DPS acting like that. I’ve come to have a disdain for most mages because of the attitude of some of them with AOE farming. Unfortunately a few have ruined it for most.
---
There's also RP and general marketplace manipulation/domination. Transmog might now be a thing in classic, but that won't stop people from attempting to collect items they want to wear either. I don't disagree with what you're saying, though.
---
Make the game more trivial than it already is, i guess
---
Yeah he did. He edited it.
---
Amen! I mainly play a priest and I almost always feel bad for the tank. I constantly find myself telling the DPS to chill the fuck out. The main reason I don't want to play a tank is that I don't feel like I know the dungeons well enough. My absolute favorite is hunters that instantly feign death after shooting a mob the tank didn't get to tag yet, just dumping all their threat on me...
---
Pro tip to all DPS out there: If you get aggro, stop attacking and run TOWARDS the tank!
---
1.35 silver.
---
Is it? What was their time at this point? I know their final time was something like 4 days and 21 hours.
---
Yeah! I'm the DPS and i usually lead/organize all my groups.
---
There are those 2 tanks that i really love cus all i have to do is set the Skull in ANY mob pack and they just charge/pull with LOS.
---
I LOVE those guys, the runs are WAY smoother and faster.
---
delet this
---
Thanks!!
---
Only once per set.
---
Tank probably meant charm, which the warlock can do. 
---
Either way, fuck the warlock for not sapping. Such trash omg
---
/s
---
Reminds me of the post the other day where the guy had a warlocks and never used a shield, kept dying and blamed the warlocks for not using their ice stuff...
---
Do you feign after summoning the pet and just run past the bosses on the way to your pillars?
---
It indeed should never be released this early. Cause when they do we are gonna have people like you, who dont understand the power of some items in there, complain about how OP rogues are all of a sudden. 4 piece rogue set is better than T2. Hell even arguments for naxx. Do you think people gonna enjoy having their 4 BIS items in phase 2? That's 25% instantly done. Lameee
---
If you can't dedicate evenings of WoW you don't DESERVE endgame!!!
---
But I just want a fun video game to play now that I am a grown man and no longer the teen who WoW'd in vanilla
---
Overheals means youre topping off the tank. You are clueless to healing
---
I *loathe* that kind of mindset with a passion. It's so short-sighted and ignorant. Like, just do the fucking dungeon normally and don't fuck it up and we'll be done in no time.
---
Just to top it. Was doing a couple of scholo runs the other day. First run Hand of Edward The Odd drops (300-500g), my friend a warrior won it. I won a couple of enchanting recipies, they sold for around 80g. 
---
Second run.. Cloudkeeper legplates drops. I didnt even know it was worth that much. My friend warrior passes (he is such a nice guy), he wanted to distribute the epix among us. I win, and 2 days later im 900g richer.
---
So in 2 runs.. I made around 1000g. :) Pretty decent. Payed for Hide of the wild + Cassandras grace + full enchants on my full PreBiS gear. Now sitting at around 700+ healing.  On the same day I reached the 900g for my epic mount. So... In 1-2 days I could afford epic mount + hide of the wild + cassandras grace + enchants, and even a little gold to spare. :)
---
Due to the above im pretty much set for rest of classic, no need to focus that much on gold, as I only need gold for consumeables + enchants on upgrades from raids. :)
---
It's not that unlikely. If you have a pull of 30 zombies you have about 30% chance to have a resist.
---
yeah, lightshot is great, very intuitive and as bonus I don't need Win key enabled. Would recommend it to anyone
---
Wands don’t boost spell damage unless it’s “____ wand of ____ wrath”. Different wands do different types of damage though, so some mobs might be immune to one wand but not immune to another.
---
If you get gear with enough intellect to have enough max mana for it, you can easily solo farm lashers in DME as holy spec just spamming holy nova. It's a very consistent ~30g/hr without herbalism and ~50-60g/hr with herbalism. There's videos on youtube you can check out.
---
...If only it were restricted to tinder :(
---
Lol. I am in STV, Arathi, and Hillsbrad right now. I am on a PVE server but I have been seeing a fair amount of Horde in all those places. Someone might have a better answer, good luck.
---
No because I knew going in that Alts are like drugs- committed to 1 and only 1 toon until 60 then I would let myself have alts. It’s the only way to fly if you’re a self-actualized altoholic

---
In that case i would not recommend to buy it. Get a executioner cleaver instead for leveling IMO, if you can find one that's cheap. Or another similar big 2hander.
---
Moonglow gives 9% efficency. MOTW gives a lot of INT. Especially in Dungeons that kind of comes out as a wash. You dont heal much worse in motw/ns.
---
44 Warrior, 42 Hunter, 40 Warlock... you might be on to something. I wouldn't call it boredom, though... just enjoying the leveling experience, I guess. Not in a hurry to get to 60 and spend all my time in dungeons.
---
As long as they know ur gonna roll on it it's fair game
---
All of our tanks are sitting on multiple pieces of Might gear as well as a few rings and other FR pieces. Fury drops are so rare in MC it would be a real dick move to take one of the few things we can actually use.
---
Your fury warriors show up every night to support you with the knowledge they probably won’t get any loot at all. Don’t take one of the few things they have.
---
I'll add that if you have a wand that deals shadow damage, you'll do more damage with it as you stack shadow weaving.
---
the time it would take to walk to one makes that pointless, in this situation id just res sick and hearth.
---
Plus the more ogres you skip the more likely you are to not get a shackle key that run. So you're potentially either denying your Tribal LW a great pattern, or denying the group the chance to roll at a $$$ pattern.
---
MC!  I have been throwing horde into the lava pit in searing gorge last couple days haha
---
I do the same thing. The windows key is a menace.
---
lmao i didn't know what to expect and it still delivered
---
Did you do a cursory youtube or google search, ask a friend that was already playing wow, or ask any questions in the level 1-6 zone before/after you paid for a subscription?
---
Dead server
---
That's really interesting, I've never seen that addon! I'll consider trying it out. It looks like it would save me a lot of time. :)
---
Also, to answer the bit about damage types, it's simply the school of magic that the wand uses to deal damage and is generally irrelevant unless using the wand against a target that is resistant or immune to that school of magic, which is why I usually carried two wands while levelling, so if I ran into a mob that was immune to one school, I'd switch to the other.
---
It's not even stuck up. DPS can't pull the raid boss when they feel it's taking too long, so why are mobs in a dungeon any different? If they don't want to be a part of a team then they shouldn't join a group.
---
Guildie of mine payed 350g on Sulfuras.
---
Wasn't going to a raid, it was just our first guild run of the place and no one knew any of it but the guy leading it insisted on skipping a lot. We ended up wiping like 5 times throughout
---
FYI: you can change prt sc to act as Win+Shift+S in windows 10 settings.
---
Is there any shared auction houses in vanilla?That you can somewhat transfer items from horde to ally through the AH?
---
This whole thing is honestly a non issue since tanks get to make the rules. If you don't like it find another tank.
---
yours.
---
We use a prot pally for p3, as she comes down he spams GBoK, she runs right to him.
---
Was questing there just fine a few days ago. I noticed most 60's just leave you alone as they're on the way to do other things. I'm sure the time of day you're questing has a lot to do with it as well.
---
The xp tracker under your party frames &gt;_&lt; move em!!!!
---
Some very important uses for raiders like /u/necropaw said, and it's a pain in the ass to farm, you only really get it from players naturally getting lucky while leveling when ever they kill the mobs that drops clams.
---
I'll give it a go, for sure. Auctioneer is nice, but has many issues. Just figured a first timer would have an easier time using twitch installed addons, for the most part.
---
They literally recreated spell batching to appease people who enjoy things being laggy.
---
Do you have a link to this?
---
I feel you. Just warning you because I know people who were banned for 72 hours for the same thing in vanilla.
---
For me I guess I visualize the character at 40 with all that fun stuff, then when I get there I'm like.. what now?
---
I walked across the continent to see my friends character for the first time in the wetlands. He was a little dwarf warrior with fiery weapon it blew my mind =]
---
No life sounds much worse than smelly.. gotta rethink those descriptions
---
Westfall is the default graveyard, and the game will fall back on it if you die somewhere weird.
---
On HotW/NS build:
---
I like the idea of a build focused on dungeon content since I won't likely be raiding often. I enjoy tanking and healing so this seems perfect. My only concern is, since 5 mans will be my priority, would Leader of the pack (3% crit) be more beneficial to my group than having NS?
---
Yeah, but it's pretty much guaranteed that as a random PUG you're not going to have a full group be able to pull it off every time. For every group that can work smoothly, you'll get six that ends up wasting half an hour trying to skip two trash packs.
---
Oh lol it's a thing in retail WoW. It's kinda like Diablo where stats have ranges so you need to get lucky on top of getting lucky for it to drop
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
well i disagree with that. it's not that binary in my opinion.
---
Havent played retail, but ran out of things to do on my 60 mage and didnt feel like leveling an Alt in classic. 
---
Downloaded Retail and felt completely lost, leveling 1 to 10 I only saw 2 other players, and that was only when I wandered through Ironforge to get my professions. I have no idea what to do in the game, but I do love the graphic &amp; movement improvements and it felt 'finished' without loading any addons which was nice.

A website for weakauras and stuff. Check it out, it’s great!

I printed out a map with the level ranges of each zone, only guide you really need. You can always respec at 60.
---
Ever considered some players consider this stuff basic and expected?
---
People open trade with me when we start dungeon spam, they say nothing, we both know they want water, I give em stacks. 
---
Who cares?
---
Up until 30 I don't think it matters much. Go arms at 30 and have a high level friend help you get your WW axe and you will break the game for the next 7 or 8 levels.
---
Bingo.
---
Also I like killing stuff. I enjoy playing the game. Feels like I barely am playing when I am running past everything basically on a loot treadmill. Feels like when people overplay the game they get tired and try to drag everyone else on their own jaded schedule.
---
Galaxy brain is watching threat meter and choosing your shock appropriately

Gadgetzan, Booty Bay and there's one other I cant recall.

Booty bat and gadgetzan have the shared AH
---
Playing horde, second week as level 60 venturing with my friend, to redrige, killing the flightmaster and various guards. Then proceeding to slay lowbies mercilessly for 30 minutes
---
Absolutely, I agree with you there. I will usually ask that first but if they are all friends or guildies then you have no choice but to leave.
---
no, it just makes losses longer and more drawn out.  The only real time to use a shield is versus a caster mob because you can cancel spell casts with the shield bash skill.
---
Nope. All need. BoEs are tradeable, if you want it you can buy it any time you want on the AH. 
---
Everyone deserves a chance at BoEs or any tradeable worth 10g or more. You win the roll, you can decide to gift it, or sell at a discount, or AH it.
---
Forcing everyone to pretend BoEs are BoPs only creates half a dozen potential problems for no reason.
---
My bis for most of the game is warden staff. It's barely better than my maul. If it drops, I'll tell everyone to /need - everyone deserves a chance at 300g+
---
Just because I can equip it or use it doesn't make it more valuable to me - if I want it I'll buy it off the AH because it's tradeable - that's the entire reason Blizz made certain items BOE instead of Bop!
---
You sound like my wife trying to find the perfect dining experience, and I get this a bigger decision than that, but the point is that just about every decision is good decision, there’s no bad decisions and there’s no best decision.  
---
There is just having fun, and don’t stress the small things.
---
150 is nothing for a warlock.
---
Hmm, compelling argument.
---
That's too bad. I get tipped more often than not. Highest has been 4g.
---
P1 she casts wing buffets on the tank which reduces their threat. This means if p1 goes on long enough, the tank will lose aggro. 
---
P2 fireballs target highest threat target and reduce threat by 100% divided among those hit. Use this to your advantage to control p3 threat. No threat can be generated during p2, only reduced via fireballs. 
---
What we've done for most success is have 1 tank in p1 tanking and a 2nd putting themselves around 9th in threat. Dps go fairly hard so phase goes fast, just don't pull aggro. Unload at ~72% so phase 2 goes fast. P1 tank stacks with casters and they all eat a few fireballs to reduce threat. This means when she lands she goes to 2nd tank or one of the melee if they didn't get any fireballs (usually they do, that's why p3 tank was aiming for 9th in p1). If it doesn't go straight to tank, then have melee position her and the tank can pop recklessness + rage pot and go ham to pull aggro.
---
We do split runs with ~20 each and kill her very quickly with no deaths each week this way.
---
I can reliably get 35-40g an hour w/ no coffer keys, and 45+g an hour w/ Coffers Pickpocketing in BRD. That includes Opening boxes, vendoring and resets. If you are interested in my Method send me a DM.
---
I suppose you could do stealth herb runs in dungeons with the rogue, if you're not bothered about grinding mobs.
---
Thanks
---
That's what your doing right now though
---
It's not that I'm having problems finding groups as a tank. Blizzard created a more user-friendly system of gathering players for dungeons and named it "dungeon finder tool" but the players wish to roll back the technology and have that part excluded from the game. Excited to play Battlegrounds upon release? Have fun running to and standing around ashenvale wsg portal waiting for a game. If only there was a button or system that blizzard created to make this a little bit easier, where I'm pvp'ing more than I'm running to the area thatlets me pvp. If only there was a button that helps me find players who want to group with me and do the same dungeon that I want to. Oh, we have all of that technology already, but instead the community is so hung up on old traditions that they'd rather ride their bicycle to work 20 miles away because as a kid, it made me feel more accomplished when I got there. Let's just leave our cell phones at home too. No one brought those to school in 2004. Let's bring back 2004 everyone! Who needs technology improvements anyways!
---
You are a fucking joke.
---
Hows that 50k investment into popularity going
---
I wish they did. The Tauren mounts are ugly af.
---
No, Blizzard decided Census was bad and blocked the addon, so as far as I know, we don't have access to reliable population data anymore.
---
That said, if you want a PvP realm that has a decent but not dominant Alliance population, avoid Heartseeker (Alliance-dominated), Skeram and Stalagg (Horde-dominated).
---
Make sure you have the highest DPS wand available for your level. currently what I do is send my void walker in to attack something, I dot up a different mob and THEN dot up the mob I sent my voidwalker into attack. then wand down my initial target, and then wand down my voidwalkers target if needed. if I aggro a 3rd I put all of my dots on it and use fear. Don't forget that you can stop mobs from running AND stop fear with curse of recklessness. With some practice you can keep mobs a safe distance away from yourself with fear without aggroing other mobs. I believe if you have a high damage wand it's your best "filler" attack until mid 40's when drain life or drain soul become more efficient. 
---
Also make sure you're not fighting mobs that are too high of a level..if you can't handle multiple mobs as warlock I have a feeling you're fighting mobs that are too high for you. in general when grinding and questing you want to be fighting mobs and doing quests that are slightly below your level for the most efficiency.
---
Ah cool! So I can put items for 1 silver and let my friend who is ally snipe it then?
---
So just vanilla.. for the next like 10 years? Sounds boring af. Vanilla is fun but once all the content has been out for awhile it will get extremely boring
---
Iconic weapon but it's soooooo not worth the gold investment
---
Ah yeah that's true. I might take a break and just raidlog during p2 honestly. I've farmed enough pots etc for that to be a viable plan. I like PvP but only in controlled environments like BGs or Arenas.
---
I actually like the Ironforge text, but everything else is terrible
---
Nurr, except when people don't make the jump! Like in the original anecdote!

no
---
Why is it not enjoyable?
---
THIS.
---
400g on Deviate Delight. Wish I held out for the couple days and bought the already enchanted Sword of Zeal for 75g less. Oh well.
---
Fun probably
---
That's what you get for using GIFs in 2019.
---
Chance it to Webdings and you are my Hero.
---
Okay cool I will check that vid out. Yeah thanks for the words, guess it seems kinda crazy to farm 250g for these mats but that’s life I guess
---
Flurry axe is bis offhand, not just preraid. It doesn't get replaced by anything currently.
---
Short answer? Respec when you get nice 1h weapons. Go deep fury/Prot.
---
Long answer: get thrash blade from the Mara quest, it's quite difficult to replace until raid. Then get mirahs song for your offhand. It is also hard to replace until raid.
---
Gear for a dps tank. By that I mean mostly plate dps stuff, MAYBE one or two mail pieces. Focus on hit, Stam, and strength. Don't worry about stacking defense or anything. Don't forget a good shield. 
---
You now have the ability to to dps or tank anything. Wear a shield when tanking and DW when dps. An example was last night in UBRS on last boss I tanked adds and then swapped my shield for a weapon and proceeded to be 2nd in dps.
---
For talent points go deep fury focused on DW etc. Put the rest into prot for threat, armor, improved shield, and last stand. You have all the good damage from fury and all of the good mitigation from prot. You can tank raids like this. You are the perfect OT. Tbh you could MT this way if you wanted.
---
Horde and Alliance. Lol
---
Yeah because you get warstomp. So either take a 35% chance of roots working or storm and get 100% chance it works after you cast
---
With the route we took, this was actually the first boss!  After he left we spent 10minutes looking for another tank before our healer left to join another group, resulting in the group disbanding.  I just left and went questing for a bit in Feralas, made a chunk of gold, and called it a night!
---
It's still not a "taunt" though.
---
Generating threat =/= "taunt".
---
Funny thing is I was in the group on my rogue so I apparently should've been the one sapping the patrol that wasn't going to aggro?
---
&gt;Hunters have a “dead zone” that basically makes them unable to shoot or attack you. I believe it’s like a 5-7 yd range? Don’t quote me on that just get close to him.
---
Scatter shot has no deadzone. The hunter can save it for your deadzone nova, then trap you and get distance. If they're spec'd BW they can't have scatter shot, but they're pet will just maul you instead.
---
I mained a Mage in Classic and Hunter was the hardest matchup in the game. You're just going to lose most of the time unless you get the drop on them (even then, you'll lose plenty).
---
The boomer text
---
It's just not worth the risk for a tank to willingly take a plate dps in a pug for that reason. I initially wanted to roll a ret paladin because they are so much fun and I plan to pvp exclusively once honor comes out, but chose to tank for my gear until that happens because of how hard it is to find a group as a plate dps. Its shockingly easy to find 3 mages/warlocks and a priest to pug with as a tank and I get all the rolls I need for my tanking and pvp pre-bis. I have nothing against people that want to enjoy dpsing as a plate wearer, but they just wont get a spot over someone I dont have to compete with in my dungeon groups.
---
Restart after WotLK. I've been saying it for years. There is no other way to come back. This makes almost everyone happy.
---
Benediction seems to be pretty fair. I’d say slightly horde dominated but not by much.
---
Click click click
---
You are the exception, not the rule. I rarely get to land in LHC or TP without there being 5-10 horde camping the flight master during prime time. Will get explosively worse in phase 2.
---
Auras are not buffs, they don't generate threat.
---
I agree on the head, but its a matter of winning the roll for it against everyone else. It is a goal of mine though, and definitely agree on getting the neck over the trinket.
---
Sadly, I am alliance, so that awesome trinket is unavailable.
---
I'm at 60. Seen it drop twice. First time a sub-60 shaman who kept backpedaling into groups (wiping us once) won it after exclaiming that they didn't know it existed.
---
If a raiding guild wasn't farming MC I would avoid that guild lol.
---
why ? you can bubble one paladin, while the other spam greater blessing of kings on 40 people at a time until the bubble stop.
---
Well this helps to know.
---
Hunter and Warrior with.nightfall are even bigger meme spec 😂

I like to leave freezing traps in front of instances and see if I can burst down alliance scum before they can get back inside. (not low levels though, I feel like that's rude.)
---
Warlock, druid, shaman, hunter? Lol
---
Blizzard is actually really unreliable in this case, a number of hyenas run right through it without being slowed. I've seen an example of using double Ice Block to get them all grouped up in the corner but the margin for error is razor thin, if your timing is off by a fraction of a second you die. I have a suspicion that it's a result of the spell batching implementation in Classic. I spent hours grinding dogs and bugs in DMN on private servers and it doesn't work the same in Classic at all. A bit of a shame since it was my favorite gold farming method but Lashers are still a good earner.
---
&gt;Even if I trap they can ice block it, then likely have another block w CDs.
---
If they IB you just run away with cheetah and let your pet stay on them. If they don't waste CDs (blink / nova) they won't catch you and if they waste CDs you kill them.
---
I've been 60 since the beginning of September, my point is that it's not a problem of wow if you have nothing else to do its a problem with you for playing too much.
---
This would only be amazing if you were also named Papyrus.
---
Auctioneer its called.
---
The level of the food is what matters o. Happiness so if the fish are not good enough than give him higher level food
---
Tanks in charge, heals are in charge of sitting in the back following the tank.
---
Exactly my feelings, Warlock was so incredibly boring at 60 I dumped him and rerolled Shaman. I just leveled him to 60 and it's SO MUCH FUN, I'm playing a 30/0/21 build so I can both heal raids and oneshot people in pvp.
---
you can probably get to mid 30s easy following this tips:
---
Do dugeons killing everything with your main and just have afk following your low level.
---
Invite more people, the exp you get will increase as more people are in the party (bonus exp group).   
---
i did this with a mage and used to just pull everything and aoe them down, you can probably do it about the same speed depending on what your warrior is, if its a dps you can probably just pull and kill on the spot and be about the same, as prot you will need to make big pulls, and you can invite mages to help you with aoe and thats it, use granades, thorns set and you are set.
---
I use hunters mark as a way of saying “I see you fighting that mob. I’m not gonna kill you. Don’t try and kill me when you have the chance” but I guess this explains why that never works
---
In my opinion, the best spec for most warriors right now is 0/31/20 or some variant (I run 0/32/19).  You can tank any 5 man, OT any raid fight, and still do decent dps.  Do 17/34/0 fury warriors do more damage?  Yes, it sucks not to be able to stance dance/Overpower easily.  Do prot warriors tank better?  A bit, but honestly it's not a dramatic difference.
---
In this spec, you spend most time raiding in dps gear, then OT if needed for Garr, Sulfuron, Majordomo, etc.  So it's normal to want both gearsets.  I've tanked BRD for a chance at Hand of Justice; DM North for a chance at Tarnished Elven Ring, etc.  As long as you're upfront at the beginning, it's fine.  You don't want to decide on the fly that you're going to roll need.  So a simple message to the party outlining what you're after in the instance avoids problems later.
---
The commonality in nearly every comment you make seems to indicate you’re a bit of a dick buddy
---
Im not a warrior. But from what I understand:
---
Special attacks like HS have a way lower hit cap than white hits.
---
So you press HS just after your mainhand hit. While HS is toggled but hasnt hit yet your offhand white hits are calculated with the special attack hit cap. Just before your mainhand hits again you cancel HS, since usually you don't actually want to HS. Repeat.
---
I guess after a while this becomes somewhat of a muscle memory, while optimal cat powershifting changes a lot.
---
This is all very minmaxy though. For "regular" DPS pretty much all rotations are rather simple. Its more about managing cooldowns, conumables and actual DPS uptime while not dieing and not pulling aggro.
---
If you're doing guild runs it's very common to prio first head to the tank since the neck piece is so good. Its usually not nearly as objectionable since you're guaranteed a head drop each clear.
---
Item tokens started in vanilla, they'll be here with AQ
---
Use the pillar to los the poison cast. Makes it easy.
---
Thank you. You answered my question while also reinforcing what I already felt. I gear like a dps warrior most of the time, with maintaining hit cap and getting a lot of crit, in order to make sure that my threat is sufficient not to cap our dps.
---
But in the end, you're right, the belt is simply too good for fury warriors. I can get other gear.
---
Mages are good, as a mage you will get a raid spot easily, but gearing is one of the slowest along with warrior. So you need to decide are you ok with getting very little loot to be op.
---
All in due time... I wanted to check AH prices first just to make sure :)
---
That sounds about right. I was getting 8-10 per skill tick at the end there as well, though I did mine in Azshara.
---
yes sadly Fire Nova Totem wont do anything here, as the Hyenas you did not yet hit will attack it immediately.
---
it might be possible to time it, but i think its too inconsistent (maybe with the Improved Fire Totems talent)
---
if you play your cards right i could be your dick buddy, buddy
---
Never wait for the mages mana, only the healers. If the mage starts to complain about not drinking, at least he isn’t pulling and wiping the group.
---
For someone who hasn't played or paid attention to Classic Wow, but played way back in the day - how have things been going for this reboot?  Are people enjoying it/sticking with it?  Issues?
---
What is my next move ? I’m a lvl 23 night elf Druid and I did most of the quests in Darkshore / auberdine then came over to eastern kingdoms and did vc four times as tank, healer, healer, dps. Now I’m questing in redridge when I can, but I seem really underlevelled for the zone . I need to be carried or in a large group to do most of the quests. I tried to do the dungeon by Ashenvale ( ? )but had absolutely no luck finding a group, and someone told me I should be working for stockades next. I’m not exactly sure where that even IS to be honest .. I have flight path to Ironforge too, and couldn’t get to Felwood due to serious ganking by horde.
---
Mc and difficult,😂
---
An upgrade is an upgrade. And a weapon is a MUCH bigger deal for a rogue than it is for a caster.
---
Looks horrible.
---
I've seen it once, and a warrior who dinged 60 in the dungeon with us won it.
---
I've only seen the bracers off Rend once too, and a lvl 58 won them.
---
Such is life since I refuse to reserve gear. I do think I might try to exclude any warriors other than those who already have it though (guild runs).
---
I assume you're disagreeing with the person before me, bc I *totally* agree with you.
---
If you like doing more dps drop 100 on zeal, thats a good deal; I agree that mc checks mechanics rather than dps, but i like doing more dps and it cerainly wont make it harder. Its very likely that your dalrends grind is going to take longer than the time itll take you to farm another 100 ( probably even 250...) gold, and zeal mirahs is pretty much equivalent to dalrends, unless the proc rate is very low.
---
i found a gold pearl like the first week classic came out and they were auctioning for 1g which was the same as vendor price. so i just vendored it. now i wish i saved it and also bought up all the others
---
Is that a screenshot of a phone's camera app???
---
Launch wotlk :P
---
Yes you have to LOS the final boss like you do thornhoof. I believe you use the pillar in the back of his room and have the tank put him right up against the pillar while you strafe around the other side to LOS the boss. You pretty much lose if you get poisoned.
---
All the way to 50?
---
Go enhance shaman for leveling and roll resto later on if you do go horde. Shaman is great.
---
My favorite moment was grinding out and finally getting my tiger mount for my gnome warrior
---
Even if this somehow does solve Paladin's threat issues, you still have the other issues of:
---
* No taunt
---
* Can run out of mana
---
* No cooldowns (last stand, shield wall, lifegiving gem)
---
* Lower base health
---
* Less defenses
---
* Cannot become uncrushable without eating a crit first
---
* Threat scales more with spell damage; almost no spell damage gear with +def or other defensive stats
---
* etc. etc.
---
At best, this will make it so a T2-geared Paladin can tank MC or something, but not really much else.
---
Also, very misleading title OP, generating threat is not a "taunt". There are lots of situations where you need a taunt, like bosses that drop your threat, or mobs that ignore threat and keep switching targets.
---
It isn’t pointless. Otherwise you’d have BC in 6 months. Take some time and enjoy the game
---
Ok, they run wild for 10 seconds, then what? Tell the healer not to heal him, don't hit any of the mobs he pulls, they run back to him and does he die and wipe the group or does he tank it?
---
Just giving my perspective on the question asked.
---
the math checks out, but not the logic behind it
---
Oh this is a fun one! I get that they can't undo a lot of their changes, so I'd be happy with essentially compromising between the two game's ideologies:
---
* Combine the old and new talent trees. E.g., all Mages have access to Arcane, Fire and Frost trees simultaneously. You still only gain 1 Talent Point every 15/10 levels, and each tree's row of 3 is still an exclusive-choice. But you can build up multiple trees, like you can in Classic. 
---
* Actually utilise flying as part of the travel and exploration; currently you just use it to fly over everything. My idea only works with something akin to flying islands with different elevations though...
---
* Remove random values on drops. No Titanforging or anything (but of course, greens with 'Sword of the X' etc is fine).
---
* Bring back a sense of exclusivity; put useful, awe-inspiring items in the game, that can only be gotten on the harder difficulties (instead of just an item-level jump). And maybe turn off Transmog for those items, until it's no longer the current Expansion. 
---
* Remove the necessity of daily chores (AP grinds, etc).
---
* Class-customised raid gear. E.g., take the base look of raid tier Plate armour, but Warriors customise it with chains, spikes, scratched-in tallies. Death Knights customise it with tied-on limbs, vials of ichor, skulls, visages of pain. Paladins customise it with ornamental wings, paper seals, cloth to accentuate, etc.
---
/em glares in shadow priest
---
why dont you use the auction house like a normal person and then decide what to auction and what to vendor?
---
Have a look at shedo the druids work on cat DPS. There are lots of intricate changing variables with powershifting for Max cat DPS.
---
It's simple, Blizzard wanted to go the safe route with Classic - that means repeating vanilla's shortcomings apparently.
---
I would say most people love it!
---
Better than what? Definitely not better than Dal'rends, the set bonus ensures that. Better than Axe of Deep Woods? No, the damage from that axe surpasses the one extra hit per minute that Thrash gives you.
---
Regarding thick hide I'd say it's a nice to have talent rather than a must have. At very high armor values you're seeing 1% mitigation which is like 5% damage reduction. So I ask you. Would you put 1 a talent point into something that gives you 1% damage reduction? You're still a giant sponge without it and 10k ac vs 11k ac in bear is negligible. The best benifit is when you see large stacks of sunder armor debuffs, but as a bear this is already fine.
---
Omen of clarity is godtier. I've thought about getting it but with better mitigation gear you will struggle with rage in 5-mans. And swipe can proc it with each Target hit. Not to mention on big AOE pulls if omen procs you can barkskin then hurricane for free. You can also get a free swipes worth of threat if you time it right. Omen just doesn't return great results on big bosses I'm raids because rage is essentially infinite (bwl, as sometimes I'm rage starved in mc)
---
And for natural shapeshifter and bear power shifting. Play with furor 5/5 and grab a wolfshead helm for 5mans. Tell me that getting 20 rage a shift isn't amazing. Free instavast swipe as soon as you powershift helps a ton on AOE pulls. Try it.
---
It’s a bit of a hyperbole that every class can do everything.  But every class has a CC, a self heal, an escape button, and a movement ability.  It really dulls the uniqueness of the classes.
---
For basic 5-mans you probably wouldn’t have any issue whatsoever without a tank.  But everyone just uses group finder so you usually have one.
---
You would think tanking ZF is the equivalent of doing a tour in Afghanistan reading some of these posts. 
---
I’ve tanked all the way to 58 so far and have never ran into these ridiculous mages using blizzard on single targets or melee hunters. Shitting on dps is the meta for karma farming though lol
---
Can confirm grinding dal rends takes ages. 
---
3 weeks 60 only dropped once and lost the roll.
---
Rage Rogue is fun imo, but to do any dungeon I basically act like a tank without any of the utility. So I am on the other side. Raid was nice cause I get to dps.
---
If it were that simple I'd do that, but I'm asking for advice here - thanks for your help.
---
Well if the leaks of the new xpack are true, you might be getting something close lol. Lorewise, anyway.
---
Of the owl
---
I get your point, but the way you're communicating it is so wrong... You should just stop dismissing other people telling them to play other games... Do you really expect others to empathize and agree that the game doesn't need any QoL-like changes by telling them to fuck off like that? I'm guessing the answer is you simply don' care, but then why even make the effort to communicate if that's the case? You are the literal personification of u/automenuu's comment, which why I said it's almost as if he summoned you.
---
Ultimately though, I agree it's a recursive issue so long as the developers allow it. But there's no such thing as not having the time to play an MMO, that's just the way *you* play because *you* want to reach as far as possible. The way you might think MMOs should be played is not universal.
---
Since I joined in the middle of WoD, I only have so many memories. My favorite, by far, would be the day of the Legion's pre-patch launch. We all knew our favorite Alliance King was going to fall in the battle, so hundreds of people gathered in Stormwind Keep and celebrated his life and hosted a massive farewell party.
---
I tanked, healed and dpsed dungeons from 1 to 40 or 45.   You can do whatever you want until you get to BRD level. 
---
Just keep gear sets in bank that fit the role - Heal vs tank/dps.
---
I think i share this with a lot of people. But when i entered Molten Core the first time with my guild my jaw dropped.
---
Those huge giants. Huge dogs. We killed 3 Bosses and people got epic items. It was massive and such a cool experience for a 15y old kid.
---
I will never forget it. Pure Honor on Sunstrider EU, i had a damn blast with all of you in vanilla.
---
Update your questie - after I did they started color coating based on quest
---
It waant wrong to do that, yet the mage shluld have gotten licked and you shpuldnt have left
---
&gt;For the 4-pack ... just soulstone, run by them, die and rez? But you dont need to fight a pack of 4 ogres if your path is good.
---
This was my thought as well, should be good for getting past at least one pack if you don't get instagibbed
---
What percentage of your friends who played at launch are still around?   We had a 30 person Facebook messenger chat of people really excited to play, that has now dwindled down to maybe 6 or 7 active people.
---
Whats the quest line for the item to transform people, and is it permanent or it disappears in a few days?
---
And demonforged armor.
---
So, nobody decided to take the time to explain the detailed mechanics of not pressing W while landing on the mini platform?
---
I make it a point to thank players for using threatmeters.
---
After two or three "rescues" I only peel mobs off someone if they're a caster, or the hunter standing next to the healer.  Rogue wants to tank?  Let em.  Shaman wants to burn blow earth shock; no problem.  And it isn't a thing when you look at threatmeters.  
---
When I'm running a 1.2K to 300 lead on threat and you rock up and rip the mob away from me, you obviously had a purpose.  Maybe building up your defense skill or something.  Don't know.
---
And it isn't any sort of ego trip either.  I've DPS'd in instances as well; and as a fury warrior, I pull a respectable #2 or 3 on a regular basis.  WHILE dropping into defensive stance for overpulls.  While blowing rage on piercing howl to keep mobs from running.  Because an instance run is 5 people against the instance.  Not me against my personal best highest crit.  And when I pull threat; I stop my attacking and let the tank pick it back up.
---
Depends on who you're raiding with. I'm in a fairly casual guild but we just got our first raid nights done over the past weekend. We had 3 mages from our own guild + 1 pug mage both nights and didnt really have a problem with any boss. Some guilds might look for more than 8, some might just take whoever wants to go for the raid
---
Alliance side: followed my friend group here from Whitemane in the first xfer opportunity.  Finding groups without a guild can be tough but there’s a handful of good guilds to join up with.  Last week we one shot all of MC in one night.  Don’t expect to be able to pug any raids.
---
Did you take all the t1/t2 gear uncontested? Then you absolutely should not be rolling on one of only 2 DPS plate items in the entire first raid tier until everyone else has them.
---
You are being what's commonly referred to as a loot whore. Same with Brutality blade, it's an awful tank weapon and you should absolutely be passing it to rogues/fury wars.
---
I am trying to get a trinket from a rare elite mob that spawns in the 12-36 hour range. I have yet to even find a dead corpse. I read somewhere that the corpse will hang around for about an hour. Is that true? If that is the case, I can create a document and track the aprox. spawn time if I see the corpse. This all hinges on the fact that the corpse does hang around.
---
THIS MAN KNOWS IT. I've been running a Trade/World/LFG Chat PUG for 5 weeks now constantly doing 8/10 in one night. Knowing the fights and doing your job makes them trivial. Douses and people caring to do PvE questlines is always the holdback for us.
---
Are you sure this mob is in the game in the current phase?
---
Paladins are amazing for this as they can cleanse poison as a backup, don't mind getting hit by imps due to their plate armor, and can aoe them down over time. They can also bubble the sac on demon boss.
---
Priests need to LOS the poison, and killing imps takes a ton of mana so your warrior friend better have a good balance of offense and defense so you don't run OOM.
---
I would definitely say something.  "You wanna tank your own mobs, fine!"  (or something like that).
---
And people on reddit are supposed to know what your server market is like without you providing any information? Nobody here can magically predict a green will sell or not
---
Keep it up bro, with effort and patience, you will make it and receive the Holy Graal: Rhok’delar!
---
I was lucky enough my buddy gave me a bunch of soil samples when I was 30 something level and I already completed that quest in Darnasus!
---
Hey , thats me. I have 4 pc ns 1 bf . Onyxia neck double elven ring , hoj + blackhand as trinkets. I do mad deeps like this and im dreaming about viskag or brutality blade. 3-4 resets tons of ony runs 4-5 perds blade but no swords so far for my guild.
---
Why don't you go back to giving people relationship advice.
---
Which class has a raid talent spec that is most useful for running around on your own at 60 without having to respec?
---
The dungeon in ashenvale is black fathom deeps, it's about level 28
---
AITA WoW edition. Also no, you're not the butthole.
---
I never mind it because it's 3-4 clicks from me to help someone out, and the unsolicited ones usually tip well.
---
P2 too soon, still have many people not 60, and even more people without their full set of Dun 1 gear (myself included).
---
I do agree that P5/P6 is way too long for this, and that P4 or maybe P3 would be more appropriately placed.
---
I'd really like to see the math proving that an extra 94ap on 1/6 of hits is even 1% dps increase.
---
Meeting some really good friends raiding. This summer I took a road trip and met them, it was a blast!
---
i was about to write up your post exactly but decided to scroll down a bit and saw yours. damn

---
Bah. I've seen a couple vids but I'll definitely watch some more. Gotta get a shadow reflector at least.
---
This is totally agnostic of server market, these are just greens that regardless of the economy would have priority for people on the auction house
---
Yes. I read about the sunder strategy on here back when i was level 25 and was surprised by the dps increase.
---
Like I said, this was just because I was bored of slow 2-handers. So often I'd have a mob on 2-5% health, and have to wait 12 seconds before a swing connected.
---
It's nothing about actual performance, just that a more steady stream of hits is less frustrating.
---
&gt; I dunno if he even logged out over night.
---
Wait what? The bot didn't sleep? That's practically *cheating*!
---
As a tank I always give a few warnings. "Mage chill out a bit and let me get aggro". "Mage stop going ham, next time you pull it you tank it." "Final warning Mage, slow down or i'll leave." "Ok group, would you rather kick him or I find a new group?" It's only gotten that far twice and i left once and he got booted once, as a tank there's always another group so  no worries.
---
Yep. I'd gquit on the spot. Also haven't gotten a single piece of loot from 4 MC resets, while all the tanks have gotten 4-5 pieces of t1 and t2 helms.
---
If anything the tank is being a loot whore here by not letting dps war get any loot at all until he has everything he wants.
---
LoS and use pots as backup.
---
Depends on your definition of efficient.
---
Efficient for the mage? Yes, I’d agree with that.
---
But as a tank, efficiency is about the entire group. But most importantly efficiency is about healer mana. 
---
Packs of 2-3 elites should be Focus Skull, X 2nd, Cc Moon.
---
This ensures tank is only taking damage from two mobs at a time and easily holds aggro on both. Dps can go ham on skull because the tank isn’t splitting sunders between three mobs.
---
The mage should sheep and then frostbolt skull so they aren’t oom drinking every pull. This is great damage with more mage up time.
---
Lastly the healer is only healing the tank and only healing against two mobs’ damage, allowing them to weave damage between heals and *never* oom.
---
Focus firing mobs down one at a time with cc is vastly superior to AoE at the 2-3 mob threshold. 
---
Sorry to burst the bubble of all the mages who worship their damage meters, but this is how your class is best played.
---
&gt;Why not fix some bugs, why not give some form of QoL a chance which were obvious shit decisions even back then?
---
The common and frankly stupid logic is "slippery slope."  If anyone thinks mounting/dismounting QoLs can lead to class overhauls (even though I think most specs played like shit until TBC), how can you even argue against that kind of idiocy?
---
Uhh what are you doing?
---
I've healed for both types of groups. Meleecleave is way more consistent and pretty much as fast because you don't have to wait for mana.
---
Warlock has SM/Ruin, Hunter is also quite flexible.
---
Maybe 11 possible spawns but there will never be more than 3 up at a time
---
My friend and I (who also joined for Classic) and another guy were doing 3v3 Arena in WoTLK.
---
I was playing a prot paladin, my friend playing a disc priest and our other friend a feral druid.
---
We matched against a team where their main damage dealer was a DK with the Icecrown Citadel legendary; Shadowmourne.
---
We weren't really playing for any serious competition (although getting a higher rank was nice). But we did squish the other team and won. I remember my heart beating so fast and my fingers shaking and tons of laughing on voice chat afterwards.
---
Your play time is reasonably fast. I have 3 days 12 hours on my 40 but thats because I did a lot of profession grinding for engineering and mining. Dont worry about your speed your doing fine.
---
For the quests, i would download questie and see what green and yellow quests you have available and knock out the easy ones. Should be some in Arathi, Dustwallow Marsh, and Desolace. If you do end up farming SM just run Library as thats best for your level. If your healing you can do Armory as well (Library has a sweet staff though).
---
it works if you nova them after your ice block, there are a few vids on youtube showing how to do it in classic
---
but yes its a lot harder then on privat servers
---
Yep -- 55. As a healer/DPS you'll be more or less fine -- dps is a little IFFY as you'll miss quite a bit especially on the last couple of bosses, but its totally do-able. I'd suggest a tank to be 58+
---
The economy doesn't matter, this is more about which greens are more sought after in general
---
Yeah as you mentioned a healer is a good asset, but a warrior is not that great. I can follow my warlock with my paladin and heal+buff constantly which is very useful.
---
I'm a lvl40 warlock and cannot figure out how to get Eye of Killrog. Wowhead says that it is a book that can be bought from one of the warlock trainers in IF at lvl22 but I've tried all of them and none have this. How did you get yours?
---
Thanks for the input! I’ve optimized quite a bit since making the video a week ago - especially the slip’kik part. (And personally I never petpulled the 2nd pack, it’s just a safe way to do it for entry-level hunters).
---
The idea about this video though is for when beginners do make these timing mistakes, or buttpulls, or fuckups on the boss  - they don’t necessarily have to die :)
---
I have been doing lava runs with the most random groups of people I can find (ironfoe one day I swear) and it's always exciting seeing different classes since the lyceum can be super exciting without a mage/warlock
---
Ya... and the 5 silver tip. 
---
I'm not some nickle street corner rogue.
---
It's cute to think you can do absolutely anything at all ;)
---
Demoralising that.
---
Old guild sounds like the right statement in this instance.
---
Eyyy im gonna do the same thing with Mount and herbalism!
---
Dropping skinning, keeping tailoring.
---
Do you have a good video for The DM route?
---
Idk man Ironforge is pretty easy to navigate.  It's just a big circle.  Definitely easier than Org.  probably not as easy to get inside tho.
---
Yeah I think this is exactly what happened to me last night. 51 Hunter was attacking mobs in Blasted Lands, I'm not too worried about it so I opened up on a different mob within sight of him. Things are going fine until the Hunter's Mark pops up on me. That's unacceptable. I think he was probably thinking what you're thinking, because he didn't open up on me right away, but I wasn't taking any chances. I vanished, he set off some flares, I waited around for the right time... ambushed his pet, then two mobs and I ran a stab train on the hunter
---
Put it for a crazy price to avoid sniping and then buy back something useless for the same crazy amount
---
I saw 2 farming Timbermaw rep in about 30 minutes (was grouped and only won 1) and then I saw 2 more while I was farming Icy Weapon in Winterspring (solo total time 90 minutes).  In total I have gotten lucky and seen 4 in about 4 hours of farming.
---
Additionally, my mage is 53 so should be easy for you.
---
Pick a class, search for a guide. Realize there's about as many guides a you can open different tabs on your browser.
---
Narrow it down to somewhere between 3 an 54. Get a beer or a tea and take your time to pick the one that seems to suit you the most. 
---
Before you reach 30, you'll want to try another build. Do so. Keep on rocking until you feel the urge to try your own hybrid spec. Respec accordingly. Be very proud of yourself until you realize this or this other point is not optimal. Respec again.
---
At some point you'll feel you're lacking in some area and you'll want to try yet another build. A premade build this time, dedicated to something you really like to do.
---
You'll be happy with that build, except for a few ability points you'll fine tune with a final last respec.
---
Now roll another class. Learn new things, realize your other class' build is definitely not final ^^
---
Now you're just like most of us :) 
---
Oh, and there's this "meme spec" you should try too, at least for a few days !
---
You're just because jealous [my shoulders](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16823/nightslayer-shoulder-pads) have better boobs than your chest.
---
I get it but that never stopped us from kicking someone out of a group. In fact we've kicked people from our guild entirely because of terrible behavior. You don't want someone toxic like that in your guild.
---
Invisibility Potion and Lesser Invisibility Potion are on different cooldowns (aside from the standard 2min potion cooldown) maybe that helps
---
Leave classic? A good fresh pservers.
---
Go retail? A lot of money, I would need a lot of money.
---
Do you really have to ask? I tanked pugs from 1-60, maybe ran into 4 obnoxious dickwads. I placed them on ignore and moved on to do hundreds of successful runs without feeling compelled to add to the dozens of waaahh threads about tanking.
---
This sub is becoming a melodramatic, tank circle jerk. Use ignore list and move on... tanks are in demand, why get all caught up on a single dimwitted player?
---
For future reference, if you have nothing else to say thsn thanks, just hit the upvote button instead.
---
But the right spec is just for a little movement speed and vanish reset and I got both. And the route is just the never ending circle for which you take right about 8min right?
---
What do you mean with relog resets at the coffers though?
---
Hunter, but shaman was the first I saw in full t1(it was actually posted in this subreddit) except I don't think they had epic weapons.
---
Hunters can get the leaf which gives them the edge in gearing fast.
---
I didn't bother going with Imp. slam in my build as I was using Taran's Icebreaker and figured it's not worthwhile for such a fast weapon.
---
Improved execute Is brilliant though. Getting two executes off each mob in a dungeon is super satisfying.
---
Tanks sets the pace, i always start out pulling 1-2 small packs,  Gauge the heals mana after and dps and go from there. Obv if the heals is always 80%+ after a pull and dps is good.. should pull more if you are comfortable with it.
---
Wands
---
You will have a decent chuck of mages in any raid group. I was definitely worried I would be gearing slowly because of this, but a couple things to keep in mind concerning mage loot that I've noticed after raiding several weeks and getting a fair portion of raid gear on my mage.
---
1.) You only need three arcanist pieces. You only really want these three because individually the gear isn't that great (many pre raid items being better) but the three piece set bonus gives more spellpower making it worth it to have three and only three. This means the set pieces are gonna spread out much quicker in groups that have a lot of mages.
---
2.) Aside from the set pieces, all the other gear is rolled on by half the classes in the game. All the more rare gear that aren't set pieces are normally considered "caster items" so if you play another caster you would be rolling against all the mages in your group regardless. 
---
My group is at I think eight mages and we are all pretty happy with our loot so far. So I've just come to realize that loot scarcity isn't as much of an issue as you'd think for mages despite most raids having a lot of them. So roll a mage they are a ton of fun :)
---
It does matter, on small servers there may be a very small market for greens where big servers almost every green may sell eventually.
---
Is there anything outside of raid fights that have 315 defense? Like final boss of ubrs or something similar?
---
And theirs has limitations. Very specific limitations.
---
Corpses of rares are not different from corpses of normal mobs.  I wouldn't expect it to last longer than a minute or two.
---
My favourite WoW memory is unsubbing because Blizzard is a fascist-gobbling joke of a company that hasn't made a good game since 2007.
---
one shotting Ouro for the world first
---
&gt;Play with furor 5/5 and grab a wolfshead helm for 5mans. Tell me that getting 20 rage a shift isn't amazing. Free instavast swipe as soon as you powershift helps a ton on AOE pulls. Try it.
---
I have it's nice and safer than burning enrage, as long as I remember to eyeball my mana first..
---
It's not a bad trinket, for warriors the neck is better yes but for paladin i prefer the trinket.
---
I never really enjoyed them much, maybe that's why
---
Joining my guild!!! It was a random invite that I just accepted so I could stop receiving them but I’ve made some really good friends.
---
level up in ashenvale, do stockades, then BFD. You can do both of them at mid twenties
---
Why don’t you go back and give sex advice? Also reading post history before commenting, jesus :D
---
I did my last BRD last night and got my preraid bis mainhand/offhand/cloak, and upgraded my wand. I guess it was a going away party and I didn't even realize it.
---
Your gear and your wallet are the same thing when it comes to BoEs.
---
When I worked retail I would volunteer to work Tuesday mornings just for this reason, even scheduled college classes Tuesday mornings some times while in school
---
The lasting way to have fun in classic is to use it as a sandbox for your own adventures. I can see why you feel it's boring since it sets few objectives for the players. It requires players to go out and just do somethign on their own, which I think people were more willing to do in the original game. It was just more commen for games back then to be player drinven, not objective driven. The checklist style completionist stuff (achievements and all that shit) that all games have been using for the last decade where just starting to become a thing during the early 2000s.
---
I did so much silly shit back then in the open world. I don't really want to do that anymore because my time is more precious now. But the few times I tried, I just got asked, "What for? What's the goal? What's the reward?"
---
I think you need to play Classic like kids play anything. Just doing stuff for the sake of doing it. But most people play it like retail trained them to play it and then get frustrated because they lack of guidance through the game itself.
---
I don't charge as a DPS warrior.  I'll build the rage with white damage while the tank builds threat.
---
Age is just a number.... as is your character’s level.
---
just do what I do - underachieve and slack on gear and get fed epics anyways
---
Yeah but I really want to go DW so I'll try my luck with it and see how it's going
---
Nope not one bit. I'd definitely suggest attempting to kick the mage though if this was the case, especially if your group was solid to begin with. If the mage was the party leader, then leave the group 100%.
---
At least I'm not alone. So you said you have had the same problem for a few weeks. Does that mean that at one point it DID show "random enchantment" for you?
---
I’m curious how these players are going to be when ZG comes out. ZG is all about smart CC and being on top of your sheeps. At least that’s how I remember it back in vanilla. I’m curious if these days people are gonna try and AOE cleave that place too.
---
Lol I know it was a typo/autocorrect, but I just got my girlfriend to start playing recently and she’s very new to WoW and MMO’s in general. Last night she mistakenly called mana “mama” and it cracked us up, so now it’s kind of an inside joke for us haha
---
this guy recently posted a YouTube on some addons he uses. i like maximizing my screen real-estate so copied much of his dominos bars: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYDHzt6s_j8
---
This is the MOST warlock thing.
---
"They all have neat little labels on them... So I can forget them the moment I crush their even lasting essence to the power needed to rip another tool of a person through space and time, for use as fodder while I slaughter more and grow ever in power.
---
"Your friend's soul was used to summon a gnome warrior named 'shortstack'. I shoved him into the lava of black rock spire once his armor and body were too battered and broken to stand between me and the dragonkin."
---
It’s basically the rarest item warriors aim to get at this point. To try to farm it and potentially spend 5 whole days of saves instead of just hitting 60 and then farming dungeons for easily attainable items is totally counter intuitive. SGC is amazing, but it’s not going to do anything special on a level 59, or even a 60 in shitty blues/greens with a BIS chest. Plus you can easily 2 man it at 60, presumably he’s running it with groups if he’s not 60 which means he’s likely clearing other content in the dungeon(slowing down the grind) or he has competition on the roll.
---
Personally as tank, I'm passing the girdle to my dps warriors and just waiting in line for mine while they gear up. I'm still getting plenty tanking upgrades to keep me happy, i want them to be happy too. I'll get one eventually, but it's a bigger upgrade for them and i can get by with my brigam girdle for a while.
---
I was just looking for rare beasts, not the elites. Not sure if there's a difference
---
Downvoted due to awful background music.
---
Yes you are halfway there xp wise at around lvl 44 but when you get to that point you have tanaris, ungoro, wpl and winterspring which has some awesome quests.
---
You also get more xp from the quests and mobs so the difference arent that big.
---
yeah if you roll on hands of power as a warlock i will call you stupid, because you are.
---
Depends on how hardcore your guild is. If your guild is pretty casual, you can get away with a lot: deep frost mage w/ cold snap, elemental sham w/ 21 resto (healer in MC, dps while solo), fury and prot wars, certain rogue specs, etc.
---
play druid. You can tank and heal
---
Move herbs faster? They already sell damn near instantly. I can’t see alchemy adding much value to them outside of rare recipes.
---
Ashenvale, wetlands, stonetalon mountains, and duskwood should all have some quests to do. Stockades is in stormwind city itself by the mage district, but I would recommend leveling a bit more if you plan to tank it, as there is a level 29 boss there
---
😂
---
Druid tank 5 man content, Druid heal in raids. You might get a chance to tank raids, not a huge one. But that's exactly the slot a warrior is in anyway, you don't need many raid tanks compared to the number of tanks needed for 5 man content.
---
I've been destroying hunters and warlocks left and right as a warrior, even though they tried to gank me. People really suck I guess, but then again they're alliance.
---
It's a bit harder, but you will start liking it.
---
As a tank that first skip might be easiest and most forgiving since if you aggro them you can evade them.
---
Maybe if one person fails at it twice in a row problem isn't the skip but the player.
---
I started around Cata so I joined the party a bit late, but I'd argue that my fondest memory was finally hitting level 85 on my first character, a human priest. Then, i believe it was around the same timeframe, I made a death knight to tank as the blood spec. I ran duo arenas on this with a ret pally friend of mine and we were nearly unstoppable, between my sustain + dots mixed with his crazy damage. I don't think I ever enjoyed PvP as much as I did then.
---
Just as a good rule of thumb for you - look at the level of the last boss, if you arent within 3 levels you are likely too low for the dungeon.  So, for ZF - last boss is 48 which means you want the group to be 45+.  Exceptions can be made for heals or if you have someone way above the bosses level helping.
---
200g on everlook eu. At the time I bought it there were 8 blades ready to be bought ranging from 250 -400g. 
---
I asked in tradechat that i would buy for 200g and got an instant offer.
---
Yeah, the old talent trees had been gone for so long (before Classic), that I forgot how fun it was to have such malleable talent trees! Would be nice if some janky builds returned due to this, like Shockadin, etc. :)
---
That would generate 45 TPS at the cost of bleeding your mana dry. Not a good strategy.
---
Honestly, just don't throw away any trinkets and whatever you possibly do before 60 can't come back to bite you all that much.  Just have fun :)
---
I don't understand the idea behind world pvp without any actual pvp things to do......
---
T1 gear is garbage anyways so there's no loss there
---
It's a thing in auto racing too, consistency and smoothness often is faster because rushing is risky and a crash (or in this case a wipe) is a massive slowdown.
---
Jumping off the dam in Loch Modan with my Warlock friend Albirt, and then jumping off the platform in Thousand Needles. Both resulted in our deaths. It was magnificent.
---
Yes I have my hearth set to storm wind actually ! Makes to easy to get back and forth since I can teleport to moonglade. Thank you !!
---
Meh... the druid pvp set (at least 4 pieces) is pretty fucking lit. I'm 100% doing it because I love pvp, but that set is fire.
---
&gt; You pretty much lose if you get poisoned.
---
:&gt;
---
Wow! 3 whole pieces out of your 8!
---
T1 gear is shit
---
What’s 60 life like on the minority faction on an imbalanced server?
---
Horde bloodsail buccaneers here and I’m considering rerolling ally or another server altogether.
---
You just want to see their interrupt CDs? There was an addon on retails ages ago that showed all common interrupts in a bar, not sure if there's a classic version but it would've been super helpful without having to set up WA configs for it.
---
I've pugged 2 Onys since I hit 60 and we killed her both times.  I've seen multiple PUG MCs running on my server aswell, most of them end up killing 4-5 of the bosses.
---
lol he's full of it, TP isn't camped
---
This trinket is ruining the fun for me. It's BIS for a long time for me, since the chance on raid drops is very small. So it's a big upgrade to get it, if not the biggest for me (mage).    
---
Did about 40 runs now, where I lost the roll 29 times.  i've spend so much of my playing time to get it, and still no success. its not fun and grinding me out tbh
---
Yeah you were.  Not on the leaving part, but it's a passive aggressive chicken move to drop group and run away, screwing over your other behaving party members. Confront the guy, if he whines you can tell him he can leave and find another group or put up with it. I've done this myself in the past and kicked guys who would not cooperate.  I have also blacklisted tanks who would randomly flake out over one wipe or pull etc (I also heal) and I have a list I've kept for over 20 levels of flakers to not group with.
---
until that point I only had 2 people of hundrets where rational arguing would not give a result
---
It's just a 10 minute downtime isn't it?
---
Still taking my time getting to 60, almost 54.  Just going slow and having fun with irl friends when we are all on.  When I'm on solo I level my alt.
---
Take the sword skill for sure. That and perception. Why don’t you like your toon now btw? You want shadowmeks and dodge?
---
If you're going for R14, sure. The vast, *vast* majority of people PvPing aren't.
---
Yeah I think I have a problem where I can’t stand to see all the little quest markers lol. You’re right killing mobs could be good for me for a bit since I’m getting about 130exp per kill in redridge. I just have problems w horde there too.
---
All these times with the rectangular selection tool in paint. Now I'm going to betray my loyalty to paint. I ... I feel torn.
---
No you're not in the wrong. DPS should not be pulling. If the healer feels like they can handle more, they will say so.
---
Get the addon auctioneer and it will help you. All you have to do is scan the AH when you are close to one so when a blue or green drops you can see the price and how many are listed on the AH
---
I bought mine for 275g from a guildie, but on Kromcrush AH on they sell for 325-400g or so
---
Tanking dilemma: what would you prioritize, armor or stamina? What would be the equivalent amount of armor to stamina for raid tanking?
---
Yeah, that's how people do it. Just keep a sword and shield in your bags for tanking.
---
People can give a general guess for some pieces but a fair few greens are pretty dependent on server population
---
Nice circles, how does it feel to know your friend thinks you're retarded?
---
I thought spell power didn't affect Skullflame anymore.
---
I was a bad boy :p
---
You can also go north, there's a double set of coves, the first cove you will show up on hunter track humoids, but the second cove your out of range and they have to come look for you.
---
Can sometimes make it an hour or two before you get ganked as a lowbie.
---
I felt that at 40, then 50. I just kept pushing on to 60. If you really don't enjoy the class though, I get rerolling. I just can't bring myself to start a new toon when I don't have a max level one yet.
---
Alright, I'll start now. Get off of Tinder and stop playing so much WoW.
---
r/13or30
---
If I wanted to make an alt just for Mining/Herb, what would be the best class to do it with?
---
Aye, I only dabbled in vanilla raids, but raided pretty hardcore in BC/Wrath. But just look up some of the fight mechanics for the future raids, and you'll see that Blizzard stepped it up a notch.
---
New keyboard friend c:
---
Uther's Strength is also suprisingly good with this many pulls, as is the Enchant Chest - Absorption enchant.
---
Does the buff need to actually be applied to generate threat? We used to tank Phase 1 Nef with Battle Shout but after the first one the group needed to manually remove the buff to cause subsequent casts to generate threat.
---
Depends on how much it bothers you.  Look at your /played and is it worth it to relevel it for a purely aesthethic change with negatives of pretty terrible racials.
---
Razer naga?
---
It's ALL ranged attack power vs that target.
---
Any ranged mobs, and you are making them take more damage.
---
I'd absolutely kill you, given the chance.
---
 There is nothing you can add to something people don't like because it has to much added to it.
---
Also the current story (which i look up every now and again) is just stupid.
---
The only way I would return to retail, is if they did a reboot (to classic), and added new content through expansions in the theme of classic and not in path they followed previously. But i doubt they could do this without fucking it up (and even then who knows if people would even like it!)
---
Funny, I always see channel 4 spammed with LF2M &lt;insert instance here&gt;; Tanks and Heals needed.
---
Talk to the tank about target icons and try to get them to use them.  Then politely explain to the group the meaning of target icons.  "This one is first, this one is second, this one is third, this means sheep, this means shackle..."  etc...  
---
Then politely explain to them that you heal in the exact same order, meaning if you're taking damage, and the mob beating your ass isn't the one you should be targeting, then you're not going to waste mana correcting that deficit.
---
As a tank, I'd fucking love you if you did that.  Hell, if I had a guild group acting like assholes and a PUG healer who did that, I'd correct anyone who bitched about it.
---
Some people are just asshats ... pay them no attention.  As a DPS/Healer you go at the tanks speed, you can certainly ask the tank to speed up but no you're not at fault.
---
I also embrace this philosophy. I've seen 6 BoE purples so far. Won 3 of them. So it seems to be paying off in my case!
---
Hitting 2.4k rating with my friend as holy pala and affli warlock in 2v2 arenas in wotlk. We celebrated in bars for days!
---
Lose out on a lot of threat from righteousness and do less damage
---
if your only motivation to hit 50 is like..the class quests...idk what to tell you lmao this might not be your jam
---
not enough shards loser
---
C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
---
Trying to hop over the mountains of burning steps amd thats where I ended up at
---
Well thanks for the help then! Cheers
---
Probably a druid.
---
Any combination of stats that make sense are wanted. Some replies saying casters want int and stam, but actually some like my warlock want stam and spirit. Stam for additional life tapping and spirit for health and mana regen. The only really unnecessary ones I think are like agility/strength + int or odd melee/caster combos.
---
I've found weapons hard to judge. I've found bows and melee weapons I thought were decent that wouldn't move. Some success with wands. I usually vendor or disenchant a lot of weapons prior to the ubers level 55+ stuff. Unless they are obvious ones like +healing/frost/shadow staffs for example.
---
ah ok that clears it u, thanks
---
Easy ; im not at home in 19 during the time when most of guilds raid; i cant raid during weekend cuz i have social responosilities to my partner which i neglect because of university and work; id need to give up either other hobbies or seomthing else; i play usually during nights or around noon
---
This refers to counteracting the resistance stat. I dont know how it works, but you should treat it like Armor but for spells.
---
It's never wrong to leave a group if you aren't enjoying yourself.
---
It's a game, not a job.
---
the thing is for a rational and logical person this is known, therefore no suprise. you just calculate the aspect in that some people get butthurt how you are (or how you are not). i never really bothered with those kind of people and just ignore them. 
---
the worse part is if they can´t let lose and just keep pumping their irrational thoughts into you cause they think they either need to convince you that they are right or they are just ignorant that other people have other opinions. 
---
neither the less its just the minority of people ..
---
Assassin and combat hybrid is nice
---
I usually have a lot of them following me
---
Had a similar situation when I got my UBRS key, except they were opposite faction.
---
You usually double click on the server name
---
I wouldnt leave. Instead, I would just ask to kick the mage. He is still going to rage at you, however, if the rest of the group is fine, why waste your and the other 3 people's time? DPS have almost no pull in this game since they are nearly instantly replaceable--hell, you can even throw in an extra healer or tank if you cant find another DPS and it wont hurt anything.
---
Hmm, I somewhat disagree with removing this (at this time) because it had started an interesting and useful conversation that I wanted to see continue.
---
I leveled as disc until level 44...two months ago.
---
Doesn't help for Hunters feign death trap is broke
---
As long as you got ok gear and the other players are below you in lvl you should be fine. Key is pacing so take it slow and you’re fine
---
*Laughs in Lizardman*
---
Slam is not at all worth using solo or with a fast weapon, though.
---
The try hard min max community understands what is going to happen. You are in your own little world complaining about them on reddit but you need to understand that with out battlegrounds or objectives in phase 2 the level 60 epic geared try hards are going to farm level 48 players behind the curve for honor
---
This is unhealthy for the game bc it will most likely lead to ppl quitting the game. Hopefully you can see this
---
Why couldn't he have/display 99,999g 99s 99c in some weird bug? It's under the max. Not that relevant of a number, but pretty bold of you to claim he's lying. Some other dude claimed he was 1-shotting dudes in dunegeons randomly in this thread and everybody jumped onboard that one
---
Go into questie options map &amp; minimap, untick "glow"
---
You'll thank me later
---
In my groups, if someone pisses off the tank I find someone who doesn’t.
---
I'm starting to believe people photoshop/video edit it. It can't happen because my subjective circumstances deem it to be true! :P
---
Warrior isnt "bad" its just pretty boring compared to druid
---
I also know that I'm wrong and am clamouring for attention?
---
You can tank no problem with the gear you have. Druids are ultra tanky with dire bear. If you go to heal with feral spec and no healing hear your going to go oom immediately. Also you never want to heal dungeons as druid unless there is another person in the group that can rez. A 30min battle rez is not enough for dungeons. 
---
Have to add that the higher level you get it becomes less viable to heal as feral spec even if you have healer gear.
---
Playable New Scourge faction led by Sylvanas.
---
It generates a finite amount of threat and it does not force the boss to target you for any period of time. A true taunt can generate infinite amounts of threat and forces the boss to target you for a period of time. 
---
I’ll paste my comment from above regarding what this does/does not do for paladins.
---
Y'all must be coming up against shit hunters. No rogue has killed me on the way up to 45. No rogue will either.
---
that´s what true heros do
---
did you roll a keyboard warrior, as your first class in classic wow? also is your nickname IRL muscles? god you're confrontational dingle berry.
---
Ahh I got the line wrong
---
*What the hell are you singing?
---
No. The hunter trinket and the druid healing chest are both really good. You keep the hunter trinket to cycle through, and the druid healing chest is definitely good enough to raid in, even if you don't replace it for a while.
---
I think ST quests should be added next patch too, fyi.
---
I met a guy the other day who's only goal in the game is to complete every 5 man dungeon  quest in the game then quit. He kept going on about how he skipped a bunch back in the day and how he's happy to finally have the chance to officially complete quests. He was in our strath UD run not for any gear, gold, drops or anything of the likes. He merely wanted to complete some quest to "be done with stratholme" despite the fact that he could've gotten upgrades from gear in there he just wanted that damn quest done forever. 
---
There are definitely many many types of players.
---
I suggest you download lightshot for screenshots, nice and easy.
---
Best memory is being 16 years again and having that feeling of a big digital world to explore. We didnt had spoilers from youtube, wowhead, mmo champion or reddit: everything that our eyes caught was new and surprising. the flightpaths where amazing, you could see the world from above, the dungeons with all its backstory and new scary mobs and tactics, not knowing what gear dropped..everything was fresh and new. friends would tell you about events or bosses and when you finally get to experience them yourself you fell in love with the beauty the game had to offer...just a tru RPG experience and im happy i got to do it with friends and guildies
---
Considering the low drop rate of Dal rends and the number of other people who are going to roll against you for it unless you form a group to reserve it, I would buy krol blade if you have the gold. It’s a huge upgrade. Mirahs song is easy to get if you can find a group for scholo and it’s just as good as the Dal rend OH without the set bonus. 
---
Reference: I am a 60 rogue, who bought krol blade for 275g :)
---
No wrong way to learn the game, Relax and carry on :)
---
Getting a legitimate last man standing achievement and breaking 2k 5v5 rating in season 7 of arena on the same win. Was down to just me and two of them, secured the win and vent went wild. Nothing better before or since.
---
Do you have the addon Necrosis? It will tell you when they have high resists or are immune to banish.
---
Lmao if you waist time killing the pet then you die unless your ganking low levels.
---
I had a Hunter randomly kick a warrior for being the wrong spec.  I was doing 40 percent of the dps and 2h tanking.  Healer and I said that was not cool so we left and ended up forming a new group with the warrior.  That Hunter was also pulling mobs instead of letting me do it warlock was life tapping and healer had to drink for both of them.  For our new group I bought 55 mage water for the healer and we had a smooth run.  Like two hours later I got an invite from that same Hunter and figured I may as well block him.  He tried saying that he told the warrior to Respec lol and that warrior was arms just like me not that I'd ever tell someone to Respec in a 5 man.  Later last night I had an amazing group with a warlock banishing hard hitting mobs and an amazing group overall. The thing I love most about banish is that it won't break from me cleaving into the mob.
---
Advertise in trade/lfg for 10 seconds and you will find a group, lol. You are a tank.
---
My thoughts are that the people who mocked you are idiots.
---
5 days is not a few hours.
---
Horde just got all the casuals who could see how heavy the horde would be population wise. On top of the fortnite kids being drawn to horde this time too. In general most horde players are awful this time around. I finally met a hunter a couple days ago that knew how to play their class without disengage. Sure he had MC gear and I dont but he still played very well. Cant wait to be geared up for good fights.
---
Is the vanish and the hit going in the same batch?
---
What addons do you recommend specifically for healers, and why?
---
almost as annoying as this the sprint animation is bugged and flickers if you cast or someone in your group close to you casts
---
On Benediction, seems pretty balanced.
---
The trinkets are 13 14 and you count backwards from there.
---
They don’t have the same spawn rate.
---
Thanks! What about the bleed type dots that melee can inflict?
---
Or short dudes.
---
R...T?
---
Just because someone has free time it does not neccessarily mean they are unemployed. I have a lot of free time for 6 months, have a job, full salary and earning way more than the national avg or city avg. And avg is usually inflated by high salaries so I earn more than way more than 50% of population here. 
---
You kust have to study, work hard in the first years and get lucky with promotions and positions.
---
? no
---
Suffer not the opinion of pugs.  In this case it's actually those guys being greedy, wanting you to pass on an item you would use so they can vendor it.
---
If it's for off spec, pass to main spec first, otherwise you're good.
---
You don't like the glow? - I thought it was interesting because it "Groups" the quests if you will.
---
theres no self use for it? like enchanting your own gear? I care about helping my own character and making money is just a bonus
---
I agree wholeheartedly. In currently 31 and 35 with My highest characters. T 0,5 feels like the most unterestung content for me. I would Love forit to be there when I reach 60. 
---
It feels a lot more interesting as an additional gearing option rather than achivement-like addon in the end of classic.
---
"free time" doesn't just mean "time i'm not doing things I don't want to do". 
---
Maybe working out regularly takes a lot of gaming time away, maybe he has a girlfriend who he likes to set time aside to be with, maybe he has children who he knows take a lot of his time.
---
I don't tank because of the expectations you laid down. You gotta know the route, how to pull which mobs, boss strats, gotta keep watching for pat, monitor dps and heals... You just have to do so much and no one (in a pug at least) is paying enough attention to listen. I think I would enjoy tanking if I didn't have to deal with all that stuff.
---
It does matter when considering the weight of the talent though. If spell hit is determined first, it would be significantly more valuable than resistance reduction.
---
Isnt blanchy the horse in Westfall?
---
* Heals—yes, but remember healing is worth 0.5 threat per point.
---
* Buffs—yes, all holy spells.
---
* taunt—see the plethora of other comments for an explanation of why this mechanic is laughable as a taunt replacement. 
---
* greater blessings—more targets buffed translates to more threat per GCD. Mana efficiency is also a primary motivator.
---
&gt;I’ve read a lot of stuff that said Krol blade is barely any better than Thrash blade, so I just saved the gold for my epic mount. Not sure how true that is but I have yet to see any kind of parse data comparing the two.
---

---
[Sword of Zeal](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6622) 288  AEP
---
[Krol Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2244) 283 AEP
---
[Thrash Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17705) 245 AEP
---
To give additional info the Brutality Blade is given a rating of 333 AEP.  The difference between the Sword of Zeal and the Brutality Blade is 45 AEP.  The difference between the Thrash Blade and the Krol Blade is 38 AEP.
---
Going from the Thrash Blade to the Krol Blade is a huge upgrade - almost as big as going from the Sword of Zeal or Krol Blade to the Brutality Blade.
---
AEP: Agility Equivalence Points. A method to convert the value of item attributes to compare them in terms of Agility points. Based on the forum discussion by Ming from Lightning's Blade.
---
I mean... with how much threat is generated..... you'd be able to catch back up in like 2 casts lol
---
Oh I got killed by Horde 10 times last night - and of course only level 60s attacking someone 7 levels lower.
---
NTA. If mage wants to tank and tell tank how to tank, thy need to roll tank!
---
It's rough, but it can be done depending on the mob types and all. Did this a lot with the ST trolls, and requires a lot of stance dancing.. Defensive disarm, berserker rage, whirlwind, and pummel, and battle stance w/ cleave &amp; sweeping strikes (I also use the ravager if I plan on fighting more than 1 mob at a time). If done correctly, your cleave/sweep will hit two targets two times each in quick succession, usually you'll have enough rage between that and berserker rage to do it again immediately after, for another 2 hits each, which those can usually be finished off with the whirlwind or a ravager proc if they're not already dead, then the remaining two can be focused down individually with executes in between.
---
Sorry only speak english and spanish.
---
I know it’s not the best answer but : did you try to tinker with the retail version and see which part of the code allow this feature ? If your need help just ask me I could help you out when I have the time.
---
Ok, that will protect you. lol
---
I got lucky and picked up both at 20g a pop the other night. It was pretty late, and I made it easy by just afking outside the portal waiting for him to tell me to loot the chest.
---
idc about investing in it, I mainly would want it to help my own toons and if I can pick up rare recipes it would be a bonus, just feeling a bit weird sitting with tailoring/a second herbalist
---
The warlock dotted me :3
---
definitely not your specs, wow runs on my windows tablet that doesn't have a graphics card.
---
Try an SSD, they are wonderful
---
I literally stopped playing my War because every group was so toxic to me because i was a beginner. We weren't wiping we just weren't fast. Lame people.
---
Just say 'mind if I need for OS" and 99% of the time people are cool with it.
---
I had a 3/5 guild run of Scholo where the tank "needed" like 6 different items that weren't MS upgrades, we didn't say anything to him but in guild chat we were wondering if he was just taking them because he could.
---
If it's a BiS piece then definitely tell the group ahead of time that you want to roll on it.
---
As much as it sucks spending money to do the farm I recommend just using a limited invulnerability potion immediately following ice block. They aren’t super expensive and they make the farm reliable. After I kill the boss I then go do lashers in East so I don’t get locked out after an hour or have to wait.
---
Skeram is like 6:1 in favor of the horde (no joke...) and Herod is just a shitshow being one of the top 2 biggest servers.
---
a mage in ZF wanting to go faster is honestly pretty common they aoe farm that place and have zero respect for aggro.
---
Keep in mind that healing is worth 0.5 threat/point overhealing is worth 0 threat/point.
---
When WoW first came out I was 14. I was able to no life in high school with my friends. As a result, we saw through BWL/AQ20 (never was able to do Naxx/AQ40). Did serious PvP and was able to hit rank 11 and rank 12 on two seperate characters. Honestly, I'm surprised I did get overweight from the lack of exercise.
---
Now, I'm 31. I got married, work full time, starting a business, and looking to start a family. I'm pretty lucky if I can fit an hour or two in most evenings. Usually it's 3-4 nights (including weekends) for about 1.5 hours. I *want* to see endgame again. I *want* to experience all of WoW's content. I *want* to get geared. But I can't. 
---
Even with all of those wants, I still agree that
---
&gt;If you can't dedicate evenings of WoW you don't DESERVE endgame!!!
---
It's how it is. Sometimes we have to realize that we aren't the young teens that we were back when WoW first dropped. That we can't dedicate the same amount of time to the game anymore. 
---
That's okay. We're the casuals now. If you can't dedicate the time, then you don't deserve the loot. It's as simple as that.
---
8 def is -0.32 hit, -0.32 crit, 0.32 dodge, 0.32 parry, 0.32 block. Even taking block as being full avoidance, that's only 1.6% avoidance. 
---
And not speccing into Reck is imo a mistake (especially for aoefarming, where forceproccing it greatly adds to sustain), but I can concede that opinions differ on that one for raid tanking.
---
My warrior alt is only 14 ATM but I'm gonna try DW with hs cancelling to try it out for sure.
---
&gt;2-4 same levels at a time
---
Idk maybe I'm playing wrong, but I'm definitely not managing 2-4 mobs without problem lol. 2 mobs are fine (as long as the feared mob doesn't pull more mobs), 3 mobs are possible but I'll definitely have to pause *if* I survive
---
I agree with the rest though
---
There a tons of events to choose from. 
---
Our first Ragnaros kill, AQ40 twin emperors after weeks of struggling, dropping a divine intervention on a poor paladin in front of thrall after stripping him (banking the items), removing his hearthstone, and logging him out, only to wait for him to log on later and react...
---
But by far the most impacting sentiment I feel is easily the relationships made along the way through playing. Some of the best people I could have ever met, all through an online game, where at the time this type of contact was initially viewed as somewhat taboo. It changed the landscape of online gaming.
---
Nerds trying to get rank 13 aren’t the VAST majority of people. Most people aren’t going to be “grinding honor” and are going to experience world pvp completely different than you described. 
---
I played vanilla and besides the occasional city raids, Tauren mill, and raid night battles, the majority of world pvp isn’t going to be 3 raids full of people spamming sapper charges. 
---
If I’m wrong about the future, I’ll admit it. But don’t tell me how it was back in vanilla because I know how it was and it wasn’t what the dude I was replying to described. 
---
Will the streamer server be like that? Maybe. But if that shit ever happens on my server I will be very surprised.
---
Holy shit that is not ok. 6:1? Fuck that. Aight thanks man.
---
I didn't know it did that, but it's not really a functionality that'd do anything for me anyway
---
Just luck. Tons of people kill those mobs over and over trying to farm HoJ and never see one, let alone two.
---
No, this is not the case. A buff generates the same threat on a target without the buff as a target already buffed.
---
Thank you for the validation. I had spent like 3-4 days doing BRD exp runs with these people. I didn't need the exp, only the arena, but I thought i'd be more group-oriented as the rest of the party members seeemed to need it more. So when these same people came out with their defamations for me needing on a weapon (because tanks don't use 2handers) I was infuriated.
---
They are stupid.
---
You'd have to kill me a first time to get a chance to camp me
---
My experience has been less than 10% of my runs even having the Drakestone dropping from the 4 drakes.
---
So his 79 across 2000 kills (since he's farming 2) puts it at about 4% drop chance.
---
I tried it the other day on a shaman and we kept getting rocked by the Sacrifice guy. Every time he would back to back inflict pain sacrifice me as the healer. 
---
It was pure rng cause he can sacrifice the totems,  but it happened three tried in a row and we gave up knowing the RNG just hated us that day.
---
Out of curiosity - what do people fail on Rag? For me the fight is one of the easiest as everything is set before the pull and then you just stand still on your position and press 2 buttons. And melee just rect to one dude yelling on discord to move away.   
---
For me personaly the 'hardest' bosses for pugs are where there is a lot of shit going on and people panic and dont know what to do. That's why Garr is such example for me - healers are often dispeling  the slow for no reason getting oom, banished adds going lose and warlocks no reacting, people attacking random targets making the adds raid across the raid ect.
---
Ranged tanking Illidan as a shadowpriest while the warlock tank attempted to get back online during BC.
---
Tanks are special LOL.    
---
You want a tank for your dungeon run? Then I am rolling on DPS gear and tank gear. Don't like it? Find another tank?  
---
Its completely ridiculous to expect me to tank dungeons and not roll on my main spec dps gear. Its also ridiculous to expect me to tank dungeons and not roll on tank gear. So too bad, so sad, you expect warriors to tank, so warriors who tanks get to roll on both.
---
I'm so confused how this has happened. I'm a Tauren and have checked Bloodhoof, TB and Orgrimmar to no avail. On top of that Kranal Fiss got nothing for me. The only totem in my bags is my earth totem. I can check Razor Hill, but why should it be accessible there but not in Mulgore which is my starting zone?
---
I'm pretty certain I've never even picked it up, let alone abandoned it. I feels like it could be time to ask blizzard if i'm dumb or if there's really a bug and i'm one of few to encounter it (which seems unlikely though).
---
&gt;some of the loot from these bosses is absolutely crazy
---
Yeah, 3 extra slots with spellhit. Warlocks might even become viable as DDs with that.
---
If a group isn't up to snuff, threaten to find another. Remember: They need you more than you need them.
---
A warriors life is a rough journey. The payoff is being the king of endgame. 
---
You put in the work, you reap the rewards!
---
Yes.  But, statistically, it will happen to somebody.  Lucky you.
---
Sure there is, expand the talent system, remove forging, and legendary items, get rid of things like azurerite, make professions be something more unique, give class identity, scrap loot distro, get rid of lfg, keep mythic difficulty. Wow it'd be a lot to fix lol
---
I logged on retail last night,  Thought it would be a good idea to take a high level char through BRD to learn the layout.
---
I had no idea how to play that game anymore. Didn't recognise most the characters in the cinematics, felt more like a live action cartoon.
---
so Ring 2 is 12 and ring 1 is 11?
---
I mean knowledge is not a bad thing. However fun outweights everything. Guides never recommend Fury for Warrior as leveling since you hamstring kite with 2h weapon way more efficiant. however me as a warrior noob i just wanted to go ham with 2x 1h weapons and i sticked to it. never regreted that i had a harder time since i did what i liked. i do not follow leveling guides or watch how fast i level. don´t have xp/h or anything like that. even hiding your xp bar improves leveling cause you don´t think about the lvl up anymore. just play the game and do stuff you like. explore, hunt, gather, raid, talk, pvp .. i spend an evening 3h just pvp fighting over a farming spot which didn´t bring anything. no gold, no xp.. just fun. 
---
games are always about fun and everyone who argues against that or talks you into doing stuff you don´t like to do, ignore that person. 
---
there is a point in time (endgame raiding) where i would recommend you to look up guides for your class. but only if you think you lack something based on your opinion. 
---
min max is really really only important in a few minor aspects of the game. 
---
i´m a tauren fury warrior (min max would be orc, cause of the racial). i just like being big and bulky .. people who give me shit for that /ignore and done. 
---
now, i personally have the issue that i love respeccing and trying different stuff which can get quite expensive over time especially at early levels.
---
This is a problem with most random number generators.  Computers aren't random. They can't random. They have no concept of what random means. So programmers do their best to create systems that are pseudo-random but it never works. Video Games RNG's are notoriously bad at it. 
---
They have a tenancy to give long stings of the same result, even if they are programmed to be random...
---
I remember Dota II had a few patches to try and deal with this a few years back. They actually had to add weights to their proc chances because players would get 15+ crits in a row when they were supposed to have a 25% chance, or go hundreds of attacks without getting a single crit.  I think they put in a system where a crit lowers the chance of subsequent crits, and a white-hit raises the chance of a crit. It was a very clumsy kludge because their base random system just wasn't very random.
---
I don't think this is a bug so much as computer generated random acting like it always does... which is not very random.
---
If you needed it and nobody else did, you didnt do anything wrong IMO.  Most maces from dungeons you'll replace with something like [Barbarous Blade](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18520/barbarous-blade) or [Bonecrusher](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18420/bonecrusher) but if you havent seen those drop or havent done the quests, then dont let them dissuade you from rolling on stuff you need.  Just because there is better gear in the game, doesnt mean you've been lucky enough to see it.
---
Exactly. 40ms isn’t a material difference anyway, at least not in wow.
---
Mocking Blow can be parried or dodged.
---
You wont lose aggro, you have a crazy amount built up.
---
Laughs in Free Action Potion...
---
Healcomm (shows healing prediction from casts, requires other healers to have it for it to work properly across a raid to minimize overhealing). I use mouseover macros but some prefer clique (effectively does the same thing). If you play a healer with a hot - Aptechka raid frames is very good as it shows a bar that ticks down on the raid frame reflecting hot duration (only hots that your class can apply), but default raid frames aren’t too bad.
---
Likely good money too.
---
Yup. If I was tanking and a fury war rolled on a shied without mentioning being after tank-loot, i would be a little tilted. Same thing here.
---
The best way to sum up the problem with this mentality is that while you think you are being an efficient game player by doing this, saving time and cutting to the chase, the adage:
---
"Be efficient with things and effective with people"
---
Pays dividends.  
---
Be efficient with your gameplay.  Level efficiently, gear efficiently, run dungeons efficiently.  But don't sacrifice your social effectiveness.  
---
Since classic, especially, is a social game requiring grouping occasionally to get  your objectives accomplished, even minor digital politeness goes a long way.  It may take a little extra time and not be as "efficient" as the alternative, but longer term it builds the community as a whole.
---
why did you send me a child box, are you a paedo?
---
I swapped at 57 to prot to do BRD for the last 3 levels pretty much. I would say everything below BRD is definitely doable, and the beginning of BRD isn't bad. towards the end though stuff can start hitting really hard and i'd recommend being prot. With that said there's a lot more groups in the 50-60's then there tends to be while leveling and you should be able to find a solid group for most dungeons even staying DPS. I'd only swap to prot once you're sure you don't want to quest for awhile....because questing as prot is not fun.
---
I would probably stay arms till 60 and you can still do dungeons as DPS. Fury is kind of meh in its own right until you start picking up hit/crit gear. I posted in another thread recently about the whole "rolling on fury while you're prot specced" debate. As long as you say you're doing it from the beginning then the DPS have no right to complain when you do. If they have a problem they can go find another group. 
---
I was basically forced into tanking my entire leveling experience, my main spec was always going to be DPS. Even now i'm prot and have a decent tanking set but I only tanked to make it easier to get into groups, If other tanks are going to charge a "fee" or "reservation" to tank high level dungeons I feel like rolling on DPS gear is a pretty decent tradeoff.
---
Ashkandi represent!
---
Ooh shit, can’t Unsee now
---
My friend got stuck unable to rez and the GM ported him to durotar. Idk if that's the default though.
---
Or leaving the hunter to deal with rando mobs without their pet.
---
Is there anywhere to fish that's a more protected area in Azshara? Want to fish there without dying to pats every 30s (I'm under lvl 40)
---
Herod or Heartseeker
---
"GUYS, WHAT ABOUT ME?"
---
Skeram and Herod are very horde favored servers
---
Thank you for your effort in answering me. I'm guessing that resistance is determined last after the rolls for hit and crit are done?
---
Cute that a rogue thinks he'll kill a hunter, let alone one that gets a hunter's mark on him ahead of time. That's not even a fight, that's just a slaughter.
---
I watched this whole video and the part where this should have mattered (phase 3) he wasn't able to gain any real threat.  To the point he didn't even show up on the threat meter.  Am I missing something?
---
I get that. Especially online behind a fantasy persona I can let lose more
---
Even working shit min wage jobs $15/month is nothing.
---
Rogue's poison procs have a cast animation.
---
How the hell has this person not turned off their error speech yet?
---
What addon tells you the drop and rate there?
---
Also, it may be another addon interfering, have you tried disabling everything but AL?
---
Very rare wands are worth AH'ing, there are 2 farmable dun wands for DPS casters.
---
Raid v Raid pvp is in no way fun at all. It's really for the people who value feeling good over playing good. There's too much cheese and individual skill hardly matters.
---
i peg you as a depressed 24-37 yr old. who spends his time "trying" to troll people on reddit. and when not doing that, masturbating in a dimly lit room to anime. probably a student, and or unemployed. you have yet to prove otherwise. tbh
---
Talent trees
---
&gt;4 piece rogue set is better than T2. Hell even arguments for naxx.
---
Straight up fake news.
---
The first time I oneshot a clothie with an ambush crit, good times.
---
1. remove titanforge
---
2. back to normal / heroic raiding. remove mythic. heroic should be hard enough to cater for those seeking hardest difficulty. normal should be the introduction and discovery of raids. heroic should be current heroic difficulty raising to very hard difficulty for end bosses.
---
3. make raid gear fucking meaningfull and great and best for pve.
---
4. make pvp gear the best for pvp
---
5. bring back fun trinkets (think ICC)
---
6. remove the pruning of abilities. bring back our lost class abilities.
---
7. give classes identity, bring back paper/stone/scissor, no more my class is best and counter everything.
---
8. drastically reduce the complexity. we should not need an external site to work out if a piece of gear is an upgrade. azerite + essence + stats + benthic effects = too much complexity
---
9. bring back old stats: armor penetration, magic vulneratibility, pvp resilience
---
10. make primarity stats THE best stats for your class.
---
11. remove lfr, it is useless. 
---
12. make being in a guild matter. bonuses etc.
---
13. bring back gold timers for running instances to get cosmetic gear. ilvl max set to run thus allowing people interested in this to min max to their heart content to break timers.
---
14. bring back bis gear and class sets.
---
15. bring back steady raid nerfs that do not required everyone to farm like made men for a neck azerite...
---
16. make anything that require long farming, such as essence, be account bound to allow for playing alts.
---
17. bring a gear incentive to run mythic+ that does not include getting titanforging gear. may be currency to farm to buy specific vendor gear that is best for mythic+.
---
18. make profession have fun, useful gear that can be used and abused in raids, pvp and instances. yes, dont care if these items are broken. vanilla had broken items, it was still fun.
---
Sorry for the long list.
---
In baseball, they call it a perfect game.
---
In WoW, my perfect game came in a random match of Warsong Gulch.
---
As we zoned in, I noticed a rogue named Sazer. He waved at me, and I just had the gut instinct that I should follow him around.
---
The gates opened, and it became immediately clear that Sazer was a good player. He sliced through the enemy team like they were paper.
---
I healed for my life, keeping Sazer alive as I was being beaten on by rogues and shot by hunters.
---
But every spell I cast was perfect. Every heal hit a split second before counterspells. Every fear giving me just enough time to heal myself and Sazer up.
---
We both got close to dying so many times. But through a combination of luck and strong gameplay, we both survived the match without any deaths.
---
Sazer ended up with something insane like 45 kills.
---
We'd both go on to get multiple gladiator titles in BC. But this random battleground experience in classic remains my favorite memory. God I love pvp.
---
You only take onslaught girdle from DPS if they are doing 1200+ dps and you need everything you possibly can to hold aggro. Even then, pretty scummy move, there is almost always another way to boost your threat.  
---
Brutality Blade is trash, you dont want that.
---
Came here to link that
---
40-48 was a grind. The game picks up reasonably after that due to zones and quests. The 50s have been a breeze for me compared to the early 40s.
---
After the beating I've taken for the screenshot, I'll def be looking into alternatives, haha
---
15 agil is a tiny but worse than crusader but not out yet so....
---
Here's my take on it.  The tank should be able to dictate the pace, but I have been in some obscenely slow runs where every single pull happened after full hp full mana + like 5-10s. It's extremely unnecessary. If people can tag patrolling mobs to speed up runs, it's not some crazy request for you to slap it with a sunder as it runs by so that you don't have to wait 30-45s more to pull it.  DPS shouldn't be opening up on large packs as it's much easier to aoe tank it if you make the initial pull.
---
What does "pretend your playing seriously" mean? This is a video game people play for fun, not a job.
---
Combat swords is worse in pvp and than hemo or sf daggers, although its great for solo content, but definitely better than a lot of raid specs.
---
Well that's the issue. Once you get a big enough raid to mount up and run right into Sylvana's throne room or Thrall's house, you literally can't remove the opposing force because you can't attack effectively.
---
Once planted in there, its impossible to force the opposing raid out and defend the faction leaders.
---
Yah I'm looking forward to honor system. I enjoy actual pvp but skulls preventing you from questing is very lame.
---
It was a little after BC came out and I was playing my hunter and had no idea what I was really doing. I was running around Hellfire Peninsula and at some point got to the edge of the zone. I asked my guild what happened if you fell, and they either didn’t know or made some joke answers. So I jumped off and was able to report back with my findings: you died.
---
The ghouls in strat have stealth detection, vanish has never worked on them but it works fine on abominations &amp; skellies.
---
It would still only generate 45 TPS on each enemy in AoE scenarios. Not to mention, you can cast it only 12 times and you are completely out of mana. It’s just as terrible of an idea for AoE as it is for single target.
---
They could fix it, it would literally need an entire overhaul. I honestly hope they do a level squish, and allow you to skip certain expansions if you'd like. Will they probably not. Which sucks because I actually really enjoy the mythic raiding, but I absolutely hate how mind numblingly boring everything else is.
---
I had a mage do this in an Ulda run. At the part with the Troggs, near the back entrance. I start to pull going the right way, the mage pulls a pack clearing to the exit. They rage at me for not picking it up, I tell at them to stay with the tank and let me pull. They disagreed, so I bubble hearted. Probably could have just ran out in hindsight, bit this was funnier
---
If I was a tank I'd need on every single 2h that drops regardless of if you had one or not, we're talking 7g to a vendor here boys
---
I lucked out and got the rend bracers but I have only seen them once in my ridiculous quest to get the MH Dal’Rend
---
but i'm done piling on you, it's obviously you've only been at this "internet tough guy" for a few years. stay strong on that keyboard, muscles.
---
Releasing non-optional TBClassic before I've got Naxx on farm. On the other hand, if they make TBClassic optional (e.g. go through portal and your character migrates to a different server) then it would be fine.
---
I might check out retail again in the future, or I might not.
---
So it's a combo of the right modifiers on the right item slot - there's a reason 'of Shadow Wrath' on a pair of Bracers is worth MUCH more than if it was on a Offhand.
---
I remember the dalaran one, irrc it's like the 0,0,0 point of the EK
---
How long does it take the cost of respecing to degrade? 1 month? And does it degrade all the way?
---
That's the nature of rng. 
---
Sometimes you get 0 stitchings in a few runs, and sometimes it's 4 stotchings in just one run.
---
Think I got 10 of them in 12 runs or so.
---
I'd just like to say that i just hit 40 on my Priest, respecced to full shadow and bought my mount. I know i'm behind the curve in terms of levelling but i'm having a blast
---
For real. I have a 5 man group I run with and one of them said, "Let's save the princess for my quest". Bitch you're level 60 and don't need loot from that quest. The only reason I'm here is for the healing gloves from princess. We aren't saving her.

Sounds like you listen too much to Reddit.  Yea, warrior leveling isn't as good as some others, but you will always find a group.  Plus there are so many priests I wouldn't recommend playing one.
---
When my girlfriend, now wife, said she wanted to play with me.
---
This works in 40 mans as GBoK will be able to have 6 or 7 of one class to hit. In a dungeon it's useless as it'll hit 3 at most in UBRS.
---
My favorite memory is the progress and final conquest of Sunwell Plateau with my guild, in TBC. The degree of difficulty that SWP had was a real challenge and all of our guildies improved drastically in doing it. 
---
I still have fond memories of that period and the friends I made in those "hard" times :)
---
There’s an optimal level of optimalness

Indifference curves aren’t uniform so you can’ t just maximize utility in a general sense
---
Come to Sulfuras, really balanced and high pop EST PVP server.
---
This was obviously pre dire maul boys.. Settle down
---
Yeah you got me on that one lol
---
I mean, your complaint was with 1/4 of the other people, yet your reaction punished 4/4 of them.
---
Uh no that shit ain't standard. Warlock dm book is like 30g and waaaaay better. Eye of org is a god damn quest and way better. That dude was an idiot and that group was also full dumbass.
---
Totally agree. Plus those sets are great in pvp and would help out players that don't have the same time to set aside for raids.
---
This is what I tell mages if they start doing this (using blizzard for 3+ mob packs RIGHT AWAY). 
---
I *whisper* them first of all. Very important. People are weird about their egos in WoW because most people are undeveloped manchildren with fragile egos. I say:  
---
“Focus down the Skull first, then start with the AOE.”  
---
This helps TREMENDOUSLY and it is IMO the preferred way to dps down 3+ mob packs. The skull dies super fast, I get my rage and aggro on the other 2+ mobs, then the other 2+ mobs die quickly and simultaneously. It’s great.
---
My guild found an awesome strat with the fireballs where me as MT and our Offtank just stack on top of each other for the entirety of P2, and she will only cast fireballs on me or the offtank. This leads me to believe the threat drop only happens to the main target of the fireball as long as there are no other players in the AOE. It actually makes the fight a joke in P3 as there is no fighting for aggro, the boss comes right back to us.
---
Might've been on CD or may not even be frost spec.
---
You don’t even have to switch them back and forth. Casting the same one over and over will continue to generate threat. However, mana cost is the reason that this is bad.
---
I use gathermate and a castsequence macro bound to a mouse button to swap between the tracking types. Just have gathermate show both herb and mining nodes and swap between tracks as you approach potential nodes.
---
For zones whose nodes you haven't discovered, just run laps and switch tracking every 5 seconds or so.
---
Wouldnt mind winning a ticket :P
---
You're still getting XP during that "5 days".
---
Hahaha you don't just blindly give your tank warrior onslaught girdle unless he is actually bottle necked by threat.  
---
Even top guilds don't prio onslaught to the tank because there are many ways to get good threat that dont involve stealing the TOP fury DPS item.
---
A couple things here. Floating vs Integer is near zero impact on server in relation to other things that are being computed. Doesn’t mean your argument is invalid just found it a wierd thing to comment on. The tiebreaker scenario will actually occur more than 1% of the time given 5 independent random rolls between 1 and 100.
---
basically this.. if I have a tank that needs on fury items while I´m the fury in the group i would flip a bit and probably not run instances with him anymore. though i can understand it and is preferred over a hunter/mage rolling on my stuff
---
First time entering IF was breathtaking.
---
Threat from GBoK isn't registered on addons. I believe him not tanking p3 is intentional.
---
If you can't see it too well on your screen, I can screenshot it, print it out, then fax it over to your nearest Office Depot.
---
if they want to control the pace of the group and pull they should have rolled tank. They need to sit back and learn their place in the group, i leave np.  Always ez to find a group as a tank.
---
Slow and smooth is faster than wiping, running back, rebuffing, and slogging through potential respawns.
---
Do you know how I can copy text from wow chat ? Ie someone posts a link and I want to copy it
---
But that's really not a very good point, sorry.
---
Any mmorpg that does not have an endgame grind that is remotely worth your while is not a very good game. Any single additional attack power, stamina or crit% would be worth it if phase 1 had some actual competitive content, be it progress-raiding or PvP, I would have a "sink for all my hours".
---
Not that levelling alts is too bad, for now at least, but tye current endgame is not worth grinding gear and gets outright boring.
---
What if they change the raids so that the difficulty and ilvl of loot scales, based on lowest level or median level in the group. That way you can do any raid at any level, and it will kind of make sense. Quests should likewise scale in this way. Then WoW endgame gives you the choice of 50 raids your group can run, and 1000 quests you can do solo, all with reasonable rewards.
---
I wish things like this happened more often. I feel like city raids are one of the coolest things PVP-wise to do in WOW.
---
Wow you're salty that you got proven wrong.
---
Not talking pvp. Holy paladins are not easy to kill either. You are such a phony. Probably only lvl 40 something still
---
yeah fuck dailies
---
36 Anger Kills according to DBM and have yet to even see HoJ drop once... some luck haha
---
I frequently group with my girlfriend that's a healer so we can perfectly get a vibe of when a break is needed and pull rhythm. As soon as dps get out of line and carry on pulling stupid pulls we will leave or kick them. 
---
Don't be a dick or I'll be a dick really.
---
I was herb/alch, dropped herb.. found that it was definitely worth it. After a few days of frustration trying to learn how to do the trib run, now ive done it like 12 times no issues. The gold is great and as someone who enjoys solo content a lot more than group, these tribute runs are actually a ton of fun. You feel you get better every run. + fun to give guildies rings and sell tributes.
---
tbh this actually sounds like a good idea, makes more sense when you put it that way. Like this really changed my perspective lol, I guess I find enchanting just kinda cool/fun and I feel a bit weird with having two herbalists
---
There are much better pieces of gear for a tank to take than onslaught girdle.  
---
Frankly, if you aren't world buffed/full consumes/dual wielding in fury/prot and still having threat issues, you have 0 claim over onslaught girdle. Thats just how it is.  
---
Only in a very hardcore guild should the MT get onslaught.
---
Awesome information.  Makes a fight that seems very unpredictable much more manageable.
---
lol. Cheap Shot hunter, Backstab Backstab pet. vanish. BYEEEEEE. See you again in a few minutes
---
New healer here. In Dungeons, I usually don't utilize my mana outside of healing and DoTing with SP, then go back to wanding to conserve mana. Is this the correct approach or am I expected to use other spells? I don't like to necessarily use mana spells in case the group gets into trouble.
---
What is the correct approach as a healer in regards to how to utilize mana during a dungeon?
---
I'd recommend collecting blue pearls off the coast of STV (By Grom Gal). They sell for 20s on my server and if uncontested you can collect 8-10 per 15 minutes.
---
True.
---
Yeah I saw it, I wanted to know if it was 100% accurate or if it was speculative.
---
Wowhead isn’t always right.
---
Sorry just a quick reply. In the youtube comments OP says another tank holding p3 aggro is intentional.
---
Enchanting is kind of a pain having to farm recipes and such for it to be worthwhile. Only other use is on like a mage farming tons of mobs to disenchant greens and blues when it's worth it. I would keep herb on both characters so you can just funnel all herbs to your mage. Also Engineering is the best profession in the game in terms of actual combat so I plan on having it on every character I make. Especially if you're into PvP.
---
Ask for lead. Kick guilty party. Don’t punish everyone
---
How important is +defense? I am a 48 warrior tank, if I have the choice between +defense and +attackpower I would guess that +defense is more useful. However, I am still tanking with a 2H since I am clearing ZF at the moment, if I am not even using a shield yet then surely extra defense is not game changing? Would more attack based gear be better for extra rage and damage?
---
Others have already said why you should let the fury warriors get Girdle before you do (and I agree), but I'd like to add that you should get Accuria before they do (and before anyone else imo). "Hit is hard to find" is a lie regarding fury warriors. Truestrike+Lionheart+Blackstone+Satyr's Bow+Ony neck+Devilsaur+Battleborn Armbraces gets you overcapped easily. Accuria is nice but definitely not necessary.
---
For tanks, however, you really badly need the items that concentrate a lot of hit or crit into single pieces of gear. This is why Accuria, Savage Gladiator Chain and Lionheart are so good for tanks. They let you mix and match mitigation pieces with your strong threat pieces so that you can get the best of both worlds.
---
It was my first time in WoW and after reaching level 40 with a warrior...I think I am done with this game.
---
Also the droprates on wowhead etc are not “correct” as they are based on players using their addon. No one knows the true droprates ingame really.
---
I guess it just looks interesting/fun having yourself enchanted all the time but yeah it doesnt look like its that useful to even have on my own character
---
tanks don't care if dps dies really, dps has so many aggro dropping abilites for most classes that if anything but a spriest or a fury warrior dies it's 100% on them.
---
but healers can wipe groups by trying to cover for bad dps by blowing all thier mana healing them.
---
I regretfully swapped to AR. I thought it would be cool, leveled to 60 and decided to reroll on a more populated server. Transferred so all of our friends could play together but they all quit and I enjoy the more populated servers. I played vanilla on crushridge and that felt similar to AR. I haven’t played on AR since they opened the server transfers, I think it will fill out to a respectable population.
---
Best thing is to make the group yourself and remove people who do that if it is a big problem. When you join groups who are looking for a tank you open yourself up to that kind of treatment.
---
Roll on every good dps items, unless you are a maintank of a guild and don’t plan to reroll for a while for dps build.
---
Gotta make sure them heals don't miss.
---
Achievements I don't mind, but I can't stand the whole mount/pet collection minigame that WoW became. The main cities just started to look absurd at some point and just kept getting worse.
---
Dal Rends set is not worth getting as a hunter.
---
Nonsense, the rotation is  different for many scenarios. Adding to that he also named other aspects that in combination make hunter difficult and have the highest skill ceiling in the game.
---
Alright thanks :)
---
My favorite memory in WoW is coming back to classic. Running from Burning Steppes as an alliance warrior into Blackrock Mountain for the first time, just so I could go up and get the Thorium Point flightpath.
---
Just entering that mountain, seeing the chain hanging there and the dragons flying overhead. It was the moment I went "oh my god, I'm back, this is it". All the memories of vanilla raiding, all the times jumping into lava to go to MC, everything came flooding back. And to know I was going to be spending *a lot* of time in here in the coming weeks, though I was much too low to really be there at the time.
---
That mountain is powerful, it holds a lot of memories.
---
Qwerty is a warrior, but yes he is very nice :)
---
Certain add-ons will help with that. ElvUI, for example. There should be other chat add-ons that are less extensive than Elv, though.
---
More debuffs slots and the restoration druids/shamans feeding the oomkin mana through totems/innervate.
---
I'm not sure that's even a good comparison, the difference is that time-to-kill is now very very low, and buttons-per-second is much higher.
---
Dungeons are shorter, and with Mythic+, not necessarily simplistic, they are just boring because everything gets nuked and you're done in 15 minutes, ready to click to go again.
---
The first time i did ragefire back in vanilla. I didn't know what hearthstone did so I did use it right there. They laughed at me afterwards.
---
Teaching a guy how to swim back in Vanilla. He kept drowning! Didn't know how his mouse worked...
---
&gt; Hunter: Autoshot rotation
---
lol what?
---
That is pretty bad. Atlas has them at 10% from each dragon so I thought it would drop more often.
---
60 hpriest, mostly preraid bis. I wanna go shadow and not tell anyone. How bad will it affect my healing? Is it still viable for raids and strat scholo ubrs dm? Recommended talents?
---
I have True Strike, but I'm planning on using these for pvp for a long time.   10 to all stats is pretty strong.
---
&gt; Oh, it does. If they keep pulling and getting the initial agro on them instead of the tank, then they deserve to tank. A few deaths should teach them a lesson.
---
When a mage picks up a group, and you leave them to it, the mobs aggro onto the healer. Probably before they've killed the mage.
---
Bahahaha at least we share our fear of Locks. Those fuckers dot you up so fast, there is no reaction time to be had.
---
Can a macro call another macro? 
---
I have a few macros to equip sword/shield and then cast an ability like shield wall, block, etc.
---
But if I change gear I have to change each macro. Would be nice if I could have 1 single macro to equip, then other macros simply call that so is only have to change it in one place
---
Just play the majority faction on a high pop server with somewhat decent balance. A lot of people try to avoid playing on the bigger servers or on the dominant faction because they don't think they want that, but I promise you the game is much more enjoyable. I play Horde on Stalagg which is very Horde dominated but there are no queues now, the economy is massive, lots of guilds trying to fill rosters, lookingforgroup chat is constant spam, and there are still plenty of Alliance as far as world PVP goes.
---
If you are 20 and have consecration you will be fine. Drop yellow doom and make sure everyone focus targets your target.
---
was a blue moon
---
 RemindMe! 8 hours "TRY THIS"
---
Okay so like LFR where you just queue up and it plops you in raid. Yeah, I agree with that.
---
It's because people have the opposite mentality when it comes to time. 
---
Its like an old lady wondering why everyone is driving so fast. She can't understand that some people have shit to do while she's taking a 15mph joyride.
---
It would help if you told us what realm you are currently playing on?
---
As a druid it is hard not to wish to make new main be it warrior, rogue for Raid dps or Mage, Hunter for grinding of mats or even Priest, Paladin for easier healing. It is long way till phase 3 and tier2 sets and I have no idea how to farm gold or consumables on resto druid.
---
This guy taunts
---
But you CAN miss with your main hand, you just can't miss with YELLOW attacks.
---
Hah I'm on the list. Was wondering why someone just gave me a fish.
---
Other guy is crazy, AtlasLoot does show the drop rate of items the majority of the time.
---
What a terrible costume.
---
WARRIOR HARD!
---
3 BUTTONS TOO DIFFICULT!
---
ME GO BACK TO SMASHY
---
Jump on your servers discord, there was a post of all the discords within the last week.
---
Is 250 ping playable?
---
I respecced prot at 52 and only ran dungeons til 60. It’s very easy to find groups and you can already start working on your prebis. Not to mention the xp is great. IMO the best bang for your buck
---
Fair enough, but you’d think you’d wanna pace yourself after 2 wipes.
---
Poor Ol’ Blanchy!
---
I've not had too much of that yet - but I have only just turned level 30. Main ganking has come from me traveling to places (SFK as Alliance as an example).
---
REALLY want BGs, I remember them coming out on Vanilla and it was amazing.
---
I've been using Assassination Blade over Thrash and have been liking it. I just feel like Thrash doesn't proc enough for me to use it over the Assassination Blade.
---
I did combat daggers and personally found it difficult. A lot of damage being loaded onto Backstab/Ambush isn't good for solo play. I switched at level 40.
---
Subtlety would give you very good talents for doing farming/pickpocket runs though, so it could be a good gold farmer (There's a good BRD pickpocket guide out)
---
Can't imagine this mindset lol, 1-60 is so long I'd go crazy if I didn't like it
---
Not the same person but I'm reading this on my commute to work. Can't exactly play WoW on the train, lol.
---
Treat your VW as an off-tank. He can hold aggro and not die when fighting two or three mobs at a time. Succ will give you a better boost in DPS, but not a ton.
---
Also, the top-level pet grimoire will give you every level below it so save your cash!
---
Tanks are almost always instantly invited on Stalagg.  You can cherry pick when your e that in demand.
---
Everybody has a plan until they get their head blown off.
---
Nah fam. Focus me, I have to fight to get back into ranged. Focus Cleo (my kitty), I have open shots and you’re dead before she is.
---
When I was leveling, I would DoT the skull and heal as needed. If the tank was great at AoE threat, I'd DoT all targets and heal as needed. Wanding of course in my healing downtime.
---
Now I mostly just heal. Of course I'm a shadow priest, so my mana efficiency is crap. Out of habit sometimes I'll throw out a SWP.
---
I think if you want to do more damage that's fine. I'd just keep your mana over 50% in case shit hits the fan.
---
You were right to leave. Honestly if I were playing tank I'd make my own groups and fill up my friends list with the good healers / dps I group with. And kick people who ignore the dungeon etiquette, even after being asked politely not to
---
You're in-demand, people should "respect" you. I added quotes because I've seen some tanks really abuse their status.
---
Why don't you use ret aura? Wouldn't that help?
---
Nobody likes a braggart ;)
---
I’d say that 25-45 you’ll almost be preferred. Consecration AOE is too good for threat along with imp. RF. But then you’ll face a sharp drop off after mauradon time span and will be peer pressured to go holy lol. I played on a shitty horde dominated server before I transferred but ranked aoe farming 29-45 and it was far worth the time. Especially in the SM block, so much xp.
---
Raiding Karazhan, healing on my priest!
---
People are so fucking stupid. Instant gratification is the bane of our species.
---
Yes, it would.
---
I'm pretty sure they can. There are addons that will extend your macros/call other macros.
---
Completing my tier 2 hunter set in vanilla, such a good looking set.
---
Having a tuxedo dinner with me and my friends bank alts.  Felt like the aristocrats of stormwind.
---
Skarm is the man
---
I had everything on now and [this]https://i.imgur.com/v8IKAlc.png) happened.
---
Look up "spell batching"
---
It's an element blizzard introduced to classic, in what I think was an attempt to alleviate stress from their servers by taking a whole bunch of lone spells cast around the same time and combining them into one singular process.
---
Its created some wacky interactions that really fuck the game up.
---
It’s like real war.
---
Repeating it wont make it true
---
Yeah we were close got to 6% but didn't didnt have tanks with fire res so knock back messed melee dps as the ot's taunt kept resisting
---
That's almost certainly the case. I leveled from 30 to 60 in dungeons, and have done quite a few at 60, and the worst I've seen are groups that don't work well together and wipe like 4 times in scholomance.
---
Then I saw this post from a few weeks ago where a tank was like "And then they said that I was the worst tank they ever ran with", to which someone else said "Oh yeah, I've get told that all the time. Stupid bad dps."
---
It's like zero awareness.
---
*casts flare*
---
I'll do it for a nickel.
---
Get in the dead zone and spam insta-cast spells until he's dead. only real way to do it in my experience.
---
We don't have to do mathematical equations, because someone already did them. We already know the best variations of items to get. Doesn't matter if some cool shit drops, because you know, you can't wear it, because you need hit here, so you can get amazing pants without hit. The math is already done. Just don't pretend, that min-maxing is something new. Yes, community is relevant, but it was a way they dealt with dead servers. Something, that ll need to be dealt with again.
---
I’ll copy paste my answer from another post I did about DM:E 2-man with priest and warrior.
---
Full fury with full prebis but swapped out my devilsaur set for disarm-immune plate gloves from stratholme and the new crit plate legs from last boss in DM:W so i can get some more armor.
---
First boss is very simple tank and spank, have whirlwind ready when he hits 50% and spawns adds.
---
Second boss we use barovs peasant caller (in hopes that they will tank sacrificw)and shadow reflectors so we can lower our chances of getting sacrificed. Also if the fight is running long you can pop Thornling Seed from the pods that spawns in DM east. This can also tank a sacrifice.
---
Last boss is the trickiest. If you are undergeared you can clear trash and have the priest stand on the ledge and jump up and down to not take damage from the imps. But ideally you want to skip the 3 trashpacks so we jump down and kill him behind the pillar closest to the wall that breaks. When it breaks we rush in, because id you dont the imps will cause the trash packs to aggro you causing iminent wipe. I aoe taunt the imps and we each toss a Dense Dynamite on the imps. After that I nuke him down. 
---
One more tip I helped my priest friend get the trinket from Noxxion in Maraudon so he can dispell the poison from last boss if he manages to get a poison cast off on him when he is tossing a dynamite on the imps. If you use these tactics I think you will have a better time. Good luck!
---
not only that but heroic strike prevents you earning rage from what would have otherwise been a white attack
---
Dumb.
---
Lost Ironfoe to a rogue (as a Warrior)
---
The same rogue who passed on HoJ because he believed had Seal of the Dawn and Blackhand's Breadth were better.
---
At least i got HoJ, but damn...
---
Yes.  I launched on Incendius, got a paladin to 20 in spite of the queues, lost interest in sitting and staring at the countdown, rerolled on Mankrik for a low/no queue life and my original PvE Vanilla experience, got to 20 again but that was brutally boring - felt like work. 
---
Finally found my correct home on Grobbulus!  Love playing there, not even worrying about putting levels on, just having fun and being social. Loving it. I found my home.
---
I made a lot of cool memorys in Classis wow. Killed a guild leader warlock in 1v1 after he just snacked me while struggling against mobs. Grouping up with people to grind some dungeons hardcore. Learning all the aoe farm spots as mage, which get more and more difficult. 
---
My most notable memory from my wow time was in BC, where i started. By the time i approached level 70 WotLK was out and i started raiding with a retro raid. My first raids were so impressive. So many people tried to coordinate with each other and then fought each other after the boss fights for loot. The raids were not that easy, because there were a lot of raid mechanics, that could wipe you even with full 80 guys in the raid. And we were a lot of noobs there. I got quite addicted :)
---
I know I'm extremely fortunate in that I have a group of 3 friends, all from highschool, still intact, still without children (we're all without children). And to be honest, only one of us really wants kids anytime soon. The nice part for him is he LITERALLY met his to-be wife on WoW 8 years ago. Their wedding is in December. We are all very excited for them. 
---
We all have good educations, good jobs; for the most part we have balanced lifestyles. I know that most friend groups can't stick together for 15-20 years like we have, but so far it's worked out. We have very different social lives but WoW classic has brought us back together. 
---
I cringe pretty hard when I read stories about people our age who feel trapped in jobs they don't like, have horrible commutes, and then have to balance all of that with 2 or 3 kids. Alternatively, we cringe pretty hard that some of our guildmates are just life-long fuckups: they're chronically un/under employed, use drugs/alcohol and WoW as rampant escapism, and just have desperate lives. 
---
I also have some online friends who I've been gaming with for 15+ years. It seems meaningless to many, but some of these people have really pulled me through some of the worst periods of my life. OP, I'm glad you get to kep at least one friend, consistently, over the years to play video games with. Even if it's not every day, even if it's not consistent, even if there are months where you aren't playing together - for anyone reading this, cherish the friendships you have, and work hard to keep them. Having just one friend who you can game with, hell even having just one friend, is a treasure to be guarded.
---
If you have details they might be able to see your spec. Also Warcraft logs might dime you out.
---
I always just /w “[Thorium Lockbox]?” Easy enough
---
Moonglade is a high level zone that would be pretty safe. Won't be as good as Azshara though.
---
Most likely, yes. Same with priests farming the eye of shadow. It's almost always more time efficient to just farm gold and buy them.
---
? yes
---
I've got my own routes but most people go around the outside of Un'goro and then check Fire Plume Ridge as well.
---
I just try to change things up because I get bored often. Not a big grinder.
---
Happy to help
---
Eh you had a shitty experience, I was farming stone elementals in arathi and no horde touched me surprisingly (well all of them were there for the quests anyway). I even helped a smaller group with the stone giant and they thank emoted me lol. Heck, even a dual boxing troll mage came along, I thought I will be in for a very bad time but he left me alone and only killed mobs.
---
The other day I was farming the same, lower or equal levels left me alone (in 40-44 range) but there was a dick ?? mage who froze me and had me killed by his yeti pet. I admit that was very comical xD. (and at least he didn't gank me so it's something)
---
So yeah, sometimes it's awesome people and sometimes it's pure dicks but I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
Am druid tank. Between swipe spam and tab target mauling, I don't generally have problems with threat on multiple targets. Before 52 you rely more on Maul spam, after 52 infinite swipe with OoC procs.
---
Mark skull on first maul target, and hit other mobs with Maul on the 2 second swing timer. Maybe put up self hots and demo Roar for initial aggro. That's it.
---
Only Blizzard truly knows exact drop rates. Sites like wowhead depend on user submitted information for their sources and are subject to error.
---
On top of that the variance that comes with RNG can make it seem less than expected.
---
Used to play AV with my pal all the time. We'd go for the Graveyards first, and when all hope was lost, break out the fishing poles. Good times.
---
In vanilla, my first character was a paladin because I wanted to be a brute force fighter with magical powers.
---
There's a pretty well organized pug on Deviate Delight that I think has cleared everything except for Rag.  I'd expect them to get there soon.  The core of the pug is a fragment of a big raiding guild that broke up, and the two main guys are both tanks.  Makes it a lot easier to complete the content.
---
Make sure you have at least 11 relic coffer keys (I buy them off AH when they are 30s or less, i also spam a macro on my bank alt to buy them for 25s) Then you just stealth to the coffer room in BRD and open 11 of them. I combine it withe PP the mobs and solo 2 bosses on the way. Takes about 17 minutes to do all tthat and you make 12-15g a run depending on Loot RNG
---
That's just the reality of tanking I'm afraid, you are the first to act, so everyone has to follow your lead.
---
Good DPS and good healers can carry a weakly geared tank, but the tank still has to take the initiative.
---
For real? You like wow becuase you alrdy done it?  Only reason I'm playing is becuase this is all totally new to me. If I played back in the day I doubt I would come back but then again I am super pumped about the re release of command and conquer and that's 25 years lol
---
Neck gainz still on point
---
57 Rogue here.  
---
I don't really even bother much with looking at green drops anymore.  It's all vendor loot to me.  Got plenty of gold in the bank and 6 of my pre raid bis as of now.  The way I look at is:  if I'm 57 and going for bis, no other 57+ is gonna want this green junk.
---
Ones that ppl would actually want to equip. Frost or Shadow spell dmg is good.
---
At least some of them are slightly funny, this one is just cringy
---
Well, sharing what region and realm you're on could lead to people from your realm reaching out and you finding the type of guild you're looking for.
---
I personally play on Dreadmist - EU. While I'm not a 100% satisfied with my choice, it isn't too bad. The selection of raiding guilds is somewhat limited but that'll get better with time. I have a 60 and two characters 30+ so I'm definitely not gonna reroll on a different server.
---
Join your realm's discord if you haven't already. Even if you don't care for the community chatter, guilds recruit there, so you can keep tabs on that to see if a new guild that matches what you're looking for pops up.
---
Alternatively, since you're only level 31, you could look into switching realm if you're willing to re-do those levels. Personally, I'd go for it if i was 31 and not satisfied with my realm.
---
You get a rezz, but getting from Westfall to a boat might take a while.

Like I said, if the healer pulls agro, then I intervene. Although if mage is going all out on his damage meter, it's not normally an issue. They'd only agro on the healer once the mage is dead, in which case I intervene.
---
It's either teach the mage a lesson if he/she is not following instructions ... or I tell the group that either I quit or the mage gets booted.
---
Sound hardass? Sure. But as a tank, the whole weight of the instance is on my shoulders. This means I lead. Always. If someone else wishes to lead the pulls, then they can tank instead. I'm not going to get raging mad over a game.
---
Agree with everything but you missed the Assassination please as 252 AEP and a few hundred gold less than Krols.  Yes it's not as good, but its also stupidly cheap for its power and Def worth the investment imo
---
"I used your soul to create a healthstone that I used to kill one of your friends."
---
600 runs. Six hundred runs?
---
As far as I know it's a 3 percent chance per hit. So 2 crystals out of 3-4 hits isn't that crazy. I've yet to see it myself though.
---
They do its called leveling part. On serious note i think because rage as a resource is pretty busted since it scales with gear and how much damage you do
---
Play both warrior and priest and take advantage of extra rested XP while you level!
---
500g on kirtonos horde
---
And none of that random legendaries from early Legion. That was awful.
---
Don’t like the new talent system at All.  Make the game an rpg again and I might be interested.
---
Yes I played classic. No idea what part of my comment makes you think that but w.e.
---
As the other guy says both games have just as much of a BiS list. Classics is just clownier.
---
And idk why you're so obsessed with this reputation but that just shows that there are simply very little players. Only on a small scale would you know otherpeople.
---
1 month, 5g each month, down to a min of 10g
---
Of course it's just how it is. If you notice I wound up having a lot of fun. The "scum" and "fuck them" comments were just colorful commentary. I'm glad classic has experiences like this because retail let's you opt out of them far too easily.
---
And where decay doesnt factor in. I.e. rank 3
---
Back in vanilla I did the pally mount quest with another pally. We didnt realize that SFK was an instance. We were 40 so we went in 2 manning it all the way to the horses. It was an epic adventure for two people having no clue what they were doing.
---
I find if I log for a few hours and come back . It then turns into near 100% no joke
---
First time downing major domo after weeks of attempts
---
&gt; I love that playtime between raids is OPTIONAL. For once, I can play WoW and join my friends in other games or rl without feeling guilty about my neck/weapon AP level, or not getting that day's chunk of rep/peals/badges.
---
People hate it because it didn't have a ton of content, but that was the best part of pre-hfc WoD.
---
But a vast majority will be going for at least 11 for the mount.
---
Are you a Shaman?
---
U beat sl locks as a hunter?
---
Oh Eric, you can't see even two feet in front of yourself! I must imagine that you're under the age of twenty. Bless your heart.
---
DPS just need to tab target around and wait for the mob to have one or two sunders before attacking that mob.
---
What other caster gear is there?
---
&gt;  if you don't actually need it
---
You shouldn't phrase it this way in argument.  You should phrase it as "don't intend to equip and use it".
---
Everyone defines 'need' differently, and you'll only be butting your head against a wall of "Yeah, I NEED gold, pal".
---
Afaik, druids can solo maraudon princess. So i'd look into that (and rotgrip and the gnome as well while you're there) and/or DM Tribute runs with a rogue 2man and split the cash, dm east "jump runs" with 1-2 other person, especially a warrior would be looking for that.
---
You have plenty of options as a druid :)
---
Mooncloth bags are 16 slots, they can be bought from other players that have tailoring and are willing to make it. Mooncloth itself is on a 4 day timer so one bag requires just over two weeks for a single tailor to make. You could buy the cloth though and have it made. 
---
Onyxa hide backpack is usually auctioned off for gold, it's bop so you have to attend the raid to get a chance at it.
---
Being the noob my brother carried back in the day. Playing now and seeing how bad I truely was makes me miss him more everyday. May he RIP. &lt;3
---
I don’t blizzard till after. I just IB right before first dog hits me and wait for IB to expire while spamming the LIP followed immediately by nova while I’m dropping off ledge. Then I use full ranks blizzard from there. They act a little wonky at the corner so if they start to spread out too much I run back in and nova coc shatter them to death. LIP doesn’t prevent the bleed, but I’m at practically full health because of the LIP so it’s fine and it doesn’t seem to pushback my blizz.
---
Worst case scenario if some dogs resist nova, I try to kill as many as I can and reset on the ledge from this vid. Then I just do it again, but it’s easy if you killed half or so and I don’t need a LIP then.
---
I’m not sure what leads you not to believe that floating point carries a *significant* non-zero performance cost. The game servers are under constant, *heavy* load consisting almost entirely of floating point math. Any steps they can take to relieve pressure from their FPUs, such as using integers to back rolls, they will take.
---
You’re right, it is a weird thing to comment on. I only mention it because you are so insistent that floating point is being used here despite having zero evidence to back that up. Think of it as a way to say, “Even if the evidence I’ve just shown you is incorrect (as you have claimed), here’s another reason that your claim is unlikely to be true.”
---
It'd be 1/6 of 175, so  ~29 sp
---
I would be ok with the system retail has to sign up for a M+
---
I love the cleave sweep combo, but for me it doesn't always seem to do the double hit.  And always at the most inopportune time.
---
you're right, i should have.
---
For AoE the Whitemane's is gonna be better with that stamina unless you find yourself running out of mana on your pulls. If you need more max mana go with the extra intellect.
---
With this “some website” rhetoric you keep spewing — are you trying to say that these gloves aren’t BiS for mages?
---
Lol I play healer and I love rogues. You clearly are salty AF. Hope you get ganked again soon!
---
Tippity tine your ticket is mine
---
No, that doesn't really work, and the exp difference isn't that great between low leve mobs and high level mobs. XP gain also caps out based on your level.  
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob\_XP](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP)
---
Wrong, and wrong.
---
Tank weapons are better fast when you aren't hit capped (which is quite common in phase 1 due to limited gear options) missing your initial few hits is an insane threat handicap. This is why fast weapons are better. Not to mention on horde side, you don't get the sword hit bonus (most of the better weapons are swords, axes have very limited options), so the best weapons are daggers/fast swords/maybe BSH. Not every warrior is a human. 
---
And you shouldn't have any problems getting rage to HS.
---
Hunter rolled on and won HoJ. He claimed it was pre bis. I asked him to link a guide and it wasnt.
---
He gave felt bad and gave me 20g to make up for it. So i dont really have any ill will toward him.
---
But now im concerned about others doing the same.
---
My buddy IRL is a healer. It's wonderfully decadent that we get to basically decide what happens. 
---
A lock was being an asshat that he wasn't getting healed from Life-tap (This was mid fight where the healer was trying to keep up everyone else, and told the lock to drain life).
---
My friend got sick of his abuse (much profanity) and said he leaves or I leave. I quickly followed it with, if the healer leaves, I leave. That lock got the boot.
---
Again is it kind of greasy? Yes. But at the same time DPS need to understand that they are replaceable. And if the healer says:
---
&gt; Drain life, I'm too busy healing the tank and other DPS without self-heals to heal your self-inflicted life taps.
---
Maybe don't flame the ever living shit out of him?
---
I cannot wait to see the beloved game Diablo: Immortal to get some news. They egged us on last year and man how on earth can we resist this wait any longer. I cannot wait to play my favorite game, Diablo 3, on ANOTHER platform.  To think, from the convenience from your own cellphone.  /s
---
No. You were not wrong to leave.  I guarantee you that if you continued at the pace you were going, chat would have escalated and the DPS would have pulled half the dungeon and hearth out just to be vindictive.
---
Leaving a toxic group is never a bad idea.
---
That's fair.
---
Reddit doesn't like swipe because it "has low threat," and disregards the fact that it's actually pretty decent at keeping aggro, especially early on in the fight when rage is at an extremely high premium.
---
have you found any more silithus quests apart from the tortured sentinels quest?
---
It's not important until you're raiding, at which point you'll want tons of it to prevent being crit by a boss.
---
Ah, I wasn't aware. I've never rolled a druid and I dont usually just chill underwater
---
Because people that want to gank/pvp typically picks the race with the best racials for that. And UD racial is damn op.
---
I did, yeah. [I looked into the mod](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/cartographer/) and there's a module named Foglight which is the function that makes the unexplored areas of the map invisible. It makes calls to Ace-Event, Ace-Hook, and Ace-Library which should be included if you download from the link above.
---
unfortunately, I believe this version of the mod is meant for TBC because it has references to outland in it. I tried downloading it and it doesn't even show up in the addons selection
---
&gt; several items are BiS (warrior and shaman trinkets; warlock weapon) through to Naxx, so for balance reasons must be held back
---
I don't like this argument. Stuff like this is what defines Classic. There are tons of pre-60 quest/dungeon BiS items.
---
So it's the primal ancient system from Diablo III. Great. I'm glad I skipped that.
---
have a good one, muscles.
---
I dont have any spell power on my gear ATM, but it seams that it does not scale like it scailed on some freeservers.  
---
And it is also corect that Lifesteal will do more DPS in future cos of SPriest and Lock buffs and also Nightfall which I am looking for to wear.  
---
The only problem with crusader is that it has lower chance to proc in short figths like those in MC.
---
30 days, and it degrades one step down, to a minimum of 5g.
---
Your tank needs more threat. Im the tank that picks her up in p3. I put on a lot of threat gear vs her, she might kill 2 or 3 people in the transition but its totally fine since the battle is to reset her to phase 1 positionq
---
Lots to pick. First time in Karazhan, first kill of Garrosh, first completion of Warlock green fire quest, getting charged by a higher level warrior yet killed him.
---
llv 60 ... no wonder you are like a god among mortals in there
---
drop herbalism on your main for engineering , even if you don't pvp it is handy to have an extra teleport option and several funny gadgets, if you sometimes DO pvp it's a no brainer. 
---
and the basic idea is that, IF you have alts, engineering si the ONLY profession that actually provides something extra, something unique all the rest can by done by alts or others.
---
Time is money, friend
---
Don't go! I have so many Fantasy Football questions that I need you to answer for me!
---
This was a great, great read. Classic is what you make of it: The best nights are often the ones where you make your own fun!
---
Sure, but how would she benefit from releasing tier 0.5 and world PvP events? Those types of players don’t interact with end game content at all.
---
Traveler's Backpacks are about 20g per on my server
---
I sympathize with the place you are coming from when you feel that way. Unfortunately, not only is it *not* broken, it’s completely authentic to retail vanilla. That is not to say that there are not several bugs currently in existence that affect the ordering of some actions in the low-priority loop, of course.
---
Moving fast usually ends up with you way too deep in enemy lines, at which point it's fairly easy to surround you.
---
It's not important to anyone under 60 and it's not considered high priority at 60. Biggest single thing you can do for mitigation is equip a shield, there's no point in any other gear at 48. If your going to 2h tank just look for Stam, str, agi, gear until you get to mauradon and above where you can start getting the best items possible outside of raids
---
I hope you level cooling together with it!?
---
Hearthstone works as a continent jump
---
I see, so for leveling purposes I should stack up anything that increases damage as long as I keep up my armor and stamina? I know that around Mara/ST I will need to ditch the 2H and start using a shield
---
I need world pvp. I am not liking blizard.
---
Could be? My guilds top DPS are doing about 500 and lowest about 200 on single target
---
Meh, I got burnt out after running RFK for three days in a row with the limited time I had at nights. Waiting for group members, people dropping out halfway thru, corpsemaker not dropping once in 7 runs - I just said fuck it and rolled a mage. Got to 20 but I miss whacking things with a two-hander, and I feel like playing a warr. 
---
Not an ideal setup to be playing warr, but I still enjoy the game so sue me.
---
&gt; If you want to MT, you will probably get a guaranteed raid spot for as long as play.
---
I don't think you know how tanks in raids work. MT is probably the hardest spot to get. Most guilds form with a MT assigned lol. Even off tanking is extremely hard to get a spot for.
---
Hi, sorry,
---
Currently on alliance side ashbringer eu
---
yeah I might just not put in on except for raids/dungeons
---
Me hit hard.
---
Nothing could sway me to ever pick up retail.  I stopped playing vanilla when the 1st expansion dropped.  It's all down hill when Blizzard starts adding expansion content.  The more that gets added/changed the more bland and mundane the game becomes.
---
What if... candle take?
---
Only if you have LOS. Yes, just going after you is quicker and easier.
---
Having done this many times, going after you 2nd shows dominance.
---
All the +shadow +frost +healing sell good and wands with +int/stam are also selling pritty sell.
---
Thought hunters mark keeps you visible to the market through stealth and invis.
---
You don't want spirit though because the regen doesn't happen until after five seconds of not casting anything in combat. So every time you life tap you're stopping regen mechanics anyway. Not saying spirit is completely useless but it's your worst stat as a warlock.
---
And that’s what I love about tanking, but leading, marking, reading up and explaining fights, constantly gets to be draining.  Being a tank isn’t about always leading every dungeon run.
---
I understand that you might be joking, but on the offchance that you are not, I say this:
---
Have you considered seeing a doctor? This sounds a lot like clinical depression. Treatment is surprisingly easy in most cases and does not have to involve medication. If you really mean it, a doctor's visit could change your life.
---
AH
---
Traveler's Backpack
---
Mooncloth
---
Bottomless
---
That’s cool, but how would those people benefit from releasing tier 0.5 and world PvP objectives early?
---
If someone yells at you putting windfury before 5 sec after combat started they are a moron.
---
I'd be ready to bet some money those slow-ass tanks are the ones who keep whining in retail they don't get invited to higher keys.
---
Some tanks go slow because the group is slow overall, it's fine. As people said, slow is smooth, smooth is fast. 
---
But when there's a minute between each pull, healer full mana and waiting, and we pull one mob at a time, and pause for a minute after... you're just wasting everyone else's time.
---
In BC yes, not so much in classic.
---
What region are you playing? NA/EU etc?
---
I'd always advise PVP over PvE.
---
Sounds like you don't know how to socialize.
---
It’s worth, below 40 you don’t have a mount so even with the xp nerf you’ll be getting great xp, especially if it’s a mage or some other aoe dps class. Since you save time from running around, it’s worth.
---
The act of ninja-ing requires that loot rules be established (and ostensibly acknowledged) by party members prior to loot dropping.
---
Taking an item that is more directly useful to you by using the default looting mechanics of the game will not be considered a ninja action by GMs.  The best you're likely to get is a "yeah that sucks for you" or "fuck that guy" from the community.
---
Farming those elementals and killing every alliance that I see has made that rep kind 10x more fun. I’m always on high alert paying attention to my surroundings and saving my cds just in case I get jumped. It takes longer, but when a faction war breaks out you can’t help but feel a little proud as you stealth over to the area with the mobs nobody is paying attention to anymore.
---
I’ve never seen the need for us to use macros, I have my stances binded to f1-3.
---
I always farie fire a rogue kek

Use all your energy on that vw, I'll make him a bubble when hes about to die.

This subreddit is turning into "look how much luck I had this time". Gratz' but boring.

&gt; Drink the rest of the can if:

&gt; You gank someone.

&gt; Someone ganks you.

something tells me that I'd die from this drinking game.

When I was still level 58 I happened to join a 4man of fresh 60s (last month) who all turned out to be nice people and good players, i was the only 58, they desperately needed a tank at 2 am, I took care of them, they took care of me, I'm one of thier guild tanks now and we often do dungeons together, especially me and the healer. They hooked me up with all the good tank loot in mc and ony, and when quel serrar dropped in DM on our second day there, they all passed it to me.
---
You're completely missing the point. Either way, the warrior is going to farm arena. No matter what, you're going to farm for your pre-raid BiS in general. You might as well do it before you hit 60. What's the point of waiting until 60? There is none. In return you don't hit 60 as fast, but when you do hit 60 you are better geared. The alternative is to hit 60 quickly but have crap gear at 60. In the long run it is better to farm your pre-raid BiS before 60, because you're going to be doing it at 60 anyway. It's not a waste of time at all, it's an efficient use of time. I get that you disagree, I just want you to understand the point I'm making because it seems like you don't get it.
---
having herbalism on 2 characters just means more mats getting funneled to your alchemist char. I wouldnt bother leveling enchanting but it wouldnt be bad to grab just to Disenchant stuff to get mats from greed roll gear from dungeons and then get another enchanter to do stuff for a tip.
---
That's ''Oliver Tree'' i kind of like his voice, didn't really put any thought into the music choice, just picked something that sounded chill.
---
NO CHANGES
---
Exactly.
---
But in all seriousness you need to throw that shit down faster.
---
50s per box seems to be the average rate on my server. 1g on higher level boxes.
---
yea there was no way of stopping us, we had two raids just outside to guard the entrance
---
It depends on the pulls and it depends on your group. If you have to heal 2 1 shot melee and a lock all rushing through the dungeon you will have mana issues. 
---
I haven't had issues with anyone yelling at me because of any of my totem, wf including but this is also up to you. If you forget to put it or always put it at the end of the pull, I can see why people might complain.
---
On the other hand playing a resto shaman outside dungeons/raids is horrible in my opinion. You can't farm anything which requires killing. You will always have to group up with a dps when in a deep resto spec. 
---
If you love healing, go for it. Else think about it, again.
---
nah that’s essentially what happened in retail.. people wanted flying, they wanted group finder, they wanted faction changes, they wanted transmog, they wanted raid difficulties... all of those things would
---
have passed playerbase votes.
---
make a mage and aoe farm, or aoe farm dungeons on repeat. This is the fastest way to level, but is incredibly boring
---
Haha rogues are so easily to deal with, when you pass the 3 button brainless combo they spazz out and its an instant win. Back to fortnite kid.
---
You can definitely do it without macros but it will not be as easy.
---
Ran through LBRS with a prot pally recently - fast, efficient run, I'm 5/8 T1 Hunter and had little if any threat issues.
---
We defeated Illidan right before the patch that nerfed all the raid boss health in TBC. We had struggled quite a bit on him for a while and that was an incredible feeling.
---
Armor having diminishing returns is a common misconception. Each point of armor increase time to death by the same amount as the previous point, until you hit the hard cap.
---
Wowhead has a quest tracker program for classic. I suggest installing that and double checking that you have completed all the previous class quests for Shaman. I'll update this post with a link once I'm at my computer. ~4 hours
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Beyond that, I would submit a ticket for GM help.
---
I've given up on my Invincible farm and I'm about 600kills into Tusks of Mannoroth and losing hope on that to.
---
Any times nowadays is just rested xp leveling.
---
So true. -10 dkp
---
In WotLK I enjoyed Alterac Valley so much, I ended getting exalted with them. Only then to find out there was a mount! Seeing that cool Frostwolf was what started my mount collecting addiction. To this day, I still use the Frostwolf as my ground mount on my Mage when I play it.
---
Again, no. 90% of wipes are the heals. Not the tank. They're sunder bots with more health than average. There are no tanking parses. A healer above 90% parse will keep the group up no matter how many mistakes the tank makes.
---
I don't think there slow rolling it. People are just starting to reach 60 for the first time. Shit most my guild and other guild I was in was 90% in the 45-50 range..  you just went way too hard way to fast as the rest of you squabblers on here.  Your the loudest so you likely feel there's a bunch for you 'bored LVL 60's)
---
I'm not denying the batching issue, I said it's happened a lot to me when using CC for example.  
---
Just saying vanish hasn't bugged on me yet unless I've done it as they've debuffed me with a dot or something and it didn't cancel it out (ie vanishing a blind, or a death coil).
---
Always stay behind your tank is what i say. You were right to leave if he did not listen.  There was that one time ,As a mage i felt funky and pulled a group for a warrior tank without asking. We killed it , yes but it was a shit show because tank could not get enough rage. ( all mobs were chasing me not him). I also died.  It was not worth it and time was actually wasted.
---
So I'm greedy because I want everyone to have an equal chance at something worth the same to all of them.
---
But your not greedy for removing the chance for some to roll because they can't equip the item? Which is irrelevant for BoEs? 
---
The logic doesn't make sense.
---
I tanked up to BRD as arms. At 55 I went fury/prot. My solo mob kill speed is the fastest it's ever been and I am able to tank without a respec although not having tactical mastery on a warrior feels real sad (and makes picking up aoe groups mid fight very difficult)
---
&gt;There is really just 0 justification to give onslaught to your MT at all in this phase. If top tanks can hold aggro without it, you can hold aggro without it. Play better.
---
&gt; Only in a very hardcore guild should the MT get onslaught. 
---
 You contradict yourself in only one minute. Nice job.
---
Wow, having to hit a whole three keys instead of smashing one three times. So OP.
---
I did leave it unlocked so the convo wasn't cut-off. I understand your concern though, and appreciate the feedback.
---
As a graphic designer I just wish there is a special place in hell for you &lt;3
---
They pay me $15 an hour to play
---
If your 60 friend has the time have them run you through all the quests in each zone and all the low level dungeons as your reach them.  Make sure you find a few other lowbies for the dungeon groups so exp wont he nerfed as bad. With their help ypubcould probably be 30 in about 8 hours and 60 in aboit a week or so.
---
I’m gonna make a warrior don’t mind going full tank build for dungeons/raids it’s just my only concern is how well do Prot Warriors fare in WPvP? Thinking I could just use my planned Prot build for PvE then start getting Fury/Arms gear for PvP??
---
Why yes, I have noticed that RNG is RNG.
---
I kill one side on the way to the bosses, other side on the way out. No one has complained so far in my groups.
---
How does it help when members click on it as well?
---
I have 2 questions about Molten Core and the rune dousing.
---
Firstly if you go for 8/10, and you clear 3/7 runes on a wednesday, do the runes stay doused the whole week, or will we need to douse all 7 to get Majordomo to spawn?
---
Secondly if you go 9/10 on a wednesday, but you do not talk to majordomo to summon Ragnaros, can you go directly to Rag's room and ask Majordomo to summon him, or do you need to kill Majordomo again?
---
Tier 0.5 is on par with tier 1/2 in several cases and would clash with what is now cutting edge raiding.  It needs to be later.
---
And the WPvP objectives were quite important in Phase 5/6 content.  In Naxx in particular you can use every bit of damage help you can get and the towers will have action.
---
You could just go through middle, I normally go right because its safer.
---
Small disagreement here, part of being a good leader is recognizing how your influence or “power” effects people.
---
I’m not saying a leader needs to consider the meaning behind every single interaction, but recognizing in general is valuable.
---
Being the leader means not being afraid to make mistakes though. Making good decisions is important too, but you need to be ok with not always being right, and with getting the info you need from your party.
---
Pretty sure theyre grinding mobs in Silithus.  I want to say its the cultists or whatever there that give 1 rep per kill
---
Man the mages are getting salty
---
I would advise you to take a break. You clearly have a lot of anger and decide to take it out on random internet strangers. Get help
---
5 melee groups. So that is 5 shamans, 2 tanks and then 15-17 warriors/rogues depending on how many hunters you have. At least 1 resto druid and 3 locks or curses. You want 3-6 other healers and the rest can be other ranged DPS.
---
This. What the fuck. Yesterday I had a tank who watched too many speedruns on YT or some shit. Wanted to skip a pack to get to the boss. We got wiped 3 times because of that pack that he did not want to tank. He got kicked.
---
I love my warrior but i will NEVER AGAIN level one up on classic
---
You're not using other abilities enough.
---
Heroic strike is ass. Always.
---
Alright, first of all thanks, here are two examples: tanking leggings from bed has around 750 armor and death bone leggings from scholo have 550 with 20 stamina. Tank gloves from the hunter boss in DM West have 540 armor vs tanking gloves from rad that has 400 but those have 15 strength which is 30 attack power. This will translate into more threat I just wanna know how much indignation am I giving up
---
I like that a lot, thank you much!
---
Incredible read.
---
Handy, ty
---
Not at all, if the mage wants to go faster he should have rolled a tank. It’s incredibly hard to pick up aggro after the minions are attack anything but you. The mage was creating extra stress and probably slowing the group down in the long run.
---
There are plenty of people who aren't serious that play just as much, if not more, as raiders and pvpers.
---
If the mobs are Grey to your 60, the xp will be like 10-25% of what they would normally be. And split in half for being in a party. 
---
Best thing is to have alt 10 levels higher or so, don’t be in party. Tag a creature that is at least green to higher level. Then kill it. Works best on elites. My friend has been 5-8 levels above me the whole grind to 60. We’ve done it time to time. 300-600 xp per elite isn’t bad. Level depending.
---
Yes but you have a pretty high chance to block with holy shield up even without redoubt.
---
\*cries in warrior trying to kill him with a bow for the next 19 hours*
---
This is just wrong if you are looking to parse. You burn mana in raids and use consumables to keep going. Half the dmg in a raid doesnt even have mana.
---
Unfortunately there is no other way to play mage but frost at this stage of the game.
---
I started a saying in my guild... "10/10 groups wipe because of skipping enemies".
---
3% from the first 5 weapon skill (the rest of the points don't do much), and 1% from the 1% hit on the item.
---
When its out of charges it is literal garbage.
---
So yeah you wont be using every pull
---
I think we can both respectfully disagree, and be glad our partners share that feeling of responsibility
---
The only gnomish stuff are death ray and chicken? Rest is goblin? That’s not as bad as I thought.
---
Nope, you weren’t wrong. These Classic mages are gonna learn the hard way, it seems. The group moves at a pace determined between the tank and the healer’s mana bar. And like you said, tanks get instant groups. Bad DPS players who don’t want to be part of the team are not entitled to your time or effort. No skin off our asses as tanks to dump a group of bads.
---
Fishing Oily Blackmouth in darkshore netted me about 6g an hour including the wreckages its pretty good, and grinding clams.
---
Sulfuras?
---
Flying killed WPVP. It's so frustrating to be unable to interact with anyone around you because they only touch ground for seconds, and by the time you get over to them, they're off to the skies.
---
if I have a tank that needs on fury items while I´m the fury in the group i would understand because we're playing the same class and he is actually trying while I'm being useless
---
No, you were not wrong.
---
Which is true. But your question was "who plays WoW and doesn't want to raid or PvP though" and that's what I answered towards :)
---
Not to mention mythic keystones.
---
They need to do something to revitalize the massive chunk of dead, lifeless content the game is dragging around with it.  Classic feels alive because most zones are teeming with people still.  The world is big, yet very small compared to retail.  Talents / glyphs (maybe) should come back.  Forging needs to go.  Keep LFR but neuter the rewards so people can experience story stuff without being overcompensated for minimal effort.  I'd rather they did away with heroic/mythic.  There should just be casual and normal difficulties, with normal being a genuine challenge.  Class identity would be cool.  Trangsmog is fun.  Make crafting worthwhile again.
---
it is a classic speedrunner trick
---
I like how I got downvoted for wanting the best tank druid staff.
---
I'll get the maul even though it's slightly worse mitigation. The increase is haste has me intrigued. But if I had a wardens I wouldn't bother.
---
fk, I just hit 60 and was thinking about farming that...
---
I just trade them the box. Not like in the ‘this item won’t be traded’ slot. Straight up give it to them. Not usually worth the time or effort for me. Now I’m wondering if it’s consensual. Am I forcing my box on somebody?
---
I’m gonna be honest, there aren’t any weapons pre-60 that are worth grinding for. (Maybe ravages for melee cleave in ZF?  Most dungeons pre-60 are done once to get the juicy quest experience or a couple items from rewards. The only dungeons worth running more than once are SM,ZF and BRD. Maybe ST if you wild
---
Yes, yes, million times yes.
---
You can see me in the thread you linked, I posted about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cvdkjn/another_plea_include_the_t05_dungeon_set_2_quest/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share and I absolutely agree.
---
Well written too. Enjoy your gold.
---
Is that an IASIP reference??
---
Not all, no, but a huge portion of it certainly is.
---
My favorite moment in Wow is meeting my two good friends when we were weeks in to the game at lvl 15. We have enjoyed many fun nights grinding and hunting for gear.  We've played wow now for 15 years and are once again enjoying our roots in classic. :)
---
Killing 25Heroic Lich King the first time.
---
Hunter grind.
---
Yeah I know. I'll go back when I'm 60. No sense trying to farm them at lvl 30ish
---
The ST quest staff is not better than an Azuresong Mageblade paired with any decent off-hand...
---
23 should be fine to work on Redridge quests. That zone has a lot of stuff that is designed to be group content; it doesn't make you underleveled. 
---
Outside of that, Ashenvale as other ppl suggested is good, and also Duskwood, which is just to the south of redridge.
---
I don't think BG's existing killed WPvP but I do wish that WPvP fights gave more weight to honor than BGs. If you're in the world looking for fights you might kill 5 people over an hour and probably not multiple times. If you're in a BG you automatically have at least 10 people who will almost definitely be dying at some point and you get a ton of honor kills in 15-30 minutes. I just wish there was a way that rewards would be even if you choose to do WPvP or BGs.
---
That being said, I am disappointed that addons like VanasKOS or Spy work the way they do. Having to constantly pan your camera around looking for opponents, getting the jump on someone or having them get the jump on you is a fun part of leveling IMO. With these addons no fights are ever really a surprise and it kinda kills a lot of the appeal of WPvP to me.
---
On rattlegore, horde is always raiding alliance cities. Alliance has tried a couple times but never got past becasuse once the words "Alliance are infront of (name the horde city)!" BOOM horde start pouring in.
---
I got preraid bis for shadow already aside from benediction too, the question is mostly performance... My faction is massively outnumbered and tired of dying to rogues with no recourse. Was thinking about a 20holy 31 shadow but I feel like then I'd do nothing well
---
&gt; but it will not be as easy.   
---
&gt;So OP.
---
Drop the attitude. No one said anything about macros being OP. The point is to make things easier. Just because you refuse to out of stubborn ignorance doesn't mean you need to throw a bitch fit.
---
LF 1 Tank for ZF. Need mallet!
---
I see what you did there. Take my upvote!
---
Haha fair enough
---
Its very clear that you were camped one too many times right?
---
Makes 100% sense, my group never does it
---
They either kill everything on the way in or skip it again on the way back out
---
he was half hp and mana.
---
To add to the previous comment:
---
If you have int/spirit gear, you absolutely can heal with your spec all the way through 60 with where your points should be now. The 20% int from HotW is so good. As for the res, I have healed many dungeons without another rezzer. I would make a point to say that if a DPS pulls aggro and dies, they have to run back. You can continue clearing 1 dps down. Save the B-rez for the tank in an emergency or if they die and they dps are all still up.
---
I just like seeing rogues waste their vanish = p
---
I agree. The old world pvp was a major thing that made the game feel empty when it went away.
---
This is your problem as a new player. Dont worry about what others think. Play for your damn self.
---
Feel like I might have been in that group lmao
---
Not on a hunter, since they can start the fight with DPS gear, use the trinket, and then FD to swap into full hit gear.
---
I guess we can, just remember, your confidence comes and stays with not dying, which isnt on you.
---
Based on the comment in the link it might come from hermit ortell in silithus
---
- LFG / Raid Finder limited only to the guild.
---
- No more "endless" mechanics (ie, infinite azerite farming).
---
- An option to turn off OTHERs transmog and see the gear they're really wearing.
---
- Class identity stuff like buffs, counters, etc.
---
- Remove level scaling mobs (maybe keep dungeon scaling).
---
If you really need someone to DE stuff why not just make a banker / enchanter toon to park in Ironforge?  I believe they don’t have to really level up to be able to DE everything you send them.
---
That way the level 60 toons can stick with profs to use out in the wild.
---
I'm going as fast as i can and am only lvl 43 so far. I wish it was 2006/2007 again and i could play this game for days.
---
sheep hunter, kill pet
---
doesn't work as well when pvp trinkets are introduced, though
---
&gt;The bosses are easy as hell as long as you organise it properly.
---
So as long as you do the hardest part of raiding properly, the easy parts are easy?
---
I mean, I kinda get what you are saying, but getting together enough people who have decent gear and know the fights as always been the hardest part of MC and Onyxia. What's truly "trivial" is putting together a raid group that isn't capable of killing a single boss in MC.
---
&gt; I will never go back
---
yeah, i was just replying to that
---
Mage lasher farming with herb is the truth. So easy and consistent. You can even do it in raid spec.  Just turn on some good music and I go for hours.
---
It’s estimated 200 hours to get to 60, if you’ve been raiding for 2 weeks you’ve played more heavily than most people. Congrats on the time management, but I don’t think it’s wrong to say you’re an outlier. Also, what else do you do in your free time besides be with your wife and play WoW? Activities involving your wife don’t count as double here, serious question, just to have a better understanding of people’s play times
---
I took threat plates off. it was a nice addon, but not really required I suppose. didn’t really want to dig around and figure out how to change unit frames.
---
as a hunter i hate you, ive lost it 3 times to you damn fury wars
---
I stand with thee good fellow o7
---
Yup
---
na lol fuck him i dont blame u
---
Sure im sitting on two lvl 50s, but that doesnt mean im gonna get bored of them both, that only means that i can start getting them both to 60. Plus whats wrong with trying out a different class?
---
Warlocks are making up a close-second for me, lol. 
---
Leaving pets on defensive, fearing when they get aggro, hellfire on packs of 2....
---
That’s loads less fish than I got this morning going 275 to 300!
---
When I tank. I dictate the run. If people do not like it I can and will kick to replace or form a new group. 
---
Some people may perceive it that way and not have to deal with the group itself. 
---
My advice to anyone willing to tank or has a fear of tanking is there is do your research there is a learning curve, people will complain, people will get mad, people will ninja, you may be nervous. However if you dictate the run and deny the negativity getting to you. You will have an easier time. 
---
Don't be afraid to tell people no or tell them how you are going to do things. Tanks who do this are better and more loved all around. You have every right to have a say in the how the dungeon will proceed yet you can sti) make mistakes too. Patience, knowledge, and positivity.
---
They can perform their role, stop being bad.

why is it always mages , whenever there is a guy pulling extra it's always a mage ..
---

---
Well for starters your on a PVP server, this has been an issue since the dawn of WoW, especially in places like BRM where so many dungeons and raids are hosted.  For starters it will always be really bad during peak raid times as groups of 40 people try to control the raid instance preventing the other faction from entering.  I also play on Benediction-Alliance and it really isn't that bad of an issue, fairly balanced server imo.  Sometimes the horde control BRM and sometimes the Ally control BRD really depends on the time.  Also whoever is controlling it can change over the matter of 15mins, as groups zone in and come out to summon etc.  It just is what it is, sometimes you have to corpse run sometimes you have to fight your way in, or just try to hail-mary into the instance, sometimes your on the other end of it.  If you want some real action just wait until Phase 2 when Honor gets released along with BWL, all the PVP guilds will just be camping the entrance for honor.
---
Yep. /who azhara and look at the 10+ priests/shamans competing for the 6 pools that can yield essence of water -- then realize that's only half the competition because you're only seeing your own faction.
---
If your server has too many people, and the other server has too few people... there's this small chance you could have medium populations on both CALL ME A MAD MAN
---
If you want to min-max, there are two different tanking sets you'll want to build. The first set would be "effective health", which balances armor and stamina to maximize your survivability. You'll have to do the math or look for a graphic somewhere to find the breakpoints where one stat is greater than the other. This set is good for most tanking situations, and is pretty good for fast-hitting bosses or bosses with unpredictable burst. An example would be if you were the main tank for Patchwerk; he hits the main tank FAST, but weakly (compared to the offtanks), so dodging a handful of his hundreds of attacks might not pay off as much as reducing each attack's damage.
---
The second set would be a dodge/avoidance set. For this set, you pretty much just want enough HP to survive a big hit or two, and throw all your other stats at pure avoidance. The idea is that your healers will be able to top you back up before the slow-but-hard-hitting boss hits you a second time. This would be good for the Patchwerk offtank. Patchwerk hits the offtank for HUGE damage, if he hits you twice without you being topped off, you'll die pretty much no matter what, but maybe makes the attack once every 3 seconds; you'll save healer mana here by maximizing your dodges, any stamina beyond the bare minimum required to survive one attack is wasted, because there isn't a way to get enough stamina to survive TWO attacks.
---
I've oversimplified my examples and the boss mechanics for the sake of clarity. I'm sure some pedant will chime in with a WHALE AKCTULAYY, but the overall message and theory still holds. Classic WoW might not have the gear diversity to build two sets; the best Effective Health items might also be the best Avoidance items in almost all cases. (I haven't looked at classic tank gear options, however in TBC and beyond there were multiple tank items of the same "tier", some making a trade-off between HP/Armor vs Dodge/Parry)
---
If it can 2shot you, your goal should be to barely survive the first shot, and dodge as many shots as you can. If it can't 2shot you, your goal should be to absorb as many attacks as possible before going down. If you don't want to/can't build multiple sets, go for an Effective Health set, as it is the most generally useful.
---
If you don't follow the tanks pace then you are shit at this game.
---
Rofl even as horde I love this comment.
---
huh?
---
If a party member in a pug thinks it's a good time to troll someone, then I'm leaving. That is not acceptable behavior, like wtf.
---
Crack.  Or maybe a really solid blow to the head.
---
...o, nude nelfs lap dancing in org.  I’d probably go back to see that.
---
That game is finished. Too late.
---
This is what it’s like to join the military at 30
---
I meant for soulbound blues from bosses. I have an alt for all my greens as I'm herb alch on my main.
---
Tanking is fine with patient, mature players. Playing with people who don't understand threat and have never attempted to tank can be a little difficult.
---
I agree about spy, I use it because you have to if you want an even playing field but I’d rather Blizzard break it, but I don’t know how they can without breaking a lot of things.
---
You stack spirit at 60? lol
---
Just create a level 1 alt to park in Ironforge or other big city and train them in Enchanting.  They can DE everything for you and either sell them or send them back to your other toons.  No need to waste a level 60 on enchanting unless you are truly planning to farm top of the line enchants
---
I'm imagining them using an `is_kalimdor` variable, defaulting to `false`.
---
They're pretty weak in comparison. A single shadow word: pain can do upwards of 2K damage, and a set of warlock DOTs is probably around 3K. Melee would do what, 500-1000 damage with all their bleeds at most?
---
According to /u/dbDozer armor gains are not dimishing, so I would prioritize armor &gt; stam &gt; threat &gt; defense personally. Assuming you have ~3.8k HP, a 20 stamina increase is an approximate 5% increase in HP. 200 armor increases your time to death by roughly 1.9%. If you can survive long enough for your healers to heal you, I would personally go with the tank leggings. 
---
Your second inquiry is a different question. The way I see it is that your first priority is survival. If you can't take the hits and stay up, you need more mitigation, DPS should reduce their output so that they don't rip threat off of you accordingly. If you can take the hits, you can get away with having more threat and DPS can increase their output. However, if DPS is going all out and you can hold threat just fine, having extra threat is less useful than having extra mitigation, as this serves as a safety net for you and your party/raid. As you can see this really depends on who you're playing with, their gear/ability and what you're up against. There's no real cookiecutter answer to this, but these are the guidelines I personally use for determining how much mitigation to give up for threat and vice-versa.
---
"Dead servers". Still more players on them than original vanilla realms.
---
Would you even need to kill the hyenas?  If you can agro them in a group you may be able to just keep the dots on the boss up and loot n scoot as the hyenas run back.  Might give that a shot tonight.
---
Level with a Druid
---
Think Faerlina still gets queues at times and they are still on multiple layers just fyi.
---
I feel like if this happens again the best thing to do is:  
---
1. Agree on what the market value of the time is, and; 
---
2. Agree that whoever wins the roll trades the loser half the market value in gold, maybe minus 10% for transactional considerations.  
---
So in your case you guys could agree that the winner pays the loser 40g or something like that. Maybe even just agree to a lower number just so the loser walks away with something, like 20g.
---
I go to the gym 3-4 times a week.  
---
I go to football games on sundays.
---
I go out to social events (dinners or house parties) every Friday and Saturday night.
---
Not saying I haven’t played a lot because I have but it doesn’t mean you have no life!
---
That is your way of playing and sure, keep at it. I'm happy that we are in different factions.
---
Maybe your next adventure is going outside or taking a shower?!
---
Surprisingly enough it happened in classic. I joined a 40-man onyxia pug and we had to go out and summon 1 more person. But we were told there was an alliance raid outside contesting. So we all counted down and AOEd all at the same time and melted the entire raid that was DM buffed. It was glorious
---
You share candle?
---
AFK's in Brackenwall until 5 minutes before pull.
---
"need summon"
---
Its not that its bad, its just not optimal. WC is fine in dungeons, but when mages farm its often going to be solo aoe grinding (i.e., ZF) where you are killing stuff primarily with blizzard. Since Blizzard can't crit, WC and shatter are both kinda useless but you absolutely want shatter for pvp.
---
&gt; it helps buffer dispells 
---
This is a valid theoretical use for it, but seems like a minimal advantage. There is no CD on dispel in classic (and no anti-dispel stuff like UA), so a 1/5 chance to apply a very soft dispel buffer is kinda meh IMO. And 5/5 would require points to come from I don't even know where. 
---
If I was going a pure pvp talent spec, I cannot think of something I would be willing to give up to put points in WC. That said, going WC and shatter to be able to raid and pvp without respec'ing seems like a perfectly good idea.
---
what i did was id send my vw after one mob, throw agony, tag another one with immo -&gt; other dots -&gt; fear -&gt; corruption vw target and widdle them both down. if you just do single pulls youll always pull off the vw.
---
you can also do the drain spec
---
not only that, but creating an entirely new post rather than looking up the error message as if its never happened to anyone ever before
---
Warriors do well against both of those classes. It's not surprising you'd win.
---
Default graveyard for Alliance is Sentinell Hill.
---
Default for Horde is Tarren Mill.
---
If you die in weird spots where there's no graveyard you get sent to the default spot.
---
I think being a bit of a diva as a tank/healer is warranted sometimes.  Even if you're not technically leading the group they literally can't run the dungeon without you.  It's up to them to try to keep you happy or replace you if you don't get along for whatever reason.  If you tried to communicate with the problem player and they don't adjust then you're not obligated to stay with the group.
---
TB and Darnassus are the two easiest ones
---
Noob aid. L2p
---
Post bc, the whole game became a shitshow of catering to welfare demanding casual ass ten year olds.
---
I left my baron cloak on the boss because i didnt noitce my inventory was full and clicked the mage port :(
---
My favourite WoW memory was lanning with my friends as Alliance and going to Thousand Needles and pvping all night long. Eventually some 60s showed up and crushed us, but we really had such a blast.
---
MAD MAN!
---
Doing a partial guild/partial pug MC run; master looter wasn't paying attention and gave the tranq shot recipe to a level 59 hunter meaning we weren't able to attempt Mag.
---
Oh yeah curse of doom should be higher but it lasts so long that you don't normally count it. If the target gets away with the curse on them, they'd have no trouble eating or bandaging to stay alive.
---
Order your pet to attack a mob and laugh as sap wears off and the rogue is at max distance for dots.
---
Deep Prot is the way to go if you want to tank half heartedly. It's a ton easier just because sunder cheaper and threat is so high. 
---
I tank with almost full pre bis with a 17/34/0 Fury dps build. But it's a freaking pain to hold aggro vs mages and rogues. 
---
If you want to tank only, go full prot. It's like tanking on cocaine compared to arms/ fury tanking. But Solo play is boring af.... 
---
If you want to tank on/off to get in groups.. find a spec you like to play and try your best in dungeons to hold aggro. Most group don't give a crap about spec anyway.
---
Welcome to overpopulated servers. Your "dead servers" are the true vanilla experience. This is what you get for rolling on a high pop server
---
What do you think classic is?
---
As a lock, it always fills me with loathing to see that giant glowing red mark appear. I guess I'm not a very good lock, because I almost always lose if I don't initiate.
---
Weird. Two days ago i had the dumb stam/spirit mail BoE epic helm drop in strat live. It's worth 10 or 15g. Yesterday, the same helm dropped from the same group of mobs. I didn't run dungeons in between.
---
This could be some "stars are aligned" kinda shit but i really hope it doesnt become an exploitable glitch
---
That spot is to the north of that sludge fen place or whatever, in the northeast of the zone. You can easily walk up there after entering Barrens through Ashenvale.
---
If you were Horde and ahead of the level curve, it probably would be fun to gank low-level Alliance trying to pull that trick before they get to the "Unknown" area where they res in Westfall.
---
Shaman tier gear is healing throughout every raid. You need to pick up epic scraps here and there, but shamans scale so terribly poorly in dps you might as well get nightfall and focus on buffing others while doing your terrible dps.
---
They really aren't a dps class ever, but enhancement can be decent by buffing others.
---
A complete rework of the power progression treadmill and full removal of forging.
---
Loot should have ONE layer of RNG.. The bosses loot table 
---
Character Progression should be based on one layer RNG loot, the item dropping, additional content should reward cosmetic rewards and should only be earned through feats of skill. End of discussion. 
---
There should be raid loot, pve mythic +15 cosmetic set, and a solo trial cosmetic set that are all extremely rare. 
---
I'm sickened by the participation trophy system infused with hyper RNG. It's cancer.
---
.5 was outdated when it came out in vanilla.
---
Making a hunter alt. Which professions should I take to make $$$, or at least be useful during leveling? I have a 50 Warlock with herb/skinning.
---
Open your eyes matey
---
If the boss is taunt immune then mocking blow won't work. Not would challenging shout.
---
obv we have never crossed paths :)
---
Nakama taunt
---
Dude youd be surprised.
---
Don’t overreact, just do green quests and mobs 4 lvls lower. Somehow 4-5 lvls lower is sweet spot for me where i can sustain killing one by one. 
---
Also the reason I think it might be better to switch to fury faster.
---
If you fly over the dungeon or try to climb in from outside the actual portal, you get a debuff and an alert that says something like "It's getting hard to breathe."
---
If the debuff ticks out, you are stunned and teleported about 200 yards from the entrance to the instance.
---
In the open.
---
This is extra annoying when SOMEHOW the flight path goes over the dungeon, gives the debuff, and wrenches me from the safety of the flight master with guards and plops my hairy ass in the wide open.
---
I hear you man, it’s just difficult defining arbitrary lines of playtime. Especially when there are only two categories, casual and no-life. The fact that it was projected to have people running raids in late November and early December does tell you a bit about how much was expected, and the fact they’re being run now by so many people is shocking. I’m right there with you though boss
---
You are better off waltzing them through quests, as quest XP is not affected.
---
What is the best way to make gold as a holy priest end game?
---
&gt;some would argue, BiS...
---
Who is arguing that?   Here is a list of some 2handers that aren't needed to be constantly farmed: 
---
Impervious Giant, Bonecrusher, The Rockpounder, Fist of Omokk, Slavedriver's Cane...
---
Plenty of good 2 handers for ferals that aren't a 1 handed combo.   I'd argue it's easier to get something like a Bonecrusher also which is a quest reward.   Is there a 1 handed combo that competes with Bonecrusher?
---
what 2h spec are you running? I'm a tauren war going fury and was planning on going 2h too (even though it's less dps than dw, but better for AOE i guess).
---
That’s very whack. 
---
I solo’d DM on a whim as a 45 Druid and that ring dropped and was actually an upgrade for my healing set. Go figure.
---
As long as you have an int set, you should be able to heal any 5 man with no resto talents. 55+ instances might be tougher without a good tank.
---
There's potions that remove poisons.
---
Hey now, that sounds an awful lot like giving up!
---
Nothing haha u got pranked Xd
---
Guides will just pressure you into min/maxing your character which although beneficial for top parses it is unnecessary for most classic content.  Play what ever is fun.
---
As a mage who used to play warrior, you did the right thing.
---
This strategy has worked for me so far:
---
Realize that classic wow blows absolute ass, and that the only reason you should tryhard this ridiculous consumable farming simulator is if (for whatever damaged reason) you want to grind R14. If you stick to raid logging, messing around on alts, and playing other games where your success is not determined by how many hundreds of FAP/LIP/ETC you are willing to burn, you will have a better time.
---
For the price of high end graphics card, you can buy a whole new PC. Once you start upgrading individual components, you could run into compatibility issues and things like RAM timing, Power Supply and Motherboard specs. 
---
I’d recommend just heading to best buy and seeing what they have. My list of recommendations include: SSD, i5 or i7 processor, and a dedicated GPU with Display Port (usually GeForce). 
---
My next recommendation would be a gaming monitor that runs at 120 Hz with low latency. It makes a big difference from 60Hz. In my opinion a bigger monitor isn’t always better especially if your sacrificing refresh rate.
---
My naxx guild had a second group from MC runs just for the chance for bindings
---
I mean when I run things with my guild, or a partial premade from another guild things are fine, but during the leveling process in standard LFG channel groups I find a LOT of players who don't have a clue.
---
Yeah, you're right. More I've thought about it and read the arguments, the more obvious it is.
---
If your spouse puts you in the dog house because you didnt ninja an item in a video game for them, you should probably find a new spouse.
---
I use healbot with mouse over macros.
---
NO! YOU NO TAKE CANDLE!
---
Also I'd venture a guess and say most rogues don't have improved sap as that is more of a pvp talent
---
Remindme! 6 hours "reasons"
---
Isn't this also in Win7?
---
Ill take over populated now if it means longevity. At this point i doubt many new people are going to get involved. When BGs hit and overpops have reasonable queue times it will be doubly worth it.
---
Man I need to work on my fishing. Level 38, about to be level 39 on my warrior, with herb, skinning, first aid , and cooking all well above 225 but my fishing is still 50 lmao. One day i'll just sit down and fish it up
---
My lock is lvl 37 with 140+ shadow dmg and succ drain is the best spec I have found so far. I use void for sacrifice if I know that I'll going to get jump.
---
Please tell me you can do this with wingdings font lmao
---
Also, you don't smash it three times.  Changing stances isn't on global cooldown, so you can literally go from Battle Stance to Berserker and Activate Berserker Rage with one click (or button press if you have it bound).  
---
My one clicks:  Intercept, Overpower, Berserker Rage, Charge, Pummel - each click changes stance and performs the ability at once, given the rage pool is there.
---
Thank you for your input.
---
I had a player tell me they were surprised at how well I, Druid, kept aggro, did damage, and could throw spot heals.
---
I said "thanks :)", but in my mind, I'm like "This aint shit."
---
I light candle!
---
You will never see profits on a crafting profession unless you spend a lot of initial upfront cost leveling it up and then acquiring rare recipes that actually make gold. None of this is optimal for making money while leveling. If you want to get a crafting profession, you should just powerlevel one once you reach max level
---
I didn’t know that you could auto attack, as a Tauren warrior I would be furiously clicking on plainstriders thinking that the faster I clicked the more damage I’d do. It took me a long time to understand dungeon roles too.
---
Can someone explain to me mocking blow and why it’s important for me as a warrior tank?
---
Honestly I should have removed the rose goggles for like two seconds and realized that I would have disliked pretty much everything about vanilla mechanics. But instead I raced to 60 and geared myself, only to realize that the PVP is very subpar.
---
So now I just slither away to TBC private servers to play arena all day, and that works for me.
---
If you decide to stick it out, I'd recommend that you find yourself 3 other good friends and make yourself a death squad. You can roam WPVP and enjoy yourselves, and when BGs come out you can queue as a group and significantly decrease your chances of running into a premade that has stocked every consumable known to man (in the order of thousands).
---
Yeah it takes 24 seconds
---
Yeah I've been having a real tough time finding rich thorium. Easier to get a rag weapon than 20 arcane crystals for a reaper.
---
Yeah, I always point my gun at people to let them know I'm not going to kill them.
---
On an unrelated note, has anyone noticed a trend of people just giving you all of their money for no reason?
---
Completely disagree.  I enjoyed doing tribute runs, Strat and solo runs (5 man), UBER pugs.  I also enjoyed Raiding MC and Ony.  I also enjoyed battlegrounds PvP.  
---
Don't blame quality of life/ease of access on casuals.  A casual player can play vanilla wow for years, never experience all of the content and have a blast every time they log in, because there was always the sense you were progressing towards some goal.  That's why even the casuals love vanilla/classic wow.
---
Soloing that local turtle is a rite of passage for warriors.
---
Gonna steal your thread, resto shamans, have you succesfuly killed Rivendare when healing? With one dude we could not kill him with 10+ tries, not even kidding. With the other one we did 1st try ez pz. 1st one didnt even have to drink thru whole of Strat UD clearing trash. Totems just screwed up baron fight but the 2nd guy laughed me out after we did it on 1st try :s
---
Blizzard help website has an automated item restoration tool for anything you’ve recently thrown away/vendored. Just login and it will show you the available items for each character.
---
I’ve seen him 3x in a row as well, but we also went 40 runs without seeing him once. It would take some pretty solid evidence for me to change my opinion on the spawn rates, that said anecdotes only go so far.
---
Rats. That means I farmer BRD for no reason 😱
---
Yeah, though the mats for Lionheart helm... It's going to take time. I'm fine with that though, its good forever.
---
Ony neck, however, is a matter of luck. I haven't yet class restricted the head. Maybe I should do that, but I try to be as relaxed about loot as I can (we're not hardcore).
---
Are there any addons that open all your mail and grab the AH money?  
---
Like postal?
---
TBH any good Hunter will just burst you down in 3 shots if you focus the pet as a rogue
---
BGs will be cross realm.
---
I had the reed in my bags, but since it would only be adding about 1.25 dps per mobb it didn't seem worth it to use it over a defensive trinket, same thing with other spellpower gear. but ye if i had the skullflame and demonforged on me it would be worth it to have some more spellpower.  
---
The weapon chain is actually really clever, would have never thought of that. But would it beat a 30sp enchant if i had skullflame and df equipped?
---
oh! i was under the impression we are talking about deep frost build variations only. my bad :)
---
yes then i agree with you completly, there are way better talents to use in a more specific talent build than wc.
---
i personally went for shatter even tough i rarely pvp ouside of onybuff hunting raids with my guild because i enjoy shattering the dm lashers. you could farm them well enough without it but something about that flamestrike coc combo lets me farm there for hours without getting bored :D. solo pvp profitiency is merely a sidebenefit for me but i still think its worth it.
---
&gt; If I was going a pure pvp talent spec, I cannot think of something I would be willing to give up to put points in WC 
---
same :)
---
If taunt gets resisted, you can swap to battle stance and use mocking blow, then swap back to defensive stance
---
Death grips 16% dropped on my 16th try or so x(effin)D
---
As a hunter you should probly leave rogues alone lol
---
When burning crusade came out and getting to explore a new world, not sure why but that just special.
---
Nope
---
ah seems about right. Yeah I've noticed that going 2h is just crappier DPS overall atm. I'm using Bonecrusher since it's easily attainable but DW still feels like it does more damage (thrash blade and green sword). Guess only time will tell!
---
Yes for the first few weeks of Classic it looked like in your second screenshot. When it changed i assumed it was one of the newer addons i installed which interfered but didnt bother to check until now.
---
Not if you're leveling. It's not mana efficient.
---
You haven’t seen my spouse.
---
Kromcrush has one of the worst mafias across all the servers
---
If you get herbalism you can make roughly 50g/hr (30g/hr without herb) solo farming the lashers in DME. It's really easy you just need gear with enough intellect to have enough max mana to holy nova them down. Should be guides on youtube. You don't even lack efficiency compared to say a mage because you have to wait a full 12 minutes to reset the instance anyway. This farm is incredibly consistent and you can just run it for hours and hours. I love it. Really would recommend getting herb for it because it does boost gold per hour significantly.
---
AoE can work on elites but pretty much only if there is some AoE means of threat generation or crowd control. I've definitely been in teams where a combination of things like paladin consecration and mage blizzard + frost nova, etc CAN work. However if it goes wrong it goes very wrong, and while it most certainly can work it can also be really intense on mana usage, requiring frequent drinking to keep up the pace.
---
Its crazy. I've seen the offhand once, bracers once, meanwhile there's a guildie of mine who in their first UBRS run won not just the main hand, but the offhand as well (both dropped on his first kill, and he won both over 4 other rollers). Next run he picked up the bracers and belt, boom, done with UBRS after two runs.
---
Meanwhile, the rest of us are out here, running it several times a day, considering ourselves lucky if we can get one of the pieces we need.
---
I would say warrior is argueably the hardest to play at it's fullest potential due to the Heroic Strike "bug", where if you have a Heroic Strike queued, your off-hand gains auto-hitcapped if you have 9% hit (6% human/orc).. if you look through logs of fexample Magmadar, you will see bad warriors have 20-33% miss on white hits, while good warriors are in the 7-15% miss area
---
No, it would not. If you say, "young" people will assume you're talking about someone under 30. Not some random inexperienced person.
---
Ran DM N for the first time so i don’t know protocol on these sorts of things. But the key for the box dropped and someone else won it. Is it standard for whoever gets key takes all the loot in the chest? The pattern of hide of the wild was in there (I was only tribal LW in group). Also 2 more keys dropped right after. I don’t say anything bc I didn’t want to be an ass but can someone clear this up?
---
I try not to pug. But when I do I generally get smarter people. It is hard to do so as a spriest, a lot of people think we are trash
---
Only if they're a hunter, in which case they can mark their own. It's only ranged AP.
---
Oh damn, that will be a nice change. That certainly makes lower pop more attractive in the near term.
---
Track humanoid is a thing.
---
Do I need to be an blacksmith to use [Iron Counterweight](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6043/iron-counterweight#comments:id=2690060)?
---
Can I drop the profession once I applied it?
---
I also transferred to AR and one thing I would like to add I haven't seen folk comment on is it is a working server. You have a lot of folk with families and who work full time in this server. These are the people who couldn't play because of the queues.
---
So you don't have a lot of players during off times, but it seems quite populated after work/weekends. I have appreciated that because I farm later at night and am not disturbed.
---
Sure you can. Put two hunters or warlocks into your party and you are now buffing 7 targets—5 players and 2 pets.
---
This is my favorite
---
Holy nova DME is definitely viable but you’ll want PI and 6.3k mana. I got my epic mount doing this but the rng on loot is kind of absurd. Nothing one pack, two greens and a boe epic the next and everything in between.
---
Replied to the wrong comment
---
Generally whoever initiates wins, all else being equal. So long as you get your dots up and a fear, you win. 
---
But if you get charged, or stealth stunned, or pyroblaseted, or arrow barraged, then it’s hard
---
Yeah. It’ll be nice for queue times.
---
They were cross realm in the vanilla 1.12 as well.
---
It's a macro that puts Blessing of Protection on my target's target. I use it as a sort of taunt if i lose aggro. melee hate me but atleast they don't die :)
---
I did 1-300 in two days and found it super relaxing. Grabbed the fishing buddy add-on and just chugged away at some work on my other monitor, clicking once in a while to snag a fish.
---
I mean I pick up like one or three stacks of runecloth just running dungeons. Doesn't cost me a thing.
---
Ele is worse than enhance in raids, oom to quick. With enhance you can at least keep auto attacking.
---
This happened the first week I played wow and I never had an answer until now. I got scared and just deleted the character lmao
---
Just hit open all?
---
I sheep on the fly any time we pull more than we can handle. I ran with a group last night that was really good at making sure they didnt break sheep during mele, and we ran through SM pretty fast.   
---
Cant speak to the rest - never played a roger or a lock.
---
As a healer I almost always stand with the tank. If the tank ain't fighting, I ain't healing. Good luck dps.
---
*Tracks hidden* Watson come with me!  The game is afoot!
---
I got chewed out by a DPS for trying to heal a partial BRD run as a Shadow spec 55 priest. Is that really too low?
---
Gratz dude, on my server that would be 800g alone on the crystals, u sir are a badass
---
Tldr
---
So in short: People aren't usíng super safe noob tactics because they are no longer necessary.
---
Ok nice thread.
---
RF; fixed in the parent.
---
I was with you all the up until you said Brutality Blade is trash.
---
Mind backing up that statement? It has strength (threat), agility (threat and avoidance) and crit (threat). Its on the slow side, but other than daggers, all weapons are on the slow side, and since we don't have enough rage at this point to spam heroic strike, slow weapons aren't significantly different than fast weapons.
---
If I got a Quel'Serrar, sure, I'm not going to roll on Brutality Blade over a dps, but even Quel'Serrar isn't as good as Brutality blade (though it definitely win on style).
---
My personal favorite is when the mage blinks in, frost nova &gt; CoC &gt; AE spam. I have landed maybe 3 AAs in the time with 1-3 sunders. You're now tanking that entire pack buddy.
---
With good warriors, you just put the totems down *before* drinking, because they will pull the mobs towards it.
---
I died in Gnomer during a server crash and came back with no corpse at all. One ticket and some time on an alt later and my corpse was moved to the IF gates by a GM. Thank goodness it wasn't westfall!
---
Are you Horde? They need Horde on Earthfury and Heartseeker.
---
TradeSkillMaster has this.
---
I just have 5 characters that I rotate through. 3 alliance and 2 horde. All different race and class, servers picked based on friends (alliance on rppvp cause it's my SO and I and he let me pick and horde on pvp cause our buddy has a crazy good guild going).
---
Sure, I level "slower" than everyone else because I have 2 mains and 3 alts, but that also means I can maximize my rest XP and my actual experience of what I'm playing. 
---
Don't delete your hunter. Just play a different char for a while until you feel like leveling your hunter again
---
thats a mage who cares more about topping the dps meters than actually being good. the only people i've seen link damage meters are mages after trash AoE pulls where OF COURSE you topped the meter.
---
Do you mind ELI5 layering for me and what that means gameplay wise?
---
Charge-&gt; taunt pet and charge -&gt; reflector both negate the trap.
---
Disarming hunters removes their ability to gain ground after a wing clip.
---
Int shouting the pet removes the hunters ability to do anything at all.
---
Hunters were never a hard matchup for warriors, particularly engineers.
---
I enjoyed hearing all the theory crafting and dungeon battles the beta 30 cap and 40 cap crowd did.  I think it would be fun if blizzard mixed it up more, like they did releasing dire maul later.  They could release part or parts of the other phases sooner to mix up the meta and provide their vanilla with sprinkles experience they have come to produce.  
---
E.g. I swear I never had mobs evade when my sucubus came out of stealth in vanilla, but in classic it happens all the damn time.
---
This option sounds intriguing i love pvp and really wanted to go engineering on this guy, I just had my rogue as a miner/engineeer so I figured to go something else for a change of taste. Wont it be hard leveling engi without mining?
---
Nice good choice. I've got mage ready and waiting collecting that sweet sweet rested exp.
---
I leveled in Feral Druid(bear , and bear + kitty talents only)  + with a  Ret/holy pally.
---
Worked pretty great for us.  kitty and pally would ping pong tank, (pally pulls aggro, kitty rakes from behind, kitty has aggro, Pally judges, pally has aggro, kitty rakes again).  When more than 2 mobs, Bear tanked, Pally healed. The druid Feral Fairie Fire meant the duo could pull from range, and either one could spot heal. Getting dugeons was super easy, Druid tanked, pally went as dps or heals.
---
Supposedly the ultimate pally duo is Warlock + pally.  Pally is everything a warlock would want from a pet. (self heals, Health battery, holds aggro, beefy),  But I haven't personally tried that one.
---
My favorite WoW memory was getting Benediction in vanilla. It felt like such a huge accomplishment and helped me prove to myself that I really was good at the game. I still have it sitting in the bank on my original priest.
---
The old discord got deleted as it was expected (check to confirm). Can you switch it to the newer one so people know where to go (he kept deleting the link to it before deleting the discord so a lot of people never got the link). 
---
And if anyone is curious the guy running it - Lyko/Smygare (the same guy running Righteous orbs COD scams in Trade) deleted it after many unsuccessful attempts to make gold by owning the discord.
---
Hunter dont frost trap and healer priest dont mind control, when im tanking I dont expect neither of CC of any clases but when someone do it I clap and cheer for him for thinking out of the bubble.
---
Yes because retail problems came from asking for altering future patch release timing. Fucking what?
---
God damn u right, and I wouldn’t wanna stay healer so it wouldn’t be worth rolling on gear. I really just need spinal reaper lol
---
If you are still in battle stance after charging a pack of mobs and someone hits x instead of skull you don't have to switch stance to taunt it just use mocking blow.
---
Yeah you’re not playing the game a fun way. You’re grinding for gear that will be obsolete by the time you actually get it. Just quest and explore, especially if you only have 1-2 hours at a time to play. The only reason to grind a low level dungeon is for selling twink gear on the AH and xp
---
The excitement of login for the first time on my Tauren just to be happy to run all over Mulgore.
---
haha sorry! I didn't click it. Its midday Tuesday and im so focused on finish the day so I can go home and play some WoW lol
---
Also let's say there is a 1% chance to drop item X. This doesn't mean kill said mob 100 times and it will drop once. That's not how it works.
---
I'm new, sooo...
---
I guess unlocking travel form was cool
---
My favorite wow WoW memory is grinding SM Armory for days and days with my nightelf hunter which was my first character back then, just to get the full armor set and look like Herod the bad ass (including the tabard and ravager) and putting it on with lvl 40.  After some time i found out that most of those items arent actually good for a hunter and that i must have left a lot of warriors pissed of when i rolled on them, no regrets though :D
---
    /tm #
---
I don't remember which number corresponds to which mark.
---
Yeah I roll with a few stacks of greater mana pots, stam/spirit food, and a couple spirit scrolls for tougher spots.
---
When I was lvling my first char my friend irl was lvling a rogue. He would fucking flip shit if a hunter marked him. 
---
Now I'm lvling a hunter and I mark every rogue I see. Even if I don't intend to fight them, I just want them to know that I saw them. And if they plan on ganking me it'll cost them a cooldown.
---
If you think aoe farming as a mage is hard you should try swarm kiting as a Bard in EQ.  There's no iceblock to let things group up or any of that, just pulling all the mobs together can take 10 minutes of weaving around to make sure you don't aggro the wrong mobs.  Then during the kite if you get hit once you die, 10 minutes of near perfectly strafe kiting to keep the corner of an enemies hitbox within the corner of yours while staying out of their linear hit range.  So around .2 of a hitbox of margin of error  and you have to keep them within that range basically continuously to do dmg.
---
Mages aren't that hard, and their tool kit really isn't that extensive
---
Welcome to AITA: Classic WoW Edition.
---
NTA.  The game's supposed to be fun and that includes social interactions.  If you're not having fun, you should go do something in-or-out-of-game that is fun.  
---
In the future, it might be helpful to say something along the lines of "it's him or me.  get him under control or I'm out of here".  Otherwise, do you.
---
You're looking for something like [this](https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/13/drop-chance-probability/). 
---
The Drakestone supposedly has a 10% drop chance from each dragon. According to wowhead each Drakestone has a 3.3% chance to be "of shadow wrath". So each dragon has a droprate of 0.33% for the Drakestone of Shadow Wrath.
---
If you scroll to the bottom of the page I linked above and use 0.33% you can play around with the number of dragon kills for the likeliness that it'll have dropped. 
---
After 2030 kills the odds that it should've dropped by now are 99.87%. So yeah, that's some *real* shit luck (assuming the 10% for Drakestone and 3.3% for "of shadow wrath" are accurate).
---
That is ridiculous.
---
You can see how it works. I placed 3 totems: Strength of Earth, Grace of Air and Mana Spring Totem. I am in range with Mana Spring only.

Leveling engi with no mining is fine cause you just buy everything. But to be honest with you that robe pattern is not that great.. most casters will make their own robes with tailoring. You do know that Robe of the Archmage is bind on pickup? You would need to get tailoring on your mage to make it and the robe is best in slot till like phase 4.
---
After I started playing classic about 4 weeks ago, I had the itch to go look at my old pally and hunter main, it was nice to log into them and see them still in their WotLK raid gear just parked in stormwind, but one of my favorite things about logging back in was seeing that beautiful silver covenant hippogryph mount I had. I always wanted a hippogryph once flying mounts were introduced, and when they added in that one I was so happy I immediately farmed out that rep and bought it ASAP. I wish i could have a hippogryph as a regular ground mount in classic lmao
---
Yeah but the person who died took a snap chat of their screen then sent it to OP who screenshot Ted it and uploaded it to Reddit. So really he tried his best
---
Because the fireballs hit both so aggro reduction is split? It's super easy to just let pally grab him then we just threat race to take it back. But just keeps her from going after a healer or dps
---
Hahahaha spoken like someone who has never tanked a boss that wipes your threat. 
---
Pallies and shaman calling their threat nukes taunt is a fucking hilarious joke. Its a shield slam not a taunt.
---
You can tell none of these idiots understand the need for taunt on threar wipe bosses. 2000 threat is nothing mid way thru a boss fight after your threat is wiped. Not even comparable to taunt in any way.
---
Fair enough, I was an enh shammy using the WC quest staff at 32. Didn’t want to spend 7g on an AH item so I figured I could use that 2hander.
---
I will have to give that a try. Thanks for the advice!
---
That's not even a flex lol, they're just saying what they're going to go do..
---
Be nice to the 81 year old in your freshman class
---
always listen to the tank/healer (if they are being reasonable ofc), but i think that post was a bit too negative. maybe its a druid tank thing but when i do groups with my warrior tank friend, he doesnt mind the occasionally aggro steal with AoE, just don't make it a habit, be ready with either your cooldowns or be ready to run to the tank. its also always a good idea in just about any situation to wait a couple seconds to attack, tanks will appreciate it and notice it.
---
a good trick that a mage who me and my buddy group with a lot (we are tank/healer combo) is on big AoE pulls after waiting a sec for aggro he comes in and frost novas before blinking out and AoEing. so they are rooted before you hit them and even if you pull aggro off the tank they stay in place and are easier for the tank to get aggro back if needed.
---
Op is an exaggeration. Most sets are hybrid stats, so while good for pvp not so much pve.
---
You can set it up with the raid leader to have you summoned back after the first set of trash. Just put your hearth in Ratchet/Everlook/Astr. Then kill and loot the Hands during the raid. By the time you get the last hand your hearth is up and if they need the douse you can hearth to turn in and get it.
---
Nice for a video, but if running around in heavy rain gives you a headache here's the command to turn it down:
---
 /console weatherdensity 0 
---
Density value can be 0-3.
---
Make it feel like an adventure.
---
Ooof can’t wait. I’m 60 now, mostly pvping in EPL. I’ve won a few 1v2’s, and it’s been fun. I guess it’ll catch up to me soon enough. 
---
Off topic of the post, but what classes are great for pvp? The obvious answer is rouge, but other than that? I need an alt to level between raid nights lol.
---
Tank should always always be the one placing marks. You actually watch combat and will understand what is causing the most issues, while healers watch bars
---
&gt; requires less time
---
I guess that depends how you measure. You can probably upgrade your tier 0 to full tier 0.5 in a week or two. You won't be getting your full tier 1 in that time unless you are very lucky and have a guild passing you all the items.
---
yeah i mean enhance is going to take way more mana than ele typically. Most efficient way to enhance is to use your mana up front then regen-takes part of the appeal away tho so i get what u mean
---
This was another part I disagreed with, over 225 it’s 8 to 10 fish per level not 6
---
I transferred and my sever isn't dead. 
---
Why are you fear mongering?
---
I have to assume he just had a run with a bad priest or two and assumed it was a spec problem and not a competency problem.
---
Doesn't it completely prevent that strat if you int shout my pet and me though? If my pet is feared, nothing is stopping me from fd trapping you. I can just completely reset at this point. Other than that: Scatter, Imp Wing Clip, Counterattack.
---
Should I drop enchanting? I made it to 300 the first month of release, got all patterns beside molten core ones. I really want engineering but cant justify dropping skinning with the massive amount of gold I get from it.  Devilsaur pvp is the most fun I currently have in the game as well and is my entire motivation for wanting to pick up engineering. 
---
The problem is I having a huge sunken cost fallacy eating me alive, the money I make from enchanting pales in comparison to skinning.
---
Blacksmith lives matter
---
Possibly. But I would argue that the group wasn't formed properly or communicative enough about goals. Either you speedclear or not, and people should know what they are walking into so one part won't get angry because they don't get what they want
---
bene and rohk were super early, maybe not 1.0 but they were in game around the same time as dm
---
This is why you just wait for everyone else to roll before rolling need/greed on any item that is worth a substantial amount on AH.
---
That said, it's only a game, just pretend like it never dropped and move on, it's not even worth the trouble of posting about it here, really.
---
Also I will not sap. And mages I run with do not sheep unless the tank asks. You need to be ready for the kind of aggro that comes with a different class pulling... so I do not do unless told. Hardly ever have troubles. 
---
And rogues are usually not specced into improved sap tbh. So unless a tank is prepared right after pull to charge in and pull aggro you will end up being melee attacked right away unless you blow a CD in vanish
---
This sub and the forums are hilarious mage hate boners. It's very weird, considering how capable mages are at saving bad pulls and recovering if the tank dies.
---
Awesome very helpful stuff
---
You can always just start a new run instead of doing useless trash groups. I would never pull extra stuff as tank.
---
You are right that BWL weapons are far better, but BWL is some undetermined time next year, and I am currently tanking with a Timeworn Mace. I would totally prefer a Quel'Serrar, but that involves either getting very lucky on a DM drop, or farming up 1500-2000g (the current price on my server) for it. Considering I have Lionheart Helm to farm for (which costs around 1200-1300g), unless I get lucky and get a Compendium somehow, I'm going to go for a drop weapon.
---
Since I'm human, it will be a sword or a mace. There are no maces, so I am left with Viskag or Brut, and of those two, Brut is better. The difference is a few dps and the proc on Viskag vs strength agi and crit on Brut. Brut is hands down better for tanking, since weapon dps is actually quite low on the ladder of threat stats, regardless if you're deep prot or fury prot.
---
Now if you're arguing I should just keep using Timeworn Mace, or Mirah's, and wait for BWL for a weapon, I suppose I could, but it would suck to not get a weapon for so long (at least 6 months).
---
Yes charge is 30 yds,  hunter range is 40ish with talents.
---
Tanks geared first. Period end if story. Once the tank is geared then dps get to roll on it. Its plate with hit. You get first dibs. OT gets 2nd and lastly the dps assuming third tank is bear.

---
I went with the cheapest laptop with a dedicated video card.  Ended up getting an Acer Aspire 15 for ~$600 and have been really happy with it.
---
throw \[@mouseover\] in there.
---
They are misinformed. I've healed BRD and LBRS as shadow while leveling. I only respecced after hitting 60. As long as you know how to pre-cast your heals and have some mana pots you should be fine.
---
Omg focus frame, yes.
---
You can directly assign them in the key binds menu as well. I went with F1 -F5.
---
Thats if you ever get close to em
---
Don't be afraid to lead groups as a healer.  
---
I generally don't pug 5-mans (I'd rather level slowly than be frustrated) and my groups trust me.  It goes pretty well.
---
Honestly stay away from AH items until you have a toon at 60. It’ll cost too much and take away from your mount money, plus again, it’ll be obsolete very quickly.
---
Meanwhile mages get shat on for not giving out water, buffs, and portals on demand LUL. Kinda shitty huh?
---
That is definitely not what happened for me. I am very certain it was 1 level per 6 fish, regardless of the fish or location, up until at least 280
---
Thanks man, I’ll check those out. Yeah my lvl30 skills ate like 8g or something - that’s most of the problem right there!
---
Perfect response, feel the exact same!
---
420g, 69s, 66c
---
Thank you for doing this. We appreciate you.
---
Thick hide is additive. It’s great at the lower gear levels and can start to talent out of it as you get better ac. There is a reason it’s the first set of talents to go when adding some hybrid utility.
---
The solution is the group does /roll and he pays 'X' amount to the winner.
---
As long as no one else would use it.
---
This is done with 'fun' gear drops that arent upgrades and are just vendor gold for group.  You pay the winner an amount equal to vendor price.
---
The hunters on my realm need to learn their range, it’s dangerous to cast HM in a dead zone
---
Always loved tanking. Played tank on all my WoW stages and vanilla servers. It felt like Im the savior and guide for the grouo.
---
Here It feels like im babysitting road rage russian neckbeards
---
The fireballs reset(and it’s not to 0, i believe it’s -5000) your threat.
---
If you have a second tank stack on top of you, the lower threat person takes the threat reduction and she only fireballs the MT the entire time. She lands and runs right at the MT from p1
---
Totally trivializes the fight.
---
He’s gotten the shadow wrath with 20 dmg and just wants the perfect with 21 dmg or something
---
How is taking advantage of LOS an exploit?
---
It never ceases to amaze me how terrible some people make their UI
---
Yes cus all of them lvl 48’s running around with FAPs x)
---
Live in dungeons but do not spec prot while leveling. Nothing in leveling dungeons (or any dungeon) hits hard enough to need to be prot, all you accomplish is sacrificing threat generation so your dps will be pulling aggro more
---
The entire set is rarely good but all major dps classes have multiple pieces that are meta-defining if introduced too early.
---
Depending on the keyboard, just wash it under the faucet and let it dry for 3-4 days...
---
Well when phase two comes out there are no battlegrounds but you will still get rewarded on how many players you kill. So yea I will be riding around finding as many people as possible to kill. Not sure how else you would accomplish that but I'm open to ideas.
---
Considering I haven't spent the vast majority of my time since hitting 60 in Hillsbrad or Ashenvale camping lowbies, I'd say I already am.
---
if this was said to my vanilla hunter i'd reply with bring it.. my askandi will take 3/4 if not 99% of your health and my pet will eat the rest while i put distance.   enjoy the ice trap too.
---
I mean I'm not gonna spam trade chat or carry a grudge, I just thought the "my wife needs it" was pretty funny for how blatant a ninja it was.  You're right at the end of the day it's just game, and 80g or even 800g isn't something to let ruin your day.
---
Posted because it was funny, not to rage about.
---
OPs friend took a picture of WoW on his phone and posted it to snapchat, then OP screenshotted the snapchat.
---
Facts, he knows to roll need because otherwise he’d be the one paying for it anyway.
---
"Sorry my alt could really use it"
---
Then you see it on the AH lol...
---
Because they have been playing this crap for 10 years?
---
I think this is more likely an agro bug. I don't play a rogue but I have had several instances where a mob chansed me an ungodly long time without any continued attack of any kind.
---
Several times I just had to die because they wouldn't stop after I ran 1/4th the zone map to escape them.
---
Me and my friend leveling in felwood during TBC and killing enemy players with our lockadin combo.
---
Garb loot.   I already get picked on enough!
---
There is something nice about the organic situations that arise as you're playing. Actually, one of my favourite things to happen so far is that someone will message me around midnight, just as I'm getting ready to log off, to tank for a dungeon. I usually need a quest from it, so I've said yes every time. I end up playing for two more hours than I intended and having a great time, simply because someone reached out for a tank. I don't play retail, but my impression is that such connections don't form in the same way.
---
That first paragraph is so real. When the dps realize how to control their threat, everyone wins.
---
I also agree with your 3rd paragraph, Black Lotus hunting turned into me getting hunted, so I've moved to DM:E Jumps with a couple guild members. 
---
I've considered 30/0/21, just for some survivability in the open world.
---
Going to tell you something that might be a little dissapointing... dungeons at 60 are so easy they do not require tank gear.
---
You are much better off building a fury set and just collecting plate items to replace your leather BIS so you at least have armor and of course a shield. If you have decent crit chance you can tank with a full dps fury raid spec, if you don't have decent crit chance threat might be an issue.
---
It all depends on weather you want to tank in raids or not.
---
Lmao no, they
---
I tell people if they want to jump in discord and we can actually coordinate in real time then we can do the fancy stuff. Otherwise it's just easier to kill the trash.
---
Maybe you shouldn't quest as a resto druid...that's the entire point - you are good at some things but bad at others.
---
Any prediction on what boss will be the PUG ender? Vael? Twin emps?
---
It's a second taunt, basically. If your taunt gets resisted, you switch to battle stance, mocking blow, then switch back to defensive and try to gain enough threat to keep the mob on you, or taunt again.
---
For my server people roll need on all boe items, especially the ones that have a high price. Last night the truefaith vestment pattern dropped from strat live, after so many runs..I'm the priest. I healed. I lost the roll. Was pretty upset but then that's the rule everyone accepts.
---
Hunters are like a walking potato for me, maybe I never met a decent one in classic in my 20 days played.
---
Middle of the afternoon on a weekday? really? Show it at 7pm or the middle of the afternoon on a weekend....
---
He’s family bro
---
Should have asked to buy it for 5-10g on the spot haha
---
Rogue is actually a pretty slow leveler since they lacks any sort of sustain. All you got is food and bandages
---
Lmao dumb rogue cant understand what I wrote. Nobody wants 30 rogues in their raid, which is the byproduct of being a overpopulated class. Also mage tops rogue in dps easily, another fail.
---
no, force reactive disk breaks easily, 50% chance to lose 1 durability everytime you block.
---
Shoulda sent him a message after you finished "How much faster was your strategy?"
---
It's funny how every time this is mentioned there are people who hear it for the first time. :)
---
You could transfer off.
---
https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dnd81u/i_changed_all_the_fonts_in_my_game_to_comic_sans/
---
I get what you're trying to say but comparing dungeon mobs to raid bosses probably makes your argument weaker because of the discrepancy.
---
Does that with through stealth
---
I wouldn’t say so. I bought a blue bow at 20 and 34 and a blue axe at 34 as well. Everything else is green gear replaced every 10-13 levels or so.
---
I'll update it.
---
Haha ye but that’s troubling tbh, are there no transfers available? Usually when pop gets really low it turns out that way, perhaps a ticket could help you? I mean you can’t solo dungeons and you want a proper experience in levelling not being forced to skip parts of the game cause you picked a quiet server
---
Not at all. This wasn't done using common core.
---
This is already the case for some of the loot table changes, why not this?
---
Probably more to the story. Also a lot of Diva tanks in here.
---
People in here make it sound like the moment they find some minor slight they will just dip on a group. I can't imagine this mentality. I've never left a group and never failed a run. Dungeons just aren't that hard.
---
Worst case scenario for a tank is having to chase mobs that get aggroed and most tanks I see won't even do that, even when the healer is the one drawing the aggro.
---
Pretty sure green shoulders are second only only to Truestrike for DPS Warriors.
---
I have been mage farming DMN dogs and bugs for the last week and havent had any issues like you’re describing here. I ledge run, Ice Block, then Nova as I leave IB and jump off. Follow up with 4 Blizzards and an AE and theyre all dead. The dogs always get hit evenly by my Blizzard ticks and I don’t run into any issues with spell batching causing some to run thru without getting slowed. 
---
It’s best to look at the circle underneath the dogs as they run and not the model of the dog itself as that can be very deceptive. The ledge pathing is weird so it appears that some dogs are in front when in reality they are all stacked on one another. If you aim your Blizzard for the model of the dogs in front you’ll actually miss them so just look for the circle indicator when you select a mob.
---
I got a friend with me at all times. 
---
He only gets a lil upset when he dies
---
"I sent you my dick pic and some money, can I be your sugar daddy?"
---
You didn't perform 1,000 or more ST runs to get your marginally better off-hand?
---
No commitment = no loot council circle jerk for you
---
The first time I ran it, it was really close, but it turned out it was tanked incorrectly (Too close to the ranged). We still managed to down him although i was full panic.
---
Every other time, we burned right through it.
---
that is awesome! thanks
---
Is this in the current phase or later? I thought it was coming out later?
---
Yah I looove the mounts and pets you can get in retail. I've been slowly but steadily farming for a number of them for quite a while. 
---
I also really love Classic for just really experiencing the world. 
---
Both are great imo. I don't want Classic to be accelerated for the asks that already exist in retail. I want it to be a true emulation of the original experience so I can enjoy it all. In retail I stopped caring other than my pet/mount acquisition because everything ended up being meaningless. There's no reason to push Classic to that state asap. Like.. I still have multiple free whatever level characters I could make but never will because you don't care about your character that way
---
Personal preference.
---
It’s still not nearly as good as arms imo. If you want to it’s viable but easier to just coast off of WW axe
---
Does it matter? 
---
I've seen almost tradeables worth 30g or more drop in BRD and up. Every single time, everyone /needed, didn't bitch and moan, and moved on.
---
If you aren't 60 yet, you'll find out that that's the default. Or you'll get ninjad, and realize that pretending BoEs are BoPs is silly
---
Hunters smoke rogues in a fair fight
---
What do you mean by every class has a CC? Isn’t that the same in classic?
---
You can tank perfectly fine in Arms or Fury when levelling in dungeons. Gear (Shield) is vastly more important than spec pre-raiding. Even at level 60 I see full DPS specs tank dungeons provided they have stamina gear and a shield.
---
Respeccing is the opposite of a big deal. Levelling spec is not the same as DPS spec is not the same as Raid tanking spec is not the same as PVP spec.
---
ice block my man
---
What a lot of people don't always understand is that speed usually relies more on healers and dps than it does tanks.  Tanks pull when the mana users have enough mana to get through the fight.
---
Healers can help things move faster by only using as much mana as they need and setting themselves up for the next pull before drinking.  If they're set up in range of the next pull, I can pull when they are at enough mana to top off by the time I need heals.  If they're parked behind the previous pack, I have to wait for them to get a full bar and run to me.  DPS with mana can do the same thing... those without can manage aggro properly to avoid eating extra heals.
---
I tank a lot of instances and the same instance can often take 1/2 the time by only changing out the healer or melee dps who hits the wrong target constantly.
---
Vanish!!! You never die!! (I know u do but way less)
---
No, that's a different "resist" from resistance-based resists.  It just unfortunately uses the same word. That's why most sources present it as "hit or miss."  Resistance-resists are a separate roll, because some spells have partial resists and (I'm fairly sure) you can resist/partially resist a crit.
---
That makes this even funnier, I don't know where these tanks come from or how they learned to play the game. I am sorry you experienced that.
---
Is it though? Or is it just not part of the optimal "raid spec" that everyone is following from guides?
---
31/0/20 is such an enjoyable hybrid. 
---
Heal 5 man's with ease. Maybe a 15s greater mana potion to get by the final boss fight at most. 
---
Flexibility to heal or dps and even both. For early easy mob packs the group is 4dps and a tank
---
Thank you, friend. You've just reminded me that on my way home I need to stop at the liquor store.
---
Oh, I was talking about the people at the 7-11.
---
Devilsaur gives me 2% hit ,74 attack power, and 2%crit
---
Voone’s gives me 2%hit and a negligible amount of armor.  
---
Can you point me to another pre raid pair of pants that will give me 74 attack power and 2% crit?
---
I’ll be waiting.
---
are ghost mushroom/elixir of shadow power still that price even after DM came out? they halved in price on my server after a couple of days of people being able to get ghost mushroom there.
---
to answer your question i am in the same exact profession/class position and plan to drop my tailoring for herbalism and try solo DM jump runs. that said im on a PvP server so was going to drop the tailor for engi at some point anyways. if you don't want to drop tailoring as it seems you don't i would think not (at least short term). not sure how long it would take to level herb to 300 but if you look at the opportunity cost of that time and what you would have made instead mara farming the difference between the two would have to be pretty significant or you plan on doing a ton of runs for it to be worth.
---
Your shit talks means little when your stun locked
---
I've been playing both simultaneously for the majority of the time.  I know it's pretty try-hard of me, but it's really easy to do things like AFK fishing or WC while playing WoW on another screen.  At the very least I've been doing my farm runs a couple times a day.
---
I dunno if people are still looking at this, but he's right. What you have to be looking at in his video is the amount healed. A big thank you to all of the people who brought this to my attention. I'm so sad the inflated numbers are not my actual numbers. Q\_Q
---
Yeah, my bank alt
---
No clue how we messed up 10x with the 1st one :P
---
That would require them all to be standing within range, which wouldn’t normally happen on a boss fight.
---
I have several opinions that will really piss off the #nochanges crowd, as well.  My most inflammatory one is below.
---
In addition to the two you mentioned above, we ought to talk about a change how the Rank 14 grind works... It was not originally anticipated that WoW would be as popular as it got, and this system was not designed for servers with multiple thousands of max level players on a single faction.  The idea that you have an arbitrary honor decay each week is nonsense, and worse, the idea that you don't actually know what a set amount of effort will yield is equally ludicrous.  Rank 14 should be achievable by anyone with the dedication to do it, but it should not be *only* achievable through either account sharing or a ludicrously unhealthy and unsustainable lifestyle due to the stack-ranking nature of the system.  
---
I fully expect to get buried for this comment, but I just think that there is a difference between "dedication" and "insane, unhealthy behavior".  People that grind to Gladiator in retail can do that playing a high amount, but still reasonable for a highly dedicated person.  That same time dedication to the game would never be competitive for Rank 14.  PvP should be about skill, and there is no skill associated with 20+ hours *per day* of playtime.
---
I also think that meeting stones should be turned on so people can use them to summon, and that warlocks ought to be able to summon people into an instance.
---
None of these changes detract from a sense of community, just like having animated shadows in Classic as opposed to blob shadows in Vanilla doesn't.  Rank 14 should be prestigious, and require skill and dedication, but it should not be a stack-ranking situation that has and will quite literally kill actual human beings, and I value a single human life over keeping the #nochanges zealots happy about a PvP system that they may or may not ever actually engage with.
---
You're mixing up Mooncloth Bags and Bottomless bags.
---
no longer necessary  **≠**  optimal
---
^^^ THIS ^^^
---
Is a great rule of thumb :P
---
Fair enough
---
Classic rep grinds basic enchants. You want that?
---
I understand how you feel. I’m married now and am a full time college student so I get strapped for time as well.
---
Ha, because vanish + stun lock begs to differ
---
&gt;Phase 2 is gonna be awesome.
---
Phase 2 is going to outright kill most PvP servers.
---
&gt; Spells can hit, but only deal partial damage
---
Some spells. Others, e.g. frostbolt, are hit-or-resist, no partials.
---
&gt; enemy resistance which is what this talent can reduce
---
True, but only on mobs that have resistance over the base level-difference resist floor.
---
Since you have the cash flow, you can easily keep your weapons up to date. Heavy hitting one handers will make your SS hit like a truck
---
Just add him to the blacklist.  Shameless self ninja right there
---
And then you get murdered right afterwards
---
I do love that third bear tank. He's excited to be here, and he doesn't take any of my loot.
---
Yeah, it's silly that he'd even bother bringing it up, especially after rolling.
---
Had the guy asked me in party chat if I was ok with him needing for an alt, or his wife, I probably would've said yes, but the fact that he brings it up after is BS...
---
You can ask the developer on Discord: [https://discord.gg/vMUwzPc](https://discord.gg/vMUwzPc)
---
On wowhead, How are their numbers derived?  does it give the calculations or sample size they used to determine their percentages?
---
Pretty much ye
---
Here's a more interesting situation:
---
I had a tank invite me for Strat Live, "Orbs Reserved". I only need the neck, so whatever, I don't mind. It's not nice, but OK, mutual benefit. I get the neck, he gets the orbs.
---
Into the run we go, and at the point, I ask if anyone needs anything from Canoneer. Turns out, nobody does. I ask if we can continue and dude expects us to clear the rest of it, so that's like 10 minutes - ie. 40 minutes of time wasted for other players just so he can farm extra orbs (already received two).
---
At this point, I tell him, that I will also need on orbs in this wing, because we are not there to do his bidding so he can get gold. Dude leaves.
---
So I encourage our group to continue run and we finished. 3 more orbs dropped, recepie for truefaith and I got my neck. Best decision ever.
---
Fuck greedy shits.
---
My head hurts now.
---
I don't understand how people are downvoting you. You're right, this is a high threat ability to spam, but it will never put you to the top of the threat table like a true taunt does.
---
Sure, you could use it as a taunt if you're staring at threat meters and hovering threat just below the main tank, then use this to jump threat... But you still need to be close in threat. 
---
As a warrior or druid, you can sit in a fight andndo nothing, press taunt and now you're the tank. Can't do that with a paladin.
---
Figured it out. Turns out there's a not-popularly-known bug with the spiritual guidance talent.
---
ring?  It's an offhand.
---
This is inside BRD (an instance) so that wouldn't really apply here as the mobs would never drop aggro without a major pathing / ledge bug, vanish, FD, etc.
---
Sometimes hunters accidentally pull a second group, but the only people I ever see actively pulling before the tank are mages. 
---
It's funny cause they're the squishiest of classes and die immediately. As a priest, I have rezzed my share of overeager mages during leveling.
---
Amateur, i have 9 and need for all of them.
---
I play the auctioneer class.
---
Fun fact, as I found out recently, so does my Runeblade of Baron Rivendare - it’s supposed to give a base 20 Hp5, but in my full healing set on my Paladin it gives nearly 300 Hp5
---
I'm leveling an alt this way with my mage and its working pretty well.
---
I started DM at lvl 15 and I'm getting \~28k exp/h. This is clearly the whole instance in 12 minutes, which you might only be able to do on certain classes (mage/pally/priest).
---
You seem to get more exp as your alt approaches the level of the mobs you're killing. I'm not sure if adding another player increases the speed, except it'll probably make it harder to get 5 resets in.
---
This is why world pvp is so much fun. We had a guildie get ganked while farming and asked a couple of us to help him. Fast forward 15 minutes we had a full 15v15 battle for the next 1-2 hours.
---
Is that a way to show the key binds on all bars.  It's shows the keybind text on the main standard bar but can't see to find to show up on the extra bars
---
Don't blur the name, let us all see who this ninja is so his rep can be fucked.  Classic rep kinda matters given how much time and effort it takes to get a group going.
---
I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure it's based on user-generated / self-reported data. So I always take wowhead droprates with a grain of salt.
---
r/whooosh
---
16 slots. But you can just buy those. And all the gear for your lower level is all tradable. Tailoring just not that great of a skill because its sooooooo common. Every caster gets it for their robe so it's really hard to make any money from it besides your mooncloth cooldown and maybe a couple of extremely rare patterns.
---
As a dps, I feel most alive on the verge of death though
---
So easy to avoid and even if you don't, you can just intercept immediately after and hamstring again
---
Why westfall? You think it would try to stick you near the main capital or something.
---
Either weapon chain or get death grips.
---
It's not about your consecrate damage, it's about adding healing to skull flame and .7 of it to demonforged.
---
As long as you know you look like a douchebag.
---
My job is finished.
---
How have I never seen that in over 14 years!
---
I'll sap solo fairly often...say when I'm going after a chest that's got a handful of mobs around it.  It seems to last the duration...but I was personally breaking it often 'cause of that Fire enchant from the Bandlands quest (quickly learned about better positioning!)
---
In groups I'll offer to when I see a situation where it would be useful but it's rare that the tank says "go for it".  I sure as hell ain't gonna sap without discussing it with the group 'cause it breaks stealth.
---
Sheep...again it seems to depend on the group.
---
I like you already. I get so much hate for being a spriest, even on here people are like you hurt your raid. Yep my mc raid that takes 90 minutes to complete where locks are our number 1 dps I hurt. I love it when they find out anathema was given to me 2nd out of 5 priests.  
---
  When you play a spec you enjoy the game is amazing, being forced into a spec to play is super boring. I also feel like a lot of those people create mages and will be quitting soon because mages aren't as fun as people think in p1. I would love to see a census of mages at the start and end of p1. I know quite a few people who reroll but those who stick are going to have fun with fire.
---
Right, because our guild wasn't fractured enough by the pre-launch server fuckery that Blizzard caused ("Here are the servers, P.S. GET THE FUCK OFF THOSE SERVERS!"). Now let's splinter our guild even more by transferring!
---
Like in WotLK there was gear, shoulder enchants, and mounts at higher rep with different factions. Those kinds of things I'd be ok with, but having several races gated sucks to me.
---
Everybody needs gold. Everyone needs it equally. They can all trade it for the same amount of gold.
---
If the person REALLY needs that gear, they can simply buy it. It's a BoE. Everybody gets a fair 20% chance to get a windfall of gold that they can use to buy other BoEs. Or an epic mount to get them to instances faster to help the group start earlier.
---
And of course it's semantics. For some reason, you don't seem to think everyone needs gold equally. Strange how you get to decide that for everyone else.
---
Just because I can equip and use a Warden staff doesn't mean I get to deny the other 4 members their chance at a gold windfall that they can use to buy BoEs. Because I'm not greedy.
---
Not really such a thing as a fair fight when rogue is concerned, you initiate and keep rogue out of stealth you just made an unfair fight for him because half his toolkit is unavailable to him, he initiates fight it's unfair because of his toolkit from stealth.
---
My opinion: you should always use a shield when tanking. Stamina is the only "tanking" stat that matters pre-60, and even then you should always prioritize DPS gear pre-60 as it will all be replaced when you hit max level. BRD/BRS/Strat/Scholo is when you should start looking at what is actually good tanking gear.
---
I like zone scaling. I can do the quests that I want.
---
My approach has been - if a BoE drops and I trust the group, and I see everyone greeding, I greed and let the person who needs it need. 
---
But when I don't trust the group and I see people needing on it or there was a ninja need earlier on a lower-value item - I need and then give it to the person who needs it. I know they can't trust me, but I trust myself and I try to do the right thing.
---
IIRC it receives full scaling with spell power, just like Skullflame Shield.
---
In elder scrolls it's pretty effective, but i've not played retail after it was introduced.
---
You truly don’t know wtf you’re talking about sorry
---
A shit ton of people that played in 2004-2007 are in their 30s/40s. It's not some crazy concept to think that he does.
---
Best spell in the game. Heals, fears and damages. Might as wel Alt+F4 once you get hit with one.
---
EM isn't instant and only applies to damaging spells, just swap it for NS 30/0/21
---
Energy ticker is always a good choice.
---
FURY WARRIORS: While leveling, should I get Tactical Mastersy asap (in order to be able to stance dance, especially if I tank some dungeons) and then go down the fury tree or should I aim to get Bloodthirst at 40? Thank you
---
It's a cheap, extremely powerful level 20 potion lol...I have had at least a stack in my inventory at all times since about level 28. Makes rogue vs. hunter/mage a lot easier.
---
No, but Holy does
---
Good idea. It just confuses me that people think everyone they play with gives a shit about their wives/babies/etc like literally almost every group I go in a dungeon with there’s that one guy saying something about how his baby is acting up or how his wife needs him to do something so the run has to be fast etc etc
---
/u/DreamtimeMemetime is correct. 
---
I'll add on one more useful thing. While taunt has no effect if the target is already attacking you, mocking blow forces the enemy to attack you for 6 seconds, regardless if you have aggro or not. You can proactively use it to keep aggro on a mob you think you're going to lose soon.
---
Some situations this is useful in: You're tanking skull while the DPS hammers it, but then the X or a patrol runs off to attack your healer. You can mocking blow the skull to make sure it keeps hitting you while you intercept/run back to pull the add off your healer.
---
One more situation I use this in to make my life easier is I'll mark the primary, secondary, and tertiary kill targets. The primary usually goes down so fast, that after I pull I'll just mocking blow the primary and switch to building threat on the secondary and tertiary. The primary is usually dead within the 6 seconds or shortly after, so mocking alone is enough to tank it, and I've got a good pool of threat ready on the secondary and tertiary.
---
I started in TBC a couple months before WoTLK came out with my dad when I was in 7th grade. Once wrath came out I made a death knight and it was the coolest thing ever, until I bragged about it to my friends and they called me a nerd for playing WoW so I quit.. My favorite WoW memory is when I started dating my fiancée in 2014 and she told me she played WoW and wanted me to play with her! We've been playing together ever since.
---
That's what I'm saying though. Even in retail an "upgrade" feels like a sidegrade. Horizontal Progression would be a means of unlocking items with unique abilities but NOT set behind RNG such as the Legendary systems that were in place. Or choose to build your character in a way that fits your playstyle by adding various new ways to play in the playstyle. 
---
There has to be a new way to play to keep the game fresh and interesting. Titanforging and Daily Quests everyday to increase your power level is not fun or intuitive game design.

Yes, grounding totem will 100% take the sacrifice
---
I would find a new guild... a guild run in which they let a resto Druid roll on hoj. What??If I did that on my Druid I wouldn’t be surprised if I got booted.
---
No...  wasn’t intending on it really - was just trying to get my first few quests done (Marshall Windsor, etc...).  I was a 56 Warlock and our healer was a 54 Pally.  Everyone else was 53 or below - I found them looking for one more DPS in LFG.
---
We did 2-3 bosses.  Arena and two others from memory.  I’ll give it another shot tomorrow or tonight - five bubbles from 57 now.
---
I believe it was patch 1.12 actually!
---
So I can roll need for my entire family in that case. BOE or not i have x family member to need it for lol. Unless he has 40 family members who play he aint gonna last long on his server.
---
I'm not expert, and I'm at work and haven't checked, but I don't think you can throw anything into the menu options in the keybind menu?
---
This just in boys, Kromcrush is officially dead! u/Snowjob_tv has declared it to be so! The "Full" status, login queues, and hundreds of players in major cities are all a lie!
---
Coming from a man who just bought his wife a mount. Truer words have not been spoke.
---
Very good advice. I've read about Ex. Cleaver but not sure about buying it at this point. Thank you for the advice my friend.
---
My favorite memories were late night Karazhan runs with my RL friends back in high school...
---
Nope, I am fury dps and have onslaught too :)
---
Gear is going to make a bigger difference than spec when it comes to doing different roles, so make sure you build a gearset that compliments what you're after and thats 80% of the work needed to solo/quest/whatever.
---
&gt; Can I raid heal effectively with HOTW/NS?
---
In phase 1 you can operate at 100% efficacy with that spec. By phase 3 you will no longer really be optimizing, but can still probably sneak by with it.
---
It took me over 4 hours last night to do mining from 250-265.   I am so glad the rest of my mining will all be instanced.
---
Caster form is no form. Boom kin is balance only which has the bonus armor, so no that is incorrect
---
yeah the dps doing less damage than the tank is performing his role too, hes also probably slowing the run down LESS than the tank whos taking forever to pull.
---
lmao ok whatever, you picked 2 of the lowest pop times to post, take your sob story elsewhere
---
Too broad of a generalization
---
Oh I'm sure a few wow Ayers have wives.  But my point was that is he is clearly stealing it to sell for himself.
---
Why would the logic carry over?
---
1. BoPs aren't worth the same to everyone. They must drop from the instance - there's time value in farming it. BoE's just randomly drop wherever - you don't need a grp for them
---
2. If everyone needed all BoPs, people wouldn't gear up. It hurts you, and you lose something that you'd probably even be willing to pay the gold vendor cost for. When everyone /needs a BOE, nobody loses anything. Somebody gets a windfall, and those who could equip it can always buy it on the AH. 
---
3. When you are questing solo, and a purple BOE drops, you have choice in what to do with it. Even if it's an upgrade, you might want to sell it to get an epic mount faster. In a group setting, the winner of a fair roll doesn't get the item, but the choice too. It's their right to barter, gift, sell, AH, save, equip as they see fit.
---
Mandating you treat them as BoPs and opening yourself up to problems for no reason is silly.
---
Wow, felt good to dismantle that
---
your interesting is different than mine.
---
You share your own views. The world does not.
---
That's the order I went, as a Priest, too.
---
All you miss is the Gadgetzan teleporter and World Enlarger, which require Gnomish Engineering to use, you get to keep and use everything else.
---
I'm all for the Need rolls on expensive BOE's, but the priest book sometimes goes for like 25-40g. I'm not need rolling on that over a priest in group that needs it.
---
2 manning war/sham is entirely easy. The biggest trick is ledge exploit. Where the bosses run back and forth. There’s some videos on it.
---
I said kiss for me, not for yourself.
---
Naturally. I bet she's with her boyfriend right now.
---
heck, if people back then could do it with 40 priest, you can do it with 40 paladins
---
I feel most alive when I have all 4 mobs in a 4 mob pack hitting me and I have a steady age income, and the Dps are all killing the same target instead of splitting themselves up across the pack and individually ripping aggro.
---
But whatever floats your boat my guy
---
Yeah that sounds good. What's your kick cool down? I need to learn that and practice juking it I think. Sometimes I start the fight really well but then once they get on me it can be rough. Live and die by fear luck. Or at least gets way closer than it should have been.
---
Yes, also true for Blackout - it can proc only on the initial cast.
---
I have been looking for a calculator like that for _AGES_. Thank you for posting it.
---
We killed domo the next night?
---
Macro alt/shift/Ctrl modifiers, 4 abilities in one action bar slot. also mouseover heal/shock macros
---
Is this the new version of the "The real Dark Souls hasn't begun yet" meme?
---
Ghost mushroom went up in price after DM hit on my server. You'll be lucky to find it at 1g per. I'm assuming a player here is controlling the market.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000
---
lol another fail from the rogue (how surprising), even warrior dps blows you out of the water. Enjoy ur shitty class bud.
---
That's my point. DPS think they can get away with it because the group probably won't wipe, and only 4 people will hate them instead of 39. Either way don't sign up for group content if you don't want to focus on the group's success.
---
That's a shitty rule. When clearly shitty people do obviously shitty things, shit should be done about it. 
---
I know if this were in my server I would want to know who to avoid. There are waaay more legitimate shitheels like this than there are false witch-hunts I'm sure.
---
So it works like normal 1.12 priority macros. This already helps a lot. Thanks mate.
---
For that, you get a \*hug\*
---
Wetlands, in between Direforge Hill and Raptor Ridge.  Crimson and Red Whelps drop it.
---
Dont blame blizzard lol.
---
He's definitely stealing it, but you have no way of knowing if he's actually giving it to someone else unless u see it up on the AH or in trade chat.
---
Is there a more competitive wow classic subreddit? I'm looking for more endgame gear discussions and what not.
---
thats my point, yes
---
Nothing wrong here. You're the tank, you set the speed.
---
My apologies, the offhand then, is it a stark difference from next best or just a bit better? Just trying to see why so much dedication to it.
---
1,000 runs man... I can't even.
---
O ya sure let me ditch all of my friends and go play with nobody over in some podunk refugee camp
---
Cool thanks.
---
This. Or check out joanas leveling guide for horde. I believe you can see where he goes at certain levels for free.
---
Depends on if you're swords or daggers.
---
For Swords go crusader on both, Daggers superior on MH crusader on OH.
---
Crusader procs quite often, and if you have two of them, they proc separately and the procs stack.
---
It is not...
---
Not to be mean, but they tell you when they are going to be down for regular maintenance all over the launcher, game screen and all over social media. I mean does it hurt to know this? They have had scheduled maintenance since 2004.
---
shift 1 2 3
---
and alt 1 2 3 for weapon sets.
---
Of the monkey is good too
---
Yeah [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55003105230015--2503500000501) is what I'm considering switching too. Have you tried both?
---
I’m new to WoW, and I’m not sure if I want to participate in PVP when I hit 60 or not. I think making a “twink” could potentially be fun, similar to pures on RuneScape. (I rolled on a PVP server because I had friends on the server. Personally I find the concept of getting killed while I’m minding my own business to be pretty annoying) 
---
I definitely don’t see myself joining a raiding guild though. I’m not going to dedicate two evenings of my life to a video game that I might not even have time for or be in the mood to play. Sure I’ll try pick up groups for raids, but I hear that often ends poorly. Mostly I’m just enjoying leveling and exploring new areas/dungeons at the moment!
---
Using CC is not a noob tactic. Using CC when not needed is a noob tactic
---
Daggers. Solid response. Thanks you, homie.
---
&gt;So why do you think your first guild raid, where you didnt even kill domo and by your own admission you died countless times, is an example of arms spec working in raid?
---
Damn.! That reminds me he is behind on rent.
---
Your assuming all those people are gonna be out doing world PvP for honor. Theyre not. Lots of players dont give a damn about honor/ranks and just wanna gank/grief.
---
Just like my driving instructor said
---
its still dead
---
Not really. If you have a raider who shows up to every raid and does well in damage and a raider who shows up every other week and is mediocre. The raider who shows up has his pre-raid bis and the other has some dungeon blue. Of course the bigger upgrade is for the other guy since he has some random blue. But the question you have to ask yourself is what is best for the guild. And 10/10 times you give that to your dedicated raider
---
Favorite memories was the AQ opening on a wednesday at 2am.  Guild basically set it up to trick the whole server!
---
100%.  I remember when Burning Crusade launched.  I had been dating my wife for about a month.  I was in college and went into the mall to Gamestop on launch night to get in line.  It was at that point she realized how big of a game WoW was.  They waited with me and even through the addiction we ended up married.  
---
11 years and our first child due in early December.
---
Ayyy same here lol
---
I'm sorry but how exactly is this relevant to the topic?
---
Salty AS fuck lmfao. You definitely someone who has their prebis list opened on your second monitor 24/7 sweating when you're in a dungeon waiting for your next drop like a tiny piece of crack being dangled in front of your face lmfao I feel for you man truly. You right it wasn't a perfect situation and yeah I died a lot BUT ITS FUCKING DOABLE :)
---
That's why everyone should need on items like this.
---
You can take your belittling bs and cram it. There are piles of evidence over on the bug forums that pertain to this craptastic batching issues.
---
I was talking to my friend while random grinding. I complained that I havent hat a BOE or rare item drop while he has had like 5 in the same time. Next mob dropped one. Haven't seen one since.
---
Idk why people are so fucking stuck on ONLY WORLD PVP anyway. the shit gets fucking old after awhile. BG's are the only reason i play this game. fuck your world pvp
---
I saw someone doing this in trade recently not sure if it worked
---
One caveat I'll mention here is alchemy. You do have to spend a small amount of upfront cost leveling it (you can resell the potions to recoup most of the cost), but no rare recipes are required to start churning out arcanite transmutes every 2 days. It's a super easy 5-10+ gold every couple of days, depending on arcanite prices on your server.
---
Yeah engineering is absolutely massive and I would even say necessary if you are a PvP focused player. If you are going to be at devilsaurs then for sure keep skinning. Personally I would drop the enchanting. I'm just not a fan of the playstyle. I like to go out and play the game. To make any real money from it you have to spend a lot of time afk spamming in chat and even then you wont get big tips unless you have some of the more rare patterns.
---
Do you mean that u wanna get fucked by lock boxes but that you want foreplay? I’m very confused 
---
Because that’s what girls wants on tinder
---
There is an unspoken rule that you don’t mess with the innocent fishermen. The horde usually disregard this
---
Try Opie addon
---
Are the mages good at kiting and cc Where needed?
---
If not then they should tone down. 
---
If yes then it sounds like a personality difference.
---
Not sure about other subreddits but there are a ton of discords who focus on discussion. You can probably find one specific to your realm/class/role.
---
Next best would probably be Spirit of Aquementas which you get from a pretty simple (but long) questline around Kalimdor. It give +20 spell damage. Drakestone of Shadow Wrath gives you +28. So he's run ST over 1,000 times for 8 more shadow damage.
---
i emphasize you and actually feel sorry.
---
Thats fine
---
This is correct. No need to respec til high 50s or 60. Decent gear and you can tank any normal 5 man
---
I would say it's even more appropriate, as it would be pretty clear if you called him a "young chef" that you were talking about his experience as a chef, and obviously not his age.
---
“You spank it you tank it!”
---
To be completely fair you were needing for off spec and he was needing for an upgrade. Though your points are valid that the mage will get another upgrade quickly, you were still doing an off spec roll
---
You call them an asshole for ninjaing - PM their guild leader if you can find them (sometimes they care) and you black list that asshole.
---
ya, usually if someone asks I just roll my eyes and it's easier to just say "sure" than to fight them. If they do it afterwards I'm gonna call them on it and say they should at least kick back some gold to the group since we're gifting them an item they'd be spending gold on later.
---
it's all about your crits and axe specilization is OP, therefore you should always look for axes and think of them as every axe has "increases chance to crit by %5" buff on it
---
your next upgrade should be dreadforge retaliator from emperor in BRD that is a very nice weapon
---
But release corpse times out after 6 mins...
---
 Congratulations!
---
skinning is practically mandatory, it makes grinding beast mobs insanely profitable in terms of XP/HR and making extra money. Depending on your plans at 60 you can take mining to stock up on materials and then switch to engineering while leveling, but this will hurt your bag space which is already reduced as a hunter
---
The population of warlocks has really died off in the upper 40s for me.  Last 4-5 groups I've been in haven't had one.  Not sure if that's just random though.
---
In original Classic and BC i used my brothers hunter to power lvl my account and characters. so 60-70 hunter running ZF for my 1 char. and then later my paladin cuss i saw a hobs video. PLing my chars through SM. Have they still allowed that? where even if you have a 60 running you through a dungeon if it is just you you get crazy exp???
---
And flying!!!  Now that everyone has flying and I don't, and I know I'm weeks of grinding mindless stupid quests away from getting it, it makes me not want to play at all.
---
Lol only the current phase is relavent. We don't even know when the other phases will be introduced. Warlock is just one instance. As a warrior, you should lose the majority of match ups unless the person you are fighting is bad or poorly geared.
---
&gt;Disagree, everything is measurable in terms of value, and that value is measured in cold hard gold.  
---
Then push the gold coin button when it drops.
---
I only went for the Net-o-Matic, Death Ray and Battle Chicken.
---
I figure we don't need the Mind Control Cap as Priests and can't use the Shield Belt since it's Leather.
---
Also, the Gnomish version of the Rocket Boots has a longer CD than the Goblin's one, so I skipped that too, but you could still use both, I guess, by swapping them when one is on CD.
---
Some of that stress is part of it, but don't let it get you down. The exciting part about it is that its a game/activity you care about enough to want to get better. You just learn things as you go. Surround yourself with players that make you feel welcome and comfortable, ignore the ones that don't. Take the game at your own pace, look up the things you are curious about online, but otherwise just take the ride at face value. 
---
Even in it's classic form, World of Warcraft is a huge game with so much content to enjoy. Sure, there's right and wrong way to do certain things in a dungeon or when dealing with item drops etc, but really the only way to learn that stuff first-hand is to do it.
---
&gt; if the stats I read about are correct, would increase the weapons dps by 7 (14ap=1dps was the equation I read).
---
Be careful with thinking about things in this way. That's paper dps. In the grand scheme of things crusader, especially proc'd at the right time, can easily add 50 dps.
---
With +5 weapon damage, that's added to the backstab calculation, and since backstab also crits a lot you'll end up getting more out of it.
---
You mean EPL? There’s no black lotus spawns in wpl
---
As a Priest Im doing it with a DPS Warrior. Just line the Poison so you got enough Mana to Aoe the Adds by yourself :)
---
You’re so fucking stupid dude. Or you’re trolling.
---
I didn't know this as a hunter. I did it as a joke to a 60 rogue (40 Hunter myself). He camped, hard. Lesson learned the hard way.
---
There is an evade point, which is the ramps on either side into the middle section.
---
Oof, it’s not even that good for hunters. Tier set is just as good
---
Today Uldaman (remember those not-elite packs of 5 dwarfs ?) in a guild run.
---
I go there thinking it's going to be  great occasion to show I improved my tanking skill (as a warrior) to the guild, so me warrior tank, 3 guildies, and a pick-up mage.
---
Obviously the mage goes Aoe whenever the pack is big enough, he sometimes throws an icebolt first. So it goes into a benny hill tanking time, everyone running everywhere. Sometimes, the skull dies first, somehow.
---
Anyway, I grew tired to the point I go dps (because after repeatedly asking not to aoe, aoe still goes on, so why should the weight be on my shoulders ?).
---
The thing that really hurt me, is that "guildies" took the side of the mage.
---
In life, you rarely are right against a teacher, or a group of pairs. But when you're a tank in wow asking not to AoE and people keep AoE-ing, you're alone and right against the multitude.
---
The same guild gave Eye of sulfuras to a random pug (not an alliance of guilds, a pug) because he rolled on it (I can only imagine the guild warriors in that raid... and to a lesser extent, the paladins.).
---
Also, the raid leader is now raiding with another guild because of a binding he dropped while in an alliance guild MC run (don't know the story, just those facts).
---
I realise maybe it's not a perfect guild for warriors...
---
I had a similar card running classic with nearly the same CPU (i7 2600) and it worked fine after I turned down the foreground frame rate. It was set to max or something, so I moved the slider down to 100 FPS, and my game cleaned up quite a bit and the video card use per task manager went from 100% to like 30%.
---
I try my best to decurse as soon as I see it :) Most people do say thank you and comment on how quick I can decurse them :)
---
*Laughs in faerie fire*
---
Okey! Thank you very much for the help!!
---
No this is the definition of Blizzard's fault. They gave us way too few realms, that one was 100% on them.
---
Ganking Alliance scum who are a much lower level than me.
---
There is literally nothing they could introduce to entice me to play retail. There's actually a 0% chance. I haven't played since Wrath and didn't like a lot of the changes then, unless they remove everything and go back to TBC I won't be leaving Classic any time soon.
---
It's not the same game any more, and the new WoW doesn't interest me in the slightest. Might as well be asking if I'd leave Classic for Just Dance 2020 or whatever.
---
I always felt like you need BOE's but if someone actually needs it they get it. I'd be pretty pissed if a BIS epic dropped for my class and I didn't get it just so someone could sell it.
---
According to what? I was under the impression that Herod was the most populated server? Maybe 2nd to Faerlina, the streamer server.
---
Theres nothing. The problems in retail are systemic, not one particular thing. Literally everything good about Classic is the opposite in retail.
---
&gt;the priest book sometimes goes for like 25-40g
---
That's cute. 
---
Haven't seen it for under 300G on Windseeker (US) since the first few days after DM was released and I saw one briefly at about 150G.
---
What rep were you farming?
---
I've been using zperl since TBC. I see some others that look better but I just never get around to switching and having to learn another one.
---
H
---
I would rather fight all day every day than search in vain for an overgriefed gnome.
---
It's better to be the minority faction if you want lots of pvp.
---
Just wait for the TBC servers to inevitably open up, then my brother we get cloak of shadows.
---
lol that sounds much easier
---
Absolutely not. ALTHOUGH, usually if they're not saying anything and pulling it probably means they want to speed up, I don't have a problem with it because I think im a pretty decent tank and can move faster if I need. UNLESS the healer is oom. If they keep doing it after I tell them to stop I'll leave.
---
humans come with an extra buff to racism
---
That's what our CD's are for, wpvp. You're just opening Pandora's box
---
This was in IF, actually
---
This actually works?
---
you cannot. That said, you can double EM with a cast and instant spell. 
---
If you cast a CL and spam a shock during the cast so that they connect at the same time, both will crit and both will cost no mana
---
I would take points out of imp fire totems or concussion to get storm reach, and you'll want nature's guidance and totem mastery talents from resto. I would scrap Imp healing wave and ancestral healing for those. Bit weaker for healing but much stronger dps and pvp.
---
Can I need? It's for my alt.
---
Spending hours farming BRD with a buddy of mine that I met in game.  We are both playing classic together 15 years later.  He's always had infinite patience with me and has always helped me to become a better player.
---
&gt; when the DPS start pulling multiple groups without saying anything?
---
Where the fuck do you find these people? I see this complaint over and over again in the daily tank threads and I have literally NEVER seen this problem. In like 13 days of /played. All PUG runs, basically no guild runs.
---
Of course it should. Thats not unpopular at all. Everyone rolling need because of gold is generally accepted but what the guy is asking the OP is the opposite. He is saying that because everyone needs the gold that even people who need the item itself should roll greed which is absurd
---
Imagine being so bad you look at the whole raid instead of boss fights.
---
*insert nervous face*
---
I'm an idiot and completely misread a graphs name :(
---
But if it's second to the streamer server then i'm tempted. I plan to stream as well but don't have to be on the streamer server to do that.
---
Just use a stop watch with your initial and final health to compare your regen with full and partial healing gear. Plot the 2 points as hp5 vs +healing and take the slope as your conversion factor
---
I don't know about all of that since I don't raid anymore and haven't for a very long time.. But it seems like if he's willing to put in all the work and deal with all the hassle, he ought to be allowed to reserve a couple pieces of gear.
---
The damage buff talent is about 20-30%( I cant remember the exact amount atm) increase with 30% armor increase and 15% health. Also a 30% movement speed increase at all times when outside. 2%HP recovery every 10s. There’s frenzy, increases pet attack’s speed on crit which is 100% chance for most BM builds. And those don’t include the pet talents.  And beastial  wrath only increases the overall damage so your pet is still incredible tanky with out it. For example I use a gorrila and he hits for 150-250 a swing on top of pet cool downs like bite for example. And with frenzy his swings become massively fast. And thunder stomp almost always procs crits in 350+ range with Wrath reaching all the way up to a 500 crit.  So even if by some strange miracle they manage to kill your pet which has never happened to me unless your getting ganked by a large group. Their health is almost gone which means even if they are in mele a range a raptor strike will finish them off. Which in the end makes it so pointless to waist time killing a hunters pet. It’s only some mana and one piece of food for the pet to recover a death. While the attacker corpse walks and gets camped.
---
*whispers* "It's the beard"
---
Sorry, bad use of words, I mean he mind controlling and when the mob die they switch to heal
---
Right, they're just a small indie company and there's no way they could've accurately forecasted demand. It's totally excusable that they were off by at least 400%.
---
After having nolifed a character to level 60, following BiS gear lists and build guides, I have basically come to the conclusion that all of the online resources are cancer for the game. My friend pointed out that pretty much every level 60 in every capital city is wearing the exact same gear because they all follow the same build guides. 
---
Be unique, who the hell cares! - unless you are in the absolute top echelon of raiders, squeezing every decimal percent of survivability, damage, or healing isn't going to be a priority. Respecs are fairly cheap as long as you aren't respeccing constantly - the first one is a gold, then 5, 10, etc.
---
Precisely and that nice little crit buff is always nice
---
This is terrible advice. There are a ton of players who arent going for BIS or dont even know what their BIS is, or just want a stepping stone upgrade because they skipped a dungeon or whatever. Anything thats useful to a class will sell. Bear, Monkey, Tiger, Owl, Eagle. If the disenchant value is higher than the vendor price, people will buy them to disenchant as well. 
---
Vendoring everything is how people end up being broke all the time. Vendor actual garbage, everything else should go on the AH.
---
[The Other Guys](https://youtu.be/daomo982iok)
---
How it feel to play a ~~nerfed~~   fixed shaman?
---
It's not wrong, but rogues still expect heals right.  
---
Obviously no healer out there thinks rogues don't deserve heals because their class can't heal.  
---
The point of being in a party is bringing unique abilities to the group to work as a team.
---
People that understand their class and have a proper rotation even if it's not the highest dps spec is a lot better than a "favorable" class that doesn't know what they're doing. Rogues are probably the best example, since there are so many of them yet very few people know how to play them (specifically in a raid), with swing timers and so on to maximize dps. You'll see rogues in BiS gear get out dpsed by a rogue in shit gear because of it.
---
Had this happen during a rend run with the OH. Thankfully I was the healer and just said I was hearthing if it wasn't changed back and someone else chimed in saying the same. 
---
Nobody even needed the damn thing except the guy who pulled the stunt, and he did get it in the end.. it was more the principle. 
---
Changing loot rules part way through is a no-no.
---
The pet will attack you the whole time since it can't be slowed or cc'd.
---
So your point is that MC is "doable" over two days with an arms tank.
---
Thanks for your valuable contribution to this discussion. You have really opened my eyes to the potential of arms tanks.
---
If seals, auras, and bonus damage stack on a boss, maybe.  But we still have a 16 slot debuff limit.  And we are talking a huge gap in dps.  Additionally, look at the parse from a ret paladin.  What percentage of the damage is raw melee?  That damage is not directly boosted by a holy damage % buff.
---
People aren't allowed to lie on the internet.  Everyone knows that.
---
I play on Herod and have no issues, Herod is one of the most populated servers in classic. There is WAY more loot to go around than on any of the private servers I played on.
---
If it was greedy I’d roll greed, but since I may need to buy my gear upgrades from the AH, I need its cash value.
---
"Be like me and Fuck your wife."
---
Its not possible for a few reasons.
---
1) you wont kill them. Higher level mobs have a higher chance to resist spells
---
2) it would be less XP than killing mobs your level, since mobs 3+ levels start to yield lower XP in similar scaling to mobs 3 levels below
---
just make a shaman and out tag everyone ezpz =P
---
Also, he doesn't necessarily notice which mobs hit like a truck. Sure he'll have an easy time saying, the one with heal buttons and spells needs to die first, but differentiating melee mobs sometimes matters!
---
The monks in SM are an example of this. They need to die right after any of the ones with heal buttons, and I know this because I'm spamming heals lol.
---
Majority of rogues are combat and are not specced into sap that allows you to remain stealth after sapping. and you do not want a rogue to do a sap/body pull in a dungeon anyway.
---
But then this can just create another ninja situation as well? The person who wins it doesn’t have to give it to the person who needs it.
---
Did somebody hurt you, snowflake ?
---
True. My girlfriend does what she wants in game. My guild often ask me to recruit her but that’s up to her.
---
I don't have a 12 button mouse, I have macros. I usually use the modifiers for each totem type. So x, shift-x, alt-x, ctrl-x are all different fire totems, for example. Mouseover rank 1 earth shock is great for quick interrupts.
---
Don't think you should censor the names of scumlords tbh
---
No it doesn't, what you're describing is called vertical progression, you're getting stronger and therefore that mob you fought and struggled with because stats is getting easier as your stats rise to match it or surpass it as you level. Zone scaling means that no matter what you do, no matter how much you level, that mob will hit a point of finite stat lock so at a point your sense of getting stronger from levels will simply disappear when fighting it and with the broken ass way that scaling works you could actually get weaker as you level if your gear isn't improving to match. 
---
Scaling was the single biggest mistake they made for leveling in WoW period. Takes an arbitrary slog and just made it 10,000 more boring where you spend 110 levels barely feeling like you're making any tangible power progress since even skills and abilities don't really affect your kill time on them because of how the scaling works.
---
Why would a Druid tank want a friend who will roll against them for all that sweet cat gear? 
---
Rogues are by far the hardest class to gear as none of the tanks want you around.
---
My server is still layered so not dead sorry
---
Well, atleast The world feels big.
---
I opened a GM ticket. Stated the hatred of political undertones, requested name change or confirmation that begging for name reports doesn't violate TOS. I'll wait it out to pay if I have to.
---
Ya all pserver players who complained about phasing, missed the fact that those servers had 5x more nodes.
---
Tell me about this blacklist?
---
Too much would need to change. Retail in most regards is casual-friendly. The only decently difficult part of the game remaining is the raiding/PvE aspect (which is 100x harder than Classic). No titanforging, bring back the old talent systems that I grew to love in TBC (&amp; Classic). Get rid of flying mounts, they ruin the game and it has destroyed the world pvp scene for the most part. Stop listening to garbage cans who are new to the game and want it even easier for them. Remove heirlooms, remove lvl110 boosts for $$$, slow down leveling so its an actual experience and feels rewarding. I don't want to be able to get to lvl30 in just a few hours. Retail is doomed for the most part, theyve gone down the black hole and now so many people have quit. 
---
Fuck Blizzard for the most part, they ruined a great game slowly, expansion by expansion, listening to dumb fucks and garbage players. &amp; they will never own up or fix their mistakes. They are too stubborn and there are too many.
---
Just walk around that area? Gadgetzan in particular you can completely avoid their range. Booty bay there was one quest turn-in a rogue was camping, had to get creative with my cooldowns to turn it in but still doable.
---
Interesting. I don’t quite understand what you mean by 50 dps. But yeah I do understand that the encounters are never exactly the same. 
---
But you’re saying pve and always being behind the target, the +5dps would be better for both?
---
It’s not an excuse . But he sounds lonely as hell. He acted wrong .
---
Hell yeah!
---
Go for full dps set first and then consider adding int for extra mana. Honestly its very hard to oom on mage with free mana gem and major mana pots, and you can do a tick or two of innervate on the worst bosses like rag.
---
1 SP = 6-8 int in terms of raw DPS. 8 for with wbuffs, 6 without. Roughly.
---
It might be part of the pre-naxx event adding both loots and bosses to some dungeons (for example RFD)
---
I mean it would've been fine if you did, but you didn't. You literally said you maybe recall raiding as an arcane mage back in BC.
---
Yeah prolly
---
That’s really the part that bugs me. I get how energy works but skulls need to die first. Albeit healers or just heavy aoe users etc. 
---
But they shit talk about threat etc. I hate that it’s like comeon lol
---
It's def not needed, it does help though. Do you plan to dps or tank while raiding?
---
Skeram needs you. 
---
But we are also 70/30 horde.
---
Think about 2 other dps and 1 healer who got it bad while it wasn't their fault at all. Aren't you sorry for them?
---
The best way is asking a leader of the group to kick a dick dps. If dick DPS is a leader, just ask everyone to leave party and join you again.
---
Warlock SM/ruin is a good all around build.  Good for dungeons and raids even if not 100% min max vs DS/ruin, and I'd say for solo both fel concentration and curse of exhaustion have benefits.  I took CoE because it is useful for kiting melee in pvp.
---
&gt;I don't play with idiots
---
&gt;Not playing with Feral druids
---
Ya.... That was what I was implying
---
For twinks like in the 29 and 39 bracket, the other side of the proc is the heal which can happen quite a few times in a row and heal you quite a bit.
---
Overall Crusader I would consider the better enchant than say +5 damage isn't +5 dps, its just +5 top and bottome end damage.  You need to take into consideration weapon speed and armor reductions to your damage.  Honestly, outside of comparing Hemo to SS with +5 and +15 agility, I would go +15 agility as it gives half a crit, some ap, 1% dodge, etc.
---
Crusader is better, except for cost. If not Crusader, go +15 agility.  Daggers is the exception here. Go +5 dmg daggers.
---
AGREED I can farm some DM solo and chill and not worry about the dumb neck.
---
That’s a lot of projection. Oh no, you have a wonderful family and you enjoy playing a game in your downtime that you haven’t invested your whole identity into. How terrible.
---
So many different musics for so many different people. Cool vid. thanks man.
---
I have no problem with ganking but its very odd that he is able to kill lowbies in town.
---
What sorcery is this
---
The rank.  Early wands tend to out damage early ranks of drain life until you lvl 46 then the ranks of drain life outpace the dps gains of further wands.
---
What race are you? If undead flurry axe is best or bone slicing hatchet is good.
---
OMG! I never knew this happened to other people. I once Mind Controlled some poor Orc off the boat from Booty Bay to Ratchet. I must've done it right at the moment of the loading screen and messed up his location in the game, because he automatically ported to the sky above the Dalaran bubble and fell to the ground(I presume).
---
Now I know the reason why.
---
what can the gm really do, he isnt breaking any rules
---
I would say someone needing a BoE for a gear upgrade and then losing the roll and not getting the item from someone who just needed it to sell on the AH is a definite ninja. Why would it not be?
---
Hi, /u/JohnDonZamp

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/doufaa/blizzard_supports_lynching_but_not_make_azeroth/). 
---
booty bay is not that far.......
---
But I feel like I shouldn’t have to avoid an area of the game just because people are exploiting it
---
Never claimed it to be good ?
---
On a side note, you can't even be too upset when he rolled a 95, doubtful you would have beaten said roll.  You still should have received a chance to though.
---
If you're anything like me you turned those stupid things off as soon as you installed Windows 10!! But at work I leave them on, that's the only reason I'd ever know about the feature.
---
Ive had enough of your big mouth. Give me your name and server and well sort this out on the battlefield.
---
[Nah, its true to real life to people in the military](https://i.redd.it/ycidx5z17du31.jpg)
---
Gotta back up a bit and engage the melee leeway, then it'll count as a "ranged" attack ;)
---
&gt; People in here make it sound like the moment they find some minor slight they will just dip on a group.
---
This isn't some minor slight. If DPS want faster pulls, kill stuff faster, try to CC things which are at range from the tank, try to make your tank's life easier so pulls can be chained together.
---
&gt; Dungeons just aren't that hard.
---
You're not a tank, and certainly not a healer I can tell. Tanks are easy when you're dps you just mash buttons and faceroll. Tanks and healers have a lot on their shoulders, and a lot of stress happens. Yes tanks signed up for it, but there's a lot of things people can do to make the tank's life that much easier.
---
&gt; I think the reality is many tanks don't know how to play or hold threat, 
---
0 rage = 0 threat. Pulling for the tank means 0 threat.
---
See a trend here?
---
DPS job, is to deal damage when the tank has everything under control.
---
Tanks also have a lot more awareness such as healer's mana, patrols, it's on them not to screw it up.
---
The OP did the correct thing in the end, you pull, you tank. Don't like it, roll a tank. It's much easier to find a new group, which is making your life easy, than to suffer through a group who will make your life harder.
---
r/idonthavesex
---
Hence that's why I asked specifically about it - yeah, every other enchanting recipe is farmable / replaceable.
---
Goodbye my follow Enchanter, you've gone to the Gnomish/Goblin side now.
---
Worms/lures I'd imagine
---
You are not wrong that the system is functionally the same, but the end result and feel for the player is drastically different.
---
As you level in the old system, you become stronger and start to overpower the current content you are doing, and can move onto new content. There is a tangible feeling of progression.
---
As you level in the new system, you become instantaneously weaker versus current content, has no result on content you can do while you're within the dynamic level band. There is no tangible feeling of progression, you simply see a number go up.
---
There are also some adverse side effects to dynamic scaling. At launch it was discovered that all items contributed equally to scaling, while not all items contributed equally to your character power. Thus you were able to take off your rings and necklace to make your character relatively more powerful.
---
The long story short of it all is that while they're functionally same, one systems hides this treadmill better than the other. The new system you can really feel the effects.
---
Medium servers have more players on them than the most populated servers in vanilla. 
---
Low population servers are the true vanilla experiences. They’re not dead either. During peak times they usually manage to hit medium population.
---
Griefing?
---
Well you do, and the 50th post about it isnt going to change that..
---
What classes can druids beat in pvp/duels? I feel so helpless when I try to fight anyone.
---
When I'm bored or burnt out from leveling I just play the auction house or grind on an alt
---
Yeah you can still do that the same but good luck finding some to do it. Most 60s are going to want to get paid to do something like that. If you factor in the time it takes to find someone to do it, just questing or grinding dungeons with a full group is far more efficient imo
---
Also, account sharing is against the ToS and can get you banned. A lot of people do it but just thought I'd let you know.
---
Guess it depends on how much you overgear the tank, and that was certainly the case in early vanilla, but by 1.12 tank threat had been drastically increased to the point where HS spam is now the way to go most of the time baring bosses with threat drops.
---
Dude is right. You’re TOXIC!
---
Right? This is his reward for wasting time. He earned that ability to grief. Just pray he gets bored soon
---
Leaving a group of people because you don't like the way you are being treated is fine in real life, and it's fine in wow.  If you otherwise liked the group and didn't want to leave, there were other ways to handle the situation to better achieve that outcome, but you did nothing wrong.  The healer telling you you **should** come back sounds a bit entitled.
---
I find dungeon grinding way faster as a pally. The key is not group with over leveled players or the exp is garbage. As holy I can heal the group through pretty bad situation and my downtime is minimal, so things tend to move quickly.
---
are you implying that not following a bis list means you'll be stuck with questing greens or some shit lmao
---
real talk you seem a bit emotionally stunted buddy i hope you're alright and working through your own shit and this being rude on reddit thing is just some kinda weird outlet in a shit phase in your life
---
Tbh you just seem like you are arguing to feel better about your choice to leave a high pop realm. It's always the Ret paladins with a chip on their shoulder.
---
if the mobs are grey to him, you only get 5% xp. So it's really only good to get some bonus loot easily.
---
Human haha
---
Why don't you do something constructive and suggest a better rage dump instead of hyperbolic shit?
---
A bit selfish on both your parts. Mage shouldn't have been a dick, but usually someone does that when the tank is going incredibly slowly, taking numerous unnecessary breaks, etc. I've done what the mage did, but 1) I knew I could tank the pack fine if I had to 2) a subtle hint to the tank to speed up 3) usually when its going at the pace of a snail. 
---
If you're leaving a group midrun solely b/c someone wanted you to go faster, yea thats pretty shitty of you. You weren't ninja'd, insulted and cussed at (till after you left), you didn't wipe, etc. You threw a temper tantrum b/c you didn't like that someone thought you were going too slowly. Every situation is different, sometimes a 'speed up buddy' is warranted. Leaving a group stranded mid run just b/c someone wanted you to go faster? Scummy.
---
Congratulations you found the worst Druid in the game. Try that again on someone who doesn’t drool on their keyboard to move and let me know the results.
---
Basically nothing, i rather just play the holy trinity again. Enjoy Classic - Enjoy TBC - Get fed up with Gearscore in Wrath - Quit
---
I wouldn't worry about it, he's just some idiot Ret paladin who transferred off a high pop server and is arguing on Reddit to feel better about his choice.
---
Why didn't the shadow priest dps and the holy paladin heal?
---
They do. You won't really need to pop dark/demonic runes as a mage unless if you are speedrunning mc(don't have time to remake them)
---
Because everyone in the party contributed to a random boe that dropped and holds a value for everyone in the group, be it gold or a gear upgrade. If a mage need rolls a hoj it’s a pointless roll that benefits no one, that’s a shitty move.
---
yea, but they're usually out of the way and surrounded by mobs. I've kept up on mine, but it is a hassle. I get why some people put it off
---
High level player xp penalty is different in the world than it is in instances.
---
What class doesn’t have cc? Lmao. Every class has cc in classic.
---
So both? K
---
That does not refute what I said. Spell batching is essentially caused by the server tickrate (though this is a simplification). They got rid of it in the past by making the tick rate far faster. For Classic they made it slower again. It's literally the same general system as it was back in vanilla.
---
Once you get pummel you will laugh in the face of casters.
---
Pummel. They start casting again
---
Interrupt. They start casting again
---
Pummel. They dead.
---
I love fighting casters on my warr
---
Mind controlling people on boats and zeppelins is so evil. I love it.
---
I might be mistaken, but I believe Ion said during the streamer summit that while they could increase the player cap on realms they wouldn’t do that, because it wouldn’t be vanilla-like. So based on that the only difference is that back then a large portion of the playerbase never reached max level, but now we’re a lot more knowledgeable and resources aren’t balanced around so many players being so «top-end minded».
---
And THIS is why I laugh when they ask why I went dwarf rogue.
---
They can't fix broken addons
---
Also Nightfin Soup gives 10mp5, great for casters.
---
its already been 2 days, not looking good lol
---
\*taps head\*
---
Well yeah but i was talking about real guilds, not a cesspool guild. not much difference between those and the general public
---
Yep I tank a ton of arena/anger runs and usually I end up bringing at least one rogue/one hunter. I let every single one know that i'm going to be rolling on savage glads/HOJ if it drops, and every single person says they expect me too. Why else would I be doing the runs? adversely trying to put together an arena/anger run as a tank that doesn't include at least one class rolling on one of the items is next to impossible as well. There's only so many casters that need arena.
---
You need to rewire your brain to instead of blinking away from hunters to blink directly on top of them and freeze them in place. Chances are you got popped by an Aimed shot while you were busy CCin the pet, best case scenario you keep them in the dead zone (about 7 yd away) but even just standing on top of them they are significantly weaker with a melee weapon
---
not general cc. specific cc. as a priest, i can only cc undead. catch my drift?
---
You can try, but that will accomplish nothing, just wasting a GM's time. There is no way for you to change your name. End of story. You can beg them all you want, offer to pay money like on retail, whatever the story, they don't care and you are nothing special to them and they will never give you the opportunity when the other million players do not have the same opportunity.
---
Tac mastery is basically essential for tanking dungeons. And Sweeping strikes is amazing when you get it.  Fury only works with hit gear and tons of crit.  Arms just works really well as a leveling spec.
---
Did u read all the replies those people gave u?
---
I don’t think it’s that big of deal, unless it’s BiS, but honestly, life moves on and it’ll drop again.

If you're on a high pop server don't even bother trying to aoe farm. All the good spots will be taken every time you go there. I'm 57 and haven't done any aoe farming. 
---
I would go arcane/Frost if you are going to always have a partner. If you're planning on going solo at all, I'd go deep Frost for leveling.

What server are you on OP? Posts like this really need a server tag or something - if I had to guess many of the people complaining are the sheep who followed everyone on to the “Reddit server”.
---
I rarely see a complaint on this sub that I also experience consistently on my server.
---
It has a 3 hour cooldown.
---
Finally finding an awesome guild and logging in everyday to progress through end game content.
---
I think I'd heard it from a John Staats interview.  And I think the reasoning was that it was the first zone 
---
Couldn't Google an answer though I'm afraid.
---
And no
---
Even if you do managed to get a full sheep on the hunter, you have to kill his pet, bandage and get back in his dead zone before sheep breaks to even have an attempt at killing him.
---
Most of the time doing this youll be either low on life/mana from dealing with the pet or the hunter breaks out of sheep while you’re dealing with the pet and kills you anyway. 
---
This fight is most of the time in the hunters favor.
---
Id report him. If you have proof like this they will delete it from their inventory.
---
It sucks because you don't get it but at least you know they don't benefit from it at all and now you know they are an asshole

“Nah” - Blizzard

Strats bro, strats

Just get yourself ShareX.

It's got waaaay too many features but the only one that I (and you might) care about is that I can hotkey the selection tool (I set mine to ctrl+shift+4) and instantly select what I wanna copy to my clipboard. Better yet, it instantly uploads it to my old puush account as well. You can then tell it to leave the link on your clipboard if you want.
---
https://puu.sh/EyrBG/0c6a0ff401.png This screenshot took me all of 5sec to paste here.
---
Yes and no. As a tank, I don't say things like (in classic, that is) "if you pull it you can tank it", because that's divisive talk and can't end in anything but them eating their words (which given that they said you should move faster indicates they almost certainly won't).
---
I've been in groups where people will pull ahead of me, and to them I say that I HAVE to be the one to aggro, otherwise I won't get initial threat and therefore the group goes everywhere. So if they said something to me like "we need to move faster", I defer to the healer because regardless of what any pissy dps or overconfident tank thinks, the *healer* is the one who truly sets the pace.  If they can handle more, we get more. If not, pulling more will make the dungeon take longer due to more drink phases, and (gasp) wipes.
---
There's a toxicity in this game, and honestly all blizzard games and, honestly, in all multiplayer games that isn't mitigated at all. So so I think you were wrong? No.  But I wouldn't do the same thing you did and I instead keep cordial and patient and let *them* leave, looking like a child.
---
I had a group on Stalagg that wasn't ready to go when I joined, because they thought it would take longer to find a tank. If I want something, I just res it and start a group. Easy to find DPS all day long. So many warriors want to play fury only.
---
millimeters?

Dude wants to be noticed because he is a fucking loser.

Mhh no I don't but I watched this video a few times now and I can't seem to find any differences. I am even using the macro. Maybe I am just missing practice.

For a rogue, a hunter sitting on a flare and trap is satisfying to see you cower. It practically feels like a win to see you so scared.

Well I haven't really played WoW much, but my current roommate got me to play classic and I'll say that it's been a blast running dungeons with friends. Don't really have a great memory yet, but I plan on doing my first ever raid on Thursday so that will be one.

17% chance to miss, you can’t get that below 1% so you only need 16% to cap.

You can try but most of the time, just killing a BM pet is like killing an actual player.

Also BW isnt on a 10 min cd so in bgs they are gonna rip you a new one most of the time.

1g, 5g, 10g, 15g, 20g, 25g...
---
That’s what I can confirm so far... I think I have a problem.
---
yeah, you always risk shit with that. for me it's like a last resort panic button :)))
---
Awesome 🎃
---
I'm saying to stop looking at things based on how much character sheet(paper) dps they add. Crusader adds 100 strength. That applies to every attack(save for your poisons) that you do, and it'll increase your dps by more than just the static "100ap = 7dps."
---
+5 weapon damage is better for your MH with daggers because daggers do 150% weapon damage + the static amount. The +5 is calculated into the full backstab damage, so it adds more than just a static 5 to the end of the damage.
---
Get rid of huge offensive and defensive spells that prolong pvp
---
Get rid of titanforging
---
Less dailies that impact raiding.
---
11% as you can’t get over 99%, but yes.
---
Good point
---
Then you need edgemasters, uses mirah's song until then
---
As a female UD rogue, I sympathize so hard with this
---
Yeah I need to do this on my shaman. Just need that one drop and I'm done with DM:N
---
Lol, much appreciated.
---
Id like to neck you please .
---
If you swap gnome with undead, then maybe it will make more sense.
---
Gnome (like undead) is the race with the best PvP racials on that side. All of the people who like to ~~camp lowbies~~ PvP fairly gravitate towards them. Even if you aren't one of them, it is hard for a random person to know that, so people will attack first rather than giving you a chance to kill them when they are least expecting it.
---
That is still the only response you have apart from getting to level 60 and outsmarting them in said areas.
---
i’m pretty sure it was an arcane spec. probably wasn’t 100% straight still no need to freak out lol you can literally look up what specs do what and for what purpose
---
Ok. I have all the ranks already.
---
that's why I always roll need on boe, because of shit like this. fuck that.
---
Do you know the macro for this? I’m not sure how how mouse over works. I just spam tab until I get the right target.

What level can I start doing Dire Maul? Which parts can I do first and what is the progression order?

I'm a 57 mage. I've heard of people "farming lashers". What is that? Is it profitable compared to say zf gy runs? And when can I do it?

I don’t see any fire.... oh wait wrong sub reddit

Yeah, it's called the trash mechanic. It was recently added to the not a bug list.

Thank you! I am tired AF from working and barely getting sleep so I was just being lazy cause I didnt wanna to try to remember my password for reddit.
---
Don't forget undead and troll race special can also proc it
---
There's nothing instant about it.  It's not irreplaceable at all.   It's a free shard every 30 minutes.  That you can get in 15 seconds of fighting something.
---
It's trash
---
you can't generalize it like that. altho if you want to generalize it with current gear and current content, crusader is in 90% of the time the better option.
---
short and long fights are relative. if the fight lasts 30 seconds for example, crusader is twice as good as 15 agility. if the fight lasts like 90 seconds, crusader is still superior. if the fight lasts 60 seconds tho, 15 agility is superior. it heavily depends on the actual procs (ppm) of crusader to determine whats stronger. additionally most fights won't be just autoattacking, but moving as well. once you move, agility isn't worth anything, while the inner crusader proc cooldown counts down. furthermore there is a crit cap based on your hit. once you fully buff yourself, you can overcome that crit cap which would make 15 agility weaker under all circumstances. 
---
stop spreading guesses, man.
---
Without herb you’re looking at about 35G for Princess and Tinkerer, adding Rotgrip increases that by about 10g p/h.
---
Assuming 5 runs per hour ofc.
---
DM/strat/scholo/ubrs will be hard to find groups until 58 at the earliest. LBRS around 55. If you were a healer or tank its a different story, but sadly rogues &amp; hunters like myself are kindof bottom of the barrel picks for DPS even though we can put out great numbers
---
    /tm [@mouseover] 1
---
I think the ele tree looks good. I'd consider dropping the armor bonus and cast speed from resto tree for +3% hit and totemic mastery. 3% hit is to balance the hybrid, you'll be fine healing either way but hit is very impactful for dps/leveling. Totemic mastery is a near must because it'll stop you from having to drop twice when your tank isn't pulling back
---
9% is yellow ability hit cap. yellow ability being any ability that shows up yellow on the floating combat #'s, aka ability/spell dmg. the white numbers or white hits, aka normal attacks from weapons, wands, and bows/guns. have a cap of 24%.
---
As a DPS I like to move slow too. I fight fast but plan methodically and like to relax.
---
nah you're probably right i thought about it some more and decided that i agree with you, the epic gear can only be the updated versions, surely
---
DM E/LBRS I'd say 55+
---
DMW/DMN, Strat, Scholo 58-60
---
Oh, really? So I shouldn’t care my friends decided to pick a west coast server, even though we are all east coast?
---
I haven’t noticed any problems so far but I was worried it would be a slight disadvantage when PvP picks up. It’s about 50 ping higher than east coast, in some games that can be a huge difference.
---
Oh look same list another site.

---
What makes you say it's the "true" classic experience?
---
And don't use drain life if you don't want to pull aggro from your VW. Self-healing abilities cause double threat generation.
---
PvP Griefing :
---
These actions, although some may see them as dishonorable, are considered legitimate PvP tactics and will not be addressed by gamemaster staff.
---
&gt;Speaking of PvP, world PvP is going to be dead once Phase 3 hits. It's just a fact. The honour system makes it more or less mandatory to get into battlegrounds if you want to progress.
---
In the case of unbalanced servers, the more populated side will face longer queue times and need to spend that dead time out in the world. Faction imbalance is going to be a real issue once battlegrounds hit.
---
Seems like a reasonable request and just about any GM would do the same.
---
Druids can take on quite a few classes in PvP, but it takes a lot of skill.  Druids are all about the hit-and-run-and-kite.
---
those are like 4g currently lol
---
Ok but back to the point, that’s cc. Every class in classic has some sort of cc that can be used on other players/mobs.
---
Back in Vanilla the content was dished out over 12 patches. For classic this has been replicated in "phases" bringing things like honor/pvp tracking, new raids (dungeons like DM) etc. You can search the forums for the bluepost about phases and what comes when
---
Its almost like one site copied the list off the other site, o , wait.
---
Thanks for the netcode Blizzard KEKW
---
As a hunter i have the same problem with FD. If i have 1+ mobs on top of me hitting me I can flip a coin if it'll work right. If i move a bit so they are also moving + attacking and then hit it, it never ever fails on me now.
---
With all this tank shortage talk I would just leave and get another group in a few mins. Not sure why some people whine about there being no tanks yet treat them like garbage when they finally get one.
---
Just take a break and go do SFK and hearth/fly/travel/walk back to duskwood!
---
A full run thru a dungeon with quests won’t out level you from your current quest hub
---
This. Stay 2h arms until you’re almost 60 and have good hit gear. I’m 56 arms/prot with a mediocre 2h axe and I’m doing like 330 dps in BRD. Pop SS, berserk, WW repeat. So much damage.
---
What spec are you? Druids can beat lots of classes but you have to be big brain about a lot of matchups. Drain health against classes who cant heal and get clutch heals on yourself, pressure vs casters, shapeshift to avoid CC etc
---
It also doesn’t cost mana, and if you’re being jumped in world PvP it means you’re 1 gcd away from fel domination+sac shield with 0 mana cost. I’m not saying it’s a mind blowing game breaking trinket to take to raid, it’s just a nice qol thing to have out in the world.
---
The pulling doesn't normally happen if you wait a few GCDs, like I said it could be a bad mage and not necessarily an aoe issue (is that what you were saying? If yes then we agree with each other). 
---
Out of group of 5 mobs, maybe 2 will come towards me but they're slow as a crawl so no issues.
---
This is me, as a mage, in brd. Dps was never a problem and tank can do his job and just smooth sailing in general.
---
Obviously the 3 fireguard destroyers should be targeted but that's an unusual group.
---
I just pull mobs with flare and trap up like no one is there. Since the mana cost and cds are so low they're easy to spam.
---
I don't do this out of fear though. In fact, I usually don't flare just so the rogue will open because using both turns rogues into massive pussies.
---
You either grow a pair and get frozen or run away scared.
---
It’s a joke, sorry I don’t have potato hands and need to make anything in classic even easier.
---
Sounds like a good idea for wallpaper engine
---
Multibillion dollar company bTW
---
Its not identical. Its almost like BiS lists have been around for 15 years and havent changed much.
---
Tell DPS to slow down. As long as 1. Nobody dies and 2. Healer does not go OOM, nothing matters. DPS is in charge of their own threat, you're in charge of keeping the skulled target on you. Don't go speccing to accommodate lazy or incompetent DPS until you're comitted to endgame tanking.
---
Icy veins isn't listing daggers, its listing fist of omokk. Which is correct.
---
Yeah my main thinking would be for DM:E Jumps clearing those imps
---
yep, but being more specific adds to the dynamic and player interaction :) i love that
---
Generally finding groups for most content other than BRD can be difficult before 58. Not to say you won't find a group that will take you, but generally it's a little bit harder. You can already start running BRD though and can probably find a LBRS group starting at like 56-58. 
---
I have completed almost every dungeon with someone who is like 56 at some point while helping guildies get to 60, as long as you have a few DPS in pretty good gear it shouldn't be a problem if you can find a group willing to take you along.
---
Level 45 warlock. Hunters if they got the jump would kill me, I win easily if I get the jump. Druids usually gank and kill me or just run away. Rogues just now started giving me some trouble but I think I'm misplaying it not fearing enough. I annihilate warriors, pally, mage. Haven't done enough against priest. Overall I've been a menace and frequently 2v1d some groups. 
---
I use my succ to run in stealth and charm, then get off my combo.
---
BS my man, a warrior that doesn't use macros (myself currently) is inferior to a warrior that has set them up.  You gimp yourself  choosing not to macro, and don't try to pretend you're not.
---
They aoe grinded to 60 and it has ruined them. I kick any mages acting like this. My number 1 rule is: Dont be replaceable.
---
That’s not how it works and don’t be surprised when people get pissed at you lol.
---
I think it depends on strategy. I'n raid a NS is a must because it's so valuable as an oh shit button.
---
If you are doing dungeons with your guild I'd highly recommend EM because of mana management. 
---
Logic being, with an organized group you shouldn't often need an oh shit button but mana is a constant consideration. EM doesn't directly help healing mana but it does add 2-3k mana free single target dps in 2s. That's 10-15% of health on many buses which means a 10-15% shorter fight and less mana needed for healing.
---
Also incredibly useful for caster mobs i.e doomguards in DM or skeleton casters in strath. You can almost single handedly melt those targets before you need to cast a single healing saving your group a ton of damage taken
---
Ok I understand ya now. That’s kinda why I went from the equations I red about and felt it would be proper to ask for peoples experiences/opinions here. This was a lot of help. Thanks man!
---
I would think GMing raid guilds for over a decade is more likely to be /r/idonthavesex lol...
---
https://worldofwarcraft.fandom.com/et/wiki/Griefing  
---
&gt;Blizzard isn't against griefing behavior when there's a PvP remedy (if you can get together a group of allies to trounce the offending party or simply kill all the mobs quickly, the problem is solved), but when the griever is impossible to attack (is not set PvP, or is of the same faction as his targets), there is no such PvP remedy.
---
&gt;Do you skip some dungeons becasue the zones are not the right level ?
---
I skipped the a handful of the horde centric dungeons when playing as alliance, RFD, RFK, WC, RFC and one or two others were just too annoying to find groups for.
---
&gt;Im in duskwood right now I’m level 24 and want to do shadow fang keep but by the time I will finish the quests in duskwood I guess shadowfang will be too low level for me
---
You'll be fine, SFK is still decent for level 30ish players.
---
&gt;But if I leave duskwood to explore silver pine forests (where the dungeon is) I won’t have explored everything in duskwood and be frustrated. So how do you usually manage the leveling/which zone where to level ? 
---
Set your hearth to Duskwood, go to Silverpine, and after you finish the instance hearth back and you are exactly where you left while still getting to experience SFK.
---
When you have no rage you need to use every trick in the book to generate threat!
---
8-12 depending on crit.
---
Tell them how much you’re going to tip. A gold will get you a much better response rate than an unknown amount.
---
Is it 
---
&gt;frostbolt-frostbolt-frostbolt-evocate-frostbolt-frostbolt 
---
or 
---
&gt;frostbolt-frostbolt-frostbolt-frostbolt-evocate-frostbolt?
---
Worst I've had was a warlock laughing I couldn't hold threat when he spammed his 1.5sec cast high threat fire spell and not even on marked skull.
---
Needless to say he kicked after a few pull by the leader after dying.
---
Same, couldn't find a resource of pre-made warrior macros. Looked up tutorials and learned how to write my own instead, lol. 
---
Coolest thing I learned was to start them all with /startattack. Makes it so you can unbind your start attack key, if it's macroed into everything on your bar.
---
It's below 20g on Mograine EU now.
---
Ugh fuck that mage, exact same thing happened to me on my very first deadmine run. Mage said I was going too slow and started pulling things. I had no rage and couldn't charge being stuck in combat. Politely asked him to stop and he wouldn't, telling me hurry and that him being there was a favour because he was lvl 20. Left the group, guy thought we were in a progamer tournament or something.
---
There was a group of like 10 Alliance max outside Undercity entrance on Deviate Delight RPPVP server you know one of those "dead realms" whatever that means. 
---
Anyway about 10-20 of us go out to kill them and the game was practically unplayable with 30 people at the Undercity entrance.
---
Haha gg Blizz take my money and hand me a bag full of poop
---
They do not.
---
Hah!
---
GachiBass Clap
---
They actually released pvp as late as they say they are going to
---
You said you don’t think you even know what you’re doing wrong. What makes you think you’re doing something wrong? Are you dying more than you’d like? Struggling to level? 
---
Without running dungeons it’s hard to know what you could be doing “wrong”. The big ways to learn dungeons are shared in other people’s comments so I figured I’d ask about your solo experience.
---
Mouse fix?
---
Nvm, OEB just dropped. brb respec :D
---
Windows + shift + S is even better.
---
As a hunter, I'm thankful for mages like this because they're slowly stealing the reputation of the noob class that ruins dungeons from us.
---
That will only delay the inevitable the 1.5 seconds it takes to disarm traps
---
Yeah it's literally faerie fire, moonfire, then run away in travel, or chase is travel until rogue is dead.
---
10 man naxxramas on wotlk launch. So much fun
---
Hey! Pressing 2 15 times in a row is hard work!
---
Cheers
---
I'm in all my bis raid gear as a ret paly. So?
---
Then they can pay the AH price, Rolling a BoE is for everyone, either I make gold and buy the job equivalent item or the person that wants to use it can SAVE the gold by not spending it.
---
Meanwhile im approaching level 40 as an enh shaman wondering how the fuck im supposed to get ele gear if Im not supposed to roll on it...
---
I am very social in the game lmao, but the entire point of setting a goal is to hit the goal, not to take handouts.... It's a video game, why would I want to get better if it's not from something I did
---
No fucking joke. I literally can't level 58-60 because every single Furbolg in winterspring is dead and i can't quest. This is turbo fucked lmao.
---
What kinda shit you smoke that made you think cadav is better than savage LOL?
---
Yeah - was thinking about just going through it myself, I just dont have the time unfortunately.
---
I was hoping to find a macro repo as well as a action bar layout of how top wars play.
---
2 Large Radiant Shards + 2 Greater Nether Essences (roughly 3g per shard = ~6g + 3-4g for GNE's = ~6-8g), you're looking at under 15g per weapon.
---
That's just over my typical TIP for a crusader enchant, not including the mats! Rightous orbs are ~30-35g a pop need 2 so 60g + 4 large brill shards which is ~2-3g a pop, roughly 8-12g, PLUS 10-15g TIP (I don't have a set tip amount, it's what people usually give me, as others charge a 20g enchant fee)
---
Good on you for enchanting your gear, and looking at what you are looking at in terms of most effective. There's some corners to be cut (such as getting +3 stats to chest, instead of +4), to save yourself a ton of money and time, which can be better invested in getting stronger items WORTHY of your time and gold investment for sure.
---
Happy grinding!
---
Is he soloing this farm? The video doesn't seem to be working.
---
I would agree for non casters.
---
Never understood this argument for borderline unplayable speccs or sever limitations / oversights, the main devs back then even said that it was not meant to be that way but due to missing time simply wasn't finished / fleshed out enough.
---
Since WoW became such a huge phenomenon they shifted big overhauls to the upcoming expansion and tried their best to grant us a smooth experience while the servers were burning.
---
Neutral AH commission is much higher, keep that in mind.
---
Alt + printscreen too if no cropping is needed.
---
I comment on multiple posts assuming the motivation of perfectly ontopic posts and being an ass....you think im cool yet?
---
I only ever had the crimson and dark.  Want an emerald so bad.
---
Oh right, we could've transferred to the server that's 90% alliance and 10% horde, losing a huge portion of our guild in the process and potentially taking on more problems than we left behind. Wow great plan why didn't we think of that???
---
Yup.  And people are using WAY more consumables now than they did back in Vanilla.  It's really the demand that's responsible for any perceived scarcity, not just the population.
---
Mark puts you on GCD, giving 1.5 seconds to react and charge in
---
If your guild is clearing rag easily there really isn’t a reason to funnel gear to your tank anymore.
---
Onslaught girdle should be fury warrior priority. It’s rare and literally one of just a few MC items they actually want
---
Just swap to the next one?
---
Thank you!!
---
Not really, just in disbelief and wanted to share. Have a great day !
---
No but I would definitely avoid playing with you as well if you're taking forever
---
Q1: No clue don't follow it
---
Q2: There's no schedule no. Blizzard said in an interview or something that phase 2(Worldbosses and pvp rank system) would come this year, thus within 2 months. But it's coming eventually so might as well prepare now.
---
Yes you can do lashers one pack at a time in DM East at that level. Very profitable. Should get herbalism. 30g/hr without herb 50g/hr with herb.
---
MC pugs can be hit and miss though.
---
It only takes a few idiots to wipe certain bosses.
---
Imo gnomes are the best for PvP as a melee class alliance side and horde have a choice between UD and orc, basically choosing what you want more of an advantage vs caster or melee.
---
My first char was a druid, I used to swim as far as I could in shapeshift. Like the walk from Darnasuss wasnt long enough.
---
Gloves and neck too
---
They do have the right to the loot but his wife’s character does not. Is his wife there helping kill the mobs?
---
The proper thing would be ask before the roll or message the winner of the all greed roll and try to work a deal out for under the AH price.
---
*Weeps quietly at the removal of frost tanking.*
---
How do you restore a character in classic?
---
People enjoy working for their gear. That is to say there is a difference in running content for drops vs. farming gold and playing the AH. There is a different satisfaction to getting you gear through content, that piece of armor or weapon then comes with a story.
---
You are saying only option two is a viable path.
---
It used to be realm only at first but then they opened “battle groups” where like x many realms were linked together for battlegrounds only. I assume they were matched based off faction balance but who knows
---
Perfect time to larp in your backyard
---
Nice try Blizzard Market Research.
---
Where the fuck did this mentality come from? Retail? Yuuuuuck. 
---
This is never how it’s worked.
---
Gee mate, never occurred to me. Have you tried this yet: https://i.imgur.com/VnKYDp7.jpg
---
Really, what happened to this community? You guys let all that fighting over mob spawns go to your head so now it’s every man for himself? There’s no other priests in the group who needed on it. You get the book one of two ways, you find it or you buy it. He found it, he has a use for it. You’re mad because he got an item you would have sold on the AH if you had won? Posts toxic.
---
Then go farm solo.
---
i have yet to come across a single rogue that ever has done that.
---
Finding Emeriss while wandering around Duskwood and my buddy paid me 1s to run up and whack her. Obviously insta-died, but it was hilarious. Also, I made 1s.
---
Nobody knows census data since it's not available. You're the one who decided to stay on a full realm.  
---
Shut the fuck up and learn some accountability
---
Every trick in the book? I just throw the book at the enemy! If nothing else it serves as a distraction.
---
Sap pulls you out of stealth in classic, unless you are spec'd for it, in which case it can still pull you out of stealth.
---
Tbh portals are easier if you’re not already in a group. Takes a reagent so it’s easier to justify demanding a minimum tip, and it’s one cast that doesn’t take a whole lot of mana.
---
Did not know this, tho he went for res sickness
---
And I never win the rolls on the orbs haha. That’s all good info. I’ll probably go price point for now and get the heavy duty money sinks when I have more permanent equipment. You rock, thanks again.
---
For rogues, T1 and T2 are itemized fine, its more that 0.5 is just OP.
---
I’ve been running these a bit. What’s the best way to reset and re-run the instance? The best I’ve come-up with is stripping down and killing myself, rezing into purple, then going and porting back in.
---
Doing Karazhan for the first time
---
Stop using that word..... its losing all meaning. That was NOT a ninja, no rules were ignored and everyone had a fails shot at the roll, just because you don't like it doesn't mean thats a ninja.
---
Druids can put up a good fight against pretty much everyone but it's really try hard. Lot of kiting, shifting, healing, DoTing, etc.
---
I would love to have this.

Starcraft has /r/allthingsprotoss, /r/allthingszerg, /r/allthingsterran

But World of Warcraft? "lol go join a discord channel"
---
Grumble. Would sub to a CompetitiveClassic subreddit in a heartbeat.
---
If you're burning out at lvl40, then yea no offense but you're too casual of a player. I was so excited when I hit 40, I do remember thinking 'damn another 20 levels to go now' but that was really it. I just kept my grind up. &amp; its not like there werent other milestones along the way either. As a rogue, the 2 best pre best in slot items I could get were the Devilsaur Legs/Gauntlets and they were another mission to save up for (about 230-240g), esp when they were so rare b/c no one had them yet.
---
Point is, lvl40 is 1 milestone. When you hit 1, there's always another. Essentially each milestone keeping you on the grind and busy doing things.
---
You're steppin into GM territory there boi.
---
My guild master will just start Onyxia if stragglers aren't there on time, or if they really need a summon are charged for it to the guild bank. We get a little cut of it, so it's nice. But most people actually show up due to this. 
---
I'd say most of my summoning guildies is bringing them back after they get summoned to turn in hands in Azshara, and I'm ok with that.
---
ye thanks and it says they aren't immune. Mob type says "elemental", so i guess it's just one of those cases of mobs just being immune no matter what as the others mentioned.
---
Or don’t join my dungeon group, I’m pretty clear at the start of every group I tank for
---
Arms is a superior all around choice for a fresh 60. Respec 5min before raid time based on role.
---
Best memory? Killing KT for the first time in naxx 40.
---
The screams on ventrillo still echo to this day.
---
Yeah that’s true. Though they have way more tech to try and prevent that from happening then other classes. Rogue v Hunter is just a really fun matchup that comes down to a game of cat and mouse and whoever catches the other off guard wins lol
---
How much does the AB go for on your server?  
---
I bought my Sword of Zeal for 205g and saw one listed last night for 200g.  The fact that is at least 100g less if not 150/200g less than people ask for Krol Blade while actually being better at 60 is why I used it.
---
Also OP was specifically asking about difference between Thrash/Krol and I wanted to show the difference between them and compare it to a sword that is usually much cheaper while actually being better at 60.
---
The AEP difference between AB and Zeal is pretty big (36 AEP) , and I personally don't think the 7 AEP point difference between the Thrash Blade and the AB is worth the cost vs the free thrash.
---
So wild story, on my mage I’ve gotten freezing band, robes of insight, as well as underworld band all before 50. Never seen so many world drops in my life
---
Sounds like a warlock that doesnt want a raid spot any more.
---
The shards issue is non existent in retail. If you dont want to farm shards then maybe play that. Otherwise that's really what warlocks were for in classic.
---
I'm 29 UD strat runs in, no shadowcraft legs nor cape of the black Baron yet.
---
I feel ya.
---
This is the best kind of shit to post on here.  So keep on posting OP!
---
My thoughts exactly here. It’s such a weird thing to get butt hurt over.
---
feels good to be a mage and able to farm instances for 50-80g an hour and just buy the shit you need
---
Guy kept looting  all the items we needed for a quest. I asked everyone how much they needed and the guy easily lied so he could keep looting. 
---
Later he admitted to it but only after he was the only person who had finished.
---
Nope, check it out. 
---
Frost resist is huge on hydro boss too if you didn't know
---
Well, it was taken with a phone instead of the screenshot feature. Screenshots are higher quality. And the idea that someone is sitting and taking pictures of their screen with a camera in 2019 irks people.
---
I scroll through multiple posts looking to police people for being an ass so I can reply to their comment...you think im cool yet?
---
I agree!
---
of course not. It’s not like you’re master looting once the stuff you want drops. If dps don’t want loot competition, they should run with their guild.
---
I guess you might since you seem more of a PvE player. But I’m more of a PvP player and classic wow doesn’t give a fuck about PvP.
---
So you're scared of a blender?
---
I rest my case.
---
That’s correct. 
---
Well and maybe lava packs, we did back in vanilla but idk if it’s still necessary.
---
Can somebody zone in after killing the king when most of the instance goes yellow? And loot the chest? DO they have to be close before you spawn the chest (and see loot?) Or can you see al lthe loot, then invite anybody to waltz in and grab it?
---
Keep leveling 41+ quests give better gold than 1-40
---
My favorite wow memory was when I single-handedly won a WSG. I was on my rogue (around lv 70) and had already capped the first two flags. I got the third and headed back to the base. The alliance had picked up the flag, but I kept running assuming my team would return it so I could cap. The alliance turtled and my team was unable to return the flag. With the enemy team's flag in hand, I ran to the alliance base, killed the FC with the help of my team, returned the flag, and ran back to base to cap the winning flag. It was glorious.
---
We have a few try hard, but no, most don't try to get world buffed. I'd say we have 3-4 dps pushing 1k (none above it) 2 rogues, 2 warriors. Rogues have vanish though.
---
I'll take a good look at our logs tonight and figure out where were at more definitively.
---
A warlocks job isn't to summon people that don't have the courtesy to show up like everyone else. We summon those that leave for repairs or turn ins, or in certain cases those that literally couldn't make it to raid on time for reasons other than "I didn't feel like traveling"
---
Is she immune to Mocking Blow?
---
It requires you to import fonts that don't come with the addon.
---
Things are getting out of control Lmfao.

In a PUG, BoE gold Is NEED. I'm contributing in the run, I'm 100% entitled to roll Bologna as a Warlock, FFS.

Make fuckin peace with your minds
---
Nopes, prob would be either emerald or azure, I imagine.
---
I was asleep in the game until the final boss of uldaman had a mechanic.  I like the dungeon bosses and following logic to each part of a dungeon.  MC is a boring snooze fest and I cannot wait until honor kills are freed and blackwing layer allows us to wake up out of the eternal slumber of lava packs.
---
Agreed with both. The dungeon 2 quest line is a lot of fun and everyone should get a chance to experience it. Unfortunately, most players will skip it if it comes out in phase 5.
---
And world PvP objectives are just fucking fun.
---
Vis'kag the Bloodletter.
---
&gt; I obsess over character customization.
---
You're in the wrong game, by a long shot. Try City of Heroes: https://forums.homecomingservers.com/
---
To each his own. I wouldn't consider myself a PvPer but I enjoy it. Always something new and you'll need to plan around what happens when one faction dominates one zone. Also you get stupid amounts of gold for pvp consumables in the AH.
---
Wowhead is pretty accurate with this.
---
Big facts
---
Taking someones gear upgrade they need to sell on the AH is the only entitled bullshit here.
---
You should know that even without greater blessings, Might and Kings still deal threat and its improved by RF. So you can use them as a ghetto-hand-of-reckoning for when you invariably run into a douchebag spellcleaver.
---
&gt;players who don’t want to raid or pvp
---
Sounds like they might want to try a different game
---
Had a dwarf paladin I had over a year played time with, full T2/2.5 and had even down a few bosses in Naxx by the time TBC launched.  I always thought horde racials were op in pvp and when blood elf got a silence (freaking aoe even) I was dreading fighting one.
---
Well at lvl 66 in terokkar forest, I run into a 65 BE paladin.  Our fight was legendary.  I knew he was hardcore to have leveled so fast but I knew paladin like the back of my hand.  Both of us ret, we both stunned, bubbled, healed, and auto attacked all over.  But he was overzealous with his mana, now oom all he could do was auto attack and hope for SoC procs.  His stuns were on cd, I toss and heal and- wait silenced?  He has mana back??  I loose to a fresh 65 in all my raid gear; what a noob.  I was so pissed at everything I rage quit and rerolled a BE paladin.
---
This is my favorite memory because I never went back to my dwarf and mained that BE paladin until half way through Cata when I eventually quit WoW.  So many awesome memories I never would have had if that BE didn't silence me in that perfect moment.
---
Dear everyone who likes to bring up "blacklists",
---
This is what you look like, unironically.
---
Haircuts weren’t added until wotlk, try wearing a helmet
---
yet there are a ton of people who are still wiping endlessly on mc and others who find raiding too stressful so they don't even do it
---
I struggle with human rogues more than any other race. perception is so powerful
---
Oh. Thats horrible.
---
You seem to be taking my words pretty personally. Do you wanna talk about this some more or are you gonna be able to cope?
---
Oh? I thought Vanas Kos was just for making KOS lists. Didn't realize you could add detailed notes for allied characters.
---
I play a dk and main spec is blood. So yeah i can wreck him, ally for the win
---
Right, break up the guild in an attempt to transfer servers only to end up on a server that's equally shitty in completely different ways.
---
Good suggestion, if only we were smart enough to think of that!
---
I guess that makes sense! Good to know
---
Are you on a small server or something? My server theres probably 2-3 pugs every night doing it
---
&gt;I just flat out disagree with this.  Every single top guild right now is using fury/prot to maximize TPS.  I'm the biggest feral fanboy I know of, but facts are facts.
---
Okay. I don't agree then. I don't think you can blindly say "because the best guilds do this, then it's the best" - Otherwise they wouldn't use hunters for over a majority of Vanilla content or stacking as 'few' Fury Warriors as these guilds are doing. Yet here we are with guilds doing exactly that, even the best.
---
Yah hunter is the only one I 100% enjoy. I try other classes and like them fine but I always main hunter.
---
Wasn't trying to nitpick man just add to ur great post.  
---
AB is about 28g atm mine.  So hard to say no even if just a filler slot tbh. :)
---
Go watch TV.
---
You'll have to dig deeper and read up on er, but I haven't had to use the addon myself yet
---
Maybe not in 2019. On Earth.
---
You pretty much nailed it.
---
You’re the kind of guy who goes and complains to a guild about a member’s actions? Never thought I’d meet a Karen in WOW.
---
When you have all your dots on target, have banished them, and they're still looking to fight. Slap em with the ol' burney. At rank 1 it's going to do at least 700 damage. Over 1000 damage if it crits with curse of element on.
---
Now, I'll say this: The times I've used it in PvP have been limited to mages who've spent their aresenal, have curse of tongues on them, are in a downtime, and I can just keep pouring spells on.
---
Fire resist, like all resists, is notably hard for a lot of players to acquire. If they have a full duration agony, corruption, immolate, and a shadow bolt or two on them and aren't already running (or foolishly still thinking they have a chance), they're likely to have put consumables on CD. Even if the encounter kind of deadlocks, where they're around half HP and you're around HP - you having a spell like this in your back pocket will catch most players by surprise.
---
I am SM-Ruin (54 right now). Within 5-10 seconds all of the following go out:
---
Curse of Agony
---
Immolate
---
Siphon Life
---
Shadowbolt
---
Between just these spells alone the enemy player should be thinking they bit off more than they can chew. If you have succubus out, when they're charmed, you're casting a long CD like Soul Fire. It's just too much for almost any class other than another lock or a paladin. I will say if a warrior or rogue is already on top of you, you need to focus on creating distance with Fears.
---
Imagine being so broke in wow that you ruin your reputation for a boe worth 70g.
---
Need a frost mage for that burn lol
---
I heard hello kitty island adventure is fun.
---
Something I used in BC when this was an issue. "Alright, I'm not getting enough rage because I'm not taking enough damage.  I'm taking my pants off."  Pants have the largest stat budget after a chest piece and taking them off increases the amount of damage you take by a lot.  If you can do it without dying, it's a great way to teach dps that are paying attention AT ALL that you need to get hit.  Most of them can figure out that they are part of the problem.
---
Additionally, if physical damage dealers are the problem, figure out what they are targeting, and don't sunder it (which increases their damage output).  Let them tank it for a hit or 2, at which point they'll probably swap to whatever has the most sunder armors on it.
---
It did not. This was my biggest value drop so far as a level 50 Hunter with very limited availability. From a Reinforced Steel Lockbox.
---
When BFA is done I will play it for like a week just to do all the quests / lore once and then I will go back to classic lol
---
Areyou sure? Because this is the options I have in mine:  [https://imgur.com/a/rXKs34q](https://imgur.com/a/rXKs34q)
---
I think these things should all be need rolled on if BOE by everyone.  It may not be equipabble but I can turn it to gold and buy the equivalent item for me.
---
BiS gear is for PVE damage, it's usually pretty bad for PVP unless you can burn them down before they have a chance to damage you. 
---
Your main PVP stats as a caster are usually going to be int/stamina.
---
The free heals are just too good to give up with illumination though. Then divine favor and holy power combo extremely well. Guaranteed crit max rank holy light is a full heal on the tank, as well as a bunch of my flashes being refunded when they crit.
---
Giving up tanking for now is definitely a high price to pay, but it won't be long until I can swap some talents around and do both. But being holy I can carry some downright awful groups.
---
My favorite classic memory was when myself and 3 IRL friends Lanned and all rerolled new chars on a brand new server. We stayed up for about 48 hours nourishing ourselves with Little Caesars, Monster Energy, Doritos, and of course Mt. Dew. Probably not a very unique story, but I'm sure y'all can relate :).
---
Was fishing in Hillsbrad when a Tauren hunter pulls up next to me and starts fishing as well. I'm a Night Elf Rogue. We both fished up for a few minutes when he bows and emotes goodbye. It was such a simple interaction but I've held that memory with me all the way through hitting 60!
---
I recommend trying to get the buffs you can as tank. DMT and songflower are real easy to get.
---
You will easily hold aggro in prot, even easier with those buffs. Yea it sucks when you die, but the feeling of world buffed warrior is just amazing.
---
You should be able to hold over 1k dps as deep prot .  I like 14/5/32.
---
F
---
You tried playing Diablo 3?
---
oh just shut up already, you're just being a baby and you clearly can't help yourself. people have already pointed out that server xfers were available before the game event went live and blizzard encouraged people to take advantage of them. there wasn't a single server from the initial list that didn't have xfers available before launch.
---
stop all your fucking crying and grow up and accept that you fucked up and now you're stuck with your poor decision making. This is no one's fault but your own.
---
Experiencing the transition from barrens to ashenvale the first time
---
I completely agree that everyone should be there and ready, but that's never the case. I think you should just accept that maybe you should bring 80 shards instead of 40 if your guild is lazy and wants a lot of summons.
---
Thats the whole point of phase 2. nothing is stopping people from ganking/griefing right now, or in any other phase
---
Im fairly certain spell batching as we have it today isnt tied to the server tickrate.
---
2 sided. I hate people who take their privilege to entertain themselves somewhere as lock will summon. But at the same time, you choose your class. I play mage and I have to make 300-500 water bottles, 10 per cast.  Guess what, it's annoying too but I'm ok with that as it benefits me too.
---
Still trying to get truestrike shoulders from UBRS. Out of 40 runs I’ve seen it drop 4 times. 
---
(Run #7)First time I just lost the roll to a few other people, no big deal I’ll get it next time.
---
(Run #11)Drops again a few runs later, lose it to a 58 rogue who just joined last second as the only other person who needed it... kinda annoying but whatever I’ll get it eventually.
---
(Run #28)Third time the group composition is looking good, in the only person who needs truestrike and we’re clearing the orc packs quickly. As we approach the hallway leading to emberstrife’s room a rogue joins the raid out of no where. He’s not in the instance yet but we’re clearing fine so we continue on and start the encounter. Rogue makes it in and as he gets close we kill emberstrife and truestrike drops. He rolls and wins it without clearing anything or doing any damage to the boss. Ok now I’m getting fed up.
---
(Run #39)Last time I see it again when just me and a 58 rogue need it. I loss the roll of course and now I have a irrational hatred towards 58 rogues. 
---
Seems a lot less than 14% drop rate but I’ve gotten lucky in other ways so I’m not really complaining but damn, this one item continues to elude me.
---
Eh at one point my raid group had 7 hunters in it but that was early when we just needed bodies.  But it was still stunning to see 7 of them lmao.
---
That or find a better guild
---
Mate... His comment are more in line with them making excuses why its lagging and not trying to fix it. It is possible to have that many players in an area (PRIVATE garage server kids were able to). Server size says nothing when there are queues, this is what blizzard made. And they can't handle it.
---
My plan is to stay 31/5/15 at least until I'm done open world quests.  Those last few points in prot are important for tanking though: gives Last Stand, Improved Shield Block, and Defiance.  
---
The Fight Club discord FAQ says not to bother respeccing prot until your first raid.
---
Gnomish engineering MC is different. It makes your target behave like a pet rather than grant you actual control.
---
It's hard to choose just one, but one of my favorite WoW memories was getting Bloodlord's raptor as a dwarf warrior in burning crusade. It is one of my favorite mounts in the game, especially as an alliance!
---
One person bitches and more bitch just to be cool.
---
You have to learn to keep your stock up at all times.  It's just part of the class that you have to learn to manage.  I'll say its not difficult once you get used to it and you should rarely find yourself yourself in a jam.  For raid nights I do often spent a bit of time topping off up to ~35 when I normally only carry ~20, but its not a huge deal and you can think a bit ahead before raid night. 
---
There are rare circumstances when your stock should really fall significantly.  Summs for raid and initial healthstone hand outs are one, and that's why its better to try to get an extra few than normal for raid night.
---
its not cool with a lot of melees as you dont have single target aggro and have to drink a lot. but really works well with spellcleaves
---
Were also in patch 1.12 which was the patch right 4 BC expansion so were kind of at the tip top shape of what Vanilla WoW was at.
---
OK thanks!
---
This.... If someone wispers me with "can i get food/water" i dont repond most of the time. If the write:" hey can i get 120 water for 2g tg " they get an instant trade :D
---
I used to farm BRD on private servers. Im not 60 yet on classic so I'm not sure if its doable or not. This guy Ercot(i think?) made some video guides for it a few years ago
---
Thats what im saying
---
ShareX is a thing \^\^  
---
also Grats i guess? \^\^
---
Yep you can set nice lists and hate lists with detailed notes for same faction. You can set it to alert you when that player is nearby.
---
...which changes nothing, because Paladins have the best sustained AoE threat with Consecrate and reflect damage. They don't need to cast blessings to hold threat.
---
It's nice to bring this to everyone's attention because it could be situationally useful. But in the grand scheme of things, this doesn't change anything.
---
druids fuck my world up if I can't open. even if I can tho sometimes lmao 
---
I hate skilled druids dudes just relax ok
---
LOL i would have pulled the whole instance then ALT F4'ed
---
That sucks man. Horde on Krum has a lot of FFA. A few hard core guilds do DKP/ loot council but it's not in the majority
---
Okay that's fuckin awesome, and kudos on ur marriage!
---
Damn, how long did it take?
---
Now make a shaman
---
Congrats mate. This is amazing!
---
Very good explanation although I would love to see like a DPS comparison between full prebis(or bis) with 100% accuracy heroic strike queueing and 6% hitcap etc. versus normal playstyle with uysing heroic strike at last second to simulate how it was on pservers
---
&gt; server xfers were available before the game event went live 
---
Uhhhh, no shit? I already said we followed Blizzard's advice and left Herod for one of the newer **recommended** servers, but that still ended up being overpopulated.
---
Wanna try again or are you finally ready to admit you have no clue what you're talking about?
---
Lmfao , idgaf about 12 yo kids rants.
---
I am running with the group , I have the RIGHT to roll for the reward, like you have the RIGHT to roll on my class boe stuff. Period.
---
Remember where you are. Just mentioning things is 'flexing' now :/
---
I wonder if math supports your 2 points in Impale instead of 2 points in Cruelty.
---
*Laughs in Stoneform*
---
Only if you dont actually use it. Look at the shortcuts you can use it for, you'll find it's actually pretty useful.
---
How does it cost 3g to summo  someone?
---
Sell the WoW gold and boom IRL rich as well
---
It is not , people are butthurt.
---
They believe I won't need on Foror cause it's their "bis". I can sell that shit and buy my own bis, jfc . BOE are valued in Gold, so everyone needs Gold, so everyone Need , period.
---
Yeah... except, I need my raid with me to play the game. So if he isn't going to do one of the warlocks classes jobs, I'm not going bring him.
---
A bunch of unemployed euros hosted servers with less lag than this
---
Right. And then if no one needs on the item, roll for OS. But MS &gt; OS always.
---
I use Judgements guide coupled with the GuideMe add on, free and very comprehensive
---
Omfg you just mindfucked me
---
Edit: Where can I learn more of this hidden Windows Sorcery.
---
 Incendius has a good pop and is very even horde/alliance ratio, lots of very skilled players as well.
---
&gt; Why not fix some bugs, why not give some form of QoL a chance which were obvious shit decisions even back then?
---
I think its because there are a lot of things people would want changed. 
---
"We are keeping it this way because thats how original WoW works" is easy to explain and hasn't made anyone too upset.
---
But if they make changes, the floodgates of complaints will open. People will want specs rebalanced, honor system reworked, gear itemization fixed, AH reworked, etc.
---
Thats a lot to do, and there will be just as many complaints about whatever fix Blizzard implements.
---
Totally fine but announce that at the start to avoid issues.
---
Yeah. I've never watched their streams once but I'd assume they have fury tanks so threat is barely an issue. Could be wrong.
---
The mobs would interrupt my healing casts for about 7-10 seconds and I was the only healer in the raid. They have shield bash (or whatever their skill is called).
---
interesting content and an emphasis on human interaction. 
---
We know those will never happen. Filthy casuals.
---
With the hunter's dead zone for shooting, I don't think you can protect both you and your pet with your flare. So take your pick: I can Ambush your pet and the mobs and I can take turns stabbing your back, or I can stun lock you to death. Both are extremely gratifying to me.
---
Yep, there is nothing you can do but sit there and take it.
---
Just use lightshot. 100% needed by everyone imo
---
Cheaper respec  =/= switching on the fly. I think its stupid to have an increasing cost of respec. I'm not saying allow dual specializations and the ability to switch anytime. Just why have it ramp up so much. You must play a class that does'nt require you to respec for different content. I'm assuming you're a hunter or some shit. As a mage its bullshit, Dungeons, Raid, PVP are 3 separate specs . Its like you have to pick one and only do that one piece of content instead of enjoying all aspects of the game. My repsec is at 35g right now. I raid on Wednesday so i probably wont even login until raid day because I'm not able to do anything other than raid in this spec. Probably the main reason I'm not going to be able to PVP and raid at the same time
---
I won't "leave" classic, but retail can get me to spend a lot more time in it if they'll go back to a satisfying gameplay loop, stop jamming unneeded extra systems like Azerite into the mix, make the story satisfying, and stop gating things like races behind reputation walls.
---
&gt; Last night I arrived at onyxia an hour before raid start
---
&gt;because our shards are finite and annoying to collect.
---
Have you considered that instead of afking at Onyxia an hour before the raid starts, you could try farming extra shards instead?
---
Find a competent dps that won't roll on the same items as you to keep the other dps in line, and you are fine.  Or do it with a guild.  Or find a good healer.  **Don't** start your tanking experience by just running with pugs all the time unless you actively enjoy the idea of herding ants.
---
I was once a fool, and lent a friend 65 gold for his mount. He never repaid it, and transferred to another server.
---
Then when the next friend obnoxiously asked for mount money, my reply in return wasn't the most diplomatic and dare I say cast a shadow on the English language.
---
That priest not being in Dustwallow is irking me more than it should....
---
You don't need to be resto to heal leveling dungeons and there are few solo quests at 60,
---
Please don't misunderstand: we're not doing it solely because the best guilds are doing it, we're doing it because it produces excellent results.  That's why I asked one of the previous posters to show me his logs, because I really want to see some numbers back up this theorycrafting.  Until I see some hard numbers to support running a feral in full threat gear over a fury/prot, I'm just not buying into it.
---
I know this is somewhat unrelated, but there is also excellent reason to keep a few hunters in the raid throughout Vanilla even though their DPS drops off heavily after MC/Ony: you need at least two Tranqs with a potential 3rd as a failsafe.
---
Immovable wall
---
Do mages have to kill kill mobs to create food and water?
---
Just hanging out. 
---
I never hit the level cap in vanilla. 
---
I really just hung out and made gold, and chatted with guildies. 
---
Those were great times.
---
Everyone needs on every boe/consumable blue/purple.
---
That's the solution.
---
Damn kid is sending people to the cornfield again
---
Chill a bit, get your professions up, do some dungeons (remember the quests). 
---
I find that buying some gear also motivates me to level, many boe t0 set pieces are cheap and can be used on the early 50s.
---
Already have herb maxed so that's good to know!
---
Finally someone with common sense.
---
to be kiiiiiing!
---
Take your attitude back to the Computer Mouse review subreddit nerd
---
Why was it deleted!
---
Beating MC for the first time - took so much work and cooperation with people from around the world.
---
I feel you.. I thought I was going crazy
---
Just do a full run and get the key, it's not hard. Way easier than the Scholo and UBRS keys.
---
I'm over 200 runs, another hunter in my guild is well over 400. Neither have it yet. In my 200 runs i've seen the boss under 10 times.
---
It was stated that in classic, there are classes that don't have crowd control. That information is false and I decided to challenge it. If you think that it's ok to spread false information, then you do you dude. I play both, nice try though. Get that classic wow dick out of your mouth and stop being completely biased.
---
Your last character name upsets me.
---
The way raid tiers work in classic is very different from how they work nowadays. A new tier being released doesn't make the old one obsolete. MC and Ony will be relevant to most people/guilds for a very long time, so don't stress about it too much.
---
My advice would be to actually stop going for your mount. Level Alchemy to 275, learn how to transmute Arcanite bars. This will obviously take you a lot longer to get your mount but you'll probably profit 30-50g more this way by getting your transmute cooldowns rolling earlier.
---
This advice is coming from a Druid though who didn't really give a rats about my mount :) I got mine at 45 haha
---
How exactly are world bosses supposed to work?
---
And why is a free private server with 13k players online at the same time hosted in russia able to handle this with absolutely zero issues while Blizzard can't handle it?
---
I don't care if it's because they're using BFA server technology or whatever, it's fucking dogshit. Maybe it works when you have 7 players for every shard of the server or whatever, but it clearly doesn't work for an actual MMO.
---
Sure they could get better.
---
But they can also just quit.
---
Its weird that you think that means the hunter is "scared." Are you scared because you use stuns and other forms of cc? Are you scared because you use Free Action Potions? Are you scared because you use your class abilities to try to counterplay the enemy player?
---
I dont know man
---
Salute
---
"Please let me pull"
---
"Please let me pull, 2nd time"
---
"That's it, I'm bailing out"
---
I never had to ask for a second time
---
A good portion of WoW's user base are the nonconfrontational types.
---
If you leave they'll think you were the problem.
---
You have to be the class though and its 1 time hand in. Paladins should definitely buy @ 50s though!
---
Not edited actually, it's a bit different than the eyes but sky is legit purple/pink cos something about the sun and stuff
---
The fact that it isn't strikingly obvious to you which one is better for an ORC, AXE SPECCED warrior is a bit worrisome.
---
You're going to replace either of them in days anyways, so what is the point of this thread? Equip a spiked dildo bat for all we care.
---
aye aye, I always roll last, especially when I'm looking to roll on something for my offspec.
---
Always roll last. ALWAYS.
---
It was really good for a few bosses that you can debuff with doomguard. Otherwise fun or funny in PvP.
---
nice ...
---
My guildies do these things all the time, they will roll black diamond(the rare quality one) and tell us he needs for mount quest, and people rolling high value materials telling us they need to craft this or enchant that...i mean they are all boe, I dont know the rule anymore, but at least i won’t do it even if I desperately need it
---
He’s also talking about folks who have been on for a half hour or more and haven’t started getting to the raid
---
Princess is 51, so yes.  I go by boss minus 2 or 3.  So 48 or 49 to tank all of that one.
---
Yea, I get where you're coming from. I think the reason I just don't get it is because I've never - ever - had to pay a service charge for tank, so I don't understand why anyone else would have to - at least on my server/faction. Maybe it's just different for other players, based on their role, server, faction, what hours they play etc.
---
I also think it's reasonable if you're going there and you already have all the gear you need, both MS and OS, but there are many tanks expecting payment when they're still going there looking for gear. That shit is infuriating.
---
This happened back in vanilla aswell I can tell you. Still dumb though.
---
A bunch of volunteer euros hosted community funded servers using a OPENSOURCE servercore that has been passed down through several different serverhosts and with higher population  and no layering with less lag than this\*
---
The tank is the head of the body, and the healer is the neck.  The neck controls the head.
---
I played a hunter, it comes from being scared. That's why I'm a rogue not, there's no convincing me otherwise
---
Cool, doesn't change my opinion.
---
Absolutely! People should feel like their weapon is WORTHY of the investment, as much as the player is!
---
Look forward to seeing your shiny powerful weapon with crusader on it! Good luck with drops!
---
The one time I would strongly doubt that he does, would be if he said things like "dude I'm ooooooold, I'm 30". 
---
Sure you are, sonny. Try being 45 like me.
---
"guys I need to drop group my wife is giving birth."
---
It's great. It feels like less of a chore leveling an alt because I can work on Loremaster
---
My interpretation is that the tank was most likely rage leading people who were more experienced.  They found his behavior funny, so they followed his instructions precisely and targeted skull with their speeds.
---
You probably think that because the tooltip specifically says it prevents the target from stealthing but this is World of Roguecraft.  Don't worry you can always use Track Hidden to see that stealthed rogue...
---
It's fine to roll on one main spec even if it's not your current spec. If a feral druid announces at the start that he needs to build his resto set and the healer is cool with it, fine. But he doesn't get to roll need on feral gear over the rogue. Pick one and stick with it. Then feel free to grab stuff no one else needs but you can't roll need on more than one spec over others in the group.  The way to avoid this is to make sure you have no loot competition in group, then you can roll on everything.
---
Need the key. Thats easy enough to get though. You farm the arena spectators and that big main room with the dwarves and dogs. It was a decent way to make gold on pservers but like I said, not sure if its any different on here or if it works
---
Dustwallow Marsh, where the Senpai go to die

Will you tap in to the magic of said well without restraint and attract an army of demons to my door?
---
As a married person, can confirm: this is a an extremely jerk thing to do. Husbands don't do this for your wives. Wives, don't do this for your husbands.
---
Drowing my Paladin in the lake behind the Lions Pride Inn because my Warlock gamer-GF was giving the endless-breath buff to another guy.
---
A coordinated raid is incredibly strong. 20 players working together can destroy 80+ random pugs.
---
What about the fact that shards require time farming to make?
---
Idk maybe if you spent half a second to think about it even your tiny peanut brain could figure it out.
---
Go back to retail. You can advance in the game without raiding. Just click LFR, do some dailies when you login. You will see all the end game and PvP without commiting.
---
fuck these nerds. they need YOU, you dont need them. you can get another group who can play better instantly. when this happens i tell them that if they keep going ill remove them and replace them with one of the 1000 dps standing outside who will play properly. if the group wants to cry i just leave and let them keep their friend and find a new tank.
---
tldr: aint nobody got time for that. leave, let them deal with the consequences of their actions.
---
lol You really think wow classic is hard lmaoo. Its easier than retail my dude. MC is basically a Normal Raid from retail but simpler. I've been raiding MC for a couple weeks and am kind of shocked at the lack of difficulty. I can't even think of a fight thats not a tank and spank
---
If you are a tank you can basically make your own group for anything.  Let them know, then there is nothing they can say.
---
How are you able to run into the deadzone of a Hunter unless they stand still?
---
I'm not gonna explain to you why Layering is bad. There are enough posts on forums and on this sub itself to find out why it's a terrible idea to implement in Classic.  
---
Are you saying Blizzard and their decisions aren't the cause of all these problems?
---
I acquired a priest dire maul book during one of my solo DM runs and was advertising it in trade chat. A guildie priest messaged me asking if I could give him a discount, and I offered it to him for 50g (normally sells for 100g+). He said oh nvm.. making me feel like I was wrong for not just outright giving it to him. Should I be expected to give items like this to guildmates for free? Like our guild is huge with 100+ people; am I an asshole for wanting to get something for my hours of farming rather than giving it for free just because we're in the same guild?
---
" This is on top of the fact that raiding in vanilla needs only 4 out of 40 people to be a tanks to cover 99% of all raid encounters, 1 in 10 ratio, while dungeons require a 1 in 5 ratio for tanking. This leaves 50% of tanks unable to raid as a tank ever and need to go dps."  
---
If you have pre-BIS or raid level gear, you can tank 5-mans just fine as Fury/Arms.  The mob health and damage does not scale.
---
NTA
---
I see this type of stuff on my classic server too. LFG/Trade constantly has people creating some wierd interpretation of the world, just so they can have a freak out session over nothing. 
---
This person slid into your game and DMs looking for a problem, while you were minding your own business.
---
Awesome, me too!
---
A BoE is a gear upgrade for anyone that gets it.  If a warden staff drops, should it automatically go to the feral druid cos they can use it?  That same warden staff has the same value to the entire group regardless of whether or not it is going to be equipped.
---
That's true. I assume the same.
---
I was Handoraka, a tauren warrior on Feralas. This was my first toon ever. I didn't even know there were other class options, just picked the first class I saw. 
---
Somehow I managed to get that sweet, sweet whirlwind axe but still was awful at pvp. I told my friend that warriors were terrible and he said to ket him hve a try. He proceeded to DESTROY my WSG bracket. Hamstring, hamstring was the key.
---
Unless you really just want the sword I would continue to level with quests or do dungeons your own level. You’ll find something better than cruel barb doing normal lvl 30 stuff
---
AoE can sort of work through warriors as well, but my understanding is that it's closer to something like them tab-targetting various mobs and progressively applying sunder armor on them. Quick AoE teams with paladins are definitely possible (and honestly most paladins I've met loathe healing compared to tanking or DPS), and it seems possible with warriors too though much more care must be taken.
---
I'm Kandle, and I have rope. I take you.
---
Hahaha
---
What an awesome read. I got guilted into playing on a normal server with friends who have almost all quit. Stories like this made me regret it so much I rerolled on a PvP server, but not without making sure there was a faction balance.
---
I have so much to do, but I don't feel like I have to do anything.
---
Oh, ok. I thought that your comment was relevant to the context of my comments. My bad.
---
If you're BM you should just ride your pet.
---
Every class has an autoattack too. I can’t handle this lack of class identity /s
---
Great experience, fix yo shit blizzard
---
I call it tank momentum, when all your pulls are smooth, dps is focused and you keep a good eye on mana so theres little down time. All it takes is one person to ruin it by trying to pull, trying to do much side stuff, aoe spam, and just rush. It’s also annoying when they’re on some strict time schedule and give themselves 30 mins to do a 1hr + dungeon, it usually takes 30 mins alone for everyone to get to the entrance.
---
Man I got the recipe that transmutes the undead essence to water. Was nice and sold it to a guildie for 150g, but that I know that shit was worth 300. Dont regret selling it to him just jealous of the money he can make.
---
12 - 13k player peaks and this never happened in massive pvp. Go look up APES pvp videos. I am not saying private servers had as many players, but then again, they ran on donations.   
---
Honestly we are able to hold Blizzard to higher standards when it comes to stability, than what they are offering at the moment.
---
I bought that book for like 9 gold lmao.
---
Do you have to sword,/board at all or do you dual weild the whole thing?
---
No, well played he wont be a dick again that's for sure.
---
69g 420 s
---
thats kew
---
&gt;  If you can raid MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 you don't need tier 0.5
---
0.5 is on par with T2 for a lot of classes and its much easier to get
---
Yes
---
The dude you're replying to is in every thread regarding rolling performing the same mental gymnastics.
---
Don't get sucked in, dude is crazy lol
---
I play horde and can say alliance also share in this sin.

If I ever wanted to satire the ridiculousness of the classic #nochanges mindset, I'd just copy and paste this.    Classic is not the best nor most popular version of the game if you're using subs as a metric.   That distinction goes to either Wrath (most sustained subs, way more than classic) or TBC (most growth).  Classic was a rushed first attempt with a lot of big mistakes that the next two expansions fixed.
---
Not at all, personal responsibility is a big part of classic
---
Make sure you put that note in the bank
---
I saw all the time
---
Its funny to me how people always said "bad behavior will make your name known on the server and you will get punished for it" but then they blur out all the names here as if they are real contact info. lmfao its so dumb
---
Why do people write these 10k word fake stories jfc
---
If people at parties are just repeating the same things that have been said over and over in hopes people like them as much as the person who originally said it... Then no probably not..
---
Now wait just a damn second. Are you using V's instead of w's?
---
Dude, I'm really sorry for the late reply. I started it when I was 55 Prot Paladin. No bosses, just 13minutes and reset. The densest orcs are at the beginning, dont forget the ones upstairs. If you get to the bridge before you reset thats about 60k/hr, to the ogres before reset is about 75k/hr, but thats moving FAST.
---
It’s fun to do to Rogues. Because it’s also fun watching the realize that they got baited into attacking while another 2 shadow melded hunters and their stealth cats are within kill range.
---
I'm pretty anal about initial threat and pulling for me unless asked, I'd say you were perfectly in your position to do that.
---
Good luck trying to sell a bind on pickup item there ...
---
I'm sad this is a sword. Daggers are usable by so many more caster classes ...
---
If you "obsess over character customization" you should give CoH a look.  It's character creator customization option was beyond legendary. The most variable characters of any game ever made. I know a guy who spent over *two weeks* tweaking his character to be just exactly how he wanted it.
---
I'm playing a tank myself aswell.. why didn't you just pull faster? Especially with mages you waste a lot of time if you only pull 2-4 mobs per pull because their AoE isn't capped on how many targets they can hit so its more mana efficient and overall faster if you pull more. If people pull more mobs, i tank them aswell. If i go down, they are at fault. If we live, we are faster.. how is that so hard to understand, why is every tank thinking they are better than everyone else and lead the group.. its idiotic.. even if the healer pulls because he doesn't wanna type it out right now or whatever, i can clearly see that its taking too long for him or that i should pull more more and i will do so. Why not just reflect a bit and improve your playstyle instead of always immidiately bashing dps and healers because other circlejerkers say you are oh so important.. literally every warrior can just masstaunt or go defensive stance to tank mobs in dungeons.
---
Yuppers
---
That's a tough question, and probably doesn't have a single best answer. It may depend on how you plan to use your pet and what dungeon you're looking to solo.
---
If you're going for runs like Mara or DM where you have to kite your target for a long time, cat or other DPS based pet is probably best, because you want their DPS not tanking ability.
---
If you want to try to have your pet tank the trash while you kill it, a boar or gorilla would be my go-to. The boar because of the added hp and armor, the gorilla because it has an AoE that actually generates threat. I've been able to use multishot after a single gorilla stomp and the mobs remain on the gorilla without him having use growl. 
---
I think the best results for soloing 5 man content is to kite the boss and try to avoid the trash entirely, which would suggest that a high dps pet is the way to go.
---
I am by no means an expert in soloing 5 man content. There are posts here on reddit about soloing DM or Mara, I would probably study those if that's your plan.
---
Or warrior rogues literally make it easy for a warrior to kill them thanks to warriors overpower move
---
I don’t play a mage but my understanding is mana pool is king for AOE and only if you’re dying on the initial pull would you prioritize stamina. Round up the mobs, ice block into iceshield/frost nova and blink. Most mages die to oom depending on what lvl mobs they are fighting
---
I have one rule. Free lockpicking for lower levels, 1 gold each 225 lockbox. If you are too stingy to pay for it, go ahead and waste more than 10 g worth amount of time looking for someone else. I always tip my enchanters as well. Rogue characters aren't made with 225 lockpicking +
---
Yeah, they had more.
---
To get full Tier 1 from MC is reasonably going to take 30-40 raids. For most groups, thats a good 100+ hours of raiding spreading over 9 months.
---
0.5 is faster than that.
---
If you so desire, it shall be done, and they will serve under your command!
---
When on my lock I purposely show up late.
---
I wish this macro worked for me.
---
Not at 27 you don’t.
---
BoP + buffing
---
if you dont understand to roll need on valuable BOE items its your own fault, stop crying.
---
So I'm currently at 150 on my Fishing skill, catching about 4 fish to gain one skill point (currently in Redridge). Is there anything I can do to speed up this up?
---
Agreed as a Hunter, our T1 is complete garbage and a noob trap. Pets don’t scale after 60, why would I waste my time keeping it alive or buffed and why do we need a tiny AoE buff when the class specializes in ranged single target dmg? 
---
 Would rather use 0.5 in a heartbeat. We already become glorified tranq bots in later phases, With other classes able to 3-5x our DPS. Purely because of class design, gear options and a worthless pet that’ll easily get one shot and doesn’t even do 10% of our total dmg. 
---
 Serious hunters better start making friends and suck dick now cause oh boy, There’s only 1, maybe 2 slots for hunters per raid. Everyone (especially now) will rather have another of any class instead of god forbid 3 hunters in one Naxx.
---
 I enjoy this class, It calls to me, I prefer to main it, AND I’m pretty sure I’ve secured myself as a raider but even then I regret rolling Hunter sometimes.
---
Only if you have the rage for it.
---
Earthbind totem

Playing Scholo with my dad back in 06 and he finally got the headmaster's charge after we ran that dungeon over 100 times.  Good times
---
I am a warrior who tanks 5man and speaks from experience. When I am a leader of the group (99% of the time) I kick whoever doesn't listens to my kind warning and I have the replacement in 2-3 mins of looking and 5-10 mins of them going to dungeon since I choose the one closest to me.
---
When I am not the leader either they listen to what I say or they spout a bunch of curses then leave themselves. I watch their online in friendlist for the couple of days and some of them being offline for 3-4 straight later gives me reassurance reports for language do work as well.
---
I think the 20% int buff is off base stats but I'm unsure. It may scale with gear.
---
But the higher your mana pool (int) the more spirit will benefit you.
---
This is relatively normal, it wasn't much better in vanilla, no changes!
---
Fairbanks horde bunch of guilds or join our guild great player base
---
Straya? That you?
---
I did it with 3 players but solo would be pretty impossible I think
---
Good that you know the solution now then.
---
It looks like i'm no longer needed here.
---
This sounds like something you need to address with your guild leadership, and if they won't address it, consider finding a new guild.
---
I love the Rock Paper Scissors of classic wow. As a warlock I try really hard to not step on the toes of warriors and priests, but mostly warriors. The other day I got jumped by a skulls hunter then proceeded to camp him three kills in a row before he lucked out and chain resisted my fear.
---
COH is fun!  And I always liked the lack of gearing and loot systems. Nobody whining about ninjas and who gets what first and all that childish nonsense. Also no grinding to get a certain piece so you can xmog and make the look you want. 
---
But if the guy wants to "obsess over character customization" that is far and away the best game to do it in.
---
So it begins...
---
What's the roll 101-101?
---
They had more players on one server than blizzard does on any of their servers. Obviously the total population is higher in classic, but pservers had 8k pop on ONE server with no layering, without it lagging in pvp like this. It did become kinda similarly laggy at 12-13k
---
The /assist macro will get you closer to the main skull target than trying to mouse click through the pack or just starting with tabbing.
---
If the assist macro doesn't land on skull it's usually only 1 or 2 tab presses away.
---
Type in guild chat and ask if someone can make you water... I do it every time someone asks me. When someone on my friends list asks me for water, I will usually port to Org and give it to them too. Really not that hard to get mage water unless you don't want to talk to people...
---
I always tell people before hand to roll need on all boe blues and purps.  If loot wasn’t established before hand I’m waiting until the last person hits greed before hitting it myself, and if that timer gets a little too close I’m hitting need and hopefully winning it to re-roll it to everyone else.
---
It’s so easy to avoid getting loot jacked by some asshole but for some reason everyone always instantly hits greed on expensive BOEs even if they actually need it.
---
I was in STV for the skull of impending doom quest line. There were a bunch of Horde near the spawn and I didn’t want any trouble. After joke of them attacked me I Mind Controlled one and buffed him. Then everyone else in his group let em do the same. I was still waiting for the respawn when a new hordie showed up and started attacking me. The horde I had buffed convinced him to stop so I buffed him too. They all waited for the mob  to spawn and for me to tag it before helping me kill him. It was amazing. I RP as a priest who sees the light in everyone so to see this experience in WoW was magical
---
If you drink alcohol it will feel like you're fishing faster.
---
Hasn’t been said yet but Halloween bags are 16 slot BOP non unique and can be farmed from lvl 55+ demons and undead. Low drop chance but better than spending 20-30g per travelers imo only because they look cooler
---
Thank you very much, I'll look into that.
---
People bashed WoD so hard for this, yet love it for Classic.
---
Nooooooo lol
---

Wiped in DM north because my group didn't want to kill one of the patrols of one ogre and 3 dogs. I picked it up because it was marked skull, but the lead only marked it to avoid it (unbeknownst to me). So instead of killing, they ran all over the place and eventually aggroed the guard and had to wipe. That run did not go very far. Needless to say the guy in charge is on my black list.
---
Crank ball.
---
As a Tank, please dont target what i am targeting, target the skull. I could be tab sundering, or taunting a runner back, any number of things.
---
Did you configure that via WeakAuras or is it a standalone mod?
---
Sword of zeal is cheaper and better than krols. It's also better than dal rend mh without the set bonus.
---
It's just really hard to find. I checked the AH for one every day after I hit 60 and just found one about 5 days ago.
---
You can trade it for up to two hours to anyone that was in the raid at the time of kill. I believe that user whispering op was in the raid.
---
For me layering is gone, I knew this day would come.  I was given an out and decided I liked my server.  If you don't like your server you should go to another one and Blizzard made that process very easy and absolutely free.
---
??? You can trade it for 2hrs
---
Well its both of course, because supply and demand is how price is determined.
---
The point though is that all the zones are farmed to near capacity nearly 24/7 with a few off hours per day per server being the exception.
---
That means that your farming is limited. Prices go up but how do you earn the money? Doesn't matter where you farm because there's people everywhere farming everything. The mobs are limited.
---
Port uc I'm right behind you
---
I think what OP is saying, and other people are agreeing with, is that being on and ready means showing up at the raid before the specified time. If someone is on a different continent for an hour before the raid, waits until the raid is about to start, and then asks for a summon, doesn't seem like someone whos ready to go.
---
I agree that OP is kind of blowing it out of proportion, but I think it's fair to expect people to be at the raid on time and not asking for a summon if it's possible to be on time without one.
---
Ally priests get fear ward.
---
Thrash is better than assassination.

So, Last week I leveled up Herbalism after a week of running past ghost mushrooms in DME.  Then, after 3 days of farming DME I realized that a single Arcane crystal would have bought all the ghost mushrooms I had gathered in that time.  I dropped herbalism and leveled mining.
---
you can trade raid loot to other members for 2hours
---
I feel like, at this point, people should understand that (aside from tanks) people don't always wear the class of armor that their class is expected to wear. Thus, people should understand that if you're a druid healer rolling on cloth, you're not just being a dick.
---
For example, I've seen numerous warriors going after the mail Savage Gladiator's chest despite being able to wear plate. It's better than their plate alternatives (or so I gather).
---
You know those two dichotomies are probably formed by two very separate groups...
---
The only time I ever reserved anything was orbs in strat living bcs I just got my quel serrar and needed them for the enchant.
---
What about the hunter?
---
I do this a lot. I also multibox with the rest of them shadowmelded with stealth pets along with goblin sappers on all of them. They have their version of fun, I have mine.
---
Hmmm tell me more about how to do this my son
---
I have no problem with everyone rolling need on it. But if a BOE best in slot epic drops for me and I don't win the roll you bet your ass I'm gonna bring it up that I would use it and it's BIS and maybe offer some gold as compensation to the person who won it but I would be  upset if they wanted me to pay more than about 50% of the AH price. 
---
Also I'm a people pleaser and so if I won the archmage's robes or something I'd feel terrible not giving it to the mage unless the mage was being a prick the whole run
---
Thats... a good point. So demo only if needed. Haha, and here I've been demoing every boss... 
---
Thanks a lot, I got a firm plan then.
---
That's TSM. IIRC it can track things like crafting mats on other characters, though I haven't really used that feature.
---
If Phase 2 hits and they haven't solved this by then, I will cancel my subscription.
---
My main would 1 shot the lot of them
---
absolute shitpost
---
You sound like you just don't understand the time that goes into gathering soul shards vs clicking a button to make mage water or clicking a button to buff raid members.
---
I found that rerolling my talents at 40 helped spice things up enough
---
The Druid healing chest is nice while leveling, but easily replaced by everyone's favorite blue robe @ 60.
---
Should’ve showed his name people like this need to be blacklisted so others can avoid them in game
---
As a casual, I remember doing ZG/Aq20 much more than MC or Ony.
---
20 man dungeons were much easier to form pugs for.
---
Blizzard is such a massive, bad joke of a gaming company.
---
Those of us who knew the state of large scale PvP on retail pre-classic launch knew this would happen. The modern engine can't handle large fights. We were downvoted because 'Blizzard knows better than us."
---
Look where we are now.
---
And the best part? Blizzard is not going to spend a single dollar out of the many million Classic brings in on optimizing their clients, servers, code or hardware to fix this problem.
---
You all deserve exactly what we have now. You all fucking deserve it. Quit making excuses for Blizzard you absolute fucking morons.
---
Because this won’t apply to 95% of the people here. Post this shit in trade on the actual server.
---
2 things wrong here, first is you clearly cant grasp logic and I'm not sure why I even bother with people like you because youre so full of yourself you refuse to even listen.
---
The second part is the fact people like you, run around with this attitude that others are selfish, when if fact YOU are the most vile selfish people that play classic. You expect and demand that everyone else give up a 400g item just because it says &lt;insert class&gt; that you happen to be.
---
You are the textbook definition of entitled, and selfish.
---
That not an easy replacement haha
---
Format is screwed, just put every / in a new line.
---
It works fine for me, you need to adjust to your poison name and rank, note that if your rank is anything but V, need to use a capital "i", not an "L"
---
101
---
Cool pattern. I don't see a dreadsteed though
---
I'd be ok with a haircut/color option via barbershop. It's a small change, good money sink for people with too much, and makes people happy. Especially when they realize their hair doesn't look as good with their outfit as they'd hoped - some races only have weird colors for hair (Night Elf/Troll for example, but to an extent Undead as well) and few good styles, so you'll often have a look that's just not great with the gear you have on, or that you later realize was a bad idea.
---
If your name is any indication, I'll just freeze time and not even worry about it.
---
“Something, something, retail bad” is the point
---
I've AoE farmed on my mages for days and days of game time so far. If you have enough stamina you can do bigger pulls, pulls without iceblock, wait for them to group better, etc. Especially later on with higher level and even elite mobs when you cant just straight blizzard the whole time. Like I said, you do want to prioritize int over stam always especially if you're going oom, but stam is still a really nice thing to have.
---
I’m a she and no, I just think it’s weird that men specifically that play this game feel the need to tell everyone about their wives and kids and personal lives. I’ve literally never met a girl in WoW who starts telling everyone about her boyfriend and kids. It’s weird.
---
Oof, you hate to see it.
---
That's actually it.
---
Why not just use the character unstuck tool on [battle.net](https://battle.net) ? Teleports you right there from anywhere in the world in minutes with an 8 hour cooldown I want to say.
---
k
---
Bless your fucking soul. Thank you.
---
Most PvP related posts are alliance whining and raging about horde, leveling, ganks, server numbers. It is a contrast to this post
---
In 14 there are options to turn off both
---
Yeah they're stuff added for old tech and old internet speeds that just dampen current classic (imo at least)
---
You're already sitting right at your computer.  Take a screenshot.
---
&gt; Private servers had nowhere near the same amount of players as we here.
---
[You sure about that?](https://youtu.be/HjWhlVD-tHI?t=47)
---
Ask him for things that you need that cost around 100g and see how the treatment goes both ways. Fuck that guy.
---
Have to remember warlocks need arcane crystals for mount. Once they're finished crystals will slowly decrease in price.
---
True lol I would to, I enjoy leveling but it’s like foreplay. The good stuff imo doesn’t come until 60 ;)
---
I'm a prot paladin. Rogues and wars are all I can kill. It's the highlight if my day when one attacks me.
---
You’re either going to have to play the AH, fish, herb/mine the rest if you’re wanting to meet that goal you set.
---
I personally would just push on and get it when you get it.
---
I really don't understand the circlejerk around levelling a warrior in this patch. I'm levelling mine now and in this level bracket I was pulling 2-3 mobs every time and killing them at the same time through rend, thunder clap and super cheap copper dynamite that I crafted with what I found, while still using my green level 5 2h axe.   
---
In the end I didn't even always have to bandage, but usually yes and I was basically running through my linen bandages on cooldown. Which is the way it's supposed to be anyway, no?  
---
I mean I'm not arguing the other extreme, I'm just genuinely curious about the problems people are apparently encountering while levelling warriors.
---
They have to take time to make it, just like it takes time to kill mobs. It also costs mana, just like killing mobs does.
---
Dont bother, this dude will lie to the end of days trying to make people think his way is normal, its not and hes a fool.
---
That sounds like a lot of fun to me.
---
30? Mute has been farming it for months and never seen it drop :D
---
I don't really want to draw any attention to anyone involved in this especially since the server with my 60 is pretty small.
---
Definitely need to remove forced daily grinds.  Make gear great again by removing all RNG forging bs with it.  Don't just have templates for stats for all gear where every piece must have this much main stat and stam.  Pieces of gear should vary, like wow this piece has more stam than normal but less main stat, stuff like that.  Have deterministic targeted BiS loot to go after.  Easy to understand what is an upgrade and whats not.  I shouldnt have to pay raidbots 8 bucks every 3 months for this crap (it just auto charged and i'm only playing classic atm, feelsbad).  Of course make classes feel more complete and whole.  
---
Its been kind of nice that gold is actually important in classic.  Every dungeon run can yield up to 15g or more depending on some luck and it feels big.  Importance of professions feels good too, so bring that back.  
---
I like seeing "increases crit chance by 2%" on gear compared to "262 crit".  Bring back hit, bring back expertise, let me customize my character.  Can even have some grindy profession or quest type stuff for libram type things that give hit or expertise, so that will help prevent gear being useless without hit on it or something.
---
Also, don't timegate stuff.  Just unleash people.  If 12 people want to grind to exalted in 40 straight hours, let them.  Us normies will take the typical 3 weeks anyways lol.  Let me choose how to play the game, don't force me to adhere to your design principles.  Its a game, it should be fun.
---
Thats my ranting 2 cents.
---
It would probably be quicker to solo, since I imagine he would just stealth all the way, only killing bosses needed to open the doors.
---
Wow I've been using snippet for years
---
Nah, the whole raid should share the burden of, you know, showing up to the raid they want gear from. You act like I'm saying I refuse to summon anyone, when in fact I'm saying I refuse to summon those that only show up to raid if they get a summon.
---
Classic is toxic, or atleast the big servers are. I recently switched to Firemaw since my server is kinda dead at night (no surprise i know). From playing 1-27 i am out, i don't want anything to do with this server, when i was going for WC i kept getting messages like "ur 17"   funny.. 17 is min level, and i tanked it as lvl 16.... people only care about speed, atlased 2/5 are ninja looters so far, some dick needed on the healing staff from BFD  and he WOULD NOT EQUIP IT. We spend 2 minutes discussing that he had ninjaed it and you know what the end conclusion was? the rest of the party didn't care, they just wanted to finish the dung.   So now im back to my small server filled with people helping eachother and having a great time. The chats, the party invites, the level needed for dungs is a joke, people think it's 100% about the end game and don't enjoy the game, that's fine, i just don't want to play with people that value random fucking pixels in a game higher than their own morale. People kept saying "don't ninja, the whole server will remember you"  yea, that's true for the good servers, and they are chill af, filled with people having a great time (just like people said before it released) but firemaw for sure, i im 100% sure, all full servers are filled with people who only care about themself and speedrunning.  I saw a post some days ago about how you had to play a private server to get the real experience. That's not true, just bail these servers filled with greedy assholes
---
Have you been following the rogue discord? The energy regen on a rogue is really strong.
---
Nice logic you got there bud, enjoy the game you selfish prick.
---
I send the pet first.
---
Starting with a mark is just giving too much warning
---
Savage gladiator chain also had 17 defense until after BWL.  the itemization choices have been arbitrary as fck hence the week 1 MC full clears.
---
Kinda saw this coming.. It's honestly not an option to fall back on "newer client" or "bfa infrastructure" when the game is p2p and literally unplayable. They must atleast acknowledge this issue and come forth with some sort of explanation soon. Can't listen to another panel from the great Ion where he goes on about kazzak and other world bosses being the authentic experience without having a say on this OBVIOUS issue at the moment. It's 2019, we pay for a game and we expect to play it as intented without the game freezing every time.
---
But those weapons aren't purple. Are you telling me some measly BLUE is better than EPIXX?
---
Rag cape is worse than Baron cape for Rogues.
---
I mean sure. You'd probably also enjoy things like aimbots in shooters. When winning is all that matters and not how you won, you can enjoy things like zerg pvp.
---
I don't have a problem with full servers. I have a problem with lags during the PvP fights. I specifically choose a full server so I can have large PvP battles.
---
I'm with you and I'm not even a Warlock. Us casters gotta stick together! :)
---
Oh, yeah? Mages have to have enough food and water in their bags for everyone before the raid begin because they can’t make an unlimited amount more during the raid?
---
Hakurai is awesome. I followed his guide 10-45 on my mage
---
Lava runs would be the best option since you pass through Incendius room, but he patrols up and down so if you get to him when he's all the way up it might take a while to clear.
---
Some mages are also after warder stigliss for their shoulders, so you might look for some custom route with them.
---
Are you after the healing pants? There are much better ones in DM:W now.
---
Seriously, such a gross mentality. Hope I never get stuck in a group with that nutjob.
---
If there's a great item that drops that's an immediate upgrade for somebody in the group, give them priority on it. Be a fucking decent human being.
---
Mages complaining about making food and water reminds me of Bill Burr's joke about mothers bending at the waist to put DVDs in DVD players to entertain their children.
---
I have to be honest. I have no clue what my character looks like, I couldn't pick him out of a lineup.
---
Not sure if I read the last part correctly but here goes; when you learn a skill from a pet you learn that rank. You cannot downrank skills for other pets.

For example if you have the highest rank of claw and tame a low level pet you can’t just teach it rank 5 and the pet learn the level appropriate rank. If you know 3 and 5, your pet won’t learn 4 on its own, you would need to fine a pet in the wild with rank 4, learn that rank, then teach it to your pet.

Charge them a set amount of dkp per summon, last guild i was in we got docked dkp if we needed a summon to be on time
---
I always offered to sap in groups, I'm sub specced and opted to take Improved Sap, and consistently was told "don't worry about it". The only time I ever sap now is questing, pvping, or if I'm in a group with friends.
---
Lol. People complained that the servers would be dead with 5k people on them. The #nochanges people were the ones calling for about 3x the servers at 1/3 the pop cap.... to be more like vanilla
---
I type in tank's name if I really need to assist.
---
Thanks for the reply bro! What spec do you recommend to level in
---
I also would like the answer to this question from someone who is currently over there...is alliance wildly outnumbered? Hows the market? And most importantly, can you actually farm materials/rep anywhere?
---
This is a no changes mindset game.  This isnt the game for you.  That was clearly stated once, and now elaborated upon.  This wasn't about subs.  This is about you playing the wrong game for you.
---
Exploiting mob pathing errors should result in a ban.
---
Lol yeah, I just copied the summary from google.
---
On the alliance side, I play late but I can find groups when I need to. It just takes a little longer. The people I’ve grouped with have been awesome though, and farming is pretty easy during off hours. I guess it depends what you prioritize more.
---
Yes.
---
Im gald a few people around here can actually think, these daily threads crying about being ninjad are getting tiresome.
---
I loved dueling in front of org. Hopefully that picks back up.
---
The classic WoW community brought this upon themselves.

This is exactly the result you get when you make excuses for a company that is taking the easiest path for everything.

"Blizzard knows best." My fucking ass. The only thing Blizzard knows best is how to minimize costs and maximise profits and play you people of reddit like the damn fools and sheep you are.

Quit making excuses for a milti billion dollar company providing a worse service than unpaid volunteers in their basements, or this is exactly the product you will get.

Rational thought and logical explanation, what is the world coming to?! /s

WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT HAIRCUTS, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY DRESS UP DOLLS GO BUY A BARBIE, THEY'RE LIKE 10 BUCKS AT WAL MART. IF THEY WERE TO IMPLEMENT ANY CHANGES, INCLUDING ONE AS INSIGNIFICANT AND DUMB AS THIS, DROVES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PLAYING FOR THE "CLASSIC" EXPERIENCE WOULD BE OUTRAGED.
---
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STOP BRINGING THIS UP. IF YOU WANT HAIRCUTS GO CREATE A PRIVATE SERVER AND IMPLEMENT ALL THE CHANGES YOU'D LIKE. OR BETTER YET, GO PLAY RETAIL.
---
Hope this helps!
---
&gt; Understand this: As the tank you are the king of the group. Your word is law.
---
As a tank myself.. wtf are you talking about.. why does every tank in here have a superiority complex. We are needed because its safer.. not impossible otherwise. Literally every warrior can just go defensive stance and pull aggro from mobs and it works fine. If people don't do what i had planned out in my mind beforehand i will adjust like every other player with a brain. If they pull faster, i will tank faster, if they go slower or need mana i will go slower... Adjust, look at the current state of your party (debuffs, mana) and tank accordingly. Holy shit this sub sometimes...
---
You need the key and the farm is definitely more demanding gear-wise compared to ZF. Gonna need a lot of stamina and intellect for your health and mana pools. If you're not too geared yet stick with ZF.
---
You can sort that data by boss fight though. Only one MC boss is dominated by rogues, the rest is majority warrior topped.
---
 If you don’t put double crusader on both you’re Dal tends you are just telling the world you are broke

It's a big chunk of money, you can't just ask someone to give you gold for free, guildie or not. I mean you might to it out of kindness but that's not something that should be expected.

---
Probably different groups of people.
---
We dropped them in BRD on the 2nd trash (PUG).
---
Everyone behaved and left them to the warrior that actually needed them.
---
If one's definition of PvP is taking a full Beast Mastery spec'd pet, using Eyes of the Beast, and ganking lvl 16 to 20-somethings as they try to turn in quests and smelt Copper for 2+ hours on a Sunday night, then sure.
---
I'd just imagine that at that point, literally ANYTHING else (in-game or out) *should* be more fun.
---
I took advantage of server transfers. Still waiting for a new one. I have the same problems as OP.
---
You can make them on demand in bulk - and then you also get rid of them on demand in bulk. And the worst thing it does it use up your mana, but you can conjure your own water to deal with that.
---
A lock has to go out farming mobs for soul shards for who knows how long, has to spend tons of bag space - permanently - to hold said shards, is always expected to be in necessary places at needed times (when others can get away with being lazy), and sometimes other random non-raid spots the guild might need a summon for. Locks have to go above and beyond and you're just standing around casting which is exactly what you'd be doing anyway.
---
How about the arena spectators?
---
What are the differences between PVE and PVP gears? I've played TBC and I always liked PVP more, but I was pretty casual and didn't really understand why PVE gear doesn't really work in PVP.
---
Related to this: I passed on the Necropile Robe while I was doing Scholomance a couple of days ago and party mates were kinda surprised I didn't need it, since they considered it good for PVP. To me, the stats look kinda average (even with a full set) compared to [Robe of Everlasting Night](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18385/robe-of-everlasting-night), for example (the robe I have now).
---
As a tank: I'm pulling. I'll pull at my pace based on group mana, next pull size, next pack composition, pather locations, my cooldowns, and if someone calls my phone irl.
---
If a dps is becoming impatient tell them too bad. They don't see your cooldowns. Sometimes I'll wait for bloodrage to be ready before I pull cause I can keep aggro on 4 mobs if they are FF and I have rage ready. No rage = no chance tanking 2 mobs, much less 4.
---
Spy relies on the combat log so if you’re decently nearby it will alert the user
---
Tbh Slam fury is much harder to make work (and is probably the hardest rotation in the game as being off on your timing can completely cripple your dps)
---
They are the best PvP healers and the best single target healers. Just because they are not the absolute best class for group heals, doesn't mean they are not one of the best healers.
---
Just kill the pet. It makes a hunter lose a lot of their time.
---
If you don't have BOTH Dal'Rends you're telling the world you haven't sacrificed enough noobs to the RNG gods.

How is it absurd?

He claimed Blizzard is "taking the easiest path for everything". Developing an entire separate version of the game is extremely far from "the easiest path".
---
If Blizzard was truly this big evil money-grubbing company that just wants PROFIT PROFIT PROFIT and nothing else, "Classic" would have been BFA capped at level 60. THAT would be the "easiest path". But that's not what we got.
---
Class identity

---
One thing I love with my warrior is that I feel useless by myself compared to other classes but like a god with any healer.  I love that I am limited in what my class can do to make me want to level alts.  I also love that I am needed for what my class provides.
---
I also like how big the world feels when you can't just fly over it all the time and I really hate how every expansion makes the old expansions completely pointless.
---
I also like that I'm actually talking to people in my party now and that I have to think at least a little bit about trash pulls.
---
I'm enjoying classic for what it is, but I'm enormously dissapointed by how slap dash the whole thing is, bugs everywhere, server issues, a terrible launch driven by an unwillingness to accept how popular this was going to be that is still causing problems 2 months alter.
---
Well written and very entertaining XD sounds like a good night
---
Yea that looks like a solid build. Lasting is good for raids if you are the pally responsible for keeping up a debuff. A lot of people run 30/21 and do well for themselves. It's definatly a more pve oriented build thats designed to make no sacrifices on raid healing compared to deeper prot builds. Running imp LoH fits that pve mold better, but I like unyielding faith too. I personally prefer to run either holy shock or reckoning for pvp purposes. Something about going 30 pts deep onto a paladin tree without grabbing the last talent just feels off to me, but it's purely preference.
---
This is not just pvp. I had similar things happen but it was in a 5 man. It’s like a desync issue or something
---
I recently made the mistake of tanking a group with 2 hunters and a warlock and they all hit different targets/open with multishot. The mobs would usually just Usain Bolt spring away from me.

On strat trash the best I can do is get the 3 elites while the none elites run around like idiots.

If you have 15 to 20 mins a day tops wow is not the game for you. I'm not sure any pc game is really. Maybe try mobile games or 3ds those tend to be better for small burst gaming.

I always read it as "I'm married and still don't get laid."

Nice!  I did two crimson back in the day (one for a friend), and then a dark.  Dark took a cpl nights to do.  Never went back for the others.
---
Glad you like em. 43 isn't a bad time to switch, and 51 is a really good time so I'd say your instincts are kicking in right.
---
Being a tank gives you the privilege to pick and choose your groups
---
Vanilla - players having fun adventuring
---
Classic - players strictly min-maxing and chasing BiS lists
---
BRD groups are more often than not, not full runs.  Key runs, Coffer runs, Xboss runs, Lava Jump Emperor runs, Arena/Anger runs, Arena Farm..you get the idea. Point is you have options to reduce your time on any one run.   In your case I would just avoid full runs (which shouldn't be hard those aren't what you'll see most running).
---
Tips for BRD runs from someone who is currently running it a lot.
---
-Friend good tanks.  If you want quick runs that will help the most.
---
-If you play on a PvP server go ahead and run to BRD before you get the group.  I'm not saying don't join in route, but deaths getting in are common so minimizing the amount of commute time to get to your group can improve the group experience.  Also if you're trying to snag a DPS spot, being right outside the entrance will make you more desirable to invite in.
---
-If you are 50-54 you may have issues getting into some of the higher level runs/groups.  Spamming for a BRD Lowbie run or Shadowforge Key runs. will help you get your foot in the door and net you all the other players that are eager to get into BRD and are totally appropriate for that part of the content.
---
I buried the lede 😂
---
Depending on the kind of blowing they do, this could be good or bad.
---
Post again so I can downvote again
---
I admit that I suck at lock, mostly because I never bother to keep my buffs/stones up most of the time, but I've recently got ganked by a pair of 2 gnome rogues who thought it would be a great idea to stunlock me. As soon as it wore off I popped every single dot I had on both of them, one being feared trough a pack of mobs and the other death coiled. I still died, but it was fun seeing them try to run away while inevitably kicking the bucket at the same time. Never found them again, but I've heard from a guildie that he's seen them in Arathi Highlands, all the way up from STV.
---
Nah i left one of those because que times were garbage. I'm on Heartseeker , its relatively small but its like 80% ally and tons of raiding guilds switched to it
---
If your fishing is too low for a certain area the 'fish will get away'.
---
Multiple people have said that it won't generate threat if I'm out of combat. Threat doesn't pick up until i enter combat. This has been my experience with multiple tanks.
---
So I can renew you and stay far back and out of combat and drink to give you plenty of time to build threat :)
---
The difference between you, and other rogues is, you aren't opening with dps you still have a good 1.5 seconds of non sin striking after your CS. Normally that's fine if you start pacing  your energy use. But if you CS into adrenaline rush, into 8 sin strikes, any hits you take are on you.
---
The tagged mobs that aren't tagged gets annoying.
---
It's the truth, not 'bullshit'.
---
And I will add you to fuck you up in a bit.
---
TBC arenas with all the best bro’s from high school days.
---
I totally agree. I'm getting burned out quickly because everything is farmed.  Blizzard should have done a wow reboot with QoL changes, fixes to issues and quests, etc. Instead, they released the same game with the same problems all over again.
---
If it shows up in the combat log, Spy will report it.
---
A) Inv a guildy/friend, give him lead, log out, let him reset the Instance, log back in
---
B) inv a guildy, make a raid, log on an alt, guildy can leave, reset instance, log back on

Judging by your muscle mass you got the TRT levels of an 18-year-old boy
---
ZF is a great spot, but to pull all three packs using the reset you will need epic mount to round them up. Don't even bother trying that method without it. Just do the packs one at a time. After doing it for a long while, I personally began to hate the ZF farm. Nova resists can get you killed, taking one step too close with server lag can get you killed, and the run back is just brutal. Lashers are the way of the future. It's so braindead you just turn on some good music and one shot all of them. I dropped a profession just to get herbalism for lasher farming. Honestly the biggest plus as that you can easily farm lashers in the raiding arcane power spec so I'm saving a bunch of gold not having to respec every week. Its also slightly better gp/hr compared to ZF.
---
It is far too late!
---
Why do people write books?
---
It's so roundabout I can't even be mad.
---
Reeee!
---
We're people dying because you couldn't heal well enough with that spec and gear? If the group wiped 4 times because you don't have healing gear or went oom to fast then yeah I think it's justified. If no one died then he's just a whiny bitch. As long as you can do the job you can spec however you want.
---
Eskhanders has higher dps, faster speed for more frequent heroic strikes, chance on hit attack speed increase, and it's a fist weapon which I *believe* means you cannot be disarmed (please correct me if I'm wrong). +9str/agi is tiny compared to that.
---
Not everyone has played for the last 15 years, and the math isn't always painfully obvious either. But thank you for your wise words.
---
Enchanting is so expensive. I went tailor/enchant and I'm just getting near the top. A lesser nether essence on my server is 1g59s where a greater nether essence is almost 4g per one!

Ah, on Blanchy we're like 52/48 we have some multi run guild's with 3 raid groups but less PuG runs because the guild's will take pretty much anyone that wants to join.
---
I'm not whining, I'm pointing out the flaw in your comparison
---
Bastards will be bastards. Put him on your VanasKoS hatelist as a ninja and move on.
---
Maybe report him to his guild.
---
&gt;Is it wrong to leave a group as a tank when the FPS start pulling multiple groups without saying anything?
---
That is the best thing for everyone. When I do it, I say I have other things to attend to. That other thing is "not dying", but I leave that unsaid.
---
DM east lasher+satyr+herb has more potential i think. Needs better gear and skill I think
---
Where did you download your version? Mine only asks me to select an import folder.
---
Yeah, I had been planning on 51. Hopefully I won't regret switching earlier! I may wait until 44 just so I have a good range pull. I should probably switch to engineering, too ...
---
When my husband dinged lvl 40, the two of us managed to have enough gold during leveling for one person to get the mount. I gave all my gold to my husband for him to get the mount.
---
My husband then farmed stockades at lvl 40 as an aoe mage, while I continued leveling. With the drops and occasional blue boes, I think he was able to get 5-10g per run. He didn't let me help because of the lockout timer. Having the two of us will not make the gold farming faster.
---
Killing tons of mobs for quest join group as I kill a mob gutripper drops.... I lose the roll
---
Unless you’ve only gone against shit rogues out in flat terrain.  If a halfway decent rogue opens on you in an area not perfect for kiting your gonna have a bad day.
---
There's a really good hybrid fury build, that is probably 85% as good as a pure spec in both Fury **and** Protection.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/03-05050115025010051-532001105
---
You'll want different gear sets ideally, but basically, just need to swap between dual wielding and a shield. Rage generation is excellent as well as damage mitigation. 
---
Fury in a raid when DPS is needed or swap to a shield if an offtank is needed. Very useful in raids.
---
I've seen a lot of people complain about PvE servers because there's not a lot to do when you've gotten your BiS.
---
But in a few months(?) we'll have world bosses, battlegrounds and a lot more content so I imagine it will improve.
---
please point out the pathing error?
---
I usually give it 2 or 3 wipes before I bail on a group.
---
Mistakes happen.  Or people are there for the first time and lack knowledge.  So, I usually talk to the group, find out if it was a mistake or lack of knowledge.  Try to steer them in the right direction...
---
But, for some reason, some players seem to be unable to use chat or communicate.  They charge in and make the same mistake over and over and don't communicate in any way.  Yeah, I drop those groups quicker than shit and don't feel bad about it at all.
---
&gt; No... most of us I woul wager quit wow in BC, Wrath and maybe Cata. Possibly jumping in for a little to sus out the new expacs only to not feel the new paradigm WoWs in
---
I mean... Vanilla, BC, Wrath, Cata, etc. were all "retail" at their respective times, so "go back" would mean "play the 'current' version of the game"
---
I did exactly that. Stopped playing seriously at the end of Wrath, then just checked out each expansion for a few weeks just to get the feel but inevitably would get bored and quit again.
---
they did not. 
---
At some periods some servers did have this due to some mistake in an update, but when there wasn't servercore issues like this, they ran incredibly smoothly even for big mass pvp.
---
You can just make a weakaura that triggers when a player aura is missing and name the player aura for whatever poison you're trying to track.
---
I did this for battle shout in combat so I can rebuff myself when it falls.
---
Perhaps we are talking about different things then. The drain life talents are only the 2nd tier in affliction.
---
I wholeheartedly agree about your thoughts on pvp. I did the rank 14 grind and will never do it again. My story was a sad one, as the amount of time and devotion to play each day for 10-14 hours was one of the worst mistakes I’ve ever made in my life. My hope is they look at the system and change it to better suit the player base,. To not require the horrible time commitment, but rather a system to reward solid play and one that a player could get over a longer period of time. I will do BGs for fun, not as a full time job.
---
Too bad Fear can be spammed and Death Coil ignores it.
---
Please don't get me wrong. I'm not saying it's stupid or anything. I just don't understand how you can enjoy the game this way. I just don't get it.
---
Blizzard isn't willing to invest any money into Classic, not more than what is absolutely necessary. The client that was chosen to be used for Classic WoW (retail) cannot deal with the load of many players in the same spot at the same time. This was a known issue, but for the above reason Blizzard went ahead and did it anyway.
---
Here is an example of us knowing well in advance:
---
https://youtu.be/iz1_DLm3mCk?t=97
---
Blizzard can't even support its own 40v40 game mode in retail.
---
We knew this would happen, but "Blizzard knows best."
---
You reap what you sow. This product is the result of the Classic WoW community making blind exxcuses for Blizzard. I hate to say I told you so, because I'm playing the game too.
---
I just hope people wake up and understand they are being played hard. Blizzard needs to put at least some of money they are raking in toward a better framework that can support WoW without the phasing system retail WoW relies on.
---
Every one has atleast 1% chance to resist your attacks. Not only boss mobs but even a critter will resist or dodge you sometimes
---
No you weren't. Although I would have put it to a group vote. Either me or the dps. Regardless, you have the power as a tank and if people want to test that, fine. Finding a new group, like you said, isnt an issue.
---
Thunderfurry! It was 55/45 horde favour then just before census was cut I ran a census all weekend and found about 15.5k alliance and 14.9k horde. Dam near 50/50.
---
My favorite WoW memory has definitely been all of the friends I’ve made.  Whether it’s been the hilarious blunders we’ve made along the way or running the newest content together, it’s always been the most memorable being able log on and have friends to play with.

Out of curiosity why are deciding to leave Arcanite Reaper?
---
-BiS dagger + off-hand = 15 str + 16 agility
---
-BiS 2h = 29 str
---
Its pretty close dps-wise.
---
I mean, it's pretty obvious the Mage is a dumbass, idk why you need to come to reddit to validate yourself.
---
I don't think so, 1-40 is just designed better, it has all the good milestones. 
---
After 40 you don't
---
- Get any meaningful abilities outside of your core
---
- Get any talents that are particularly interesting
---
- Get any class quests (in Phase 1)
---
Those level 50 class quests really bridged the gap for me.
---
Hey man, where's the Alliance version?!
---
I'm anxious!
---
So I guess everyone should just need roll on everything. Because hey, I can't wear plate but it vendors for gold and gold can buy me a Krol Blade. So me not rolling on this is unfair to me right? I joined the group to benefit myself, not others /s.
---
LoL on warrior lvl 37 u get ravager and u use it till 49
---
Leave yours up and find out :)
---
what did you grind 30-32?
---
I’ve done this because a hunter was being a moron, pissed off people that I would have liked to play with again. Later I asked to join one of there groups and they refused. Doesn’t phase me, I know it’s never worth it to stay in groups that struggle with simple things from the start.
---
I think having resources (including spawns) be relatively scarce compared to the population is good for the game. It keeps people out there in the world farming mats, it keeps goods and gold moving on the AH, and when items are valuable it makes the decision to consume them a choice a with consequences.
---
Also, when an activity such as farming furbolgs is at capacity it means that some players who would have been farming them are forced to engage in slightly less preferable activities, which might mean you see players in zones where they wouldn't otherwise be, which keeps the whole server feeling alive.
---
uggg. Pug tanking has been okay up until ZF. The amount of people wanting to do zombie runs and afk dps warriors has ruined ZF for me.
---
Nost did some awesome stuff with packet prioritization in the core to make all that possible. I guess Blizzard's doesn't do anything like this since they've not really had to design theirs around heavy player load in a single zone like this in... a long long time.
---
Fully aware, I read his post.  My advice still applies.  Rolling on both healing and shadow gear is not fair to the party, particularly for locks if you are joining as a healer for a group and just start rolling OS on +shadow gear without telling anyone at the start of a run.
---
To me it seems like tier gear should be a different category entirely then t2/high prio items since almost all of them are side grades at best. But each guild does things differently. I think it would make more sense for you to have 1 roll and 1 LC item chance per raid. 
---
To be honest my favorite way for tier geae is just to have a class list.  At the start of the first raid have everyone from each class roll and make a list, top roll at the top, bottom roll at the bottom, top guy gets first pick when tier 1 gear drops if he takes it he goes to the bottom if he passes the 2nd guy gets his choice take it and go to bottom or pass and so on. Makes loot fast easy and even if your on the bottom you may get bracers or belt because other people wanna pass for better tier or more needed tier pieces and noone gets punished for taking tier gear.
---
Do alot of people drink when they play wow? I know a few people that drink too much and they definitely use wow as an excuse to drink. Because it's a social activity, they dont view it as "at home alone drinking by myself". 
---
I'm not saying you have a problem, so please dont take it that way - nothing wrong with some rum and coke to unwind at night. But, I've been noticing more and more that people drink and play wow. 
---
I'm not a big drinker so honestly, the combo has never occurred to me. Is this commonplace for alot of wow players?
---
Kick dps, there are plenty of them.  Not enough tanks.
---
Imagine being so dumb that you didn't at least post on a bank alt....
---
Yeah exactly, there is more time to raid if the first pull happens when the raid is supposed to start.
---
I am fully ret with 8 points prot for better hit And I tank ALL dungeons and even sometimes mc trash.
---
You don't need to go full prot.
---
Just take a shield. Start slow. Watch your mana and learn.
---
Consecration is most important
---
Wasn’t there a fun bug back in the days where hunters got the curse on their pets, dismissing and then calling it out again in any major city causing havoc?
---
It's the equivalent of pointing a finger gun at you
---
STV gear is a good shout cuz I skipped it on warr, would have probably forgotten about it
---
You should pick something and focus on it, I don't think hybrid holy/shadow is much good tbh.   Shadow priests put out great dps, but I imagine trying to split talents has a bit negative impact.  Holy focus can get power infusion which makes you super valuable in raid, etc.

Thanks for the feedback. Holy shock might be a better move though for the range. Since I don't have engineering and not sure if I'm willing to sacrifice my expensive enchanting progress. Maybe if I hit a lot of gold or get a mining alt. How important/crucial is it for being a reliable tank without going deep prot?
---
In the last 3~ MC runs our hunters have had pets out specifically to test it, not once has the pet been made the bomb.
---
Could just be bad RNG since I haven't been the bomb once either, but right now it may nto be possible.
---
After outleveling content, the only real issue for a melee becomes hp bar - if you can get more hp than the damage a given encounter does before it dies then you can solo it.
---
For ranged classes it's more of a question of kiting.
---
Should have kicked the mage.
---
I and a lot of others go to the persons guild when people ninja as the game is largely self moderated. A Karen would be contacting someone's guild for stealing a tag or taking someones leather.
---
I'm at lvl 36 with like 8 days played lol
---
It gives you experience which is converted to that much gold if you're already 60
---
Altoholic taken to the max.
---
No.
---
I fish every useful pool I come across. Have some good pole attachments with you.
---
The skill will just raise with time.
---
Favorite WoW memory for me was finishing up Battlemaster in AB with 9 of my favorite Dwarves.  Love you BBV, thanks for the good times.
---
You have main hand off hand in the first picture. Then a staff in the second. Guessing the offhand is the DM one with +37 to healing. So that means the above setup up has more spell power by +2 for heals. 
---
I don't know the name off the add on off the top of my head, but there is one that gives more stat drop down menus for spell casters. Hard to compare when we are looking at a screen cap of two different gear sets.
---
More likely zoomers tbh
---
yea but its BiS for fury warriors until phase 5 ;)
---
Ah yes massive world pvp battles mostly enjoyed by mages and warlocks while every other class pretty much gets destroyed instantly :) yeah super fun haha
---
Can this not be purged like in retail?
---
This is exactly it. It took me a while of wondering why I was getting totally fucked in ZF still after farming all of my pre bis. None of the guides mention how important it is. You actually need a whole different set of gear. The two rings from the strat quests, rod of the ogre magi, and the necropile set are great places to start. This is why I've been recommending lashers cause there's alot less number crunching, its much less dangerous, less gear dependent, and its just way more chill to do for hours on end.
---
J O A F F
---
I think Onyxia is not on a weekly lockout and is instead on a 3 day lockout. This may also apply to ZG? It's been a while.
---
I think the idea for pvp gear is to stack stamina, above everything else. Streamers and videos should be a good place to start because the gear can vary. Use of trinkets will also vary depending on the encounter. 
---
I'm a holy/disc priest. For pvp gear, I'm gathering stam and resistance gear. Then Int is more important than spirit and mp5.
---
Fair, never though about getting something like a Tome of Knowledge with a dagger
---
All I can say screw luck, once it MUST drop!
---
Notice how the mage decides to stop running as soon as the lock comes in to fight... dunno how it is on other servers but kirtonos has some cowardly horde. Just yesterday, I was holding my own 1v2, trying to claim the essence of water spot. I kept farming this priest and mage until they got away from me, regrouped and finally took me down. Then a random priest shows up and I ask him if he wants to clear them out. He accepts, I sheep the mage, priest tries to run, we kill him and we go back to the mage but he's long gone.
---
The second it's a fair fight, they flee lmao. It's kinda sad, they didn't even attempt to fight for the spot after the priest showed up...
---
Horde side here-- pug raids are very much a thing, Ony and MC.
---
If the person that wins wants to give the item to whoever needs it, more power to them. Trading still exists.
---
My server currently has tons of Living Essence on the AH for 70s to 1g30s. A week ago they were 6-8g per. Would anything cause this drop or did someone just undercut way low then crash it for time being? I imagine they should be a little more expensive especially since DM was released.
---
Retail wow has been watered down for kids to play without any effort.
---
To this effect everything has been removed that is worth it.
---
There is no going back , ever
---
I’m on Old Blanchy and I find it very enjoyable and have a pretty active guild. We raid and always have a group for UBRS, Scholo and Strat going
---
The other post I saw talking about this last night said he had. Maybe my information is bad
---
Not really terrible advice.  OP mentions they are 58 and frequently run dungeons.  Why even bother with the AH w/ anything they can't use equipment wise?
---
Edit:  and I vehemently disagree with the notion that "censoring everything is how ppl are broke all the time".  Im sitting pretty at 300g and literally have nothing else to blow money on other than consumables or a Krol Blade.  Just saving for epic mount (or not... Don't really care about the epic mount right now tbh)
---
Now if OP said they were lvl 28, 38, etc instead of 58 I would agree with you.  The majority of 55+ players are not looking for miniscule green gear upgrades if they are doing higher end dungeons.
---
Man I wish I could do that but as a druid I don't have a regular rez so they have to run back and it slows the entire group down waiting for the sake of teaching a lesson that honestly they probably wont learn.
---
Would have been better to discuss it with the group, by doing this you waste the time of the other 3 people as well. If the mage is acting like a jerk, he's the one who should either leave or calm down.
---
This is brissie hey? My house looked like that a couple hours ago as well
---
and each realm 15 years ago hosts less than current medium and most likely low pop realms.
---
the speculation is whatever but when private servers can get it right they can too, but they just choose not to
---
Your right about speed, but hes right that brut blade isnt a great choice for a tank. Its just barely better than quel serrar , which isnt hotly cobtested by dps.
---
Kill it, kill it with daggers
---
Arcanite Reaper is a fantastic server. Lots of cool people, a small tight-knit community. Quiet when you want it to be, but still plenty of groups and things happening during "on" hours. I'm on Horde side, Pug raids are happening often and more people seem to be in the world every day.
---
This comes up all the time and there is the answer.
---
If you are swords, go double crusader.
---
If you are daggers put Crusader and your OH and your MH depends.  If you want consistency, go +5 dmg.  If you want an extremely minor paper dps increase, go crusader.  Everything I am about to say comes with the caveat that I am a dagger rogue who uses +5 dmg.
---
Crusader MH on a dagger is "better".  We are talking 100ish dmg per minute better, but theoretically better.  If you want to debate cost vs benefit, or variance in performance, then that is another argument.  I use +5 dmg, but by a pure mathematical standpoint, crusader is better.
---
The main reason people discount crusader MH is they don't understand how PPM work.  PPM sets a proc rate based on the weapons speed.  Crusader is 1 PPM.  With a 1.8 speed dagger you would get 33 attack per minute (60/1.8).  One of those attacks procs crusader giving you a 3% chance to proc crusader (1/33).  The issue is you do more than 33 attacks per minute when you take into account things like SND/AR/BF.  Ignoring BF/AR for the time being SnD will increase your attacks per minute to 43 instead of 33, while use of energy will increase that further to 53.  So instead of 33/33 attacks pe minute, you have 53/33 attacks per minute, which gives an average of 1.6 procs per minute.  Crusader last 15 seconds so 15x1.6 = 24 seconds of average crusader uptime per minute, of 40%.  
---
If you want to try to make it a pure AP comparison, 40% uptime of 100 AP would be about....40AP.  5 weapon dmg on a 1.8 speed dagger would be 5/1.8=2.8DPS increase *14 (Amount of AP for 1DPS)= 39 AP.  In this comparison Crusader is an average of 40 AP while +5dmg is 39.  
---
Crusader does have other aspects which give it a slight edge, like use with AR/BF and the fact it affects your OH.  In total, crusader MH as a dagger rogue is "better", but it is isn't really.  This would be maybe 1-1.5 dps better with AR being used and less than that in general.  People like to promote +5 weapon dmg is better hands down, but it isn't.  They are very nearly the same.  +5 dmg is much less costly and less prone to variance, so it makes sense to recommend it to people, but for people to say +5 dmg is better is silly when many of those same people suggest buying a Krol Blade or Alcor's Sunrazor because it has a minor DPS increase.
---
100 times this.
---
Use an assit macro with your guilds maintank. Its useful for long bossfights.
---
I mean, at least it's an explanation.
---
Understandable, I had my fair share of world PVP and I really enjoy the PVE content and would rather, with my limited schedule, just relax and have fun without BRM camping.
---
Fucking exactly this.
---
There is NO REASON TO GREED BOES. Even IF you decide to deny the very real concept of opportunity cost on all BOEs (which is to say, equipping any BOE is equivalent to paying for it because you lose the money you could have sold it for, thus BOEs have equal value to all), there's STILL no reason not to roll need because you can just TRADE IT to the person you think "should" get it.
---
Yeah That was hakkar
---
You just admitted the fault in this line of thinking though, if you were a "good person" in the first place you should just greed because you aren't going to sell it for gold anyway. It shouldn't be up to you to decide who needs gear and who doesn't unless you're the actual loot master.
---
No need for Rez sickness. Just go down to Booty Bay, take the boat to The Barrens, and hoof it to your body /s.
---
Opposite situation for me. To me everything on the alliance side feels "cold" whereas horde feels "warm"
---
Thats the best way I can put it
---
With that logic, WotF is total garbage and no one should even bother playing undead since mortal coil can't be broken by it and fears can be recast. 
---
How you ever engaged in competitive PvP?
---
You assumed wrong. The issue was already figured out. There is a bug with the Spiritual Guidance talent that makes every since tier of it stack with one another when you respec until you log out.   
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ddyo14/major\_bug\_with\_priest\_healing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ddyo14/major_bug_with_priest_healing/)   
---
This guy showcased it here. Look at his combat log.
---
i never played retail and classic is better
---
Yeah but mind flay is like 3% per cast lol. Sure, wanding to make use of the haven’t casted in 5 sec rule to allow for mana regen in combat so you don’t need to drink for the next pull is fine... but mindflay is so cheap as is, and actually does about 400 damage at the higher ranks (rank 4 for 2.87% mana). You’re gonna have to drink as a priest regardless, unless the only thing you’re doing is SW;P and mindblasting once or twice and then only wanding.
---
My favorite memories are of Pre-BC, doing my first Wailing Caverns run with some RL friends. Best dungeon in the game, you're all baby versions of your classes, don't need to spec or have fancy addons. It's simple enough to teach new players, and long enough to get lost in.
---
&gt; For some reason, so many people think they need to do every dungeon as a super AOE run 
---
They're looking at the damage meter and they're being beat by the melee dps. They know they'll top it if only they can AOE 10 mobs at once. So then (in their mind) it's the tank's fault they're so low on the damage meter.
---
Hunter's Mark has a range of "draw distance"
---
What leveling guide did you use if any?
---
My fishing is 422 when fully buffed but I still occasionally (like 1 out of 20 times) get fish get away when I fish in Bay of storms. I know you need 330 skill minimum to fish in Bay of storms, do I need 430 fishing there to not miss or am I just bad?
---
Me and a group of friends from middle school decided to form a 10man guild in Cataclysm. We cleared everything fairly easy, but we were stuck on Spine of Deathwing heroic for an entire month. Finally, the summer vacation arrived and we decided to throw a LAN party 8/10 of the guild. The final day, we progress on Spine for 8 hours, and finally down it! The nerdgasm was real, all with good friends! Damn I miss being young
---
I play on incendius and this is not a problem for many of the things you mentioned.
---
I’ll still play on arcanite reaper, but I’ve grown bored of my main and want an alt, and I’ve decided to put my alt on another realm. The queue times are what made me transfer off of whitemane, but I’ve heard queue times aren’t near as bad as they used to be.
---
My range is 22.
---
I'm loving my warrior too but just because I finally figured out how to tank.
---
But yah male them all! And use that rest xp
---
Ah, so you come from a garbage farm of just toxic cancer players who never grew up from vanilla. Enjoy being bottom of the barrel I s'pose.
---
This was within 2 minutes of entering BRD, before the first pull.
---
Appreciate the insight! These two (well Gatorbite) actually replaced my WW axe, so I hope that wasn't a downgrade lol.  
---
If I see a good deal on Executioner's I might explore that, but as a few others informed me I might be close enough to an upgrade already.  
---
Or I'll just go totally off the board and find that dildo that another suggested!
---
I got mine on my first kill. I honestly forgot it even dropped from him and was just in there for quests.
---
Honestly I'd take that 1.2k offer. It's only bis for mages until BWL comes out.
---
I respect you. Back in Vanilla, when I had RL obligations (like getting home from work to get in the raid that starts at 6:00pm, I would park my character just inside the room by the portal to MC the night before and log off. I'd get home log on, get the invite and run straight in. (was healer, raids always needed the extra healer).
---
Right, ally priests. Any priest intending to play PvP (at least competitively) rolls dwarf.
---
I have literally never heard anyone do what you're describing in the last 15 years of playing WoW. Nothing more than "wife/kid aggro brb"
---
free often just to spite people who were charging 100g+
---
There are creative solutions that are also easy to implement, if the Classic devs are willing.  We'll see what they decide to do.  Hopefully they'll engage with the player base.
---
Unless you are overhealing with your max rank heal, there is no reason to downrank until you have quite a bit of healing power. At 0 +healing max rank Healing Touch always has the best hp/mana ratio.
---
I only use lower-ranked heals on low-hp DPS classes, on the tank I just wait until their health is low and heal it all in one go.
---
Best professions for a NE Rogue? Engi/Mining Herb/Alche or Skinning/LW?
---
Feeling super powerful with the gear I got from pre tbc patch and then going into hellfire peninsula and getting stomped on by a fel reaver
---
Mana shield...stone or evocate if you're oom.
---
Runs fine on a microsoft surface pro
---
Always roll need on things worth more than 30g.
---
I forgot to add that in there. That I think there is a break point between impale vs cruelty that involves a lot of math.  I'm not 100% sure.  5/5 Cruelty might actually be better.
---
Or you complain about ninjas and don't become one yourself.
---
All of the plant mobs in DM East drop them, so they're pretty common now. Between the people farming DM East and the people doing normal runs, there are a lot on the market now.
---
I'm excited to do the questlines I missed on my main first time around. Stuff like darrowshire and fallen hero of the horde dont make sense to do now that I dont get xp and am trying to get bis.
---
You can report him for violating loot rules. The item will be removed from his inventory.
---
Doesn't even need to be the largest pvp server. Just a guild vs guild fight is enough to freeze the game. Can't call it MMORPG.
---
Bro! Eyes on the monitor and u can see real darnassus no point fakeing it to yourself thrue window
---
Like Rrrrrabbit said, you don't need to be prot specced to tank dungeons. Consecrate and plate gear is enough. Some madmen don't even use consecrate, but that's usually part of a raid tanking single target build.As far as the deep prot tree goes, Blessing of Sanct is more for solo aoe farming, and pulling lots of low level mobs, but even then you can get by without it. Reckoning is more for pvp. Holy Shield is nice for mitigation super early on, but mainly just becomes useful for aoe farming with force reactive disk later on.
---
I dont want to see any complaints from Warlocks, especially with the 20 sec Fear that almost never breaks from DoT damage.
---
Watch out. Lasitor’s always pay their debts.
---
I feel like not enough people are noticing single bullet in the wedding gift.  That's subtle.
---
First time seeing a devilsaur in Un'goro
---
I just started an alt using Nightfall's guide (horde). Smooth sailing so far. The website freezes in chrome, though, and lags a bit in firefox - I'm guessing it's because of the ads, of which there are many.
---
Well, I think that's an issue for your raid leader.
---
For the horde
---
Yeah.  They added things like this and then it became the game that is now retail.
---
Aimed shot. That hits, auto multi hits, your pretty much fucked
---
Looks like Heavy Silk Bandages, Elixir of Greater Defense, Happy Fun Rock, a cat, Red Fireworks, and some Volatile Rum.
---
Herb/alchemy is always useful.  You can actually level it as you level without  going out of your way to gather. It's very cheap to do, and doesn't use a ton of inventory space.  Plus you can always make useful stuff. At max level you can make 5-10g every two days selling Arcanite transmutes.
---
More tpb x wow crossovers plz
---
Fuckin way she goes, ragnaros
---
Did the same, but I found a good guild and kept one with me
---
its literally the other way around. Hunters tool kit means fuck all when a rouge kills in 3 seconds
---
mana shield and evocate vs lock LUL
---
How'd you go from Ruttheran to Ratchet? Anyway loved the idea for this post.
---
I lost interest at 60. Does that count?
---
Warlocks can make Bank from summons
---
Yeaaaa, usually we get something like this during twilight, but only on rare mornings does it get so pink/purple
---
right on, thx!
---
Totally into that as long as you make it clear up front that that's what the group's doing.  That way I can choose to either be a part of that group or not.
---
can you list me the bugs?
---
what are the addons hes using?
---
right on, thank you
---
Bay of Storms is quite a high level place, I'm not sure on the exact fishing range but I do know that you still get quite a few failures at EPL at 350+ so I imagine Azshara is quite tough too. 
---
Since this happens very rarely, it means that you are close to the fishing level never to let one get away.
---
You're allowed to be wrong.
---
Fair.  Thought the "humor" flair was enough.
---
Lol nah, I grew up to realize that being an abrasive asshole all the time makes you look like a complete tool to everyone else. Have fun with your "thick skin" edge lord.
---
UwU
---
LOL you stupid :D as ghost you can just walk across the great sea xD /s
---
blast his name and realm please thanks
---
Nah, don’t make it “him or me” just say, I’m going to find a more chill group, you should find a new tank. And then leave. And watch the others whisper you to join up when you post in lfg. If you say it’s him or you then his friends will feel too guilty to pick you over him and it makes you look childish.
---
The str doesn't add to ranged atp. It's still very good for them. But as a melee class, seeing someone who can't even use all the stats take it hurts a bit.
---
I think all bars except the default action bar is bound.
---
If you go into your bind settings you'll see binds for Action bar 2, Action bar 3, etc 
---
Bind those and the binding will show on the action bar.
---
Sorry sir, it most certainly does.
---
Same.  Played Horde through vanilla, tbc, and wrath.  Decided to roll Alliance for Classic.  I feel like a traitor.
---
Black Lotus is already at some ridiculous price on Skeram, I think it was 50g+ last time I checked. Probably going to increase as more people hit 60.
---
In Vanilla it was regularly 10-20g.
---
sounds like every druid we bring into MC
---
Yep, it's part of the class. And as he stated "he need those shards for his rotation."
---
Read what he said...he dies AFTER the lock is dead, derp.
---
Just started playing wow classic and can’t believe I’ve been missing out for all this time!
---
All of them upset me
---
Congrats!!
---
*me crying cuz i dont have the money and time to play classic even though i was hyping and waiting since nostalrius shutdown*
---
Really good information. Thanks!
---
"please pass lead?". Right click, remove from party. /P anyone else wanna pull the mobs?
---
Fastest way to level up is to simply stay in a place and fish till you reach the point you have to go to a trainer. So just attach a bobber/lure so you don't miss fish and stick to it.
---
It is a good set after AQ as well, just not for someone who has been raiding since the beginning. It will still be useful for people who don't raid and for alts.
---
Leveling for the first time and getting 1g and bags gifted.
---
They're self proclaimed "child free", mad that parents post pictures of their children on facebook, and not looking for relationships. I think they're just jealous other people can get it
---
Sounds like whining imo.
---
It's still there in retail, not moved by an inch
---
Unfortunately Mana Shield only absorbs physical damage, not spell damage. You can try to immediately start eating as soon as you leave combat, but if you get to that point and survive the dots, the Warlock either made some huge mistakes or is significantly worse geared or leveled.
---
I know this is an old post, but would you still recommend elv/tuk ui to go with the other add-ons you mentioned? Also do you have any screenshots of everything together? I'm considering that UI and wanna see how auras and stuff look :)
---
After playing WoW from beta and dabbling in raiding, I finally was able to raid full time in WotLK. Downing the Lich King for the first time with my guild was truly an epic conclusion to that stage of playing the game.
---
Really good info! Way more in depth than expected.. Thanks
---
What in the living christ is hit cap for dual-wielders with 305 weapon skill? I've spent hours reading about it and it seems that all +hit beyond 8% is wasted because the dual wielding penalty dictates that I can't go below 19% miss rate for white damage. Is that accurate?
---
Right now I have +7% hit from gear and +5% from talents. Should I take 4 points out of precision and spend them someplace else? Is the extra +4% hit doing anything at all?
---
Nobody is going to give a flying fuck about some guy who rolled need on a bow blue that everyone should have rolled need on to begin with. If they had, this thread wouldn't even exist.
---
testing some things with filters. interesting things can really be done. i wish i could abuse the depth of field one w/o having my UI go blurry
---
It's still less damage. Three piece Arcanist (helm, wrist and boots) gives you 61 SP, 1.95% crit and 1% hit. The same pieces of frozen wrath give 91 SP. That's slightly more, at least given the damage done right now. It's probably still worthwhile to take the three piece because you gain all the other supporting stats and the damage loss is quite minor.
---
rogues shit on druids if played correclty bro. Sprint and vanish break root and they got 2 of those (and gl trying to stun through evasion)
---
When someone says they have to go to their job is that also flex on you?
---
Stone form -&gt; vanish
---
Death is coming for you
---
It was the aoe-fest in wrath that started it and it seems to get worse every expansion. That is so trivial in retail that dps can just go ham and the tank will never lose threat. I think between that and many forgetting that not everyone has been playing on private servers for the last 10 years or, God forbid, might be playing a new role.
---
The best twink axe in the game
---
Can you provide a link to a sim?
---
Thank you!
---
As a healer I thank you for your service.
---
Engineering is very valuable for PVP and for AOE PVE Damage. Leatherworking as far as I know is 100% useless as there are no Bind on Pickup items for Leatherworking a Best in Slot item (unlike Priests and Mages with Tailoring). Alchemy is always useful, as are any of the gathering options. Mining would help level Engineering, so that's my vote.
---
Thanks alot!
---
&gt; we could all roll greed. 
---
Why is that a positive? If everyone rolls need, there's no more complaining about ninja looting because everyone has an equal chance, every time.
---
Oh that’s interesting. I never really looked into where the free transfers go.
---
Lol derp. I meant ice barrier.
---
The problem with ZG pug is how long it takes. I would much rather clear it at super speed with 10-15 core raiders and some alts.
---
Well you infiltrate the Burning Blade cult, kill what you believe to be Zalazane, and stop a coordinated attack on senjin, razorhill, and Orgrimmar by the centaur.
---
At least that’s what I remember from the Durotar quests I did last night on my shaman
---
I was around in vanilla. There's a lot of things to be nostalgic for in vanilla. Technical failures of a past age of gaming do not number among them.
---
There’s that thin skin coming to say hello! Hey fragile kid
---
Am married, can confirm this is how wives work.  If I ordered a cheeseburger for her, she’d probably ignore it all night.
---
4.00 attack speed! Holy fuck
---
It’s why your are brought to the raid. If you couldn’t summon id replace you with a mage or warrior who could actually top charts.
---
Honestly would make a great little comic. A warlock holding up a shard with a name on it, summoning a voidwalker and realizing they wanted a succubus instead so casually dismissing them.
---
Sorry to hear that
---
Alliance tried this yesterday on Bigglesworth.  They got rekt before they even got inside the first doorway (they went in through the front instead of the side).
---
Spent the next 30 mins corpse camping the stragglers as they tried to run away.
---
It was glorious!!
---
I vote no plaguelands. Run Scholo and Strat until you're revered before you start plaguelands.
---
I think some of the learning and mechanics are most thorough on warriors.  On pvp execution though I think rogue has a pretty high skill ceiling.  I play a rogue and am getting better and better, and I can tell the class can be pushed pretty far even when against 2 or 3 people but you have to make split second decisions quickly, while trying to time your energy ticks, watching for any dots on you, etc. and being unpredictable.  The fact that you lose combo points for even switching targets creates a super pain in the ass decision process at all times whether or not it’s better to keep on your target, blow some points now, or switch.  When I get better gear I think it will be simpler.
---
Honestly if the combo points system was different I think rogues would be a lot easier.
---
You can put the retail one in the classic addons folder and it works fine
---
Yea but he was talking about pre raid. You need 6% or 9% tho
---
Bagbro which I think came with Bagnon. Shows all gold/stuff on my account.
---
Randomise then never think about how my character looks again....
---
Lol wtf he has OEB. 
---
and brain hacker being fast doesnt make it good for fury, it makes it trash. You want a slow weap for windfury. Seems like you dont have a clue, stop giving others advice.
---
Your too slow.
---
Delayed my mount for a couple days and gave her gold, just to make sure we did it at the same time
---
Don't like being out of mana? With rogue you will always be out of energy, lol
---
I haven't experienced any of this on the PvE server I play. Though really, I do my outdoors farming early in the morning when few people are online. Never really have any competition farming thorium in Silithus, outside of maybe 1 other person.
---
Our server has tons of warlocks, but not many hunters and mages around for raids. Although mages have slowly been on the rise...
---
Yes yes, run back to your corpse ;)
---
VW Sac is nice in PVP situations, as well.
---
I want the classic experience and that's what this is. I dont want endless hotfixes for random crap people want changed.
---
stinky
---
r/AITA
---
Or at least wait a few days.
---
Good server! I knew I recognized you! I play there too as Microphobiac the gnome warlock! :) Hit me up if you need someone to CoR you for the demon!
---
What version of the game are you playing?
---
I’ve been using TinyThreat for a month. It seems to be the most common threat meter for pugs.
---
And since everyone has to use the same threat meter for it to work, it seems to be the choice by popular demand.
---
Oh, right. Yeah, if IB is off cooldown, it'll probably buy you enough time to start eating and survive. But if you manage to beat a Warlock, it's likely on cooldown.
---
Warlocks are just hard counters to Mages, so there's no shame in dying to them. *They* should be ashamed if they lose to a Mage.
---
&gt; LF1M need dps BRD arena farm
---
Hey man hunter here I'll dps
---
&gt; LF1M need caster dps BRD arena farm
---
cuz they dont care about other people. to such an extent that they think it's OK
---
Well I Wasnt Too sure, had people act just like this and being serieus haha. He was Still fighting the mob but didnt want to invite me since I said ‘Inv plz’, which he thought was rude. He said he would wait for the respawn and help me kill it if I apologized??
---
What unit frames/UI options are you all using? I’ve never used a UI addon but I’m interested lately. Are there options that can display target cast bars?
---
that’s suppressed pain. we’re all suffering, to some degree. pity him.
---
Try NeatPlates! It tracks DoTs, adds visual nameplate threat and more!
---
This is what we are seeing with CTM. I will be far and ahead on threat, yet the mob is beating on one of our DPS. Its not being reliable at all. Really wish we could get the threat API.
---
It's not my preference. It's everyones preference. It's faster to do, and it yields a higher quality result. Why not do it? We're just educating the masses.
---
You need to use the pet with the skill you are trying to learn. After the pet uses the skill enough times you will learn it and then can teach it to any other pet that meets the requirements (and has enough TP).
---
I don't use intimidation on pve...good luck. Soon as you open its stunned, trap wing clip range and kite.
---
Vanish clears it. Going into stealth normally does not.
---
It means "a weapons put to better use by a DPS instead of a tank". Cause know what reduces the DPS damage potential more than tanks threat? Not giving them weapons when they drop.
---
And again, that aside.. tanks already get special consideration and priority on most loot. You want to up that to include weapons? In a raid that you can clear in blues but for some reason insist that all the DPS wait until 2-3 people have *everything* they could possibly want before they get anything? Yeah hard pass on your guild mate.
---
That means that you're being scared all the time when you use stealth. Duh, that's your class. You rely on it. Similarly, a hunter will not be out in the open without protection against a class he can't see. It's not being scared, it's being protected.
---
You need 425 in Bay of Storms to guarantee a catch.
---
As an orc, stick with gatorbite with your eye on BRD and getting Dreadforge Retaliator.  At 51 you can also buy Lord Alexander’s Battle axe from the AH for cheap usually.
---
how is this going to push people to retail when the same shit happens there?
---
The popularity of private servers is why classic is here.  Private servers were popular because they made quite a few quality of life changes (like removing spell batching and melee leeway), even if those changes were relatively small compared to something like a new patch or expansion.
---
Hello? FBI?
---
When Finkle's Lava Dredger dropped I was so excited but also very nervous about losing the roll, since I was still rocking a green "of healing" staff. 
---
No one else even rolled.
---
Will you still pay your subscription? If you won't, that's not a problem for you. If you will, that's not a problem for them.
---
Doesn’t work if toon is over lvl 30.  Name is reserved on the account.
---
Dammit, never did get that stupid sword back in the day.
---
No, just tried last night...
---
You can only buy game time which makes both versions of the game playable.
---
Gas weebs
---
I found it was competitive around aq40-naxx, but that's when my guildies started testing it seriously.
---
It is generally slightly less dps than fury but a whole lot more than arms, and aoes better if the pull lasts longer than a couple gcds.
---
I also found the slam rotation to be very fun to execute.
---
That 99 was clutch.
---
Poor Old Blanchy
---
Makes sense. Generally if I've had to burn through two ice barriers and two ice blocks I'm already dead lol. 
---
You're right though...winning against your foil class and then dying anyways is the worst.
---

and congrats on getting hitched!
---
How the fuck do people write these comments without cringing to themselves. Like holly fuck is this normal behavior?
---
I tank myself and find your response very odd indeed.
---
The only mass taunt that warriors have is challenging shout and it has a 10 minute cooldown. Most warrior tanks will stance dance finishing in defensive in order to tank multiple mobs, however, warriors need rage to use their abilities. If mobs are agro'd before we can connect then it is harder to build rage and do our job.
---
The way you write makes me believe that you are a DPS player who thinks they know what tanks should be doing but haven't actually tanked yourself
---
PS I am not saying you are not a tank, you just write like a DPS who is upset that they can't determine the pulls
---
This is tough for people to understand. It’s pure luck that an epic boe drops for your class and not mine. I can sell that boe to buy my bis. Sorry random stranger, I ain’t giving you 600 gold on pure luck.
---
Welp, I think you sound like a spoiled child.  Because you have to do more work in a game you play for fun.
---
My hero.
---
That sounds boring.
---
Not really b/s it shares deminishing return with fear.
---
Really? Is there some more info about that?
---
That’s not always how it works. Most of the time I blast you off of the thorium node, put up a trap and flare if you live, steal it from you, then ride away laughing.
---
Nothing is better than getting jumped on by a rogue and they pop evasion when they are winning, only to get overpowered to death.
---
I think this hits the nail on the head. "you can't rely on crit heals". I feel like i'd much rather know exactly how much each heal will land for so i'm in better control of the amount of overhealing. Any bit of overhealing is wasted mana anyway and it begins to reduce the effectiveness of MP5 anyway. On top of that, the more +healing you have, the more you can downrank and therefore save mana. I think zhouyu47 is spot on.
---
Forgot about that one! Ty
---
I started playing those games over summer. They're so great but I abandoned the them halfway through the second one when classic came out. Definitely gonna finish at some point though.
---
LOL cause they know you wont have time for raids anymore
---
I've been doing nothing but writing to Blizzard about how much I hated phasing, and I did and still don't, so I don't give a damn about you minmax raider farmer losers. It's MC. Who gives a crap about firewater? Get a life. I don't give a crap about you. Phasing ruined the game and I'm glad it's over
---
&gt; Imagine being so dumb
---
Or you know, he just doesn't care.
---
If I have to level another char again I'll cut my balls. Getting to 60 is a pain in the ass
---
I let them die till they leave
---
Ok, imagine you're at a party and someone comes in with a photo of something they're excited about. Do you share in their excitement, or tell them the photo is blurry and a hot tip for how to take better photos? Buddy, you are an asshole and don't even realize it.
---
Nope.  Loot Council it to the mage enchanter so he can DE it.
---
Even 2000 gold worth ? To a random?
---
Is that a happy fun rock? I assumed it was a single bullet which had me laughing my ass off
---
So what?  That's a free market, if no one is able to buy it, then the price will go down, if people are able to buy it with these prices, then it's not a problem, not to them at least.
---
Farm alt was a must for raiding main in vanilla and just to note the farm wasn't implying open world farm but dungeon one.
---
Worst cast scenario you will need 2 of them to ease the 5 dungeons per hour limit.
---
Lol, this is how the game is.  I know it’s really really confusing, but it turns out boe is not the same as bop! Shocker right! 
---
You WILL get ninjad over and over rolling greed.  You will get ninjad even on people needing that “can use it” and sell it on the AH.  
---
If you have a problem with it it’s your problem. You can try to mention it to the group before hand but people will probably boot you out to avoid a dumb argument or leave the group.
---
Random pugs are not full of your friends with your beliefs.  If you are with guildies or an all friends run do what you want.
---
I bet 90% of the people on here bitching about people not rolling greed on valuable blue/purple boes are not even level 40, and most don’t even understand how to itemize.
---
Lay off anime
---
In that case the guy can just say "Hey I really want that to equip can I have it?" and you give it to him?
---
It's really not that fucking hard lmao
---
Did you somehow disable your in-game chat?
---
There are countless better ways to make bank than flying to an endgame zone, collecting shards, flying back to a location where someone needs a summon, finding two people to summon and then what? Gain like a gold or two for the summon? You are all over this thread, and you sound like every lazy person that doesn't have the consideration to be on time for everyone else in your group.
---
Running for the twilight drake drop weekly, I can remember a lot of the player names who would regularly do mount runs.
---
In that case do you use the looking for group channel and channel 1 specifically to find groups forBRD? I thought it might be useful to use channel 2 in cities.
---
fair enough
---
So just to confirm you think the correct option is to take an in game screenshot, log into the browser based Snapchat app on the pc, navigate to the screenshot folder and upload it?
---
As long as you announce it to the others before you start then you're fine. Talk to people.
---
That's not a client issue, that's a serverside computational restriction and it's caused by Blizzard ramping up the number of calculations performed each server tick.
---
And Classic doesn't have this exact issue because it's a much less computationally intensive game than retail is. The server polls player positions less frequently, spells and effects are much less complicated, and there's a lot fewer updates each second compared to retail.
---
My mark is part of my engage macro. So I'll have an auto shot coming your way as soon as the mark is up
---
I dare you, little rogue.
---
I am hunter, and you are prey.
---
i did not. i was happy for him to get it, wasnt gonna try to capitalize on it

So sad :' (
---
Defense of Mulgore - That was my favourite memory
---
Ultimately it’s you giving him money, you have every right to the value as him. You shouldn’t feel bad and if you give him a discount at all then you are being a homie.
---
No I didn't say it was hard, I said it was harder questing as a resto druid than other classes. But of course you're too worried about trying to be an elitist prick to actually read a basic sentence.
---
75g on incendius when I looked last night, was hovering in the 50-55g the week before.  I've yet to find even a single one on my rogue
---
Guess that explains why it's so... bad. I have fond memories of it, but playing again in Classic, it's by far the worst to quest in as alliance.
---
report this. blizzard actually bans ninjas quite often
---
This isn't an in game marriage right?  This would go from awww to weird quickly.
---
Just make sure consecration from holy is picked up first
---
This happened to me once when I got mind controlled off a boat. After like 10 minutes of it I got disconnected and I was back at my hearth location
---
Well thats the issue really. giving me that second or so on the pull to get initial aggro saves a shit load of time with the healer not having to stop every 2 minutes to mana up. 
---
The idea that going DERP AOE SPAM KILL EVERYTHING makes the run go faster isnt real
---
but the icon isn't a bag of gold
---
only the light knows
---
As a nearly maxed tank myself, it’s honestly not as stressful as people make it out to be. The dungeons in classic just aren’t hard enough to stress you out that much. Most of the complaints from tanks in these threads can be solved by simple communication skills. DPS pulling aggro is something that can be fixed easily by just talking to your group instead of running away and whining on Reddit.
---
If I have a group that wants to push the pace and can handle it, I’m going to do my best to adapt to what they want to do. Likewise, if a group is struggling with how I pull packs then I change how I normally go about things to get us through. Setting the pace of a dungeon is more than just doing what you want to do - it’s a tanks job to adapt to their setting as much as it is for DPS. If I am pulling slow with a group that can obviously handle more, how much better am I than a shitty DPS?
---
I get really annoyed with the “my way or the highway” attitude of some tanks. Being stubborn and sticking to what you deem is the “right” way to do things is counterproductive. I’m not going to condone a tank dropping group without making decent effort to resolve the issue - that’s the opposite of leading a group, which is what tanking is all about.
---
I have multiple:
---
Playing on Firemaw-EU:
---
At the server launch me and my IRL friend skipped the starting zone since we knew about the layering. We invited some others that did too and we quickly built a group of 5 to kill level 5 mobs together. The game was still stuttering and we were seeing other people trying to get as far from the lags of the spawning zone as possible. Was fun!
---
Stranglethorn vale after launch was horrible. Like it was impossible to find mobs to kill since you would get outtaged. Also the constant pvp added more spice to it. I remember getting almost drowned by a priest' MC or I also had 3 troll rogues constantly corpse camping me. Back then I was really salty, but retrospectively looking it was fun .
---
So because of the constant ganking me and a friend of mine decided to dungeon level. Traveling to scarlet monastery as Alliance was really hard without a mount and it was even harder being a low level which on top of that was a horde controlled zone. So we came with this brilliant idea to travel with the zeppelin (TG&lt;-&gt;STV) and it was quite effective. You mostly would die twice but it was a really fast repair/buy/storage and it was less time consuming.
---
Around that level when I was doing my berserker stance quest and we met a horde that was also currently on it. We both spectated each other and nobody either disturbed nor helped the other. You really were dueling these warriors to get more knowledge. Also being witnessed in that made it a good memory.
---
I am not really strict about dungeon leveling, so sometimes I would do normal runs and sometimes spellcleave runs. Both had their advantages and disadvantages. I liked spellcleave groups a bit more because it was more challenging and just  a bit more rewarding than the usual dungeon clearing. The fun part was that you could get either a really good team with a really good synergy or the team that could not control nova / aggro / healing. It was perfect to try out and perfection the routine.
---
Around endgame I've met a Boomkin that couldn't care less about the race to raid gear / level 60. He was just on his boomkin dealing the most damage in the dungeon and having this really relaxed aura. We later became friends and it turned out that this guy has a huge classic knowledge and knows more than about my class than I do. He helps me from time to time to decide on stuff, a really nice guy.
---
Seeing a hunter roast all the bank accounts for the first time was astonishing.
---
Little do you dumb dumbs know its even better for druids with their HOTW
---
I don't think this is true, I name transfer between my accounts regularly with no wait.
---
Free Action Potions / Restorative Potions are not bind on pick up, so you can stock pile those as much as you want. Grenades for stuns and doing something when rooted or making your way back to melee distance are very valuable for a rogue.
---
Cept, I don't do more work for people like yourself... so now what's your plan of attack?
---
So you never press the greed button with that logic?
---
I'm honestly curious what they have going on in their back-end. We all know that everyone is virtualized. There is no single hardware host that represents a single server. It is likely a single host that has a dozen or so virtualized servers running on it. Why is performance so horrid when no more than 80 people show up within a specific area?  This stuff wasn't as big of an issue in the past, it was mostly fps issues due to lower end computers.
---
I thought you were sad?
---
If it’s pubs and it’s worth a lot, it’s worth exactly equal amounts for each member. Say an item is 500gold, it’s bis for you. It’s still worth 500gold to you and 500 gold to me. You “save” 500gold and I earn 500gold. Every boe is equal value to all party members.
---
HOLY SHIT THANK YOU!
---
I’m new to WoW playing Classic, and was always told “Need = your character physically needs it, Greed = you don’t physically need it but will take it for the gold.”
---
Then I was running Uldaman with my mates and TWO excellent Rogue items (one blue one purple) came up that they literally could not equip, but they all rolled Need because they were BOE and “they go for good money on AH, it would be a mistake for you to equip this.”
---
I was pissed as rolling for something just to sell it is the epitome of “Greed” (fuck there’s even a gold picture next to the Greed option), but they told me it’s common practice for everyone to roll Need on BOE’s.
---
So...are they full of shit or am I just an ignorant noob?
---
The problem is he then needs to farm enough to summon what sounds like a bunch of stragglers, then needs to also farm enough for their health stones, then needs to also somehow farm enough for his rotation, he probably runs out of bag space.
---
People can just try and make their own way their, healthstones and soulstones sure he needs to provide those.
---
Just 10 minutes ago i saw someone on my server looking to pay 2000 gold for this. And pvp hasn't even released yet.
---
I Ran Strat and Scholo for my gear half a dozen times each, almost revered, and still need to run it for gear. If you're going after certain gear from dungeons you'll be doing it anyways. Might as well leave all that free gold and reputation for post-revered.
---
I got 60 without touching EPL / WPL , instead doing BRD and other quest zones. please tell me how it sounds boring.
---
Imagine a world where people refuse to use LOCKS (roll need) on their possessions and then complain about the rampant theft problem.  Just roll need on stuff Jesus it's very simple. If someone truly needs the book even after you all roll need then tell him to buy it off the AH. Or let him have it. Your choice. But at least in this scenario you absolutely cannot be ninjaed.
---
Sure, for useless trash groups that absolutely don't need to be pulled.  But ones where only people over a certain level can skip it if they run through a certain way?  Easier just to clear it.
---
Even then, I don't mind it when people take the extra minute to clear the pack because a decent percentage of the time I've been in a group that has wiped it's because a runner, a fear, or just an errant player backpedaling has pulled a pack that was skipped to save a minute. 
---
Like, skipping those packs, you'd have to do it upwards of 100 times to equal just one extra run.  And if that pack ends up causing a wipe 1 in 10 times, you actually lose time or maybe break even by skipping it.
---
So you’re saying only one person has the right to enjoy the fruit of everyones labour. Got it.
---
If you dont like blizzards product why are you playing it?
---
It is nice for when mobs are spread out a b it.
---
Consecrate only works once mobs are grouped.
---
It's the only zone in the oldest screenshots.
---
New to wow.  Have a 47 feral druid and want to try tanking.  Completely specd and geared cat.  Where would be the best place to start and get experience.  I shouldnt need to respec just to try it, right?  Also, can u make macros for marking?
---
None man. I don't raid with you I just think this whole post is ridiculous.
---
55 is minimum for the attune quest chain
---
Still not getting why Shatter is left out of most builds i see, anyone who can enlighten me ?
---
It actually is a reference to a TV show.
---
Yes they did, Northdale had over 7kpeople online most of the time.
---
Blackrock mountain and world pvp events with 300+ didnt lag like this at all.
---
How do I soom out in Leatrix? I can only see areas etc. but can't zoom out to view the complete world map or continent?
---
I dont why people think this is ninjaing but they are okay with needing BoE epics. Same logic can be applied here. I need this book to sell so I can buy my own book.
---
Literally?
---
Great answer. Pretty compelling. Thanks.
---
Yep.
---
Yea but its instant cast and they're guaranteed to stay in range for a soul fire
---
Need is need. Greed is greed.
---
If someone needs for greed, they are a ninja.
---
It's fairly simple.
---
I would like to play something that operates similarly to Classic WoW but makes each spec viable for raiding.  The dynamic of some blues being better than epics is really fun also. I like classic loot because it’s all so unique.
---
6% is all you need with 305 or 307. 9% with 300.
---
Copying my reply here from the other thread on the topic:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/doqhrd/free\_character\_xfer\_to\_arcanite\_reaper\_how\_is\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/doqhrd/free_character_xfer_to_arcanite_reaper_how_is_the/) 
---
Been on AR since the server started. It has been pretty pleasant. At normal hours there's always people looking for groups so it doesn't take too long to find a dungeon. Just enough opposing factions to have a small fight occasionally going in the major zones. Never once had a queue. A little slow for my liking I think but not so bad that it causes problems.
---
Everything I have won (boe purples or blues that are really valuable) I offer it to the person who can use it for a discount. If they requested it before the run I have 0 problem giving it to them. Otherwise its fair game IMO.
---
Your bank alt should be level 5 for disenchant. fail!
---
HEY! I am from Norway too :D Brunost/ostehøvel ftw!
---
Casting*?
---
12g as a mage? Petty.
---
Prob a Huntard
---
How has this not been fixed yet? Pathetic.
---
faction no ... server yes because my server is dominated by horde
---
Favorite memory is walking into Ragefire Chasm for the first time and being amazed at the atmosphere, in particular the heat vents with the lava. Can't beat that sense of amazement.
---
GL everyone!
---
The enrage timers in Classic are *very* generous.
---
What can a 33 shadow priest have in their arsenal to mess up the AoE grinding that a *rude* mage does? 
---
Not talking about the mages that do it. But the ones that snicker or /rude after literally no interaction while I'm simply waiting for mobs to respawn.
---
Even if you'd had freefarm you may have still had 0 runes, fuck that drop rate. I farmed for roughly 6 hours total for my RotV
---
False,
---
Best thing about being level 60 is getting hot chicks.
---
I had a Shaman MS Healer come in a BRD run AS A DPS and insisted that he rolls on healing gear. 
---
Me being the Priest healer for this group WASN'T happy at all (he rolled need on some cloth healing gear that i ultimately won). And had to make it clear that it needs to be "Roll on what you signed up for".. I then had the tank and this dps both disagree and say that since he is MS healer he should roll on it as well. My argument back was that if he wanted to roll on healing gear then he should have signed up as a healer and not a DPS.
---
TLDR: If you Queue DPS you have no right to roll NEED on items that a MAIN SPEC HEALER NEEDS. Its just common sense and courtesy.
---
So your commute sucks?
---
Classic is a separate version of the game and took (a lot of) development time.
---
/shrug
---
&gt;your example of BFA capped at 60 is in no way shape or form that product so no they could not have just done that
---
But that is "the easiest path", as the other guy is accusing Blizzard of doing.
---
Remember that at one point during legacy-server discussion, Blizzard suggested giving us realms that had no LFD or LFR. That's what they thought we wanted when we said "legacy servers".
---
Wait really now i beg for Geddon to Cast Living Bomb on my Pet. Could wipe out a raid that just got Ony Buff :)
---
Tank like that.
---
Why is there grey area here - shouldn’t if just be “if you need it for your character to physically equip roll Need, if not roll Greed for everything?”
---
Who’s to decide what is “expensive” enough to count for a mage rolling Need on some Plate armor?  That just leads to confusion and anger.
---
In like week 3 of classic when my guild did our first Mc clear I only had mana issues on golemagg and rag, so depending on how good your guild is rag should be the only boss to cause you mana issues even if you one phase him. One max mana gem + a shitty mana pot off the ah and I'm good for all of Mc. SP&gt;INT in raids, also crit &gt; hit if your guild is semi decent and kills things at a good rate. Hit is only really valuable when you're putting a bunch of frostbolts into a target but if they die so fast that you can't get much then crit is the way to go.
---
My personal favourite, you have 5s left on bloodrage, so you are waiting another 3 seconds or so before charge.
---
Then the mage pulls.   Now you get no charge, so you have no rage, so you can't get aggro, so you don't generate rage...
---
Damn I'm getting annoyed just describing it
---
Int is very low value in terms of dps. Like 1 sp = 5-6ish INT.
---
Assuming the person is on the same faction as you, fear the mobs when they are not frost nova'd.  That way they run in a random pattern out of the Blizzard.
---
He can also check math. There are 30 days in a month and you spent nearly 22 of them playing WoW. 
---
That’s &gt;17 hours/day *period*. 
---
Math doesn’t lie. You do.
---
WhAt No ShAmAn
---
well i was but what brought me back up was thinking of the dude just going "WOW HELL YES" at his computer. I also looted Blackstone Ring moments before so I was in a good mood.
---
I never thought about it like that but in a world of business and money this makes perfect sense
---
sorry im on the spectrum and sometimes dont realise when people make obvious jokes.
---
Unfortunately that's not possible. You cant have both Horde and Alliance chars on a single PVP realm.
---
Also I hope this isn't a r/whoosh..
---
Don’t logic around here. I got a group pissed off last night when I said “all need on boe”. I went on to explain those items have equal value to all party members because it’s just gold. 
---
Also I don’t know you and probably don’t like you, why would I allow you to take an item worth gold away from me.
---
Establish rules at the outset. Or, shock horror, run with guildies who trust each other. Or friends you've made while levelling. :)
---
Not always an option, but being able to trust the people in your party goes a long way towards an amenable experience.
---
Are those screenshots still available to view somewhere?
---
Imagine a world where instead of a BOE dropping, for example the one in OP, instead a Container drops, and said Container contains a large sum of gold - Would I be eligible to roll need on it because I can use that gold to buy my Holy bologna: What the light Won't tell you? Of course not. We'd all take it and buy our own individual BOEs with it. This idea that need rolling a boe = use it is completely stupid to me because everyone can use the BOE for something other than what it is (i.e. trade the book for the hunter book as an example)
---
Same as when gnomes call your gnome a "tall one".
---
*Laughs in Subtlety*
---
I noticed you could buff someone in combat with wisdom and not enter combat yourself. Is this a thing that happens with other buffs, or just heals?
---
But do you just need the attune to enter? Just lvl 55+ and the attume?
---
I use shadow unit frames. 
---
Add on is called “classic cast bars”
---
Full group = faster clears = more arcane crystals.
---
With a full group, the runs are approximately 12 minutes. (that is, given no extra trash pulls or people dying or whatever)
---
I'm a mage main, and I spent a lot of time in dungeons leveling. I shudder to think how much worse it could have been, then, because I ran into these mages a LOT. And they would flame me for not behaving like them. Like, yeah dude, we have two mages, but nobody else has aoe, so can we just dps single targets, which we're also really good at doing?
---
If you smell shit everywhere you go maybe check your own shoes
---
Spell damage I’m sure would increase your dps more in raids, but that looks pretty nice for Wpvp.
---
Oh I'm completely fine with using APES footage in fair use. Just.. a little less of it would've been cool in an eHEROES video I suppose
---
The Blizzard we all loved growing up is dead.
---
It’s for PvP. I’m pretty sure Book of the Dead also has stamina on it. So you could potentially use it if you need the extra health on a raid fight. 
---
Otherwise it’s use is for PvP only and you’d be better off with 20sp for PvE
---
I've seen saps and sheeps and banishes.

for me it was the other way around, got like 2 or 3 bracers until i finally got the shoulders
---
and on my mage i got the bracers on the first kill\^\^

You should post your name and server so people can /ignore you now instead of waiting for you to fuck them over first.
---
How is lfg addon worse than porting you to a dungeon with people you never spoke with before and will likely never see again? That damages the sense of community by a lot and community is a pillar of Vanilla's game design. 
---
Do you realize lfg addons only parse chat channels? That's it.
---
We are not going to agree and that's ok but your points make zero logical sense.
---
Sounds like you made your choice, enjoy spamming chat channels. You have no right to complain now.
---
That’s shitty imo...so if I’m a Rogue that really needs this sweet leather helm with high Agility, you as a mage are going to roll Need because you can sell it for some gold?
---
Isn’t what you’re doing literally the definition of Greed?
---
Tell your tank to pull faster.
---
If you 'assist' the tank in pulling faster, you likely will die faster.
---
Tanks can 'easily lose' aggro on a specific mob sometimes ... ;);)
---
young tigers/panthers
---
Also if you are a ghost/spirit when you visit the shrine you’ll see his character standing there too.
---
Obviously yes. I'm on my phone but you can just look it up. 
---
There are many articles from before vanilla and many since that have collected everything. Many recent youtube videos too that have collected everything for your easy viewing experience.
---
You can't post the name if you are telling people to not group with blacklist because he rolls need on DM books for other classes.  Posting a name and saying he did this fact and fact without selectively editing parts of the conversation or where they call out all books are FFA at the start of the dungeon are allowed.  
---
To me this is "positive light" that we can all gather around this guy and celebrate his skipping the auction house hustle and getting the book directly from the dungeon.
---
Idk if it's underrated per-say, but horde Hinterlands was a ton of fun in my opinion. Loads of quests that could all be done fairly quickly, most of which had excessive amounts of cash rewards. That's not to mention the 6 elite quests to do in Jin'thalor which gave a ton of exp from both killing mobs and turning in quests (As a healer leveling in a group is way faster lol). I also just really appreciated the change in scenery over the bleak deserts and empty wastelands that comprise most of the horde leveling zones.
---
It might be okay in wPvP but for raids Spirit of Aquementas is our bis currently.
---
Edit: warlock main

It's getting harder and harder to find dungeon groups as a holy paladin. I'm level 52 and I can not get into brd. In 4 days that I've been trying I've gotten into 1 group. There are just way too many other healers looking for the same runs. The game is just over saturated with healers right now and I don't know what to do. Holy paladin is MY class, it's the only class/spec that I enjoy, and it's unplayable right now. I've tried playing a few alts and I just don't enjoy them as much, but when I log into my paladin I spend hours sitting in IF spamming LFG with no luck. I considered respecting prot and tanking my own brd runs all the way to 60 but I've never played a prot pally and when I think about it, it just doesn't interest me at all. Plus I'll be missing out on all the healer gear that I could be getting along the way.
---
I don't know how to proceed. I'm getting really discouraged from even playing the game after not missing a single day since release.
---
Wc2 and Wc3 got me so invested in this universe. Then Vanilla got announced! the world i had met and loved was about to get way bigger and there will be a space for me and thousands of adventures. Wc3 Frozen Throne made me fall in love with the Night Elves and admire the power and majesty of Malfurion Stormrage . That first moment after creating my first night elf hunter , when the introductory cinematic ended , i just stopped to admire the reclusive , even hidden sanctuary atmosphere of Aldrassil , the music started and then it hit me : I’m home .
---
So it looks...empty?
---
Not for everyone.
---
Just the necklace from the attune, I don’t believe there is actually a level requirement outside of the implicit one for the neck. I did my first Ony clear at 57.
---
Is it available thru the twitch client?
---
Just out of curiosity, why Herod if you want to play Alliance? It's probably one of the most unbalanced servers (with a favor for Horde). I have an alt on Herod and it feels more like a PvE server for Horde than it does PvP to be honest.
---
Check out warcraftlogs. Lots of high ranking players have exactly 6% hit.
---
They also most often use slow MH, fast OH.
---
i hope you sold it for that 1200 gold...

I mean, you don't need to give me a reason to take my pants off, but if I needed one, there it is. I'll give that a shot. Thanks.
---
Totally not addressing his problem and just implicitly shaming him for a play style you don’t condone. People must love you
---
Super useful video dude! I wasn’t too sure on understanding hit rating, weapon exp, crit chance , etc. This video helped clarify a lot not just for daggers but for any spec in regards to raiding. 
---
Few side questions do you have videos of you doing comparison tests to a sword spec? Is this dps spec more ideal in raiding or would you say it depends on what weapons/gear you get would determine it?
---
Would you consider killing a critter pve? I blinked and died. Not really "player vs player".
---
Yep yep.
---
Plus, if everyone needed on BoP gear, nobody would ever get the loot they need from dungeons.
---
But BoE gear can be bought on the AH at any time.
---
you should be perfectly fine with your current gear and spec. try something a bit below your level just to be sure. maybe zf or something. as for marking, you can bind them in the default blizzard options, but if for whatever reason you want these buttons on your action bar i can not help you.
---
I give them warning, then either say the belligerent player goes or I do.  
---
Been doing that in every game since 2001, did it for 6 freaking years in retail. Always went fine.  
---
The only really bad occasion I had was in late WotLK. I'd already been tanking through ICC10H, I'm a very experienced tank (had been progression raiding since AQ at that point). Was doing a quick heroic run with 4 members from a different guild (one that wasn't infamous or anything, I'd played with some of their people before and they'd subbed in on some of our weekly activities).
---
I was tanking on my Blood/Unholy hybrid DK (a spec I found extremely viable for having continuous self healing and had used to great success solo finishing split-hair raid bosses) when the other DK and the healer both said "Blood isn't tank spec for DK you idiot, you need to be frost". My response was "trust me, I know what I'm doing, if it actually poses a problem I"ll leave". Meanwhile, I was 100% confident in my ability to tank through no problem.
---
The other DK began to pull ahead of me, and the other healer refused to heal me. He would rez me and say "you wouldn't have died if you were frost, see the other DK is fine and he's frost.
---
After enough deaths a piece of armor finally broke, I told them to either stop fucking with me or I'll leave. They said they weren't doing anything and I was just a bad tank and booted me.
---
Never saw the guys again, but I do know that I cleared ICC25H before that guild did so I'm not too hurt about it.
---
You must be in a bad raid group if you don't have locks in the top xD
---
That's an awesome nod. I've been meaning to watch Trading Places recently and you just reminded me. I also love Coming to America.
---
2/10 post.
---
&gt;The standard rule is **not** needing on every BoE
---
This just isn't true. It's very standard among experienced players to need on valuable BoE's, but you can always communicate with your group or do a reroll afterwards. Just don't open yourself up to ninjas for no reason.
---
Yeah it’s nice for duels but the horde will never understand! 😭
---
Alright, I watched this very closely, and I'm going to deliver the hard truth:
---
That isn't a bug. Well, not in the way you think.
---
The first vanish shows very clearly what happens, but both situations are the same: the mob is in the middle of an attack when the vanish activates. You can clearly see this at 0:06 when the back Anvilrage Soldier attacks just after vanish is activated. The second vanish it is far more tricky, but the front second Anvilrage Soldier is in the middle of attacking the exact split second he vanishes.
---
So the actual bug is that he was still in stealth after failing to vanish the second time.
---
All of this is assuming no resists, which we don't see but also don't have the combat log to verify.
---
EDIT: To clarify, I'm only specifying what I'm seeing as intended functionality, not whether this should be the intended functionality or not.
---
Hey, how certain are you about Onyxia head being 6 hrs, and do you have any sources for it? I need to time one properly soon and I can't seem to find any definitive 100% concrete information. Thanks!
---
I mean you could say this about anything.
---
My best wow memory, is finally getting my mount on classic, since i was too young to fully grasp the concept of wow in vanilla 15 years ago, was only 12 back then, but the nostalgia is real.
---
Bad idea, serpent sting will break scatter shot and trap
---
My homing pigeon is down, can you resend?
---
Or when the heal animation goes off, the spell takes your mana but the spell doesn't heal and your tank dies. Fantastic game design.
---
How does this economy make farming easier? Maybe I'm missing it as I just started playing but wouldn't more people farming drop prices of everything? So whatever you try to sell is actually less?
---
Oh is that what you appreciates about me?
---
In Wow classic, you begin as a normal civilian and therefore a young Warrior. Classic is never wrong.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Not OP, but I'm currently doing something like this. Takes me on average about 1day 18hours so far to get to 40.  
---
Classes leveled so far  
---
1. Warlock
---
2. Druid
---
3. Priest
---
4. Mage
---
Fastest leveling for me personally went:  Warlock &gt;= Druid, Priest, Mage
---
Warlock and Druid were roughly on point. Warlock affliction pet leveling build makes downtime on the low end and Druid downtime was on the low spectrum as well.
---
Priest was able to beat mage in terms of speed due to the disc / shadow wand build that equated to low - zero downtime.
---
Mage was last because the downtime was the longest. Aoe grinding was out of the question due to high contested zones.
---
That’s classic baby.
---
The only difference in survival talents between deep prot and fury prot is -5% parry and -10 Defense. This certainly doesnt yeild 40% more damage taken, so I think what you are talking about relates to the gear choices. Fury tanks can wear just as much mitigation gear as deep prot tanks, in which case they should only take 5% more damage when sword/board (due to lost parry). 
---
The difference is Fury prot can swap things around mid raid to generate more threat if needed, and in exchange take more damage. Deep prot cant do this to the same degree. These is no logical reason fury prot would neccesitate taking 40% more damage.
---
I can’t confirm, I have an alt on there but she’s a Shaman, so Horde. Every one I’ve seen talk about Herod says it’s a really bad split in favor of Horde and it feels that way so far, but I’m not anywhere near end game content on that server.
---
spent hours on it and now you hate it
---
go to retail you zoomer
---
Sometime its effective preferably if he communicates with the tank to pull multi packs so u on the same page.  
---
When a mage wants you to pull multiple packs, you obviously cant keep threat on them but that isnt the point, the point is to group them all up tight and aoe blast them while they controlled in nova and slowed.
---
Implying you would need to use those in the next 15 seconds
---
Well that just turned dark lol.
---
I totally agree but if he asks ahead of time then it gives you a chance to say exactly that
---
free action potion
---
The item you get from disenchanting is not affected by your enchanting level. That is why a level 5 with 1 enchanting is perfectly valid to disenchant all items.
---
There are SO many people in the game, running so many dungeons, getting so many greens, that the supply of dust and essenses is huge right now, except for the level 50-60 disenchants. A lot of people want those high end enchants so those are the only materials worth anything.
---
Sure bro. Having fun is what matters!
---
Anywhere would like darnassus through a purple filter.
---
I'm just amused this argument has been going on [for FIFTEEN YEARS](https://i.imgur.com/Ksrgalw.jpg)
---
By yet do you mean ever? WoW has always been like this. It was like this in 2005 and it is like this in retail now.
---
Gettin real personal and real committed to the post for someone who finds it ridiculous though.. you sure you're gonna be okay?
---
yeah i mean 4 real this guy is a real SKUM no women would EVER MARRY a THIEF taking 12 GOLD FROM FELLOW WOW REDDITORS
---
&gt;You just admitted the fault in this line of thinking though, if you were a "good person" in the first place you should just greed 
---
a good person isn't necessarily naive and trusting, for as long as I have played (since vanilla), it's a known thing that everyone in pug groups rolls need on BoEs, it is the only foolproof way to protect yourself from ninjas. 
---
And it's not up to me, if it is an upgrade to their current gear, they need it, it's that simple. But always needing on BoEs allows for honest people to be protected from dishonest ones.
---
Use that shit to get their entire guild blacklisted on your server. Classic community is no joke. If they ninja and bs with loot, no one will want to help them. Inform as many GMs as you can.
---
if I played on gehennas I'd end up rerolling due to this, not saying you should, I think Blizzard should fix this shit
---
Gehennas here, try to pick a "not rush hour"-time of day for mining. 3-6am servertime suits me well
---
My favorite memory was playing Burning Crusade with my best friend at launch, and then for days after as we got snow day after snow day!
---
Imagine this asshole got a wife and you dont. lol
---
Youre skipping over the problem, saying "Hey Blizzard OFFERED you to change servers so dont complain about the huge population!" is the dumbest thing ive ever read.   
---
The huge population is a problem BECAUSE Blizzard decided that a server needed 30x more players than a normal classic server AND THEN told people Layering was necessary because of the huge amount of people
---
Where’s that standard stated?  If I read it from a Blizzard official post or content, then my perspective is clearly wrong.  But as I recall vanilla, my way has always been correct within a pug, cause you can’t trust people.
---
In that example, even as the tank, I’m mixed, get that it’s a big deal, but so are the best in slot items that can be found on the AH for others.
---
If I saved up and bought one already, would I be able to claim this one as mine, just so I recoup my expenses?
---
The game goes beyond the party and the instance, and at much easier to let everyone have a shot at an item over rather than hear justifications for need roles.
---
Are you?
---
I understand this is bad. But if no one else needs it, it isn’t that bad right? Like it looks like he’s the only one who need rolled so no once else needed it, it’s not like he stole directly from someone who actually needed it.
---
That's not exactly how that works.  I'm not convinced you know what you're talking about at this point
---
Sulfuras Alli seem to have 10x Healers for every DPS looking for group. Your server is probably similar. Tanks however, there is a **huge** demand for tanks 50+
---
Quality
---
I wish I could sell Ontario to a vendor.  Probably worth 50s
---
This
---
So like pre raid stuff or?
---
This has been my strategy since hitting 60 a few weeks ago and has been working fine.
---
Imagine ninjaing for like 30g.
---
No videos on comparing to sword spec, but I plan on making a combat sword video in the near future. 
---
This spec is more ideal for raiding, daggers in general want longer fights to get their damage across. Longer the fight, more hits we get in due to our weapon speed, more critical strikes = more damage! 
---
This spec is okay for Dungeons but dont be surprised to be much lower on meters than on raid bosses. Thanks for the support friend!
---
You are never going to get enough people to agree on this for it to happen.  It's nice to think that it would be that way, but it won't.
---
Of course!
---
What build warrior?
---
Those levels went quite quickly for me and I was surprised. If you focus on finishing your quests in Tanaris, Searing Gorge, and STV then it won’t take you too long. There are also quests to be found in Ferelas and Hinterlands that are fun, but not as important as they aren’t quite as exp dense. However, there are quests from Tanaris to send you to both zones and a quest in Ferelas that sends you to hinterlands. You can knock out a few birds with one stone questing-wise if you play your cards right.
---
I would get all the quests for ZF and run it once or twice around 45-47 then quest the rest of the way unless you see easy spots opening up and you’re already in Tanaris. If you’re a warrior then you can probably tank and should have no problem getting a spot. Get all the quests that take you to the pirates on the east coast, and find a group to grind them - the quest items are scarce and you can simultaneously knock out one of the tricky wanted quest and some other quests as well.
---
There are also a ton of quests for Uldaman and you can knock those out in your early-mid 40s. If you’re alliance they’re mostly available in IF.    
---
STV 40-45 quests seem daunting but can be done real quick with a small group and reward good vendor loot and experience. 
---
I find it more fun to vary content then just grind through one dungeon. ZF is good for that but it won’t be that interesting and you will get all the relevant gear quickly. I’d just be methodical about your questing and join groups as much as you can - especially in Tanaris and STV.
---
In the link it says:
---
&gt; If you're planning to take what you read here and apply it to other private servers, note that prior to patch 1.8 you'll encounter the dual wielding hit hardcap.  
---
&gt;When dual wielding, basic / white attacks will always have a 19% chance to miss, no matter how much +hit you have. This cap was removed in patch 1.8. 
---
Doesn't this mean that the hard cap for hit % is 8%? Using the same attack table format as the link uses:
---
6% hit, 14% crit:
---
If the game rolls 1-209, you'll miss.  
---
If the game rolls 210-274, you'll be dodged.  
---
If the game rolls 275-674, you'll glance.  
---
If the game rolls 675-814, you'll crit.  
---
If the game rolls 815-1000, you'll hit, no crit. 
---
8% hit, 14% crit:
---
If the game rolls 1-189, you'll miss.  
---
If the game rolls 190-254, you'll be dodged.  
---
If the game rolls 255-654, you'll glance.  
---
If the game rolls 655-794, you'll crit.  
---
If the game rolls 795-1000, you'll hit, no crit. 
---
Note that with these rules, 9% hit and above does nothing for your white hit damage because there is a hit hardcap of 19%, 8% hit reduces the miss chance from 27% =&gt; 19%, it cannot go any lower. This does not seem right? Thoughts?
---
winning my guilds first and only zg raptor mount
---
used that raptor and that raptor only up until I quit at the end of wotlk cuz my dwarf looked badass on it
---
I’m aware of what he’s talking about. And both players probably rolled need, as is the standard. NOBODY is going through the trouble of this fair market value bullshit, you roll and say grats if you don’t win.
---
That is disappointing.
---
You do realize that you said not that much dungeon loot is contested and then gave examples for everything but neck (quest item), bracers, and belt right? If every piece of dungeon-obtained gear but two pieces is contested that is a lot...
---
I would love to know how to do this. I haven't been able to find the setting yet and it gets really annoying with all the LUA errors coming at me from addons.
---
You'll still be severely outnumbered by Horde sadly.
---
What else is there to do
---
When I make my hunter, Would you be so kind to help me get echayakee sometime? It’s summoned from a horde only quest in the barrens. I can farm up some gold and buy something off ratchet AH from you if it would help.
---
More damage taken is more.rage which is the same function as charging.   But there's no reason your charge should.be on cd lol...
---
Wow. Rattlegore sells the eel for 10-15s and the oil for 20s. I'm jealous.

Both systems are common.  I think Roll need on BoE is more fair.  But I understand why some disagree.  Ultimately it should be clearly stated before the run.

---
defeating ragnaros
---
Piss off wife or piss off random internet people. Not saying I condone it but I understand
---
Personally I never believe any of these stories on reddit about stuff like this because somehow it always involves the player being some flamboyantly dickish person (yeah first he pulled mobs for me then he called me a slew of racist messages, then he killed my dog and fucked my wife)
---
but that aside I also think you should leave because clearly you guys have different strategies, and while you think that you as the tank are defacto dictator and chief of the group and thus only your strategy goes that's not actually true and you should probably find a group of equally skilled individuals and hope they pull slowly and go at your pace
---
ah yes. the old "tanking is hard. if the tank dies in the group its gonna be a wipe so the shatter mage pulling aggro actively preventing the tank from taking dmage is gonna cause the tank to die and the group to wipe."
---
i have no problem with shatter mages in my groups. 9 times out of 10 they either kite the mob til its dead or ice block. not a big deal.
---
you need to work on teaching your hunters that if theyre gonna send a multishot downrange with the tank as he charges in he should immediately follow it with a feign death. and teach your dps warriors that forgot their shield at home to at least give a few seconds before whirlwinding.
---
He was the only one selecting need in the screenshot above. Asking would have been reasonable.
---
I swear to god if you pull another mob I will leave. 10 seconds later MknightShamalant pulls the boss.... I just herthed and left the party. They are hopefully still looking for a tank to this day.
---
We are heavily outnumbered at least 10% more horde. We just gathered pretty much 6 of the biggest guilds on the server
---
What guild? What server? I'll re-roll to have some decent humans.
---
How much gold/hr do you make on average with pickpocketing?
---
Spell hit &gt; spell power &gt; spell crit &gt;&gt;&gt; int
---
All int gives you is a little bit of crit and some mana, and you shouldn't be running out of mana if you're drinking every chance you get.
---
If you want to top charts, the more spell power the better.
---
If they stun lock into blind into gouge they can kill you before you can feign trap. Most don’t execute that well enough though
---
I read every raid likes one just to hit the boss with nightfall and wind fury
---
&gt; Who’s to decide what is “expensive” enough to count 
---
The answer is whoever is hitting the need/greed buttons.  There are items that are so valuable they can single handedly pay for epic mounts or the BiS epic for your class. In a guild run im going to give my guildie the expensive items, but if I'm cruising with randoms, I'm going to take the item and buy whatever i want with my mountain of gold.  It's probably not worth it to tick people off and potentially get booted from runs over a 20g item, but if something like edgemaster's handguards drop, why would you care about randoms in your group over 500g?
---
depends on what your goals are with it. for usefulness its always engineering both for pve and pvp. you wont make gold with any crafting profession because that would require rare recipes not many ppl has. but the fact that you are asking for advice tells me that you are already late for that. so to make gold you will need a gathering profession. mining is great, herbalism is great. skinning only worth it if you can get devilsaur leather wich is highly contested. of course you being late on recipes could change in the next phases so in the very long run, crafting profs could work out aswell. with all this being said i would suggest mining engineering
---
You are probably just not noticing it if you've already trained it; the logo looks a ton like mind blast and comes immediately after it in the spellbook. Find mind blast, look at the highest rank; does it say "mind control" instead?
---
Exactly! In PUGs Epic BOEs are just a lump sum of gold that everyone in the group can use.
---
well at least for rogues, being combat sword spec means you don’t have points in improved sap.. and in classic, sapping removes stealth... so sure we can sap but we’re also gonna pull..
---
Can you source this?  Because my experience playing this new classic, versus old vanilla.  Because it definitely doesnt appear to be this way.  An in fact, ive read about lumping actions together in a batch process to save resources which is less responsive.  
---
So what you're saying would go against the corporate culture of saving money/resources at the cost of user experience.  Which Blizzard is definitely guilty of these days.
---
*cries in 30 minute cooldown*
---
Half of us teleported out because there were reports sw is under attack. That enabled the lag to stabilize. Before we got back together our forces were already in a full blown retreat. But fair play to you there was still a shit ton of people to fight against and you manged to gather a massive counter strike quite fast
---
Not really a single memory, but more of a memory of a period of time. I have a fond memory of Auberdine back when I started playing in TBC. I first saw the game in Darkshore(when I was watching someone else play), and fell in love with the zone since. Auberdine was at the core of this though and besides the dark/gloomy atmosphere+ the music, I loved it because it was the 'hub' of the zone, and I came into contact with a lot of other players.
---
 I'd say the Auberdine docks more specifically. I've always had a memory of the boats arriving and hearing the sound once they'd arrive. As for coming into contact with a lot of other players, I ran into so many people at the Auberdine docks. I guess I just asked lots of people for help there, and added a few people at the time. One of them was a super good WoW friend of mine, and we'd help each other out all the time, until we both started to quit playing at one point, so I haven't seen much of them lately, but I'll never forget how good of a WoW friend they were to me. Auberdine docks have such an importance to the start of my WoW playing, that I was pretty sad when they destroyed it in Cataclysm.
---
Can also bank the item
---
No I’m saying no because what you’re proposing is ridiculous. If Warden Staff stopes in a dungeon the winner shouldn’t be expected to pay every other player 30-40g. That is asinine.
---
Thinking you had to hit 1 for each individual attack in the private beta for classic. I was just turning on and off auto-attack. Pretty stupid but seeing Azeroth for the first time like that was incredible.
---
i barely feel like world buffing or raids.
---
"make like a tree and fuck off"
---
You are also level 52, which is on the low side. Sure, you can be any level for heals to land. But your aggro radius is bigger so the group can't skip packs like normal.  I think you will have a lot easier time finding a group as a level 56+ for the easier portions such as arena, lava run to the MC, and jail.
---
Asscandy repping here. I know how it is. I did it the other day and there was three solo, and a group of two there, all alliance. I shouted in general multiple times to group up and no one responded.
---
mate when there is 600 players in 1 spot all the hardware in the world won't help you when your network clogs up

It's more like regular dungeons are tuned with mythic+ in mind so they have to be incredibly easy else a +200% damage &amp; health keystone would be insane

RE: Elemental Fire, Blizzard fucked up big time not putting in the Heart of Fire to Elemental Fire transmute on day one.

If you can kill the bugs, which I suspect you can if you do one pack at a time and use this same spot, this method for killing Mol'dar is a lot cleaner and you don't have to worry about him evading and recovering HP.

---
It isn't. Stop with your ninja looting shit. Just yesterday I had 2 high value BoE drops, where one went away for greed and another to someone equipping it. As long as no one states at the group start 'need on BoE' you aren't allowed to need to sell. Easy as that. State your shit rule if you want people to follow it or else greed to sell.
---
He's DW fury, pretty much BiS (and so am I). Don't think he ever swaps to shield so he can keep up his damage. On the last boss I basically spam heal him, using a spare GCD here and there to get in a bit of dps.
---
Of course it would be better, but the question is, do  players want a better game or a recreation of Vanilla.
---
The majority of the community agreed on Nochanges, it would be  hypocritical to want changes now that the game is out and you realize all the defaults
---
Blizzard upped the computational complexity of the game at Warlords of Draenor launch. That's how they were able to design the mything Imperator Mar'gok fight which requires polling each raid member's position in three axes.
---
Magitards.
---
I thought the experience to gold conversion wasn't added until later in the game? Is it really in classic? I'm not 60 yet so I wouldn't know
---
Now that the OP is married he will light off one of those fireworks every time his wife does the deed. Those should last him at least till the release of Classic MoP
---
I feel like instead of people reserving loot they spam for you to pay to be in the stream group
---
Sounds great, I’ll check that out. Thanks for the tips.
---
Why hide his name? Shame this greedy fuck.
---
Looking for group channel 4.  You can spam in the city but the result is both you and the people you find there will be in a city and not anywhere close to BRD (at least if you're horde side that's the case).  It will of course depend on the time of day and the server population you are spamming (I'm on Whitemane so most of the time there's people on).  Basically spam city if its low population hours/times if its busy I'd get close to improve your time starting the run. But always LFG channel is your friend.
---
Yeah, it's a shen'drelar blue trinket. Gives 10 fire res and an equip bonus.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18469/royal-seal-of-eldrethalas#see-also
---
Yeah in pugs everyone should be rolling need on valuable items.  Or all greed, but everyone should get a chance at them. Your class being able to use Edgemasters or having a progression should not give you priority over hundreds of gold in a pug.
---
These cringey comments my god lol. Literally a rogue stereotype
---
225g on my server.
---
Why would you want a mount you cant even see?
---
thrall, voljin  and saurfang are vendors ? mmk
---
wtf are you saying ? it was already like that in vanilla, they're just respecting Nochanges that everyone cried about for months
---
I have done 4 mc runs and I haven't been hit once as a dps war so not concrete evidence.
---
I agree it doesn't do much but I think it does impact them for that session at least. I know I won't join any run where someone is being called out for changing loot priority.
---
Over the long run though ya it doesn't do much. I don't usually bother after the initial incident.
---
 Shouldnt be a surprise to anyone really.
---
Ive been doing these in groups of 4 because i (the warrior) always die because the last boss deals so much damage, how do u deal with the ads at the end?
---
lmao booty balif?
---
60G on Skeram Horde.
---
Because Herod is still layered.
---
Even if that happened you could just use Eyes of the Beast and move your pet to the assigned Living Bomb spot. It takes 10 seconds to blow up, so with the 2 second cast and maybe an extra second for reaction time, you would have 7 full seconds to move your pet from Baron Geddon to the bomb spot.
---
Controlling AH prices for various important items through alliance-horde friendships.
---
🔥
---
I'm with you. Although I'd like not many changes with core gameplay, I have nothing against someone else wasting their gold on a hair restyle. I say wasting because I know from experience and dropping millions on stupid neon hair in uo lol
---
Dungeon items are oversaturated. Low level crafting mats that have no value in high level crafts are oversaturated. So it is just normal. Stuff you have a limited supply off that is needed a lot is where the money is.
---
 #NOCHANGES
---
Wierd my experience has been completely the opposite -- Usually tank just pulls the mobs then DPS either kill it super fast or super slow. Slow stuff  is more of a threat. If the group can kill stuff faster then tank can pull more and we can go overall faster. It's felt like the group was on mine as well as my fellow DPS's shoulders.

Cut half the servers from classic and allow free transfers.
---
Create classic + while keeping classic as classic.
---
Start over with classic + and create a poll system that allows the players to vote on content that comes into classic + that way they don't fuck the game up again.
---
Lololol laughed so hard.  Played a rogue in actual classic and I all I remember is that if the warlock didn’t die I’m stuck lock, i was dead.
---
People would explicitly say "just roll need on BoE's, everyone can use gold". Honestly that's the most fair
---
Cant watch the video right now, but judging from other comments is this saying that I can queue HS, wait for my OH to swing and then cancel before MH swing to ensure it always hits?
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
If the lag wouldn't exist, this looks like it would be epic in many ways.
---
I can see the overall pulled back perspective that it’s more baseline “fair” and reduces RNG (although doesnit really? Now it’s roll RNG instead of item type drop RNG, same dif?) - actually technically the most “fair” would be for one person to take each item and then pay out the rest of the group 1/5 of that item’s gold value each...but of course that’d be cumbersome.
---
IMO there’s a reason the game drops loot and not just gold stacks...boiling everything down to its gold value takes away from a lot of the fun and immersion of actually playing in the first place.
---
It’s quite a different experience having a boss drop a sick helm you need to complete a set or sword that will raise your dps than it is for the boss to just drop some gold stacks and you go shopping for whatever you want later.
---
If you pass up the opportunity to gank a warrior farming elementals for his whirlwind axe, you need to pull the giant Staff of Uptightness out of your zugzug hole.
---
The name might be a reference to ”The Lassiter” in the tv show Firefly. It’s the first ever laser pistol, and is considered an antique.
---
Lol ok like the top dps in game is warrior by far the mages and rogues.
---
M favourite WoW memory was in a heroic dungeon in Pandaria when I realised when in a group of competent players that I actually was nowhere near as good as I thought. It led to me raiding and improving as a player, it was a classic "what?!" moment
---
Ok cool thanks!
---
I didn't know that. I can though. I guess it's my addons and its not in the game.
---
I disagree. Getting 8/8 of the dungeon 1 set and then actually completing the quest is a massive time commitment. If you can commit to getting it, then you can raid.
---
I only had 4/8 Wildheart on my Druid by the time I had all of my "pre-raid BiS" gear. You need the full set to be able to complete the quest to upgrade to dungeon 2.
---
I'm not saying you should wait until everyone greeds and then need and ask them why they didn't need....
---
Jesus you are so angry at nothing
---
yeah dae hate mages simplistic rotation lmfao. Meanwhile literally every other class is a 1-3 button rotation.
---
At least mages have to think about positioning and melee leeway during AOE (when they inevitablly pull aggro)
---
Is the Lich King gay now?
---
&gt; there's no reason to assume the default behavior is 
---
You have overstated your case here. Don't get me wrong I agree that everyone needing on valuable BOE's is probably the best approach we can take as a community. However, there is *clearly* a reason to think that the default behavior is to need stuff you need for use and greed stuff you want for greed. It's literally \*in the name of the roll selection\*.
---
Just to be clear - I agree we should just start needing on valuable BOE's. But it's disingenuous, absurd even, to claim that there is "no reason" to think people will default to the system blizzard provided us and use it according to the names \*given by the game designers for this exact purpose\*. It is clearly an understandable 'mistake' for people to hit greed when they want things for greed reasons.
---
Why would they its useless lol
---
Scenery pretty much sucks. And this group of bandits has taken over the mine. Safe travels.
---
Thank you for your help.  I will now use that knowledge to train the worst skills in the game to subpar pets because they look funny (I'll still bring a wolf to raid if I ever make it to 60).
---
So after reading all these comments ... I should respec ... and never log out again ... sounds like a plan!
---
It *might* be less clicks to upload an img from mobile
---
Fr, if this happened to me i'd be like ah well, on to the next mob. no biggie. Everyone here talkin about unblurring his name so they can blacklist him and posting it to forms is just, idk. I guess I feel like people just need to learn to chill out sometimes.
---
Does right click work?
---
Facts &gt; feelings, sorry bud, time to grow up.
---
Then they soulstone res and sit on you?
---
Thank you
---
Your welcome :)
---
Wetlands run is the best
---
It's not one of the most imbalanced.  Majority horde, but still plenty of alliance.  More low level horde than anything.
---
Sounds like it's time to build a 1 hand, melee crit priest build to fully test this out
---
It's just weird to me that you want these items that would render many items obsolete to be added this soon. I get that some content isn't relevant yet but many of us aren't even 60 yet. I want to walk down the same road everyone else did because I never played during classic.
---
In an ideal situation, sure. Most the time the rogue is opens up on you or gap closes with sprint and blind. I think scorpid sting is safer for whatever may happen in the fight.  Serpent sting only after they are running away
---
Disc priests are friggin' unkillable most of the time! Considering going disc/holy and level in dungeons.
---
Won’t even blow off 2g on his wife - classy dude!
---
I don't think that's true.  30x more players in a server certainly isn't a problem across the board.  There are several servers that never had layers.  You chose poorly is my point.  Many people were given a second chance to choose again and still mad a poor decision.  No room to complain.
---
If the DPS can just kill things fast, then sure, but that’s more a benefit of strong DPS, and less about wether or not the group wipes
---
It's not and it doesn't look stupid.
---
If I win this ticket, I will not use it, and it will go to waste.
---
TIL nexus crystals aren’t out yet, thanks friend.
---
Why do ppl insist on making Reddit threads about individual streamers lmao just go to their subreddit or something
---
Another move you can make is to say, kick this mage or I'm leaving group, 9 times out of 10 they will kick the dps. This is a better move imo because you are only punishing the person who is out of line, and not betraying the rest of your group who could very well be good people.
---
Then find a nice/friendly/better one?
---
Yeah every race of rogue is strong against a particular class it seems...except trolls..they're kinda screwed vs all classes.
---
Yeah lol already happened with 2 finkles, leather shoulders and thunderstrike have been disenchanted not even chance to roll in my guild.
---
are you ever NOT logged in though.
---
First time our Guild killed Rag.... 15 years ago! Memories!
---
I use Vanoskos. I've only added 4 people so far, but it's good knowing that ill never have to group with them ever again.
---
Hunter: Leaves game for IRL hitching. 
---
Game: Sends him loot anyway.
---
If memory serves, it is superior to maul provided you have the crit talent(and who doesn't?) refunding you rage, and have three targets. You'll use both, obviously, but in rage for aggro, swipe can perform extremely well.   
---
Plus, on larger pulls, maul alone won't burn rage fast enough.
---
&gt;essence of water
---
then you are gonna end up locked out faster,if you are doing it more than 2 man you are doing it wrong
---
eventually as in 8/8 tier 1, which could take months. Just saying I wouldn't farm for it on a hunter but if it dropped I'd be rolling.
---
For real. No way I’m taking the gold in this deal.
---
You must be new to Vanilla lol.
---
If you type /roll it will automatically roll 1-100.
---
If you type /roll 101-101 it will roll with the possibilities between 101 and 101 with the 100% outcome of obviously, 101.
---
E.G. /Roll 1-10 will be 1 to 10 instead of the regular 1-100
---
1. My favourite class is Prob Druid followed closely by Hunter
---
2. Easiest for me was Hunter followed by Druid/Warlock.
---
3. the mobs i've grinded from 32 to 40 have specifically been chosen just because the low traffic of the opposite faction and before then i barely spent any time in contested zones. Wich have heavily skewed my PvP to be ganked by 2 or 3 different ?? who decided to play around in redridge and Duskwood. So i can't really comment on that much but Warlock have prob been the easiest when fighting 1v1 with any +-5 levels of me.
---
You can do /roll number-number and it will roll that value
---
Yup, and if you feel bad, just give it to the guy who had the highest greed roll.
---
I've done it a whole ton, never gotten locked out.
---
I'm not a Warrior or a Shaman so 2-manning it won't work as well.

I used a program called "snipping tool" on Windows by default. I think they recently started phasing it out

You're fit to learn the meaning of the beatdown, madness, chaos in the brain.

This explained my circumstance exactly, except the levels haha, 
---
Made a warrior to start with old buddies, they all slowed down or stopped end of 20s, i rerolled with some other friends on another server, now my lock is 49, slowly lvling my warrior cause i find arms tanking real fun, but i wish my group of friends had stayed, so my warrior could be main and i could SLAP in p3 with bgs. But here we go leveling mount farmers.  
---
I NEED swift zulian tiger this time around.
---
they ignore imps 100% untill boss die
---
I can see your point - I should have congratulated him/participated in his excitement. A rare drop, with an even rarer circumstance (basically calling the drop) - doesn't happen often.  
---
That being said, it's your prerogative if you want to perceive it so negatively (I hope OP didn't, as it wasn't my intention) - my intent was to be helpful. Out of the all responses to this post, yours was the only negative one (definitely the only one to call me "mentally ill" and "visually 'impared'"). Most others are "TIL" and "thanks".  
---
To go off on the offensive immediately like that though? Yikes, dude.
---
wow, never seen such a thing, after playing pservers for years and original vanilla
---
Yeah hufe waste to disenchant atm, mine as well wait or let people use them for memes
---
Nomorechanges
---
It really depends, it could be anywhere between 15g-30g+
---
Obviously the higher level you are, the chance for mobs to resist your pick pocket decreases. I started farming when I was 57, I took a break from farming to ding 58 and I've already noticed a pretty drastic difference in the amount of resists. 
---
I also kill 3 of the fire elementals that are patrolling in the beginning which have chances to drop things like essence of fire and elemental fire which sell nice on the AH.
---
There are little things that I could do to increase efficiency and get more gold/hr, like minor speed increase to boots, invisiblity cloak, speed pots, etc. but I've been averaging around 80g-120g a day so it's been fine enough for me. 
---
Epic mount before 60 here I come!
---
True, that books running 200g on my server right now and that trinket is great if RNG keeps passing you by with the jed trinket
---
I was a Rogue and The Butcher dropped in SM... a Warlock needed on it and won... I quit the game.
---
Makes you a good guildie
---
You need to leave bear at some point. By that time I have 5 combo points on you and if I have thistle tea available then you are dead before kidney shot ends.
---
Yes, I also take positive notes on people I party with cause I have shitty memory for names
---
Interesting...seems like that happens a lot in pve too.
---
Why blur names of ninja looters? Make sure to get that ass on the global  blacklist.

You “spent many hours” tweaking your character... and you chose an Undead Male with long hair and a bald spot?
---
That’s completely on you dude. Just because you lack foresight doesn’t mean Blizzard should change the game that everyone flocked to for the sole reason that it emulates vanilla WoW.
---
But don’t worry, rumor has it Blizzard will be doing a trilogy, so if they repeat WOTLK you’ll get to change your appearance in a mere 4-5 years!
---
Listening to the Old man that narrates each starting zone's intro cinematic talk about the race lore. I have always wondered want the face of that man would be.
---
Sapper charge, warrior just finishes the boss and then we clean up the adds. Fire nova totem is a little unreliable but you can get kinda lucky on placement and it makes it super easy.
---
&gt;For me, the effectiveness of downranking with higher +healing outweighs heavily the benefit mp5 gear gives you.
---
Agree with this 100%. I have 600+ healing spellpower at the moment and with how short fights in MC and dungeons generally are, the increase in throughput and ability to downrank far outweights mp5-stacking. I'm starting to get more and more mp5 as I have gotten a bunch raid pieces (Salamander Scale Pants, Earthfury Helmet and Malistar's Defender) but my focus is still to stack hsp.   
---
I feel that the ability to push extremely high HPS when needed is really important to avoid wipes and unnecessary deaths, while also being able to be mana effective by using rank 4/5 HW and rank 1 chain heal when damage is low.
---
You can definitely get white miss chance below 19%, it's just not really worth doing because you're only getting about half value from additional hit so might as well pick gear with more agi or crit instead. As for talent points, I don't know if there are better options to invest points into, you're looking for something that adds more than 0.5% dps per point.
---
Actually yes, been renovating my room over the weekend and just today i've managed to get sick so it was a mixed moment of finally dinging 40 on the last charater(the druid) and learning that yes it's possible to also puke through your nose.. :(
---
.......But how much gold?
---
So I'll address this in two parts:
---
1) The hit cap, even prior to patch 1.8, was still 9% if you had a weapon skill of 304 or less. This is because, even though the miss chance is 8%, enemies would ignore your first percent of hit. Meaning, if you had 8% hit on your gear and talents, you would still miss 1% of the time. You needed that 9% in order to ensure that you would never miss. This is true for yellow attacks for all classes and for white attacks for 2H.
---
2) It is not clear exactly if there is a hard-hit cap, and in fact it is more likely that there is not. The reason for this is that while patch 1.8 did remove the hard hit cap, it also changed weapon damage normalization. That is, instant attacks became not tied to the weapon speed of the weapon, but instead to the weapon type (1h non-dagger was 2.4, hunter ranged weapon was 2.8, dagger was 1.7, and 2h was 3.3). We know this is how weapons currently work, so while the patch is officially 1.12, we know there are things from later patches that are currently in effect now. So, if they have already introduced weapon normalization, there is no reason to assume that they didn't also implement other 1.8 damage changes, such as the removed hard-hit cap for dual-wield. Otherwise, you would be partly correct, that there would be a hard cap miss chance of 19%, but in that scenario, you'd still wan't 9% hit rating because of what I mentioned above about mobs ignoring the first percent of hit.
---
B-b-but pservers!
---
People fail to realize that you don’t get kind gestures like this unless you’re very active in your guild. Showing up for raids and dungeons and being silent the whole time puts you the corner metaphorically
---
yea my first steps out of menethil harbor was a skull level croc almost like it was preparing me for the journey

And yet here you are...
---
You can queue crafting and it'll tell you to swap to other characters to mail any items they have in their inventory. It also says, for example, that you can craft 1-5 of an item meaning your current character can craft 1 but across all characters you have the mats to craft 5.
---
Well they are completely garbage and a waste of time and money other then the visual spectecal.
---
well that's not very nice of the bandits, but i guess that's why they're bandits

How many total hours is that???

Holy paladin here. I went into holy at L47 so I understand how frustrating it can be... My solution was finding a guild with people who wanted to run ST or Mara. Once I hit 53 I was able to join BRD Anger/Arena runs (but just like you I still had a tough time finding groups). When I couldn’t find anything I just used my free time to farm herbs and make pots. Join an active guild and ask for help, that’s prob your best option if you don’t want to respec.

Which addon? I have tried looking for addons to see enemy buffs, but from what i know, you can only see buffs if your addon can take the information from the combat log. If you were to see any buff, like the mage ability "detect magic" Works, it would nullify the ability. So if you actually have an addon that works like that, I am quite interested in knowing the name of it

Congrats! Although not sure what’s the bandage is for won’t need to wrap up no more :P
---
I want a gnome mage but I'm troll. I loved the leper gnome costume. Being tiny with huge 10 yard range aoe spam feels good
---
I had a mid life crisis in my lvl 30s. I stopped playing the careful sword and board tank, and now I just go full 2h dps, and as a result, I enjoy tanking with people who can't attack skull or wait until I establish SOME threat to dps. Now, instead of throwing a taunt out at any stray mobs, I just try to burst them down to either get threat back, or kill them before they're a problem. I'm more likely to throw sunders instead of taunt, which I'll only use as last resort.
---
***multiple alts, 1 per
---
This is why I miss that need rolling binds gear to you
---
The circle continues. 
---
Everyone knows the risks of pvp when joining a pvp server. I don’t go onto an RP server and complain when they try and RP @ me.
---
As others have already answered, blink. You don't need it vs Hunter other than getting into deadzone, once you're there, they only have Scatter/Intim depending on spec, which you can (and should) block.
---
That's good. When I tried kiting he once evaded/reset while still disoriented from my scatter, that's when i decided to cheese him instead.
---
Are they though? Last time I checked they were using AWS to boost launches (which, obviously, might just be to help out on launch load), and I feel like a company like blizzard that is so financially invested must have already went over the tipping point of companies where they are "trying to cut expenses".
---
(Also, I've checked their DDoS security company back in the days, it's completely outsourced and atleast in europe it's done by some small-ish italian tech-company that I have never ever heard of)
---
Man its every sub i dont get it
---
there's a twink dagger that drops there, along with a dozen or so worthless BoE's. Twinking won't exist until BGs exist so the market is currently flooded with these items as a lot of people are stashing them in their banks or buying them up cheap. If you're both level 40 you can probably cruise through it, however the reward split 2 ways isn't worth the time, Grind to 60 and you can farm \~40g/hour with either class
---
265 will get you most gnomish stuff
---
True af. Hi from Denver
---
a 400$/month rented server from 2015\*
---
You make a lot of assumptions.
---
This is why everyone should need on highly valuable boe’s.  If you don’t this will continue to happen to you.
---
You're literally sitting right at the computer.  You just type in reddit.com.  It is way easier if you aren't tech illiterate.
---
With my RL's graces, and because he actually wanted people to show up on time, I'd head to the raid early, and then log off/do bank alt stuff til just a few minutes before raid time. I'm there on-time, I don't have to summon anyone or lose my shards, and I get to check the AH. win win win.
---
I suggest you do the same!
---
if you're going too slow for a mage, either they're not doing damage most pulls or you're going way too slow. in any group, the mage is the one i have to wait on mana for every pull.
---
Generally, yes. The items will either say "Bind on Equip" or "Bind on Pick-up".  If an item is bound to you it cannot be traded.
---
this is helpful i am sure im dumb and im just not looking. was looking up old codex's thinking maybe it was a book i have to click on..but this seems much much more plausible ill check tonight. Thanks guys
---
The first reply got it right
---
Or a felhunter
---
Gonna be honest, it fucking sucks. Theres nothing in the auction house and its hard to fill out groups even playing as a tank. There were 400 total horde online during peak hours yesterday. Nearly impossible to run a dungeon during offpeak hours. I wish i could transfer back to high pop.
---
The only bonus was easier leveling. But once you hit 60 you'll regret it.
---
I just got Flurry Axe today on my undead warrior but I’m not sure if I should use it or not. Currently lvl 46. 
---
As can be seen on the race choice I am by no means a min/max kinda guy. I just don’t want to equip it and then get a tanking/fury upgrade in a few levels. 
---
What do you guys think?
---
If I leave classic, it sure as hell won't be for retail.
---
On one hand, I don't care. It's a make believe item in a game. On the other hand, I also stop healing him, let him due and then leave. 
---
I also add those people to the blacklist addon.
---
You get the ability to make a cooking fire when you train cooking.
---
Transferring full accounts for a one time transfer would avoid that.
---
Also, gold and materials matter significantly less since all profession materials are obsolete once TBC hits.  Gold is also devalued substantially.
---
I like the charging gold for summons with a cut to the warlock. That's a nice way of incentivizing good behavior-- as long as it's more gold than they'd pay to fly there.
---
they had more in a single phase
---
I like sharex. One click to screenshot and it automatically uploads to imgur and puts the url in my clipboard.
---
Well walmart and target sell barbie dolls, they're probably like 10 bucks. Maybe grab yourself one of those to dress up however you'd like since it is literally the same thing.
---
You can personally make a fire anywhere... you just need the materials.

This is the real question I can’t believe hasn’t been asked and answered yet!
---
&gt; just give the mage the 500g mage item
---
Is this sarcasm? I could use that 500g to buy MY OWN bis. When something like that drops, it's an upgrade for EVERYBODY, not just the mage.
---
Who needs print screen button anyway
---
"Yo stop running by me on your mount and not giving motw."
---
It’s NOT worth exactly the same to everyone. One is literally just for gold, if you need roll my BOE BiS you’re a shitlord. Thanks for letting me know to clarify greed rolls only for my runs to avoid dick heads that do this
---
&gt; We know this is how weapons currently work, so while the patch is officially 1.12, we know there are things from later patches that are currently in effect now. 
---
Wait, WHAT? Weapon instant damage is normalized in classic WoW? Really? How do you know this to be true, I thought we were #nochanges?
---
Assuming then that the hard hit cap IS in place, you wouldn't want more than 9% hit with 300 WS or alternatively, 6% hit with 305 WS?
---
damn you're dumb
---
Congratulations man!!
---
I got mine last Friday.  I am a raid leader / GM, so a bunch of people were cheering for me.  But I didn’t have an offhand!!! I felt pretty embarrassed.
---
When I went to equip mine, I realized I had been wearing Carrot on a Stick for the entire raid up until Golemagg. LOL
---
Grats again dude!
---
They aren’t randoms.  They’re people on your server who know your name.  
---
That’s the difference between retail and classic
---
No, there are limited resources because spawn rates for most valuable things aren't related to population.
---
Of course it is possible to make your own fire with flint and tinder and a piece of simple wood... I only wish the spirit bonus was something significant to actually make it worthwhile to use while grinding.
---
No but if the guy who needs it was gonna sell it anyway the guy who wants it could buy it off him. Maybe even get it cheaper than on ah since it's right there.
---
If you cant level a class (one of the most fun ones nonetheless, hunter) to 60, you wont be able to succeed in any way with other classes. Thats just the way it is, youll get bored.
---
I could add that ah price seems to be 350g which is a nice contribution towards the mount
---
Your not looking forward to playing WoW. That's why when you log on your no interested. You surround yourself with people who are interested and your mistaken their interest for yours. Play a new game. Your bored of WoW.
---
Looks really cool! Enjoy the game however you want, don't listen to the min-max trolls
---
Very well stated.
---
Rumors I heard were that a remake of TBC and WotLK (to comprise basically the "original trilogy") were in the cards, but I have no source for that.
---
If they are humanoid, MC one making it friendly. Break the MC when it is most inconvenient for the mage.

"Haha, look at this trout I caught!"

Those names....

Awesome I subscribed to your YouTube I’ll keep a eye out for that video!
---
Currently my rouge is fully decked pre-Raid BiS sword spec. With the only thing left Dal Rend MH and HoJ. I have a few nightslayer pieces but nothing crazy. I’ve been bouncing the idea around of trying daggers but I crush it in Dungeons and even raids.
---
Whenever stuff like that happens on my tank or healer I just say "if you don't stop I'm leaving".
---
I feel like a warning makes it fair.
---
Get ready to drink a lot
---
Why’d I get downvoted I wanted to know why too😢
---
Wow....lol...I mean I've come across some bad posts but this one I'm not even sure....is it trolling or this guy actually isn't aware that he can make a fire?
---
Ohhhhh then its a terrain exploit. Report him lol

Had it’s fucking name spray painted on it and everything.

I spent my 18th birthday attending my very first Onyxia raid where 39 people sang me happy birthday on vent. Was pretty overwhelming :)
---
Nah man, this is an MMO at it's best.  Loads of competition and people everywhere.
---
Competition doesn't mean easy, it means when you win it feels great.  
---
When you *do* get that heavily contested mat, it's worth much more.  People value their time at a certain g/hour - if prices of goods are making them not worth competing over then you need to figure out what more efficient thing the competition is doing, or move to a market where people aren't depressing value.
---
I completely disagree as someone who played a druid from vanilla to wotlk and got very serious about arena. In terms of PvP the pet management is a big deal since people can abuse your pet. Good hunters will have their pet dodge frostnovas, AoE fears, taunts which is already more brain power than hot and dot, root and kite. On top of that look at hunters who speed run tribute and the pet and threat management going on. Not to mention their optimal raid rotation is about weaving in melee, managing pet focus(bite and claw), as well as managing pet location. I think people who think druid is hard haven't actually played it. Druid have a big kit bit its very cut and dry.
---
He doesn't know
---
Small seafourium charges don’t work in chests last i checked. Tried several times to no avail
---
Something that takes 200 hours (in a game where people spend thousands of hours in) is 90% of the content? Good thinking bro. I'm talking strictly about questing/leveling, not the fact that you have to be in zones...
---
nO cHeNgEs reeeeeeeeeeerrrr!!!1111
---
I didn't quite do this, but something close enough. I have one "main" so far, sitting in the mid 50s. Right around 45 I started to realize I felt obligated (not literally, but by choice or seemingly in practice) to have to grind a lot for what I was aiming for. The grind started to feel at times unfun, especially whenever I hit a zone with barely any quests / kill x quests and that's it. Thus far I've largely avoided bad dungeon groups and have really enjoyed it, though my choice dungeons seem to mostly be the less popular ones.
---
So somewhere during the grind I decided to try out an alt as I definitely saw friends doing it. Thus far I ended up with 4 different alts, all roughly around the same level (a bit under 20 at the moment). What makes this all enjoyable for now is a host of things:
---
1. Variation in starting zones in both quests and themes, only funneling towards the same areas later on in the leveling process.
---
2. Gold farmed from my main let's me bypass a lot of grind. On my main I did a lot of even tedious quests just because to experience them at all and to get gold that way. Since my main can thus far earn gold much faster than any alt I can just funnel as needed (usually a fraction of what I'm making anyways) to reduce downtime and penny-pinching.
---
3. Not playing alts all the time means they get nice cycles of rested xp, which also cuts down on grind compared to a main that rarely had rested xp for long.
---
4. Just about every alt has a different mix of professions, allowing me to view the land with a different perspective (particularly with herbalism and mining). Previous places I didn't think as much of became more interesting as spots I like to harvest resources from.
---
5. I rarely get completely useless gear. Whenever something drops I can usually use it on someone, or otherwise shard it to build up enchanting on a specific alt.
---
6. I was surprised and impressed by the class identity and distinctness. For instances I assume mages and warlocks would be similar as casters but IMO they kind of aren't, they have distinct strengths and weaknesses and tools available or not. Similar with warrior vs rogue.
---
7. I'm thus far taking all my alts less seriously and mostly as experiments, with no idea if I'll raid on any of them and bypassing whatever quests I deem too tedious / unrewarding. I tend to only pick up the quests I like or can do efficiently, and if I keep the alts all around the same level I can knock out the same quests on various ones easily from memory, or if that seems tedious I can just go level in a different zone on a different alt or even jump back to my main. I think a lot of zones I only got a better feel for when I was already out of them or coming from a different perspective at it later.

Booo what a bore you are

ok but thats not "BUGS EVERYWHERE", the vanish stuff is pretty bad tbh.

also, maybe its not a bug?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dof6su/vanish\_and\_cheap\_shot\_are\_both\_broken\_in\_classic/f5nyquz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dof6su/vanish_and_cheap_shot_are_both_broken_in_classic/f5nyquz/)

Same on firemaw whenever more than 80 people clash.

Death coil doesn’t count as a fear. Also there is the succubus seduction

He was the only one who rolled need.

Sorry, thats a dick move and he knows what he did.

Found the Shaman with a Hunter alt guys.

Well, and the gold

I ran Live Strat with a group of friends back in the day, on Baronedd the Tank was MCd and the rest of the party wiped - she still had our tank MCd and when she reset, our tank (still Mind-controlled) ran back alongside her :)
---
Sounds like a "I want it now" mentality tbh
---
Just because they didn't have layers doesn't mean that classic is designed around that many players. Again, youre missing the point. But I dont see a need anymore to argue with someone who's so willing to brownnose blizzard that he's completely disregarding every mistake they made
---
I know, right?
---
Just accept that people will roll need for AH spec, and roll need yourself
---
Ugh I hate this self validating posts
---
1. How do you figure that removing DW penalty from OH white hits (-19% miss) is a 19% buff to OH white damage? Lol. It depends entirely on your other stats—crit, OH speed/dmg/dps, etc. 
---
2. You cannot distinguish MH from OH swings in combat logs. Perhaps the 1/3 factor you mention applies for some particular MH/OH combination, but it certainly won’t hold true for all of them. 
---
3. It’s much, much bigger than you say it is. It changes the way fury warriors build. It doesn’t sound like you understand this, or that you’re one of the players still droning on about crit cap.
---
That escalated quickly.
---
Honest question, for items like this, wouldn't a guild reserve it or do loot council? If it's a pug I understand free roll, but what about a guild only run?
---
Also we get to walk on water

Couldn't bear going through the horse levelling zones, and alliance cities and music was just too good to pass up. Happy to be on alliance killing goofy ass trolls with their goofy ass names along with killing undead rogues on sight
---
Not easier if you dont know your password to reddit!
---
You'd be smart to buy them out then.
---
While people pulling ahead of me can be annoying, I will generally tolerate it until it actually threatens to wipe the group. 
---
Tanks are often as the de-facto leader in 5 mans and I generally try to rise to the occasion by doing what I can to make the group work so as not to waste everyone's time. When it comes to toxic players, I try to be resilient instead of being utterly intolerant.
---
As a tank i couldnt care less about losing aggro to dps. I'll try to hold aggro from as many mobs as possible of course but if i lose aggro from one or 2 who cares. The one who should care the most and speak out if they dont feel like its working is the healer.
---
Yeah except raid BOPs apparently.
---
They are full of shit.
---
The Gnomish ones won't blow up is why
---
“Heh, it could theoretically be worse so your complaints about the game are instantly refuted!”
---
You’ll get downvoted to hell because it’s exactly your sentiment that got us into this mess.
---
Are those pieces any good, anyway? Don't they have a bunch of strength that does nothing for a hunter?
---
That's a good analogy. I like it. But in this case it's more like a 50 year old viking killing a toddler.
---
Because the balance of the 50g or whatever the vendor price is doesnt equal the usefulness of giving it to someone who can use it.
---
600g directly translates to another item, or even multiple smaller upgrades. 
---
Besides. Boes can be bought at anytime. If you really need a boe then buy it. By needing it away from the rest of the group you're basically saying you don't want to spend xxx gold but you'll gladly take xxx gold from everyone else.
---
Basically valuable boes are sacks of gold for the group to have equal chance to win. It's not fair that you get dibs on the gold because you can use the piece. If you really needed the piece you could have bought it at anytime. If you needed money to buy it then needing on it is basically needing the money to buy it and everyone needs money.
---
Ok, I guess we’re just disagreeing on what was meant by CC. 
---
Earthbind and frost shock are slows. Technically, I think slows are considered CC. So, by that definition, you’re correct. 
---
However, I think it’s pretty clear that this discussion was around “hard” CC that causes players to fully lose control of their toon (e.g. poly, fear, etc.). By that definition, shaman have none.
---
Correct. WotF won't break mortal coil either. What is your point?
---
Mash the gash 2016
---
I think the point of this thread completely went over your head dude.
---
 It's about respect.. 39 other people are waiting on you to show up for raid, and you feel entitled enough to say "nah I got better things to do until raid time than traveling to the raid , just summon me at raid time."
---
Been watching your videos since release Boochie, keep up the good work. Eagerly awaiting your guide to onyxia tanking with GBoK 😂
---
Warlocks can solo the Mara princess where Mages/Priests cannot.
---
You can dominate demons, so any area with tons of them is good for you.  
---
Eye of Killrog is great for pulling large quantities of enemies.  
---
Succy CC doesn't cause fear (priests) and doesn't heal your enemy (mages)
---
Doing the same shit over and over isn't content it's just repetition, the actual levelling is the majority of the content in wow
---
We can both sell the item for the same amount of gold. Therefore it's worth the same to both of us.
---
How is it worth more to you? 
---
If we both wanted to buy it, we'd pay the same price on the AH. If we want to sell it, we'd get the same amount for it.
---
I'm not sure there's any more ways to explain it 😂

---
It's ninja'ing because he waited to be the only 1 rolling need, needed it, then said "deal with it" to the rest of the group. The non-ninja thought process is that everyone always rolls need together, so everyone has an equal chance at the loot. If you want to agree together that a particular group member deserves the item, just trade it to them.
---
Behaved? Edgemasters are AH main spec over warrior in a pug. Everyone should need on those especially in case someone isn't in on "behaving". BoEs like that are a ridiculous luxury.
---
Well I'll put it this way: I've never heard a great tank complain of DPS pulling.  I always hear of new/uncomfortable tanks complain of DPS pulling.  
---
Mages should be complaining to you because they haven't got the change to sit and drink between pulls bro.
---
Healing for the first time with a serious guild in ulduar in WOTLK, every other time I did a raid was a pug. My friend got me in this guild and we tagged along in their raid. I was 12 years old and got so much credit for doing a great job healing. I was the guilds best healer during that whole expansion and made a lot of friends.
---
Yup, nerds with anger issues but no conflict resolution skills

Yeah man, this thread went about how I expected it to go.. half the people agreeing with me and the other half pulling up any argument they can to justify being lazy shitheels.

Sorry that doesn’t make sense, private servers typically host a single server not multiple of 10. If the argument we’re having is dedicated hosts per server vs multi tenant servers then, “well private servers do it” isn’t a valid input as it is a dedicated host which is exactly what is being argued for
---
I played druid and hunter all through tbc and wotlk hunter isnt hard. Druid is more difficult
---
I did this horde side, and i wanted to play shaman anyways
---
Kind of nice seeing the other side but now i want to see what ally side is like pre-cata but fuuuuuck leveling again
---
really? where can i find out more about them?
---
I like warrior simply because of the aesthetic.  Nothing like beating down a big bad monster with a sword and board.
---
You're probably right. Dolls probably would've been better for my mental health. The RNG for those Magister Boots is insanely low. Ended up revered with the Argent Dawn by the end of it. 
---
If I could just buy cool stuff like a Celestial Steed for my doll to ride out, it probably would've given me the same sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
Havnt seen the video. But if is saying that u need to use rupture and garrote. Then im def not gonna Waste My time and watch it lel
---
????? no dude he's saying Vanilla never had a problem like this, not Classic doesn't have this problem.
---
Go swords spec makes the game a whole lot bare able when leveling, but honestly if you wanna do damage go dagger spec, its your choice in the end. What do you see yourself using, swords or daggers, either way you’re gonna be doing a whole lotta damage
---
It's a shame you feel that way.

I dont think they use AWS for WoW mate. They probably have their very own datacentre. WoW has a huge user base.

Mt here. If you don’t have brigam yet you’ve no place taking onslaught. As others have said fury gets very few items from the first raiding tier while tanks get a replacement for pretty much every slot. Tanks should get band of accuria too so hit% isn’t too tough to sort out. You can keep wearing belt of might or brigam for a while.

I'm not aware of any threatmeter that actually works on Onyxia, for example.

On what server?

Pro tip: As a tank what I do is use my 2h charge&gt;zerker stance&gt;bersereker rage&gt;ww&gt;cleave&gt;bs/tc macro&gt;ss&gt;equip shield macro shield block.

Helped me keep aggro and go ham on AOE while leveling.
---
...but not everybody gets it, do they?
---
Either way it’s RNG - either RNG for what item drops for what class, or who wins a /roll.
---
There’s a reason items drop instead of stacks of gold.
---
I like all classes other than paladin cause they bore me. Since you’re burnt out on melee I’d suggest using a casting class like mage or warlock or even priest, it’s a huge change in gameplay and will feel a lot fresher. If you’re Horde side try out Shaman, they are a lot of fun.

there is one common demeanor in all these "you guys are awesome", free loot for nothing

If you played vanilla on any server except one of the few super servers like Tichondrius then by the modern definition you played on a "dead realm."

Look you might be right, I have no idea how they’ve implemented it! But in comparison to operations being performed every server side tick, this wouldn’t normally be something you dedicate time to get 100% (despite the trivial implementation). My comment was primarily in remark to the odds of a tie between the highest rollers! Curious how you came to 1/10000. Might be worth mentioning that I’m not the same person you originally responded to! Also not trying to start anything here more than discussion! :)

People have always been like this.   State your loot rules clearly at the beginning at the run or everyone needs all BoEs.    Two extremely simple solutions to this problem.

It's ridiculous how the Druid questline just drops after 20. All that build-up for each form just to say "Meh, here you go."
---
J think he meant classic has this plroblem and solution. And that in vanilla it did not happen, but tbh, we had bad pc back there. So a few more seco d of load times was dificult to notice
---
They're wrong. It's not about % hp you dmg the mob, its about the difference in level between the mob and players attacking it.
---
If a mob is gray to player X, and player Y tags the mob, but player X does some damage to it, player Y will receive diminished XP.
---
If the mob is green to player X, i.e. a level 49 elite and a level 60 mage, player Y will receive full XP based on the XP he/she would get from killing that level 49 mob solo.

Would be weird if computers could just take a screenshot of the screen.

am i the only one getting nice groups where every one rolls greed on stuff?

had 1 krol blade drop , i rolled greed first  3 others did the same , 1 warrior was in the group level 56 i think and "ASKED" if he could take it and we said sure  , he rolled alone and won

same thing happend with every BoE so far
---
If they really went all out with #nochanges i should atleast be able to duel in ironforge :(

You will waste a ton of time drinking and you will have the expenses of getting water before going on your adventure. You are also more likely to get ganked since you're not stealthed and will very likely take a dirt nap.
---
My argument wasn't about how much of an upgrade it is from the next best thing. It's that warriors will wear it for a very long time, possibly all through phase 4, while we replace it in MC.

And how do you know what they’re doing? Have you ever considered that they may be farming some materials to craft consumables for the raid? Maybe farming and vendoring for a little extra repair bill money? Sometimes people have some last minute preparations to take care of; nobody is perfect.
---
And if what you just said was the point of your post, yeah maybe you’re right. Maybe it did go over my head. Or maybe your point was so enshrouded in narcissism it was virtually imperceptible.
---
It is not about % hp to xp.

Bojack and Mr Peanut-butter in the same episode?’

The Yetis in Arathi are humanoids but also skinnable :) If you're that level range the yeti cave is a good place to grind a level.
---
Youre not forced to do anything. Scholo is the most efficient way to level 58-60. You can quest instead, but its slower, especially when others are farming your quest mobs. You can also just grind any random mob instead, but you refuse to do that because its not as fast as questing when the mobs aren't camped. 
---
So you have more efficient options you "won't be forced to do", and less efficient options you can't be bothered to do. You just want to complain that the one way you want to use to level isn't working well.
---
Wait that would mean I need to level a character to that quest and then just sit hmmmm
---
just keep doing quests! they start awarding gear for completion. You'll also be able to go into the Wailing Caverns dungeons in just a few levels, where you can gear drops off of bosses.
---
Look up what sort of gear you're going to be looking for as a warlock. I'm not totally familiar with the class, but pieces with spell damage/intellect are a pretty safe bet.
---
Look into joining a guild! Just ask around and you'll get invited to one pretty quickly. Guilds are great resources to ask questions or form groups for new players.
---
It's a farce that they're even willing to charge that much for a game that was created 15 years ago and requires zero changes or updates.
---
or you could not be a cynical dick
---
Do you really think "reputation" exists in this game?   It's never existed.   The biggest asshat in classic is it's most popular streamer with multiple guilds.
---
I love that it went full circle, also love that you were spinning the camera in circles ... but now I have motion sickness... thanks a lot.

Do you happen to make an excellent spaghetti also?

Are you sure that Italian tech company isn’t providing private racks and blizzard are just using their WAN links? 
---
Cloud works as an operational model because you can utilize utility based billing that can burst on demand. A game like wow has to be up 24/7 and as such the argument for an opex model is greatly reduced if not entirely eliminated. I doubt they would save any money at all from using a purely cloud based model. For bursting, sure, but BAU? No way
---
Ehhh, I love the rogue the most due to diverse toolkit. No other class has so many CD's for ample amount of situtations. Being able to CC 3 mobs naturally (Sap, Blind, Gouge), escaping with Vanish, Evasion, diverse dps specs (Hemo - Combat Swords - Combat Daggers -Seal Fate) that all play rather differently not a single other class comes even close to what a rogue has to offer.
---
What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
Phase 2 is coming before the new year.
---
It never was an issue on pservers which uses the vanilla client. Hence why it worked in vanilla. This is a client sided issue.
---
So you drop a trap everytime you stop moving?

Just so you know, you can paste it right to reddit.  Don't even need to use imgur.  
---
The snipping tool is excellent for this or just using alt+prnt scrn if you have multiple monitors.  Just hit ctrl+v on the reddit submit page and you're done.
---
Nooo, not at all. Literally just ask if anyone is doing it in barrens chat :p people are constantly always leveling
---
Firemaw
---
Leveling is literally the most repetitive shit in this game, what are you smoking? Go kill 10 boars bro, now go kill 6 ghosts, now 12 birds and give me their feathers. After you level once it's all repeating itself again.
---
Yeah I deff misinterpreted it. I'll leave my original comment up to receive the downvotes I deserve for snap judgement
---
I played a mage for 15 years.  The mage rotation is literally one button all the way until WotLK.
---
But it's not, he's not on the roof. He's just out of range of the guards.
---
But if the tank stands in one place how will mobs attack him from behind ? Obviously you don’t get how to play as a former Naxx-raiding, rank 14 Warrior.
---
Everyone saying about the screenshot. I got so excited about this I took a picture to send to my wife and friends then just uploaded that picture
---
ty for the tip!
---
I don't like reddit's host.
---
Is there any chance blizzard would restore an Item you vendored? Accidently vendored a trinket I can only get from a quest, and i can't buy it back.
---
Word is full. It’s fun
---
But raid loot can be traded now. And since everyone contributes to a kill, it's only fair that everyone gets to roll for every item that drops, and whoever can actually use it just has to pay the winner for the item right? 
---
Because no one is ever entitled to a legitimate upgrade unless they pay hard earned gold for it right?
---
I actually like it, feels like of Morrowindy. Yes that's a word now.
---
State the loot rules at the beginning of the run or people are entitled to roll need for any reason they see fit.  
---
&gt; Bring back vanilla culture where if you disrespect that principal you will be named and shamed,

This is a myth, it never existed.

Key ring is Phase 2. They did DireMaul early. It was originally P2.
---
I just hit lv 40 and got my mount, so lil light walleted atm but I could farm some goodies up or gold!
---
I honestly agree. It feels incredibly busted when I can go about my quests, and at all times, I have tabs on any alliance running around me. The ONLY reason I got this addon is because there's some rogues that really love to grief camp you and I just got tired of it so I installed it.  
---
I am honest to god a very passive player when it comes to my pvp server until me or my own get messed with and then gloves come off. But if I am greifed to the point of just getting rez sickness and logging for the night, I'll find a way to make it easier for me to find you and do the same.   
---
I don't remember nilla being this cut throat, but it sure seems like people have evolved a bit. I feel like I became a new person after STV.

We live in a society

Retail Character Notes works just fine, been using it for a few weeks now.
---
yes you were wrong one play piseeed you off and you had to leave everyone else sitting in the dust
---
Not really "bugged", but that's how it was in Vanilla.
---
Kodos were a last minute addition to the game so are missing a lot of features. They don't have a mount special (like horses neigh and rear up on 2 legs), they have no sounds as you pointed out, their riders have no animation and are just stuck in a static position, and they have issues fitting through most doorways.
---
Before kodos were added Tauren were supposed to be "too big" to have a mount. For their "mount" they instead got what was called at the time "plains running". 
---
Here is the Plains Running ability if you are curious to how it worked:
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Plainsrunning](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Plainsrunning)
---
Yeah its weird since patches aren't using the decimal system.  For WoW the first digit represents which expansion (or lack thereof) the game is on.
---
Taming Humar on my NE hunter during vanilla. I camped in that tree for so long shadowmelded.
---
Roll on pve server.
---
Wow. Really? This is basically counters regular dungeoning.
---
Honestly I think I am one of those very lucky people that just never runs into ninjas or any of those type of people in general in games. So this mentality just sounds unnecessary to me. I don't know if people are just being too worried about something that very rarely happens or if this an actual problem for a lot of people and I am just lucky to never come into contact with it?
---
every group I join i say “just let me pull and give me a few seconds to gather rage/aggro”. My group finally let me do my thing last night and i actually felt like a TANK for the first time in 42 levels.I play warrior and it blows my mind that you can say this mob after mob and people still just reign down the dps. Especially on large mobs were I truly need a few seconds to have that aggro control and rotation of my skills with consistent rage accumulating
---
I wouldn't personally just because of the increase in cost for it next time like at max level.
---
I genuinely don't know how a person would play a lock and NOT drain-tank before 60.
---
That's some deep stuff, man.. 🥺
---
I mean it's still possible. Warrior has such a high skill ceiling while lock skill ceiling is pretty low comparably.
---
Did you wipe from it? If yes, then leaving was a good choice. If not, then I would try and adjust to the to the group, if someone dies it’s on that mage.
---
Grats.
---
I've been in a guild like this but they died after dreanor.
---
Right now w ow is a means to free bnet cash snd that's all I'm doing
---
This. Nostalrius got super laggy when more than 8k people were online. By the time it hit 11/12k, there was like a 1.5 second delay on every single action.
---
Same with recent pservers like Light's Hope; even on those servers, when you had 100+ people in BRM, it got really laggy.
---
Warrior
---
i like the old Talent trees
---
i Like tanking
---
i like the fuckin old total op Execute
---
Because you're complaining how much it sucks. Leave and find a better one. Even if you do end up eventually leaving the server, maybe you find a better guild or it might change your mind on transferring.
---
Having said that, I remember when i played Vanilla the world PVP objectives were completely ignored.
---
My guild is like a school with social cliques where the raid leads and above are like the student council who act high and mighty compared to us plebian students.
---
Because that font is already hard to read, let alone looking at it pixelated to hell on some crappy photo taken by some crappy phone.
---
It's hard to say, it's kind of a personal thing that isn't like a generic value that you can follow. If you think you're dying to quickly, or are trying to 1v1 Stam is super nice and I'd rather have more of it compared to damage to an extent
---
Yeah, that reason is that Blizzard didn't fully understand what they were doing. In retail, if you need on a BoE, it becomes Soulbound so that you can't ninja loot to sell on the AH. But this is Classic and we have #nochanges.
---
Taking the literal definition of Need and Greed to justify a side is just dumb because it completely ignores the mechanics and game theory involved. If 3 people want to be nice and pass on a 500g BoE that someone needs, then the last guy can Need and now it's 50/50 whether the first guy gets his upgrade. Whereas if everyone needs, it's an 80% chance to get the upgrade as long as the winner is kind enough to trade the item to the person who actually needs it.
---
There was no one with a bad roll. The guy clicked need for a character that wasn’t in the group. So no a common courtesy rule was broken.
---
Sell the gold and buy a keyboard with a printscreen button.

https://www.wowhead.com/news=294748/classic-wow-server-queue-times-us-oc
---
No exactly the warlock is not wrong in my opinion. It was an upgrade and he worked towards it as well. In your scenario people could just greed everything and wait for later phases
---
I'll also vouch for NeatPlates. I mean, it's not amazing for ranged, as you'd literally won't be able to see it at a distance. But it does seem very accurate from my experience. :)
---
Nope. Best you could do is find someone in a similar position and agree to exchange services.
---
So what you're saying is your laugh was like 11/10?
---
The only good thing about pvp in combat spec is that I get to kill your pet too

wheres my penance at

&gt; they never lagged
---
As someone who played 4 years of vanilla servers, LOL
---
pservers lagged all the time and crashed multiple times per day
---
stop lying
---
Immersion still fits here. Your personal RP can still make room for being am adventurer looking for treasure. Boe are some of the best treasure around and coming back to town looking to sell your shiny new edge masters is amazing.
---
Variety is the goal. That why we even have boe.
---
I actually won a skullflame the other day, but 2 people greeded so I offered a reroll.  In hindsight I should have just offered for those two to roll and given it if they beat my need roll, but a guildie won it so it's fine.
---
It's like...on the one hand, "it's just a game" and if people want to be greedy/cutthroat and the game empowers them to do so, then so be it.  On the other hand, I'm not that guy.
---
Sad.
---
First time downing the lich king!
---
Did Cruel Barb finally drop?
---
I'm setting the O/U on how much gold OP received at 10g
---
Seriously little Gen Z shits named Aidan are old enough to raid (and read) now?
---
&gt;I did a boar.....
---
I uh..  I dont think you're on the right sub pal. . .
---
I shoulda done more research before rolling a lock instead of going in blind I guess lol
---
What are those books for?
---
Oh I agree with you completely. Just that unfortunately it's not going to make much difference. They'll find a replacement and people will ignore you saying anything against the current tank.
---
I'm not saying they should be allowed to be a dick.. just that they will. Thankfully what people like him don't realise is that the one place it's going to matter is raiding. You need 2-3 tanks for a raid and a couple OT's so all those tanks who treat people like shit get weeded out real fast.
---
Nobody needed it because they didn't need it. Neither did he. What's so difficult to grasp?
---
I respecced drain tanking around 42 - it made levelling an absolute breeze and I recommend it to anyone. Once you get the reduced knockback on drain life you can just spam that with dots and succubus, and bandage maybe every 4 mobs, and you have zero downtime. Voidwalker is pretty horrid for levelling because even a single dot will rip aggro off it, so you may as well switch to a pet that does higher damage and has PVP viability - just take a lot of the abilities off auto-cast (especially invisiblity - it bugs out mob aggro a lot and causes evades). I levelled at the Legashi encampment in Azshara farming felcloth and demonic runes from 55 onwards, and with all the runecloth they dropped, I didn't need any food or water, and had everything ready for Robe of the Void by 60.
---
I saw Boomkin in EPL. Level 60, so I don't know about leveling.  
---
It's not insane, just very slow. You practically need your own mage that would create you tons of water)  
---
P.S. Using Halloween candies may help with consumables :)
---
Try to stockpile them while event going.
---
&gt;LFD didn't hurt the community at all.
---
Must be a bait. Or a person who doesn't understand how MMO community works. Hint: it's much more than getting a group together. Like MUCH more.

but he literally doesn't need it?

You can't compare hardware from 15 years ago to the cloud infrastructure they use now lol

If you are on a shit computer, close the launcher after you load wow.

I mean to play devils advocate, taking a screenshot, digging it up in the screenshot folder then using paint to crop it seems like a lot more work then just taking a mobile pic directly into the post feature on Reddit
---
ESO players are like - first time?
---
Same but sharex works so I'm counting my blessings
---
Idk try ask the people at /r/classicwowplus
---
Damn got the items back instantly, thanks a lot!!
---
Well that's how you have loot councils and master looting for raids, so the one person can determine who gets what drop.
---
More dispelling. You may also find yourself assigned to a tank. Mana becomes a larger issue with fights stretching out and there are more players to screw up and take avoidable damage.
---
Bloodfang ?
---
This link may or may not be regularly updated anymore, but it was good at launch.
---
Alternatively, download Google remote on your PC and smartphone. Use smartphone to remote in to PC, open wow, try to get in to your server.
---
I'm sorry and this is an unpopular opinion apparently but this is exactly why I roll need on all boe items. When I get into a group I tell people to just roll need on them because I'm not letting some shit stain wait till everyone rolls greed then they roll need. Not happening.
---
Fyi if their is not someone to hit in melee range they will move a target to them. This is to prevent exploting via excessive kiting. If there isnt a tank in range in mc rag will start one shoting people also so be ready lul
---
Thoughtful, I like.
---
Well if everyone else wanted it to sell they could have needed, and if what he's saying is true (not saying it is) then at least he ISN'T just selling it
---
Make a yeschanges server for them then. Us who want nochanges should have our own to play in. The charm of Classic is in how clunky it is.
---
99% of the time it's not like this.   For every totally epic good time there's 10,000 lowbie/outnumbered ganks.
---
Just imagine it in a different way.
---
Would you rather take weapon which has
---
"Improves your critchance by 5%" 
---
or   
---
"Has a chance to stun your target for 3seconds"?
---
I think the answer should be clear. Axe &gt; all for a looong time until you have enough crit from gear to go sword.
---
*Screams in Dalek*
---
Explain! Explain!
---
Or he doesn't give a fuck lol
---
My favorite wow memory is being spooked for real in silver pine while leveling a warlock. The eyes in the bushes are seriously creepy!
---
this is really helpful- thanks!
---
Raid items remain tradeable for 2 hours but only with people who were eligible for the loot
---
My fondest WoW memory is when I got the Headless Horseman mount during MoP. The only retail expansion I played. Up until that point I had only played on private servers since TBC and after MoP I quit. I got back on with the Classic Launch. :)
---
Toxic
---
It doesn't matter what they are doing. Anyone that has been given a position in a raid group will be fully aware of what time raid starts on what day. Gathering mats for raid an hour before raid because they didn't spend the other 5-6 days out of the week doing that, is poor time management. There is no way anyone that has hit lvl 60 and geared to raid suddenly lost their ability to play the game outside of raiding. No one is perfect, but that still isn't an excuse. 
---
Every raider has plenty of time to prepare for raid.. if they are making their preparations last minute, that is further solidifying my argument of disrespect for everyone elses time.
---
There’s also valor chest and shoulders, painweaver band, brigam girdle, gyths skull of fire resistance, chromatic carapace... all items that are useful to tanks without having to be a wannabe fury or dps.
---
Lots of stuff can come through your nose!  My friend laugh/sneezed granola through his nose.  He said it was very unpleasant.  I on the other hand though it was hilarious.
---
That's awesome, what a great bunch of people! Congrats to you and the wife on getting hitched too! :D
---
Well just remember with rogues that you are getting precision for the main reason (outside of getting you incidental 5% hit, which is really fucking good), but also because you need those 5 points in precision to spec into Dual Wield Specialization, which is a huge dps loss if you don't have it (since off-hands normally have a 50% damage penalty). 
---
So really what this means is that if you are going off of this
---
https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/best-in-slot/rogue/?phase=pre-raid&amp;specialization=sword
---
for your pre-bis, then you may be over-speccing into hit.
---
Honestly this site I've found to be pretty bad in general, and most sites that list out "pre-bis" or "bis" gear for most classes are pretty bad about it. For rogues, I'd recommend using this 
---
http://shadowpanther.net/armor-sets.htm
---
and
---
https://shadowpanther.net/armor-pve.htm
---
and this
---
http://shadowpanther.net/swords-pve.htm
---
to figure out your best gear options. Shadowpanther is a fantastic resource for any rogues out there looking to min/max. It is dedicated to rogues, and it is sim-crafted near equivalent to retail. Wowhead, wowisclassic, icy-veins, are not. They are going off of random "top" rogues who may or may not be correct for certain gear choices, or their gear choices may be correct, but given the nature of these sites, they list out the "best" option regardless of context.
---
I think in general pre-bis and bis lists are not as simple as going to a site and figuring out what you need. Granted, you need to do that on a basic level, but on an even more fundamental level, the gear needs of your character, are going to be different based on the other gear that you have. The pre-bis and bis lists assume you are starting out completely naked and you got to equip everything all at once, which isn't how anyone anywhere gears up on anything.
---
What’s the other RT?
---
The only time a DPS should intentionally pull is when the tank asks them to (like my group using the warlock to wand pull for the prot pally). Otherwise, you pull it you deal with it.
---
At least it isn't Wrath, where groups would be jam-packed with Death Knights who hadn't even read the whole text on Death Grip and figured it was fine to be lazy and just Grip whatever they wanted to hit. I lost count of the number of times I was trying to tank Ramparts and had some idiot DK bitch at me for standing watching him blow defensive cooldowns on trash they didn't feel like running over to.
---
"WTF tank keep aggro"
---
"You taunted it, dipshit. You deal with it"
---
"Ur the tank"
---
"You sure? Then stop being a fuckwit unless you want to take over, then I can start gripping stuff away from you. I know I can survive it"
---
Let me guess “thunder fury Is a paladin wepon”?
---
Any addons that allow me to appear naked on my end? Not like nude, but just what I look like without ANY armor or clothing on?
---
Warrior overall.
---
Charging is cathartic. Got no OOM issues. Plus each tree is amazing in some form of play! :)
---
Playing a female Undead helps though, They look awesome when they do an Attack Skill... flips and spins. Flips. And. Spins. Then eat yo face. :)
---
I raid on AR.
---
It's not a high pop server.  Alliance and horde are fairly even.
---
The amount of time saved w/ a superior leveling spec is bigger than the time to farm gold for respec.
---
😯
---
/gquit
---
Do hinterlands next, its a mid 40s zone, but you  should still get decent xp.  
---
Then also check  out blasted lands, burning stepps, and Ashara.  and remember to run an ass-load of BRD!
---
That's tha sad part, I farmed around 2000g worth of crystals since hitting 60 and need all of them for my gear.
---
Invest in glasses. My 37 year old eyes can see it fine.
---
Onslaught girdle is rarer than you think and the DPS boost on your fury warriors would be better for speed clearing than the minimal threat gain for you
---
&gt; Call me an optimist.
---
You're an optimist.
---
Now is the last time that 60s are bored for a looong time to come.
---
I genuinely think now is the best time to sell twink items, because the most dedicated and knowledgeable players already blazed through the content and have thousands of gold to spare while nothing to do (no PvP, raiding once a week for 1,5-3hours)
---
Nothing wrong with that
---
leveling up is by far the best way to increase your gold income
---
Puggle.  
---
Setup separate tab for LFG channel and never look there again.  
---
Add custom strings to Puggle, setup sound notifications.
---
I mean... You should be need rolling BoEs anyway. However, he did roll a 95.
---
You can’t look much cooler than t2 paladin with hand of rag on an epic mount.
---
We wanted original vanilla back and that's what we got. The game hasn't changed from how it was back then, but the playerbase has changed drastically.
---
You have twice the amount of people on a server now, with roughly four times the amount going raiding compared to 15 years ago. Plus nowadays, everyone knows the game in and out. Everyone knows about elemental fire and it's value. Warriors are needing on leather and mail items for DPS, which was also a thing rather unheard of on most servers 15 years ago, when players would argue that "plate wearers have to wear plate".
---
On the other hand, do you really need Elemental Fire for raiding? Let's be honest here, you can kill Raggy and Ony without those potions. Sure it will be a bit harder, but it's still a joke compared to mythic or even heroic raiding on retail.
---
Overall I have to say, I love Classic. It's a great experience and I am glad I can replay my beloved game from 15 years ago and do all the things that I didn't do back then. But what I am really looking forward to now is the possible release of TBC later down the line. Truly, Classic is great, but people are starting to realize all the little problems and hiccups that the game also had back then. Like class balance or raid difficulty. And TBC fixes a lot of that.
---
Indeed, I can't see any difference between the two maps, but I'm fairly certain it was around here https://i.imgur.com/l7tYVDA.png, would have to check in-game to make sure.
---
If we could take it would be like that
---
You can accomplish the same functionality by leaving your combat log open and set to enemies only.
---
You just need to let them die. People don't seem to understand that from a bad DPS point of view that they just pulled a bunch of mobs, did a ton of damage, everything is dead and the group is alive. They don't know or care that they're only alive because the healer burned through their mana bar on a pull that should have taken 5% and is now sitting/drinking for 30 seconds... that's the healer being bad for not being ready to go! 
---
I just tell DPS - "I make the pulls, not you. If you want to go faster roll a tank.". This usually gets the response that they have a level 60 tank and that they're currently tanking rags on another screen while they do this dungeon and I'm just so bad I don't know what I'm doing etc etc, but after they die a few times or you kick and replace them the rest tend to fall in line.
---
I am a good guy
---
* Removal of Phasing
---
* Return to Quest hubs / no more trail of bread crumbs
---
* Return of classic style talent trees w/ 1 talent per level and not locked into a tree.
---
* 1 Difficulty per raid
---
* Significantly dial back catch up mechanics. Raids should not be obsoleted every patch.
---
* No Time gating on rep
---
* Removal of Dungeon Finder
---
* Legendaries need to be extremely rare again. Not something everyone gets
---
* No continued power grind mechanics (azerite, artifact knowledge, etc)
---
* No titanforging/warforging
---
* No Transmog
---
* Jewelcrafting functions like TBC/WotLK.
---
* Daily quests should feel optional. Anything they grant should be something you can get plenty of from elsewhere.  Such as gold and rep (assuming you can get rep from running dungeons). No one should ever feel punished for not doing dailies.
---
* Most reps should be able to be ground via running dungeons (ie TBC or WotLK)
---
* Bring Back server communites and elminate sharding. If servers are dying it needs to be a one time merge of the communities, not a flux of constant new players.
---
* No world quests
---
* Gear is what it is and doesn't conform to your spec
---
* Bring back old gear attributes, like Haste, AP, etc.
---
Honestly I don't think they can bring retail back to a point I want to play it. It's a completely different game at this point and if they changed it enough to the point that I wanted to play it they would probably lose a sizable amount of the players who have enjoyed the last couple of expansions.
---
There are a few thing about retail that are good. Almost all of the UI changes are positive for example and the mechanics of new raids  are good. But I think it would be far easier to bring those few things over to classic wow than to try to bring the classic feeling to retail.
---
I think they wanted to make it different from the Warlock/Shaman versions, but didn't want to give 2% crit because Eye of the Beast already does that.
---
Should have just made it spell hit but whatevs.
---
Personally I’d love to see these posts end. Game is two months old.
---
Well 1g for first respec 5g for second so its not to bad
---
That guy is famous? xD
---
Thanks for the support! Daggers are pretty fun. I believe the common understanding is Daggera get a bit stronger later on in the content, but I am enjoying the playstyle quite a lot!
---
Seriously, this isn't rocket appliance
---
True, you can also use it on mobs that flee and are hard to track down. I used this combo a lot on the harpies in Stonetalon mountains and some other mobs that can cause trouble if you don't get them quick. Crippling poison of course was key for this too.

I also feel sometimes that bleeds are tricky against classes that can instaheal, as they're more likely to notice big chunks of dmg and respond to that then they are lose life over time. Sometimes against priest but particularly against paladins, if you can get a big eviscerate or a nice ambush combo when they are at 40-50% can end them very quickly.   
---
Anyways, on many mobs i (being speccd into 75% to generate an extra combo) enjoy garrote -&gt; 3 point rupture -&gt; ss -&gt; snd. The 8 seconds or however long it is off of one combo point usually lasts right up until the end of the mob/player.
---
Nah he was in my guild for a while.
---
The good news is, the people who want that one item will farm and stop be replaced by slower levelers, but they will eventually not go back.
---
It will take awhile to get there obviously since the game is still pretty fresh.
---
Druid in Classic is more difficult than druid in BC/WotLK. Druid in arena wasn't very complex either, pretty comparable to other healers.
---
Yeah my warnings are "DPS if you don't let me make the pulls and give me 2-3 seconds for aggro I'm leaving". Then I leave.
---
If they can do a better job tanking, they can roll a fucking tank.
---
I know, but there's no reason why they would've had to do it that way. IMO that was just a convenient excuse for taking forever to release it, charging far too much money for it and doing a worse job than the Nost guys did.
---
This is very helpful! Thank you!
---
Turns out the main thing I (and I think also /u/TerraEarth) was hung up on was not realizing that 1.8 came before 1.12, not after, and so the 19% DW penalty is no longer a hard cap. TIL how software versioning works.
---
Before I started classic I told myself one thing, no IF sitting around wasting time. I'm either picking herbs, doing dungeons within a reasonable time, questing to wrap up 60 achieving items as I go.
---
Basically I tried to eliminate my in game life. That ruined it for me last time. I forged too many online relationships and they pulled me away from my real friends in Vanilla.
---
Who has the most use for the 100s of gold a boe can sell for?
---
Seriously. Say warden staff sells for 500g. It drops and the druid wants it. You say he should have it by default if he needs it. But of he needs it why hasn't he bought it yet? Cause he doesnt have the gold? So really he needs the gold. Not the piece. Well everyone need gold. Maybe the rogue needs the gold for his edgemasters. Does the druid get to take that amount of gold from everyone just because hes a druid? Is that fair? Is his need for the item worth more than the gold value? Because if he needs it that badly, he should have bought it. But if he needs the gold more then everyone need gold just as badly.
---
MC has no long fights, later on it would be an issue though.
---
I returned to WoW for Classic after many years (actually only even heard about it for the first time in September). My brother has been playing retail all these years and when he saw me log on Battle.net he wouldn’t stop trying to get me to play BfA with him.
---
I finally caved in and downloaded BfA. I had no connection with characters I hadn’t played in years so I created a new one. Here are my thoughts:
---
1- The beginning tutorial phase was absolutely brutal. Tried turning off “tutorial” but it didn’t work. The game would have these giant overlays telling me to place use this new spell I got, etc. Although this messages eventually stopped I continued to feel as though the game was treating me like a complete idiot who needs everything explained.
---
2- Mobs were a complete joke; there was no strategy to defeating quest mobs which was a huge contrast to fighting groups of mobs in Classic. This really made questing a huge chore rather than the adventure it’s supposed to be. On my Classic characters I need to plan and have food, bandages and other consumables ready before I head into a cave.
---
3- Although the world has crisper graphics, it actually doesn’t look nearly as beautiful as Classic. Orgrimmar is probably the best example of this in my experience so far: in Classic the Drag is actually shaded and darker with its own ambience, the flight master tower is huge and impressive, the layout feels like a real Orc settlement.
---
4- Dungeons in BfA circumvent the whole point of delving into a dungeon. I queued for Maraudon and our group did a handful of bosses before the dungeons was “completed”. Although it’s tedious to find a group in Classic it’s also incredibly rewarding to team up with players you have to speak to and delve into a dungeon and explore it!
---
I played BfA for a few days and made it to 42 in no time at all. Overall I felt more like I was playing a game like Overwatch or League of Legends by queuing for activities over and over. The world is empty and lifeless and there’s no reason really to go out and explore.
---
I honestly don’t know if it’s possible for them to dial back Retail to a point where I would actually enjoy it.
---
I’m absolutely loving every minute (and every corpse run) of Classic though!!!
---
I have no idea what that means.
---
I’m in the same position at lv55, holy paly and TBH I’m playing a lot less because of it. Maybe politely post your concerns in guild chat and see if anyone can help (my guild suggested rolling a tank :P) or start your own groups in 5/LFG. But, and here’s what I’m doing,  you may have to quest up a few more levels. I recommend Western Plaguelands where you can really shine due to all the undead. As always try and group up with others it makes a huge difference. Good luck!
---
You don't do any of that.  There's no digging.
---
Take the screenshot with prnt scrn (or alt+prnt scrn if you have multiple monitors.  Ctrl+v on the reddit submit page.  That's it.
---
Alternatively you can use the snipping tool to capture just a portion of the screen. Still just ctrl+v on reddit.
---
Incredibly easy.

---
I haven’t played retail since Wrath.
---
I’m happy with Classic.
---
depends on what you consider a decent amount
---
I know what a white and what a yellow hit is. As a hunter you need 9%(or 6% with weapon skill) for your HARD hit cap. I didnt have anything miss for 4+ ids and i dont know how to put it any clearer for you folks
---
Got some solid data for that?
---
They were staggered. The Druid quest was the last one and it came with 1.10 - but there were some class quests (like the Warrior one) that came out pre-AQ.
---
How large was the total server population though? It is a fair comparison if (pulling numbers out of my ass) 90% of the private server are in that one place? I'm guessing that the total number of players is a lot higher on Gehennas than on those private servers.
---
Your min/max isn't somewhere else. Don't even trip because gear is constantly gonna change it. So you're fretting will be constant. Don't let it drive you insane.
---
I know, but thought it could help a bit anyway
---
I'm one of the tanks of my guild, i tank dungeons all the time for over 10 years in fact.. dunno why you're all writing this bullshit like its impossible to tank when others pull for you. If they do too much dmg for you to get enough rage to spread your threat out evenly your job isn't tanking everything, its damage control. Focus high priority targets or mobs that go on the healer even. "Tank" isn't just "Let me run in first and give me 1 minute to build up aggro". You can still function as a tank or even a group if you have people like that in your group. Your focus shifts. Or if you are better you go faster and faster until you are in control again and they can't keep up instead. I don't know what kind of problems you are all having but it seems to me you all just started playing a tank.. I've yet to write something in /p that has something to do with the dungeon or tactics or whatever.. you can see everything going on around you, just open your eyes. Adapt. Be better.
---
I'm pointing out that you have no idea what you're talking about if you're shitting on warrior tanks. I'm levelling a Druid alt, but at least I know outside of raid healing they're pretty useless and I'd never take one to an instance unless it was a friend/guildie.
---
No. Case in point I was talking with a guildie about buying 80 bolts of rune cloth off him yesterday - I offered 70% market value, he said he'd rather sink it into his own Tailoring needs than take a hit. No harm, no foul. Guilds are personal piggy banks.
---
Yeah agree
---
No you could buy the reagent from any poison vendor. It 100% was rogues pissed they couldn't cc lock dwarves in arena.
---
I used to run this GoldenEye mission over and over, just to see that "leap of faith" ending. Fucking awesome!
---
What's the most OP, FotM class to roll at the moment? I have a 110 boost, not sure what to use it on.
---
I am playing rogue since I enjoy it 3rd most on my list primarily because I have the time to gear him out. 
---
One would be paladin.  Extremely powerful during leveling. Most annoying healers in BG’s under the sun. Seriously, you can absolutely find archived forum novels of the tears of horde complaining about the “imba”. 
---
Two is warrior because of the do or die mentally to play one. You need gear for them to be successful but it’s fun because every group you pull while solo questing is a crap shoot on terrific success or blundering failure. Good times and consistent repair bills.
---
As someone who was on a dead server late vanilla / BC and eventually left.
---
I would rather have this than no one to play/group/pvp with. I never want that experience again.
---
I just did MC with a pug in 2.5h tonight lol. Full clear.
---
Correct
---
Yeah dude, congrats!
---
Been a while for me, but you're buying the newest rank of your VW's taunt, correct?
---
Ok, then lets bring it out of the technical terms
---
Why is it that private servers have better performance than classic?
---
I don't care if it dedicated hosts per server or multi tenant servers or whatever is happening, if the PS can provide a better experience then that bar is at least the bar that Blizzard should hit.
---
Back to technical, if that means having 1 physical server hosting 1 realm with the highest clocked CPU with its own switch and its own DB array, then so be it.
---
Because that is what PS likely had doing, a single metal box with its own disks (IE not a SAN on a shared network connection in a blade chassis) and maybe even OCed processors + ram. Which is not doable on enterprise grade hardware, but they can get close with a nice Xeon E 2288G with a 5.0 Ghz turbo on single core (IE you can't really load it down with more than one realm, or even maybe one half of 1 realm to get 5Ghz).
---
They have likely optimized their data centers to NOT run on these kinds of standalone servers. Which is likely why we are seeing these issues.
---
That's also good to know
---
You do realise... Vanilla was just as dogshit in large scale fights ..
---
 yes, I was hoping Classic would bring us back to game, and i think to a degree it has. But not everyone understands what is needed. I cant imagine fun being run as fast as ya can. Last dungeon I did was on my elemental shaman running the entire time, zero fun. Guess they didnt need my dps. Oh, wait, the tank did finally die as the healer was oom aways back and drinking. Kind of out of balance when with the raid gear they can breeze thru a heroic almost alone.
---
For raids I swap to double soul bags one of which I keep in bank always stocked just in case.
---
This why I spec prot so I can tank and make my own groups. Totally worth it and I can always just throw on my healing gear to heal if there is already a tank. To tank all of BRD though you need to be upper 50s I think ideally. Mid 50s is fine for arena/angerforge runs. I would spec prot to finish your dungeon grind then spec holy once you don't need to 5man. At 52 you could tank ST, it is only the last boss that is tricky because he will put the person with the most threat to sleep then attack the person with the second highest threat.
---
SM/Ruin is a great end game spec, but considering you can't run SM AND Ruin until 60, there are far more optimal levelling specs that reduce downtime and make things smoother. Even as SM/Ruin at 60 I still consider respeccing to a drain tanking build for farming as it allows a lot more control - yes you can use other specs, but I wouldn't really call using the most optimal spec 'relying on a crutch' when it is moreso just optimising play.
---
I've had dreams of this game
---
This one irks me the most. When I'm a DPS and the tank is being slow, nothing is gained from me forcing them to go faster. I will offer help/tips/advice/as much as possible and if you aren't a dick you'll get a friendly tank to come with you!
---
I mean this is quite literally how my vanilla raid tank got started. I dragged him through endless scholo and UBRS runs until he was awesome.. to start he had no confidence and wasn't a good tank. A few runs in he was a solid tank. A few more we were tearing through instances. By the end of vanilla he was sporting Thunderfury and we were storming through content like there was no tomorrow.
---
People have to learn how to play. Those who whine there are no tanks but also expect all tanks to be BiS sporting superstars who also for some reason want to tank their instance need to shut up.
---
Introducing for the first time, the happy Mr. and Mrs. Bowman!!
---
I'm loving these TPB wow memes. Keep em coming!
---
Had a dude who just looted a chest in a run without asking and got an enchant someone else needed, first dude just laughed and said force of habit rushing to chests before others do, then when the other guy said can we roll for the enchant first guy just said no i used it already.....
---
&gt; I did a boar
---
*When you‘re **really** into hunter stuff.*
---
The claw is fantastic, its only drawback is you can't use Edgemasters or racial skill bonus. Which is a bonus if you haven't bought them yet.
---
- 50g BoE drops
---
- if you get it, you have a net gain of 50g of not needing to buy from AH
---
- if he gets it, he has a net gain of 50g for not needing to buy from AH
---
You're an entitled asshole. 50g is 50g. You don't deserve it just because you can use it. The NBG window literally only exists for vendoring BoP items.
---
Wait.. wasn't it cool to need on boe's y'day and I was the delusional one...?
---
Horde does all the Gankin.  Say hi to Yip and &lt;the House&gt;.
---
Yeah, I totally get what you mean. It's good to have Warlocks on hand to do summons if need be. But it rarely is a 'need' and more just a 'cba to put in effort going to the instance'. Seems to be some Strawmen in the responses too...
---
I like paladins for their utility and simplicity. The utility makes you useful to the group and provides plenty of oh shit buttons to mash when you get into trouble. Most of the time in any role Paladin is like 2-3 keys, so easy to mindlessly spam. However there's an amazing amount of depth to how the class is played mixing in the basic rotations and utility. In my opinion they're the funnest class to tank with. The aggro generation of a druid combined with the mitigation of a warrior, and the mana management of a priest.
---
If you want a challenge with a non-melee class I would suggest a priest. Priests have a superior toolbox for healing and damage compared to pallies. They're annoying to farm on if you're in healing spec. Paper thin defences with the damage of a wet towel.
---
The other class I would recommend is druid. Again, tons of utility and a very high skill ceiling. Of course the best way to level them is feral, which will play like a simplified version of the rogue with very little downtime.
---
Grouping up with a random in elwyn and eventually realising that it was a irl mate
---
i dread the times when wotlk comes to classic.... si much daily grinding
---
Getting Staff of Dominance with my druid back in Vanilla.
---
Stay tauren and get a wolf ezpz
---
Yeah each class feels so very different, it makes me want to play them all
---
I'm retail that feeling is not there
---
Ya that's not a filter or anything ....
---
You sound mad bro.  Maybe the next step is to stop taking this game so seriously.

Based on your username I've determined that this post is a lie. Children shouldn't be getting married.

It's great if you have mining
---
Yes they are and yes they do, they dont use them because they only look up wowbislists and there you will see devilsaur. They might be better I didnt do the math but only marginal. I have t2 legs with trueshot hands
---
Yep I always give the tanks a couple pulls, if they don't feel like marking stuff then I do it for them. Never had any complaints.
---
Tanks don't always need to lead. If they want to then I leave them to it, but if not I'm happy to sort it.
---
Can do it on my wolf 😎
---
I’m a priest who just got my true faith vestments pattern.  Am I allowed to roll need on righteous orbs  (ah for about 33g each one my server)
---
The total mats cost about 350-400g and I’m hoping I won’t need to buy all of them from ah.  
---
I just don’t wanna be a dick
---
Druid is probably the best at gaining threat back as your TPS with pummeler is insane.   
---
My understanding is in phase 2 she starts with the top and works her way down the list, fire balling people. If you get hit by a fireball it drops your threat a ton (if not resetting it to 0). This means if youre #1, you have little chance of being top by random chance.   
---
Your guild can play around the mechanic and have the mages/warlocks/warriors high agro going into phase 2, leaving rogues/hunters high agro going into phase 3 (when they can vanish/FD) and life is simply good.  
---
Outside of the perfect world though you can FF ony to gain SOME agro after you've been hit by your fireball, and if you get below her you can jump up and melee her.
---
i'd love a way to upgrade thrash blade to 60 and then epic quality.
---
Haha, yeah, I thought he had to do the same! I hoped he would forget about spirit res..!
---
Hahaha yea I was running for dear life, sadly one of your mages had an 100% mount.
---
Btw, what horde did today in BRM made the game unplayable. For every ally there are 4 hordes -_-
---
There's an option in the launcher that will force it to close once the game launches.

My first raid in Karazhan. I was a 70 warrior, with weeks of dungeon farming under my belt. Going for the gear was an amazing part of the game for me, and was so much fun. It also made my first run of Karazhan that much more satisfying.
---
Figured it out via another guildie of yours.  That's not me I'm the screenshot, lol.  Just randomly happened to capture that dude in it.
---
i hate when that happens...
---
Nah Skeram.
---
spicy boop
---
Im gonna name my boar Boaromir dont take my name or if you do send me gold
---
SFK is also less than 3% drop rate, Westfall bag is 76.
---
lol the dude who was given free bags is going to sit there and down play how limiting having no bag space is.  Fucking rich.  Alliance in a nutshell right there.
---
Would be better to start a new character at this state.
---
that's fair.
---
But do you have a cool tabard?
---
I'm on casual mode, so I judge guilds on tabards only. I switch guilds to match my aesthetic. A lot of guilds have shit tabards.
---
Note to self, start telling my guild mates about my engagement and the date of my wedding next year.
---
I always used the most up to date taunt ranks and would still pull aggro off VW with just wand alone - it's just simply not an effective tank.
---
What kind of gear do you equip for that fight? I've been using mostly +spell gear for moonfire. The strafing seems to be ok until she gets that one boulder cast off. Then I struggle from there. Makes me think I should stack more stam and/or armor.
---
I am used to groups where everyone passes and I win everything.
---
Senpahman
---
yes, I keep my demon's spells updated
---
Removing AP, Titanforging and LFR.
---
I don't mind the melee run of shame, I use that as an oppertunity to throw in a raptor strike, feign death and drop a trap. Usually explosive, sometimes immitation or freezing/ice.

He did this on purpose though, he wanted to res in moonglade!
---
So does mine with a purple filter
---
They used Illidan recently in Legion and now they're bringing LK back according to Blizzcon leaks. By LK i mean Bolvar.
---
Raw gold is not thaaat good. Its more about the mats you loot. Take herbalism, mining, enchanting - there is just so much to loot. Also maybe get twinks with tailoring for selfmade mooncloth and alch for potions from gromsblood and ghostmushrooms. My buddy and me made tons of money last days. (we also kill 4 lasher packs in our routine, that adds up more vendor gold)
---
Geared the fuck out tank here: low key, half the benefit is getting to be a prima donna.
---
Putting up with bullshit is for people who have to. If my group for whatever I want really sucks I can get another one in 2.44 seconds. I'm not gonna waste my fucking time. If I wanted to waste time, I'd have my Shaman friend log on and duo some drop runs for 100g/hr.
---
&gt;was
---
is, my friend
---
Huge burst and an answer to every class
---
That's crazy man, I would Nevada do this :o
---
You should just do it passively. You need a macro that adds pickpocketing before ever stealth skill then add [mod:Alt] to use them on mobs without pickpocketing loot
---
Mods that mess with graphics like this, even just for you, and even just for your display are against ToS.
---
exactly right
---
If you have mining and enchanting what would you say the average g/h is?
---
K
---
I read paladins have like a 3 button rotation to kill any enemy mob using the same ability over and over, is that true?
---
`[ Report player] `

All I know about warrior is that sunder armor&gt;heroic strike apparently
---
No all you plebs. Shift Windows S to snip.

I see a fellow Brisbanite saw the sunrise this morning, hopefully we get it tomorrow too.
---
Just had this happen when i fired up wow classic today, it hasnt happened before and ive being playing classic for over a month.  I had just quit Black ops 4 before i launched Classic though.
---
Yeah I noticed when i got cursed in wetlands, made me jealous of playing a HUMAN rogue
---
It makes no difference complaining about this - take advantage of the situation or adapt.
---
There are plenty of gold farming possibilities but they require more skill than siting around and waiting for a node.
---
Rogues can pick pocket BRD
---
Hunters can do Tribute runs
---
Locks can do Mara princess runs
---
Mages can farm ZF zombies
---
There's probably something for the other classes
---
You lack imagination. Imagine someone who only uses Reddit on their phone, and has never logged into their Reddit account on their computer browser, and does not have a keychain or browser sync across devices. Many people on Reddit use more than one account to compartmentalize things.
---
Oh wait no, of course. Everyone should do everything just like you because you are the best my apologies /s
---
The lack of imagination in people is astounding.
---
Why are you so angry?

I was thinking druid, but didn't know if mainig one in retail would I guess ruin it for me?

Top 3 classes while leveling this far?
---
I meain balance druid on retail, am highly considering it now after reading that
---
That backyard is a pearla, mate.
---
Angerforge drops HoJ, Emporer drops FoW. Blizzard swapped this around at some point during vanilla, which is why atlasloot and the like listed both to drop on each. People weren't sure which would drop from who.
---
The number of rogues that don’t seem to know that dwarves can’t be blinded is extremely high
---
Hey btw the lvl 40 mount is 60% faster not 40% faster. Idk if you created this but thought I’d help ya out
---
I'm alliance :/, I would play a shaman, but I have buddies on the alliance
---
What? There is so much to buy in classic. Epic mount first of all, then after that consumables for raids, reputation grinds, professions... there is so much to buy I will never have enough gold.
---
I'm more of a big sword person myself
---
I think need rolling does result in binding in retail, and I agree it's a good solution. But since that isn't available, we have to work with the tools that are.
---
Sure ill report your name. But it’ll cost ya 😉 1g
---
Flight Masters are basically PvP hubs once Phase 2 comes, you're just getting some good practice in.
---
Then if you have enough fire resist gear you can also kill incendius on the way to the coffer room.
---
Win - F - Enter is sorta my new Firefox shortcut and I feel so confused when it doesn't work like that in another computer.
---
Really hard to say. herbalism takes a big part too with all the herbs. If you get lucky with a lot of arcanite crystals you can get a lot! We get mostly 3-4 crystals in 5-6 hour sessions. you can probably do 4-5 runs each hour
---
Based on your username, I’ve determined that your comment is hypocritical. Children shouldn’t be on Reddit.

i think you overestimate how upset people are

it's just a pet peeve, doesnt take much energy to explain to someone how to screenshot once a week

He's the guy who keeps posting about his wife's boyfriend.

You both ultimately said the same thing.
---
Flamelash?
---
Lmao, how so?
---
Yep
---
So the issue is you can't log in to the browser site once?  And that somehow justifies shitty pictures of your monitor?  Talk about being incredibly lazy and tech illiterate.
---
onyxia is 100% just threat management.  phase one only wand to allow the tank to build up as much threat as possible.  phase 2 you can burn him. 
---
p3 just be careful about pulling threat and if you do, then run to the tanks to avoid everyone getting cleaved
---
Honestly, just launching a fresh classic realm that follows an established Phase pattern every now and then sounds like the easiest slam dunk ever.
---
Hur hur wife bad.
---
Neither do I. I just leave or kick on principle alone.
---
Exactly
---
Dont go off the pictures. What works for boes that sell for a lot of gold doesnt work for bops that have relatively little value or green nats and green boes. It's one system that's trying to fit for all cases and that doesnt work.
---
Go for what does work. Need on an expensive boe because everyone can use really expensive stuff. Dont need on bops tou dont actually need because they can only be vendored and their vendor value is much less than their worth to someone that can use it. Need on materials to varying degrees depending on the material.
---
Its a catch all system with plenty of holes so you work with what you got.
---
So I’ve heard. Not looking forward to being ganked all day tbh
---
Sure thing 😉
---
&gt;No you could buy the reagent from any poison vendor. It 100% was rogues pissed they couldn't cc lock dwarves in arena. 
---
100% not true. Blinding Powder uses Fadeleaf, which is obtained from lockboxes via pickpocketing and herbalism. There are ZERO vendors in classic or vanilla that sell Fadeleaf.  
---
You are probably thinking of Flash Powder, which is used for Vanish, not blind.  
---
Next time, before you make such definitive statements you should do a quick google search so you don't look like an idiot next time.  
---
Had very little to do with racial abilities, or they would have modified fear due to Will of the Forsaken.  
---
You said 100% though so I assume you have an official source for the reasoning? Or maybe you're just 100% wrong about that as well.
---
I pointed out in my original point that brut should go to a dps, but that doesn't make it a bad tanking weapon, its just a better dps weapon. Saying it's a bad tank weapon would suggest that if it dropped and all dps had it you wouldn't take it over quel or your prebis, which is just not true.
---
yes.. not balanced at all.
---
thats why warri is best dd Vanilla..
---
but u need some gear and worldbuffs
---
Use crowd pummeler for Ony, but farm up a maul out of the tribute chest and get a stone and counterweight going. Better than the staff currently with no agi chants available.
