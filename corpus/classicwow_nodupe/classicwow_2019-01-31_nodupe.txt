There are no item rolls in retail, we do not know if a need roll will remove the ability to trade it because it has in the past.

that looks like my account history.  so many free days because crashes.

Stop telling other people how they are allowed to enjoy the game.

If you don’t want to join a party then don’t join it.

Why am I so obsessed with classic WoW... Blizzard please end my suffering I need to play

---
I dont think you understand what I made a ranking for. I made a ranking of all the classes and their best race, not warrior and paladin, not warrior and 3 mages, but W A R R I O R.
---
I'm going to level without any quest helper and I will only look up things I can't figure out in a reasonable amount of time. I didn't burn myself out on vanilla and only got to level 40 back in the day. I want to experience it all again! Every single part of the game! 
---
Why are you able to make arguments like "Gnomes have to fight against orc and undeads" and I can't make an argument like "Gnomes get to fight with paladins on their team"?
---
Its ”buddy” until you get stabbed in the back while questing. 
---
It would be cool if it were done in a fashion like BDO housing. You could have the physical buildings in Orgrimmar/Stormwind with various sized rooms to choose as your home.  Once chosen youre housing is instanced, but people can also visit your instance. 
---
It's really hard to say. If we were still in Legion, I'd say around 80/20 in retail's favour, but right now Classic is coming out at a time where many people are upset with the current game, and have unsubbed. I could very well see the first month of Classic *slightly* outperforming Retail, but I'm perhaps too optimistic.
---
Warrior is the worst 1v1 class so none. You just gotta hope your opponent is bad in a fair fight with good gear on both sides.
---
Why are you talking about PvP duos? Im talking about the classes individually. But ok, a better duo would be 2 mages. Kite/IB when bubble is up and when it runs out paladin cant cast a single heal because he will be holy locked for 12 seconds if 2 mages are watching him ready to CS.
---
Can't kite blessing of freedom lol.
---
You can still enter MC via BRD on live. The portal is near the forge you use to make Dark Iron Bars. 
---
I don't do that! I just like flipping with knives 
---

Good times

***NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***
---
We were all tourists once.
---
So , to you, best pvp class / race combo OVERALL means only in a solo situation? Correct me if I am wrong, but where does the vast majority of vanilla PvP happen? In a solo situation, or in a group, in a battleground?  
---
What is the most coveted class of all in battlegrounds (besides arguable healers)? The staple of all premades ever? MS Warrior.  Why are you placing so much emphasis on solo scenarios when so much of PvP is NOT solo scenarios?
---
Cant kite blessing of freedom? What if the mage getting attacked by the warrior pops a fap himself and blinks away? Rocket boots? Nifty stopwatch?
---
Edgemaster's only works with 1H weapons. Black Grasp is better since it generates mana.
---
Whens the last time you let you and your buddies get schooled by a single enemy and then you all logged? Appreciate the positivity tho lol.
---
If you flag on a pve server and go to stv you are asking for it. 
---
Thats a pretty stupid comment to make considering the discussion is specifically about news from 15+ years ago, and that there is at least 14 years of more recent news that I may consider deserving if spoiler tags.
---
Okay, mage and warrior trade FAPS. Now Blessing of Freedom is cast. What do you do?
---
Holy nova is party only
---
Desperate prayer is self only
---
Downranking?
---
Not exactly rank 1 guild material if you don't even know the basics
---
This is me getting Top 5 on our 4H kill, hunters were great if used and played right. My guild ran with 2 hunters per raid, I was one of them. This allowed us to stack gear at a higher rate than most others and me and the other hunter would get Top 10 on most fights, some times even Top 5. The low point for me in vanilla was late AQ and early Naxx. Late Naxx I started to get nice numbers again. And that was before I got my KT xbow, which is my main goal to get again in Classic from Day 1. 
---
We wanted classic for the progress feel. For that game you gave invest much effort and time into. For the gear to means something again. For the proffesions to be rewarding again. For server comunity again, guilds and 40mans. TBC was good, no doubt. BUT it killed all vanilla progress everyone did. So it was a mistake like every single expansion that brings more levels. (So every single one). If blizzard gave us 10 expansions with huge gear/difficulty scaling, they will do better. Fuck newcomers. It could take them a year to reach endgame at all at this point but lets be honest. They will apreciate it in the end. 
---
You can disagree with me ofc. Just go back to bfa and buy 100 lvl boost then. LOL
---
I've tanked endgame in vanilla in tbc. I became tired of the pressure and people always blaming the tank for wipes. I switched to a hunter. Pvp is a lot more fun, and you don't have to be on your A game 24/7 during raids or 5 man. 
---
Ofcourse you cant make that argument, when you are ranking class/race combos you obviously only take into account that you fight vs other/class race combos, how else would you rank them in PvP? You somehow seem to think that Im ranking arena setups or something
---
"WARRIOR IS REALLY GOOD BECAUSE OF PALADINS" WELL IM NOT RANKING WARRIOR AND PALADIN, IM RANKING THE FUCKING WARRIOR
---
The exact way they describe it in Blog is how it was in Cata.
---
You’re the one making the leap of assumption if you think this, not anyone else 
---
Tab, sunder armor, tab, sunder armor, tab, sunder armor....
---
Ofcourse Im ranking solo scenarios, how can I rank the strength of A CLASS when I take into account other classes helping them out????????? HEY DUDE DRUID IS REALLY FUCKING GOOD, 39 PALADINS IS RUNNING BEHIND HIM AND HEALING HIM SO FUCK YEAH THAT SHIT IS REAL
---
Hell yeah
---
The problem with Enh Shamans is Stormstrike is absolute garbage, raid bosses have high Nature resist, Shocks are expensive af, and if you gear for one type of damage (melee/spell) you're forced to gimp the other.
---
It just doesn't work. I wish it did, but it doesn't.
---
As interesting as it sounds dude, I dont think we can computer simulate a 2v2 situation in a forum
---
I'd say at launch it would be 80/20 but after a couple months 75/25 or so. But I'd think it'd be 50/50 for a little while after a new retail expansion releases.
---
I am not talking about arena setups. I am talking about the primary form of PvP available in Vanilla, BATTLEGROUNDS. You say we are talking about the highest echelon of skill and play. How can we not be considering premade BG's as the core portion of PvP in this game? 
---
Stop using this arena strawman. I have said many times my position and asked you many times why you seem to think PvP means 1vX situations? 
---
We don't need to. Spoiler alert: Warrior + Pala wins the matchup.
---
I already answered it, you can't rank a class/race combo based on other classes/races helping you in a team scenario like battlegrounds. Just because battlegrounds are popular PvP places, doesn't make them viable for ranking a class/race combo. In battlegrounds you can only rank teams of class/race combos, and that is not ranking a class/race combo. How can you not understand this
---
Alright, if you aren't able to mentally process how the interactions between one class and another shift balance of the individual classes then I think we are done here.
---
PDATE: 09/03/09 
---
Please be advised that it has been 30 days since BoP Item Trading was introduced. As this change is intended to place greater place control and responsibility in our player’s hands, we are very unlikely to interfere with related item transfer requests moving forward. 
---
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Greetings all! 
---
We are pleased to announce with the advent of Patch 3.2 players are now allotted 2 hours of in-game time to freely trade Bind on Pickup items between members of the group or raid who participated in the loot-yielding encounter! 
---
In almost any situation, a player can be traded a soulbound item if they actively participated for a portion of the encounter, were in the party eligible for the loot, and initiated the trade before the two hour window expired. For example: 
---
Players are eligible to be the recipient of a soulbound item within the two hour window if they: 
---
Were alive and present for the entire encounter. 
---
Participated in the encounter but died. 
---
Died during the encounter but released before it ended. 
---
Participated in the encounter but were disconnected before it ended.
---
Players are ineligible to be the recipient of a soulbound item within the two hour window if they were: 
---
Outside of the instance for the entire encounter. 
---
Offline for the entire encounter. 
---
Not a member of the party that initiated the encounter.
---
In light of these changes, we will be examining our policy regarding Game Master assisted item transfers for the next 30 days. Although we will continue to assist those who request item transfers during this time, please be advised that our stance may change once this observation period concludes. 
---
Please Note: Despite this change, we strongly encourage you to continue choosing your groups and looting methods wisely. If you are invited to join another player’s group, please discuss looting rules with the group leader and master looter (if applicable) before entering an instance or engaging in an encounter. We recommend that you decline the invitation to join a group if you are uncomfortable with the leader’s adopted looting rules. For additional tips on how to avoid being scammed, please review our Scam Prevention FAQ found here
---
 you think this is a game????
---
THIS IS WAR 
---
So being considerate is directly correlated to the time a specific piece of entertainment is available? If you're going to spoil something no matter how old, you can't really be mad when it's done to you. The only stupid comment is yours bud. 
---
OFCOURSE I CAN PROCESS HOW INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ONE CLAS AND ANOTHER SHIFT THE BALANCE OF THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES. WARRIORS ARE SUPER STRONG WITH A HEALER, BUT THEN IM NOT RANKING THE WARRIOR ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
There was a time I agreed with that, but that time has passed.  I'm still debating pvp/pve, but I'm leaning towards PVE, just due to not wanting the frustration.  I played on both in original Vanilla, and enjoyed both.
---
Nope
---
I wholeheartedly disagree. Warriors/Mages are the best class in BG. Battlegrounds are a significant part of PvP.  Therefore you have to take that into consideration when you make a ranking. You don't just ignore it.
---
Oh god, the memories
---
We are done. Your arguments have degraded. You somehow think best in PvP overall means only in solo situations. I can't agree with that so we won't be able to move forward in this situation. 
---
It is a simple question really, with only one, simple answer. Warrior and mage trade FAPs. What does the mage do when freedom goes down? You said you know skilled PvP right?
---
God.... when that red hunter arrow appeared above my head in STV... as a holy priest. I knew I was already dead.
---
TLDR
---
Was this really a thing in Vanilla? I don't think this has been the case on any Pserver I've played (I know, I know) and 15yo me didn't pay much attention to rep gain during retail vanilla so I can't remember. 
---
I don't know if this is helpful for the dungeons. [imgur.com/a/IVerbBg](https://imgur.com/a/IVerbBg) 
---
They are in lowest level order.
---
Maybe if the combat log was a bit taller, but this just shows the 1hit potential of shamans if they are equipped correctly against squishy opponents
---
If you play on a PVE server, and it's still fun for you...go for it! You do you! 
---
However, I will strongly encourage you to level an alt at least on a pvp server. The constant threat of a pending attack adds a while new dynamic to the leveling process. And yes, there will be 60's eventually that gank your lowbie and if you're by yourself there isn't much to be done. But in my experience, most of the pvp I found back in the day, was against other people questing around my level in that zone. And I started just 6 months before TBC. I can only imagine the fun on a fresh classic server, with little to no 60's on it!
---
Technically possible depending on class, skill level, gear advantage/disadvantage, and level difference (assuming all are +- 3 or so). If the 3 are acting independently in a medium sized area (not actively coordinating) it gets easier. 
---
You sound like a salty victim. 
---
I think he means the Emerald Nightmare Raid. Which was a corrupted version of the Emerald Dream. 
---
You see a “purified” section of it at the end of the raid and it’s very pretty. 
---

all of them. I play every class to some degree. 
---
But mostly undead rogue. 
---
stealth to solo objectives ignoring trash. 
---
only pvp on my terms.  VANISH!
---
cannibalize is a higher tier taunt than teabagging.  possibly best taunt in gaming. plus it gets you back into the game faster. 
---
WOTF. 
---
underwater quests or hiding in the pond in AV isn't a problem. 
---
pickpocket gold way more than the mobs drop. 
---
pick locks so you always have treasure. 
---
 death to the living.  
---
Is this new information?
---
My honest opinion is that a year after classic drops. Retail won't exist as a game. I am not hating on retail but, people are quitting for a reason. It doesn't offer much other games don't have anymore. It's all more polished sure but, it's not a very unique experience anymore.
---
If they remake classic with no sharding though. It will be the only thing like it on the market. It will explode for the reason that type of experience can't be had somewhere else. Classic wow is deeply flawed in many ways. Its not as polished as the new game for sure but, it is a much more unique and, enjoyable game.
---
Classic wow used to steal peoples souls for a reason. The people telling you it will be dead in 6 months have no idea what they are talking about and, never played classic. To be clear I am not disparaging the new game. It's not bad, but at the same time. Why? What are you getting from new wow that isn't cloned by a million of it's competitors? Frankly since sharding even calling it an MMORPG is a lie.
---
John Staats confirmed that the portal was for player housing that never came to fruition.  
---
I think rogue was the 5th class I tried.  first one to 60, never looked back.  
---
That is utter bullshit.
---
[removed]
---
Show me on the doll where the rogue touched you.
---
So hes not correct then? Like just speculation on the matter?
---
 Why does your post history have you asking people about warriors in vanilla PvP on a private server subreddit?  
---
I thought you knew about Vanilla PvP. Looks like you actually don't know shit just as I expected.
---
Get exposed.
---
Does the doll have anatomically correct orifices? I'm not sure I can reach far enough to show you where the dagger ended up. 
---
in my mind the picture is a hunter kiting an enh shaman and the enh shaman dazed and slowly walking towards the hunter but cant get within range to use frostshock 
---
Making bags, wands ect 
---
That's the beauty of vanilla. You actually need to group/organize to fight for your zone or at least find ways around PvP. It's not like you can't level efficiently w/o doing that exact quest you had in mind.
---
Also escalating PvP situation is the most exciting thing in vanilla. People actually cared about PvP and fighting. Sometimes a prolonged skirmish could even lead into chasing past multiple zones and even City Raids.
---
This is one of the things I look forward to the most. PvP kind of got destroyed for me with TBC because of flying mounts and Arena, they basically sucked the whole life out of it (allthough raiding was much better then).
---
It can be with more context, this was in ghost wolf form and a one shot on a mage.
---
ikr but ledditors like to speak out of their asses
---
Opposite faction bug essentially made gearing harder and take longer, what your asking for is an easier time leading to less time spent playing, easier drops. And for what? Droprates weren't an issue in vanilla, don't make this change which increases them.
---
Glad you aren't a dev 
---
How the fuck would you even know that other people are using the toggable models?
---
Are you going to ask people before interacting with them if they have it on or not?
---
So ridiculous.
---
You're assuming that magma totem has a 34% spell coefficient every tick, yeah? I highly doubt that, it's probably 34% total over the totem's duration which would be 3.4% per tick.
---
Undead rogue, did one on 2005 and been playing with same character since! Every other class just aint for me. Ive even leveled 6 x 60lvl undead rogues on various private servers 😁 rogue4life
---
Should they and would they are two different things. I know they won't do it for the better of the game. However I don't envy being a mage or lock with their raid prep bullshit.
---
Druid cuz I like higher skillcap classes and mobility, and hate not being able to do everything, as well as sitting in CC or dying. Since Druid can avoid what feels like the majority of the cc in the game and is pretty much unkillable it always stuck with me.
---
Also, you can avoid looking like a clown because you can shapeshift.
---
And I like cats. Which back then was the main reason I rolled a druid.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Dunno why people give druid so much shit when it has so much going for it. 
---
How would you even know that other people are using the toggable models?
---
I'd say farming end game dungeons like Strat Live for Orbs or doing Solo DM farm (provided it's out) if your class can.
---
&gt; None of what you actually said argues against what I said 
---
Yes, I did? The only reason "PvE endgame rushers" would be the only ones concerned is because the casuals *don't know they should be concerned.* So, I, a "PvE endgame rusher" am concerned *for* them. The part of ClassiCast I linked covers this - it doesn't make sense for Blizzard, the hardcores, the casuals, or for Classic as a product.
---
&gt; Argue for better content release if it's possible yes. 
---
Literally the only parts of your post I was concerned with, and it's exactly what I'm doing. The impact is **not** minimal. The economic implications alone counter that. 
---
I'm excited to read it! I love hearing about other people's experiences.
---
So what happens if someone is offline. Or they are not in party anymore.
---
I wonder... if someone was to say... play a melee shaman, what would be the best set up? Purely selfish personal dps, not taking anything to specifically help others.
---
The video is pointless, and I could give two shits about what some casual RP'er wants me to perceive him as. There is a reason why there are separate RP realms. Adding graphical upgrades will do absolutely nothing to the gameplay. 
---
Wow token is automatically applicable through the current version of the game. They share a subscription 
---
During the first month? If you're hardcore enough to be farming end game dungeons within the first month you probably don't need money tips.
---
I'll kill you
---
Didnt they sell a turtle or a tiger mount in vanilla?
---
No phasing. No instanced story.
---
Shit just happened in the world and you either participated or stood back far enough to watch and not die but eventually die.
---
Which one? 10-15% Retail?
---
Not at all. Stratholme can be done quickly if you're with a group who's comfortable with each other. Shouldn't take more than 40 mins per clear. Just gotta remember to res orbs/recipies from Pugs who are there for gear.
---
2 million accounts for Classic is no small feat
---
Launch: roughly 40/60 to classic.
---
6+ months in: Probably 65/35 to retail.
---
First of all, I think most people that comes back to classic from retail will refresh their memory of how good of an experience classic is compared to retail. The social aspect alone, where you can go around in Ironforge/Stormwind/Orgrimmar,etc etc.. and casually run into friends or random people you have seen from time to time in the open world while doing dungeons or quests.. or just start bantering with random people for fun outside the bank or on the famous Org bank roof. That is non-existing now and I think people will be reminded of how comfy classic WoW really is. Having an actual community around you.
---
Secondly, people have to keep in mind that BfA is not doing so hot right now. Not even major patches has hyped the game up, this recent patch had its hype die in a day or two.. the amount of hate it gets from the community is not even comparable to past expansions this early on. This will hurt the numbers for retail which is why I think the launch population of classic will surpass the population of retail, BUT retail will claim the spotlight again later on.
---
This is just me projecting though, obviously I have no clue what the numbers will look like and none of us will know since they don't report player numbers anymore.. but classic will guaranteed surprise a lot of retail players.
---
He’s one of those “if can be orc must be orc” single minded guy. Who basically ignores the meta that alliance &gt; horde cause paladins are so much better at support. Blessing of kings best buff in game. BoP and bof also OP buffs. Also apparently he’s never heard of FAPs cause every class in the game can have stun immunity for 30 seconds. 
---
TL;DR:  I don’t think they will consider such a thing until later.  For that reason, It’s good to have these posts now and keep things authentic against an instant gratification populous.
---
I’m almost certain they will not implement a WoW token or cash shop for Classic.  It seems to be against Blizzard’s general philosophy on Classic.  (I’m no authority, though)
---
I believe that Activision has little more than a board of people and shareholders putting the pressure on Blizzard to “make more money”.  That’s it. No creative direction-ing.
---
If Classic becomes amazingly successful, I feel there may be more pressure to implement or engineer some sort of gimmick added for financial revenue to the game.  (I’m against this)
---
This becomes a delicate balance at that point to determine whether they should even try maximizing profits vs maintaining their integrity, but it all will have to pan out. (It ultimately comes down to who plays classic in the coming months and years.)
---
I feel that the best way they can build on their integrity and still do something to cash in some extra funds, they may explore BC and WotLK in some way.  Maybe a purchasing of those expansions?  Who knows.
---
Right, but you cannot use it to buy gold in Classic.  That's when it gets problematic. 
---
Nah. The tank threat modifier is closer to Vanilla now than it has been in 3-4 expansions. 
---
If a tank has worse gear than their DPS, they will probably not be able to kee threat on everything.  
---
And when it’s Skittish week even tanks that outgear their dps will end up taunting on CD.
---
There was something IIRC about if you buy some random thing you get a redeemable token for a special mount in game, like a spectral tiger or something. 
---
I'll just have to constantly remind myself "Only X more levels until Death Coil"
---
I heard skinning and selling the materials to a vendor is a good way to go?
---
In what way? Everything I described is accurate. Everyone experiences that questline because it's so on rails
---
Yes this is what I’m referencing, sorry I should’ve been more clear here.
---
I think you're missing the point where you need to be lv 60 in a month. Most people won't come close to that.
---
&gt; Everyone experiences that questline
---
Good.
---
&gt; I disagree completely. I think the fact that the enemy is a real and threatening element of the world makes the game far more compelling, simply because you know you could be assailed at any time.
---
Like I said, the problem is that almost all of the time when you are assailed the result is not an interesting game.
---
&gt; There is skill in being able to inflict pain on the enemy, avoid enemy ganks yourself, and occasionally win a fight when caught at a disadvantage. 
---
Run towards lower levels, run away from higher levels, and hope the other person is bad. I think I've summed up most of it.
---
&gt; Face it, PvP servers offer many facets of play that PvE servers don't and can't.
---
One facet. Non-consensual PvP attacks. Almost always by people pretty sure they will win. Like I believe I said elsewhere you'd get most of the same effect just by having you randomly die every now and again, and randomly die again as soon as you respawn every now and again.
---
&gt; I hate to stereotype but many of the players I've encountered that preferred PvE servers were weak players who refused to make friends and nursed a victim mentality.
---
By definition people who do not PvP will be worse at PvP than people who PvP, hence "weak". And if you are on the receiving end of ganks then you do not "nurse a victim mentality", you are a victim in the perfectly ordinary sense of the word. And not everyone plays WoW to "make friends".
---
So I think all you are really saying is "I look down on PvE players because they don't like ganking people enough to put up with being ganked".
---
Now I will grant you that by necessity the skill floor on PvP servers is higher, and people can't get away with being one-dimensional carebears so much. I have played with PvE healers who levelled by healbotting a warrior or rogue and literally don't even have their offensive spells on their hotbar. Which bites their team in the arse on fights like Jindo (IIRC) where everyone needs to bring their DPS game. But if that's how they enjoy the game I don't see any need to try to puff myself up by calling them "weak".
---
&gt; There is a reason almost all popular private servers have been PvP servers - the ruleset appeals to gamers of the vanilla generation who weren't afraid to play a game where you are free to interact with others in both positive and negative ways with the training wheels off.
---
You are rewriting history in a major way here. PvP servers and PvP players were never the majority in the real vanilla generation. And you're still playing your spin game where you pretend people who don't enjoy ganking others are "afraid"/"weak"/whatever and by implication you are very brave and strong behind your keyboard.
---
&gt; That said, if your preference is PvE, if that is how you see yourself as a player, I'm glad you will have the option.
---
I enjoy fair(ish) PvP - I played battlegrounds, I don't think I ever got past rank 7 or 8 in vanilla but I had the Wrecking Ball achievement on multiple toons in TBC/WotLK, I melted a lot of faces at 49 on my shadow priest before I got bored of WSG and AB and levelled up to 60. PvP is fun, but I don't find ganking people fun and I don't find being ganked fun.
---
When I did briefly play on a pirate PvP server I rolled a hunter, and it was effing overpowered, and I knew how to kite, and as a result I killed people much more often than I got killed. It just wasn't any fun for me.
---
If I got to make wholesale #changes so that there were penalties for corpse-camping or ganking lowbies or mechanisms that prevented it outright, rewards for equalish-level PvP that mattered during the levelling process, comeback mechanisms, meaningful goals other than scoring kills, that kind of stuff that modern PvP games have, I could see rolling on a PvP server. But fundamentally the Classic WoW world PvP game is a very bad game and most of the time not worth playing. Unless you *really* enjoy the idea that you are ruining someone else's day.
---
And that is the essence of casualification. It's ok to like casual stuff. Most games I play I play casually. I'm just making accurate arguments. Please don't take it personally.
---
Herbalism. Devilsaur. Mining. Grind crusader.
---
I doubt I'll be much beyond level 35 after four weeks play. Mans gotta work 8 hours a day and travel to and from work. Not enough time!
---
No, you're arguing for excluding people from content, which is an asshole thing to do. This attitude shit is why LFG came about in the first place and why WoW had to become casual.
---
I think if you look at classic wow in terms of making the most money, adding a cash shop and other changes for small prices will drive players away who are paying $15 monthly. Imo, the $15 subscription will make ActiBlizzard more money than implementing a cash shop no one wants that will drive away streamers who have influence  and their viewers and players in general. So, the most sensible approach to Classicwow for ActiBlizzard is nochanges and replicating vanilla as close as possible to sustain a large player base. This renews trust in ActiBlizzard, strengthening the bond between players and the devs while making them the most money.
---
And to hear the lamentation of their women. 
---
I don't know when, but I know they will find a way to charge 50$ for it. 
---
I love vanilla but let's not get carried away, this vs wrathgate..  really?
---
Lol try doing it on a pvp server. You will literally be playing on a bone carpet if you are within half a mile Nessingway. Lol
---
I would say that the majority of people who play PvP servers kid themselves that there is a major distinction.
---
Most PvP battles are a preordained conclusion. People love to selectively remember and recount the unicorn cases where they beat the odds (usually because the other player was bad) but most of the time there's enough of an imbalance that there's no real uncertainty to the outcome.
---
theres nothing inherently wrong with selling cosmetics for money, like mounts and shit, but selling gold is wrong..i think they even sold a charity mount in vanilla.
---
IIRC the concept was there, but I'm not confident on the numbers. I do recall gradually getting rep with other factions as I leveled in one races zones. It felt particularly noticeable for forsaken, since they started at neutral with the other Horde races. 
---
No trade happens. It's supposed to be for "Oops I accidentally hit need" or "you need this more than me" type situations so that shouldn't be an issue.
---
So you gonna be a healer ultimately then.
---
It's great when combined with a timer addon. Set a timer when something does then be ready to kill it again as soon as it spawns. Without standing around just waiting for it.
---
Really good for those quests that are really crowded.
---
best reason to roll horde: don't have to face shamans
---
Exclusion isn't really the right word because it is completely volitional. But exclusivity isn't a bad thing at all anyway. They are choosing to not do it because there is so much else to do in the World of Warcraft and in their own lives. But for those that end up doing it, it feels much more rewarding for them because of the price fact that it is special and epic.
---
When cool shit is handed to you for little to no effort. You can't appreciate it as much. It is impossible to have as much appreciation for it compared to something that you worked hard for. 
---
It comes down to this:
---
The Wrath Gate scene is handed to you before you have really even accomplished anything. The scene in the OP requires weeks of work because of all the dungeons involved. And btw you end up making friends along the way and you walk through SW *together* and fight a bunch of Dragons and see exactly why FOR DRAGON is a boss and can handle being the Lich King. Wrath Gate you are just a spectator who feels like you have earned nothing and are alone because you didn't need anyone else to get that reward.
---
Don't call me an asshole for making a rational, well supported argument. That's not a good way to behave with other people.
---
"I was done in 2004 I refuse to believe that there is any possible way that any kind of bug could creep in as they update the whole mess of 2006 code to the 2019 version of the game".
---
I agree that Bliz will have a lot of 'verifying' to do. Like, *a lot*.
---
The pathfinding mechanics of Charge. Stealth pulsing - and +detection mechanics. mp5 ticks and buffs. (just to name a few)
---
But they have the 1.12 client. They have the "golden copy". They don't care what pserver folks think. 
---
A beta would help them get testing for free -- which is why I'm *pretty sure* they will do a beta. It also helps stress test, etc. But I don't think they would do a beta for the sole purpose of validation &amp; verification of mechanics (as only they have the golden copy).
---
It might actually be the best part of Classic WoW (this is really hard to condense so sorry if its not very TLDR):
---
You get a quest to kill the black drakes of the Burning Steppes, during that you discover the Black Dragonflight is the reason the Blackrock Orcs are so hostile. This is of concern to the alliance, especially those at Redridge so you are sent to Lakeshire, and then to Bolvar in Stormwind to get help.  
---
After you speak to Bolvar, he requests you ask Lady Prestor in the keep near him about the dragonflight and what threats they may pose. She dismisses the threat, and Bolvar reluctantly deputizes you alone to look into the matter for proof that he can act on. You are then sent to a Marshall back in Burning Steppes for that proof, who tells you his commander had it but was overrun by an orc raiding party. The Marshall wants you to find the only person who survived the orc raiding party to hopefully find the trail/whereabouts of his commanding officer.  
---
The man you find remembers that Marshall Windsor, his commanding officer, was taken off to a prison. Upon hearing that Marshall Windsor may yet live, his lieutenant sends you into Blackrock Depths to find him.  
---
When you enter BRD, you search the prison cells near the entrance until you find a human prisoner, Marshall Windsor. You ask him about his proof, he tells you it is lost(while cursing Bolvar for not being able to figure it out himself) and tells you to leave him be. This news disheartens his lieutenant completely, and the chain is dead(its not).  
---
As you kill the inhabitants of BRD, an item will drop that is just a balled up piece of paper.   
---
 The note has stains covering its surface. The text is barely legible, but you make out the following:  
---
...sweet irony...  
---
...the fall of the broken Alliance...  
---
...if it were not for General Angerforge's diligence, we may have never discovered the pattern to the encryption...  
---
...Argelmach is almost done with the decryption of Windsor's notes.  
---
Our lord will rise from the depths and crush any that remain...

---
Classic Runescape ended up being bigger than retail Runescape, by far. So you never know.
---
Don't even try it here, there isn't a single subreddit that circle jerks harder than these guys. Most of them talk a lot of game, but never even cleared half the Vanilla raids until the pserver era. 
---
honestly I would just go play somewhere else  
---
Dont think you know my intentions on everything, I often ask people about all sorts of things for a variety of reasons. If I ask on a forum if x is better than y, that doesn't mean my intent is to learn from answers given by retards like you
---
Wrathgate is part of the story. **The story.** It's not giving you stuff for little or no effort. It's progressing the plot of Wrath. It takes just shy of getting the achievement in the zone, as well as needing to do quests *all over the world* and a dungeon chain in order to unlock it.
---
You. Are. An. Asshole. **Period.**
---
You're telling people they have no right to experience the game's story. You're also telling people they have no right to clear ICC, which is the payoff for Wrathgate.
---
Wut, totally forgot about that. Quite exciting, if it was in the pre patch I suppose they could bring it in later 
---
There's no shame in it, I've always played pvp servers but am considering pve since I primarily play vanilla for the pve content anyways. wpvp is rarely fair, it's either multiple people attacking you at once, some asshat attacking you while you're half dead fighting mobs or just a bored lv60.
---
The mechanostrider (as an example) was locked to Dwarf/Gnome until Wrath. Even the rank11 PvP one was locked until Wrath.

---
While I would rather not see a cash shop or token *at all* in Classic, it keeps the Chinese gold sellers out of business. I'd expect to see one.
---
No I'm not. You are putting words in my mouth. They have every right to experience it. They just have to work for it. And many won't. And that's what makes it special. 
---
You're clearly the asshole here.
---
This I 100% agree with.  The only thing to look to as a problem later is a series of forum posts and complaints that outweigh players.
---
I feel that, given Pserver popularity and audience, this will be Blizzard’s main clientele and should keep Classic in shape.
---
The concern I have is if that community dies, gets outnumbered (end of Wrath/start of Cata style), and leads to a dominant “changes” group, then it will suffer from these harmful practices.
---
Thankfully, it seems Blizzard has been pretty adamant on keeping everything the same and I’m super stoked for it!  (I could never even waste time or money on getting tokens anyways.)
---
Man Shadow priest was so fun
---
&gt; Outland greens would compete with Naxxramas gear, which would effectively either make old content irrelevant, or make new content accessible only to hardcore raiders
---
Reality check: This never fucking happened.
---
Naxxramas gear was on par with blue pre-raid BiS level 70 gear. In some cases better.
---
What part of you have to work to experience the Wrathgate do you not understand? If anything, it takes *longer* to do it than it does the Onyxia encounter.
---
Asshole.
---
Yes! No changes! Activision Blizzard needs to listen to their fanbase and not shove cash shops and tokens down our throats in Classic to maintain the integrity of Classic.
---
You need Nightfall. You will want to stack strength gear. Check out the fury warrior BiS, and whatever you can’t get, replace with the gear from rogue BiS. That will be really close.
---
Hyped to hit dat toggle for the new models.
---
Same here. Mechanics are all that matters to me. But then, I'm an HD remaster whore. If it's a game I loved and has been remastered, I'm getting it.
---
Some of my best wow memories were sneaking into RedRidge as a low 20 and ganking with my guildies... You could ghost wolf and hide between ridges pretty well.
---
It was Wrath.
---
You'll have no problem clearing naxx as its pretty easy since half your group isn't afk or doing their RP during boss fights. 
---
I think you forgot the /s at the end of your post.
---
No everyone knows what you mean he is just being pedantic for no real reason.
---
Then look elsewhere, I love WoW but for anyone who moved from EQ to Vanilla, it's such a super casual mmo. 
---
I had some No Changes weeb try to tell me one time that he made his character look a certain way because that's how he wanted it to look and I had no right to display his character in any other manner than that in which he originally designed it. I'm toggling his ass to modern graphics the instant the game launches.
---
Well yeah, most people in vanilla were casuals. 
---
Sorry but elemental is not good in PvE. Prioritizing mana over spell power absolutely throttles your damage output compared to mages and warlocks, and is in fact the worst idea ever. Not only that, but almost ALL bosses until Naxos have heavy Nature resist, the shaman does not benefit from synergy with other classes that mages and locks benefit heavily from, AND they still have no way to manage mana.
---
They are excellent in group PvP but that’s it. 
---
My sad outlook is that it will start decently.  If I had to guess, maybe 30-40% max vs 60-70% retail.
---
After that, I can imagine a steady decline until just committed players are playing with some dabblers here and there.
---
Then it will level out to about the population of Pserver + 10-15% due to ease of access and a shared sub.
---
I’m no statistics major so these are just the age-old numbers out of my butt.
---
We will have to see how it goes, but I really feel that culture and lifestyles are so different from just 15 years ago that i don’t know if we will see more of a new community or just the older versions of those who played at the time.
---
The whole concept is a wilderness to be explored.  An MMO remake of this scale is so unique.
---
When I have to be yes. Else I'll be a tank.
---
I don't plan on raiding so I don't think the number of times ill be forced to heal will be too high. 
---
Yeah no, just because you know the basics, doesn't mean you should be giving out guides. 
---
You were literally just arguing that's a good thing. So I'm a bit confused if you are arguing that Wrath Gate is hard to get. But hard to get things are bad? So that is a conflict you need to resolve in your argument. But let's be real, we both know that Wrath gate is pretty much handed to you. That is what this whole argument is about.
---
When Classic WoW's concurrent player base (despite having 2005 graphics essentially) surpasses retail, you will see that people prefer a more challenging game and like that they have something to reach for and even something that is more than likely unobtainable to them. I'm not saying the Onyxia attunement quest is unobtainable in anyway. But it asks a lot more of the player than Wrath Gate does. 
---
Totally agree. 
---
I hate that the token was implemented in the main game, but it would have an absolutely catastrophic effect on Classic.
---
Hahaha alright buddy, whatever you say. 
---
I recognize you opposition to a cash shop, but Blizz shouldn’t give up combatting goldseplers and sanction gold buying/selling themselves, they’re on the same level as the gold sellers if they resort to that
---
I didn't say the Wrathgate was hard to get. I said it took time and had a great payoff, *which is what the original post was about in the first place.* It was not handed to you.
---
Your original argument is that Wrath gave everything to you, which is bullshit. I don't want retail. Every expansion since Wrath has been garbage and not worth playing. And the Onyxia quest does not ask more of the player than the Wrathgate did. It's not at all difficult to get attuned for it. If you think it was hard, you obviously didn't do it.
---
Also, Wrathgate was a stepping stone for ICC. If you didn't do it, you didn't fully understand the story for ICC. Plus you missed out on a quest with a good armor drop. Not handed to you.
---
Stop trying to act like the game was immediately shit the day BC came out, because you know it wasn't.
---
I know. I was just memeing. Because Frost Shock was/will be a meme. It's so good.
---
Glowing Brightwood Staff was the first epic I ever equipped. I bought it for my mage at like level 54. Replaced it almost immediately after entering Outlands, dumb purchase.
---
That was in TBC. They did a charity thing IIRC  but I dont remember it being a mount.
---
Yes it was. I have no proof, just anecdotal evidence so take this at face value.
---
If you played Horde and were anything other than Undead (you'd start at neutral with them and friendly with the other factions), you'd automatically get friendly with UC without ever touching their quests. It didn't go higher than this as far as I remember.
---
I wouldn't say they gave up combating gold sellers. They adopted a fight fire with fire method. For every account you ban, three more are opened. It was a plague. You couldn't even roll a new character without getting more than one tell from some enslaved Chinese person trying to sell you gold.
---
I honestly don't think there's any other way to combat it. The most we can do is not use it once implemented. Just the existence deters gold sellers.
---
Go to work 
---
Just because you think that, doesn't mean they can't do whatever they want with their property. You people are as annoying as SJW's.  
---
It trades Chinese gold farmers for a bunch of regular players who obsessively farm gold to play the game for "free". I'm not sure if it makes that much of a difference tbh.
---
I wish I could see the names, fellow Illidanite.  
---
Sincerely, Tural/Harle/Anticen
---
The only good vanilla pserver announced they’re shutting down so where would you play? I’d rather fight for an official authentic vanilla experience by Blizzard than another shady pserver.
---
I loved BC. The game became shit when they released LFD, it was a slow decline to that point as they slowly introduced cancer to the game. I think they made many mistakes in each game, including Vanilla.But I much prefer the style of quests that have you traveling the WHOLE map, even to earlier zones. And look for other people and guildies who are also on the same quest to coordinate and do all the epic quests together. And that is why it feels more epic.
---
The additional ffact that you can say you are attuned and others cannot is cool and good design for an MMO.
---
Glad to hear the Roleplaying talk back!
---
Really? I would have thought you could Trade in cloth or something to get to exalted and grab one. 
---
This was in that kind of "Cycle of Hatred" book vibe era where the likes of Thrall and Jaina wanted to keep things cool between either faction. I mean, as an Alliance member your quests have you killing humans who want to create conflict between Theramore and the Horde.
---
I thought I recalled seeing humans or NEs on mechanostriders but maybe that was during Wrath or I was just dreaming. I am pretty sure that humans could get their hands on rams and cats from BGs though right?
---
Selling things to Paladins and Warlocks... :D
---
&gt; The game became shit when they released LFD
---
No, the game because shit when they made LFD cross realm, which was at Cata's launch. That began the casual creep. Prior to that, you had to be on the same server and do three things in order to have a dungeon available for use in LFD in both regular and heroic:
---
1. Walk there on foot.
---
2. Be in a group that had at least three people who weren't random.
---
3. Clear it the old fashioned way.
---
If you hadn't done those three things, you couldn't queue for that particular dungeon. When the Cata prepatch launched, it removed those requirements and placed an emphasis on playing with people you didn't know-- even giving you a buff for the number of random people. Cata broke LFG. Not Wrath.
---
&gt;I much prefer the style of quests that have you traveling the WHOLE map, even to earlier zones.
---
Also, what part of having to go to other places, like Stormwind/Orgrimmar, STV, Moonglade and Darnassus/Thunder Bluff, just to finish the Wrathgate questline did you miss me saying?
---
&gt;The additional ffact that you can say you are attuned and others cannot is cool and good design for an MMO.
---
Sounds like gatekeeping to me. If you're attuned and someone isn't, help them get attuned.
---
Depends on if classic will be before or after the xp buff.  Super old school it took months to level, but when they went through and removed almost all of the elite quests and doubled the exp rate, 60 was easy peasy.  I'm thinking it happened before BC, but I can't recall exactly when.
---
^^^#JusticeForNewZealandTooooo
---
thats when you kill one or two, and keep running/being extremely hit and go until you get reinforcements or they are so afraid to pull a mob because you will jump them that they leave.
---
Yeah, it’s gimped for sure.
---
Is that the one that rhymes with "Tights Rope"? 
---
Yes you could get your factions other mounts through reputation grind. If you got Exalted with a race then you could get their mounts, however only Gnomes and Dwarfs can ride mechanostriders and Tauren can't ride anything other than Kodo I believe. Humans could ride Rams and Sabres (besides Horses) with the proper reputation grind. Any mount that drops in a dungeon or raid can be used by anyone.
---
This is not true, i play on a pserver and i most certainly twist alot for my melees in the raid throughout the entire raid. 
---
/salute
---
leveled my first 60 in a pve server and played till the end of bwl on that server. I didn't miss much tbh. leveling was a bit easier but still had quite some fan in SV especially in the arena. Xroads was pumped with people, even going there with pvp tag off you'd attack something and you'd get the pvp tag on no matter what. Tyr's hand farming, again you'd see people with pvp tags on, ganging on each other and there was no way you wouldn't join that fun unless you were completely apathetic to the whole thing. After that I switched to a pvp server. Overall not much difference between those 2 apart from being massively ganged outside of raid instances. Other than that most of the things were the same tbh.
---
Not that I know of. The general advice is to go to classic db or vanilla db, look at all the quests that reward rep for a particular faction, and plan your leveling route around that.
---
Unfortunately there isn't an outright guide afaik.
---
I want to play warlock, don't want to play horde, and Human is too basic for me in a fantasy game. So unfortunately, that leaves us with...
---
There is more than one place to quest at. 
---
&gt; trash in the private server community
---
Funny you mention that since that’s exactly what OP is. 
---
"pvp *flagged*"
---
lmaoooooooooooo
---
But how are you gonna kill the horde scum???
---
TCG turtle mount that had no movespeed bonus iirc. 
---
I tested out a few classes. Warlock. Rogue. Mage. Warrior.
---
I like rogue the best. Playing each one to 30 and going back to rogue to 60 and realize that warriors are everywhere stealing your gear but only 1 out of 5 will tank anything lol.
---
What really made me decide on rogue was that you have the least responsibility in a group. It's just more chill for me. I mained a warrior through vanilla and TBC was the MT for a hardcore raiding guild. There were not many breaks for me going through trash, then boss, then trash. Keeping threat and having dps and healers go afk while I have to try hard always because 1 or 2 dps are trying hard. Fond memories but with a rogue I can have a plate of food infront of me and watch Netflix or just have my dick in hand. You put ppl on follow and go take a shit. Come back and trash is still being done.
---
Steal warrior/rogue BiS gear and roleplay as a fury 2h warrior that forgot how to use melee skills. 
---
Restos can twist too. An enhance is still garbage. 
---
Shadow for leveling. You can heal any 5 man even as shadow if you need to. 
---
Who cares?
---
I remember that one time. When nobody cared what faction, race, class and spec you decided on.  
---
It’s right now
---
&gt; A pre-raid fully buffed elemental shaman will have a 9.5k Mana pool 
---
If you only run intellect gear and nothing else on top of wisdom flask instead of SP flask (LOL). In which case you’ll hit like a wet noodle because you aren’t capitalizing on your insane spell power ratios, assuming you even hit since you’ll be at no spellhit running full INT gear. Not to mention a lack of curse reducing nature resist. 
---
You got so much wrong in your post on top of that don’t even know where to start. You’re spreading complete misinformation. 
---
Only dwarf and gnome were able to ride it. 
---
Broken pserver coefficients are one hell of a drug. 
---
Had to become exalted with that races home city to be able to buy the mount. Cloth turn ins 
---
&gt; Prior to that, .. old fashioned way.
---
I disagree with that whole section being sufficient. You should have to go to the dungeon with your group every time - or have a warlock. I didn't really like the meeting stones much at all either before you bring them up.
---
&gt; Sounds like gatekeeping to me. If you're attuned and someone isn't, help them get attuned.
---
I'm not saying rub it in their face and not help them if they need it. You are really trying to paint me in an awful picture on purpose and I don't appreciate it. Typically you are always helping people because that aligns with your needs because you need 40 people to do Onyxia. The more people on the server who can do it the better. But not everyone on the server will choose to do it, and that will make it special. If that sounds like gatekeeping then IDK man. I don't think it is, but if you do then you do. That's what Classic is - maybe you won't like it? I'm sorry if you don't because for all its flaws its an amazing game and community.
---
&gt;Stormwind/Orgrimmar, STV, Moonglade and Darnassus/Thunder Bluff, 
---
[Those are not nearly the same challenge as elites Winterspring named dragon, UBRS, BRD etc.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YipSkO1AME8) 
---
Do fishing, especially the pools. A lot of fish like Oily Blackfin, Firefin, etc, are in high demand for skill ups and consumes.
---
If they have any form of cash shop or wow tokens or anything even remotely like that in classic wow. I will unsub, uninstall bnet, and never buy from blizzard or activation for the rest of my life.
---
This is not a negotiation. Don't fuck this up.
---
I started on a PVP server then switched to a PVE server when I got older. If you have a ton of time, PVP is good because you can have world interactions. The flip side is if you start the grind after the server has been established, you will be ganked into oblivion by every dingleberry who thinks he's hot shit for being able to one-shot someone 40 levels lower than he is. I recommend PVE if you don't have a lot of time and want to be productive during questing and leveling. Even on PVE servers you can still do battlegrounds if you want to PVP.
---
There is actually a semi meta destro build for pvp similar to that https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0w0RbZZVx0tMbtt , its not bad by any means but it requires much more gear than you would generally want in a dungeon farming spec. At low gear levels Shadow wrath gear and gear like https://classicdb.ch/?item=14136 you are really missing out on quite a bit of dps that could be better spent casting SB's 
---
&gt;You should have to go to the dungeon with your group every time - or have a warlock.
---
I've got shit to do.
---
&gt; I didn't really like the meeting stones much at all either before you bring them up.
---
Sounds *especially* convenient for you and the sake of your argument.
---

---
Wrath perfected the original idea. Vanilla was ok. I'm only supportive of Classic in the hopes we get a Wrath Classic.
---
We already know classic is 1.12
---
You got the mounts and some other items if you collected the warcraft card game. There was a chance in the booster packs to get special cards that had the codes for the in game items on them. The vendor was in booty bay
---
My name was Legnolupo. I can't remember this mages name
---
Nice, I’m the same way. Always been horde but I think friends and I will roll Alli this time around. 29/39 are good brackets. I’ll be in 19/29 mainly (: enjoy 
---
Will be concurrently levelling via rested exp abuse:
---
1. Orc female / UD female rogue
---
2. troll male hunter 
---
Rogue is my main, hunter is for money/screwing around. 
---
\*violently changes\*
---
Removal of elite quests and buffing quest xp was not in 1.12 
---
I leveled a priest as disc and really enjoyed it....
---
I used to play wow on a potato back then and had to set the graphics pretty low to have decent frame rate. Playing in a pserver now with modern laptop on full graphics feels amazing to me. I’m actually surprised how good everything looks, especially the weather effects. The rain really feels like a down pour with water droplets hitting ground all over the place. I guess the experience is different depending where you are coming from, but give it a try and you may like it. 
---
Neither does anyone else. But we're all playing by the same rules!
---
That's why it's still fun. On a PvE server, you're going to have less set-backs and so will everyone else, and so you will still be relatively underpowered, in terms of your progression. What you should decide on is what type of gameplay you want, PvP or PvE. I can understand if you don't like PvP from a gameplay point of view, but the idea that you don't "have as much time as you used to" isn't really the best argument, in my opinion.
---
yup, you can get nelf cats and dwarf rams as a human through rep (or r11 pvp mounts).
---
All good...not in disagreement.
---
Oh you don't like the game. That makes sense now.
---
At level 25 you should be 5/0/11. The 5 points in wand spec is fantastic for a bunch of levels. There are levels in the early 10s and mid 20s where SW:P + wand is the best dps rotation. 
---
Then the choice is up to you, really. Shadow levels the easiest -- and priest are viable healers when leveling right out-of-the-box.
---
I like it enough to let everybody participate, unlike you.
---
I remember one-shooting someone at around ~38 in Arathi Highlands with my Corpse-Maker.
---
Yup low polygons suck. 
---
Why didn't you melee at all? rofl
---
A smart Hunter always has a freezing trap at his feet while leveling, good luck on the opener.
---
Holy spec is optimal for leveling speed before level 45 or so. Check out my [priest leveling guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/).
---
That's Max id think. I bet at least 200k just from private server scene. Maybe 1million tourists, at least for a month. Plenty of people coming back from 10 years ago after seeing the announcement - 30-100k.   
---
I think half a million is optimistic and realistic, I can only hope it outshines our expectations
---
How would you be underpowered in terms of your progression by not getting interrupted when you just want to quest and chill?
---
I've played on 5 different private servers now, and the awesome world pvp people are always talking about is really people ganking lowbies, and they're disproportionately rogues, druids, or hunters.   
---
I played on a pve server up through WotLC back on live, then played on a pvp server with friends for MoP expansion.  Everyone who was serious about pvp spent 99% of their pvp time in battlegrounds because you actually got rewards for it. I did a fair amount of battleground pvp when I was on a pve server.  I enjoy being able to separate the two.  
---
There's also this thing called a battleground where you and your buddies can test your might against a group of players who are the same level as you....but I don't think that's really what people like about pvp servers. 
---
Call me a casual. Call me a noob. call me whatever. It’s PVE for me. Something about being one shot by a max level character and being unable to enjoy what little time i have to play games is unappealing. 
---
That was true for all clases, at that lvl if a hunters sees you first you are pretty much dead.
---
Best way to get through STV is group questing, and ideally starting at an above average level (say 35).
---
That is not the case, this is from testing on my own server. Elemental in naxx gear can do 800-900dps sustained for 5+ mins. Chain lighting and Max rank spells are more valuable then SP. Your brain dead if you think SP and forcing yourself to downrank for a long fight is better.
---
Trial traps length? 
---
Cool group of dudes, got a steady base of people so far.
---
How about make new content or hell go another expansion route this time... I think it could be interesting to go emerald nightmare  that would get alot of people playing again. Although that's wishful thinking and we will probably just get a cash shop
---
&gt;How would you be underpowered in terms of your progression
---
Because everyone else is *also* not interrupted, so they will also be able to level faster, farm gold faster, and get gear faster. So, compared to "your server", you're still going to be *relatively* powerful based on how much time you put in to the game. On a PvP server, your leveling experience will slow down because of PvP, but so will everyone else's, so it's not like everyone else is getting more powerful faster than you are, because it's not just you who's getting ganked.
---
 
---
So, what I'm getting at is that on a PvP server, everyone else is slowed down in the leveling process, and progression in general, and so if you're good at world PvP, you will have an advantage over others.
---
Yeah I get the idea of questing and chilling, totally. But on a PvE server, get ready for everyone to level very quickly. All I'm saying is it evens out, in a sense... so, as you indicated by saying you just want to quest and chill, choose based on the gameplay you want.
---
I love healing in open world PvP, and getting ganked, and ganking others. I love the rush, even though I play a squishy priest... it's just what I love... I just want to have that challenge, and take part in the faction-based dynamics of PvP servers.
---
That's basically exactly what I'm doing, except I will go orc. 
---
I'm still debating Wether or not to focus enhance or ele as I would really love to get a hand of rag as well lol and totem twisting seems cool. ele just seems easier to gear and more versatile as you can share items with resto. 
---
I'm still really conflicted, I don't think I will decide until I hit ~lvl 55
---
I remember my first time crossing into a pvp zone well before I was ready. Well before I was ready...corpse camping with another guy chilling at the nearest graveyard. Was a long night.
---
oh god plz stop
---
These posts lol
---
Them God damn infernos man
---
Spirit tap and wand spec first. The rest doesn't matter.
---
"Carebear" was the term I heard used most often.
---
In fantasy unicorn world where Blizzard could just wave a magic fairy wand and make gold sellers vanish, I would be against tokens.
---
In the real world where that has been tried for well over a decade and has absolutely never, ever worked? I think you have to be delusional or ignorant to think that policing real money trading is suddenly going to start working in Classic when it has never, ever worked before.
---
The only difference between tokens and RMT is that people can pretend RMT isn't happening.
---
It sounds like crybabies are your bread and butter.  Why wouldn't you want them around?
---
Same.
---
F
---
Male\* orc rogues look like hell.
---
Tbh if you dont plan on raiding then druid is an awesome class. You can reliably fulfill all 3 roles while lvling and most ppl wont give you any shit.
---
Im genuinely happy for you because i can fully appreciate the OCD for choosing a new toon.
---
Constructive criticism on your build, pick either kitty or bear. For example, take the 5 out of thick hide and put it into feral aggression for ferocious bite. Get rid of primal frenzy and get one extra in brutal impact and feline swiftness. For bear you'd want feral instinct for threat and thick hide.
---
For kitty you need a low level blue helm and to powershift frequently for energy.. so for top feral dps its quite a busted mechanic. You'll likely find yourself resto as many mention for raids but for dungeons kitty/bear are fine.
---
Overall super fun and flexible class to level, myself personally will be skipping hybrids this time round haha. You will def be a minority, so highly in demand for buffs and battle rez alone.
---
I think you're conflating skill cap and skill ceiling.  Skill cap is the amount of skill needed to get into the top levels of game play.  Skill ceiling is the maximum output a highly skilled player can achieve.  
---
Also, don't be a dick.
---
This brought me feels.
---
The general population and common sense disagrees. People openly discussing a movie or game outcome from 15 years ago is entirely different from people discussing the spoilers of a recent movie in public. You would have to be an idiot or willfully ignorant to argue otherwise.
---
wtf would a pvp guild want with anything but an ele shaman?
---
When I first started playing wow I rolled a human warrior named Trigor and I had a ton of fun.
---
I quit for a few years after wrath but when I came back for legion I joined a new server and rolled a Paladin named Trigor. In my head it was fun to roleplay that same character who had spent years training to now become a paladin.
---
For classic I'm going to roll an undead warrior named Trigor. Alternate world... alternate fate for my warrior. 
---
Removed. Post in the LFG thread.
---
&gt; **PVE**
---
* **Enhancement**
---
Pretty garbage. You are a gimped warrior that can only autoattack. You go oom way too fast if you use shocks. Your only utility is Nightfall and totems, and enhances have the worst NF uptime while providing the same totems as Resto shamans. The improved WF totem deep down the enhance tree amounts to a whopping 9-10 STR.
---
You can twist totems but so can resto shamans, and they provide heals instead of the negative DPS enhance provides.
---
* **Elemental**
---
Elemental has potential to have the highest burst damage in both PVE and PVP, but it's only that, a potential. All of this comes from their talents, which reduce Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning's cast times by 1s, from 3s to 2s. This is *huge*, as the spell damage coefficient of spells is based on the base casting time. They get 3s coefficient on 2s spells and are the only casters in the game to get that, as mages/locks only get 0.5s reduced cast time.
---
Elementals are hindered by two huge hurdles. Nature resist and mana issues.  
---
Other casters have access to curses that drastically reduce a mob's elemental resistance to arcane/fire/shadow but there is no equivalent for nature spells. Bosses also tend to have a higher nature resistance, which hurts DPS even more. There's items that reduce a mob's resistance to your spells in AQ/Naxx, but using those instead of the BiS items means you're reducing your damage compared to other casters in order to get over this hurdle. The other issue is mana regen, which is pretty big. This can be somewhat fixed by downranking as you still get to use the ridiculous spell power coefficients with rank 4 and up Lightning Bolt, at the cost of base damage. You have class-specific means of getting mana back. Warlocks get life tap, mages get gems/evocation/mage armor. You get mana totem, but the other casters also get it so it's not an advantage at all. You could meme around and innervate/PI the shaman, but that's not how you fix fundamental class issues.
---
There's also a minor issue to ele shammies in raids in that they have 0 raid utility that resto shamans don't bring. This was fixed in TBC with the introduction of the caster totem, Totem of Wrath, but we're talking about Classic, not TBC.
---
TL;DR Elementals could do ridiculous DPS if PVE nature resist wasn't so high and even then, only if fights lasted 30s.
---
* **Restoration**
---
The PVE spec, as the DPS specs are a joke more than anything. Everyone and their mother wants shamans in their raids and are actively recruiting for more and more of them. Unlike paladins buffs, shaman totems are *group-wide*, which means ideal horde raid comps have 5-6+ shamans spread around the groups. You want shamans in your melee groups for Windfury and you want shamans in your caster groups for Tranquil Air (reduces threat by 20%). You also might want shamans in your healer group for Mana Tide if that's your thing. Shamans can't snipe heal for shit because Lesser Healing Wave is an "oh shit" button, but they are great main tank healers with Healing Wave and #1 raid healers with Chain Heal(Rank 1) spam. They also require a fair bit of skill to play since you need to keep track of your totems in order to maximize your group's output. Even moreso if you're totem twisting.
---
More on totem twisting: Windfury totem pulses every 10s and gives a 10s Windfury buff on everyone in your group in range. It also pulses when it is dropped. Totem twisting is placing down Windfury then instantly plopping down Grace of Air/Tranquil Air (AGI/Threat reduction) totem so your melees get both Windfury and more AGI or threat reduction at the same time. You have roughly the time to do 2 chain heals in between totem casts. This increases DPS substantially. There's no point in twisting outside of melee groups because non-melees don't benefit from the temporary WF buff.
---
PVE TL;DR: Enhance is garbage, Elemental would be good if nature resist and its mana issues didn't exist. Restoration is amazing tank/raid healer and everyone wants one.
---
&gt; **PVP**
---
Admittedly, I know very little about shaman PVP as I've never faced them, playing horde.
---
RNG spec. You can get lucky and eat up warriors if you're lucky or you can get mauled by anyone and everyone. More gear is always better so you rely a bit less on RNG to 1-shot those squishies since you have more raw damage. Totems are your friend to avoid fears/spells. Purge is your friend against casters. Dispel those blessings/shields/HoTs/Soul Link/whatever else. Expect to be kited into oblivion by hunters.
---
Ridiculously strong in PVP. They don't rely on RNG but instead will straight up murder you due to the coefficient scaling I mentioned in the PVE section. Their weakness is melees since there's no way to get them out of your face outside of scaring them off with a shock+NS--&gt;LB that shaves 70% of their HP. They're very strong vs casters because of grounding totems+purge making most of the enemy casters' defensive options useless. Also Windfury totem is a thing, so now your warriors can also burst even harder. 30/0/21 is an amazing spec. Nature's Swiftness is always useful to have. As a shaman, you are an offensive healer. I don't know much about shammies in premades but AFAIK, shamans are run as elemental and will heal/purge while waiting for the right time to unleash their burst.
---
A good defense is a good offense. By running restoration, you are giving up your only defensive tool which is your damage. You gain nothing from going deep resto that you'd need if you were 30/0/21. Mana Tide is going to get killed right away in a PVP environment unless you're all the way in the back, and even then it would only be useful in a prolonged engagement. You should note that the last 5 talent points (points 26 to 30) in the elemental tree are the most important in the game, as they're what makes your Lightning Bolt go from 3s to 2s cast time (and CL from 2.5 to 1.5). Without those, your offensive ability (which is key, as an offensive healer) is extremely hurt.
---
PVP TL;DR Enhance is an RNG spec, Elemental will melt faces, Restoration is a bad idea.
---
People sleep pretty hard on fishing. Its more lucrative than many realize.
---
A thought I have is, what if they fix the scaling for hunters? Make abilities like arcane shot scale with agility it something. This is where I'd be okay with \#somechanges
---
&gt; Elemental in naxx gear can do 800-900dps sustained for 5+ mins.
---
On a dummy with 0 nature resist. Try that on an actual naxx boss in an actual raid. I can hit 1k dps as a melee Nightfall hunter on a test server if I stack enough buffs and run full melee hunter BIS. It doesn't mean it's not garbage.
---
&gt; Your brain dead if you think 
---
You're actually recommending edgemasters (with a 2h weapon nonetheless, LOL) as an elemental shaman and abusing broken pserver spell coefficients on magma totem that never happened in actual Vanilla.
---
You should've stopped posting while you were ahead.
---
They promised a BETA at blizzcon three months before release. 
---
&gt; I believe that Activision has little more than a board of people and shareholders putting the pressure on Blizzard to “make more money”. That’s it. No creative direction-ing.
---
Honestly, the two companies are one at this point.  Blizzard is just as much of the issue at this point, but i hope they keep true to classic and just make it about the sub.
---
Honestly i dont know that they have to do more than that.  The development schedule should be minimal going forward (at least for a couple years, until they decide if theyre going to keep going with it, make new content, etc)
---
Oh that's neat. Then it will be very hard.to reproduce lol
---
Fun part was after level 30ish, groups of low levels could get together and counter gank the 60s. I have a few fond memories of being in the 30-45 range of us lowbies forming a group to protect ourselves against higher level players.
---
Nothing wrong with that. Everyone has their preferred method of playing the game.
---
Exactly! 
---
Thanks for the input.
---
I am excited to have fun being a bit of jack of all trades
---
especially prevalent in this sub
---
*I finally picked my toon*
---
Good for you!
---
*Alliance*
---
Miserable cur.
---
Love it. Everytime you get into a new pvp zone you are very low compared to most leveling there, you really can feel that you get stronger every level, the others get less of a threat the more you progress. If the server is populated you’ll often have little scrims with 2-4 people, when you see someone getting ganked f.e
---
More pointedly people should only be rolling their toons on PVE. It's wrongly assumed PVP servers had exclusive world PVP. In fact PVE servers had just as much fighting in world as the PVP servers. The difference is that fighting happened when all players agreed, not when one player saw an opportunity to grief someone. 
---
PVP servers exist for one reason, feeding troll gold farmers. 
---
see, ive tried to play pvp servers, especially on private servers, but i just cant get it. i literally cant find the fun. every time im ganked it makes me want to quit. its a frustration that i jsut dont want to deal with when leveling, the danger just makes it so i dont even want to level. 
---
Its rad that people find it fun, but i just do not understand the enjoyment
---
Just make sure you get wand spec, spirit tap and imp shadow word pain. 
---
Once in the 30s i like mind flay but it isnt necessary.
---
I’m that. 
---
I always had my T2 hunter on stand by at nesingwary incase some skull lvl started camping my alt during lvling, good times.
---
Rank 11 mounts didn't require the faction rep requirements but were still restricted. by race. Humans could get the Horse, Cat or Ram for example.
---
Tightrope has indeed announced they will be shutting down when Classic drops, but iirc their announcement was phrased in a very open-ended fashion for fear of classic being fucked up.
---
Don't worry, if Blizzard trolls us then all it means is that the private servers will have more accurate numbers to pull from.
---
Mindflays dpm isn't too awesome til lvl44 rank. I will probably Respec from tri-spec to shadow, but we will see. I might stay smite priest to keep dungeons a breeze.
---
Flag yourself. Instant excitement.
---
Betas don't exist anymore. Just demos and paid early access that are called betas. 
---
Please, my penis can only get so erect!
---
You typed all this and no upvote? Lol have mine good job.
---
Male or female
---
Look for one of tipsout's The videos on the fucking topic. The guy is desperate for content. 
---
Leveling as holy spec is horrible. I absolutely do not recommend it.
---
I've heard that disc is okay but I've personally never tried it.
---
[This](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-priest/) is the guide that I followed while leveling my Priest.
---
You should have no problems healing as shadow.    
---
From L40 onwards you'll probably need to carry a +spirit set.    
---
(No harm in starting to build a set earlier.)
---
I did up to and including BRD as shadow before I finally respected to Holy at like 80% into 59 when I'd just about run out of quests to do outside of instances.
---
Yep, i was the MT in wotlk and whenever i go afk for bathroom or w/e, people rage.
---
I’m rolling mage in classic. Mindless rotation and you can essentially half afk.
---
Hunter is best though, afk auto shooting is the best. But now damage meter is a thing.
---
The fundamental issue with this is that eventually you won't have the population to run all the raids.
---
Imagine being stuck farming fire damage gear on tier 6 while the majority is farming tier 8 and 9 or trying to gear up an alt over 7 tiers just to get to the current and relevant content.
---
Increasing the level cap is a good way to ensure a decent population for current or previous raid tier. It's also a good way of preventing people from leveling alts with every profession and certain mechanics / abilities that is specific to a certain class, thus incetivizing people to rely more on friends, guild members and other players in the world. 
---
I love TBC, but abandoning Azeroth for years was a huge mistake in my opinion. Reducing it from a huge living breathing world to a oversized questhub still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
---
I wish that instead of releasing outland they would evolve Azeroth over time. Raiding Onyxia for months only for her to still be alive years later doesn't give any closure. In my opinion after a certain amount of time, when the Onyxia raid is outdated and we are faced with new content, we should see what all our efforts turned into. Her cave entrance should be sealed off, the quest lines should change (maybe fighting her remnants?), her skull should permanently be on a huge pole in Orgrimmar. Maybe the seal to her cave could be opened by some of her followers so we'd have to go there again at a later point to finish them too.
---
If Outlands ended up happening it should be shut after we defeated the content. Maybe we could have access to it through the caverns of time, but similar to Azeroth it would just be a huge empty world without relevant content.
---
New zones and locations are good, abandoning them when it's no longer relevant is really, really bad.
---
Druids are pretty good in the 39 bracket because they have travel form and you can't get mounts yet.
---
Yep. I'll be buying ALL the shit.
---
Be warned tho. I'll be selling it back to you for double a month later. ;)
---
IF they decide to naturally let the classic legacy server progress through BC/Wotlk, I imagine this will at some point become the main game and they’ll discontinue new projects from the timeline now. All good things come to an end and eventually Blizz (and the casual player base) will realize it’s better to replay/repeat the good times than it is to keep putting out expansions we just simply aren’t enjoying. Won’t happen over night, maybe not in the next 2-3 years even. But eventually wow will only be alive because of their legacy servers, not new updates/expansions. Hope this was applicable here!! Cheers 
---
I loved playing 29 ret pally with Cobalt Crusher, lots of burst.
---
Also, 29 affliction lock is fun, nightfall procs give nice shadowbolts ontop of dotting while staying mobile. They also hit hard at that level.
---
If you really think about it, That’s probably why they’re finally agreeing to do it now in the first place. They know it’s going to replace any new projects they could possibly come up with. Plus it’s a steal, how often are normal businesses and companies begged to resell old content/merchandise. 
---
People who gonna pick pink hair will never going to get it to level 60 PepeHands 
---
Kinda doesnt seem like he needed to
---
As a vanilla beta player and someone who had over 200 days played pre-bc on my main, go into stv knowing you're going to be fighting.  Attack people, and learn to world pvp.  It's like a pvp training ground.  It's such a blast!  If you aren't used to pvp, don't worry, just try to have fun and get better at it.  
---
Also, if you go hard on release, you can really quickly get a huge advantage over other players in terms of being in places with less competition.  I'll be taking that week off and playing a LOT.  When I'm in stv, I assume there'll only be something like 10 people in the zone, and that's pretty reassuring since pvp doesn't give exp.  No time for that!
---
... Shit
---
I think people are too quick to assume that happens all the time.  I've played since vanilla beta and tbh, that has not happened often.  It happens for sure, but not enough to ruin the entire game in my experience.  However, not having a lot of time to play and not wanting to pvp in that time is understandable.  I however, love world pvp and trying to beat someone higher level, or getting ganked by someone for fighting and chasing them down to kill them, or trying to have a fair fight with them to show you can beat them, is really gratifying when you manage to beat them.  I like the added challenge.  Breaks up the grind.
---
Zaza v.  
---
FYI: It's possible to hit Exalted with most factions without doing the cloth turn ins if you plan your questing route well.
---
Usually by around L45. But it depends on your starting race and the race that you're trying to get exalted with.
---
It just makes the world come alive more. 
---
I don't think there are limitations on mounts. You just need the reputation or have bought the mount before a certain patch by an other player and traded to you
---
To be fair Hearthstone was fairly innovative and sparked life back into the Online Card came category
---
If someone could drop the hard math for resistance on me, I would be thrilled. 
---
I like fire mage. I like fire okay, and I like damage. I played Bright Wizard later in Warhammer Online and that was the shit, so so much fun with burning everything. 
---
Too bad that in Vanilla it's frost for PvP/PvE and fucking frostbolt bot 24/7 through all content until AQ. You just sit there along for the ride and press your button. The very early vanilla itemization was also completely scuffed, and physical damage was king. And it still kinda is. So I just had to watch warriors have all the fun in the world come endgame while I still just had my frostbolt button.
---
This is why I am going Warrior in Vanilla. I've been playing on a pt server and I feel so at home being the tank. I control the CC, I control the damage, I control the tempo. Gotta love it. Its I aim to be The boss hoss tank of the server, and hopefully I can get a spot as MT for a progression guild. 
---
I would also quit. This is a no go.
---
This is not debatable. 
---
Might as well play a on pserver.
---
I hate all professions due to the lack of incentive but I’ve always found fishing to be therapeutic. When you’re fishing and look over and see someone else fishing It does always inspire me to spark a convo. To the point, I oddly agree with this lol. 
---
U could also just macro it or download a AddOn that lets u know when u caught something which is comoletely legal.
---
&gt; I'm not sure if it makes that much of a difference tbh.
---
The difference is in how many times per hour you are willing to /ignore random toons that whisper you to offer their gold sales.  
---
People who buy tokens are not whispering to everyone to set deals.
---
The Everquest version of wow tokens fucks the economy of every single progression server they run.
---
Please learn from their mistake Blizzard. 
---
Poetic af.
---
Before BC came out I vividly remember questing in Hillsbrad Foothills when some 60 Alliance Warrior came in ganking. Every Hordie in the whole zone banded together to try and kill the fucker, bait him into guards, you name it. He wasn't a complete noob and we all died a dozen times.
---
Eventually we got his ass right outside TM and it's a classic moment I'll keep forever. So much adrenaline. 
---
It's adrenaline. It's addicting. Pre-trammel Ultima Online got me addicted the that feeling, and I long for it in every MMO I've ever played. The fear/fun ratio just gets its hooks into you.
---
We all know saruman was the one to die
---
Prot warriors could get away sometimes. Pop your Last Stand and spam shield block like hell.
---
well, allow me to say what that little voice in the back of your head is thinking:
---
*wouldn't the heart of the wild spec be better?*
---
Is this your safe-space? You want me to cone you off a perimeter or will you be more comfortable just barricading yourself in for the duration?
---
Just don't steal the paladin's Zin'rokh.
---
That was a good read.
---
To be fair, paladins are the braindead 1-button heal spam class. Shamans have to always keep check of their totems so that they're in range of their group, even moreso if they're totem twisting (aka using 2 gcds every 10 seconds to put down totems). 
---
You have chosen poorly alliance scum. 
---
Exactly what I assume as well. Creating some tbc servers for the people who wanna progress.
---
[priest tri-spec?](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxzGs0bZbhtZVMGdcp) (you can move a few points around)
---
not as awesome damage as shadow, but ridiculous utility.
---
Holy is great after Wand and Spirit Tap and before Shadow Form. I wouldnt do it on a PvP server but it's viable. It's much better than disc. 
---
Two corrections in the above posts:
---
1) there are restrictions
---
2) Tauren can ride kodos and wolves
---
This doesn't help, as you prefer using the sound, but if you didn't know, they will be using the modern fishing mouse over cursor in Classic
---
I'll have to look that up since that sounds new to me
---
for elemental/resto, go orc. even for enhancement, orc is a solid choice.
---
why? taurens (should) have a bigger a hitbox, you can hit enemies that are 7-8 yards away instead of the standard 5 yards melee range, *but* you can also be hit that much farther away, which is absolutely shitty if you're a caster. nice if you're melee, but it would still somewhat shoehorn you into a single role.
---
Are you basing that on Vanilla numbers or Private server numbers.
---
Plus it gives you a reason to hang out in Azshara!
---
Yeah until blizzard shuts it down.
---
you are, indeed, gimping yourself, not because of anything oblivious, but because of a hidden racial. unless they're changing it, taurens have a bigger hitbox than other races, you can hit in melee farther away and also be hit from farther away... which IIRC absolutely fucks hunters up, since they have a deadzone that suddenly becomes weird as fuck - instead of 5-8 yards, it's something like 8-11 yards, so you need to be even farther away to shoot.
---
so... I'd stay the hell away from taurens when it comes to hunter. they do make for excellent warriors, though.
---
They should be far more strict on people buying gold who have far less disposable accounts and characters then.
---
Does lock threat ever become less of an issue in AQ or naxx? I remember it being a huge deal up through ZG on private servers. Pretty frustrating to deal with. You almost were frustrated that you criticize because you’d need to stop casting for 5 seconds. 
---
The area in which Onyxia and her brood lives was a big ogre mount alike to Lock Modan. They were driven out and the new village is a mere refugee camp.

There is one questline and a elite killquest concerning their former domicile:

Does Imp Shadow Word pain really Tick to the end for most of the Mobs? 
---
You forgot those other 90% of fights where you get crushed while hitting like a squirrel.
---
Why should I stop? In a single-player game, you can do whatever, I don't care. But in an MMO features affect me even if I opt out. A really extreme example is exploits or RMT. I'd never use either but does that mean I shouldn't say anything if others are using those?
---
That is not how an MMO works. In a single-player game, sure. But the way other players play affect me. 
---
For example if I join a queue for a BG because I want to bash peoples heads in, then find out half of my team is AFK because that is the best way to get rep or honor, then I can't really get mad at them, can I? Yet I can't enjoy the game because of them.
---
Another point is PvP gearing. I can opt out of farming honor, but most PvPers wont. As a result, they will have better gear and will stomp me, removing the chance of a skillful and engaging battle. Now what is the retort for that? Stop ruining the game with my casual attitude. This essentially once again means that the way others play affect me, and the way I'd like to play affect others.
---
I mean, isn't this the WHOLE POINT of classic? Eliminating certain features from the game that ruined the social aspect? I can opt out of LFG tool in retail, but if everyone is using that, do I really have the choice not to use it?
---
You could achieve this without disincentiving regular wPvP. 
---
NOOOOOOOOOOO now I don't know haha.
---

---
See you on the battlefield

i dont even try to go there to quest wast of time

Cash shops killed mmos. A cash shop will kill classic in the womb.
---
just to clarify this (/u/cotteneyemoe is correct, just putting more detail to it) -- the first / base set of the wow tcg was released in October 2006, during vanilla.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_Trading_Card_Game#Sets_released
---
The only loot cards from the base set were for the Tabard of Flame, the Hippogryph Hatchling, and the Riding Turtle.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_loot_cards#Heroes_of_Azeroth
---
The Spectral Tiger(s) that many people remember was a loot card from *Fires of Outland* expansion set, which was released in August 2007, during TBC.
---
You have some extremely severe TDS there, bud. I would ponder life for a bit, turn off the TV and maybe try to socialize with people IRL. Good luck to you! 
---
It is better to do green/yellow quests than orange/red ones, especially on a PvP server. As a result, you will most likely clear both the Darnassus and Stormwind zones.
---
For example with my druid I first did all quests in Teldrassil, went to Darkshore at 11, got 1-2 levels, went to Elwyn, done some quests there, went to Westfall, got to 16 there, went back to Darkshore, then a bit of Duskwood, then a few quests in Redridge (I mostly skipped that due to ganking)
---
Then some Ashenvale, StoneTalon because Duskwood was too high for me, then some Wetlands.
---
As a result I am honored with SW but also revered with Darnassus.
---
This is on a blizz-like pserver but rep rates could be faulty of course.
---
Does your max range increase as well? Wouldn't that balance it out, in theory?
---
Happy to have you 
---
All zones have WPvP provided they’re disputed territories. Some good questing zones that will have a decent share of WPvP are Shimmering Flats, Hillsbrad, EPL, Ashenvale, along with STV and Burning Steppes. Post-levelling once patch 1.9 is out and the AQ war effort begins Silithus is gonna be a great place for WPvP, plus the strategic advantage of slowing down the enemy faction’s farming and ensuring your faction has the prestige of server first SL.

Sometimes I get the feeling that people who are anti-token might actually be goldfarmers themselves. That they are opposed to tokens because it hurts their bottom line.
---
What about the visual queue?
---
Straglethorn Vale is the first territory where you'll encounter players from the enemy faction and its gonna be intense. SS-TM Wpvp tends to be "endgame" content and also horde is lower level there so its not really fun, but STV and onwards it gets serious business.
---
80-85%/15-20%
---
Current private server databases are fairly accurate. Most are not using the messed up back ported TBC database that several were using a few years ago.
---
But feel free to double check [classic.wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com) instead of [vanillawowdb](https://vanillawowdb.com), [classicdb](http://classicdb.ch) or [twinhead](http://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz) if it'd help you sleep better.
---
Definitely agree with this. Would be a nice qol change if they made it to where you didn’t hear other people’s bobbers while your line was cast. 
---
If I’m doing a fishing grind I’m typically watching tv and rely on the sound to look over.
---
The game literally does this for you on purpose it's pretty awesome.  Major quest lines lead you to heavy wpvp areas and/or dual faction quest hubs.   It's much more difficult to avoid wpvp areas while leveling.
---
My guess is they are mostly poor and young, and really resent the idea that someone could "get ahead" of them by spending real-world money. Which I kind of understand, if I was a kid and I farmed until I hated my life to get gold for an epic mount I would want everyone else to suffer just as much as me to get one.  The idea that a grown-up could get exactly the same thing just by handing over some money of which they have plenty could well piss me off.
---
I don't think that feeling of resentment is misguided, which is why if I had a magical fairy wand to wave to make RMT go away I would wave it.
---
But in the real world where we don't have that wand, tokens are clearly the lesser evil compared to other forms of RMT.
---
The large scale ganking in STV is more of a pserver thing though and the result of their overpopulation. In actual Vanilla STV generally was also the first zone where you would be introduced to wpvp but never on the scale of how it happens on pservers. 
---
as far as I know, nope. it only has straight up downsides.
---
but even if the max range increased... you want to shoot at things. melee really doesn't want to be shot at and most are rather good at closing the distance, so can't shoot at them. you really don't want to melee things, but with a tauren, you'd be forced into it a lot more.
---
so, either way, it's a disadvantage, and not a minor one. (at least as far as pvp is concerned)
---
[Here's a pretty good guide for leveling as Holy](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/)

I can one up this.
---
What class is best for grinding gold? DOESN'T MATTER!
---
Just get RARE DROPS ya dinguses! RARE DROPS! I'm talking about *EPIC*, *WORLD*, ***RARE DROPS***!
---
Why waste HOURS when you can just get a RARE DROP! hahaha, dumbdumbs can't even get the rare drop hahahah xD
---
The whole point of Classic is to recreate pre-TBC WoW. The Honor system and BGs were introduced early on in WoW's lifecycle. If you don't like it, get in line with the people that dont want Warlocks to have Death Coil as a skill.
---
I dont get it... your the one that made this post. Who are you arguing with?
---
And just my 2 cents. People are gonna do what makes them happy. If that's be a pro star in a game that's fine by me. Sure as well beats the fast and the furious Dbags ripping around at 3am. And you can probabaly save for retirement and avoid debt with wow.

For your health!

current 90/10 classic

Pretty sure that was in 2.4.3. I'm not 100% sure it was that late, but it was definitely in tbc and not vanilla
---
any good shadow priest is just going to dot you up then LoS the shit out of you, and maybe mind flay when you get closer and try to get a hit in, since that doesn't care about LoS and makes it hard to escape. 
---
also, most people aren't all that good at judging distance *that* accurately, and even if they are, most engagements doesn't happen at max range - if a shadow priest gets the opener, they're just gonna sit on your face and fry you.
---
&gt;My honest opinion is that a year after classic drops. Retail won't exist as a game. 
---
Retail is one average expansion away from recapturing most of its current base back tbh. Idk why you think it would ever die. 
---
Classic is too time consuming in relation to ever fully replace it.
---
rogues I can get though, fuckers can pump out a surprising amount of damage if they can open on you, and good ones will seriously chew you up.
---
hunters... iirc they're just annoying, trying to dance out of range and draining your mana, then quickly dying when the priest gets closer.

I think it was implemented around the same time that they made level cap experience rewards give gold.

Are you sure?

Yes, no gold sales in classic wow. It'll interfere with my Copper and Peacebloom Cartel that I am organizing. ;)
---
Yup :)
---
Yeah it's long. And awkward to navigate I now realise. Maybe I should just put it on one page

I mean if they fuck this up there wont be much of a fan base left other than hearthstone players. they've killed retail, hots and overwatch is in 'balance purgatory' so it could go either way but i know where id put my money.

Look at this scrub, killing things for gold.

Dance in the goldshire inn if you want top gold.

Those are some of the most contested zones. You're bound to fight a lot of players of the enemy faction there.
---
You can apply that same logic to oh so many issues in real life. The effectiveness of policing isn't a reason to stop policing and just legalise it.
---
This may come as a shock but some people actually enjoy grinding.
---
The one that rhymes with Valeesium is still golden though, is it not?
---
everyone has their priorities. i would not be able to play on a pve server. would be too boring for me.
---
I just kinda hope they use the same realm names as before so the low pop realms will be avoided and high pop realms will be where everyone joins
---
To be fair, Heroes of the Storm ragdoll physics in Battlegrounds would probably be hilarious for at least 30 minutes.

Don't you guys have money? /s

Someone from Tightrope has indeed already stated ''**Don't worry, we got you**'', in case official Classic fails. Loose interpretation of course, but certainly not hopeless.

Although Enhancement has issues at end game, it is a good spec for leveling.

lvl 39 rogue was very strong. everything that was not a good equipped twink was complete food.

I used your guide and it was amazing, especially for keeping wands up to date. Just wanted to say thanks.

The same why warriors spend the last 30seconds of a fight against a hunter hamstringing him to be able to shoot them with a bow: epeening and taking a dump on the enemy's ego.

While leveling, this is a nice and easy way to earn a little extra. Doesn't matter if it's the first weeks or months, or whatever, since you vendor it... It's not like vendors will offer you less gold a few months after launch.

Nice censoreship huh ? ;)

Well you can get tokens in retail and pay the sub, which also pays for classic, so there indirectly are wow tokens

Once again proving the trolls are the masterrace.

Their stupendous height combined with their ability to regenerate **5 health** per 5 seconds (*even while in combat!*) without a doubt makes them the optimal choice for every class. There's just no debating this. 
---
r/wowservers is the subreddit you are looking for.
---
Any bracket 19-39 is heavily pwned by hunters, really. There are some classes to counter them, yet up to 39 hunt + twink healer were literally unstoppable.
---
The rest are up to you: warrior 39+ is fine (warrior 49 is kinda top, since he bites the face of the target off with one crit of MS), rogues are more or less fine 19-39 if you know how to play em, any casters up to 29 may be some kind of lousy, but in 39/49 brackets they are really great, healers are in high demand in every bracket, but since you are shammy, I believe you wouldn't want to take one more healer.
---
Really his own fault for picking wrong faction.
---
I haven't played WoW in over 6 years so I had no clue what a wow token was. So this helped me understand.
---
Now I know what it means, I sure as hell don't want this happening in WoW Classic. Everything you earn in WoW Classic should be through gameplay, effort and skill. 
---
Exactly and as a shaman you have the benefit of choosing ranged or melee dps if you feel the urge to do some damage. So win win.
---
The gnome voice is pretty cringey.

I remember there being an addon which would ping when your bobber appeared, I think it even let you click anywhere on screen to reel in. They banned it for this reason I think as you could basically afk fish.

Items that people need on quests, e.g. Deadly Blunderbuss for [http://classicdb.ch/?quest=6581](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=6581)

Sure, but the actual timing of the attack is random.  Like I said, the only different thing about Ony's attack is that it targets an area, not a person.  This was easy to determine because she always nuked the same space based on her position.
---
Good for you, dude. I mained a NE druid back in retail from vanilla to WotLK. Really fun class to play in vanilla and I'm sure you'll enjoy it aswell.. Hopefully, not every guild in Classic will have the same attitude towards hybrids as many people on this subreddit. 
---
I do actually like grinding. Especially at 60 when there are pvp challenges involved. Fighting over a space to farm is pretty fun.
---
Can't imagine why anyone would think that their **subjective** enjoyment of world PvP is objectively the correct way to enjoy the game.
---
If you enjoy being ganked by people so much higher level than you that you can't possibly win, or better yet ganked by groups of 5v1, or how about ganked whenever you're low then that's up to you. I prefer my PvP to be fair. 
---
In Vanillia wow I made gold 1 of 3 ways: Farmed herbs/ore, farmed the AH, and did quests at 60 for gold. I was not hurting for cash.
---
I only played in the 39 bracket and there druids really stood out to me since the lack of mounts make travel form dominate.
---
Paladins are absolutely amazing in this bracket as well because they got perfect synergy with engineering, bubble + Death ray + sapper charge will let you one shot everything even if they're twinked out as hell and stuff like net-o-matics do a lot more work for paladins than majority of other classes
---
So just private message him? 
---
True, pve server seems pointless and artificial to me, like a theme park.
---
I don't agree, buying gold was prolific in 2005/2006, I did it myself just to get my epic mount. As long as they set the amount of gold you can buy to smaller amounts like and not 100g at a time I don't see a problem.
---
As for special pets, mounts and cosmetics yes I do agree they should be earned. In my opinion it's likely classic will be monetised but it won't be the end of the world, as I said gold sellers were rampant and it didn't make WoW unplayable as long as people aren't able to buy hundreds at a time.
---
That's actually where it started. People began to organise arena teams loosely near the end of vanilla and had some really cool fights there.
---
Haha a friend told me to do it for laughs
---
It's going to be a general recreation of the character I played in Classic, a Feral Druid, because I was always told I was wrong about Feral Druid back then, and I hated that, but I was too much of a wimp and too unsure to push back any.
---
Now with the knowledge, skill, and maturity I have today, I want to see just how right or wrong I really was in an authentic player environment.  That's it.
---
If I may be pedantic for a second.
---
Do you think that trading Classic Gold for a token should be available?
---
Not the other way, but I think it'd be a good thing.  Actually deflate the economy.  Say 50g = 1 month token?
---
Tauren can ride wolves.
---
and also it gives another motivation to lvl up - "someday I'll get back here and take my revenge!"
---
If you level as a group, make sure to do the quests in Stonetalon mountains. You will likely be outnumbered but by being in a group, leveling there might be fun. 
---
Especially the harpy kill quests will make you train squad tactics as if its napalm burned vietnam forest.
---
If Classic is still immensely popular after ZG release they should consider this route.  Either a "lore branch what if" or releasing TBC as an option to clone your character.
---
Yup, death brings ppl together &lt;3
---
No one cares how you pay for the sub as long as it doesn't affect classic.
---
I’m a consultant that travel across the globe for like 3 weeks at a time. I’m sure I will spend most of 1-60 playing from a hotel room 😫😄

You did read his priest section, right? specifically mentioned that it a bonus not to fight shamans as UD...
---
I mean you can disagree with his opinion but at least  use some valid critisism, instead of arguing a point he *literally* made.
---
And looking at "the whole picture" you need to consider bof and bop. A dwarf can get those and stick to/ get away from an enemy.
---
Or are you - as I assume-  only talking about rogues and how they have a hard time against orcs? Then please say " rogue" and not "dwarf". Because his hunter section seems solid and it is also dwaef vs orc.
---
Some people enjoy getting their balls stepped on.
---
Or maybe vanilla just isn't for you if you need that instant gratification. Legitimizing gold selling is not the way to go. It's true some people got away with it, but far from everyone. You invest so much time into your characters in classic, and a chance of ban even if small will keep the vast majority away from it.

When you start resorting to conspiracy theories about chinese gold sellers pushing propaganda to you via an English speaking subreddit about an unreleased game, it might be time to go outside and take a break from computers. Go talk to someone. A professional.
---
about the tokens: I still remember the times when the servers were full of chinese gold farmers and lvl1 toons advertising goldbuying websites (it evdn happens now on pservers). So while I'm not sure that I would want tokens, I gotta say that unlike the item shop, tokens do have actual utility
---
But it doesn't deter shit? Retail is unplayable without the BadBoy addon to block the constant gold selling spam.
---
Here's how this conversation has always gone before:
---
I'm going to say "RMT is not a crime, it's just against a company's policy in a computer game, and decisions about company policy in computer games should absolutely be driven by whether the cure is worse than the disease and whether a policy is cost-effective to enforce".
---
You're going to say "But **logically** if you think cost-effectiveness is a reason to not police a company policy in a computer game you must think that in the real world we shouldn't prosecute human trafficking child raping puppy farming serial killers if it costs too much".
---
Is that about right, or are you going to surprise me?
---
You prefer your PvP?
---
indeed, a sensible person would look at it that way. however, I don't think activision has the same opinion on how to make the most money. E.g. people spending thousands of $ in cash shops (aka "blue whales") have a huge impact on the viability of pay to win in general, so losing subs but gaining whales might even be more profitable unfortunately.
---
One thing that appears crystal clear is that activision does not care for the consumers and what they want, only for how they get most money
---
Yes. 
---
2.4.3
---
If you think it will have a catastrophic effect realize that it will probably be possible by trading retail gold for classic gold using the retail wow token.
---
This is a post about a podcast which discusses the honor system. I made a post about my own opinion. Then you come trying to shut me up. You are mean, rude and you are adding nothing to the conversation.

Maybe you dont realize how much 400-500g really is. Dedicating a day and getting this amount will set you up for weeks if you dont spend it on some expensive item.
---
Current 95/5 Classic (after stabilization).
---
Yes, you had to turn off ambience sound in the past.
---
In a month people will have spme gold to fling around, but it's always hard to say. If you're not planning on outright farming gold then you can always instead get your hands on things like blue twink boes, rare herbs, elemental stuff, etc.

I see a lot of people taking Holy Nova. Holy Nova is taken for the memes and you will not be using it for anything really, (good for killing the rat trap in Stratholm UD side).
---
The healing at highest rank is at base equal to a level 30 heal. The skill is instant cast so you will get a really low scaling from +healing power. You also don't have any kind of +spell damage so the damage part is negligible.
---
It can be a fun skill but if you are trying to min/max you spend that point in something else.
---
&gt; Or maybe vanilla just isn't for you if you need that instant gratification.
---
I think you need to wake up to the reality that people who play vanilla WoW have been buying gold in one form or another from very shortly after the first servers opened. They did it in retail and they do it on pirate servers. So what you are saying is that vanilla WoW is not for a massive number of people who played and play vanilla WoW, which is a very silly way to try to play gatekeeper.
---
I never bought or sold gold myself, but I am not one of the silly people who pretend it was not widespread.
---
&gt;  Legitimizing gold selling is not the way to go. It's true some people got away with it, but far from everyone.
---
It was a huge business. The people who bought gold very rarely faced any serious consequences unless they were so foolish or unfortunate as to get a keylogger or something, and the people who sold the gold accepted regular bans as the price of doing business.
---
&gt; And WoW tokens damage the economy far more than gold sellers ever would anyway.
---
This is a tricky one, because my perception in retail vanilla was that gold farmers were actually vital to the economy although of course Blizzard could never say so out loud. Which is why tokens are good because they encourage people to get out and farm enough stuff to keep the raiders supplied with consumables.
---
The reality is you would not even know what an economy without RMT or tokens looked like, because you have never seen one.
---
I never had a problem with Arenas, beyond the lameness that is pillar humping.  My issue is all the class "balance" changes and engineering nerfs they made as a result of them.
---
&gt;Could just make inviting to a group disable FFA in the STV, Orgrimmar and Dire Maul arena. 
---
That's how it worked in Vanilla.  Once you were in a group, it wasn't FFA to members of your group.
---
&gt;Yeah the Gurubashi arena was one attempt but being permanently FFA was of course complicated. 
---
FFA wasn't permanent in Gurubashi.  Once you were in a group, it wasn't FFA to members of your group.
---
The fun part is when the fight is balanced and exciting.  Nobody enjoys  getting killed by a guy 20 levels higher, but it's a thing we accept sometimes happens.
---
If it looks like corpse camping I just hearthstone to another zone or I switch to a bank alt, doing some financial housekeeping , or level an alt  if I have any.  
---
Other times it's just enough to form a small group and stick together.  
---
You make a kill on sight (+ corpse camping) list of those players and get back at them when you are 60. Revenge feels very nice.

Are you aware that there are English-speaking gold farmers? One dude who was in my vanilla/earlyTBC guild that I knew personally got banhammered for selling gold.
---
For some young or underemployed people, making five or ten bucks an hour at their computer is how they made their pocket money.
---
&gt; people can pretend RMT isn't happening
---
Like you. RMT is happening still, even after token introduction. If I would have to speculate, I'd say that RMT market slightly decreased but overall market exploded and on average there is fuck ton more people buying gold now.
---
I don't think it will be that big for that long. A lot of people will quit in the first week or even the first day when they hit a wall in the Barrens. I think 15-20% classic in the long run is a good estimation though.
---
I'd even argue against this. It didn't make gearing harder at all. The majority of guild had people come and go all the time. The hard part of gearing was to have a stable roster and get them to play all the time. This one additional epic a week does pretty much nothing to the size of a roster like this. It's clearly a BUG. And one that causes nothing but frustration. 
---
It's pretty much just like saying "But that escort quest always despawned when you went 10m away from it, that's just the way it was back then. If you'd fix it to behave like all the other escort quests you'd make this one much easier and decrease your leveling time in that area - that's asking to make it easier, so stfu..."
---
I'm all up for a classic experience. I'm super stoked for it. But people should use a little bit of realism as well. Not a single person of the "normal" playerbase will play as hard as any of us did back in the original days. Fixing this kind of bug will BY NO MEANS deteriorate from the "classic experience". BY NO WAY.
---
The only way this DOES have an effect is because people keep on voicing their opinions against it so strong, shedding so much hate and bad mood 
---
(Shrug) Then it makes no difference whether there are tokens or not, and all the people threatening to take their ball and go home if there are tokens are being silly.
---
I, for one enjoy grinding. It's relaxing, with a TV series or music on the other screen, interacting with the guild chat, having the excitement of finding chests in the wild, or some boe blue, maybe i stop and fish a little. And there's the chance of some world pvp.  I'm not the min-maxing type who choses the most efficient method alway.
---
For some reason I remember Felwood being the place, somewhere on the northern part of the map, on the road, but It might just have been the place where I realised I have to ding 60 quite soon if I wanna be part of the raid group of the guild I was in at the time. Can not really recall the exact moment.
---
You didn't get the point. If there are 100 people buying gold with $ and then they introduce token and result is that 50 people buy gold with $ and 300 people buy token and sell for gold that is a massive failure for gameplay in my opinion.
---
End yourself
---
Seems fine to me, you substantially reduced the inflation caused by gold farming and 300 people are subscribed who could not otherwise afford it.
---
You sure?
---
I have never played on a PVE server, I have leveled 5 or 6 characters to 60 on various PVP servers over the years (retail in 2005 and private in later years) .  You do get ganked, but it really is not very often, maybe less than 10 times on the whole journey to 60.    (NB this is not on overpopulated servers like nostalrius and it's spinoffs)  But I don;t think official classic servers will be that crowded.  
---
With some easy measures you can limit it to a minimum.  (avoid notorious gank spots, and have a plan B when you run into extended trouble by switching to an alt or hearthstone + travel  to another zone where you have quests) 
---
If you plan to wPvP early on, be sure to take engineering. As alliance you can make  bronze tubes for Duskwood, as horde you can make deadly blunderbusses, for both you can sell mithril encasings and gyrocrhonatoms. These items are all needed for quests, therefore you can make a quick buck while still PvP with a huge edge due to engineering gadgets.
---
Disgusting oozeling in felwood, spent so much time killing slimes and never got it
---
Maybe Bloodsail and bootybay both exatled
---
If the wreckage pools are there, its even better. You get bolts of runecloth, thick and rugged leather and lvl 35 potiosnfrom these wreckages. 
---
One wreckage can be as much as 2.5-4g!
---
it will kill the game on arrival if they allow that
---

Nope, you increased the inflation, more farm = more gold in system = inflation.

Disagree. If you get killed by an NPC you should get locked out of that account and be forced to buy a new subscription
---
Nice didnt know Elon was playing on nost too
---
"Gatekeeping" because I don't want wow tokens in vanilla. Trolls are out in full force today. Thanks for putting it early in your wall of text so I didn't have to read the rest.
---
I'm on the fence about this. I'm going to buy gold regardless if it's from the chinese or from another player via the token however the chinese can really fuck up the servers so much more, I was really happy when they disappeared from the game with the introduction of the token.
---
Well, they instead give us storyline quests which are not required, but they time gate the content to space it out instead of time gating *with* content. I liked how it used to be done, but I will at least say to be fair that time gating does give them more time to work on the raids before release. Still, it's dumb that I can just walk into the mythic raid right when it drops without having to do anything at all to get there, well, besides walking to the instance portal. 
---
Ya, it's fun. Best vanilla xp you can have at the moment. Population is slowly increasing fortunately.
---
Virgin world, few 60s. Love it so far.
---
I don't know why it's bad to have a token. Either people buy gold via token or they will buy gold via gold sellers. Nothing wrong with a token except it was not in classic to begin with.
---
When tbc hit me and all of my friends rolled fresh characters on one of the new servers, Auchindoun EU, levelling 1-70 in a fresh pvp server was the best gaming experience ever, and since x realm wasn't a thing (apart from bg's) you got to know so many people (friend and foe) it made for a brilliant server community which doesn't exist anymore, can't wait to experience it again. 
---
Yep and in this order, too. My routine back then was
---
Spirit Tap 5/5 &gt; Want Spec 5/5 &gt; Imp Pain 2/2 &gt; Matyrdom 2/2 &gt; Shield 3/3 &gt; Inner Focus 1/1 &gt; Meditation 3/3 &gt; Healing Focus 2/2 a random point in Disc to then go Imp Inner Fire 3/3
---
Personally I went down the Discipline tree completely afterwards. At any point in time feel free to invest one point into blackout - it's almost always a nice surprise to get a stun on an enemy.
---
You can't stop gold sales in classic, tho. Either Blizzard sells gold via Token or some shady chinese gold sellers will do. Only difference is, that probably more people would buy from blizzard because of shadyness but gold sellers did exsit in any stage of wow and will definitly be in classic if there will be no token.
---
Sorry I'm out of the loop and couldn't google it, can you tell me which server you are talking about? 
---
1. Leveling a warrior to 60
---
I was killing Furbolgs at Winterspring.
---
Gratz!
---
They're hot
---
Oh I want them around. I'm just warning that they shouldn't play on a PvP server.
---
If even after that warning you still roll on it, well, it's on you. And I"ll have my fun :)
---
They're cartoony 
---
If they could just hold off like 6 months. That's all the time i need to build a Goldshire Cartel. :)
---
Dont forget that blizzard should also track you down and destroy your computer
---
I combined 3 grinds into one in Silithus, grinding Twilight cultist paper, runecloth and gold at the same time.  
---
Raptors are way cooler than wolves.
---
I remember like it was yesterday. Grinding giants by dotting and chain-fearing in Frostwhisper Gorge as a warlock, keeping an eye at that damn xp bar. When it finally happened, the inevitable guild/friends spam began. DING!
---
Just like in real life
---
Socialize like grab a handful of my neighbors dick and smell that tiny_d cologne waft over me? 
---
Yes you'll love to ruin the game
---
He's played an all. He has that kind of free time and insular life. Agreeing with only other isolated bebes.
---
&gt; However the more I thought about it, the more I began to realize I would be playing 3 gimped versions of those roles. 
---
&gt; since I am also unsure I will power shift, I don't know that i care all that much about the extra 10% shift mana cost.
---
Congratulations, you are still gimped, might as well play the 1/29/21 spec.
---
Hahah why not both!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA7J0KkanzM
---
Well, ofcourse, is there other classes worth playing?
---
Well, he won't even powershift, do you tihnk he'll farm those?
---
Okay yeah I guess i missed the point. The whole wording felt wrong. You got 3 kids and a wife which are much more important obligations but you still want to sink a ton of time into the game. That is why i was questioning it. It's just that I've seen what happens to kids with neglectful parents and it can cause serious damage to their psyche and make them have to go to therapy for years. But I'm extremely happy to hear that you put your kids as #1.
---
DONT DO IT!!!! 
---
There's an entire part of Classic and that is camping Chinese gold farmers and ruining their business! 
---
&gt; "Gatekeeping" because I don't want wow tokens in vanilla. Trolls are out in full force today. 
---
I am just pointing out the reality to you. RMT has been part of WoW throughout its history both on and off the official retail servers. Saying "maybe this game *is not for them*" is kind of meaningless. You might as well say "this game is not for hunters who think everything is hunter loot".
---
&gt; Thanks for putting it early in your wall of text so I didn't have to read the rest. 
---
You didn't read it, but you have this deep emotional need to make absolutely sure everyone knows you didn't read it? Sure kid. Next you're going to respond to this, going "waaah I didn't read that either".

If 1 epic a week doesn't make a difference like you say. ( It does) then why push for the change to begin with? Nobody is asking for your escort quest example because that is something that ACTUALLY doesn't make any difference. My first point still stands
---
It's amazing that you only comment on video games and at the_tiny_D
---
 Not amazing. It's insular. It's predictable and it is the case of almost every tiny_D subscriber. Your whole life is probably a waste. Volunteer to help adult read or change their shit pants or something, but do it quietly and with humility.
---
Trying to grind any specific epic boe if you're mad enough.
---
Thanks, I think ill roll a hunter for the pets and ease of grinding!
---
Greetings, Newcastle 👋🏽 
---
And some people like playing BfA
---
As a hunter that had tried trib and mara, I might actually prefer mara. It's way crusier and a fuck up doesn't mean an up to 20min time loss.
---
That's likely down to experience though, as I'm predicting that trib runs would be better with the right respec and knowing it inside out.
---
It’s cold here 
---
It’s like 1 or 2 extra “ticks”, so it results in more damage done, but the damage from the ticks are the same iirc 
---
It was. OP's just tripping out
---
Stv, tanaris. SG is a horde thing for some reason.
---
With so many possibilities and ways to play vanilla, I just can't see the point of niche server types.
---
I mean if you look closely you notice how he actually manages to win without meleeing.
---
Life?
---
Q turnin caer darrow next to me stood an orc warrior 59 
---
Right. Seems most people in this thread have never played Vanilla in 05. I rarely/never got ganked on the 4 toons I leveled to 60 except the one time I rolled on a server that just launched with 1000 of people still leveling. Though things could be different in classic but we'll see.
---
Put a bit more effort into it. This is 2004 levels of trolling. That is to say, pretty bad. You gotta do more than just call people kids. That hasn't worked for over a decade after everyone realized it's always the actual kids using it.
---
Tokens might also help with the racism problem.
---
AB and WSG reps
---
Rank14 is the worst grind in all of WoW, all expansions indluded.
---
The Eastern Plaguelands quest hub
---
Yet here you are, reeled back in for another bite of that tasty bait after pretending you weren't reading and pretending to flounce away. You can't help it.
---
The reward was not worth it
---
Hahah, i can combine any grind with this one though!
---
Thanks! Ofcourse! How did i oversee this one
---
Death knight or demon hunter, hero classes start at a higher level so you don’t need to grind too much!
---
Ah the classic "I was just pretending to be retarded".
---
I'm perfectly capable of replying to you even without reading your wall of text. Too much for you to process, little troll?
---
As a warlock the hunters usually made a grave mistake.
---
I dont think ill do this one, since i dont have time to kiss ass to the server maffia
---
I don't believe shaman could DW in vanilla, so I'm not sure if you are implying they could with the "using your mainhand weapon" comment or not, if you are suggesting using a 1h + OH  or shield then I'm not sure what to say about this "theorycrafting"
---
Either youre on the wrong sub or i did not find the joke finns :*
---
Simple: you're alliance and you kill Raggy. Now only Horde Items drop. That's not how the game is supposed to work. It's a bug. An utterly frustrating one given certain scenarios on top of everything. It needs fixing. It's not a "convenience" fix. 
---
The impact of this is FAR LESS than having DM open during T1...
---
And take all your clothes and shoes.
---
Say untalented SWP is 10 seconds and does 100 damage ( 5 ticks of 20 damage). Talented SWP is 16 seconds and would now do 160 ( 8 ticks of 20 damage).
---
Numbers are off but you get the idea
---
You’re too stiff, grab a beer :)
---
Those pirates in tanaris with that bloody tunnel that makes you dismount
---
Classic wow is being released this summer
---
I mean regardless of what any of you do the chinese farmers will come and sell gold and ruin the eco as always as they do in every mmo.  They ruin everything mmo wise.
---
Best reason to roll alliance: your main hubs don't look like dilapidated tent cities overrun by leprose homeless people.
---
Next best reason to roll alliance: don't have to face paladins.
---
It's not out yet
---
Ashenvale and Stonetalon mountains start the wpvp really.
---
This DoT (Damage over Time-spell) ticks once every third second. This increases the duration of the DoT by 3 seconds per talent point, effectively adding one more tick. The damage per tick and damage per second remains constant, but you'd have to cast it less often and therefore also spend less mana per damage.
---
It's coming "Summer 2019". When it's out, you'll have to sub to WoW and then you can play.
---
We don't have an official release date yet, just summer 2019.
---
When it comes, you won't need to buy anything, just pay for the sub and you'll have access to it (together with retail, even if you're not interested in it, the sub is shared).
---
&gt;the cure is worse than the disease
---
As decided by who?
---
&gt;whether a policy is cost-effective to enforce
---
Based on what? Sharding is cost effective, but Classic fans are ready to tear shit down about that, which would hurt profits in the end. The exact same thing can be applied to this. Just some typical short sighted market analysis that risks backfiring and hurting you in the end.
---
Neither of us know what will be more profitable in the long term so stop trying to present your view as fact.
---
\&gt; Enemy faction player attacks another player whos infight, brings him down to 2% health and lets mob finish him off
---
\&gt; ???
---
\&gt; profit
---
That's impossible to only get horde items, you might get 1 horde item, use it to DE and take it as a hit to droprates. It's "utterly frustrating" just how not getting a certain drop you wanted is "utterly frustrating".
---
The fact that it's a bug doesn't matter, it was a bug for all of vanilla. Bugs can become features when it affects the game this much. Just because DM is open doesn't mean we should flood in any other changes even if they are less of a deal in someone's eyes than DM. Both factions got hit with the bug so there's no issue. You just want an excuse for higher gear drops.
---
I feel the same, however in my pserver experience, a 60 player smacking you in the head happens way more often than anything resembling a balanced fight. And if a player of a similar level range does attack you, he waits until you stuggle with mobs or brings 2 of his friends. 
---
I always rotate between these methods of leveling.
---
1. Early morning questing with coffee. It’s relaxing when I’m first waking up and I have the patience to really read the quest and immerse myself.
---
2. Dungeons or general exploring the land with friends. Take a break and see who can figure out how to get on a cliff, or up top of a statue or something. Also friend dungeons are fun if you all swap roles, and try to pull more things just for fun.
---
3. Watch a pvp video then crank the tunes and just grind mobs for a hour or 2. Farms gold and mats and gives you exp too.
---
4. Take a break and do some pvp
---
Biggest thing is just remember, classic isn’t about rushing to end game. If you rush you will just burn out and not enjoy anything. If you have a hour to play just log on and play, don’t set any goals, don’t force a dungeon, just do whatever comes up. I’ve spent nights just working on profs because it’s fun!
---
&gt;A cash shop opposes vanilla wow’s philosophy of earning all items (vanity/cosmetic included) in game.  
---
This is just false tho. Vanilla already had a "cash shop" which are TCG stuff and collector's edition.  
---
My man, been at work for 10 hours. You do not know stiff
---
Then again the last couple years since Nostalrius you have 8.000-15.000 player realms. Not the cozy 2.500realms in which you have a couple dedicated gankers and thats it.
---
&gt;Yea I will just quit it and go back to playing private servers that are infested with Chinese farmers and where server owners dupe characters as well as /create gold in order to deepen their pockets  
---
Some of you are very funny.  
---
And then one grouped up with a warrior, spammed dispell and the newly acquired whirlwind axe made short work of that dodging hunter!
---
That was mostly done to promote the TCG. Which failed anyway (or became HS I guess)
---
Vanilla leveling is a journey all on its own. Just enjoy the ride. Lots to do, lots of time to do it, and some pretty in depth and interesting lore to follow along with in the quests. 
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
...Is there anyone who do want it? 
---
You should get banned for buying gold
---
If all you’re doing is thinking about trying to get to 60 the fastest it’s not going to be fun. Take the time along the way to group up with people and do dungeons and explore the world. Leveling up a profession while you go can also give you something else to do. You need to break up those grindy moments and not just do the same thing for 8 hours. 
---
Its not dull at all, if you try to do it efficient and optimize shit, it gives satisfaction and enjoyment. rather than it being a braindead dull chore for 5-6 days. Its like a minigame you play, and constantly think how can i improve and do shit more efficient and faster. its very enjoyable.
---
Use a guide (vanilla guide, for instance). cos having an upcoming plan of deeds in front of you helps to keep going.
---
Look at xp bar, track progress how you go through bars and how it fills up, and set small goals in your head, like reaching next bar even. or half of the level and so on. always track how much xp you get form anything and how it moved you in xp progression.
---
Another subgoal could beto finish all quest in the zone. 
---
Don't think and concentrate on reaching level 60, just play the game, look what it offers RIGHT NOW at your level and go for easily feasible small goals (set it in your head), from one milestone to another, as i said before, even just finishing some quest chain or story line, or setting a goal to get some weapon drop, or fininishing the zone, or getting to the next bar even. 
---
Ppl usually tend to get bored cos all they care and focus on is getting to level 60, and then after awhile they see and sense how distant it is, and it demotivates them to do anything. So go for small things instead, and you wont even notice how from one small adventure to another, step by step you get to 60 without even focusing on it. it just naturally happen and will be a reward in the end.
---
R14 is outrageous. I remember joining a pvp pre made guild to start the grind. After 14 hours a day the first day, I told the group I was going to run out and get food for 30 min and everyone freaked out saying we still had 4 more hours.
---
That was the last day I thought about rank 14.
---
I think all 3 of my vanilla 60s were killing those furbolgs
---
you're forgetting all the hacking/scaming that they do   
---
the moment less people buy for them they hack less because there is no market for it   
---
irrelevant what it was for  
---
its still essentially a microtransaction  
---
I've never been on a private server, but for me the fun was helping friends.  To be fair, I mained a feral druid, the majority of my time was spent in stealth.  But largely the situation would be a friend saying they were getting ganked, I'd go out with the rest of The Squad, and we'd beat the crap out of them, they'd call in their friends, we'd fight, eventually we'd get bored and all drift off.  Or if there were a few stealthers in the The Crew for the day, we'd hang out and stay in stealth a while until they emoted stuff, like /chicken and the like, and then get back to introducing their face to the floor.
---
PvP enjoyment, for me, wasn't about the PvP itself, it was about the break and the time spent helping friends who appreciated that you took your time to come help out.
---
Not really. That's not an mtx.
---
How would you know that I buy gold? I just stated that people will buy gold, as you can see by the loads of gold spammer even on private servers.
---
&gt; However, of course, I love the end game.
---
How do you know that when you have never played Vanilla end-game?
---
Seriously! Buy your gold from Chinese farmers like a real vanilla veteran!
---
I was a rogue and I dinged by completing a quest in Silithus and it was the guy in full Bloodfang at the top of one of the towers that I had to turn it in to.  
---
Man what a glorious moment because I spent so much time just aimlessly pvping as I was leveling with my higher level friends. I could finally start getting those epic loots!
---
Most awkward moment of PvP was when I was just making it to the level bracket to be in -- Burning Steppes?  Pretty sure.
---
Anyway, no sooner had I walked into the zone and someone invites me and whispers 'Horde here, come help?'  And, being the 'I like helping people!' person that I am, I accepted, checked their location on the map, and made my way there.  Sure enough, there was fighting, and I jumped in to help!
---
Aaaand I slowly came to realize that there was a Horde flight master nearby that we were avoiding.
---
I wasn't helping defend, I was helping gank.  It may not have been on my character sheet, but it was my first dishonorable kills.
---
Hopefully one day you learn how to read.  
---
Today is not that day I guess.  
---
do nt distreb
---
On release when the whole world is leveling, selling cloth for bandages and making/selling bags is the way to go imo. 
---
If I remember correctly, the first people with the Arcanite Reaper plans would make them for people for tons of gold.
---
I would try to get top level plans right away because there will be a huge demand for it for the first couple of months.
---
It's because of wow's style of much more bending at the knee for the males
---
I sometimes just start listening to an e-book or an interesting podcast and grind mobs I can do without effort. Also I sometimes calculate how many mobs I need to hit the next level and then just do it. For example 200 or 1k mobs kills is easy for me. Just zone out or find another activity to do while grinding and Im set.
---
Ofc I also mix in playing with friends, exploring and saturday lazy mornings with coffee.
---
dam
---
Hey just think, the more work you get in now the more you can no-life classic on release.
---
There are ways to monitor that behavior now that we didn't have in the past or on private servers.
---
But even back in the day you could tell
---
lol shade thrown. orgrimmar is just far and away the best hub honestly. missed it so bad when i rolled ally on a private server.
---
God you're insufferable
---
"I'm just gonna repeat my stupid ass point t and insult people. That's a good argument right?" Fucking moron
---
My god, I just realized I used to do 'It's nothing personal, kid.'
---
Feral druid main in Vanilla.  (I know.)  When passing through STV (or any zone, but STV was the most frequent one with 'problems'), I'd often see someone gank a priest, or a much-lower level than them, or whatever.  Me being me, I had a habit of stealthing everywhere, so I'd usually get right in front of them, sit down, pop out of stealth, and /sigh.
---
Often there'd be /crying, or /beg, or what have you, but I literally -just saw- you murder something that had no chance against you.  I'd silently stealth, go behind them, and kill them.  To me it was karma, I was just the tool enabling it to happen.
---
And now I realize I was also the 'It's nothing personal, kid' guy.
---
ackchyually, it's *[nothin personnel... kid...](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/coldsteel-the-hedgeheg)
---
^^^^^I'm ^^^^^a ^^^^^bot. ^^^^^Complaints ^^^^^should ^^^^^be ^^^^^sent ^^^^^to ^^^^^u/stumblinbear ^^^^^where ^^^^^they ^^^^^will ^^^^^be ^^^^^subsequently ^^^^^ignored
---
So I'm planning on rolling warrior as well, and planning on going Fury at 60. I see a lot of people saying that you should level as arms.
---
 I can see why Mortal Strike is great for PVP, but what makes Arms better than Fury for levelling?
---
Haha, word
---
Make it like RuneScape, you die outside town and all your gear and gold get dropped unless it was stored in the bank. All the items in your bags too....so if you try to farm mineral nodes with no gear and somehow manage to not die by mob aggro, then someone kills you, the last hour just dropped and they get the profit. 
---
All the gear is still BOP though so you can’t equip someone else’s gear, it just gets vendored or d.e’d....I would love this type of server.
---
*puts on tin foil hat*
---
Yeah that’s what I was envisioning. Thank you for clarifying! 
---
And screw your mom.
---
The fucked thing was that I knew people that got Rank 14 and did it AGAIN once the new weapons came out, just insane.
---
You should die irl
---
I will be 100% honest I never knew you could jump through the window I always just went off the side into the lava and eventually zoned in. Luckily did not die but I remember this fondly.
---
lol, I guess I triggered you  
---
you are unable to accept that you're wrong and that your precious little game already had what is essentially a mtx so you just double down on stupidity  
---
I accept that, since it's nothin personnel, bot.
---
Thanks, glad it helped.
---
I don't know any of these ways. Recording log files? Was possible in the past and on private as well. 
---
You would need an automated way to find shady trades. How would you differ if a player buys gold or a friend gifts him gold? With IP adresses? Well we have proxy servers and VPN and all that. 
---
&gt; As decided by who?
---
Rational people, I was thinking.
---
&gt; Based on what?
---
Evidence is the usual thing.
---
&gt; Sharding is cost effective, but Classic fans are ready to tear shit down about that, which would hurt profits in the end.
---
In case you hadn't noticed, a lot of Classic fans are not in a healthy place emotionally and are primed to throw a tantrum at any offence real or imagined. I don't know how seriously to take their threats of a boyott, but generally speaking the degree to which I think Blizzard will care about their opinion is inversely proportional to how likely they are to actually walk away over this stuff.
---
&gt; Neither of us know what will be more profitable in the long term so stop trying to present your view as fact.
---
Come with me on a journey of the mind.
---
Trying to police RMT definitely takes loads of person-hours. That means it definitely costs money. Its value is negative.
---
Selling tokens definitely makes money. It is an automated process that requires no hands-on work from staff. Even if it did nothing to reduce the cost of policing RMT at all, it would still be a positive value proposition. But it does, so as well as tangible cash in hand it also reduces payroll costs by a real (if hard to precisely calculate) amount.
---
Your argument is that neither of us know whether a large positive number is larger than a large negative number.
---
I am assuming that the bellyachers aren't actually going to quit in significant numbers over it, and it would take a *lot* of bellyachers quitting to cover the cost of even one extra full-time employee.
---
You’re a moron if you think they would
---
If they do that, I'm just done. I'm not invested enough in Classic to stick around at that point.  
---
I've been tempering my hype, not only because of possibilities like this, but also because I know it won't last forever for me if the content is going to be static forever, with no new servers launching periodically (like seasons in Diablo).  
---
I'm not even going to make a fuss about it. I'll just quit. There are other things more worth my time than Classic with a cash shop.  
---
Why on earth would they link up the economies of retail and classic like that???
---
Keep in mind that hunters only have 3 pet slots in Classic. 1 active and 2 stabled, meaning cosmetic pet collecting wasn’t nearly as much of a thing as it is now on Live. But, if you wanted it to be a fun nostalgia trip with you pets, get Lupos, Brokentooth, and Son of Hakkar. Got the full history there haha
---
They won’t directly, it will be a result of player behaviour.
---
Not sure I understand what you're saying here. 
---
How could it be possible to trade retail gold for classic gold using the token? 
---
The only "connection" I can see is being able to buy Classic game time using the retail WoW token. 
---
At least I know how to argue like an intelligent person. You just throw insults and repeat the same point without any support. 
---
Do you even know what an MTX is? because it does not include buying TCG cards
---
Yeah, no.
---
So you are claiming that it is a) random and simultaneously b) based on her position? I am confused by that.
---
only way to restrict that is to make it not possible to trade gold through trade window / mail box
---
&gt;At least I know how to argue like an intelligent person  
---
No you don't. You literally couldn't read or understood what I said.  
---
Also spewing insults is not very "intelligent" of you.  
---
&gt;You just throw insults and repeat the same point without any support.  
---
Funny because that's what you did. Not me.  
---
&gt;Do you even know what an MTX is? 
---
Still didn't go back and reread the my comment? I guess you're not as intelligent as you think. 
---
I also enjoy a good grind/farm. Due to inventory space I won't be able to collect as many pets and mounts as I would like (assuming they stick to no changes and don't introduce tabs for them). So I've made a list of 10 or so pets I'll grind for. Some of them (e.g. Hyacinth Macaw, oozling) will be pretty painful.
---
Rep grinds are the other one. This is where a few achievements, just to keep track, might have been nice. Getting exalted with everyone kinda thing.
---
Gold spamming went on for lot longer than vanilla. It is also so trivial to stop (e.g., spam filter for detection, stopping trial accounts fro using public chat at lvl 1, etc. etc.), that the only logical explanation is that Blizzard *wanted* the gold sellers in the game. Maybe they thought that it's a service that keeps some players in the game, or they knew they could just occasionally ban people to force them to buy a new WoW cope.
---
Congrats :) I thought I had kind figured out, but now it’s between two again. Paladin and Mage. Meh, I’ll figure it out eventually 
---
Its not THAT bad.  People remember it to be bad because they were young. Its a time investment, just like anything else. One thing you shouldnt forget and that is that its part of the whole game experience. Its fun, enjoy, dont be to focused. Just do whatever comes across your path. 
---
Keep in mind also pets and mounts take up inventory space. ALL the pets especially is probably not very practical, sadly.
---
Token is one of the absolute deal breakers for me. It trivializes the economy and the economy is one major aspect that I enjoy in WoW.
---
The same way people trade gold across servers in retail today. I give you gold on classic, you give me gold on retail.
---
I will be nelf druid 1 11 39 PvP pve healing hybrid
---
The trip to lvl 60 can be a long one, and if you dont like it its better to find some extra things to do, are you around lvl 40 orso, try to focus on some pvp in STV and the arena trinket just for funs. I personally like to have a crafting profession, cloth = tailoring, leather = leatherworking or mail = blacksmithing. And then you try to keep them as high as your own lvl, this will make your lvling slower (mats grinding) and will cost some money but its a refreshing way of lvling and you will always walk in the best gear for your lvl. Also doing some roleplaying in the mayor city's (or goldshire &gt;.&gt;) can be refreshing.
---
But if you dont like the lvling i am wondering what you do like at the lvl 60 end-game? because the raids and dungeons arnt like those of TBC (imo the prime of WoW except for the flying and space theme).
---
I'm planning to get like 10-20 audiobooks when classic releases =D as i have a few to catch up on a great chance to read and play
---
Inbefore #nochanges : NOCHANGE MY BRAIN CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WOULD NOT ALLOW OTHER BAD QOL
---
If you have a different opinion I'd happily hear it, I'm open to having my mind changed.
---
Human Mage.
---
I've never played WoW. I mean, I played using the Starter Edition for a couple of hours, and I also played a Human Mage up to level 20 on a private server. But after that I decided to wait for Classic to launch.
---
My MMO background is LOTRO. For two years I played nothing but LOTRO, only stopping when it went f2p. And in LOTRO the class I enjoyed the most was Hunter. So I simply want to play the WoW class that's closest to LOTRO's Hunter, but WoW's Hunter isn't it.
---
LOTRO's Hunter isn't a pet class. The pet classes are Lore-Master and Captain, and the pet aspects of those classes are pretty minor. I never paid much attention to my pet when I played them. From what I can tell, a WoW Hunter's pet is a huge deal, and I'm really not interested in dealing with that.
---
LOTRO's Hunter's role in a group is simply ranged DPS. That's what I want to be, so Mage is what I shall play. But LOTRO's Hunters also had something very important in common with Mages: They're the ones who have portals to cities. Yep, portaling to cities was not done with magic portals. It was done with a Hunter who, in lore terms, knows how to find the shortest path to any location in Middle-Earth, and could lead his Fellowship there.
---
Also, when I played Captain, I liked giving buffs to random passers-by, and Mage is one class who can do that, so that'll be fun. I also really like the idea of not having to buy food and water.
---
Now, why Human? Well if you didn't know, LOTRO is 90% PvE. All of your characters were good guy characters. All PvP (apart from duels) is contained within one zone, the Ettenmoors (actually they might have made Osgiliath a PvP zone in some expansion, but that was way after my time). You can go to the Ettenmoors with your good guy character, or you could make a bad guy character that only exists within the Ettenmoors. They start at level cap, and have to rank with PvP kills to get stronger. But the point is that as the bad guys, you were ABSOLUTELY the bad guys. A bunch of stupid orcs getting assigned tasks by other orcs who threatened you with whips, or being sent to the sulfur pits. You hung tattered red banners in the name of the Witch-King of Angmar. You hunted giant slugs to make disgusting food for the troops. Or you could play a warg or spider.
---
In WoW, the Horde occupies that tattered-red-banner aesthetic, but they're not the bad guys. If I want to play the faction that looks like the bad guys, I want to actually be the bad guys. I want to embrace how stupid, violent, and evil we are. If I can't have that, then I'd rather just play the more vanilla faction, the Alliance.
---
And, well, I don't wanna be short. I liked playing Hobbits in LOTRO because, y'know, it's a Hobbit, they have a particular lifestyle that interests me, and being one of the few Hobbits to go adventuring is pretty cool (I mean if you ignore all the millions of other Hobbit players in the game. It was an MMO with a main quest, you were supposed to pretend you were the most important character in the game!) But I didn't like Dwarves in that game too much just because being short isn't appealing. (I'm 5'6 IRL. I'd love to be 5'9.)
---
And even if I did want to play Horde, I really don't want to play an Undead or Troll. They're just ugly. So no Horde Mage for me.
---
If I get bored of the Mage I'll make a Night Elf Druid. Just because that's kind of the thing you do.
---
&gt; Imagine being stuck farming fire damage gear on tier 6 while the majority is farming tier 8 and 9 or trying to gear up an alt over 7 tiers just to get to the current and relevant content.
---
That assumes that all the new raids are designed to be done after the one that came directly before. It doesn't have to be this way. The developers could make use of branching progression instead of linear progression.
---
Good point. There are videoes on YT to help you understand so don’t worry.
---
Hello to you to, If you have a different opinion then please share it, I'm open to changing my mind if you can provide some points.
---
Here we go again. As you said yourself, it’s been said a thousand times and this thread literally provided no good discussion, other than people circlejerking how token’s going to ruin the game. I think it’s quite obvious Blizzard understand what the differences are between Classic and retail at this point, and what a majority of the people want.
---
The answer none of us want to hear. :(
---
There are tons of private servers that far outlived the lifespan of original WoW Vanilla. Sure, private servers can go down at any point, but was the official Blizzard experience any different? 
---
When a new expansion comes out, you might as well have lost your character, you'll replace all your gear in no time.
---
&gt; I’m probably going to give up just because the level process is so dull to me. However, of course, I love the end game.
---
Then the endgame may be even more dull to you. Are you sure you want that?
---
Microtransactions are a business model where users can purchase virtual goods with micropayments. Microtransactions are often used in free-to-play games to provide a revenue source for the developers. 
---
- Wikipedia
---
So explain to me how TCG fits the above description? lol
---
I buy wow token with real money. Sell it on AH for retail gold. Trade retail gold for classic gold. 
---
The other person would get retail gold and could buy a wow token for playtime.
---
As the goblins like to say, time is money friend.
---
Ok, that's possible. But what's the token's roll in all of this? And what are the catastrophic effects? I can't see that much of an impact or even an actual incentive. Farming classic gold in order to gain retail gold (which is ridiculously easy to obtain compared to classic gold) doesn't sound like it's worth it. 
---
Besides, that kind of trading seems just impossible to prevent. How could you stop anyone doing this?
---
&gt; . Either people buy gold via token or they will buy gold via gold sellers. 
---
Why have laws and rules if everyone will break them anyway?  
---
Because they affect behaviour.   
---
And if you want to learn "why does it matter to me?" the anwer is easy: "do you want to play with other players?" if No, then go ahead, support this bullshit and see how WoW Classic don't attract Anyone that doesn't already play BfA.
---
If Blizzard openly said, hey, come buy gold from us, don't you think way more people would do it rather than going through some shady third party?
---
The goal should be to reduce gold selling as much as possible, not create an incentive for Blizzard to change the game in favor of selling more microtransactions.
---
&gt; I don't agree, buying gold was prolific in 2005/2006
---
Everyone steals says the theif.  
---
Everyone cheats says the adulterer.  
---
Everyone takes bribes says the corrupt official.  
---
But here's the crux: no, most people Don't do the stupid shit that's against the rules.
---
&gt; is the damage the same and just the duration longer?
---
That would not be just useless, but even harmful talent, lol.
---
and then the paladin knows his role, is holy and carries his warrior against 5 enemies :(
---
Make some friends. That will happen on a fresh. easy
---
last sentence: yeah that's my understanding of why they implemented tokens in the first place. About the rest: I'm not so sure. Yes there are technical solutions, but they aren't nearly as good at making the right decisions as machines currently are. tl;dr: not convinced that tokens is simply a bad solution for a problem that could otherwise be fixed.
---
Why don't you listen to my advice for a moment and reread my comment?  
---
I see, but as I mentioned in the other reply, I don't think that will ever get common. 
---
Someone has to farm the classic gold before. And if someone's goal is to get a WoW token, he'll be much better off directly farming retail gold than classic gold since classic gold is much harder to get. 
---
!remindme 6 months
---
I'll double check with you around when classic is hopefully releasing. ;)

---
Indeed. I wont say it will be widespread but do I expect to see it. 
---
I never said everyone will buy gold. Obvious there won't be as much "gold buyers" if it is illegal. But there will be gold sellers/and buyers for sure even if it is illegal. I prefer a token on the auction house over so many whispers / spammed trade chat for shady sites. 
---
Most probably I won't buy gold anyways but the spam for sites is just so annoying, that I prefer a token. 
---
In additon, I believe a token won't destroy anything in WoW, since the gold for the token is not generated by Blizzard but from real people. 
---
Gold selling in the mid 2000's was big business, there were dozens of sites competing for customers, not everyone bought from them no but there were plenty who did whether they would admit to it or not, as human beings we more often than not take the easy route which is why microtransactions or "pay to skip" is such big money these days.
---
Should Blizzard not have a "Classic Token" with which to trade money for gold it will simply be buying gold from a gold farmer, at least tokens will disrupt the server economies less.
---
I was grinding those same elementals and damn were they a pain in the ass. The regenerating night elves in the area didn't help much either, and there were the giant bugs
---
So you're stating this as a fact, or just guessing?
---
Probably the single most miserable possible grind in the game is getting both Gelkis and Magram Centaurs to Honoured. It's technically possible in Vanilla (they might not recreate this behaviour though), but not worth it in the slightest.
---
For one - it \*CANNOT\* be done solo. In fact, you are entirely dependent on one or more other people to do this. Whenever you kill a centaur of one clan, you lose reputation with that clan and gain reputation with the other. But if a party member kills a centaur that you have not touched yourself, you split the gain, but not the loss.
---
So, you have three ways to do this: one, multiboxing, with your main just following an alt around doing nothing; two, paying someone to slaughter centaurs while you follow them around doing nothing; or three, forming groups with friends/guildies/randoms doing the grind in Desolace and following them around without assisting at all.
---
Of course more people would do it. But I don't see how buying gold is a problem in itself (Other than it wasn't in classic and I understand that some people don't want it in there just because of that). Buying gold never will be a problem as long as the gold is not generated by Blizzard but taken from real people. 
---
But hacked accounts and stolen gold on shady sites is a really big problem. 
---
I don't see a problem in this either but the exchange rate wouldn't be 1:1 anyway so maybe Classic Gold gets so valuable that farming 100 Gold would be enough to get a Token. (hypothetical numbers)
---
This is assuming, that you only hate leveling, and not the grinding aspect in general.
---
If you're not in a hurry, then I'd suggest starting on a profession. Collecting mats for leveling a profession can make you forget a bit about leveling. This goes especially well for tailors, since they need to farm their cloth from mobs (which give exp).
---
If they implement it like 6 months after its more like a NY or Virginia policy, slaughtering them even after birth.
---
^^Just ^^trying ^^to ^^be ^^topical
---
Damn, that’s fucking cool.
---
I always knew of the ogre camp there, it’s where you get your first aid books for horde. Both ally and horde have quests right around the camp.
---
But never put two-and-two together and realized it was a refugee camp from Onyxia laying waste to them. Come to think of it, it does seem really scattered and beaten up, and there isn’t much of an ogre presence there.
---
Fucking awesome the original WoW guys have story and thought behind everything. Another reason to be hyped for Classic!
---
I usually just bind ‘shoot’ (wand) to mouse wheel as that’s most of what you do 
---
ya, it would be fun to me. A lot of my ideas this place liked I think but not so much this one.
---
I think WoW is a super fun game, but i've always be a die-hard fan of hardcore consequences to games. WoW could obviously have its own unique form of balance since world pvp is such a huge thing of course.
---
Tokens will be there. It's an effective way to combat gold sellers and Blizzard, obviously, does not want to spend more than necessary efforts on this game. Probably not from the start, but later, when economy somewhat establishes.
---
So you have tried it lots of times and always give up? Yet you claim you love the endgame you clearly havent played since you started in TBC. 
---
Reach max level in the first week. Control the market of an extremely specific high value item like devilsaur leather with a few other NEETS. You will have to play 14+ hours a day for a month at launch. You will be able to make enough gold for all your consumables BiS, mount and respecs for forever in that month.
---
This will only cost you your job, family and social life.
---
I'm not against the idea but I am against making custom fun servers for no apparent reason.
---
Just using the mind blast -&gt; SWP -&gt; Wand combo the last tick happens around a third of the time.
---
hardcore-design was a big thing back in EQ, DAOC, it was ruled out way back then but is technically a feasible concept that i know people enjoy
---
It doesn't bother you that some idiot that doesn't mind spending a bunch of real money can get massive advantages over sane people?
---
&gt;The design philosophy behind the project and the tenants to keep it safe are pointless.
---
t. r/wow
---
&gt;Adding graphical upgrades will do absolutely nothing to the gameplay. 
---
Other than compromise the stated goals in the video you're too ignorant to pay any attention too.
---
We have different definitions of badass. I know what you mean though lol 
---
Why would it be impossible? You can get the same loot twice for any given boss. It's unlikely but it's possible, no?
---
Fishing is involved in material gathering (potions), quests and a weekly contest.
---
It's not something that should be trivialized so you can easy fish and chat.
---
Cursor and sound should be vanilla like, no change.
---
1-2hr a week is like nothing you will likely hit lvl 30 by the time people have aq on farm :D. But i feel you im a med student aswell , trying to schedule ahead so i can get atleast 2 hrs a day in . But in your case id suggest playing a warrior since you will always be so far behind the curve so you are better off playing something that can tank &amp; start dungeon runs by yourself once you log incase you dont see any spam in lfg . So a paladin/druid/warrior would be best imo . Paladins &amp; druids are great for tanking dungeons &amp; people tend to need tanks for dungeons more &amp; more as time passes by &amp; server progresses and you always have the option of healing in your runs along the way incase you dont feel like starting a group yourself or you dont see  anyone looking for tanks.
---
&gt; The biggest difference would be gnomes. Gnomes look like happy fellas in classic rambling about their muderous rampage.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;In todays WoW they look grumpy and sad with huge drooping eyes and lachrymal sacs like a basset hound.  
---
&gt;Tauren do not look like they rip you apart like they did in WC3 and vanilla, but straight out of Disney. They look like Goofy.  
---
&gt;I would be sad if someone sees my character as something totally different than what they are supposed to look like.  
---
&gt;I  see where you are coming from, but I simply disagree. I oppose mods in shooters too in which on my screen you run around as russians wielding  PPSH and on their screen I'm a unicorn. I dont like that.
---
*than
---
Who gives a flying fuck what streamers do, rly ? I hope they dont add anything like that into the game, but jeesus, why would i care if a STREAMER quits. 
---
pretty sure there is a misunderstanding involved. you meant: 
---
same damage **per tick**, but longer duration(=more ticks).
---
While he understood: same **overall** damage, but spread out across 2 additional ticks = lower damage per tick.
---
Btt: ticks do the same damage, same coeffs and all, just 2 more "free" ticks, afaik.
---
I don't remember that. What does happen if you "look throught that window" ?
---
I had my eyes dead locked on playing a paladin a few months back .
---
But with some of the information coming along about how reckoning might work im kind of leaning towards mage,warlock,shaman,warrior atm.
---
Not being able to get &amp; keep stacks from sit spam is crap, kills like 50% of the fun shenanigans that you can do around the world or in bgs.
---
Audio books and podcasts.
---
I recommend Bill burrs Monday morning podcast. 
---
This shit is hilarious.
---
Also watch e sports and got Netflix. 
---
When I Leveled a paladin on p-server to see if leveling was as bad as I remembered, I watched a whole season of stranger things. 
---
WORTH
---
Would it be worth going tailoring and enchanting on a fresh server just to make bags and wands?
---
PVE classic basic resto spec + 8/8 T1 up until naxx pretty braindead to gear up or spec as resto 
---
Even better, getting that one expensive item that you are going to use for a LOONG time, you can literally grind in 1-2 days. Do it once and never look back.
---
Buying gold reinforces gold sellers to keep doing it, making the problem bigger. 
---
Also buying anything to give yourself an advantage goes against the entire classic wow philosophy. You work for it, one way or another.
---
Actually no. I believe, that the advantage is not that massive. Secondly Classic Gold will be expensive. All you do is paying someone that farms the gold for you. We do stuff like that in real life all the time by the way. 
---
As I said, as long there is no additional gold generated for selling purposes or the gold is stolen by hackers I think it is no problem. 
---
See it like this: You buy 200 gold via a token and buy yourself a Lionheart helm in the auction house. Now you have an advantage over others by spending money. If you wouldn't have bought the gold the other guy still had his 200 gold and could buy the same helmet. He chose to buy playtime instead an char upgrade. 
---
why is that bad?
---
I doubt a lot of players will play Retail. Does anyone know anyone who still plays Retail? BFA is the worst Expansion ever! Nobody still plays that crap!
---
&gt;The only difference between tokens and RMT is that people can pretend RMT isn't happening.
---
if the only way to buy gold is through shady 3rd party companies, with a very real risk of: getting permanently banned, getting hacked or getting scammed, then there is way less gold buying going on overall than if blizzard officially sanctions it through the token. Besides,  the token didn't even fix RMT, it is still happening to this very day. 
---
I am 100% convinced that we will see tokens in classic one day. You people have no idea how much money Blizzard makes from tokens and character services.
---
Wasn't naxx super hard?
---
Thanks mom!
---
Yes.
---
That is impossible. If you can buy it someone has to sell it. 50g per 1 month is way too cheap anyway. 
---
I miss the days before I knew about min / maxing DPS. Had a lot more fun.
---
You could have used the original manual: https://s3.amazonaws.com/szmanuals/b8446d3d6f34a651412bfa58a8198de8
---
page 66 (manual page)
---
I recommend getting sidetracked. Nothing quite as motivating as spending a few hours in wpvp handing ass and getting ass your handed to yourself and then starting to level up with extra motivation to outlevel the cun- eh cunning guys you added to your kill list for some easy gratification. 
---
Night elf female resto druid.

1/11/39 PvP/pve spec
---
I played dwarff hunter up to aq40 in vanilla, And dwarf shadow priest in tbc and undead nage in wotlk and quit near the end of wotlk.
---
Trading Classic gold for retail gold will definitely happen.
---
Mainly for recipes and special vendors.  Timbermaw rep is a big one to go for and you can start gaining it once you hit Felwood in the low 50's.
---
They wouldn't but the people that play the game will. People WILL be trading their retail gold for classic gold (just look at osrs and rs3, or even across different games). So technically you could trade your classic gold for retail gold and buy a token that way and get gametime for classic.
---
Not really. It took a lot of work to get there over many months due to linear progression and no gear catch-ups but the fights themselves didn't have many mechanics. My guild for example had a lot of mouth breathers and we killed everything up to the four horsemen and were stopped by a surprise 8 tank requirement, we had like three :)
---
I don't think we would've been able to kill a single one of these mythic bosses, it would be a miserable experience. 
---
I'm living out the fantasy I never got as a healer as I was dps but otherwise sammmmme
---
Yeah we didn't use much of that back in the day. Wonky gear, no world buffs and limited consumables. I wonder how far you would get like that today :D
---
&gt; Besides, that kind of trading seems just impossible to prevent anyway. How could you stop anyone doing this?
---
You don't. That's the point he's trying to make. What people are saying in this thread is that they don't want wow tokens in Classic. BUT at the same time it is possible to trade your classic gold for retail gold and buy a token that way (and get game time for classic consequently).
---
https://youtu.be/xAId8qZdgZY Hirumaredx has you covered
---
Great clarification. Thanks.
---
I also remember the talent as adding two "free" ticks of the same amount of damage as previous ticks.
---
Overall I think the talent is pretty nice. It gives your SWP more damage pr mana. The DPS stays the same though.
---
This will kill the economy day 1. Not just because gold is hyperinflated in retail, also because being able to pour money into a fresh realm from an older realm will fuck up the entire economy
---
It kills you very quickly with high lava DMG.
---
The thing with that is there's always going to be demand from people who want to skip ahead, I don't like it personally but it's going to be there. The way I see it there's Blizzard's token where gold is traded for gametime with that gold going to another player, the effort to grind that gold has already happened, someone had to earn that gold (legitimately with effort) to pay for their game time and it's gone to someone else who has paid real money for it.
---
The other option is a Chinese gold seller, without a token there's a gap in the market where gold seller companies run bots farming ore, skinning, herbing and grinding mobs driving the prices down because of the mass influx of these resources. These bots can be banned but the gold farming companies have shown great resourcefulness in manipulating the game to get their bots running, also by the time they are banned the gold inflation has already taken place.
---
The base of my argument is with a wow token, someone has earned that gold, it's taken time and is traded to another player who gives blizzard real money that buys that original player another month of WoW. Chinese gold sellers are harmful and will exploit an open market.
---
I used add ons in vanilla.
---
 Female trolls has a straight posture afaik.
---
Yeah I think warlocks are the exception.
---
Find goals along the way to reach and exceed.  Level in another race's zone to earn their mount for a more interesting combo. Mix in some dungeons and PvP, or just zone out some while watching TV.  Personally I'm going to do a bit of each while me and a coworker no-life it for a few days, solid warrior/priest leveling combo.
---
I don't mean directly transferring your retail gold to a classic account, ofcourse that won't happen. But someone giving you gold on retail and them paying you back on classic by means of an exchange rate.
---
They did not. They still spam and gold sellers still present. But it's not so adamant. I still remember websites written with dead gnomes in Stormwind. That was hilarious.
---
Ni hao that's my furbolg!
---
Wait so you're saying that this build is viable straight at 60 for dungeons? I was thinking I need spiritual healing at 60 for the plus healing. But I guess the 2130 build isn't necessary until after molten core
---
1. Scale. While I don't understand it, apparently a lot of people fear "ban" and don't buy gold from goldsellers while they would buy it from Blizzard.
---
2. BoE. There are many good BoE gear in vanilla. So you'll have higher advantage than in retail.
---
You act like the opinions on Reddit for how the game should be is the best version of WoW. 
---
Little arrogant and close minded if you ask me. 
---
Try getting exalted with the Darkmoon Faire.  That should keep you busy for a while.
---
Certainly better than what exists now.
---
Retail went down a very extreme path in raid/encounter design where they focus almost exclusively on twitch/reaction speed gameplay and piling on layers of mechanics. That said, sub-mythic you can just ignore half the mechanics. The game is designed now to encourage people to jump in to the game - farm a set of whatever catchup/welfare gear is on offer, and be able to go clear everything. Since all most people care about is LFR - Heroic many unsub after a few weeks at max level until the cycle starts again.
---
Hard gear progression/progress through tiers has been eliminated. The need for a guild for anything but Mythic has been eliminated. Mythic itself doesn’t have enough participation to justify its existence - in my opinion its there to keep streamers/influencers/addons developers etc. playing and talking about the game because this crowd are mostly hardcore gamers. Most of these mythic guys have their head in the sand - they are the minority that enjoy the new encounter design and are fine with the whole rest of the game turning into Hello Kitty Island Adventure as long as they keep getting new raids.
---
Never said it's the best version, just how the people on this sub like it. I don't get what you're trying to say?
---
minmaxing your main is not bad...but be able to minmax 4 char , spam island and m+between raids to change for each boss during mythic race...thats cancer
---
There are items for sale, enchants, recipes for professions and more rarely mounts. It's worth doing the grind for some.
---
Exalted with Argent Dawn makes Naxx atunement free.
---
I was also in Silithus when I first hit 60 with my mage.  Started in late May 2006 and hit 60 in September.  I don't remember at all what my /played was.  
---
Wintersaber (if you're alliance), Bloodsail and Timbermaw exalted rep are the most well known grinds that can be done casually.  
---
Other than that, there are: Brood of Nozdormu, Thorium Brotherhood (not as difficult if the repeatable Searing Gorge quests are in), Hydraxian Waterlords, and The Argent Dawn. Some of these reps are easier than others.
---
It's so unlikely I doubt it's ever happened
---
Ah yea, tho theres little difference to just buying gold, you just spend retail gold instead if actual casv
---
Looking at all the Classic Reddit Posts It is in fact (generally speaking) the best version of WoW we can get. There is little arrogance there.
---
I made a 49 shaman twink in vanilla and let my friend try out wow with this character. I handed him my chair, inside Gadgetzan, and immediately his attention was diverted to a level 60 gnome mage sitting on his mount. My friend was impressed by him and asked "how do I inspect his gear?" while simultaneously guessing it must be right click...
---
Sure enough he activates auto attack and blows the level 60 mage up in one swing with a windfury proc and the goblin guards immediately trap him with nets and murder him as I literally fell to the floor laughing and him confused! :D
---
I enjoy the fight as a druid. 
---
The dead horse we've been beating must be unrecognizable at this point.
---
sry, i just cant comprehend, cause i just love the whole leveling phase.
---
It's the same super hard as solo RPGs. If load in the first time, you will have a bad time if you stumble into an ogre cave or face off with a skeleton lord. 
---
But once you have 40levels under your belt, they still hurt like hell, but you can outplay them.
---
The same applies to Naxxramas. You have to put in the work to get there, but the gear goes a long way. 
---
Just like an RPG is supposed to be. Not the skill-over-9000-simulator, but a mixture of dedication and skill.
---
Nah I don't agree with that. Mythic is perfectly fine for hardcore players that goes for world/realm first achievements and stuff, the problem is the new gear system and how unrewarding it is. In the beginning of BfA when I played, I got a piece of gear I wanted for a while but it didn't upgrade with the stupid ass titanforged stuff so I kept my old upgraded dungeon piece because it gave the same dps output in an encounter. So I had to re-do the same raid until I finally got it titanforged, such a ridiculous system.
---
Not to mention that you can't even be the "cool guy" and show off your mythic raid gear because people doesn't give a shit anymore. Raiding on a professional level for  stuff like world firsts is literally the only reason to do mythic raids nowadays if you ask me. This alone makes raiding in classic MUCH more fun than retail for me, by far.
---
You won't be "fighting" for anything. If you haven't noticed yet blizzard is going to do whatever will make them the most money, not what a subreddit poster wants.
---
And the fly can use a divine shield.
---
I like humans description:
---
-Human..
---
That's objectively the wrong way to read his post.
---
And you still have to pick a name!
---
Well, to be fair.  When everything launches, the majority of the population will reach leveling spots at the same time.  And as STV is the classic bottleneck, classic will likely have that action, at least for a little while. 
---
Most definitely. It's not just the insane difficulty of mythic raids that makes vanilla raids more fun, the character progression and standing on the Ironforge bridge in your gear absolutely made it feel more rewarding. Gear in modern WoW is completely destroyed to the point that it's pointless. 
---
Probably makes for some amazing tender meat
---
if you consider vanilla PVE good then no wonder you prefer no difficulty  
---
You'll observe all sorts of things that blew over your head when you started playing at first.  I just realized that you only ever see Furbolgs in the northern zones of Kalimdor, Silithid only in the south, etc.
---
I don't care too much about people paying for game time. It's people funnelling gold from retail -&gt; classic that would wreck things.
---
What gives you the power to decide how people want to play the game?
---
But its often enough that its frustrating. I get ganked maybe a few times a day, and I avoid pvp hotspots like STV like the plague.
---
I'm even considering going to Desolace just so I can be alone.
---
Because the person who farmed that initial 200 gold is the rightful  owner of the currency. They put in the hours in the actual game, that I don't have an issue with.
---
The person who buys it from him however, didn't need to spend any time in the game. So suddenly, some clown who barely plays the game can be richer than people who put effort in to it.
---
It ruins the fun for me completely, why would I spend many hours farming gold or collecting materials to craft or buy what I want, when I could just spend a small amount of real money and get it instantly?
---
However, if those avenues of getting gold without playing is stopped as much as possible, that in game currency is a lot more desirable to personally farm out, and keeps the game interesting.
---
We will never completely 100% remove gold selling, but I'd much rather have a small amount of it done "illegally" than having it be a part of the game. Suddenly, every piece of gold in the game will be converted to dollars in your head, and you lose the point of the game.
---
Fucking care bear stare.
---
The classic crowd is desperate for anything they can learn or anything that brings them closer to the official release. (Myself included) that's why these things keep popping up and my YouTube feed is full of class leveling guides
---
Exactly. I've always said that there should be a 50/50 split between me the player and my character about who overcome the encounter. In the modern game it has swung way to far towards me the player. 
---
Will definitively get those, lupos is best for pvp if they keep him ignoring armor right?
---
On my characters I'd take a break at level 19, 29, etc. to do battlegrounds. 
---
There's some good stuff to get from that too. I leveled a new character in late vanilla and did a lot of WSG at 29. I hit Friendly with the WSG faction, which allows you to get [a neat trinket](https://classicdb.ch/?item=21566) very early on, and had enough honor to unlock the rank 2 trinket as well.
---
Looking back, I treated WoW like the other MMORPGs I played before it. Most of them had theoretical max levels that were impossible to reach, and so I'd hang out at lower levels to do things other than leveling. WoW was actually pretty good for that. There were professions to level, PvP and a lot of exploring in zones of the other faction. Lots of MMORPGs were nothing but a pure grind.
---
neckbeard* mafia
---
FTFY
---
Thanks, saved it!
---
&gt; they saw it becoming an issue again or they would not be doing this.
---
wrong. the reason they did this is because they thought casual players would find it cool you could trade BoPs within x amount of time. Typical out-of-touch Blizzard fuck up
---
&gt; This is not an ideal solution
---
agreed
---
&gt; it requires no dev time
---
wrong, they will have to recode things specifically for this model of vanilla and this server architecture
---
&gt; But they will not be paying an army of GM's to deal with classic
---
agreed, which is why the easiest solution that basically the entire community is on-board with is, Blizzard will not intervene with loot trading. Done and done. No babying, no parenting by Blizzard.
---
We're all grown ups here, if someone clicks need TWICE and steals loot treat them as a ninja, blacklist them and move on, no error bullshit here. The games been out for 10 years we know how the fucking need rolling works.
---
You are gonna be a full time alt! Why not? /cheer
---
This is the true super-awesome way to level. Highly recommend it.
---
Gold translates into power much more directly in vanilla. Gold isn't as pay to win in more recent expansions by a long shot
---
wow, that's kinda amazing, and I thought the winetspring frostsaber grind was the worst (but at least that one can be done solo)
---
Cool story, bro 
---
Hyacinth Macaw....1/10.000 drop chance, so yes...quite the grind :D
---
And people may not even recognize it...
---
Why?
---
That really will depend on if they go with Vanilla population caps or not. If they do i don't see STV as becoming a bottleneck at all to be fair. It wasn't on US server launch in 2004, it wasn't on EU launch in 2005, i've only ever seen STV becoming a real bottleneck on pservers with 4 to 6 times the number of ppl online corrently than the Vanilla experience is designed for.  
---
Darkspear are supposed to be taller than Tauren when standing straight. But Zandalari are even taller.
---
It always seemed a bit odd to me how much high level content was centered around Blackrock Mountain - arguably the two biggest dungeons in the game and two of the first three raids. There's about as much level 60 content around Blackrock mountain as there is in all of Kalimdor.
---
It takes no dev time, it is already base in the version of the game they are building classic on. Secondly did you miss the part where even saying "We won't fix loot" doesn't stop them from wading through tickets asking them to? That takes time, and is a departure from how they have acted since day one. They have always fixed loot issues, changing that now would be a kick in the nuts and make a lot of people mad. 
---
You place a lot of blame, acting as if they are doing this for casuals but misloots were historically a problem they had to deal with on a regular basis, this fixes it with a minimum of staff which is why they like it.
---
Classic WoW economy is so perfectly balanced. 
---
Last thing they want to do is fuck with it like this.
---
Same here.  It was epic.
---
&gt; I'm going to buy gold regardless if it's from the chinese or from another player
---
Then I hope Blizzard successfully detects and bans your ass.
---
It's against the ToS for little rich kids to whip out daddy's wallet and buy characters, items, gold, etc..
---
You might even say its insane to do such a thing
---
That drop chance may not be right. In retail, I believe it's an STV zone wide drop with very low chance (8000-10000). It used to ONLY drop from certain pirates, but I believe at a slightly higher chance. I know I felt lucky to get it after about 2500 kills, but I think (although am struggling to find vanilla info) it was more around a 5000 drop rate?
---
I have this same memory except as a low 60s character in hellfire peninsula in TBC. About 3 or 4 of us vs 1 level 70 in the PvP Towers area. 
---
As i recall much of the difficulty was gearing and the rest of it came from the overall pace of the game in general. TBC was Announced and shortened the window on Naxx and the people that wanted to work through all the bosses and gear levels to kill some of the bosses.
---
&gt; I will unsub, uninstall bnet, and never buy from blizzard or activation for the rest of my life. This is not a negotiation. Don't fuck this up.
---
I feel the exact same way.
---
Classic is possibly the last chance I will give money to modern-day Blizzard.
---
If they introduce cash shop or token, or even if they keep this fucking tradeable BoP Loot Change, I will likely unsub and turn my back on Blizzard for good.
---
Why skip stvietnam? Its one of the best zones
---
I remember watching G4 do half an episode of cheat on that fucking welp
---
Please please please...double the subscription cost and let me play a game unadulterated by bullshit. I play games to escape the world, having to periodically swipe my credit card while playing ruins the escape. 
---
I play on a P server and it happens enough that leveling (my favorite part of the game) is a total turn off for me. 
---
I'm here for the journey, not for the end goal. I want to enjoy leveling as much as I want to enjoy endgame content. So, I won't rush anything.
---
My dad is dead but I got rich all on my own so it's fine. I've never been banned for buying gold, it's insanely easy to get away with. 
---
Raided endgame with rogue on private server for a couple of years, i think its the most fun and allaround class (also had 60 mage alt and 60 priest on another server). In vanilla i played hunter/warrior.
---
Lul 
---
Stv is what made me love vanilla. In fact I don't think I have ever got a char over lvl 42 because of stv. Shits fun as hell
---
I vaguely remember 3% of players even getting attuned and much less than that clearing the raid. Can't find any source for those stats right now though.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8kcgtt/the_real_list_of_59_useu_guilds_that_cleared_naxx/
---
If these figures are right that's not even 6000 players that cleared it out of 4-5 million.
---
Duskwood and tanaris unlikely to last 10 levels.
---
not really an issue.
---
Retail and Classic are different games and not linked in any way. This would be the same as trading CS:GO items for Classic WoW gold. People can trade avocados for Classic gold too. Doesn't really matter that much here.
---
&gt;Token sellers transfer gold from one player to another, they aren't necessarily creating gold.
---
it still incentivizes people to farm more gold so they can sell token for free subs etc. It still leads to more total gold in the system.
---
Letting the zones between 10-40 last for 10 levels each is probably not viable, unless you plan on farming mobs for 5 levels every 5 level
---
 when my friends started playing 4 of us were night elves and one was a human priest. We would shadowmeld by the road and have our priest mate attack mobs close by hoping that someone would come. As per usual someone would always attack once our priest was fighting a mob but that's what we wanted. Absolute domination; they never stood a chance. This was Pvp server but we preferred going after the folk that attacked first. Good times. 
---
Lol
---
In general, -5% discount for stuff sold per rep level (or was it 10% at honored plain, don't remember).
---
Thoriym - BS recipes, a must for any decent BS.
---
Some stuff from Timbermaw Hold - also a must for professions (like ench recipes).
---
Any raid-dependant rep (especially ZG) provides you with a fine stuff like chants and seldomly fine gear.
---
Argent Dawn - some stuff, free way to Naxx and an 18-slot free bag (one of 4 present in game).
---
The best thing to do is go buy a second LCD monitor so you can watch some series whilst you play.
---
There are some really good new ones coming out this year, one called Lost and also one called Entourage that looks like it will be good. 
---
If you can't watch whilst playing, maybe just listen to some music, the new Greenday album is meant to be really good 
---
You said you experienced it on a server that just launched with a thousand still leveling.  I imagine most servers that launch will have a cap above 1000 players and guess what?  Everyone will be leveling 
---
They are linked on the subscription. People can trade whatever they want, sure, and it won’t be a problem if there isn’t anyone willing. I assume there will be. You assume there won’t. What is the problem with having wow tokens in classic in the first place then ? The only thing you add is one more link. 
---
Yeah, but buying from them runs the risk of destroying your account, just because spammed are annoying doesn't mean the entire culture should shift and ruin the game itself 
---
Well you should know that you won't be able to push 10 levels in any zone, Barrens is the largest zone and that IN TOTAL will only get you \~8 levels and you will have to go to other zones in-between obviously.
---
This is wonderful trolling. Have an upvote.
---
I wish they would've gone through with this open world raid kinda concept with the entire crypt system.
---
best /sit animation too.
---
Best thing to do is run to Westfall and swim to STV, bypassing Duskwood entirely.
---
Calm down people they aren’t going to do that. There will probably be a couple goofy little things that we think is dumb but they won’t be game breaking. 
---
Private servers are way different from what vanilla was actually like, despite what they may tell you.  
---
&gt; say Black dragons are behind this and they have been up to no good within the alliance, turns out Onyxia was working to destroy her from within. Now she moved right next door, sorry dont want her there so we should kill her. Go talk to Rexxar he knows how to sneak into the Black Dragon flights lair"
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; 5) Rexxar: "You need magic illusions, go talk to this crazy hag about it"
---
&gt; 6) Old hag: "I need dragon eyes to help you, go to UBRS and get me some"
---
&gt; 7) Old hag: "Here is a disguise, go talk to Emberstrife (Black Dragon) and he will test you to see if you are worthy to join the black dragon flight elites!"
---
Jaina is also friends with Thrall in Vanilla. Basing this off WCIII and assuming nothing really changed that in the 10 years between TFT and Vanilla timeline.
---
Using glider in silithus for thousands of dollars as a 14 y/o was lit. 
---
Classic reddit has 50k subscribers and retail wow had 930k.
---
But there is no new classic info to talk about, only plans and memories.
---
But I would guess 70/30 aswell.
---
Yeah these routes will probably not work out perfectly depending on your willingness to grind flat exp and to do dungeons. 
---
I recently lvled a new char with my roommate on a private server and went for your first route.  We did almost every quest in Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge and Duskwood until lvl 30, cleared DM and stormwind stockades and still had to grind atleast half a lvl in every zone we went.
---
It also depends on rested-bonus exp and drop rates of certain quest items.
---
Get the 4 18 slot bags
---
&gt; I will use the initial hype when the game is released to reach level 30 then just before leveling gets tedious 
---
Ironically, 1-30 are the most tedious levels.
---
What interview are you referencing?
---
Thats style!
---
You never buy gold on your main account. That's just brain dead 
---
I plan on trying it for fun but I don't think it would be a problem. In 2005 no one went 21/30 as a fresh 60 priest, no +healing BiS min-maxing either, and dungeons were healed fine.
---
Spiritual healing would be nice but at the dungeon level it basically translates into mana efficiency.
---
On servers like Nost I don't remember PI priests having problems in high hps pulls like in DM:W.
---
Huh? What are you on about? 
---
Don't.
---
The best way to make money in the first month is to invest. That means spending all your gold on items that will be worth 100% more later. I'm not going to give you any hints but there are items, particularly between levels 40-55 that will sell for much more in a few months. There are also some lower level areas. Anytime you want/have to grind out some exp go to one of these spots to farm. Bank those items and forget about them. Check the AH for these items which you can probably bid snipe because nobody is using them yet. Some people will put them up as they get them while others post at market value when they are actually being consumed. This will drive the prices down by at least 50%. 
---
If you play a lock/pal spend all that money you save. If you play a sham/druid/hunter don't worry about spending money on your mount its only a 20% increase. Its really more of a right of passage and a badge of honor. In return you'll either have raid mats for months, or your epic mount before most people.
---
Ok, good to know :D 
---
that still doesn't matter. their economies are completely separate and the fact they share a sub doesn't have an impact on Classic economy in any way. 
---
The impact of people trading classic gold for retail gold will be insignificant. 
---
The problem with introducing tokens in Classic is a big one. Did you ever play Classic or have you ever played on private servers?
---
The Classic economy is one of, if not THE, best MMO economy hands down.
---
Shit is expensive, gold is valuable, people struggle to pay for skills let alone fresh items, there are plenty of gold sinks like repairing, mounts, consumables, inflation never rears its ugly head in vanilla. 
---
The ecosystem is so perfectly and delicately balanced, and it should be because Blizzard hired legit economists to help create it. 
---
If you introduce a new gold sink, like buying tokens with in-game gold, or a new gold source, like selling tokens for in-game gold, it will (1) totally fuck up the economy and (2) remove the entire point of Classic, which is that you must work hard for everything you get
---
Is this how the Karazhan tower actually looked like in Vanilla? Never went there pre TBC... :(
---
That's not vanilla karazhan tho, it's some alpha or beta.
---
All of them.
---
There's some old "lore" (I can never find or remember the source) that says Trolls stay hunched/crouched as a way of not intimidating or looking down on their fellow Horde counterparts. 
---
10% base mana means you are regenerating with that mp5 for 10% longer before you run out of mana...
---
OK, do you pay for it with the same credit card? Same name on the cc? How long does the gold sit there? At some point it needs to benefit a main account. Blizzard slapping down level one accounts for buying gold is retarded. 
---
Because he will enjoy the game way longer than we would do elsewise. 
---
&gt;Also, 29 affliction lock is fun, nightfall procs give nice shadowbolts ontop of dotting while staying mobile. They also hit hard at that level.
---
The caster gear at 29 sucks ass. If you want to do damage you stack +shadow damage gear and have half the hp of other twinks. It's decent if you can hide behind your teammates the entire game but locks are free kills for rogues and hunters at that bracket. 
---
Convenient how you left out the 'for me' part in your quote ...
---
apparently in Classic he will deal regular damage and will therefore be the same as any other wolf his level
---
Rip
---
Every. Single. Time
---
Yes true.. what I meant was that random people could come in at any time and disrupt it so it was impossible for you to do say, an organized 2v2 or 3v3 against another team.
---
You can't understand how being difficult can mean fun, really?
---
Nothing is wrong with leveling fury. I enjoy leveling fury up until you can get MS then I respec usually. MS is just pretty powerful. Arms also tends to favor 2hers which generally you'll want to use as fury or arms since its often easier to get 1 good 2her rather than 2 good 1h weapons. If you're leveling on a PVE realm fury is prefectly fine, but on PVP arms is pretty much the go to. In general I think arms has an easier leveling experience past about 40.
---
The thing to look out for is getting your mount at level 40. If you get twice the XP, you're getting half the gold/level. So you'll want to do something like 35-40 in a sprint without rest XP. 
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I disagree... Up until level 25ish the levels come pretty fast and furious.  Around level 30 you are still getting cool abilities but you're also still running everywhere and there are fewer hubs where there are like 5 quests at once that you can do.  A lot more running between zones and traveling all over the world, whereas up til level 20-25 you're only in perhaps 3 or 4 different zones that are all immediately touching the starting area or one zone over.  
---
As Horde for example you can level to 30 without ever going to Eastern Kingdoms (Barrens -&gt; Ashenvale -&gt; South Barrens -&gt; 1K needles) so there's very little travel time. 
---
Whats the best route for an orc?
---
This is a great climax but I think the best questline is the Sceptre of the Shifting Sands one
---
Now THAT is definitely wrong. Do the math again, man. 
---
Example for you: you have 5k mana and get 5k from pots/regen. That's 10k mana. Now add 10% to your base mana. Oh look, it's 500 mana, or 5% of your total mana. And as the fight continues, this number continues to drop while the effect of +heal remains.
---
I really advise on doing math when u wanna make decisions like that (not just talents, but gear too). The other priests might like you if you take the crappy gear, but you will not find yourself successful in raids.
---
Is he talking about Blessing of Protection or the TBC indirect taunt spell?
---
&gt; wading through tickets asking them to?
---
this is a seriously tiny insignificant issue you think is really going to be a huge bog down to their massive support team? come on man, common sense.
---
making a rule saying "BoPs are final, thats it, no trading"  eliminates all that work and no, millions of people are not gonna suddenly file tickets anyway. 
---
Different credit cards, one personal one company. I usually buy expensive stuff off the AH and put it up again a lot cheaper for my main to buy. It's very easy to get around. 
---
fluctuating, at the start of vanilla 90/10 vanilla/retail, 3 months later 70/30, retail content patches will sometimes push it back to 50/50 40/60, so in the biginning in favor of vanilla because of veterans returning, countless new content streaming/media wise. over time it will shift back to retail and i thinks that will be interessting because maybe we see some vanilla "mechanics" returning to retail in some form.
---
Yes they will, I don't know what give you the idea that that would ever be a final word in people's minds. They have been fixing it for 14 years, nobody will abide by it. They don't have a massive support team, that's the point. They are not going to pay for a huge amount of support for classic, this is their solution. It isn't the best solution, but it won't cause the problems people seem to think it will. 
---
Yeah IMO that was one of the parts of Vanilla that made the world feel so tremendous and exciting to explore. Beyond the map itself that was already the most massive gaming experience one could fathom, the fact that there was MORE STUFF on the map that you didn't know what it was or what its purpose was.. that was so cool.
---
Examples I can think of: Silithus, Mount Hyjal, Uld..um? Ulduar? something liek that.. Caverns of Time, Karazhan, hell, THE DARK PORTAL WAS ACTUALLY A THING...
---
I think thats a huge part of why I've lost so much interest in retail. New content is.. new. They have just started forging new worlds and islands left and right.
---
I'm looking forward to saying "ding" all the way to 60. Each level past the first 5 took some decent time. Each level was relatively exciting. 
---
I do what I feel like. I level about a dozen 60s in vanilla and never had a staple route. I usually help out friends and grind dungeons each level zone until I get all the gear I want. It's all about the journey and memes for me.
---
If you look at Human males, there's no way they're 180lbs. More like 300lbs+ judging by the size of those arms.
---
I don't agree with leveling being hard but what it is on the other hand is rewarding and that's its main strength. In fact all aspects of the game is rewarding, almost nothing in modern WoW feels rewarding.
---
The leveling is obviously miles more difficult than BfA leveling though, I don't know what kind of lobotomized squid that shit was designed for. 
---
Not to be a Dick.. But i kinda hope blizzard flips the script and changes everything to make all these guides useless.
---
The solution that results in the least tickets, and least stress on support team, is simply to have a "no loot change" policy
---
are you seriously arguing otherwise?
---
I agree it shouldn’t be implemented but I still believe there will be a natural equilibrium for classic to retail gold and indirectly real life money . I think it will be taken advantage of . I hope as you say it won’t have a huge impact but with the aging player base with limited time and money to spend I have my doubts.
---
It was a joke friendo 
---
This comment was unnecessarily aggressive, regardless of whether what I said was right or wrong.
---
That’s how I remember it looking in Vanilla. Maybe I’m wrong but my memory is that it looked different than it did in TBC.
---
Grats!
---
Usually unique stuff to that faction, however the most important benefit of all is of course e-peen.  :D
---
And because leveling in Vanilla WoW is a blast if you aren't grinding/rushing through it. Read some quests, sit back, and enjoy the ride.
---
Not the point of my comment
---
Also remember in classic there is no damage reduction for pets, they take the same damage you do and will be dead a lot unless healers heal them.
---
Searing Gorge/Blackrock Mountain, just as an addition to what people already listed.
---
I used to have a lot of encounters on the border of the Barrens and 1k Needles. There were 2 dungeons both factions would do while leveling there, and crossing over to and from 1k needles would keep you flagged for PvP for at least 5 minutes even if you were Horde. I've had a few funny fights on the lifts themselves there. 
---
nah it only looked like that in alpha/maybe in beta. In live it always looked as it does now :) 
---
No thats not what i said, i said it wasn't experienced on US launch back in 2004 as far as i know (on servers with +-2500 players caps), i didn't experience it myself at EU launch early 2005 (again on servers with +-2500 player caps), i've only experienced it on Nost and later Pservers which had no real players caps and had non blizzlike population concurrently online of 10+ to 15K+ players. So basicly 4 to 6 times as many ppl leveling as in 2004 / 2005.
---
This is an example of "added content" I'd be OK with seeing down the road.  I don't want new continents or "new" zones, but I'd be totally 100% OK with developing existing content framework.
---
E.g., Karazhan, Grim Batol, the area south of Un'Goro, etc.  I'd even be OK with something like Kul'tiras being added **IF** it was made part of Eastern Kingdoms (i.e., it's pre-Cataclysm location), rather than a separate continent/loading area.  Etc.
---
&gt; Retail is one average expansion away from recapturing most of its current base back tbh.
---
I'd even argue it's one good content patch away from getting back to the Legion status quo. Particularly when flying is reintroduced. I don't love flying mounts, but I recognize it's a big draw for a lot of people who hate running around on the ground for whatever reason. 
---
Okay, thank you :)
---
That fork in the path that leads to the Horde village in Stonetalon... soooo many NElf hunters hiding and ambushing...
---
I killed a very large number of potentially friendly furbolgs on my way to winter spring before I realized I should have been trying to make friends.... that was a grind and a half. 
---
The problem isn't that they added new content - the problem is that they added it in a way that made the old content obsolete.  They made it "separate" from the existing world.
---
Well since he made a personal and therefor subjective comment on leveling there is really no point to be made...
---
Tbh, i would say do more dungeons then what u normally do, group up with people, join discord voice coms with people you level with, use guides/addons to opitimze leveling speed, make a 19 twink if you like pvp and want "something" else to do if it goes to slow.
---
Exactly! The fact that there was stuff in the world that I know I'd probably never even go to made the world feel _real_ and immersive.  
---
I got a 3 day ban on this sub for the same [joke](https://reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/adejyo/trust_me_kiddo_you_dont_wanna_know/edi77nj)
---
&gt;You would need an automated way to find shady trades.
---
There are, I've been contacted by a GM multiple times and I know of others on who were flagged and temp banned mid-raid by these systems while hosting gdkp or title/mount carry raids in Wrath/Cata.
---
*see whelp* “whoever that guy is, he must be one tough badass 
---
Ah, the user I replied to referenced 1k players.  I'm not saying there will be the large-scale ganking that existed with the larger private servers.  But acting like ganking will rarely/never happen once the vanilla servers primary pop reaches STV seems naive to me.
---
Yeah you had to go on an insanely long journey to get there. If you didn't get into a good guild early there was almost no chance of you getting there on time. That's why Blizzard started introducing catch up mechanics to the game. 
---
To each their own. I certainly won't dispute that some like twitch gameplay. I certainly don't.
---
That's part of why I'm looking forward to Classic.
---
90% sure this is alpha WoW, not Vanilla.
---
I think it was just 10% at honored,  20% at exalted in vanilla
---
Lol everybody should lighten up.  I think they forget how brutal wow chat is. 
---
There’s one key thing I would recommend you change with this plan!   
---
No life it to 40, or more specifically to buying your mount if possible.
---
I personally think it’s a great plan and you have more time with the game than just bumrushing everything. However, in my experience it’s much easier to take it slow and mess around with things like leveling professions without the impending mount cost looming over your head. 
---
I guess it’s not easier per se I just find it to be more enjoyable. 
---
Even if you don’t no life it though you’ll still get there eventually. That’s the beautiful part so have fun. 
---
(Skinning until 40 for more vendor trash is the bulletproof way to get your mount money regardless of server economy. I personally drop it after buying my mount.)
---
Yeah probably. The whole abandonware argument won't hold up after Classic is released. It will still be annoying for them to have to do so I'd imagine, so it's still in their best interest not to fuck up Classic.
---
They can't do much if their law won't apply to them. Nost got shut down because it did.
---
Sure, it’s great for casual players. That’s the point of it. 
---
Why do you think they are all hosted in Eastern Europe?
---
Blizzard cease and desist means nothing there.
---
Karazhan was intended to be in Vanilla, and was pretty much built but didn't make it to launch. For some reason it went on the backburner and came to in TBC. Getting Karazhan is thus not a totally wild thing to happen.
---
Personally I'd love if the amount of dungeons first intended to be in the launch version actually made it. John Staats mentioned a list of 30-50 dungeons total. Not just max level dungeons, but things like 1 city-specific dungeon (Like RFC or Stockades).
---
I agree, but despite the fact that recent expansions screwed up the world and the lore of wow, I think they didnt really "forge" any new worlds or islands. Im not sure if Pandaria was ever mentioned in any game or canon book, but everything else was already a part of the Warcraft universe and also referred to in one way or another. 
---
So there's apparently been 3 total models of Kara, with the 3rd being the one used in BC. I'd be curious to see if additional content is added to classic if an older or just different version of Kara is used for a new 20 man.
---
This one is wayyy more menacing.
---
I hope they add this into Classic at some point. Kara was a really cool raid with great lore behind it
---
Yeah it's the worst. I can't stand games like Black Desert Online for example, that's not how MMORPG combat should be in my opinion. It should be slow and easy. Modern WoW combat is way too fast and while it's easy I wish it would be easier. Vanilla had it right in terms of pacing and difficulty in my opinion, TBC was alright but in wrath it started to get out of hand. 
---
No changes. Buffing cooperative fishing and in turn ruining the economy would not be Classic.
---
Time =/= difficulty 
---
Nothing hard about Vanilla levelling, just takes longer.
---
Holy moly! I never thought about it like that you’re absolutely right!
---
Or that sometimes cool places and areas existed but only had a tiny bit of relevance. But the world was so much cooler for having that place.
---
What comes to mind is the Tower of Azura in Elwynn. Super cool, the first time you had encountered a building like that. It has only a couple quests going on associated with Redridge, but damn if it wasn't a neat place. One of the best easter eggs in the South Park WoW episode.
---
I'm honestly planning on questing to 12 in the sharded zones, then grinding 50-75% of the time from 12-25~ish to avoid as much competition as possible. Past that, I'll hopefully be ahead of the pack, and I'll be able to quest up to 45-ish using guide routes while grinding mobs as I travel. I'm planning on taking a week off work to no-life. I figure I should be able to at least hit 45 by then, and past that I'll be more casually leveling to 60 over the rest of the month.
---
Right now I'm planning alliance, just because I found an ally guild recruiting on a RP-PvP server, but if I find a horde RP-PvP raiding guild with times that work for me I'll probably switch.
---
Well there's been multiple versions of Kara that were made, with only the 3rd version being used for BC. I'd be interested, if additional content is developed for Classic, for a different version of Kara that includes the crypts. 
---
First 20-30 levels you will play to reach 60, then you realise all the stuff that may not be optional and just play the game. Suddenly you hit 60.
---
Grinding or following a guide is bad for your mental health. 
---
idk if i'd ever call them golden but i don't know if they have plans of shutting down or not
---
no idea about, uh, "krono trigger" either
---
One thing to also wonder about is the mysterious Dragon Isles, which were included in the prototype map. Maybe it's a bit too generic a name and concept, but hey, it'd be something more.
---
I'll mostly play to relax, unwind and enjoy the sights. Slow, repetitive, easy gameplay is a big plus not a problem. I want it that way.
---
Not that I won't also enjoy some more intense gameplay in dungeons and raids but it's still way more strategic than any kind of reflex based. Just how I like it.
---
EPL chapel :\^)
---
Huge human sized chess pieces! 
---
Yeah but the rested XP doesn't affect quests, so it won't quite be half the gold.
---
Hopefully they'll fade away so classic has a huge playerbase
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Chen_Stormstout_(Warcraft_III)
---
I killed one while passing through un-goro and had it drop from a green bag.
---
This was in wotlk though. Dk if they buffed the droprate.
---
World pvp is the best.. When they launched nostalrius I played with two frieds, we rolled Priest, Warr, Mage.. Combination is so sick..   
---
We had one rule; no matter how many and what level its either them or us.. We could easily kill 6-8 of the same level because of experience in pvp, communication and roles.. 
---
Well there are no 20 man's in classic.
---
The bullshit is part of the fun. 
---
When you hit 60 what will you *really* remember about levelling? That one escort quest that was a pain in the ass?
---
I got to 40 on a private server a few months ago, and all of my memories from it are around crazy pvp experiences while levelling. Barely getting away from that skull level night elf warrior that was tearing through 20 of us poor low level alliance. Another time a priest running up to me yelling "help help!" While being yanked by two horde, and we turn it on them and win.
---
The emergent gameplay that comes from pvp is a massive part of the experience and should not be missed imo.
---
Idk if you have played retail or not, but modern leveling is nothing compared to vanilla in terms of difficulty. That's why i consider vanilla leveling to be hard.
---
I am with you man.
---
I completely agree. If I wanted stressful gameplay I'd play something like a fast paced competitive shooter. MMORPGs should be relaxing, sorta like tending to a garden, not dismantling a damn bomb. 
---
Yeah but the alternative is to make new content that doesn't make old content obsolete. Would you have as much fun in TBC if all the dungeons and raids gave gear equal in power to the gear available in vanilla? Some people would, but I personally think it would be much less fun.
---
Mulgore -&gt; Durotar -&gt; Tirisfal -&gt; Silverpine -&gt; Barrens -&gt; Stonetalon -&gt; Ashenvale -&gt; who knows?
---
But since he'll play less to get to 60 because all his kill exp is doubled, doesn't he get less out of the game?
---
Preach it bro 
---
When I can't find the quest I'll use thottbot.
---
Well, i know that Pandaren were a thing in generel. But i was wondering if Pandaria was mentioned explicitly.
---
Karazhan was never meant to be menacing, though.
---
I might be wrong but I remember one of his voice lines being "For pandaria!"
---
This will always be one of my very favorite raids.  So many memories!
---
Took me over a year of farming Midnight mount until it finally dropped. I was so surprised I almost fell off my chair lol.  I definitely got a screenshot of the treasured loot :)
---
Some people are actually serious. I got into an argument that ended with the guy threatening to assault me beause I disagreed with him when he said Blizz shouldnt have pve servers at all last week.
---
Yes, in this very subreddit.
---
U mean STVietnam?
---
Is it fun to get ganked and corpsecamped?
---
Easiest Ram/Wolf to get is the AV one.  Super easy exalted rep.
---
I'll watch like 6 full Netflix series while fishing
---
Agreed. I think most of the people who talk about how everyone should be on pvp servers are actually gankers. If you want to pvp there's battlegrounds, as you just said.
---
This brings back memories.  As a protection warrior on a PvP server, the last couple of levels were brutal to get.  
---
 I actually ended up hitting 60 in Karazhan, killing the trash outside.   No one was around, and I was able to level without getting constantly ganked!
---
I think you have to come up with creative ways to reward players in the new content.  Add new minor effects to spells, new enchants, etc.  Things that *supplement* the existing dungeons/raid rewards, but don't render them obsolete.
---
How were people being excluded from content? My guild never made it past the second boss in Naxx 40 but nobody was excluding me from the rest of it, we just couldn't get our shit together fast enough before TBC dropped. Memorable times trying though. I think you're way off here, classic with retail features or  philosophy is simply retail with less content as those changes by thier very nature fundamentally destroy what vanilla had to offer. No changes is the only way this won't be a waste of time for everybody involved.
---
As far as the 19 bracket goes, hunters are very overpowered, casters are just worse hunters especially warlocks. Rogues are very good and druids make good fcs especially since they can use the medicine pouch. Holy paladins and priests are decent healers. Other melee dps are pretty lackluster because you have nothing to move faster or get out of cc so any hunter can own you. You also die instantly to rogues so it's a pretty bad experience.
---
...ZG and AQ20?
---
LOL u aint leveling ten levels in places like UnGoro, Tanaris, Badlands, These are like 3-4 MAX.
---
Are you perhaps looking for a guild?
---
I'm in the process of creating one: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aklw9q/looking_for_group_monday_january_28_2019/ef5zhud/
---
Of course, we have other priorities too, apart from simply enjoying the game slowly, so I can understand if you have other preferences. But maybe you are interested. :)
---
Yeah and later on there's always Elemental Fire farmers.
---
Favourite instance ever. I'd like to see it as a lvl 60 10 man come classic. Maybe with ZG lvl loot orso.
---
hello Zul'Gurub
---
I'm not but thank you :)
---
I'm going to run a guild in my native language with a lot of people who played together in 2005.
---
Grim Batol in the Wetlands always intrigued me the most. Why was it protected by dragons!  
---
Imagine some level 20 something exploring the map and finding this and knowing just as much about it as everyone else in the game.  
---
Fascinated me to no end. 
---
He may be playing less in total in relation to his playtime, but i think in the long term he will eventually play longer than quite a few people who are rushing to 60 and burning out after 3 or 4 months.
---
In case youre implying that lvling is "the game" you might be right about getting less out of the game. But i think if lvling was OPs favourite thing to do in vanilla he probalby would approach classic servers in another way.
---
Ok hopefully classic playerbase is small and everyone stays on pservers?
---
*Shrug*
---
Haha that sounds like a blast.  Back in the day my friends and I attacked everyone.  I like to fight whenever possible generally, but usually dont worry about it on a server/expac release as pumping out levels is key.
---
I've been at work a long time haha.
---
There is, original Zul'Gurub.
---
&gt; It trivializes the economy
---
No it doesnt. Your time already had value, it was up to you to waste it how you please. The token system just lets people waste it at work and convert that into more engaging play time
---
Can't tell if this is sarcastic or not
---
On launch my friends were Nelfs, so I played Nelf too (priest), only this time I'll be human for that sweet 5% spirit buff. Yes I know fear ward makes dwarf preferable for priest in general, but for my play style I want slightly bigger heals and to go oom slightly less.
---
An alternative is to horde gathering mats because they will be worth more money as the player base and economy progress past a rested leveling character. I'd also recommend leveling 1-20 without rested, it can be done in like 20-24 hours played without being much effort. 1-30/35 is also not that daunting - beyond that reated is great. I'm actually leveling a character right now via rested (level 48) but would mention you should have another game to play while your char sits or have a main already 😉
---
Why does it mean nothing?
---
I wouldn't say that as all trolls except for zandalari stay hunched...
---
Exactly, but for clarity sake, it's actually an 18 second dot with 6 ticks. Two talent points makes it a 24 second dot with 8 ticks.
---
I guarantee you the top-level people are discussing tokens as we speak. 
---
*'Will the profit from classic WoW tokens outweigh the backlash we will see from the classic community?'*
---
If you really think Blizzard is above this sort of thing, you haven't been paying attention to the current state of retail.
---
Yeah I'm not going to do that. I might keep a few on me, but since I won't be raiding I see no reason why to farm those very much
---
If policing some behavior is completely ineffective, yeah, that is an excellent argument to stop policing.
---
I guarantee you the top-level people are discussing tokens as we speak.
---
I was born feral, so deal with it.
---
Haha 
---
Excellent post. There's a third major weakness of Elemental spec in raids. There are debuffs that increase shadow/fire/frost damage output but not nature. Curse of the elements (fire/frost) and curse of shadow (shadow/arcane) increase damage by 10% in addition to reducing the resistance of the target. Shadow Weaving gives shadow 15% more damage, same for Improved Scorch for fire, and Winter's Chill for frost is 10% more crit. Elemental has no nature damage equivalent to these buffs really since enh shamans won't be brought to raid for stormstrike.
---
I want some things different, some the same. I played priest before but only in WotLK, and as a Blelf. This time I'm changing teams, human priest healing for the Alliance!
---
I dunno I don't see much hate towards druids at least. Prot pallies on the other hand are still ripped into heavily it seems. 
---
Kek
---
Wait...Kara existed in Vanilla?  How did I miss it?  I only remember it from BC.  Where was it even located?
---
Where was Grim Batol pre Cata? The Highlands didnt exist in game then. 
---
Tauren are canonically average 10ft tall.
---
Confirmed on twitter by the Lore Historian(Sean copeland) when he was on twitter. 
---
I think it was originally intended as a 40 man actually. 
---
YES! Me too. And I was so excited for it in Cata only to be all "meh" when it finally came out.
---
thats a question for lawyers and not redditors, friendo
---
If anything, they could turn it into a special halloween event place too if they don't want to make "new" content.
---
Nope. This is pre launch Kara, Statts even talked about redesigning the exterior multiple times before launch. 
---
Yeah Grim Batol and Uldum always intrigued me in Vanilla. I thought Grim Batol would end up a new zone in the future or even a raid but it was disappointing that this really important lore location that goes all the way back to the Warcraft games, and was guarded by a large number of elite red dragons, ended up as nothing more than a dungeon in Cataclysm. 
---
I remember seeing these unused spots on the maps of Kalimdor and the Easter Kingdoms, and going to that valley in southern Tanaris where all those elite mountain giants were and always wondered what was inside that ruined tunnel you couldn’t access. 
---
You will make some but not a lot unless you spend time trying to dominate and reset the market. With trade spam and ah flipping. A lot of people will be doing it. I’d probably just make some coin to pay for skills and move on. 
---
Good memory, [you're right](https://youtu.be/028qkDLiyp4?t=29)
---
Literally never got past a rough landmass. None of the architecture was ever fleshed out. The Dream had more to it than Dragon Isles. 
---
International copyright laws do not exist and in this case, there is little Blizzard can do to get the servers shut down.  They can send cease and desist letters or even threaten lawsuits but unless the country the server is hosted in has any law stating it is illegal to host a game created outside their country, Blizzard doesn't have a leg to stand on.
---
If this was Blizz 10 years ago I'd have hope
---
But 2019 Blizz? Shit man.
---
It was on the eastern side of Wetlands. Basically a generic Dwarf Fort with a portal that you could not access
---
If Blizzard screws up Classic, then it will still apply.  If they start sharding capital cities, implement group finder, throw in dual spec, and make all the 2.0 class changes, it will certainly apply.
---
The reddit hivemind directive is taking you over! Don't let that happen....don't let downvotes discourage you from speaking your mind. Keep a free will. Stay strong!
---
I think the question was, if Blizzard screws up classic.
---
Yeah I really want to avoid this bracket for all of those reasons. I have memories have having 700hp character and getting killed by a rogue with 1500.
---
I plan to start at 1 and end at 60.
---
So more or less it's current location. I think they just flipped which side of the mountain range the entrance is on. I'll have to go take a look some time.
---
You can literally tank a 5 man as a pure DPS build. Just slap on some tank gear and you're fine. Of course its going to be a little more rough until you get geared out but its easily doable. 
---
As far as raiding... Go whatever spec you want. The 31/20 build probably gives you the extra defense from the talents and a little more threat generation so its good if you're going to be off tanking a lot. If you're off tanking a lot nobody is going to knock you for being lower on the DPS meters than another warrior. 
---
It's completely up to you how you play your warrior though. I don't think many people will say shit to you unless your guild is struggling through content or something though. Its more of a personal thing and how competitive you are by nature. If you're a very competitive person, you wont like being a hybrid spec because other warriors will be out dpsing you all the time =). 
---
There usually aren't enough quests to get to 60, you have to grind a bit. Using rested experience wouldn't really take much away from the experience aside from grinding.
---
I have reread the post of rhonage. I have no idea why I didn't get it the first time. 
---
Fuck me sideways...
---
I was thinking of a variant on this and trying to level 3-4 characters simultaneously. Get each to ~20-25 relatively quickly, then put each one at an inn and quest/grind each until I am out of rested XP then return them to the inn and cycle to the next character. I think the strategy has the advantage that I can easily remember where the quest items are without having to look them up each time. However, since I lack the patience to really commit to it, I suspect I will end up rushing a first character to 60 then doing this with my alts. 
---
I plan on doing all of those except Rank 14. I like World PvP and some battlegrounds but I’ve always new more of a PVE guy. I don’t know if even I will have the willpower to grind Rank 14. 
---
&gt;I think thats a huge part of why I've lost so much interest in retail. New content is.. new. They have just started forging new worlds and islands left and right.
---
I feel you, I started to feel that way at TBC, like, right when I got to Zangamarsh in Outland I said to myself, "wtf is this place? This isn't Outland." 
---
Stv can get you 10 levels 
---
And lasts the longest i believe. 
---
Neither was in vanilla, though.  At least I remember them launching later. 
---
ZG was 1.7 and AQ was 1.9. 
---
Naxx was 1.11. 
---
Maybe that counts as Vanilla?  Seems like that was at least a couple of years into vanilla.   Maybe I'm just out of the loop. 
---
Damn! Well if you plan on playing classic those shall be your must goals!!  
---
I simply decided to play something that I didn't play too much back in the day. Also, I wanted something that fits my current goals and playstyle, which is keeping it as casual as possible, while focusing on leveling, reading quests, taking some professions (and leveling them up as I go) and generally having "fun", without thinking too much about the endgame.
---
For that, I decided to play Warlock. Leveling is always much nicer with a pet, and I never played Warlock in Vanilla past lvl 20. It's also a class that has a very heavy theme going on, with the demons and such. I think it will fit my current playstyle perfectly. If there will be any RP servers, I might actually try that too. I am also considering a Hunter, but I still remember all the bad jokes about Hunters from Vanilla times and I would like to avoid snarky comments during my play time.
---
There's always something to do.  For example, on my hunter, at any given time I might have:
---
* Specific skinning items I need to farm for leatherworking
---
* Quests in 2-3 different zones
---
* A whole series of elite quests I need a group and a few hours to do
---
* A dungeon that drops a new bow
---
* New ranks of pet abilities I need to train
---
The game does a good job of always giving you a couple extra things to do when you finish something (with a few exceptions - 15-30 is the hardest part for me).  There's always so much different content that I've got something to do.
---
Maybe one thing you can do is figure out what it is you like about end-game and apply it to leveling.  If it's the group content, then try to do more dungeons, both instanced and non.
---
that “someone” has a name that rhymes with “FightPickney?”
---
Preface: I didn't play anything past TBC.  
---
Eastern wetlands and the highlands did exist in Vanilla. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Arathi_Highlands  
---
It was in southern Deadwind Pass. The same place where it was in TBC.
---
Damn, someone beat me to it. But yeah, all the pets got normalized by 1.12.1, like there was a Hyena whose name I’ve forgotten that had like 100 of each resistance, making them a mages nightmare. But, Son of Hakkar will likely still be BiS since it’s ranged and doesn’t have as many worries when it comes to the  pet issues that have plagued hunters for years. (Squishy, slow on target swaps, shitty AI/Pathing, etc.”)
---
I ran scholo so many times that I was exalted WAY before Nax was released, unfortunately most of the guild I was in at the time of release wasn't in the same boat so we never ran it. That and we were stuck on Princess H in AQ40, with the gift of hindsight I know now that we probably could've done some stuff in Nax but oh well, that's in part what Classic is for I suppose. 
---
The moment I even smell mtx in classic, I'm gone. A year down the line, 3 years, doesn't matter and won't even think twice about it. I will also never, ever buy another product from Blizzard. 
---
Classic will either be a redemption story or a complete downfall of the company. I truly hope they realise this. 
---
Pretty sure I'm not the only one, with this conviction.
---
I will sensei
---
If ActiBlizzard wants to make the most money they would just replicate vanilla wow for an authentic experience. They’re earning $15 a month from players, and there’s going to be a lot of people playing classic. If they add in a WoW token, many streamers who carry large influence will leave, and masses of players will quit. Blizz will lose out on that subscription money. Of course I can’t say with certainty that monthly subscriptions from a large player base will make ActiBlizzard more money than a shady cash shop and WoW town no fking wants. But, replicating vanilla in the best way possible is the right thing to do, and it will repair trust between the players and ActiBlizzard, which is solely needed. 
---
I usually just grind a few levels in Westfall until I can go to Redridge as Alliance.
---
All pre tbc is vanilla
---
Zg and aq 20 both launched before naxx, patches are not decimalised,  7 and .9 come before .11 because 11 is after 7and 9
---
lol you can sell the token for 300k. it fucks up the economy.
---
What happened is Blizzard realized they could take the private server crowd, the ones who arent playing retail, and make an easy 15m a month for little long term investment. 
---
Reddit has little to do with it.  But private server numbers dont lie.  Its a big enough demographic to go after. 
---
I plan on alternating my first two characters to maximize well rested. I am in no rush to hit 60 it will happen easily enough given some time. I will probably rush them both to lvl 20 then begin alternating.
---
(Source!)[https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=93]
---
It isn’t raids that are the issue it’s loot. It’s passed out too much for easy activities ontop of them increasing the ilvl of all dungeons. 
---
So you speak for ActiBlizzard then? They haven’t come out and publicly said WoW token or a cash shop will not be implemented in classic, therefore posts like this are permissible whether you like it or not.  If ActiBlizzard knows the differences between classic and retail why is sharding, right click to report, and loot-trading supposedly in classic?
---
The only support for the Loot Change I've seen is that people think it will make GM's jobs easier. Yet, players dont want loot trading to be a thing. 
---
So maybe it is easiest to just say loot trading is not allowed ever, any time.
---
Saves GM time, saves support time, and saves players from experiencing the abuses of the new system Blizz wanted to implement.
---
Eh idk if they would rerelease classis just for maybe 50k-100k players subs
---
No idea how I missed it then...or perhaps I simply don't remember it lol
---
Same place it always has been located. 
---
My Leveling Path is probably this...  
---
* Elwyn 1-10 
---
* West Fall 10-15
---
* Loch Modan 15-18
---
* Red Ridge 18-22
---
* Wetlands 22-25
---
* Duskwood 25-27 or 28
---
* Hillsbrad 28-30 
---
* Arathi 30-32
---
* Badlands 32-34 (I think duskwallow is in this level range too which i'll hit up for a few quests / grinds)
---

Different highlands. Grim Batol in Cata is located in the Twilight Highlands, NE of Khaz Modan, E of the Wetlands, SE of Arathi.
---
No no, I'm pretty sure it was ''TightWhitney''.
---
50 to 100? Try over million spread across private servers.. 
---
I don’t know if it’s the best solution but it certainly beats them including the WOTLK/Cata loot system in Classic
---
Yeah I agree.  I never really liked the newer models. Mostly because I hate that Blizzard changed a lot of the animations too. 
---
He's talking about what would eventually become the TBC indirect taunt spell.
---
They were workshopping it all the way back in Vanilla, but of course half of the stuff that was supposed to be in Vanilla was pushed back to TBC, which is why TBC is jokingly referred to as the patch when WoW finally left beta.
---
Zangramarsh is my favorite Outland Zone and I wish it was in WoD. 
---
It looked and felt Alien. 
---
Because end game is what people strive for. The raid environment and running hard dungeons =)
---
I saw an excellent solution here to this. Make Loot Trading optional at the start of any Dungeon/Raid. If you chose not to use it then any misclicks are on you and the GMs will not help. Seems like a nice silver lining to me.
---
According to John Staats' new book, Grim Batol was in the works pre-release but due to time constraints had to be abandoned. However, looking back and analyzing it now, I ponder if it being a mystery actually increased the pleasure I got out game more than it would have if it was actually a working instance at the time. I mean, here we are talking about it and it's impact 15 years later.
---
Whether you like it or not streamers will carry a large influence for classic, and if they’re pissed about a supposed cash shop or WoW token addition their fans will be pissed too and they may all quit. That’s free exposure for classic gone.  I get what you mean though, I don’t care if a streamer quits, but I can neglect their influence for classic sadly
---
You mean you DONT want groups of friends to need roll everything and split the loot later??
---
BLASPHEMY
---
Vanilla is anything before TBC launched.
---
If you're having problems going 12-20 as alliance, you're skipping darkshore. 20+ you need to bounce around in redridge/ashenvale/stonetalon, doing a couple levels in each one.
---
Horde has problems 18-25 if you go silverpine or skip stonetalon, it's pretty easy IMO to go 12-26 with southern barrens and stonetalon, and 26-30 with mostly 1k needles and ashenvale.
---
[deleted]
---
This is the most concise explanation so far for these people who say “the wow token is good it gets rid off the chinese!” Wrong! 
---
Ok i kind of get your point but i just disagree. I think it is positive that someone with low income irl can play the game for „free“. 
---
The argument that someone gets something for a small amount of rl money is straight wrong. The worth of Classic gold will be much higher than in retail thats why a token will yield like 200 gold (assumption obv.) maybe a little more. That would be line €100 for epic riding. In addition to €100 it is 1000 gold off the market because real people spent gold to buy the token. 
---
If the classic community strictly disagree with the token no one buys it for gold and we dont have a problem.
---
Just be the group of friends.  Solved. 
---
Do you mean it only applies to players who click they want it? Then it still doesn't solve the issue of friends grouping up to trade loot amongst themselves.
---
The only way that fixes it, is if ALL group members need to agree to allow loot trading. Otherwise being the one person who doesn't partake has no effect.
---
I still think simpler solution is that Blizz refuse to do Loot Trades anymore.
---
Games been out 15 years, I think its safe to assume everyone knows not to click Need TWICE if they dont want the loot.
---
If you do that maybe the group of friends will be known server wide.
---
I assume it will regulate itself.
---
Well we can honestly blame gold inflation as expansions went on for that.
---
Honestly, if Vanilla was launched with some form of token system it would have had a huge health benefit to customer support as the drive to buy gold illegally would have curbed immensely.
---
As Vanilla had no token system, I would not want it in Classic as well. But I have to say, tokens were one of the few great ideas Blizzard had after Wrath (even if the game became unplayable for me for other reasons).
---
"Retail is one average expansion away from recapturing most of its current base back tbh. Idk why you think it would ever die, and in under a year at that?" Recapturing numbers about a sub count they already felt the need to hide. I don't think they will though. Secondly yes it will kill Blizzard. They are already on the ropes. Shelving games and, scaling others back. They need a hit. It is unlikey retail will ever be that hit again.
---
"Classic is too time consuming in relation to ever fully replace it. I'd love to retcon literally everything after wotlk, and retail failing is the first step, but its just not gonna happen. "
---
That is your mentality. It does take too much time if you plan on being a world beater first 60. Progression raider. That is about 5% of any classic server. Classic appeals to way more different kinds of people. Classic is also the better casual game.
---
Honestly that's just  my opinion. Maybe it's delusional but, it's what I think.
---
&gt; It's not something that should be trivialized so you can easy fish and chat.
---
Yikes.
---
True story. I won the orange Zulian Tiger in a ZG run in 2005. The loot master accidentally looted it to herself and had to put in a ticket to get it sent to me. 
---
post lvl 40, if you play 2 hours/day on evenings, you will basically always be rested because xp gain is just that low. 
---
At this point in r/classicwow you can't tell what is satire or not.
---
No, only the dungeon/raid leader should be able to decide it for the whole group.
---
I am pretty certain the majority would not roll with it for most of the time anyway.
---
I suggest dropping Thick Hide for Feral Instinct for levelling.
---
You won't need that much armor unless you're raiding, but having extra threat and extra stealth will definitely prove useful along the way.
---
I'm not saying it wasn't a great zone, honestly I loved it.....but, it didn't feel like Outland, from a WCIII perspective it was totally out of place. 
---
Wintergrasp not an option or do you prefer burning steppes?
---
Sure, but that's a hassle most people won't bother with, so the effect on the game is greatly reduced. 
---
Remember killing lvl 37+ gorillas/Cats in STV on my hunter. Skinned all and sold everything to vendor. Gorilla hairs and bristley whiskers are valuable. Got 15+ Gold from a full bag run that took anything between 1.5 - 2 hours. Several of those and you ding 40 by the time you have 100g. Maybe not the best way but a sure thing if you feel like putting in the time.
---
I guess we have to step back and think. Is the token system better than the Chinese sweatshop gold-farming of 2006? With the new tech Blizzard has at its disposal and the ability to buy gold legally, it raises one problem but diminishes another.
---
Would be a terrible solution. Any group farming for a friend is already going to be a majority.
---
Does nothing to assuage the concerns players have.
---
I like your thoughts &amp; can agree with you. Of course, there's monetary benefits to Classic. Probably not as much as retail with all of the micro-transactions, but it will still be very profitable. 
---
If they're trying to appease 2 types of players, then Classic really will be taken care of. They should know that this will require heart &amp; soul to maintain &amp; progress, compared to the half-assed retail version. This is also why there are "some changes" people who want the good parts of retail to join with the good parts of vanilla. Clearly, artists put a lot of effort into retail while developers seem to not. Developers clearly put tons of effort into vanilla, while artwork wasn't quite there yet.
---
There will deffo be ganking, don't get me wrong. All i'm saying is that if Blizzard honors their designed server cap that it will be a lot less than ppl expect these days when going off non-blizzlike server caps as used by pservers which makes sure that STV turns into one big mess. 
---
They need int spirit too, I don’t see the problem :).

There are good BoE items in retail as well. They go for like 5xToken price. I actually can‘t remember how exactly BoE Items are in vanilla. I only remember T1 wrists and belts(?) as highest pieces of BoE. In my opinion mc will be done real quick at least for people who take raiding serious.
---
Adding a sound effect doesn't break ToS, but being able to click anywhere is, as it gives a gameplay advantage/benefit outside of the core game.
---
Woot!!
---
They shut down if their own accord to honor Blizzard's wishes. 
---
Wouldn't it be easier just to allow loot to be put back on a corpse and rerolled?
---
I'm still mad that the dark rider in Duskwood wasn't Teron Gorefiend riding out from Karazhan. I think it would've made for a better story. 
---
Even if it would cost €500 for epic mount, there are plenty of people who would do it. People spend many thousands of euro on phone games, why wouldn't they spend as much on their favorite MMO that is returning after over a decade?
---
Even if only 5% of the population would sell tokens for gold, it'd make people like myself be less interested in farming/playing. I understand that some people don't care how other people get their gold, but for me it'd kill my interest in playing.
---
Wow, I tilted you off of the planet. You’re worse than I thought. 😂😂😂 Thanks for the laugh. When you eventually try to kys, don’t go under the chin. 
---
Definitely. Because we have payed for content we can't play anymore. The content might be there but it's just dead. Making everything at level cap would be so much better. 
---
Adding changes to mitigate abuse from other changes isn't an excellent solution, that's nonsense.
---
Well I believe in innocent until prooven guilty. Banning people left and right because they might habe bought gold is worse than having a token lol
---
Is it worth going to Darkshore as a non-elf?
---
AH baby! You can do so much, especially if you spend the time, even early on.
---
You won’t even know if the people who you grouped with were a couple of buddies who split the loot after
---
Remember the Gates of Gilneas? Not being able to access Mount Hyjal? Seeing Naxx for the first time, floating above Eastern Plague Lands? That's one of the things that I miss most about Vanilla: Seeing these grand structures filled with mystery, excited to increase your level to explore it further! Even just looking into Duskwood from Westfall, seeing "level skull" spiders and wolves roam the gloomy lands! I don't really think they've managed to recreate that feeling for a while. The Tomb of Sargeras was probably the most recent instance I can personally recall.
---
My exact thoughts when I saw westfall 10 - 20. :D no fkn way.
---
If you are against grinding for leveling, then by design in vanilla you must alternate between many zones in your level range to have sufficient quests. I have found the 20-30 area one of my favorites. You have Wetlands, which has many good quests. Duskwood many quests. Ashenvale, not as many quests and contested by horde, but not bad. Lower 20’s you can do redridge elite and group quests. At 25 you can do stockades which has 5-6 dungeon quests, great exp.
---
Well, your total DPS increases as you spend less time reapplying Shadow Word Pain. That gives you time for more wand hits, Mind Blasts, Mind Flays, etc.
---
But yes, Shadow Word Pain's DPS remains constant, but yours improves.
---
I feel your tanking sentiments. I really like tanking and will probably still roll warrior. But it can be a pain sometimes when you need to AFK or if you just don't want to focus 100% it can be a pain in the ass.
---
Oh well, I'm still rolling Tauren Warrior. Get tthose hit points baby and warstomp aint bad. Plus you're just one intimidating MF'er.
---
It actually looked that way for a long time if you went there by jumping out of ZG!
---
Accidents do happen with master looter but I would take that over people exploiting the system
---
They should probably put some type of confirmation popup in the master looter to stop those mistakes.
---
Yes, unless you want to end up in your situation where you're lacking quests.
---
Those catch-up mechanics had good intentions, but really started to derail the game. They came into full force when Cata came out &amp; leveling was a cake-walk. Multiple quests given to you INSIDE the dungeons? c'mon. 
---
They should have somehow kept OG servers, &amp; allowed character transfers to the new content servers. They tried to introduce a feature that kept your character at the same level, but new abilities &amp; items were introduced as well, permanently ruining the vanilla experience.
---
I'd love to see them release new content with Classic ideals in mind.
---
yes
---
Completely agree.
---
You ll probably see it when they launch tbc.
---
If they added Kara as a next level raid retuned for level 60 and just past Naxx, you bet your ass I would be there.
---
oh, fuck me, that's some newbie shit right there. sadly, no way to fix it.
---
If you're talking about currently, no you cant. Tokens have been at most 120k since Legion ended, Blizzard sets the exchange rate, and you cant set your own price for them on the AH. You have to sell them for what Blizz tells you it's worth. 
---
It still would ruin the economy, but let's not be facetious. 
---
Yes, there are a ton of quests there, you'll need to run to menethil at some point anyway, and you'll need to head there to get to ashenvale/stonetalon. I don't see any reason not to spend at least a few levels there, especially if you run out of quests in westfall.
---
Vanilla in that regard does have a itemisation issue though, since it gives raw percentages in stats, so if you add gear above Naxx level gear you will start to see gear giving 3% crit or 2% hit and 1% crit and the likes.
---
It would.  So much so.  I really do hope the success of classic gives them motivation to try a new direction of lateral expansions a few years down the road.
---
nice, I didn't even know the manual had such a chart, just googled around about how big certain races are in comparison to each other.
---
You sound like an LFR kind of guy.
---
delet this
---
oh, my bad, it's 120k not 300k.
---
funny how all of you seem to be **promoting** the use of these tokens and aren't seeing what the OP of this thread is saying
---
the whole point of vanilla, btw, is to EARN your own gold, not buy a token and sell it on AH.
---
Oh shit, I completely forgot about the chess event! Kara was so damn good.
---
just lol
---
Guys, guys. Blizzard know that we want no changes. That's it, really. This Reddit post wont change their mind about going against the costumers, if they are thinking about it.
---
That was my point, but thanks!
---
I never saw an issue with the loot system in vanilla.  Even when we did have a ninja, like if a hunter rolled need on a wand, I don't remember anyone ever contacting a GM for it.
---
Keep the old system, implement a "Click Confirm to roll Need" button and let GM's have an auto reply to ninja loot issues saying "Your problem, not mine."
---
What spec should I oo into as a warrior for leveling up?  I want to bash things up with a 2H.
---
&gt; Do tiny upgrades offer enough incentive for you to subscribe to the game for another year?
---
Where people un-subbing when they completed Naxxramas?  
---
Where people un-subbing after killing Illidan?  
---
A player who has, for example, already collected all tier sets **might** think of un-subbing, as they "got it all", but they will stick to the game to help the friends they've made along the way.  
---
How long will it take for their full guild to be fully equipped?  
---
I joined in TBC, but I've met people who were on since launch day, and still had to complete their MC and Naxx sets, due to bad luck with drops.  
---
The incentive to sub is in completing your stuff, not just downing that one boss.  
---
A new raid adding a piece that gives you one more tick on SW:P is a raid that can help you with farming MC and Naxx quicker, so that in itself is an incentive.  
---
Aside from this, though, even adding new continents and regions, which in and by itself is a positive thing, as it offers a more realistic world, the tricks in not making the old zones obsoletes are adding new raids in those zones, keeping old profession materials relevant (instead of going out of the roof with new mats), and giving the game world an "organic" population.  
---
I never liked level-gated regions, but I'm in favor of level-ranged **sub**-regions.  
---
Instead of Westfall being generically "8-24", have the different sub-regions of it own their own level ranges with, as an example, the Dagger Hills being inhabited by 40-50 Elite Ettins.  
---
Make it so that, while being able to one-shot low level mobs, players still find something more or less challenging almost anywhere.  
---
As per the mats, imagine if you could craft a sword like the [7th Legionnaire's Claymore](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/777962-7th-legionnaires-claymore.jpg); you could rule that you need Monelite Ore, since it's a "new profession rank" recipe, but it also requires gold ore, for the gilded parts, and blue sapphires to be encased in the blade.  
---
This would allow players to constantly maintain a healthy economy on the realms, as high level artisans could still use the "services" of low level gatherers.  
---
This can be applied all across the board, from level 1 to level "whatever", although my personal opinion is to cut the number of levels, with 60 being the maximum acceptable, though still too high.  
---
Increase the number of world mobs that require a party or raid to be defeated, and make those monsters reward with special loots (mounts, pets) or rare equipment (blue or purple), or rare materials ("the fang of an ancient red dragon can be sharpened into a powerful sword").  
---
Increase the number of cosmetics dropped by special mobs, and add a purely cosmetic slot, the battle standard (like in D3), which can mark out which powerful bosses you've downed ("hey, look at that dwarf, he's carrying the war banner of Drakkisath, cool!")  
---
There's so much that can be done to keep the subs running, while re-using old content, and without updating it.  
---
It's just about thinking ahead.

I think the issue is that if Blizzard takes the stance that RMT is okay and essentially part of the game, then there is no fear of getting banned/punished if you buy gold. Honestly, there are times I think about skipping a week of farming and just buying gold for my epic mount. But the one reason I never bought gold is because I was too scared to lose my account and all my hard work. I just fear that buying gold will become completely normalized and way more people will be doing it.   
---
I get your argument that people who really wanted to buy gold were buying gold anyways. But, I think that officially sanctioning it and making it like, an official part of the game will make gold buying far more widespread and WILL have big impacts on the economy.
---
&gt;funny how all of you seem to be **promoting** the use of these tokens and aren't seeing what the OP of this thread is saying
---
Either you didnt read my entire comment, or you're soapboxing to me even though we agree. 
---
There was nothing at all in the zone really, just a few ogres. There was little reason to go there unless you wanted to farm peacefully for mob drops.
---
&gt;when the game comes round I’m probably going to give up just because the level process is so dull to me.         
---
          
---
There's nothing wrong with that. You don't owe it to anybody to play something you don't want to. IMO, just make a cost-benefit evaluation: is it worth it to you to play through the leveling process  in order to access the end-game?         
---
        
---
If the answer's yes, just do it. If the answer is no, don't. Don't try to come up with weird, gimmicky ways to 'trick' yourself into not hating leveling. If your assessment changes when you're level 32 and you feel like this hill's just too high to climb, just quit. That's fine.
---
Yeah, that could be it.

I've twinked a lot at 39. If you really want to one shot, reck bomb dwarf pallies with PoD are the way to go. Enchant the PoD with fiery, and put on a seal after gaining 5 stacks. The gear selection at 39 is great in general with all the SM mail gear. You 1 shot nearly everyone in your level range.
---
Using death Ray and dropping the reck bomb I was able to kill poorly geared 60s in 2 seconds. It was loads of fun but the downside is that you need to sit and gain the stacks. 
---
This build works extremely well if you just want to wpvp in stv or something. Not so great in BGs.
---
My general game plan is to do 1-8 in Elwynm. 8-10 in dun morgoh. I then head back to Elywnn for 10-11.5ish. From there I split my time between Westfall/Loch Modan until 20. 
---
20+ I typically do Redridge, Darkshire and Wetlands. During this time I do each Dungeon once along with all the quests at once. 
---
That gets me to the early 30's
---
True. I believe the biggest challange won't be the difficulty of the game, it will be people burning out. 
---
That's why I always say that don't worry about content after naxx. This game is a marathon and not everyone will make it till the end. 
---
Lvl 40 - 50 will be the level where we loose a good chunk of players. 
---
You sleeping on nagrand bruv? 
---
Though actually my favorite might be shadowmoon valley purely for netherwing ledge, that quest line was fucking awesome
---
That isn't from vanilla. Look at the different servers.
---
You are not, I think ActiBlizzard realizes that all of their IP’s right now are shit (besides Overwatch maybe, but after the Blizzard+Twitch situation when watching the pros, it doesn’t look good). The future of ActiBlizzard is not looking good, and classic imho will decide the company’s longevity as a “titan” in making good games.  Classic wow to ActiBlizzard is the same as ES6 to Bethesda. Don’t. Fuck. It. Up
---
I am in a similar spot. Played both priest and warrior a lot and pretty well, too. Currently leaning towards priest because of the ease of levelling and because I feel like the skill cap of healing is a lot higher than the skill cap of tanking (especially in early raiding).
---
I feel like levelling a warrior does not have to be as terrible as everyone says though. You will be in high demand for dungeons (which are fun and not bad for levelling speed) and will have an easy time finding friends along the way. And if you do quests in a group (with a semi healer ideally), it can become pretty fast and efficient. 
---
It has the red but no shrooms or oasis.
---
If I understand you right I believe that was an option in Vanilla. A leader could either set loot to be Master Loot (ie. raid leader decides and people usually /roll in chat if they want it or the raid uses dkp which was a manual pita) or you could all roll need/ greed 
---
Twinks are for people who can't pvp to save their life, so they have to pad their lack of skill with gear, change my mind.
---
Their hero description mentions it in the “information” paragraph.
---
http://classic.battle.net/war3/neutral/pandarenbrewmaster.shtml
---
Yeah I'm quite curious to see how many high level gankers there are in the first days/weeks of launch. Seems like as long as you level near the speed of the average player there should be a lot of same-level world pvp 
---
If people roll on something they dont need and wont give it to the right person I will assume they re friends. 
---
I d say it will regulate by itself.
---
Yes, you could all roll need / greed.
---
But the new change Blizzard is introducing is what was done in Cata: For needed items that were bind on pickup, you can still trade those to teammates you ran the dungeon with for 2 hours.
---
So groups of friends just run and need stuff, or unequip items and need stuff to make it look like they need it, then trade it amongst themselves after
---
A lot of rogues including myself wanted to be exalted with ravenholdt manor.
---
Pretty hardcore if you get to exalted. The npcs will also greet you differently. 
---
Also agree.
---
I would take those super rare infrequent accidents over a system that can be exploited.
---
It's not willy nilly banning.  Like I said, the GM contacted me about the activity, I explained I was selling mount runs and that was that.  The players who were banned (temporarily mind you) very well could have been performing other shiesty activities, I don't know.  Their problems were resolved quickly though.  And we're talking about 100k+ transferred between accounts for what appeared to be nothing on a regular basis or 214k being transferred to another character because of gold cap issues in a gdkp and then mailing out upwards of 20k to 24 other players.  Sums of gold that 99.9999% of the wow community will never see.
---
There is a very clear point in vanilla where prot becomes preferable to arms for tanking, it's  the final boss in Maraudon. Everything up to Princess you're too rage starved to tank efficiently. It's possible to tank 5-mans at 60 fury spec it will be more trouble than it's worth if you don't already out gear the instance. 
---
hundo percento agree
---
Blizz resources dont need to be bogged down by this silly issue
---
Blizz just has to say "all rolls and bound items are permanent. leave our fuckin support staff alone". 
---
The games been out for 15 years, how many idiots are clicking need TWICE and still crying they screwed up
---
Yes.  For me, I didn't care how big of an upgrade something was - if a new raid was challenging and had cool looking new armor, the upgrade in performance was just a bonus.
---
With that said, there's ways they can make this work.  E.g., Use resistances, use unique PvE mechanics, etc.  E.g., Offer armor sets that have a unique bonus specifically relevant to other encounters in the raid.  Thus, you're having the inevitable power creep, but it's being implemented and tailored in such a way that it's relevant specifically to the raid content.  Something like that.
---
There's ways around this.  It'll mean Blizzard needs to be more creative than in the past with raid rewards, but it's definitely doable.  If something that's more challenging is released, and it provides an upgrade (even if it's marginal), people will want to raid it.
---
I guess it's more about the feeling of getting the ultimate piece of gear (BIS) for that level, like in end game but easier/quicker to achieve.
---
But your point is valid for some people i guess.
---
Isn't it 5 health per **one** second? I swear, you people keep downplaying the troll racial.
---
People with high IQ voted for Trump, how shocking. 
---
Because some people cant understand that people might have different opinions than them.
---
I wouldn't be against a very short time limit of say 5 minutes (two hours is not needed to fix simple mistakes) and everyone that was eligible for the loot getting a notification that player X traded item Y with player Z. They save all that info (so you can trade it with whomever after). 
---
Or if you could only trade items to the next person in line for it. Say if I rolled a 90, you rolled a 80 and my friend rolled a 70, I could only trade it to you, because you were next in line.
---
This would be a better solution imo, otherwise it's open to exploitation. If 
---
But they can get zg mounts and Baron rivendare right? 
---
It was definitly a thing in Retail Classic as well.
---
It does create a legal way for players to trade real money for gold (and therefore time). Whether that it is a good thing depends on your philosophy on Classic. If spending 1 hour at work is worth more classic gold than you can earn spending 1 hour grinding and there is a legal way to make this conversion, then it would be natural to use it. Buy token, sell token for retail gold and trade for classic gold. You save time (= money) and you won't be risking your account.

Yeah, the % stuff would basically have to be left as-is.  There's not much room for growth there.  You'd have to get creative with other stats.  Maybe even stats that are specifically relevant to the current or future raids.  For example, the way we farmed resistance gear for Ragnaros, or Frost gear for Sapphiron (that was a thing right?  GD, it's been so long I can't remember).  Tier 4 could be similar in stats to Tier 3, but it might include certain resistances or +(Damage to NPC Type) in anticipation of the next raid.  So then you're progressing in content, progressing in difficulty, and progressin in power - but the power creep is tailored in a way that if you went back to Stratholme in Tier 6, you're only marginally stronger than you would be in Tier 3.  BUT, that Tier 6 will be essential for for current raiding content.
---
Something of that nature.  Of course, then you'd have the problem that new 60s would have six tiers of raiding to get through before they could join their friends, so you'd need a creative solution to that problem too.  Smaller intermediary raids like AQ20 or ZG would probably be the answer there.  I dunno.
---
There's problems that need to be addressed for sure, but that doesn't mean they can't be solved.
---
&gt; but let's not be facetious.
---
ZG was released after BWL, yet full T2 was better than ZG gear. It can be done.
---
I honestly think WoW started going off the rails with AQ and Naxx. We need a lot of horizontal progression, with minor vertical steps.
---
Also, they totally should've added content on the existing map. Every time they add a new capital, the world feels more empty.
---
Femsplaining!!!:p
---
lol no  
---
they were in France, one of Blizzard's main EU strongholds. They would've gotten sued back into the stone age.  
---
abandonware argument never held up because blizzard never abandoned WoW  
---
Let's be real though, they did.
---
Maybe just don't play with ninjas? And quit worrying about this. 
---
Yeah I just watched it :)
---
What percentage of loot trading supporters secretly plan to loot trade scam some random scrubs? I’d say “none of our business” is a pretty good covert aupport excuse. 
---
+++EXPOSED+++
---
nah  
---
My hunter wore this until I got the SM staff.  Lack of hunter weapons bro.  Respect the stat stick.  
---
Of course in both cases all casters passed, and I asked if the group minded.  
---
How is that going to effect the economy? Most of the expensive fish come from fish schools. Being able to fish near people without impeding them won't make that any easier. 
---
Yeah, your comment is not at all how the token works on live. If you read the entire comment, which clearly you did not you would have seen the first half of that sentence. 
---
YOU are being facetious, that had nothing to do with the token. 
---
The only good part of TBC for me was Kara. 
---
It's fun.
---
Hellfire Peninsula looked dead on like Outland did in WCIII. 
---
Now, granted I understand *why* they added the other zones and designed them the way they did; an expansion where literally every "zone" was like Hellfire Peninsula wouldn't have been palatable to the average (and even hardcore Warcraft) players and would've been a terrible move to make as WoW was becoming more mainstream, but it still left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Not a deal breaker, but, something I raised an eyebrow at for sure.  
---
There's nothing about requiring you to pay attention to your bobber visually that prevents you from being social, so don't try to pin this on that. You want to be able to pay attention to things that are *not* fishing *while* fishing, and not having a distinct bobber sound for yours makes it harder.        
---
You can absolutely fish with friends and random people without it...you're just going to have to actually, you know, actively participate in fishing.
---
I don't want loot trading because people will abuse it because everyone is a dishonest piece of shit. 
---
Muh superior classic community, full of amazing people who are super honest and friendly. Not like singleplayer bot retail world of crapcraft, am I right gis? 
---
I think the best system would be only letting players roll need on items intended for their own class/spec and recipes for their own professions, as well as making loot won by a need roll soulbound. 
---
It’s been tried in retail and worked really well imho, it would eliminate most ninja rolls and exploiting loot trading. Anyone has a valid argument against this system that’s not ”it wasn’t in vanilla WoW”?
---
Truestrike shoulders for fury pre-raid BiS and similar items could either be the exception to these rules, be a little harder to farm (using master loot in a group you make yourself, stating they’re reserved), or they could just put enough hit on a pair of mail/plate shoulders.
---
I just wanted Shroom Trees like in WC3.
---
NOT MY HELLFIRE. 
---
&gt; Well we can honestly blame gold inflation as expansions went on for that.
---
Not mutually exclusive...we can also blame having a literal cash funnel that you can drop for more gold than anything else in the world, so......
---
I was grinding yetis in Winterspring on Christmas Eve. I had to sing before it was time to leave for my grandma’s house. Dinged right before we left with my Dad pestering me to get off the computer because it was time to go. I was so happy, I didn’t even care that it was Christmas. 
---
There literally called ninjas because you dont know who is one. It's not as easy as "dont play with them".
---
I agree with you in theory but they already have two pop ups saying “are you sure”
---
At a certain point you just gotta keep it simple and say, we don’t need to program any new systems, people have been playing the game for over a decade, let’s just stick with the original Classic version, and call it a day
---
I speak as much/little for Activision/Blizzard as you do, or any of the people. But if you want to go that way; are you from the future, since you’re saying it’s in the game? We all know the demo was there and these features were in the game, but you don’t know if it’ll be in the game or not, or if it’s something leftover from the original client, like the LFG system, which they said wasn’t on purpose, they just hadn’t gotten around to removing it.
---
There already is a “click confirm to roll need” button in original Classic. You have to click twice and in different spots in order to properly need roll something
---
Because you dismiss a whole community of gamers.
---
There are agdq speed runs through incredible difficult and modified levels of the original yoshis Island for the snes. 
---
You dismiss all the nir, bloodborn and dark souls community. The whole appeal of those games is to die until you beat a boss. 
---
You have to be incredible ignorant or a troll to dismiss them, just because you hate mythic raids. 
---
People enjoy difficult games is really so hard to understand? This is outrageous. 
---
Yes, because that will not change the number of tickets, and on top of that is a divergence from their loot policy for the entire time the game has existed. So people will continue to put in tickets, the GM's will have to continue answering them, and they do not want to pay the staff to do so. 
---
Vanilla structure is that you can only need on items you can equip.
---
So mages can’t need any armor but cloth, and any other class can’t need any weapon that they haven’t successfully trained spec for.
---
&gt; If ActiBlizzard wants to make the most money they would just replicate vanilla wow for an authentic experience.
---
I think they're uniquely equipped to know more baout what will make them the most money. Do you really think you've got it more figured out? 
---
Yeah and why have guards in cities too? It’s not like other players will attack us and kill us. The world is filled with rainbow unicorns and we all love each other! Am I right gis?
---
Are you sure? 
---
Rank 14 weapons were added w/ the PvP patch in 1.4, then updated to be competitive w/ BWL gear in patch 1.6 and at the same time a change was made so that purchasing items required lifetime highest rank as opposed to current, and (some) caster weapons weren't added until patch 1.11 (well after the lifetime highest rank change was made). 
---
[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/99d1rl/patchwerk_wednesday_pvp/). 
---
Even if this is true, there was fortunately only an 84 day window where this could've affected people based on the release dates between patch 1.4 and 1.6. 
---
People can unequip any item they have that’s better, making it look like they actually Need the item rolled for, then just trade it to friend after
---
For real, this is the authentic vanilla experience lol
---
Really, really, really don't try to tank raids as a paladin, you will have a bad time. It's not just "oh I want to mess around" it's 39 other people saying "no, you're not going to waste our time, we're going with the warrior". If you don't already have a group of enough friends that you could make a raid guild with and they're all fine with you trying to do paladin tanking, then it's not going to happen. They can literally barely tank 5 mans at higher levels, they're really just healers.
---
OTs are a lot more flexible, if you're a 3rd or 4th seat tank you'll start seeing some feral druids or fury specced warriors. You still need to farm a bit, but it's not as bad and your spec can be a little more hybrid.
---
If you think healing is boring on retail, you probably won't like healing in classic.
---
Geared warriors are one of the strongest PvP classes, but you need the gear and spec. If you are trying to tank, you'll need to respec and have a second gear set to PvP well.
---
I mean, yeah a ret pally could probably do OK in pvp, but they're not a top PvP class or anything. In my experience, they're pretty lackluster in BGs if they aren't healing and are auto-kills in WPvP if I'm willing to spend the outrageous amount of time it takes to kill them.
---
It sounds like you're looking more for HotW druid which can *actually* do multiple different roles, or you need to sit down and look at if the amount of grinding you'll need to do respeccing each time you want to swap roles and get all the different gear sets you will need.
---
A common meme is that pserver players are hardcore elites.  They're not.  A lot of players are there because the game is free.  I've heard a lot of pserver folks say they'll stay because they don't want to pay $15 USD.  There will always be a market for pservers for that reason.
---
This new system is silly, Blizzard needs to just stick with what was already in actual Classic.
---
The old system let you only roll on what you could equip, and you had to click twice to Need roll something. It worked fine. 
---
These stupid changes is modern day Blizz trying to fix something that isn’t broken, causing more problems in the process.
---
My revelation that his game was intriguing and the moment that hooked me: I was leveling an Undead Warlock (PvE) and I was in Moonbrook (Westfall) and a fully loaded Human Warrior (his level was marked with a skull iirc) came through and DESOLATED the whole town.  I watched in awe as the black-clad knight laid waste to any and all NPCs.  It was a sight to behold.  It basically convinced me to roll Alliance from that day forward. (Though I never did well with the warrior class) 
---
Actually just forgot about those quest lines up there. I'd probably do that in line with burning steppes to speed things up. I'm guessing theres going to be some straight up grinding from 55-58 so wintergrasp can help with that.  
---
*got eem*
---
I think one of the last patches of Vanilla introduced cross realm bgs.
---
its interesting that you say paladins can barely tank 5 mans at higher levels. From all the research I've done there's such a divide on this. Some people swear Pallys are find and sometimes even preffered for 5 mans, other people say the opposite. Super frustrating as someone trying to figure out what to roll. 
---
I'd be a-ok with 3rd or 4th seat tank. I just want to tank sometimes, and slowly build up the gear. You're saying that would be acceptable goals as a pally? and the farming for that isnt too bad?
---
Thanks for the comment about Druids, I've never really been a fan of the shapeshifting mechanic and I guess as a bear I feel like a shittier warrior, while as a cat I feel like a shittier rogue. At least as a pally the specs arent just worse versions of other classes since they play pretty unique? I'll take a look at some druid videos and guides from back in the day I guess. Thanks!
---
Ah thanks, wasn't sure about that one.
---
The door blocking off gilneas was a big one for me back In the way was always curious if there was a city behind it and even fallowed one of those pre-cata guides to get over it. 
---
Theres already a lot of good vanilla streamers that could answer your questions but let me tell you some quick things: 
---
- Paladin : boring healing/buffing in raids starting in MC. You will not tank. The chance are as small as winning at the lottery.
---
- Warrior : limited places in guild for main tank/off tank due to the lesser need in qties and the way guild gear their tanking squad (investment). You'll have to invest a lot of your time and soul to do this. 
---
Really if you don't like healing and want a fun, efficient, utility and escape class, you should think about mage or warlock. If you're in melee only i don't anything that fits because any hybrid class that can heal will be require to  be healer in raids.
---
Hope it hells a bit but look for the following streamers: madseasonshow, tipsout, kargoz, imalive and more i forgot about. :)
---
also the game has no mystery as its been entirely datamined and thrown up on mmochamp before an expansion is even in beta..
---
so you must love grinding huh?  and as a paladin that sounds awful  
---
Looks like you stopped reading after that sentence. 
---
The problem with fury is twofold, the main issue, is hit % for dual welding. You miss way too frequently, causing you to be rage starved and do poor damage. Second is pvp, fury doesn't have the same crunchyness and burst capability that arms does, nor does it offer the utility of stance dancing while maintaining rage.
---
2h fury is often accepted as the fastest warrior leveling strategy in terms of pure pve efficiency. I often level 1-40 as 2h fury, then switch to arms at 40 since ms is purely based on wep damage and bloodthirst is based on raw AP. (at 40 you're still using ww axe probably and getting fat MS crits, then at 43(?) i think 43, you get executioners cleaver and really get some fat damage.
---
Another fantastic reason to arms is being able to kill multi enemies at once. Don't underestimate the power of sweeping strikes + ww, sweeping strikes + cleave with a powerful 2h.
---
Source: played warrior since 2004, leveled 6 warriors 1-60 on retail vanilla and undocumented vanilla servers 
---
Edit: not hells but helps ahah
---
They will monetize Classic.
---
Just look at the current state of Retail dude, it's clear Activision will fuck up Classic as well.
---
Good thing is we will have private Classic servers, which will become more successful over time
---
If you think of it that way, then exp/hour also increases ^_^
---
This isn't 1984 Big Brother.. I don't edit the past ;)
---
It does 2 things for you:
---
1) reduces the effective mana cost of SWP as you don't have to refresh it as often, but this only works if you cast SWP twice and expect full duration on the target.  How often does that happen?
---
2) Over 72 seconds, you would need to cast an 18s SWP 4 times but a 24s SWP only 3.  That gives you one additional GCD that you could use for something else.  That means every 72 seconds you gain one additional cast.
---
Sub count is a poor estimation, it will balloon to at least three times what it is now if other subreddits release dates are any indication.
---
That is true, if ActiBlizzard strikes classic down, private servers will become more powerful than anyone could possibly imagine
---
Holy/Protection Reckbomb paladin probably covers the things you want as much as it is possible. 
---
This spec is capable of healing in raids and BG's, Reckbomb for WPVP and the protection part for tanking 5mans and UBRS.
---
To put it simply, you can't be a tank in raids unless you are a warrior or a **very dedicated** feral druid player. 
---
Of course they can do whatever they want with their own IP. That is why there will be mobile game for all their IPs.
---
This isn't even up for debate, so move along.
---
&gt; A lot of people have made being a tank in high end raids sound like its a ton of work to farm mats/flasks for raids and I dont want to spend all my non raid time just farming mats for the next raid. I know a lot of people will tell me to roll warrior based on this 
---
They are correct. If you don't want to prepare yourself then don't play a tank. 
---
&gt; Because of that, Paladin really sounds ideal for me, and I know so many people will tell me how stupid it is to try and tank raids as a paladin and how I’ll never be as good as warrior for that and blah blah blah. I know. Except, I dont really want to be a part of a super serious raiding guild. A nice casual guild that raids once maybe twice a week and doesn’t expect to contend for server firsts or anything close to that is fine by me. So I’m assuming I’d be able to find a guild that might let me do me in that regard. 
---
Pallys have no taunt. And their block isn't a forced mechanic like warriors are able to do so you will never be able to always be sure that crushing blows are off the table. So no, you can not raid tank as a main tank. You may be able to off tank some fights but anything that can crush will kill you. 
---
&gt;At end game I’d like to do a bit of everything, I want to be able to jump on and do a BG, or go out into the world and join in on some world PvP, or run an instance, and still be able to raid casually as well. I’m just kind of stuck between Paladin and Warrior.  
---
&gt;The amount of farming for flasks that’s necessary as a raid MT sounds awful. Is it just as bad for an OT? Maybe I’m wrong about that all together? How much farming do you really have to do as a raid MT/OT or even just for raids in general? (I only started raiding in TBC)
---
If you are speced as a tank you probably won't be that great in BGs or in world PVP. Are flasks nessesary? Eh. Not all the time but you should be willing to put in the effort to be prepared to be the best tank you can be. The primary OT is just as much as the MT. Other OTs eh... not as much. But tanking competition is pretty high and if I were a raid leader looking at a lazy tank and a non lazy tank of equal quality... guess who I'm picking.  
---
&gt; Does Warrior or Pally sound more like what I’m looking for? Or if you have a different opinion and a different class sounds ideal with what I’m looking for, I’m all ears. 
---
I don't think either sound good for you. You don't want to farm. You want to WPVP and BG and Raid.... Do me a favor and go hunter.
---
Actually, this has made think, because I've never really been salty at smurfs or twinks in video games; I've always just accepted them being there.
---
Why do people smurf? Why do people twink in this game? O.O
---
Cool, are these good vendor trash or have AH value also?
---
Ye, hakkar is bis, but broken tooth is bis pre ZG i guess, if lupos is normalized.
---
That doesn't really tell the whole story, TBC was being released soon and many raiding guilds didn't feel the need to jump through hoops to get attuned/flasks that would be obsolete soon. The guild I was in didn't even attempt naxx despite clearing AQ. We all just pvped and tried to farm up gold to prepare for the expac.
---
Brokentooth has his attack speed normalized as well in 1.12.1 iirc
---
Omfg they cant do this to us, right? RIGHT?
---
That's true, but there are shamans on both teams. So it isnt Vanilla.
---
Redridge is 3 Duskwood 4
---
Lots of death
---
Hairs and whiskers are vendor trash. They sell for like 40+ silver a stack.
---
Obviously, this covers up to around level 40 and I haven't finished it yet. Which areas are inaccurate? 1 is 1-10, 2 is 10-20. The rest should be obvious.
---
Kalimdor areas are supposed to be included in this too, so it's not so much about insufficient quests, but incorrect ranges and appropriate levels. Could use some help. Thanks
---
Not in a legal sense.  Which is the only one that matters
---
I doubt it,  it we can hope lol
---
Retail has this and idk why people forget. Sure it's a smaller part but it's there. Tanaan Jungle in WoD, Suramar City in Legion and the Broken Shore as well. Smaller wonders of what's going on but still there. Can't think of anything like that in BfA though. 
---
You don't know how laws work do you? Blizz claims that classic is them offering the same thing, you get to pay lawyers a fuckton of money to claim that it isn't the same game and a 65 year old judge who has never learned to turn his computer on makes the decision. You probably lose, having paid tons of money for the chance to do so, blizz cares nothing for what they paid and on top of it you probably get nailed with fines or have to pay blizz directly for violating their copywrite.
---
It's not that bad.. let's be real.  Hunters depend on mana- of course not as much as casters do but still you are in a really bad spot without mana. 
---
I suppose it'd be more polite to see if the other casters need it or not but at the same time, he can use it and it is an upgrade for him the same way as it's an upgrade for other characters.  
---
At the end of the day it's Deadmines.  Take a deep breath, and understand it isn't your sovereign right to tell other people how to play.  You'll get more upgrades soon. 
---
So I would be healing raids? Does the healing gear I'd receive from raiding aid that spec or how would I get gear to be able to tank 5 mans/do pvp? My apologies for the stupid questions, I only raided super casually in TBC/Wrath and otherwise-- to my embarrassment --used LFR. I also never got above level 47 in vanilla since I was basically a child back then. 
---
You're\*
---
Do you remember what quest line it was?
---
Hasn't been tested because nobody knows how it would shake out. Blizz doesn't want to risk adverse precedent when it's a toss up and once they put out classic they will simply win.
---
Outrageous is probably a little strong of a term lol. Having a different opinion of fun isn't the end of the world. I personally can't see how people enjoy pvp servers, but hey whatever makes them happy
---
Oh yeah, didnt see that. Oopsie
---
Without a token system, gold WILL inflate over time. That's the unfortunate side-effect of infinitely generating gold. You can see it in private servers when basic material cost rises astronomically since the server's inception before they make a new "fresh" server.
---
Granted, Vanilla had a good system in place that shows it can work for 2-3 years: lvl 40 mount, lvl 60 mount, skill purchasing, repairs... But eventually many people will be lvl 60, have their skills bought, and have their epic mount.
---
Classic will largely be similar, at least for a year or so. Unfortunately Classic is not Vanilla, as Vanilla later launched with Burning Crusade, having more gold sinks in place, and also inflating gold to give fresh players a leg up to not be overshadowed entirely by players with thousands of gold. This basically repeats every expansion until WoD's token system.
---
The WoW Token arguably is the only tool that can, by and large, be used as an *infinite* gold sink, which might be necessary in a sense in a permanent server system. Otherwise, gold will continue to diminish in value until the point that 100g is nearly worthless after level 40.
---
TL;DR, The WoW Token is not going to be such a big deal compared to Chinese Gold Farming. We need a permanently usable gold sink in a perpetual server.
---
Not to bash but this seems like extremely low quality content
---
One thing I came up to recently is, many people talk about horizontal raid levels, which in itself cannot really work in the current way the gear is spread among the raids.
---
Imagine now a Classic + version where you would have let's say Karazhan, Grim batol, and Sunwell plateau added (those are examples only)
---
One possible thing, but that would ask quite a lot of work from Blizzard point of view, is **to revamp all the itemization of the raids, so that T3 would still be the last tier.**
---
First approach 1) Imagine having for example half of T1 set (and offset possible pieces for each class/spec) in MC, and the other half in Karazhan. Then half of T2 gear would be in BWL, and the other half in Grim batol. And last half of T3 would be in Naxx, and the other half in Sunwell Plateau.
---
Another way 2) would be to give those additional raids gear for different specs
---
And / or way 3) would be to give those additional raids gear for different situations, like resist gear, more stamina for certain bosses instead of other stats, etc.
---
**I personally believe that there is a lot that Blizzard could do solely regarding the offspecs gear like elem sham, ret, moonkin. The game is incomplete in the itemization aspect, and having additional raids where tanks would need to go to get legs/shoes/belt etc. because they can't find it in other raids, and / or having hybrid having different gear like you can find in T2.5 in AQ40, but for other tiers as well would be really nice.** 
---
All this is theoretically doable, but of course it would ask a lot of work and ressource from Blizzard. But this would give them the opportunity to correct some mistakes made in Vanilla, without having to make them via later expansions.
---
&gt; its interesting that you say paladins can barely tank 5 mans at higher levels. From all the research I've done there's such a divide on this.
---
Some people swear by it, but because they really love the class and want to make it work.
---
I think for 5 mans its ok, but I think it's hard to gear a prot paladin, so most of the times a warrior will have better gear and sooner.
---
Oh I read your tldr, and in response: I played a Holy Paladin before.
---
I was in full preraid BIS so i only had cloth gear. So yeah I wasn't able to survive very well in WPVP.
---
I recommend druid though. I think you can make healing, offtanking, pvping, work much better.
---
I had a good friend on a vanilla pserver back in 2013, I'd mention the name of the server cos I feel nostalgic remember all the friends I had back on it, but rules are rules.
---
The guy had full soulforge, and really knew what he was doing, really loved playing his character.
---
I didn't mind healing him in a scholomance run. It wasn't bad, not bad at all.
---
That being said, a fresh 60 Protection Paladin? Lol well.... Chances are the weaknesses of the specc are going to come forth. 
---
And over a long boss fight in a raid environment, the paladin probably just takes much more damage than a warrior would.
---
I love you start with "you don't know how laws work", and then proceed to ignore the fact that most of the private servers that are running right now are running in countries where the laws you're discussing don't apply.
---
Digging that bald head. Guy is lookin clean mayn.
---
Pallies can definitely tank 5 mans with the proper group  - they do have pretty bad aggro retention as far as tanks go so you need to build threat ASAP via damage reflect / consec. Also, Leveling prot pally 40+ with AoE pulls is one of the most fun specs IMO
---
TBCC*. That’d be weird.. just going through WoW all over again, an endless cycle like The Matrix.
---
Warrior/Paladin can roll on all armor types, and Hunter/Shaman can roll on everything but plate?
---
The one where you disguise yourself as an orc and eventually free all the captured nether drakes and get your own:

---
I never said I dont want to farm? I just said I dont want literally all of my non raiding time spent farming..? You're saying if I want to be able to even OT or 3rd/4th seat tank I might as well quit my day job to farm mats? 
---
I also never said I dont want to put in time and effort to gear as best as I can. I have 2 kids, a wife, and work 5 days a week is all. I want to enjoy my play time when I get it. I understand some of that is spent farming mats, and thats cool. Can I farm mats easily as a warrior? How about a prot/holy pally? Have you had experience doing that with one of those classes that made it more enjoyable? 
---
That's another possible solution!  There's definitely tons of creative options that Blizzard could explore.
---
It's challenging, but not impossible.
---
I'm gonna be honest fellas, don't down vote me to abyss.. But i feel like there is a lot of population interested in private servers even post classic release. People like me who really drool over the tbc/wotlk days. I'm not interested in vanilla because TBC is just the superior experience for me personally.
---
Some people think that private servers are going to vanish over night when classic launches, that just isn't the case. Just vanilla servers are going to take a big hit.
---
Agreed, no loot trading for all our sake.
---
I could be mistaken, my memory is a little fuzzy, but I think that change was so that you could equip the gear after losing rank. You still had to have the rank to buy it in the first place
---
Yeah the emberstone staff isn't even that good compared to the staff you get from VC quest. That being said it is slightly better, but not by much. And you will out level it quickly.
---
Oh FFS we got issues keeping content on this sub then when something does get posted we have a bunch grammar nazis commenting 🤦‍♂️

I main Alliance so I don't know about Horde, but I generally can stay in the starter zones until 11/12. Then I move over to Loch Modan until 15-ish then start Westfall for the lower level quests. This usually gets me to 17-ish then I head over to Westfall and complete it, topping it off with a DM run at 19/20.
---
At that point I go to Duskwood and do the entry level quests like killing wolves and spiders, and doing all the delivery quests (something like 4 of those). This usually gets me a level. Then I go Wetlands for a few quests, then Ashenvale, then Redridge. I bounce between Ashenvale, Wetlands, Duskwood, and Redridge, usually finishing RR and WL first then finishing Ashenvale and Duskwood last. I generally get to 32-33.
---
The path I use (I changed it a bit over the years) is from a leveling guide I found on WoW-Pro but for the life of me I can't find it anymore. There are guides for the 12-20 range in the archive but the one I used started off with killing the elite yeti in Dun Morogh then that journal/bear quest before collecting kobold ears and blood sausage. I'm almost certain that it was made by James himself, even though his main Alliance guides start at 30 I recall him saying how much he loved going into Wetlands.
---
I can just imagine all the people who saw you with it just hating on you without that context lol
---
Leveling is a slog and I hate it too, but I just try to push through it to get to the awesome endgame content.  I like throwing on a show or movies to have on in the background while grinding endlessly.
---
there is nothing to test  
---
wow from 2004 and wow today are still the same games  
---
how you can be so stupid to think that a system where Blizzard clearly states, "we do not trade loot", and even puts that notice all over their support page, will somehow result in the SAME NUMBER OF TICKETS..... its just beyond me. you're just too stupid to argue with any longer.
---
Look at this : http://i.imgur.com/1QVxr.jpg
---
Blue dot = alliance town 
---
Red dot = horde town
---
Yellow dot = neutral town (either side)
---
If there's a town you can expect quests usually.
---
Ah cool, thanks. Yeah I’m going through those quests at the moment, trying to hit exalted for the mount. Only just got Friendly, the quests are okay (mainly collect and kill type stuff), guess I’ll have to see what you mean.
---
correct (assuming the hunters/shaman have trained mail. until then they cannot roll on mail)
---
I am convinced it was payback for casters rolling on the agi+ int ring! The never ending circle of abuse.
---
Lol this is why retail is better. Don't have people trying to tell you "You're not playing how you want to play" all the damn time
---
I remember sneaking around alliance zones as a mid level rogue in TBC. I had no concept of where higher level alliance players would frequently pass by despite being a low level questing area so I remained in stealth most of the time. I just wanted to explore the scenery. I recall being in the zone with the world dragon in the center surrounded by mountains but I didn't find the path right away. I had explored most of the zone, checked my map and realized there was this giant circle of undiscovered area in the center. I was like wtf. So I realized there was a single tiny path at the bottom and snuck in there. When I saw the dragon I NOPED right out of there so fast I left a smoke trail.
---
2x Cruel Barb from the same dungeon would be ideal. 
---
Also, the zone level are color-coded similarly to indicate an Alliance/Horde/either zone
---
They should be put loot trading in.
---
Kara was my first raid experience. So it was extra exciting for me as my guild mates unlocked the door so we could zone in
---
At level 10, I bounce between Westfall, Loch Modan, and finish in Darkshore. Just doing the densest, fastest quests for 2-3 levels per zone.
---
So at 18, we move onto Ashenvale for a few quick levels, then back to Eastern Kingdoms to get the dense quests in Redridge and Duskwood until ~25.
---
25-30 is wetlands and Hillsbrad. 30-32 is grinding in Alterac.
---
18 levels in about 24 hours time.
---
yeah the guy has no clue what hes talking about
---
30 is when you start having to roam to different continents every couple levels, then back to the first place, to do two more levels, then really hunt for quests
---
30 is when most of my friends drop off on private servers.
---
1-30 is definitely easier than 30+ 
---
bosses that can't be killed until the next tier releases. 
---
Not saying I won't powershift. Just not 100% sure Ill do it all the time. For bosses I think I will, for trash I think not
---
The token doesn't function like anything else on the AH. You do not set the price, players can't search for better deals on tokens. They increase and decrease in value like a real life currency or stock does, generally increasing in gold price when new items launch on the B.net app (HS expansion, WC3 remastered, new expansion) before returning to the base value of ~110-120k. Tokens have been bad for the game since they were added, but they are a FAR more complex system than you make it out to be.
---
I agree, ever since this whole issue came up I had been this.
---
The game already asks whether you are sure you want to loot (having clicked need or greed, not passing).
---
I think it's your fault if you misclick. Yeah the game can be slow at times, but it's on you if you aren't engaged enough.
---
I'm not trying to put out content. I'm making this for me and my friends, and I'm just asking for help here.
---
I mean if lots of people are doing it, there's gotta be some money in it!
---
My friend and I leveled to ~42 on a pvt server a couple years back, and between Ashenvale, Stonetalon Mountains, Desolace, STV, Arathi Highlands, Hillsbrad Foothills, Shimmering Flats, and Searing Gorge, we had beyond countless 'fairish' battles, almost none of which were predetermined. Tons of other people were leveling together, and if not often-times we'd let each other 1v1 the enemy. 
---
It turns out, on average, the people in the same zones are the *same level as you*, almost always in fact, which is something people seem to forget when they only remember the bad fights (or maybe they aren't very strong players themselves, so they lose a lot).  I would say we probably were close to 55-60% win rate in exchanges against the horde, until my buddy got intercept, at which point we started winning @ a much higher percentage. And we weren't winning because of classes or anything predetermined, it was often just because the people were worse than us, and it wasn't like we were anything good at all.
---
These battles that are predetermined tend to be just when you enter STV at a low level, and it's still kinda cool, as you constantly need to learn where to hide, shadowmeld, run. It feels like a jungle where you could get seriously messed up, and its awesome. And as you level through it you can start becoming the aggressor.
---
meh that comes at the cost of every class being the same. At the end of the day I'm going to play what I want to play, and I'm sure I'll find some likeminded people to play with. I just want to get some good input so I can make an educated choice on my class.
---
That would be interesting. What about your body becomes lootable instead of just dropping everything.
---
I'm guessing it just compares how in-game models look in relation to each other... and I can kinda understand why taurens aren't made to be 10 feet tall, they couldn't even fit through most doors.
---
10.0 feet ≈ 3.0 metres ^(1 foot ≈ 0.3m)

&gt;With that said, I’d really like to play as a tank up until high end raids. A lot of people have made being a tank in high end raids sound like its a ton of work to farm mats/flasks for raids and I dont want to spend all my non raid time just farming mats for the next raid.
---
If you want to main tank into the high end raids, its alot of farming. I don't know how much time you have but the way you phrased this makes it sound like you don't want to farm. I played a Prot Warrior in classic and it was alot of gold to keep up on repairs, enchants and consumables when we were pushing forward on content. My repair was usually 2/3 times everyone else besides my OT. Depending on what raids you are looking to do even the 3/4th tanks have to be pretty up on their game. If you only want to do it casually then ya, you can probably get away without a lot of extra farming to be an OT. 
---
I was always able to farm when I needed and found plenty of ways to make gold, usually via professions. I tended to just buy my flasks from guildies for cost etc and in exchange I'd make them things/do things at cost for them.  
---
All that said, you probably won't even be considered for raid tanking as a pally. The crushing blow mechanic is just so much easier for warriors to avoid. If you are a sometimes tank you can get away with a arms/prot build if you want to world PVP. And if you pick up nightfall you may be of even more use to your raid.   
---
Agreed. 
---
&gt;Rational people, I was thinking.
---
So your opinion.
---
&gt;Evidence is the usual thing.
---
Please do present it.
---
I don't even care to reply to you any further. As always you're just sitting on your high horse flinging insults at everyone around you. You fail at a basic level by not even understanding that Classic is aimed at Classic fans.
---
Do you people really not get how the token works?  You would not be able to sell a token  on a Vanilla server for 120k.
---
The market for Classic servers would be totally different.  Early on, you'd be selling your tokens for likely as little as a few gold, as the servers age the price would rise to sub 100, then over that, but it would NEVER reach 120k, I very much doubt it would ever reach 1k.
---
Blizz doesn't just arbitrarily create a price, keep in mind someone has to buy your token from you for that gold price, no one in Vanilla had 120k gold.
---
Someone has to buy it, who on a vanilla server has 120k to buy it from you, are you dense or just uninformed.  The token does not create gold.
---
Straight out of Morrowind.
---
I know, my point was that letting players roll on everything they can use is not fair (because some classes, like the ones I brought up can roll on more boe items and bop for friends etc). Only letting for example warriors roll on mail items, and plate (over lvl 40 when trained), and NOT on cloth and leather is my suggestion...
---
Again, the law may not see it that way. That's why lawyers exist and get paid to argue these things.
---
Yeah it's not like there's never any 'hubs' where you get a bunch of quests at once but they're more spaced out. 
---
On the other hand some of the dungeons are better for grinding really top-notch gear at this time, so you can really pimp out your character and get a lot stronger at burning through mobs.  SM is a good example.. I think many classes get big power spikes from like level 37-45 and SM is a good place where you can get top-tier blue gear, in addition to 30 point talents and a mount.. Really is a game changer. 
---
I think the worst stretches for leveling are 32-39 and then again about 48-55. 
---
If you’re starting in Elwynn forest- the quests will lead you to the east. When you finish those quests I recommend running to lakeridge in redridge mountains for flight path- you will not regret this. Some chains between westfall and redridge which require some travel back and forth. Also these two zones will easily get you up towards 23-24 if you doing additional grinding in some of the mob heavy locations. 
---
Remember quest value in vanilla was very low. Grinding is more efficient. Wasn’t until BC that quests became the dominant path to quickly leveling. Whenever you’re out and about doing a quest take advantage of tightly packed mobs to grind out in an efficient manner. I personally believe grinding, alone, is a very boring way to level but mixing it in while questing can be very efficient. If you run out of quests in a zone and are too low level to start another you’re skipping too many kills.
---
It is one of the biggest lies they tell you classic isn't for casuals and, you need to sacrifice life to play. All of that is true if you wanna be a server first imba tier one raider. That being said. That accounts for what 3% of a server pop? If thats what you want and you have no time classic isn't for you.
---
That being said. The classes are far more simplified and, easy to pick up and, play. The base game outside of T1 raiding is actually challenging and, fun. Especially to casuals. For raiding you need 40 people. So unless you are a rogue or a t1 raider. You can pretty much show up when you want because there are always room for healer and, ranged dps.
---
If you are a casual player. Classic wow is 1000X better then retail. The only arguments in defense of retail are always arguments defending HC parts of the game like, Mythics.
---
Yeah? The big ones are hosted in france, where these laws absolutely apply. Until they start hosting in eastern europe or russia they are subject to EU laws.
---
Removed for our weekly thread.
---
He doesn't have a different opinion, though. He says he can't understand people who have fun playing hard games.
---
Huge difference.
---
I mean, I don't want piercings on my body, but I'm not going on the Internet saying: Oh I don't understand people who like piercings.
---
That is a HUGE difference. It just shows absolute ignorance and intolerance to everything you don't like yourself.
---
I think outrageous was spot on.
---
yeah i turn 21 in 5 months when i played vanilla i was a 7 yo hunter so i kinda helped that meme progress 
---
I have never understood people who think that version numbers are read like decimals.
---
While elemental spec does lose out on debuffs most info I've found suggests that they actually have a nature resistance advantage in vanilla 
---
[http://vanillagaming.org/forum/index.php?topic=15951.0](http://vanillagaming.org/forum/index.php?topic=15951.0)
---
&gt;Raid Bosses everywhere have: 145 resistance to Fire, Shadow, Frost, Arcane. 70 resistance to Nature, 15 resistance to Holy.  
---
Note: Some may have slightly different resistances, and for example Ragnaros have extremely high Fire resistance. But the numbers above are accurate in 80% of the cases.  
---
&gt;After Curse of the Elements and Curse of Shadows have been applied, you will need 70 spell penetration from gear to reach the cap in abomination wing. Mages need only 60 because they get 10 from the arcane talent: [Arcane Subtlety](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=12592). 
---
&gt;Bosses generally have 70 Nature resistance base.  
---
If you have a player with Thunderfury in the raid, the [proc](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=21992) will reduce the enemy resistance with 25.   
---
&gt;45 resistance set-back equals 11.25% nature dps lost. 
---
Thats pretty bad. I'm not sure if Bloodsail and BB is worse or not. Atleast you get a hat out of that. 
---
Your opinion seems to be "get rid of the honor system because I like ganking in Stone Talon and that doesn't reward me gear, so why should there be PvP rewards available to others?"
---
That's a shit opinion
---
Most of the ones I've seen are eastern europe and russia.
---
But it's not completely ineffective. Gold selling is only truly a horror on private servers. The lack of any sort of subscription fee or initial purchase price results in gold sellers being mildly annoyed by bans at best. The lack of proper server architecture even means that gold selling companies can practically threaten private servers by DDOS'ing and other malicious activities. Private servers who fight aggressively against gold sellers can literally be brought to their knees by precisely those people.
---
It was never nearly that bad on retail because Blizzard has much better tools to combat it. Yes, you cannot wipe it out entirely, but you can reduce it to the point where it's frankly easy to just ignore the occasional whisper.
---
So policing is effective, just not 100%. So then the question simply becomes whether dealing with that little bit of gold selling is worth introducing WoW tokens for. Myself and many others will answer no to this question.
---
Yeah, well those are in a different boat but the ones people generally talk about are hosted in france, and will be turned off day one of classic or face lawsuits. The hosting company won't take the heat for that, so they will be shut off to avoid blizzard taking them to the cleaners.
---
It was introduced in Wotlk.
---
STViet fucking nam is going to be intense.  
---
I remember going there on the 3rd day of a new server and it was an insane amount of wpvp and ganking.
---
Questing wasn’t possible. Trying to do the quests where you have to kill all the panthers and shit probably had 20-30 of each faction just fighting it out for hours. 
---
I want to level to 60 really quick, but I wouldn’t mind experiencing that again. When everyone hits the 30’s around the same time and are questing in the same spot will bring the beat wpvp.
---
Especially if you want them exalted simultaneously through those two repeatable quests in Feralas.
---
The biggest has already stated they will shut down once Classic launches. The majority of the "Blizz-like" emulator audience wants Classic.
---
Private servers will still exist and some will find their core audience but Classic is doing what it was intended to do: to gain the largest portion of the Classic Wow interest and make it official. 
---
NA audiences have never been the main core on emulators anyway and Blizzard can snatch that core audience up easily along with a good portion of EU.
---
I have the too much to do problem right now and im level 22. I have a good amount of stone talon/barrens quests that are yellow and orange. I got a quest to go to tarren Mill which starts mid 20s and 1k needles is coming up as well. I also haven't even stepped foot in Ashenvale. Between these zones and the level 20-30 dungeons I feel like Ill outlevel some of the content before I even touch it
---
International copyright law does exist and most European countries are signatories to the various trademark/copyright/IP treaties that exist and have ratified them into their own laws. 99/100 The problem isn’t whether or not it’s legal, it isn’t. The problem is enforcement.
---
Blizzard can send CD letters but if the companies running the servers are not in the habit of honouring foreign requests, and the country that the letter is sent to doesn’t care, simply nothing will come of it.
---
Classic already has a huge playerbase just waiting for to play it, you dont need streamers to spread the word around. You dont NEED free exposure. 
---
What makes you think it's effective? I remember so much gold spam back in vanilla. Private servers that do nothing aren't any worse.
---
If policing were effective, just not 100% effective, I might agree with you. But all that blather about server architecture and account bans and the gold spam was just as bad, maybe worse on vanilla.
---
&gt; wow from 2004 and wow today are still the same game
---
Why are we so exited for Classic then?
---
Think of MLMs selling makeup. That logic is not sound haha. But you will make some cash. If you. Can get to silk bags quickly. There will be a niche you can exploit. 
---
Arms for you definitely. You can still tank up til 50ish if you equip a sword and shield and go into defensive stance :)
---
4Head
---
Grind out an entire bank of Mooncloth stacks all made by you.
---
many people who have gotten Gladiator titles have been in the twink scene.
---
I've also known people who have achieved gladiator titles their first season playing max rank pvp, after maining lower level twinks.
---
"Getting BiS gear  are for people who can't pvp to save their life, so they have to pad their lack of skill with gear, playing against people levelling in greens, change my mind. "
---
think about the class/character variety that could exist if every raid was level 60 and had different functioning and statted gear in each one.
---
Each level bracket has it's own meta game, and some people like the lower level meta better than max level meta
---
some people just like to trash noobs, but those players are usually the budget shitter twinks that nobody cares about
---
Something to keep in mind, you will make half the money you would have grinding mobs...
---
Grab a growth potion on a tauren and that's their real height!
---
I have leveled a few alliance non-elf characters on pservers, and always found Westfall and Loch Modan had more than enough quests to get me there. No grinding at all
---
Seems a lot easier than running to Darkshore
---
http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/boston039s_1220_alliance_leveling_guide_westfallredridge
---
or just unique stats from each raid, with all the top end raids having similar strength levels.
---
A good portion of a holy paladins gear is going to be cloth. The game wasn't designed to have specific pieces of gear for each class / spec. 
---
It's an abandoned tower of a mad mage. Why wouldn't it be menacing?
---
As treasure33333 said, make some mini games out of the leveling process.
---
If leveling away is eating at you, take a break from questing and grinding. Lots to do in each level bracket
---
* Teens Go run WC a few times for gear and sudo twink at 19 
---
* 20s? BFD is a great dungeon, lots of lore, quests and rewards from that place, maybe run it a few times till you have every piece you class needs.
---
* Mid 30s, run RFK a few times. Go kill allies/horde in Ashenvale Forest for an evening. 
---
* 40s? Sounds like it is time to run SM cath a few times. RP as a defender of AB and que into AB for 2 days in a row. Or go do Mara a few times, depending on your class Mara has some items even 60s want
---
* 50s? Well AV time, can PvP and PvE at the same time. Can kill animals and do quest turn ins, you are still being useful to the group and you gain some honor/rep along the way. Maybe once you hit 60 you'll have enough rep for some of the honored or revered gear from AV. Mid 50s is also high enough to start doing more later game dungeons like BRD, ST, maybe DM/UBRS if your group is cool carrying a bit
---
TLDR: At each level range, do some dungeons, get some gear and then PvP for a few days, then go back to leveling
---
Sure, I'm not saying they should borrow or re-use assets, that wasn't the insinuation, but they could maybe salvage some ideas they had for it, especially in the context of the lore at the time.
---
I'd rather have scrubs like you in the game than goldselling directly supported through the developer.
---
I was about to ask since I don’t remember it looking like that but figured I probably was forgetting lol.
---
Pservers will always be around for many reasons. Classic Pservers will be around because some people just don't want to pay, others just love the idea of being able to level with faster XP or whatever weird perks the admins (who all want to be god in their own little world) dole out to them and their friends. The best pservers were once about preserving the game. In the future it'll just be tinpot dictator admins and cheapskates. I'll get downvoted but idgaf. 
---
different version of the same game  
---
I liked dota 2 before 7.00 patch  
---
doesn't mean dota 2 after 7.00 is different game  
---
You can still tank the lower tier dungeons at 60 as arms. 
---
Ha no worries. The reason I bring up the idea of a new 20 man is that, while I'm kinda whatever about Classic having expanded content on top of the existing content, if they are going to do it, I think it'd be neat to have an entire linear progression of 20 mans. Maybe ZG -&gt; AQ20 -&gt; Kara -&gt; Something else.
---
So 40 man guilds would have other things to do but that if you had a 20 man guild or your attendance was slumping in a 40 man guild, there's still relevant content to do.
---
That is none of your business 
---
its literally the same game  
---
You can't be like "Riot doesn't provide version 1.0 of League of Legends that means its abandoned game"  
---
Law doesn't see it that way, because that is not what abandonware is   
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware  
---
&gt;Warriors have hamstring kiting that can reduce the damage they take by a huge amount whereas rogues have to face-tank everything.
---
You have stuns and crippling poison as rogue but I agree that it isn't significantly faster than warrior and can be a pain with alot of downtime between mobs in certain level ranges. 
---
“Accidentally” 
---
Don’t forget to grind as you quest. Grind mobs on the way to the quest, during the quest, and on the way back. You will make more money and get more xp out of your questing zones, stretching out their usefulness!
---
As someone considering maiming a Shaman, good read thank you.
---
I've always argued that "classic" refers to a design philosophy that Blizzard abandoned when Cataclysm launched. It wouldn't surprise me if Classic consists of vanilla+BC+Wrath.
---
This does not mean it can't be implemented as a 10-man in Classic. Especially considering we're getting the nerfed versions of UBRS/LBRS as 5-mans. Same with Scholomance.
---
you typically leave STV like four times to do other zones
---
Gonna be real here, I'm gonna be intentionally inefficient. Take my time, go fish in some ponds, wipe in some confused dungeon groups, do a little pvp, the works. 
---
Yup, a lot of people from the easern bloc/Russia can farm because the money they can make compares to their minimum wage jobs. 
---
Not to mention gold isn't farmed solely by people. Lots of English speaking people run several accounts at once as bots. Level 1-60 with a bot, resell account, keep gold, rinse, repeat.
---
Ok, so you are taking legal advice from wikipedia? The EU has some laws that protect consumers who bought a game and allows emulation when the company does not provide the game any longer from what I understand. You may be right that they would see it blizzard's way, but that is not a guarantee and after paying a bunch of lawyers to defend your pirate server, a judge would make the determination. Maybe blizz wins, maybe the pirates win, but blizz is unlikely to test it because a bad precedent would fuck them way more than letting those servers run another 6 months and then closing the door. 
---
When they have classic out it is an open and shut case, they are providing the game, the pirates are in the wrong. But it still probably won't make a court as blizz will threaten the hosting provider, and they will shut it off to avoid paying legal fees fighting blizzard and maybe in addition to losing have to pay out a settlement.
---
That's not a good way of evaluating it. It has the greatest value in fights lasting 21 to ~30s where it's not worth casting a second SW:P. Then you simply get 32% more damage. 
---
It averages out to save 1 GCD every 72s, but that doesn't mean fights need to last 72s+ for it to have value. There are many situations where it gives more or less value.
---
That's how it was in Vanilla. GMs didn't trade loot back then, despite all the rumors floating around.
---
Uldum would expand it, definitely. There was a point where this story is basically cut, as if "to be continued"
---
Just let holy paladin roll on cloth then, or they’ll have to rely on ml, or rolling greed and have the group pass/trade it if they don’t win?
---
It's still a way of players getting money in-game without earning it, what the fuck are you guys not getting?
---
This is how I used to do it. I would generally play my alts until the others were pretty rested. You get to 60 slower than the other guy, but you get 3x 60s much faster.
---
DING was so satisfying at EVERY level in vanilla.
---
Fucking vanilla made you really appreciate every damn level, because you had to get a LOT done just to level up one!
---
Make the first character that you do it with some that's easy to level, like hunter or druid. Then when you know it well itll be less painful on say, a warrior.
---
&gt; Tokens have been bad for the game since they were added, but they are a FAR more complex system than you make it out to be.
---
Bro come on. Fucking read.
---
The catacombs beneath it were there in Classic right? If I remember correctly you had to let somebody else fear you through the gates to get there. 
---
Those rooms were creepy as fuck!
---
I see you never pvped at 60. the gear discrepency could be far greater.
---
Yes. Lots of quests, not a lot of allies tend to go there for some reason, so doing the quests should be easier imo.
---
Ill be in darkshore from 12 to 21
---
Do those even have stats?
---
Please no. 20 or 10 man would be awesome. There is plenty of 40 man content already.
---
Dude you don't speak for everyone. There's lots of us that enjoy leveling alts. Some get bored at 60 and start a new class. Mainly the people that primarily enjoy PvP. Starting over lets you go through the brackets (when they get added) all over again with a fresh class.
---
Endgame was "2nd Playthrough" to a lot of people.
---
This time around... 85% of Playerbase got a wife and 2 kids... im sure its veeeery tempting for blizz to sell gold real expensive 😝
---
This is the fundamental truth that people are ignoring or unaware of. The ONLY time a GM ever got involved in loot disputes was in the case of theft (after trading crafting mats) or account compromisation. "I accidentally rolled need" was not a valid GM ticket.
---
yes they are, but you are being very 'fucking' one-sided, it's almost as if you have a superiority complex
---
the point I'm making is that it is BAD for the game **too**, yes, and it gives people the opportunity to make gold without earning it
---
so why are you being so god damn argumentative over it?
---
Nah this guy just told you what its supposed to be, must be it then.

Just buy wow token, 20$ 100g
---
&gt;The EU has some laws that protect consumers who bought a game and allows emulation when the company does not provide the game any longer from what I understand  
---
Sure. They still provide the game.  
---
&gt;When they have classic out it is an open and shut case, they are providing the game, the pirates are in the wrong 
---
Wrong. According to your logic, they have to provide support for every single game version or they are at risk.  
---
See how your logic is flawed? No game or company does that. If it was exploitable lots of people would've exploited it a long time ago.  
---
As someone who leveled multiple times on a 1x private vanilla server I can guarantee this isn't going to work out for you. 
---
I'm playing Druid. No way I'm going to stuxk with my priest again and with Druid I can have heaps of specs
---
My point was your original comment was a fucking lie about how tokens work. You can say they're bad for the game, but when you lie about how they actually work you just come across as a lying sack of shit because you had to exaggerate something that most people agree is bad without the lies. That's why I called you out, how the fuck do you not get that at this point? We're done here, fuck off.
---
You mean like the pirate servers currently exploiting it? Complain all you like, but if not that why has blizz not shut down these people? They are in a western country with actual copywrite laws, blizz has a big presence there, and plenty of lawyers.
---
I'm copying this from my thread that got deleted... yay, glad I lost all those positive replies.
---
I’m going to preface all of this by saying at end game I’d like to do a bit of everything, I want to be able to jump on and do a BG, or go out into the world and join in on some world PvP, or run an instance, and still be able to raid casually as well.
---
With that said, I’d really like to play as a tank up until high end raids. A lot of people have made being a tank in high end raids sound like its a ton of work to farm mats/flasks for raids and I dont want to spend all my non raid time just farming mats for the next raid. I know a lot of people will tell me to roll warrior based on this, but I’ve also read a lot of people saying that a warrior takes more time to get geared than other classes. On top of that, I’ve never played a warrior in the slightest, and I feel like only being able to deal damage with no real utility/escapes sounds awfully boring and pigeonholes what I bring to BGs/Instances. It also makes me feel like I’ll get preyed on while farming professions or just being out in the world. I don’t want to be useless while I’m without a group.
---
Because of that, Paladin really sounds ideal for me, and I know so many people will tell me how stupid it is to try and tank raids as a paladin and how I’ll never be as good as warrior for that and blah blah blah. I know. Except, I dont really want to be a part of a super serious raiding guild. A nice casual guild that raids once maybe twice a week and doesn’t expect to contend for server firsts or anything close to that is fine by me. Being a OT or even 3rd/4th seat tank sounds fine to me. So I’m assuming I’d be able to find a guild that might let me do me in that regard. The only thing that makes me nervous is if I do get to the end game raids (AQ40/Naxx) I’ll likely have to heal. Now, the only experience I have healing is as a priest in MOP, and holy moly it was the most boring time I’ve ever had in WoW. I spent more time watching green bars move than looking at the game itself. Maybe someone can weigh in on this and tell me if healing was more involved back in vanilla? If thats the case, I could live with healing once/twice a week at the end game.
---
TLDR;/Questions broken down:
---
At end game I’d like to do a bit of everything, I want to be able to jump on and do a BG, or go out into the world and join in on some world PvP, or run an instance, and still be able to raid casually as well. I’m just kind of stuck between Paladin and Warrior.
---
    The amount of farming for flasks that’s necessary as a raid MT sounds awful. Is it just as bad for an OT? Maybe I’m wrong about that all together? How much farming do you really have to do as a raid MT/OT or even just for raids in general? (I only started raiding in TBC)
---
    Was healing boring in vanilla like it is in retail?
---
    As a warrior in BGs/WPvP did you feel like you could basically only hope to kill your opponent before they kill you? Is there some utility they have that I’m not aware of? Or are you kind of gimped without a buddy to heal or help you out?
---
    Can a paladin do well in BGs without just healing? I’m cool with tossing heals once in a while if the situation really calls for it to get the W, but can I also hold down a flag in AB? Can I carry the flag in WSG as a Prot pally?
---
    Did any of you Holy/Prot Pallies feel like you couldn’t really kill people in WPvP? Even with the idea of winning via the war of attrition?
---
Does Warrior or Pally sound more like what I’m looking for? Or if you have a different opinion and a different class sounds ideal with what I’m looking for, I’m all ears.
---
edit:
---
apparently I sound like I dont want to farm anything at all and expect to MT. I do not expect to MT as a pally. I dont really want to MT. I'd rather be an off tank or 3rd/4th tank. That sounds cool. I also don't want to sound lazy and like I wont put in time and effort to gear or farm mats as best as I can. I have 2 kids, a wife, and work 5 days a week is all. I want to enjoy my play time when I get it. I understand a lot of that is spent farming mats and gear, and thats cool. Thats a fun part of the game. As long as I'm playing a class that can do all those things to some degree, and probably not the highest end, thats cool. I just dont want to roll a warrior hoping to OT or 3rd 4th seat and find I need to farm as much as a MT. or that I can barely get out and farm mats in the world cause warriors aren't good solo. I also don't want to roll a pally and be told im a shit tank before i've even had a chance to try it out, or be completely useless in BGs as a prot/holy spec.
---
I'm likely only going to have time for 1 main and maybe an alt. I want to make sure I get it right the first time.
---
As a general rule I pick up absolutely everything anyways. But STV is a good skinning place for certain.
---
I'm planning to do a similar strategy except to play two characters. The downside to this is that early on I feel like the leveling process goes too fast. I play a p server right now and I feel like I missed out on a lot of quests and areas.
---
I wasn’t speaking for everyone by any means lol. It was more a sarcastic response but good job getting offended 
---
Oh, absolutely.  I'll be playing Classic as soon as it launches.  I had no idea what I was doing back then, so I had no +spell damage, no wand, no professions levelled.  After playing a private server last year and having a paladin at 57 I have a very good idea of questing areas, how to make gold and level professions along the journey.
---
This Frog know whats up 
---
on a tbc server as well, friend just did it yesterday and got some boe blue bracers, the stam trinket and a 14 slot bag. Pretty handy for a lowbie 
---
I'll kill boars until reaching level 60
---
i was killing elite ogres outside DM on that ramp thingy. Second 60 i was killing bats near the lake in south east EPL. 
---
Make it so you to have to Dodge Roll spells and actively block attacks with directional mouse movement. Oh, and also ranged weapons as well as spells are now aim shots.
---
Deadwind was always an interesting zone.  I remember going through as a young Alliance on my way to the Swamp of Sorrows and riding around to get the exploration xp, but nearly dieing.  There was nothing there but Karazhan and it never felt empty, just like "You're not ready for this"
---
Noted.
---
But it has no value in fights lasting &lt; 18s.
---
Looking at it another way, assuming you were keeping SWP up all the time, then imp SWP on very short fights reduces your mana cost (and gives you an extra GCD in that window).
---
For the sake of argument, assume SWP costs 48 mana.
---
Without the talent, each tick costs 8 mana. 
---
If the fight lasts 21 seconds, you've spent 96 mana for 7 ticks at a cost of 13.7mp/tick
---
24 seconds = 8 ticks for 12mp/tick
---
27 seconds = 9 ticks for 10.66mp/tick
---
30 seconds = 10 ticks for 9.6 mp/tick
---
33 seconds = 11 ticks for 8.7 mp/tick
---
36 seconds = 12 ticks for 8mp/tick
---
With the talent, you have:
---
21 seconds = 7 ticks for 48 mana = 6.8mp/tick
---
24 seconds = 8 ticks for 48 mana  = 6mp/tick
---
27 seconds = 9 ticks for 96 mana = 10.6 mp/tick
---
30 seconds = 10 ticks for 96 mana = 9.6mp/tick
---
33 seconds = 11 ticks for 96 mana = 8.7mp/tick
---
36 seconds = 12 ticks for 96 mana = 8mp/tick
---
If the fight lasts 27 seconds, then in both cases you've cast SWP twice for 96 mana for an average cost of 10.6mp/tick.  Dead even as without the talent.
---
You only see any real benefit at the breakpoints.  If the fight lasts 24 seconds, you get 50% mana savings.  But after only 1 additional tick, you're even.  An intelligent player won't cast the second SWP against the low HP target and save the mana, but when it comes to any longer term encounters, it saves you GCDs and reduces the effective mana cost of SWP by 25%.
---
I think for general questing, it is *probably* not worth it.  
---
For PvP it's probably worth it.  It can be dispelled, but in most cases it won't be.
---
For  dungeons it is *probably* worth it, as elites in dungeon groups probably die in that sweet 18-24s range where you save mana.
---
For raiding, it depends on whether you're allowed to cast SWP, whether you're mana starved, etc.
---
This one! /watch?v=z8YhSMsXIW8
---
Just think it’s strange that any changes are being considered. If the goals is to use the updated client to recreate 1.12, then I understand unplanned changes are bound to happen. But this is intentional. It’s undermines the communities ability to self-correct ninjaing, which is part of the game.
---
You seem to think the alternative to WoW Token is no one buys gold, and everyone has to grind it "honestly." In reality, the alternative to WoW Tokens is blackmarket gold farmers. The people who wish to buy gold still will, and some place in China will get the money instead of Blizzard. If you played Vanilla you'd remember how vibrant the gold market was, and how every raiding guild used it.
---
In addition, I would like the token. When I was young, I could farm for hours every week. Now that I have a job, I can't. But I CAN "farm" my work for less than an hour and turn that into enough gold to raid for weeks. Let the teenagers gather my flask mats for me, and give them a few dollars for the work? Hell yes.
---
But the server dies once a few players get 60 and then just camp lowbie spots 
---
Hillsbrad, STV, Shimmering Flats, Tanaris. Literally won’t do a single quest without seeing opposite faction. Tons of action in all of these places. Lots of fun. 
---
As long as the #nochanges crowd are fully aware that loot trading WAS a thing.  So if you want NO loot trading AT ALL... be aware you're advocating for changes.
---
I’ve thought about a first character as a mage so I can AoE farm in order to pay for the mounts for the others. Do you have any thoughts on that?
---
It will be all groups of friends. WoW is a social game. People aren't inherently bad or selfish, but fundamentally we're all self serving. And in large groups, we have an extraordinary susceptibility to taking part in activities that would be socially unacceptable under "normal" circumstances. If we feel we're being cheated, we will join in the cheating to keep up, especially if it can be done with literally no consequence. It's human nature, no matter how much you think the best of people. Loot trading in ANY form needs to be extremely limited, but I wouldn't say outright impossible.
---
I don't play retail. But I just realized I could **potentially** play retail to fuel my classicwow sub. Depending on how much I want to hate myself... how long would it take to get a wowtoken per month?
---
Who cares if it’s content or not. He’s asking for help while he prepares for classic, he’s not trying to entertain you. I enjoy doing that planning level routes and theory crafting etc imo this is a fine place to share that or ask for advice. 
---
Actually they did.  Our guild leader/loot master dude gave loot to the wrong person a couple of times.  He contacted a GM and they were able to resolve it.  There were logs or something they were able to verify the loot dropped so that's why they did it.
---
It's not nearly as cut and dry as that, and your statement is much more wrong than it is right.
---
This is the one thing I hope they address somehow.  The way it is in the classic form is simply not healthy.
---
calm down, I'm not the guy he is replying to, im just saying everything is content. i'm not bashing anyone
---
Why even argue? He's not a lawyer but he DID read that one Wikipedia article lol.
---
I watch random YouTube videos lol
---
Ditto. Let me know if you find anything. I was just going through how stats benefit the different classes (e.g. 1 agility = x attack power for hunters, but y for rogues) and was fascinated. We need more of that kind of content on this sub.
---
Or an audiobook. Game of Thrones or LOTRO sounds just so good. 
---
Ideally I'd start Westfall about level 11, do the easiest quests to get to 11, head to LM till 12-13. Come back till 15 or so, finish LM till 16, finish Westfall 17ish, then Red Ridge. Should be enough exp to bypass Darkshor and Ashenvale if you want.
---
I think you mean http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/boston039s_1220_alliance_leveling_guide_westfallredridge
---
Blizzard is a multi billion dollar company in a &gt;hundred billion dollar industry. Anyone who thinks private servers will stand a chance after classic's release is totally delusional.
---
I'd say paladins. On retail it was lulzy because of melee damage potential with gear+ enchants on top of having top tier survivability. 
---
"Are you going to play classic?"
---
"No, classic costs money, this is free."
---
Heared many times on pservers.  I guess that's delusion of the highest form.
---
I know the other guys were giving you grief, but if you could post the finished product, I would appreciate it. Even if it's made in MS paint.
---
That's no link. 
---
Boom, lawyered.
---
But summer is almost over...
---
Was a hunter back then, loved it and rerolled on Nost. 
---
Now I go Priest and heal the shat out of everyone for a new experience and a new role. 
---
Progressive gear is fine. What's not fine is quest greens in the new zones blowing away tier gear. Naxx gear and BC heroic blues should have been approximately even. That would have left a relatively linear path for non raiding folks to follow. Yes the leveling content would have been fairly trivial for folks who raided in vanilla but that would have been at least partly mitigated by the new level cap. I think making. The other option of course is to make the new zones hard enough that they basically require raid gear and casual folks get left behind and need to progress through the raid content. They basically picked the worst of both and catered exclusively to the casual crowd. 
---
im guessing that after classic comes out we will see a big increase in tbc servers
---
Your comments were about tokens ruining the economy, and you were using completely incorrect information to base that on, now you are changing your stance.
---
If you don't want them, that's fine, but don't lie just to make them look worse than they are.
---
To me the tokens are an acceptable way of fighting gold selling.  I had my account hacked by a gold seller back in vanilla before any form of 2FA, it fucking sucked, when I got my account back I'd lost everything, and they even deleted my professions (to this day I don't get that), 3rd party gold selling is beyond toxic.  I'm not for or against them, there are very strong pros and cons to them, but can't we at least have an honest discussion about them, not telling people they will flood the game with gold.
---
I distinctly remember killing some bears in winterspring for my first 60 :)
---
You can go from wetlands to dark shore on boat so you done the run once from loch Modan to wetlands which you'll likely have to do anyway and it makes going between these two zones really easy.
---
That said loch Modan, while one of my favourite zones in the game, does not have many quests compared to the other two and may require you to go to westfall or red ridge anyway
---
just 10% at honored
---
Definately this. I got the insane achievement when it was introduced. However I basically had first done steamwheedle cartel exalted and then discovered the insane achievement. I think the last rep I did was darkmoon faire and I remember being so nervous if me now being hated with steamwheedle cuz I went exalted with bloodsail (you had to kill a goblin in Badlands 4000 times btw). Luckily I got the achievement, but I never went back to deliver librams in Dire Maul ANOTHER time, it was just too much for me :P
---
It's very good for general questing.
---
The analysis is a little simplistic. You'll always cast it on every target, and multi-target pulls and PvP fights last longer than 18s.
---
Improved SW:P opens a lot of those possibilities up because it makes SW:P so ludicrously dpm and d/time efficient.
---
I used to ignore darkshore as a non-elf and just go between Loch modan, westfall and red ridge, but man darkshore is really good for questing and leads into more quests in Ashenvale that I'm pretty sure you can't get otherwise. Your 20s should be easy as alliance tbh. Ashenvale, some of red ridge left, duskwood, and wetlands. Lots of quests and other than ashenvale you avoid horde
---
It depended on the GM. Some would some wouldn't.
---
This is a good point. There's a good amount of interest in the already but most have been focused on vanilla for a while. I'll play both tbh as long as classic is good.
---
It’ll probably be fine in the beginning but they’ll fuck it up later for sure. New Blizzard is so out of touch with their playerbase it’s become unrecognizable.
---
I plan on playing a fuckton but I will simultaneously level 2 characters right off the bat.
---
One will be a group focussed one like a Priest/Warrior/other that I level with my friends. Our plan is to stay on a similar level at all times and focus on doing a lot of dungeon content and the likes. This character will very likely have a large resting bonus since we will be 3-4 players (maybe even 5), which is a good thing too, since leveling with a group of more than 3+ is hard to do efficiently (2 is optimal for "hard" leveling classes like the mentioned ones).
---
The other one will be a more independand character like a Hunter/Warlock/Druid/Mage/other that I can easily level fast and alone. I want one of my characters to be a good farmer, which is most likely this one but doesn't have to be.
---
There is a huge benefit of leveling 2 characters at roughly the same time.
---
First of all it is simply more fun to have around 2 characters that complement eachother in terms of farming and utility (one for grouped content one for farming), especially in the endgame. I'am simply not going to farm with a Priest / Warrior and it can be harder to get into grouped content as a DPS. 
---
Secondly you are going to spend less /played time for equal results if you plan on having 2 characters anyways. Many players will try to rush 60 and then they will hit a wall and get up an "alt" anyways, ending up doing both inefficiently. If you level 2 at roughly the same time you get double the experience bonus.
---
Third if you hit 60 with two, you have more options to find your community both in terms of the characters you play and the 60 population. I have no intentions of playing with a power progression guild, since I don't want to spend more time and effort on the game to get bored faster. I feel like a lot of people underestimate how much more efficient and skilled we will be this time around. No more shitty connections, Hunters who can't kite and, people who click their spells. Those problems were numerous back in the day but will be much, much rarer this time.
---
And I've heard the opposite. So what?
---
They had no plans of shutting down, I see them taking and keeping the torch. 
---
Man we sucked back in Vanilla. It took us a while to clear MC. I remember the very first time we stepped in we legit wiped to the first two giants... now i just read about how easy everything was 
---
your statement is absolutely nothing  
---
Shamans have nothing to destinguish themselves from any other class as any better. Elemental can 1 shout true enough but, so can every other caster class and, most do it better. Enhance can one shot but, again so can all the other melee but, they also do it better.
---
Then you look at primary roles. Where they both heal. In this the paladin has Bubble and, cleanse. Making it one of only two classes in the entire game that can dispel deadly cc spells. Holy paladin is a million times better then resto shaman.
---
So in conclusion. I think Shamans and, Pally are pretty well balanced to each other. The shamans off specs are better but, they aren't op. The paladins primary spec is way better and, the later the expac gets the more OP it gets. Paladins in Naxx gear don't die ever.
---
&gt;You mean like the pirate servers currently exploiting it?  
---
This makes no sense. They are not exploiting the thing we're talking about at all.  
---
&gt;Complain all you like, but if not that why has blizz not shut down these people?  
---
Because why would Russia or some other EEU country give a shit about what US has to say?  
---
&gt;They are in a western country with actual copywrite laws, blizz has a big presence there, and plenty of lawyers.  
---
Most are not. There is also the cost issue.  
---
You might forget how much you actually need to *grind* to level up in vanilla. Quests become tedious/inefficient and even too scarce after level 30 or so, meaning you are going to spend alot of time just farming respawns. The exp bonus dimishes that by a fair amount.
---
This is not how it looked in vanilla. This was in alpha and was scrapped in beta
---
Ele is what I want to play too. After you get you Zandalar Hero charm and, Talisman of Ephemeral power. You are like Zeus chucking lightning from the heavens. 
---
No they don't this sub has an issue with hating on retail even when they know nothing about it. And those of us who like Modern and Vanilla can get fucked.
---
JUST SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE, TOKENS DON'T GENERATE GOLD AND GO FOR 120K ATM. If anything it removes gold from the economy because AH.
---
Explain.
---
That's a flawed argument. You will be grinding gold faster the higher your level is. So in terms of /played you will actually have your mount *faster* than someone who doesn't utilize the resting bonus as much, even though that player might get the mount at a lower level.
---
Actually theres a huge difference in that its from Blizzard to Blizzard games. Which blizzard can track.
---
Hunters had a lot of qol upgrades as well in TBC and WotlK. I will miss them in classic but oh well!
---
I dont think kharazan looked like this in vanilla did it? I thought this was alpha
---
Eh I still cant get over Runas the Shamed.
---
But when you solve that issue, which isn't that complicated to begin with, the difficulty dissapears. A better design choice would have been to build in the difficulty into the fights, not in the recruitment. 
---
Burning Crusade was announced in October 2005, Naxx came out in June 2006 and the first clear was in September. I would think it was the fact that the new expansion would be out soon that would cause people to stick around rather than any incentive from Naxx. (Beyond trying to be one of the first on the server to clear it)
---
&gt; loot trading is not allowed ever
---
This. Making things forgiving and 'meta-gaming' breaks immersion as well as incentive to decency. Players should learn to handle their mistakes, not have every mistake fixed by someone else.
---
Probably 90/10 after 6 months 
---
Keep in mind that full rested bonus is only applied up to 1 level after your current one. So if you're 30 and a half, your max rested will be up to 31 and a half. And I believe it took about 30 or 40 real life hours sitting in the inn for the whole rested bonus to stack up. Maybe more.
---
Still, it's always a nice bonus when you had to be away from the game and you come back to see that endless blue bar.
---
Personally, I am not bothered by leveling in Classic since this time I'm planning on making at least 2 level 60s. Which means I might take my sweet nostalgic time for my main, but my alt will definitely focus on getting to 60 asap, which again might take a few good weeks, maybe a month.
---
Level cap should have ended at 90 with Cata and Pandaria. WoD could have been just garrison leveling, Legion artifacts and BfA the heart. The superfluous level increases were unnecessary, and it really shows now with all the pruning and hackneyed procs
---
angry much retard? tokens are detrimental to the game, go cry your retail tears somewhere else lol
---
they would still ruin the economy eventually, fuckface.
---
take your superiority complex elsewhere, and go enjoy your 'wow tokens' on retail.
---
Luls OP = Casual
---
The raids do get harder. BWL is certainly harder than MC. MC was the first raid and I don't think it should be overly complex. And MC gets harder as you get further in. Domo has alot of moving parts. AQ, both 20 and 40 both have some interesting fights. Buru/Moam were always fun with odd mechanics. I think the raid difficulty scales up well. But I'd still defend saying that MC is more about coalescing into a raid than actually defeating the bosses.
---
Or would you disagree?
---
&gt; tokens are detrimental to the game
---
I've only said that in 3 comments. Go play in traffic you illiterate fuck.
---
nice kayfabe
---
Thanks, I'll probably just get as little extra xp as possible, and move between the starting areas. Can also filter quests by level and faction to ensure that everything gets done on the way up
---
so why are you arguing? oh wait it's your superiority complex
---
FWIW, you can go into retail completely blind and still be underwhelmed. I resubbed at the start of legion and made a conscious decision to avoid metagaming. I was still thoroughly underwhelmed by the world building and the writing.
---
Yeah, once its released, classic won't be going anywhere. Plenty of time to level at whatever pace you want and join a raid guild when you reach max, if you want, or not, level an alt, or pvp, the possibilities are endless, thats what classic is all about!
---
Fair. I guess it’s just the vibe that I got from the books. Karazhan was a bastion of knowledge and culture before Medivh did the thing. It was a wonderful place. Even before seeing it in game I imagined it as a mysterious yet tragic tower of lost and forgotten knowledge rather than a spiked fortress.
---
Because you're a liar. That's why you've been called out. 
---
Not a bad idea. Though mages tend to have a decent bit of down time they are still comparatively easy to level. Personally I would do hunter, and when you need money sell princess runs in mara. A good hunter can get to and solo the princess and you bet your ass rogues will pay for that ring. Taking a stealth class makes it super easy, but I ran thru with my shaman while a hunter trained trash away, you both just have to really know what you're doing.
---
Morrowind is waiting for you, outlander.
---
I'm a 'liar'? pretty extreme considering my points are valid, lol
---
it's okay pal, maybe you can't read
---
or maybe you're just such a diehard wow token fan that if anyone says anything against them, you sit there furiously defending it lol
---
it's ok retail scrub, I'll probably find you keyboard turning in STV
---
Do you ever just read random scrolls you find on the floor, turning you into Superman for 2 seconds before falling to your death?
---
Resist gear was kind of perfect for this. It kept a lot of later dungeons relevant just to farm out a resist set.
---
What he is proposing is Kara retuned for 60 and all of the loot has the same power level as Molten Core, which has the same power level of every other raid in the game. 
---
I  made this mistake on a level 32 warrior, I had just gotten my whirlly wind axe and tried to run to STV from BB... so many gorillas
---
No point in continuing this discussion.
---
IIRC, you could use those to speed run the game at the beginning and beat it in like, 10ish minutes. 
---
my thoughts exactly, some people, you know, are just full blown retarded
---
others, you know, have a twig up their ass, and have to debate and argue when it's not even necessary
---
You might enjoy Guild Wars 2 then. The level cap is the same today as it was at launch. The final boss of the hardest raid drops gear equal in power to gear that could be crafted at level cap before the first expansion. 
---
I agree, but the system in vanilla was "contact a GM", and like it or not that's not feasible anymore - maybe they should recruit community GMs to fill in the gaps and answer support queries like this, that's would be an interesting solution. 
---
Back in vanilla there was almost no one who wanted loot traded from dungeons - but now with all this pre-raid BIS lists and stuff coming out I guess the people who really really really need that blue shield will rise significantly.
---
As seen in [MadSeasonShow's Youtube video](https://youtu.be/lYeZM2VFatI)
---
&gt; Regeneration: Health regeneration rate increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.
---
Just another thought, here. But the main reason that I've seen that people don't want loot trading is because players can get together and stack their rolls. But honestly, cant players get away with that without loot trading? Are GMs going to be that scrupulous to make sure this hasn't happened before moving the loot from one too to another? 
---
24 AP, better than int/spirit staff, obviously something with AGI on it is best 
---
Wow, you are so far off and have no idea. They are exploiting the law as a shield against blizz in europe. The EU has laws too, as I would hope you are aware, including copyright law. This has nothing to do with the US and everything to do with a rights holder enforcing their rights under the law. The hosting company will currently not just take these servers down, because it might not be illegal under those laws. 
---
As soon as classic hits it is undeniably illegal under those laws and they will take those servers down to avoid lawsuits from blizz. This is simple stuff, and I think you are being willfully ignorant because you don't like reality. Pirate servers will be forced out to places like russia  where copyrights are hard to enforce, they might still exist but will be a shadow of the current ones. High ping, more downtimes and shadier people running them, but hey save your $15 and play there, no skin off my ass.
---
The silithid in the south is great, their strength gets weaker and weaker the further north you go. Remember the termite mounds in the southern barrens that was a silithid nest? I remember feeling a sense of impending doom going to silithus knowing that was there home.
---
This is true BUT the rumors /u/konwizzle refers to declare or imply that it was common to game GMs into taking dungeon loot from a rightful winner and giving it to a scammer. This false reality is then used to support the argument that things were always bad, when they were not.
---
Our guild definitely had one or two raid loot master distribution accidents corrected by GMs as well. It was a nice and infrequently needed service that I'd gladly sacrifice if the only alternative is to have systematic loot trading. 
---
Summer in the northern hemisphere, where Blizzard is. :) As in June, July or August.
---
And the reason they did that is $
---
Done. It will update in a bit automatically.
---
I do this by rotating through characters. 
---
"A better design choice would have been to build in the difficulty into the fights, not in the recruitment."
---
Isn't that exactly what LFR tried to do though?
---
I got WoW on Christmas of 2005 lol.  What year on Christmas did you ding 60?
---
Male Orc Hunter here! Honestly I know I'm going to be super casual so whatever makes getting to 60 and grinding gold the easiest, the better.
---
Orc for stun resist because I love PvP.
---
Just carry some invisibility potion if you get camped.
---
And why would you be camped in the first place unless you did something to deserve it? I mean sure it can happen but the sense of danger and adrenaline makes it totally worth it.
---
One of the main reason's I quit private servers was because of corrupted GMs making R14 chars out of thin air, or selling gold to gold sellers, etc. I'm still amazed people are still playing them now (knowing Classic will be out).
---
This pretty much describes how Guild Wars 2 does things. The end game isn't about increasing your power. The "epics" (known as ascended items) that people were crafting a few months after launch are equal in power to the items dropped off the final boss of the hardest raid released 5 years and 2 expansions later. Your level is scaled to the zone you're in, so even at max gear at level cap, you can go fight the level 20 world boss in the starting zone and have a real challenge. PvP is normalized so everybody has equal stats. 
---
It can be fun, I played GW2 for over a year and it does a LOT of things right, but there is definitely something lost when you take away the gear grind. It is a different feeling than what WoW offered. WoW has been about competing against other players and trying to get better gear than others, when everybody has equal power, the whole game experience is different. 
---
&gt;Just carry some invisibility potion if you get camped.
---
With what money? 
---
&gt;And why would you be camped in the first place unless you did something to deserve it?
---
Some people are simply assholes. 
---
Getting into Hyjal from winterspring by glitching up the mountain. 
---
Sounds like you don't want to put the effort in game to reap in game rewards.  Something special about vanilla is that everyone starts on an equal playing field, and someone's financial status irl won't affect their in game progression.  You clearly don't want to put the effort in, in the game, so you shouldn't play classic, or understand that you will be behind others because you won't be spending as much time playing the game as them. If that makes you angry, there's nothing you can do about but play more.  You shouldn't resort to ruining classic for the people who want that old school mmo experience because you cannot play as much as you want to and you'll be behind others.  Classic isn't for everyone, retail wow exists, you will be able to satisfy yourself there. 
---
&gt; The people who wish to buy gold still will
---
Yeah and those people are cheating and should be banned.  Everyone knows there will be gold farmers/buyers, and Blizzard needs to do their best to detect gold sellers and buyers.  Frankly, those players should be perma-banned.  They shouldn't just throw their hands in the air, say "ah fuck it, we will sell gold instead."  Players are more likely to buy wow tokens and gold from blizzard than they are from a shady 3rd party.  
---
&gt;how every guild used it.
---
?
---
Never seen this one! Nice one
---
&gt; So your opinion.
---
Thanks for agreeing I'm the rational one here.
---
&gt; Please do present it.
---
That's the funny thing, I thought I did. The continued existence of RMT in every MMORPG that doesn't have a cash shop was, I thought, evidence that it would not be possible to stamp it out in Classic.
---
What did you think it was?
---
&gt; You fail at a fundamental level by not even understanding that Classic is aimed at Classic fans.
---
I guess you fail at a fundamental level by not even understanding that airy-fairy declarations like "but it's *for the fans*" make no difference to whether or not gold farmers will sell gold, or Classic players buy gold.
---
are you serious? you know you can just type [youtube.com](https://youtube.com) before that right? don't know if it's allowed to post links
---
Eh.  Discussion is not content. 
---
Just carry some invisibility potion if you get camped. If that doesnt work you can always scan the AH on your bankalt or level an alt with rested xp for a while. Ooooor you know, ask for help from your allies and play some pvp.
---
that's like saying lurkers aren't an advertisement product
---
&gt; if the only way to buy gold is through shady 3rd party companies, with a very real risk of: getting permanently banned, getting hacked or getting scammed, then there is way less gold buying going on overall than if blizzard officially sanctions it through the token. 
---
Like I said, in reality buyers very rarely if ever got banned for buying gold, the majority of customers got what they paid for, and there was a widespread understanding that most of the top raiding guilds did it. Ain't nobody got time to farm gold for the consumables they went through.
---
I think a lot of people's reasoning is a bit like this: I was scared to buy gold. Therefore everyone was scared to buy gold.
---
&gt; Besides, the token didn't even fix RMT, it is still happening to this very day.
---
It has to have some effect decreasing their sales and their profits, although obviously they aren't going to be publishing their sales figures.
---
To be honest, vanilla raiding is pretty straightforward thing excluding fights like C'thun and a few Naxx encounters. 
---
It is not a rocket science to learn your role and what you should and what you should not be doing during specific encounter. If someone fails to do so consistently then you might want to consider a replacement to maintain healthy and pleasurable raiding environment. 
---
Also you could get under SW by jumping to the lamp in trade district and then falling through the wall.
---
No its not. 
---
Umm ok here's a statement then: there's a perfectly valid argument that wow today is a completely different game from wow 15 years ago. Of course that's for the courts to decide, not you or me. And if this need to be spelled out for you like it just was, you have absolutely no idea how copyright law works as related to 'abandonware' and really have no place in discussing it with such authoritarian demeanor.
---
&gt; Its rad that people find it fun, but i just do not understand the enjoyment
---
For me, it's just the constant risk.  It makes the environment feel more alive and adds to the feeling that the Horde really are our enemies.
---
No one enjoys being ganked.  I hate it.  It makes me rage.  But knowing that that threat is constantly there...it just adds a certain magic to the whole experience.  You're not "safe" anywhere - you really are at war.
---
I’m in the camp that doesn’t think loot trading is going to be that big of a deal but I also agree with this. 
---
I didn’t even know requesting a GM to move loot was a thing. I don’t remember it ever being an issue or ever encountering a group that needed to sort things out that way. If Blizz just said too bad, be more careful next time, I doubt it would have any significant affect on the game. 
---
I hate memes.
---
For early gold you can't beat a hunter or warlock. Mara farming is very lucrative and at least on a bm spec'd hunter it can be done in like half pre-bis gear (I can't really comment on lock gear requirements but should be doable in a least pre-bis). Mage AoE farming takes a fair bit of int and/or spelldamge to finish any worthwhile mobs before you oom.
---
For Horde, it's only 20-25 which is a bit awkward from my experience. Ashenvale is too high level, Thousand Needles it too high level, Hillsbrad Foothills is on the other side of the globe.
---
I recommend doing whatever you can in Stonetalon Mountains/South Barrens, as well as travelling to Zoram Strand in west Ashenvale. It's a bit of a long trek, but it's useful to have the FP and the journey and quests there pad your XP nicely. In the end I find that the choice boils down to either running WC to pad xp or going to Hillsbrad. I personally prefer just running WC once or twice over running all the way over to Hillsbrad.
---
Once you get to like level ~25-26 you can comfortably move to Thousand Needles which will keep you satisfied for a fair time. Subsequently you can return to Stonetalon/Ashenvale and finish stuff there.
---
Not my adventure but I remember seeing some Troll in WSG standing in front of our top gate before the match even started.. Remember people glitching over AB gates and I still have no idea how lol. Where they cheating?
---
No, I looked through both Boston and Maws and it wasn't them. There are images in those guides that look extremely familiar, making me think that the guide I used was an older version that doesn't exist anymore.
---
Western Plaguelands. Killing mobs to grind out the final bits of the level.
---
You got a 10% faction discount at honored and 10% global discount for being at least rank 3
---
**None of those changes are going to happen.**
---
I can't believe some people are this cynical. 
---
Wall jumped a Horde raid into Stormwind once. Me and a few other Warlocks started somewhere around Redridge/Burning Steppes, and were able to fall down an incline and into the basement of the Slaughtered Lamb. Couple dozen soul shards later and some lowbies were very confused when Horde started pouring out of the inn.
---
I expect the token to come in 5-6 months after launch.
---
Once all the tourist are gone and a lot of people have hit 60 and subs start dropping 
---
I like how even after release, Blizzard were still confident in the hopes of pushing out Karazhan as a raid (since it's listed under the 'For Instance'-section). It's a shame I never got to see it myself (stopped right after TBC), but I hear it's one of the best instances they've made in the later years. 
---
if i'm correct, wow classic is probably going to be hype and huge for Activision. they're not going to just sit idle and let potential mass earnings go by the wayside, they're a business &amp; they literally only care about profits, this is obvious with retail. the majority of people are unhappy with retail. it's not a challenge, everything is easy mode. you have guilds going 7/9 on new mythic raids the day they're released &amp; leveling is smashing buttons and eat cheetos, no critical thought required. i'd prefer not seeing wow classic go to this.
---
there are 2 types of people on this issue:
---
those who don't want to actually put in an effort to earn things &amp; pay to win/flex
---
those who want to put in the effort to earn things
---
imo activision should just pander to both groups &amp; introduce realms with tokens &amp; without tokens. 
---
If no cost was the driving factor in the success of private servers, we'd see a lot more of them for current content. Post WotLK private servers are basically non existent. Classic and TBC servers have massive populations because it's content that you can't play anymore. Why was there no MoP private servers during MoP? WoD? Legion? If not having to pay money was so important to people, surely private servers would have been flourishing during those expansions?
---
I've gotten absolutely no indication from any of the content we've seen or the words of the developers working on it that this will be a failure. "hurr durr activision" arguments aside, this seems like a real passion project for all involved, and they seem quite committed to release an authentic Classic experience. 
---
Tauren could also ride the r11 raptor.
---
&gt;30 is when you start having to roam to different continents every couple levels
---
try at least 3 times per level
---
I don't want to be a guild leader or officer, that's not my business. I don't want to lead or overpower anyone. I shall like to help everyone if possible.  
---
And I found that as a regular raid member, the biggest thing I could possibly do to help everyone, was to become "invisible" in every place other than the DPS meter.  
---
What I mean by this is that when we wipe, it wasn't because I screwed up. When we're told to stack, I stack *exactly* on top of the star mark. Not 1 inch to either side, but exactly on top. When we skip trash, the path I follow is a perfect mirror of the person leading us through it.  
---
The only place I wanted people to see evidence of my existence was on the top of the DPS meter.  
---
I never want to be that guy that died by himself on Thaddius during a polarity shift.  
---
I hope to find a guild of 39 other raiders who have the same mentality.  
---
&gt;Wow, you are so far off and have no idea. They are exploiting the law as a shield against blizz in europe  
---
Piracy is whole other topic compared to abandonware and essentially company losing rights to its product. How are you so far off?  
---
&gt;The EU has laws too, as I would hope you are aware, including copyright law  
---
I hope you are aware that EU is not the same as Europe.  
---
&gt;Pirate servers will be forced out to places like russia where copyrights are hard to enforce,  
---
Most of them already are.  
---
&gt;High ping, more downtimes and shadier people running them 
---
Hasn't been a problem for the last 15 years.  
---
&gt;&gt;no 7.2" hoof mommy draenei gf, life is suffering
---
&gt;there's a perfectly valid argument that wow today is a completely different game from wow 15 years ago  
---
No there isnt. Its literally the same game. Its not WoW 2.  
---
Will enjoy your post history once classic launches, you will clearly be one of the crying babies. 🤣
---
that nelf has belf face  
---
I could disappear for 1 week taking annual leave to be honest O.0
---
That's not really it. The countries don't see the servers as illegal because Blizzard doesn't offer the product anymore. As soon as Classic WoW launches then Blizzard will lay the hammer down and those countries will allow it.
---
Sharding is already confirmed.  They've said limited use, but I've seen Empire Strikes Back, and I pray they don't alter the deal any further.
---
Or failing that find some podcasts/radio shows you enjoy. It's how I learned to enjoy cooking/walking. Stick on a podcast and let my body go on autopilot.
---
A true efficient leveling path goes back and forth between zones you’ve already been due to the levels needed for quest varying within each zone
---
Given how crazy some people are about Azerite power, the answer would seem to be yes, people would greatly inconvenience themselves for a bit of DPS.
---
Facts
---
Yeah, I am pretty sure the letter from the lawyer didn't have anything to do with it....
---
Piracy in this case is tied into it, and if you don't know that I can't help you. I'm done here, as you are clearly a troll. The EU is where these laws apply, it's where the big servers are. Have fun in fantasyland, playing russian hosted pirate servers. I'll just play classic, and laugh when any pirates left get slapped down in the courts.
---
Yes, but that one didn't solve misclicks. It would be the exact same system but with the ability to chose to solve misclicks if you wanted. Kinda like a third option beside master loot and roll.
---
I have several theories, which range from unlikely to really unlikely, but I believe all are realistic scenarios:
---
1. Blizzard purposefully shoots the project in the foot to show how good live is, and to prove once and for all that we thought we did, but we don't.
---
2. Too many people come from live and bring their hopes and dreams with them.  They just want to see the pre-cata world, but with the post-cata niceties.  They complain over and over on the forums, and just like has happened too many times with Blizzard, they cave to the whining and make changes that do not make the game better.  (See: Cataclysm 5-mans).
---
3. Blizzard applies the logic they applied to the starter zones at launch:  if a convenience can be added to fix a problem, just do it.  So they broaden the changes they can make in order to "fix" the problems with Classic, and take it to a point where it is not built like Classic.
---
4. They are not able to properly replicate the feel of Classic on the 7.3.5 client.  We end up with a game that is mostly classic, but where you can definitely feel like something is "off".  This may be spell timing, it may be the physics of how stuns work, it may be how things spawn and despawn, or health regen, or something similar.  But it won't quite be "blizz-like".
---
5. Activision steps in and says that Classic must have new features, especially a cash shop.
---
6. The game doesn't get the right level of support, and as a result problems with the game that should be dealt with (like bugs and glitches, and other things a GM should get involved in) go unresolved and the game becomes unplayable too long after the weekly reset.
---
I'm not hoping that any of these are the case.  I'm hoping it is as close to Classic as possible.  But I realize that may not happen.
---
idk about the others, but personally, i care more about people having accessiblity than forcing my own moral ideals on them. I Frankly dont give a damn if its technically cheating if it means they actually have the chance to play the game.
---
Not classic/tbc but in cata we had a glitch were we had two Alliance flags in Warsong Gulch:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/4cbSTXI](https://imgur.com/a/4cbSTXI)
---
Was this the place that (I think) players would become chess pieces?  I always wanted to do that 
---
Thank you very much for this summary! 
---
There is one part on the Horde side I really liked about Thrall explaining why the Horde should give a fuck about the entire Onyxia ordeal in the first place. 
---
*Our position with the Alliance right now is a tenuous one. Skirmishes and smaller battles do take place, but there is peace - something our people have not known for millennia. Would you give this up and plunge us into the maw of chaos again but against a new foe? One that will not rest until we are destroyed?*
---
I really liked this part, it really stuck with me. 
---
I admire that you are getting paid to do these calculations. I also fear the number of dead dogs resulting from loot trading.
---
I have been playing mostly on a cozy realm lately , so maybe that's why my experience is better
---
No, piracy is whole other topic.  
---
The most pathetic thing you can do is call someone "troll" in order to try and invalidate what they say.  
---
Its truly sad.  
---
You lost
---
I must say I did exactly that on my last lvl 60. Found a path to quest outside STV for the lvl 35-45 parts 
---
Hey which class is a hard counter to a mage?  
---
I'm trying to learn stuff.  
---
Eveytime I come here I get slammed for saying no loot trading but now everyone is anti loot trading!? What bizaro world is this! 
---
Of course but only a handful of people actually need to be involved in the organization aspect of it.  Most of the raid doesn't need to know or care about organization they just have to show up.
---
When people say it's easier they mean the actual raids themselves not the stuff external to raids.
---
*Facepalms*  
---
It applies to every raid, before and after anything else gets announced...  
---
It's not just specifically about Naxx/BT...
---
Medivh wasn't some diabolical cartoon villain. He was originally a superhero cartoon wizard. So no, his tower doesn't have cartoon spikes.
---
This guy knows his stuff.  There are a couple other things that make Ele PvE not viable but I imagine we will see memes where Ele does 5000 DPS on Lucifron. Also Chain Lightning is more powerful than LB in most scenarios.
---
But that would still be gear grind, it just needs to be "watered down" to very small improvements, so that you need longer time to reach "the top", with the main thing being that you do set a "top".
---
? That's exactly how each and every expansion pack has worked since TBC. You didn't notice how people moved en masse to the new zones? I mean, I can't blame them, but it's the effect of how the direction the game took.
---
but that wouldn't be vanilla-like, since GMs could and did redistribute loot back in vanilla
---
This dungeon has and forever will be my favorite. 
---
Miss my kara raiding guild, a lot of great nights with a amazing guild.
---
Voracity - Blade's edge &lt;3
---
Kinda intentional. At this point it’s in the client they are using to recreate 1.12. So they would have to undo it to not have loot trading.
---
you're a shit hole
---
Yeah or you could no life it and get it done in 10 days flat 
---
Why should WoW be some "forevergame"? I don't mind that you can "finish" it, however you might define that. There's plenty of other games too, it'd be fucking horrible if WoW was all that is on offer.
---
Dwarf Pally, Troll Priest
---
Because the concept of "end game" is not exclusive to vanilla or any game. It's a concept, and like him, I love the end game. I love striving to reach the end game and become the most powerful character I can be in any game.  
---
Anthem is about to come out, and even though it looks like a dumpster fire, I am very much looking forward to the end game, because the idea of being super powerful is what I love.  
---
No does he love *vanilla's* end game? That remains to be seen, just as I don't know if I love Anthem's.  
---
I've done this a few times. The area is different than in TBC, but many parts are similar. Use to take friends there to see a completely empty zone.
---
World of Worldcraft?
---
Yes, that's exactly the standard approach. With some factions you can get enough rep by the time you're 40!
---
Being feared into a tree, glitching through the ground, then falling to the center of the earth. Had to wait 20m for a GM to come find and rez me.
---
Most of the big servers still host in France.
---
Nost shut down to make a point, not because they were forced to
---
Thanks for making this post, I'm quite interested in classic but haven't played too much on private servers.
---
Is there any chance you could explain to me a bit more about your FedEx and exploration route? I'd like to try it out as it really stands out as the method you're most endorsing.
---
I'll also do my own research but I'm just on lunch and wanted to make sure i don't let an opportunity to ask questions slip away. 
---
Warlocks, it's actually comical how bad locks counter mages in vanilla 
---
abandonware argument never held up because abandonware isn't a legal concept
---
Yeah thats pretty much. I'm going to give them a chance with this because I want classic servers. I played the demo at blizzcon and at home it was good. I want it to work.
---
But at the same time I wouldn't even be remotely surprised if blizzard already has a 12 step plan on how to slowly implement micro transactions and other BS over time. They are probably going to wait a 1-2 years at most and start chipping away once people are already invested in their characters and the server.
---
I hope they do it right but I do not have much trust/faith in blizzard anymore.
---
Podcasts are great as you can stay focused on what you’re doing in game at the same time. Countdown to Classic is my favourite.
---
First off, awesome post, even if it's a bit too deep in the theory crafting for my liking, I'd much prefer to see this in practice to get a feel on it, as would most people. Like you say in the end, 3 is the best for time and that's because it's where you gain the most party bonus XP per party member. 
---
I think the *best* goal, if all party members can in fact get into the server at the same time *and* be the first to leave the zone, is to farm level 3 mobs. They will be yellow, so no massive XP loss or glancing/hit reduction, and they are easy enough to farm. Grind lv 3 mobs till lv 3, then move on to level 5. If you know what you're doing, you should be able to get your loop in perfect cycle (will want to play in the Beta to see just what our respawn timers are like) so that you don't even have to worry about others tagging your mobs.
---
I'm really curious about each race's FedEx options; what are all the times for each? I'm debating Troll or Tauren, and I'm in the dark a bit when it comes options for Taurens en route to Xroads / Org. There should be one quest from starting zone -&gt; camp in Mulgore, then another possibly to Xroads, or even to Stonetalon? Then you can pick up the one on the bridge near Durator to go back to Xroads, but first go to Org and pick up the FedEx -&gt; Org before flying back to Xroads -&gt; hearth to mulgore? 
---
There's alot of people out there with this same mentality (myself included).  But its insane the number of people who just can't and won't ever be able to achieve this.  Someone will always stand off to the side of the stack, someone will always take a slightly different path, etc etc.  People never cease to amaze me in this world, and in Azeroth!
---
it’s not propulsion tech
---
have realms without tokens for players who actually want to work &amp; earn their flex
---
also have realms w/ tokens that pander to people who absolutely must have instant gratification/pay to win. 
---
literally everyone including activision wins. wow was ruined by entitled whining brats who spent more time bitching on forums than actually playing &amp; earning shit. this completely shuts down their nonsense, exile the sissies to their own realms. idiots. 
---
I miss wall-climbing so much. I really hope it's still in classic. 
---
Test
---
i think it will be sooner than that, 6 months tops. You’ll see all the TCG items will probably go to the shop first in my opinion. 
---
Opps nice catch there- I feel pretty stupid now lol; I wish I could edit it.
---
Hi, /u/facktality
---
Abandonware isn't a legal concept, just because Blizzard no longer sells or supports vanilla wow doesn't give anyone else the right to sell or support it.
---
Abandonware sort of holds up when the company that originaly produced the software no longer exists, and then not for any reason other than there is no one left with an interest in claiming the software.
---
Areas in the old world like this is pretty much the only changes I want to eventually see in Classic. Use already created assets to open up areas using 1.12 scaling. Add variety to gear sets and level gaps that hinder some classes more than others. 
---
No class mechanic changes required at all and increased the content to lengthen the fresh/old server cycle which Blizzard will realize is the largest player retention metric in this true 1.12 progression style Wow version. 
---
Could they ride the R11 skeletal horse?  
---
It's all about doing your job.  It's like looking at at a car and saying "omg I could never imagine designing and building that!".  Well, no one did the whole thing.  Everyone did a small part correctly, and when its done you have the whole thing.  It's pretty amazing the number of mechanics that you can potentially never even have to learn about if you just raid as one role.  More power to you if you know all the mechanics for every roll, but completely unnecessary when it comes to clearing raids.
---
I don't have a problem with them adding TBC or wotlk as stand alone servers so long as Classic servers remain, then people can just choose which version of the game they want to play. I'm not really interested in them fleshing out Classic though, adding in the unfinished content people keep going on about. I look at Classic WoW as a preservation of gaming history and it should be kept as close to the original as possible. Besides, do people actually trust modern day Blizzard to make new content faithful to vanilla? I don't.
---
 What is the route for your Alliance FedEx option?  
---
Is this in YouTube?
---
Link?

i have an of topic questions since its almost impossible to get a post thrue on this sub.
---
Are there any subreddits to this one for each class?
---
Would be nice with something simple like /classicwarrior
---
They're still way off. Most quests on private servers are giving 250 rep as a reward, where even your own source is showing 100 rep for a number of those quests, or not listing any rep at all (which is inaccurate for a number of entries)  
---
Krunk's question is still valid, vanilla rep numbers are way different than private server's

See you in stv you Ally twit

I'm actually fine with people buying gold from farmers over cash shop. Someone actually has to log on and farm for hours to make that gold, even bots. It takes time. Cash shop makes it out of thin air. Neither benefits the WoW economy, but cash shop makes it much worse. Plus some Chinese entrepreneurs will have a new market, so good for them.
---
Tbh you should see my face when the leader says to stack and I see someone standing a couple yards to the left or right.  
---
I can't help but think "is this one small task really that hard? IS IT REALLY THAT HARD?! *throws desk out the window*"  
---
I always enjoyed getting on top of stormwind gates. And another that I’m not proud of is when I had a twink Druid in the 29s you could glitch jump on the interior ramp up towards the roof of the alliance base to where you were only reachable by like a warrior charge. 
---
Not only that, but all the ToS/EULA we've ever accepted I'm fairly certain have contained a clause that we agree this game is subject to change. That would be a pretty solid argument in the case.  
---
The argument becomes philosophical.  
---
If you replace every part of your car, is it still the same car?  
---
Interesting situation for the courts. The person on the opposite side of Blizzard would run out of money before the case ends.  
---
Amazing PVP fights lived around it, some of the best ever captured on video.
---
This guy lawyers 
---
One of my favorite raids.
---
It's kinda funny though because it's clearly not built to scale. The inside of that place is MUCH bigger than it looks from the outside.
---
Jokes on you. I skip STV
---
&gt; Is there any chance you could explain to me a bit more about your FedEx and exploration route? I'd like to try it out 
---
Essentially just run and get exploration XP, and do quests that require nothing aside from "hey, go talk to this guy" cause competition at launch is cancer.
---
[google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_n2be6WJYnGxQUioBGd7JGYY7FtlU0ThwGcO8Mh69M/edit?usp=sharing) human tab is planned out to level 10 with minimal kills. Level 5 in an hour or less with 0 kills / competition, level 10 in about 3.5 --- gnome/dwarf and Nelf are under construction. Video of human level 1-5 portion [here](https://youtu.be/rscZrZ4JppY) - [gnome here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dmL1arCCDc) - though needs a little work to ensure level 5 before Darnassus (need an extra hundred or two xp).
---
Quality post. Could you elaborate on #2, exploration and fed ex? I haven't heard this but I haven't been looking into much 1-5 optimization, could you share a sample route?
---
Is there a link to a higher res version of that
---
ok bud
---
Right
---
[see / comment above](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/alu1bz/dumb_thursday_math_rushing_out_of_starting_zone/efh2cur/)
---
Sounds about right, I figure they don't want a bad precedent and it isn't worth gambling on it with classic in the works. It will be hard to say they don't offer the vanilla game when they have gone to great (And public) lengths to remake it.
---
I've been out of the game since Cata. Anyone have an idea of what loot trading does to  "/1. No one group with Soandso, he ninjad Hoj and didn't trade blahblahblah!!"
---
Naxx gear was as good as some Kara gear.
---
I would love to try it. Not sure if we will get wallclimbing back tho :s
---
The same thing happend to me under stormwind. 
---
And u could also get feared under stormwind if a warlock feared yöu in the water zone at the entrance
---
I remember reading this
---
Yeah, agreed. Apparently for some reason if there is no upgrade, you have no incentive to go. And since you cant make things stronger then naxx its 100% completely impossible to continue on or do it a bit different.
---
I am all for something long after naxx that might not upgrade your power much but still give some kind of upgrade/change. Might be a instance with a harder part for hardcore guilds that just wants to kill new stuff
---
Hahaha
---
How did that happen?
---
Probably because:
---
&gt; Purely selfish personal dps, not taking anything to specifically help others.
---
&gt; You need Nightfall.
---
Isn't answering the question.
---
Awesome! If you do end up making NE/Dwarf versions, please post the vids on the subreddit! This looks far preferable to grinding with a lot less headache for the first 5 levels.
---
So do i.. it was one of the funniest thing to do. Also very challenging
---
You don't want to play 16 hours a day every day for months, until that one other asshole on your server that Also grinds 16 hours a day every day gets so sick he has to go to the Dr. For an afternoon, which finally puts you far enough ahead of him to get rank 14?
---
I also liked getting on top of the gate. Sometimes when i was doing duals as a rogue i would stealth amd then "climb" up on the wall
---
Getting to the house above elwynn forest where alö the sheeps are were also something special. U could get there from different zones. Burning steppes.. elwynn... also from inside stormwind.
---
Wait Undeads are mostly human right? , considering the decay id think that they would  grow shorter not taller .  
---
Answered with the rest of my statement, check out Fury BiS. Which would be Unstoppable Force. 
---
Might try that once then :) DDO is really good as well for this kind of thing. Reaping dungeons etc.
---
I haven't seen anyone in favor of loot trading.
---
If you’re looking for an alternative, our current  warchief can sort you out. 
---
12 years of doing WSG, I’m nowhere near exalted.
---
How about they eliminate GM loot trading and just put a confirm box up after you click on a name in raid master loot? I remember GMs just telling you, you were SOL if someone ninjaed in a dungeon. 
---
i've been doing something like this! not really familiar with the average vanilla speed, but so far it's been pretty fast and chill for me
---
I winced as I read this. The pain was real.
---
Same with shamans and ghost wolf at 29/39
---
I was speaking more broadly about end game wow. I have played and loved every end game of every expansion bar BFA. I could absolutely hate it but I'm making an assumption I won't, which i'm pretty confident with.
---
No, I don’t remember. I was really young when I started playing classic and never made it past 20. Although I had been playing on and off since vanilla, I never got into the game and got a max level character till wrath because I was an altaholic.
---
Which is part of the reason I’d like to re-experience classic as an adult.
---
If only trolls would stand up with their shoulder straight 
---
So your telling me your going to enjoy the game instead of rushing through 200 hours of content just to bitch they didn't release enough content for fresh 60's. Meanwhile the rest of the Zerg reaches 60 post nax release..
---
Yea this conversation won't ever lead to a productive conclusion. Basically you have two groups of people: One who strongly believes against Tokens/Gold farmers and then those who want it in the game. 
---
My personal opinion?  As long as money is involved it's bound to happen whether it's through Blizzard officially or through a 3rd party seller. It really makes no difference what your opinion is on this matter. It's still going to happen. 
---
If you don't believe in tokens/china sellers stick to your guns and don't buy them in the future. That is all you can do. 
---
I think everybody remembers LEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOY JEEEEEEEENKINS.
---
Me and a guildy arms warrior farming in WPL. He was like “keep me alive and you will level in no time.” Trial by fire. He pulled mobs like a mad man. Got me ready for raid healing fast. 
---
My biggest draw is the flight paths and cross continent elements of the route for the 15-20 part of leveling.
---
By level 20 as a human while leveling, you'll likely "waste" 5 minutes ea running to Redridge, Sentinel Hill, Tramming to Ironforge, and then 15 to Menethil Harbor--- so this 1 hour run that ends in Menethil with all the above only really 'costs' 20-30 minutes, since once you want to go to Redridgea at 18, the 1 minute flight saves a LOT of time vs running there from Sentinel Hill.
---
As I see it, the GMs were fixing mistakes players made. That was pretty understandable back then, as it was many players’ first MMO. Now though, I think it’s probably better to avoid it entirely by making loot non-tradeable. 
---
yeah i agree. i miss when there was alot of mystery and magic and not EVERYTHING was part of a quest or scenario.
---
deadwind pass was a whole ass zone with no purpose other than it was a spooky cool place. sure its mentioned in quests and books and stuff, but theres no quests or anything there as far as i can remember in vanilla
---
Honestly people who use , " want to experience WoW as it was , low poly and all " should try low aspect ratio old CRT monitors and really bad PCs like most of them did, the fact that allmost all of us are going to be playing on atleast FullHD WideScreen Monitors already breaks the logic of " WoW as it was".  
---
Having said that, am all for using old client and low poly, just because it should be working smoothly across all computers and even low end laptops . Am all for more people enjoying their WoW in 60fps 1080P with High Settings.
---
Alongside this I HIGHLY suggest exploring places that yeild important Flight Paths later on in the game. For example if you're Horde Ratchet,  Camp Taurajo, Crossroads, and Zoram Strand + Splintertree Post. You'll be moving at a fast pace around the zone with Spirit Rez which ultimately ends up giving you more exp gained.
---
Alliance side is much better for lock raiding because of Salvation imo. On horde you are going to need to stop dps quite frequently, but things can vary greatly depending on your tanks gear/skill.
---
2005 I think? 
---
There as been some confusion about this point right here.  A bunch of people are saying that if you roll need with the current system that it is auto bound to you.
---
Also be on the look out of Eitrigg's quest from beta that made it into the game. He sends Horde players to the Valley of Trials on a Q from Thrall's throneroom.
---
I believe the quest is for everyone but Orcs.
---
Activision doesn't care. This is for saving money on their end. 
---
Classic WoW is happening because they think they can make a lot of money on it - not to give us what we want.
---
Visiting underneath Stormwind and falling into the roof of the Mage Tower was a fun experience. Visited Ironforge Airport too.
---
So much this. 
---
Also why I prefer "hard core" guilds. Not that I care about getting first anything or like grinding that much, but more people come with that attitude and the raids are so much less stressful and more fun because of that. 
---
Anyone care to share exploration routes for Horde, particularly Orc/Troll?
---
Yeah, IMO the new gear was really just a trophy/status symbol to say "Yeah, I we killed this boss" or "We cleared that raid."  Wearing something exclusive that no one else had.
---
That's an awesome idea. Instead of glitching maybe outfitting a squad of warlocks and rogues/druids with Invis pots and sneaking into the city undetected only to summon a raid or two right inside the city.
---
No idea sorry. Perhaps on google.
---
I've never seen someone get there from inside Stormwind. Care to elaborate?
---
I'm going to do every quest in the less popular zones like Alterac Mountains, Azshara, Dustwallow Marsh.
---
Hands-on with Battlefield 2. Ooooo
---
I personally think that they only offered this as a "solution" because they don't have an easy way code-wise to re-implement dungeon drops as it was in vanilla. So they made up a bullshit excuse that wasn't really a problem back during Vanilla to justify not changing it. 
---
I’ve been looking at this, and maybe it’s just me, but bags seem pretty “meh”. A lot of the vendors sell pretty good bags for quite cheap. How do you turn a profit?
---
First off you should've been banned and anyone who purchased gold should be banned.  
---
&gt; if Blizzard doesn't do it chinese gold sellers will and there will be no difference either way. 
---
Blizzard sanctioned gold selling is a hell of a lot worse than a shady 3rd party selling gold. There is a huge difference.  A lot more people will buy official gold from blizzard than a shady chinese 3rd party.  Blizzard needs to do their damndest to ban all gold sellers and buyers.  They can't just throw their hands in the air, saying "ah fuck it instead of fixing a huge issue with gold sellers in our game, we will just do it ourselves! That'll show those gold sellers!" If they do this it will be the end of classic wow.    
---
A streamer made a really good video on this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SBk8ijKJ6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SBk8ijKJ6M) 
---
I mean, heaven forbid there be consequences in a game. 
---
Be the change you want to see in the world!
---
The funny thing is is that I'm not really excited for Classic WoW, but what comes afterwards. We've done Vanilla already, and it will be great to be back, but a year or two down the line when everything is done I would love to see some content patches in the same vein as 2004-06 WoW.
---
abso-fucking-latley. probably more quest in darkshore than westfall and redridge combined. so many damn quest there. (maybe not as many combined, but there’s a shitload.)
---
I'm definitely planning to research this, I was wondering if anyone else had tried already and wanted to share their thoughts..?
---
The attack trigger is random.  The direction and location of the attack is fixed by her position in the room.   Ony has something between 5 and 8 fixed positions she hovers at during phase 2.  When she flies around she moving from floating position to floating position and won't deep breath while moving.  Once she's at one of those fixed positions she has a random chance of doing a deep breath that will hit the widest area possible from that fixed position. 
---
The solution to the attack is to be ready to run to the side of her current position to avoid it.  Some of her floating positions give more room than others to dodge DBs.
---
It's a global game, they shouldn't use such exclusive terms when marketing to a global audience. 
---
The fact that current content is bad notwithstanding.  Post WOTLK servers are "practically" nonexistent (but do exist) because people don't like that version as much.
---
I think the population will shrink, but they pservers will still exist.
---
I've seen a few exploration xp routes, but nothing with fetch quests added in :(
---
Horde's on my list of to-do, but not any time soon.
---
I want Verycoolguy to play Classic and make PvP videos.
---
No he does not. Attack speeds weren’t changed until 2.0 TBC prepatch. I will say though the demo had static 2.0 pet speeds so hopefully it’s something they know and didn’t fix pre demo.
---
This is my plan. Maining a mage, for gold reasons, then going to level all the other classes with rested xp. Leveling with rested xp and expendable gold makes things very fun. 
---
Ofc! There were 3 ways. I dont remember the third way at the moment but.
---
1. Under SW . After u fell down u should go towards the mountains where the "valley" water is. If u try jumping and climbing there u can get there. Involves alot of climbing and jumping.
---
2. Sw gate. U get up on the gate and then u can jump up on a little hill to the right of the gate.
---
And also later in cata before flying u could also get there. Wall climbing was removed but wall running was added instead.
---
Us Horde will find this map extremely useful &gt;:)
---
&gt;Yes true.. what I meant was that random people could come in at any time and disrupt it so it was impossible for you to do say, an organized 2v2 or 3v3 against another team.
---
We use to have guild tournaments which had the horde and the alliance working together.  People who tried to interfere got corpse camped by other teams waiting for their turn.
---
I was actually just about to link him your guide. Cool to see you're already on it! Thanks for writing a sick guide.
---
"What they are supposed to look like" imo maybe they were supposed to look like "cute disney goofy like characters" , i mean they are what they are due to their creators designing them and taking them into current direction . Most of you people talk like you guys created lore, designed characters and Blizzard stole the game away from you guys and changed things.   
---
The way i see it the key people who designed WoW remained same until TBC , Tom Chilton and Jeff Kaplan  stay around until  Lich King and Tom isnt listed as designer only after MoP . And i also feel like that the people who greenlit WoW Vanilla and encouraged the design and development still have great influence in the game to this day(not all but enough of em ) . So they do get to portray the races they created  anyway they see fit, maybe the Cows just got more tame as they fit into Horde and become a team player? , i mean they got Druid and Shaman classes , id reckon theyd be more intune with nature and not war-like savages like Orcs are ( and should be )
---
It's no more effort for you to copy the whole link instead of just part of it. Where as it's a lot more effort for someone to reconstruct the rest of the link (especially on mobile which of lot of reddit users are) from your partial one. 
---
Also lots of people are lazy and won't even bother if they can't just click a link, so if you want people to actually watch it posting the whole thing for 0 extra invested effort seems like a smart move and good practice in general. 
---
People's inability to stack tightly, even in some of the higher end guilds I've been in, is really mind-blowing.
---
You can go up over the mountains in Dun Morogh east of ironforge and skip 90% of the run to menethil harbour. If you're a human paladin and can bubble, you don't have to die jumping down off the other side either. 
---
You can be 4/5 tank as a holy/prot Paladin, the problem is that most encounters don't require any more than 2 tanks. So you'll be healing most of the time. Without taunt you can't tank most things in a raid, but you can off tank adds in fights that require it.
---
The amount of farming you have to do for basic raiding is not that bad in classic unless you're min/maxing or once you get to Naxx where a lot of things were required. Most people expect the main tank to min/max more than everyone else since in Classic raids it's such an important roll. You're one guy keeping 39 people alive most of the time.
---
Healing is very similar in classic as to live except there are spell ranks so you have more choices, but a slower pace.
---
Warriors are honestly great in PvP but very gear dependent. You suffer vs mages but a geared warrior can give anyone a fight.
---
In world pvp you'll be fine. Again you're mostly a healer but you can hold your own 1v1 attrition style. 
---
BGs Holy Paladins are great obviously, but that's due to healing. Most serious PvP paladins will be running an all hybrid spec since you don't get much that's useful late the the trees. I don't think you're going to be happy just queuing WSG and trying to carry the flag as a Paladin. Druids are just so much better at it, and Paladins are just so good at healing. Some people do enjoy full Ret in BGs but wearing people down by attrition as prot/holy doesn't sound fun or effective. 
---
The only time of hardcore server I want is one without the dishonor system and every player no matter the level can be ganked at any time.  Townraids would be huge on such a system.
---
wanna point out that even if it is misguided it's not from retail, before they introduced level scaling they mostly got rid of 10 level zones and reduced them down to 5 levels, so duskwood wouldn't be 20-30, it would be 20-25, western plaguelands 35-40 and eastern plaguelands 40-45, ect...
---
Getting on top of the Goldshire Inn, on nost some guy was hosting a competition and I won all three prizes by swapping characters.
---
Imo it was TOC when the new tier of gear made everything before it entirely redundant, before then you still had to gear through Naxx to do Ulduar, 5 man gear just wasn't good enough
---
But using the wetlands skip on the west side of Ironforge in this route, the death puts you right at Menethil. Easier and faster still.
---
it’s better to die. then you can just rez at menethil harbor graveyard
---
Thanks! Happy wanding.
---
I mean, if you are going to roll a mage anf aor farm, its ok
---
Dots have shitty spell dmg coefficients anyways, just build em tanky and outlast everyone while wasting their healers mana.
---
I remember a 19 druid twink with 2k+ hp unbuffed. But I think that may have been during wotlk with some leather working leg armors and such.
---
&gt;If you replace every part of your car one by one over time, is it still the same car?
---
Then take the old parts and build a new car out of that.  Is that the same car?
---
So what should I play first?
---
 I plan to level a mage (engineering at max/mining/herb while lvling) for farming, pvp
---
a priest (enchant at max/tailor/skining while lvling) for pve
---
And a Druid (alch and herb) for anything, collectibles (such as bloodsail rep), heal/flag carry pvp
---
Now my original plan was to do Priest, Mage, Druid 
---
 I plan to rush to 60 on my first toon and I want to be sure to get a main healer spot for a raiding guild which is why I planned on doing Priest fist. But Ive been debating if itd be better to get the farmer up there first so it can be easy for the rest (such as mount gold)
---
Really torn as I didnt get a chance to raid b4 TBC came out so I want to make sure I get in good with a guild.
---
Suggestions? 
---
I would rather have this than have Loot Trading be in at all.
---
Yeah once again you're revealing your complete fundamental misunderstanding of intellectual property laws and their intended function. Of all the legitimate defenses there could be for blizzard, "It's the same game because the name hasn't changed" is by far the most retarded one you could pick. Literally almost everything in the original game has been changed (or abandoned, if you will) for the current version. This includes almost the entire playable world itself (since cataclysm,) the models, the textures, the core game play mechanics like talents and abilities, class mechanics. I mean literally everything. There's more different about the games than there is in common. There are probably a dozen MMOs that are closer to vanilla WoW than modern wow is to vanilla wow. 
---
In any case, there's such a plethora of reasons why vanilla private servers are going to die (or be killed) after the release of classic, that blizzard's copyright claims aren't even the least of them and it's hardly worth arguing this point at all. But what's for absolutely certain is this: Blizzard hasn't taken "serious" action against private servers yet because the cases will be precedence setting in US courts. If they take it to court now, the abandon-ware issue is too big of a grey area to ignore, and if they wait until after the release of classic their case will be absolutely 100% iron-clad. Why chance it?
---
Or you play tauren, having the fatest ass on earth and don't fit through the window. Yes, that really was a problem.
---
Soulbound should mean SOULbound lol
---
Didnt think it would have beta
---
I think you mean good 
---
notice how he does that for the first few zones though. i’m sure he means going back and forth between the first 30 levels or so like you usually have to do, and not 10-20 in westfall, cause then 15-25 in redridge wouldn’t make sense. 
---
Like which ones? Everything seems to be in some part of EEU  
---
Replace some letters with numbers or your comment will get insta deleted

---
This is literally the only reason I want classic back. I still want new content added to classic once it runs through the patches, but that's new patch content, like they already did in classic, in line with the game, like a few more quests, opening up kharazan, finishing the emerald dream, adding hyjal, etc.
---
&gt; I'm going to buy gold regardless if it's from the chinese or from another player via the token  
---
Here's the thing: back in vanilla, I did buy gold on an alt account once.  I didn't regret it, either.  But, with this approach, there's:  
---
1)- The knowledge that you are breaking the intended gameplay loop.  As such, it feels like cheating, and most players aren't likely to engage in it that much.  
---
2)- The risk that you don't get the gold.  Most gold sellers these days (across all games) have competed for years to be sure that they are going to fulfill orders, but there's still much more risk than with a Blizzard token.  
---
3)- The possibility that you get actioned, while small, is real.  Certainly someone catches you or has reason to suspect you, they could report you, and you may be temporarily or permanently banned for supporting RMT.  
---
These combine to create a world where *it feels totally fine to spend time playing in game to generate gold fairly*.  Meanwhile, in retail WoW, your time spent earning the gold you simply *must* compare to the difficulty of purchasing that gold with cash- which could, depending on your position, simply make the entire action of legitimately farming in-game gold fairly a poor decision for you, personally.  
---
The game with the illicit RMT gold farming bots is generally better than one with the tokens, because the potential cost of breaking the rules creates a barrier that allows for economic activity to both exist and feel good.  It's the lesser of the two evils, because it leaves the game mostly intact for most players, most of the time.  By contrast, skipping gold grinding is cheap, fast, secure, and well supported by Blizzard in the current game, and the game is less as a result.
---
I actually thought this was Morrowind for a second.
---
My boy. I have zero intetest in classic. But if Blizz decides to make TBC Classic, I will be like that meme guy "Shut up and take my money"... For me TBC&gt;Classic. 
---
&gt;It's the same game because the name hasn't changed  
---
No. The argument is "Its the same product". You're quite a brainlet my friend.  
---
&gt;Literally almost everything in the original game has been changed (or abandoned, if you will) for the current version. This includes almost the entire playable world itself (since cataclysm,) the models, the textures, the core game play mechanics like talents and abilities, class mechanics. I mean literally everything  
---
You are arguing feelings now. Its irrelevant that they changed stuff. Its still the same product. Certain parts of the game being changed is nothing like abandoning a product.  
---
&gt;In any case, there's such a plethora of reasons why vanilla private servers are going to die (or be killed) after the release of classic  
---
They won't. Just like there were Legion servers during Legion, there will be Vanilla servers during classic. Some of the servers will probably be using the Classic version as opposed to Vanilla.  
---
Its piracy. Simple as that.

Stranglethorn Vietnam (Mid Quests + High 30s Safari) 37-38  
---
Stranglethorn Vietnam (South) 42ish-45ish but can provide good exp up to 50  
---
That's my plan anyway.  
---
It is insane to me people like you exist lol. I don't mean that as an insult. It takes all kinds to make the world. It's just crazy to me there is even one person in all of creation that enjoys wow fishing lol.
---
Thanks for the reply! :)
---
Thank you :)!

There's another issue here.  Assume everyone follows the rules but you're a paladin and there is another pally in the group.  Some good loot drops off of the first boss and you beat the other paladin for it.  Now you have to deal with the other guy pestering you throughout the dungeon to possibly trade/sell the item.  You can /ignore, but then you're cutting off communication for the rest of the run.

My guild heard the horrors of how hard Naxx was and were terrified the expansion was going to be a difficult grind at the start. Thus, we made our way through few bosses before TBC released. To our dismay, TBC was easy mode the first few levels. 
---
In a way, it was both Naxx and TBC coming out soon that caused us to "stick around." Though the game was still fun so it's also unlikely any of us would have stopped playing either. 
---
I used to do a lot of wallclimbing in between zones and found a lot of really messed up areas.
---
Between the mountains around Ungro/Tanaris and extending all over are huge areas that are unfinished.  Weird canyons and drop offs that are straight down, easy to fall and die, and perfectly flat.
---
Wasn't that bad. I got exalted in Vanilla and wasn't even a serious PVPer. Could win WSG fast as a druid however.
---
No res sickness prior to level 10. Dying is free fast traveling from levels 1 to 9.
---
I would even say Redrige is 3/4, and Westfall is 2/3. As I remember there being a gap where I would go to Redridge for a while, before going back to finish off the Defias stuff around Moonbrook. 
---
&gt;So it can be summed up that the most difficult part of forming a vanilla raid will be managing the people, much like herding cats.
---
Very true.  Also true, fewer cats = easier wins. I was part of a casual guild in Vanilla that splintered after we failed raiding in the MC over and over again after doing mass recruitment to get big enough to raid.  About 20 of us left to form our own guild and all the bosses we'd failed on with 40 people the old guild we beat easily with about 25 people in the raid.  
---
Thought I think that guilds that are built around raiding and loot tend to have toxic communities.  I had a much better time in casual guilds with strong leadership than I did in the hardcore raiding guilds I played in.

Whilst I agree that buying gold isn't ideal there will always be people willing to risk buying it, where there is a market then gold farmers will exploit that. Do you not think they tried to ban all the gold farmers? It's been over a decade and it only really slowed down when the tokens came into play, it's impossible.
---
Not only do i disagree about it being the end of classic WoW i believe it will help it, I've already written this but I don't mind doing it again; There's two choices, Blizzard don't release the token, you've won, the people who want to buy gold are an unexploited market and the Chinese gold sellers have bots gathering ore, herbs, skins and farming kills, they flood the AH and the value of gold and items plummets and damage is done to economy.
---
The other choice is blizzard release a Classic WoW Token, now the token isn't creating something out of nothing, effort has to go into grinding that gold by a legit player who then buys game time with the gold, a player pays blizzard for that gold. The gold isn't magically created, the effort and grind has gone into it by a single player no damage done to the economy, if the gold isn't made then it isn't sold.
---
As for me getting banned I was 15 and wanted a shiny mount, no need to be hostile.
---
Making loot non-tradable is a change, no matter how you cut it. 
---
What’s crazy to me is people asking for such a huge, game-changing removal of loot trading. 
---
Loot trading was 100% a part of Vanilla and everyone in this thread arguing otherwise is arguing in bad faith. 
---
I loved Karazhan, and although I understand the #nochanges camp, I'm hoping that it eventually makes it way into WoW Classic.
---
I only managed to raid MC, Onyxia, and ZG once in my entire WoW playtime, but got to raid Karazhan many times. Even though I've wiped countless times, and never got to down Prince Malchezaar, I just had such a blast – great setting and fun events such as the Opera and Chess. I'm sure you would have enjoyed it as well!

The biggest one still out there is in france
---
I still consider Age of Empires III to be new.
---
I hope you’re wrong man
---
DEEEEP. HAVE WE DISCOVERED CAR CLONING?
---
You can do a lot of damage sneaking a few Warlocks into places. 
---
What do you get from the timbermaw?
---
I played vanilla for it's entire duration. I lost plenty of loot and witnessed other people lose loot due to dumb mistakes. It sucked when it happened, but I never once thought that blizzard should step in and fix my mistakes. The idea was inconceivable back then. GM's existed to correct big problems like getting stuck, not to hold the hands of players.
---
Windfury alone distinguishes the Shaman. But I could go on and on how unique they are.. Besides, I'm not really buying the "pally in Naxx gear." Like you'd like to face a Shaman in Naxx gear?
---
Survivability vs. Windfury. One support role vs. Many dangerous roles as well as support. Defensive Cleanse vs. Offensive Purge. 
---
I think my Fly vs. Wasp analogy is still spot on.

&gt; Broken Tooth was once considered the ultimate hunter pet mostly for his capabilities in PvP combat. He was sought after for his 1.0 attack speed, which was the quickest in the game. However, since pet speed normalization in Patch 1.9.0 he has lost this ability and is no longer considered a pet to strive for.
---
[Could be wrong](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Broken_Tooth), but it’s what the Wiki is telling me.
---
can confirm!
---
It depends a lot on the US-Russian relationship.

back then you could just die and enter as a ghost, to have it as simple as possible. 
---
When doing PUGs or even just filling in spots in a raid, I'll do an *idiot test* which consists of a simple instruction like
---
&gt;"We have 5 spots open for AQ40. To get in the raid, just pass the idiot test! Whisper 'druid summoner' to me to get an invite.
---
More than half of people will fail the test. They'll whisper "invite" or "summon me" or will say in the public chat channel "invite me".
---
If they can't follow extremely basic instructions laid out in a single line of chat, they're not fit to join the raid.
---
2000-2005 were the golden years of video game culture.

RemindMe! 1 Year "Tell this dumbass you told him so."
---
This is why it's so important to not make changes to Classic to appease the wrong audience.
---
Let Classic be the classic WoW experience.

I’ve searched around but I can only find snapshots of parts of it that are legible. Shame.
---
Activision Blizzard already stated that wall jumping won't be in Classic.
---
However, tests done in the leaked client showed that it was possible to wall jump... so it's still up in the air.
---
Wall jumping is a big glitch, a bug and not a feature, so it's understandable they'd fix it.
---
Moonwalking, though... RIP.
