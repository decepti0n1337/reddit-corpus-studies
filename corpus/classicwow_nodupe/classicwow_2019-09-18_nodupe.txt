Got to reboot the servers because reasons.
---
With the door closed?
---
Nobody is getting mad for being called out; in fact chances are someone who spends their time ganking lowbies is actually looking for it. People are annoyed that the forums are filled with people crying about getting ganked.
---
Shame, if you cannot kill 42 mage as level 35-37. As an alliance player i am so used to fight red enemies to see it is clearly possible to fight them off (i even made some skull levels sweat and pop cds aganist me). Oh boy most pvp serverd are horde dominant and some horde players end up not knowing how to survive in unfavorable situations.
---
You can use macros. 
---

---
You can have shadow form change your action bar or have every macro do one thing normally or another in shadow form.
---
If my dungeon groups are anything to go by, people are vastly underestimating the number of teenagers playing. I feel dumb for thinking that classic would be a bunch of people in their late 20s to early 30s who played vanilla and would know what they were doing. Instead it's a bunch of people who've never played wow and chat is filled with teenagers calling people boomers/zoomers.
---
It's going to happen. Change is coming. Get your head around it, or play on a private server.
---
This

Keep in mind about half of your gear will probably be leather if you're optimising for PvE. You don't tank hits in PvE and there's generally better dps 'rogue' gear than hunter gear. Even fury warriors typically end up wearing a lot of leather at 60. So if you're just limiting yourself to mail gear that will be a fairly short list of things.
---
Any plans to add profession items such as enchants in the future?
---
Dude....cmon now. I barely have time to play wow but if I could afford to go to the beach I‚Äôd sure as hell be playing it too. GG
---
Anybody who voluntarily signs up for a free moderator position for something like reddit has a very sad, unfulfilling life.
---
What are you talking about?
---
I've killed players 6-7 levels above me
---
Alliance guards are clearly pussies. FOR THE HORDE
---
Okay! Waiting on your report!
---
Language!
---
It‚Äôs really not that bad as long as your at the right lvl.
---
Could someone explain this meme about ninjas that I keep seeing referenced? I can't ever make sense of it from context, it just seems like calling people "ninjas" is a meme for bad players or something now.
---
i still dont get it
---
Unlucky, run the same number of times, 3 time it dropped,1time was that hat.
---
Whitemane is actually one of the most balanced servers and one of the best servers to play Alliance lol. A bunch of the other ones are majority Horde
---
What unironically triggers me is when people out bid me by 1 copper.
---
Sorry but Druid armor doesn‚Äôt beat shield block. Shield block makes warriors almost immune to crushing blows. That‚Äôs why almost every guild uses a warrior as main tank. Druids can actually die from getting crushed. Cooldowns are great and all but the secret sauce is shield block.
---
Looks like your GCD (global coolldown) timer, not a swing timer. I could be wrong though.
---
Yep. You can keep yourself flagged all day long if you want (and some people do).
---
Same
---
Hahahaaa! I'm sure they get it, 'cause we all do it :)
---
Is prot not a viable tanking spec for paladins?
---
They can do dungeons but not raids or something?
---
I've been looking for one of these!
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Yes, two mages in a group will own the entire area, dipshit. But ya, they should be allowed to compeltely control questmobs, that's TOTALLY fair. Fuck you, you're exactly why I tag the mobs and let them kill them. Maybe if they weren't pricks like you, I wouldn't have to, you fucking tool =) PS: You're not owed the quest mobs either, neither are the mages, you whiny bitch.

Dude, what realm? I swear that I was the other blood DK!
---
I used to do that as a Drood in Moonglade, when the wittle lvl10 elf druids would teleport in the moment they appeared I'd use some cat form bleed on them (typically pounce), it wouldn't kill them especially if they healed themself but they'd run around all panicked. I think drood honor prohibits actually ganking lowbies in moonglade.
---
I'd also mess with lvl60 players who were dueling outside Stormwind by moonfire ganking them at low health then pissing off at high speed and dashing away and prowling before they could catch me - which I must say was a uniquely druidic form of griefing being the only class with powerful ranged attacks and stealth - they'd all have a merry wild druid hunt trying to unstealth me, then once the hornet nest had died down and they got back to dueling and dash had cooled down, I'd prowl back and moonfire gank another one. I can imagine that the only thing more annoying than being moonfire ganked was that they almost never managed to catch me. It was intensely dishonorable, but like, if they were dueling they obviously had nothing better to do anyway.
---
Do them turtles drop some good vendor shit or what?

Well that sucks! I hope blizzard fixes that post haste!

Transfers to a single brand new realm, and there have been posts here about how it's a ghost town for the people who took a transfer.  So players go from an overpopulated server to the absolute opposite extreme of an empty one.
---
Yep aka I‚Äôll be looking straight up randomly sometimes when I go to target a guy idk bit annoying.
---
You posted this a couple days ago my dude.
---
At 0:38 too. :D
---
The downside to that is also a classic-only issue in that more plate healing gear increases the chance of a big boss dropping enchanting materials for hordies.
---

So do you get really good fps by doing this or just like the aesthetic?
---
Did you just assume my demonic gender?!

TBH I've timed it and it takes a similar amount of time to get from Darkshire to rebel camp as it does from Sentinel Hill

Still get destroyed in hillsbrad, but I wouldn‚Äôt want to get destroyed on any other realm
---
Neither is blindly following these morons :/
---
I already made reference to 'back in the day'; you have no 'news' for me at all.
---
I only powershift on bosses or priority targets in 5 mans. It's honestly just too much work and I can't be assed 90ÔºÖ of the time. The best part of cat is getting a free hurricane where you can stand there AFK for 10s doing 500 AOE dps
---
Nah, i think both are in the wrong - it's a bad move to ruin the economy (especially when it's so new on Classic) by undercutting with ridiculous amounts because "i want to get rid of the stuff fast" - if someone needs it, they will buy it whether it's cheap or at the usual price. But it's also a bad move to whisper that person and start making fun and shit, that won't help anyone. I've done that too on retail a couple of times, and it only made those persons more determined to undercut, so that was fun.
---
I got on the futabus once. There was nowhere to sit.
---
LOL @ telling someone who complains about LFR to care about item level. LFR and item level are a part of the same group of additions that made people want Classic to begin with.
---
Tyvm (:
---
I think they should have faction specified loot tables in that case which ensures only horde raids get shaman gear and alliance only get paladin gear drop chances.
---
one in a million. pretty cool!
---
Got it first run.
---
Did you mean to reply to me?
---
You should make it so that I can tie a reminder to a zone. So for example I can tell it to remind me to buy water when I get to undercity.
---
r/IHaveSex
---
Considering that its a game of ones and zeroes, the only way you¬¥re pulling aggro with just 1 auto is by shooting it before the tank can melee the target once.
---
And you think that you¬¥re being slick with that multishot-feign trick but Im willing to bet most of the time it doesnt go like you think it does.
---
Either way, whatever. Be a nuisance to your groups and have no-one want to tank for you.
---
Rouge is French for red. 
---
&lt;B&gt;Rogue&lt;/B&gt; is the character class.
---
Imagine running a bot while you slept or worked so you could get past the shittiest parts of the game.
---
Also, what the hell, man? Do you seriously think he just sat there in his computer chair watching the bot run?????
---
This. I came here as a retail only player because I just discovered classic two days ago and fell in love with Old Orgrimmar and a lot of other aspects. 
---
But I still like retail, and I was kinda hoping not to find yet another random circlejerk about in in the third thread I clicked into in the sub. Sigh.
---
Solo! ;)
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind it so much if my bars didn‚Äôt swap between changing stances. It forces me to either put certain buttons in certain places or suffer having the weirdest looking keybind placement. Like this is the epitome of a warrior specific problem and it‚Äôs really annoying. Why can‚Äôt I just play my class with access to all of my class without jumping 1000 hoops.  It‚Äôs bad enough I gotta accumulate all these different weapons.
---
Not trying to complain but like, damn this. lol
---
Oh man I wish I could help you. Did you try using twitch or added the addon manually?
---
as soon as you log in turn on all the optional action bars, turn on auto loot, instant quest text, bind your auto-run key to something convenient
---
Anyone hear of free server transfers coming back again? Missed the window for my server.
---
no its not wrong. thats what i said and thats what i meant to say
---
That aspect ratio. Are you playing on a classic monitor too? üëç
---
You "don't fully understand" why people dislike griefers who camp the end of escort quests for 5+ hours?
---
C'mon dude
---
I read this in Peter Griffin's voice, so unlike everyone else who downvoted you, I upvoted you in appreciation of the laugh.
---
So there's no addon for this? Is there an addon which makes the chat or the combat log any better and less intrusive?
---
To be fair if you can manage to not get your shit mixed by the mob you're kiting and not pull anything else, go for it.
---
&gt; Don't want stealth alerts, constant pinging of every ally near enough to be in my combat log
---
 /spy config has a bunch of different options. You can turn off chat announcements, turn off audio alerts, turn off stealth, only have audio alerts for KOS, warn for KOS, warn for KOS guild.  
---
There's a ton of customization, but Vanos or your sticky notes might just fit you better. I just don't want people to get the wrong impression of Spy, I've been using it since wotlk and I can't imagine playing without it anymore.
---
It is sane regardless of what you think the motivations are .. you are one of the few that made the sane choice. I don't get why more players that don't like wpvp don't go pve.

---
&gt; spell power doesn't become good until you can stack a lot of it, which is typically only on pre-raid BIS/tier gear (at least from what i've researched).
---
As an SPriest you can stack like TEN METRIC TONS of spellpower if you craft or buy shadoweave items around lvls 35-40.
---
It looks like it was fine going in circles the once it hits winterspring, it's like "I guess it's time to land this puppy" (hints the straight line to the destination.)

Might not be the best way but just spamming dungeons is good and you will all make a little money and it should be easy with a few people who are over leveled.

Played on a private server earlier this year where a 60 horde rogue killed Stoutmantle 9 hours straight.

Mob tag. Have him out of group and tag mobs, friends zerg the mob...he'll get full xp if not most of it.

Oh, not at all. Most bank alts get nowhere near level 6. Also, take into account there are similar numbers of people of the opposite faction doing the same thing. While census data is by no means exact, it's a very useful tool.

Hahaha my one friend literally missed it by 4 minutes.

you can also try and /join lfg or lookingforgroup. Those seem to be fairly well populated (at least on my server) and *should* be global if I'm not mistaken.
---
Disagree completely, everyones knew mages were the gods of AoE farming and hunters are gods of never having to rest (and can kill anything whereas mage struggles against ranged mobs) but no one really considered that 50% of dungeon groups would be 3-4 mages.
---
update through battle.net
---
Sounds like your game isn't up to date.
---
Ditto, what I mean is like, and this is just an idea that in my head sounded awesome, ok say it‚Äôs expansion time,  you give classes an entire new skill tree. It‚Äôd probably be so incredibly difficult to do it and make it balanced well I dunno. But like a paladin tree that turn him almost into a cleric, just crazy buffs and shit. Or it just adds certain things to buffs, or like rogues getting some sword specific skills through a tree, maybe a tree you can have for weapons. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying change what we have I love how it is, and I‚Äôm not even sure it‚Äôs a good idea but it‚Äôs one I had and seemed cool, adding another skill tree to each class. Thanks for not downright flaming me .
---
I think the level req for getting max crafting is 35 right?  Then you'll be able to max it out on two professions.  You could have it tailor/alchemist(also you have a 1v1 disenchanter, right?).
---
Ya i know, but i actually WANTED to switch because i was gone a few days and learned my friends switched.. pretty bummed right now
---
When did it end?
---
Wow, you are amazing you know that?
---
Not only do you think warriors should be restricted to class identity you firmly believe that somehow filling out the 3 specs to actually enhance each aspect is somehow watering them down. 
---
I would love to live in your fantasy world however I am not an idiot.
---
Many parts of the dungeon is actually easier with 4 mages/3mages 1 warlock than with a "normal" comp.
---
source; the healer priest in both scenarios
---
Yes, 24h ago and still no answer
---
Good to know - and any weapon swap resets swing timers (thats one im familiar with)
---
I was very happy to find that it worked. First time I used it was 4 days ago. Real cool!
---
Everyone is triggered because he's playing at the beach but I'm triggered by how dirty his screen is
---
I don't mind too much getting ganked by a higher level ally, but I do mind getting camped by those higher levels for an unreasonable amount of time.  
---
A lot of those people are not complaining about pvp, but about assholes. I'm angry for a minute if I get killed once or twice by someone and that's okay and if you play on a pvp server you either need to not get angry or get over it.  
---
It's just like killing civilians or women/children in a war on purpose and even specifically targetting them. Sure it's war, but you're still an asshole for doing it.
---
no we don't
---
Thorium Point in Searing Gorge, or in Kargath.
---
Nope
---
&gt; People, en masse, refer to hardcore and casual as difficulty levels.
---
I don't think that's quite right.  Casual vs hardcore refers to dedication required to play the game.  
---
It might be counter-intuitive that Classic is more casual friendly, but since Classic actually supports gameplay at the lower levels, it's better for casuals.  You don't have to get to max level to start playing the game.  You can play it at the lower levels too.
---
This is fucking incredible. The little middle finger is just the perfect finishing touch.
---

True, and we wouldn't mind running SM.
---
I remember kiting it to the keep so the guards would take aggro
---
I'm sitting here at 6.6k Queue on Faerlina at 98 minutes queue....
---
Literally, as I get off work and queue to only be able to play 2 hours a night when I'm able to get on around 9PM... Queued at 6PM btw.... :(
---
3 hour queues everyday for the last month sucks LOL!
---
I tried to transfer off, but the only choice is a heartseeker server. I want to transfer to Rattlegore with co-workers and get off this dumb 3 hour queue one :( QQQQQQQQ
---
&gt;OK, I get it, we don't want people changing spec every five minutes but if you're a healer, good luck trying to do anything in the open world in healer spec.
---
I think a better solution would be to increase healer damage enough to solo in the open world.  Healing power may need to be reduced somewhat to compensate, but part of Classic's magic is that priests can heal dungeons in Shadow spec and warriors can tank in Arms.  Classic specializations are actual specializations, whereas in Modern WoW they're just restrictions.
---
You will have to use bow or gun for your ranger weapon.
---
I feel you, to start over leave them behind. ummm no! been through too much together already.
---
Yeah it took me a while to switch when the game first came out.  I was worried it would make me a 'carebear'. In reality it let me enjoy a brilliant game.
---
Wow is *not* a good platform for unlimited pvp imo.
---
This guy is a Durid.  Alamo would be proud.
---
Why do people that use exploits tell everyone and his grandma that it exist? wouldn't it be more likely to be undiscovered if they didn't tell anyone? why do they feel the need to brag about their exploit until it gets removed?
---
The exploit would still be there if they kept to themselves.
---
The Todd appreciates hot, regardless of gender or species.
---
Preparation is part of winning - it‚Äôs probably the most important part.   
---
Ganking is also solved with preparation but people would rather put themselves in vulnerable situations and then complain about it. If you get camped for an hour - you‚Äôre not a very good mouse
---
Oooooooooh so you're a GIRL void Walker! I mean of course you're a girl voidwalker I mean you're just REAKING of feminine beauty!
---
There's a kind of irony in how low effort this insult is as a response to mods overmoderating "low effort posts."
---
Or maybe it's meta. If so, well done.
---
What I would suggest is to add more layers to overpopulated servers and scale them down as the population allows to maintain sane queue times, as opposed to 2 1/2 hour ones nearly a month after launch.
---
People think you have to be a dedicated tank spec even in like dead mines.  At level 18 theres not much difference between any of the trees.
---
You must be a retail player with that mentality. It's not hard to pull aggro off a tank as pretty much any DPS class especially if you attack on the pull and you just end up pissing the tank off. Doing good DPS and not pulling aggro is the sign of a good player, not pulling aggro. There's a reason people use **threat** meters.
---
Druids, shadow priests, and locks counter mages.
---
That wouldn't save him.
---
PvE servers still flag you when you enter an enemy city since they're still considered Alliance/Horde territory (where-as contested zones and starter zones are turned neutral.)
---
Lol I am red-green colorblind however in this case I think it may just be my shitty phone screen.
---
But yeah the formula checks out so GG. Did you try turning it off and on again?
---
Do you know of any good areas? Or just anywhere that's around lvl 35?
---
make a mage n go ahead and compare. mage is far worse. only up side is they can make their own water but ull be spamming that shit
---
Doubt it‚Äôs 50%. I‚Äôve killed at least 10 of these just passing by and never saw a single one.
---
I think they should add more immersive fast travel options. Larger zones could have stables that you can pay to take you between two or more fixed points. Hills and mountains could have zip wires and gliders that take you down. Rivers and oceans could have smaller boats and rafts that take you around the edge of a zone.
---
Imagine gliding from ironforge gates down to Kharanos, taking a canoe from westfall to lakeshire, or hitching a ride from goldshire to Eastvale Logging camp.
---
Since most player interaction is done at the towns or during the quests themselves, I see no problem adding more fast travel options to cut down the amount of time autowalking from quest hub A to quest hub B.
---
IRL shadowform would be fun.
---
F
---
Can anyone recommend a good Threat Meter?
---
Rofl, loving this "BBUT TECHNICHALLY" grammar naziing. I'll say "figurative speech" next time and "literally" also means exaggerated in contemporary culture as much as you might disagree, chill out :)
---
ehem. frost aoe mages you mean. i'm a proud fire/elementalist mage and i would love to get invited to a normal pull-3, sheep-that kind of run but i only get whispers and invites for farming
---
Yeah, I had a post deleted as "low effort" despite it having over 200 upvotes at the time. Meanwhile on the front page if you post a similar meme with a WoW element badly MS painted in, you're golden.
---
Whatever.
---
I repeat. Why are you not building your Titles with Proper Capitalization Sir, Shame on you.
---
It is. So yeah if op was referring specifically to alternate tier sets that makes sense. I was more referring to just single pieces of loot
---
I see far more people getting extremely upset and aggressive over being called out for being dicks than anything else. 
---
Nobody likes to be ganked. It's annoying. But oh man the aggressiveness you see from people who defend it leads me to think that quite a few people know just how shitty they're being to their fellow gamers and don't like to face the fact they are in fact ruining others fun.
---
It's interesting to me as it shows that a lot of people justify their actions in game against people they can't see and who can't (easily) respond. It's easy to pretend that the pixels in game aren't connected to other people. Yet when the real people emerge and call them out they get really upset when not everyone agrees with how they play.
---
End of the day, I like the rules of PvP servers and I'm fully in support of people playing however they like.. but I also think a few people need to own their actions and accept that *they are being a fucking asshole*. Which is fine, the rules say you can do that! But don't deny that it's what you're doing.
---
This looks exactly the same as a post a few days ago, it's this a specific route or something
---
I don‚Äôt start shit but I‚Äôll sure as hell finish it.
---
I know that usage but it doesn't really fit in the context used in the post? Or maybe I'm just reading it wrong.
---
I use MSBT (miks scrolling battle text) and switch everything off except for healing,  you can move the text around and play with the font until you find what your happy with! 
---
I am very happy with it, but I did take me a little to get it to look how I wanted it to.
---
You can also shift the shields name into the macro so you don‚Äôt have to keep it in one slot
---
My buddies all switched while i was out of town. Im not really sure how to proceed at this point
---
Oh shit good point! Duh
---
I want to play on an RP server, but I am not keen on super long queue times. I play mostly Alliance. Can anyone recommend a server?
---
Calling something irony doesn't make it irony.
---
Well friend, i just wanted to let you know that in classic your main purpose isn't always to tank instances. Sometimes it's to dumpster the damage meters and just be the best PVE dps class. There's a reason that 40 man raids will sometimes have 10+ warriors, and it's not because they need 10 tanks. It's because their dps is amazing. 
---
Warriors regularly wear leather and mail gear. In fact, your pre-raid BIS dps shoulders are leather, the chest is mail or leather, the gloves are leather, the legs are leather, and the boots are mail. Most of the gear you end up wearing before raids ISN'T plate at all. Hell, even through MC and Ony (the rest of phase 1), the BIS gear is half leather and mail.
---
So I'm sure you can understand why a group leader that wants the mail gear from SM would be hesitant to bring another potential mail wearer. Regardless of you getting plate at 40, the best possible gear you can wear now and even after 40 for awhile is the mail gear from SM. They'd have no reason to think that you wouldn't want it unless you already had all of it, and as shitty as it is, for some people it's not worth the risk of bringing a potential loot competitor.
---
I'd say it's fair that a locked chest belong to the one who can open it
---
She'll get less xp but should be fairly balanced out by the fact a high level can plough through instance quicker. You won't get any exp though. If she has the quests it's probably worth it.
---
It is though. If you don't like it (and why would you?), roll on pve. Much better experience.
---
Way back in the day I would just cast fear on them if they were the opposite faction. Then it was up to fate if they lived or died.
---
At higher levels theres quite a bit of stam and defense gear.
---
Same. I tried a spellcleave group once then respecced into ST frost.
---
Sorry i never got notified you replied! I cant tell tbh , bcos when it happens my youtube still plays and doesnt crash same with twitch etc, i dont play other games so cant say much on that but it feels like my internet cuts off for a split second, not causing any issues with usual internet activities but with WoW it loses connected to battlenet and causes the disconnects , just got no idea how to solve it

Mages are OP in many ways so they draw a lot of tryhards. Just wait until later when more raid gear is available and the Locks start getting good.

This (well but I'm a cow)

Druid is the only class I can stand grinding with because there's just 0 downtime. You get a good rhythem going and then suddenly you're walking back with 10g worth of vender trash and leather (and I'm only in the low 30's)

No fear CD, no Silence? that is pvp god to you?

There is an addon that shows RealID next to char names.

I don't disagree, but I mean really what did you think was going to happen? People had been warning everyone about this the second classic got announced. Part of the magic of classic was how terrible everyone was. The games 14 years old. It's figured out. People know what's best, and that's what they're going to want to run. It fucking sucks for people who don't want to do a boring dungeon AOE grind fest for 7 straight days, but that's the way it's always going to be when people get a little knowledge.

Yes, multiple times :/

Why are you lying? We saw you die in on top of a SW vendor cart.

Dang dude the thousands of mobs you'll be killing ~20% slower probably won't make up the 1g to be honest, but to each their own

Yh ikr holy shit hahahaha.

Salty fuckers.

That's just spite, which isn't an asshole move
---
Not really, at least my phone won‚Äôt os lag like a dead hooker in a freezer after 2 years. So I‚Äôm perfectly happy with my choice.
---
Honestly the other reason is because the people being complete dicks about it are the ones who powered to 60 and didn't have to deal with it at all. If you got to level 20 within a day of launch and kept up that pace you had basically entire zones to yourself.. if you played with a couple friends you were basically gods. Now those people, having enjoyed a gank free levelling experience on a PvP server, are going back to low level areas and making life hell for those who didn't have as much time to do what they did.

Even though theres a /looking for group trade chat seems to be the most effective. I'll post for like 15 minutes on lfg and get nothing but trade chat and get 4 or 5 whispers immediately. If  LFG was a default channel I think It'd be more effective

He doesn't want any rules, well...except that one rule where no one over his level can gank him. No rules on a pvp server, gank anyone you want, been that way forever.

I honestly believe they were just giving some bullshit excuse so their friend could join.  It‚Äôs not the DPS, 4 people can‚Äôt be that fucking pretentious at the same time as long as mobs and bosses are dropping, but lying to get a friend in?  Yeah I believe that.  Sorry you went through that, but I‚Äôm confident it had nothing to do with your DPS and everything to do with their inability to admit it was their fault not yours.  Honestly I would prefer to hear the truth that I‚Äôm getting kicked ‚Äúbc fuck you we want our friend to get the loot‚Äù than some shitty targeted  though.  I believe that those people were just looking for any stupid reason to kick you, and you did nothing wrong.
---
So you're complaint is that after releasing a game that everyone agrees was made special because of the community, it's blizzards fault for expecting the community to work with them and bring back that magic.

Bwahahaha, pussies. I'd love to see you scrub fucks playing Eve. First jump into lowsec and you'd quit the game.
---
Not being able to see or interact with everyone who is currently online. It spreads the social interactions across several layers. Messes with the "MMO" part of the MMORPG by fragmenting the server.
---
Also, there has to be a breaking point on how many layers a server can handle and remain stable. If they could just add/ remove layers at will, and people couldn't exploit it, then why not just have 1 of each server type per region? It's 2019, but technical limitations still exist.
---
/shrug I had an LFR group wipe within seconds because the tank didn't know the mechanics prevented being healed unless you did X. The current last boss of the easy difficulty has 7 things listed in the "Dummies" list of dps mechanics and failing them will hard wipe the raid. The healer's can carry a lot, but as someone who raided everything Pre AQ40 back in vanilla the current LFR is harder. I had to watch videos of boss fights to get mechanics down beforehand so I wouldn't wipe the raid. Even after months of Vanilla raiding I couldn't tell you the layout of them or what bosses looked like because I all but /follow healed the tanks.
---
But no, let's pretend that even MC is a masterpiece of difficulty instead of a joke. It's 10x easier than retail LFR of today.
---
The legs just don't get summoned, they're still walking around the void

It would seem we play two entirely different games, then. Good luck to you out there!

Res or corpse run?

undoubtedly the most immersion breaking feature of the game
---
Damn hackers always hacking into blizzard's servers to see what server you're playing on
---
I play on a PvE server, but I'm flagged about half the time.  And as a warrior, that means I'm really asking for it because anyone that's played Vanilla before knows I'm just food.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What frustrates me is that (rightfully so) people can gank on PvP servers but Blizz is so facist about player names.  I've seen some people with pretty funny names that had to change them because other people have no sense of humor.  Names like Pantyraider or Protstitute aren't actually hurting anyone, but god forbid anyone ever see anything that \*might\* potentially offend them.

But wait there's more! Put your tinfoil on for this one, but what if the rogue just keeps one of each lockbox in their inventory with crap loot, and if one drops that's good, keeps that one? 'I don't know how to lockpick in trade, just send it to me'
---
Most people don't itemize so that really doesn't mean much
---
Dis you trouble shoot this yet? You know what you need to replace? Do the figuring now if possible. The game should run on old hardware, maybe you can grab a cheap part to get back to grinding while you save up for the replacement or upgrade.
---
Unfortunately the only thottbot capture I can find of magic dust was in 2013 ( [http://web.archive.org/web/20130319130453/http://thottbot.com/item=2091](http://web.archive.org/web/20130319130453/http://thottbot.com/item=2091) ) but it has the drop rate listed as 29%. Unfortuately 2013 is a little far away though. Im looking to see if there are any other archives of thottbott or anything
---
It was already reopened once and I imagine will be again, the full are still too full and the new are only on the low end of ‚Äúmedium‚Äù
---
I love your enthousiam ! What server are you playing on? Maybe I could hook you up with some gear, help and bags
---
Did you just gender assume?
---
Yo those turtles drop a 9s vendor gray item almost every time.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it! It‚Äôs not a game breaking thing, and it‚Äôs a choice I made to be sure. Just gets frustrating from time to time! I‚Äôm still enjoying the hell out of it, find the overall grind and pace to be weirdly relaxing and enjoyable!
---
On the other hand if you're just talking about which class is seen out and about the least, on most servers it's Druid.
---
Your AOE farming just ruins questing for the rest of us non mages. So both of you can F off.
---
I am merely describing what happened. 
---
When you take a class concept and you divide it up more specifically between the specs, the class identity as a whole is diluted. For example taking Fire Blast away from all mages made mages less about wielding a combination of the elements and arcane power, and more about just whichever type you were. So what it meant to be a mage was no longer "guy with a diverse toolbox of abilities including fiery blasts, icy winds, and bending the arcane itself" and instead became "either red guy, blue guy, or purple guy." Each of those specs became more heavily identified, but the class's identity as a whole became split and fractured...or diluted. 
---
I genuinely don't know why you're getting so upset
---
my friend just went to stv for the first time. he died 3 times before he could pick up any quest at nessingwary and a dozen horde were camping the quest giver.
---
last night there were multiple level 60 horde groups camping brd last night and the only way to get into the instance was  to die over and over while moving 30 feet at a time.
---
&gt;arena points
---
What are those?
---
Pretty sure it's bre-bis so yeah, nice find dude
---
They will definitely back in some form. Expect an announcement in the next couple of days about Blizzard's plans.
---
Do I need to speak in elvish to be in an rppvp server?  Like, how seriously is that taken?
---
To be honest though a lot of the Vanilla gear looks petty bad or sub par, and when leveling is when I feel it‚Äôs the worst, maybe you get a cool sword or axe here or there, but most of the time that you look like a basic bitch with stuff that actually color matches at best. At end game it‚Äôs a different story and yeah here or there there‚Äôs cool looking stuff. But they‚Äôre kinda few and far between until end game/higher levels...
---
Yeah; there are a lot of rumors from their VeCo stint.
---
Dang. Which one of these supported your memories?
---
The rate of decay is 5g per month to a minimum of 10g
---
Absolutely. I had so many alts in the early 40's. You've got your mount, things start to drag out, you remember how much effort getting to 60 from there takes annnd you drop off.
---
For me the only characters I get to 60 are the ones with a mob killing rotation I can tune out and relax with while watching TV or whatever.
---
&gt;Maybe we are assholes, but ruining their questing experience is very fun.
---
"Maybe".
---
i play mage but really hate the stupid "AOE Build farming"

Only flat damage reduction would. Percentage mitigation would just lower it by that percentage like everything else.

Something crazy is happening to his sleeve in first panel when I scroll on my phone.

Lesser known drop location for this recipe. You can check the comments on the item in WoWhead. The comments from back then talk about this frequently. It can drop from UBRS.

You said you were willing to pay money..

Just invest some more of that temporal currency in rerolling.

I think you may have multiple versions of Questie loaded. This happened to me. Not quite that many times though. Check addons list.

I thought one of the earlier times they did this you could buy blades that were used to host specific servers?
---
What beach? Looks just like the beaches in Aruba. I'm very jealous.
---
Corrupted Ashbringer was towards the end.
---
This gives me an idea, You should make it have multiple nameable pages/tabs. Maybe I want a short term to do list, a long term to do list, and a hit list. 
---
Awesome simple add on though, totes gonna download it either way.
---
We thought we did. But we didn't.
---
Looks pretty solid for group stuff but I think you will struggle solo.
---
Just had an idea, if Hunter Aspects are considered stances/forms you could achieve that. I don't remember if they are and won't be on for a few hours to confirm. But if so, something like this line would only cast if the stance with ID=x wasn't active. 
---
`/cast [nostance:x] Aspect of the Cheetah`
---
Be ashamed
---
Is it working in all AH's yet or just the cross faction ones still?
---
He's definitely lying. He's saying the entire point of a cleave (melee or caster) is to trick tanks into thinking their groups are different. Obviously looking at his comments he's a nutjob, but yeah he's definitely a liar/idiot regarding the situation. Caster cleave groups don't need anything resembling a tank, and cleave groups work perfectly fine without warriors (5 shamans works well), it's just warriors have the best aoe at that level for melee. He went on weird tangents about definitions for tanks too. He could have just said the discussion was mostly about how it wasn't great for gold generation but instead he went full neckbeard psycho and ranted/blocked rofl.
---
I did a quest with a female the other day that I found random thru inviting. I walked her back thru stv so she wouldn‚Äôt get handled then when I parted she said ‚Äúoff to play with the bf thanks!‚Äù Internet blue balls I tell ya
---
Threat isn't really an issue though.  At level 20 it was tough, but I'm 43 now and it really isn't very difficult to hold threat on 5+ mobs.  Prot spec gives me +10 defense, +10% armor from equipment, +5% block chance without shield block and 100% block with it for a couple hits, a 5sec stun, and 45% chance at a 3 sec stun every 5 seconds.  The stuns alone make the damage intake much less in a 1 on 1 fight (and most bosses can be stunned).  On multi mob the defense, armor, parry, and block chance makes a huge difference.
---
The dedication.

This is the internet; where the women are men, the men are 13 year old boys and the teenagers are FBI agents.

Well yeah it would be for end game raiding / dungeons. Since there is no dual spec I dont really have a choice right? I wouldnt waste points in shadow if I want top heals.

My thoughts too, was surprised to see they closed xfers already even though heartseeker &amp; earthfury is still medium at peak and other servers are still thousands queue but imagine they‚Äôre monitoring over a week or so

Open a ticket and ask a GM if there is anyway you could still get a transfer. Let them know you were out if town and all your buddies switched over

The Trolling Stones on Thalnos US Horde. I want to make sure you don't join it too.

Yup, I‚Äôve had a couple of enemies at my level or a few levels lower kill me when I‚Äôm struggling with a large pull. I‚Äôll instantly flag them as kill on sight and damn does it feel good nonstop killing them a few times in a row when I inevitably see them questing in the same zone

I guess a better question might be, does anyone know anyone who was an abuser who is no longer logging on?

Pretty slick, I like this. Can you post the add on list (assuming there‚Äôs more here than just ElvUI)?

FIREMAW, GEHENNAS, GOLEMAGG, MOGRAINE, RAZORGORE, SHAZZRAH
---
These six English-language PvP servers, including new ones created after launch, are currently reading as Full. We recommend you avoid them. Hydramist and moO\_UK are streaming on Golemagg; and Preach, Musclebrah, and Nobbel are streaming on Shazzrah, so both servers see extreme streamer crowds.  
---
ASHBRINGER, DREADMIST, FLAMELASH, GANDLING, NOGGENFOGGER, STONESPINE
---
These six English-language PvP servers are reading as High population, meaning there are queues, but ones that will set you back minutes or hours, not all day. They are blessedly streamer-free.  
---
SKULLFLAME AND TEN STORMS
---
These two English-language PvP servers were created after Blizzard saw the incredible initial demand. They are currently at Medium population, which feels very playable right now, but might empty out a bit later.  
---
BLOODFANG AND JUDGEMENT
---
These two English-language PvP servers are brand-new, so their populations read as Low. While this is a risk ‚Äì if server populations here don‚Äôt grow substantially, they could be lonely later ‚Äì you‚Äôre almost guaranteed to never have a queue to get in.
---
Aren‚Äôt the gloves those mail ones with +weapon skill?
---
severe queues as in, the same severe queues we have now.
---
Shimmering flats or Desolace?
---
Actually it is on our realm. The leveling process took longer than on other servers for most people and 3 weeks after release there was barely any level 60 on the server. There were less than 10.
---
US has also less guilds that killed Ragnaros than EU. It seems to be 58 EU guilds for 36 US guilds. I think the pug community is more installed in the US than in the EU.

Yeah and all druids/schamys and whatever wants my cloth items apparently.

Warlock - Soulstone, ultimate cheat death.
---
A main issue here is that Moonkin to be viable need their Innervate, but most raid groups will prioritize that to someone else (god forbid your raid leader is a mage, you know where it‚Äôs going).   Raiding as Moonkin was rare, I got to late vanilla through WotLK.     
---
Problem is that raiid mentality doesn‚Äôt often encompass switch hitting.  A melee dps/off-tank yes, but healer/dps not so much.  Which puts both elemental shaman and balance druids in a tough spot.
---
You can find them at multiple oasis(well atleast 2 of then for sure)
---
Not a deal breaker was just curious
---
No that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about though - that‚Äôs the ‚Äúclown suit‚Äù i referred to.

I take great pleasure from watching what you call ‚Äúsub par‚Äù gear come and go. I like seeing my character evolve, and piece after piece of whacky looking gear is the best sign of that.

You may think it looks bad, but that‚Äôs what I love. One man‚Äôs trash and all that

When did I say anything about a ravager again??

Oh no, angwy man is angwy :[

Played WotLK like 10 years ago and recently came back for classic, never got a pet tho.

That‚Äôs silly, you can park a horse without doing the same maneuvers as parallel parking a car
---
Stupid comparison as the priest/shaman/paladin aren‚Äôt needed to unlock the chest. A lockpicking/key/charge is.
---
i generally avoid pvp unless absolutely necessary but yesterday i was mining a node and a mob started attacking me so i stopped to kill it. i guess a horde player 10+ levels below me who i had not attacked or bothered thought that meant i was leaving the node for him. i killed him and took the node. will repeat every time.

Excuse me while I play the world's smallest violin.

Ikr? Has no clue what economic saturation is, he'll loose his shirt trying to resell those rods for 1.5g at this point.
---
Too bad I'm a Warrior.
---
What's your point? Yes, tanking 1-60 is easy and doesn't require gear/spec, so all the more reason for warriors who plan to DPS at 60 to tank while leveling.

Yeah I think you‚Äôre right.

Hi Q!
---
You commented on a thread of pretty much WW vs Ravager.
---
The assumption is that by saying WW is shit is that you like ravager better.
---
Hard to understand why someone would get this correlation based off the prior comments though huh?
---
Why not?
---
Play a warrior.
---
It forces you to play with others.
---
Or 
---
Play a hunter
---
And never need anyone.
---
If it makes you feel less lonely. All my friends quit after Wrath. And even now in classic my friends list is empty

Tried it. He said unfortunately there's nothing they can do

We dont need no stinkin rogues, my blacksmithing keys usually have higher lockpicking skills than these silly rogues

Level 20 Tauren Hunter on Kromcrush. First time every playing the game so I‚Äôm looking for a more casual group to play and level with. Want to do dungeons but am a bit intimidated. I‚Äôm in school and am trying to keep up a social life so playing time is somewhat limited but I play when i can!
---
That is your opinion. Probably a popular opinion. I certainly agree that 2h queues suck. However, even ignoring the technical limitations I pointed out, I think the vast majority of Classic players are on the #NoChanges train, and keeping layers in the game longer than necessary in any capacity would lead to more negative backlash for Blizzard. Even though the handful of realms with huge queues represent a large chunk of the playerbase, it still isn't the majority.
---
Again, you were given ample warning before rolling on the server. You regret that decision now, but don't want to take the out that Blizzard gave you because you feel your experience will suffer as a result, even though there is no actual evidence to justify your fears.
---
I'm sure if queues continue to be bad, Blizz will open up another round of transfers at some point. They will be to new/ low pop realms. I'm sure that Blizzard will also merge realms in the future if there is indeed significant population issues. Paid transfers might even be a thing at some point that would allow you to transfer wherever. That's just how it's done.
---
It's easy to point fingers at the big, bad, faceless corporation. Blizzard certainly doesn't have a perfect track record, but nothing is going to get better for you if all you want to do is sit in queue and continue to whine.
---
Lvl 2 SnD is worth. Lvl 1 no.

I personally can't get Threat Plates to work either, or any nameplate addons for that matter (Kui, Plater, Threat Plates). I'm curious if there's another addon I'm running that is overriding/disallowing all nameplate addons. Haven't been able to figure out which it would be yet though if such is the case. I'm not using any full on UI addons either (such as ElvUI, ModUI, etc.).

Bear tanks are great, but crushing blows are the achilles heel.    Bears make great main tanks early in progression and then gearing pushes warriors ahead and ferals are still quite viable as melee dps / off tank - plus oh shit pick up that add tank.
---
I was referring to when out and about, solo. Not when tanking. Yes. I know sunder has a substantial amount of threat.... which is meaningless when it's just you doing questing. The amount of damage gain from the armor reduction is... questionable, at least from what I've

There's a quest near tanaris that requires you to be a ghost.  So last night I went to town, found a low level alliance, and proceeded to insta-gib him with stormstrike followed by earth shock.  The game honestly encourages this type of behavior, although not quite as explicitly as in my example most of the time lol
---
Hell yea!  Git sum!
---
I did armoury 15 times before I saw the shoulder.
---
RNG is RNG, black desert has trained me well.
---
I was friendly. I tried to be friendly.
---
Saw Horde warriors and lowby mages struggling. dotted up their mobs, tried to give them a hand... I waved, I hugged.
---
I got ganked. By them. By their homies. By so many Horde on my Journeys through Ashenvale, Badlands... Hell, even sometimes in Duskwood.
---
We had a name for my kind in the olden days of WoW vanilla. Care bears.
---
I realized that, I need to stop helping them. I need to stop being friendly. I need to punish them. All of them.
---
I realized I needed to roll a Night Elf Druid, pick a bracket, and return to the areas beneath it. I needed to gank from the shadows. I needed to find every single individual fighting mobs and running low on HP, and send them packing with my regards to the spirit healer.
---
I needed to spread the seed of all the hatred I could, between the factions.
---
It's what Blizzard intended. It's what I should have done from the get-go.
---
This is Warcraft. Not Peacecraft, and to be honest Zechs was better as a Merquise... or even codename: Wind.
---
He's been a long time supporter of classic wow. He talked big time about nostalgia, and in the past was somewhat critical of the longevity of classic but still pushed for it anyway.
---
Leading up to launch he talked about reliving the original experience, doing quests for the lore/journey, not taking items because it would ruin his "vanilla" experience.
---
When the game went live, he flipped on those points. Nostalgic experiences aren't realistic, questing only for items, asking for items/gold from viewers. Generally came off as a cocky asshole while going against what a large section of vocal players think is the "wrong" way to play classic. Namely minmax dungeon grinding and begging for items.
---
Pretty standard celebrity broke their promise hate for video game loonies to over-react to.
---
Which is clearly an exaggeration. They are not the end all of pvp. Use everything at your disposal such as interrupts and stuns when they are casting. It‚Äôs easy to come on here and complain, but maybe try playing smarter.
---
I'm about to make a character and I need help deciding, my fav thing is tanking in PVE and being a spellcaster in PVP but trouble is picking a class, I can go warrior and be a good and fun tank but have to make an alt for my spellcasting needs, be a mage/warlock and be the caster but not able to tank OR go druid and be both, but as a mediocre caster and tank, talents would also be an issue as I wont be able to afford endless respecs so I would need to make some spec that is optimal for balance and bear tanking, I don't plan to tank raids, what should I do, pick one that is fun and good or pick both that can easily end up bad unless bear tank and balance pvp can be good
---
&gt;Utter nonsense. Anyone camping low levels should be as ashamed in game as they are of their micropenis irl.
---
Every time I read this kind of stuff it makes me imagine you literally fuming behind your screen lmao
---
If it‚Äôs right at the start abandon and re pick up
---
Definitely the second
---
No I really think that's his personality and not a persona. But like, he's really not bad at all, he's a little bit of each but so is everyone else
---
No prob. Happy cake day btw.
---
It's his vacation, if he wants to lay out on the beach and play WoW that's what he should do.
---
ENOUGH
---
How do all centaurs not have ears?
---
well, tbh every time that someone attacks me i simply attack fight back EVEN IF THE GUY IS SKULLED, this is a good way to know how work under pressure,  even if the guys camp my coarpse, before i get killed agian at last one wand shot i do in someone close to me lol.
---
and cmon, is not too bad when you die in wow, is not like you gonna lose your set or exp.
---
I like to let my butthole rest and reset after I shit though, that's why I take so long lol
---
God I can't wait til I'm high enough to quest in feralas
---
1. ability to re-order tasks
---
2. ability to create subtasks (make a heading task like go to SW, sub task is train at trainer and check Auction house and train first aid)
---
3. ability to link items (show tooltip) or just text of items (like using shift click)
---
4. ability to create a list per realm or per character (not sure if best to only have one total per realm and/or per character or allow multiple) - which could require a note-taker manager screen
---
5. ability to auto-complete people on your friend's list
---
This is basically the cookie cutter healing build for priest but a couple of things to note:
---
As a fresh ding you can make use of unbreakable will instead of improved healing.
---
Also I've heard that 2/2 healing focus shouldn't be needed in a good group.
---
Doesn't using beserk rage put you into chat there for blocking charge ?
---
We certainly do. I salute you!
---
Considering your username is your name and server, and you advertise your guild in your comment history, no luck necessary.
---
I finished it in \~ 1hr 20 minutes. But the group was 31,33,34,35,38. The level you are impacts the speed.  
---
Also I didnt realize how fast it was to get to, even as horde it is super quick with the teleporter.
---
I JUST WANT 2 APPRENTICE BLACKSMITH KILLS. 
---
FUCK YOU MEAN
---
Hmm like when I'm in SM I can see constant spellcleave spaming. It isn't that there are more spellcleave groups, the spellcleave groups just spam like 3-5 times as much as the non Spellcleave ones. Like 4 times in general and antoher 4 into local defense, etc.
---
You sound like a 12 year old.
---
My only problem is with people distorting my words, like this guy did multiple times, and others have too.
---
At no point have I said you should not use AoE spells, even at the start of the pull. My point was using either Arcane Explosion/Hellfire at the start of pulls specifically, which people seem to be forgeting. 
---
The very first  6 words in the OP mention AE exclusively and yet people have interpreted as any AoE for some reason.
---
Not gunna lie, I am salty. Mages are so damn easy mode. Make your own drinks and water or sell them, make portals to sell, aoe farm dungeons, and can kite to hell.
---
They're money making machines and so annoying to deal with in pvp. But at least I have a ghost wolf.
---
Welcome to old school WoW

I've got a /thanks macro for when someone buffs me, I put the paladin blessing as icon and I have to use it pretty often, which is nice
---
The auction house in WoW is absolute shit. 
---
Trying to buy silk and some guy has listed 100 individual pieces. 
---
I just scroll past all of those and buy the 20 stacks even if it's more expensive just out of principle.
---
&gt; a vengeful troll with a bangin‚Äô red mohawk. 
---
I could tell from the douchiness of that comment. My money‚Äôs on the paladin.
---
Imagine being on a vacation and not doing whatever the hell you want to because some guy on the internet has a problem with it.
---
oh, and I forgot to add (where's a todo list when you need it eh?) : You can export the entire interface code (XML and lua) from the game client itself.  Then you can inspect everything in Blizzard's UI and learn how they implement certain things such as panels, callbacks, scroll windows and everything else. 
---

If you are high enough to finish the last boss. The first trash is usually grey here. So I go here for gear, not as much exp.

---
Why would I not kill someone who is so dumb to stand afk outside of town?
---
Go to town if you wanna be safe, out here it's the law of the jungle
---
That's me, man. The week it launched I was up at 4 am. Now if I wake up naturally around then I'll get up at 4 am but usually, I'll just set an alarm for 5-6am and hop on that West Coast server for some stress-free questing/grinding.
---
Argh that's unfortunate, but fair I guess. Thanks all.
---
I use Chrome Remote Desktop and it‚Äôs fine, you can enable a virtual mousepad in the accessibility option in game to control movement.
---
Probably no where as good compared to this method, but it works flawlessly for doing my bank alt stuff while not home.
---
Makes me so happy. Also makes me so sad when I can't live up to what I want to be in classic... was helping a hunter tonight on an escort quest I had already completed in thousand needles and he fell to his death.... would have been able to see it through but had company show up to help me in refinishing my basement. Feel absolutely horrible about bailing on him.
---
I guess that would sort of lead to another question of mine. How can you really excel when the rotation is so plain? You pointed out some ways but how do you generally maximize uptime instead of just sitting there pressing a button? Would conserving mana be one way? And then how would you go about that? Weave wand shots in here and there?
---
I played BC and Cata as a bear tank and I feel the same way
---
It took me 9 months to get to 60 in vanilla.
---
I don‚Äôt know what the fuck I was doing the entire time
---
they kill lowbies because they deal just as much dmg as them
---
Bloodrage prevents you charging not beserker
---
My favourite thing was seeing an overlevelled warrior looking for a tank for like 45 minutes in lfg channel (he was like level 40 looking for SM Armory)
---
Seems a few people have tank capable classes but refuse to do it.
---
Meanwhile my group ran graveyard with a shammy tank and it was fine
---
I don't know if anyone cares but her last name is a mixup of Leggy Blonde
---
Then don't bitch?
---
Northwest/west of there is better honestly. The spawns are more spread out but it's less camped.
---
Almost everything wrong with retail WoW is something the community wanted or thought was a great idea that has only been revealed to be game-ruining in hindsight.
---
Remember when dailies first came out in BC? People thought they were fucking great "Now I have a reason to log in on days other than raid days." yeah that tune changed quick smart.
---
Him and Tirion are just chilling 5 minutes away from each other. Can you kite one to the other and have them fight?
---
moonkin isn't actually bad for raw dps in dungeons, it just has to drink  a lot lol
---
Come to razorgore:)
---
I don't understand why you don't make your own rods while leveling?
---
Cheers! Tanking is a bitch.
---
Was he? Doubt
---
There's no way of knowing how this actually went down from the OP. The only time I've ever seen something like this is if the player is straight up so bad that they need to get removed, and that's super unlikely in an easy lvl 44 dungeon. If we take this at face value, then literally this player was probably doing 15% to 20% of the dps and some dumbasses wanted another mage to do 25% instead.
---
Not only did they uselessly insult and hurt this person's feelings, they also wasted time getting someone to leave the instance and getting another person inside and jesus ZF isn't that long.
---
Yeah for real. How the fuck is selling shit for cheaper ruining the economy? 
---
The only reason I can think of is "I want to make more money so don't lower the market value." 
---
It's not like it really costs anything to get Devilsaur hides. You're not losing money by selling it cheaper.
---
Sorry, but you're wrong and don't understand why people play retail. I guess it's easier for you to be ignorant so you can more easily feel superior for not liking something. Doesn't make the things you say any less dumb unfortunately.
---
You really didn't even have to get to your random choice of how to bash retail, just saying a game company isn't going to pay attention to any user feedback at all is just the dumbest, most idiotic thing I've ever read in my life. 
---
Maybe you weren't paying attention over the years as Blizzard has always done the thing that the majority of the players playing the game want them to do. Maybe think that a human being that makes games for a living won't realize that they can make more money with two different games instead of two of the same game. Maybe you weren't reading Blizzard's posts as they took community feedback into account while doing things the majority wanted them to while developing Classic. Whatever it was, you're insane if you think Blizzard will suddenly stop and do the opposite.
---
But hey, you and other people of similar intelligence can make yourselves feel good for a little bit by hating something together, so what's the harm right?
---
I'm not making any rules. They can gank me at like half their level all day if they want. There is nothing stopping people from doing booring and stupid things to other players but I will complain about it because I think its stupid and pointless. 
---
It would be a lot more fun for everyone involved if they instead went and engaged in real wpvp with people who can fight back. They wont do that though, because they suck att pvp and are afraid of people who fight back.
---
obligatory [hit or miss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY5-50a0DUI)(I'm sorry)
---
I had to double check that I didn't write this comment. That's exactly what I do. I have a 9 month old. Friday and Saturday nights I'm in bed by 9 and up at 4 to play on a west coast server. Gives me almost 4 hours of playing before anyone is up.

I found an addon the other day that auto cheers anyone who buffs me - its great!
---
LOL XDDD
---
Been asking around with Hunters soloing in Mara everyone was saying Rotgrip was impossible. So being stubborn as i am. I decided to create a way. Hope this helps you guys out &lt;3 Happy Hunting
---
Awesome! Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!
---
Every exaggeration starts somewhere. I just feel like the mechanics should be altered when used in open world pvp. 
---
A 10 second+ fear is unbalanced.
---
Whining its good for the soul.  
---
I can be killed for days if you let me get mad from time to time.
---
I had a spriest melee attack and told me :chill it's just trash and I'm levelling my staff skill"
---
They're just too dangerous. You don't know when one is lurking in the rafters of your ritzy 6th floor New York apt with that amazing view.
---
To be fair, leveling as enh shaman feels the same way.  Nobody understands that they're not sleeping or running feared because of your tremor totem.  Nobody understands that that you saw the healer go oom, and stopped dpsing to take over as healer.  They only see that on that particular pull, your dps was shitty for some reason.  That's before we even talk about how much damage you're adding to other players in a melee cleave with windfury totem.  
---
It gets a little better in endgame pve, because we're actually respectable healers, and at that point people recognize the power of wf totem, even if they don't realize how strong the rest of them are.  And played well, we can be really obnoxious in pvp, especially paired with the right people.
---
Hi thanks I decided to play paladin so I can casually tank dungeons and passably heal in more serious content. Any suggestions?
---
That's awesome!  I need it, what's it called?
---
Well week ones couldn't survive in that environment
---
I actually happen to have a screen-shot of my druid-alt. How handy. :)

This is the UI set-up that I use for my characters. It's basically just Dominos. I do also have Details for TinyThreat &amp; playing with rotation theory-crafting.
---
God, all this talk of early morning classic has me anxious for the weekend already. Coffee and Classic at 5am on the weekend is what I look forward to every week.
---
Sure but nothing else. Don‚Äôt get mad at people who have pulled mobs out of the groups you agroed who haven‚Äôt been tagged is my point.
---
I just feel like the winning of a battle should not be based on "getting off one abiliy".
---
I don't need a new fucking post every time he farts.
---
This is called "pulling a venruki"
---
I love doing this and also trading items I don't need out whilst questing! Or having random players ask if I'd like enchants/giving bandages. Ahh classic is beautiful
---
Run SM armoury as they will be green to you and he will catch up as they give more exp % to him

I had one mage pull one of the named kills in Hillsbrad.   I did /say Noooo the named guy!  This dude straight polymorphed the named guy, separated the trash mobs, AoE'd them and then ran away from the named guy so he would reset.  There are some nice mages out there even though most of them are AoE dicks.
---
Works until arcanite tier where it gets way too expensive.
---
It is half the time
---
were you in hilsbrad during the ally raid? I remember fucking some some multiboxer right good on Skeram

Get a mage friend :)

I mean, it seems you‚Äôre just looking to vent on here. There‚Äôs no swaying you, and therefore I cannot help you. Just stay away from warlocks I guess.

How do you get so many blue BoE‚Äôs?

Yeah but he's a person lol. Like, people change their minds all the time. Plus, he got to relive it during the beta.  You can't live something twice

Just follow them around and cast r1 ae to break their 2nd nova. It'll wipe them.
---
Every spell has a different coefficient that determines how much of +spell damage actually affects it. I believe corruption is 100%, with each tick doing \~16.66% per tick to reach 100% at 6 ticks.
---
why? Cause he is farming a spot that is nearly perfect for aoe farming? I would and will even do this, when I go with questing. This spot there cries for FARM ME WITH YOU AOE SPEC!
---
And furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that all four of them habitually smoked Marijuana cigarettes
---
Close but no cigar. I never sold a name in any game in my life. The reason why I have so many chars is i simply wanna be know as THE guy, so i took same name on all the servers. Same for the alt, other are just random names here and there.
---
Amen, socal weather is a nightmare.
---
Is that really true of retail? Last time I tried tanking on retail was pandaria and my monk had no problem not being tank spec.
---
oh no i heard it in my head
---
Like a thanos snap, I'll restore balance with an upvote

---
You might go that route to save mana on regular mobs, or when running out of mana on bosses or dungeon mobs. That way you have a sustained DPS you can depend on even when you cannot cast anymore. As a warlock I find myself using the wand about 1/4 of the time.
---
Mana - If it has a few wand shots left that last 200 mana could be another frost bolt on the next guy.   
---
also using your wand puts you into mana regen mode faster. - This is important to increase kills per hour and having less downtime
---
Classic has loot tokens! Cenarion Circle, Zul‚ÄôGurub ect.
---
I missed it too... just realized it. :(
---
I like to freeze trap people multiple times so the quest mob runs far enough away so they fail it.
---
They were around for like 75% of vanilla though.

I wasn‚Äôt gonna play and then watched a friend play one weekend and instantly nostalgia hit and I started my old account back up the week after. Been having an absolute blast!
---
Oh yeah. Those who think it's just nostalgia are either people who weren't around for either vanilla/tbc or they are just victims of the old sunken cost trick.
---
&gt; With the lacking of dishonorable kills
---
Uhh, dishonorable kills are only for NPCs, what does that have to do with anything?
---
as a warrior i do it for efficiency, i'm a cold, ruthless kiler
---
Classic WoW is the definition of imbalanced PvP gameplay.
---
Horde players are so easy to trigger
---
I tried FFXIV, the admittedly small bit I played (maybe 30-35 hours) was not even as good as some of the worst main series games I‚Äôve played in terms of story. Super weird. More like Kingdom Hearts than FF but without the benefit of a bunch of Disney weirdos hamming it up.
---
This is the most classic post ever. Makes me miss the original forums.
---
&gt; It would be a lot more fun for everyone involved if they instead went and engaged in real wpvp with people who can fight back.
---
You seem to think these people should be concerned with your enjoyment and not just their own. They're not out to get you, they're playing for themselves. This is what you sign up for when you play on a pvp server. 
---
Complaining about it? Sure go ahead, but it's like that picture where the kid puts a stick in his own bicycle tire and falls down. Not going to get much sympathy for something that is self inflicted but go ahead if it helps.
---
I only remember that they made it more of a goblin zone, but I don't rememeber it being particularly offensive to me. What was it about?

I wish I could tally up the seconds their fear can last but the fact it can be casted twice or even a third time is insane for any matchup.

Ugh.

It's hilarious to me.

Right?  He was an encounter you couldn't simply outgear.  If people weren't on their shit, you were going to wipe on him.  Period.  Getting hit by him is what I imagine it would be like to get hit by Mike Tyson in his prime - while he was wearing brass knuckles.
---
Now this is the macro I need!
---
Because I don‚Äôt play private servers, I pay Blizzard to play the high quality game they made
---
As you sit in your group of 20 camping the BRS and BRD portals ganking one Alliance at a time.
---
Absolutely. I play an Undead Rogue and chose an aggressive/dark name, made it look as ugly/repulsive/vile as possible, and want to strike fear/hate into as many Alliance players as I can. I want the rep. I am also a nice fella and an Officer in your run of the mill raiding guild. Classic is fun for this reason. Community, reputation, recognising each other and sharing experiences of the same world. I want any Alliance player who sees my character to run away or be ready to die, or be ready for a challenge.
---
Its gone from quest log. And quest giver doesn't have it
---
Red is dead
---
loooooooooooool i haven't been in here for 4 hours but keep making crap up. i've been playing since 2004, get over yourself.
---
Wtf, deffo not on mograine ally, I've been trying to buy one for 50g since like day 3 lol. Tons of 75-100g ones.
---
My mate got his for 6g lol.
---
I ran it a few more times than you and saw it drop a few times but never was able to get it myself. I just waited out for my WW axe.
---
mhm sure
---
Removed damn
---
I keep seeing comments on the retail wow subreddit calling classic a niche taste. IDK man. I'm having a blast at lvl 40 being relatively new to wow, and I bet it doesn't take much to get hooked for the majority of people.
---
certain vanilla devs didn't like "hybrid" classes and purposefully made them terrible
---
I mean they are already lvl 25 elites or so that roam areas quested by people in the low to mid teens. I think it would be fun if they could grow to be the size of a fel reaver and twice as fast, but it's dynamic so they can get kept in check. Maybe after a while of ganking lowbies, a group of 30's could do it, but if the thing gets maxed out it's an avenger level threat that a raid of 60s will have to come clear up (for possible world raid boss loot...)
---
It looks nice
---
Gonna stay at 225 fishing for now by the sounds of things, might be Nat‚Äôs quest that does this.
---
Jesus
---
Fun Fact: There is an imgur chrome extension for this, but imgur tries their hardest to break it and I'm pretty sure its hanging on by a thread(of code).
---
I'll be sad when they discontinue it.
---
Is there an add-on for Hunter bow "swing time" so I can improve my kiting?
---
I mean.. If they report you and they see that you're doing it..
---
Laying on the beach and playing WoW sounds awesome though. If I lived in a place like that I'd do that all the time.
---
Isn't reddit a democracy, where downvotes hide stuff the majority don't want to see?
---
I have isolated the problem here. You play horde. Only idiots play horde. Rerolling to alliance should solve this problem.
---
What about armor pieces that just say "increases damage or healing done by spells by x amount" will that add damage onto each spell as well? I havent noticed a difference
---
I see a lot of comments about 7am being to late :D  
---
The ss was taken earlier, around 5:30am, I just put 7am in the title cuz of the song ;)
---
It does... maybe not with mana. Not sure.
---
Used to he a load screen tip too I believe
---
Well they sort of are needed to progress to that point. It's not like lvling your lock picking is hard. Its the rogue utility as mentioned above, and one of the perks of having a rogue in your group.
---
From what I can remember, the cookie cutter build thing was blizzard saying they didn't like it, and the community responding negatively to the talent system pandas introduced. I think the vocal majority in regards to the talent system thought that the point per level system was better than the tiered panda system.
---
Love it
---
Yeah it‚Äôs actually pretty hilarious. Kinda just have to deal with it. Most classes have some pretty OP shit. What do you play?
---
How do i delete someone elses post
---
Avoided by you yes, blacklisted by everyone? No.
---
PvP happened on a PvP server.
---
Short and sweet
---
And I played a horde dominated server as alliance in vanilla, it was absolutely fucking miserable and almost quit if it wasn't for rerolling on a PvE server.
---
* laughs in Orc *
---
is this flamelash eu
---
Because it's easy to do.
---
i never played retail. only vanilla and TBC, and very early wrath. 
---
nobody cares if you pull aggro when everyone is just body-pulling half the instance because it‚Äôs all trivial and nerfed. so it‚Äôs just a contest to see which dps can hold aggro. 
---
and druids / palidan‚Äôs don‚Äôt have sunders. i wait my 6 second pyroblast cast. after 6 seconds i go all in.
---
Agreed that‚Äôs kind of why I put the ‚Äú‚Äù in there. The only exception is Naxx and I guess AQ but Naxx is a year away. But the time consuming part is ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù in a sense as many players are older and have IRL responsibilities. Part of why I assume they will track the average player level and try and release phase two when at least a lot of people are 60. Then ideally you want them to at least do MC right? Like why release content faster than the player base that is paying a sub fee when you could just wait until most people actual see the current content before releasing the next phase.
---
You'll run out of mana often, and a wand is great for conserving mana or finishing off weakened opponents.
---
In raids/dungeons you'll want a way of doing some DPS without drawing too much aggro, if you're getting too much heat swap out to a wand for a bit, then back to spells.
---
Blizzard needs to give 5k people an incentive to leave lmfao
---
&gt;mage: novas the mobs and blinks away 
---
&gt;me, a rogue in stealth with cheap shot: /laugh you dumb bitch
---
LOL, classic is a beast few can handle i see
---
Truer words have never been spoken.
---
I get sad when I see a dead body and I cant rez them because they are horde. I'll have a moment of silence for them and /pray before moving on.
---
He now probably thinks that he is so retarded for falling to his death that you gave up on him and left.
---
Seems like they hate him cause they ain't him tbh
---
People get up to 600-700 + damage gear in end game vanilla. So with your second example a single cast of corruption would do something like 5k damage and kill most players with a single cast. Probably wouldn't be the best.
---
3 guildies from retail chose alliance just to gang us in full world buffs when we go to raid. We plan to do the same. When people duck with me.. on purpose.. repeatedly.. I call them over. This shit isn‚Äôt a one time passing by thing. It‚Äôs people like the OP mentioned that come in and purposefully try and fuck with same faction farmers. Just because I have friends that play this game, doesn‚Äôt make me a bad guy when I get fucked over by some one who could literally ask to join my group, get their quest items/kills and move on, instead of trying to fried me because they are too shit at the game to farm themselves.
---
I didn‚Äôt know plastic straws where in classic
---
thanks
---
Hello me, meet the real me. I too detest the game, however I am 60. I really don't feel it gets better but there is nothing else currently on the market that interests me and the subscription is already paid for. I have reached a gear point where I don't feel an urge to better myself since I have been entering MC. Gold doesn't feel like it matters as I have an epic mount. Yet I keep logging in running around Org til I upset myself and log off. We will see how I feel once this first month ends but currently i'm in the life raft of being bored out of my mind.
---
People have been saying this but I‚Äôm on Fairbanks as well and haven‚Äôt been attacked even once in hillsbrad..
---
Complete noob here. When leveling, how often do you change hearthstone locations?
---
Is this serious? I haven‚Äôt  played retail in a long time so I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs a joke or not. Do that have robots that will go farm for you and fight your battles?
---
Bad wiping? NAH . . . Bad you.
---
You're correct there my friend but Warlocks can still cast in twice easily without any downside. You're cc'd (feared) for 10 seconds+.  How many times do they have to cast it to be ineffective? from my experience they only need to cast it twice before any character is toast.
---
If you're in Yojamba I have some spirit gloves at lvl 15 you might like.
---
yeah i mean as a rogue you never want to encounter any class while not being in stealth
---
warriors in general are not going to win many fights against any class either...
---
classes are not balanced for 1v1 pvp and they were not meant to be anyway
---
That makes it a lot easier than I thought. I thought you had to be damn sure you would kill him, otherwise you had to farm the mats again. Guess the game ain't THAT hardcore.
---
Crack it's digital crack.
---
Come to Stalagg. We need more alliance.
---
I rolled a 100 vs a 1. Gotta do 208 jumping jacks now
---
This minutes before I see a mage aoe farming a large pack of them, wondering how the fuck he got a large pack of turtles to aoe farm...
---
Thanks dude. The best part about classic wow is the rep on the server and he just ruined his.
---
I love world pvp, but I'll never attack a man who's fishing. It's just a personal code.
---
I'm rolling a PvP server because the fun kind of ganking outweighs the retarded kind but I will still feel like the retarded kind is retarded. So no, I'm not putting the stick in my wheel.
---
Btw, if your idea of enjoyment is staying at a quest hub half your level and camping it the whole day then you are in a sorry state as a human.
---
Neither one sells food or drink.  Neither does Innkeeper.  Did find a Tawny Grisette &lt;Mushroom Vendor&gt; on upper level who sells food/drink.
---
&gt; I didn‚Äôt know plastic straws where in classic
---
Ouch...my turtle esophagus.
---
I'm very sad WoW doesn't have any kind of buy orders system. When there is low volume of an item you're kind of at the whim of what people will even list it at (even if no one buys it then), instead of throwing out an offer than someone could consider matching.
---
Well yeah, male voidwalkers have gigantic void dongs protruding out of them.
---
Taming the vulture with screech is the hardest one, there's like 2 up ever I swear
---
As easy as that
---
Get on my level, I body pull a few and then bubble to drop aggro.
---
It is so bad that most of my groups are composed entirely of hunters as another hunter it sucks. And almost all the tanks are taken.
---
As fire, good luck in BRD and Molten Core.
---
The trick is to have Carly Rae Jepson on max volume. If you do this you will always get a good roll. Keep this on the DL.
---
Loot council is how the top guilds in the world operate so it's obviously the best system for everyone /s
---
Loot council only has a chance of working if you can find 40+ people who have complete trust in each other. DKP is better (easier/less drama/less hassle) for 99% of guilds.
---
Ima be 100% honest, I played vanilla, but really only on the backend right before burning crusade.
---
I love pvp servers, going thru contested zones and whatnot, having those random interactions with friendly bros of the other faction.
---
The only reason I‚Äôm on a PvP server is because one of my good friends promised he would duo lvl with me.
---
I still find it enjoyable, but sometimes, I as a dude that‚Äôs works 70+ hours a week, it makes it hard to enjoy the game when shit i need to do to progress quickly is camped by a random dude.
---
I know he‚Äôs just having fun on his own way and I really don‚Äôt mind.
---
All the same, fuck you, random dude who camped me for half an hour, I still killed your blacksmith homies.
---
No, someone just spent more time on a better version of the half-assed joke you are trying to make
---
I change it every time I get to a new quest hub as they usually have flight paths. That way you can run all over the map and then hearth back when quests are complete.
---
Clearly.
---
The rogue who unlocks it gets to choose. They can offer it to the group roll and be nice, or they can be greedy and keep it. Without him in the party people cang open it anyway so its a net loss of 0 for everyone else.
---
Sharing it might get you invited back to groups in future though.
---
The questing zone where Horde comes at 20's and Alliance at 30's? Should be the other way around
---
I did it all the time.  Gotta get that rich thorium vein.
---
Were there no other classes that used mana in the group to just give him some of their water? Even though it gets pretty expensive for the higher level water I'd happily give him ~10 or so of mine just to make the dungeon faster
---
&gt;Go into System, Advanced settings and uncheck "Max Foreground FPS," "Max Background FPS," and make sure "Hardware Cursor" is disabled.
---
Does this need to be ran once or every login and per character or just first time logging in?
---
Clear intent to exploit is the collection of extra loot  before the reset.
---
Get your hits in while you can, coward. I‚Äôm coming for you and others like you. And unlike you, I don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre AFK or busy fighting a mob. I will put my chin in your chin and we will see who is a stain on the ground and who isn‚Äôt.
---
Everyone wants to talk about how great the community is in classic wow.
---
What a childlike fuck. "well just bring you in the next run"
---
What font is this?
---
Still a 3 hour que on herod.
---
Yeah BC improved a lot of the class spec imbalance (there was still obviously some) and removed the hybrid tax that plagued vanilla BUT they also kept class identity intact. I personally wish we had BC instead but vanilla is a close second for me.
---
I'm Ron Burgundy?

---
Just contact a GM they‚Äôll get you sorted
---
im using this right now, its the best option.
---
You'll survive, I believe in you!
---
I enjoy the travel times as a mechanic but I never had a problem with the portals between cities.  Especially after a number of the cities were in expansion zones.
---
Portals between cities is essentially the same concept as the tram between IF and SW, but for cities too far away for something like that to make sense.
---
You don‚Äôt have to pull the whole yard though
---
Hey, I was actually toying around with the UI before server restart. 
---
It's not done yet and it's just my leveling UI, so nothing special [yet.](https://i.postimg.cc/MZpkPDrZ/Wow-Screen.jpg)
---
Max level or leveling? For leveling I usually like to cast Hunter's Mark/Pet Attack macro, let my cat get some aggro, then Serpent Sting, Arcane Shot, and Multi-Shot, then auto attack until dead so I regen my mana. I typically set thresholds for my mana to not go below in case I need to react to a situation, but also make sure not waste mana by being topped off so I'm more efficient. You can also  immolation trap and pull the mob into it, but it's not always efficient when chain pulling.
---
Threat building was removed from demo shout.
---
Imagine being the dude trying to gatekeep a leveling learning instance, oof
---
Yeah but that whole leak has the Horde ultimately winning. Which will piss off a lot of people.
---
Mainly i think the thing is so convoluted and stupid.
---
Ironically, the guy using that as an insult is probably 18-21.... at a 28 year old, I have no fucking clue what he is on about, even after reading your explanation
---
This is neat! I‚Äôve always done this by just putting a macro on my bar that I update before I logout each night that just pst‚Äôs myself.
---
This happened to me in that super long barrow in the night elf starting zone (the one for The Relics of Wakening) at level 8 so now I do the opposite. Always have the highest capacity quiver for my level, and I always fill ~4-10 of my non-quiver inventory slots with arrows as well. Usually by the time you're inventory is that full you've used a few stacks and can move a few from your bags to your quiver to free up more space.
---
The other nice thing is that it means when I fuck up and forget to restock I still have ~10 stacks or so and will be fine in most situations
---
If you want a big and active community then you are pretty much forced to join a pvp server. Also constant fights where you are killed by 3-4  guys that are always together can't really be defined as fun. 1v1s and the occasional 2v1s are fun, but constant 4v1s become a tideous encounter that take the fun out of the game.
---
ON DORSET
---
I‚Äôm glad they did and now that I got to watch their video, I‚Äôll always call it that!
---
Ah, damn. I thought I'd randomly run into a person I fought with ages ago. I won my battle, you win yours?
---
Pro tip, do not join guilds that use loot council or dkp.
---
Yes
---
WeaponSwingTimer is what I use.
---
Actually got it from a \[chain quest reward\]([https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3843/the-newest-member-of-the-family](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3843/the-newest-member-of-the-family))
---
I posted it separately
---
Maybe try making your own group, then?
---
Yeah we do, we just have a 30 min cooldown.
---
LOL, I‚Äôll obviously respec frost when appropriate. Now is not appropriate. After MC frost &lt; fire
---
It's very simple. You are part of a 5 man group where everyone brings something unique to the table. Rogues brings the unlocks just like Shaman brings totems and Druids bring buffs and the ability in a clutch situation to jump into bearform and tank for a bit.
---
Correct, all mobs no longer share threat collectively but individually now with demo shout
---
IMO go for the axe or mace from Gnomer.  You can farm the last bosses through the back door entrance very quickly.
---
Yeah ganking vs. camping is a pretty big distinction.
---
A potato with a plug can run wow.
---
I'm facing no queue's on any RP server.
---
I fondly remember pwning all alliance with my warlock at Hillsbrad at 80, except maybe priests.  And I fondly remember pwning all alliance at Hillsbrad at 80 with my mage, except rogues.  Fuck rogues.
---
I have a problem with loot council because just like the other comment he geared his guild officers.
---
Theres always gonna be people on LCs that have the mentality that this guys my friend I'm gonna vote him in for this drop. LCs are corrupt.
---
 
---
If you think dkp is better 
---
you obviously have too much time to play this game
---
...then maybe don't add flight paths at all, if travel was in dire need to be so scarce?
---
look, flight paths exist for a reason, and they do it wrong. probably in retail there is an overambundance of them, but some are preposterous.
---
A lot.
---
Than.
---
Kingdom of Azeroth is the old name for Stormwind area.   Azeroth = south of Blackrock Mountain.
---
Old abandoned lore today.
---
I have next to zero tolerance to put these on ignore, and I assume other people do too.  
---
Which makes me wonder, do you think it's a lot harder for them to find groups than normal players?
---
Demonic runes drop from high level demons mostly in Felwood. They restore mana at the cost of life.
---
You can cleanse the flowers in Felwood as well to get useful items bop items. Cleansing the Corrupted Songflower gives you an hour buff that increases crit by 5% and all stats by 15, and Night Dragon's Breath will give you a mana+health potion. You can get int or spirit buff items from repeatable quests in Blasted Lands as well. 
---
I'm sure there's something else but this is all I can think of atm.
---
wow you're a downvote *guru*. How do you do it?
---
r/chonkers
---
Mages are the new hunters. The biggest group of retards play mage.
---
Exactly,  
---
The Rogue cannot get to that part (99% of the time at least) alone anyway so he wouldn't be able to open it either without the other ppl. It's an effort group.  
---
It's like saying we need no healer to kill last boss of monastery, so he should not be able to loot, but you wouldn't have gone this far/fast without him
---
late response to this but I 100% heard the old AOL/YAHOO! email notifications. "YOU'VE GOT MAIL!"
---
If you wanna see some bullshit, go to Gadgetzan. Look at the flight path to Orgrimmar, then look at the flight path to Ratchet.
---
Gadgetzan -&gt; Orgrimmar.
---
Gadgetzan -&gt; Thousand Needles -&gt; Camp Taurajo -&gt; XR -&gt; Ratchet
---
If you get camped for literally 5 straight hours you likely deserved it.  Not too many people have that much sociopath in them without good reason.
---
I really like that. Just elvui?
---
It's nice that we hunters can be super mana efficient and still kill near their normal rate though. Hunters mark, serpent sting, then auto the mob down while you wait for the mana regen to kick back in.
---
Ammo is a bit harder to mitigate...at least it lets you get your weapon skills back up to level!
---
I wanted to do Wailing Caverns (as Alliance mind you, and fairly overleveled) once "for fun". I liked the theme of it. By the time I was done I could NOT believe how long it was for that low of a level (not to mention incredibly maze-like where even Atlas was barely useful), and how completely unreasonable perfect deviate scales are for the belt. I would not be surprised if WC turned some Horde off of dungeons til they got dragged into something better.
---
Stop crying and roll a lock.
---
Just be like me and dodge your IRL responsabilities to the point I might be on the street soon

Nemesis helm?

I'm not playing hunter myself, but this might be useful:  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weaponswingtimer](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weaponswingtimer)

No, he eventually had others join in.

Yes but if what was described in this post happened, it isn't cheating as stated by Blizzard.

does no one know about the google remote view? it took me a second to look at my desktop and click "log on". i know im wrong about the full server thing but i give googles desktop view high praise. I love using it, and i cant see whats wrong with taking 1 second to click the button on your phone.  
---
Yea my only issue is I fear being on an empty server, thats why i stay on this full one. who knows games been out for almost a month and still not dead so we have to see.

If its efficient people will do it. However, people put stock in numbers entirely too much. If things are getting cleared then that's fine. Everyone in the party made a choice. "Do we invite this lvl 43 when the boss is 46?" If they answered yes because they wanted to start then they should shoulder some of the responsibility. Its disingenuous to place the "blame" on one person.

I think blowing people up as ele shaman is very fun and this guide looks interesting and gives me hope, however I would prefer to see it in action first, do you know if anyone has attempted this?
---
Windows+shift+S let's you select an area to screenshot and copies it to your clipboard.
---
I think the big issue is that there's a balance to be had there, and Blizzard threw it way too hard in one direction.  
---
Basically Blizzard's attitude was to water down everything but the content that only the hardcore 1% or whatever would bother with.
---
Yes you might! The games are two different styles. Classic is slower paced, less hand holding over modern WoW. So give it a try and see what happens.
---
But first you have to be exalted with Shen'dralar.
---
Help never pulls up for me. I just google it lol.
---
gamers rise up
---
indeed, the alt tab method is the best method
---
...Leveling as Balance??
---
Resto for leveling, sure, but I personally enjoy questing and not dungeon spamming.
---
Truth is, if you want to level a druid and not hate your life - you're doing it in cat or bear form til like level 30 or 40 minimum.
---
Oh fuck off.
---
Wasn't it "I put on my *robe* and wizard hat"?

I get it. You clearly don't understand why the post was made, unless you're the ninja. Almost seems to be the case as well.

For some reason both Bagnon and Onebag3 sometimes crashes on me. Making it impossible to click items in the bag. Only way to solve is with a /reload.
---
I heard ArkInventory exists also, havn't tried that yet. Hopefully this issue will be fixed sometime later on. The map is Sexymap.
---
yea i guess its just good for my situation, i work 5pm-1am, sleep 1-7ish. then play from then to when i work. If i take a break im gone for at least 30\~ mins and it doesnt log me out, so im not sure the cutoff D: Yea they will have to do something about the queues
---
You can go herb/skinning for money or mining/skinning even.
---
Mage is pretty self reliant. You have your own mana potions (mana gems), conjure your own food/water.
---
I can't get the quest to teleport to gnomer and the GM strait up told me that he could not do anything other than submit a bug report for me. I specifically remember running into the same bug years ago and the resolution was to just give me the item. I feel your pain.
---
Good point!
---
How does the respec cost work? I guess it goes up each time, but does it ever reset? Anyone know what the different prices are?
---
You're clearly the same guy.
---
Ah damn. Maybe that was a pservers thing. God that's rough.
---
Well the Alliance gets camped there. Horde has a flight point 50 feet away
---
Drives me absolutely nuts. It's not terribly common but will still happen several times a night. It almost always snaps straight up vertically for me.
---
I did the wetlands -&gt; Shadowfang Keep run twice as an alliance in the first week of launch, but at least the reward was a high quality dungeon that's a solid length imo. Can't imagine running all the way to dun morough as a horde just to have to suffer through gnomer
---
I was doing the second part of the succubus quest and as I approached the bridge, I saw a half health lock running towards me. He whispers to me, " Don't bother, ally camping it". I thought he was somehow trolling me because he didn't want competition for the spawn. I cross the bridge and I see Comar and start doing my quest. I get Comar to about one bar and out of nowhere I get kidney shot by a level 60 ally rogue. After voicing my frustrations in general chat I found out that the same guy had been camping that for the past 12 hours. : /
---
I was confused at first too, lol. And grats on your mount!
---
You trying to show us that you're too lazy to fishing?
---
I attempted this thinking being naked that the horde players would have mercy.. no such luck.
---
2 one hand axes and a bow or crossbow is very head hunter to me
---
I'm on your side but this is also an iffy one. In theory it "costs nothing" for a rogue to unlock a chest. In practice there was a thread earlier about it with TONS of rogues treating lockpicking as a profession akin to mining etc (which in my case I would say it's still fair to roll for claiming high end ore or to hash out how skinning works, which is exactly what I and some others did in a group earlier in terms of agreeing on skinning a dungeon with lots of potential for it). With blacksmithing, skeleton keys are decidedly NOT free. I don't have blacksmithing but were it me I'd probably ask to at least cover the cost of the key before the group rolls on it, or else get a rogue to do it for free. But I don't have even the potential to do either so I can avoid that drama.
---
This is on you, not Windows...
---
Why not dkp tho? Its loot distributed using math? Fairest way to do things and no room for bias or corruption like loot council
---
ah yea i havent had a problem with whitemane luckily and im level 49. hopefully i can get to 60 without any issues. best of luck to your leveling!!!
---
Playing alliance on a PvP server is hard mode
---
PepeLaugh
---
Of course.
---
Can't wait to see! I tried this method already, and the amount of data it uses is crazy ...
---
I understand why this post was made, you think it's gonna get upvoted because a community that tells everyone to need on BoE's is somehow gonna change how they feel about some dunce's rolling greed first on a big BoE.
---
That's why it's funny.
---
Thanks. I think the addon is just called Class Colour or something along those lines.
---
My first character was a blood elf paladin in wotlk, i didnt mind the model üòÇ
---
You are missing the point. Blizzard can't implement Classic design in Retail, because it can't be cherry picked. It needs to be done wholesale. Leveling needs to take a long time. Servers would need to be seriously consolidated to build server specific communities rather than the faceless cross-server system they have now.
---
Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why you can level from 110-120 so quickly in BfA, but it takes a very long time to: level your Heart of Azeroth, (used to have to regrind Azerite Armor), and now have to put in considerable time and effort into collecting and leveling your essences? What content has these features centered around? Daily, repeatable, content that you will do hundreds, if not thousands of times before BfA is over. Why is it that major cornerstones of BfA revolve around throw away content that you will do thousands of times? Why don't they just make the leveling process long, like in Classic or TBC?
---
I played retail hardcore from 2007 - 2010. Came back at the end of MoP for SoO. Started raiding semi-hardcore again with Mythic in all 3 raids during WoD. Raided super casual at the beginning of Legion and eventually started hardcore progression raiding again during ToS with Cutting Edge achievement in Antorus and got CE in Uldir and quit in late Feb/Early March during our Mythic BoD progression while we were 7/9 and I could have easily continued on for CE in BoD.
---
I have over a year worth of played time on my main.
---
I have played in social ultra-casual guilds, casual, semi-hardcore and progression based guilds.
---
I had many top 10 and some top 5 parses on my main with mostly orange parses.
---
I have played the fuck out of retail more than any other game, period.
---
The only place you have to look at is WoD LFR. 
---
LFR started as a plea to "see the story", but it was never about story, it was always about loot. Shitty and/or lazy players only wanted to **look** like elite raiders. When Blizzard took tier sets and raid trinkets out of LFR the participation dropped off. Very few, if anyone was running LFR during WoD. Players made it a big enough deal that they brought tier sets and raid trinkets back to LFR in Legion. It wasn't about the story, it was the fact that they couldn't get good loot there.
---
Another thing to remember is that Blizzard tried, and failed, to "bring back classic" during Cata. They made it more difficult to quest, pull more than one mob as mobs hit harder, etc. They tried to make heroics heroic again, and bring back CC. The community bitched and moaned until it was changed. However, without the other missing components from Vanilla the formula was incomplete. 
---
You can't just make shit harder to do, without the rewards being meaningful. Quests have no value if XP has no value. Gear has no meaning if it has no impact. You get an upgrade in Classic and you feel it, especially if it's a weapon. In Legion I was min-maxing every tiny little %, but rarely was it noticeable. Simming over and over again to see if one combo of gear was a .1% upgrade over another set of gear.
---
Don't believe me? Here's my spreadsheet tracking all of my upgrades during Legion from SimC:
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yQp50wdA72SIgoH3Ey6fZjTSVRCJ2sDtzEEAN3jOl0/edit#gid=1951297917
---
There are players, like my former guildmates who put a lot of effort into their play, gear, and progress. There are players who make an effort to get good at PVP. There are those who roll on RP servers and make community their thing, but those players are a microscopic minority, the one percent.
---
The majority of players can't dps, heal or tank their way out of a wet paper bag. They are the players who have decried and still decry Classic. The rose tinted goggles, the nostalgia excusers. They expect to be fed a slow drip of gear upgrades, and now they don't even have to complete content, because in 3 or 4 months a new catch up patch will show up with gear on par with the previous raids Mythic level gear.
---
These players have shaped Blizzard and been shaped by Blizzard to turn retail into a single player online game with multiplayer components. And why not? It's a lot easier to design a game based around World Quests and gating an afternoons worth of content across multiple weeks.
---
Mythic and high end PVP are the only aspects of retail (outside of RP servers) that require social interaction. Getting to know players and forming a community with them. Since the game doesn't require these things in order to get your drip feed of character progression, then large swathes of the community gave way to the solo-player mindset, and with cross server systems making everyone a random, nameless, body other players don't matter anymore.
---
Cover the key cost, fine.  But it is still the group‚Äôs chest to roll on.
---
On Stalagg there's typically about 15-20 horde to every alliance player.
---
So yeah it was annoying.
---
Thanks for the recommendations, i wanted to do mage/hunter because those are the two i WANT to play. but i dont know how well they work together, if at all lol.
---
I don't know how anyone on Faerlina/Herod/Whitemaine can complain about qs.  Before the game went live Blizz was begging people to get off those servers due to the long qs.
---
MOM HE ROLLED NEED AND I HAVE BIG REGRET ABOUT ROLLING GREED SO HERE I AM
---
Not an expert on Classic rogues (played one in early Wrath), but it could be one of the following:
---
1. You haven't skilled up your sword weapon skill high enough yet.
---
2. The swords you're using may be too fast or too slow for the job. An experienced rogue can advise on the correct weapon speeds to use.
---
3. Spec/talents can influence how effective you are using different types of weapons. If I'm not mistaken, Combat rogues are best with swords. Again an experience rogue can guide you on this further.
---
its not wrong. i just said its not wrong. who are you to say what is right and wrong with words?
---
Thank you
---
I‚Äôm always super salty people in Australia never warned the US about 9/11 being in the future and all.
---
Yeah, for me PvP is just a break from the stuff that really matters, and there's so much PvE content that even if I was unemployed and had nothing to do all day but play WoW, I still wouldn't be able to get everything I want done.
---
One of the things that frustrated me about private servers, especially the Nost/Ely PvE server was that the low level BGs were nothing but twinks and the 60 BGs were nothing but rankers.  There was nowhere for casual PvP.  We'll see when P3 rolls around if Classic is better in that regard.  I don't get much enjoyment out of a 3v10 WSG vs. a premade.  It's 1 cap that we can't stop and then the BG ends due to lack of people.  I like reasonably balanced PvP and WoW isn't a great game for that, but I'll take what I can get.
---
Same here! I haven‚Äôt played since early cata and game back solely to play wow during its greatest time (I actually think TBC is better but, whatever, classic is way better than retail)
---
I remember back in Vanilla my Arms Warior bud tried tanking DM West so I could get my Dreadsteed.
---
It kind of worked.
---
Prior to level 60 dungeons though it was whatever.
---
I have seen 3 people get suspended for this exploit already on my server. 2 enemy faction, 1 my faction.  It is 100% an abused exploit and can get you suspended and/or banned. Just report them, and anyone else that is apart of it. Have everyone that dies to them report also.
---
I see. This is excellent advice. Thank you
---
Excuse me?  Genuinely curious about this and if anyone else is experiencing it.  Why would I make this up?
---
Had no idea. Haha
---
pretty easy encounter since just kiting for maybe 4min for another piece to sell. I would gladly take some free blues chance at 4g+ from weapon drop
---
Especially if they're gnomes.
---
Im sorry buddy, I hope you get to game soon!
---
22 is the cap for buffs. Some of the things in the clip aren't considered buffs.
---
Well the browser they're using in game does not work correctly for anything besides max native resolution of your monitor. Certain button events, and what not you'll have to go full screen just for them to work, or just pull it up out of game. 
---
What's even the point of having it in game if it's like this?
---
It's because of all these other people that think you need if you need even on a super expensive boe that anyone can benefit from.  Now these people select greed and this just opens the door to ninjas.  Everyone need on boe no matter what the hell the item is.
---
Anyone got a list of all those chat commands?
---
Thing is, even on pvp server you cannot camp starter zone, only contested region so that's basically 20+.  
---
And having a 20min break is also nice instead of keeping getting camped for 20min
---
&gt;This is why relying on damage, for threat is not reliable
---
Not entirely true, for one the fury prot build is proof that it's extremely effective. Also this rotation will not leave you without a shield for more than even 7 seconds. Yes this is primarily more aimed at dungeons while leveling, but the most effective tool is to gauge the damage your taking and to know when you'll be switching from your 2h to your shield.
---
 If you're 55 and just going into brd as a tank, no way can this rotation work, the damage you'll take even for 7 seconds without a shield is too much on most mobs. Same situation but on a smaller mob, sure it can work. If you take everything into consideration, your gear, your 2h, your heals, the mob amount/type, a dps opener of some kind is possible.
---
I think he‚Äôs super fun to watch and ya you‚Äôre right he‚Äôs not that bad. I don‚Äôt like how he gets loot priority whenever they do raids and stuff but it‚Äôs his guild he can run it however he wants haha.

Leveling cooking without fishing seems somewhat foolish
---
I  love it, so so much, but my wife complains about it bitterly.
---
I'd love to see weather like this in battlegrounds.
---
I mean yeah some were pretty low but they could have all jumped you. I know my group of buddies would probably have at least tried. Quest be damned one dude come in and try to play with all of us gonna have to try at least.
---
I‚Äôve had multiple people respond to me thanking them with something like ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre one of those.‚Äù Lol idk how to respond anymore
---
wow someone who actually understands the realm types
---
Do you have a valid source for this ? I'm very curious what is considered a buff and what is not.

he always was
---

---
It's going there too, buddy.
---
Name and shame? What server?
---
Let them fight.
---
I let priest's finish mobs off all the time, I've been surprised by how many priests don't know they have to get the Killington blow though.
---
I've asked them before if they're trying and they admit they thought it just didn't work in groups or was bugged.
---
I'm having trouble deciding what class to play. I keep getting to like level 6 and then switching to a new class/character. Any advice on how to get past that first few level slog and keep pushing forward? I'm really liking priest and paladin right now. But I feel like I change that daily and I'm falling behind. It probably doesn't help I dont have a group to play with.
---
Eh some people are masochists, I mean some people choose to level in parties as resto, I have no words for oomkin as I've never played the spec other than just for the sexy oomkin dance.

---
Those expansions are the 'minor content updates' I was referring to.
---
The effort/cost is fairly low.
---
None of the games are doing bad, there just isn't hope for massive improvements like in the heyday of the MMORPG.  Consider that xpacs used to be thought worth the $40 they'd release for and games like DDO would come up with major reworks to rejuvenate the game(I mean, they invented the sub to F2P transition and were able to go from flagging to being a top 5 mmo for awhile).  There was huge interest/hope for changes in games like that...now it's more on par with a balance patch and new dungeon/quest area.
---
They most certainly will. This was endemic on pservers. It's not a retail thing.
---
Sure go ahead. Nobody cares. Make 7 new accounts and make new toons on full servers like a moron. Nobody cares.
---
So the alliance should let you have the resources just so you can get stronger to fight us? Uhhh not happening. Please enjoy your wetsocked logic.
---
I figured this out today and seems to be working very smoothly, I like your idea of berserker rage prep ull I was doing it right before ww or after
---
The cap is 32. There are invisible auras that take up buff slots. still up in the air what actually fills them though (rumors include talents/set bonuses, equip effects, enchants, but nothing is set in stone yet)

Truth. I ran WC last week with a friend (never played Horde, so I had no idea how long that shit is). I forgot to pick up arrows in camp and went in with about 700 thinking that'd be good enough... Definitely ran out about 65% of the way thru with the mage bitching at me for going melee. That dungeon is way too long for a beginner area dungeon, it wasn't even fun after the first hour.

---
Why would they outwardly express a negative attitude towards a system that they created that went against a no changes philosophy? Blizzard/Activision has never been known to admit their downfalls. 
---
Whether it‚Äôs instance layering to spawn bosses, or world layering to spawn mobs, and nodes, it‚Äôs simply not how the game was meant to be played. In my opinion asking for a layer invite in chat is exploiting. This an exploit that hindered of people warned the classic team about, if they decided to launch the game with the layering feature. However, maybe you are right, perhaps they don‚Äôt care, and this is the way they want the game to be played. Being able to layer into Gurabashi. Arena, and farm the trinket, in a matter of hours isn‚Äôt vanilla WoW, having thousands of gold, in a matter d weeks isn‚Äôt either.  
---
Heh, maybe they will add high rate servers soon too. We have 15x gold maybe we will get 15x Xp!
---
Would you care to provide another theory?
---
Not going to make 42... :(
---
When I posted that, I was 6 bubs away from 40.  As of right now, I'm 1 bub away from 41.
---
Basically, I do back-to-back dungeons.  I'm running a full Resto Druid.  It's easy for me to find dungeons.
---
It has been more than sufficient for tanking any dungeon I want to tank, and Sweeping Strikes + Whirlwind is actually pretty great DPS in the AoE meta that seems to have developed.
---
I'll be honest, I've mostly avoided PvP questing as a Warrior, but in the few instances I've had, imp. Hamstring has been great.
---
The thing is, the ‚Äúcookie cutter builds‚Äù thing wasn‚Äôt an issue with the game, but the community. The community decided the ‚Äúbest‚Äù rogue build was Combat Swords or that Beast Mastery Hunters and Demonology Warlocks were worthless specs. I have seen some incredible BM Hinters and Demo locks, and they do just fine in pretty much all content.
---
Now, you can make the argument that there are objectively BAD talents which should never be taken, but the solution there is to upgrade them to be more effective.
---
because it's not griefing to camp someone until it reaches more than a couple of hours. the point is to be able to shut down the opposing side and get them to give up and go away. i say this not as someone who does it but as someone who wants the threat of that coming from the other side.
---
if you want to decide when you find pvp fair, that's what pve realms are for.

---
Key word: tag.
---
Sure, but I *really* feel like it'd easily lead to drama. The "free" rogue lockpicking thread was amazingly contentious on both sides of the argument when I didn't think it would be (thus far all rogues I've gone with have just opened it for whoever rolled). I feel like when asking about a key there would be annoyance about who pays. Does one person cover the cost? Would you try to get piecemeal divide cost from everybody? Or most likely would you agree to unlock now for expedience with an agreement of cost sorted after the dungeon and then potentially get fucked over by a PUG dishonest about that? For a guild run keys would likely be sorted one way or the other, but for a PUG I personally think I wouldn't even say I had a key and just leave it unlootable in the case of no rogue.
---
A game can still be easy and the DPS low for a variety of reasons that aren't insulting: focusing on debuffs, reserving mana/HP, low gear, saving money for a mount so less training, bad rolls, casts being cut off, bad luck on wand drops, hitting in-instance resource nodes, getting bandages/prepping stones, summoning as party doesn't wait for you to be ready...
---
Crazy they both picked greed.
---
Ah I see.
---
By the way, I'm the one that won, that's why I don't feel good about it :(
---
For real. If you're my friend or guildmate I may let you have it. Otherwise, thats free resources. Of course Im going to take them. The fact that someone else is near it is just an inconvenience.
---
This is how it used to work in Asheron's Call.  As the mobs leveled up, they would auto-buy attack,  defense, and health.  We would kill ourselves off to ordinarily harmless bunnies on the outskirts of town to level them up into newbie destroying monsters who targeted them by accident.
---
I started playing on a PVP Realm in Classic for the first time... ever in WoW, and I've been learning that people who gank lowbies are basically admitting to the world they are shit at the game. So try to take it with a grain of salt; ganking lowbies is just an admittance of weakness and failure.
---
There was a post on here the other day stating that Sunder Armor is actually a better use of rage when leveling pre-level 36 (arms spec, using a 2H)... Better than Heroic Strike.

Bringing your laptop around all that sand sounds like an awful idea.
---
No man! I'm sorry. It's because I'm from Latin America so I don't know some common language expressions
---
I'd really like to set notes on players without adding them as a friend, plus players of the opposing faction. Any addon for this?
---
TBF to the class balance (wonky though it be), that‚Äôs what mages *do*. It‚Äôs pretty true to classical RPG design.
---
Mages do AoE damage and have good CC tools. If you want to be the one doing tons of damage in any circumstance, mage is the class for you. If you want other things or utility, other classes have slightly broader gameplay than mages who excel at just melting things. If you like stealth runs and getting where others can‚Äôt, rogue is fun. For people that like a little of everything, maybe druid is where it‚Äôs at. If you want to heal, you‚Äôre likely a priest.
---
For people that want to be pretty much guaranteed to do damage, there‚Äôs mage. Not saying the current grind to 60 meta doesn‚Äôt hurt people that want to do instances while not being a mage, Not every class needs to be equal at every gameplay avenue or metric, and that kind of thinking is almost exactly what happened to retail.
---
nah. the whole point of open warfare is to be able to demoralize your opponent. i want those players coming after me. keeps the game more interesting.
---
pvp does not imply fairness.

I can make that happen. I might add them to my Etsy shop.

Then don‚Äôt download and learn Tradeskill Master it makes the AH exactly what you‚Äôre talking about.

Arugal seems to be the first 'hard' dungeon boss of the game, his charm ability is such a harsh noob trap.

---
I have just officially released it for retail!
---
Should the tank charge for getting them there?  How about the healer?  Or the other dps?  It‚Äôs all a group effort.  To look at it otherwise is only personal greed.
---
If someone uses their resources to open it, compensate them.  But it doesn‚Äôt automatically get them the chest just because they‚Äôre special.
---
I wanna be him aswell, how do i do it?

You should have rolled need buddy move on with your life, or buy feet of the lynx for the 5g its on AH for ATM

There are definitely shaman tank videos on YouTube, I saw someone post about it on this subreddit a while back too, haven't tried it myself though!
---
&gt; I use multi shot after I‚Äôve already pulled aggro 
---
At least try to be consistent. Do you feign death before the multi lands and you pull aggro, or do you feign after you pull aggro? Which is it?
---
I just release it for retail and you can get it on the same urls!
---
Just keep playing whatever you‚Äôre in the mood for until one sticks. Worse case scenario is that you have a lot of decently leveled alts. Don‚Äôt worry about falling behind, new people are starting to play everyday.
---
You may want to look into what each class you‚Äôre interested in will be doing in the end game. Paladins and Priests are going to be expected to heal and spec for healing in most endgame PvE content, for instance.
---
What if im sending it to my friends on snapchat? its a lot quicker to use my phone then

You made the post. I'm just killing time responding to idiots.

Watching a mage use up their nova and blink at once is nice.
---
Just cheap shot, SS, kidney shot, walk away
---
Yes, but a lot of rogues don't use mainhand daggers (especially not PvE rogues)
---
Nothing will replace clear communication.
---
The primary issue is DPS starting at the *same exact moment* as the tank pulls/charges. Or worse, the DPS just deciding it's their job to pull.
---
I explicitly state at the beginning of each dungeon "I'm tanking, that means i'm pulling. After I pull or charge, please count to 3 before DPS."
---
That's literally all I ask and tanking becomes smooth and easy for 99% of random groups. For larger groups I'll mark targets. But for the most part it just boils down to "I'm pulling, count to 3."
---
Welcome! Check out the subreddit, /r/Grobbulus!

Yeah responding in literally any way shape or form is being defensive. Not responding at all confirms I have no response and was therefore lying. Either way you've already convinced yourself you can't be wrong so continuing this conversation is pointless.
---
I'll just say that you being mad about "exaggeration" is pointless. The original point of the post was people bringing up the "it's a PVP server LUL" excuse as a reason to camp lowbies. I hope that some day these people will realize that there is a difference between fighting same-level players in questing areas and being camped by people you can't possibly win against. Not wanting to be griefed doesn't mean you don't like PvP.

The northern part of EK around UC-Hillsbrad area is Lordaeron. The middle part around Dun Morogh down to Redridge (?) is Khaz Modan. The southern part around Stormwind-Bandlands-STV is called Azeroth.

Yeah, but why?

Yep, when I want to heal spellcleave I look in LFG. When I want a normal war/rogue/mage/x/priest group I ask in guild and start my own group.

Thinker Meta has always existed. I never played Classic in it's hey day but, I do know enough to know WoW had a nasty rep in the community. I also know Pservers had meta's that were way more toxic then what is in classic. People on Classic are way more tolerant then they were on LH. On LH if you weren't part of the meta you weren't doing anything. YMMV but, it's what I saw.

Well, it's possible it was from the ddos.  The only other thing I can think of is some sort of NAT or port issue.  I haven't a clue what ports wow uses but if it persists (seems like were beyond the ddos attack at this point) then that's where I'd start given what you've told me.  GL

Bonus healing doesnt apply to drain life or siphon life because you are healed based on the damage they do. Also spell damage and +shadow damage are less effective below level 20 because lower rank abilities have lower coefficients.

I just do dungeons because that's the most efficient way of leveling right now. Ever since I hit 18, I've been spamming dungeons almost non-stop.
---
18 : Deadmines to 23 
---
23 : Blackfathom Depths to 28
---
28: Gnomergan to 33
---
33: Scarlet Monastery Library to 36
---
36: Scarlet Monastery Armory to 38
---
38: Scarlet Monastery Cathedral to 42
---
42: Razorfall downs to 46
---
46: Zulfarak to 49
---
49: Sunken Temple to 54
---
54: Blackrock Depths

Send mail! You can see the name of the character that listed the auction. If something is overpriced and obviously not being bid on I'll usually send a letter saying "Hey, if this auction expires, would you sell for x?"
---
I've gotten at least 4 items that I wanted this way, for a price that I felt was fair.
---
That shit isnt anything new you mentiond here... also spellcleaves where also a thing back in the days, not as often as we see now, but it wasnt a nogo at all.
---
STV should be a warzone
---
Dude it‚Äôs Wailing Caverns. What kinda jerks are demanding molten core raid requirements for the lowest level instance in the game?
---
So far my experiance playing as alliance feels like ive been in stv since day one, horde straight dont give a fuck and its scarey
---
Ah this is my first time playing WoW so I did not know.
---
I also have +40 damage, and i am level 35
---
Have rogue, can confirm.
---
I think I have nightmares of that ‚Äúwoosh‚Äù sound... and when I said that, you know damn right that you heard the sound in your head.
---
Now I believe you when you say that he doesn't know how to dispel. But many players expect a dispel straight away. I am not going to cancel my 3 sec heal just to remove a slow, I'll do it afterwords. If the tank has polymorph or something, then obviously do it straight away.
---
Of course, I never said otherwise! Were on the same page. I'm just stating there is a possibility that they could have cheated at another time off stream. I personally do NOT think the bigger streams cheated purposefully, it's too big of a risk.
---
Idk, i definitely open chests for my party and roll on them. I dont see why i should habe a monopoly on chests i couldnt get to without the rest of my party, besides. Is it really worth the bad will of being selfish as a dps class ?
---
Accurate! (except the Pally part, just accept your fate and heal plate-priest)
---
Rogues don't go to church.
---
Yep. And even then, warriors and rogues will get a different ranged weapon with actual stats on it as soon as they are able for pulls.
---
This.  There are PVE servers if you want to do without half the fun of wow
---
But this was probably an upgrade for him. He can use it and you can't. Need before greed.
---
You seem to be the greedy one here.
---
The right way is to increase social immersion, others have mentioned a bounty board for example. Stuff like that makes the world more interesting, more social. Add interesting 4th build options while leaving others intact with slight number changes at most for balance, I mentioned else, like an Evasion Tank Rogue, or a Ranged DPS Rogue (I love Rogue). From what I understand BFA has a melee hunter, that'd be cool as long as we treat it the classic way. Still keep it expensive to respec, etc. Allow us to get haircuts, but no other modifications. Never allow paid server transfers or name changes. That way reputation matters.
---
So we‚Äôve both found our place, I don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre disagreeing.
---
Wonder how I got a GF
---
I only pick fights when it's a relatively even match and will help any horde I see that's in trouble with a mob. 
---
That being said, I don't mind getting ganked. There is almost zero penalty for it and trying to get away from a group that's camping you can also be fun. It's like being the fox during a fox hunt and it's fun in it's own way. 
---
I'm not really sure what the people complaining expected? There are so many ways to counter other players in PvP; from joining an active pvp guild, to stocking up on specialist consumable items. I once killed 3 horde that were chasing me by drowning them. I had water breathing potion, which I always carry, and they got tunnel vision. By the time they realised what was happening I was doing everything I could to slow them down and keep them under. - It's experiences like that which make PvP servers so much fun. 
---
Unfortunately, the default response to being outnumbered, or not have some sort of advantage to start with appears to be to just give up, which by the way, you can also do. The graveyards are there if you don't want to deal with the situation.
---
Eh, my guild couldn't make up it's mind on which server to roll on so I ended up making 2 characters on each PvP server so I'd be set no matter what. With the queues as long as they were, I didn't get around to actually deleting them until last week. I expect it was something similar for OP.
---
Oof
---
Thank you! Glad you responded after all.
---
How do you know he isnt trying to finish his quest? Yeah, you dont. That isnt fucking with him, if anything he is getting fucked.
---
Yes! It saves between sessions
---
This kind of mind set make no sense to me. Don't take it personally. If you only want to pvp on equal terms (CD discrepancy? seriously?) then play on pve server, flag yourself and/or do battlegrounds. 
---
I really dislike the idea that every game needs a tangible in-game reward for doing anything in order to make it worthwhile. This is an mmo, killing enemy players is part of the fun for many, and so is helping out your own faction for the matter. You might never see a reward for either one but so what?
---
(I personally think camping is shitty but even then you are not completely helpless, rally your fellow adventurers and do something about it.)
---
I WoW on a Dell Optiplex 790...

---
About leveling a priest ... is the "thing" to go shadow spec until you hit 60, and then respec if you plan on playing healer?
---
As a rogue, that would make me lose all combo points if I was in combat I think lol.
---
The undeads tongue makes me cackle
---
I haven‚Äôt had to wait since day 3 of wow classic, even at peak times, what‚Äôs so great about this server
---
To be honest, that's a bug that was fixed on cersion 1.1.5. I have JUST updated it. If you download now you'll get the fixed version! I'm sorry for that
---
I walked into the Gadgetzan Inn on Shazzrah and saw a 60 mage in the corner indiscriminately firing frost bolts at people.
---
I tried to make exactly that point in a recent thread, and that the absolute absence of meaningful death penalties in games like City of Heroes encourages players to engage with the game in new and creative ways. I think I‚Äôm still racking up downvotes on that one.
---
Oh man thank you i had to check mine just now
---
Death is more of an inconvenience than anything in wow. How many times have we "died" before? People survive all kinds of crazy shit that can be fixed with a quick questline. Valkyr don't really care either and can bring back pretty much anyone it seems. And even if they're still dead they can always stick around as a jedi ghost in case they need exposition.
---
They made it to the water
---
Clique allows for modifier keys, so you can doit either way.
---
Imagine actually choosing to play alliance
---
You get buffs on fire spells I find that fireball and scorch have decent mana pools for a pvp fight.
---
Herod will have a queue until the release wow classic again.
---
Sure I understand. In the above case for a PUG I personally would NOT use the key to ninja loot for myself even if in theory I could. I've had groups with no rogues and no blacksmiths/keys and we just moved on. It's a thing we didn't have the requirement for. Were I a rogue I would open for a group roll because it's free to my understanding. Probably the most reasonable way to handle a key is to charge the cost of it to the roll winner moments before opening it, but I still feel it's an imperfect solution. They could easily be dissatisfied by gambling the cost on a chest with nothing that interests them (though I *assume* vendoring items would still beat the cost of a key, but I'm not 100% sure). This all is why I'd say it's not worth squabbling over this king of crap in a PUG, and in a guild/with friends I assume tangible or intangible benefits of helping each other out would make the key not a big deal.
---
And your tank question is perhaps less clearcut than it seems. While I'd personally frown upon it, I HAVE seen tanks try to whore themselves out (seemingly usually unsuccessfully) for certain groups, as well as the reverse of a team begging for a tank and saying they're willing to pay for it.
---
&gt;AoE spam is so much more inefficient compared to just clearing the dungeon normally.
---
You can clear Cath in 20 minutes with the right AoE setup. AoE spamming in a mixed party is a terrible idea, but the concept itself works if it's set up correctly.
---
Cool, I'll update now
---
They're probably doing it by waves to see how many transfer and control the flow.  
---
There will be more future free transfer due to how full some servers still are. Though which ones can change.
---
Famn, what server was this. That seller was a derp.
---
We were. I remember looking at his screen and saying ‚Äúwtf‚Äù
---
You know, Hgarth sounds neither male nor female. This orc is just ahead of their time.
---
Go delete multiple versions of questie.  If it's just bugging out type /console reloadui        that should fix it
---
Best in slot orrrrrr....?
---
Yep, this is me too.  Never had a problem with turtles.  But finding birds? Yeah, forget it.  That one giant carcass that they tended to spawn around is *always* heavily camped.
---
So **that** is where Chronicles of Elyria got that idea from? Nice :)
---
Why? Its efficient and awesome. Just a perk of being a mage. If you don't find it fun then fair enough. Its not stupid though! i am envious when I see mages do it
---
I love how its implied the dude doesnt give up leveling for any occasion, yet looks like level 12.
---
Pretty much.
---
The best way is to grab some decent wands as you level up (I think enchanters make some good ones early on) invest in the wand talents and go down the shadow tree to get Shadow Form.
---
You really don't need to be holy/disc spec for early game dungeons unless you're severely undereleveled, it's only at the end-game content that you need holy/disc spec to keep up.
---
First respec is only 1g, so don't be too worried about messing it up since late game you find grey item drops worth more than that.
---
The flight to Thunder Bluff is most definitely NOT express. It is free though.
---
What's the imp wand? I'm normally a rogue, but playing a mage this time around and don't know good wands to get lol
---
Shoulda dropped some Jakey Paul references in there to sweeten the deal
---
Have we not all resorted to raptor striking the last couple mobs for that one quest before you go to town to restock and turn in
---
Hello man. Version 1.1.5 now have the `/todo add {message}` command!!
---
Yeah I‚Äôve given lowbies all kinds of stuff with no response, u dan still be thankful or say no thanks if it‚Äôs an alt
---
They kill lowibes because that‚Äôs the only thing they can actually kill.
---
That‚Äôs what I do! It was fine but I decided to take a 10min break to make some food. Well sometimes WoW randomly d/c‚Äôs me and if I‚Äôm not there to immediately log back in then I‚Äôm fucked. That‚Äôs what happened to me tonight.. and now I can‚Äôt play til tomorrow! Woohoo!
---
Except we did wipe... That's the problem... These dps wanted to AoE spam and it wiped us lol
---
Doesn‚Äôt it go straight there without any connecting flightmasters?
---
yeah literally the game has always worked that way you need the item than roll for it .
---
Fuck off with all these bullshit rules about reserving items if i want that item i will roll on it .
---
Lots of people getting a cold hard lesson in capitalism at auctions lol
---
Same boat as you, rolled an undead mage in vanilla, I'm a gnome mage in classic.
---
I miss horde territory, quests and environment so much that I think of rerolling every now and then.
---
But it's really nice getting to know the other side, doing all the quests that you never got a chance to do, seeing all the NPC's that you would otherwise never get a chance to see.
---
Once upon a time, before they were called the eastern kingdoms, the ancient races called that continent "Azeroth"
---
I was in that situation and to get over it I made a opposite faction toon and came to an agreement with friends of when we would play. Days i didnt play with them I leveled my other toon.
---
Take this upvote you dirty dog.
---
it's like, right on the border, so easily missed
---
I understood it, but a /s at the end will help others who don't.
---
Try the item restore function
---
I shift the movement binding one to the right, so ESDF as opposed to WASD and WR for my strafe. I keep my main rotation abilities bound to 1-5, opener on 1, aoe on 5, fill in the rest in between. Any cooldowns get bound to the letters surrounding my movement keys, generally G is my movement and Y is my interrupt, while Q and T are damage cooldowns or utility. Its the kind of thing you'll build your own layout style over the course of time until you have a general idea where an ability is no matter what alt you're on.
---
Killing beasts gives you skinning opportunities, but protip... there are some "humanoid" enemies that drop money, high silver value junk items, and can also be skinned. Worgen and yetis are the best mobs to grind for this reason, you get to double dip on the profits.
---
As someone who also just started in classic and on a PVP server for the first time my experience has been... that just like everything else people love drama and to blow things out of proportion. First off if I had to pull a number out of my ass I would say 9/10 opposite faction encounters that have wide level disparity‚Äôs simply wave at each other when passing by, secondly you are never going to be the only person from your faction in the zone. Should you be unlucky enough to encounter one of these mythical ‚Äúassholes‚Äù, simply get on general or defense chat and put out a call for help, it will be answered (for the Horde and all that). 
---
Lastly the term ‚Äúganking‚Äù is overblown in itself. The first time I died in world PVP I was quite surprised there were absolutely zero consequences other than having to corpse walk, I mean you can even loot your kills bag... and in a game that is all about the grind, the time lost from said corpse walking due to pvp death is insignificant. 
---
I mean... I don‚Äôt go around whacking lowbies on the reg because honor and all that, but again really, who cares? Get the duck outta here with your safe spaces, that‚Äôs quite literally what PVE servers are for. 
---
To say things like people are admitting they‚Äôre a failure at the game just because they decided to swat down your insignificant toon because you were unlucky enough to cross paths on the way to their next quest is frankly, embarrassing.
---
I don't make most quest reward recipes cause they are all too complicated and not worth it to make. They just remind me of the awful grind I did to get them.
---
Zug Zug
---
it 100p works in classic. I play a priest. I'll link one of my healing macroes.
---
&gt;\#showtooltip  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;/cancelaura Blue Skeletal Horse;  
---
&gt;/cancelaura Shadowform;  
---
&gt;/cast \[@mouseover,help,nodead\]\[help,nodead\]\[@player\] Heal
---
So this macro will do a few things.
---
If i dont have a target it heals myself. If i have a player target it heals him. If i mouseover anyone it heals the mouseover (even if i have another target). It also dismounts me and cancels shadowform if i have it on.
---
You can use this and add your own mount name, perhaps cancel ghost wolf or cheetah depending on your class. Just change the "Heal" at the end with whatever ability you have. ;)
---
PvE server so PvP would not be a factor for me or others in that area. It just seems like people are disinterested, or I suspect it's more likely a combination of they don't even know it exists and once Darkshore is done people just go to the other continent for quests and Deadmines and Stockades and stuff. BFD is disproportionately unpopular. Some dungeons have "reasons" but I really suspect it boils down to just getting skipped over. Stockades around the same general level has a ridiculously easy layout and is extremely close to a bank / major city in contrast to BFD being a bit out of way of inns/flight paths/banks.
---
I'd love to participate in chat and talk to people and maybe trade but according to Blizzard i'm somehow a starter edition account?
---

I haven‚Äôt noticed it impact combo points, maybe it doesn‚Äôt actually target them..?
---
Doesn‚Äôt work in group/raid just strangers which is nice.
---
Try being less aggressive when you murder them so their bodies stay intact
---
My problem is the questing zones. If I'm level 30 - 40, where do I level? Do I level in STV, and face a PvP fest, or do I travel to Arathi where the quests are very spread out?
---
Ah interesting, I usually just hit my assist keybind for that
---
Un'goro is great when it's raining, it really feels like a busy jungle.
---
You can barely see anything, Devilsaurs sneak up on your ass without you noticing, and it feels muggy.
---
Losing*
---
Don't get me wrong, I agree with the sentiment.  That said, the dude in the video straight up snatched those mobs, not cool.
---
Yes sir, I noticed this immediately going into brd, taking way too much damage, and without a weapon chain the disarms from the dwarves is game breaking! 
---
Fury/prot i feel like is the exception. You are relying on damage output in a short period of time, and with better than average gear to burn down a boss quickly. High damage, and good gear, used to out throttle the other dps to Tun and burn. More or less when you get into farming/speed clearing raids.
---
‚ù§Ô∏è you‚Äôre the best thank you!
---
Maybe before doing a run with a group, discuss the loot rules before the first pull so nobody has anything to be concerned about afterwards. You'll have nobody to blame but yourself if you fuck up a roll.
---
I really like how you think tanking takes any brainpower at all.
---
Thats fucking adorable and no just because tour the tank and party leader dows not mean you can take any item you like.
---
Try doing the dungeon with 1 tank and healer and 0 dps i bet you would be crying for the dps to come hwlp you .
---
What a ungratful selfish prick all people  like you care  about is yourself.
---
Yeah that's the way servers always start out, as more people get higher and are building up more gold the prices will go up.
---
The pallys gonna fuck'em
---
its all goods if i cared id have edited that in long time ago
---
&gt; And unlike you, I don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre AFK or busy fighting a mob 
---
I don't do either of those things. I just attack anyone I see afk.
---
Sounds like you mad
---
You can recover deleted items if you log onto the website and go through the restoration processes
---
I‚Äôm horde and fish in feralis fine
---
Logged in at 6:15 server time. 1:15 later, still 1,750 in queue.

Y u do dis?

37 Frost Mage, almost 38. 
---
What would be the better choice for me right now, AOE grinding or joining a cleave group to farm SM? Right now I feel a little weak and the mobs I have tried to farm solo often end up in me dying, running out of mana or there's other people who show up. Layering isn't an option because I'm on a lower populated realm nor do I want to mess with that sort of thing.
---
Get the eye poker it‚Äôs a quest wand that does great damage
---
Thanks, I'm already level 32, so I think I will respec tomorrow. Doubtful I'll afford mount on 40 anyway.
---
I saw that there's a good wand dropping in the Scarlet Monastery, so might have to try getting there as well!
---
Why would they stop transfers when these servers are still so full? Arcanite Reaper is dead as fuck
---
The people complaining just need to get to max level, but an apb out for the guy that camped you, then camp him.
---
For the future, if you're the kind of person that doesn't ninja, ever, like wouldn't consider it, it's your job to be the very last person to roll on an item.  You wait it out until the kid can't stand it anymore and rolls.  He'll tip his hand eventually.  If the bad ones have the patience to wait until everyone else has rolled, the good ones have to do the same.
---
Moonglade trainer cost more to train druid abilities than other factions based on rep? You sure?
---
oh yeah. therell always be shitty players.
---
If I knew that the people I killed cried on reddit like you all, I'd actually go out of my way to kill and camp low levels.  As of right now, I don't really mess with them, but the way you kids are crying about this shit is hilarious.
---
Resist
---
It's a good comparison.  A mage comes to do damage, do you usually buy your food or drinks from him?  Everyone has utility.  It costs the mage nothing but time, same with the rogue.  If anything the plate wearing tank that needs to repair after keeping you safe should get the most consideration but no one cares about him either.  Rogues don't get special treatment when no other class does for the utility they bring.
---
Who hurt you?
---
&gt;the other is the ridiculous respec costs.  OK, I get it, we don't want people changing spec every five minutes but if you're a healer, good luck trying to do anything in the open world in healer spec.
---
I disagree that heal spec isn't viable in open world.  It's less efficient, but it's still viable.  This is kind of like the raid spec argument people make; you're conflating 'optimal' and 'viable' and they're separate things.  I was a resto shaman in Vanila and I could still do most everything that I could have as enhance and probably more than I could as elemental.  Not as quickly or easily in some cases, but the choice of spec did impact my play experience without making it impossible to do relevant content.  It was a meaningful choice without being overly restrictive.
---
That's really important, because a choice without meaningful consequences doesn't add anything to the game.  Modern talent trees are pretty equal, functionally, for all content, no matter what talents you choose, and I think it's widely considered to be pretty awful.
---
Crazy I know. What's the chances?
---
&gt; 'troll' (im using that word very softly here, it was just done for some fun and didnt really harm anything).
---
Nah, you're just using it correctly. The term trolling comes from the fishing method of the same name, it's always just been people putting bait out there and seeing if anybody bites. But of course the media completely misunderstood what trolling was, began using the term to mean targeted harrassment and now here we are.
---
Thank you. The path from UC to Hammerfall in Arathi is ridiculous. Holy crap bat, you can fly, just go OVER the mountains
---
I play frost mage but don't run the AoE spec. Not a fan of the play style. Would rather level sub-optimally if it means I actually get to enjoy myself.
---
My problem is no one wants to ever fight back and it sucks.. all I ask is if you‚Äôre in a pvp server fight back when a place is over run by the opposite faction.
---
Some of you tell me to open a ticket but I own my mistakes...then why post lmao. Probably didn‚Äôt even have the item. Don‚Äôt get upset at people giving you advise my man. Open a ticket and get the item restored because if they didn‚Äôt do it then it wouldn‚Äôt e an option.
---
Just asking, what would you use instead then?
---
I would need and then leave the group.
---
Even if my claas cant  use the item i actually  hate cunrs like this.
---
I would rather a ninja looter than an entitled prick claiming items like that seriously.
---
Atleast the ninja looter is not entitles and knows hes doing something wrong..
---
As far as I'm concerned, if someone's hogging all the mobs in an area and expects everyone else to wait till they're finished to be able to quest or kill them, it's sure as hell justified to steal mobs.
---
Pure DPS is a dime a dozen. You want to talk about brainpower, proofread your shit before the next time you comment.
---
Oh so that's where it is... Thanks!
---
Time to head to Barrens
---
Many sources. In one of the gnostic scriptures jesus explains the nature of gods as being "only heads" that is mental drives and desires. He goes on to say that the "bodies" of gods are given to them by men, or in other words the shapes they take are for the purpose of interaction with humans. The same applies to demons since they're the same thing in nature with slight differences. The key of Solomon discusses the drives of angels and demons, demons having particular tastes for material and practical things whereas angels are more concerned with spiritual and theoretical ones. There is a ton of other sources of info on them. I believe the corpus maleficarum has a section on sex demons. Even the names imply roughly the intent of the demon, incubus means to lie or press upon. Succubi is to lay beneath. So you can see from the names they're primarily referenced by the type of acts they engage in not the shape which they take.
---
QoL isn't the devil.
---
Autoloot without holding shift was not in Vanilla, but is now a thing in Classic and the game is better for it. Most things everyone uses add-ons for (like aura timers and cast bars) probably should be in the game as settings.
---
Games put artificial road blocks in your path, Blizz's problem has been implementing QoL that reduces those bumps, instead of focusing on helping you easily understand the bumps and act out your plan over them.
---
Horde only?
---
I prefer loot council in ways, provided the loot council is trustworthy.
---
‚ÄúThis is Ghost Rider, requesting permission for a flyby.‚Äù

Three things to improve retail:

Remove LFR
---
my bad dude
---
Sure it's just a game. Strip it away even further, and for most players it's basically just an endless sequence of players interacting with each other (with some optional monster killing, crafting, and walking, etc in between). 
---
And when you put a player into a game like wow, where there are endless things to do, and they choose to inflict the maximum grief possible to other people over an over every time they log in, that doesn't seem weird to you? Honestly try to step back from the context of the game for a second and think about it.
---
As a horde player on Benediction I think its almost an even split. Hillsbrad has a horde raid group in it almost every night.
---
I did that cause the tank was being a bitch tonight lmao he‚Äôs a long time friend so isallgoood just a little salty for a minute
---
Lol wish they hadn't deleted what they said.  Could of gone either way.
---
Why not just leave yourself and let them decide if they want to replace your fragile ass
---
We‚Äôre at war m8

So they can level the weapon skill while minimizing DPS loss?

its so rare that ive joined a group already being made. i almost always start my own groups and i never seem to have any of these problems everyone complains about.
---
&gt; Thanks, I'm already level 32, so I think I will respec tomorrow. Doubtful I'll afford mount on 40 anyway.
---
Don't worry too much about getting a mount right at 40, I only got mine at 42 and had something like 20g~ by the time I hit 40. 
---
The more you level up, the easier it is to get gold so you'll find that it's not an impossible task.
---
&gt;I saw that there's a good wand dropping in the Scarlet Monastery, so might have to try getting there as well!
---
Yeah, anything with high DPS will add up, throw a few DoTs and just sit back with the wand and most mobs will go down pretty quickly.
---
I followed a guy for a solid minute so I could buff him in return, he didn't notice my yelling at him to slow down lol.
---
The pointless things I do in this game are often the most fun and memorable.
---
BC and wrath appeal way more to me. Most of the final talents feel pointless in classic and take away from the feeling of investing into something over time. Felt way more rewarding topping off demo lock with a fel guard as opposed to soul link.
---
its ok alliance scum
---
If you just subscribed it can take a couple hours for it to kick in and let you start doing all the things a "full" account can do.
---
In the later days of vanilla I single handedly dropped the price of copper on my server by constantly putting it up for several silver less than whatever it happened to be at. After a 3 or 3 days of just mining and selling it, others started to undercut me, and it eventually fell from bonkers, only alts could afford it to something newer players could at least consider. Really felt like getting one over on the Chinese botters, even if I was completely wrong, it felt great.
---
Eyes of the beast Redridgeboss. Fuck that guy, he would do it for literally 10 hours straight. What a sad life.
---
ANOTHER TURTLE MADE IT TO THE WATER.

Anyone who thinks there was loot reservations in vanilla is an idiot.

Thwy sot there and claim retail kiddies donr like the reservations in classic.

Bro your playing classic like bfa not my fault you dont understand the need and greed roles.

The top responses all say that you‚Äôre going to be camped a bit if you roll on a PvP server.  That‚Äôs true and it‚Äôs not a big deal.  I don‚Äôt understand your point
---
&gt;I started playing on a PVP Realm in Classic for the first time... ever in WoW, and I've been learning that people who gank lowbies are basically admitting to the world they are shit at the game. So try to take it with a grain of salt; ganking lowbies is just an admittance of weakness and failure.
---
Some druid killed me when I was 20% then I came back and I rekt him and his friend at full hp and I know shit about pvping, a guy that is good at pvp would prever a challenge and not wasting his time on one shotting noobs.
---
Mages are my top most hated class to bump into lvling. They never want to group up and just take all the mobs. While you trying to kill one at a time they pulling 5 or 6. Then when they die those mobs decide to fuck up anyone else nearby. Mages players are just rude in general i find.

You don‚Äôt understand that a layering system does not work with how the original game was meant to be played. Whether you are in the open world abusing layering for nodes or instance layering for loot, it‚Äôs not apart of the original gameplay or philosophy. I‚Äôll leave you with one last thing to consider, but I‚Äôll allow you to find the answer. What is the one thing they did not allow players to openly test in the beta?
---
Ah well... it‚Äôs no use I‚Äôm talking to someone that thinks vanilla tastes like cherries.

‚ÄúAll these mobs here are mine to AOE farm, no one else come here and take these mobs‚Äù

---
Is that ulduar? I can't even tell
---
I bet I could pull agro off you with a single shadow bolt! Frustrating as it may seem unless you are in higher level dungeons or raids it‚Äôs not the end all be all for dps to pull threat and face tank. Shorty and annoying for the tank and healer yes but not game breaking.
---
Think you are just bad at healing bro. I'm an hpal and have zero issues healing any group.
---
How do you get your character picture beside health and mana?
---
This has only come up for me twice, either I was the only rogue or won the roll against another rogue to open. I asked group if they needed anything from the chest. Both times were just food/water stuff or green items though, nothing rare or special. But I try to be a team player best I can, can't speak for other rogues.

You sound just like my edgy teenager son ;)

Can anyone apart from mages give a good argument for why mage aoe shouldn‚Äôt be needed? 
---
I get the whole no changes shit but god, I played this imbalanced mess for years now. How good would it be if, oh I don‚Äôt know, one class didn‚Äôt dominate by a huge margin over every other class? 
---
Salty Mages don‚Äôt @ me.
---
I meant the SM chat not the LFG chat. Obviously there aren't as many in LFG as the group looking for SM happens in SM because so many people are running it a lot. When I went to SM there were 2 spellcleave lfg's and 10 other LFGs. the spellcleave ones made for half the traffic.
---
This would look REALLY good with the Consoleport addon and controller.. Been trying Xbox One controller

Do you think you have enough time to level both to 60 though?

TBH heartseeker wouldn‚Äôt be bad if people just switched. Let the 60s and other high levels stay and people lower than 30 switch. Nobody should have to wait 3 hours to play a game that has a sub. What faction are you btw?

There are ways to work around that issue with the use of "clever" game mechanics, have been possible since Cata.

No dude. It goes both ways. Whoever tags the mob first wins. Its that simple.

That thought always creeps back doesn't it. Usually when you see the Horde or Horde zones :) It is nice to see the areas I have never done any questing in before for me too.
---
&gt; It is a pretty classic graph theory problem in that you have nodes (flightpath destinations) that connect in certain ways and computing the optimal route is a trivial exercise (it‚Äôs actually a good example of the classic NP hard traveling salesman problem with restrictions in that you can only traverse the graph in certain ways but the size of the graph is so small it‚Äôs easily solvable once you have the data).
---
Nerd alert.
---
I love you. Please do this.
---
For what it's worth, I'm logging daily price changes on certain items to document the evolution and development of a new-server economy. I wish I'd done this back in 2005, as Classic's mats prices are already affected by our knowledge of what will become valuable in the future (AQ turnins, etc.)
---
Never watch the flight, tab out and check in when you feel like it, tab even if you're afk
---
You'll cook it once they release the smell-o-vision.
---
I sided with the scum, so I can watch them endlessly and slowly kill hordies. It's actually quite the show. Just pull up your profession menu and start crafting while they auto attack your foes to death!
---
I don't get it.
---
in 2 or 3 months would 1000 be extreme? Ive seen players with over 2k already I think for the right person they would pay that for sure
---
Sorry I forgot to state this but I play on Remulos which is a Oceania server!
---
You're right, things start ramping up in Brd and i cant use this as often or I'll only use it as a finisher for extra dps when I'm topped off on hp. Essentially I'm just reiterating Skarms same opener he uses with fury/prot build and applying it to tanking while leveling with arms. You could do the same while lvling as fury just change your swap macro to your dual 1hers. Until youre higher lvl or still need some pieces from brd at 60 id stick to the main tanking rythm, but by then most dps should know what they're doing or you should have a set group/guild that understands threat.
---
Thank you for admitting your low IQ.
---
Ehh, I have a 52 mage on Incendius alliance and a 43 of Faerlina horde. Yes, everything's pretty crowded, but respawn rates are high and you can usually find a layer where you have at least an spot. I don't think it's that awful unless you want a totally empty server.
---
Just start a horde character that you just play by yourself, and the alliance character when your friends are on
---
Except FoM right now is DW tanking.  You've got warriors taking Onyxia Tooth Pendant over Onyxia Blood Talisman for greater TPS.  So people aren't really using Shield Block anyway.
---
Which, personally, not a fan.  I'm good with throwing on a Lionheart Helm and maybe a few pieces of plate DPS gear, but I enjoy playing more as deep Prot than as a Fury warrior.  Maybe it's not optimal, but it's what I like.  And playing Ally side, I've never actually had an issue with threat capping even the Fury warriors; Blessing of Salvation makes up the difference just fine.
---
&gt; Just fly one town at a time.
---
This used to be mandatory.
---
honestly I still don't think it is funny.
---
If DPS are not listening or constantly pulling before you, whisper the healer and tell them not to heal the dps.
---
Let the dps die then kill the rest of the mobs.
---
Tell them to run back to the instance as punishment for pulling.
---
If its a group that is a guild and you are the lone one out, just refuse to tank anymore and pull some mobs then leave.
---
If your expectations are people asking nicely in this game you're going to dissappointed.  Those days of gaming are long gone and will never come back.  People are worse to each today in this subculture than they have ever been and no matter what you will not change it.
---
All you can do is be a decent person yourself and expect that of yourself and expect the absolute worst at all times from modern "gamers" and you won't be dissappointed.
---
You might not like what I just posted but it's the truth.  It's going to get worse and all you can control in this is your own actions.
---
To the OP, that's how I act in game giving people the benefit of the doubt if they make a mistake and am never nasty to anyone for any reason.  Had a guy whisper me today "you fucking black person", didn't say a word back to him just put him on ignore.  My skin is thick as all hell after 15 years of this community and how it's devolved along with the modern "gamer" attitude and you're right, and it would be awesome if people were like this to one another but it's not going to happen.  Not with today's culture and today's kids it's a lost cause.  People new to this game are going to have to suck it up if they want to endure, just like all of us did when we were new.  Albeit people then didn't just absolutely suck as hard as they do now in terms of their humanity to one another, or lack thereof, we still had to deal with asshats all day.  Blizzard games are famous for their aberrant communities.  In fact, Blizzard gamers as a whole are one of the reasons toxicity spread so deeply among the subculture.
---
Woosh
---
Could this work for retail?
---
&gt;Coefficients scale with level much more dynamically than that.
---
No they dont
---
I was in the same situation back in the day. I originally wanted to be alliance but ended up rolling a troll shaman because my friends were horde. I never really liked de aesthetic and would love it when Halloween would come around and I could put on a human costume.  Now that classic is here I‚Äôve rolled alliance now. I do miss sitting on top of of the Orgrimmar bank but that is about it, and now that I‚Äôm finally getting to play as alliance it‚Äôs this sensation not so much of nostalgia but of getting to play the game like it were the first time.
---
I have an IQ of 70 or so. Seems like a passing grade to me, so I'm happy.

You get it next to the succubus quest in barrens

That's why I like retail's leveling. There's a kobold mine over there? Kill 12 kobold miners, 4 kobold overseers, gather 8 lumps of coal and bring back their leader's ear. There's no annoying back and forth. 
---
Of course, it's not perfect but I definitely think it's an improvement over classic. It's a shame it goes by so quickly in retail.
---
Awesome dude :) feel free to add me trilogyxo I play on Remulos in Oceania!
---
Blizzard has repeatedly stated they will not be doing cross realms for classic.  We also aren't sure what'll happen after phase 6 as they might do classic+ and go a completely different route thus making it a completely different path.
---
exactly that.
---
This place is a zoo
---
Double gathering professions is always a good idea. The crafting professions are a known gold sink, and while some have insanely good endgame rewards, they‚Äôre gold sinks. 
---
Brokest person in my vanilla guild was an incredibly well-played Mage, but he was obsessed with tailoring and enchanting patterns. Nothing empties pockets faster than enchanting, especially in classic.
---
It better be called Listie or I'm not installing it. 
---
Who am I kidding...I would install this in a heartbeat.

Which is why you should hydrate IRL while hydrating in-game.

Just on the edge of mauradon, Nothing since has even slightly made me think "Big scary bossfight" compared to verdant.

That was old blades. On the FAQ it says that these blades are not server specific with the way the realm crossover stuff works. 
---
"¬† Q: Will I be able to purchase a specific server blade?
---
A: Due to advancements in the technology behind World of Warcraft and the ability to host many realms on one blade, there‚Äôs no way to guarantee purchasers will receive a server blade that previously hosted a specific realm they were interested in."

Try to contact blizzard support through the website, might help kick it in faster.

When I played the AH, I rarely did buyouts. That said, I was addicted to flipping the AH and spent hours upon hours just buying and selling. Back when they were new content, I bought a hexweave bag for 1 copper. And there‚Äôs plenty of others..far too many to remember, where people put an extremely low bid, so even if you don‚Äôt get all the items you bid on, the ones you do get you make a ton of gold on.

Not good for things you need atm, but definitely a way to save a lot of money if you can wait a few hours.

[Recent discussion](https://twitter.com/SirCosmicBacon/status/1174054349842112512) suggests that +hit% might also be a buff. No conclusive evidence has been shown, but it's clear from the Twitch clip that something is up.

He's the thing about AoE grinding a dungeon. A tank is nearly useless in these situations. There's no way they can hold aggro and shouldn't be expected to do so. Bad AoE groups are bad but for a proper group the xp/hr can't be beat.
---
Yea that's fair, and there nothing wrong with running instances to level. I did my fair share of that in Vanilla. But I suppose the difference between that and retail is that you actually have to physically get to the instance and "experience" the world somewhat
---

Because its stupid, i play mage because its fun, but all party's want me to "hey want zf aoe farming, hey want sm cath aoe farming" block like 20 ppl per day (pd: im using ST arcane/frost build)
---
When you say struggle are you exaggerating? Granted I‚Äôm only 27 and can‚Äôt remember how it was at higher levels, but I kill same level mobs just fine.
---
Good point. I guess the only issue is that you can't transfer any handy items to your alt !
---
In theory, nobody actually needed to buy the game twice and Blizzard only convinced people to come back and resub. Reality is I had no chance resubbing my original account, I can't begin to even guess what stupid ass Hotmail address I was using 14 years ago.
---
Yeah, this is true, and although you can turn whispers off for that tab (which makes organising a group near impossible), you can not turn off the flashing tab for whispers.
---
I forgot to put a flair so it got automatically removed :P
---
Bro he‚Äôs bigger than your computer haha
---
And then while you kill the first one that spawns, the rest come in and the mage rides past you to pull them all yet again. One kill per 15 minutes is totally cool right?
---
Save the turtles fym
---
"Dude stop crying"! Good sir will you please take the time to reconsider my tone in my text? I am not trying to come off as crying but just a concerned player for a clear mechanic that needs tuning.

Check Dev vlogs addressing the issue on unbalanced inconsistency in pvp where they directly address fears on warlocks, as I cannot post links.
---
They got close to the shittiest loot Onyxia can possibly drop.
---
And cut to these current crop of low characters getting ganked hitting 60 and being bored and I bet quite afew of them will head to STV and do some ganking of their own.
---
Man, do you know how often I'm killed by "fill in the blank" class and they're a skull to me. Their emotes really rub in their effort.
---
You're seriously suggesting 500% mount speed?
---
This post is literally someone whining and causing another player to die because they tagged *some* of their AoE farmed mobs.
---
They are both bugs that happened to be exploited.
---
As I mentioned an exploit isn't a type of flaw. An exploit is simply something that is used in an unintended way and exploited for some kind of gain.
---
So wholesome.
---
ü§ì
---
Sure, though the default listing mechanics aren't great anyways. It seems awfully easy to "game" visibility on the default listing stuff, whereas Auctionator (even if it CONTRIBUTES to this problem to some extent) can cut through the crap and list the actual cheapest items, as well as their stack quantity.
---
Had a questionable one last night. I see black lotus surrounded by a bunch of elite dragons, decide to clear it instead of running in and fearing them. Pull one away, then someone else comes in and starts fighting another right next to the herb. I quickly finish my mob and loot the herb while he's still fighting. Hope he didn't think I was the jerk that steals other's nodes..
---
Or be like Ninja...Die, Cry, Quit
---
Ikr lmao. If people are playing a way you don't want to play.. just don't play with them..leave the group if it's so bad.
---
Aoe clearing is extremely efficient, and it's understandable why people would play that way. They're entitled to play however they want, as you are entitled to just not play with them.
---
It would be the other way around, because most Alliance players on Hillsbrad are 7-10 levels higher than the average Horde player questing in the zone, most people getting ganked are Horde from levels 20-28.
---
Such skill, good job
---
Yeah, I don't let DPS warriors in my groups.  "I don't have a 1h." Well, not my fault you're bad.  "1h isn't leveled."  Buddy, I'm an Arms warrior too, I do everything with my giant axe, including 90% of my tanking.  I still keep my 1h skill (for whatever 1h I'm currently carrying) topped off and a 1h and a shield in my bags for those hard hitting bosses or bad healers. "I don't know how to tank."  Leveling dungeons are exactly the place to learn.  Even if you're Fury for raiding, you're going to be called on to OT stuff from time to time, and when your guild gets into Naxx, chances are you're tanking 4H because no guild wants to gear up 8 dedicated tanks.  That's a lot of dead weight for every previous raid and encounter.
---
If you're going to let your friends and groupmates wait an hour to find a tank because you can't be bothered to learn your class, I REALLY don't want to be stuck with you in an instance for an hour.
---
Yeah. I don‚Äôt like this set either. I just posted to be faithful to the series.

To find her alive you have to glitch into the Caverns of Time and fight through a special instance with a 5-man group to get warped back in time 2 days to get to the Barrens before the Quillboar kill her. Then you have to kill her.
---
Havent subbed since MoP and they got me back with classic.
---
it does! I have released a retail version
---
Depends on what you mean by completely random. As far as I'm aware, when generating a name it picks a random first half from a big table of prefixes (In this case Thoo) and then does the same for the end (num/ nom). So you're never going to get pure gibberish but you're given a name completely randomly.
---
Yeah I like to think I'm pretty good at pvp. I reached a 2000 rating in MoP when I got fairly serious. That doesn't change the fact that I like one shotting the opposite faction. I also don't mind helping the opposite faction. I attacked a full health shaman on my ally mage. I think he was two levela below me, and I was clearly winning, so I sheeped him and /bowed. He thanked me and we parted ways.
---
I always do a /laugh then cannibalize.
---
Feels good to not be the only person running with this set up. Minus that cat, I‚Äôve got 2 puppers
---
Intellect doesn't provide flat damage. It provides a very small amount of crit (something like 50 int = 1% crit). Always go for spell damage, but of course if it's something like 20 int and 20 frost vs 0 int and 22 frost, the 20 int giving extra mana will be the better option.

Me and an undead rogue did the elite ogre quest at Stromgarde Keep together. We would take turns tagging mobs and we did that for a solid 15 minutes. God I love pvp servers, they create such amazing dynamics. One moment I want to kill every horde I see, the next moment I‚Äôm helping them out. 
---
One thing I like to do when I see a low level horde struggling is to enter prowl next to him, and to then finish off the mob he is fighting while he‚Äôs panicking.
---
Could this be a EU only thing due to that law that was passed? GDPR I think it was...
---
Anyway, I'll take a look at this in the morning and see if I can check mine out for NA
---
Go to Darnassus and train thrown, buy a stack of throwing knives or axes and you are good to go, better than having a bow or gun and having to carry ammo in your bags.
---
u/RhysHarp, don't mind this dude. He's just a troll
---
Sure they do, y'know how much money is in that donation tray?
---
Sounds like something Alliance would do.
---
If it was Horde it would only be level 60s. Likely 3 of them. And they would sit on your corpse for up to 2 hours.
---
Frost damage will be applied with a coefficient unique for each spell. Frost bolt is high, around 80% of +dmg. Frost nova is low, around 15%. Frost damage and  any spell damage is usually priority.
---
Intellect never gives +dmg.
---
I was a pally healer and I was good. I saved the group from wiping several times, had no mana issues and never drew aggro to myself. But when the tank pulls 10 enemies and then 3 of them attack the mage and warlock it becomes a problem. AoE spam is garbage and I don't get how this ever became a thing
---
Can u throw a link for it?
---
&gt; They are both bugs that happened to be exploited.
---
Yeah and that was my initial perspective on the situation when I asked at the top of this comment chain why Blizzard is banning the ones who abused layer swapping but not the ones who abused the unintentional XP gains in raids. We have come full circle now lol.
---
I don't mind getting ganked, it's part of the game. I do however get pretty salty when I get gangbanged and camped for a half hour because the other fraction is bored.  Not salty enough to write a post about it though.
---
I walked up to an afk dwarf named turdeater and waited for him to come back. I told him his name is great and he said that my name was great too, since it‚Äôs Farrt. Farrt and Turdeater, two dirty dwarves together forever.

Which do you think is better?
---
corrupted ashbringer was yea?
---
What if you were just about to start and then he wanted in? Would you have kicked the rando for your guild mate?
---
Lol
---
I‚Äôve played both. I still think the Alliance has the prettiest cities, gear looks best on their models, and paladins are wonderful in groups.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 11 how do I get there
---
Ya, I‚Äôm sick of grinding in your mothers basement.
---
I‚Äôm only a 18 Warrior right now. I took Mining and Skinning. The skinning is cool. Wander around and skin everyone‚Äôs kills they leave behind. Then simply vender huge amounts of leather. 
---
Mining I‚Äôm finding to be decent after the smelt. I thought people would want the ore itself. But wasn‚Äôt moving on AH. I put bars up and presto they are gone within a couple hours. 
---
I just keep forgetting in Vanilla you can tap the same mining mode multiple times.

When I used to play classic, my only friend in game was a guy about 10 lvls higher than me that helped sometimes. I mostly played alone, determined to catch up. I developed my own sense of honour, I would fight alliance sometimes, I fended off people who tried to take advantage and had the odd duel ending in a /bow next time we met but didn't really like taking advantage of weakened foes myself.
---
Then one day my friend just says "come with" and we travel to somewhere where we spend a while running around the map before I realise he is solely tracking (he was a hunter) and killing low level alliance. It was just something he did from time to time for no gain and i just didn't get it. He wasn't a bad player and he played battlegrounds a lot and was better than me.
---
I think some people just seriously lack empathy or something lol. I know it's just a game but if I spent that much time a day just killing people who don't stand a chance, I would feel shame.
---
Alliance. Thought mine was added in Cata but might have misread Wowhead.
---
ok did you have a question?
---
both are great in pvp
---
Herb is better in high end and come a month from now when more people hit 60 and need raid mats etc.
---
Mining is better now, because it goes for engineering/blacksmithing which is more common while leveling.
---
Can you give soulstones? Shit.
---
if it was a person of the opposite faction you're right they goofed.  The proper move is to kill the person then take the node
---
I mean, out of all the content on this sub, that artists posting Classic WoW OC should be one of the least annoying things.
---
Yes they literally are. They literally forced me to be apart of this AoE spam. That's the problem! It was a normal run and then halfway through they said "let's aoe spam". How the fuck is that fair to anyone else? Plot twist, it's the aoe spam players who tell others how to play. Hypocrites
---
" Its just funny because 1. you cant even spell rogue and 2. you expect rogues to be able to face-roll warlocks without using stealth. "
---
The structure of your entire sentence is wrong, yet you try to grammatically correct me. I have a condition called dyslexia which affects my ability to spell/ perceive words. So I am sorry if I mentally stumbled on my condition while questing, and killing mobs in WoW. (World of Warcraft)
---
And Clearly I stated that a rouge WOULD NOT face-roll a warlock unless in stealth.
---
Stop debating with yourself. The grass is always greener on the other side.
---
I‚Äôve always had a chip on my shoulder for Horde players, but Classic is only confirming to me that all Hordies are honorless douche nuggets. Ganking AFKs, lowbies, low HP levellers fighting mobs, never a fair crack just underhanded cowards who zug zug and flee at the first sign of trouble.
---
Know this.
---
I‚Äôm gonna ram my holy hammer up your keister so hard that you shatter from the sonic boom.
---
I will hunt you scumbag "honorable warriors" down forever.
---
For the Horde. Psssh. You will beg for honor and it will forsake you and I will dance on your corpse.
---
Signed,
---
A vengeful human with a bangin‚Äô black mustache.
---
On Incendius as well.  Everyone I passed was fine when I first hit the zone.. then I got to the murlocs.  It was a war zone and I spent more time killing alliance than I did murlocs.  That quest took me like 5 hours.
---
And lol later I finished the quest where I ressurect the guy from his grave inside that south river city and he rekt all the alliance there for like 25 mins.  Man that felt great.
---
Where is killerduki
---
I'm on a horde skewed server and I find that it just depends, sometimes a quest spot is filled with alliance, sometimes it's horde. But I always have fun with the pvp. Tonight it was tanaris at the pirate spot, lots of alliance, id sneak in and kill a straggler then levitate and run out onto the ocean. Had a blast.
---
Do you guys not have planes?
---
Azeroth is flat! Just look at the flight paths!
---
I was once called out in Barrens chat unironically for ganking an AFK Alliance mage in Ratchet. It's a PVP server and the guy has the audacity to go AFK in Horde territory and I'm a douche apparently?
---
That only makes it stronger!
---
Or maybe don't force others to AoE spam... If u want to aoe spam, make a fucking group for it. Don't join another group doing a normal run and then berate the tank about pulling huge groups so u can aoe it. Take your own fucking advice buddy
---
Nothing says love like mark + thorns + regrowth to a random warrior/rogue struggling away.
---
I don‚Äôt even fault that as much. You‚Äôre 60 in Classic and not raiding right then? Sure, I get it. Not a hell of a lot else going on right now. 
---
It‚Äôs the level 40 people that are going out of their way to camp lower level people. Like... you‚Äôve got TWENTY levels to cap. You‚Äôve got actual productive things you can be doing. But no, instead you decide to waste time making other levelers‚Äô lives harder at the same time delaying your own progress. Screw those people...
---
Prisoners dilemma.  If no one undercuts we all sell a little higher, but not as reliably. If one person undercuts they can unload as much inventory as they can at the expense of the other sellers. If everyone undercuts its a race to the bottom and the price craters.
---
If you have a comp to aoe why would you single target lol? That just doesn‚Äôt make sense. If the tanks pulling 3 or more I will always be multi dot then AoE.
---
I‚Äôll probably go mining then, since I‚Äôm guessing as a mage there are better ways to earn money than farming herbs at 60? Or is that wrong.
---
I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, and, AND I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises. You got it?
---
I agree with you somewhat but honestly nothing really comes close to Orc racials.
---
Thought I was alone in this, but kinda happy I'm not alone in the "low effort" bullshit which is incredibly subjective and vague. Had a warrior meme using Conan as the warrior, reacting to facing more than one mob, low effort deleted. Didn't make enough sense without the text so would be misunderstood, my ass haha.
---
I'm also playing fire, I've done frost and arcane before and find them boring. It's awesome that people want to AOE grind, I just don't feel like it this time around.
---
I'm struggling with people not wanting me in their group cause I don't spam AOE lol
---
Ah yes I'm the shitty player cuz the tank pulled 15 enemies and dps couldn't decide which to kill and everyone ran out of mana. Ur so right.
---
I disagree. Evidence: literally every aoe spam group I've been apart of ends in fucking shambles
---
It‚Äôs hardly salty to question why someone made you eat a hot pocket cooked over a campfire.
---
Your comment though basically reads like ‚ÄúHey I wiped my ass with a slice of bread years ago and it tasted like shit when I ate it. Has bread gotten any better?!‚Äù
---
He clearly has too much armor in that fluff to skin. Can you skin a yeti?
---
Camping for five hours is called griefing and used to be a punishable offense in vanilla
---
It was awesome, for sure! Was supposed to a positive story too :p
---
&gt;Nah. How is anyone supposed to know you want to mine it?
---
If they are literally standing on top of it, while fighting something.
---
If you **literally** mine it out from underneath them...
---
That's your hint.
---
Elvui
---
Had this been tested or is this ass crafting theory at work?
---
From someone who just dumped a level 45 warrior on Herod to swap to a lesser queue server, just roll something that can find groups easy. SM farming is still super viable and eats up the 30s and you‚Äôll be back where you started in no time. 
---
Got tired of a queue every time I got home from work.
---
&gt; Sure, we'll remove all of that garbage useless gear. But now all of the gear blurs together into one big forgettable mess because everything is just "main stat + stam + haste/crit/mastery/vers" and it doesn't even matter because higher ilvl = upgrade, most of the time.
---
I hate this wone. I love how sometimes in Classic I am really torn on what to wear. Like, this chest has str and agi which I want, but this one has TONS of spirit and stam which is good too but not the main stat I need...
---
Why are you such an asshole?
---
I can understand someone like RhysHarp, But OPengiun you're a cherished member of the reddit community, This post is for WoW related content, not mean't for slander and the bullying of others. 
---
Please leave my post to WoW related content, and be nice like sheesh. I would hate for a moderator to eat your account over this thread.
---
Or...maybe -- just maybe -- this guy doesn't know how to deal damage.
---
Lol.  On Incendius a 50 alliance druid was in the yeti cave killing any horde that went in.  Started as a funny thing but more and more reports appeared over the hours 
---
Fast forward 10 hours I wake up and hes still there.  People complaining how hes been there all night. Lololol.
---
Dude must have had a bad experience there in his 30s.
---
I cant believe they did mah boy vul'jin like they did.
---
Then those ppl should make a proper group! Not force others to partake in it! I didn't haul my ass all the way to SM as alliance just for a dumb ass mage to screw it all up
---
Thank you! He‚Äôs a nuisance, but the best kind
---
I was raiding retail before classic started. What raids would you use as an example that were hard?
---
Thanks! I hate you!
---
That's just my pet bar. This is all the basic UI. No addons.
---
Dry times aptly sums up my love life since classic released.
---
When classis *was* retail I used to run the swiftthistle market on my server. I was in highschool then waiting on a friend to level when I stumbled on the potential to sell it on my PvP realm. I had a rout memorized in Silvermine and would farm up a couple stacks a night.
---
In the morning before school I would post it for *outrageous* prices, way to high for it to ever move. I noticed that people kept playing the undercut by 1c game. After school I would find pages of swiftthistle riding just under my stupid high prices. I'd then take my auction down, splits the stacks, and then undercut heavily. I still got way more for it than I should have because I was the one to have created an artificial bubble in the market in the first place.

Use your mount and hunt for the schools of fish and floating wreckage. I normally fish this way even when the fishing‚Äôs working correctly. Your limited to oily blackmouth, snappers and eels but all 3 are decent cash, especially if you can make oils. Plus any random stranglekelp and chests you get from those pools. And the floating wreckage is just my favourite to fish. Almost Guaranteed chests and if not some rum for dungeons or kelp for AH.
---
Uhh as a Horde this was by far the worst zone for leveling ganking-wise...
---
I think when you switch main hands it doesn't trigger GCD but when you switch offhand it does.
---
Of course! https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/todochecklister
---
Exactly. Same situation. Had to spam every minutes just to make sure people would see mine because it moved so quick and after 20+ minutes I gave up. 
---
Just wanted a goddamn Deadmines tank.
---
That depends on where you are now. Also you won‚Äôt really be starting dungeons until around 16 or 17.
---
Thanks man! This is something im getting so much use of!!
---
You ain't tho
---
When you hit 60 in Vanilla so you roll another toon
---
Because we didnt have the comp! And guess what? Not everyone likes playing like this! It led to us wiping and the group falling apart! The first runs were perfect normal runs! These aoe spammers are hypocrites! When we say "aoe spam sucks" they say "let ppl play how they want" and then we say "aoe spammers are making me play a way I don't like" u all say "lol u should play that way anyway"
---
I would assume because with the raid xp bug there aren't any bans because you are supposed to be able to enter Dungeons and complete them as a raid.
---
While the layer swap was never intended to work in Dungeons.

Maybe you should have called out specific solutions from the start instead of being a useless crybaby üòÇ why are you so adamant about being stupid?
---
Most melee classes either oneshot locks or they can kick the fear as long as they get in melee. As for ranged mages can cube to remove the dots and then just burst.  Also locks can do much vs any undead player. Unless they catch then during the 1 or 2 min cd
---
Didn't you just make fun of my IQ a little bit ago?
---
Ret pally will do 30-40% less dmg than a rogue.  Its not as bad as everyone says, but you have to put in double the effort to breakdown everyones perceptions.  Be a team player, heal when asked, and dont be greedy for loots.  Nobody wants a high dps player that plays forhimself.  Everyone wants the mediocre dude who puts the guild before them.
---
They say it takes up to 24 hours usually
---
Lmaoooooo
---
This explains why ive had by argent dawn commision buff removed
---
It triggers when I swap main hands as well. It doesn‚Äôt trigger out of combat.
---
Except there's almost always more high level Horde in Hillsbrad than Alliance due to the close proximity of Undercity soooooo... have fun bubble hearthing you coward.
---
I wonder what would push you over the edge to make a post about it
---
Your warriors need a healer to take my shaman down, peasants.
---
Dude Spam their names and the server, these guys need to learn what it means to play classic
---
Also with layering shenanigans there are ample supplies of everything.
---
Leveling as a warrior is not the same as raid DPSing as a warrior.  There is no reason as a leveling warrior (who is not 100% going to be DPSing a dungeon) to forgo armor, save a few slots.  Leveling as a leather fury war is brutal and not recommended, unless you plan to grind mobs 5 levels lower than you.
---
Maybe you should look at the common element of those disasters, namely yourself.
---
I wasnt slandering any conditions. Just pointing out that you have no idea wtf you are talking about.
---
No one is forcing anything on you...are you mental? If you don‚Äôt have an aoe comp then no shit it won‚Äôt be effective or efficient. At this point you are just arguing in circles with yourself repeating over and over.
---
No its fucking stupid.
---
A catch up mechanic is something like the gear from Nazjatar. For doing new content it rewards you with a way to catch up on gear.
---
You don't just let people do the same shit since launch and scale up the rewards.
---
Oh fuck off dude
---
they're both fine in pvp.
---
Honestly I would just continue to level them both.  Get to about level 35 and you should have a good idea which you prefer for pvp as levels 30-35 will give you lots of pvp exposure (unless you grind dungeons)
---
I‚Äôll tell you right now that it‚Äôs not going to be possible. The only way they could go back to a game design similar to Classic would be to tear the game down to its foundations and start over.
---
Once you give convenience to people, you can‚Äôt take it away. They tried with flying in WoD, and they‚Äôre trying now with the excess gold in game.
---
It's really not the same thing at all. People getting killed by much higher level players can't even hit them and get die in a single hit. Getting an edge in BGs is in an entirely different category of unfairness.
---
This thread is full of people acting like getting mad about your level 15 character getting corpse camped by a 45 permastealthed rogue is due to some kind of inability to grasp the true vanillaness of classic wow. This never didn't make people mad.
---
Just stop ok. When you make a group for a normal run and then the dps berated the tank into aoe spamming its fucking rude. GO MAKE YOUR OWN GROUP IF U WANT TO AOE SPAM
---
Alliance douchebags have been way more toxic questing on my realm.
---
Weird. I do it because it's fun.
---
Woof woof
---
If I could only upvote one post, it would be this one. Sums up exactly how I feel. Retail is an RPG arcade game now. Not saying it's a bad thing, some people like the way its gone. But I like Classic better.
---
It is tho
---
Yeah, that's not going to happen. But I am back after server reset. I did a quick mock-up of how my 40 man setup will look like. Not sure how it's going to work with 4 man columns, groups being 5 man after all. But roughtly speaking something like [this.](https://i.postimg.cc/cJz4mLQZ/WOWscreen2.jpg) I do need to stop with addons and get on with my leveling.
---
50g is what I'm willing to pay RN, bought 2 in vanilla at 70g each. I'm honestly amazed no one bought it at 30 tbh that's a steal.
---
I heard this comment.
---
Dam this is so true
---
Strength is a weak stat for leveling.  You wont get enough strength that negates one more autoattack.  Stam, spir, and int and agi are what you want.  More durability, less downtime, faster clears.
---
Kromkrush is filled to the brim with toxic players, specifically mages and warriors. My blacklist is so large already it's absurd
---
As a priest healer - this doesn't get better. I was wearing level 40 gear well into level 60. In fact, I've been 60 for over a week and my weapon is still from Scarlet Monastery. There's always someone else who wants the gear, and they always end up winning. You learn to use what you have and enjoy the rest of the game. The gear grind is an important part of the game, but sometimes you just don't win. If you can't enjoy the rest of the game, you'll have a bad time.
---
Not possible. You cannot automate anything.
---
Best you can do it add in [@cursor].
---
That vendor price is looking tempting
---
As a tank I don‚Äôt give a fuck about the meters, as long as they‚Äôre attacking the skull I love them.

Mine looks the same
---
I always make sure either me or my pet is attacking the mob from behind when that happens, like "See! I'm playing optimally in this situation that has been caused purely by my own lack of preparation"
---
It increases at 5g a time, and also decreases 5g a time.
---
The only use of bid is to get those items that some people list for like 5 copper to get their item at the top of the list. I've gotten so many recipes, gear and trade items for basically nothing just by bidding these items and then winning the bid.
---
Being willing to sell something for lower than the market price (if you can supply it) is literally how economies work.
---
The supply and demand curves represent the prices people are willing to buy/sell for. If a supplier is willing to sell for cheap because they don't care much about the product, then the only difference between selling it cheap and selling it at market value is who gets the surplus, and we've established that the seller isn't bothered by that.
---
if u don‚Äôt like it make your own group.
---
I don't sit there crying about PVP publicly but I would rather not be on a PVP server, I feel I have no choice due to OCE always dying out, my choice is to play on a PVE server with no population even day 1 it was medium pop its typically on low pop so I worry that will only get worse, roll PVP server so it has population but then have to deal with WPVP and both PVP servers on OCE are heavy horde which make it even worse with the ganks or roll an American server and have 150+ ping  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
there's a big difference between DPS numbers and controlled damage.  you can be focus firing important targets, but deal less DPS than if you were AOE cleaving everything, and possibly take longer to clear even though you have "higher numbers".  Not to mention, it's beneficial to have a spread of damage types - AOE, or single burst, sustained ect for different situations in dungeons.  Unless it's a specific thing, like planning to run AOE graves/stairs, then having one main AOE damage dealer while the rest focus down the runners/casters is perfectly acceptable.
---
Are you still playing retail?

Rng... I don't know how many times I've run gnomer and not seen the helmet drop, definitely more than the drop rate would suggest im sure.

I am not trying to be rude but if you read the thread I clearly state I only have 400 hours in WoW. Plus the concern for warlocks was brought up to me by a WoW dev vlog on PVP inconsistencies.

You have got to be kidding.

Go back to bfa fuck me dead..
---
I can't post on official forums, it says I need a lvl 10+ character. Does it not count classic characters? I need to play retail in order to post on classic forums?

Thanks guys for clearing this up
---
You can make vultures spawn by dying.. no wait that's irl
---
I've got my 1 button set to a macro with something akin to the following
---
    /cast shoot %targettarget%, shoot
---
If I have my tank selected, it switches target to his current target and starts wanding them. If I have a mob selected, it just wands them directly.
---
I have the same setup for my shadow word pain so that lets me plink a few damage onto whatever the tank is attacking (which he's more likely to have some aggro on) while I wait for one of my party members to fuck up and need healing. 
---
Remind me in like 4 hours when I'm home and I'll copypaste both of the actual macros here.
---
Does quest experience get converted into extra gold at level 60?
---
Except he practically is is if you read the Classic quest text
---
I completely agree with what you're saying and think it's fucking wild that people think that just because spellcleave is popular it's ruining the meta. So many people are claiming "if you're not a mage right now you can't find a group", but like, can't the rest of the classes just group together then....
---
Well, travel times were never that bad. Initially getting to some places is difficult but I can get from one side to the other, and from one end to the other pretty easily and quickly. It isn't instant, it takes some running, but it's never more than a few minutes.
---
Cookie cutter builds are in my estimation better than the meaningless talent builds that we have in retail. My talents matter, not every choice is a good choice, but many of them are. And I have actual totems again! My main complaint will be about balance. If my spec can't output the right damage because I'm not going to be allowed to use a DoT slot that is better used by someone else, then that sort of sucks.
---
Itemization gave us some interesting options and allowed players to get creative. We weren't penalized for creative, interesting solutions. I feel like downranking falls into this as well. Downranking heals is super useful for keeping things like Ancestral healing alive by spamming rank 1 HW, and I downrank my earthshock for a cheap and cheerful interrupt if I don't otherwise have the mana.
---
As for grind... that's how you learn to play the character. It's tough, and you have to eat/drink after every few mobs depending on the state of your gear, but I know when I hit 60 I will know how to play an enhancement shaman very, very well.
---
Ohh look a DD
---
So you like over the top quests that make you feel like the only play that exists in WoW and like a specila snowflake.
---
Hmm i think you will love bfa no joke man , honestly classic is the opposite of what you want.
---
Classic quests where never about blowing smoke up your ass making you feel like a hero . If you like that bfa has plenty of it but thats why many of us prefer classic.

&gt; Anyone that says "we're at WAR, its WARcraft," really missed the point of wc3.

The majority of WoW players have never played WC3. I don't have a source but WoW's popularity has massively surpassed WC3 that it's a given.

Alright wow. I must've gotten a bad time or it was just my server. People on yours are not even putting stars on there or write in all caps.

---
Drop engineering and relevel as goblin engineer (sapper charges and better grenades)

Drop mining for herbalism (fadeleaf for blind and swiftthistle for thistle tea)

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5s4kl/horde_or_alliance/).

I honestly have no idea what's appropriate, I'm generally happy with any token amount.  I've been given anything from 20s all the way up 1g 50s so far. (I was shocked to get the 1g 50... it was from a level 42 paladin, so I figure since his mount was free he had money burning a hole in his pocket, lol.)
---
Your level is probably going to determine what kind of tip is appropriate though. (I wouldn't expect a large sum from a level 18, for example.)
---
The weather in Vanilla is really great. It seems like layers have different weather patterns as one time it was pouring down in Theramore and when I accepted an invite to a dungeon group the weather changed instantly.
---
In that order?
---
So each time you "die" in that expansion, do you run in a living body to get back into your spirit form?
---
it can be resisted you know, it's a spell
---
Idk what your talking about... It is working exactly how it did in classic........
---
Ya they would have to one shot players for it to work otherwise players would zerg hard.
---
nah there was nothing wrong with me.
---
No offense but im glad your not running classic wow .
---
What your saying is the ezact thing I DONT WANT.
---
Im sick of playing retail and feeling like im Thanos or some super hero it takes all the fun out of the game when you knoe everyone is Thanos and its all just gimmicky quests.
---
Not on Bigglesworth, my guild takes time every day to makes sure that Alliance can do all the quests their hearts desire.
---
All time favorite WoW troll right here
---
Excuse you
---
Wrong.  Many Wrath quests made you feel like a meaningful part of the war effort. They did a good job of hitting a middle ground between feeling like what you did made a difference while still feeling like you were part of something bigger.
---
Questing in classic feels completely meaningless.
---
You can turn it off with a script. I'm on mobile so I can't find it but it took me a quick Google search when I wanted to find it.
---
Yo what UI are you using?
---
Id actually prefer the rod if you are questing, the spirit will keep your uptime higher than slighty faster killing by having to drink less often. If you do mostly dungeonn or aoe grind, go for the stave.
---
You're very welcome. I wish you luck with your tanking!
---
Well then I guess it‚Äôs for me lol I love being an a hole
---
And are you hitting for more now?
---
I'm on a PvP server cos all my mates went on one. I'm really enjoying the PvP. Though at one point i was doing some quests and i got ganked. No biggie, it happens. Though they just camped my body for ages and kept killing me and not leaving. 
---
I went in zone chat and said something along the lines of "hey i'm getting camped, can someone come help me kill these allys?" and I just got responses like "oh look whos whining, go back to retail" or "shouldn't be on a PvP server if you can't handle it." 
---
I'm totally down with people not being whingey every time they get killed but when someone asks for help dont be a cunt about it.
---
What are you talking about. They're right there.

I use F4-F8 to summon my lock pets, for instance.

What is the purpose of having a different shaped blade for each thing you‚Äôre cutting?

Can confirm pallys are often assholes. Yesterday i was the only horde questing in an area of Hillsbrad thriving with ally, but they were all leaving me alone when they saw I was friendly and minding my own business. Suddenly this human pally comes and jumps me with his stun, i fight back and get him to bubble. Noone seems to have seen how the fight started, cause they all jumped me as soon as that happened.

Come to Bigglesworth. My guild specializes in clearing horde from Hillsbrad.
---
One of the reasons my house is Linux only.  :)
---
Zug zug! Maybe me dat kind of orc
---
Yeah if you're a warrior and not rolling on Herod's helm/shoulder/pants you're basically inting your leveling process.
---
calm down Jokerd
---
Sure, as long as people start paying for heals.
---
I ran BFD and im hitting just fine now
---
When I was raiding I would keybind my Pally heals. One addon I loved was Clique. I would just click the portrait with the keybinding I used and heal people super quickly.
---
I am running classic wow, and I love it.
---
You realize there's such a thing as middle ground, right? It's not some zero sum equation where you're a dirt grubbing adverturer OR the hero of Azeroth.
---
Health regen yes, mana regen no.
---
Ignore them, they're trying to incite you into being an asshole. Probably zoomers who will quit in a month or so lol
---
are you really gatekeeping classic wow?
---
God damn it, I‚Äôve wanted a hyena mount since vanilla, and the give it to *that* guy?!
---
Its actually not, Its just different than what most of the retail brains are used to. Practice, get the hang of the ability and you'll see its not.
---
same
---
Why√Ωyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
[Yeah, that's the ticket!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyp9fh-u4w8)
---
This worked for me. Thanks!
---
Without context of what was said, it's hard to feel sympathy for either side.
---
You claim that you told the shaman nicely (and while you may have) with out  proper context.
---
It's a he said/she said.
---
If your guild needs you for a run (and you have done dungeons with them before, you would rather go with the guild than some randoms (i know i would) as you know what your gonna get.
---
Maybe try running ZF and other Dungeons with your guild instead and that might solve the issue.
---
Also you said the first tank was horrible, but how are we to know? It's just from what you have told us. For all we know, you might be a poor DPS.
---
If you are going to come to reddit and complain, expect some backlash.
---
I chew 'em up as an affliction lock.
---
Yeah but that's something you focus on much later than leveling 30-40.  You don't even start building good leather DPS sets until 50+.  Fury war was the first char I played way back in 2004, and I made the big mistake to try and gear ignoring armor.  It's much more efficient to get good +STR and high armor for less downtime while questing, relying on a few items +crit will not make the difference at lower levels.  In fact it's better to forgo deepwounds/impale until later in the tree for a leveling build.
---
The gear from SM is def good for a war, but you'll be using it to 42/maybe 45.  +Crit gear really comes online for warriors at max level when they can get flurry and impale, and don't forfeit as much raw AP comparatively to their weapons.
---
Druid no wanding here.
---
damn, you already added this in
---
Lol thought the guild was wiggle earth
---
I browse new quite often but never seen any of these "idiot newbie" posts you're talking about
---
you mean druids, right?
---
dueled a 41 druid on my 36 shaman and nearly killed him!
---
I just use Trello (and soon‚Ñ¢ will host my own Trello replacement). Which there was a way to integrate Trello into WoW though.
---
The amount of times Ive been ganked by packs of horde is hilariously high, my average would have to be 3:1 fights. I've set the goal of getting to 40 and when I've done that Ill spend 2 solid days stomping on horde in Ashenvale.
---
Whenever I have BOE gear I inspect people at whatever city I am in and find someone who it is an upgrade for and trade it. I would rather do that than go to the AH or vendor it. The reactions are hilarious ‚ÄúI owe you my life‚Äù is my fav so far.
---
That support agent is a fucking moron.
---
The spell he referenced ( [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=4525/demonic-immolation-passive](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=4525/demonic-immolation-passive) ) is not the spell that the infernal has. The infernal has an ability called immolation ( [https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19483/immolation](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=19483/immolation) ), which is the one that does the pulsing AoE.
---
What areas give honor in stormwind...?
---
Also, at what status of honor are the mounts cheaper?
---
Thanks!
---
The zoom in to a pixelated undead /waving gave me quite a chuckle. Perfect video!

I like to embrace it

I was toying around in crossroads last night. Tamed tekk and was eyes of beasting around and fight lowbies with my pet when they tagged themselves unexpectedly. Would kill them once and would never kill a lowbie that didnt attack first. Let everyone run away when they realised they were two low to kill me at 60. No griefing. About an hour into it some 58 shaman defender of the horde came and tried to kill me. Over and over and over. About 45 minutes of him trying, he killed me a couple time. I killed him about 10. Every time he attacked first. Even when I rezzed I would go somewhere else. He came looking. Np. Pvp server I get it.  But then he called a warrior over. Same guild. They proceeded to camp me for 5 deaths spamming nuttap on my body. I tried to mount and run away. They followed me all of barrens..... they proceeded to camp me. I took rez sickness and tried to hearth. They even had one guy go back to camp the spirit rez. I understand pvp and competition, but griefing is sad.
---
Just my 2c rant. Take it for what you want.
---
What exactly is the problem with it?
---
I meow meow meow and I dance dance dance
---
You're saying he was correct that we didn't want Classic?
---
Except there was actually VERY little to do at level cap in vanilla if you weren't heavy into PVP. You'd clear your token raids and then what... level an alt, because you had nothing better to do and a problem admitting you had an addiction to a game that you had nothing left to do in.
---
Fair enough, but multiply that out over several hundred people all doing it, it adds up quick.  But this is a good point.
---
You are correct, but the game is made to ENSURE you cannot win every encounter with every different class you may run into. You cannot PvP and remain undefeated forever. You just gotta accept that some classes can wreck you under the right circumstances\conditions, and then play in a way to limit those encounters that are not favorable to you. They will still happen, but if you put some extra thought into it you can lower the number of times it happens
---
Honestly, all game companies should.
---
Who are all the other folk?
---
It is cool that you are finally the faction you wanted to play and are seeing areas for the first time. Perhaps you could use stealth/invis potion and get on top of the Orgrimmar bank for old times sake :) ?
---
Alliance in a nutshell. Good thing the levels will eventually match.
---
Go on. Throw your tantrums at me below...
---
I just got Clique and uninstalled Healbot. 
---
But I have no idea how to use Clique and the ingame add menu doesn't seem to help lol. Any tips or I guess I could just youtube?
---
This is the kind of energy I need in my life.
---
Always was a 2 click macro......  No need for the stop attack.... /pet passive /fd /cast freeze trap /petdefensive (might be called something else I forget) ..... Make this macro and hit it multiple times......
---
You have to put the combat cast on the FD tho. So it only tries to cast it if your in combat.  And then if your out of combat you can use freeze trap without FDing......
---
I played hunter throughout classic and and main one now. The macro works... There's 3 things that happen that can cause it to "fail". First a spell or attack is on its way to you or your pet but hasn't hit yet. Second fd gets resisted. Third frost trap gets resisted.
---
Otherwise 60% of the time it works everytime.
---
I was about to die at the cyclonian and a hunter from the other faction ran over and finished him off for me. Solid move on a pvp server
---
You forgot to use print screen for the screenshot ;)
---
Completely irrelevant. Healing is a role, just the same as DPS (rogue) they're not being paid to do damage. They're being compensated for working up an OPTIONAL unique class skill.
---
The fights in icecrown over titanium nodes was amazing lol. I was a rogue in wotlk so could sap and steal nodes from right under peoples noses
---
I thought you had news about the Altoholic addon and I got excited. :(
---
I'd rather be ugly than drag my knuckles everywhere.
---
Me personally? Cap the number of items people can get each week/month, then players get to /roll. 
---
The number doesn't have to be fixed. Say you recruit a lot of new people, drop it down a notch. Exception to this rule is tanks.
---
Level 45 water is 40s per 5 from the innkeep.    
---
In town / out in the world, I'll offer 1g for any quantity 60+.  1g for 100 makes me dance.    
---
In group, I'll put 25s in the trade even for 1 stack.  Very often mages will begin spamming me with water as thanks.  
---
Find mage, get water is my very first objective when I log in.  The innkeep is a price gouging jackass.
---
 I don‚Äôt get it. The devilsaur leather sells for 14g a piece of leather?
---
Hey, to each there own. A waste of 4 hrs of game time for sure, but cant fault him for enjoying it his way lol
---
Absolutely, but does that mean that every blacksmith is expected to have keys on them at all times?
---
Noice
---
The email Said all the items ive got from layering and that pretty much most of my items
---
Multiboxxing.
---
I mean, they 'removed' that feature in terms of mythic dungeons which you can't queue for or teleport to
---
Well, at first I was just going to report them and be done with it. Then they tagged a mob I was just about to tag. then I was upset.
---
Yeah that's called multiboxing nothing new or bannable
---
I'll say it before and I'll say it again. 
---
Twitch ruined WoW Classic. Everyone thinks they're a fuckin' pro now and if you don't clear a dungeon in under an hour, you're a scrub. 
---
It didn't actually *ruin* WoW. But it was so nice when back in the day everyone was just happy to run a dungeon.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs bannable though
---
!remindme 1 day
---
Sadly still many retail crybabies are up on our classic servers, they only know the single player wow game where you can stand in your own garrison instance all day and never get pvped, where you just queue for dungeons and raids so you never will be ganked at the entrance and where jobs are useless so you dont have to go out and try to gather anything with the risk of getting ganked.
---
Oh yeah and because of phasing you really have a low risk as well that someone who already did all the phased quests is getting bored and making trouble.
---
Those people I assume are the ones crying about "this level ?? guy just went over to my level 32 toon and killed me twice, blizzard ban him permanent and delete his account why do people do this on pvp servers?"
---
Hope these people are gone sooner or later.
---
Well when I started on release week with my mates we agreed to try something new and started on alliance (in retail we are on horde since we started playing in WotLK). We were level 19-20 when we agreed that something just feels off, I guess we all knew what it was, but nobody wanted to say it out loud, except for our rogue player who was strictly against betraying our Horde, so he said what we all thought: " Guys shouldn't we be in The Barrens right now? " Now we are back Home currently level 44-45 and we all regret nothing , everything just feels better. For us I didn't work out trying something new. Walking on actual streets and sleeping in fancy Houses means nothing when it doesn't feel like Home.
---
so much this.
---
I tend to curse loudly when I get rekt from behind while I'm at low hp, but in the end of the day that's why I chose a pvp server. It makes leveling more exciting.
---
It's probably just multiboxing. 
---
It's not a bot, it's a person playing them.
---
As a proud member of the Horde, my heart yearns to destroy you. Good job!
---
Yeah it's hipocrisy depending on the point of view, just like the so famous "samurai honor",honor has the value that you give it
---
Why don‚Äôt you people just join an active big guild??? My guild does EVERYTHING together. I haven‚Äôt joined a pug since Deadmines.
---
As a rule of thumb, if they are running a dungeon then they should.
---
They‚Äôll run out of food eventually... right?
---
I mean, don't people have any depth to their way of thinking? 
---
Like, if you kick some random guy for no reason, it might make your guild have a bad reputation.
---
Can people not think a couple steps ahead?
---
What the fuck how did you know?
---
I have been doing this for days, I just gank level 50s at level 40 and my 60 rogue buddy comes in and kills everything.
---
Nice, what dropped? Had to do it 15 times to get my mage chest
---
Lol I love streamers. It's just fun to kill people in that guild.
---
It's all part of the Flight Master mafia.
---
My cat literally tries to sit on my shoulders
---
That hasn't happened yet, besides the popularity but of course.
---
Im a dwarf just got mithril and when i saw this post i thought it was going to be about me. I did this to an orc yesturday in badlands. Sorry orc but hey should have let me pull that elemental instead of you
---
guess we should tell them not to do that /s
---
Looks like a multi boxer to me. Nothing reportable to my knowledge. There is a guy on Twitch that has played 40 at once for a while.
---
How do you think I‚Äôm level 56...
---
hmm im quite sure its weapon speed. will check it out
---
Sorry, looking for gold cost of the recipies
---
It is not about being newbie or casuals. What explanation do you need to understand that stealing is bad? It was supposedly explained in first years of life.
---
This is why some people at the time (2003-2005) were arguing raids killed the vanilla experience.
---
no actually, they quickly make more once they get low. I thought the cast time to make food was a lot longer, but somehow they make it a short cast time.
---
It‚Äôs been so long I don‚Äôt remember. LOL, sorry.
---
Sorry, looking for the gold cost of the recipes
---
I thought someone else got realm first few days ago on your server. Saw a post about it
---
Unless you run out of ammo! And yeah but I'm talking from a pure aesthetic standpoint right? Like there is no dmg diff between the diff types of ranged but you are looking for an aesthetic
---
Also missing Maraudon.
---
Good mage is pretty unkillable but luckily they are mostly shit and get fucked by most classes. Druids shaman hunter spriest lock all generally give them a hard time.
---
Does " MultiBoxing" allow all 4 character to Sync up taking flight to the Milli-Second ? They had literally no delay not even 50ms , all of them in the same second took flight , multiboxing as far as i can remember just let you run multiple clients.
---
Mor'Ladim would like a word
---
Is Auctionator available for Classic? I didn't find it in the Curse/Twitch app.
---
Not true, I just used my friends 2015 MacBook Pro to do a transmog run with him while I was visiting from out of town.  Ran smooth as butter with no overheating issues.
---
I mean... if you go in to a low level, enemy controlled zone and start fucking with lowbies, however mildly you think you're fucking with them, you gotta expect that you're going to eventually start getting ganked and camped by high level players. They can't tell your "no griefing" intentions, they just know some level 60 enemy is harassing lowbies and are going to what everyone does when a level 60 harasses lowbies - camp the fuck out of them.
---
I would not suggest making an entirely new warrior just for pvp... undead warrior will do just fine and engineering is a very desired pvp profession.
---
There‚Äôs a reason my VW‚Äôs name is Tang-THYK
---
Again... Working up lockpicking is OPTIONAL. They can still perform their role as DPS without it.
---
Cost to acquire skills are a blanket affect for all classes. Technically they are optional as well, however you'll just be gimping yourself and/or group by not paying for the highest rank skill
---
Name a non-professional skill/ability that needs to be PAID for and TRAINED up.... Go ahead, I'LL wait...
---
wait, you took the sword instead of the axe?!
---
You okay man?
---
Sounds like you were happy when it was balanced in your favour. Then when they turned the tables you got salty. Call for help from your own guildies next time
---
No, no you dont.
---
My VW‚Äôs name is legitimately Tang-Thyk
---
HODL!
---
Sure, but onmy after its been left to bake on the dash of my car in the hot sun for 14 days.
---
It‚Äôs a cat and mouse game
---
What about Tangthyk?
---
i can understand the concept of multiboxing , but it would still take player 1 or 2 secs to go between windows to take up flight on each character right? .  
---
How can all 4 characters act in unision same time with not a Milli Second lag between them?
---
While looking for any info about Classic, always search in Nostalrius, Elysium or Light's Hope forums.
---
There you find posts made by people that played the game first then made guides.
---
Wowhead and other garbage websites are full of idiots spreading stupidity on a game they didn't even play yet while writing the *"guide"*.
---
I did this back in the day, got my Tauren to that place above the NPC's in SW's AH and just danced.
---
LOL had this happen yesterday
---
Bleach
---
I'm gonna, but then I get player aggro about not bunching them up for AoE.
---
Problem with that is that people could just guild swap.
---
Hence why loot councils/DKP reward attendance/performance over it.
---
Funny thing is layering can make this strategy nonviable, since you could just be on a different layer from the person ganking your alt.
---
Pick the character who's back of their head looks best. You'll be looking at it a lot. Lol
---
Just pick what looks cool and sound fun. Make several characters and take them for a spin for several levels. I'd say at least 5-10. You'll be playing at least 150 hours probably 200+ to get to 60 so don't feel bad changing out if you get character burn out. This is where making a character on both sides might be fun.
---
Don't forget starting zones and the next couple zones are different for almost all of the races. So try out a little of everything if you are uncertain. It's not a race so just play what makes you happy and have fun!
---
It would make since that beast don‚Äôt drop loot.
---
literally the spitting image of my roomates cat
---
Right?!
---
No offense but why play pvp if u have a problem with this
---
I don‚Äôt think they care for the gold. But rather to inflate the market.
---
So I was on my Night Elf rogue. I killed this guy that was camping someone about 4-5 times. Then he logged out. And guess what I did.
---
I watched a movie on my second monitor and watched that corpse. 45 minutes later..... bones.
---
Let‚Äôs just say he won‚Äôt be logging on again today.
---
Guess I technically took the bait here though.
---
There's a few vendor items I've been flipping on the AH for solid margins that could easily be undercut. But there seems to be a mutual, unspoken understanding with other people doing the same about the price point we use and it's remained profitable for far longer than it should have. 
---
It's great when price fixing works out but I don't blame people for undercutting when there's a large margin.
---
True, was more of a thought experiment/devil's advocate thing.,
---
Rogues can't use axes.
---
I'm pretty sure these people are using an add-on. It looks up prices and posts it's own listing at slightly less so that the user can get a quick and guaranteed sale. 
---
These people and the add-on don't know that they're posting the listings at a loss.
---
You are welcome to try, horde scum.
---
Broadly speaking, turn on target of target in interface options.    
---
Let the tank press 3 buttons.  Call it 5 seconds.  Attack his target.  All should be well.    
---
A threat meter will become a main aspect of your interface in time.
---
My dude, click the link and click on one of the recipes. From that, click the trainer. It gives you a list of every recipe plus the cost to train.
---
Damn you are salty.
---
I don‚Äôt understand his hype. I don‚Äôt like how he talks to his members and viewers. But that‚Äôs just me
---
I've in my decade+ of wow never seen a Horde member gank an alliance member of a lower level without them absolutely deserving it. That is truly an alliance only thing.

Thats the thing though. If you end up in a fair fight then someone didn't do their research haha
---
You aren't resetting the market. The market determined it was valued at a lower price and you didn't like that and bought everything up to jack up prices... if blizzard banned it it's just good old fashioned trust busting.
---
This post gets reposted way too often so deleting it would make sense.
---
Just the nature of older games with small player bases. All of those communities are happy to pay to keep the games they love moving along. EQ proper has probably 20k subscribers at this point.
---
Well let's be fair the Paladin class is so badly designed in this game the players just lost all their sanity and humanity by the time they hit 60...
---
I kinda hope Classic ends up being a reboot for the franchise and learning from what depleted the WoW expansions' quality they'll fix up the game design flaws of Classic in upcoming "Classic Expansions" and remake the expansions in Classic's mentality up to WotLK. No Cata plz tho. Just... no.
---
Yeah I had been looking at that, and if no one responds to me on here and invites me to their realm/guild I was just gonna go to Faerlina as an Orc Warrior haha
---
Guys I'm gona be honest, if someone on the opposing faction is standing next to a mining node while killing a mob you bet your ass I'm stealing it. We're on opposing factions, I'm doing everything possible to mess with you. Now if we're on the same faction then I'll toss you /wave and continue on my way.
---
Actually on my server I find the PVP pretty restrained even in STV. I think most people just want to continue to level and often decide to not engage in combat and avoid hostilities. On my original WoW play-through encountering someone from the other faction ended in a fight 90% of the time, now it's about 20%.
---
As a strictly PvE player, I agree. You roll on a PvP server, expect to die.
---
If you have 2 mages, you can pretty reliably chain your Frost Novas to keep the blizzard mobs CC'd enough that neither of you should take damage, that also works if you don't wanna wait for the sloooooooow tank.
---
Still waiting...
---
A pretty good solution is http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
You can sort by class, specc, race and phase
---
I spam the /wait emote when its someone in a guild I know speaks a different language. 
---
Warrior! I have mark and thorns for your questing!
---
Mages couldnt care less
---
Dungeon mobs have always respawned if you took too long.  We took about 20min to get to last boss in SM Lib. So definitely too soon for them to respawn.
---
Any level warrior*
---
It's annoying if nothing else. The chat was nice for finding groups as a tank, but I'll hunt down a new spot.
---
Look it up and ask in trade. Some will try to trick you but you should get some honest responses eventually and you can ballpark it. Every server is different so asking for prices on reddit won't help you. Good luck.
---
Ensure you are at or above the level of the mobs to mitigate avoidance and deflection. Tell group to not be dickcheeses and give you time to get aggro.
---
LOL get killed by a pally, all pallys are assholes!!
---
Haven't watched those in forever...
---
you do not need to be in defensive stance for sunder. Otherwise, yeah, pretty much. Hit Overpower when you can, using rage to spam hamstring to also get some deep wounds bleeds on hamstring crits.
---
Middle School Economics was hard for Quche.
---
We were only inside for a total of about 20min, way too soon for respawns.

&gt; EXACTLY. I can't handle level 21 characters trying to tell me they're specc'd for such and such a role.

It's not on the app, you need to get it manually.
---
He can. You gamble on him forgetting to do so. Bidding on short duration listings will increase your chances
---
I may be wrong but I think that you can only use one cast per macro.
---
I main Paladin and play both sides on PvP servers, I gotta say I have absolutely zero experience with what you see. I see it all the time from Priests, from Mages, from Warlocks, from Hunters, and from Rogues, from Shammies, and from Druids. I see it certainly the least from Paladins and Warriors. If this is because of how they level or not, I have to completely disagree with your assessment, but I'm sorry your experience has been so bad. :(
---
Yeah absolutely, just as chivalry "honor's" also depends on the point of view
---
It's PvP.  It's supposed to hurt, burn, piss you off and fire you up.  Then and only then will you complete your journey and make WoW what it is SUPPOSED to be: War.  Horse hates Alliance.  Alliance hates Horde.  Red = dead.  All Alliance/Horde are KoS.  
---
Stay thirsty my friends.
---
It's exactly that, setting yourself up for a big SS WW combo with your 2h as the opener, then back to your shield. I'm arms while doing this, you could do the same as fury and instead open with your 1hers. Even with that method it's still impossible to hold threat against big aoe for too long. When not going this route I'll lose threat around 60% against dual mages spamming blizzard. With the SS WW I've been able to hold it until around 30%.
---
So glad I transferred to heartseeker, got to mid 40s and couldn‚Äôt quest anywhere that wasn‚Äôt outside a dungeon
---
Aaa haaaa.. you good sir have exellent humor, and have never been to darkshire. The place of horde retribution center.
---
I am glad you guys all came to that conclusion before you leveled up too far :) And that you were all happy to move as well. The inns may be cozy on Alliance but you have to share a room with a Gnome. 
---
I hope that I can either move to Horde or find peace as an Alliance as it is always in the back of my mind while leveling! Sadly unless I delete my chars I have to play Horde on a full or a medium server.
---
Ah you're one of those dudes that probably complained about being ganked all the time in the early levels and then turn around and do the exact thing you complained about.
---
Unless you're fighting orange mobs or your weapons are 10 levels too low and green most mobs will be dead at 4 points.
---
This is not true, you were always able to cancel an auction with a bid on it, but you had to pay the AH fee of the current bid. People likely forgot to cancel it or were oblivious that they posted it with a low bid to begin with.
---
that northern camp fp would help out a lot
---
It really isn't viable. Play a resto shaman trying to make gold, come back and make this post again.

They all have gcds so you cant use them at the same time

TLDR: Quche is an idiot.
---
This would be an appropriate meme for Alliance running Scarlet Monastery Graveyard
---
I had one undead warlock that ate more bodies in Scarlet Monastery than I have ever seen in all my leveling. I did heal him because he did do something, anything, besides just expecting me to do it. Not as simple as just taking a drink, but it did give me the giggles to see him eating corpses before or even during a fight.

This is the classic experience we‚Äôve all been asking for

Ya but respec isn't too crazy as a raid tank. A lot of raids will pay for respec.

U are right but there are so many items like cloth that are selling at such a low profit margins that sometimes they fall into the "lose money by selling in ah" category. People just undercut without thinking about it and lose a few silver or copper which can add up but even so still a silly mistake and easily avoidable
---
The bosses in stocks don't even have loot tables.

Yeah I‚Äôm hoping that it will get better after cap...no BG queue will be sweet.

---
Well I can't say I'm surprised.
---
I'm keen to hear why you think that you personally shouldn't have to contribute to the group by using the full kit of your class unless people allow you to have a higher roll. Do you at least tell people this upfront? Or do you wait until halfway through a dungeon then refuse to open?
---
Just the pendulum swinging from one extreme to the other brother.

You make the game too hard, we want it easy. You make it too easy, we want it hard.

Let's be real, it's why we're leveling Warriors.
---
&gt;I know there's the "HURRR PVP HAPPENED GO ROLL PVE YOU CAREBEAR" Yeah I get it. I enjoy PVP to an extent but getting killed and camped because of overwhelming numbers isn't exactly fun for the losing side. People who can't see this point of view should roll the losing faction once and see how it feels like.
---
It's literally what a pvp server is for. I see so many people want all the epic cool wpvp moments but nothing else that comes with it
---
Pallies are the only class I gank without a second thought. I‚Äôll usually leave everyone else alone unless they attack me or other hordes. And if the Pallies kill me, I just come right back until they have no cds left. Fuck em.
---
Typical alliance, can't win when they're the same level as the hordies in the zone :)
---
Isn't it fucking amazing that *Blizzard* is running Classic WoW now?

Remember on the private servers? All the drama surrounding the server owners?

The integrity of the game doesn't have to fall into question anymore.

Do what I do, if people constantly refuse to attack the mark or pull "for me," after a certain number of times I just stop taking agro from them. You want to pull? Then you can tank it
---
Yes, but why do you care about what layer you are on after 8 hours?
---
Once I have my three dots up (or sometimes just CoA and Corruption if the mobs lower lvl) I start wanding

Thats what I like to think. The animals are cruising on the winds, following nice smells, checking something that caught their eyes, just bored in general of making the same flight all the time. Maybe they take the ridiculous routes because that was the way they were trained. I'm sure they are used for transporting some general goods, mail, etc, as well as players.

A) How are we to know who is new and who isn't? How do we know you haven't played the game for 10 years and took that chest to be an ass?  
---
B) You won't ever know these rules unless you've been taught them, much like we all needed to learn.  
---
C) Not all veterans are mean, just like not all newbies are nice.   
---
Generally speaking, don't be an ass. The getting in line for quests is not likely going to happen anymore, at least for a while. There are too many people who are too desperate so level they won't wait in a line because 'if I attack first, I can get the tag and fuck that line'. Otherwise, common sense.   
---
Someone is killing a mob near a chest/node? Leave them be. Someone is waiting near an area where a big baddie quest guy spawns? Party them or let them take it first. In a group and you find a chest? Don't stop killing mobs to stand near the chest so as soon as you drop combat, you can be the one to loot it.   
---
Look up stat priority for your class. Warriors use gear from leather, mail and plate. They'll use strength,agi, and stm but they won't \*generally\* use int or spirit. So if you were a warrior, you would never need on cloth or anything with int/spirit. Know what stats are good for you and weapons/armor is good for your class.   
---
If a green drops, ask the group if they're okay with you rolling need (or watch to see what other people roll). If a blue drops, only roll need if you are going to equip that item now or within the next few levels. If a purple drops, they are so rare and worth so much the whole group will usually all roll need or all roll greed. Even if that purple item is an upgrade for you, it's generally accepted that everyone in the group rolls equally on it. Unless you ask and the group gives you the go ahead (which won't likely happen).  
---
Same with profession mats. If you need a profession mat that drops, ask, don't just need.  
---
The loot rules go out the window if someone rolls need on something they don't need. That purple drops and Jonsnow rolls need on it? Feel free to roll need. That tailoring recipe dropped and Frodobaggins rolls need on it, go ahead. A bear tank (lol) rolls need on a healing piece? Call him out on it. Even if your class can duel spec (hell, maybe you really are resto but just tanking this dungeon), unless stated at the beginning of the run, you only roll on gear for the role you are filling.
---
This is how it worked in vanilla. It was pretty substantial, too. I remember doing level 60-ish quests and getting 5-15g rewards instead of the high xp rewards.
---
Maybe, but currently I don't have the time to implement it :(
---
I appreciate your comment, but I wasn't asking for any sympathy. I just thought it was funny the shaman got that butthurt to the point of ignoring me. It's not like I insulted him ignorantly or anything, I just gave him some (true) advice in a very normal, non downtalking manner and he proceeded to not only ignore me, but insult me after I left and then insta-ignore me again so I couldn't respond, lol. 
---
The second two....I do run dungeons with my guild, all the time. This was before they were on. Of course you would RATHER run dungeons with your guildies. But that doesn't mean you just leave the 3 other people in your group in the middle of the dungeon. You finish the damn dungeon, faster if need be. Like I said multiple times, it is simply rude and inconsiderate to leave a dungeon halfway through to go to another dungeon with your guildies. That is fact, you can't argue that it isn't. Its just about the definition of "rude" and "inconsiderate".   
---
You say " 
---
Also you said the first tank was horrible, but how are we to know? It's just from what you have told us. For all we know, you might be a poor DPS. "  
---
...did you not read my post? The tank aggro'd the boss the first time, then in chat asked "who aggro'd the boss"? then proceeded to aggro the boss before we were ready A SECOND TIME, THE SAME WAY. 
---
The first fight, he let the healer die to 2 elite adds that spawn. He didn't even try to sunder them or taunt or anything, and they were attacking the priest for a few seconds before he died. I tried to fear them, but they are immune to fear, and I couldn't get aggro off him in time (even though that is not my job as DPS). Then the second attempt, THE TANK LET THE PRIEST DIE AGAIN IN THE EXACT SAME WAY! This time the priest even said in chat as the adds spawned, AND as they were running to him, for the tank to get aggro on them, and again he didn't even hit either add once!
---
I'm sorry but clearly you either have very poor reading comprehension or are simply daft if you think A. that guy was not a terrible tank. B. me being a "Bad" dps or "Good" dps had anything to do with anything (I was second on DPS meter to the level 50 rogue, at level 43, fyi)
---
Also the way you write like one sentence and then space your post out by 5000 spaces is AIDS on my eyes. Why do you do that? It looks terrible and makes no sense.
---
This is something people actually need to be mindful of. Once HK's come you're going to be a prime target for someone grinding R10+, especially flight points.
---
SnD is fantastic. One example, fighting two humanoids. One runs off at low hp, he will bleed to death, but hes got combo points, so I can use SnD to not waste those and also get an edge on the next mob. 
---
Occasionally I'll end a fight with one bleeding mob and 5 combo points - Eviscerate is a waste and I can easily carry a 5 CP SND into the next fight, a little buff right at the start. 
---
We are many trick ponies. Not like those unfathomable, debacherous and easily dispatchable mages.

Why should I answer an irrelevant question? I guess it makes sense that you refuse to answer why you believe that you personally shouldn't have to contribute to a group with the full kit of your class. Oh well, I guess you're just toxic.
---
It's a bit of both, nothing is black and white. Most groups I've ran with including up to BRD and even MC were random to an extent. And they've been chill. But I've also been uninvited from groups because I was a shaman, or kicked for lower dps.
---
The negative experiences are harder to forget which is why reddit can be negative.
---
Shiiiitttt.... I hate it.
---
This is a poorly thought out fitness game. 
---
First of all, push ups are the classic punishment. Do those on death...not success.
---
If you win loot you gotta quickly get back to playing (usually). You aren't safe. Do 5 burpees.
---
Jumping Jacks are mostly cardio. Do those for flight paths.
---
Don't do chair dips or you'll just stop checking your mail and we need to award good auction house play.
---
Don't forget load screens. Mix it up with squats, curls, or crunches.
---
Level up. Drink a beer and don't do any fitness bullshit for at least 30 minutes.
---
I have auctionator, I scan the whole ah then mass post everything I have for 1% under the lowest price.

---
How long does 40-50 take for an Alliance hunter with average playtime?  30-40 was a slog.
---
Dubious. Pretty simple to have it hearth to Menethil if it gets completely out of its depth.
---
Nobody ever mentions hunters :(
---
well one thing is that mage and warr is most played classes, so coz the number of mages are high also the number of toxic shit mages go up.
---
You're my hero for real

For every time I was killed in STV I killed a few grays in Darkshire

So you guys all have never readjust camera on?

Lol people Still farm it. A lot easier if it isn't an hour per chance

It's the exact opposite on Herod.

Make sure you talk to Oziach first
---
You are assuming that the ones who make "shame" posts or w/e arent lying about their situation, which wouldnt be surprising...
---
And remember! Classic is SOOOOO different than retail. All your knowledge will disappear. You have to look for parties to get quests done. You'll make new friends in no time! You'll see that the atmosphere is totally different. I'm on server benediction and just started a rogue, level 11 now. Alliance gnome. With a rogue/druid only guild. It's a blast!
---
name and shame.  People need to be held responsible for their bad behaviour.
---
So what's it like to do the damage of a level 30 , at 60? Tell me the stories of these ganking paladins that can barely win against a leveler in STV
---
Ok so no water and food for group unless y‚Äôall give me something. I give that  man water I better get something out of his skills
---
But on an RP server this is a valid rogue trickster roleplay thief man
---
As a gay ass, I approve
---
The Classic experience: running 10 minutes to the coast so you can use a buff you were gifted with that runs out in 10 minutes.
---
if you kill the mines, it prevents them from exploding
---
If that's true then blizzard missed the whole point. We don't care abiut npc's kissing our butts. We just want to be adventures. Not, "ChAmPiOn, HaEl HeR wOoNs!"
---
I know its not popular right now, but make your group use their CC.  Mage sheep, Warlock seduce, Druid root/sleep, Hunter frost trap, Rogue sap, etc.  If you CC correctly there should only be one target at a time and it‚Äôs easier to hold aggro.
---
Is there a guide to get started with developing your own addon?
---
You're hitting a problem with DPS playstyle more than anything - there isn't AOE threat the way you're hoping. Last week they hotfixed a bug where shouts were generating way too much threat so a lot of people 'know' that they're fine and you're just a bad tank. 
---
If mages are AOEing immediately that's on them, but it doesn't make your experience very enjoyable though. 
---
I'd recommend binding something to the skull mark and then get the DPS to focus fire more, means you aren't spread so thin. Threat beyond healing aggro is slow so the DPS just need to learn to wait for it to build, then not AOE constantly.
---
The advice about being above level will help heaps too, means you are more reliable but also more likely to crit for rage and burst threat too. 
---
Keep tabs on good DPS too, will help a lot, as a tank you're worth more than they are so don't stress if people are unkind, you can just not tank for them again.
---
Avoid it entirely! Go Barrens, Southern Barrens, Stonetalon, Thousand Needles, Tanaris. Horde almost always have the advantage number wise, at least until Tanaris(?).

Most fun moment this month was both factions calmly questing until I got yanked by a group of 3.
---
Which then got me in /1 asking for more people as I was wasted off my ass until we regained control of the questing area. 
---
When wpvp is psuedo battlegrounds, that‚Äôs the most fun. When it‚Äôs three dudes just body camping it‚Äôs a snooze.
---
AoE threat is pretty hard early on. You aren't getting or making much rage and your kit is limited. Any party member higher than you in levels will be a thorn in your side.
---
My advice is:
---
1) Get 2-4 friends and up your communication game.
---
2) Actually mark and CC the mobs in bigger pulls.
---
3) Wait until you are at -1 to even levels with the last boss before tanking a dungeon.
---
4) Have a good healer and tank with a 2H. Try generating threat with damage. Don't forget to switch back to DEF stance whenever you're sundering/shouting for bonus threat.
---
Tanking at 60 is honestly a bit easier. Everyone is the same level. The mobs are more tuned for that as well. You are generating quite a bit more rage (especially on boss fights) and can weave in some Heroic Strikes. Etc.
---
In all honesty, don't feel bad if you can't hold AoE threat in Classic very well. It could be argued that you were never designed to be able to do that.
---
This is why you always process your updates so they don't stack up like this.
---
Join Rattlegore &amp; Horde and I‚Äôll quest w/ you any weekday night or weekend. Just lvl 17 Shaman but I just rolled it Saturday or Sunday. Made a post a few days ago don‚Äôt have anyone I know that plays  so kind of tough to find people that are down
---
If you don't want to put in the time and effort to snag the recipe yourself then you just have to pay the markup to get it off of the AH.
---
That human should go roll on a pve server if he's going to get upset at dying in open world.
---
2 hours, wiped on last trash mobs to last boss. Came back and mobs have respawned. Ahhh classic üòÑ
---
The census sites do indeed show druid as the least played class behind paladin and shaman which are obviously lower only being available to one faction.
---
How can I (priest), beat and undead rogue? Seems like they just stun lock me to death.
---
A ton of people like wpvp and even more will when honor comes out
---
I'm using TradeSkillMaster atm. It's got a *huge* learning curve, and I'm probably using about 1% of it's capabilities. But it lets me cut through AH crap. (And also helps somewhat with my crafting)
---
Yeah that was me the other day. I was following the classicwow.live leveling guide and just happened to line up with being here since I was about a level and a half behind.
---
Wow. Why do I feel WoW had the right ideas on Vanilla but sort of forgot about these kinds of things?
---
You could play rugby with that thing.
---
Oh my GOD thats the greatest name for a ganking rogue ive ever heard LOL

Yup that was me XD
---

I'm talking about Redridgeboss
---
Where's your Traveler's Backpacks?
---
Mediocre.
---
Hahaha. Took me a sec.
---
Medium, you could always pay to switch realms if you really feel like you need to, but on the rare occasion that you won‚Äôt be playing with your brother you don‚Äôt wanna have a queue to deal with
---
Oyyyy same. My poor wife.
---
The way the game is designed will force you into groups with other players, especially on a PVP server. Dungeon grouping, quests are challenging and especially lvl 20+ people want protection in contested zones so questing together is a no-brainer. You will find tons of people to play with by just logging in. There are still plenty of low level players or alts, so I'm sure you'll find starting zone buds too.
---
Getting ignored by people is normal. Not everyone wants to group up. My god, the people who assume classic sucks because someone ignored them in the barrens...
---
Xp off can only play with xp off.

Do yourself a favour and pretend firestones don't exist.

---
That wasn‚Äôt the question he asked though.
---
Yep have to get another person to group with to keep your main in the same layer as your alt.
---
Got an email saying that soo
---
There's a ton of lists for pre-raid and P1 BIS for PvE gear, but are there any lists for PvP specific gear? I know for the most part they're the same but some items or set bonuses can differ.
---
The shout that buffs your teams attack power actually makes a lot of threat, try spamming that (even when they already have the buff).
---
I think this is a non issue.  After 3 mages, there simply isn‚Äôt room for a rogue in the first place.
---
It also depends on the time period.  
---
It was mainly just a handbook how to manage a land and what is courtesy when dealing with high class. It later was romanticized into knight being basically being superheroes.
---
Level 19 twink caster BiS.  So you may have missed out on a good chunk of change down the road but I wouldn't worry about it.  Now your character has a great set of leg armor that will last you for several levels.
---
They fixed it recently.
---
Halfway through the dungeon someone dies. "I am a healer not a resurrecter!!!1! I will not be resurrecting anyone without a mandatory +5 to all rolls!"
---
In retail you lose abilities if you change specs, you wont have a taunt as dps spec, but you can switch them on the go.

I have the same problem but with my one year old daughter. She clicks all the keys and moves the mouse.

Make sure your group knows it's not a cleave run. There's a lot of shitty DPS out there that cleave immediately because of the new leveling meta. Make a skull macro and use it often to help your DPS focus targets. If that mage or warrior still go apeshit cleaving then boot their ass.
---
Your graph shows at least 7 servers where alliance is at 33%..
---
No issue just low effort sarcasm. People act like WW axe is the best weapon in the game
---
Pretty sure there's actually some non-brazillians in the guild. They've been recruiting 60's pretty hard.
---
Nah, that would be like losing sp when you die.

Ships in eve are like consumables in wow.

Duskwood with heavy rain is perfect.

Don't think anyone thinks that, It's the best weapon at lvl 30, and probably until lvl 40+

I started raiding because I saw a druid with Finkle's Lava Dredger while questing in Feralas. I even put it as my goal in my guild application. WoW was my first mmo and I didn't have any raiding experience but I wanted my stupid druid set and the world's coolest mace.
---
In all fairness

Demon hunters and Dk were originally planned for vanilla

I was still playing DOS games in 1st grade...
---
This is where you post your source, not just say ‚Äúnuh-uh!‚Äù
---
Nice. To weak atm but still
---
Because the dungeons are very easy. Don't really need tank to hold aggro entire time.

It's been downvoted quite a bit, too. I've kept an eye on it because it's my second Reddit post ever and the first that more than like 2 people have interacted with. Right from the start I would consistently see the total go up and then down again. I just now saw it go from 111 to 107 to 104. Like, what a weird thing to waste your mental energy on actively disliking.
---
That cat could RP as a imp mother!
---
Shaman tanks work fine for dungeons. Raids the get fucking destroyed. They can barely tank the 20 man raid trash.
---
Was hordies on whitemane and all of the alliance peeps started a raid to reclaim the yeti cave. We ended up pushing them back but the hordies formed their own raid and we had fought so hard for almost an hour it felt just like PvP again. It was so good.
---
It's not ruining any economy. It's free market.
---
Your prices are BS? Sell on a good price or don't sell at all.
---
A bad economy is where prices are on the goddamn sky and sellers in the AH have so much wealth piled up they can just buy everything cheap and resell them for more and more insane prices.
---
Nobody is forced to buy your overpriced product when it is the exact same quality as anyone else's.

Someone in my Wailing Caverns group said that it'd be 20 minutes. I laughed.

32 night elf druid on Benediction. Looking for a guild that focuses on leveling, dungeons, and in general is not rushing to 60. I love tanking dungeons so far, but I am looking to start healing too. In summary, I‚Äôm looking for laid back folks who won‚Äôt mind me taking things slow while I learn to tank/heal throughout the leveling process.

Did this today.  Told a guy I was catching up to him.  Such a hilarious random thing to say to a person.  I had a short conversation with him as we waited to fly from half a continent away from our start.

People are just better when there is a sense of need to be personable and interact in a positive fashion with others, when the social aspects of the game take a backseat to a cold machine like lfg/lfr the necessity to depend on the contacts you've made impacts the tone of the game.
---
I was ecstatic when the made LFG, but it had the unintentional side effect of making developing a rapport with real people unnecessary, and we all became social indominus rexes.  Kill stuff, don't talk, then leave.

\#NOCHANGES
---
Welcome to Vanilla, are you new here?
---
basically half the Alliance on Stalagg
---
literally just logged off because someone is doing this LMAO
---
Which is why I'm on a PvE server and loving every minute of it. I did PvP server 1-60 over a decade ago. Never again.
---
Oh yeah forgot vanilla was this perfect bug free game....
---
Hell yeah
---
 Congrats man
---
I got fishing, cooking, and first aid done really early too
---
Lol, you so asked for it and takING a spirit rez is like a gold metal for campers. You had it coming.
---
"...and then 5 of us jumped him when he had two mobs on him, and he only managed to kill one of us! Hah! We totally inconvenienced him for a few minutes. That'll show him."

"*Stupid shaman, thinking that they can fly in ghost wolf. How high can they get?* Ghost Rider you're cleared to land on runway... Fuck this. See this pile of people in front of you? Bring her down ON them."
---
I mean dude we are arguing semantics right now. The point is that every warrior should be rocking SM mail from like 37/38-45ish. It's really good. That's it. The op of this little thread seemed to think that he should strictly use plate, which isn't the case. That's it.
---
The elves ok I can see that 
---
But alliance reconciling with the undead whose whole story is to be forsaken by everyone they once knew ? Never in hell
---
Ol' Blanchy and I with mana burned dry

I think it's understandable. No one should be forced to play if they don't want to.

As a level 15 shaman outside RFC, someone whispered me and asked me if I was specced for healing.

One of the best humor posts I‚Äôve seen on this sub. Good work whomever drew it.

This is a super sick addon. Highly recommended.

I also complain about my wife but here we are 15 years later...
---
Yes, In fact that‚Äôs exactly what made me think of the one time I got corpse camped, called for help and was rescued by a 4 toon party that proceeded to shit all over the camper and his woefully inadequate friends that came and attempted to save him. 
---
Call for help.

Ninja is the #1 Fortnite streamer and one of the most popular gamers right now. So popular in fact it hurt Twitch badly when he went to a different streaming service. Considering Twitch is gradually killing itself by screwing over proper streamers and pushing borderline porn, it's not so hard to hurt Twitch by leaving if you are famous at this point though...
---
Not true. STVietnam wins that award
---
Half the shit you mentioned doing is redundant tbh. Even chain heal isn't efficient if u don't have bonus healing.
---
Your damage should be quite heavily from ur magma/nova and r1 ES is enough for the casters. Grounding if u don't have wf sure. 
---
Idk what ur tremoring.

Which they've yet to forget, did you play Legion at all? I had every class at 110 and these was shit this cool for almost every spec of every class...

In his defense they've been living in a tree for the past 1,000 years cut off from the outside world. Anything not in the tree is Azeroth.
---
LOL wut? Mages kick ass in pvp
---
Thanks for the information and reassurance. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong, or missing something. With a good setup and 2h combo, I‚Äôll have have threat most of the fight, and only at the end will some of the mobs run towards the dps.  If it‚Äôs not a really clean setup/pull it takes everything to get threat back on me. I‚Äôm used to tanking this content with CC, and maybe 4-5 elites per pack, the Aoe thing is pretty new to me, and had really made me consider if prot is worth a spec during the 5 man Pre raid grind.
---
You think that's bad? Wait to see your master profession trainer. If it's enchanting, though shit. On top of the gold, she demands a tribute in earthen and scorpid lives every time you want to see her because she is in the middle of fucking Uldaman.
---
Clearly you're not a casual player, and therefore are out of touch with which game elements are good for casual players.
---
Nice
---
I've told people in countless groups to wait 5+ seconds to attack a boss so I can build some threat.
---
Not a single group has ever listened.
---
"Im backing out of this unwinnable fight, so now I will blame you for it with an emotional attack about your character because you didn't join in my pitty party."
---
Dishonest yellowbelly.
---
You know what is even harder? Undead rogues and shamans not ganking Alliance players who are in mid fight with a couple of mobs.
---
&gt;Point of the post is DPS numbers shouldn't be gold standard
---
and here you are bragging about "better dps" lol
---
The elves were xenophobic to all races before joining the alliance, which they did in a time of need (well, all parts of the alliance did) during the wars and invasion of Lordaeron. Even then, the night elves only sent a few volunteers to aid the humans.
---
The undead joined the horde because the alliance shunned them, whereas the horde did not.
---
Avoid it? Hilsbrad is a rite of passage. You're not a real level 60 unless you've done hilsbrad.
---
Modern WoW player: YOU WANT ME TO TEAR EVERY SINGLE MUSCLE IN MY BODY???!!!
---
Nah this is every single person who rolled undead. They pick a fight and if they lose they get their high level friend to help. Having made it through stv leveling as alliance on herod, EVERY Undead has a babysitter.
---
You love hard fairies. ...?
---
It's so fucking boring.
---
I don't see how anyone could actually spend their time killing lowbies or ganking.
---
Cast off your chains, fellow Azerothians!
---
Idk, I did the same but in Tanaris for all trash items until I got to level 42 to run Zul'Farrak properly
---
Dont reroll a class to just to find groups faster, you will regret it. Roll the class you enjoy.
---
Accountant Classic. I don‚Äôt think it tells you per an hour like titan panel will, but it will tell you where all you gold is coming from and how much you‚Äôre spending. Keeps daily, weekly, and monthly track. If you‚Äôre just looking for gold per an hour kind of thing then titan panel will do.
---
Calling for help is absolutely okay. In fact, that's what created PvP events like Tarren Mill vs Southshore.
---
But if you complain about getting killed, you probably have less nerves than a 4 years old kid. Just take a 5 minute break from the game, check your professions, auction house, go fishing, etc. They are so much things else to do.
---
Last night the alliance took over gadetzan on stalagg.  First time I‚Äôve seen it.  There is still hope for us!
---
Gore is in tbc not classic. Claw is the only focus dump, but be careful using it while leveling because it will leave you without enough focus for growl.
---
Honestly the fastest way is probably focus on levelling. Usually people start grinding things and take 5-6 hours a level and it's no surprise they have enough gold to get a mount at 40- because if they played efficiently with that time they'd be lvl 44. So their gold/hour player is the same, it's just they started levelling much slower.
---
Of course ret is that bad
---
In your spellbook under all your spec tabs there should be a Clique tab. Open it up and then you can assign binds by hovering over a spell and pressing the button or let you want to use. At the bottom of the Clique menu there should also be an option to assign a macro. (For example, as a druid I can bind my heals coupled with a cancel form macro.) Hope this helps!
---
On a similar note for warriors spamming hamstring will do the same and it usually won't hit and therefore won't cost rage
---
Reading in this sub, I will honestly never understand what the appeal of PvP servers is. Seeing the sheer amount of alliance people when I'm questing makes it easy to imagine I'd spend 50% of my playtime as a ghost. And that within areas that are already overfarmed anyways.
---
Yeah, but not really in a world where a vendor gives me money for Troll Sweat, which I don't even know why I can obtain it, or how.
---
Its not that they "didn't want to". The Tank was the group leader; he wanted to do ZF. He (apparently) wanted to do ST with his guildies more. Sure, you don't HAVE to finish a dungeon run. There isn't anything rule breaking about it. Just like there is nothing rule breaking about corpse camping a level 16 as a level 60 for 3 hours straight. Nothing rule breaking about it, but you're still an inconsiderate asshole for doing it.
---
Nobody "forced" him to make the group. He could have easily said "LF1M DPS ZF, may leave half way through". And I would have simply not joined then. This was a very spur of the moment decision.
---
Rouge is like Dirge. Not even once.
---
Asmon who? I play video games not watch people play.
---
I had a NElf (I'm alliance) run up to a node right after I had killed the enemy next to it.
---
I got the first tap, but he kept trying to ninja it in between my swings. Fortunately he didn't succeed and got NOTHING.
---
You learned an important lesson that night. I've you fuck with people enough they will start organizing a defense. 
---
There's no honor system yet and even if there was, you'd get a lot of dishonorable kills. I saw this happen two times so far, both times as soon as I saw them getting taken care of I proceeded to the next graveyard to give them my own salutations as well. And the beauty of it is, that once I down you a few meters from the graveyard, I call the others over as well, to make sure you're not getting away from this spot for at least 30min. Also according to Blizzard this is not griefing. You guys hitting lowbies always tell them, that they chose to play on a PvP server. Now you're just getting a nice little overdose of your own medicine. 
---
So to sum up:
---
You had nothing to gain by being there, you annoyed people and these guys have happily made time to annoy you back.
---
It's the only thing they can kill.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say ‚Äúopen trade window‚Äù if the person is from the same faction, but I‚Äôm wondering, isn‚Äôt that reportable?
---
That's fucking hilarious. You honestly think this or are you roleplaying as a retard?
---
Who do you think gets aggro when something is sheeped? The sun?
---
wut..... they got rid of skyguard rep? that was like my first exalted, i really wanted that felray.
---
Lol this post is terrible
---
One joke
---
i cant wait to become notorious to the opposing faction
---
the maps certainly look nice, but is there a way to have it overlay herb/ores on it via the "Find Minerals/Herbs" toggles?

Anyone got an addon to improve the profession interface?

I'm pretty much just trying to make the Enchanting one specifically easier to use. Even a search bar would be great.

I had a weird one last night, found a pair of level 54 bracers of frozen wrath in the AH for 13s, it vendors for like 49s or something and all other high 50 frozen power items that are BiS or near BiS are 50g+. 
---
I just assumed they entered the gold value they wanted in the silver section and didn't notice because why would you sell it for like 1/3rd vendor value regardless of its actual value.
---
How very informative this post is. Alas i am being sarcastic and in actuality find this post most lacking. Do you think maybe a description of the issue would be facilitative of further discussions? Mayhaps a debate or such? That would be nice. You could in fact make some form of notation for yourself to remember to supply an insight into the characteristics of a particular malfortune you might stumb across. Thank you in advance of your behaviour modificatione.
---
I never understood the mentality of the idiot that starts a fight over mobs, like the guy you killed is going to sit as a ghost till you are low and return the favor.  Killing and moving on,  sure. But why would you think you are safe to start fighting stuff for awhile in same spot!?
---
&gt; Also, let them die?
---
The human kingdoms were plotting diplomatically to take Lordaeron anyway after those battles were lost. They figured they could swoop in afterwards and pick it clean, not fully understanding the scope of the scourge, and when they realized it'd been inhabited by their fallen what did they do? Declared war on them as well. Short-sighted.
---

You do 1 weekly mplus and you some wq for ap. You do the weekly island quest toowhich takes 20 mins a week.

You can catch things with a lure? I tried in hinterlands from 225-238ish and didn't catch a single fish with lure.
---
I hear you on exactly every point in this comment. That's precisely how the pulls have been going for me while grouped with most dps. 1 or 2 branch off eventually during aoe and im spending the only rage I have on a shield block, taunt, revenge rotation to get it back asap. When things are good and cozy we can sunder/revenge/shout/cleave as usual. With aoe dps speccing prot would only hold you back even more and would only be giving you more survivability which is nullified when the dps end up being the ones taking agro and damage :/ Wait until 60 for deep prot and stay arms while tanking imo
---
Now you know a fraction of the pain Mankirk, a Horde patriot, feels on a daily basis
---
Do you think Deathwing submerged Thousand Needles at his daughter's request? Big if true.
---
No, there shouldn't be any problem. I rerolled from Herod to smolderweb for no queu time and to play with irl friends and I've got level 15 so far and ran into tons of people whole questing. Even in a medium pop server there are lots of people in my level range and it seems really active. I've only been playing on smolder web for about a week.
---
There really isn‚Äôt any falling behind man! There will always be people leveling and when you decide to rush a game like this, it takes a lot of fun out of it! Take your time and make sure you love what you make because it‚Äôs a long grind after 60!
---
I was semi-AFK in Gadgetzan at 4 o'clock when a few horde mages started safespotting on top of the arena and taking pot shots at alliance. Went for dinner at 6, same names still at it. Came back and was DCed, waited an hour in queue. At this point its 8 o'clock and I log back in the the same mages are still ganking on top of Gadget arena.
---
These people must be bored out of their minds that this was their Sunday night

There is a lot of people 30+. There's also a lot of players who aren't 30+, or have alts.

You can also slowly pull them back when they place mines

BIG NUMBERS
---
priests got a blade in legion that pretty much speaks whispers from the void, later on in BFA it end up a quest item accessible to everyone and still tries to seduce you from the void.
---
Can I hire you?
---
+1 for titan panel.  It gives you a lot if info in a pretty easy format to digest.
---
I mean do you expect people to celebrate getting ganked? Part of the fun of a pvp server is that people whine and get mad when they get killed. If that didn't happen, then no one would care much about pvp especially without the honor system in place.
---
Darkspear Tribe is not like the other trolls, not even close.
---
It was always miss because it was so much lower but I'm pretty sure it did.
---
Tons of people reroll. I wouldn't, but if I was that unhappy I would. As long as you're still getting groups and tanking them, does what people say really matter?
---
Princess is a great fight. I love the atmosphere of the open space
---
I have the same empty loot window in Hinterlands ocean.
---
Stay Druid!!
---
I got tired of dealing with that as well. So now I just charge in(if i can charge in) with my 2h pop sweeping strikes, then swap to berserker stance, pop blood rage then whirlwind, then hit my defensive stance macro that puts me in defensive stance and equips my 1h and shield. That immediate burst will get you a lot.of threat. Once your in defensive stance demoralize shout, mark a target skull and maintain threat with cleaves, sunders, or revenge.. The first rotation from battle stance to berserker then to defensive should only take a few seconds. I hope that's not to confusing and I hope it helps. Try it with 2 mobs first.
---
the core game was pretty good until they tried emulating wow and changed their entire itemisation and class system.
---
This,I don't understand this phenomenon of watching others play when I can play myself lol
---
Love it :D
---
Ye but you would have to connect it to character so it made sense to me that wow has some sort of per character storage :)
---
Usually the faction that has the smaller population will benefit from buying, and the faction with the larger population will benefit from selling on it. Obviously not all servers have differences in faction sizes that make enough of a difference so it's a toss up. It really just depends. It certainly never hurts to compare prices to the faction AH
---
If its that easy, the rogue can solo farm all the chests he wants and be a team player in groups.
---
Dont pay attention  to haters bro, just play what you like.

Survive till your second fear is up. Stacking stam helps a lot. Dwarf to remove blind helps heaps. If you're human they will pretty just kill you whenever they want in a game with no pvp trinket and if they're willing to use a blind.
---
Its very interesting. I might just look at creating something. Thank you very much!
---
While Tauren accepted them? Tauren who are all about nature accepted beings of decay which is directly opposite (like fel and arcane).

I started aying classic as a Warlock and this is the first time WoW for me. I love playing warlock but I also want to get to know other classes so now I'm also playing rogue. I think you should do what you think is fun , if that isn't playing as druid make another one until you get something that you really like.
---
Same.  To many times have had a mage come in and aoe clear everything and leave.  I can't kill the ones in my faction so....
---
I had someone doing this on FFXIV. I literally bought all of their shit and resold it.
---
Literally both sides gank
---
Making my way to Wpl when i saved a lvl 30 from being 4v1ed.

Tanking with a 2 handers as a warrior feels so wrong ...
---
Pure ignorance from haters.
---
If you like your class, play it and keep your head high.
---
shhh stop crying. it's just a game.
---
Well apparently he has to. If his issue is that people attack different mobs and take aggro from him then marking the mobs is a very easy fix. It takes 2 seconds and is a core part of tanking. If he doesn't want to do that then maybe tanking isn't for him.
---
me please uwu
---
Yup lol. I'm not sure if many forgot about online cooperation on video games since so many of the popular titles are competitive pvp.
---
The amazing thing is people are getting ganked for 5hrs straight. Usually if I kill a player whether it be evenly matched or not they either run away or spirit rez/logoff After the 2nd or 3rd death. Where are these unicorn players that let you kill them for 5hrs straight hiding?
---

I rerolled two days ago from alliance to horde.  
---
My 38+ gnome rogue had to go.  
---

Just do whatever you like man!
---
Get used to using taunt on CD and calling people out for dosing too soon. It‚Äôs not gonna get better. I‚Äôm currently tanking ZF and there‚Äôs a rogue with thrash blade. Literally all he has to do is sinister strike 1 time and he pulls threat. Nothing I can do about it
---
I got so frustrated the other day because there was a ?? (probably 60) rogue just farming 20s near that tower in Hillsbrad for like an hour. It's not the fact that he was there that made me upset, it's the fact that no one would react to it. I knew he was a shitter and could be beaten easily if only we just had a hand full of people. They would rather be lambs to the slaughter.
---
While leveling I met a Druid around level 30. we continued to run dungeons together, he always tanked. Now we're 60 and he is still my go-to tank.
---
If you're going to expect the group to carry you to the chest fuck yes you need to share. Lmao you're acting like 3 silver for a key makes you the damn emperor of contributing. 
---
You're being a douche. You're being greedy. Justify it all you want but it's a team effort to get your ass there.
---
Thankfully d bags in classic seem to be the minority and I can just ignore the few. Play the way you want to play but good luck finding people to put up with your shit long term.
---
I experience something similar,  but my chonk lays in my lap and knocks the laptop table away
---
Like a submarine torpedo. Amazing.
---
Op had to make up this story to make himself feel better about losing that node.
---
Battleground: STVietnam. Literally just team deathmatch for 30 minutes. With 40 people.
---
Same for me, in both Azshara and Feralas. Only get fish from schools.
---
&gt; But even by classic the alliance seems to understand the difference between forsaken and scourge.
---
And gave absolutely zero fucks about distinguishing between them.
---
&gt; And with high elves still existing in the alliance sylvanas could have used that as her 'in'
---
At that point the High Elves had basically retreated from it, blaming the humans for the desecration of Caer Darrow during the orc invasion, and then Kel'thuzad spawned on them and the humans refused to help. About the only alliance they had was the Stormhammer dwarves.
---
Do you also not understand watching professional sports?
---
But what about people complaining about people complaining about people complaining about being ganked in pvp???
---
Voice acting did stop after Tortage and it branched out into open world with a little bit of hero campaign after that.  It was like most mmo's with regards to polish, wow was pretty buggy at launch too.  It's still running i think but in caretaker mode only.  they managed one expansion before going free to play and rolled out more content after that.
---
So I was leveling in STV on Bigglesworth (Horde) as a level 37. I had a quest to kill a bunch of level 41-42 mobs. a level 60 NE Rogue would let me tag all the mobs and kill them for me. All he wanted was to level his skinning. Alternatively, if someone didn't let him skin, they would die. So he followed me around until I was done and we had a great understanding.
---
that‚Äôs how it was in vanilla and TBC ‚Äî instances were usually single-target. i hate this stupid aoe bullshit.
---
That's my pain. I don't mind selling low, I do mind losing deposits when I price at median, in an attempt to give both a fair price and not devalue the profession.
---
Still using mine at 60. Gandling has not been kind to me
---
Imagine imagination
---
Nyhm was an asshole too
---
This comment and guild alone made me consider rolling a paladin.  
---
Hell yea I want to be a part of bubble fairie üí™üèΩ guild, sounds fun as.
---
Not wrong hahah. I‚Äôve got a hit list of alliance players that I‚Äôll KOS and every ret paladin is on that list.
---
Deleted it from my Addons folder and reinstalled, working perfect! Sorry for the late update, WoW timesink strikes again
---
Seems I am not the only one that doesn‚Äôt like 60s just killing everything on sight for the whole evening? 
---
Yes, I know this is part of world PvP. This doesn‚Äôt mean I should like it.
---
I actually had a decent experience with a paladin a few days ago. I was a lvl 27 shaman in ashenvale getting attacked by a lvl 26 gnome mage, it was pretty close because I suck but I was close to killing him. In comes a lvl ?? Paladin out of nowhere stunning me for 6 seconds and healing the gnome, after which they both walked away letting me live. I thought it was nice of him to not attack me at all.
---
Hunters on the other hand though.... Fuck those bastards. Doing the charred vale in stonetalon already took long enough without some lvl ?? Hunter coming along every 3 mins.
---
They usually just stand around waiting to die
---
I did the reverse in BC with hardened addy bars. On it's own the price typically stuck around 25-30g on my server but I found it moved just fine at 45g. So anything posted 40g or less I bought out and reposted to keep the price high. IIRC 40g was a break even or minor loss for me but was very worth it.
---
It was rare enough for someone to post that my starting 1k gold was enough to take hold of that market until I got 15-20k. (Took maybe a month for the first 10k and rest was a following month.) Not crazy fast money but it was very low effort to maintain the 45g on the AH. 
---
Used that to buy my epic flying along with giving 5k to a friend for supplying me half of the initial 1k I started with. (We also both mined while waiting on the bars to move.)
---
This was my plan. Currently in Wetlands at 25. Feels good.
---
Numbers are straight out of the /who system from both factions. They‚Äôre verified correct mate, you can‚Äôt argue with what /who outputs, it‚Äôs a Blizzzard API.
---
This exactly. And if the dps wont notice the skull what i see alot plan your pulls. Never end with 0 rage but rather with enough so that u can BS big packs or have enough for 2 sunders. Tab targeting helps alot. Mostly if your level is not too low with sunders and shout the skull target keeps attacking you. I then tab target and use revenge on the other mobs since that gives most threat. Other then that behave like a tank. You are the one navigating so be elegant let them know you are there. Keep an eye on mana bars and people paying attention and you are gold! Last tip i announce mana breaks during the fight. Example i see the healer &gt; Dps mana low i say MB after this pac. Beqause if u pace which you should the dps will too and MB can be too late then.
---
Most the times I only see people just calling out that there's a hostile enemy or asking for help because they're getting camped. I wouldn't call that complaining. What *I* think is annoying are all the jackasses just waiting for a chance to remind someone that its a pvp server and to reroll pve at the mention of an enemy player in general chat.
---
All 3 of the Windrunner sisters are married to very similar looking men.  Pretty sure this story dev is just living out a harem dream with elves.
---
Same but, I don‚Äôt understand this. Just spend your and other guy time. U killed/u were killed, then u/other guy come again and trying to fight again, and don‚Äôt get from it any loot, or exp.. imo, useless ‚Äúfun‚Äù.
---
Which by the way, that do is president of Blizzard now lol
---
Just find a new guild and dont feel down, most guilds are better than the one you just described. I bet the warrior and the guild leader are IRL friends or go way back online. Thats why you got kicked out  without hesitation or any proof....I have found that the higher  lvl I get the more saltyness I encounter...luckily im in a nice guild full of reasonable people.
---
MAKE SURE TO LEVEL YOUR NIGHTFALL

Not only is it not ruining the economy, it‚Äôs literally how the economy works.

Well, he is a writer self-insert

*Target too low level
---
Kinda funny this is being discovered the same time game journalists are crying for ezpz mode in all video games
---
You switch to berserker stance? Thats bonkers. As long as the dungeon elites are yellow levels to me, I stay in defensive stance spamming cleave for aoe. I only switch to battle to get my sweeping strikes up before going defensive. Its great for holding trash aggro. I always carry sword and board for when the damage spikes are high/healers have to heal someone else for a bit, but ive been mostly tanking with ravager for SM and Uldaman. Havent been ZF yet but I will probably specc into prot soon, since Im gonna be a tank later on anyways.

QQ BITCH
---
Without doing hillsbrad and it seems skipping STV as well you will not be a me to quest in Tanaris. Maybe Desolace but God dammit that place sucks I wish my server had more horde willing to fight VS Alliance. Thunderfury btw which seems to be a 50/50 server but the horde don't want to fight.
---
Without impacting gameplay. Literally makes it harder for one faction to even play the game because they will have more queues than the other faction.
---
I would say that is impacting gameplay greatly yea it probably sucks being the less dominant faction on an unbalanced server but this wont solve the queue issue at all and would only piss people off.
---
literally always hide cloak and helm 100% of the time, dont know why people show them
---
I don't get it. You get discouraged from playing because noobs dont understand that druids can tank and heal? Id never bring a druid healer without a paladin in the group though. No rez is too annoying for me. But id bring a tank druid or even a dps druid no problem.
---
The Ashbringer in Legion whispered unique voicelines from Tirion to you, and many artifacts had unqiue dialogue with NPCs tied to them.
---
You don't need a macro, just go into keybindings and set it. All raid marks can be bound directly to a key.
---
On my server there is more alliance than horde yet we still murder them so it's not really a problem yet
---
What is that monkey on your minimap?
---
that's exactly why i'm using linux. switched a few months ago and will never go back to windows.
---
Why doesn't blizzard fix this ganking behavior? It seems like it would cause a lot of shitty behaviour
---
THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A LAST RESORT REASON FOR A LICH KING EXPANSION.
---
When that happens to me repeatedly on the same auction I often bid item value and vendor it for break even out of spite. (Unless they really want it and counter over vendor value then I pass.)
---
It's a mouseover macro. Your target doesn't matter in this scenario. If you want to heal yourself, hover your mouse over your unit frame and press the heal. 
---
In your other example, just stop targeting the enemy and it will work just fine.
---
Or other OS
---
Same for RP realms... if your name is "Cheekslaps" or "Hunterlawlz" don't whine in trade about your forced name change... lol
---
Did anyone actually think blizzard would suspend so many players that queues would go down? that‚Äôs hilarious
---

You can replace entire model categories in your wow directory which can get you to some pretty cool spots that aren't in the game yet ( the devs placed the models in the folders for whatever reason). If you do some searching around you will find guides on how to do this. Wow exploration in vanilla wasn't a bannable offence back in the day, I'm unsure how blizzard looks at it nowadays.
---
You don't really need sources. Look at the prices of that shit in the store. Look for estimates on BFA subscriptions. I don't think you realize how massive of a market there is for the 1% of gamers who are whales.
---
The mobile market literally revolves around them. Which by the way blizzard is frantically trying to enter that market. Why do you think they would do that?
---
Because they've discovered it's power through their in-game microtransations
---
My friends and I did 20 pushups per death..... I play a warrior..... I did a LOT of pushups...
---
So, you think you do but you don't?
---
:thinking:
---
she just got fucking dunked on
---
Sounds like *influencer obsession* to me.
---

---
Okay but that has nothing to do with blizzard forgetting or not? Are you trying to move the goalpost or change the argument?
---
Shouldn't this stuff be kept to the Realm specific Subreddits?

Don't threaten me with a good time

Just one quest to talk to a goblin in Booty Bay. At least that's how it is now.

But does it?

Of course it‚Äôs a night elf hunter lol
---
Any good buff timer addons out there? Looked at a few of the top ones on curse and they were all ridiculous to set up lol. I used to use buffalo on private servers and it was simple and worked great. Something similar would be much appreciated.
---
it showed as installed on twitch this morning! it updated fine on twitch.
---
Oh good to know thanks my dude

Wasn't that Onyxia?

Who the fuck is even using meters that early? Those are the type of people I actively avoid.
---
Ooo I gotta snag benikUI.
---
Swear it was MC..
---
I do like sandwiches.
---
I use the hovercast setting, so when my mouse hovers over one of my party member's frames whatever spell I cast will land on them. That way you can cast shadow word pain and wand your enemy and heal without changing who you are targeting.
---
My girlfriend tried that with me out of nowhere the other day. Scared the shit out of me since she didn't warn me.
---
I never thought about trying it during flight paths. I'll see if she's up for it.
---
&gt;	Literally makes it harder for one faction to even play
---
Maybe for an individual player, but as a whole it does the exact opposite of this.
---
&gt;	this wont solve the queue issue at all
---
I think you misunderstood my post. This is not trying to solve any ‚Äúqueue issue‚Äù.
---
oh! How many years did you serve for? Machine runner sounds like real hard work. 
---
I hope you were able to claim some workers compensation because of it. That is a real work related injury.
---
I'm in Canada and on a 1.5 years waitlist for the surgery. I should get a call within 4 months I think.

Very happy for you that you got to see the best for your shoulder and I hope it recovers quick.

This *is* a "naxx was wotlk" joke right?

You can do that using tabs with the default chat system. Right click, add tab. Then in the tab settings, you can specify which chat you want to show in that window. I have General, Looking For Group, and Trade in separate tabs. :)
---
To be fair, if you are in a zone half your level, killing lowbies, you don‚Äôt exactly have the moral high ground to be complaining about people being mad. You‚Äôre being a dick for the sake of being a dick and calling it ‚Äúlolpvp‚Äù

You can see how thrilling it is to kill someone who can't even react to your attack, since he's desperately mashing buttons as well.

---
Yea maybe, prolly just couse i try to play as much as possible and beeing a daddy the same time. Im not doing so bad im 56 right now.
---
Huge tip is to not rush it. You need A LOT of materials to level blacksmithing and you should try to get as much skill points from stones that you can until you need to use bars to get you high enough to use the next stones
---
Well technically it was, it's just corrupted
---
Feel you, princess pounded us pretty hard as well.
---
It was so exciting!
---
I prefer classic but we should have BC balancing polled to the community, no outlands or flying mounts, just balance changes would be good
---
Seriously as a lvl 29 warrior absolutely any thing helps. Leveling this warrior is a bitch.  I used to play an end game 60 warrior back in vanilla but damn I forgor whatever a pain it was to level them
---
Yeah, on HWL people really take their time to level. Doesn't mean we aren't getting there.
---
Heroic Strike should only be used as a rage dump, when you are close to capping your rage. I actually found Slam to be quite useful before I got Mortal Strike. As long as you Slam immediately following an auto attack, especially with a slow weapon, it will effectively speed up your auto attacks and Slam hits harder than a normal auto of course. I'm not sure how that compares with Sunder Armor though.
---
Its better for you if you find a different guild with people who are old enough to deal with something like this properly.
---
If your old guild wants to be the "jerk dick do what I say or I kick you" toxic guild of people who yet have to grow up, leave them alone in their happyland.
---
I had a similar experience, BRD level 54 me as a healer, warrior with the aoe armory axe is the "tank", he pulls like 2 pats of dogs and 2 iron dwarfs, I had to pump all my mana into him after the battle I sit down trying to drink but he charged instantly into the next pack and even pulling the third dogpat, he obviously dies and instantly spams chat
---
healer afk?
---
wtf?
---
stupid?
---
do your job shithead
---
And after I wrote "no mana sry" he removed me from the group.
---
Some people just dont fit into this co-op multiplayer game but what can you do about it? For one idiot I have had multiple great experiences as well where people told me "great job healer" "nice healing" and some tank even said "guys give this healer some gold for water, he is a good guy" in a situation where we had no mage and I bought 80 water myself to get through sunken temple.
---
So dont stick with the negative, stick with the positive.

I'm really happy it blew up so much. Good times.
---
Safe travels!
---
I'm a shadow, i can't heal. But i do gank enemy lowbies passing by. Doing my part.
---
That's not a good title.
---
might as well kill some lowibes in hillsbrad before you go to the other zones and are outnumbered 2:1
---
You get a cutscene with Fairbanks too, the sword returns him to life and he tells you a big lore dump and tells you that the key to reforge the Ashbringer is in Outland
---
Hiya, looking for the following specific name:
---
Name: Alcyone  
---
Server: Benediction-Alliance  
---
Would be fine with in game gold trade.
---
Ganking and camping lowbies doing quests is basically griefing. Griefing is allowed in PvP servers. Don't roll on PvP servers if you don't want to deal with griefing. Griefing is a shit thing to do and some just want to see the world burn, because they were mistreated as children.
---
It's quite simple really. Fucked up people are a disease even in the real world and their behaviour gets to  spread like an epidemic when no one has immunity to it. Only way to avoid it is to get a new ruleset and roll your toons on pve.
---
*Cries in single target frost build*
---
Again, they gave zero fucks because blizzard wanted to justify undead in the horde. It easily could ha e been written the other way.
---
I thanks them every time. Make me sad whenever they run a way before I can type it. So then I just yell it instead
---
True, hopefully she'll carry me.
---
you really really nailed it. 
---
100% agree with every thing you've said
---
No, it's referencing the fact that the Ashbringer is referenced, the model exists, but the item is unobtainable in vanilla. 
---
The *Corrupted* Ashbringer is available in vanilla, of course, but this is about the noncorrupted version.
---
Started classic as alliance because of the same reason as you. I was never happy with my character and alway startet a new one.
---
Finally i created a horde char for when my friends are not online. Best decision ever.... ill stay horde now.
---
First tier of shadow talents is Spirit Tap which doubles your spirit when you get a killing blow on mob that grants do or honor. 
---
Healers can snipe wand kills and regen free mana, shadow can keep the train rolling on certain types of fights. Awesome talent.
---
And this is needed om a video game sub? This is the type of shit that is counterproductive in your lessening opression dream because people just want to play video games sometines and not have sexuality or agendas thrown in their face like in every other place in 2019.

Shadow Unit Frames. It offers a ton of customization and flexibility, to be as much or as little as your want. I run a very minimalistic UI, and I've used this addon for years.
---
My classic stance buttons are: C = Battle Stance, X = Defensive Stance, Z = Berserker Stance.
---
You can do that in your friend list
---
Pretty much the only time they shine, in Vanilla. Which is sad.
---
Unironically hate that place.
---
Never even touched it in classic.
---
yep I saw that , but as I said in my post other famous websites have totally different bislist
---
No need.
---
You say this, but in TBC there was a Paladin that camped lowbies relentlessly to the point where people actually put a bounty on him followed by the guild I was in, and about 2 others that camped him 24/7 for 2 solid weeks till we're pretty sure he quit since he never ganked again after that
---
They gave zero fucks because humans in the series have a history of giving zero fucks once they lose. They move on and plot about the next move that will make them individually more powerful even at the expense of weakening their race as a whole.
---
Yes, but that gets unwieldy and it would be nice if something popped up on mousing over a person.
---
Hysterical.
---
Depends. If you‚Äôre 10 is cute to write a comic where you and Batman are best friends and go out for ice cream.

If you‚Äôre 30 it‚Äôs kinda sad.

On my end literally every group i aoe spammed went fine not counting a few with a shitty healer.

Current nathanos is actually a Varimathras (legion one was fake). Just look at what and how classic Varimathras talk and compare to BFA nathanos
---
If anything I think the Night Elves should have a much more alien presence than they do. Whether that means savagery+cruelty and an affiliation with the Horde or such an aloofness and disinterest in mortal races that they make us feel like we're ants, they needed to be something. Not tall purple humans. Making them perpetual victims and ineffective is one of the biggest failings and missed opportunities in the WoW lore.
---
I keep seeing atleast 5x more posts like this. I browse reddit a few times a day and very rarely see any posts complaning about getting ganked.
---
But the last few days there have been multiple posts about this exact same thing. Either you guys are actively trying to find em or I have found a way to completely miss them. 
---
Can't be that hard just to downvote and move on.
---
No need to fill the reddit with even more posts that say the exact same thing as 5 other posts on the same day.
---
Blizzard Raid frames because they "just work" but the biggest peev for me is that there's no control over what buffs are displayed and its limited to how many you can view on a single unit. Incoming heals are also not shown.
---
LuF can do all of this, so once I've got it configured properly I think that's going to be my new favourite.
---
Horde on Whitemane
---
There was a wholeeeeee lot of "because reasons" in TBC too
---
Best weapon in the game if you spend two hours on those tusks lol.
---
Good, means I'm not the only one
---
I went ret for speed boost.  But now I'm looking at 11 levels (iirc) until consecration, and it hurts...
---
The itemization thing is more about appropriate gear for specs. Like enhancement shamans need strength of attack power but all shaman tier sets were geared for healing so they were pigeonholed into that role.
---
This very much so - though i normally send in the succy, dot up and then i can normally pull a full drain life without interruption already - then move to wanding. I can normally kill at least 10 mobs before needing to either heal/eat or up my succy a bit. You can try to do this and dot/fear another as well though it does not speed up the total process and runs the risk of resists but in case you do pull two its working great as well.
---
Just make sure you have health pots, bandages and your healthstone ready in case you need it suddenly.
---
Sorry about your experience OP, sounds like they were ass holes. Don‚Äôt worry though you‚Äôll find a group of great chill people who‚Äôll enjoy your company. Also I think they didn‚Äôt replace you because of ‚Äúdps‚Äù, they probably just wanted to invite their friend and needed an excuse to kick you, not cool at all.

Those people are major ass holes.

Does your phone have an OLED and is it at low brightness?

That's absolutely from vanilla. I've only played since BC launch but I remember this bug was already there and frustrated the hell out of me.
---
How do you turn on target of target
---
I'd set up some sort of mouse over macro for abilities you'd have to swap and lose combo points using otherwise.
---
/cast \[@mouseover,exists,harm,nodead\] Blind;Blind 
---
For example you can mouse over and blind an enemy without swapping targets losing your CP just to CC.

Yeah, fucking Alliance propaganda.

Level it? You need the first level from affliction talent tree then buy the rest from ur trainer
---
I use buffwatch as a paladin, it works great for me and simple to use

Oh they dont have that stun/taunt or something like I remember from WotlK?
---
It isn't because of the players. We have the same knowledge now that we had at the end of Vanilla. Knowing how to kill the Lich King does not make you better at killing Onyxia. Especially since classes change every patch.
---
Onyxia was balanced around 1.1.0. Classic WoW is on balance patch 1.3, which had the older content nerfed. That's why it is easier than when Onyxia was first being cleared all those years ago.

You set up layers so RB for example works like shift and you can use A,X,B,Y different ways in different "layers". Works well as shadow spells are normal and I just hold down RB for healing spells, then RT for buffs and shadowform etc.
---
Facts
---
Lol, those arguments have been made about any class since the start of wow. Or mmorpgs in general. Do you know why people say "just play what you like"? Its because no matter what you play you'll be fine. If you are going to obsess over whats the best for every situation you are never going to actually have any fun.
---
Lets say you go hunter because videos on the internet say they crush rogues and you lose in pvp against one. You will feel defeated and sad. If you go hunter because you love pets, ranged dps, their gameplay etc and lose in pvp, you wont feel nearly as defeated. You will want to better yourself because you love the class.
---
Tldr: play what you like.
---
I have played a bit of starter edition and a bit on a private server before. Never went higher than lvl 22 though. 
---
A friend who is very passionate about WoW got me interested and decided to subscribe for Classic about last weekend. So far only level 11 since I get to play maybe 1-2 hours a day, if I'm lucky.
---
But the experience itself: 
---
* Compared to retail the people seem to be way more active. I end up in a group doing quests every time I'm playing. This never happened in retail nor private servers.
---
* The idea of 'your server' itself is very appealing to me. Reminds me of TF2 days when I would log on to my regular server with the regular players. (AFAIK this feature is 'gone' in retail, as in, I don't remember having an option as to which server I can join. Feels much more "matchmaking-y").
---
* The people have been so nice so far. I ask quite a lot of stupid questions and people always help and some even whisper and offer guidance. I can appreciate that. 
---
* I prefer the spell system and the different talent trees in Classic. I really dig the idea of having to go to a class trainer to get your new spells. Almost like checking the fridge if there's any food haha.
---
* People have always complained that WoW had the shittiest combat system in all of gaming but at least playing as a Warlock I haven't had issues as of yet.
---
* I like the world and atmosphere of it.
---
I use mousewheel for stances. Up does Defensive -&gt; Battle -&gt; Berserker, down does the opposite.
---
Hell yeah! Thanks!
---
I'm happy you dislike me, you seem intolerable
---
Or that attackable Tauren in Orgrimmar.
---
ooo whats the loot roll addon?
---
Flaming is usually the first thing people do. However I see you already removed your post. I just think that no, it's not a good idea for Wow, but might be in general.
---
Sounds like a dumb server name
---
Yeah. Old Blizzard would perma Ban the whole Account (Not only Classic but also retail).        
---
This new soft Blizzard with 1-6 month bans is boring....If you could loose all your retail stuff it would scare way more people...probably
---
Luckily we don't need classic design in retail. I'm perfectly fine playing classic and pretending retail doesn't exist anymore, and the people who like retail can continue to play that game.
---
I only wish I could decouple my account from retail completely as I have no intention of ever reinstalling or playing it again.
---
Seems like it is.

---
for you it's not important because you don't experience it so it's easy for you to tell people to shut up and let you enjoy your video games but for people who actually have to deal with this stuff on a daily basis it isn't something you just shut up about. you making this post is evidence that you think the oppression of sexual minorities is less important than you being free from a minor inconvenience of having to think about something important, WHICH IS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM.

When your pet is out, click on Pet Training (the one with the slingshot IIRC).

Sw, xbow from vendor near weapon master. Costs like 3s
---
I mean do you have proof that it works the way you say it does?
---
I mean you can go download a 1.12 version of theorycraft and see that the spell coefficients don't increase after a spell learned after level 20
---
Did they actually say how much dps you were doing? Its a dick move to kick you for having slightly lower dps. If your DPS was half of the others and they thought you were slacking off then I'd understand it.
---
This is correct, I did it during Legion.
---
My son hit 24 today and took his first gank courtesy of the horde in Ashenvale. So glad he moved from Herod to Earthfury before he got to contested zones.
---
I can get that, often it feels like you are doing fuck all when you're busy tapping (even if the mana gains mean you can dump your entire mana bar in a single sitting thus increasing dps) so it's actually hard to get into the habit of doing it. Especially if you're grouping with people you don't really know, and you are worried that the healer won't keep up. 
---
It also depends on spec, affliction warlocks are always slow on DPS, it builds over time as long as they keep all their dots ticking.
---
Yeah this is surprising. I figured this was completely within the rules of the game.
---
As a healer i prefer druids over warriors every day while leveling. They also are great at 60, a friend of mine tanked MC yesterday as a druid in his first raid ID and it worked well.
---
Swamp of Sorrows has some dragonkin that players kill. Looking at around 39-43.
---
STV is a great place too, closer to Booty Bay.
---
I soloed it at 28, just auto attacked and healed myself, took along time but I did it. Have some health and mana pots to ease your fight.
---
i heard that naxx geared ret does less dps than pre-bis warrior so ...
---
I believe your word, though on behalf of Reddit, I appreciate your source material.
---
1. Get ganked
---
2. Make naughty-list
---
3. Reach lvl 60
---
4. ???

5. Profit

I'm not convinced you couldn't take out a 60 character on a 31 character if you got lucky and didn't miss the chain.

shut

It was never going to be like it used to be. YouTube, streamers, updated guides, player skill. Of course its not going to be the same.

A bat takes off from the Sepulcher and heads North to Tirisfal. Instead of turning into the sewers it continues towards Brill where it perches atop the zeppelin tower and waits patiently for the airship to arrive. As the zeppelin to Orgrimmar stops at the dock the bat moves down to nestle in the rigging. The zeppelin departs and in the blink of an eye the rugged landscape of Durotar is coming into view. The bat takes flight once again, soaring over hog farms until it reaches the gates of Orgrimmar. When it arrives at the flight master's tower you dismount for the first time since leaving Silverpine.

Someone is triggered.

Firemages got the lamest artifact in legion, a sword that makes the occasional friendly belf go "UUU SHINY! Caan I hoold it? plz??" (I was alliance, it was NOT common
---
And speaking of rare events it was SUPPOSED TO occasionally burn enemy corpses when you killed them, or make them smolder or some shit, but I never even once saw that happen.
---
As far as i've seen you can't really layer hop anymore. Looks like there is 2 layers and there is some kind of a cooldown for switching layers now.
---
It helps to understand how WoW is structured. 
---
Your skills are designed to be a gold sink. If you didn't have to buy skills, you would ***easily*** have enough gold to buy a mount at level 40 and then some. 
---
The game is designed to pull money out of your leveling process. 
---
Even still, if you only buy the abilities you need, sell the items that you get (like cloth or greens on the AH), you should have enough for your mount at or around 40.
---
My success rate with selling at auctioneers market price is incredibly low. Things dont sell unless I undercut and that price is much lower than market.  I dont remmeber it being that bad but the deposits are killer depending on the item. I'm starting to just vendor more now since it's not worth the risk.
---
[x] doubt. I have been doing marketmanipulation for 14 years, that wont result in a ban. You may have been violating TOS by interefering in other cases then?
---
This is peak stupidity imo. What bothers you so much getting asked to do SM that warrants ignoring them? Not like they're being dicks, nor will they message you again if you don't reply. You're not that important
---
To walk there as an Alliance? Maybe, depending on where you're coming from. Running the dungeon? No, not even Armory.
---
spamming shadowbolt is purely something that happens in raids, raids isnt the only part of the game....
---
Even on retail WC takes more than 20 minutes I'm pretty sure. Long ass dungeon for sure.

I had that problem last week in Feralas. I asked about it in /4 and was told it was a known issue affecting fishing on coasts.
---
I came back a few days ago and was able to fish fine. I'm not sure why, maybe it has something to do with time of day or perhaps layers?
---
lol love you
---
The ONLY thing that stopped me from continuing to level my Druid was the lack of a regular rez spell. If someone dies in a place like WC and nobody else in the group can rez its a real pain ...
---
Blizzard perma Banner whole guilds for their flawed technoligy in the paar and this isn't any different.         
---
A 1-3 month Ban is nothing for most people. 6 month Ban (retail + Classic) + deleting everything in the classic Server scares people to Stop using it.
---
Sometimes it's a good catalyst for a high level pvp encounter.

Gankee gets backuo, then so does the ganker. Gankee gets even more backup etc.

---
I appreciate when people do this when I run out of mana during a long chain pull and we end up barely making it without losing people. Had an undead warrior doing that a lot a few nights ago, as he was teaching the other warrior in our group how to tank and he was accidentally pulling extras.

nothing can be done about it because of the faction imbalance.

---
The Orc racial gives you a 3% chance to hit at 60, meaning you'd only need 6% hit to cap out. This allows for gear flexibility, however nothing will get you to the hp cap that the Tauren racial provides.

That being said, choose whichever you like best as it doesn't matter too much.

My guildmate hauled ass putting wands on the auction house and made 30g the first day. Then the market got flooded and the easy cash was over. Silly thing to expect to last forever, though.

Is there any main story quests I have to follow? I'm lvl 9 and I just got to Ironforge and I literally have no idea where to go next. Sorry I'm a noob in WoW. üò£

I just drive by curse em with agony lol
---
True. They long since lost their mystical appeal for me, that they definetly had in WC3.
---
Then bring something substantial to the table, instead of just acidic refutations
---
They rewrote quest to make them more story driven, yeah, it's pretty sweet. If layering is gonna be around might as well give it a use lol.
---
I love camping people who mess with lowbies. They reap what they sow.
---
if by ganked you mean camped by horde for hours on end because of terrible faction imbalances, yeah sure.
---
your party was afk or what? How can they possibly die on dungeon boss? It doesn't even do anything except few farts and rocks.
---
idk..I play on a pvp server to have an occasional battle over quest mobs. In StV I quested alongside a troll (Im a dwarf) for the Zanzi quest, since there was just a hilariously small area to farm the mixtures. We lived together in peace. Every now and then another horde came by and Im sure that troll told them not to mess with me. Temporarily there had been 5 horde players and me. When my mate came over on his druid we farmed that quest out alongside the troll and his friend and then parted peacefully.
---
Fast forward 30mins...my buddy and I are farming more trolls. Since hes a druid and Im a warrior we decide to pull 5-6 trolls at once. Suddenly 3 horde players hop along. I get dotted by a warlock and he gets opened on by a rogue named Cosby. We die. Fair enough, we shouldnt have pulled as many mobs in a pvp zone. We respawn at corpse...immediately dotted again and charged/cheap shot. Its no use. We leave the premises to the Horde.
---
On our way over to Nesingwary we stumble across a couple of lower level players farming tigers. Needless to say, they had to pay for their bretherens sins. We killed every single player that got in our way. We didnt camp them. Just killed them once and walked/rode on...we get into another fight...2v3..manageable...suddenly a 4th guy...still doable...but then...4 more Horde players arrive. We die in a 2v8, wondering where all the Alliance players on our server are, because they sure as hell are not in StV. Moral of the story...Blood must have blood. Whoever cast the first stone might bring misery upon his friends half an hour in the future. Thats the beauty of a pvp server. That being said...camping the corpse of a low level is just pitiful and shows you suck at actual pvp.
---
You can go to loch modan north east of ironforge
---
As far as I understand it, the honor system won't be implemented until phase 2.
---
Any "skull" players who ganks me or my gf, ends up on my "no mercy list".
---
We're gonna have so much fun together later on.
---
You can solo them at 60 with shit gear.
---
Orc definitely has the PvP advantage with bloodfury or whatever and the stun resist. 
---
You're asking about the arms talent tree procs from maces? Yes orcs specd that can proc maces. 
---
The extra skill to axes ensures more hits so it's an advantage of using them unless using a massive upgrade of another type. Orc warrior will uses maces or swords or polearms if they're more dmg. 
---
Tauren are best tanks for the hp pool being the biggest possible. And warstomp is a nice ability when needed to CC a group of mobs for a second.
---
What are those bar adding? The look nice
---
15g on mine
---
A dye system would be infinitely better than a transmog system IMO.
---
&gt;Another thing to remember is that Blizzard tried, and failed, to "bring back classic" during Cata. They made it more difficult to quest, pull more than one mob as mobs hit harder, etc. They tried to make heroics heroic again, and bring back CC. The community bitched and moaned until it was changed. However, without the other missing components from Vanilla the formula was incomplete.
---
That's the main thing that bothered me about Cata. I was SO excited when I started it, especially when I did my first Dungeon and Vortex Pinnacle. We actually needed to CC. Boss fights had mechanics. You had to prioritize mobs correctly. You had to use LoS pulls. You had to be strategic. And on top of that, heroics were actually heroics! I thought, finally, "some" version of vanilla seems to be back in the game. 
---
But then they fucking nerfed it and I almost cried inside. I just thought, why? Why do you feed in to people's bitching and complaining? Ever since, I lost all hope with WoW. I messed around with MoP for a bit, and while the questing / area was scenic, beautiful, and quite fun at times, the game was a joke. 
---
Thank god classic is back, I'm finally home.
---
What lol? Ret hits like a truck, and that's before seal of command procs.

We on kromkrush and I'm granite. We welcome all smashadins :D
---
The one thing I really do not miss is the stupid simming... as you wrote, no item felt like an upgrade if you did not have the other trinkets / rings / gear to combine so it made a difference. Now in Classic, I do know at first sight if an item is an upgrade. And there are no stupidly broken Trinkets with thousands of DPS!

for people who use MudFish as their VPN, what's a good node to use? been getting some pretty bad pings lately.

Season 1 gear being easy to purchase happened in season 3, by which point Kara was two tiers behind so getting into it more easily just meant you now had to complete two entire tiers of raiding before you were with the curve.

There is nothing in Ashenvale for the horde at 30, let alone 30+ - it‚Äôs like 24-28

Yeah, I waa questing in searing gorge a couple days ago and found a gutripper. Auction house mod said it was worth 80 good. Went to toss it on the AH and 6 of the damn things were on there for 30g each. Ended up giving it to a friend I played vanilla-wrath with back in the day, and now I ger the benefit of seeing him kill alliance with it. Worth more than the 30g i would have made, if it would have even sold.
---
30-35 hours probably isn't to heavensward yet, which is where the story really takes off and doesn't come back down ever again.
---
It's like wow grinding, but instead of earning gold you get a pay check
---
Lol. Just not understand this, what enjoy people who are killing of "peaceful" players. seems like self-affirmation ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Nothing else. 
---
I really love pvp, but not when it's one-sided
---
If they REALLY wanted to make these people hurt their characters would be deleted and they be required to do the grind to 60 all over.  With the 10-man method of grinding having been patched out largely that would be a just punishment.
---
Healing generates very high threat.
---
This happened back in the day too - well, around BC/WotLK anyway. Get told you can't run a dungeon because you haven't got the right gear score, but the only upgrade you can make comes out of said dungeon.
---
Then your groups were shit. We literally pulled half a dungeon and killed everything within seconds.
---
This resulted in about half an hour for a level from 30-40 and about an hour after that
---
You legend! I work night shift security and every weekend is so boring but now now i can play WOW!!!

Ya you can
---
There are so many bad new players here , it's more then possibly , I killed one yesterday that attacked my lvl 30 warrior when I was fighting a mob.
---
After 5 sec I knew he had no clue what he was doing... Keyboard turning ...
---
I was gonna say, I haven't been to STV since cata - but I don't remember this place at all...
---
First off, a newbie is very easily distinguishable from an idiot. 
---
Secondly, everybody gets a few chances. I‚Äôll happily explain dungeon etiquette to people when they make blatant errors. If they keep making them, they may also keep their aggro.
---
I do this on purpose. I'll wait until they're close to my max range and running away from me before I buff them, and if they turn around to buff me back, I run away. It's like an impromptu game of tag.
---
Depends on if he is on a pvp or pve server.
---
Do you guys have streams we can follow or watch along while you guys do this? If so, what are they?

Hell, Ive bought out a ton of truesilver ore twice now, because it was listed for less than what the truesilver bars vendor for. Anything with truesilver should be dirt cheap, I regularly just vendor it rather than make a couple more silver on the AH eirh the added risk of losing money on the deposit

Sure, horde are the true victims of ganking.
---
"bodies of gods are given to them by men" can also be interpreted as them being fictional and therefore can take whatever form we give them. This also means that god is considered a subject of our imagination. Checkmate christians.
---
Darnassus typically has a lot less players to defend it, though.
---
Why would you say this? 
---
Name and shame these fools.
---
Classic is more difficult to narrow down from other iterations because it is so...incomplete I think is a good word for it. 
---
For example, let's say you love shaman and you want to be enhancement because it's cool. Enhancement is one of the worst class/specs in the entire game both for endgame pve and pvp. 
---
Most classes and specs have a big ol **** behind them. 
---
Let's use an example with priest and paladin.
---
Priest is one of the best healers in the game for classic, as designed. Shadow is not really that useful in endgame and so so for leveling and pvp. You'll do alright. 
---
Paladin is also one of the best healers in the game, but mainly for tanks. They have great mana efficiency on single target spells, but they have absolutely no AoE healing spells. Prot paladins are "incomplete". They have no taunt and you have to spec a specific way in order  to actually tank (11 points into holy).
---
Not having a taunt makes this class limited in what roles they can do endgame, and getting ready to tank while leveling is difficult because you 100% absolutely must have 11 points into holy to get consecration to make it work. 
---
Ret does OK, and should prob be your go to leveling spec. However, it is extremely boring. All you get is judgement and autoattacks. That's it. There's nothing else for you. You can buff yourself with seals but it's all autoattack damage. You likely won't get endgame spots for raids or dungeons as this spec either.
---
A lot of people who play the game are like robots, they don't know how to critically examine things and learn from them, they just parrot what people are saying is the meta. 
---
Druids are not only perfectly fine tanks in dungeons but they can also tank raids to some extent as well.
---
It's not PvP, that requires another player to be doing something. Its more PvAFK.
---
blizzard just fucked up by going for such few servers with a large cap instead of many servers with a regular cap.
---
Not even thinking about how an Orc is rolling a priest.
---
This is what makes the game. A real world with real pieces of shit in it.
---
We were talking about solo aoe grinding not group dungeon aoe though.
---
Heard about it but when I did the claim was that you lost all talents, not just LoTP. Whichever version is the truth I hope it gets fixed.
---
We just teach you the same way we got taught.
---
hey mate. i leveled as an enhanver, i'm on level 51 now and i got some gear for elemental. i wnated to switch at level 40 but i waited because i heared that elemental gets better on 40+.
---
Should i finally make the switch to elemental? I got the dreamweave set, deep woodlands cloak and 2x band of the unicorn, with a mp5 weapon and shield. Is it enough?
---
I went into Resto that made so I can heal easier in dungeons since you get 0.5 sec lower cast time on healing wave.   
---
Plus the extra hit helps alot later levels if you now are going enhancement. Killspeed aint a problem if you start to use rockbiter weapon while lvling. (Atleast I found it easier to kill while using rockbiter) also you can go into improver Raincarnation on resto which helps alot if you do some fuckupps, and cheaper totems helps alot since you use them alot cause it gives you less downtime.   
---
Less downtime is better than more damage IMO.
---
Thats what I did annyways goodluck on your choices here.
---
Kinda nice not having to compete with shamans for SM gear as alliance
---
 I'm looking for a good guide for warrior pvp, recently found that I can't be peaceful and  /hug my way through stv so now I'm looking to learn how to not get kited for 2 minutes and wanded to death, plan B is to go to lvl 20 zones and try to stop the other side from lvling.
---
STV, Tanaris, Hinterlands
---
Free market. I've been selling all my greens for like 1 silver above vendor price because I'd rather someone else use it than to send it into the void by vendoring it. Whether that means they equip it, disenchant it, or whatever I don't care.
---
2 seconds later he‚Äôs was being sold in the local butcher.
---
Are you sure it's actually flying through the Ratchet flight point and not just close by because that's the route it has to take to avoid the mountains? The connected flights always take the cheapest route, and most likely it is also the fastest. There are no hidden connections, the connected flights are built from the same sections you can take manually.
---
Druids are awesome. I‚Äôm close to 40 and I‚Äôve tanked dps and healed dungeons without any problems. Recently tanked SM lib/armory with aoe group and we were fine. And Druid is so versatile. Priest oom? Pop out and heal. Tank dead? Pop into bear and tank while the grp finishes the remaining mobs. Need some more dps to speed up runs? Pop into cat. So fun.
---
hmm its too rng for me. elemental pvp &lt;3
---
You need to use the new ability with the newly tamed pet some times until you get a message that says "you can now teach claw rank X" in your chatlog.
---
Never had a windows 10 update take more than 3 or 4 mins. And that was on shitty outdated hardware. I work in IT, I've seen some shitty hardware.
---
As long as boss is down and people are having fun, it doesn't really matter. Don't get me wrong it is nice to have druids. But I don't think healing is their strong side.
---
That so awesome of you! I tried venturing into LUA territory a while ago, but was so overwhelmed :/ 
---
I'm proud of you stranger!

Only macro I have is

---
/startattack
---
For when the bodies pile up in a dungeon it's easy to swap over without right clicking and getting a lootbox up. 
---
After enemy and attack there could be another / but I cant remember and not at my pc at the moment, sorry.
---
Rogues are gankers. Don't get mad when people call water wet bro.
---
It would be nice if when you say something on chat that you don't get mocked for being 15 levels lower than your attacker and dying. PvP is fun, but sometimes it ruins the game experience, especially when there is no hero. I logged off tonight because a group of four high levels were camping people in Hillsbrad and nobody would come to help. It's part of the game and I know it and sometimes it's fun as he and other times it's annoying AF and no fun at all. Such is the way.
---
Do you know of a specific spot?
---
Aint got anything better to waste my life on at the moment.

no

Why play pvp if you feel this way? Lol

---
When blizz wants you to struggle so hard they're not even giving you fish for fishing.
---
Yeah the true warrior leveling experience... miss... miss... parry... miss... dodge... parry... and I'm dead.
---
The bug is after you complete the Artisan fishing quest the loot box will force close giving you no loot but the skill point still. Been a issue since sept 10. Personally was fine til last night when I completed the quest.
---
Forget the turtles. The real question is WHERE ARE THE GOD DAMN VULTURES?!
---
I second ClassicCodex as being extremely useful, I also use it for populating chests on the map in every zone I level in. And this already paid off with a rare I would not have found without it.
---
Gore does not exist and king bangalash is just a regular pet. You are talking about both early vanilla and TBC things that aren't in the game.
---
Bite does more damage per frenzy than claw, but bite is not spammable, so you need something like Claw to dump frenzy on.
---
It will eventually go down in time. 
---
One thing to point out here that I always thought was ironic.
---
In Vanilla, people claimed that since hybrid classes could do a little bit of everything, it was justified that they could never be as good as pure classes in the roles they were in (tank, dps, heal). 
---
However respecing in Vanilla makes this extremely cost prohibited. To the point where you can't really freely switch between specs, thus making your versatility nearly moot.
---
Roll on a rp server then or make a group with friends. It's nothing more annoying then beeing slowed down when you try to speedrun dungeons for a item or xp and then getting slowed down by a new party member
---
It really isn't
---
I don't target people. I heal my group with my mouseover macroes while i have the enemy targeted so i can easily do damage. 
---
If i have an enemy targeted it auto heals myself.
---
Confirmed. Rogue here. Love that shit. Keep up the great work boss.
---
Two rogues, then whatever damage you can throw
---
I believe so
---
I do, but for other reasons. On my druid I try to minimise overheal. On my hunter it feels good to be the one who received the least healing.
---
To kick someone out of the group because he is low on DPS is a dick move however. Install an add-on that can manage ignores over all characters and that lets you type in a reason for the ignore. You always meet twice.

I know you pick it up at that camp in the north, but I don't have it available, is there some other quests I have to do first to gain access to it?

I wonder if people just overestimated the money making of skinning, or if it is just flooded with people who wanted it for money. Lrobably a combination if both, but no way are they making more than I have from mining unless they manage to get ahold of devilsaur later on, which is unlikely for most people.
---
Why two rogues?
---
It's a pvp server. You're not supposed to feel safe outside of cities, I help facilitate that by killing people outside of those cities. If you want to be able to run around safely the go play on a pve server

If people would only be a bit more motivated in PVP... I just died to two players of the enemy faction yesterday who were 3 levels lower than me... mage and hunter, no chance as a warrior unfortunately below level 30 as you just can't get to them :( But there were 4 players of my faction around, running away instead of helping - it would have been an easy challenge, but no - run away, do not help - and the hilarious thing, they all died after they ran and split up... just stick together guys. Help each other out!

Where in your nice narrative can we add the tweets about self-insert, how he roleplays as Nathanos in Twitter and that he even looks vaguely similar to new Nathanos model? It seems you forgot to add that.

I think this applies to BRD a lot more. That place can burn a ton of hours of time even with minimal wipes.

They're usually oom or near oom, and if you catch them midpull, suddenly attacking them can give them trouble keeping the huge pack of mobs at arms length. Even if you don't kill them, the mobs will.

At level 20 you can start doing dungeons with other players. You group up as 3 damage dealers a healer and a tank. Once all grouped up, you run to the dungeon you‚Äôre taking on and kill some bosses and trash mobs for xp/loot. In order to learn more abilities you need to visit your class trainer. You need to either make your way to loch Modan or Westfall for quests in the 10-20 level bracket.

Fuck the racials, tauren looks way better.
---
Easy decision.
---
Just horde all around really
---
This is awesome! Thanks

I remember it was like this in BC and WotLK (when I actually got my felray in the end it was pre-patch WotLK)

I will be trying this from work tomorrow!

Hello,
---
To start with, rogue can be pretty difficult at times to level so i would suggest you to read some guides (wowhead has some, and lots of other useful information regarding leveling, spells to use/buy to not waste your money, etc). Also there you can find a couple of guides which tells you which zones you should go (there are tons of guides regarding this). However, if you do not want to rely on guides and try it by yourself, it's going to be pretty rough but it's another experience. 
---
The game does not entirely means killing spider or owls, but you are going to kill a lot of other creatures for the same reasons. Do the quests in your zone, check which zones are appropiate to your level range and go there. Usually one zone is not enough to get you through some ranges. The loot will improve with levels (around 15+ you can get plenty of items that will make you happy instead of grey).
---
What you saw was probably a raid. Players do stuff like that for instances(Raids with bosses), or for different events (WPVP, invading other's faction cities, kill the opposing faction, etc). For raids, you need to be max level or very close to it. As your level gets higher, other stuff will become available (dungeons, battlegrounds,in the near future, raids, etc). You can do most of them except raids starting with lvl 15-20.
---
My opinion.. stick with it, you are lucky to experience it for the first time. use guides/addons or wowhead site for moments when you get stuck at a quest or you lack them in the zone you are in.  
---
tips : Do not train every spell you the trainer gives you, check which are the most important ones (it will save you tons of money for other stuff like mount at lvl 40). As a rogue, try to find weapon upgrades all the time, they are very important (FYI, combat specialization with swords is the better way to level, but you can choose an alternative way if you really want it, mostly because of the sword talent which gives you a chance for an additional attack and the precision talent which gives you +5 hit, which is one of the most important thing as a DPS). 
---
Let me know if you have any questions :)
---
This is false confirmed - every time I die, I just go to graveyard as a ghost.
---
Not really. Faction imbalance on pvp servers is a problem.
---
The only political shit I see is people spamming their particular favorite carrot candidate for 2020 and maga shit, but not often and so far only in stormwind. Just mute em.
---
I'm level 45g and still dont have my mount, but I'm a druid and ain't much concerned about it.
---
Purely PVE Tanking = Troll

Orc &gt; Tauren in PVP and Tauren is slightly better in PVE. Orc best overall option

Sounds like a retail panda if you ask me.

---
Turn down the water settings, lowest is classic
---
I generally agree with you, but griefing is real and being on a pvp server shouldn't mean carte blanche to demolish lowbies for hours on end.
---
Money gets distributed amongst the group automatically and it gives a system message of amount...?
---
Have you tried turning your bag add-on off? Multiple People in My guild had This and it is a Visual bug, they turned off bag add-on and all was good
---
oh boo fucking hoo. Nodes do not belong to anyone until that persons taps it. Nodes are fair game regardless of situation.

What are you counting as the last boss? The escort simply shouldn't be attempted without a high enough group.
---
It‚Äôs a different game, and it‚Äôs great, just be patient and try to enjoy the little things.
---
Best classic streamer imho
---
Just a quick server question. Is Arcanite Reaper worth playing on? I'm just worried about servers becoming dead and then having all that time wasted on a character
---
Fast. You get the same amount of rage per swing, so faster weapon = more rage
---
I heard this image. The whoosh of the miss that I am accustomed to.
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt expect anything new to be good even after classic, they haven‚Äôt learned anything except that we‚Äôll pay to ply the old shit again.
---
assuming you're talking about warrior. when leveling, just pay attention to dps. 
---
when you're ragecapped (so mostly in raids) you want a faster weapon to dump via HS quicker. 
---
disclaimer: this is just based on what i've heard and some basic research since i started playing classic
---
You died

People who don't print screen?

I prefer reduced mana cost for healing than the reduced cast time. If you time your healing wave, there‚Äôs no need for a shorter cast time. Lesser healing wave is there for when you need a quicker heal.
---
What exactly makes it that great of a drop?

This is the fish, the recipe was probably going for 125
---
There are two types of zones in World of Warcraft
---
Friendly Territory - This is territory that your faction controls. This typically consists of starter zones 1-20. So, places like Elywnn Forest or Mulgore. Players of the opposing faction will come up as "Yellow" to you. You may attack them, but they may not attack you unless you are flagged. So in this case one group is flagged, the other isn't. 
---
Contested Territory - This is territory that no one controls. Everyone becomes flagged for pvp here. Think Thousand Needles or Hillsbrad Foothills. 
---
PvE servers do not have these distinctions. PvP combat can only be started if both factions are flagged for pvp on those servers.
---
Does that mean that every rogue is expected to have leveled lockpicking? Because if they tell me they didn't I just shrug. It's not like a warrior who skipped training taunt...
---
I turned all my addons off still no pants
---
Today I killed 2 separate Warlocks (one level 36 not sure about the other) with my 25 hunter. They feared my pet and one tried to use seduction on me but I stayed out of range. Pet took them down after that. I'm sure they could be hard if they're good but the fact that they were both killing lowbies/afk people tells me they weren't good.
---
That's the whole point. Those who will stand their grounds and fight regardless of the stats and rankings.
---
Not really, winning a bid is always more profitable then buyout. If you can get your hands on something that was up for bidding at a low amount, you yield more profit. You can then post it again on AH at a higher price for example, or just use the item you won at below the market price
---
He is a great player, his strategy is legendary in WoW. For instance, if you are trying really hard to farm a mount, just beg another player for it. 
---
Also when he watches MadSeasonShow‚Äôs top WoW players, he wants so badly to be listed. But he‚Äôs just another scrub.
---
If killing someone 30 levels lower than you is PvP then drinking a beer and punching an infant is a bar fight.
---
Yes i know thats where it starts, but I don't have the option of starting that quest.  Is there another quest I have to do first that unlocks it?
---
Tanking is straight forward. 
---
On groups, charge in, hit the targets with an AoE (like thunderclap) and then get to work putting a sunder on each target (tab sunder). 
---
That should hold threat.
---
Go back to retail. Retards. AOE dicks

Twink drop. BiS for a handful of classes 10-19. I'll be buying this for my hunter twink
---
Question, is there something wrong with US servers? I see people talking about being in ques a lot even now, while in EU it is pretty much instant in-log, not that the population dropped, but the servers got way bigger. Thought they did the same thing on US servers.
---
True enough quests give like 20x exp of a mob or something like that.
---
if leather is selling for vendor price on your server, you can practically print gold if you have a leatherworker by crafting gear and vendoring it.. way more than if you just vendored the leather.
---
It's briefly explain in the book before the storm.  Undead join the horde with Tauren help
---
So is training the next rank of frostbolt. So is training ranks of food/water. So is using a shield. Most things are optional.
---
You're really upset about this lol
---
Woah I did that yesterday on my druid with an undead mage in hillsbrad, I finally made it to 40 and only kept leveling skinning and forgot about leatherworking, so I decided to power boost it by going to lower zones and get a lot of leather, there was a low level mage there killing bears, the moment I noticed he wasn't skinning his kills I decided to *help* him by attacking the mobs he tagged, waited for him to loot and then skinned the mobs, kept it up for a bit with him, and anytime another horde was around skinning I of course killed them, my little mage friend never lifted a finger to help them, I assume he understood our sort of mutual agreement since I even kept mobs off of him when he was drinking water for mana, I'd even buff him if I could.
---
Never got anywhere near BfA.  More info?
---
I don't believe so, maybe your level is too low?
---
Lol. I have never logged into reddit on my pc. So for me it makes since to use the camera on the phone.
---
Oh no :(
---
But I only have 200 in fishing..
---
...and you will still end up in Hillsbrad at some point. Once you hit level 20, you can't just quest in one zone for ten levels. All you get is a few quests you can do and then you get orange/red quests for later, so you have to hop between zones. It gets even worse at 30-40, which is a real slog to get through.
---
As a Spriest id personally recommend going Shadowform at 40. You get 25% increased damage innate and an extra 15% from shadow weaving, plus 15% reduced damage taken. The 25% wand talent is honestly not a big deal. I barley noticed having or not having it leveling to 60. It‚Äôs good, but some talents are way overrated and it‚Äôs one of them. Your 50 damage wand hit goes to 62 damage... it hardly matters. As long as you have spirit tap you‚Äôre good to go.
---
Graveyard takes 14 minutes when my group and I did it trying to get the off hand from the boss. We were at the lvl range of 27-31 (27 being rogue and 31 being tank)
---
usually you want to stay in your starting zones until lvl 11-12. Im sure there are some quests you left uncompleted. Try exploring more the zone or use Questie addon, this enables on your world map all the quests available.
---
In terms of map size Gnomer pretty big, but the proportion of it that you actually need to clear makes it a pretty short, particularly if you're horde.
---
* Kill 1 trogg pack
---
* Jump down and kill Viscous Fallout, maybe a slime or two if necessary.
---
* Clear through hallway and the semi-circle up to Electrocutioner 6000
---
* Jump down and avoid the entire chamber by trailing the ledge
---
* Clear final hall up to Mekgineer Thermaplugg
---
In terms of required trash pulls, it's not much more than something like stockades. (Crowd Pummeler is a bit of a detour, but most groups ignore him in my experience.)
---
You won't make it. I had about 35g at your level and only just got enough before a ding'd 41.  
---
There's ways to make money but it will slow down your levelling, so imo it's not worth it. Just keep levelling and you'll get the gold. Slowing down your levelling just so you can say you got your mount at 40 doesn't make sense to me.
---
I think there are pros and cons to both, but I think faster is better for rage generation, which is important?
---
You're retarded
---
This game requires a time investment more so than retail or other games currently out today.
---
I think that the majority of people still aren‚Äòt happy with point 3) and 4).
---
In my honest opinion Speccs should be reconsidered and adjusted in a way which allows us to use speccs which are not viable. 
---
Same goes for gear. If there will be something like classic plus, then please give us alternative sets, equalling the current ones so we can play with different speccs. I don‚Äòt think people would miss the classis experience if there would be different viable tanks and so on.
---
I honestly think it would increase the experience because you could play the game with any class ans specc you want! That would be actually amazing
---
I would recommend trying to delete The cache folder in The Classic folder and See if This Maybe solves it
---
I'm a paladin, I don't kill those who present no harm to me.
---
I also don't end up killing those who do sometimes, but lets not talk about that.
---
&gt; People say "The GM cleared it" as if that somehow washes away the benefit of getting to re-kill the bosses in MC for a second time in a week.
---
That is literally exactly what it does.
---
Ah thanks!
---
Oof , I would say head to booty bay in the mean time.
---
The later abusing wasn‚Äôt a problem for blizzard, the only thing they are banning people for (currently) is the dungeon layer abusing. Unless they did that then they won‚Äôt be punished.
---
Similar. Played Alliance for well over a decade and now I'm playing an Orc Shaman for Classic.
---
I felt really weird about it and still do in some ways, but I'm almost lvl 53 and have come to enjoy my new faction even though deep down I still miss alliance.
---
if you consider that a reasonable expectation, then there is really nothing more to this conversation.
---
Oh, that is really nice, wish I knew that before lvling my 2H sword skills.
---
There are dungeons you can do before 20.
---
He won‚Äôt get punished then, he punishments are only for people doing it in dungeons not in the open world
---
I like it, but sometimes it's nice to just tune it down a notch with particle density option.
---
No problem, glad I could help. Have fun and good luck.
---
Ayy Path of Exile is amazing. What‚Äôre you rolling this league?
---
Isn‚Äôt it faster to from IF yo Silithus? (Admittedly it has a transfer)
---
I fixed his talents. 
---
Maybe something like this?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bZZV0gt0tot
---
They are the same
---
I think only bear form gets mangle in vanilla could be wrong tho
---
it would be fine if blizzard kept the population cap to around 3k instead of upping it all the way to ~12k 
---
a 60/40 faction imbalance is fine when the server has 3000 people. not when it has 12k. layering can only do so much.
---
As a pilot, I do. These people don‚Äôt come in for a proper circuit. It looks more like an ILS landing despite them flying mostly VFR. 
---
Truth be told, they all seem to fly at the same crazy low altitude of roughly 1,200ft, which in my area is pattern altitude. My terrain warnings would go absolutely insane. ForeFlight would be flashing red all the time.
---
What level are you? Generally, you'll level up skinning more than fast enough just on stuff you kill. 
---
I have a 29 rogue which already has 225 skinning (can't unlock 300 til level 35) for example.
---
Screw Peggle, big up the Bejeweled gang
---
Ahh yes but have you ever been in a rainy Hinterlands at sunrise?
---
nope, deleted it, all addons off and no pants
---
Feels great
---
I belive everyone has it. You can get an addon that make the looting process faster (i forgot the name tho), i got it yesterday and it's way better.
---
I think bear mangle was added briefly during the pre-tbc (2.0?) Patch.
---
I once came back from being afk to find a pally 2 levels above me trying to kill me. He must have found me stealthed in the bushes as a cat. Anyway, I shifted out of cat form, healed, and then /wave‚Äôd as I ran off. 
---
I probably could have killed him, but I had better things to do than take the 10 minutes to do so, and I felt just casually leaving was insult enough.
---

---
Personally, screw the BoE pre-BiS unless it‚Äôs that good that it will last you past MC/Ony.  
---
There‚Äôs no need for it. Get the next best or a cheaper item to fill the gap. This isn‚Äôt to say do this for every piece of gear. Plenty of your BiS is from dungeons and quests so I‚Äôm not saying to completely gut your character for an epic mount.
---
If you drive by buff me, you can bet your ass I'm chasing you down and putting water breathing on you.

Destro is your best bet because it's burs"y", and it uses fewer debuff slots.

It could be a Windows issue, it will often suggest you use the same name as the zip file as the addon folder which won't work if it got a version number in the zip file name or something else extra. Windows might also create one extra layer of folders which also won't work. 
---
What I usually do is open the zip file in a separate window, then drag and drop all the contents into the Interface/AddOns folder.
---
So for this particular addon what you want is a folder in AddOns called TodoChecklister and inside it one folder called componenst and about ten other files, including one called TodoChecklister.toc.
---
That may be why there is mention of it

PC's have "immortal Souls" and can return to their bodies after death via ressurection/walking to it. Illidan mentions this to your Demon Hunter in the beggining questline that "You and I both have immortal souls and cannot truly die." Pretty interesting it took 7 expacs to get a lore reason why PCs revive.

Kungen explained on his stream that at the end of vanilla in 2006 the mages got lots of buffs and started doing good damage. Before that in 2004 and 2005 they simply didn't have the damage for the aoe meta... I find it really stupid... this is why unbalanced game can be more fun... if the mages did a little less damage we might not have this stupid meta.
---
I don't even need to see the screenshot. You play on Grobbulus, of course you have a different experience compared to someone on herod or stalagg.
---
Deep Destro should be more of a PvP spec. Most people do PvE as Shadow Mastery/Ruin AFAIK - 30/0/21.
---
Should give your server and name so people know which big bad bag of shit talking horde to look for. Aww but too scared eh? So sorry you keep getting destroyed by a class you see as less than the shitty one you chose. Well, get used to dying in game and trying to talk shit on a forum to  make up for it, such is the way of whiny losers.
---
Was 27 when i logged in last time (week ago).
---
Played on nostalrius from the beginning to the end, and on light hope as well. But now I don't feel the game, this one is not mine. Gameplay is much easier than on Nost for sure. So have a fun guys, wish i had as much fun and emotions as you have.
---
I am a lvl 47 warrior and I am skilled a defensive orientated arms build and I am tanking every dungeon I went since DM. It is so easily viable, no doubt about that.

Good ol' Ganklethorn Vale
---
I'd love to have seen a lot of the 'solutions' differently.
---
Flying mounts should have had stamina, and required active piloting with time-limited durations (similar to GW2 Griffin mount).
---
Hybrid tax was always stupid, if anything - class mechanics have always been the best part of classes - and they should have simply evolved the mechanics as time went on, instead of removing them or making them pathetic (such as totems).
---
As someone who likes to make alts, time consumption is still a factor for me.
---
However my only real complaint at this juncture is that the T1/2/3 sets are still spec-specific.  My enhancement shaman will likely never see a tier set because its not a benefit to them, because they are all designed for resto shaman.

If I'm doing a dungeon and one DPs is just fucking around and never on the charts, I may as well tell him to fuck off since I'll get more experience and more loot for the same effort. You shouldn't expect randoms to carry you. You don't party with people in dungeons as a charity.

Thanks, I am going to use it just wanted to know if it was interface or the addon so I can move it to a better position

They do that even in clear weather lol

4x longer to finish? Why would I want to farm ZF 10 times for a few hours if I just want to finish it once?
---
To answer your question, no there is no ‚Äúmain quest line‚Äù the way you gain xp and level are up to you. You can travel to an area for your level bracket and pick up quests to do in this zones. The two zones for levels 10-20 are Westfall and loch Modan. (Loch Modan being closer to you). I recommend getting the add on questie, it will show you level appropriate quests that you can pick up via the world map and also help tell you where certain quest objectives are located.

I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôve had trouble :(

I get whispers to tank from strangers while questing all the time. I‚Äôve never had any real issues in PUGs other than some overzealous DPS, but I‚Äôve been chugging along just fine. I‚Äôd just shrug off the haters, friend the lovers and keep on keepin‚Äô on
---
Yes I used to play it all the time back in the day! It‚Äôs pretty good.
---
Same thing happened to me but with selling princess runs (Maraudon). Some warlock was advertising for 40g if item drops and nothing if it doesn't drop.
---
I was selling them to people for 5g a run and 20 if it drops. The guy /w about how I was mentally retarded and losing money and fucking over the economy. Whereas I'm pretty sure I made more due to me asking 5G anyway than he did trying to sell the ring for 40G.
---
Saaaaaaaave it. You'll make bank once bgs come out and people twink. You'll make probably 30-40 thousand

Mangle only existed in vanilla during the bit before tbc released when they patched in the new talent trees.

I had fasterlooting, and was sure thats what caused the issue in the first place..  However after turning it off, I can't even tell what it was doing.
---
The Horde are useful for culling our undesirables. That's about all they're useful for but hey, at least it's something.
---
It's like Jordan Peterson said about being good (I'm paraphrasing); you can't really be good if that is the only thing you can be. You're good when you can be both good and bad, but choose to be good.
---
Ah yes
---
Level 60
---
I was subbed to, and actively played the game from when I started in March 2005 until a few months after Cata's release. 
---
When they nerfed the heroic dungeons so soon after release, because they were actually hard and required coordination instead of mindless aoe spam, that marked the beginning of the end for me. I only subscribed a few months, usually not in a row, of every expansion since then.
---
BfA was the first expansion I didn't buy on release, and when I did cave a few weeks later, because my friends kept insisting it was good, I didn't even make it to 120 the first time I tried. Also, all of my friends that had insisted it was good stopped logging in like two days later.
---
I did resub later and levelled my Paladin to 120 and cleared normal Battle for Dazar'Alor once, then immediately unsubbed again. Next time I resubbed was a few hours before Classic released.
---
I thought the game was very good until Cata, and passable way to pass time until and including Legion. BfA was the first time the game was just straight up a bad experience.
---
Haha nice discovered this myself! Cheers lock fella!

It doesnt have to be a rare recipe, everything is about supply and demand. I could sell a couple of gold rods for about 1.2g, when the crafting cost is roughly 30s. Why? Because every enchanter needs one, but every guide tells you to pick up engineering. And if you pick up BS regardless every skilling guide tells you to not craft gold rods. So supply is fucking shit.
---
I literally walk into STV last night at 3AM as a 33 orc and try to kill a single young panther and get ganked by multiple level 40+ gnome and human rogues. Y'all are the true evil of these lands.
---
what leather is going for vendor price?
---
just about any leather that is going for vendor price can be made into some piece of gear that vendors for way more than the crafting cost. 
---
depending on the market, you can craft to disenchant.
---
Diminishing returns are already in, you can test it yourself in duels.
---
I see people other than you saying this, though. There's a guy named Nollie on Grobbulus who says this all the time in General chat. Is that you too or is he copying you for no reason?

Have you been outside your little bubble? People are already complaining about those things again.
---
Different genre, but StarCraft already proved you could have balance and wildly different races.  Same can be applied to classes, but it requires a lot of iteration.
---
70% horde server gotta get the low hanging fruit while I can

Astanaar only connects to auberdine I think.

Bear tank: people are usually happy they can find a tank at all. If you taunt and charge mobs that get away from you, healers will love you. And healer is your best friend in any group. You can also heal yourself between pulls, saving them drinking time. And pre-fight regrowth aggro is always great to use. 
---
Healer: a little wonkier for two reasons - you don't really have an answer for bursts of high damage on multiple targets (like someone asspulling) as your heals are overtime or long casts, even the lower ranks of HT. And you can only remove curses and poisons - disease and magic effect are the worst devuffs you can get, sadly. 
---
You are however the best at keeping your group alive when the damage is steady/predictable, even if all members take hits. 
---
Cat: sadly, not as great as the options above. If your group understands that your use is somewhere other than top DPS, you will have a great time healing between pulls, spot healing and offtanking. DPS is not a cat thing unless you can get your Wolfshead and a lot of mana pots, which is not really feasible outside of raids. 
---
In general, if you're getting shit from people in your group, either remove them (with temporary ignore or straight kick) or yourself. Any people worth staying with will love to have you work with them though.
---
A twink is a lower level character that you gear to hell, typically using resources from your higher character and destroy people in battle grounds with. Battlegrounds aren't in the game yet so if you hold onto it until then you'll make way more money off it.

No it's not, it's 1/100 mate. Few ways to explain it, either:

1. He rolled a number X (given), there is a 1/100 for the other to roll X too, hence 1/100.
---
Or
---
2. For any given number out of 100, there's a 1/100*1/100 chance (ie 1/10,000) that you'll both roll it. But there are also 100 possible numbers, so that's 100/10,000= 1/100
---
Twinks lock their xp gain at 19/29/... and get the best equipment available for that level and then they do battlegrounds and poop on people who aren't twinks.
---
How many tanks have you seen leveling in classic without using sunder... I'll take a druid.
---
He cant. You are in a horde zone and have pvp disabled
---
The highest dps is just to use it on cooldown, but I wouldn't recommend doing it while leveling because it requires the highest rank of bite trained in order to be better than claw of course, rank 1 bite isn't as good as rank 4 claw :D
---
Yeah alliance are the gankers here, this image has it backwards.
---
iirc phase 4
---
these quests were always intended as a catchup mechanic
---
It‚Äôs a term for a level (19/29/39/49) character that has crazy good gear so they can dominate in battlegrounds without moving up to the next level bracket.
---
If i'm getting ganked constantly i will sure as hell bitch and moan. Wouldn't want anything changed and I will hunt them down one by one, but as lord is my witness, i'll rage through discord EVERY time.
---
It's like 80/20 on Stalagg.  I expect some world pvp but its just stupid here.  Everywhere I go, Im getting ganked by 10 Horde.
---
Rogues have an absurdly massive power spike in the 30-40 bracket, and hunters are probably one of the least equipped for dealing with it
---
I tried doing that in GW2 a few years. Back. The supply fucked me hard and I was stuck with a full bank. 
---
To clarify. I do not whisper and harass people...just buy out a market and try to make profit.
---
I'm a holy spec priest, and can understand the disdain some mages feel toward players that just expect you to help them. Don't get me wrong. I'm one of those priests that does checkups on other parties grinding in the area, spends half of my bar to buff the hunter pets, and goes out of my way to revive. More often than not, it makes someone's day. However, lately in the mid 40s leveling areas, it feels like every character I come across is a mute automaton. As a healbot, I can empathize with the vending machines.
---
Designate Alliance as a terrorist group NOW!
---
That‚Äôs all fine and dandy but expect arguments when the healer/tank roles on gear you want. Example, every Paladin and Warrior will always role need on Ravager in SM Armory
---
Nearly killed doesn‚Äôt mean anything. 
---
Nearly killed means you lost.
---
In vanilla it is incredibly rare, if it had dropped yet we would probably have posts about it.
---
Also alliance. When I was there there was about 5 horde and 5 alliance all peacefully trying to get their quests completed. Until a bunch of highlevel hordes rolled in for a few minutes then left. After that the place was a war zone.
---
tell me about the rabbits, george
---
And because of this post I bought one. 
---
I always wanted one of the pre cata ones but on ebay they can range up to 2000+. I'm super stoked they made this available and I'm fucking pumped to display it in my game room.
---
i am getting up at 4.15, too. Working as inhouse designer from 8.30 am up to 5.30.... coming home at 6.30, gonig to sleep at 10-11 pm.. so no probleme here.
---
1, how does hyjal have a map in classic? (genuinely curious since I started in wrath)
---
2, holy fucking shit barrens is almost twice the size of tanaris? are you fucking kidding me?
---
Yes, it drops for non-tailors
---
I always suggest resto early on, it makes you a little more durable and that 3% hit is really valuable, later on when you don't need hit you can go down to elemental devestation instead for the damage boost.
---
OmniCC i believe does this.
---
People hate swimming? I mean that staff Kelris drops kicks the ass of the ones from the dead ones. Stockades is a trash instance zero good loot and just melee encounters. Ran it twice for quests and would honestly never do it again it‚Äôs jist a yawn fest.
---
and the moral of this story is that people generally dont know jack shit about shit
---
Thanks that makes more sense now
---
Orcs genocided the Draenai in order to fuel portals to invade Azeroth.  The remaining Draenai escaped Draenor (now Outlands) via crystal spaceship and crash landed on Azeroth.
---
They were literally just building a base.
---
For "just genociding the Draenei" read the Chronicle volume 2 before writing black and white statements.
---
Cenarius and Nelves were about to end them. Any sane person/group would do anything to avoid death from a foreign force that was hostile since the beginning.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a trash instance.
---
We did cathedral runs in 17 minutes each
---
Nope, which makes AH behaviour even more baffling. 
---
I will often have the starting price on an item *below* vendor price on higher value  items just to make sure it sells and I don't lose money. I might end up getting 1s less than vendor on some rare occasions, but that's better than losing the deposit entirely.
---
You dont bring a druid to pvp because they kill others, you bring them because they are good at staying alive and keeping others alive.  
---
But if you are talking about playing feral with some pvp gear at 60. U might do decent work, but its not comparable to a real "dps"
---
Eastern side ;)
---
Sadly you cannot lock you XP Gain in Classic.
---
You will have to start grinding the shit out of dungeons at Level 11 or so in order to get everything without overleveling it.
---
There is no Need for a XP Lock in Classic because BG's don't give XP yet.
---
The XP Lock was added when BG's started giving XP because there was not way to Keep your character  at 19 when doing bg's
---
No, you don't. You get the deposit back *if it sells*. It's meant to deter you from spamming AH with a bunch of overpriced crap no one is going to buy. It also creates incentive to use the trade channel for things that might not sell on the first listing.
---
I'd rather be ganked for days then go back to thousand needles.
---
I‚Äôm a level 42 orc warrior that is currently arms speced with axe specialization and I‚Äôm using whirlwind axe as my weapon. However yesterday I won the polearm from uldaman, Grimloks Charge. My question revolves around however I should be using this weapon or not. It‚Äôs a 5 point dps upgrade and +15 agi. However with my axe spec I get 5% crit from axes and 15 agi doesn‚Äôt come close to that. What do you guys think?
---
IF you suggest I use the pole arm should I also respec into polearm specialization? It feels like this isn‚Äôt optimal for weapon progression.
---
There was an addon we used on pservers called vQueue, it basically scanned chat channels for lfg/lfm type messages and stored them with the person's name for about 5 or 10 minutes. Also had an interface to easily show if they were looking for dps/healer/tank etc. If it still exists in some form, I bet it would really help you, I got a lot of use out of it.
---
Steam link with parsec is what I'm seeing most people use to play away from home on their phones
---
!RemindMe 11 hours
---
I already use OmniCC, but it doesn't work for me.
---
thanks for the tip with the trade window!
---
There's no reason you shouldn't be winning these fights now.  Dire bear form helps but as a feral leveling I took a dump on anything that couldn't fear me.
---
Hey I have a question for you. I did a ZF run yesterday and the warrior was shit talking the ench shaman for not using windfury totem and using agility totem instead. The only melee in that group was the 2H warrior and the shaman. I thought windfury is something that ench shamans always use, is it wrong?
---
Is the joke here supposed to be that you can‚Äôt skip it? Because that route doesn‚Äôt work. You can‚Äôt go from 1kN to tanaris without somehow gaining 15 levels
---
I‚Äôm unsure about hardest, but definitely one of the easiest to play completely in effectively and feel very weak with
---
24 pally I did mining/ herbing before switching herbing for skinning which is far more lucrative.
---
Stop all the salt about pvping grey's guys and just appreciate this is a funny as fuck charge pathing,
---
Jeeeeesus
---
Does every guide really suggest engi? I remember engineering being a super rare skill back in the day, like people thought it was useless, which suited me because it meant I would often surprise people with the unique items.
---
Yeah, I missed out on that service too.
---
If the goblins weren't playing both sides the civilian population of Stv 'Could' have a chance at peaceful existence.  Just sayin'
---
Yeah could not agree more, quinn is aweful
---
Dude with BoE it is every man for himself. I rolled need on the best twink staff like everyone else in the party, even though i didn't need it. The guy who got it equipped it even though everyone told him not to. I would never be mad except for BiS at max lvl.
---
Doesn't even matter as long as shit is getting cleared.
---
Best we can guess is Bichon Poodle mix. He‚Äôs a rescue :)
---
I will never complain about PvP/getting ganked, but I've seen a lot of players complain about players like me :(
---
I don't go out of my way to gank the opposing faction. I don't jump them when they're on low hp fighting a mob.
---
If they attack me then it's on, if they kill me I'll add them to my KoS list and gank them at every opportunity.
---
But I enjoy the tension of a ceasefire, it makes the game fun for me. Either of us could kill each other at any moment, but we don't. Pls don't judge me for that
---
Dad gamer identified.
---
Yes I have it right now, works great.
---
Oof thanks for clearing that up. I was in fact WAY off.. to be fair I was going off of a 10+ year old memory of something someone told me.
---
What addon do you use to display all your quests ?
---
That's rare, have got to lvl 53 without experiencing that, all I have experienced is passing by alliance warlocks gifting me buffet of dots.
---
Then again that seems more warlock like attitude
---
What if we removed PvP servers and incentivized an opt-in PvP mode?? We could call it ‚Äúwar mode.‚Äù Guys??
---
I normally spit on them after too
---
Pve Troll for berserking threat
---
Pvp orc for stun resist (axe spec means nothing in pvp)
---
Leveling undead have it slightly easier with cannibalize, and wotf if they screw up a stance dance or just want a 3rd fear immunity
---
And Tauren if you just like em, warstomp is nice, the 5% Stam means basically nothing
---
There was a whole thread about not whining about "pvp" on PvP servers, but is this really PvP to people? This is frustrated scrubs taking out that they get beat by people on their own level on lowbies just minding their own business.
---
Truly the RNG gods have smiled upon you this day, or you're extremely wealthy. Congratulations either way! You'll be a welcomed addition to any guild.

It bugs out for me every once in awhile. Also, some quests aren't available in this phase of the game (namely the Morrowgrain ones, or anything related to AQ for that matter.) Closing my client completely has fixed it for me, reloading ui has not.

Makes me miss DAOC pvp server rules, everyone on the server except guildies friends and alliance members are hostile, every city is neutral and all factions(3) can intermingle, was bedlam, in the best possible way.
---
I dno, Uldaman last bit is sketchy too. But yeah, ZF has some rough spots like the stairs.
---
I had a kill count of 22 Alliance scum today in Shimmering Flats in the Kurinaxx server while killing mobs. Probably killed 50-75 tortoises and only got 5/9 of what I need.
---
What if you have more than enough healers already?
---
I meant 30-40 thousand Copper
---
If the auction sells, the auction house takes a 5% cut of the sale, but you get your deposit back. 
---
The deposit is to make sure you don't use the AH as a storage facility.
---
I'm using questie too and it works.
---
Maybe the place is just overfarmed?
---
If it's just one quest maybe that information is bugged.
---
Ratchet to Orgrimmar is a direct path, but it takes you to crossroads, then back to ratchet, before flying up the river to Orgrimmar.
---
Thank you for this
---
I have no idea why they were killing it. The quest tells you to take a picture, and you can run away afterwards.
---
YOU FOOL!
---
You have disgraced yourself, the bond of warriors is not so easily broken.
---
 You will be cast out for this!
---
Right! I just got to lvl 13 today and I‚Äôm having a blast making friends in this game
---
Warrior is the best in single target tanking and boss tanking and have the best damage reducing tools. But he is the most terrible for aoe tanking.  
---
When he is low on rage at the start of the fight, switch to arms stance, charge into group, thunderclap, switch to def stance, keep demo shout up, tab &amp; sunder, cleave.
---
I remember groups were always stressful as def warrior.
---
If you measure using dps you can kindly go back to retail.
---
How original, shitting on a version of the same game you play.
---
Got mine right at 40. But I didn‚Äôt buy any new skills from 32 on other than whirlwind, rend, and battle shouts. I sold everything and got and never bought gear. Professions were herb and alchemy but didn‚Äôt use them to make money.
---
Holy shit, thought it was me.
---
It always baffles me that people will forego ImpCS in an AoE farm build on a PvP server. Do you want to lose your spot to the first enemy mage that comes along? Because that‚Äôs how you lose your spot to the first enemy mage that comes along
---
I'd say 1k at best and that person has to be really desperate. The usual price might be around 200-500 imo.
---

This is literally my goal. I won't stop until I see several hate posts when I Google my in character name.
---
So sad, but yeah Wow is the only thing that can get me out of bed with the depression I'm having.
---
That's a good thing..?
---
So I'm new to WoW in general and am playing at a friend's urging, and made a Human Warlock since I like casters and the class looked cooler than mage.  After my friend tells me to look up guides for my class though I'm seeing all sorts of "If playing a warlock, be a gnome" on each one.  I'm only level 9 at the moment.  Should I just give up on my current progress and restart as a gnome, or is playing as a human viable and worth it?
---
It's a pretty good guide but it's also pretty buggy, every time I log in I have to check things I've already done to come back to where I left off etc.
---
Also battle about. Generates more threat than demo
---
I think I‚Äôm never actually going to hit 60 in this game
---
Part of me wishes it was pure wealth that got me here, but I couldn't see myself spending that much money.
---
Got the chromatic last night in an ubrs run, then got my titans earlier tonight in another run and shortly after went to scholo  and go the supreme power drop.
---
I have definitely cemented my place as the guild alchemist after this, no one else has any flask recipies yet in our guild!
---
It was probably added in TBC where a lot of the classes received the balance, without losing the individuality they probabably should have had from the beginning. TBC classes was probably the last major redesign that lasted years until modern wow, where most things have trickled in slowly.
---
Idk why OG blizzard thought a tank without a taunt was a god idea but that's classic.
---
People ITT reeally have a stick up their ass, it's hilarious. Ganking lowbies is just part of a pvp server, if they like it or not. I'm not condoning camping lowbies, because that's just ruining someone elses fun, but one single gank to keep the rivalry going has never hurt in Vanilla wow.
---
&gt; ask politely &amp; 9/10 no1 in the group will have an issue
---
Very much this

*Sells conjured bathwater for 30g*

Too bad it just randomly ends after we figure out varian was kidnapped and it never was developed behind that. Hello all of Dustwallow marsh.
---
Killing greys is the best feeling
---
This is good lol
---
First thing I noticed
---
What addon is that that changes your font/quest UI?
---
On my server (Kurinnaxx) I've seen two pairs for 850g and 900g. Not far from where I'd expect them to be with just MC out, but they're not selling obviously and I don't understand why anyone would try to sell epics right now with so few deep pockets running around. A fucking Staff of Jordan is on the AH for 140g right now and I'd buy it in a second if I had the gold. Wait for people to get their mounts and their bank accounts to get fat and you can sell rare/epic world drops for a lot more.
---
Arena was a fucking blight because Blizzard made balancing decisions around it. It fucking sucked.
---
awesome. will respecc tonight, thank you!
---
You could just extend your arms to the side or front and do really small circles for shoulder stability.
---
Feral levelling doesn't have enough intellect to keep shifting and healing.
---
Losing to anything as a leveling shadow priest is embarassing, though. Mages and warlocks get tough at 60, though. And a really good UD rogue might be able to rushdown.
---
Stop spreading lies... please..
---
Archaedas is ass if all your group is below level 44 though.  Those 2 lvl 46s made all the difference there.
---
druids have tanked every raid up to naxxramas anyway
---
Case you can't read it says not invisible but invincible. Not sure if anyone already posted this.
---
Good thing I'm not a filthy alliance.
---
It's great on mobs same level or below. Use HS after a few sunders on higher level mobs.
---
Rogue, but nearly winning, is losing
---
Sounds like you're using too much food. Stack spirit and just wait for a few seconds between kills instead of eating.
---
&gt; make sure your bar has all the right ranks of abilities on it.
---
wot m8
---
The only true solution:
---
Talk to your group prior to beginning and agree on how locked chests will be handled.  If the rogue says it's theirs, find a new rogue,  there's likely one behind that rock right there anyways.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty common knowledge now that engineering is BiS for everyone for everything.
---
I‚Äôm about to get some mad cheeks
---
Just play the warrior, then. Way too many people have fallen for the "it's hard"-meme. Be intelligent, don't charge into mobs if it jeoperdizes your survivability. Ez.
---
Also why wouldn't you want bandages?
---
That's totally fair. A lot of the "hybrid" PvP and raid specs are just as bad too.
---
Seen it up for everything between 150-300G (Mograine). I know atleast one recipe that was sold for 175G
---
Soon you will have your WW axe, my friend. :)
---
Yet nobody realizies there are more yetis just up the hill ready to be slaughtered in AV
---
You have a pet training skill activate it and see if you can teach the ability you mentioned 
---
The thing with the feeding is just you not paying any attention to the game
---
Farming mobs is more lucrative than farming any ores at this point. Copper is worth about 90c, rough stones are 15c. Including the odd gem you make 5s per vein if we are  generous. In the same time you can farm mobs ~5 levels below you and even get xp while making more money.
---
r/subsiwishexisted
---
I'm not talking about FIFA or Fallout here. And I am 100% sure that this is false for WOW and so I need sources.
---
I can see at store prices What I see is they add $10-30 item every 2-3 months. Thats about $10/month and this is less than sub cost.
---
It is not possible to be "whale" in WOW because there is no repeatable lootbox cycle. Even if someone buys everything from cash shop (and I can guarantee that this isn't every BFA player), they make from him about the same as his sub.
---
While Blizzard as a company can (and do) make more money from MTX than from subs, that is because of games like Overwatch or Hearthstone that are driven by the loot boxes, but this isn't true for WOW
---
The only really repeatable purchase is the token. But the token is just a $20 sub. Someone pays for a sub for someone else
---
So, I really need sources.
---
if you have a pug in ZF and you aren't happy with how much dps they are doing, finish the run and then disband around them or say you want to get someone else, but do it after.
---
Imagine being that delusional üòÇ
---
His name is Travels, traveler set, its just rp
---
Because I suck at keeping first aid up. Food is ezpz to get/buy. Cloth is another story.
---
You seem pretty assumptive with your judgement. That Streamers have gotten less of a punishment because they advertise the game is a constant thing, even Twitch themselves already stated they have their favorites who get better treatment. It's how business works. I'm not upset, I just made a little witty comment to giggle about. If you guys have to take it that serious and protect your friends you get for money, then that's fine.

Killed 40 centaurs yesterday solo against full freaking tribe of horde and not a single Schm√∂rgekn√§g√∂√∂ dropped for me. How the hell am i supposed to finish those quests in desolace. I hate it
---
Engineering is awesome for anyone interested in PvP or maximizing their PvE performance. Tailoring is for making your own gear. You get a few nice pieces, but it's really not necessary. Use whatever professions you want.
---
Yes it still wasted their time.
---
This is wrong
---
Then don't aoe. Just because there's 5 mobs doesn't mean you have to hit them all at the same time.
---
Petopia, Google it.       
---
Last time I had to deal with hunter pet skills was right before BC launched.
---
Awesome, thanks. I'm gonna install kill tracker and see how much RNG is screwing me.
---
This is the most smug Nathanos he has ever been, his later appearance was so weak I couldn't recognise him.
---
The odds of that all happening within 48 hours has to be astronomical! I can't imagine the immensity of satisfaction you must experience just pulling up alchemy and seeing those flask recipes. Your guild and yourself have been blessed with incredible luck. You must have a lucky gnomes foot hanging from your belt!
---
To add on to this, a lot of people prefer SM/Ruin because it has significantly fewer "wasted" points and it's largely the better overall build due to that, but DS/Ruin has multiple options for which to sacrifice giving you the choice between higher damage (succubus) or the ability to never stop casting and/or help reduce the stress you place on the healers (voidwalker and felhunter)
---
So your choice between the two will come down to whether you prefer max damage and PvP potential (SM/Ruin) or utility, gear-independent mana efficiency, and better threat management (DS/Ruin)
---
He bought all his skills every level

In Azeroth, flight paths take the Jeremy Bearimy approach

---
Ive seen an uncomfortable amount of Orc females...
---
Should have said ok boomer
---
&gt; it's not like they haven't been warning people about problem servers since before the game even launched
---
and its not like blizzard couldn't foresee this and only launched 2 pvp servers
---
oh wait, thats exactly what they did :D
---
I'm playing a Priest in Classic, leveling as shadow but planning on healing in endgame. I'm at 52 right now (actually 51 and 19.5 bars as I'm typing this).
---
I was wondering what a good level is to switch to Holy and start farming endgame dungeons. Would it be 55-56, or only at 60, or maybe earlier? What's your take?
---
As a side note, what's a good place to level at 52? I feel like I'm the only one that really doesn't like Un'goro.
---
I‚Äôm 11 days played and I am only level 54. 
---
Would not recommend a warrior if you‚Äôre wanting a fast leveling experience, they‚Äôre one of the slowest.
---
If you are a Feral Druid: every single day.
---
THANKYOU
---
  Someone finally says it out loud

I suggested it is shorter if they got banned, as it usually is. I'm really sorry I expected you to use your brain and actually use my words in a neutral perspective. :-)

Is this really a thing? I've probably got a good 30 hours fishing in already and haven't noticed this. Most of the time I'm in the bay of storms.

2h tanking as arms is pretty much meta from WC until BRDA though, it's much easier to generate threat with a twohander
---
Ah yes, everyone needs to enjoy the game the same way you do or they are doing it wrong. I personally don't want to push to level 60 by grinding a single dungeon. Have a nice day, fella.
---
I really like someone make this post! Everyday mood even if I was playing 15years ago.
---
A lot of things in game things or community rules are like you said not mentioned anywhere. But it‚Äôs like life itself, rules are not explained and certain people help you when other just see their self. WoW is life.
---
I have played WoW 15years ago and grind to lvl 60 but I was very young and it was a different time for internet (having 50 hours the month for the whole family with the speed of the good old time...) at this time and I was playing on my side and just because on my friends nobody plays WoW and I was not carrying about the chat I made the whole adventure alone without partying, making dungeons, addons or anything else. For a lot of my friends I played with now it‚Äôs seem unbelievable but yeah it‚Äôs possible with this game it‚Äôs very easy to be not aware of certain things. Dungeon are just ‚Äúexplained‚Äù in hostel and you can miss it easily if you don‚Äôt change your fireplace stone.
---
15 years after I rediscover the game everyday and yeah even for a grown adult who works on computer and play at a lot of games it‚Äôs not always easy to understand all the dynamics of WoW classic. For me it‚Äôs fun because it‚Äôs with my friends and it‚Äôs make stupid situation and everyone laugh of my mistake but yeah I did my first dungeon with random people and I did a lot of mistake and they just insult me without any sign of help all the hour, just little mistakes I learn in 1 min with my friends after that.
---
And to be clear the fact you have to be aware of certain things, patient ect it‚Äôs now the things who make me played this game all the time i can. But yeah the game is not very inclusive, and the community not help either. If you see someone open a chest without making a roll just ask him to do it the next time and maybe to share the item he don‚Äôt need or you need, same for ‚Äúninja‚Äù maybe the player don‚Äôt know what item is best for him you can just say it‚Äôs not a item for you Character you need item with .... , if you like this game you have all to win to have more new people on it. Even the term ‚Äúninja‚Äù, first dungeon I seen this world a lot of time without knowing the meaning but nobody explain to me nothing, it take me one time with friends to understand and I never Ninja voluntary again. Just be nice.

Maybe on this r/ nobody use it because they want the ‚Äúclassic game‚Äù but I see a lot of people me included, but when I was young I was not aware about add on. Yeah you have a add on menu in WoW but nothing it‚Äôs explained and the fact you have to dl on other website was not very easy at the time especially when you are not a English native. Without Questie sometimes even with the quest info it‚Äôs not very easy to find the area or even the dungeon entry, I remembered sending a quest to my friend because it‚Äôs just said go see ‚ÄúRandom PnJ name‚Äù and I was like wtf and my friend said you don‚Äôt have Questie? Hmmm what is a Questie? Now I laugh but I was kinda angry at the moment to understand everyone was ‚Äúcheating‚Äù since the beginning et calling me a noob for just not knowing you can just not read anything and look your map. 
---
Just remember nobody are omniscient and you can learn from a ‚Äúnoob‚Äù too especially when they don‚Äôt have the same path of logic of you it‚Äôs can make beautiful connection between you and improving your game too.
---
Black people play WoW?
---
These are resources for war! I let you have that node, and you'll get a skill up for better nodes, which competes with me. So obviously I shouldn't  want you to get a skill up. You'll sell that ore to someone else on your faction who's gonna make some armor, and maybe they will get some skill ups for making better armor. Then they're gonna sell all that armor they made, to other players on their faction who are gonna cross paths with me and get tough, and rough me up and steal my nodes. So forget it! If I can tap that node first then Its my duty to. Butterfly effects ain't happening on my watch!
---
Dreddit is recruiting
---
No - got to grind and farm.
---
if you start a fight  just do savage, rake, rip. then switch into bear and they usually won't be able to do much about it, specially if you have furor as any distance they may get from you will close as you can instantly charge with bear. then when they are low like 33% or less, bash them to stop them form getting a potion or heal off and they die like all the rest, I only really have problems with warrior tanks, since they block most of bear form's moves, priest since I can't out DPS their healing or mana reserves, and locks because of fear.
---
if you are started on, you need to get a distance off, so tauren get a slight advantage with stomp, roots combo, other than that its bear, bash, roots then into travel/cat to pull away.
---
ha ! glad to hear I'm not alone. Exact same addon also.
---
Oh so that's what it was about. Lol. Another comment said "this is not the recipe it's the fish" and I was like... wtf what am I missing?
---
Like... Did they buff the dropchance of those things compared to private Servers? :D You are the second Person I see having all 3 within a couple of days...
---
That is just insane! Congrats on that I bet you had a really good night of sleep :P
---
You are set to make a lot of Gold on your Server!
---
The first part of bringing things to light is finding proof. Do the people telling you this have evidence?
---
Disregarding that you stumbled into me and Jarvis shitposting at eachother here, you raise valid points. They are however speculation stemming from the same roots as "You don't actually want classic" -&gt; "Classic will be a failure" with the latest being "Classic won't last, it will die" (which basically your argument).
---
I'm rather optimistic that there is a market for no changes type pristine servers where people progress slowly, take breaks and come back to start another alt. For these players it's less about endgame progress and more about the journey just clicking with them. This is exactly what private server economy hints at. Everyone played knowing that progress on one server wouldn't last.
---
There's plenty of comments floating around in this sub and specifically in these discussions that adding new stuff is fine only if they preserve these pristine servers.
---
I made a dash for the boat at menethill harbour last night, used my sprint and it ran out just before the boat started departing. I ran and jumped onto the main deck of the ship in probably the last second i had to do so.
---
As i landed on the boat the dozen or so alliance that were also on it were laughing and cheering and clapping for me making it. We then all got off the boat and ran together into theramore, chatting a bit as we went our separate ways. 
---
None of that would be defined as core gameplay, but its just another example of how alive this game feels and the beauty of a really well built MMO. 
---
I love classic too :)
---
Woah
---
As a warrior you really don't want to play this game...
---
So I could survive without getting tailoring and go more for Engineering and Mining as my two professions. I should note I'm on a PVP server right now so I should probably gear up for it.
---
Just layer hop bro
---
And People can get punished by the ~~~BAN HAMMER~~~
---
The flip side is that having a mount drastically increases leveling.
---
Personally i got the epic mount first. Makes life so much better and you won't ever replace it ;)
---
A master stance dance warrior is far more difficult. Hunter is just kiting, traps and sending your pet at the correct target.
---
Lookie here guys, we have a saint in our rows. Don't act like you haven't done it.
---
Or... Call for backup and kill the guy... You're in a PvP server- PvP his ass.
---
With the Questie addon, if you look at this screenshot you can see my tracking settings. I believe the enable automatic tracking option is the one that will help you, but I'm not 100% sure as I had very sporadic luck with any tracking at all before this update, so I didn't even know there was previously a 5-quest tracking limit. If you want to see any more of my settings please let me know.

I must be blind, thanks for pointing that out!

You might say they added xp to bgs to stop twinking.  When you lock your xp, you only play against others who have locked their xp so twinks play only twinks
---
"Bei Bedarf" is a super common phrase lol.
---
Im tired of people using PvP server as an excuse. PvP means PvP is acceptable and allowed. You can still be a complete cocksucker dickface. Just because you being a cocksucker dickface involves PvP doesnt mean its okay because it isa PvP server.
---
I got ganged up on by my own faction for SUGGESTING people dont form a raid party to 1 shot camp lowbies. Was told to move to PvE retail.
---
Warrior is not bad at aoe tanking. There are lots of little things you use to make tanking easier. Pick up dmg on hit items, get some spires from ungoro, immo oil. Hell pick up the helm from last boss i gnomergan and some engi bombs.
---
Elvui, clean and easy to navigate with alot of options.
---
C H O N K
---
Before level 36, SA is almost always more rage efficient than HS. The simple fact that HS makes you miss out on rage gen from your next autoattack is enough to make it useless while leveling.
---
Because PvE servers are usually filled with people like op, who want to quest together in harmony.
---
&gt;In classic you only have 1 or 2 alternate places to level for any given level range and all of them are just cancer right now.
---
Just going to do horde perspective on how many alternate zones you have, not on wether or not it's cancer.
---
Lvl 20: Barrens, Stonetalon, Ashenvale, Hillsbrad.
---
Lvl 30: Stranglethorn, Thousand Needles, Arathi, Desolace, Alterac Mountains.
---
Lvl 40: Stranglethorn, Tanaris, Feralas, Hinterlands(?), Badlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Dustwallow Marsh. 
---
Lvl 50: Searing Gorge, Aszhara, Un'goro, Felwood, Hinterlands.
---
Lvl 55: Burning Steppes, Western Plaguelands, Eastern Plaguelands, Winterspring, Silithus, Un'goro, Folwood.
---
I'm not saying your point is invalid, but there's a lot of unpopularl zones people would rather not go to. There might be leveling zones you just haven't considered. The larger downside to changing zones is there might be level appropriate mobs there, but no guarantee for level appropriate quests. But grinding mobs and making progress towards revenge on the high leveled players who made your life terrible must surely be better than being ganked nonstop in a super active PvP region.
---
For items I don't know if they reliably sell, I will only list if possible to get at least vendor price plus deposit, otherwise not worth the risk.
---
I've mostly played horde and I've seen it on the horde side plenty, but if you play alliance from 20-40 you'll probably see the same thing. Both sides have gankers and douchebags who try to kill you when you're low, you just don't notice them as easily when you're om their faction.
---
Keep it until people start making twinks. That is gonna sell for a ton of gold later on.
---
I'm sorry but how is me being happy about something harming you?
---
No, it‚Äôs been unclear. I haven‚Äôt been able to speak directly to the people who have claimed these things. What I‚Äôve heard is that there is a guild on my server with full groups of players running around ungoro skinning devilsaurs at the same time, allegedly in order to produce multiple skins.
---
Just once?
---
Super secret first aid guide (don't tell, shh).
---
Step 1: Figure out what cloth drops from level-appropriate mobs. Typically wool for your level 16 warrior.
---
Step 2: Buy cloth and level First Aid until you can craft bandages from the level-appropriate cloth
---
Step 3: Use cloth from level-appropriate mobs to make level-appropriate bandages.
---
That's always been the way I kept my first aid relevant, at least.
---
Your comment. This, this is exactly what I'm talking about in another comment. If this Coffe guy hadn't ganked you at some point, everything you mentioned wouldn't have happened. Stuff for people to think about. 
---
I think it's always chill to kill an enemy player when you feel like, just as they can attack me whenever they feel like it as well. I'm actually a peaceful guy and have usually played like one on my main, but when people dictate how others are not allowed to pvp unless it fits their rules it kind of bothers me.
---
good to know, thank you.
---
Since when does /played have any effect on rested bonus?
---
I really wanted my Whirlwind Axe and bought the charms in AH, also been training most of my skiils and professions..doh!  Poor planning basically.  I am so used to retail giving you 9g per quest and I thought it would start to scale like that as I got closer to 40..oh well sometimes we learn the hard way
---
Did they massively change Paladins between Vanilla and TBC? Cuz when I leveled a Paladin back in tbc I never had a problem with PvP.
---
You didnt blur out your max rage  - rip acc
---
Thank you :) I will keep that in mind. I have come across that before and wondered where it was.
---
I've yet to manage, both on pservs, my time when vanilla was current, and this time around, to not have enough cloth from naturally questing to have appropriate bandages.
---
And that's with typically taking a few levels where I exclusively grind beasts for vendor trash.
---
Ive only seen it drop of anger so far.
---
as soon as WSG is out and people need a flag carrier XD
---
Everyone seems to assume that the playerbase all agreed on wanting these things. We sidnt
---
There were lots of us who never wanted the LFG tool, portals everywhere, flying mounts, or any of the other conveniences that have dumbed the game down.
---
It's just that happy players are a lot less likely to go to the forums to tell Blizzard how satisfied they are, compared to unhappy players who are always the loudest.
---
Yep from Donni Anthania,¬†she lives in a cottage north eastish
---
Thank you for the tip,and replying :)
---
cool
---
Nice story. Kobolds.
---
I got jumped by a rogue and a priest at lvl 30. They were mid/low 20‚Äôs. Being able to turn around and demolish them as a warrior was so much fun!!
---
I noticed this after you said it,Thank you for your time and reply :)
---
It's my first time playing on the alliance too, the hatred seen for the horde is pretty much the same as vice versa except I've seen many people also call the horde filthy, dirty, ugly, stinky etc. 
---
At some points the similarity to real world racism was pretty disturbing. On the horde side it was usually just calling the alliance pussies. 
---
Edit: Also paladins were called gay, don't know if that's still a thing nowadays.
---
Dungeon XP has been wrong since the end of beta, so probably.
---
Mine did need updated,thanks for the input :D
---
Then I wouldn't worry about professions at all if I were you. Gold and materials only become easier to come by when you're at a high level.
---
You can swap later on?  Good to know.  I saw something about ability points and a couple of different builds on how to spread those.  Is it possible to do one build, then change that later on as well?
---
Why the fuck are you playing classic lmao? Go back to dog shit retail
---
I am alliance as well. Thank you for the suggestion!
---
Fuck you
---
But actually with how wep skill is functioning in classic you probably wanna sell them as human.
---
Heck yes.
---
I'd give you that but after I noticed it I kept an eye out and haven't seen any Alliance doing it. Not saying it doesn't happen though.
---
lmao at all the babies in here crying about a gank on pvp server like you haven't done it before
---
thank you guys for helping me so fast. This is why I love classic,the community didnt call me stupid or talk shit on me. they just helped :)
---
I'm really amazed to see how surprised some people are by what's happening when I'm sure everyone that played on a pvp server knew this would happen.
---
I‚Äôd probably stick to shadow until you hit lvl 60. Getting a respec at ~54 and running dungeons non-stop until 60 COULD be fast, efficient, and a great way to gear. But you could also run into problems like bad groups, boredom from running the same dungeon over 100 times (yeah it could happen), or maybe you discover you hate healing.  
---
Soo stay shadow until 60, start healing dungeons at any point. Respec to heals after you‚Äôre 100% done with shadow.
---
thanks for this, I'll check this out. Might try a ZF run once 44, and see how I get on with the healing.   As ele / Resto, I am stacking Int/Stam/Spirit gear plus the +healing dagger and off hand from SM.  Have had no issue so far, but will see how I get on in the next instances.
---
You basically won't get access to 'good' feral weapons for a couple whole phases, because blizzard didn't really think in those terms for quite a while in the course of vanilla+ development
---
Never got caught.
---
The bot I used basically allowed you to upload a path that you would make using a check point system built into the bot program.
---
The paths were on a forum for all bot users so you'd often get to a spot and find someone already botting it. If you both botted it you'd just lose out massively on loot and levels (depending on your reason for botting).
---
I used to just make my own paths and once I had out leveled the area or farmed it I would upload my path and allow other users to use it.
---
It rarely ever got stuck. If it did it would be able to work out it was stuck due to co-ordinates and then do different routes to get out. Providing you used a path in an area with less obstacles it was rare you'd ever run into major problems.
---
Once I hit 70 with a hunter I tended to rotate through different areas that were good for loot/gold. If it became too saturated with bots I'd move to a new spot each day. I had it running almost 24 hours a day. I had 2 monitors and it allowed you to run it in background mode so even if I needed my PC I'd just let it run.
---
This is why PvP servers are the best. You're free to be a fuck if you want.
---
Then we all gather round and talk about how fucked some fucks are until the sunrises and it's fun!
---
If you're looking for pure damage go to gnome Regan the second last boss drops bis for quite some time
---
You think you did, but you didn't!
---
Flair checks out.
---
That's a really good tip.
---
Can I zoom out further because its horrid right now
---
This sounds familiar with my old druid and paladin (i could heal myself); i didnt need first aid or cooking.  Not really sure how i saved money with my old rogue.
---
Hah, not even close. Druid pvp is highest skill cap by far. 
---
Only Hunter skill is knowing when to initiate fights and when to FD/trap and run.
---
Dying to someone when they initiate combat in favorable circumstances happens to all classes. It doesn't mean hunters are hard to pvp with.
---
If you mean talent points yeah, you'll unlock one per level starting from 10. You can swap them any time but the cost in gold gets higher each time so it's a good idea to follow a leveling guide and try to avoid swapping until you get to 40/60
---
how the f did they not fix that before launch? the beta went on for so long too...
---
I imagine it will be awhile before we see his mount, doesn‚Äôt the dungeon need to be cleared in &lt;1 hour for mount?
---
It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating trying to complete some green quest for Murloc eyelashes or whatever the fuck with 20 other people nuking anything within a second when you could run an instance for consistent exp and a decent chance at upgrades. 
---
Also waiting for names a mobs with 10m respawn timers. Screw #nochanges, standing around and waiting isn‚Äôt all that fun or rewarding.
---
I aint giving you my actual age but I'll tell you its between 18 and 22
---
Not sit up, crunches. ;)
---
Its actually hilarious that horse are complaining about being ganked around level 20. Try playing alliance. Everything and every area outside of level 30 is SWAMPED with horde. 
---
You think being ganked at 20-30 is bad? Try being ganked 30-60 relentlessly by the hive mind of undead rogues
---
Nodes don't spawn for you. They spawn on the server and are either there or not. Since you aren't the only player on a server/layer, they can't be "not spawning" if someone layer hops legitimately or otherwise onto it.
---
It will take longer than the other classes for sure, but i think it's worth it, one of the best &amp; most interesting classes at 60. Level first aid, you will find more cloth than tou will ever need to keep up with first aid and bandaging is much more time efficient than eating.
---
&gt;Alternatively, if someone didn't let him skin, they would die
---
brilliant
---
Now you know. You are welcome!
---
Does anyone have resolution problems on the phone too? The screen of my PC is not fully visible which makes it impossible to click (incorrect positioning of the cursor) 
---
I tried to change the res in the big screen settings but still the same problem.
---
That‚Äôs pretty awesome. How did y‚Äôall communicate that plan to each other?
---
same ahaha
---
I just bought the mats off of the AH cheap and turned in the quest. Free XP.
---
Kobolds yes thank you!!!
---
I'd add that it's those kind of actions that help drive a deep hatred of the opposing faction.
---
That kind of action can in turn bring a bunch of opposing faction into the area to help their guildies, which in turn can escalate even further into a full blow PvP zerg.
---
Players have the option of joining a PvE server if they want to avoid it.
---
I love PvP servers and would never play on anything else, but I don't really see the fun in just fucking up lowbies who are doing their thing.
---
I knowwww... it was reported but they didn‚Äôt do the fix. Maybe not enough people put in a report?
---
Yeah shit ones
---
One of many my friend! Lol
---
There's no such thing as grey kill. 
---
Only ennemies, and dead ennemies.
---
same here, glad to find out it's not my old faithful mouse
---
Fine, I'll keep first aid. As long as I can play warrior I'm sure it'll be less miserable.
---
Hello, I am no expert, but my advice would be to use the one with more overall stats, wouldn't worry too much about stat weights, definitely not while leveling. The difference will be most likely absolutely negligible. Stam and strength ara both okay.
---
Might be a pve server
---
fuck hunters
---
This weapon is shit for leveling. The level 25 green he is using is better than this. 
---
The crowd pummeler is only good if you‚Äôre raiding as feral dps and have farmed a ton of these to switch out after the 3 charges are consumed (1 pummeler every 1.5-2min).
---
Sounds like a plan to me then.  I think the leveling guide I saw put almost all points into Affliction, but the other guides favored Demonology more for Raids/Pvp.
---
Add a condition to your macro like this [mod:shift]
---
you gotta remember, hillsbrad is our closest FP to scarlet monastery. most of the time you were just unfortunate enough to be near dalaran when a group of 35+runs through
---
You can buy better level 40 green plate than herods shoulder and pants. Helm is different, though I bought a 12 stre 12 agi one that probably yields more crit at level 40 than 1% crit. Ravager is really unique so can't be compared but the mail is easily replaceable on the AH
---
ok, several classes, like druid, shaman, paladin, priest can have healing spells, but the talent tree they choose may not be the best for healing. Ie - Shaman going enhancement. THis is because they dont have the mana for long healing in dungeons/instances. :) 
---
Same with tanks. They are warriors, druids in bear form, and paladins. But again, they can spec to do damage (DPS - damage per second). If they are specced for DPS, then they'll take a lot more damange when fighting elit mobs...which you encounter in instances. 
---
So all I was saying was that for lower level instances, there shouldnt be an issue tanking or healing in an off spec, but the higher level you go, the harder this will become. :)
---
The only person that the field slaves hate more than the owner, is the house slave. You made yourself a house horde.
---
WW axe is definitely better due to the 5% crit and the slower speed. First real upgrade will come from maraudon (gatorbite or the quest staff) or from AH.
---
The secret to vanilla druid is either to have high end gear combined with expensive 2 crafting professions. And/or not going deep into any talent tree, but playing as pure hybrid. You will feel useless most of the time in PvP if you play pure dps wise, but your job at what you're best at is to CC, HoT and DoT, bring buffs, combat rev and other utility. You have an answer to many situations and make it harder for the opponent to fight, and outdoors you are almost impossible to catch unless focused with multiple CC. Use this to your advantage. After all, druid is the best class to run away as.
---
Today was an exception, usually I just take the beating but when I grouped up for safety they were all having none of the flowery ‚Äúpeace‚Äù shit so I adapted. Nothing more scary than seeing 2 warriors, 2 priests, and a mage pop up over the hill. All I needed to do was ping em with a quick fb and by the time I could cast my rank 5 the enemy was usually mostly dead. If not I‚Äôd just cc them until my group could catch up. I might have made some hit lists today. We killed dozens of different people at least once each. Unless you were ?? then you had better dip or get dunked on as many times as you show your name tag on my screen.
---
You could always use the wow pvp sub.
---
I've literally done it once in my life. I oneshot a poor level 60 something blood elf in Caverns of Time like 5 years ago, and I still feel bad about it. I had to stay and /apologize.
---
wtf? what route did you take that got you into all this shit? all you have to do is get from iron forge to wetlands
---
Alliance players say the exact same thing about Hordes.
---
I think that scarcity of rare items is what makes them special. If everyone has epic items... nothing is really epic
---
are we the only ones?
---
Are AH-alts only worth it when you get to higher levels? It seems faster to just travel to the city and sell my mats, rather than waiting an hour for mails to arrive.
---
doesnt renew stifle rage
---
Until you realize that the dungeon didn't spawn with enough Convicts nor did everyone get enough bandanas, so you gotta do it again.
---
For dps, you basically get greens until ZG/AQ40.
---
What server are you on?
---
they do but you tend to only notice the other faction when you are the lowbie getting 1 shot by people that think it's "PvP" to gank low levels
---
I have not used it in raid yet,  but I have tinkered with it.
---
Yeah, I aint got time for that shit bro. Im a wussy and play on a PVE server, come at me brah (jk you can, fuck off)!
---
Whilst I agree with you, I still think it's a dickish move to kill someone over 10 levels lower than you, and it's even worse to camp them for any length of time.
---
The amount of low effort, meme-heavy posts on this reddit is ridiculous. "I met someone really nice" who cares? "The feeling when you hit 60" keep it to yourself.
---
Well thats one dungeon split into four parts.
---
Typical alliance pvper, gank lowbies and only engage if you're outnumbering horde or when someone is low
---
Can confirm.
---
Usually it‚Äôs points because you won‚Äôt win the item. Especially worse if your server has folks using bots that will automatically bid on low priced items.
---
A faster weapon is only better in situations of infinite rage, like when tanking a raid boss.
---
I relate but I'm undead. I'm healing but still shadow spec. I wonder how long I can get away with it.
---
Porky XI is a hero.
---
I‚Äôd start higher tbh. Some people have silly gold and don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôd try 5k for a few weeks, and knock 500g off per week after that. 
---
There‚Äôs no risk of the market suddenly being totally flooded because people ‚Äúcatch on‚Äù to your trick, so it‚Äôs a sellers market.
---
What server are you on
---
Honestly you had him sold up until the 4th monitor part
---
yeah, its slightly easier for me as I have chosen ele / resto, so all my gear is int/sta/spirit with the dagger and off hand from SM with + healing. so i have a large mana pool of nearly 4K when fully buffed at level 43.
---
A few folk have said it will get tougher, so will see how it goes in ZF. I might aim to get another level before trying it, so I get the level 44 spell upgrade for LHW.
---
Or lockpick
---
They didn‚Äôt made it to the water. 
---
Sry for the retail joke xD
---
The typical dumbass reddit user commenting saying "killing grays, disgraceful"   
---
because it's reddit 20 other retards huddle together saying the same thing.  
---
can't we just appreciate the video
---
&gt; make sure your bar has all the right ranks of abilities on it. 
---
Warrior's ability costs in rage are always the same despite what rank ability it is, so you use ALWAYS the highest rank.
---
Sometimes I poly enemy warrior horde warriors and then wand em once they r full HP. Just to let em tell the rest of the horde in the nearby area to not gank me.
---
You're describing a very real phenomenon. If people are solo they are usually peaceful/busy, but as soon as they are backed by 1 or more people, they get aggressive to everything on sight. I've been on the receiving end a lot, but I'm exactly the same when I'm in a group so I can't judge them. Being in a group simply does something (good) to us psychologically, and any form of world pvp encourages grouping. So I don't get why people act so high upon ganking lowbies, think more long term guys.
---
Good one dude
---
Seek medical assistance if you‚Äôre having a stroke
---
Yes, but there are a few minor bugs. He fixed all the gamebreaking stuff the two first days.
---
So others have pointed it out, but if you're primarily looking to tank PvE, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't consider Trolls.  
---
* Berserking: Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 25%. At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 25% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec. 3 min cooldown.
---
* Regeneration: Health regeneration rate increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.
---
* Beast Slaying: Damage dealt versus [Beasts](http://vanilla-wow.wikia.com/wiki/Beast) increased by 5%.
---
From what I understand the regeneration is a LAWL racial and not of significant importance. The Beast Slaying passive would be more useful for leveling as opposed to end game raiding as not many beast bosses exist to my knowledge. Something to look into if you aren't opposed to the character model. 
---
If you're set between Orc and Tauren I'd recommend Orc. The 5% stamina increase is negligible as you consider that it would only come into the equation at the bottom end of your health pool. If it does come into the equation you have a healing problem, not a tanking problem. Just my personal opinion. Hope it helps!
---
Get 60 and solo her.
---
You absolutely need a guide
---
this most certainly isnt true, as I did it last week for about 4-5 hours over several days and was able to massively increase my gold from 40g to 120g to pay for my mount and level 40 spells. 
---
It does get busy during the day, so best to do it either early in the morning or late at night.
---
Does it store account-wide or on a per-character base?
---
I like this simple idea, thanks!
---
Go north!  there's a wrecked ship at the top of the flats.
---
yes, you can get 3-4 poles every hour too, and they sell well on the AH. (neutral AH is good too, as its a fair way for alliance to go.)
---
RIP Antonio
---
Wait it makes sense now, is this why its an absolute horde fest whenever i went there? I literally did 2 quests and fucked off, took me about an hour cause i kept getting ganked
---
- be sure to look at staves too
---
- strength is arguably as good as agility for leveling. Don‚Äôt skip a weapon if it has high strength just because it has no agility. 
---
-yeah Druid weapons aren‚Äôt really itemized well when leveling.
---
No, you kill it.
---
Nope. I got bite rank 3 and claw rank 2 without getting the lower ranks first!
---
Hey, thanks for the shout out! Made my day.
---
How did you one shot him?
---
CC more targets.
---
DPS wait longer.
---
Be higher level or have more +hit.
---
Have him use Berserker Rage before he pulls and Bloodrage after the pull, everytime.
---
If he's Tauren you can use Warstomp and time it to sneak in a WW. Won't be perfect but pretty safe.
---
Use a weapon chain if experiencing disarms.
---
Don't spam Thunderclap. Possible don't even use. Tab/Sunder is better in most cases. Non-elite aoe pulls notwithstanding.
---
Make sure to cut him some slack since you guys are so close to 60. IMO tanking gets easier at 60. That being said, all of the above are still very important. You just won't have to deal with your DPS being +3 levels or the mobs being +3 levels etc. Plus you get more +hit gear. There's other stuff, but basically all of the above.

I had a long conversation with a GM last night. This is exactly my issue, I was planning to use the free migration this week, possibly yesterday or today but I realized the option wasn't there anymore so I contacted Support. I was linked the official post about the free migration and it does state that the option can be closed at any time without a warning. Which I guess is fair to a certain point but I completely disagree with this. On the official forums there are posts about players disbanding their guild and preparing for the transfer while some of their guild mates have already done it leaving the separated and well... completely fucked. I was just told to post on the official forums so the devs can see it and maybe in the future enable the free migration option again. So not only my launch week was completely ruined, I am now 3.5 weeks into Classic and completely FUCKED on a server I have to wait to log on whenever I can play and even if I do log on my friends are on another realm in the mid 50s so rerolling isn't really an option, don't hate me for not wanting to do all the quests and dungeon grinds again in this short period of time. So yea, I feel like this whole thing was handled very poorly, to close such an option without any warning is so... just dumb... It's not about just clicking that free transfer button... they gotta understand that you have to plan these things and do some stuff in game before you do so and some of us can't play the game 24/7. I also know that the option was there for more than a week (?) so maybe we should have done it sooner but yea... Just give us a deadline next time something like this happens so we know how long we have the option for...
---
I did, but I would only go in once I was level 14-15. below that you didnt have good spells and could be 1 shotted.
---
I dream of my exploits being cried about on discord or a forum.
---
This is really cool. Can it be minimised to an icon so it isn't always on screen?
---
Yoir arguments do not deserve consideration, and your manners are even worse than that.
---
You thinking of shield I think. Renew is just a heal over time.
---
Unless I'm wrong, in which case someone please tell me because renew is my go-to heal to top off tanks. (lvl 30ish)
---
Alliance have no honor

Hi, /u/Slimeria

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5udup/enchanterslockpickers_who_have_offered_enchants/). 
---
Funny how balance wasn't mentioned
---
They changed it that completing a dungeon gave the majority of total xp, not mob kills. So you could carry low level characters just by placing them right inside the door and clearing the dungeon with a high level character in speed gear. This is how I leveled up multiboxing teams for nearly all classes before it was nerfed.
---
TBH I don't think thats a fair excuse.. everyone deals with bullshit - don't bring your life's baggage into other's games. His parents could have donkey-punched him in the back of the head before disowning him - if he's a troll I still hate him.
---
You can do BRD lower, if you have a guild group....but for pugs, yeah, I'd say at least 55 before heading in there.
---
That stood out to me as well, I'm gonna start saying that üòÄ
---
I managed to kill a druid as a warrior that was like 7 levels above me. Opened on me with only ~35% hp, probably because I had only 50% myself and he thought it would be an easy snack. White hit crit, hamstring dodged, overpower crit into execution crit. God that was satisfying
---
that would be really sick
---
&gt; Why wouldn't it be in our favour, if we're raiding with our guild?  
---
I literally just told you why it's not in your favour. People have a high tendancy to leave for something better when they get overgeared.  
---
Which is why many raiding guilds never progress and instead act as a supply chain of epics for biggest most hardcore guild on the server.  
---
With Onyxia and MC the maximum of epics you get each week is somewhere around 25-30 in this phase.  
---
So if you put the cap on 1 item each week, maximum of 3 items each month everyone will get roughly an equal amount of items.  
---
Needs the most? We all want the item equally as much. Having bad gear doesn't mean you automatically get it items.   
---
If that good geared player lacks a pair of shoes and never gets them, thats good for the guild. He will stick around.  
---
In a perfect scenario, he never ever gets the shoes. What is it you don't understand?
---
I knew it was coming, but you still got me. It felt like someone stabbed me.
---
Some day that lowbie won't be a lowbie anymore.
---
It's a bit disgraceful to do, but personally I got shit on by much higher level horde enough that I went from trying to be friendly and do emotes and build rapports with Horde to attacking literally any horde I see in my path. Up to ~5 levels higher than me depending on class and number of them.
---
If he finds you with &lt;50% hp, you are probably dead.  
---
After you get out of the stun lock, shield, fear, sw: pain, heal up. Try to run away a little (he‚Äôll chase, they always do).  
---
At this point idk, but useful tips: keep pain on the rogue as dmg will break his stealth.  
---
Always keep potions handy.  
---
Lots of rogues like to dance around you, making it hard to target them with spells, mind flay will always stay on target (and the slow is super nice too).
---
found the mage
---
&gt; Great for those zones where you just wander around killing everything and don't have to think.
---
How do you mean? I have lvld to lvl 35, and lvld cooking to 290, and lvld fishing and firstaid above 225 (yes even the minigame where you unlock artisan firstaid) using only the controller.
---
I don't use any addon to help me do quests, so I need to read and think.
---
2h mace in Uldaman with 2% crit. Also staff off ironaya that has like 20 str. 
---
I‚Äôm sure there is a quest reward or two that‚Äôs better than 8str 8 sta green too.
---
It took me half a day to get them on my main.
---
And on my alt, all 4 of them were in the same oasis...
---
Can confirm this is still happening in at least Tanaris as of 1:00 AM EST\~ Pretty shit because I've been trying to fish while at work the last couple of days to get fishing to 300 and farm up some eels, but NOPE!
---
Would you mind explaining to someone who didn't notice anything bad in dungeons (maybe because I'm a bit distracted) what is this bug?
---
Follow the dream, not the stream!
---
You are trying to make a point here that Druids take more raw damage per hit than Warriors, ergo Healers go OOM faster, right?
---
This is correct -- not to the extent you think it is, but nontheless, but that's besides the point.
---
What you're failing to recognise is that Druids generate tons more single target threat with Manual Crowd Pummeler. This means your DPS can go bananas with their damage meters and never care to hold back. This, in turn, means that fights go by way faster, and healers don't have to sustain themselves for that long, ergo your point is moot.
---
I DO turn while moving, I just use the left+right mouse button while turning. It's quite effective. In combination with strafes you can do any sort of movement, including backing, circling, distancing... it's just a matter of habit.
---
This way I free up some keys.
---
Maybe I should do a video
---
If it helps, lvl 44 is the halfway point (roughly) to 60. So look at your /played and double it
---
Schwingg, she‚Äôs a babe!
---
I did it not 7 hours ago. You definitely do not need to kill it as alliance.
---
You dont wait an hour for mail to arrive, you do other things, then mail arrives
---
Anything new that I missed? Last I saw was that guy bashing Shekiro for not having a ez mode
---
This^
---
Truest and bravest comment ever made on this subreddit
---
I snorted hard
---
Ok sorry, big boy!
---
Do you even tried it by yourself? I made same exact macro and i tested it for a long time. I tried to spam it fast, i tried to spam it slower. I never get more then 10-20% proc rate with it. While i getting 80% proc rate with timing it by myself and using just /sit and standing  in the right time.
---
We're happy about the talent trees, because, like you said, they provide a way more interesting and rewarding level experience. However for endgame, as much as I like talent trees, the current system is just miles ahead of trees and does actually provide meaningful choices.
---
Hear, hear!
---
Explain to me how you look in the opposite direction when running forward
---
Right, by "non-combat Rez" I assume he meant a Rez that has no cooldown and also can't be used in combat.
---
sure, I understand that. but as ele / resto specced, my gear is all Int/Sta/Spirit. And I have the SM dagger &amp; off hand + healing. 
---
My mana pool at 42 is nearly 4K. An enhancement Shammy would be lucky to have 2K, even if they add in a few bits of Int gear. 
---
I healed Ulda no probs last night, and will give ZF a go once I hit 44 prob this evening. 
---
If the healing sucks, I might think of respeccing more into resto now, but its hard to solo/quest as full resto.
---

---
I feel like this was almost fair they were two and you were one. Yes they were in battle and it was an elite. But they weren't grey and you were not in a group of 6. So I would say one small step for Garulok but a huge one for the Horde in terms of Honor.
---
Considering this absolute cancer of a meta "spell cleave farming", I would start to do a double take on all mages joining your group or guild ad they are now one of the top toxic classes in classic
---
Ah yes, so I will skip all the interesting and well-made content in the game during leveling (which is like 70% of the entire game) so I can become 60 faster to farm items I already had 15 years ago so I can start to kill raid bosses that I already killed 15 years ago a week or two earlier so I can get more items I already had 15 years ago to ... 
---
Yes, what exactly? 
---
There is no meaningful raid progress. Everything is already figured out, all reasonably decent guilds with enough players will clear everything up to AQ40 within their first raid week. I can already tell you which DPS class will do best at which boss in Naxx and give you a BiS list for hunters in P3. 
---
PvP isn't a thing for a bunch of weeks, all decently active players will have a chance to become 60 and get some dungeon gear before P2, even the normies that enjoyed the leveling experience.
---
There really is not much end game content for all you power players. Most of you will burn out in a few months, and things will become more chill for the rest of us. There is a reason retail added all the time sinks for max level players with achievements, rare pets and mounts, pet battles, dailies and world quests and so on. None of that is in classic, you rushed through all the leveling and gearing up just to log in once or twice a week for a rather meaningless raid night (as there are rarely any progress raids).
---
[They kinda forgot](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/029/651/sdbdcefw1jw21.jpg)
---
Thank you all for your advice and responses! I'll talk with him. What about cleave do you even use it or is it just sunder different targets?
---
Youre the sucker
---
There's the same amount of devilsaurs per population as there was in classic. Case closed.
---
He isn't wrong. Your op is a mess. It really sounds like you don't know what the fuck to do. Further, the people you are grouping with don't know what the fuck to do. I would recommend learning not only your role, but theirs too so you can help.
---
They are always the worst people to group up with. I think I've done 1 dungeon with a not stupid hunter.
---
You mean "game" journalists. Journalists for mainstream media that happen to play a game every once in a while is something completely different from a game journalist that is working for games focused media.
---
Source: I worked for a large website for multiple years, and attended events with both these media's present.
---
I actually got chewed out for using marks in sm the other day...
---
Honestly not for a second did I think this was about smacking a lowbie , and LOL‚Äôd at the dunk master jaws pathing!!! Hahaha. Then I come in here and see all the other garbage. Disappointing. Solid video 10/10.
---
Ele Shamans, have elemental mastery which makes your next spell crit chance 100%
---
Three words: Manual Crowd Pummeler.
---
Lol it‚Äôs WoW. There is no skill. There is no ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù. It is all time spent.
---
Very weird that you took my innocuous comment about how one class is better at healing than another personally. But i guess i‚Äôd be insecure too if i put in the same time investment you have.
---
Inb4 ‚Äúhahaha my played time is only X hours‚Äù.
---
Yeah yeah yeah, i can lie too
---
I mean, you do you, I'm just arguing that it'll make leveling a warrior much nicer. It's a lot faster to bandage up than it is to eat.
---
&gt;They are trying to give themselves credit for attacking someone who isnt there like they are some uncredited enforcer to boost their ego.
---
Or they're playing the game?! Don't play on a pvp server if you don't wanna pvp, it's that fucking simple. We're on two different factions, ofc im gonna attack you.  If i afk while playing counter-strike im not gonna be upset when someone shoots me. 
---
Go play fucking skyrim you're obviously not equipped to play a multiplayer game. Also thanks for the pseudo psych diagnose Mr. Floats-above-the-rest-of-us.
---
" Maybe they could add something"
---
Literally no one is raiding as destro or even leveling as destro.
---
Spells that need keybindings (while levelling) sbolt, corr, curse of agony, immol, fear, life tap, drain life, drain soul, wand, pet attack. I think those are the essentials, so about 10.
---
How good was your healing gear? Was it all SM / Ulda gear at least? 
---
I have about 4K mana pool at 42, which rises with int buff or MotW if with a mage or druid....so mana never really is an issue.  
---
I think I'll give ZF a go, once I hit 44 ( and get rank 4 LHW), and see how I get on with healing it.
---
I'm a MM Hunter and I kill everyone. 2v1's too.
---
I hope that helps...
---
As combat rogue I usually never run out of SnD and use rest of combo points to kidney shot strong not immune targets. In BRB kidney shooting Lvl 57 Fire Elementals was essential to survive with underleveled group, using interrupts should matter. I am kinda salty that I can't stun many bosses, even for reduced duration. I want my skills to matter.
---
Yeah that will be amazing for the 90 seconds worth of charges. After that it will be worse than his current green.
---
I never did the quest as it didnt seem like the time investment was worth it. Guides told me you basically need a 60 boost to do it at 30.
---
Indeed, it is he. :-)
---
that graph is not correct. Dragon's Call is just that tiny bit less balanced:
---
 [http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/DragonsCall](http://classicrealminfo.com/Chart/DragonsCall)
---
Then you planned your raid incorrectly. 
---
Rets are 5 lowest DPS spec, thats a fact.
---
Especially when asking for an invite so you can get the quest done real fast and they just decline and ignore you.
---
Omg I do this!
---

Half expected dickbutt
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
And my man Hemet.
---
I would disagree. KoS feels a bit too robotic and not personal. I usually kill horde that i dont like for some reason: perhaps they didn't /wave back, perhaps he killed my quest mob, or maybe he mined my iron node. That makes the game a lot more personal and great.
---
Ok. Its best to farm them in winterspring right?
---
Yes they do, I got the rod up there just outside the second cave for the next part of the quest
---
It‚Äôs not even that much. It‚Äôs 2 more int than ember stone and ember stone has spirit. If you‚Äôre a lock or priest it‚Äôs not a staff you want. This staff isn‚Äôt even worth 100‚Äôs and tbh may only fetch 20g‚Äôs later on.
---
But seriously, set your hearth to Kargath.
---
What about shadowpriest, i read they go oom easily.
---
Gnomes are also much more satisfying to kill!
---
In vanilla you could bug yourself by leaving the zone after handing in the quest at 225 fishing, and never be able to skill up past 225. Perhaps in the translation to classic that turned into the no fish loot issue.
---
To be safe, after handing in quest to Nat, Fish in zone till you get 226, then you can leave. Worth a try  /superstitions
---
Just grind Mobs in lower level areas you can get 1,5-2 levels in like 3 hours of grind then come back to strangle
---
The only reason people do this [including myself] is you can avoid a substantial portion of the deposit this way. Its not true for all items but most.
---
It is very annoying if you don't have Auctionator though.
---
People will lock themselves in battlegrounds because once honor gear and ranks come out it's extremely inefficient to be running around and ganking low honor when battlegrounds give you heaps in comparrison.
---
It happened before and will happen again.
---
Hey man, Druids are very good in PVP. They can adapt to lot of situations, but i thinh you must grow up to 40+ lvl. all classes in classic going to more usefull 45+ when you recieve new last talents and abilities. And you as Dru will recieve a Dire bear form (it gives you extra HP and armor in fight agianst Physical classes). Also if you ill spend talents to "balance" for reduce shape's mana cost it gives you advantage in PVP agains all classes. Whan i played in Elisium project i chose Dru i never sence an any discomfort in PVP. Yes, u ll be have problems with heal classes, but in most cases you have a chanse to kill everyone.
---
You are right thank you man &lt;3
---
Trust me I am just happy to get my mount lol
---
You cast it on them and it puts the item on cd for 30 min. If you're in group you're expected to do this on a shaman, Pala or priest. Not druid since they only have combat ress in vanilla.
---
Ye. Mages abusing that 100year sheep also rogues abusing that sap.
---
I had forgotten that was where they hadn't yet put in the limitation of 10sec
---
Got to grind that offhand of doom for now.
---
And there were 5 -7 more on my server that hadn‚Äôt sold for over 5g
---
I have not done this quest and i have the same bug..
---
Nice ideas. But still, compared to paladin and bears, warrior CAN aoe tank, but not as good as bears or paladins.
---
Imho for casual tanks, bears are a better choice. Easier to play &amp; tank.
---
I barely have time to get up from my chair in a load screen, so that won't do much good.
---
How it could be shaman twinking item since they get the Mail at level 40?
---
not on my realm . Maybe on your streamer realm lol
---
And that's fine man. 
---
I'll go back to being more mild after I feel like I've gotten enough revenge. It's a lot more fun to try to be friendly and see if I can't have any dark souls invasion type interactions. For now though, I just try to kill (without camping)
---
They always are. My dog is a huge pest but I love her.
---
BiS for 19 twink hunter, might go to up to 100g in a few months, you should keep it.
---
&gt;they alone decide what's cool
---
And they do that a lot based on the community's feedback/outrage. Do you think ClassicLFG would've gotten nuked without 1000 threads on forums, streamers crying about it, etc?
---
Yeah dude, absolutely stomped a grey who was fishing. 
---
PvP god.
---
I just eat em frozen.  No work at all
---
Then maybe , just maybe report him to twitch not to reddit ?
---
I'm doing crunches/pushups and two more chigong exercises on mana breaks. 
---
I did not get fit but, bwoy do I save my mana now!
---
I'm pretty sure we ran Cathedral in less than 20m
---
You can definitely make a case for Str/Agi shoulders being better than Herod's at 40, but the pants are almost your best option unless you wanna cough up a bunch of gold and get Golem Shard Leggings.
---
I don't see any problem with what the druid did. In fact, the only thing one could say he could have done better was murder your ass while you were fighting that wolf and *then* get the node.
---
Dick move is some fucker from the same faction doing this.
---
Dedication! :D
---
Now I don't know your role, but I can just imagine the healer typing "brb guys, gotta breastfeed my kid".
---
I had a run the other day where someone went "fuck fuck fuck - do you guys mind if I afk quickly? I just saw my dog jump the fence in the yard."
---
Everybody just went "go fetch" xD
---
He was back \~15 minutes later with the dog in tow and the rest of the run went smoothly - we had a good laugh at his tale of chasing his dog down the street, waiting for him every time it got too far, then running off again.
---
You're not understanding a group is a social contract and no one is even advocating for bad players here. Just not into the whole idea of going super try-hard and kicking people for not being the best players in a low level pug dungeon.
---
Back in the original vanilla I was a SM/ruin build and it absolutely destroyed the dos meters in BWL. I was however very well geared,
---
I'm am a total shame among rogues. I've mentored warr on how to tank.
---
/ty is a lot shorter, gives you a chance to reach them before they‚Äôre too far 
---
Or setup a macro that does it
---
Delete your char and reroll on a pve server.
---
Sold mine last for 4g and people saying it‚Äôs worth 100g lmao
---
Unfortunately their isn‚Äôt a great deal of Druid feral weps. I feel your pain
---
For me the Yeti cave was always empty. I only followed a high level Alliance in there to skin the yetis he killed for that nice heavy leather. He even waved at me.
---
Noone uses rend anyway as arms.
---
No it‚Äôs the recipe
---
There are 2 kinds of horde players:
---
The Thrall: just wants to level/quest. Only engages in PvP to defend themselves or others.
---
The Garrosh: rolled horde because he's too "badass" to play the sissy alliance races. Picks fights that he can't win solo the moment he's in a party. Complains in general chat that the horde is fully of pussies once the alliance start camping him in retribution for his bullshit.
---
109
---
Except you cant opt out of lowbie ganking without switching to a pve server. Its a package deal and its fair game to dislike parts of the package.
---
It's the same on both sides mate.
---
I got camped by skulls on my way to SFK.   
---
One kill? okay fine fair enough it's a PvP realm, but repeatedly ganking someone is low.
---
I already have my recipe if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre referring to
---
Seduce hunter, fear pet, wait for pet to fuck off a bit further away. Fear hunter and start applying dots then drain.
---
Yeah they do. The I spent about half a day grinding those yetis and it did eventually drop it. I killed them for probably close to 4 or 5 hours non stop tho. It seriously takes for fucking ever.
---
Oh look everyone, it's a fucking retard killing a low level that can't fight back while fishing. Such a /flex move bruh.
---
To be fair, the easiest way to get PVP going is to just kill everyone in sight, regardless of level. Level 60s will usually ride out to the aid of lowbies if they‚Äôre being camped.
---
Big thonk
---
it's definitely higher than it was on any private server I've played on. The price of the recipes will crash pretty quickly.
---
This when I take time to call my girlfriend, eat, do a task, etc. I just stockpile materials and do it all at once.
---
That's part of the reason I so desperately want to play feral. Their teabag game is by far the strongest in the game.
---
I think the same can be applied to Nelf edgelords
---
Dishonorable kills do NOT count for PvP kills. They're solely for civilian NPC
---
Undead Warlock is the saddest race/class combination in classic. Play Orc or Alliance if you're not a giant pussy.
---
Save up for warden staff :(
---
I think it is the gentle "gender gamers" flowers that should play retail's whining. Just ignore and move on.
---
We play classic for the excitement of getting murdered while peacfully questing. I don't get that thrill in newbie zones, as in contested territories - this is one of the things that make this game so great!
---
This is definitely against Twitch ToS, I'd take it up with them.
---
I almost didn't, no regrets
---
Fuuuuck. Young me thought Netherwing was bad, Skyguard is the absolute worst.
---
Because single target is irrelevant, we have mages for that.
---
Fury has the better AoE (consistently, not burst. Burst Arms wins) which is simply more needed right now in MC (there are enough mages for single target).
---
Griefing isn't allowed though. Once it gets to a certain level it is reportable. Corpse camping a quest giver for hours would be reportable.
---
Porque no los dos?
---
Sorry dad
---
what I did, was spend 1 hour doing it each night from about level 35....when I was due to log off, so roughly 10-11pm sever time. or 1st thing in the morning, like 6-7am Before I went to work.  Seemed to be very quiet then, and made me a lot of gold.
---
Keep records of everything, screenshots, logs etc of his activity both in game and in twitch. Then report them to both Blizzard and twitch with the evidence.
---
I'm not sure there's much else you can do, I am sorry this is happening to you though mate. I hope it gets resolved soon.
---
This isn't the place to post your issues.
---
If you don't like ganking either reroll PvE or add a delay to your stream if you insist on streaming.
---
Report him to twitch.
---
Only 4g in my server too.
---
It's BiS for hunter and Sham until they get their hand on the Medicine fulborg pouch, it's also quite looked after by healer as the limited mana is more of an issue than the healing power at that level since a +55healing power on the weapon is all you need to be overpowered.
---
I saw this. Relogging solves the issue
---
You play a rogue...
---
Streamer server I guess? Cheapest one was 2g at the time
---
On reddit, getting thousands of upvotes and starting a new "anti-gank" culture on social media? 
---
No, no it is not. Learn to just get over it instead. Sure it might be shitty but quit these fucking circlejerks on Reddit etc
---
I legit haven't. What's the point? You go to elvyn forest to chop up some wolves to feel big and strong?
---
I do throw an occasional DOT on them while passing by to scare them though :D not above making some undead shit their pants.
---
Better one is from quake times to use asdf for movemebt , but i still prefer wasd, without ability to look behind you while running forward i think pvp is quite crippled . 
---
My setup is clique for healing spells , 1-6 and shift1-6 on main bar , qefg and shift qefg currently . Im a priest
---
I always wondered, how Sylanna's right hand is a hunter, while I can't play as undead hunter in WoW...
---
NEVER TRUST A...BEAR?
---
what's that ilvl addon? :think:
---
Join benediction! Good faction balance and pretty much no wait times. Roll horde, dm me and ill ad you via blizzard.
---
Sometimes, it's actually easier to step back and fire an arrow
---
Technically it's not really stealing. :P
---
Shadowplay is the bees knees too, it's hardware based unlike OBS so the performance hit is absolutely negligible. I never turn it off, and have it continually recording 5 minute loops at 60fps native rez. 
---
Best thing about it is you can tell it to record mic audio on a separate track embedded in the video. This way if you want to share something with full audio, your talking doesn't ruin it.
---
Fastest way would be to change the password of your account. It forces the account information to refresh, removing the starter edition flag along with it.
---
So are you horde or ally?
---
If jord ei could continue to sell the rods for 1g and undercut him more ü•≥
---
If ally we need to start doing deals so I know where to find and gank him
---
I'm using Questie. I honestly didn't even know there was a limit.
---
Not at all. But if they impede my leveling, you can be sure I'll impede theirs.
---
Cept this is not one of those cases
---
Rather have the WC quest or ember stone as a healer both have more stam and spirit. With only 30 mana loss.
---
So much alliance salt in this thread. Gonna have to camp out on my undead warlock with some friends in duskwood tomorrow for an hour or two and close alliance questing.
---
I enjoy PvP. Fighting other players is a great test of skill. Attacking people stood still because they have to deal with things in real life, then trying to justify you are facilitating the danger of the wilds is pathetic. 
---
I also dont care if people kill me when afk, but I don't think they'd make out they are preserving the feel of the server or some crap.
---
And I'll pass on Skyrim, Escape from Tarkov is scratching my PvP itch well thank you kindly. 
---
I also don't float above you all, my shit stinks too. I just dont pretend my shit maintains integrity.
---
Buff cap is currently bugged. There's an Aura cap instead of buff cap because blizzard is incompetent. All your enchants and item item text like chance on hit and +crit etc. all counts as an aura and thus a buff.
---
Do i dare check my succu
---
For what it's worth, you did save yourself 10% training costs though, since Darnassus honored is trivial while Cenarion Circle honored is nigh impossible before 60.

I left it out, because honestly, I hadn't seen the other tweets before. And I'll admit that they're, well, at best unwise and it's probably better that he deleted them. Prior to this I believed this voiceover-tweet to be the cause of all this, but, well, obviously I was wrong on that. I didn't want to seem disingenous, sorry if it appeared that way.   
---
But I have to say that I personally don't have a problem with the tweets that are actually the cause either, because I feel it doesn't impact his work. And imo it doesn't for all the ingame-reasons I presented afterwards.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I'm a tank and I don't care about any class pulling aggro until I run serious dungeons. It happens all the time and no one seems to care and I have no time to educate every class what they're supposed to do. As a hunter, you should start DPSing the single target after you see at least 1 Sunder armor debuff. Multi-shot is a trial and error some tanks are good enough to control 2-3 mobs quickly where you can multi-shot after a few seconds of the battle, some don't. So, test it out. Do not use multi-shot when the group uses CC like sheep. Remove taunt from your pet in most cases because it will distract healer and drains his mana.
---
Thank you for that, that‚Äôs what I would‚Äôve thought!
---
They go for 2-3 gold on AH and 6-8 on neutral, i have sold maybe 15 to alliance so far.
---
Yeah blizz has made no extra money from me with the release of classic. I was gonna be subbed anyways. My sub did end last week so maybe i would have taken a break until 8.2.5 but its unlikely.
---
This is exactly what I would do, I would love if anyone do pvp during leveling on pvp server. What is the point of running next to opposite faction and type /hello. Kill them!
---
it is actually orc vs troll and comes down to whether you have thunderfury or not
---
You'd think they would have figured out that you need to split the queues, and funnel the excess from different PvP realms to the same realm. If it takes 5 hours for horde and the alliance don't even have a queue then the horde are going to transfer. Do the same on a alliance heavy server and offer free transfers from both realms to a single realm. Boom, 3 fairly balanced servers.
---
&gt;I'm a feral druid;
---
there's your problem
---
What is your main purpose as a shaman in dungeons? Ive never really played shaman so I would like to know how to build it.
---
Np, I had it in mind but also had to Google :p
---
Does it slow down the leveling if I do higher level quests? Should I always try to do quests at my exact level?
---
Funny enough, there was a Level 60 Ret paladin running around Hillsbrad on Grob the other day, ganking levelers. 
---
He got mobbed, and killed, and corpse camped until he decided to bubble hearth away from said levelers.
---
I saw someone mentioning that there is also a no loot bug in Desolace? I can't confirm it myself but it seems that something is "fishy" with fishing in classic.
---
I haven't fought in STV yet. Phase 2 will change that.
---
Grobbulus allowance checking in. Can confirm, I am sorry. I only gank undead rogues, I've seen to many atrocities committed by them.
---
I also don't have a key bound for moving forward. I press the scroll wheel to toggle autorun or press both mouse buttons to move forward. I combine this with strafing.
---
I won‚Äôt steal a gathering node of any kind. But homie, if you‚Äôre ass gets mobbed by a chest, sorry. It‚Äôs my chest now.
---
It is always a few rotten apples that whine, upvoted by 1000 people, while 8 million players enjoyed the game. They changed what the gentle gender-gamers whined about and game went into the gutter as we all saw.
---
Join channel layer and type "layer" in that chat, and somebody with an addon will automatically invite you and you'll jump to their layer. There is supposedly about a 5 minute cooldown if you pvp or just mined/herbed, and there's a risk that you get somebody in your own layer, in which case you'll have to try again.
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
It honestly feels like a lot of people don't realize you can PvP flag yourself on PvE servers
---
correction : questing anywhere -&gt; where are the f**g mobs ??
---
Tried to do the quests about the yetis in hillsbrad yesterday. There were more players than potential spawn points in that cave, the poor yetis were being annihilated 5s top after spawning, it was almost impossible to get the tag on one I just gave up.
---
All the good and average reward quests are like that.
---
What's the point of having layers if there's so many people you can't quest, but it's just enough technology to be abused by some clever chaps ?
---
Boy are people gonna hate me. Don't care.
---
Killing afk grays? From that whole human warrior business and come to us, udead rogues! You'll fit right in.
---
I had some issues with the 'Smart' dispel feature, it might be related ot that. It's a checkbox in one of the config menus though I can't remember where exactly.
---
weapon skill also reduced the chance of parry and dodge, it is not just hit cap that is lower
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs an uncommon drop and most people will need on it though. Wouldn‚Äôt be too hopeful.
---
yeah. the principle he is using is sound but the details are pretty much an exploit.
---
I played albion online for last 3 months, and
---
there were achievement "welcome to albion". Its shows up when you got killed by player. So this exact situation is like "welcome to pvp server".
---
That's why he said "but I'm a druid, and not much concerned by it"...
---
 I'm looking for an addon that tella me what debuff I just got without me needing to hover on it and read it(something fit for combat basically, like error message for debuffs).
---
I could also use an addon that compares items I hover on with what I have equipped.
---
GY is &lt;20 minutes if you get unlucky and have none of the rare bosses spawn.
---
Some of us haven't played for 15 years.
---
What a masterpiece op!
---
I NEED THAT
---
The only time I went to hillsbrad was at 46 to get the recipe for turtle bisque. Hillsbrad is easily avoided.
---
Ironaya has 20 stam, not 20 str. It‚Äôs a decent tanking wep if you need the stam but I‚Äôd rather have an agi wep for crit and dodge.
---
Because alot of ppl just follow the community and their friends, not fully realizing the consequences of playing on a PvP server.
---
No.
---
In my case, i didn't have a choice, i would've happily rolled a PvE server, but when classic launched in EU there were none, so now i'm stuck here, and i don't wanna re-lvl in a PvE server.
---
&gt;real wpvp
---
Oh I am LAFFIN 
---
95%+ of glorious wpvp is just tanking people that have no real chance of fighting back. That's just the reality of it.
---
I'd gladly take 1G then go make my own group!
---
My #1 rule is to always make my own groups!
---
Lmao
---
You dont use addons to move chat windows.
---
You know you can steal a node back, right? The timing isn't even that tight.
---
You‚Äôre totally fine to be that guy, the problem is when that guy tries to demand all players on a PvP server play like him.
---
I see you've never had to fight your own faction, plus the enemy faction in an AV trying to scoop a Black Lotus.
---
You cant quest in STV, because there are just too many people and its impossible to kill quest mobs frequently.
---
Do you do the hamstring dance with mobs or just face tank everything?
---
Played rogue back in vanilla but switched to warrior in TBC and have stuck with it since then. That's why in classic I rolled warrior as well instead of rogue.
---
95% of pvp encounters are exactly this. patiently waiting for the day ppl realize the shitness of pvp servers
---
Wow. I though I was the only one that sees underworld in random areas. OS X client bug.
---
Thats how you get two people on your ignore list :D
---
&gt;I just dont pretend my shit maintains integrity.
---
However, you do claim that somehow I have some sort of inferiority complex or an inflated ego and the only way I can improve upon that is to kill afk'ers. Maybe I just truly believe that EVERYONE is fair game on a pvp server and if you AFK in the open world you're SUPPOSED to be killed. Like i really believe that. I have played on pvp servers since vanilla and i LOVE PvP, it's the sole reason i've played the game since cata.
---
It's actually really simple, if you don't wanna be attacked by the opposite faction play on a pve server. That includes AFK killing, low lvl ganking, in combat killing or whatever. Complain in trade chat but don't start fucking diagnosing people because they play the game with other rules than yours
---
&gt;Probably less tedious than getting exalted with the Skyguard.
---
Did it in BC. Was just as tedious as all other grinds, i.e. it was chill.
---
Horde do have stronger racials for PvP but I'd argue alliance have better racials for PvE. Also, priest fear-ward buff for me is better than Tremor Totem. Paladins buff are more versatile and generally better than the shaman (except for Enhancement shaman in a group of warrior with Windfury). Paladins heal better than Shamans in some cases but Shamans excel in situations where many people get hurt due to their chain-healing. Blessing of Salvation buff is a game breaker imo which tips the favor towards Paladins over Shamans for Raids.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
What's a Varimathras? You mean a Dreadlord?
---
I'm pretty sure the route improves once you get the flightpath on the Azshara-Ashenvale border.
---
It's always a big risk to play on a pvp server as a streamer...chance is high to get ganked by stream snipers and haters. Thats why all the streamers with high viewer counts play on pve. I guess most people who gank streamers want to provoke a live reaction of the streamer and he knows he can piss you off even more when he pretends to kill you because you're trans ... it's probably just his way to get you even angrier.
---
This always worked for me, its the first thing I do after fresh wow install, had the mouse problem since wotlk this fixes it
---
lol. Yeah as if that's only Alliance who does that. I haven't been attacked by a Horde a single time unless they were at least 7 levels above me, I was in combat with 3 mobs or they were at least 2 yet.
---
That's fair and I commend you for admitting it, but you can understand that you conveyed incorrect information and made it quite dramatic ("a wave of hate"). 
---
For the record, I don't have anything in particular against the guy. I find that the lore of Warcraft really suffers when it's focused on the big heroes and Nathanos is just another example, made worse with how over-present he is in BFA.
---
yeah if you aren't 60 by then and decently geared, you're basically fckd
---
Currently trying to turn in my gel hunter quest another player uses their tome on my circle summons a hunter kills it and runs off and now I‚Äôm stuck in the quest to where they won‚Äôt resummon the circle. Am i going to have to redo all that shit?
---
There's not a lot of feral love. Here's the few that came to mind.
---
P1
---
Ironshod Bludgeon, Uldaman  
---
Force of Magma, BRD  
---
Impervious Giant, BRD  
---
Lavastone Hammer, BRD  
---
Slavedriver's Cane, Stratholme  
---
Fist of Omokk, LBRS
---
P2
---
Bonecrusher, Dire Maul quest
---
P4
---
NP's Fish Terminator, ZG
---
Pretty much. We don't even have a flight path in the north.
---
Gromgol is next to the most important quest hubs.
---
Someone has to, eh?
---
True that, i got it on my first run so didn't know it was that hard to get lol
---
Whats a good time to start collecting?
---
Also the spirit of every night elf hunter!
---
He doesn‚Äôt have the money/balls/patience to buy out the entire market
---
Doesn't work for me. I tried a lot of macros
---
Crescent staff is for sure a good pick Horde side but for someone that has gold to spend, Twisted Chanter is a little upgrade and Emberstone is just dogshit compared to Twisted Chanter. In the 10-19 bracket, spirit as nearly no value due to the very high mana twinked toons have and the fact that it's not PvE.
---
Same question. Whut addons pliz?
---
Drop Wind Fury Totem, Get Love =)
---
Horde on Ten Storms.
---
Please define the distinction.
---
RIP
---
Birds was my first complete, followed by scorpions, followed by the tortoises. Luck of the draw I guess.
---
There is no Honor in this.
---
I'd go with quests lower than your level (green quests), you can quest faster and don't lose out on xp.
---
reminds me of the "here comes the pain bitch" video of the rag kill
---
Because they have closed transfers for now
---
depending of the class but usually you want fighting mobs that are 1 or 2 level under yours,
---
but in classic/vanillia the quest zone are mixed with a lot of quest with different level so its a bit tricky..
---
Maybe u can check some guides that help light Nightfall one or stuff like that !
---
came here to see if he had full T-backs and was slightly disappointed, HOWEVER. grats on the full Traveler's Set! :D
---
Spam judgement and holy shock ? These have respectively a 10s and 30s cooldown. Auto attacks every ~2secs that does around 100 damage +20 with righteous hasn‚Äôt been enough to kill anyone my level yet.
---
Plus I species in prot first to get blessing of Kings for me and my friends while we play together so U still don‚Äôt have Holy Shock.
---
I‚Äôm not saying in any way Holy isn‚Äôt viable in PvP, just that solo, without the full talents and poor gear it‚Äôs far from a piece of cake.
---
Whirlwind probably
---
The chest one lmao
---
The recovery people work wonders. If you have almost any details they can help.
---
Always the funniest when lowbies cry about their being some artificial sense of honor that should be distilled through every PVP server. Lol nope, get one banged and QQ on reddit.
---
I wanted to backstab people, not help them! At least one I found some folks with pvp flag on running around my pve realm. Had to maintain rogue legacy.
---
Can't really play but usefull to login queue while going back home from work/uni
---
Believe me, I advocated for vanilla servers since 2007. I hated TBC from the start because it reminded me of Planes of Power, the Everquest expansion that was quite similar to it that killed Everquest for good. I definitely believe the original experience should be preserved. 
---
In fact, I am angry that Classic is far from the original experience, mainly because it's on 1.12. By then, almost every aspect of the game had been nerfed in preparation for TBC.
---
I believe that if they do Classic+, it should be on fresh servers - that way they can rebalance the raids, the dungeons, everything to be harder like it used to be before the nerfs came in.
---
Did you play with me last night perhaps?
---
Was playing around in STV and 31 rogue attacks me (38 priest). When i almost kill him his 60 nelf druid friend comes out and oneshots me.. This happened about 4 times near nesingwary camp
---
But the real questing is will I have to reset it every morning for the rest of my life
---
&gt;but griefing is just dirty practice, and basically trolling. 
---
As well as being completely within the PvP server ruleset and for some people a really fun way to spend their time!
---
"You're not supposed to feel safe outside of cities, I help facilitate that by killing people outside of those cities."
---
Your words, not mine. 
---
Nothing wrong with everyone on a PvP server being fair game, just dont make out you are attacking AFK players for some noble cause.
---
You kinda have to do STV. So many good quests
---
I look forward to meeting you in combat =)
---
Clever use of ice mage mechanics.
---
played ally warrior not big on caster dps so went orc shaman dont mind healing
---
What you mean "empty loot table"? I fished at the shore line of STV the other day quite sucessfully.
---
Let's get back to facts!
---
&gt; anyone who wants ore COULD level mining themselves.
---
Anyone who wants locked chests could level blacksmithing themselfs. Same logic, i dont care who invested more, you COULD.
---
Also skilling mining or herb is not that harder than lockpicking but you dont ask every guy to share his ore or herbs.
---
Oh look, the sylvannas pet dog!
---
Seeing rogues die is my kink
---
Nah they also kill the higher-level rogues that try to gank them
---
We had 1 group where a guy was determined on scenario 1 despite everyone's disagreement. Every other group treats the whole chest as a greed roll, then gives out/rolls out greens where appropriate. People care about trade goods and potions, slacking in combat to be first to a chest shouldn't qualify someone for all of them
---
&gt;Just ~~horde~~ all around really
---
Just players all around really. FTFY
---
My dog just lays under my desk and occasionally unplugs my entire PC/monitor.  I consider you lucky.
---
Having plenty of fair, fun wpvp on my PvE server! Lots of it happening outside dungeons.
---
To be fair some people just don't seem to understand the consequences of their actions.
---
Yesterday morning I was selling hillman's cloaks before going to work, put 4 of them in AH at 65s.
---
On my coffee break 2h later, I checked my mail and I had sold them all! So I put 4 more.
---
During lunch break, I see only 2 of my cloaks sold, so I check the AH.
---
Right there, next to my cloaks, there's a guy who put 20 cloaks at 25s each, 24h. Some other dudes already undercut that guy and it's at 21s now.
---
RIP my mount. Thank god I'm a druid.
---
Lol ty! He waited till i used blink and opened!
---
Can you blame him?
---
I would never lol. Had a Guildie get to 40, get his mount, and reroll rogue though cause we "had too many mages" lol
---
Ty
---
So yours didn't work, but a combination of yours and swapping the order like leftcheeksneak suggested below worked. Now I'm just annoyed that the spell animation takes priority over the emote, but I'll get over it.
---
Thanks for the help.
---
The Garrosh is just so retarded... if you go that way then go ALL THE WAY and just go WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH at everything!!!!
---
He can undercut if he wants lol, why do you think he should put it at 1.5g just cause you asked him to
---
WC is basically a fucking raid.
---
It's my favorite dungeon (I'm a druid, and I really dig all the druid lore) until maybe ST? But if anyone seems impatient or whiny before we go in then I will drop the fucking group. I don't want to put up with 2 hours of "ugh, this is taking foreeeeeeeeever"
---
Likewise for being too much of a try-hard. New players can get lost or fuck up "the jump", and unless you have a shaman, the sleeps mean you can't get too aggressive with your pulls. I've noticed this drives the retail try-hards fucking CRAZY
---
They also don't know if it's a inside/outside cat. My buddies cats have free range. Motherfuckers are fat as hell off all the shit they catch and getting fed by strangers. Not much he can do about it.
---
awesome. Now what do I do as a Druid?
---
i think it's ModUI
---
You made him a gnome (woman?) because he had his legs cut off?
---
So swapping didn't work, but a combination of yours and using /cast like Ameasun suggested worked.
---
You must mean reputation? Any areas with Stormwind questgivers give Stormwind rep. Westfall, Elwynn, Redridge, Duskwood, STV, Hillsbrad, Arathi, Western Plaguelands all have quests that give Stormwind rep. There should be more elsewhere, but those are the ones that spring to mind.
---
[just wait](https://youtu.be/Lx4fRPTZYCg)
---
There is a reason to that, too.
---
Yes there are people who play it professionally that you can watch for entertainment, just like with footballers.
---
Get over yourself.
---
I'm not pretending im killing them for a noble cause tho? I'm killing them because they're not supposed to feel safe outside of cities, i never claimed it was a noble cause lol, however that is still the reason I do it. Don't afk outside of cities, it's that simple.
---
You're right, it is a social contract. I am invited to a group and I must maintain reasonable DPS in order to keep my invitation.
---
I am curious, what profession would be better?
---
just wish the higher levels would stay in their own zone and stop ruining the pvp for us lowbies
---
Mom married an asshole Vietnam Vet Marine who was 27 years older than her, who was also a financially stable computer programmer. AKA step "dad".
---
So yeah there was always a computer and guns in our house and it was the only way he would civilly communicate with us; if those were the subject of the topic. So I've been field stripping weapons and building/repairing PC's since I was around 5 years old. Shot and cleaned a gun for the first time when I was 3. As cool as that sounds, it wasn't cool getting punched in the face at 7 years old for spilling coolaid on the carpet and then being intimated into lying to my mother about it, saying my brother did it and then hearing him screaming in the next room when my step dad beat his ass for "punching me". 
---
Born in 1985 &gt; started DOS games by the age of 4 &gt; Diablo at 11 &gt; AoE &gt; EQ in 1999 &gt; and the story blooms from there.
---
This is my first time playing WoW since launch. I played until lvl 36 and uninstalled due to boredom. When it released it wasn't nearly as good as it's predecessors nor it's competition and to be honest it's still not lol. The only reason I play it is because the gaming industry is a very sad industry and I've burned through all of the EMUs and other mmorpgs.
---
So yeah kind of the same thing = Programmer was the head of the household which gave me access to a computer...
---
Nicest ending to an argument I have ever seen in the WoW community.
---
Is it considered bad manners to need on another item in the dungeon if you have already won a need roll? I am a warrior and I was running SM with a group that had a pally in it. Some mail boots dropped early and we both rolled need and I won it. Later Herod‚Äôs Shoulders dropped and we both rolled need and I won again. The pally was pissed I rolled need after already getting those boots but I understand the need/greed system as do you need it? Then roll need. Don‚Äôt? Roll greed or pass. Unsure if I‚Äôm in the wrong or if the pally was just upset at bad luck with rolls.
---
ah yes, thanks
---
Ive wasted too much time on the peggle addon
---
And then at 60 we can wpvp with other people looking to get honor and take part in bgs once they're released.
---
The amount of people ITT acting as if ganking and camping aren't both legitimate forms of wpvp on PvP servers is... uh... sad.
---
maybe re-grow a pair of balls? Instead of making an essay on reddit complaining about "muh harrassment" which is something literally everyone on wow has experienced, except most of us dont cry to reddit about it.
---
Slap a NSFW tag on that
---
Thank you! I much prefer Bejeweled over Peggle
---
I know they do, i was being blatantly sarcastic friend
---
Hi, /u/isewaredis

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5uq2q/finally_he_got_his_silk_cloth_i_mean_revenge/).

Problem with that atm is that powershifting gets rid of lotp and predatory strikes. So it's almost better to not powershift imo.
---
Going from Desolace to Dustwallow Marsh and the wyvern just *had* to fly *through* the flight path tower in Thunder Bluff on the way... really?
---
Don't forget to tell your friends to set their alarms too, no Horde ganks alone!
---
You're on a PvP server. What he says outside of the game about you has little bearing on blizzards decision making regarding his ingame actions. I'd say move servers or make some high level friends. You've put a target on your back by not only broadcasting your position but also taking a political stance with your stream.
---
Right, trade seems to be more popular, as why I use it more often.
---
I just run dungeons from 35/40 and got like 105g when I dinged 40. Just spam armory/cathedral. I made like 70/80g in the whole process. Sell trash and boss loot to vendors and sell materials in the AH. Worked fine for me
---
Again delete your char and reroll on a pve server.
---
Also this is witchhunting.
---
As a fellow warlock I can recommend only this: Ignore the "spellcleave" groups. I hate when they don't announce it when LFM and it turns out to be a spellcleave..    
---
Fun fact: If they care so much about speed and effectivity, why they are not 60 yet? I had no vacation, I started one week after the launch, doing dungs only for quests and questing in the world for the rest of the time and yet I'm 53 with chilled attitude.
---
It's exactly why I chose not to play on a pvp server, I have experienced just how uncommon an actual even/fair fight is, I enjoy them its why I like battlegrounds. I dont enjoy being killed by groups of people when Im solo, I don't like being killed by people higher level than me, I don't enjoy grouping up to kill soloers, I don't enjoy killing people lower level than me. As I don't enjoy the only unique things a pvp server offers, why would I play on them.
---
I was complaining to my brother that the quests in Ashenvale would send me all across the map several times.
---
Him: "well, since you have to travel so far you can stumble upon adventure."
---
It's the same with wpvp. If everything is convenient the game loses some of the adventure. Running a detour to avoid a high lvl alliance is something that can make you stumble upon something fun and great.
---
Is the action bar addon bartender?
---
Now that's a douchebag.
---
mods pls delet this before a shitshow occurs
---
Hes a famous wow streamer. However alot of people hate streamers, and asmongold is no exception.
---
that would be me
---
Cause people don't want to put up stacks of 20 if a person needs 10. Then they won't buy your stacks n go for someone else's. However same can be said if someone needs 20 they just buy a 20 stacks even if it's more expensive simply cause they're lazy or don't have an addon for it
---
My best memory from vanilla was a group of us doing this for the Pyrewood quests. So much laughter and sooo many deaths.
---
Not seeing a problem with being on a PVP server, you might get ganked at the entrance but the instance itself is clear from anyone outside your group.
---
I'm in a PVP server myself and most of the time I don't have any issue with getting into SM.
---
Elixir of Giant Growth + some defuff making him green maybe? ;P
---
Have any source for that?

This phenomenon is not just prevalent in games . You can say the same for sports fans. 
---
I've been arsenal fan (football) for 20 years and i admit I often whine in the forum/reddit  when I am not pleased with the direction of the clubs and losses. And I am watching the matches for free (kind of) ! It's just an addiction that keeps you coming back for some hopeful good moments.
---
Someone should do a Poll. I 100% want Classic+
---
Some people really need a hug.
---
Cry somewhere else please.
---
I think comics that tell a story without words are best.  So much information in just two panels.
---
My trainer just told me to wear plate armor and didn't give me shit. He just charged me for the "information."
---
It's a fucking scam.
---
Exactly :)
---
It is literally PvP.
---
Of course Reddit was a mistake. The human species was a mistake xD
---
Yet, here we are.
---
I think the best way of "existing" on Reddit is to think of up/downvotes as a metric of how many retards accidentally stumble onto a thread.
---
Lotta downvotes? Lotta retards.
---
Lotta upvotes? Same.
---
People downvote because others downvoted. People upvote because something is trending. People are stupid.
---
The downvoters probably sit behind their screens going like "Wait, this person wrote that they are visually impaired... I DISAGREE! **BIG FAT DOWNVOTE!** HA! Take that, ya filthy perfect vision scumbag! I GOTCHA!"
---
At least that's my take on it.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Most players don't get harassed for specifics.
---
Would going into ret means i should use a two-hander? 
---
Because i will still be deep enough in holy to not get repentance.
---
Same going combat daggers tho the dagger options are quite poor now 
---
Sword competition is too mad
---
Center mouse button moves you in the direction if your camera? Unless you have changed it. But being mobile and having good movement controls is IMO a lot more important than having top notch action bar binds. As long as you don't swap too often you will get comfortable in what you have and perform well.
---
Our logic is worth more than your tradition. 
---
It's better for the custom to be for all to need on blue BoEs because it prevents ninjaing and there will always be some fool who will buy it off the auction house for enough gold to help you level faster than you would if you had equipped the item. So the best use for the item is to auction it. It makes no sense to ask people to give up their equal chance at the best use of an item just because someone else would prefer to equip it.
---
Damn I just sold yesterday a 1H Mace I got from ZF with 2.70 speed.
---
What's your fishing at?
---
I live by "everything dies". I would kill a level 5 gnome any day even at 60. I wont corpsecamp them or fuck with them, but they gonna die. You may hate it, but thats fine
---
But effectively they are 4 separate small dungeons. Nobody ever does run the entire SM at once, there's at least 10 lvl difference between gy and cath.
---
snitches get Sitches
---
Sure, I get ya. My point is they were 350ish yards from us. If they kept quiet and kept on with what they were doing (they were 60 already). Maybe gettin pre-raid BiS.. w/e it would be fine. 
---
But no, they were willing to spend 10 minutes there and sit and trash talk in Local Defense channel. Would you do that if you are strapped for play time? I wouldn't react at all if they just ignored us and didn't help. 
---
They could find time to trashtalk and bs on localdefense, but not to walk 30 sec and help out fellow hordies. That's what makes it lame.
---
I think of PVP as picking hard in Single player games. I always play on normal first and then do hard. Similarly my first WoW char is on a PVE server, when I reach lvl 60 and do some endgame stuff my next char will probably be on a PVP server.
---
When I do that, I will accept the extra challenge - the fact that while I'm leveling something far more dangerous might be lurking in the shadows.
---
I miss the days when botting was easy, wouldn't dare to bot now with all the detection they implemented. It was fun to make my own scripts and stuff. Fun times
---
It's because from their reference point, that is the truth. The Horde are the grievers and the Alliance are the grievers depending on your reference point.
---
The only problem I've had with ret paladin healing is just sheer mana.  I've got a little int gear, but not a lot.  And I'm an experienced healer.  I have a pretty good idea what I'm doing, and how to conserve.  But when things get high damage, I can only maintain it for so long.
---
This exactly. Retail just hands out weapons to everyone. Reward simulation.
---
 To the town of Booty Bay rode a stranger one fine day
---
No I watched the video and came to the same conclusion as the masses.  Be on your way angry child.
---
Yup, I definitely can and that wasn't my intention, so I'm sorry. To me the Nathanos-hate seems just really really intense (also because of that self-insert stuff) so that's why I interpreted it that way.
---
It'd be completely fine if you did, I mean we're all entitled to our opinions. :) I personally don't mind Nathanos being very present right now, because I like the character a lot, but I can understand that people might think it to be too much. One can only hope that the focus will change towards "smaller" characters again in the next expansion, so it gets better.
---
Posting about pvp on forums is half the fun of pvp servers. It's been a thing since before wow launched, and will continue to be for a long time.
---
&gt; it‚Äôs why she‚Äôs getting harassed...
---
Okay now think a little bit: how did this person find out?
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm as far away from retail as possible.‚Äù  
---
Truer words my friend...
---
Ah, the video was in a small window so, crunched down, it looked like 51.
---
31 to 25 isn't that big a deal, I kill people 5-8 levels higher than me often!
---
Yo "Asmonsnippets" - can you keep your clickbait content which is aimed at 7-8 year olds to YouTube please?
---
That would mean you cant leave the current expansion to visit older content.   
---
Nope, wont happen
---
There is such a thing as being too "needy" but you shouldn't be worried about rolling need just because you already won a roll. Typically, I wouldn't roll need on any greens that are the same item type as boss drops (so for example, I wouldn't roll need on a green shoulder in SM armory) even if its technically an upgrade. 
---
Like I'll give you an example of what I'd consider poor form: I did a library run, then an armory, then somebody had forgotten to complete the quest in library so we ran it one more time. One person was already being pretty 'needy', but I let it slide because I was planning to farm them shit out of SM so one person getting a little more t than 'their share' wasn't my main concern. Anyway, we get back to library, and this person (who had previously won the staff drop) ALSO NEEDED the dagger, on the same run, knowing full well that I had rolled on the staff, and obviously not won. Since they couldn't possibly use both at the same time, and they already won a weapon upgrade this run, I was pretty miffed about their rolling and I don't group with that person anymore (in the same guild btw).
---
For the most part, if you aren't needing all the greens or things that aren't technically 'yours' (for example, a rogue who wants a sword with INT on it) if somebody in the group also needs it then roll however you feel is justified.
---
Hi, /u/Asevio

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d5uuiw/does_anyone_know_if_it_would_be_possible_to_get/). 
---
Well the part where you say 33% or less, if I stay in cat/bear form vs mele class I lose my hp twice as fast their dps is much higher than mine by the time they are 33 percent I'm dead if I don't heal. When I do reset and heal mele still beat me with 33 percent and me in full hp OOM in cat/bear form because my dps is just non existant. (I have no blue gear just random Stam agi quest gear btw)
---
I am just really surprised more than anything how I get annihilated toe to toe vs any mele. Casters not much easier because I go OOM real fast breaking their cc with shifting and heals
---
What is the difference?
---
That‚Äôs me too!
---
This breaks my heart. It's like watching a kid get bullied in elementary school. "You can't play with us" :(

Yojamba is nice place.

Mooo
---
How much do you drink? I tried this route and found I was facing constant downtime.
---
Yeah, people forget how freaking TBC was. Everyone turned into a big baddy so we have something to kill
---
Sounds to me like you meant to roll on a pve server and should wait for battlegrounds to release.
---
I got the extra gold by just waiting until 45 for shadowform :)
---
 And the increase to his fishing numbered one and nineteen more,  
---
One and nineteen more.
---
That‚Äôs you trying to justify it to yourself. 
---
This is worth way more, gg on mount tho.
---
the "inceases healing and DAMAGE done by spells and effects by 10" does exactly what it says, while +10 healing spells is the same thing, but only for healing, and the only difference is that the +X healing spells is usually a greater value than the first one.
---
Wow the details of the cracks on the floor. What graphic are those?

There aren't just 3 flask recipes and they are still missing 1 of the useful ones.

Buying up the whole lot of something to stop people price fixing and selling it at your price is price fixing.

Not sure why that person thinks otherwise.

She can fucking share she‚Äôs trans on her own damn stream if she wants, and she should be able to without being harassed.  I doubt she was yelling in game COME WATCH MY TRANS STREAM!!!!
---
Literally today there was a lv52 warlock in darkshire killing everyone. Someone said in lfg and then people came and killed him. Was a 50 hunter so couldn‚Äôt solo him but with a few other lv30 there we could barely win lol. Warlock op
---
I read the same (probably) post. The only testing I did was with a 9.1 DPS two-hander at level 10-14 or so. At that range at least, getting 3-5 stacks of SA made no discernible difference in the range of white numbers I was seeing.
---
Glad to hear it is very noticeable at higher levels though.
---
That logic only works if everyone that plays are actively trying to maximize their gains. I am sure that many people, like myself, don't give a fuck about maximizing their gains on the AH. At least in retail my bags keep filling with crap that I can sell on the AH. I just go to the AH and unload everything just under current market price so that I know it will get sold.
---
I was simply asking for suggestions on what to do within WoW as well as twitch, but thanks for the advice.
---
You haven't been playing with very many warrior tanks huh... they overpull so god damn often lol
---
But anyway, it's actually reasonably viable to bring things back as long as it's only 6-7 mobs. Like I said, you just need to be at 90+% mana when it happens, and you have to be completely on top of your 5SR management.
---
Left.
---
lmao quests like this are real gems
---
I dunno if they reverted it back to it's ultra overpowered state in classic or not. But the Rocket helm is a fucking godsend against gankers. You basically wear it ALL THE TIME on a pvp server. It's cloth and it has shit stats but it will save your ass. It has a gauranteed 30 second stun, with no resistance or diminishing returns against a level 60.
---
When i was level 30 in STV with my friends, We got attacked by a 60 hunter. I just rocket helmed him then we all scattered and hid. By the time he broke out of that 30 second stun we were long gone. If a 60 rogue jumps you, you usually only have a couple of seconds where you are able to control your character after their stunlock. Rocket helm will save you there too but a rogue will likely be prepared to break CC.
---
Another great one is the mind control helmet but you need to be prepared incase it backfires. The MC helmet is amazing because when it control the other player it isn't like priest mind control, it basically turns the other player into a your very own hunter pet. You can set them to agressive and they will just run around ganking their own friends and you dont need to micromanage them at all. They will also match speed with you regardless how fast you are going, so you can MC someone and mount up and go somewhere, or MC somone and waterwalk/sprint out to sea (or back to shore).
---
MC hat is amazing in alterac valley too, I played a rogue. When the alliance were all gathering to attack the warchief I would be stealthed in that last room as a level 53. I always mind controlled paladins, the instant you mindcontrol them, they run into the room then pop bubble and run out with all captains agrod and cause a raid wipe. It's even better if the MC hat backfires because it's counted as if you are the paladins pet. So when you break mind control and vanish the agro swaps to the guy you targeted. It happens so quickly the alliance dont even know what happened, but suddenly the entire room is agrod on them.
---
Played since day 1, just lvl 25 here.
---
Oh didnt know thar
---
20? What a bunch of noobs! Call when they 5man it.
---
I'm not advocating a change but it's interesting how at some point in history they made it so you cannot buff/heal players with a higher rank than they would be able to have at that level. If damaging spells did this same action, a high level player would essentially be PVP boss rather than unbeatable wall. That could be pretty fun IMO.
---
You'd definitely get into SM Armory groups, because you can't wear the loot.
---
I've also been struggling with questing at that level, I'm 36 now.
---
From 32 onward I've been going everywhere to pick up some quests.
---
At 35 I found dustwallow march to start providing some.
---
And then I Just started doing SM runs for the exp and loot. Also I enjoy it.
---
Whirlwind, sorry.
---
Hard to remember which gust of wind was used as a name for which ability.
---
Thank you, on behalf of my entire caste.
---
snow mage good
---
&gt; She can fucking share she‚Äôs trans REEEEEEEEEE
---
Agreed. She can also be harassed, just like anyone else, for any reason when putting their personal information out there. It's not right, but they would not be the first one. Screech elsewhere.
---
Its Alliance winning but somehow someway just walking away from it.
---
Man Rift was the shiiiizz
---
But your playtime on other characters isnt taken into account.
---
You must have spend 2 literal days doing nothing.
---
'no life' indicates playing a lot in real time, it is irrelevant to ingame time and thus a pointless retort. Sorry I made you so defensive.
---
I'm just looking for some opinions on the matter, it is flaired as discussion and I was seeing if anyone could help with some useful info.
---
Rogues being rogues bud. Glad you got him in the end.
---
Remember, as a warrior, if you see a rogue, attack first. Warriors are one of the FEW classes who you have an easy time beating in PvP. If you wanna be a pacifist most of the time - fine, good. Do it. But kill rogues on sight... their own fault for letting themselves be spotted.
---
&gt;easy
---
&gt;Mage
---
Well Trans people like to act like special snowflakes.
---
I only get attacked by horse when they
---
a) outnumber me at least 2:1
---
b) are at least 5 levels above me
---
So I have to insist on you shutting your foul orc mouth.
---
If you are planning on equipping the item after you win a roll, need always.
---
So two players in conflict isn't PvP? Sounds like a weak argument my dude.
---
Maybe speced as ret with good gear it‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôm speced holy and got some prot talents first for group playing, so solo I find it pretty hard to do anything 1vX.
---
Also I‚Äôm not really have problems, paladin is very good for PvP because you can basically almost never die using your massive survivability toolkit, I just gave up on wasting it on pvp and I keep it for questing because that‚Äôs how I want to do it.
---
Sounds to me like you have some 16 year olds to drive to the mcdonalds parking lot
---
No you can‚Äôt hide behind the rainbow flag to get special treatment on a PVP server.
---
Move to PVE and air your grievances with Twitch.
---
as a priest, WC made me feel like a GOD dispelling sleeps left and right
---
You do know people who AFK outside of cities usually dont have a choice due to things happening in real life. My point you keep missing is you claim you kill them to make the world feel dangerous, which is a flawed arguement when in PvP you can be killed by everything. Your actions aren't making the place more dangerous. Killing players trying to pass an area would be making it more dangerous, not killing people who cant move, why not do that?
---
You also seem to keep insisting I play on a PvE server if I want to feel safe, which was never what the arguement was about in the first place. It's about people having to AFK, having to go AFK doesn't automatically equate to join a PvE server. Which also goes back to you saying I attack people for having different rules to me, isn't that what you are doing by claiming AFK players should go to a PvE server?
---
Not really, I try to recollect it from my memory. 
---
/edit: You'll find some comments here on classicdb talking about the changes, starting from Patch 2.0.6:  
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=7734#comments](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7734#comments)
---
1. Pet on taunt
---
2. Always attacking different targets than the tank
---
3. Rolling on everything
---
4. Being a fucktard in general
---
Im amazed you give a fuck about that. Like why do you care. It literally doesnt matter.
---
Wow, I would actually love to have this addon.
---
what are you talking about? whining about getting ganked has been a thing since the dawn of online gaming. Ever played an fps online? people still whine about getting killed, in a game that the main objective is killing each other!
---
This!
---
Why are there so many mobs that nobody needs for a killq? And everybody is clearly wearing a bandana, so why do they have such a low droprate?
---
Is it 3-4 hit for rogues? Assuming we put points into combat?
---
I don't like it because I can't see more than 30 feet in front of me irl. After about 10 feet everything becomes blurry, after 30 feet then everything is just not even there to me because it's just a blurry shape. I would say it's one of the perks of getting older, but when you pay $100+ for lenses alone due to your bad eyesight, it's not much of a perk lmao.
---
No but in all seriousness, I do enjoy the weather sometimes. It can be extremely scary as hell. One time was questing and couldn't even see in front of my character due to fog - ended up aggroing a bunch of stuff because I had no idea they were there.
---
Nice work, but wrong sub.
---
The layer doesn't know or care how many people are in Crossroads or even the Barrens. Each layer is an entire copy of Azeroth. The whole thing. They exist to stack players so more can play.
---
If there are typically 6 layers of 3,000 players each all playing on the same server then when Blizzard turns off layers that turns into 3,000 people playing and 15,000 in the queue.
---
Cheaters are lame
---
You are absolutely right about that, I agree.
---
i wasted like couple of hours doing this this weak o.o
---
Don‚Äôt reply if you‚Äôre not ready for a response, go be a dick elsewhere.
---
But wasn't it all greed on BOE?
---
Harrasment is still harrasment. I know about Asmongold, but just because he can handle it and downplay it expertly doesn't mean everyone can or that all harrasment is equal. Harrasment should still not be encouraged, and seeing as this is happening in the game, it should be dealt with by Blizzard.
---
Just take a glance at a few of the comments here ‚Äúretail baby omegalul‚Äù and I‚Äôm here like ‚Äúbitch I played vanilla not the knockoff cheap ass private server u wasted all ur time and energy on just to play classic once it was released‚Äù. The best one yet is ‚Äú it worked in classic therefore it‚Äôs not a bug‚Äù ???????? What lmao
---
Sorry, I knew what I wanted and went pve. We can't all think 30 seconds into the future.
---
No you need to listen to /u/homingstar 's rules, ganking lowbies magically doesn't fit the definition of player vs player. He's obviously very informed of the long-term results that ganking cause.
---
Found the ganker
---
I remember it having fp in vanilla

This is the best summary for the status quo currently (imho): [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/buff-limit-appears-to-be-22-in-classic-has-been-cited-by-blizzard-as-32-in-vanilla/297594](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/buff-limit-appears-to-be-22-in-classic-has-been-cited-by-blizzard-as-32-in-vanilla/297594)

I did this to an orc yesterday
---
I feel this deep in my soul.
---
sure, next time watch the video before making things up, and you can happily avoid such situations and blend in happily with the sheep that are oh so upset about a video that is not even about someone killing someone 8 levels apart, but about the absurd pathing.
---
With my friends we play a game in stv. We have a lvl35 in the group but we are 50+, some 60. We try to find ally players of lvl 30-40 and proceed to sheep/control them until our lvl 35 friend arrives. We then stand in a circle and encourage the alliance player with emotes and let him duel our friend. If he wins he wins and is free to go, we let our friend die. If he dies to our friend we will let him go after he reses. 
---
But if he tries to run away, that's a lack of honor and deserves to get punished ! 
---
We had a lot of fun and very interesting duels to watch all night !
---
Pretty sure this sort of harassment is against TOS. Anything you do that will purposefully ruin the fun for others is  bannable (I'm paraphrasing). Also, group up and kick their collective asses.
---
You're reading the table wrong I think. The reason weapon skill is overpowered is raid bosses being effectively lv63, and how level difference is designed to rapidly scale down your ability to do dmg.
---
What +7 skill does is reduce the difference between enemy defense (315) and your weapon skill (base 300) from 15 to 8, so you gain around 3% hit, 35%-&gt;7% loss on glancing etc. FROM ONE SLOT. Goes without saying that's huge when it comes to maximizing for damage/threat/mitigation in your other slots.
---
Lmao guy used to be in my guild.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre in the wrong here. 
---
All the rogue did was distract. Then you snapped.
---
I just hit 25 yesterday (warrior, and I am playing since day 1 xD), I barely have time to play as is, I wouldn't reroll lol.
---
You bring shame upon the alliance
---
I'm really glad my guild is RF friends so I dont have be part of the AOE cancer.
---
Went and started his own guild after leaving and rejoining cause he didn‚Äôt like the leadership or members or something along those lines.
---
Unfortunately he's not watcher Backus. "An actual npc in that zone"
---
1. WoW will definitely fill your spare time. It will consume it. It will hoover up any and all spare time you have. No one knows how long WoW classic will last but at minimum prolly a year.
---
2. Talents are whatev honestly. For either spec just go into the pet tree until you get your bearings.First respec is cheap. Beast Mastery/Demonology
---
3.All classes are wanted/needed in the end game but some are definitly better than others. Some classes are limted by thier best role in a raid but hunter/warlock dont worry about that.
---
First stepping foot in stv at lvl 42 was a good choice for me.
---
Its pretty obvious you never played on a pvp server ehdgre6your faction was in a 1:2 minority or worse
---
I didn't play vanilla, but it's my policy as a miner in Classic so far.  Even traded with horde once (am on a PvE server), we cleared a cave that neither of us could safely solo.  He got the xp, cause I didn't care, and he ended up giving me an extra hit on a few nodes.
---
There's no need for this childish remark, it only makes your argument worse.
---
If you want to go Brackenwall village to camp Taurajo, you literally fly over Camp Taurajo, do 2 laps around the Crossroads, and go back again. Walking is way faster
---
Yawn Asmon carried again
---
Just shows everything wrong with this broken unbalanced class.
---
There is NO honor in this. They will come for us now, all of them
---
I‚Äôd like to add that due to spellbatching it will 100% Crit your next cast time spell + an instant spell that‚Äôs chained behind it. Crazy dmg
---
it's pretty funny
---
Its generally makes sense. What if in classic blizzard will rebalance talents in another way? Not like it was back in days, but differently.
---
There is absolutely no way of telling yet, as classic is completely different then vanilla. But on my old server they used to go from a few hundred to 1000+ gold. each.
---
Please dont! I need them to charge / intercept to move faster! But I always kill after charge!
---
Obviously not, as most people are still leveling as we speak. The amount will only increase as time goes on. If you don't like it, there's other options of servertypes.
---
It wasn't like this back in the day. Grey-ganking was seen as pathetic. It was so unpopular that people who did it often  would become infamous in a good or a bad way. It's just the gamer culture lately that is shitty.
---
Yup, if you create a group you'll most often be up and running within 5 minutes
---
You should get the Tome of Cabal at the same time you accept the quest, so no you shouldn't have to recollect any items.
---
Being a feral, I down know if I should thanks paladins that are buffing me with this and not might. Like... thanks but could be better...
---
It makes for some super fun experiences.
---
Me and a friend just walking on our way, getting jumped by a lvl ?? rogue and just barely killing him with both of us surviving... He released so fast we didn't even have time to /chicken his corpse :(
---
Getting Hunter's Mark and a hunter nuking me while attacking a shadowmaw panther, managing to sprint/ vanish away, only to come back and destroy him from stealth opener...
---
Getting ganked by a 6 lvls higher priest in Uldaman, then from spirit form see that he doesn't attack anyone close to his level... Calling my lvl 60 friend, and then corpse camping said priest 5+ times, until he brings in a group of reinforcements... Eventually turned into a zone-wide gank war :P
---
I hate this place.
---
Never ganked anyone before personally.
---
No its no
---
After level 30 you shoudnt loose against Hunters. Travel Form, Feral Charge, Cat movement + Sprint is just to much for Hunters to keep you at distance.
---
#nohomo
---
Yup rogue was just being cheeky and this guy went full schizo. He should've killed him for being an undead rogue, not for kidding around.
---
I don‚Äôt know if they reverted it back to its ultra-overpowered state in classic or not. But the Rocket helm was a fucking godsend against gankers. You basically wear it ALL THE TIME on a pvp server. It's cloth and it has shit stats but it will save your ass. It has a range of about 30ft, it will last for the full 30 seconds even against other players, can be used in combat, and it never backfires. 
---
When I was level 35ish in STV with my friends, We got attacked by a 60 hunter. I just rocket helmed him then we all scattered and hid. By the time he broke out of that 30 second stun we were long gone. If a 60 rogue jumps you, you usually only have a couple of seconds where you are able to control your character after their stunlock (right before you die). Rocket helm will save you there too but a rogue ganker is more likely to be prepared to break CC, so it's better if you can get him to blow his cooldown on fear or something else before you use it.
---
It saved me against level 60's so many times in the original wow. The goblin mind control hat is also amazing, especially in alterac valley but that's a whole separate rant. The trick is to get get 235 engineering as soon as you hit level 35.
---
Thank you so much. I skimmed through initially when I installed questie but didn't see this. 
---
This will make it so much nicer!
---
How low lvl Horde on a RPPVP realm get into a major city is beyond me.
---
Everyone mad at this lives in the middle of nowhere and have barely seen a beach in their life. Cringe when people tell you to ‚Äúgo enjoy the beach‚Äù when you can hike, surf, fish, go to the beach anytime you want.
---
I blame retail for teaching people that speed and numbers are important... also thanks mythic gaming for ruining mid level play.
---
For anyone wondering, the DPS listed only shows one decimal, however, I can assure you that the DPS is actually 33.33, repeating, of course.
---
You can use the goblin AH to transfer cross-faction but you need a trustworthy friend to do so as you can't buy your own auctions.

Thank you for saying this, yes on twitch I have stated in my 'about me' that I am transgender, and I do this because people ask regardless so I have it stated where it can be seen by whoever may come through. I deal with a lot of trolls and I generally brush it off, theres no point in fighting people about any of it... but this is literally ruining my game experience, and my twitch stream.
---
I'm a druid and while I'm kinda bad I seen one druid kick the ass of a high level Hunter by casting hybernate on his pet, entangled and moonfired the hunter, then catformed to fight. There's alot of spells to utilize and switching forms and getting them down takes alot of time
---
Start with the default position of if it's an upgrade for the character you are currently on, need on it. Those drops are why you are there. You don't need to ask and you don't need to apologize for playing the game.
---
For Pugs: if someone is paying close enough attention that they get upset you're winning all the loot that's an upgrade for you, that is their own internal issues they shouldn't figure out how to deal with. If you play the nice guy and handicap yourself by only rolling on one or two things you need, nobody is going to notice or care. Your sacrifice was for nothing.
---
For friends and guild pre-gearing: You could go with the pug standards, but it is going to be more of a benefit to the group as a whole if you have planned out who is getting what. gearing the tank and healer first it's going to get everyone fully geared faster.
---
I usually give all mana potions to the nearest caster. The statistics aren‚Äôt looking good so far, most people just accept them and move on without acknowledging me.
---
yeah, the only way to do it would be to use the Neutral Auction house, and this costs a fair bit of money. Also, you need to be very quick, as folk snipe the neutral AH all the time looking for folk doing this and posting stuff for low prices just to save on the AH cut. 
---
You'd need to get a friend to buy them for you when you post them...best way to do it is be on a voice channel with them, and do it in sync.
---
Ooh I get your angle your angry cos I said afk haha makes me chuckle IRL
---
Put up a linen cloth or something for 100g or however much you want to transfer on the neutral ah then buy it on your Horde character.
---
It is extremely costly though as the neutral ah cut is 30%. So you'll lose 30% of your money doing this.
---
you gonna have a frickin great time
---
It must be hard being that fucking retarded
---
yes, that's the compromise it's been for now :D
---
but I've also seen that if someone won the chest and looted it and another one had a need for a recipe, the winner then wanted to sell it, because well, he already won it. It's douchebaggery IMHO, but also reasonable if you win the whole chest
---
Got in the way of the GOGOGO attitude
---
My argument is sound; if you're expecting chivalry and fairness on a pvp server you're wrong. Complaining about getting ganked in any fashion is weak when you have the means to prevent it before it even occurs.
---
You can fd/trap and scattershot to get out of melee its not the easiest class to pvp with but neither the hardest
---
"NP send nudes"
---
Dont forget to use sacrifice just before he dies/despawn!

---
This right here is why I decided to roll a mage, aside from teleporting convenience. 
---
No need to buy water and food when it's available at all times with a spell.
---
I realized I am 60 rogue, for couple days in a new server and didnt go and gank people. I should do some tonight instead of bis hunting.
---
Doesn't always work though when supply is essentially infinite. One early morning on retail (months ago) there was this quest active that gives you AP for certain crafting items. The ingredients where about 70g in the AH, and the price for the item was at 4.4K. It was just absolutely crazy. So I just made like as many of those as I could and set them in at 4K, 3.8K, 3.6K, etc. as soon as it stopped selling for 2-3 minutes I'd undercut myself (and everyone else) substantially until people started buying again. I made almost 200K gold (~one token) in 15 minutes, but I also slashed the price from 4.4K to 200g within that time. Let's just say I got a few whispers from people who were *not* amused. But there was really no way to stop it, because if they had bought the items I could've just made more pretty much endlessly.
---
Yes. Also write down that person's name. When the time comes, you'll know what to do with it.
---
I really appreciate the outlook and advice, thank you so much.
---
It‚Äôs easier with fewer people down to a point, easier to spread out and fewer places for whelps to go.  Just takes longer.
---
You misspelt alliance
---
Because they have been betrayed too many times.
---
Been hoarding Linen and Wool since I've started (level 19 atm).
---
Is it worth it to do First Aid on a druid ? I have no downtime already, and when I do, the issue is more related to mana than health
---
This is a superb view !
---
That's the spirit
---
so i'm about to make you really sad but whille leveling my priest i didn't realize how obvious it would be to spec into both spirit tap and wand for leveling purposes untill i was halfway trough 40 and someone mentioned it randomly in trade chat.
---
i felt dumb. i respecced imedietly. i'm not 100% sure i actually feel a major difference but i'm sure it's there(getting a new much improved wand at the same time makes it hard to figure out how much better the spec is)
---
Really? 1:15? For me its legitimately closer to 15:1. Sounds like a rough server to play on.
---
Its the RPG element of the class. Warrior has WW axe quest, Shamans have totem quests, rogue has Lockpicking. All classes have different things to offer that require time and effort.
---
You can choose not to level it up, same as a druid could opt not to do water form quest, or shaman not to bother getting totem quest. But its a core element of the class and you will just get laughed at for not having it.
---
I was given a level 60 stam buff on my mage just as I rolled up into the crossroads. I felt like the chosen one for 30 minutes lol
---
Honestly it could go either way. As more people hit 60, the supply is going to increase. Whereas as more people hit 60, the demand for bags and other craftables will rise. I would expect the price to decrease just with how heavily farmed BRD will be,
---
Yeah, no way that a rogue beats a good pvp paladin
---
This is classic alliance approach. He stealthed and distracted, that's why I need to kill him and camp the lower levels of his guildmates for the next 8 months!
---
Yesterday was actually the first time I proactively engaged in WPvP.
---
I was a level 40 druid and in desolace to buy otherwise hard to get recipes from the bot-vendors. When I was done a Lvl 37 WL in chat asked for assistance against the horde who had been annoying him.
---
So I thought: Well, not really in the mood to look for a new task for myself, so I might aswell do that and let him invite me.
---
There were about 5-6 horde in the area but they weren't grouped up or something, so his idea was to single them out and have some consecutive 2v1s. Most of them were lower level too.
---
Of course that didn't work out as planned and we quickly ended up in 2vs3 or even 2vs4.
---
It was a nice little back and forth. And I finally got the confirmation that I had picked exactly the right class for exactly the right reason. Druid's survivability in OpenPvP is amazing! I lost my WL-Pal several times and was completely outnumbered then. But I managed to escape every single time and cause some panic with my mere presence and the threat of popping out of stealth once people had gone back to attacking their questmobs.
---
Later on I happily quested in another area of the map but since the players there weren't involved in the skirmish from before it was completely peaceful again.
---
&gt; This seems to be the same ‚Äúempty loot window‚Äù bug which has been affecting 1/2-3/4 of beast mobs.
---
Is that really a bug? I assumed it was just "no loot on this mob"
---
One day!
---
Neither would pressing frost nova and blizzard LOL, thats even fewer clicks per mob than your frostbolt rotation
---
No problemo! I‚Äôm really glad that this goofy post ended up alerting a lot of folks to this feature and how to use it!
---
It\`s a common thing for everyone on PVP server.... And yes , you are looking for a special treatment.
---
Dont. 
---
Take a deep breath and just charge. Go for the ranged ones or else you'll lose aggro on them. Tell the dps to allow some time for you to build aggro. 
---
You can do it. 
---
Ps. Not advisable if no aoe on your team.
---
Damn i play every evening and thought that was alot, but am only half your ./played.. i need to step my game up! Grats on 60 my brother
---
I don't think you can even make chars from both factions on the same server?
---
Anyway, the way to do it is via neutral AH's in Gadgetzan/ Booty Bay, but you lose some 15-20% of money. I.e. post some crap grey item for 100 gold with your gnome, and then buy it with your horde char.
---
Way to understand the context of the discussion
---
Corrupted Ashbringer : Am I a joke to you?
---
Man I was probably at first 10 rogue who capped but never went back to gank people. I feel stupid now.
---
Not talents, but enchants on your gear counts as a buff. I'm a bit hazy but think it was that way in vanilla as well. Those enchant buffs are invisible and can't be pushed off.
---
Warrior stance or druid form occupies a buff slot as well, but that one is visible.
---
If the supply it's essentially infinte, compared to the demand, seems to me like the price should be lower then ü§î
---
Might aswell, Linen/Wool arn't worth that much, and with bandages you wont have to spend as much mana on heals
---
If I cry hard enough, i can generate more mana for the next Starfire.
---
This is Blackrock Depths. Near the end of the instance is a massive cathedral-style room with upwards of 100 to 200 non-elite npc spawns that have less than a 30 second respawn timer. They are very weak, and give a small amount of XP when they die. A group of 3 mages, 1 warlock, and 1 priest can stand outside the room, and have the warlock use eye of killrog to pull dozens at a time. When they all shuffle out of the room to kill the warlock, the mages frost nova/cone of cold/arcane explosion everything down, while the warlock repeats the process to pull more, and the priest makes sure nobody dies. There's a lot of specific stuff like frost nova orders, LoS perfection, good positioning, reset location if everything goes to shit, etc. that can be major factors between a 50k xp/hr group and a 150k xp/hr group, but that's the gist of it. The instance is for level 50-60 players, but i would recommend at least 52 so mobs don't resist you. You'll also be hard pressed to find a group that will take you if you're not a mage, priest, or warlock.
---
Didn't feel like summoning 37 morons who couldn't take a zeppelin from Org and press numlock to ZG.
---
My server has the opposite problem. Allies and Horde have some unspoken rule where players USUALLY do not attack on sight. It's only attack if you see your faction get attacked or there's some competition for mobs/quest. 
---
Which is a let down but I do understand that there really isn't any incentive to engage a fight (fair or not) when all it rewards is downtime to your leveling. (Aside from fun I guess)
---
Blizz really needs to implement wpvp honor system asap. Without it, people really don't bother.
---
They did.
---
&gt; Screech elsewhere.
---
err, you?
---
I would love a night time slider so I can have proper dark skies with the updated lighting engine. Would be amazing.
---
Right but if it's so easy in what way is it a badge of honor? Contradicts the guy I was replying too and a large majority of parties I've been in without mages the tank hasn't had much trouble holding aggro on 2-4 mobs, especially if there's a caster he can ignore to focus down first.
---
And this is why I love classic.
---
You also need the Insane title.
---
You can do the same with hamstring and rend, just a tip
---
100% this, let's not pretend; both sides are guilty of this and all the other cowardly things we accuse the other faction of doing.
---
The bridge leading up to her is the most beautiful place in WoW.
---
Putting aside that there will always be someone complaining about your game, no matter what you do, it is also, as has been said, that Blizzard's solutions to these "problems" were worse than the initial situation.
---
I can't say that I really remember those four being big complaints and I spent quite a lot of time around the forums too before they were redesigned with Cataclysm. I admit that I started playing in TBC though so the situation I encountered back then was a different one.
---
Point 1. and 4. and can be explained quite easily despite many factors playing into the grind you mention in point 4. The reward you earned is more satisfying than the one that was given to you and convenience breeds boredom. With the leveling process and many other of the RPG aspects of the game trivialized the game overshot a level of convenience that left it feeling unsatisfying. I hope people have come to the same conclusion over time which is why they appreciate Vanilla's design more nowadays.
---
As for point 2. I remember that complaint being quite frequent in TBC and Wrath, before the talent trees were changed significantly. I feel back then it was rather true but it doesn't apply to Vanilla completely. If you go and look for class guides you will find that most classes have many different builds available and people still discuss many of the talent point allocations in the builds that are deemed the norm.
---
The current talents on retail are little more than situational perks and since there's little commitment to them they don't foster character identity very well. For the game, situational talents might be more engaging design but from an RPG point of view the old talent tree design is certainly the more rewarding system.
---
As for point 3. I think people just came to appreciate the curious fun of how counterintuitive parts of Vanilla can be. Also, since Blizzard's solution to this was to force players to play the way they want and wear the items they want them to wear, the solution here just feels restricting. Taking agency and choice away from the player because you fail to improve your design does not make your game more fun. Even if it was only the illusion of choice.
---
To conclude I just want to make clear that I judge the game's design based entirely on what I think would make a good RPG and Vanilla is the part of WoW that has come closest to that in my eyes.
---
First aid is always recommended (pvp uses).  
---
That being said if you‚Äôre looking for an alternate use of cloth, major cities (stormwind, Orgrimmar etc) have a cloth quartermaster that asks you to donate 60 pieces of wool (and later on silk and others cloth) in exchange for xp. Easy quest if you have stuff laying around.
---
TBC made a lot more stuff viable though. Thats the most important part
---
Quche or... douche?
---
Everyone does this.
---
The horde are no different from alliance people.
---
There's just more of them.
---
As you are leveling your bags get full. Whenever you are in a village clearing your bags, send the valuable stuff to the bank alt. Continue leveling and repeat. The next day login to your bank alt first. Pick up all the mail and sell it then switch over to your main.
---
There is a video where the hunter kites to princess and killed it just before her, less downtime
---
Feelsbad
---
&gt; People care about trade goods and potions
---
as this never has been a problem for me, I didn't account that. You opened my eyes, thanks
---
Always if it's a rogue.
---
Im having a blast with my Sham! Until 40 windfury was fun and now with elemental i can 2 shot someone every 3 mins.
---
I'm not trying to say afk players should go play on pve server if thats how it came across then my bad. What I'm trying to say is that people who seriously complain about world pvp should (of any kind) should play on a pve server. 
---
&gt;  Your actions aren't making the place more dangerous 
---
I guess we simply disagree on that point, because I would say that thinking "I can't go do x IRL before I'm back in town" does make the place feel more dangerous.
---
One of the failings of us humans is that we are so quick to be dismissive of others opinions when they don't mesh with our own.
---
That and those people are just idiots.
---
Dude I'm just gona put this out there, bots have evolved a great deal since 15 years, designer ones are capabble pvp'ers and will defend themselves if attacked for instance or can farm arenas literally duo'ing with another bot.
---
I don‚Äôt know if they reverted it back to its ultra-overpowered state in classic or not. But the Rocket helm was a fucking godsend against gankers. You basically wear it ALL THE TIME on a pvp server. It's cloth and it has shit stats but it will save your ass. It has a range of about 30ft, it will last for the full 30 seconds even against other players, can be used in combat, and it never backfires.
---
It saved me against level 60's so many times in the original wow. The trick is to get get 235 engineering as soon as you hit level 35. 
---
The goblin mind control hat is also amazing, especially in alterac valley but that's a whole separate rant. You can use it to cause raid wipes, or make a level 60 kill his friend. 
---
One time we set a trap for some alliance, my buddy was a resto shaman and he put on his afk flag and started making potions in the middle of the road facing a wall. I was a rogue hidden nearby with the mindcontrol hat, and our other 2 friends were a warlock &amp; warrior mounted up, hiding under a bridge nearby. If the alliance walked past the shaman, we left them alone, but if they attacked we sprung the trap.
---
3 alliance that were about level 50 saw him and started dooing that feet shuffling thing where you know they are talking about attacking. As soon as they attacked, my shaman friend spun around and interrupted the mages cast, I sapped one of them and mindcontrolled their mage and set him to agressive on the 3rd guy. Then we stood back and watched as the mage chased and pyroblasted his friends to death, it was so funny.
---
Gnarly grind
---
That's cause Alliance works irl during the day.
---
There are some sites but it's mostly just API reference. Which you will need, a LOT. I think the site was called wowprogramming but it might've been discontinued or something? It was made for the old wow programming book.
---
Other than that, you should read up some Lua tutorials (very simple language) and read a bunch of other addons that do something similar to what you want to achieve.
---
Ah I thought it was only reputation. Do you know how much XP would that be ?
---
For the record, if i see any opposite faction mage AoE farming its automatically kill on sight
---
I‚Äôve done the chest one 100x
---
Saw a chest in SM that my group didn‚Äôt notice was there, so i let them go ahead of me for a bit, and opened the chest. Shadowfang was in the chest so i ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù dropped group so they wouldn‚Äôt see what i looted and asked them to reinvite. They did. 
---
If I‚Äôm unlocking chests and lose the agreed chest roll, I‚Äôm taking the silver. As a tip, you know? Swift thistle is automatically mine too btw. 
---
I‚Äôm also pickpocketing every npc in a pull before i open. (Sorry tanks)
---
Blind and sapped a priest right before he could finish his mining node and claimed it for my own
---
Ganked 2 random guys in a group to the point they took Rez sickness. And yes, if they pulled a mob id let them die to the NPC for that extra 10% durability loss
---
can‚Äôt think of anymore that I‚Äôve done, but this sure made me chuckle while i kill some time at work!
---
Thanks :)
---
Can you explain why reckoning is so good at solo farming? isent it just a single target damage boost? if thats the case then ret would be just as good?
---
Just wait and sell it later for a lot, like rly a lot. Its one of THE best items in the game.
---
You get it 3 days after turning in the quest
---
Last time someone did this in the middle of Stangle, I destroyed the sh*t out of the guy. I hope he Enjoyed the walk back as a ghost
---
doubt the demand is much higher than the supply until bwl :P
---
lol they wish. Rogues just vanish or sprint and paladin cant catch.
---
the apples to oranges is the best analogy, are you going to beat a raid using the same strategy for druid tank and war tank, probably not.
---
We managed to do it once, but it just goes on for hours and hours and its hard to have bodyguards for that long :\ He somehow always convinces these lvl60s to come gank me with him. That means a lot though, thanks for the kind words!
---
Majority of the mages playing mage may not like mage. They just wanted to play ‚Äúthe highest dps class‚Äù or ‚Äúeveryone says this is the best‚Äù etc
---
Bank, AH and mailbox all within arms reach. very conventient place to trade from
---
Nah. Upgrading a single piece of gear doesn‚Äôt really impact levelling speed (unless you weapon is &gt;10 lvls below you). You‚Äôll outlevel it
---
Name three streamers that abused layering? First to come to mind is Venruki and Ziqo. If I had the interest in finding more, surely google could help.
---
IceHUD
---
If you did less dmg than the healer who used his wand, maybe i can understand. But seems ubreasinable and a waste of time if you aren‚Äôt wiping the group or anything
---
I couldn't do this. I feel so pity killing an innocent player doing his stuff. :)
---
3 weeks into classic. Quit my job 2 weeks into it.
---
(Was gonna quit anyways but not for another 6months but hey)
---
You don't need gold/hr if you only play an hr a day!
---
Everyone is equally terrible and shit and shouldn't be given any thought or attention. *Especially* those that care about karma or moderation on reddit.com
---
It‚Äôs usable, but no one likes it because it won‚Äôt attack everyone like it did originally.
---
I agree with you, but I made the OC so I figured I had done enough lol
---
I think you've read far too much into a couple of curse words.
---
I just cummed
---
Thats a valid concern when it comes to finding a raid spot at level cap. Mages are ridiculously over represented.
---
Goblin Grinder?
---
Neutral cut is 30%
---
I don't have a problem with that, but I also don't feel comfortable with it. For me it's like, the whole group made an effort to get the chest, so everybody should get something for it.
---
I do get the initial role for the trade good items - not a big loss, but a nice plus if you win the roll. Items on the other hand should get into the hands for needers without extra costs though.
---
Google aoe mage farm guide for a list of fantastic gank spots.
---
I was looking for advice on what I could do within Classic WoW, as it has stopped any and all progression within my game. I apologize if I didn't make that more apparent.
---
This is so me please make it stop
---
Because he could kill someone 10+ lvls above him

Ganking lobbies in teams of 4 or more*

Horde on Stalagg
---
Weird, let me check with borick(Creator of guidelime)
---
There is a setting under the ‚Äútarget‚Äù tab where you can set the gold dragon to appear. It looks weird on the square frame though.
---
1. Is it worth of investing my time into it?  - 100%, its a great game with loads to do solo or in groups.  You can play small amounts or loads. 
---
2. I am deciding between 2 of the classes - Hunters and locks are both great fun to play. I had a main hunter back in vanilla, and loved it. It'll be my 2nd alt character once I get my main (shaman) to 60. 
---
3. Are there any meta classes?  Unless you are in a high end raiding guild (which as a new player with limited time prob wont happen, then you can raid and do end game as any class you choose. Get into a good social guild and you'll have plenty of players to run instances with. 
---
Thank you very much. Sorry for my English if you find some bad mistakes.
---
Certified big chonk
---
I think that‚Äôs around Arathi highlands lvl?
---
Got there /u/toolatetopush that button
---
Epic Mount, clearly. There is not really a reason to go full pre raid BiS considering how easy they are.
---
&gt; It's nice if they choose to do so but they shouldn't feel pressured into giving anything away.
---
I guess that's a good solution. And as I'm naive enough to believe in the kindness of classic players, I think most of them would give items to needers anyway
---
Do people know you are playing the vending machine?
---
Not a ton, like 600 or something for wool, 1600 silk etc. You'd still see leveling guides suggest you do this while passing by.
---
I know i'm late to the party but if you think mage is top dps at all stages of the game you must of never played vanilla in any form, a shitty geared fury war will be beating a mage in every tier and you can even check warcraftlogs now to see that
---
I played paladin
---
why is loot ninjaing suddenly a form of griefing too much for you?
---
Don't you enjoy getting griefed?
---
Looks &gt; Racial talents. You're going to spend a lot of time looking at that midget with an annoying voice.
---
Also humans get reputation buffs, and if you're new/casual, this is probably better
---
Let's play. I'll bring my priest.
---
&gt; very skilled rogue 
---
Yea not if they target is also moderately skilled. FAP potions, relentless orc racial and other stun breakers will set the tone.
---
Yep, if i would have tried to solo it before them, they probably would have done the same.
---
At the end of a dungeon a tank will probably take a couple stacks for questing. Locks might take some as well, hunters if their pet eats bread can use it. Anyone with mana should desire water unless it's lower than what they can buy from vendors.
---
this sounds very reasonable
---
I don‚Äôt get this :c
---
I guess they feel more outside the context of intended game behaviour, I guess it‚Äôs pretty arbitrary
---
my vanilla main was a hunter, loved it, and raided up till Cata was released. I enjoyed PVPing as a hunter and got to level 12. 
---
But in tBC i leveled a shammy and played it resto, loved healing and also pvping. had a good 31-0-21 spec which meant I could still heal end game easy enough, but could also PVP and have great fun playing it. 
---
I started classic as a shammy and loving it.
---
Um achckually invincible means indestructible not not visible.
---
It‚Äôs not gay if the penis is detachable, brah.
---
Its okay if youre married or below 15
---
Ganking a gray &amp; making a video about it.
---
Show us on the doll where uncle hurt you.
---
I always ask if I get in a group with mage, but I don't bother them if we aren't in group.
---
If I remember correctly Blizzard said it was because players who always played a certain times of the day/night complained that they only ever saw the same cycle.
---
It's Questie. The quest doesn't exist yet, but Questie thinks it does.
---
OP mixing up invisible and invincible.
---
oh look, we got ourselves a mage player
---
FYI no rogue can kill a frost mage unless they choose their opener time VERY well. it's just op as hell, not just for PvP kite but for aoe farming, spellcleave, single target DPS... basically top in everything
---
Well at 50+ you‚Äôd expect better but before that? No way lol
---
Happened to a guildie, just relog and the pants will be there
---
nobody cares if you pull aggro in a 5 man instance since classic turned into an aoe shitfest.
---
Just got 60 on my warrior aswell. 9 days 8 hours /played
---
Im on Razorgore EU
---
Like others said, just abandon and restart. Alternatively you could go to the help menu, and there is an option for item restoration. It might be able to just get you that item back.
---
You do know most AFK players dont have a choice when they can leave. They don't think "oh I'm safe out here", its usually out of their hands.
---
Attacking people who can fight back and preventing safe travel across an area, that's making it more dangerous. But you keep justifying attacking AFK people for your PvP experience.
---
It doesn't really need some special composition. We used a Warlock for twins, other than that we just took with us whoever was available.
---
I mean, same thing is happening for Alliance, because it's not about faction, it's about people
---
If that's what I wanted 
---
&gt;ErR, yOu?
---
Would be good enough for me.
---
I like it alot but after reading the comments looks like some people don‚Äôt :(
---
Early scaling favors druids stats-wise (especially armor bonus for the tanking).
---
That's the late scaling that changes, especially the weird itemization for non-healer spec among other things, hence the "takes more work".
---
thank you for the kind answers. I guess I have to rethink how chest-rolling works, as winning the whole chest sounds very reasonable.
---
I guess I have too much of a communist heart about what belongs to whom :D
---
On my server the raw materials for this cost like 50s max.... crafted price 3g+.
---
If you walk into a zone and all the mobs around you are orange or higher, it‚Äôs a good sign you‚Äôre in the wrong zone.
---
rolling for it is the fairest - they can't unlock the chest without you, but you don't get that chest without the group
---
they could also just go into a city and find a rogue to open it if you won't open it for them
---
Hold on to it, couple months from now could be a few 100g. Drops are more regular now because everyone and their mother is leveling through STV. Drop is stil only 0.01%.
---
There are differing opinions to this but if you as a group got to that point by everyone using their class to its potential a rogue using theirs only for themselves seems like a pretty dick move. Wouldn't that be like warlocks charging their group for summons and a mage charging their group for conjuring food or something? All are aspects that are part of their class-kits.
---
 Just seems easier to roll for it and not be a greedy douche and in the long run at worst you might loose out on some loot but you won't have a bad reputation.
---
&gt; And I‚Äôm sure after the expansion you‚Äôll just come back to life again.
---
You mean first 5 minutes of the expansion. BTW HERE IS A GIZMO THAT LETS YOU GO IN AND OUT OF SHADOWLANDS AS YOU WILL BTW
---
I am horde and this is disgraceful
---
Don't even know his name anymore.
---
I think this is the same on both sides. Because you don't remember the random encounters with normal players. I feel that only kiddies are playing Horde most of the time. I guess it is actually pretty balanced.
---
Depends on the ratio of layers to population I'd say. (Or even just what the default layer you get put into is.) You definitely wouldn't be able to pull 4 mobs in STV on my layer, because there aren't even 4 mobs alive at the same time lol.
---
Getting the troll kills is especially interesting, because there are so many horde players there that it can be hard to tell at times if it's a horde player or a mob. Most players from opposite factions completely ignore each other because starting a fight is just not worth it (would be an endless fight), so you want to be sure you don't accidentally start one. But taking 1 second to check it is too much time, someone else will have already tagged it.
---
Super kaizo world special stage 2. Fuck that level.
---
You should do more of these for new players.
---
I've found that if you help a horde kill a mob or two while running by they are much less likely to attack you, if it's a high level I know I can't outrun I try to sheep them and then /beg rather than run.
---
Like I said in my comment, I already did. The install button opens twitch app, but does nothing else after that. And like I said, I'd rather not do the manual download as I like twitch app managing all my apps so that there's no need to do manual updates of them.
---
Ensure you're full of ammo at the beginning. Have enough food so that you don't beg people for pet food. Don't tab target. Turn off growl.
---
If you do these things, nobody should call you any names or look down on you at all.
---
You misspelled Horde
---
in the overworld, yes. how else am i to frontload my dps before wanding?
---
I think you should go Horde with the other animals.
---
I too can only play a couple of hours a day. That's why I rerolled on a PVE server. Is not the same but I don't have time to be ganked.
---
I played on 2005 on a PVP and got ganked and also ganked some players. But I don't remember any of that as a special feeling that I want to remember on classic as "the classic experience" so I'm very happy in the PVE one.
---
how did you do a dungeon with 0 mages
---
He prepared. Why would I go in stealth and distract if I didn't want to get closer and cheap shot. He could have just...go his merry way.
---
Yes, but supposedly it's either bugged or intentionally changed to prevent griefing. There were some posts complaining about it, saying that if it can't find anything to attack it just despawns, and doesn't pulse AOE if you banish it - or something along those lines.
---
So im currently lvl 42 human priest and im wondering what the spell named 'Feedback' is good for?
---
Ya, If they're not close to dungeon i'll just find another person
---
I'm not much higher than you (27 priest). I have tailoring and skinning. I've lost money on tailoring so far. I've got it leveled up to like 145 or so and I've had to purchase materials to get it this high. Skinning has been pure profit up to this point. I've attempted to skin all my eligible kills, I also skin all corpses I come across that have not been skinned. I definitely can't give you a total but it's my most reliable income so far. I've gotten it up to level 225 already, I'm getting a nice mix of medium and heavy leather at this point. At the beginning even ruined leather scraps is still worth I think 7c at the vendor, that's better than nothing.
---
Fair enough, but that's also blizzard incompetence by letting those people beta instead of actual testers.
---
So did any of the big guilds get banned to the layering exploit?
---
That's the case with looting creatures you dont necessarily get loot from every kill, but with fishing you always catch something if your successful.
---
God damn I would have cringed seeing that up there for 50g, particularly if I wasn‚Äôt in a position to buy it!
---
What a score! Grats dude.
---
Look at this weak minded fool
---
I will being using this instead of Questie because the main issue I had with unassisted quest was I forget where the directions are and have to re-check 90000000 times before I remember :)
---
Arrghhh... Not always.
---
There is a guy on my server atm who ruined the market for heavy leather.
---
I think they sell for 1,7 silver a piece of something at the vendor, and he sells them for 1,9 at the AH. I lose gold if i have to do that.
---
So i start buying them and reselling them at a proper price, but them... bam.. 20 mins later he is up with more in the same low price. 
---
So i whisp him, politely ofc. and asks if he even knows that he is losing gold on it. And he acts surprised and says he will change prices.
---
Then the next fucking day he puts heavy leather up for 2 silver now. 
---
Ive even talked to more people leveling, no one is able to sell heavy leather, but leather below and higher is np.
---
I'm the guy that "/train"s when i randomly encounter a group on the road that is travelling in the same direction. Yet to experience a /train in return though. Makes me cry :'(
---
I was using kals-todolist until now but your addon looks better, will give it a try :-)
---
Dude, this is a really cool thing! As a professional software developer with nearly 20 years of experience I'm ashamed to admit I never had the will to sit down and write an addon myself. Really nice piece of work you got there, congratulations!
---
...played since launch,  4 days /played level 30...am i really that far behind?
---
On my server at least 'LFG' is pretty dead, 'LookingForGroup' seems to be the main channel for finding dungeon groups.
---
You don't.
---
I did the whole quest at 30 with a 41 mage friend in 2 hours flat. And it's a really good investment time wise because you won't have to hunt for new weapons until 40++.
---
You should bind arcane explosion. Had plenty of globals you could've used it to end that rogue sooner. Well done with kill anyway
---
No...that is artistic freedom.
---
Didn't think very much except "Go die fucker".
---
The smile when I saw him fire evasion was real though.
---
40% I think ou are just throwing numbers without checking anything. It's jsut based on your feelings. Here are the corret numbers:
---
* Warrior 16,1%
---
* Mage 15,5%
---
* Hunter 12,8%
---
* Priest 11,8%
---
* Rogue 11,6%
---
* Warlock 11,4%
---
* Shaman 6,2%
---
* Paladin 6%

Well, you clearly are above the the melee. Was grouped with the guy for more than 5 minutes, tanking, dpsing as a kitty and i received wisdom. I was like... why tho?

Reminds me of this scene from Trigun. https://youtu.be/fItvQaKsatM

Lol 40 man mage raids.  You‚Äôre being ridiculous.  Yes, mages are good I‚Äôm not denying that, but you‚Äôre being a little hyperbolic.

*Jaws: Insanely Small Dick Edition*

Killing fishing greys, SMH.
---
- 2 hours a day
---
- PvP server
---
- wasted 3 days in stv
---
You can disagree all you want but in vanilla everyone always killed everyone for the most part.  Classic feels like everyone is just rushing to 60 and avoiding pvp at all costs.
---
Do every quest, DE rewards. Run dungeons, DE everything you win. I believe enchantrix has a breakdown of what items turn into what, but there are plenty of resources online that tell you the items for best returns.
---
Just roll, and winner gets all. But remember; if the chest is locked, it defaults to the rogue.
---
You can use it in pvp against casters to punish them a little, that's about it. And cry that you weren't given fear ward :(
---
i plan do to so, next up is blackfathom deeps, i have footage up till maraudon already
---
because when wow first dropped they still did not have good design down when it comes to encounters. you see it in quest rewards too which were put together without regard of which class was used to complete it.   
---
all this and more were things they learned as they went on and many quality of life changes landed with BC.   
---
classic wow was good at its time, when compared to the likes of EQ and DAOC it was a breath of fresh air. it had many QOL improvements over those games but they still had far to go. that they made those changes is why WOW survived and prospered
---
Everyone before this message got killed by a ?? and is super butt hurt.
---
Gotta get that parkour
---
All that stuff was in Legion because WoD was abandoned.
---
As long as you are not buying skills you don't really need for leveling and anything other than bags and maybe wands in the ah, you should have enough money to get your lvl 40 mount just with herbalism.
---
Tailoring is really good to have until you make your truefaith vestments at 60 and then you can drop it for Smth else. Just make sure you don't sink much money into it until level 40. Just make what you can with the cloth you farm
---
I am going to get alchemy for instance after I make truefaith on my priest and no longer need the tailoring.
---
He just poked you a little and you where being a bitch let‚Äôs be honest
---
It's a chest, not lockbox, you can't carry it with you to the city.
---
Honestly this is probably the best way. Unfortunately I have to be at work at 630am. I usually play at 8pm-10pm after baby asleep. But weekend mornings with a cup of coffee and a sleeping family are all mine, until the baby demands to leave the crib around 9.
---
Ganking low level players on pvp servers is something you are allowed to do. That doesn't mean that you are not responsible for your own actions. If you act like a bully, don't be surprised to get called out on it.
---
Being on a pvp realm doesn't mean that you should kill every red thing that moves. It's the option that is important. You can choose to kill or not to kill. This creates a certain athmosphere in contested zones that is only available on pvp realms.
---
Tauren tanks have the best racial. Having the biggest dude in the raid tanking gives everyone +max reassurance.
---
Maybe he‚Äôs put points into improved Wisdom &amp; just applies it by default without thinking? Or maybe he‚Äôs trolling you.
---
My GF plays a mage &amp; she likes putting arcane int on warriors &amp; rogues just for a laugh. (Yes she knows it helps slightly with weapon skills.)
---
I‚Äôm part of this dad gamer life.
---
How is it a joke? OP I literally mixing those two up. Why should the avg user get a random joke that makes no sense except to a niche amount of people.
---
Ima Gouge Rouge yo
---
You should be able to get enough just from herbalism + quest  and vendor money.  But it could be wise to halt the progression in tailoring once it gets expensive and pick that up again post 40. 
---
I wouldn't drop it for skinning at this point.
---
Also make sure not to waste gold on skills you don't use. Most classes have a few skills that are not very important and you can save 5-10g by not buying them (you can always buyt hem later of course)
---
And finally don;t worry if you are dirt poor at lvl 20.  Most of the mount money is gained at lvl 36-40   Your income will grow exponentially.   Near lvl 40 you will have grey items selling for 1g and quests that yield 80s- 1g20  etc and a stack of herbs will sell for 2g-4g etc
---
I use FriendInfo add-on from curse. It shows notes in tooltip and who output.
---
thanks a lot for the details, i am a lvl 51 warlock and our guild might have people for this strat. sound great but a bit hard to pull it off
---
People want that easy cash
---
As long as they're all upgrades for you, go for it. Sometimes you win so much that you start to feel bad and decide to pass on the next item, totally up to you though. We're all subject to the same RNG, maybe you were losing all your rolls for a week and only now started getting lucky, who are we to judge?
---
&gt; They literally successfully sold a game twice 
---
They literally did not. The LITERALLY sold it first time. This time, they sold the access to the game, for a monthly sub.
---
So, LITERALLY, they didn't sell it twice.
---
But other than that, you are right.
---
Guys we found the rogue in the videoü§£ü§£ü§£

Ty for the tip on Auctionator vs. Auctioneer, I‚Äôve had a lot of difficulty with the fast scan and other functions locking up and crashing the WoW client, and it seems like it is buggy in general for Classic.  
---
Can anyone else weigh in on this?
---
UP YOU GO
---
Can‚Äôt. Not sub 30% health. Handle it.
---
I think he was trolling or having the ‚Äúnot my fucking job‚Äù mentality. Anyway, not a big issue at the end

Im sitting at 37 with 4 days, don't stress man some people just wanna be efficent.
---
Me and my bud are just doing whatever, keep switching zones, not sure what quests to do, just figuring it out

Yikes youre pathetic.. stfu you dweeb

Now I‚Äôm gonna roll for the next warrior weapon. You did this. ^/s

I'm currently at work and will be downloading this when I'm home, so I'm not sure if this feature exists, but would it be possible to have an option to automatically hide the window until you enter a major city?

Most of the stuff I plan to do is in major cities such as level up skills, sell ah stuff, smelt stuff, etc.

Great work and I hope I can get into addon making too!

Very much this. Play it safe and your own rep will stand out against all the hate.

Tauren doing the crip walk in SW.
---
That seems a little drastic....
---
TBF I only really end up stealing mining nodes from gnomes, and mages.
---
Ya fucking mages don't deserve my ore! (Got enough shit to keep my hunter stuck in place with as it is)
---
And I typically miss gnomes because they're, uh, tiny.
---
no please, it's already getting more crowded
---
if they enjoy that it's because they enjoy their epeen and ego stroked
---
How bad is the southern part of stv? I tried to quest in the northern lower lvl part. And there was so many players. Does it get better?
---
This tingle my berryhole, get rekt you sneaky little rogue
---
Boo hoo, someone is having fun, we can't have that. Go play on a pve server, crybaby.
---
Yeah, 151 fishing here with a +75 boost and gaining levels but not actually catching anything in Feralas.
---
I've been playing on a private TBC server before classic. Other than the flying, it really was the game at its best in my opinion. I chose a shaman for classic in part because I miss playing TBC survival hunter and being able to increase the damage of my party while pulling and doing crazy CC stuff and being a support DPSer. When WotLK came out and they implemented their whole Bring the Mage not the Shaman design philosophy it kinda took the wind out of the sails for me, and I quit shortly after Cataclysm failed to male things better.
---
This...is...so...fucking...coool!!!
---
This is very incorrect... The vas majority of boxers just play like this because we find it fun. Focus and exact reasoning differs from person to person, but I feel confident in saying that more than anything a question of convenience. It's just great to get to log in and play when it works for you. You're never waiting on guildies or friends to come online to do stuff, you don't que for dungeons if you are the full group, there is no drama or loot disputes since it's just you, you don't inconvenience others if you have to suddenly go AFK, and so on and so on.... I'm sure you can see the appeal.  Additionally playing and working on a team instead of one character just adds so much depth to the game. 
---
Healing and tanking simultaneously is not a problem at all either. People have even had moderate success in running current 10-man raids alone.
---
If you're a warrior, then yes, continuously running back to your corpse slows down leveling quite a bit :D
---
cornering a market isn't as easy in classic when there are significantly more competitors within your server than in expansionwow. while the person in this screenshot is going about this the wrong way, they do have a valid point of revealing gross undercutting. it's economically better for everyone to undercut by 1c. like on my server where people undercut by percentages, it's aggravatingly difficult to establish a market history.
---
It hasn't ruined my life yet. But I'm sure learning how little sleep I can live on
---
Thanks man!
---
I got a Bloodspiller from SM. Looks suboptimal but you think it's worth anything?
---
Thank you for answer! I guess I will switch tailoring for skinning and with lvl 60 switch back to tailoring. :-)
---
Mods removed my thread, in which I just asked if there were server-specific discord and subreddits. Supposedly low effort. And then instead of reopening it when i appealed, they just gave me an answer instead of letting everybody know.
---
So that was you who killed my shammy yesterday!
---
Epic mount 100%
---
Im aware that you can move them using basic interface, but the problem is that the combat log won't move further down to the corner of the screen. That's why I've been using addons to try and fix it.
---
So you almost lost to a same level rogue who did not get to open from stealth.
---
/clap
---
Killing Greys is very typical for Alliance scum D:
---
i'm sorry
---
Tell me about it. Was making a killing off Frost Oil at about 1g70s a pop and now people have undercut it so much that it's down to 50s. Luckily I got a decent amount of it for mount before that.
---
Amazing.
---
That‚Äôs not entirely true. Right now I can travel from a cataclysmic Eastern Kingdoms still ravaged by Deathwing to a Northrend where the Lich King still rules, seeing Dalaran in the sky before hearthing back to... Dalaran. But in a different place now. 
---
Blizzard doesn‚Äôt care about the timeline lol. They‚Äôll let you do whatever.
---
isnt enraged stanley is 1.3 attack speed? thats according to petopia
---
Blizz attempting to implement ddos protection of some sort is messing with things? I don't know. I play wow.
---
A lot of people join PVP servers expecting even epic battles between factions and insane duels ...  
---
In reality its always overlevelled and outnumbered other factions just oneshotting you when you have no chance.
---
vanilla is awesome and all but i wouldnt quit my job for this version of it..
---
Level 60 7 days 8 hours played. Dinged level 60 by handing in quest to Bolvar in stormwind after rp walking all the way from the flightpath with "live to win" playing in the background
---
Not everyone cares about PvP.  Most people have no specific aspirations for gaining a specific rank in PvP, and a lot of them don‚Äôt have any interest in PvP whatsoever.  For a majority of players, PvP is not the focus of WoW (when compared to PvE).  Given this, you can perhaps see why other people don‚Äôt see ‚Äúwell you can just form a PvP group with your friends and spend most of your time in the game PvPing!‚Äù as a great option.  It‚Äôs literally not something they want to do; the act of engaging in PvP is not what they play WoW for, its not their goal and they‚Äôd prefer to do something else.
---
Honestly, judging from your responses, it seems difficult for you to empathize with others to the point that it‚Äôs probably a serious psychological issue for you.  I‚Äôd urge you to reflect on whether or not you think what I‚Äôm saying may be true, and act accordingly - it‚Äôs totally possible that I‚Äôm entirely wrong, but also possible that you‚Äôd benefit from some self-reflection or counseling.
---
&gt;turn off growllllllllll
---
Why would it be cheating? All you're doing is moving items from one character to another.
---
If it's red, it's dead. Easy as that.
---
&gt;Any PvP in phase one is basically just internet bullying.
---
I see it as practice for phase 2
---
Literally the equivalent of the Heart of Azeroth could be that. I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that shit
---
Because you are on the virgin pvp server... everyone knows normal (pve) servers are the chad thunderfurycock servers..
---
Not cheating at all, and cheaper than buying from the AH
---
I've just dinged 40 as a priest. I've been split between mostly disc and holy so far, but everyone goes for Shadow at 40. I don't really like the idea of it so much, as I think holy fire and smite are good for combat, especially with holy talents to improve them. 
---
I also love to run dungeons, so don't wanna lose the benefits that disc and holy provide for dungeons.
---
What do you guys think? Is changing to Shadow spec always worth it?
---
Saw it for 550 on AH, you can probably bargain a bit lower idk. The supply and demand are super low atm so it can be any price really.
---
As holy you're better off farming dungeons than trying to solo. Holy can do pretty good dmg but uses up way too much mana so it would be a struggle. Undead strat is pretty good money if you clear the ziggurats and there are a couple really good drops there (amulet and body) so you might want to farm that.
---
Thanks, was helpfull :)
---
Rouge tried to backstab me (Priest) while i was fighting mobs, he was even 2 lvl above me. I shield myself, gave him a DPT and finish the mob first.. then kill the Rouge who was sure he won already an /spit on me. 
---
Best feel ever, what a pathetic loser :D
---
I am currently leveling a gnome warlock and am planning to do mining/engineering as main profession purely for RP reasons. But since I also want to do stuff OOC, I'm wondering how much use I will have of engineering as a warlock? Like, is it more useful to pick up tailoring? Most guides I have been reading still have me in doubt.
---
Level 21 human warriors can't get one you have to be a level 22 literally anything else
---
Very helpful thanks, I havn't speed nature's grasp yet will be my next talent point.
---
Their customer service group is the biggest expense.
---
There's more. Every single cleave ability wrongly cleaves behind targets, and I mean every single one. Doesn't matter if it is lbrs, mc, or some other random overworld mob - enemy cleave hits in a 360¬∞ "cone" aka circle.
---
And I fondly remember that not being the case, all guides saying to turn enemies around etc.
---
Funnily enough, fire breaths seem to work.
---
As a Stalagg Alliance player, fuck *both* of you.
---
I have yet to die legitimately to grinding mobs. I've been killed in front of dungeons at least 50 times.
---
Nah this isn't cheating at all, you're good.
---
Lol getting ganked? Try 'layer inv pls' before layerings gone
---
Yes, yes, let the hate flow though you.
---
Maybe.
---
We are both not completely innocent I guess.
---
Was fun though.
---
We don't ask them because we assume a miner has blacksmithing/engineering and a herbalist has alchemy and vice versa. Hence those who need it have the required gathering profession and those who have the gathering profession need it. It's not a guarantee but it's common enough to refrain from second guessing it. 
---
Meanwhile a locked chest has no content which are put to use exclusively by rogues. Hence it is purely for economic gain. And at that point, I'll argue that if you have no reason why you need the loot more than someone else in the group, everyone gets a chance. 
---
I've kicked&amp;ignored mages for refusing to give the healer water for free (getting max level conjure food/drink is arguably more difficult and expensive than maxing picklocking) , I've kicked&amp;ignored warlocks who demanded payments for summons or healthstones (soulshards do 't farm themselves), etc. 
---
Just like demanding the content of a chest, they're causing unnecessary tension in a group just to benefit themself.  And as a dps, they're dispensible to the point where I'd rather wait an extra minute to find someone who is more pleasant to deal with.
---
I had 110g at lvl 39 on my rogue. Now i have 91g at lvl 33 on my mage.
---
Doing the AH thing.
---
Alright thank you for your message! So tailoring isn't as lucrative as Alchemy with lvl 60? 
---
I'm thinking about switching to Skinning to get enough money, then switching to Tailoring back to get the epic chest.
---
I‚Äôm EU so no streamers and it‚Äôs 110g.
---
Streamer man bad Streamer man bad Streamer man bad Streamer man bad Streamer man bad btw
---
What were the levels?? Im guessing they are a terrible hunter if they had to run from a warrior fight? Or were they taking on higher levels?
---
That's an incredibly skewed opinion of what PvP servers are like. Sure, you might level slightly faster on a PvE server, but I like getting into fights during the journey. You're welcome to enjoy whatever you like, but don't shit on other peoples' idea of fun too.
---
Stop attacking lowbies you god damn pussy.
---
One of the best things about not having started classic again is that I don't have to deal with palas and druids thinking they can tank or DPS in raids. God that was annoying.
---
My friend you get an upvote, that‚Äôs how everyone should play on a pvp server !
---
Here‚Äôs one from me on melee weaving.

Thank you for moving. You made my queue easier.

My guild of 10 years is here. I literally cannot transfer off.
---
evil
---
This should be the only answer.
---
Lmao Ninja quit wow because of this. I'd say he's just salty his viewership is dying.
---
Oh GOD!!!!
---
THE NAGA HAVE INFILTRATED THE ALLIANCE!!!!!
---
We made a poll in my guild. I am the guild master, but I can‚Äôt go against everyone. 
---
I played PvP server in Vanilla as well, but I don‚Äôt remember such a huge faction imbalance. Maybe my memory gets blurry with age :)
---
Name and character model supports it but I wouldn't state it as a matter of fact without seeing confirmation from a blizzboi
---
I never understand people too slow to understand that it won't sell faster just cause it's 50%, 60% of the price. It's not a damn supermarket, there's no sales. It's still going to sell as fast as it would if it's the lower priced item, unless the price doesn't make any sense.
---
Is it? I thought I saw somewhere that in some extreme cases of griefing blizzard would actually step in and intervene. Because at the end of the day they want people to actually play their game, and if you‚Äôre being griefed so bad you can‚Äôt do anything and you decide to quit and unsub, that hurts Blizzard, not that player doing the griefing.
---
I just did the quest and didn't skill up fishing before leaving, hasn't caused any issues
---
What page did I link? I haven't linked anything.
---
Female night legs though
---
Wow thats rly expensive. Not the kind of money I'd wanna spend because I also wanna save for the epic mount. Maybe I should roll a hunt/lock alt or ask a hunt/lock friend to help me.
---
I felt that
---
Hey, shaman here. One question: it seems the flametongue weapon is still under an older patch, meaning it doesnt buff spell damage? Am I right? Is rockbiter therefore better in terms of dps?
---
I've noticed this also working on my 10% free cast as well.  I'll get that to proc, cast a chain lightning and follow with a shock and both will be free.
---
I saw this in scholomance but thought it was just that single ability not the entire game.. what the fuck is wrong with this game
---
Default
---
Please keep posting these, I wont watch them, but its hilarious to see how mad the crybabies get
---
more like 2.1 recipes
---
Guys we found the attention whore who thinks hes a god because he can spam aoe roots/slows and teleport 20ft away every 15 seconds like no other class can! Imagine posting videos of 1v1s as a frost mage and being so proud of winning lol...
---
So we're now ignoring everything else I posted? nice
---
As Alliance myself; this is just you working smart, not hard. Nice bait with making it look like you are just helping out.
---
Flight paths can suck a dick. I can't wait for a QOL update to fix the fucking FP speeds
---
I freaking hate it and everytime it rains I just change particle level to minimum so it's barily raining. It really ruins the beautiful world they've created.
---
Oh god! Oh man!
---
Until lvl 55, yes.
---
Agreed entirely.
---
Its this whining that made blizzard shove everyone into instances in the first place that ruined WOW the first time round.
---
Nah I wasn't there yesterday. But you can often find myself there noobstomping for an hour or two on the weekends. Maybe tonight?
---
Ok, I understand that.
---
Part of the things that I don't like about the PVE is that when I tame Humar the Pridelord as a nelf hunter is not going to be challenging ... however I feel very happy traveling to places safely while I can only play a couple of hours a day.
---
i see a lot people recording gameplay but isn‚Äôt there too much of videos at the end ? where do you find room for that ?
---
Switch layer, it's all you can do. There are also spots in Gadg, Booty Bay and LHC. If you slowfall from above TM you can land on the roof and also cause havoc but that's probably different as it's not a pathing exploit.
---
Im on a pvp server. No point fighing enemies 6+ lvls above my while im just questing and passing them by.
---
However, if we're only 2-3 levels apart and we're hunting the same mobs? It is 100% on, these mobs are either mine or theirs, i might lose and it will suck, but we're not sharing the mobs peacefully thats for sure.
---
that actually sound awesome!!!!
---
By playing any spec of shaman.
---
Pre q starts in feralas. Just look it up on wowhead
---
Its not like anything would happen in the near future anyhow... The need to get through the first phases first.
---
It‚Äôs the only class getting a invite anyway. Rest of the classes will get invited for their buff. So 1 of each class and 20 mages will be a basic raid setup.
---
Gandling server here.
---
He needed the mob for a quest, so at least he had incentive.
---
I went to the Dustwallow Marsh turtles the other day trying to farm up some scales, Human Warrior with a few levels on me was further up the beach fishing. Cool. Well I think I killed one or two no problem, then see him pop an invis potion....here we fuckin go \*eyeroll\* Second later he's charged me, I pop Nature's Grasp and cheese it into the ocean. He gives chase but obviously that's not going to work, so he swims back and somehow thinks he is going to be able to resume fishing unimpeded, lol! Every time he cast his rod I Moonfired him from the water. He tried to chase me away, but couldn't get close enough to charge. I went back to the beach and saw him going all out min-max on his self-created problem, brewing up some FAPs, armor pots, and other assorted elixirs. He still couldn't kill me.
---
I actually saw him again just the other day, this time at the Tanaris turtles. He was still trying to fish, but I was now only one level lower so he wisely left me be.
---
Just thought I could chime in here for some people that are struggling to find a class that they want to play.
---
It is totally fine to play multiple characters - especially if you're playing pretty casual. 
---
Currently, I have three toons all below 30, but all above 15. 
---
This gives you the ability to jump around and play something different if you don't feel like playing the class you played the day before. Have each character have different professions and use them together (granted they're all on the same server) to make a 'self-sufficient' *account*. 
---
So far this has been really satisfying for me and hopefully this helps some people that think they have to pick a class and stick with it. 
---
Good luck!
---
I tried and failed at this exact same thing, wondering what I was doing wrong.
---
Dem boys mirroring one another's wurds
---
This here is the truth.
---
Very good tips! I will consider it to not spend money on usless skills :)
---
Why do you think it isn't worth switching to skinning? I mean the first 100 skill points weren't much expensive. Do you think I shouldn't switch to skinning because it would be time consuming to farm it to 100+?
---
can i get in on that sweet guide? :) Thank you!
---
Best part of being a rogue is to stealth next to a mining node  waiting, and start hammering  it when someone gets close just to  see them stop.  Look at you. Run away.
---
This usually happens when I‚Äôm running in roads and neither of us are fighting anyone, I guess the guys just may be on autorun..
---
I'm a lvl 38 Enh Shaman right now, i cant wait to reroll elemental once i hit 40! This looks like so much fun.
---
Na this is usually what people do when they roll an alt anyways it‚Äôs one of the perks of having a higher level character
---
MANY WHELPS, NOW, HANDLE IT
---
as a level 33 warrior I am having the same problem. Every zone i go to is contested, and since i'm on a horde dominated server, there is always 2 or 3 horde if there is 1.
---
This means no matter where i go, if i venture away from safe zones, I will get ganked and killed by 2+ horde.
---
I've gone to every zone at my level bracket and it's the same story, Thousand needles, desolace, STV, South shore, Arathi - All of them I can't get a single quest done on. I spent more time running around the world collecting Flight points rather than actually questing in my personal quest to find a zone that i wouldn't get killed constantly on. Not a single one was alliance dominated, they were all heavily Horde.
---
My theory is most alliance are hiding in instances due to having the same problem, which just further tilts the balance.
---
I have taken to just farming green mobs that are adjacent to cities rather than trying to actually quest. The XP per hour is much faster than killing one mob, being killed, running back to your body, killing two more, ganked again, repeat.
---
Yeah, I divorced my wife.  I mean, we were getting divorced eventually because I‚Äôm an asshole, but I forced it to happen immediately!
---
So? You don't kill a mob in one hit.
---
Then you could assume that in that chest is probably cloth and the rogue is tailor or leather and he is leatherworker. You could roll for the boe's that he gets if any. You get the point.  Let's agree to not agree on that topic. Cuz you are arguing about pennies. 
---
I understand kicking mages and locks for these reasons, because it makes your group go faster. Lockpicking has nothing to do with it. When you are making group, i highly doubt you are looking for that one rogue cuz he can open chests. You just take what's there and you go. It saves time. What I really do not understand is that you would rather pick another dps, just because rogue won't open chest for you. So in the end no one ll have it. What a greedy attitude. I can't have it, then no one will! 
---
There is only one hope, that you are a horde, so i don't have to deal with you later. I am out of this shit.
---
Did you mean to use caps lock? Is your button sticky?
---
You have alliance seeping from your commentary.
---
Nope, they were in vanilla.
---
I agree that in this meme the filthy gnome is overreacting, but it is okay to be pissed when you are being ganked. Just because you are on pvp server doesn't mean that you should bend over and just accept your fate with a smile on your face, especially if you are being corpse ganked. Someone can be a dick even if it's allowed by the game rules, be it ninja looting, tagging all mobs in an area (looking at you, mages), ganking someone who is just fishing peacefully and so on..
---
Dat wand doe
---
I usually just mention my level when I whisper them. Saves them a shift click and if I'm leader and a few people whisper me at once I will always invite the one that included their level in the whisper
---
Trying to do anything as Horde in Hillsbrad.  My god.  Even fishing on the river at its closest point to the town is dangerous.
---
Gave up on Yetis.  Almost gave up on battle of Hillsbrad quests since I had to run by the yeti cave.
---
It‚Äôs against the subs rules and reddit has too much outrage porn to begin with.
---
Why would you want emojis on chat, im shocked!
---
Depends on your goals for the game.  When you say you don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd have time for end game I totally understand you. Raiding is a commitment and it takes time. I would say play both as long as you enjoy it and don‚Äôt chase endgame progress. Either way wow classic isn‚Äôt going anywhere and new expansions are not part of the plan. So you will have more than enough time to explore all of the game if you wanted to. Cheers!
---
I fid Desolace and Shimmering flats before STV. Then I came back at 35 and did the whole Big Game Hunters chain with my giild friends.  Took 3 hours,  but it was quite fun +  the rawards are quite nice, for that level.

"I don't dislike anyone based on their sexual desires"  
---
...
---
"The mere existence of gay people in a public space is unacceptable and upsets me"
---
you gotta pick one bub
---
Me. I even played Battle of Azeroth when it came out for about two weeks, and I have literally zero interest in playing this. It's not the WoW I fell in love with anymore, but Classic *is*.
---
World last
---
Early.
---
Then you stand your ground and let the low level one need help and hopefully feel somewhat embarrassed
---
Adding Crusader Strike to their rotation in TBC changed their rotation significantly. Much better at PvP in TBC. In Classic all they basically do is autoattack and hope for a Seal of Command proc.
---
It‚Äôs boring to always play the same and in classic you can easily pick up any class and be good with it
---
This is even worse than early 2000s chain emails my mom used to send.
---
Boomers on the internet were a mistake.
---
Probably... maybe... morally gray. 
---
Why Horde is full of excuses, when they do evil deeds, then upload video of that, and are bragging about it on Reddit forums?
---
If you are going around questing and he catches you, you'll probably going to just die. 
---
If you are expecting it or just traveling around the world then you always want to keep shield, renew and inner fire refreshed. If they don't severely outgear you then that should keep you alive through the stun. Like the others are saying, fear as soon as you can. As he runs away, run the opposite direction and don't stop. He will use Will of the Forsaken to break the fear and come after you. As you are kitting him, use your instant cast heals and get Pain on him.
---
One thing that is fun to try, as soon as you get that first scream off, start casting mind control. If there is nothing to jump him off of or mobs to aggro him into, then at the very least run him away from you.
---
Yeah Ashbringer and the Doomhammer were cool but most of the rest were made up and a bit meh
---
But its not how it is now. Players are substantionally better and dungeons are easy, the majority of them do not even require a tank. Its not going to change.
---
Says no one ever..
---
Warriors can tank dungeons as soon as they get their defensive stance. Dont put points into prot until youre 58+ and youre respeccing to a full tanking build
---
Cheers folks,
---
I am back into Classic, all feels really nice and dandy. But the basic UI is kinda meh, I am looking for something simplistic (similar in visual design to the standard UI is ok, but not a must) with a lot of custumization options. Any suggestions?
---
Really appreciating any help.
---
Makes sense, that's mostly just the market adjusting
---
I stopped grouping with hunters in wc and have never regretted it
---
Stalagg, which I don‚Äôt highly recommend lol
---
You know that bit dont know the min lvl for a dungeon. 
---
:confusedface:
---
It‚Äôs crazy how much muscle memory comes with Classic. I haven‚Äôt played since BC but as soon as I made my character I was running and hit Z to get my weapon out. Found myself shift clicking most names to remind myself of dungeon levels, all the time.
---
Nope, 1.11. I remember how pumped I was in vanilla because I was into collecting them - scholo, shadow forge, etc.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=294460/keyring-coming-to-wow-classic-in-first-patch-after-launch
---
Blizzard could do plenty of things to balance out faction balance and they haven‚Äôt tried 80-90% of them.  It‚Äôs absolutely, to some degree, their fault.  
---
When there‚Äôs nearly zero incentive to play on the outnumbered side, and when playing on the outnumbered side is consistently less enjoyable than playing on the majority side, yeah, the faction balance is inevitably going to get progressively worse.  Particularly when paid server transfers are a thing.
---
I remember that long ass flight. Perfect time for a bathroom/food/drink break.
---
It actually fell under harrassment and was banable back then.
---
"TURN OFF ASPECT YOU MONG" 
---
     -Everyone ever
---
yes thank you
---
Nope.  That's also why I do a lot of short auctions around prime time now, and only 8 hours when I'm going to bed, or it's something that's not expensive.  Someone will just undercut it on long anyway.
---
It is a bug yes. But i doubt they will fix it since its not a bug unique to classic wow. Imo its hilarious that people can do stuff like that,and i would do it too if i would be a caster
---
I started playing wow after legion dropped. I was pissed when I logged in one day to find mobs scaling to my level. I logged out and haven't touched retail since. Thank you classic.
---
So.. what you‚Äôre saying is you don‚Äôt really want vanilla, you want what bastardized version of the game private servers cobbled together. 
---
Okay.
---
Bye bye.
---
I don't really gank lowbies but the comments in here makes it tempting.
---
Okay
---
Sounds about right
---
Who pulled the surger with the core hound?
---
What do you mean with "having to explain yourself"?
---
I've played druid to level 40 and the worst thing that happened was some dispute over loot. But never did I have to explain how I am going to fill the role I've signed up for.
---
Let's be honest, both are shitty. It's essentially just bullying.
---
Yes jesus kalimdor is such a wasteland. After your 8 biome of flat destert you eyes wander over the sea.
---
The halfway point expwise is 44:-/
---
Yes i'll keep justifying attacking people for my pvp experience
---
Maybe in phase 2 when there's a gain to be made, but killing somebody right now with low mana and a mob aggro'd makes you an asshole not a pvp god.
---
Priest perspective : I make liberal use of the shift and control keys.
---
My 1-5 keys are mind blast, swp, flay, mana burn, fear.
---
Shift 1-5 heal, flash heal, renew, poh
---
Ctrl 1-5 pw:s, dispel, focus, disease
---
The idea is my heals are always a shift button, utility on ctrl and general damage is neither. Then others like mounting wand etc are on ctrl/alt e q r etc.
---
The main thing is finding a comfortable habit for your core skills and fit everything else around them
---
This, so much this.
---
First of all I think you should search for a mature guild with older people, they really do exist.
---
Usually in PUGs you do /roll to get items, which means that sometimes you will get loot and sometimes not. If you join a pug with mostly guild members sometimes you only get to roll on items that they guildies don't need.
---
If you want easier access to raids I would recommend that you start tanking.
---
Paladins are the best aoe tanks in dungeons.
---
Not mean at all. They deserved to perish.
---
He mind controlled the warlock and buffed him with stamina.
---
About the phase 1 part I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt have the honor system yet so there is no ‚Äúpoint‚Äù in killing the members of the opposite faction.
---
But since the warlock is too low the priest would not receive honor anyways.
---
Came back to wow for the vanilla experience.
---
If I where to play with a select few people I might as well pick up retail where there is class balance.
---
Well not yet. But this will be the case in bwl and above
---
Ive had a lot of fun, locking down questing zones for the alliance for hours.
---
Saw a hunter yesterday called Legolasdk. Yesterday was a good day
---
I dont really see the point in ganiing since it doesnt forward my character in any way. I play games to improve my character and my skills and although ganking can improve skills (especially when recieving) I dont feel like its enough. Same can be achieved with BGs since there the targets are prepared and might give a better fight.
---
IT'S NOT EVEN A FUCKING STAT STICK
---
There's enough people now!! My guild did it over a week ago on Zandalar Tribe.
---
No I'm pretty sure layering is the biggest difference.
---
&gt; just to reach the half way point.
---
I don't know if it will make you happy or sad, but while level 30 is the 'halfway point' in the technical sense, it is [Just shy of 25% of your way to 60 on average /played](https://i.redd.it/pisi01niz0z21.png). Still plenty of way to go :D
---
i think by phase 1 he just means the time frame
---
more like going through that one little area with the ravasaurs in ungoro
---
What kind of gear is there for elemental shamans? Just mail with int or do you use cloth gear?
---
Lv44 is the half way point to 60. In all honesty, I wouldn't rush it and play at your own pace. The end game content isn't going anywhere and most people tend to encounter burn out if they hammer the leveling experience.
---
What server are you on and what faction?
---
Roll on a PVE Server.
---
SOmething about this post tells me you come from Fortnite or minecraft.
---
This game is brutal af weak sheep dont make it to max LVL
---
I'm sure most people who've experienced this bug thought they where unlucky, but going from 225-238 without getting a single fish I started to suspect otherwise.
---
Is rockbiter more fun than wf tho? No it isnt so wf all the way
---
There are 2 kinds of people in this world ^
---
ƒérƒ±zzt is the one i remember most of all from vanilla
---
Yes, as you get higher level there will be a few instances where bridging the XP gap is necessary.
---
Its not a badge of honor. Anyone can do that if they try. Im just saying that people are impatient and if everyone dpsed only the tanks target dungeons would take forever.
---
I suggest you play what you feel like playing, and what seems most fun. If that means switching between characters, don‚Äôt feel bad about it. 
---
A benefit from switching characters is that you get the perk of rested bonus xp.
---
I ran past a horde warrior with 10% health, i could of easily killed him, i just walked past him instead with a /wave.
---
He proceeds to heal up to full, then chase me down, and kill me
---
I just don't get some people.
---
I paid for a second subscription so I can have an alt sitting at AH while I play, it lets me update my auctions in real time and I can trade things to it face-to-face to avoid delays. Otherwise yeah it's a lot less useful if you have to wait for every mail.
---
You can farm basilisks in desolace, not much competition, gives like 6g/hour doing it chill watching second monitor(that's what I did at level 37 thru 40)
---
Only a good idea if OP has caster gear. With str agi gear he wont be faster
---
Not at all. I mean you're alliance, it's very common for your folk to only attack lowbies or coming only for 3v1s.
---
Spam multishoot / go big Dick aim shoot, fd top meters, show everyone your a Hunter!
---
Good job. You taught him a life lesson, dont be a fuck to other people.
---
As a chronic ganking addict on a server that is 65% horde, my goal is to make as many hordoes quit as possible
---
HAH! Glad to hear
---
If you have the ability you can teach it 
---
At the trainer you need to buy all previous ranks I believe
---
Same for people who spam their LFG/LFM 5 times in a row. Yea, I notice the post, but it doesn't make me want to join. Exactly the opposite.
---
Lmao not at all.
---
So many priests somehow get a bigger penis when they ding 60? Huh, maybe it should be advertised as a penis enlargement treatment!
---
Horde or Alliance i always enjoy watching a rogue die , wp!
---
&gt; Saw a hunter yesterday called Legolasdk.
---
Woah, that's a blast from the past.
---
Ty but that's not what I'm looking for.

Your raid bis a gnomeregan weapon so idk how much luck you‚Äôll have with cool Druid weapons
---
Honestly I miss MoP trinkets. Assurance of Consequence was my wet dream.
---
Mana was a scarcer resource than GCD in this fight, so no.
---
Would you consider 1 gold as apology for wasting long minutes of your time?
---
Some days ago I complained about a mage that ganked me while I was in a AoE pull, yesterday I found him and I corspecamped him for a while, sometimes he managed to escape but eventually I had my revenge
---
You can find someone‚Äôs actions or personality annoying without attack their self being
---
For example, you can find a white man on the train whistling loudly and think how annoying he is. It doesn‚Äôt mean you hate white males. 
---
Attention whores are incredibly annoying. 
---
Girl gamers are annoying because every sentence is ‚Äúteehee I‚Äôm a girl!‚Äù
---
Potheads are annoying because all they can talk about is weed. I don‚Äôt hate any of these people based on things they were born with. 
---
I don‚Äôt give a fuck who you want to fuck ; your desperate attention seeking is fucking annoying and not everything is about your sexuality.
---
The only human Ranger *Lord,* thank you very much.  All the other Ranger Lords bitched and moaned about the human, but Ranger-General Sylvanas declined to remove him.
---
The most important thing is to give a shit about people behaving like this.
---
Find your self some pals or a guild. What you are experiencing is just the visible filth of a minority. 
---
Enjoy your game and as a maximum, maybe read a guide. 
---
The rest is up to soci al competence. Ignore the people that make you feel bad. 
---
Thats it.
---
Single target mage here. Can‚Äôt find ZF group or Ulda.
---
I have very limited time outside of work as well and trust me, I tried that. Getting a group together and replacing people every half an hour is just as bad and time consuming as corpse running is. I just can't play like this.
---
Seen plenty of legolas no aryas and one khaleesi. so i dont think so

Fashion sense of a high school shooter

As well as your ping then XD

doesn't druids have a teleport spell to moonglade ?

Whats the addon that puts the bar on top of your screen with all the info? I used to have it but can't remember what it's called.

How would I set it up?
---
Crack is that what you smoke? you smoke crack.
---
gz well layerd
---
War profiteer or traitor? The angry mob shall decide!
---
Yeah, the tank should get some kind of minimal threat on the mobs, even if its just one swipe. If I Fade as a priest and STILL have some mobs on me, something is wrong.
---
I prefer STV quests
---
I have this mentality, but the turtle shell quest in simmering flats finally broke me. That quest is impossible to finish, it's essentially a test to see how long it will take you to abandon it and go to bed.
---
Why are straight people so obsessed with sex when it comes to queerness? Calm down
---
No ones paying retail. Go look on twitch lmao.
---
Shadow is undoubtably the strongest leveling spec.
---
That being said, if you enjoy holy/disc more, don't let anyone stop you. I've seen balance druids in the 50'ies, too (which I'd argue is well ahead of the curve), so it's absolutely doable to level well with a non-optimal spec.
---
Plus, if you enjoy healing and doing dungeons a lot, holy/disc is obviously much better at that than shadow.
---
 I (lvl 46) was in hinterlandand questing when  two lvl skull , a mage and rogue jumped on me and killed me . I was like well shit happen...come backs and revive and 5 min later again those two kill me .
---
There was no way for me to fight 2 lvl skull and its a Horde dominated server so there was no one to help me . What i did? well there was no way to beat them so i was like yeah your faction gonna pay the price .
---
Jumped on flight path to  Southshore and started camping low lvls at yeti cave for a nice 30 min. I didn't want to kill lowbies...you MADE me do that .
---
The mage doesn't even have Ice Barrier yet. You're just a World of Roguecraft roxxor who can't slay.

I'm playing troll mage, and this is my current frost build: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/--0532122](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/--0532122)
---
I don't think I can really do any AoE grinding until about level 30 so I'm interested in what sort of single target levelling / dungeon builds I should be looking at for the moment.
---
Also, in dungeons I feel like I am running out of mana during the trash phase more than my fellow mages, can anyone give me some tips? I have been stacking int, stam and spirit, but my spirit has gone down a bit recently with more int gear available.
---
Mousover macros are just better.
---
Also, VuhDu is a superior raid frames mod.
---
Titan Panel
---
The point is to have fun and some people enjoy PvP without grinding for loot
---
Is there an addon that shows incoming heals? Currently using shadowed unit frames and haven't found a option for this yet.
---
R.A. Salvatore just released his newest Drizzt book on September 10th btw.
---
I've had the luck of having 3 weeks off for classic launch so yeah that might've been a plus. Also, what pop server are you on?
---
Yah? Try Un'goro Crater! Rip

Oh that is what is happening. Spent all morning trying to figure out what I was doing wrong ....

When I mind control things my action bar doesn't change. I'm using bartender4 and have bar1 set as the mc bar. Is this bugged or is my setup wrong?

He's adorable!

Kind of strange thinking about him, before or at screenshot versio, I was like, aaah! He looks so cool and with his dual axes, hyena pets etc!
---
Updated Nathanos and given voice in Legion/BFA etc, just.. can you shut up and die?
---
I am using VanasKoS addon to remember everyone who attacked me and it alarms me if I encounter anyone on the list. Usually I allow Horde players to mind their own business, but I have one strike rule. If you attack and not by accident - you're on the list and I will come for you.
---
\[Pumped Up Kicks intensifies\]
---
WTF is ASoIaf?
---
The only time someone has mentioned dps was when I, a hunter, somehow found another hunter in a dungeon and he was comparing out pet's dps.
---
The party had like a running 10s bet on which pet would win each fight. It was actually super charming and amusing
---
Good choice my friend. May the elemental gods be with you.
---
Is dragonfangs pop really that low? People say Earthshaker is "dead" but it has about the same pop as a high/full vanilla server. (3000+ online peak hours). IMO playing there feels a lot more like a real vanilla server than the queuefest megaservers.
---
I paused :P
---
If you listen to reddit, rogues have infinite energy, they can sap 3 ppl at once while in combat, they can vanish and cheap-shot every 5 seconds and all their stuns/cc ignore all diminishing returns. They can also aoe/tank 10 mobs at the same time and remove all dots on themselves every 3 seconds. Oh and their stealth never fails and they are only going out of stealth when they feel like it.
---
It's way nastier with gear. Run with nature's swiftness instead and watch people instantly drop at 60 as well
---
Honestly this is the most relevant dialogue the past few weeks.
---
Jokes on you, my life is already ruined.
---
No flight path there in Classic.
---
I'm no expert with weakauras but could have a look at it when I get off work. Also I think you can compare items just by holding shift, but it could be some add on that I'm using that let me do it.
---
On a more serious note, and this is the last thing I am going to say to you, you can tell yourself all these reasons queer people and women are "annoying" and you can justify it to yourself as hard as you want, you can convince yourself that it's some objective and rational thing - but, underneath, you are just a bitter and angry person who hates women and queer people, and I guarantee you that everyone around you can tell. Have a good day or night, whatever time it is wherever you may be.
---
I enjoy making the choice between killing or letting live based on people‚Äôs actions.
---
For example I was helping a friend get to the enchanting trainer in Uldaman earlier today and passed by a bunch of Alliance. On the way out a group of 5 or 6 Alliance ganked a priest who was solo. So I cut down all of them I could find. Normally I would never gank lowbies as it‚Äôs not a fair fight, but neither is 1v6, so in my mind they deserved it. Gank or don‚Äôt gank, your actions will often have unforeseen consequences.
---
Many players choose not to gank (especially in phase 1) because it means they are also less likely to die. This choice seems like a much more realistic and engaging world to me than ‚Äúif it‚Äôs red it‚Äôs dead.‚Äù
---
Goodluck my friend
---
Dominoes is a pretty good and basic ui
---
At least be correct if you're being a nerd. Calculating these paths has nothing to do with the travelling salesman problem and is not NP hard.
---
Cool! I'm hyped for them, then
---
Shadow doesn't do anything special until 40, but neither does holy so go whichever way you prefer. You can easily heal dungeons no matter the spec. Holy gives you holy nova which is pretty handy in dungeons to help out on damage, but it costs a lot so you better have mages feed you lots of water. For outdoor pvp, once you have access to Silence it actually makes a very big difference if you have to fight mages or warlocks.
---
Horde gets Demetria and she mind controlls which is kind of fun when AI decides to cast rank 1 spell because there is no higher ones trained... but when it decides to cast max rank - someone gets deleted :D
---
I solod it as an Ele shaman
---
Awesome! I love the idea of keys but bag space is so precious. I'm suffering
---
What's the add-on for the top bar?
---
Get Bartender4 for a super smooth and minimalistic action bar setup and Z-Perl/perl for unit frames :)
---
Just only use corruption and spam bolts/aoe, never fully dot something that's gonna die in 10 seconds as that is just terribly mana inefficient.
---
Swipe, swipe, swipe?
---
Have you tried exploiting layers? You probably just have to exploit layers.
---
I just started using Luna Unit Frames and found it to work very well while also being easily customizable for people like me who dont know the addon game very well.
---
Oh good, that asshat rolled on the same server as me.
---
If you want......
---
What add-on gives all that info?
---
I use spy for similar purposes when not on a murderous several day rampage
---
Very wholesome!
---
Maybe I tool that the wrong way :)
---
Can u show me your talents?
---
Dam those crits! Dem slows why was the mage so op in classic? Was that class the creators love child or something?
---
I didn't know Shamans could tank anything, MAYBE RFC.
---
I will have to look this up, and perhaps level a shaman tank, lol.
---
Well yeah, clickbait belongs on YouTube. Lets keep it that way. I honestly cant stand youtube now, those stupid clickbait formulas, thumbnails of "ASMON REACTS" with a stupid "POG" face in the thumbnail.
---
And before anyone says "your youtube content is suggested by your viewing habits XD" well you only need to watch one video from a good channel like Madseasonshow to get absolute trash from Asmongold recommened for you
---
Stat priority for holy pally? What about + healing stat?
---
When you are at feathermoon in Feralas, and you want to go to gadgetzan but you totally forgot that there was a flight on the east part of feralas at Thalanaar ...
---
It goes ALL AROUND up until Astranaar (true story) and then go back and dive down to gadgetzan.
---
Also, 20 silver, You DO NOT want to do that, believe me.
---
&gt;Why does this get downvoted lol?
---
Because salty rogues, lol :D
---
They were welfare because they were given to everybody, even to your Average Joe, without any need for skill etc. It devalues the meaning. If you cant see why the Corrupted Ashbringer from 4 Horsemen is significantly cooler to wield than the Ashbringer every Paladin got upon getting lvl 98, I dont know what.

No loot wouldn't give a loot window. In vanilla and retail wow alike, no loot = non clickable corpse. Empty loot windows are bugged.
---
Level to 40 and get shadowform

There is a theory that WoW's original release started the snowball effect that led to the 2008 recession.
---
2 days at lvl 30 is good. I would expect you to be ahead of the curve
---
Bartender didn't work for me so I'm using Dominos, basically the same thing. I can't imagine switching back to default UI.
---
If a mage isn't aware you're around before the start, he is toast before he realizes what's happening to him. Warriors on the other hand, if you can't kill them in the first 8 seconds you're done for good. And you likely won't.
---
Chuck it on wallpaper engine
---
Your luck is so filthy, I need a shower now.
---
Amazing, people would rather wait another hour searching for a tank instead of taking one that‚Äôs still learning.
---
Because this is how they rationalize their cowardice.
---
rofl
---
(or only the very important ones) 
---
Buy every skill that‚Äôs going to make you level faster. Being a level 30 in skill with a lvl 40 mount is so bad. Like you said, you made 70 gold in 6 levels... not even trying! It‚Äôs not the end of the world to get your mount at level 41/42. People waste so much time looking for gold and going off their leveling path/ normal questing with is going to get you gold just as fast at that level.
---
True dat. And in the open area, they probably all respawn as turtle, scorpid or bird. so after a while they arent just in other places anymore except the fixed spawning spot.
---
Shame.
---
Our ubrs runs recently 5 warriors all fury 1 druid tank 1 pala tank. Guild runs are the best
---
Never really thought of that, guess I'll be giving Warriors a little extra help!
---
&gt;No idea why they closed the free transfers already.
---
I'm guessing they only allowed people to transfer for a short amount of time to entice people to transfer because they know it's going to go away after a few days. I believe they will open transfers when they want to remove layering.
---
Kill humanoids or something else until you get no loot from one. It won't be clickable, instead of the empty window.
---
How is it relevant to you how he plays the game?
---
‚ÄúYOu dOnT hAvE To AOE fARm iF yOU DoNt WANt to‚Äù

Last night I had enough of only AOE groups going to SM. So i made my own group for a normal run.
---
Then the fucking mage /w everybody in the grp to leave and join him and his buddie for a AOE run instead. Just as I got on the zeppeline.
---
Only the healer had the balls to say sorry to me before leaving.
---
Well thats the main reason Spriests arent viable end game, one mind blast and they generate INSANE threat. Whats the point getting a Spriest when a Mage can pull the same numbers with less threat?
---
This isn't even right. With proper powershifting you can do competitive damage in raids, but the caveat is that you have to farm a lot of Pummelers from Gnomeregan to do is. The challenge is a) to farm Gnomeregan that many times and not go insane and b) to convince your raid party to let you go the first time. If your numbers are competitive, why wouldn't they let you continue?
---
You attacked not only grey player but also **fishing** player?  
---
Dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow.
---
Hopefully it'll get better as people are starting to hit 60.

No longer with us.

oh i see you're a man of culture as well, have my upvote
---
Does RFC count?
---
Most people don't play the kite/line of sight game well enough to do it easily. Saves so much headaches
---
I did 150-200 in booty bay 2 nights ago and didn't notice any empty loot window stuff.
---
Indeed.  In Classic, the leveling experience IS the end game in many respects.
---
&gt; and Nathanos is rumoured to be beheaded by Tyrande.
---
god, seeing him surviving and escaping a fight against super sayen Tyrand AND MALFURION was such bullshit
---
Mik's Scrolling Battle Text can do this, I'd look into that. Probably other options but that's what I've always used.
---
Yeah it's for sure way higher than on private servers.
---
This is fucking amazing
---
In the Classic Beta - This is Classic Live
---
How tf is it an insult, I've been kicked from pugs before with not even a whisper. I didn't cry about it I realised its an mmo and it happens
---
You mean get attacked 3v1 right?
---
Golden pearls were my path to epic mount back in Vanilla.  Pretty lucrative if you can corner the market.
---
Probably someone who doesn't want to waste time with noobs.
---
That doesn't even add up to 100%
---
I'm a mage. I always do shit DPS. Feels bad man.
---
there has not been made any changes to leeway or hamstring kiting mate.
---
Yeah that's a pain but it's easily worked out by making all your spells macros with /cancelform (or if you have fat fingers sometimes, /cancelform [mod:shift] ) attached.
---
Whenever I AoE farm if I see people questing I will invite them.. But I tend to just AoE farm my own quest mobs then move onto another quest
---
E.G - The pirates quest, I would just gather a ton and kill them together to complete the quest faster, I wouldn't stay there and farm past the quest completion for XP. Too much competition for it to be viable when ZF farms are plentiful.
---
I feel like the fairest thing is for everyone to roll and rogue unlocks the chest because it's part of the toolkit they bring to the dungeon group, just like everyone else in the group uses their toolkits to benefit the group.
---
Like imagine if mages refused to make food and drink for the dungeon group just because they're the only ones who can do it. 
---
You're doing dungeons as a group, so everything you do should be to the group's benefit. If  a rogue wants all the locked chest loot for themselves they can run the dungeons by themselves.
---
Just no, how is Transmog good when the appearance of the player in full AQ40 has no relevance to the ability of the player as the appearance can be solo'd at 120
---
Having items that are uniquely acquired i.e completing the content at expected level is a reason to play the content.
---
When you see a player in full R14 PvP gear in 12-months, or see someone in T3 you know that they are a good and/or dedicated player. You know that in a battleground that you should avoid them, or as a healer heal that R14 warrior. 
---
If all cars looked like a Ferrari, then there is nothing special about the way a Ferrari looks.

I did that in badlands with the basilisks. Killed about 30, no brain. Need 10. Fuck it.

Yes but in a bad way since my dog is still sick and needs to go to the pet hospital next week for a diagnosis.
---
So I'm distracted in the worst way possible.
---
WoW Classic has literally been my replacement for Tinder. I wanted a break and WoW Classic has allowed me to do it. I don't think anything else could have. I'd have gotten depressed and then back at the swiping.
---
I am a fire mage , I wonder how can I use it to my best advantage or I need to share half of my talent points between being fire and frost ?
---
Looks like TitanPanel.
---
It's a war, after all.
---
Unless you attack fishing players. No excuse to do that.
---
Let's be real, you can hate pvp all you want but rolling on a pve server is a bitch move.
---
How good are druid tanks for raids?
---
I'm a 54 undead mage. Questie is showing me the Magecraft (52) quest available and I read it's available at 50 yet the NPCs won't give it to me.
---
What am I missing ?
---
That's one hell of a tldr reply
---
wait, you can kite him out of duskwood? TIL
---
exactly.
---
Honestly don't understand people who play on pve servers, they miss out on like a huuuuge aspect of the game.
---
I bet they're all leveling in STV at level 30 all peaceful like, going afk at nessingwary n shit no care in the world.  Completely different game.
---
Dang found the dude censored :|
---
A threat meter and weaponswingtimer is essential. I believe the best way to gain AoE aggro is by spamming Battle Shout as Thunderclap isn't very rage efficient in terms of generating rage. I'd go human because I prefer the aesthetics and for the +5 sword and mace skill, that being said escape artist is a very solid racial. While leveling don't use HS unless youre close to capping rage, despite the tooltip showing the rage cost as 15 you also lose the rage generated by your next auto attack, meaning the rage cost is closer to 25, even more if you crit on your next AA. While leveling just spec arms, you should be perfectly able to tank every dungeon up until BRD/LBRS I believe. I've linked the talents I've been going with below. You want to get Tactical Mastery/Anger Management as well as Sweeping Strikes as soon as possible. When cleaving focus your rage on keeping up Sweeping Strikes and then dumping rage with Whirlwind, don't use cleave until nearing rage cap as with HS. Be careful not to switch to Battle Stance with a lot of rage as you can only retain 25 with Tactical Mastery, in that case dump some with Demoralizing Shout or Cleave, then swap to Battle Stance and reaply Sweeping Strikes. I don't really have any information on 2H tanking but I'm sure someone else will.

My theory is that ally gets pissy they lose all fair 1v1 fights so they go to lower level zones and gank, or only attack when they have numbers. Source, only lost "fair" 1v1s to mages #warriorlife
---
Only? The fuck you mean, that'd be a high pop server back in Vanilla
---
Healbot
---
Peggle, my friend. It's time to download Peggle. 
---
And refill your coffee, get a snack, use the restroom, etc.
---
Is there an addon that can draw some circles for the range of my totems?
---
If not, how would one make an add-on?
---
Too late for you but best to start skinning profession first. Then you can efficiently farm humanoids and beasts. On alliance side a really good spot for are the worgen in duskwood when you reach level35-39 because those are humanoids and skinnable.
---
Most common tips are also to not buy more than your level 1 for thunder claps and some other defensive abilities. between level30 and 40 you should only be buying heroic strike, execute and war cry.
---
With that you easily get 100po before hitting level40. Then once you have your mount, you can reroll the profession to what you like or keep it to make more gold since skinning is really lucrative on the late game.
---
Is the debuff limit 16? Or was it removed? Google (and reddit) has brought me conflicting results on that.
---
I'm literally a linguist. I'm not worked up, but pedantry does frustrate me. It's classism, at the end of the day. You shouldn't correct people's use of language unless they're asking for it, or you're asking for clarification.
---
I know how that is, enemies are melee swinging me in the back while I'm running away when there's 10m between us
---
Legit "Cause i can" attitude right here .
---
For me it is. I was always playing on PvP Servers. Many decent people on both sides. Of course there are some mentally challenged people who want your experience as mediocre and miserable as their own real life, but those are actually pretty rare.
---
There are only so many spots where Alliance and Horde bash each others face until the dawn of time. STV in Nersingwarys camp and southshore maybe. But even Cityraids are fairly ok, as long are not flagged for pvp noone can harm you. When you find someone in the wild it is usually pretty ok unless you are there for the same mobs. Most people who are leveling just want to quest in peace. On max level PvP servers are much more fun imho.
---
I believe Blacksmithing has some perks for Warrior in PvP
---
Hahaha.  That's good 
---
I, too, tried speaking to NPCs.. but because in most older games I played you had to say a specific phrase to trigger a quest or physically trade the NPC the items they needed.
---
Just wondering what the relevance of this is? The only point of speed leveling I see is shooting for server first 60 or similar, and I bet that ship sailed long ago already. Just enjoy the journey to 60 and have fun, man!
---
Okay, thank you for your input! I will think about it!
---
Can someone recommend a good simplistic ah addon? Auctionator is way too complex for what I want. I‚Äôd like  a minimum quality of life toolkit
---
Thanks for your suggestions, I'll take them on board!
---
I've always been a tank however in considering re rolling to a warlock or priest as I want to change to horde and my setup is poor atm (using a keyboard and mouse on my bed!) so it's difficult to tank properly and I'm fed up with the responsibility and having to concentrate the most in dungeons (some peoples lack of effort/patience is astonishing).
---
Do you think its the right assumption that most guilds will have their Main tank? I imagine it as being the 'centre of attention' role, first pick for roles, heavy gear dependant ext so imagine most guild leaders/officers choose this role?
---
Any suggestion on where to find a more mature guild? Forums/reddit?
---
If you are a Druid, you always have the option of grinding underwater mobs. Just wear a spirit set.
---
most actual pvp players don't kill greys, because why?  I find that a lot of ex-pve players seem to be super horny to kill greys when they play on pvp servers.
---
Yes?
---
I got my mount as a warrior in lvl 40 after many hard hours of fishing Got around 60-70 gold form it and vendored greens and trash for the rest.

We've had the Robe of the Archmage drop, Robe of the Void and 2x Truefaith drop in 5 runs.. wtf is going on?
---
I have to be honest, I don't think he did anything aggressive. Rogues throw distracts at ppl all the time because its funny.... If he actually wanted to attack you, throwing a distract is the stupidest thing you can do because it only works properly in PVE where it actually effects mobs for a few seconds. Throwing it in PVP only serves to expose the player. 
---
I played a rogue for a long time and i used to throw diatracts just for fun to see the funny animation.
---
&gt; And it isnt just "my friends want to roll pvp", either.
---
I'm kinda one of those cases. I probably would've played PvE if my friends didn't want to play on a PvP server. However, most of the time people just ignore each other, because it is so goddamn full in every region that if you started a fight and people joined nobody would get anything done ever again. So it's alright. I think when everyone is max level it might be fun to fight for resources or something.
---
You're taking a lot of talents that are useless for leveling, or that buff spells that you shouldn't be using. Spiritual focus for example is a waste. So is improve seal of the crusader.
---
If you want stronger healing while retaining decent solo capabilities I'd recommend something like this.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0ubMZxhZxbxtbf
---
Solo in a ret set with a 2h, judging max rank command and auto attacking to kill with rank 1 command. By using rank 1 you can conserve mana for self healing. Collect an int-based healing set (it's ok to wear cloth/leather/mail pieces!!) for doing dungeons. Precision/deflection/conviction/divine strength are valuable for increasing solo dps. Keep in mind that even deep ret is fine to heal dungeons while leveling.
---
I would discourage you from going deeper into prot than precision. Reckoning is very gimmicky for a 5pt. investment and there is a lot of chaff to get through to have it.
---
I get a visual countdown over enemy portait. Pretty sure its omnicc, but i might be wrong. On mobile, so cant currently check.
---
We ganked duskwood for 4 5 hours on Dreadmist
---
Same! How do you feel the faction balance is in Razorgore?
---
Darkshore was my favorite questing area.
---
Ok
---
There not all complete soooo this is not good
---
Fuck Hunters
---
I‚Äôve seen some questing addons not be on-par with prereqs and drop%, this same thing you show here has happened to me a few times before
---
It's not really that bad tbh, I'm on faerlina and last night I might've only had 10 or so fights in a 6 hour period. Plus everyone I've ran into so far will have one fight and go about their business
---
Yeah not really though, most people don't kill greys for no reason on pvp servers.
---
Only you can prevent forest fires
---
I think that was added in TBC or Wrath, it definitely wasn't in Vanilla
---
Well at least I was straight forward and did tell them I spent months farming in Vanilla and never got one.
---
Also they're a warlock so I don't feel super awful.
---
The conversation in guild chat was about the pets, since someone had gotten an oozling. I jokingly offered 10g in chat for the Hyacinth Macaw, and it just so happens one of my guildies tossed it in their bank.
---
Guess no one really knew what we had.
---
You thought wrong :) dire maul is the one which is not released yet
---
How do you get on top of that thing though?
---
John cena found his way into the game
---
Personally I'm trying to have some solid pace to get 60 before my friend group just for the flex, but I can see cases where you're trying to catch up to your friend group or maybe you just really want to start raiding/doing high level PvP?
---
If you wanna be valuable at 60, I actually recommend your druid. They're less popular than priests, but as a restoration druid you'll be providing invaluable battle rez and off heals. And if you choose to play Moonkin, which is very rare, all the mages will love your aura for +5% spell damage. And since druids are less popular than priests, you'll probably have less competition for getting a spot in a raid.
---
I want tbc then new content cause I love belf the most.
---
I figured that out. I was being hyperbolic. It is amazing (to me) how Blizzard keeps trying to make retail easier by taking away the things that make up a MMO (again, in my opinion).
---
Found the racist.
---
What if there are 3 adds wailing on the healer while he is trying to heal the tank, but the tank dies before the cast is finished because it is being pushed back non-stop?
---
PvP doesn't need rewards to be fun, the PvP is the reward.
---
Now you're just infuriated
---
&gt;"... as it stands now, I'm as far away from retail as possible."
---
My feelings for the last 10 years.
---
I did all quests for every other dungeon except gnomer. Screw that place.
---
The helmet from the final boss is a huge upgrade at that level, otherwise not much reason to spend hours in there.
---
Nah, there's an addon for that.  
---
I want to do some data analysis.
---
The game of Thrones touch was nice.
---
Only way to lose SP now is by flying a strategic cruiser.
---
I had that happen a couple of times. I was running around mining copper near razor hill fighting mobs to get to the precious copper and some lvl 30-60 dudes, who didn't get aggro for being too high level, just came in and scooped it up. Kinda frustrating ngl.
---
I'll walk to my corpse and afk for a bit. Make a sandwich or walk the dog or something. 10-15 minutes. Waste their time and they'll piss off. About the same time as if I rezzed at the GY without the repair bill.

---
it's a profession without taking up the slot, and it's nothing like a hunter pet. i play a hunter. it is part of every attack i do and it is improved through normal gameplay. lock picking is accessorial
---
Yep if you use dots as warlock or deadly poison as rogue in raids you will get yelled at.
---
I always do that, wall of text then 20 edits later I have cut it down to to just the important stuff.
---
Thanks üòä
---
they can't break fear, which is important in a few fights.
---
Other than that, I think they take a little more damage than warriors, but are workable?
---
I swear I‚Äôm only 31 because I spend so much time in Hillsbrad killing people instead of questing.
---
It usually starts with a few kills then it goes an all out faction war with corpses everywhere
---
Ha, I can honestly say I‚Äôve never done this!
---
yeah you can make more money from GFPPs right now.
---
Thanks for the proof, would have been weird to remove something like that.
---
I guess a lot of people like that guild name lol
---
That‚Äôs the sentiment I get from a lot of people, kinda makes me wanna just abandon the quests and focus on other dungeons/quests.
---
Thanks! Didn't even know those were modifiers haha
---
How does a MacBook handle classic. I have a 2012 MacBook Pro that I plan to play on if Im somewhere without my desktop.
---
You are free to play however you want, but you'd benefit more from dropping the "I'm an animal" feeling and adopting an "I'm a Swiss army knive and need to retract the hammer before I can use the bottle opener" feeling instead.
---
Being able to shift out to kill a running enemy with moon fire, heal yourself, cast roots on targets, or shift into other more applicable forms is essential to doing well as a druid.
---
Arrives on a boat in a unstoppable cutscene that is just long enough to be annoying on your 2nd+ play through?
---
ww axe and totems are part of your combat. lock picking is accessorial just like other professions. it's a class profession and a unique perk more like a mage portal that... people pay mages for.
---
You the real MVP
---
Here you see a highly skilled Alliance Warrior display his mastery over a nearly unbeatable hostile opponent
---
If there were an mmo that charged your abilities by skating tony hawk style I think the world would be a better place.
---
This is true, but as a melee class you can‚Äôt kite like this.  The hit box is too big. The only exception I see here might be hamstring kiting as a warrior to reduce incoming damage maybe.
---
You can put him on passive after he hits them so he follows you and potentially not die
---
How would that help? You spent most of those 15 years 1shotting her for transmogs anyways.
---
Addons can't draw anything in the game world. There used to be a way to do this but one addon crossed the line so blizzard removed parts of the API that enabled it.
---
That still doesn‚Äôt solve that we can‚Äôt interact with quests items or npc. So damn frustrating
---
As a WoW and star wars fan, this makes me happy.
---
Good and pretty handy leveling up to 60. Once 60, Warriors will be more preferred but the 1-59 experience as a Druid sure beats the 1-59 experience as a Warrior. Stealth is heaps of fun!
---
A mob a kill a drink. That‚Äôs why you have /w macros to beg mages for water :-/
---
Let‚Äôs magnify it a little since training on things while your 10 levels behind in points isn‚Äôt a problem to some people. X2? Yea just don‚Äôt buy skills once your level 20 so you can save up for cool mount. Slowing down hours of training just to save a few gold...
---
I understand where he‚Äôs coming from but I strongly disagree that‚Äôs all. No harm no foul, I‚Äôm just a try hard so shit like that bugs the fuck outta me lol. Lvl 50 priest and I got 200+ gold and I‚Äôve quested constantly other then water elementals from 37-39. As long as your having fun üê≥
---
By the time you have enough rage for ss and ww all the mobs are either dead or running towards your healer
---
Undead Warrior :D
---
Because for many fights in classic one tank is enough. Which is not the case in retail.
---
Ohhhh OP is skilling up on pickpocket tonight...!
---
I wouldn't say Beserker is nothing for pvp lol but it's certainly not as good as war stomp or stun resist
---
I made a joke about it being 20 mins with the compainion wjo was riding to the same destination... didn't realize it was actually 20 mins.
---
Also extremely useful to spam rend instead of hamstring, but on a target that is immune to bleeds like a ghost or an elemental. Will never ever use your rage.
---
Which ghost server is that
---
Grobbulus

most dropchance seems WAY lower for boe trash drops than on pservers. Example: 1 UBRS run used to give on average 1-2 travelers backpacks but on classic its like may be 1 backpack per 2-3 runs.  The latter is how I remember it from vanilla so I'm happy with that.  Always thought pservers got it way wrong, travelers backpacks selling for like 3-4g on the ah was never a thing in vanilla....
---
Srfatsallot !!! I feel you bro! Most of my rolls are single digits too -\_-

My biggest issue is basically anything that requires a cog wheel click to do, you cant do in druid for haha at least I'm feral so I'm used to everything else
---
Ok Mr. r/nothingeverhappens
---
pallies generally spam flash of light, so you're generally always inside the "5 second rule" and don't benefit from spirit. need some mp5 though. Maybe: +healing, int, mp5?
---
Is there a sheet like this for priests?
---
funny thing is that the undead looks exactly like the actress.
---
&gt;None of what you just commented is related to the OP. OP was talking about fighting *near* ores. Not *on* them.
---
If you are on top of an or you're still near it.
---
And if someone is standing next to a node and fighting something I'm telling you he is trying to mine it. That's obvious. And any moron can figure that out.
---
But if you are still unable to figure that out then let me give you an absolute rule:
---
- if you literally are mining it out from underneath him
---
- he wanted to mine it
---
Once you've mastered that we can then move on to the next absolutely obvious case: standing next to a node fighting something.
---
Once you figured out that perfectly obvious case, then we can move on to advanced skills:
---
- you and someone else are both bee-llining it directly to a node
---
- but he got there sooner
---
- so he gets attacked by the mobs 
---
And finally if you're ready for the 400 level course;
---
- someone was fighting a creature with in 15 yards of a node
---
- you run up and stand on top of the node
---
- wait till he kills the creature
---
- and see if he comes to mine it
---
- if he does; he wanted to mine it
---
This concludes the Master class in how to do the fucking obvious.
---
No bs up..no switch to zerker...another bad warrior inc

Nah, they didn't. It's just misinformation that is constantly spread no matter how many times someone spends thirty seconds to disprove it.

The fact that you actually need all this shit to beat a mage is kinda pissing me off.
---
Sir, you're 364 days, 23 hours and 37 minutes away of your reminder
---
Just curious, but can you give 2 examples of a talent change shifting stat priorities that doesn't result in losing effectiveness?   I stopped playing BFA after 2 months and haven't kept up with it so I'm curious.
---
I‚Äôve leveled on both sides. People do the same shit either way, they take easy fights and avoid risky ones. I regret playing PvP servers, but I didn‚Äôt want to be without the option to PvP at all. Might just reroll and wait for battlegrounds.
---
You won't be able to do it in a single macro because your heal will trigger the gcd. You'll be able to do a pop out and cast a heal. Or even a pop out and cast NS and a big HT.. But you won't be able to go back in to a form on the same macro because of the gcd
---
I think you are missing the point. Op was talking about how they put in all this wonky and cool shit in vanilla, but went down a completely different road and lost track of what made the game cool and fun to play and explore.
---
Good lord
---
For PVP; Gnome is extremely handy since it can break through Mage's frostnova (which is warrior kryptonite). Gnomes also have the added bonus of having a small model size which makes people underestimate how much  you can wreck them in PVP.
---
Because it sadly is an identity you grasp on to because your personality is void of anything else

Have you tried at a different time of day?

I see. Thanks ( i dont think its worth either tbh- and without the archage robe its even less worth the hassle imo

It's in the same bag like congratulate to yourself after leveling up because everyone in group wrote gz :D Already happened 2 times.

Why not necromancer

I made it exactly because it is the "go to" starter app to learn something

I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you my dude. The internet is not a place of justice.  I think the karma will come back around to you if you continue to produce hard-hitting memes like this one, in the meantime I‚Äôm going to go upvote all your comments and posts for a little bump.
---
I feel like when they released Classic they should have done TBC and WOTLK servers. so people could play their fav expansions. I would have opted for tbc to but I don't want to progress from classic tbc, cause...well i really like the classic feel.
---
Omg i was almost dying here
---
Well, that's kinda sad. I hoped they would get rid of it for classic as it basically meant that certain specs were not viable for raids or had to perform worse than they could potentially.
---
Right? The more I see people in here whining, the more I wanna log on, go to Ashenvale and just shadowmeld near the street coming from the barrens. I don't do that shit often but damn this gives me motivation to go at it again. Not like there's so much to do at 60 anyway
---
Some people (like me) are going fast because they'll have limited playtime in the winter.
---
People's reasons for playing a certain way are nobody else's business.
---
Meh fuck peeps like that I still try to kill the dude.
---
You want to do the Shield first if you want it fool-proof. Equipping a one-hander sometimes puts the weapon in your offhand, so you'll end up unequipping it immediately afterwards. It's weird :(
---
For the life of me, I can't understand why people roll on a PvP servers and then complain about ganking. That's exactly what you bargained for.
---
So chill levelling and enjoying the game on PVE. No queues since day one either.
---
Tbh if you‚Äôre under 50 you can kinda just wing it unless your group has 3 clothie dps. I just let the rogues/warriors/ret applies/hunter‚Äôs pets tanks and with spend my ‚Äútanking effort‚Äù marking, coordinating pulls, avoiding other groups/pats, and taunting mobs off of clothies. It really is a lot to ask that DPS behaves in any dungeon under scholo. Like, too much to ask. The average rogue can take quite a beating assuming the healer is paying attention. 
---
I used to be a big believer in proper tanking techniques but unless the tank is 4-6 levels above the mobs in the dungeon, threat-gen with normal DPS is going to be a nightmare anyway. 
---
And hey, 99% of the time, the dps doesn‚Äôt even bitch about being hit. And if they do, I‚Äôll let them know the proper behavior of a 5-man dps, but honestly they would rather melt mobs and take hits then sit by and wait for 5x sunders before casting de-ranked spells. It‚Äôs their choice and I‚Äôm fine with it either way.
---
This is quite a lot of free time, it seems.
---
Install tsm for classic. It shows vendor value when u mouse over the item. If u make a "/tsm scan" every now and then, you will get approximate AH value too.
---
u just know that rogue was like "mages so op" in his guild chat afterward.
---
Nah probably just played an alt til things cooled down
---
couldn't a blacksmith open it, too?
---
How would knowledge that you have been carrying for 15 years not help :S
---
Dwarf Preist is a sure bet. It's one of the most sought after classes/races at level 60.
---
Model editing hasn't been possible in-game for years. The current client will immediately disconnect you if you've messed with any of the model files. Since WoW Classic is built on a legion client (which is why many modern day console commands and macroing methods are possible on Classic, as well as why the dungeon finder was shortly available during the Classic beta), you will find the same result if you try and model edit on live Classic. And while I'm quite sure that you're correct that exploration was not a bannable offense (people traveled to Hyjal, Quel'Thalas, Old Ironforge, etc. during vanilla without repercussion), I don't think model editing was ever not-bannable. Blizzard just didn't have the monitoring tools necessary to easily identify perpetrators. So if you weren't using it non-stop and blatantly, you might not have seen a ban. But after people started using it in Warsong Gulch to run the flag under the map, or Arathi Basin to cap bases before the game started, or Ahn'Qiraj to skip to C'thun without killing 90% of the bosses in the raid, it became a problem that was no longer harmless.
---
It's not a bug at all.
---
AFAIK it's something like 425 is the cap. Arcanite Fishing Pole + line + hat + boots allow you to use the baubles to hit the cap instead of the +100 lure that only lasts 5 minutes.
---
Sick rend!
---
Regrowth is really mana-inefficient, even with the talent (unless I did something wrong, which is possible). I wouldn't use it "most of the time".
---
It does have niche uses, though -- the cast is fast, so it's sort of like a flash heal (emergency heal). And the HoT is decent and lasts a long time, so e.g. if there is not much damage and you want to throw a heal and then cat for for a while or something, you can do that.
---
I played on Kronos and Nostalrius and there was an AoE meta and a lot of people farming e.g. the pirates near gadgetzan, but man I never experienced it like now. I'd never heard of massive AoE grinds in dungeons on this scale
---
I don't play priest myself but I know the priest-discord got some spreadsheets and other good information. You can check it out here: https://discord.gg/exJacWb
---
It is account-wide for now. I had opinions towards account-wise and character-wise but your suggestion might help with both! Thank you :)
---
Id really like to see them fix the rest of the bugs too. 
---
Loot in general is FUCKED. FFA or group loot are both screwy when questing with a friend.
---
Cant water walk in ghost wolf STILL for some reason. Hello Blizz?
---
Also batching just fucks hunter pets right the fuck up.
---
They're all made up
---
I‚Äôm fine with a good ganking but when people continuously camp you it gets kinda annoying. I‚Äôm not gonna complain because I picked a pvp server but still.
---
Phankrit. Meh
---
I started towards the end of the classic life cycle, not lonf before TBC came out (never reached max lvl till wrath as I always dropped in and out wow being a big Console gamer growing up or started alts with friends ect).
---
I quit at end of MOP expan.
---
Came back to legion for a month and hated it.
---
Started classic!
---
Doctors hate him!
---
Almost 300 fishing, never had this issue.
---
Read this and deal with the truth, guys. Exactly the kind of whining in this thread is responsible for retail pvp. Everything's boringly balanced and downscaled. Classic requires effort and a strong will, and you will get defeated a lot.
---
Ever play rust?
---
You kill on sight, and you burn down their hut. 
---
They are competition, and if they get powerful enough that can kill you and burn down your hut.
---
Complaining maybe no, but you have the right to question their motives when someone is camping low level zones.
---
Yep, rockbiter is consistently the best choice, whether you use 2h or 1h. Don't use in groups though unless you like pulling threat.
---
They will release payed character transfer soon or later but i can imagine how frustrating your situation is, i would be completely turned off the game.
---
*Gnomeregan
---
I'm surprised, with this being Classic and all, that you don't have a 50% chance to miss taking the picture and have to wait for the turtle to respawn to try again.
---
I think of the names as part of the class fantasy.  You need to know a demon‚Äôs true name to bind it to your will.  That‚Äôs part of how you summon and command them.

---
Not at all, I‚Äôm able to join groups very easily. It‚Äôs worth noting that for whatever reason, there are very few high level characters on this server yet.
---
&gt;other servers with medium to high have around 80k players in total.
---
And that's stupid as fuck. It's way too high for any one server to have. Vanilla was perfectly fine with a 4k cap on server size. Once layering goes away people are gonna be in for a shock when they realize how absolutely shitty their classic experience is going to be when there are 80k others instead of 4k.

Can you link me to what you were looking at that said mangle was in Vanilla?
---
It was in the game during the tbc pre-patch, but that's it.
---
Classic Alliance.. killing an AFK player 10 levels lower than you... scum.
---
I love the universe
---
Teleport Moonglade comes in very handy at times like that.
---
Yes! Now it is brighter and the effect is gone
---
I use it so I don't forget to sell my shit before going back questing again
---
where do i get the "A bump in the Road" quest ... i never found it this time around
---
Could be worse, although level ten is only a few hours tops. Tough call.
---
\&gt; EU it is pretty much instant in-log
---
Nope it's not :)
---
Wait wait wait wait wait. Auto-dismount add-on?
---
World pvp is fun though. What isn‚Äôt fun is when you get camped by a skull level horde that even after 10 mins of being ghost is still there to kill you again.
---
When i come back i kill all the fucking dwarfs!
---
Its a IT crowd reference
---
No, don't create the mindset of having to justify killing a lowbie. You can do that whenever you fucking feel like it on a pvp server. This is the wild west, no excuses, no rules. Consequences executed by the community itself. It's perfectly fine.
---
Welcome home :) but yeah that'd explain why you never heard of dkp most stopped using it in tbc but a still were using it but in wrath not a single should used it
---
Just remember you aren't skilled or good for killing someone 10 levels below you.
---
Off tanks have several purposes. 
---
First is for encounters with hard hitting adds. For golemagg in MC, he has dogs and you want an off tank on each dog. 
---
Second type of off tank is a player who keeps their threat at the second highest level on the boss. This serves several purposes. If the MT dies, you have someone to easily take over (not sure if this was prevalent on pservers as everything is so easy for us now). But, IIRC, bosses also sometimes have attacks that target the second highest threat player or the player with the highest HP, meaning the hits must be rotated throughout the group.
---
I dont mind low drop rates but fighting for tags still at 40+ is annoying.
---
Same boat here, although Ill quit this shit job in november. Been debating quitting earlier but when classic came out, it made me realize even more how much I hate this job
---
Shamans get fucked
---
And Horde is always easy mode because on average they have way more people. No horde should ever complain about WPvp. It‚Äôs handed to you on a silver platter.
---
As warlock, whenever I see filthy gnomes killing any kind of elementals, I wait when the elemental is low hp, banish it and then kill the stupid little midget.
---
Usernames even match, for those who didn't notice
---
Lol it is ugly, thanks mate
---
There are some getting started posts on the internet and some tutorials for specific things on youtube and forums. So you gotta mix them with what you want to do and learn with other addons. It is a lot of trial and error and asking the community
---
Weak is going on a pvp server to run away from the danger.
---
Sorry, I don't hate the game. I kind of like to farm and feel accomplished.
---
If you play on a normal or PvP server or whatever if you don't even play WoW, you have the right to express yourself about getting killed and complain as long as you respect others choices too. What irritates me is when people justify killing and camping greys for hours because "its a PvP server", like robots. It's okay if you want to kill anyone you want but let's but honest, it's more a frustration thing that you try to exhale than a feature of the game. It's not because the game allows it that you can't being angry about it.
---
You can do parallels in real life.
---
Oh well.
---
I  don't know about that dude lol. 
---
Blizzard gave weeks (that's weeks, not week. That means more than one week. 14 whole days at least) of warning to not remain on a ll pop server to avoid long queues. If you have long queues, that just means you don't listen to instruction. Don't blame blizzard for that because it is objectively your own fault and not theirs.  
---
Low pop servers are a result of this activity. Blizzard kindly gave everyone a chance to move servers and spread out (your job to spread out, not blizzards) and people were afraid to join a low server, so in turn these players literally created low servers by not spreading out and *actively choosing* queues (you) and then complaining about it. 
---
Blizzard has been pretty up front about layering. They put an end to this recent exploit like almost immediately. 
---
Stop whining.
---
I don't use macros, and maybe that's the difference, but I haven't had a single problem with FD.  Just gotta be a little patient and remember to stop your pet's attacks.

He can‚Äôt kill people at his own level.. give him a break ok!
---
Back in my day, PVP servers were for the *option* of glorious, honorable PVP. Kids with their battle royales trained them to just attack anyone on sight without any thought.
---
Yep. Pure cancer from start to finish.
---
yeah server first horde 60 was like last week i believe. I think it wasn't one of the servers that was available on release and that may be why, or the people are more chill and relaxed, just taking their time, plenty of activity though.
---
 I'm at the point now of being out of macro space.
---
Guess I have to get rid of some of the emotes I use during pvp.

Wierd I don‚Äôt see how spamming the button would make a difference but I‚Äôll definitely try it later

I came here to say that.

Once I wanted to make an addon that changed the colors on my keyboard based on skill cooldowns. To send the colors you just have to make local http request, but wow doesn't like that :(

Generally I would say I‚Äôm the same, I love a game with a good progression metric, but it turns out knowing I‚Äôve caused another person on the other side of the internet minor annoyance is also great
---
Same with Ghost Wolf, but I don't understand how I can skin or herb while wolf, but not collect mail, speak to anyone or collect quest items while wolf.
---
That's one of the next things i'm going to add right after sorting :)
---
Thanks, we are alone here.  
---
I think this is an advanced technique, and I understand not everyone can like it.  
---
But I don't admit being downvoted becuse I took TIME for sharing my knowledge that I have built in years (whether people like it or not) and I wanted to debate the best techniques.

I never said I am the best player in the World.

If your in my grp in a dungeon I expect water, same as you expect a buff from me and I probably dont say plz, as this is your job in a dungeon grp.  
---
But if I find a random mage out in the world I always tip or willing to pay for water.
---
During quests that is a pain.  OOM concerns.
---
sure mate, glad to help!
---
I plan to add some rewarding sound when you complete something
---
Something that more people in this thread should have done. Good decision, friend. Hope you're having fun over there!
---
I assune it is a limited item and someone just bought it
---
I know it's a BFA quote, but the tortollan Scrollsage Nola nailed it: "The cycle of life can be cruel" :D :D
---
You can make it more realistic by having the warrior eating a meaty haunch he bought off a vendor.
---
Limited stock recipe that is farmed heavily due to being mentioned in most tailoring leveling guides. Almost every time I‚Äôve tried there‚Äôs multiple horde and alliance waiting at the vendor.
---
it sucks that blizz does not allow transfers for people who have already transferred from a hi pop to a low pop server.
---
People just don't understand how economies work, real life or in the game. If you want to compete, you have to offer a better product or sell cheaper. You can't offer a better quality of a product in this game, so "undercutting" is the only option. 
---
Everyone could agree to just sell things for one single price and create what amounts to an oligopoly, but even then there is a high chance no one buys your specific one and you waste gold on deposits, only an idiot doesn't undercut when his shit won't sell. The only exception is if an item will shoot up in value later on and you want to bank it, like twink BoEs.
---
The irony is, he admitted to buying the entire stock and reselling higher. He is price fixing, and yet he is mad at OP for undercutting.
---
Yes the soundtrack is amazing all around.
---
That's because people who do that don't have friends to brag to, and the chat will just ridicule them.
---
Yeah stv is always like that and it's to be expected I agree. But having played wow on pvp servers since actual classic launch I have literally never seen such a disparity as I have in Stalaag. I mean it was crazy man.
---

---
The maintank tanks the bulk of the damage and threat in an encounter, where the offtank will do things such as:
---
Encounters with adds - pick up adds to protect the DPS/healers. 
---
Some encounters have mechanics that require a second tank to absorb damage, I seem to remember an encounter where the boss had a cleave that would split it's damage between targets in front of it?
---
Other encounters might require taunt-swapping, due to a stacking debuff on the main tank for example.
---
The offtank can also be used if your MT dies to prevent a wipe (you'll usually have a combat rez available to recover, but you need to protect everyone in the meantime)
---
I've probably missed some stuff. These are just vague memories from WotLK.
---
Yep, something is messed up. I've seen 2 robes in 2 runs as well. I also feel like rare elites I'm dungeons are almost always up.
---
&gt; Many players choose not to gank (especially in phase 1) because it means they are also less likely to die. This choice seems like a much more realistic and engaging world to me than ‚Äúif it‚Äôs red it‚Äôs dead.‚Äù
---
there' s no honor system so there's no intrinsic reward for pvping other than the joy of pvp itself, so
---
basically i'm out here trying to level, and pvp takes time away from that. if i pass by horde, i usually wave and just go about my business. i'm a priest, people aren't shy about trying to fight me when they feel froggy. but if they don't, and we're just both out here trying to level, i'm willing to extend the mutual respect of "let's get this bread" until we get to 60
---
For us it's been mostly a case of "ok 8 more panthers, let's hope the 50 people waiting for their respawn don't tag them first" more than a pvp issue
---
I wonder if it has something to do with skinning.
---
More people have the 1.1.5 version on retail than on classic!
---
Exactly my thoughts.
---
Presence of Mind in the Arcane tree and Pyroblast will be your absolute best friend.

Couldn't you buy this on the auction house or have someone else craft it for you? I mean is 1 BoE item worth the profession over BoE items you get with engineering? Not OP but I have the same question, doubting if I should drop blacksmithing (currently at skill 200) for engineering maybe. I know engineering is considered best for tanks by far.
---

I swear too many of you don't get the post is not about him killing the dam horde, it's that charging at him on the boat shot him in the air jeez.
---
&gt;What's fun in stomping a low level?
---
It doesn't matter what I answer, like 70% of here have the mindset of "pvp needs to be fair and square", but that's just not how Vanilla was. So yes, this guy saw a low level dude fishing and we didn't even see that person getting killed. Why are people assuming the worst like he corpse camped him for hours or screwed his mom or something? He probably left them alone after and they continued fishing happily ever after. People take this way too seriously man, and it actually only encourages more of this behaviour.
---
You can't outgear him but you can zerg him to fuck.
---
Y Same for me, this recipe is camped by 3-10 Players everytime
---
A few moments later...
---
You think its over soon, but someone did aggro the dark iron dwarfs in the tram tunnel and soon.. you will see train of dwarfs running towards your inevitable doom.
---
Yesterday i made a lot of macros for my druid and i saved them. Today when i entered, the macros were not there neither on my action bars, what do you think caused it?
---
You won't get a fair price for it for a good while.
---
This is the best advice here really, ele is much better than enhance after 40 due to talents, gear availability opening up, and spellpower/damage scaling better than melee after 40.
---
hopefully. im hoping all the twitch crowd leaves, those like you who are playing only because youre afriad  of missing out but wish for its death, and just any other retards. the pop needs to cut in half in order to remove layering.

PvP while you are evenly matched is generally really fun. And there's no "I am wasting my time" when you are playing the game and having fun - and that's what I do in wPvP, even if I level up slower when doing PvP.
---
Eh. If I can kill you, you‚Äôre in a pvp server or flagged for pvp. It‚Äôs pet of the game and the last thing I‚Äôm going to do is let the other faction have it easy.
---
Do they both connect to the same chat?
---
Im already starting to get bored with it. I didnt really see it sticking either. Been there done that after the hype died down.
---
This. 
---
I like questing with a horde player in the proximity, it could go either way and the tension is awesome
---
he did use mind-numbing poison...
---
For the love of all that is holy, will you put rank 1 frostbolt on your hot bar. Rogue wouldn‚Äôt even have gotten close with that.
---
Yeah, I used to be that way on other games like dayz and what not.  Then I wondered why the community had gone down the toilet and realized I was part of the problem.  If you're series then don't be surprised if the classic servers go back to 80% horde 20% alliance one day.
---
Standing around the uo moongate:
---
&gt; I pay my taxes, where are my *guards*?
---
Idk about leveling - do what you like there - but definitely get professions that complement each other. If you decide to mostly level one or the other, get gathering profs on that one, and crafting profs on the one you don't play as much, so you can gather All The Things while questing and send them to the crafting alt.
---
I took for granted that he primarily wanted to move gold
---
Unless it's your job to write comics...
---
I Had like 50s at one point around 33 got my mount at around 43. Use skinning if you have it and mining.
---
People lowball so many items you could clear them out and resell for a profit. I did this with ores most of the time somebody would lowball ores on the auction house which you could smelt into bars in the process and sell for more and make that profit. But you could simply do this with so many different mats.
---
Also once you get to 40 you just get gold from everything, I probably made 50 gold from just running dungeons from 40-43.
---
&gt; You basically wear it ALL THE TIME ~~on a pvp server~~
---
You wear it all the time, because asshole alike to treat PvE servers like they are PvP. 
---
I just want to quest, why do you have to camp and follow me for an hour!?
---
Tried to buy it like 10 times, different parts of the day. And the vendor was never alone, always at least few people waiting there and no recipe on stock. I guess I just find someone to craft my bags and will use something else to level my tailoring.
---
I have experience with this. I walked to Everlook at level 35 to get this recipe. Horrible idea, don‚Äôt recommend. 
---
After many deaths I got to everlook, and bag is not in stock. I set my hearth and keep checking back. Never there. 
---
What I found is that her stock ‚Äúrefreshes‚Äù every 10-20 minutes. There are usually others around her camping as well. You need to stand there, and continually close and open her shop. If you leave it open, it won‚Äôt appear that it refreshed. 
---
Keep spamming this shop for hours, careful not to right click any opposing factions, and hopefully you‚Äôll get it.
---
welcome to vanilla
---
how did he know your name? thats some amazing brute
---
It respawns randomly with other recipes every 10-15 minutes. I went there a saturday morning at around 7 am and got it first try.
---
I totally agree, but wow is almost like a Korean mmo, you can be a Panda fighting with a magma Corgi.
---
Yea, didn't even consider moving items, only considered currency
---
Holy shit... I literally haven't seen one boomkin, literally not one.
---
Have you tried to reload your UI?

I have never switched layers intentionally, I am wondering if I can report everyone constantly asking for layer invites.
---
There is no honor among thieves :-(

Thanks captain!

That was rank1 frostbolt
---
Spam dungeons to level up. Made 160g from 33-42
---
Ah, so that's why I got a lone warlock curse on me on the stv troll area. Lol.
---
&gt; I just decided to give the game up at level 45. 
---
Dude, you're at 45. I feel like I've played what feels like constantly outside of work and on weekends, and I'm nearing 42 - and that's with me losing 1 day due to server queues. Maybe you should relax and realize you're doing fine lol.
---
Pulling admins in 3...2...1.
---
I spend about 3 hrs, if I have time. Btw, brand new to wow, it‚Äôs taken me back to older mmos like lineage 2 or aion, when they were good. 
---
Got a family though so it‚Äôs been fun learning the game with my 6 year old.
---
I was questing and suddenly the layer changed, got instantly ganked by several patrolling NPCs and a high level player. Unless this shit changes really soon, I am not resubbing.
---
Wholesome.
---
What? Was post Malone a thing back then?
---
any tldr?
---
Now you're just being weird.

Why are you explaining horde players?

No it shldnt do that.. If u change stance it does but it dsnt look like u r

Rank 1 frostbolt saves lives.
---
Yea i did, they were still missing and i had to make them again.
---
I had the same issue with that and a few other quests. Never sure what I missed. Let me know if you find an answer.
---
That's not karma, that's just you calling someone out for being a dick.
---
They're near a wrecked ship around the north edge of the zone. They spawn sporadically all over, but there's a concentration of them there.
---
Feels like my Sea of Thieves everyday-experience :-)
---
Way to tedious imho but good on ya!
---
They aren't. It's called a joke.
---
gave me reason to live, and its done it again.
---
Where people get invites from others to intentionally change between layers and get fresh mobs. There is a particular glitch in dungeons where it‚Äôs used to respawn a boss or something, I don‚Äôt really know the details on that one.

If it is the same knowledge from 15 years ago, how would it make you better at clearing Onyxia? It is the same knowledge you used when you killed her the first time when it was harder.
---
Patience is not what you can afford in the situations you need a FD Trap Combo most
---
Every time i see a low level ally i hop into cat form, run at them and aggressively lick them several times. Its funny how they always run away.
---
thank you so much for this detailed post. I really appreciate it and it's great to finally learn how it works lol. 
---
while I got you here, I'm not sure if you saw my previous post but I'm leveling with a priest who has aggro 99% of the time we're fighting mobs while leveling. I was thinking since I'll be behind my target almost constantly it's worth using a dagger build. what are your thoughts? I'm only going to be leveling this rogue while I'm playing with my friend.
---
Its Bis for roleplaying and lookingike a badass. Pretty sure the stats are good but I wouldn't lose any sleep over not getting the full set
---
In using the ThreatPlates add-on and loving it, but I'm having one issue.
---
Allied nameplates display in groups just fine *except* when I am in an instance; in which case the default Blizzard ones are displaying. The only other add-on I run that I think interferes with nameplates is Z-Perl.
---
I could really use the ThreatPlates nameplates over my allows because they display what spells they are casting and what debuffs they have active. Does anyone know what settings I might have to tweak to get the ThreatPlates instead or Blizzard's default nameplates?
---
Again, they display just fine except when in instances.
---
Yo just use google remote desktop.   Wtf are those extra layers and binds?   For everyone who have problems centering their camera just cycle through the camera positions on your Home button. (Virtual or physical  keyboard)
---
As a feral druid it fucking sucks when I have to keep asking for the dps to wait a second before attacking. I range pull with faerie fire a pack of 3, and a mage instantly blinks in and arcane explosion/cold of cone before I've even hit them yet. Or a warrior charged in and instantly starts whaling on them, attacking mobs who aren't skull because they're "trying to spread deep wounds :)".
---
Didn't happen to me. I teleported to moonglade and continued fishing for nightfins without issues.
---
I heard it was because of skinning - if there was no loot window, people could ninja your skins before you can even reach the mob to loot it (if playing ranged).
---
How convinient of you to ignore profession alts who are forced to level to 20-35 to max out their profession. Your arguments are shit-tier because you ignore key points to further your narrative.
---
You are factually incorrect and this isn't even amusing anymore, don't need to see your braindead jargon so goodbye.
---
Read the fucking ability you're killing it with.
---
Metagaming is ruining it for people that aren‚Äôt aoe dps or the healer to go with them. Aoe runs were a niche thing in vanilla and now they are making dungeon groups way more prohibitive than they should be with the high server pops because if you‚Äôre not a mage or warlock you‚Äôre not even considered a dps for 75% of groups. Also a ridiculous amount of salty bozos that get pissed and make the group miserable because it‚Äôs NOT an aoe group but they want it to be.
---
Lol. Ok. 
---
How to say, "back in my day I didn't play on a PvP server," but with more words.
---
Did you execute at the end? :)
---
I am not series, I am UD ROGUE ü§üüèª
---
&gt; Hows realistically will blizzard switch of layering? The servers are way  to high to handle that many players. everyone is refusing to leave the  high pop servers in fear of low pop being dead. 
---
People being stubborn is once again not Blizzard's fault. They will turn off layering in phase 2, and people will transfer off the servers once they realize that they need to wait 10+ hours to play again, **as was warned by Blizz over and over and over and over again.** It's not their fault that people like yourself were too stubborn to listen.
---
&gt; I agree that servers should be less then what they are but low pop  servers need 10k unique players AT LEAST to thrive.  not everyone's  going to me logged on at the same time except for new content. 
---
Didn't you say earlier that this was the case with the low pop servers? Something like 5k each for alliance and Horde? So I fail to see an issue. 
---
&gt; let's not talk about server faction balance, which needs to be also addressed. 
---
Shocking, yet again not a Blizzard issue. I think you need to take a minute to look at what exactly is the cause of each and every one of these issues. Hint: It's **THE PLAYERS**.
---
Mostly because the majority of guides were written from private servers.  Warlocks have the same issue.  Voidwalkers were overtuned and most guides say that you should always use the Voidwalkers and skip your other pets.
---
Just work on your weapon skills, fight yellow mobs or lower, pull safely.
---
Yes I'm aware, mine was a family guy reference.
---
No. 
---
By that logic all loot drop belongs to warrior because he is tanking the ƒ±nstance.
---
happy cake day mate!

They can't attack you on PvE though...
---
It is a limited items that is heavily farmed.
---
The best time to get it is in the middle of the night.
---
Makes sense, ty :)
---
Sweet
---
You never really need to go full tank when leveling. Equipping a sword and board is good enough. You def should use 2h tanking when you can afford the healing in dungeons in well as you add a lot of DPS.
---
this hasnt been true for me a lot of the time, with misses parries etc fighting mobs equal or below by 1 which is what im grinding.
---
and if thats the case then you can slice and dice at 4 combo right before kill so you carry over the dps to the next mob
---
I see, I'm standing there alone right now, lets hope it spawns soon!
---
Play an rppvp or normal server, it's much much less prevalent than PvP servers.
---
Right, it makes sense now, ty!
---
So in a war, you would let the enemy fish up valuable food that will feed the enemy troops? Suppliers die first.
---
Battlegrounds aren‚Äôt coming out until later. World pvp will be the only option.
---
Hillsbrad on Wyrmthalak(EU RU) is permanent warzone on weekends with Alliance and Horde raids(sic!) going after one another. Epic fights for yeti cave all day long, but I don't think anyone quests there anymore. If you are going to Hillsbrad - you are going to participate in some 30-40 raid on raid action, no other purpose.
---
I'm talking level 60 dungeons. No problems with them getting hit to hard. I would welcome more druid tanks to my groups.
---
Gonna camp it right now, it's not very busy in Everlook atm.
---
Thanks! :)
---
I dont think it is new one tough. I remember Felwood tuber farming with addon which counted from 5 to 0 and said smt like pick it up now!! And everyone clicks on tuber, loot duplicates. Nobody was angry about it.
---
He used evasion...lol
---
Imo the big issue is that blizzard WAY over corrected on these things on retail. Ive played on and off since Vanilla was released and here are some of my opinions:
---
I think that summoning stones were a good thing, Group/ raid finder were not. 
---
Talent trees are a good thing, making only one spec viable is not. 
---
Decent pacing is arguably a good thing, one shotting a yellow mob with 1 moonfire is not. 
---
Having a lot of gear options and gear progression is a good thing, giving out so much gear that the absolute minimum for raids is becomes being full purple armor is not. 
---
More flight points were great, every single class having a movement speed buff and 40 different flying mounts is not. 
---
Classic absolutely has flaws that can be corrected. blizzards issue has always been just completely over correcting the issue until it‚Äôs an issue on the other side of the spectrum. 
---
Side note: I‚Äôll never understand the reasoning why they completely gutted professions as the game progressed and they are absolutely my favorite part of classic so far.
---
Have you ever experienced the sheer awesomeness that are Tanaris's sand storms?
---
The mobs just tend to get obliterated but 10 people waiting for anything to spawn.
---
Classic Warrior experience: You can't do that while dead
---
Ah okay, so survivability (At least with a healer) is fine even without going into the tree. Good to know.
---
Kited in

Maybe don't roll on a PVP server then.

What addon do u use for cast bars?
---
Just realised Swedish name their kids the Swedish word for "to glisten" - Tindra and "Fairytale" - Saga.
---
Nope, these quests are the best way to level up. They keep you grinding while being motivated and you net a lot of xp like it's nothing.
---
Enlighten me. How should he open?

Is there any viable alternative to Devilsaur gloves/legs as a rogue? They look so awful and the idea of potentially wearing them for an extended period of time is genuinely making me think about rolling a different class.
---
Horde on PVP Server "Dreadmist" is so embarrassing. I play WL, and those hordies only attack when they are +1 at least, you are infight, AFK or low on health. They have no honor whatsoever. 
---
They just want to ruin your experience, which is fine. But I never saw one attacking me while full health and being active. 
---
I got all the names down and the list is 23 names long, i got already 5 at revenge in a fair fight.
---
&gt;available immediately after launch, yet you still spent 10 days played on an overpopulated one. Gotcha.
---
Lol, servers were released one by one once one sever got full, they were not released in one go, in fact over a number of days. was you even here when it happened. seems like you have no clue. The only person who has been "caught" is your fabricated unintelligent donkey ass. Come at me with real facts not ones pulled from your backside. 
---
I had already invested to much time into my character to re-roll.
---
It's a limited one that spawns every so often as other people have said. The biggest problem is that there are people that just sit on it with multibox characters macroing the buy slot for recipes and then put it up on the AH for 50 gold.
---
God damnit, Leb.

Laughs in medium pop server.

Seriously so glad I transfered to a lower pop server.  It's a lot more like the wow I remember now not nearly as many tryhard members and douchebags.   It's just a much more pleasant experience.

Well, they can skin and herb but not eat meat as a bear.

That is actually retarded.

SHAME
---
Sequences are always a bad idea, always. Be it mana issues, resists/misses etc. when there's an element of unreliability involved it is a MUCH better idea to get comfortable with more buttons than one suboptimal button.
---
My group does it to Alliance as well on Faerlina, as long as they go along with it. Give them a /wait and a /calm; I Mind Control them, my group buffs them, and I end MC with a Fort.
---
Sometimes they freak out and start attacking, many realize we weren't going to kill them so they stop shortly after (we give them a little grace period to come to terms with what we just did) and then everyone /hugs and goes about their merry day!
---
I have no confirmation of whether or not it gets talked about, but when I was questing in Tanaris between zombie groups I did experience a group of 3 Ally gank the Horde quester nearby me, then run over to /hello me. I like to think it had something to do with it.
---
Of course this assumes the Alliance person isn't in one of the &lt;Olympus&gt; guilds... then they just get murdered.
---
What a noob, he could've waited till you killed the mobs, was low on hp and mana, sat down to drink and THEN open with Ambush (dont stun you moron, he'll blink away) and get 100% crit on that ambush because he's sitting and immediately backstab.
---
I do this on my Druid and it's fairly similar I believe, I ravage from stealth on a sitting cloth, at around 40 it crits for over 800, auto attack kicks in aswell for a few 100 hits and I shred. = mage dead without even able to respond.
---
People say it doesn't matter but it really does matter and makes you angry after a certain point in time.
---
I know it's just a game but when you try to make someone else miserable YOU the player are the one who is cruel. It's not Mokanrek or w/e you named your green sword guy.
---
It's you. Joe, Sam, Mark, Dan, whatever your name is.
---
42.069 to be precise
---
Yeah that was my big problem with artifact weapons. They were cool, but lost their sheen when every single person had the same one.
---
I remember getting modded against in ranked games on sanctuary and seeing that sniper smoke everywhere
---
I'm not arguing people will have profession alts. I'm arguing this early in the game there are nowhere enough to really skew the numbers. The number of alts per faction isn't skewed because alliance or horde are incentivized to create bank or profession alts. In a month or two, this will probably affect the disparity in number of characters but it's easy too early to make a substantial difference. 
---
Again, this information isn't exact by any means but it's a great guide.
---
I have one simple rule right now in P1 when it comes to PvP: If it‚Äôs a gnome, they die.
---
Yeah my server is the second heaviest horde in EU.
---
I don't think it helps that the horde have a zepelin and a stronghold in STV.
---
Alliance get half a camp.
---
I kind of remember being in an Ony raid once and everybody in a particular group was flagged for PvP.  Someone asked if they were out doing BGs, but they said the mage was and now everyone had to flag or arcane brilliance wouldn't work.
---

---
Is it possible to view a friendly target's spec/talent point spent?
---
If you‚Äôre Horde Shaman sounds perfect for you. Leveling is easy with your self sustain, ghost wolf form, 15 min hearth, and if necessary reincarnate. You can dps your way to 60, and if finding a group is taking too long you can offer to heal, just have an heal set of gear on you. 
---
At 60 you bring some dmg to the table, though especially as fights get longer shaman dmg reallly falls off (but not everyone can top dmg meters, someone has to be mid/ low dmg). Thankfully you also bring a ton of utility with totems, cleanses, purge, and other fun stuff. 
---
For pvp you have the king of burst dmg as elemental shammy, who is also arguably the best duelist in Classic. Or if you‚Äôre just looking to fuck around slap a 2h on with windfury and watch as your gamble pays off when you 1 shot someone with a windfury crit.
---
Talking about my own experiences - just because it's 36% alliance doesn't mean that every place i quest in has that specific population of alliance:horde.
---
lol people talk about alliance ganking lowbies but i (as alliance) was always the one being attacked! Even by lower level horde. They all died, but still... iiiii never initiated it lol
---
I thought There are no numbers how many hordlers and allies are on a server. Do you have direct connection to blizzard coworkers? 
---
Please show me your source, i am really interested :-)
---
I didn't want to go back to Darnassus and I was like "I might as well collect those flight paths then".

30-40 consists on constantly swapping between Desolace, Arathi, and STV (maybe Alterac but I never went there. If you can find groups, running SM is also a great way to earn xp, plus it helps in affording your mount
---
 Mana cost of  Mark + Thorns is  roughly similar to Fort (though yes Fort is higher).  Source, I play both classes and try to buff everyone I see.  it's a bit harder on priests and sometimes I run out.
---
As both classes  I prefer Int over  paw / fortitude, but someday I  should learn to feral.

This was me as a warr in westfall the other day. A lvl 35 priest followed me for 5 minutes just healing me whenever I needed it :)

You may be right, which you are, but it still annoys the shit out of me when people say seen instead of saw or other similar things.
---
That is actually retarded, *please*.
---
oh okay!
---
Ofc hes talking about pvp. When do you think a hunter needs FD &amp; trap combo the most? When you are fighting a couple of boars or some rogue ganking you from behind
---
Nope!
---
Killing lowbies is pointless to me completely. You know you are gonna win regardless its like fighting a child. I know that most of lowbies wouldn't act the same if we switched sides but it still doesn't make it any more fun just to fuck with someone. People who kill lowbies have some sort of hidden insecurities were they have to show how more powerful they are. Its weird. Just because the server is pvp doesn't mean you have to be "if he RED I attack! DOOooOh. I can't attack if BluE!"

I was thinking about a lock actually! How are they to level?

You're totally entitled to that annoyance my friend. My big one is irregardless. But correcting people is bad mojo!
---
You are quite correct - In my defense I was quite drunk when I wrote that comment yesterday and very much thought I was saying something that made sense
---
Sounds like Tibia... ?
---
Oh yea wonderfull kill on someone with low hp , big player you are man
---
Thank you for all the valuable advice, so nice of you! Maybe the anxiety mention was unnecessary, just wanted to put it there as an explanation of why I may seem overly scared of doing wrong and destroy something for everyone else. Being prepared is good for everyone of course and I just want to pay my due in my chosen class. Toxicity I can handle, as long as I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong, therefore: preparations. 
---
The advice on etiquette regarding the plans/recipes was unknown to me, good to know! The times I've been in a group I usually put greed on everything, it's just fun to be playing.
---
Lol nice I like the rules
---
That's just like, your opinion, man
---
Repeating, of course.
---
Come on, this rogue really fucked up. 
---
Let's start from the beginning. Mind numbing poison suggests this was premeditated, but where is the crippling poison? If you have time to choose a poison to your weapon against a frost mage, and you don't pick crippling poison, you need to rethink your priorities. If he put crippling in the offhand and got unlucky, well, yes, that's unlucky, but you can swap your weapon to ensure the crippling on the engage then swap it back. Good rogues often use macros for this.
---
Next: doesn't have improved sprint. What are you doing trying to gank a mage without that talent?
---
Next he blinds at a terrible time, it gets instantly dropped by the mob, the correct time to blind was after the cold snapped frost nova, this eats into the nova debuff and allows you to force a sub-optimal ice block when you re-engage.
---
Having already mucked up the blind, the Mage actually gives him an out, he polys. This would have given the Rogue a reset, the rogue loses out on the stealth opener, but the mage doesn't have cold snap available, I think this is actually a pretty fair trade considering how badly he timed the blind. Using the Vanish here is not great, Vanish needs to get better value than this rogue used it for.
---
The rogue could actually have hit one of the raptors, this would put him on the aggro table, and when he got polymorphed, the raptor would have attacked him out of it.
---
If he had blinded when I said earlier, he still would have had vanish available.
---
Lastly, what are you doing opening cheap shot from your vanish? If you aren't on dagger spec, you should be using garrotte here, it eats into ice barrier and mana shield, the mage is going to insta-blink anyway, so at least get SOMETHING out of your stealth opener.
---
At this lower level, the frost mage does have an advantage, but at higher level the rogues talents will even out the fight. Even with that in mind, there was multiple things the rogue could have done better.
---
The big one was that he just threw the blind away.
---
Not sure who's the scum here
---
how is leveling as Ele? Right now I am putting my points into Enhance but all my gear is INT+Stam so I can use Frost Shock more and I think it is working so far (only lvl24)
---
Very easy. Almost no downtime with drain tanking, and quests are a breeze. You can solo elites 5 levels above you with fear and dots. We are also loved for our AoE, teleports, soulstones etc. In fact if you have a priest in the group we have the highest AoE DPS with hellfire.
---
I feel attacked by this because I literally find myself getting bored after an hour or two of questing and I start trying to see if I can jump onto things or find a hidden gem.
---
My cat comes and sits in front of the screen and either headbutts it or stares at me.
---
that quest is hella annoying. MOVE IT GIRL
---
Haven‚Äôt seen that command. I‚Äôll try that when I get home. What does it do?
---
Well damn. I'm sold.
---
As if it wasnt a lot of work for him or something?
---
I dont get what you're trying to say lol, just because he did it quicker than you?
---
Unless you're reading it like "after all these years finally i did blah", but should be reading it as "finally after all my late nights, skipped work days, and nonc-communication with my gf i hit 60"
---
Decking out alts is normal
---
Thanks - tbh they are paraphrased from other comments and posts I have seen on this sub
---
The spell damage increase the total damage of the spell, not every hit.
---
They're one of if not the easiest classes to level.  Pet makes a lot of your fights smooth, life tap and drain life keep you close to if not always topped off.  Fear keeps you safe, soul stone protects you from mistakes.  Plus they're bad ass powerhouses for raids.
---
They were rolled out on player demand. It's not that PvE servers are overcrowded either. I haven't seen a queue since launch day
---
What do you mean this early in the game??? There are lvl 60's everywhere, people have hundreds of gold on mains, MC has been beaten by all major guilds already, what are you talking about?
---
A lot of people literally START the game by making 4 different accounts for the sole purpose of profession alts so that when they play their main they can feed the alts with all the mats they need and this way they will almost never need the AH. Got a enchant+tailoring alt for bags and enchants, a leatherwork+blacksmith alt for any armor needs, weapon sharpeners and armor kits, an alt with alchemy+herbalism to have unlimited pots when leveling, and then finally the main with skinning+mining so that you can fully supply every single alt while you level.
---
It doesn't take YEARS for a server to start making profession alts. Infact, why would they need it after a year? This shit is important in the beginning and will become redundant over time as their mains get richer.
---
Keep in mind every alt will be a money maker for them. They save money by being able to skip AH for almost all items they'd need, they make money by selling excess stuff on the AH, and they can fully focus on one alt to get it to 35 with max professions, preferrably on a mage, so that they can sell enchants, sell magecloth bags or others, sell portals to cities, sell conjured food/water, and this is INSANE money.
---
I've said enough now, so go on and keep being ignorant while I turn the notifications off.
---
This is not nearly as important as hit being ignored.
---
The link you are referring to is US servers not EU. I am talking about EU servers.

ugh...

Attacking a mage with blink on CD who's also kiting 3 raptors is more like competing in a cross-country car with a fighter-jet.

It's fun.

So yesturday I was doing this during the stairs part of ZF, since it takes a while before all the mobs spawns. But you guessed it, I managed to land the perfect tony hawk pro skater 2 slide, perfect slide to the bottom of the stairs, at the same time of the spawns. Aggro‚Äôed like 30 mobs, and as I was about to die, I typed ‚Äúworth‚Äù in the party chat. They didn‚Äôt like me very much after this..
---
Maybe I just kill in return when someone screwed with me earlier. Either way, just saying if the rogue wanted to gank he should've done it better. 
---
Sometimes PVP is all about working things in your favor. If you're on a PVP realm, it's alliance vs horde. Faction war. Don't cry about a faction killing the other faction when it's part of the game. And if you don't like PVP maybe you should reroll on a PVE realm where everything is peaceful. Not judging.
---
There's an Add-On called something like "Thanks for the buff" which auto /cheers at anyone outside of your party that drops you a buff.
---
Automated politeness!
---
That's how you do it. Their fault of not expecting the worst.

My GF plays mage. I give her might. Look over at her.

---
If they're only level 31 in STV I'm not sure you can consider it getting ganked.
---
Probably because the damage you lose with the butcher being in the off hand exceeds the damage you gain from sword of omen in the main hand. Compare them one at a time without dual wielding.
---
What is the best/most fun twink to make? And what level should I get that twink to?

Not thaaaaat much but, its ok.
---
Hunters/warlocks can solo farm Maraudon for about 40-50 gold per hour - run past everything, kill gizlock+princess+rotgrip and vendor drops. Mages can aoe farm elementals for elemental drops. Just running dungeons is also decent gold, undead stratholme is pretty good IIRC if you clear everything.
---
Its pvp, its, it's not suppose to be fair...
---
To add to that: the bad thing about casters is the commitment to casting their spells, i.e people love to abuse line of sight so your cast doesn't go off, they'll use interrupts, stuns etc. Warlock has a lot of instant cast spells and DoTs so PvP feels less frustrating.
---
Alliance are fucking hilarious

Until you see that shaman tier set
---
Satisfying and efficient. Your rotation basically revolves around throwing out a load of damage over time spells and wanding things to death. Your Voidwalker can tank for you if you're smart about not pumping out too much threat. You can solo most group quests by chain fearing mobs as long as you've cleared the surrounding area first. They're second behind hunters in terms of leveling speed only because they get aspect of the cheetah, in fact I believe the world first 60 in original wow was a gnome warlock. You get a free level 40 mount. You'll always be loved in dungeons because of your ability to summon and put a soulstone on the healer in case of a wipe (so they can instant res). At 60 they're great gold farmers and scale really well when geared. Their cookie cutter pve spec (sm/ruin) is also a perfectly viable pvp spec so there's no need to respec all the time. Have I convinced you yet? :)
---
Are you at the elementals next to Kargath? I can't complete a quest there for like a week now because there are always people farming there.
---
More than enough
---
Eh, he's certainly not gonna have an easy time getting into a raid as oomkin. Also the aura is only group wide, crit, and only 3%.
---
So  I originally started out as a Warrior intent on tanking 5 Mans for the  friends and family.  However, that has proven difficult with each member having varying schedules and quantity of game time.  Some can play for  weeks at a time, some only hours.  No one wants to hold anyone back, so  the level difference has started to grow.  Which mostly leaves me  soloing as a Warrior.  Which is....challenging.  Looking down the  timeline I don't see me being an MT for a raid but maybe DPS warrior?
---
So,  that has me wondering if I should stop now (as a Warrior) and pick up  Warlock (my other favorite).  The logic being if i am not likely needed for MT during raids and leveling as a warrior would be slow, should I  pick up a DPS class that would solo better and raid as DPS with him?  My  only regret is the amount of effort and time poured into my Warrior.
---
Am I missing anything?
---
I really don't think druids are dumpster class at all, and theres such a broad misunderstanding of this game from this viewpoint it's very narrow sighted and frustrating. The only arguably trash spec would be boomkin deep balance, but resto/balance is pretty strong in a world pvp and pvp in general. Personally I think the shaman and druid are similar in role. The flexibility is the key of the class.
---
Tl;dr people who wont invite you to their super sick minmax group of perceived best classes for roles are insecure about their abilities. Or serious competitive speed farmers in which case they wouldnt give you an option of what to roll ;D
---
Priest is good but only a few buttons - and kinda one sided support. Obviously this post is a bit bias :D
---
Makes clouds more 3d and darkens sky little bit more at night.
---
Raids are at lvl 60, there are 40 men and currently are available only Molten Core (takes a couple of hours) and Onyxia (1 boss raid). Until then, there are 5 men dungeons used for loot, mob XP and quests XP. It takes up to 1 hour and you should focus on keeping up with the group (not to get lost), not to pull extra mobs, dps and enjoy the new experience!
---
I just love the comments on this.
---
Istill have this game on my PS1. So fantastic
---
I give you my respect
---
The hope is that next time you'll be wise enough to pull mobs you can kill.
---
Whys that? Is it really worth me lvling my skill with axes? Since ive been using a sword the entire game?
---
I'm level 43 and I'm still getting jumped and killed in STV. I honestly could wait until I'm level 90 and there would still be a gang of level 30s that would come out of the trees to camp my corpse.
---
You can start casting it right after your auto attack sure but whenever it finishes casting is when it resets the auto attack timer. So more accurately, you need to cast it so that it finishes casting right after your auto attack. Thing is you need to also estimate how much the knockback is going to increase the cast time. Over all it just feels like to much work
---
Id love to kill those who killed me, but first I need to get out of level 18. And Im lost.
---
I'm doing the pushups, and it's enough for me. I've done over 1000 pushups since launch, so I don't think I could take adding additional exercies.
---
This is a good example of how downranking works
---
&gt;The unfair wpvp forces you off the railroad tracks and makes you   
---
&gt;Pvp servers aren't supposed to be fair 1v1 duels.
---
so getting corpse camped for 30+ min when u are solo by 3+ of the other faction when their team consists of 1-2 of ur own lvl and 2 or more ?? lvl is how it's supposed to be? because this is what i dealt with for the last 3 days. every day. i am not exaggerating. 
---
i can only play for 2 hours after work and when i dont run Dungeons. i spent over 50 % of that time dead and running back to my corpse..
---
And then the warrior sees it as an act of aggression and instantly attacks you:(
---
Though I like your idea of wanding them better over my standard melee attack, as then at least I won't be in melee range if they decide to throw a hissy-fit.
---
&gt;      
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I was expecting the no data, but would have been kind of neat to be able to use one for a homelab or something. Although the price would have been surprisingly low for a functional server.
---
I think it's still possible to get it working again. They probably won't fully break it. I think they just take out the CPU, memory, and probably PSU.
---
Well I never reached 70 in tbc as I couldn't afford it. Just seals and judgements.
---
You should be good. WOW in general doesn't take alot of bandwidth. I can play off of min internet at work. Wire up and shouldn't have any issues.
---
I play on a 62/38 split server. That‚Äôs 1.6 enemies for every friend. If you‚Äôre on the other side and I can kill you, I will. If you don‚Äôt deserve it now, you will later.
---
Im obviously talking pvp m8.
---
A FD/Trap macro not working instantly in a reliable way is a big big factor.
---
Int give a bonus to weapon skill ups. Int helps warriors even in the smallest of ways.
---
good luck on the lotus hunt, they seem so scarce on skeram
---
Lol you blocked a gouge at the end ahaha you could tell you were stressing
---
You sure about that?
---
Yeah they favored horde so much they put paladin class in to alliance
---
They definitely will
---
Really? I thought Starbucks was open later than that?
---
Lmfao imagine comparing a video game to killing children
---
Stick with the warrior and start running dungeons. It will be fun as you will run it with a group and you will always find groups easily as your tanking. Only kill mobs lower level than you as a warrioir when soloing otherwise the downtime is unbearable. Also I suggest running either arms or fury spec, you will be able to tank dungeons to 60 regardless of your spec and you may actually do it better with the extra rage generation.
---
i'm so jealous. would be nice to be able to feel again those emotions.
---
enjoy your wow journey man, the first time it's a mega blast! 
---
Join a good populated guild, it's where the fun is!
---
Enchants being invisible buffs is something from vanilla. I am quite sure it did change at some point, but I cannot tell you which patch or if it was in TBC/TBC patch. But it is a very old effect and thus not necessarily a "bug", merely a correct replication of what was in WoW 15 years ago.
---
Thank you for info!
---
They posted the same things for EU realms.
---
Many of these people are expressly saying they want a layer invite to refresh mobs.
---
Since dual spec doesnt exist in classic is there an alternative for prot warriors who want to pvp on the side apart from the obvious thing of splashing gold every time you want to be effective in a bg
---
I'm convinced! Now I can't wait to get home and make my little gnome warlock. Or is there a different race I should go for? Alliance or Horde, doesn't matter.
---
on my server stv is literally tag wars. Bloodscalp trolls, venture co geologists, kurzen medicine men, etc, all spawn camped by 10-20 people at any given time.
---
Tauren
---
Yeah a warlock my level dotted me up and ran when I was questing in un goro and if I nearly died after 10 seconds
---
i was thinking about doing this ... too
---
I have an IRL big black dog, so I know the drill there, hehe.
---
That's one thing I noticed this time around (I'm a healer).  No one seems to know about threat.  Tank runs in?  Time to start nuking!  Then get pissed at me because now I have to heal 4 people instead of 1 primarily.  Thank god for mana pots but FFS, wait 5-10s for the tank to establish aggro, it's not hard!
---
Nice bait
---
If he was saying 1+1=2, sure. In this is honestly an overexageration. Orc passive does nothing into pvp against non-stunners, and into lets say warlock with fear. So hell yeah it's debatable, who's a bigger threat to the CLASS the orc is playing, to a warrior, a ret paladin or a warlock? Debatable
---
Rogue. You'd basically be Batman. Without the money.

I tend not to fuck with people if I don‚Äôt want to be fucked with.  If you gank lowbies they‚Äôre just going to /g or /1 about being ganked and then they‚Äôre going to fuck with you.  If you have business in the area and lowbies are, at a minimum just ignoring me, I tend to do the same.  I‚Äôm not going to tolerate them grabbing flower nodes or quest mobs I need, but generally I don‚Äôt bother lowbies.

Offtanks tank mobs that aren't the boss. For example, there is a boss in Molten Core who has 3 guards with him. The main tank holds the boss, the offtanks hold the guards. The raid kills the guards, then switches to the boss. The offtanks switch to the boss after their mob dies. At that point, the purpose of the offtank is to do damage and build threat on the boss. If the main tank dies, the offtanks take over.

I think having the Theramore Isle flight path should connect them. If you take the Darkshore boat to wetlands and the wetlands boat to Theramore it should be easy enough to do.

---
This feels like a normal conversation compared to Barrens chat
---
Most soldiers don't care about fairness of a fight. They just want to get home. This is a war. I'm not waiting around until the enemy has a fair fight.

I only signed up to gank, not be ganked, that's just unfair.
---
Oh ye I was too, but there is a difference between all the assholes being able to easy jump you, or just the minority. I would have stayed away from STV at all, thought it does seem to 2/3 of all the quests at these level quests
---
Yes, leather is cheap on my server too. I personally just dropped skinning/tailor for mining/engi. I wanted an easy way to make quick $ from launch and skinning was it.
---
But if you really want to be efficient, take the cloth or leather, make items to disenchant, and sell the enchant mats. You‚Äôll easily double or triple your money and sometimes much more. Illusion dust (a very small item range) is going to be the best to go for. There‚Äôs never enough of it due to the limited amount of items that DE into it. Also the essence from the same item level..the name escapes me atm. 
---
That said, all enchant mats are probably going to do well for a while. Maybe not the absolute low level stuff..too much supply with too little demand, but the rest are generally safe bets.
---
Learn how to use the different parts of your auction addon that tells you what your item DE‚Äôs into and the DE value of the item. I used auctioneer forever and it had many different modules that gave profit/loss breakdown. I‚Äôm just not going to be bothered this time around or I‚Äôll end up in the AH all day again.
---
Last thing. You can generally buy up the items people use to level BS, tailoring, and LW, DE them, and make a ton of gold from it. 
---
Best of luck on your gold making adventures!
---
Can confirm.  
---
It's the only way to go about warlock vs warlock, as if you're both full health with voidwalkers up you'd have to start a war of attrition that would last for years.
---
But other stuff gets more expensive as well. So sell it now to buy a cheap item now or keep it for later when a purchase needs to be made
---
Fact. Last night while walking to Scarlet monastery to do cathedral some Tauren horde player was fishing at a  pond (near where stealthed assassins are) 
---
I didn‚Äôt think twice and charged him while my fellow alliance followed pursued. I joined a server of PvP. I will kill all the horde whenever I can. If leveled above me I will group alliance together and band.

I was selling savior delight recepies to ally from lvl 20 till 40. I had bought over 30 recepies for 1g and sold them for 10/12g. I had no issues with gold. I am almost 60 and I almost got enough gold for epic mount.

---
This opened a way to exploit dungeons. Out in the world it is fine and already has a cooldown to prevent excessive layer hopping
---
But the legs and the bow though üëÖ
---
Nah it's not that bad. Farming out the Crests *can* suck but you can either get a few more levels (the elementals are like 37-39) or have a buddy help you.
---
And then Cyclonian himself isn't all that hard. Pick up a Nature Protection potion from the AH or make one if you're an Alchemist, and you can kill him with little issue.
---
Bad hunters yeah. Unless the mage starts at very short range they're easily beat by a hunter thanks to their long-ass range and the mana drain.
---
Fixed it thank you!
---
How do people know about those channels? I‚Äôve never heard of them outside of reddit.

---
I play on a PVP realm (and have played on all realm types including RP) in vanilla. I had a free day on Monday with little chores to do, so I played some hours in the morning and some in the afternoon. I was in Tanaris and STV doing mostly quests with drops, like Zanzil's medicine or the Southsea Bucaneers in Tanaris. As the underrepresented faction, there were always between 3 and 10 players of the opposite faction present trying to get their quest items. Whether they were grouped or not I cannot say.
---
Nothing happens all the while in the morning or early afternoon. Everybody was nice, minding their own stuff. Everybody understood that PVP without any hk counter or reward at all while not at max level is a complete waste of time and inefficient. Nobody did anything. For hours.
---
Then after 16:00 (4pm for imperial heathens) it changed. First a few timid attempts then gank-galore. This confirms a pet theory of mine, which I sum up simply with: When school's out, ganking occurs. Or maybe nowadays it needs to be called Fortnite generation got home. Whatever it is, it's clearly based on time and day. 
---
As a over 40 year old, I fail to see the appeal, but I guess some people have to prove something to someone (themselves?). World pvp was never anything with honor or duty, but mostly just opportunistic cowardice, but I am aware of it and can usually spot it a mile away coming. So is it really better or worse than changing loot rules during an encounter? I don't know, both are being a dick to other players intentionally. And some people are apparently proud of being dicks to other players. To each their own.
---
Wh- how is this even a little bit racist?
---
I‚Äôm on Kirtonos where it‚Äôs 7:3 H:A and am leveling a 31 druid in STV. I didn‚Äôt see a single 45+ horde yesterday but multiple groups of 60 (logged onto my main to corpse camp a group that camped me) of alliance.
---
It is the cooler choice, but for some reason games always make the cooler thing way more useless.
---
Mobs with no loot still give a looting icon and show an empty loot box when you attempt to loot them. They become unclickable if the loot is assigned to someone else in the party for that mob, or if the corpse is already empty.
---
Thanks, that was very helpful, now it makes sense.
---
Preventing gear overlap is kind of a minor optimization, plus as a healer you'll frequently be taking cloth gear for the int bonus anyway. Unless you're planning on doing progression together (and even then), it's not worth working about
---
I get AI and stam buffs a lot as a 20 warlock, so when received I‚Äôll whisper people and tell them to wait and throw a soulstone or a headstone their way. It makes me happy to help out
---
Yeah the fucking ear loot quest. I tried to do it with a 5 man party. The first 10 minutes we were praying the hordes there would ignore us. I get 1 ear. Hordes attack us, we get wiped a couple times. Everyone ragequits.
---
If you aim for going all in on pvp I can see the frustration both ways. I know that rogue is strong with said items, but as you level up and has talents suited for leveling and maximizing damage it is pretty frustrating that you have absolutely 0% chance of beating a mage that is decent.
---
In the clip the rogue managed to engage on every stealth, in reality that almost never happens as the mage can spam arcane explosion rank 1.
---
You do realize why the number 60 is in the name Elgato HD 60 Pro right? Also HDMI maxes 60 unless it‚Äôs an HDMI 2.0 then it maxes at 144. The HD 60 is not 2.0 so in any case it never had more than 60 FPS. I don‚Äôt know what placebo your other games were giving you but the technology is just not there to exceed 60 in any circumstance.
---
So what is your plan to verify if someone is actually trolling or if they're just being brigaded? 
---
Why not just use in game options? /who 60 (or level you need.) And whisper a few people? 
---
LFG or World community chats? 
---
We don't need an outside group finder, just talk to people. My two cents.
---
Arcane Intellect?  Wrong. It provides Intellect to the player which yes directly impacts a weapon skill up. This is the buff my comment is referring to.  Blessing of Wisdom that the meme refers to, Yes that is correct, but I am not talking about that one.

In the future, you have an option in the menu called "stuck". It will do one of two things if pressed: use your hearth if available, or kill you so you end up at a gy where you can Rez (if hearth isn't available).

I am trying to refute this because you have a borderline psychotic obsession with elitist state perfection of leveling dungeons in a 15 year old game.

What did you do for gold farming?
---
In classic you have to 'loot' them first even if they didn't drop anything. It shows an empty loot window. It was like that in OG vanilla also. I always thought it was so other people could not skin your mobs as soon as you kill them without giving you a chance.

That was never in the game. Dishonorable kills we're when you killed quest givers and other npc. They were removed cuz it made raiding cities impossible. You would accidently aoe them and lose a ton of honor
---
Found the PvE'er. Which is fine, just don't try to shame other people when what they do is perfectly natural on a pvp server. You don't need to do it or tolerate it, (and I'm saying this to all people like you in here) rather stop whining on reddit and go out in the world and do something against gankers. Less talking more doing.
---
It's a quest item.
---
Alternative solution: instead of "re-rolling" your warrior, just roll up a Warlock and level that instead for now. Treat your warrior as your "with friends" character and your warlock as your solo character, that way your friends can catch up to your warrior without you being held back.
---
killing someone is about annoying them as much as possible while making it as easy for yourself as possible, i see nothing wrong here
---
why else play on a pvp server
---
People who didn't raid in vanilla will tell you no as evidenced in this thread. you'll have NO issues off tanking anything or even main tanking until end of AQ40
---
`Nathanos's death did not go unnoticed, nor did the fact that a body had never been found. Master` [`Mathias Shaw`](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Mathias_Shaw)`, head of` [`SI:7`](https://wow.gamepedia.com/SI:7) `- the Stormwind intelligence agency - received some disturbing reports of unusual Forsaken activity in the Eastern Plaguelands, and sent five agents to investigate. Only one of those agents returned, babbling incoherently about "Nathanos" and the word "Blightcaller."` **He died in his sleep just days after his return**`, and Alliance adventurers were asked to go investigate their disappearance.`
---
1v5 and the returning one has PTSD... This is the definition of smug.
---
Its not working for me, so obviously its not working for anyone else lol
---
For the mf Horde
---
STEW IT
---
Nothing lol
---
Normally your new character puts up a gray item on the AH for how much money you want to transfer to other side.
---
Then give a friend/lover/spouse/second account the gold to buyout the auction.
---
Voila your lowbie and the nuetral aunction house are both rich.
---
A quick glance at the wowhead loot table doesn't show the darter hatchling, but my (shoddy) memory recalls one dropping for my troll rogue back in the day while farming leathers.  It may have been TBC or wrath.  Said rogue has the hatchling pet currently on retail, suggesting that my memory may be correct.  The tooltip says it's a feralas zone drop.
---
More like, they can't wait to hit 60 and camp low level areas while waiting for BGs to release
---
Constipation
---
Lol thanks for the motivation to gank the next ally I see fishing
---
Yeah, you can just select an area to screenshot by doing this. The program ShareX has a similar feature, but it also instantly uploads the snapshot to imgur and copies the link, it's really useful for that.
---
My girlfriend has a parrot. I have died multiple times because I am fighting in game monsters and one in real life monster
---
Ret is perfectly fine in PvP in classic.
---
Your play time and Lockboxes are irrelevant. This is about locked chests. 
---
I also have a considerable playtime racked up in vanilla wow, vanilla pservers and now classic, but I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have to use that as an argument... I always let the rogue pick the lock and receive the content, and now in classic is the first time I‚Äôve seen people go ape-shit over it. I expect them to share content to players that need them, but monetary gain from locked chests goes to the guy who spent several hours training lockpicking. What‚Äôs the point in training lockpicking if you gain nothing from doing it?
---
Unpopular opinion: Rogues should charge each party member a fee for unlocking a chest and then let the party roll on contents.
---
It blows my mind how quickly people leap to defend abusing layering in this way when a month ago everyone was spitting blood about exactly what is happening now. And I mean in the world; not in instances.
---
They are the same thing. "+10 healing spells" is affected by the spell coefficient even though it is worded poorly.
---
My Paladin's Corrupted Ashbringer says otherwise.
---
That's going to happen anyway, every pvp server except faerlina is horde dominated.
---
I suppose you've been the only druid, huh?
---
Pudge
---
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
---
Then why do we still have to carry a skinning knife?
---
On one hand, I fully expect pvp to happen on pvp servers. On the other hand, I question what went wrong in someone's life to prompt them to run around ganking people 10+ levels lower than they are.
---
It wasn‚Äôt wow but 2 years ago I too spend a grand amount of my 5 star resort beach vacation on an MMO.
---
Tbf I was dragged to a wedding as paying hundreds to be on a beach for a few days is not something I would do.
---
Free alcohol tho I guess.
---
Proto-esports destroyed pvp.
---
Depends on server and time mostly.  My success with it has increased dramatically after the transfer. The well documented spots are still usually occupied, but not all of them. Had free reign over two different spots in Feralas last night, for example.
---
A rogue cannot out damage me or 3 other warriors with a shaman around.
---
and we can all tank.
---
Why would I bring a rogue if not for the utility of that?
---
OP, check out David Arkenstone on Spotify or wherever you use music. 
---
David Arkenstone composes ambient music (sounds of the forest etc.) and he's actually the guy who did all of the music for the Inns throughout WoW Vanilla. He's got an album on spotify called Inns Of Azeroth. 
---
I love playing his own stuff as well as this wow album while I play. Super immersive, very chill. 
---
Also Nightfall In Middle Earth by Blind Guardian is a great one to play in the background.
---
I frankly can't tell if imp or succubus is more beneficial.
---
On one hand the succubus proportedly does more damage, but I haven't notice a difference in speed of mob death or actual numbers on my meter. She also provides a CC, which can be invaluable.
---
On the other hand, my imp doesn't accidentally pull extra shit, especially when that mob turns out to be a caster, and the imp provides me enough health for an extra life tap. Bonus, it doesn't cost a shard.
---
So I'm unsure if drain tanking with a succubus is all that more effective than with an imp.
---
Well the honor system is retroactive i believe so whenever pvp comes out it should still show your total kills
---
Yes, you get discounts based on your reputation level for vendors of that faction. Honored gets you a 10% discount.
---
Yea those are dumb replies.
---
I will usually shout out ‚Äúhorde at wherever‚Äù if I get killed. Haven‚Äôt been met with any nasty replies yet tho luckily.
---
Whole point of a PVP server and Classic in general is that the factions are actually opposing and hostile. High level players of the enemy faction ganking, or killing quest NPC's is all apart of that. Its a huge part of what vanilla was all about, fucking over the other side.
---
Unlike the modern version of the game where horde and alliance have a quasi-friendly relationship that has been developed through the expansions, and a everyone's a winner, safe space  philosophy has been bred. The  original game actually has riverally that is instilled through the extreme hostile actions previously mentioned. So I for one would rather have  all the aforementioned "diskish" behaviour. If you don't may I suggest  a PVE BFA Realm?
---
More specifically. Yes, 10% at honored. I don't think there is any further discounts for revered/exalted, but I would love to be corrected.
---
You can report them. Nothing is stopping you. 
---
If blizzard actually do anything, that's a completely different question. 
---
All in all sounds very petty though.
---
Played druid in vanilla, I don't want to heal so I rolled rogue
---
Too perfect as in accidently cancel stealth and dying to the elites on top cause I didn't have vanish or Sprint ready :D
---
1 quest - 1 level, and people say there are not that many quests , shit you need like only 60 quests like turtle shell to get to lvl 60
---
The guy is cherry-picking.
---
The screenshot he linked is from Zuldazar, and basically none of the other zones even get anywhere close to that level of weather-effects.
---
It's about controlling the population. My server is 70/30 horde/ally and when I'm leveling mining I kill every single horde I see. No mercy.
---
How do I get there?
---
aoe grinding i think is faster for pure xp/hour but it is a bit duller
---
I didn't need to know that you are gay but whatever
---
Ita funny cause I'm such a pushover. If I notice someone even from the opposite faction at a resource I ask them if they need it. Maybe I should be more assertive idk :/
---
Yep, questing in Vietnam is not ez :-D
---
üîîüîîüîî
---
You sound like you‚Äôd really enjoy PvE servers
---
I'm a shit reader and skipped to the TL;DR that didn't mention a warrior at all. My bad.
---
I appreciate the suggestion, thanks
---
Never mind the food/water/potions/cloth/etc that are in the chest.
---
I think it is a zone specific bug. Almost everyone reporting the bug ive seen says it's in tanaris or feralas. It was in feralas for me. I tried disabling all add-ons and that didn't help. 
---
My fishing worked completely fine until Monday night. I fished for 20 minutes in feralas and did not loot a single fish. I skilled up about 10 times. Sometimes I did get a flash of a loot window and also the sound of loot entering your bags, but no fish ever in bags. I tried the same thing Tuesday night and had the same bug.
---
Then I searched this sub Reddit and saw people had posted over one week ago with the same bug happening in Tanaris. One comment even linked a blizzard ticket response telling them that they're aware of an issue and are looking into it.
---
&gt;Very good tips! I will consider it to not spend money on usless skills :)
---
Alright Thank you! I guess I have to consider a lot of things here :D
---
I rarely even notice it. It is mostly just some background noise because very few pieces feel unique.
---
Does that macro work for talking to NPCs and right clicking quest items smart guy??? 
---
/cry
---
Yeah that's what I remember.
---
You can report anyone for anything. The question is wether there will be anything done.
---
Some things are obvious while others, truthfully just depends on what GM you get. They'll make a judgement call so you really never know for sure.
---
I think you meant to post this on r/TheRedPill you fucking idiot.
---
it may be a sound option, not 100% sure though
---
Love it, the egoist man's "I don't know".
---
I'm a fisherman so I agree but I understand if they kill me.
---
Only thing I hate is greykilling, makes no sense to me
---
I'm a druid so I'll send them a tell to make sure they are there and then I'll rez them. No point using a 30 minute CD on someone who isn't gonna accept the rez.
---
I get what you mean, I love being on a pvp server it's great fun, however if someone is being ganked and is asking for help, why dont you go help them? Have you never experienced being 4 man camped? Theres no chance you'll win and it's just infuriating. Even worse is when you get camped by a level??. Yet when you say 1 thing in the general chat asking maybe for someone to help it just "HUR DUR WHY DID YOU PICK A PVP SERVER THEN" like seriously, even if just 1 or 2 people came to help it would make a world of difference, or better yet it would become a brawl of more people which is really fun. Why are people so against going to help someone getting ganked? I always jump to the call.
---
Nah you're a shameful Ally. What would Uther say?
---
Don't forget the random Evasion...
---
Each to their own but I find it hard enough tagging mobs on a pve server never mind being on the lookout for rogues or any class of the opposite faction. It sounds a complete nightmare. I liked the battles we used to have at crossroads back in the day, even on pve, but not all the time.
---
Hillsbrad, desolace, arathi, swamp, dungeons
---
Reread the title out of context bro.
---
The number one complaint people from PvP servers have is getting ganked and camped by someone so much higher level that they uave no realistic way to win that fight. To the point that they have to stop playing entirely.
---
And I did specifically say to go for it if that‚Äôs the kind of gameplay you enjoy. Kind of funny that you‚Äôre so hypersensitive that you accuse me of ‚Äúshitting on other people‚Äôs fun‚Äù when my entire point was that PvP players should stop denigrating everyone else‚Äôs preferred playstyle.
---
This guy eats corpses
---
there was some layering bug which allowed you to get to bosses in the end game dungeons and farm them over and over again
---
&gt; Also, I am really not a fan of a platform where everyone can just claim someone is a troll 
---
Could work fine if it's something a bit more sophisticated than 1 vote = troll.
---
Yeah, I loved the mood of Duskwood. My only grievance is I wish each inn had a different music to fit the area, but I could probably get an addon for that anyways.
---
Your limited anecdotes aren't fact
---
More likely to get Atiesh Greatstaff before that happens honestly
---
\^This, do this guys, makes it way better.
---
Macros my friend, they are saving our druidic lives.
---
What is the best group PvP support class that isn't a paladin? This could mean a class that functions either as a peel to take heat off healers, one that has a lot of CC, or one that helps the DPS/Cleave take out the enemy faction. 
---
So far my list is:
---
Hunter 
---
Rogue 
---
Warlock 
---
Priest 
---
I want something with high survivability/burst resistant (Mages out) .I like a more defensive playstyle of out lasting opponents (warriors out). I know pally is ideally what I want but I'm playing horde. I currently have a 50 Shaman that I'm taking my time leveling but will be power leveling whatever my PvP alt is.
---
And the lovely pat that changes direction for 3s just before the 2 giants to make you feel safe but in fact you are already dead... Just great
---
I think I already tried different settings there, but I will definitely take a look at it again. Thanks.
---
It was in the context of that time.
---
The old days of MMOs are far gone.
---
We compare Classic to retail now and the like, which are just horrible. 
---
Different people have different opinions, but I prefer pre-wow games. That community is gone though.
---
Classic is better than modern games imo, but isn't as good as the SWG and so forth. This is all subjective.
---
Idk man. I leveled to 60 quickly only to discover my server is 30% alliance. I really don't want to play anymore because trying to just farm any mats has been hell. Since the heavy layering went away the game has been awful. I really want to just be on a pve server but I don't want to leave all my efforts behind.
---
Yes. I love that it can randomize now too.
---
Not sure what these people are smoking in this thread, lol.
---
If you haven't yet. Shimmering Flats in Thousand Needles has a few quests. While you are down there, you can get the gadgetzan FP for later.
---
This is the worst rogue I've ever seen.  Sincerely, a rogue.
---
Mind-Numbing poison would also have been awesome.
---
Still 75 mana.
---
Its a mess because you say that you do not care about the facts i tell you and then you proceed to insert your anecdotal experience as if it somehow means more. Also, your eample of League is of false equivalency since pvp is all you do in that game, you cannot ignore it in favor of something else like which is what im telling you happened on retail.
---
Sure, you have people pvping now because its fun. I do too, classic is a better game than retail. However, what do you think will happen if honor system never releases? It would get stale and the amount of people actively engaging in PvP would get gradually lower.
---
could this strat be viable for pvp rank 14 ?
---
oh ok, thanks!
---
varimathras IS a dreadlord that was a double agent for the burning legion during classic and i think left undercity TBC or wrath maybe? he might be there in undercity rn tbh i wouldn't know tho. but go to the banshee queens throne room in undercity he's probably there lol
---
fun fact the burning legion in Legion expansion when we went to argus, had literally tortured him so hard for what he had done that he was repulsive and missing limbs and skin and stuff and we had to kill him on argus :)
---
I love this actually, but i can still get destroyed by newly grayed out mobs if i get overwhelmed. Needed the emerald in boulderlode mine for Miner's Fortune, meh mostly gray now i'll just waltz in there like i'm playing retail and kill everything quick till i get the drop /record scratch moment, dead, this ain't retail son!!! 
---
So yea second one is more of challenge. lol
---
Ratchet not connected by flight?
---
Yeah, I should probably include that dps as a shaman in a raid environment is stupid, you're much more useful to the group as a healer.
---
But yes in dungeons or PvP they hit like a goddamn truck.
---
I'm not sure it it's unique to me, but it seems as though I have to spam the first macro to get it to work. Hitting it once says I need to have a dagger equipped, then hitting again switches my dagger to my mainhand, pickpockets, ambushes, and switches my dagger back to my offhand.
---
Have you had that issue?
---
Watch the fucking intro video lol. War has ended 4 years ago after the battle of Mount Hyjal in WC3 Reign of Chaos.
---
&gt; I didn't want to kill lowbies...you MADE me do that.
---
I was very tempted to do the same in The Barrens as an lvl 18 Alliance warlock.
---
Like I get it, I'm your arch-enemy for a reason I don't know but attacking me while I'm very busy finishing a quest is still an dick move.
---
What do you base the fee on? Pay and roll before or after the chest is unlocked?
---
uhm Knaifu was life.
---
Cross realm baby - queues will be the same across servers.
---
Nah i think it's valid. I specced frost and started aoe grinding through the 20s and 30s and i regret it. 
---
When op asks "**Is it worth AOE lvling/farming as a Mage right now?"** my opinion is no because the servers are vibrate and alive right now and I think its best to experience that while you can because it is objectively temporary. You can always start another character or respec and aoe your heart out by yourself and it'll be the same experience if not better because there will be less competition if xp/ph or gold is your goal. 
---
I'm still frost but so far my favourite experience has been running around in the chaos that is STV and grouping up with randoms to hunt down allys. I would never have even gone there if i continued to aoe grind and I guarantee that place wont be anywhere near as chaotic a couple months from now. 
---
Also personal opinion - like 90% of mages are frost / aoe specced right now - I like it when i see someone who isnt. 
---
Your analogy would work if they asked "Is aoe leveling/ farming efficient as a mage right now?" - but they didnt so your analogy is wrong.
---
"Priest" xxDD
---
I guess since you‚Äôre leveling as prot, you wouldnt mind the additional challenge of skipping 10 levels of skills. Lol.
---
Where have you heard this, do you have a source?
---
Haven‚Äôt tried classic on Linux. How‚Äôs it run?
---
Specialized groups can run WC in 20 mins. 
---
Spellcleave can clear literally all SM dungeons in 15 mins.
---
Human paladin level 28. Specced ret for levelling. Would I need to respec as prot for tanking in dungeons eg Stockades at this point? Or can I just rely on particular gear and strategy?
---
You might have missed it but this sub is very judgemental about people wanting to level up fast which is pretty annoying.
---
They all look innocent until they have two friends around and you have 2 mobs on you.
---
If you dont like the pvp aspect dont play on a pvp server or dont flag for pvp.on a pve server
---
Pleasure
---
Alliance camping quest givers. Feels like alliance is always ahead and OP. üò¢
---
otherwise there would be a lot more viable speces4!!4!
---
That is some bullshit. A GM needs to take this more seriously. It sucks you lots out on the legs after farming all the resources.
---
You could post the same thread word for word every day and get a different response. I didn't see your thread yesterday, but I would have responded along with some others in the thread that joining a group to change layers is not against the rules and they have taken no action against anyone, and have never suggested they will.
---
Beeg chungus
---
I've run dungeons with two balance druids so far. So they're out there!
---
Yeah no need to reinvent the wheel! And youd need to probably pipe a list of all item names into api calls for that to create the data you want!
---
Yeah no setting up a server, i was just suggesting if somebody just had the sql from that lying around
---
It's called the circle of hate.  It drove me to make a rogue, and gank mercilessly in 2007.
---
We have a 30min cd battle rez
---
&gt;you only roll on gear for the role you are filling.
---
Its perfectly fine for a resto druid tanking a dungeon to roll on healing gear.
---
Agreed! I just made macros for the common stuff, like:
---
    /stand
---
    /use blue mechanostrider
---
This lets me mount from sitting.
---
And I'm so confused
---
*at
---
The post even started based on a robe from fucking SFK so obviously we're not talking about 60. 
---
&gt;Now I'm starting to think you didn't play vanilla if you think a hunter can roll on leather and not be put onto the blacklist of every other person in the dungeon.
---
If you're blacklisted as a hunter rolling on leather in leveling dungeons, well maybe your groups/server are terrible. Nobody would fucking guilt a hunter at 48 for rolling on some awesome +agi leather pieces.
---
But I'm done here. There's no point to further discussion. You do you.
---
This is not my image, i saw this on discord, but since nobody has posted it i figured i'd do it. 
---
If this is correct then as the image suggests enchants are a dps loss and there are several buffs you dont even want on your character to not ruin your equip bonuses.
---
This has to be a reference to J. Allen Brack?
---
Actually i respect that you don't agree with me, but you stating its 'flawed logic' is just simply your opinion as opposed to mine. I can easily just say the same thing about any of your opinions and it gets us nowhere.
---
I never said hunter pet isn't crucial, you keep ignoring certain points i put across, I said the time investment of SEARCHING FOR NEW PETS isn't crucial. You can just use the same shitty owl/saber starter zones throughout the game.
---
Typical alliance tbh
---
idk exactly - I haven't played rogue for a few servers now. The exact numbers will always shift slightly depending on your gear at the moment though. Pulling up the old spreadsheet I used has a little table at the bottom showing weights relative to each other. Here is what mine said last I used it (for t2.5 combat daggers)
---
1Hit = 0.688 Crit ; 8.748 Agility ; 15.586 AP
---
1Crit = 1.453 Hit ; 12.709 Agility ; 22.643 AP
---
1 Agility = 1.782 AP
---
take it with a grain of salt though. If you're really concerned about truly min maxing it, I would find the current rogue discord and see if they have an updated spreadsheet to plug in all of your gear options. General stat weights are never going to be 100% accurate
---
Pvp talk in general chat is almost always how big epic pvp battles happen. Possibly the most fun you can have on a pvp server while leveling. I don't know why anyone would actively try to discourage this, but I have been seeing it a lot too.
---
I get your point but I consider it a professional courtesy among fellow Anglers. I think typically anyone who considers themselves a true PvPer has standards and lives by a moral code.
---
Hey man thank you for putting the effort in but a lot of People Play classic in order to avoid using LFG Tools when there is an ingame Chat everyone can read.
---
I really appreciate the work but I don't know a single Person that would want to use this..
---
I mean, it is a novel concept, and I get that, but my point was that - hey, if you're begging for a tank, but are capable of doing so yourself, you're right, tanks are in higher demand I could be helping another group. (dungeon leveling DPS tanking is totally viable as long as your at the right level anyway)
---
Right click on the general tab and go to global channels
---
Welcome to druids. We didn't have a druid for our first MC clear so we dusted 7 pieces of druid loot
---
I would be curious as well. I've been told different answers but can't remember the real reason besides at 60 cause raiding. But I've heard at 40, at 48 or 58-59 lol
---
who cares, everyone's gonna see it all the same except for the 4 people who left localdefense
---
I didn't touch a bow until level 24 ü§∑
---
Its not even close to accurate.
---
I'll usually stop off with a /No and see if that works. If it doesn't it's free game in my opinion (principally as it is to begin with of course).
---
You sound like a bully.
---
Bro for leveling mages are the most sought after class in dungeons. Raid though are going to be a different story I fear, shouldnt be too much of a problem.
---
You already have most, if not all, healing specs available on any spec.
---
Respeccing would just make it easier, but would severly impact your ability to quest by yourself.
---
Respec to heal when you are 60, not before. Just try to gather some +healing gear and spirit on the side to make your life easier healing in dungeons
---
hahahaha how quirky and interesting you must be
---
Hunters man...... and aoe mages.
---
People assumed it would be the same. Yeah it‚Äôs confusing. Lots of classic guides are inaccurate because of this.
---
News flash bud, this is not a pure classic experience, STOP fooling yourself, devs already have involved class changes, layering, increased server size, they don't even have the same damage numbers, this is all an emulation of classic wow.
---
I like to put psychic scream up and fear mobs other people are AOE grinding. At worst it just makes them more annoying and slower to kill when they scatter, at best in a crowded area they run around and draw Aggro and the mage gets killed.
---
bruh I thought this was first try!
---
I'll be skilling fishing after I reach lvl 60 if they not gonna fix it then its better not do this quest until I get 225 skill?
---
What's better is when your grinding a quest drop and for some reason the last two won't drop. Then later you realize the drop looks just like herbs (I'm an herbalist) and you put those two in your bank.
---
I always play on PvP servers, however I never assault enemy fighting someone not of my faction. I challenge him, wait till he finishes and then we clash for the honor of our factions. You can call it protection of recourses or whatever. I call it cowardness worthy of some wrenched forsaken, but not an orc who fight for honor and glory.
---
yeah STV to heavy for me
---
No feesh? How can you say no to this? 
---

This isnt a recurring incident or anything.  I think ive only been camped 3 times since launch. Like i said, i just go for a walk and cone back later, they usually get bored.  I know how big the rez circle it, being a warrior, i don't have any evasive abilities like sprint, blink, cheetah, or travel form,  so im usually a casualty to my lack of speed. Which is why i just afk at my corpse till they get bored.  Its not a big deal.
---
r/TIHI
---
Unless you do any of the Alliance quest chain, where the writing/story telling is a lot better. If you watch the making of docs the Horde where barely finished in time at release, they pretty much just threw all of that content together compared to how meticulous the alliance quests were crafted.
---
Horde/Alliance both have dungeons as strongholds near main cities or hubs. 
---
The horde are a war fairing faction so it makes sense they would have a bigger presence in most of the contested zones. If you read any of the wiki pages they often note the Hordes ability to stay around even in the face of the Alliance.
---
I don't think it was 'very clearly' that the devs favored the horde, if you follow the actual develop you'll realize they actually put more time and effort into all things Alliance. Horde lean PvP (talents/racials) and Alliance lean PvE which is exaggerated on a PvP server. 
---
Alliance don't have that annoying MC quest chain either.
---
At low levels yes but end game over rogues often top DPS charts.  You're talking out your ass bud sorry
---
I hope someone breaks your neck so you get to play wow with a pen in your mouth.
---
Technically it does, just at a very low rate
---
At 60. Have done both raids and every dungeon except WC (ally) and ST. Haven‚Äôt seen a single boomkin.
---
That‚Äôs a requirement not a reward.
---
Pretty sure they can only see characters that are logged in.
---
The nights are all long, I'm singing this song
---
Try /reload
---
Probably because it‚Äôs an elite named mob and they know the horde do need to kill it.
---
Same shit with the eggs in Barrens.
---
Yep, we're toxic. now gtfo.
---
Generous of you to proclaim that they have one.
---
What should you do once you hit 60, have a few BiS items, and are in between dungeon runs/LFG? Is there anything you can do to really impact your power-level or a "most efficient" use of time?
---
I'm thinking:

- Grind some mobs for Reputation (Timbermaw/AG, but not really important right this second if you don't need the crafting recipes)
---
- Do level 60 quests you missed for some gold / rep (but, the traveling time and tiny rep with your own faction might not make it worth it).
---
- Farm a rare mob/drop spawn? (Probably not very efficient use of time).
---
Sometimes you've got a good bit of time before you can get a full group going for the dungeon you need. What is the best/your go-to way to spend it?
---
Especially in Ashenvile.  That place is the STV for alliance.  So many little children bullies ganking.
---
It wants him 30 so the next set of quests will be green mobs likely. You generally want to be fighting green mobs as they‚Äôre much easier to kill.
---
I love this Thrall model, he is the one and only Thrall
---
Yeah I have a shield and a 1h axe that I use pretty much only for the last 2 bosses. 
---
For everything else, battle stance, charge, thunderclap, bloodrage, defensive stance, battle shout, demo shout, sunder armor, tab, sunder armor, tab, revenge (if procced) or sunder armor if rage is available, then, maybe cleave, maybe sweeping strikes, maybe whirlwind, hope for a ravager proc, keep tab-targeting+sunder. If a warrior/rogue/pally/hunter pet pulls aggro, I‚Äôll add a few extra sunders but typically won‚Äôt worry about unless they complain (at which point I‚Äôll kindly explain threat mgmt, and they can decide if they really want to get hit or not - it‚Äôs up to them), and if a mage or a spriest or a warlock pulls aggro I‚Äôll taunt off and add a few sunders, and if the healer pulls one off me I‚Äôll use mocking strike, but healers are typically the very least of my problems. 
---
The only wipes I‚Äôve had after lvl 25 are when we are running with someone who‚Äôs way too high lvl for the dungeon for some reason and they‚Äôre over estimating how much they‚Äôre adding to the group.
---
It's a good estimate.  Way better than the 40% number lol
---
You can heal as shadow at 60 if you really want to, but you probably want to look at switching late 50's when you start consistently grinding BRD/LBRS
---
I do it as often as I can
---
Except its not?  
---
You seem to have this concept that druids can produce massive ST threat in raids vs what a Warrior produces, which isn't quite true, as while boss tanking warriors will have enough rage to HS every MH swing, and spam sunder, its the initial grab that is the only time boss tanking that warriors have an issue.
---
Can you give examples of where a druid tank outshines a warrior in classic raids? I have yet to find them
---
Have you been to the yeti cave? One way in, one way out. Two players enter, one player leaves.
---
What an absolute champ
---
You should be able to tank in Ret! Just keep a Shield and 1H around. You'll want to stock up on drinks (or have a mage) though, since you will be spamming consecration on cd. :)
---
I broke my shoulder for WoW classic. Well, technically I got in a motorcycle accident and was required to take 2 weeks off work, but I like to think I was lucky breaking it right on release week. 
---
That being said I feel like a complete scrub playing with one hand and clicking all my abilities. On the other hand that is how I first played so, authentic????
---
Elemental Shaman bb.
---
Oh cry me a river. There's PVE servers over there.
---
This is how bad it gets. Can't even have a discussion.
---
They should be patting the original developers on the back, imagine creating a game and after 15 years of development from other people your original game is still way better? That has to be the biggest compliment a game developer can ever get.
---
Barrens is to 25 in classic, so even better. Then it's a short walk to Stonetalon or Thousand Needles, or Ashenvale, followed by Desolace, Tanaris, then Felwood or Un'goro, and finally Silithus. Horde has a simple, straightforward path never needing to leave Kalimdor, from 0-60.
---
It's a circle of hate. My friend has been an honorable guy through all of original wow and the 30 levels we got on a private server but he finally snapped one night and turned into a monster.
---
He was running to kargath for the first time but suddenly I heard him cackling like a madman as he laid waste do the inhabitants of duskwood.
---
Warlock, ez
---
Remember when you actually had to "speak" to NPC's to interact with them? Ultima Online made you say "vendor buy" so they opened their menu because the devs wanted you to actually speak in sentences to them for RP reasons. Whenever I right-click on an NPC I can just imagine my character poking them in the arm for attention.
---
I started my journey with Classic WoW
---
but had to realize the emptiness in my heart caused by the server shutdown of wildstar could not be filled again.
---
We asked for a nonchanged vanilla wow. 
---
We got what we asked for and now you come along saying "ohh it's a nice game but could be better" 
---
Go and ask blizz for a different wow maybe they will listen to you too. But let us Play what WE asked for and what WE want. The world is not revolving around you.
---
I'm up for additions AFTER classic is done. Like an addon. But I don't want fcking Achievements in my game no barber shop or else I would go and Play retail.
---
This is a Topic for /r/classicwowplus
---
Have fun discussion it there
---
THANK YOU
---
If they do classic+ the first thing I want is lvl 60 karazhan raid.
---
I will gank lowbies once, but I will never touch a fisherman unless he attacked me for the spot.
---
I dont see any mention of a confirmed autoloot bug but rather quite the opposite. Care to elaborate?
---
I still find it unnecessary unless you're 60 where the level advantage stops.
---
I see many people confused about what is ok with layering and what's not. Like the thread about bans the other day. Bans were towards dungeon and raid exploiting but people thought that open world is exploiting too. I eish they could read.
---
When's the last time you saw a wolf skin something?
---
If they're just trying to level same as me they're left alone.
---
If they gank I make sure to corpse camp the everliving shit out of them.
---
I dualbox and had a gnome mage ganking people outside booty bay yesterday, after a couple of deaths he decided to just sit by the guards. I sacrificed one of my characters to draw aggro from the guards and killed him with the other, repeatedly.
---
The joy of realizing he logged out was unfathomable, death to ganking scum.
---
It‚Äôs a mob called Teremus the Devourer, he‚Äôs a rare elite that spawns and patrols an area in the Blasted Lands. He, like most mobs in classic, has no hard leash range, but instead stays in combat so long as he‚Äôs being attacked. He‚Äôs a massive pest because he has a flame breath attack with a very large area of effect that also heals him proportionally to the number of targets he hits with said breath. He has a tendency to live for multiple days at a time if not actively focused by higher level players or kited to Bolvar (even that doesn‚Äôt always go Bolvar‚Äôs way.)
---
so as a 60 resto druid, if i need to grind/kill mobs solo end game.  Is it better to bring feral gear and go cat, or spam balance spells?
---
That's so much help, thanks a lot mate. 
---
Will definitely have to get used to properly aggroing things rather than just the giga-threat you get from tanking in the later expansions I've played.
---
I always try to buff everyone I meet on the road, but sometimes I'm not paying attention to the game when running, and I miss the opportunity to buff someone back. So no hard feelings, will try to buff you next time I meet you!
---
the only thing you earn now is the satisfaction of killing someone else
---
Yeah, I have a lot of +int gear for healing, been healing a lot, but would like to see if I can tank as well though. What gear would you recommend for tanking? I presume stamina.
---
Honestly, the answer is Troll. Berserking &gt; blood fury for both quick threat generation and not getting you killed. Axe spec is great, but none of the top shelf tank weapons are axes. War Stomp is good but the most important fights are against stun-resistant mobs.
---
I killed 300-400 pirates with a group and saw it drop twice but did not get it myself. So yeah it exists but the drop rate is very low.
---
Ashbringer, pvp
---
I mean, the furbolgs speak.
---
**yeet\***
---
Yup our guild made the switch to Firemaw from Shazz because blizz specifically suggested people do exactly that. Launch night was too late to organise a 2nd switch
---
I demand some videos of this. DEMAND!
---
Oh shit yeah you triggered lol.
---
coffee break my man
---
Play whatever one you like to level 20, im actually struggling with the same problem however i was leveling my druid to 20 and realized it wasnt for me( didnt like not seeing my gear). 20 gives you the best feel for what a class is like. If you dont come back to it after that then its not for you!
---
This brings up a good point. Why bother healing them, when you can just Rez them afterwards?It‚Äôs easier for you, will be appreciated more (how many times do you get surprise rezzed), and you can laugh about it afterwards.
---
&gt;but I guess the main question is, how do you cope with this kind of long-lasting frustration in this game? What do you do to help remind yourself that it is worth it to keep going despite how the in-game community can be?
---
This kind of mentality and behaviour is ever-present, not just in this game, but everywhere (real life). It's also really frustrating to me to go through similar situations than the ones you had (and I've had plenty), but there's not much you can do it except avoid having it affect you too much. I know it's basically non-advice, but there's really not much you can do about it. There's basically no accountability for this kind of behaviour.
---
Again, I understand you very well. I'm also bothered by how some people act sometimes, but that's their own selfish behaviour. Their problem.
---
I know.
---
There's no discussion. No changes. Gtfo.
---
\*Target is too low level\*  
---
Rest in peace valiant warrior, rest in peace.
---
Yes it does and makes sense. It‚Äôs just that we benefit more from might (or king at a certain level/gear)
---
Not sure I understand the ppl who say they don‚Äôt have a problem. Press feign death and notice it isn‚Äôt instant. Press arcane shot it is instant. I mean just compare how long 1 spell takes to trigger vs howling feign takes to trigger and it‚Äôs obv
---
If you're just whining about pvp I can understand this. I doubt they say it once and never again. Yeah, pvp can be rough while leveling. Toughen up and turn the whine into asking to murder them back or just warn people. Noone enjoys people whining about something that is happening to everyone. 
---
Also will always complain about pvp being whined about if it's in lfg.
---
Time to go farming disgusting oozeling again.
---
It might be fixed in this patch though.
---
Just the fun of it currently.
---
go tank SM Cath for a few levels and you'll get all your gold. I was making so much money from vendoring greens/blues/ah cloth.
---
Tell groups you'll tank if you can need greens for mount. Some say no some say yes.
---
Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 4 laifff!!!!
---
I had those buff on my warrior all the time, but to be fair I ve noticed I had them much more often when I was walking around with a staff...
---
You are out of your depth here, smooth brain. You yourself bring up League as an example and now you dismiss it. Hilarious. If there is no reward for doing something, people will do it less. That's basic human psychology.
---
Let me give you a homework, wait until phase 2 when honor system releases and then try to assess whether there are more people engaging in pvp. Im fucking positive there will be. You yourself know that there will and with that your point is bullshit. People do something more when they are rewarded.
---
True, this was just one experience I had where 1 mage got lucky about 5 times in a row.
---
There is one reason and only one reason they say that. They understand that they are tilted and they want them to get tilted even more.
---
If I level my bank character to 5 and grab enchanting, can he disenchant any item regardless of item level?
---
Asking here seems easier than googling it and potentially getting the wrong answer from a weird private server, excuse the laziness!
---
what ? Lol u asked what they were called and he explained
---
Three hordes walk into a bar..
---
The warrior I have been levelling with does not appreciate PvP like I do
---
I usually do it, but I did Rez a guy that was a little low level for the zone we were in and mobs immediately rushed him and killed him again before I could get a heal off... I just kind of walked away after that.
---
2nd image is incorrect, proper explanation as we confirmed yesterday is:
---
‚Ä¢ Max 32 buffs
---
‚Ä¢ Stances count
---
‚Ä¢ Talents don't count
---
‚Ä¢ Equip effects don't count
---
‚Ä¢ Set bonuses don't count
---
‚Ä¢ Gear enchants count with exceptions:
---
  ‚ó¶ Sharpening stones don't count
---
  ‚ó¶ Damage scope doesn't count
---
  ‚ó¶ Crusader enchant doesn't count
---
  ‚ó¶ Resistance enchants don't count
---
And people want layers completely removed... Imagine how bad it would be without them.
---
Adds 2 combo points, puts blink on CD, doesn't DR kidney shot.
---
To enjoy barbies fucking wonderland where people hold hands all the time. Or at least that's what most people in here seem to want, lol. Good that there's an option that sounds almost exactly like pvp
---
Dual wield is fine on lower level mobs mostly from the insane rage gen. Equal level or higher I always switch to 2 hand for sure even as my fury spec
---
Until you forget where the quest giver was (unless your one of those people using a quest helper add-on)
---
Ah thanks, yeah I don't have Consecration on my build unfortunately.
---
Not true. During BC I was playing in alliance - no queues. At LK I started horde but I had 45+ min queues. Then I switched mid expac for alliance - again no queues. 
---
One of the many reasons I'm never going back to horde.
---
Jokes on you, I did the first couple quests then came back to stv at 40 with a mount and slaughtered any horde who tagged my mobs
---
Each thing you need to kill has an area of high density. If you work around the flats you‚Äôll see what I mean. I believe the turtles are most common around a washed up shit to the north.
---
Can confirm Ivey veins and wowheads guides are generally garbage but are an ‚Äúokay‚Äù start for absolute noob gameplay.
---
I... know? That they need to wipe. Then, presumably, give you a reward, after somehow needing 15 pieces of cloth. There are implications here.
---
Most people aren't going to want any changes when they haven't even fully experienced the game yet. Come back in a year and people will be more open to discussion.
---
Yes, level 1 enchanting can disenchant everything.
---
When I started doing GY over the weekend and had no clue about rares or gear drops, we killed several rares until a drop caught my eye....which I lost on the roll.
---
At that moment I researched the GY and read about all the rare spawns and have run it several times since and of course, never have seen a rare now that I am looking for rares.
---
Honestly, just don‚Äôt play anymore.  If others being selfish is effecting you that much, is it worth the $15 a month to just be pissed off playing a game?
---
/r/wooooooosh
---
I went herbalism and skinning, droped skinning at lvl 40. most of leather just sold to vendor, it have basicly paid for my skill learning + extra. and in place of skinnning learned alchemy. all the herbs i collected i sended to alt bank acc and when grabed alchemy i lvled it up very fast since i got all mats. the rest of mats that i didnt need anymore i sold for $$. 
---
Im not sure if i will stick with alchemy and herb thou its verry good for lvling and in endgame i can make good money, but since im more pvp guy i will probably go eng at lvl 60. maybe will leave alchemy if i can make money. enough to buy supplys for eng.
---
Better flight points? Really?
---
Lol wtf just play retail
---
I used to play undead mage in vanilla, now I play gnome mage.
---
Wotf is so much better. I dearly miss it in pvp.
---
Nope; I've seen a few people either die in front of me, or a corpse, and resurrected them.
---
No points or multiplier from the 360? Harsh game
---
Don't wear as human. Not worth it, sell them.
---
Kirtonos is really bad too but oh well I get to make my own underdog story rallying against the endless horde
---
For off tanking, druids are actually better than Warriors. Druids can switch to cat and do more dmg than a protein Warrior with a 2H. Druids hold secondary threat better because they can generate more threat while not being hit by the boss when compared to warriors. They can also shift out to heal, cure poison, de curse, and innervate. Generally they just provide way more utility
---
There is definitely a greed mentality out there that I'm finding unfavorable. I've run into it more so on the Horde side than I did on Alliance side. When I first started Classic, a friend brought me to Pagle on Alliance. Everyone was awesome, and people didn't seem terribly greedy or selfish. I got to about level 19 or something, and my friend told me he was moving to Ashkandi/Horde to group up with the rest of our friends (who we didn't know were even playing).
---
So we moved. I made a shaman and all was good until I hit the Barrens, where I began to run into a lot of the behavior you describe. Specifically around Thorn Hill and that Kreenig Snarlsnout quest. No one was respecting any type of queue for the boss (which was on a 10 minute respawn), and my group and I spent almost an hour waiting for "our turn," only to be beaten by some moonfire-spamming druid from out of nowhere.
---
It's frustrating, but all you can do is move on. Whenever I encounter this type of greedy behavior, I make an alt and level them up for a bit. Then I hope that the next time I log in on my main, that area has cleared up and I can get on with my life. Or I'll take a break and do a puzzle with my girlfriend. Anything to get my mind off of the heartbreak that the game I love is causing me with the caliber of player playing it.
---
I had the same problem as yours. I did instances 3 or 4 days in a raw. It's way less frustrating!
---
What was changed? Inb4 layering.
---
I think its the initial grind to 60. Im feeling that everyday now as more people get 60 everyone is getting more feisty and less likely to ignore enemy players, on their 60 mains and on their low level alts.
---
Just make a channel tab for the channels that you dont want to see constantly?
---
I kept it until 60 to finish some of the quests I need. I didn't do fordring questline though and kinda dreading doing it in holy now, but eh what can you do.
---
Healing dungeons only gets harsh if you group with lvl 60's that want to go zoom zoom and you can't keep up with them mana/efficiency wise, until then you should be just fine.
---
Yes enhancers can disenchant any item regardless of their enchanting level. And you‚Äôre also correct they‚Äôll need to be level 5 to learn professions
---
That would be why I included this:
---
&gt;Healing power may need to be reduced somewhat to compensate
---
WOW
---
Who care ? If it's funny where is the problem ?
---
cat: energy  
---
bear: rage 
---
every other form: mana
---
Honestly a Druid can use either buff so I'm always happy when I get a buff.
---
He's the perfect bait for your ambush though! I strongly recommend looking up a guide.
---
Same! It‚Äôs an amazing piece of display!
---
My initial question was based on curiosity. I found your snide reply unwarranted and quite off-putting though.
---
He is still dead, he just becomes a transparent human.
---
Boufa dees
---
plz dont say the R word
---
Boo this rogue!
---
That was how debuffs worked in vanilla. Hence the Mind Vision strat for Vael and the stupid oozling strat on C'thun.
---
Gz!
---
You happen to play Horde on Benediction? Haha. Not saying this happened, just interested in bolstering guild numbers and more than happy to take on an outcast, were full of them :)
---
Only in groups will I ask for food but as a holy pally I always appreciate it. Sometimes in groups I ask for 100 or so to keep me through the rest of the day. I did have a mage get right pissed at me for asking for ‚Äútoo much‚Äù before a princess run yesterday though.
---
I agree with this guy, GTFO. Why would we have a discussion after being called pathetic and childish?
---
I got stuck the other day and was trying / stuck and /unstuck. I swear one of those commands used to work. It did nothing and just said invalid command etc.
---
I hear you. Feeling sick of people watching me die, when I am constantly helping out. Can't heal as a hunter but I will try my damndest to save people.
---
Trigged as fuck
---
Thanks for the update! want me to take down the post?
---
Alas, this is the way of the trackpad.
---
Judging by his armor, it looks like he's salty he's run SM so many times but hasn't gotten the axe. Tabard, helm, shoulders, etc. But he's saying FUCK the axe because he got a mother fuckin' wolf in this bitch now.
---
I didn't even notice it much to be honest. Killing mobs takes long no matter if I have level 2 or level 3 sunder armor or if my demo shout does a 63 AP reduction debuff to mobs instead of 77 or whatever it was. I did learn some important new skills however, like challenging shout.
---
you will be fine if you keep up your professions as you level. If you see ore that you can mine, then go mine it. My gf and i both rolled skinning and mining and have the gold needed already for our mounts at lvl 36. Just keep up your professions as you level.
---
I understand, that REALLY sucks. My experience is that on PvE realm, more mature, and friendlier players are playing. I'm having a blast on my server, i'm level 37 now, and never did experience something like this. Everyone talk to you, and you get invites. I hope you can still switch, i know there goes a lot of time in leveling.. But it's so much better! :-) Good luck, and i hope you can make yourself to play again soon!
---
Same!
---
How do you connect your PC charger? I have a van and wanna do the same when I travel!
---
Oh dang I've played a long time and never knew this
---
If you want to have your mount right at 40 and also not do professions you can go without a good amount of the skills and still get your mount at 40.
---
This is legit from my time playing in classic and what guilds were doing. However, I dont know any websites that actually have simulated numbers for 1.12 websites, so if my info is bad I'd like to know an updated source myself. I should have stated mine as anecdotal.
---
Easier yes but you also have a beautifully (or crudely) modeled representation of your surroundings on the screen, its worth learning to use that.
---
did you inform them that they're trash?
---
perhaps they just didn't realize
---
And mount.  Oh well, I still like to flex and jump onto the water from the boat to booty bay and beat all the Horde to the FP.
---
Looks like a Bichon Havanais to me.
---
The worst bit is it costs about 10% of my mana (I'm sure someone will correct me) to go back into it after üò≠
---
We did the same in the elite ogre area in STV a few days back. 3 of us were making our way through the cave to the boss ogre, and 2 hordies were doing the same. When we got there, they tagged the boss. We helped them kill the ads, and when boss was about half hp, we killed them and took the tag.
---
Felt great :D
---
How much work would it take to turn this into a "Book of Grudges"? ATM I just put people on ignore who piss me off while I'm levelling, in the hope that they fail to get my attention when they are looking for a Tank in future. However, I'd like there to be a way of keeping track of why I added them to the list, like that Warlock that kept banishing my quest mob (the rock elementals in badlands)
---
I spent fucking months grinding fire ress gear to even have a guild look at my application in vanilla.
---
Now days they face roll it with a bunch of mages.
---
What happened back in day in vanilla is not what happens today. People git 2 guud.
---
I saw a guy yesterday multiboxing with 4, so I feel like it should be okay.
---
I remember the last time I had a Taikuri. I was on the toilet for hours the day after.
---
It was done in vanilla as well. Mainly for the gear
---
Vir'jin
---
Keep introducing him to single girls until one sticks. That will seriously cut into his gaming time.
---
Vet them first to make sure none are also WoW players, because obviously that would be a disaster.
---
Fair enough, but aren't those very very niche items? A guild with a certain tier on farm will give one pattern to one trusted smither and that's it.   
---
My question is more: what is the real world utility for all the rest of armorsmithers?
---
Rerolled on another server, decided this toon wouldn't run to 60.  Another druid.
---
Fishings max, happen to be in westfall and just ding 20.  Figured since I'm that close I might as well do a death run down to BB and buy the book to increase fishing past 150.  Going smooth, only died once to early tigers, about half way through a very clearly lvl 60 druid as well (in tier gear and probably a healer) god kitty stealth in front of me.  Kills me (lvl20) then proceeds to try and corpse camp me so I can't make the run.  
---
So dude ignores both the "Druid Code" and also ganks 40 levels lower repeatedly.  
---
Hoping once I'm 60 this random guy can be found a few times for my cold revenge.  We will see.  Or I might just forget about it entirely by then too as I'm doing the nostalgic slow level this time haha.
---
I hit 60 last night running dungeons with world chat groups pretty much all the way from level 20. I normally start my own group and have unfortunately turned down dozens of resto druids over their lack of a spammable res. I feel kinda bad cause I'm the kind of guy that's all for class diversity, but in a lot of instances that run back can be seriously brutal.
---
I confused this post with another one written by a lvl 10 horde shaman lol

Cleave is by definition a cone, there are no AOE cleaves.

^ There is a big difference between "theres like 6 horde at nessey does anyone wanna group up and clear it out?" and "ZOMG GANKED AGAIN FUCK HORDE BUNCH OF NOLIFE VIRIGINS REEEEEEEE"
---
That's because I'm really a lizard person
---
Yes, until you managed to grind out R12-13 your best pieces will be from raids. And you don't really want to raid as shadow. The only valid reason to bring one is for shadow vulnerability debuff, but a shadow priest takes up 2-3 debuff slots and only does decent damage until it runs out of mana - barely worth it unless you have LOTS of warlocks. Most likely you'll be on dispel duty anyway.
---
Where cab you see faction balance for classic?
---
Yes, if you have dagger, its better to burst mage down with ambush. With mace or sword its better to cheap shot imho. You force mage to use his blink, then you sprint towards him and use kidney to force ice block.
---
Its software, there is always a mathematically best solution but the solution can change based on number of enemies, fight length, movement, etc. For shadow priest, dark void, misery and twist of fate are all used at different times depending on the boss fight or m+ affix. For boomkin, twin moons or solar flare are always swapped depending on the target number. Utility such as priest knockback or stun can be talented into depending on the m+ affix. For holy priest, the stat priority changes completely in m+ vs raid (mastery goes from worst to best stat). Its rare that a class never changes based on the fight or dungeon vs raid but there are a few (demon hunter).

The other day I was doing the Ashenvale befouled water elementals quest, so was an alliance mage. We just kept circling the Eastern half of the pool in a clockwise rotation picking up mobs as they respawned. Both of us clearly out of range of the other, and neither one of us making any aggressive moves.

...then a rogue came and killed him in the shallows :(

Then go farm her at level 51 and show us how easy it is without a group.
---
You sound a little angry about that
---
You do realise they messaged the same thing to all healers online till one responded right?
---
My condolences
---
They were quite decent to have in the dungeon. Starfire stunned stuff a lot. And in the other dungeon the balance druid was healing.
---
This kind of stuff upsets me, too.
---
My preference is not to play in crowded zones. That helps a lot.  I just leave the area and quest somewhere else.  I'm a casual player, so I don't mind doing that.  I feel like the less crowded zones are also prettier, so I prefer the environment over places like Westfall, too.
---
With something like that quest multiple groups were waiting for, I probably would have just left and decided not to do that quest.  It's not important enough to me.
---
What about using the same HDMI cable to output directly to the 240Hz monitor? Does that make the issue go away?
---
Yea, a mage mid aoe pull without frostbite or shatter(?). K.
---
Could you provide some examples?
---
Get better
---
I love these, and it is often the ones i end up joining.
---
But why do they always come 5 minutes before i log off? :(
---
The end-game content required weapons/armor/buffs from crafters, entertainers and doctors. So the crafters were *absolutely* needed and a part of the community. 
---
There was no "loot" as we know it in most MMOS. The loot was components that crafters needed to make the best weapons. The crafting was integrated into the end-game. 
---
And there really were crafters who were the best. Not like crafting in WoW where the item is what the item is. 
---
Even the mats varied in quality and finding the best mats was a game in itself.
---
Mages.
---
No it isn't.  It's a Karl Malone reference.
---
Post Malone didn't release anything until 9 years after WoW came out.
---
I mean you guys do have lots of experience with it.
---
It's not the amounts that are unreal, but the time investment required to reach high enough rank to be allowed to buy them.
---
You can level as anything but combat is just optimal. When I roll my rogue alt I plan to go combat until level 30 then respec into sub with hemo. I might do an ambush/hemo build with a weapon switch macro (open up with ambush then switch to a sword/mace in main hand)
---
Priest level is very consistent. Not massive burst damage but very consistent; less drinking, less food and able to melt in shadow form.
---
Maybe make the chess optional to activate or deactivate malchezar hard mode or something?
---
Started about 5 or 6 months after launch because my roommate was playing it. Played 
---
 alliance on Elune in one of the top raiding guilds on the server. Played a fury warrior for most of the endgame content up to Karazhan where if I remember right I started tanking for one of the 10 groups. Swapped back and forth between tanking for 10 mans and fury DPS in the 25 mans for a while. Drama imploded the guild, transferred servers around the Ulduar and became main tank of the guild I joined for that 25 man. Quit shortly after, never saw any content past that.
---
It really bothers me that there's no cooking equivalent for waters.
---
Ugh RFK
---
Hunter one is the same. Those two quests are truly epic quests. These two remind me of the epic quests in EQ, and I wish that all classes had at least one epic quest like this, it would feel much more lively.

I disagree, but thats the great part about this game...unless you are clearly violating the ToU, which im not, you can plsy however you desire.
---
If that means playing as a Chaotic Good avenger of your down trodden brethren who are crying out in general chat for assistance against their oppressors, go get it man.
---
You can also be the Chaotic Evil blood thirsty herald of death, slaying anything red in your path.
---
So long as you abide by Blizzard's ToU, anything goes.
---
Got mine at 42 i had poor money management at around level 33
---
btw i tested id via the wetlands tunnel. it doesnt work either. blizzard put a killzone at the end of it that disconnects you and teleports you on solid ground...
---
Literally the wurst for not min-maxing like a *REAL* WoW professional. That noob doesn't realize those two talent points would be 7.69457 dps more elsewhere LOLE
---
My friends list is the longest it ever been in WoW since classic  That being said my ignore list is much longer. I also have a list I keep on my desk with names of people who go out their way to fuck with me. Just gotta take em with a big grain of salt
---
Or blacksmiths with keys.
---
I did that too, mostly because in Tibia you had to actually talk to npcs to trigger them. The concept of just right clicking an npc blew my fucking mind.
---
On Kromcrush, I'm a low 30's level priest, and I can't quest in any contested zones. Any. Contested. Zones. I love pvp, and world pvp, but there's a minimum 10 horde to every 1 alliance. 
---
Of course someone is going to say I'm exaggerating, that maybe its the layer I'm in, no you're wrong. There's minimum **MINIMUM 10 horde to 1 alliance**. I walked from Booty Bay to the top of STV last night and was ganked 4 separate times during the walk, and twice more within an hour and a half period by multiple horde and a few ?? level horde. 
---
I want to play on a PVP server but Horde just can't relate to what is going on and they removed the option to transfer realms so I don't even want to play.
---
People don't take it seriously unless it's in local defense.  If I see it in general I don't pay it much mind.  Just me
---
Sometimes you have to take one for the team and just deal with them being in the same room.
---
It could've been confusion or naivety instead of being salty/snide. It's hard to tell all the time when everything nowadays is communicated via text.
---
It obviously wasn't cooked over a campfire. Sarcasm doesn't translate well via text and I don't like to simplify things as much any more. It was a super old microwave at someone's camp that sounded like it's about to take flight.
---
That's what it was meant to read like. No one has said they've improved over the years. So, I'm led to continue believing they're still a last resort garbage food and not frozen gourmet treasure. Everyone enjoys foods others believe to be gross anyway. I don't like cheese and people think that's ludicrous.

This is an early screenshot from like 2 weeks ago tho

Just gave me an idea for an addon to insta-thank people. Maybe type a command to send a thank you mesage or something.

really? this is the only way?

dude I am screwed then. Im not camping it out for days or spending 30g on a recipe ):
---
Whats the respawn timer?
---
Rip
---
Yeah, a real NEET icon
---
Yup. They are
---
No it didn't? Are you seriously telling me that adding  a barber shop is what killed the game. Actually use your brain and come up with something new for once, heard it 1000 times
---
Only reason it really funnels them there is no safe way to the best dungeon in the game 30-40
---
As Alliance, I only ever saw a lot of alliance there if they're running through to SM, otherwise outside that yeti cave is a bare minimum of 5 horde, but often way more than that.
---
This is speaking from the Rattlegore server
---
&gt;Go do some fcking quests like every1 else is doing it and how it is supposed to be instead of braindead aoe farming... I much prefer the suckers farming SM all day over those mages that farm in the open world..
---
Hmm, yes tell people how to play and enjoy their game. You seem rather upset by people playing the way they do.
---
In STV when summoning Mokk and he finally arrives after 3 waves of mobs and some asshat rogue was stealthed opens on Mokk and Jill‚Äôs him while fight the rest of the wave. Forcing another 20 minutes of farming Fangs....

Alliance propaganda.
---
Found the horde player
---
Well, the total kills are probably retroactive. I can't imagine the actual rank calculations being though.
---
Warriors have a rough time leveling up till like 40 where u start killing very fast, also great at 60 pvp. 
---
Id go a warrior, mage is just assosciated with being a boring aoe machine right now
---
Ok, calm down there Satan.
---
Well at least you got a good story out of it.
---
nice, once you where done i bet you felt super fulfilled.
---
I do believe in fairies, I do, I do, I do!
---
I don't mind as long as they actually kill them and don't die and drop them on me!
---
Buddy playing retail told me to just create a char and look....RETAIL LOOKS SHIT!
---
What tf did they do to that game?
---
Can't you just use macros to swap to daggers and use an opener then swap back. Pretty sure my buddy does this to ambush
---
I love tukui. Complete overhaul of the UI to be very minimal and sleek. However its all customizable and you can turn off specific elements as needed and easily move elements around.
---
While it's a fun story I don't think your guildies shouting at you like you're stupid was nice nor was it constructive.  They could have simply said "there's a lift at the bottom of the ramp"
---
If you take rez sickness, they win.
---
I believe a "twink" is an alt that you've geared out. When it comes to Battlegrounds, a twink would be a character in a lower bracket, say level 18/19, that has all of the best rare gear because you can afford to buy it, thus making that character very powerful in relation to the other players.
---
Is that khadgar whisker right there?
---
Point I'm trying to make is it's not the price that I'm upset with, it's the fact he wouldn't help a random person, fellow druid, with making the item when it costs him nothing but 1 minute of time, and then to respond and call me a non guildie pleb is about as smug as you can get, and I thought in classic there would be less of this. This goes on the same boat as booting someone from a dungeon for low dps and running past people who are being ganked and not helping out.
---
An unfortunate time to feel sober again üòÜ
---
Thanks for the node loser
---
Any one else playing something a little off meta? I am currently leveling a dual wielding warrior and having an absolute BLAST. I know it isn't optimal, but it just feels awesome running around with 2 axes chopping down things. I've gone through 4 classes to level 30 and this one is by far the most fun.
---
 Obviously if someone is standing on a node they are planning to mine it, or an asking of whether or not they were planning to mine it is necessary, or at the least, the polite thing to do. Nobody is denying this. I'm not sure why you are bringing up a hypothetical scenario where somebody is literally standing on top of a node, when I'm specifically talking about someone fighting *near* a node. The OP is not talking about someone standing on a node. The OP is talking about someone in the general vicinity of a node.

 /script PetAbandon();  DOES work for Warlocks, but only as a DISMISS.

It does not allow you to rename your Demon.

---
Other than private server data - admittedly, there actually isn‚Äôt a whole lot of concrete data. 
---
That being said - the nature of the specs themselves and itemization available at different stages + relatively accurate pserver data (as much as it gets circle jerked on this sub that‚Äôs its all wrong blah blah - it‚Äôs pretty fucking close) lends itself to favor swords considerably. 
---
The biggest factors come down to energy efficiency/damage on sinister strike vs backstab and sword spec / dagger spec. 
---
Combat swords just straight up beats combat daggers due to heavy reliance on white damage and the increased efficiency of sinister strike over backstab - in equal gear of course. 
---
It stays this way basically all the way up to Very Late AQ/Naxx gear. Once you start hitting that ~30% crit mark you can move to seal fate swords/daggers where swords will usually still win. 
---
However, seal date daggers can pull ahead on some fights due to the shear crit reliability at that stage generating absolutely massive amounts of combo points - additionally the vanish/ambushes you can sneak it also contributes highly to its additional effectiveness. 
---
We should see some actual numbers from classic emerge over the next few months but all available data that can be at least somewhat relied on points to swords winning almost the entire game. : /
---
yah but by then who was still leveling professions when the game was spitting out epics at all lvls.
---
I will say, it was a pretty fun zone to level through
---

---
A lot of people are having an issue with the last driver they put out. I'm hearing a lot of complaints that Borderlands 3 and Gears 5 was running great until that driver update and now it plays like garbage. I wouldn't be surprised if WoW saw some similar issues.
---
&gt;Everyone complaining about mages being op and nobody is commenting that the rogue was dumb and opened with cheapshot on a mage more than 3 times....
---
THIS
---
Rogues, Mages are literally immune to cheap shot every 15 secs, just AMBUSH them, fuck
---
Eh, if they don't have a reason to, kinda, but warriors made their choice, they need to be slowed down as much as possible before they become gods.
---
I mean fair as in, this person would give me honour.
---
I have macros set up and cast fortitude on every passer by until I oom.
---
I've also had a lot of fun encounters.  Had a warrior save me from death and helped me kill 2 mobs.  Saw him 20 minutes later with 5% hp running away from 2 mobs.  He saw me and I saw him, and he turned around to finish the mobs just as my heals went off.
---
Casting fortitude on people also has its benefits.  A lot of people will buff you back, ive had mages stop to trade me water as thanks.  I play on a RP server and it can get pretty wild.
---
Maybe it's because I didn't play many classes that gave buffs back in the day, but I find myself spending more time buffing strangers than paying attention to where I'm going sometimes.
---
Talandar Tribe if you like the RP-PVP ruleset. So far it's been a solid server and community on both sides.
---
resto druids excelled in endgame content since the HoTs they offered worked great in a 40man.  Shaman totems only worked on the group they were in, so shamans were in high demand for buffs to be spread throughout the raid if possible, but in some cases, warlocks for example would be in their own group, while an enhance shaman would be in a group with rogues and warriors.  
---
So, to sum it up, either is fine.  We had a badass druid who was feral, but still healed in raids, then would DPS while regenning, then back to healing.  He was one of those real exceptional players that had mastered his class to a science.
---
Just hit em with a blessing of protection isntesd
---
If anyone wants like a super guranteed check I have 300 fishing skill, I can grab a aquadynamic and fish wherever you want and record it.
---
what else could he have done? not attack the mage.
---
That‚Äôs exactly how I‚Äôm ready it ‚Äúfinally‚Äù hit 60, only had to play every day for hours on end disregarding personal hygiene and responsibility
---
For some reason I had it in my head that you needed beserker stance to use it. I checked and was wrong.
---
True, if big.
---
I love playing my druid, but it can truly be stated that a druid is a jack of all trades, master of none.
---
And it's true! I was doing the Lakeshire murloc quests when a friendly warlock gave me waterbreathing. It was a huge help for a warrior like me :DD.
---
Achievements.
---
I disagree a bit.  Druids don't have great kill speed but we have the lowest downtime in the game.  Before level 20 you stick in bear form, maul whenever it's up, and focus on one monster at a time.  Demo roar if it's a tough monster.  You'll be able to kill 2 or 3 before getting low HP, then pop out and heal to full, pull a monster with wrath or moonfire, then shift back into bear.  
---
STAY in bear for a few monsters- your mana will regen back to full.  Heal, pull, shift.  Repeat this and you literally will never have to drink or eat unless you get a few adds and/or have to run. 
---
So yes, druids don't kill as fast but the ZERO effective downtime makes us top-tier grinders.  I have done a lot of grinding on my druid - questing where it makes sense of course, but just killing tons of monsters for a good chunk of my xp. 
---
Cat form doesn't really get that good until level 24 or 26.  At level 20 you don't have many abilities.   Even still, cat doesn't REALLY take off until level 32 when you get ferocious bite.  Early on, you can do rake-&gt;rip-&gt;claw until dead.  You have no nice way to spend combo points because while rip does good damage the monster is often dead before most of it's DoT applies
---
I roll a Druid and can't say I've had this issue yet. However, I may have been out of form when starting the quests so I'm not sure. Will absolutely keep in mind though, thanks... PS Bear dance is best dance
---
Who the fuck uses X for CC?
---
As a low level warrior, I salute you healers who take the time to help. Lord knows we are in enough trouble as it is
---
I'm a level 51 warrior tank leveling as arms and I occasionally have trouble holding hate on groups of 4+ mobs. I'm still experimenting with the best way to get initial threat and trying different things. Lately I've been charging in with my 2h, then switching to berserker and popping berserker rage and whirlwind, then immediately switching back to shield for thunderclap/demoralizing shout. After that I'll start tab sundering and hitting revenge when it's up. I always have skull and X marked so the group knows which to focus.
---
This has been working relatively well but I'm worried I'll be laughed off the server when someone catches me using whirlwind while tanking. I'm only in berserker stance for about 1-2 seconds right after the pull. Is this an okay strategy or am I making my healer cry? Any other tips on holding hate for those big pulls of non elite mobs?
---
There is a reason for it. That's how it was back then. Something like that actually changes the difficulty of the game and the vast majority of players want the same experience. Imagine if blizzard just said screw it, you can have 60 people in raid, that completely changes the difficulty of the content.
---
It is yes
---
Recruitment like that guarantees they will have exactly the sort of members they want...and if you'll excuse me, I need to go puke.
---
When I was brushing my teeth this morning I froze - I had a horrible thought. What if our wives leave us for each other??
---
BG brackets are between 10-19, 20-29, 30-39 and so on all the way to 60. This means that a lvl 20 will enter the same bg as a lvl 29. 
---
Twinking is when you level a character to 19/29/39 etc and get that character the optimal gear for that level. Often with high level enchants on the gear and gear that is unobtainable at that lvl without a higher lvl helping you and a lot of gold.
---
One of the core reasons classic returned is because the original players that liked it for what it was asked for it's return.  The whole point was to keep it the same.  People like you complaining for it to change defeats the purpose of the request
---
Play an alt so your time is not wasted.
---
If blizzard planned to do anything about it they already would have. They have the tools. They can change the cooldown at any time. Blizzard obviously does not care.
---
I disagree- bear form doesn't kill stuff super fast but you have ZERO downtime so you will out-grind most classes except maybe warlock or hunter.
---
Hurt real bad

---
So honor releases in a couple of weeks which motivates worldpvp a bit but for what? Do the honorpoints go towards gear or is it just for the sak√© of it?
---
Say thanks to the #nochanges crowd.
---
you can say it's the more authentic vanilla experience and the game was balanced around it back then maybe some classes would be op in raids without and raids would be definitely be way easier without the limit and people already complain that raids are too easy
---
This was confirmed to not be a bug with it discarding your loot. There really isn't any loot as to what blizzard has said. As other have mentioned I'm inclined to side with blizzard on this one as if you disable auto loot you will have windows with no loot. I think it's just victim to poor design of that era, it shouldn't sparkle if there is no loot :/
---
Firstly any videos of world first naxx would be closer to 1.12 than 1.1 rag by a big margin. That was literal years of updates and changes before naxx patch even came out.
---
Secondly I partially agree that some percent of players would still clear rag quickly. The parameters of how thats done would be wildly different in a 1.1 setting though; kungen's point of mages doing significantly less damage alone would change a lot.
---
"finally got a healer lol"
---
Good advertisement for a horrible guild.
---
I had a total of 94g when I dinged 40. The biggest mistake is buying ALL of your skills, and purchasing things on the AH. Go ahead and sell greens you find on the AH, but vendor if they don't sell after 1 or 2 tries. Make sure you are picking up everything you can, the vendor gold will really stack up.
---
It would be very cool to tweak Kara to be a 20 man that sits between aq40 and naxx40 like how ZG sits between MC and BWL/Early AQ40
---
I think that is definitely a good idea since I think it is more fun to level and do dungeons with friends. Warrior's are insane in vanilla, great dps and obviously best tanks but a little hard to level at first until they get their plate armor and better abilities. Paladin is a lot more versatile since you can heal and tank if needed. They are both way different from Rogue so I don't think you'll go wrong with either!
---
Um why would your druid death run to booty bay, when you can just swim it faster and safer from the light house in westfall.
---
Well yeah, of course.
---
Thank you.  I don‚Äôt play either of those games so I‚Äôm not in the loop on them.  I‚Äôll definitely skip reinstalling and go straight to rolling back to the last update.  Unless they push another update sometime today to fix it.
---
Level 14 mage here. Which primary and secondary professions should i get and why? And also, how would i know if i should sell/keep items that i picked up from killing monsters?
---
I'd like all of that, but I don't want every new idea to be instanced. That would have the same effect as flying (or, worse, garrisons). The world would look empty because so many players are instanced.
---
Open-world battlegrounds or tower defense, scheduled (and unscheduled) PVP challenges in random zones, stuff like that.
---
Obviously satire, I'd join
---
Wow sorry that aoe loot ruined WoW bud. I'm sorry that a function to auto search people to find a group was added bud. Must of been me that ruined WoW and not blizzard. Sorry about that bud.
---
it refers to a character who purposely stays at a lower level and gets the best gear/enchants possible at that level, typically being vastly more powerful than their level implies. you probably won‚Äôt see any until bgs come out, typically being levels 19, 29 or 39.
---
They aren't marked on the map unless you install an addon for that...
---
You‚Äôre level 6. Just quest and have fun ffs
---
It's either that or people get that much closer to 1 shotting each other
---
And karma is a bitch. So here's to hoping you get cancer. Since it's all you care to spread.
---
Levels 1-20 for a Druid are the slow portion in terms of efficiency.
---
From 1-10 you're a rubbish caster, from 10-20 you're a rubbish warrior. You have some sustain via heals but your mana pool is small and your Time to Kill is high. Your leveling tree (Feral) has a lot of padding/guff at the beginning, and it takes time to get to the juicy talents on rows 3+. You also have two lengthy Druid quests at 14 and 16 that are hilariously time consuming and involve a lot of cross continent travel to complete. As a new player, you're not going to be performing any of this optimally, so it's going to take even longer. That's fine.
---
At level 20-22 things start to take off for you, and from 20-40 you're the 2nd best leveling class in the game. Cat form and Feral Swiftness will change the game for you, dramatically increasing your TTK and giving you a run speed boost, trimming travel time. That run speed boost jumps again at level 30, and by your mid thirties your cat form will have its full suite of tools and solo incredibly efficiently.
---
As others have stated, you might look into downloading a quest add on if you find you're really having issues getting waylaid or wondering where to go, although that is part of the charm of vanilla so think hard before obliterating it via Questie.
---
Re-Roll PvE.  Fewer neck-beard basement-dwellers with nothing better to do.
---
1. He used crippling poison. Unfortunately it did not proc until the end. 
---
2. Distract doesn‚Äôt work on targets in combat. 
---
3. He literally sprinted + vanished + attempted to stun lock mage, but his blink was up.  
---
4. Not having engineering doesn‚Äôt make a rogue a bad rogue. This isn‚Äôt end game PVP. Honestly not knowing distract can‚Äôt be used when target is in combat makes a person a bad rogue lol.
---
Yes but bottom line, Blizzard can do what they want to do to cheaters.
---
Layering will be gone come phase 2. Your time window is running out.
---
I need to get closer...
---
&gt;I‚Äôd have thought the common courtesy would be to share the loot. Again just my thoughts. 
---
And I can agree with that sentiment, but its absolutely at the discretion of the rogue in the party.  However, by default people should drop the attitude of "oh its a locked chest everyone has fair say" because that simply isn't true when you enter in black smiths or engineers into the equation.
---
This really is only a problem with pug groups as guildies or small cliques don't care. I just find it annoying when people try to draw comparison to "its a 100% free skill for rogues" which isn't true or when the hypocrisy of "but miners and herbalists also don't have to share the loot" when the same logic of "but without the group you wouldn;t even have access to the node; which again isn't true because most pick pocketing runs for rogues include taking locked chests on their route anyway. 
---
Most arguments in favor of having rogues pass the loot come across as greedy -- and fail to take into consideration it isn't just rogues that can open locked chests in the first place.
---
I learned the semi-hard way that the debuff duration doesn't decrease while logged out. Damn, I did remember that wrong.
---
&gt; Die a little inside because you're a rogue and this type of grinding beats actual mob grinding
---
Is it that bad? I just rolled a rogue to take a break from grinding my warrior.
---
I'll likely start as pve spec to establish my worth/value with my guild &amp; take care of mc/bwl then swap to pvp spec full time for a while then back to pve spec for AQ/Naxx progression then back to pvp after that stuff is downed.
---
I'm def not willing to swap every week Just dont have time for that will just need to accept the fact that you arent min/maxed in every situation
---
So you‚Äôre lazy lol
---
Awesome job my fellow UD mage! That level 1 frostbolt is clutch for a hasty slow. He didn't release, I would have cannibal'd him just to add insult to injury! He most likely re-rolled after that.

&gt;LFM priest SFK
---
Legion and BfA have left such a sour taste in my mouth for this character.
---
I'm currently herbing and skinning, and gotta be honest, skinning has made me very little. There is just so much vendor trash, only thick leather has sold on the AH. 
---
I'm level 43 and have herbing at 261, and plan on sticking with skinning till I get to 60. Once 60, I'm going to power level alchemy.
---
Melee experience : I'm out of RANGE i CANT do THAT
---
There are a couple warrior bis items made by smithy 
---
Bis as in better than anything from raids 
---
Resistance gear is good too but as you said now that people figured it out it‚Äôs not high in demand as it used to be 
---
Doe making money with professions is hard anyways even the rare stuff goes for mat prize right now so for cash from professions you might as well just sell mats from gathering imo 
---
Unless you get your hands on nice recipes I guess
---
A twink is a low level character kitted out by a higher level character. People make twinks to participate in PvP battlegrounds. Each battleground has a level range bracket. People level a character to the top of the bracket and then kit it out with the best possible gear for that level.
---
For example, Warsong Gulch (a capture-the-flag style battleground) has brackets of 10-19; 20-29; 30-39; 40-49;50-60.
---
A person will make a character level 19, 29, 39, or 49, and put it in the best gear, then participate in PvP at the top of their bracket.
---
They have changed the cooldown.
---
I guess i got lucky drop here but got it on third footlocker
---
I am a mage at level 57 with 250g, I have tailor max and skinin max, should I drop tailor once I get Robe of the Archmage? Also keep snlkining?
---
People keep saying details is pretty good
---
I have a list of people like this that I make notes about so if I see them again I will avoid them and their groups. Surely there is an addon for this but right now I just have a notepad lol.
---
I love Rogues stealth opening on me as a Warlock.

Sac the voidwalker as they pop all their cd's and only take 50% of my shield, casually /wave them as I cast a Death Coil and take them down to CC land.

Bruh this was experience last night trying to Kill Tethis. 
---
First try: my group of 5 and an alliance group of 5 waiting for the respawn. I tell my party of randoms we better kill them now before its an all-out brawl for the tag. They agree in party chat, so I start the fight right as our rogue is running in from behind. I, the rogue, and our mage die, the other two simply ran not even engaging in battle. We lose the tag.
---
Second try: Never found the spawn until we saw it's dead body
---
Third try: Find the spawn, lose the tag, one member from my party leaves and quickly joins the other getting the tag. Other guy simply leaves due to frustration. 
---
Fourth try: Only 3 left in the party, but we finally get the spawn and grab the tag. 1/3 health to go a group of 5 allies come and wipe us from no where. 
---
I finally gave up and went to waste some alliance at nesingwary to relieve my frustration. 
---
I love pvp realms, but sometimes your luck can really suck.
---
Also, playing multiple characters lets you take full advantage of rest XP bonuses.
---
if youre within cone of cold range once, youre dead due to deadzone and getting there is rather easy with rank 1 frostbolt/blink
---
Twinking is trying to get the best possible gear for your character's level and is usually for pvp. Since battlegrounds are bracketed into level ranges a twink can only fight other players their level and destroy them no contest (unless they are very geared as well).
---
Payback for those gnome fucks that only gank you after you tag a mob.
---
i challenge you in a game of L-E-V-E-L
---
Thank god.
---
as soon as you enter STV from Westfall aim  just left of the furthest island on the right while swimming south. (this one should be pointy top)
---
When you get there, again aim for the furthest island on the right,  This one has an flat slop top. when you get close enough to notice that the flat top is  is actually the statue + terrain, aim to left of statue.
---
If your on a PvP server, once you get close enough to see the docks/boat, swim to the bottom and aim for the ramp by the fishing hut. (horde will gank you if your on the surface)
---
Other than that, even a level 1 priest can make the swim in perfect safety.
---
The Tirion chain is so good. And then his development over Vanilla and WotLK gets tossed in the garbage in Cataclysm
---
I'm pretty sure that's just Stratholme
---
well... you can try
---
Yeah, they were up for about 3-4 hours
---
Holy fucking gag...
---
Yeah because layer exploiting dungeons, which is what people are getting banned for, somehow gave this guy a bank full of world drop BoEs. Don‚Äôt be idiots.
---
Holy fuck do I hate mage gameplay
---
damn that was an awesome fight. You can tell by the title that you were gonna win but I actually caught myself literally biting my nails in suspense of the fight because it looked a little hairy there for a second
---
It is possible to get grand Marshall pvp gear without having pve raid gear base to build off of, but it is probably so difficult it would be impractical or nearly impossible. Maybe on a really low population server, or if you had a group that could carry you it could happen, but it would be very very difficult and very time consuming. If all you want to avoid is raids and are fine doing dungeons, that makes it much easier, but still hard.
---
If you want to 15 sec after every pack feel free. But i won't even think twice to even consider it. Casters can drink whenever they get out of combat. But i'm not waiting for them.
---
It's a bug with the time based loot tables for ocean fishing. For everyone posting theories about auto loot being bugged etc.
---
There's probably other players farming what you're farming in the overworld, so switching layers doesn't guarantee you're better off. Dungeons are instanced, you're GOING to have a free boss respawn with 0 competition.
---
This made me laugh out loud at work and now my coworker is giving me strange looks. Cudos.
---
Love you too, boo
---
How I make video to not sound like shit? I am using an equaliser, but it doesn't record audio in default settings.
---
I'm banning my part
---
What class are you... This just seems impossible.
---
You're supposed to vendor everything before heavy and even after. That's the point, you have more coin for each kill.
---
The AH is a shit show and will be for another month.
---
There was LFG UI added in TBC and I don't recall people complaining about it?
---
O.O OMG totally saw the corpse!
---
Nah I'm still going to whine
---
I did the same but with Kign Magni. Also the same quest on the Aliance side :)

Heavy rain my first night questing in Feralas today.
---
Thought for sure the tree would start talking and then the alliance would just be upon me.
---
Turns out I wouldn't have seen the two of them coming anyway, they were rogues.
---
Ask in global chat, and read guild announcement. You can check official forum too
---
There is an unused instance portal in SW.
---
As a warrior this is how I generally solo fight the named mobs in a pack, I shoot the main one and run, after a few seconds I turn back and fire then keep running. Repeat. If they get to me I only hit the main guy with attacks, nothing aoe, until his adds reset. Then I usually am able to finish the main mob unless they all stuck on me so long that I am very low.
---
You can even PvP on the PvE servers, you get to CHOOSE when you think it's fair and honorable fight by flagging yourself, and they can choose whether they want to fight you back!
---
Do it in STV tbh, your faction needs you more there.
---
Pretty sure it was just one person and a bunch of bots.
---
That armory helmet is pretty much the best until 60...
---
Also armor type doesn't matter, if I get a leather/mail piece with insane stats I will replace a plate piece for sure, specially if the plate one is a few levels behind because it will have very little armor extra. Yesterday I lost 30 armor but got +1% crit and some extra stamina.
---
That sounds so cool. Could you drown from the water? Could you swim to the surface? Is it a mini instance area leading nowhere or could you travel to other places?
---
/console weatherdensity 3
---
I think it‚Äôs on 3 by default but try it anyway 
---
You might just be unlucky tbh
---
Actually respawning mobs IS one purpose of layering. One reason laying exists is to spread out player population between layers so they don't have to fight for the same mobs as much. Each layer is essentially it's own game world with it's own mobs. However switching layers in the open world doesn't guarantee you will see the mobs, you might even end up in a layer that is even more farmed up. However this was intended and expected behavior of the layering system. In dungeons there is no competition of other players, respawning bosses via layer switches in dungeons was something that was clearly not intended.
---
balancing classes would affect leveling and break that "classic leveling feel"
---
I'm leveling with my SO and find it nice to have so many options depending on what we need.   I'm not really looking for end game raiding with this character but I know PvP will be fun with the druid.
---
You can skip the Troll boss in the basement if you want, he isn't required to fight Eranikus.
---
Aura bug?
---
It's better than being a hunter and having no buffs to hand out.
---
Wow I play horde and I feel bad
---
My realm, benediction, is alliance bias. Anyone we (horde) world pvp all the time. Charred Vale in Stonetalon  is a freaking bloodbath and uniting the horde against the alli scum is the most fun I have had playing.
---
3 tin to 1 copper
---
Fair enough, but given the replies I've been getting maybe I am getting a bit defensive.
---
IMO rogue lockpicking is clearly most closely tied to professions. All of the other analogies pale when held up next to professions. That is what I always come back to. I really don't like the way people are deciding that they are entitled to the boon of another class. If people want the benefit they can roll that class or one of the professions that give it.
---
I also don't like people demanding to roll on mining nodes in a dungeon, or other profession resources unless they also have the ability.
---
Also it is kinda slow before you get cat form it is perfectly normal. Druid is good and fairly easy to level but not the fastest.
---
Found the dishonorable cur.
---
My cat will bite my legs until I pet him, then he takes a nap next to me until I'm done.
---
But why, it's not like we can transmog it.
---
Always expect that from a horde player.
---
Incoming downvotes about how you should let people play what they want.
---
I would I could upvote this 1000 times
---
And you'd succeed with that by doing tiny pulls, and utilizing Druid and Warrior cleave, lmao.
---
Play a Paladin. Get a Warrior buddy and a single target group. Go do big pulls of 8-12 mobs at a time. Come back to me and tell me how it goes, and all of the names that your healer called you.
---
Yeah, you all just meet up wherever it is you're going, usually. For dungeons, people will often arrange everything at the dungeon entrance, so you can just go there and start asking around for a group/replying to LFG messages. If you do that, be sure to bring any food/water/arrows/other consumables you'll need, have your gear recently repaired, and lots of empty bag space for all the loot you'll be getting!
---
How did you get the typing box to go above chat like that? Addon? I've only ever seen that with evlui
---
Ill pwn your ass on my shammy no matter what gear you have.
---
i like the little fan in the side of the case\^\^
---
What are your addons I must know!!
---
Yeah... They had a bad comp and low level. A good spellcleave grp is very efficient tho
---
teach me senpai
---
You're right about the 1% miss chance for spells, I don't remember how physical hit is handled though.
---
I love hunter and pvp and I honestly hope it stays broken/unreliable.  It was always broken and unreliable I'm classic, to the point where scatter&gt;&gt;fd&gt;&gt;trap was necessary for most people in clutch situations.  I honestly don't think it should even be part of the hunter toolkit because it's a cheap tool that's mostly a crutch and makes hunter pvp boring, for both sides.
---
Also because there is nothing in this whole world as much fun as watching a warrior charge into a trap over and over.
---
I think he's saying it's a nightmare to get repeatedly ganked when you play solo. I agree with you guys.
---
Hello, 
---
What are the best jobs to become rich?
---
What server?
---
Too late, already reported you. Enjoy your ban.
---
Difference in effectiveness =/= difference in intent
---
Yep.   And if you find one aspect of the character you like playing the most, that gives you a hint as to what you should aim for in another class.
---
Hinterlands as well
---
More people doesn't mean shit when you're solo questing tho. I got ganked about 10 times just getting my body from the yeti mines to the camp because allies kept killing me the second I revived.
---
Printscreen m8
---
It's a dog eat dog world out there.
---
I had a tailor/enchanter throughout classic and I certainly wouldn't call it a money making profession. Enchanting was definitely better mostly due to being able to DE BoP stuff. I made some money on things like crusader (early on) but I think alchemy and gathering professions will be more profitable.
---
Fire fixes this....by fire be purged.
---
As a former overwatch dps player I wanna disagree but I love the wow team rn
---
Looks to me like he might have a crippling poison and it just didn‚Äôt proc until the end. And cheap shot is possibly his best option if he‚Äôs combat and doesn‚Äôt have a dagger to swap out for ambush, his other option would be garrote but that would just be negated by ice block as well and gives one less combo point. The bigger issue here is just what looks to be a combat rogue without improved sprint opening on a mage at all, with that blind not helping his case.
---
He looked pretty reasonable until the second half.
---
Up into level 40 I have effectively "tanked" and "healed" with the exact same set of gear as my enhancement set.
---
No i don't.
---
Doctor or lawyer
---
One could be forgiven for thinking that that's already happened.
---
What do you mean you've been playing solo?  You haven't grouped up at all for anything?
---
Yep!
---
"Hey other players...you change your play style 'cause I ain't gonna change mine."
---
Hell, it's worse than that!  He ain't asking his friends and family... instead he's asking the rest of the world to change.
---
Weak sauce.
---
I mean you could make the gnomer shortcut jump run under an hour.
---
Enter through BB, jump down kill viscious fallout, proceed down to the mecha guy, kill him, jump down and spend 25 minutes clearing all that crap in fron of the last boss.
---
Its a pretty short run, overall, but you do skip a couple bosses like the  crowd pummeler boss.
---
Dammit.
---
It's always like this :) people say you exploit when, even when you got proves :D
---
Yep. Our whole team got wrecked while we were waiting for Horrace to respawn :(
---
its only for escort quests what Ive seen
---
If you actually think that no add-ons would be removed then I'm assuming you agree with me.

Can any high level druids tell me if [Wolfshead Helm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=8345/wolfshead-helm) stacks with furor in classic? I've seen conflicting reports and I'm trying to decide between tribal and elemental leatherworking.
---
I would treat bots like multiple people in an MMO but yeah I see your point.
---
Are you sure? I feel like I have lost em just by targeting.
---
Oh, my sweet summer child.
---
Thank you for the article - and especially for the links to materials you used to learn. This is all super helpful for getting started.
---
I‚Äôm a novice developer that hasn‚Äôt done any front end work at all yet (data engineer by trade but increasingly interested in software engineering) - but I figured a wow addon would be a fun project. It was a bit daunting trying to find decent (and up to date) materials on working with lua and wow‚Äôs api.
---
I‚Äôm going to look through your code after reading your article and try to get a handle on it. Would you mind if I PM you some questions after I‚Äôve had time to properly dig through your code?
---
Why would you not open with cheap shot as sword rogue
---
Stripper if you‚Äôre desperate and have the bod
---
What can I do as a frost mage going into level 30 to boost mana regen and available mana? Which enchantments or gear should I be looking for?
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
"Misses"
---
Seems to be a worse version of just going full on POM Pyro fire or POM Frost. You can go POM Frost and go deeper into the frost tree to get really nice benefits to your frost spells, or alternatively go POM and deep fire to get like blast wave and the like so you're not super tied to just the POM + Pyro combo. Also doing that lets you go down to Arcane Power which most view as pretty vital for POM anything.
---
Where my destro locks at? I‚Äôm looking for opinions on wpvp and BGs. I won‚Äôt be raiding likely l, just some 5 mans. I‚Äôm curious how gimping myself on raid gear will play out.
---
I'm 300 fishing and never experienced any problems?
---
If you're interested in getting others, you might like this guide. It's been around since the original classic. I used my rogue back then and followed her stealth guide to getting the Worg pup successfully.    [http://www.playthingofthegods.com](http://www.playthingofthegods.com/)
---
You have it completely backwards.
---
You want the slow, high damage weapon in the main hand. The offhand can be whatever; fast is ok for poison procs. The offhand weapon takes a \~20% drop to its damage as well; there are talents to increase offhand damage, though. Poison proc damage is not reduced for the offhand.
---
You can be strong, you can own, you won't be 100% optimal no.  Same goes for PVE'ing without pvping, that's part what makes classic great.
---
It‚Äôs not reportable because technically it‚Äôs a free skinning node after you kill it, although anyone who steals one is absolute cancer. All I can say is wait for them to leave or hope no one is stealthed. Not sure what else you can do, those skins are expensive so people are going to be massive asses to try and get them for free.
---
They're rebel alliance scum. Why would you feel bad?
---
&gt;Name a bigger loser, I dare you
---
 [Rintae](https://www.reddit.com/user/Rintae/)

Wouldn't make much sense to put RP servers in the same pool as PvP servers now would it?
---
Complaining about the complaining! Full circle boys!
---
Thanks for the threat - was just considering.
---
PARKOUR!!!
---
That feel when you're doing an underwater quest and you finally get to be useful to strangers.
---
tl;dr a bunch of stats items, enchants and all buffs apply auras to your character, the bug is instead of a 32 buff cap, there's a 32 aura cap.
---
For instance, items that grant +ap apply 2 auras to your character, this means by equipping truestrike you're worst case losing the possibility of 2 buffs, the combination of which should be much stronger than a measly 24 ap, best case though, the AP just doesn't do anything because the buffs push off the AP auras.
---
This is why there has been reports of people missing attacks despite being above hit cap... buffs are literally pushing off your +hit auras applied by items.
---
Some people don't have a lot of times in their life where they are very powerful and able to use that power to influence the days of other people and be a "winner" without even trying all that hard.
---
We agree that they are showing absolutely no skill in doing this, but for some reason some people get their rocks off that way. It's a unique experience that they don't get to have very often. It makes them feel good. Maybe their boss is a dick to them and they lose a lot when they play games like Overwatch or LoL. It does make some amount of sense from a human psyche perspective why people do this.
---
(Tbh I had to roll through Wetlands at lvl 40 to get to Badlands and I killed like 20 alliance I passed on the path on my way and it was kinda fking fun lmao)
---
&gt;it is probably worse to us a VW than over Imp or Succu.
---
Warlocks will never hear the end of people assuming that the complaining warlocks are casuals or just simply bad because they assume VW works like in the later expansions...
---
Why did it became worse from how it was in the beta? Did Blizz shadownerfed it?
---
I have a lvl 48 hunter and it becomes much more fun once you reach lvl 40.  Pre-lvl 40 hunter is nothing but auto-shooting with serpent sting and arcane shot (also auto-attack pet)
---
It seems to be true, most people follow the same guide blindly while levelling without paying attention to the current market.
---
very cool
---
haha
---
Happy questing brother

---
&gt;No, special attacks use your main hand weapon, which is why rogues usually have a slow weapon in their main hand and a fast weapon in their off hand, if i remember correctly.
---
not super reliable source but my guildie said the same thing
---
Right thanks. So I don't need to do any of the clicking of the statues etc?
---
So let's say I enter the instance. Do I take the first left and UP the stairs - clear trolls on the balconies and jump down?
---
As someone else said, if you killed it DONT LOOT IT. You might need to forfeit a few skins by letting the corpses despawn to show these guys you're serious. 
---
I have heard that you can open trade window to stop people mining your nodes however I do not know if this works or not for skinning (or even for mining)
---
Should have been Sub and ambushed instead of trying to cheapshot a mage thats going to blink the stun anyways.
---
yeah, but even if you bring a priest you have to be careful not to pull too many in case the priest gets sleeped. Shamans got that tremor totem.
---
TL:DR These are computers, that the world of Warcraft lived in.
---
‚ÄúBlade servers‚Äù are made by HP and they were meant to be easily to scale. So you get a hub, and keep adding these to allow more people to enter the world.
---
As tech progress, old servers (computers) are replaced with new era/better ones.
---
At 19 you gotta play sword &amp; board and basically be annoying/tanky. There's no way you could go damage and not get kited to death.
---
29 is better, just don't go arms.
---
hear me out. In the beginning certain mobs move slower or faster than others. Certain mobs you can run away and get out of their range while you wait for your weapon swing. You can hamstring as a warrior and do this. Helps not get hit when you feel like your about to die.
---
But wait. If you corpse camp them, you're just contributing to the circlejerk, and not "actual" PVP.
---
If its red, it's dead.
---
You win this time, ally scum
---
Take the OSRS route and make gear that doesnt introduce power creep but fits niches very well.
---
A really brave one or a really dumb one.
---
This is something I've never thought about. Do most right handed people spin left? I don't think I ever consciously decide which direction to 360.
---
100% a dickmove, just cuz we're on a pvp server doesnt mean killing lowbies isnt an asshole move. gaining nothing and inconveniencing others to make yourself feel better is some sadistic shit.
---
I hate these whispers &lt;.&lt; 0 tips everyone expects yoy to drop group for a second to give a port. Gimme free food. Gimme $$$
---
Sharding is which is similar but different
---
I would be utterly shocked and pretty impressed if they even caught/banned 51% of the people that abusing this.
---
PvE server is that way --&gt;
---
Ganking is neither toxic nor against the rules.
---
about 20 really good ones on youtube.  Just search "classic wow rogue leveling guide".  Many of them will refer you to webpages.  Wowhead has some bare bones type guides for each class too.
---
Dad, I've got reddit too.
---
What makes you assume that?
---
oh....my...god.. He was about to /spit on your beloved warchief! Get him Horde..#@%!!
---
It might have been introduced in a later phase.
---
Oh, look out everybody, we got a tough guy over here.
---
Seriously, no one cares. You're being exactly the douche I was talking about. 
---
You're using someone else's conversation about getting ganked just as a way to make yourself feel superior.
---
All of your statements are just veiled ways of saying, "**I'M** a big enough badass that I don't need to call for help. **I'M** tough enough not to complain about being ganked! **I** don't need to learn any tough lessons, I'm already a badass!"
---
It's just so pathetic. Stop acting like getting ganked or camped isn't shitty. You're talking about 'fighting your own battles' in reference to situations where that's literally impossible. It just makes you come off looking like a tool. So stop it. It would be like if someone said man, the homework was tough last night, and you said WELL IF YOU DIDNT WANT HARD HOMEWORK WHY DID YOU ENROLL IN THIS ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATH COURSE?
---
It's just a weak, pathetic attempt to flex on somebody. Comes off extremely tacky and self-aggrandizing.
---
OMG I didn't even see that üòÇ. I just thought you were telling someone else to do both!
---
How?
---
Exactly this. What game did these people think they were signing up for?  
---
Classic wow is good because of its lack of balance. Every class is strong in their own unique way. Sure, mages are a lot more utility than other classes but that doesn't mean you change it.
---
Hey everyone, I am a dwarf priest on Herod. Almost LVL 33 but lvling is becoming annoying. 
---
I love PvP but trying to level in stranglethorn and south shore are awful, LVL 40+ Horde constantly killing people at quest givers and surrounding area. 
---
Any suggestions on better way to level. Is just spamming SM dungeon viable to like 38 ?
---
There were skeletons 3 deep in the inn of the unfortunate afkers and other unlucky players 10 minutes after and dozens more outside.
---
I get kinda bummed when I see people mention Classic+, and then talk about adding content that *weve already seen*. 
---
Uldum, Kara, Grim Batol... guys, there are actual decent options for some Classic+ content, do we have to choose the zones that were designed in Cata and retrofit them to feel Classic? 
---
Like Darkwhisper Gorge in Winterspring, The Furlbog Gate in Azshara, The Original Emerald Nightmare, the Karazhan Crypts.
---
Killing Prince Malchezaar again and exploring a zone I‚Äôve already seen sounds fun and all, but if you‚Äôre going to change Classic,  which is a risky idea, why do it with pre-existing content?
---
&gt;adding more stam to pvp gear, like they did the first time?
---
&gt;Targeting crits as the thing to nerf with resilience was just a lazy way to pretend they were giving players more stats by taking stats away.
---
You're basically suggesting getting the same result (doing less damage relative to max HP) via different path.  I don't know how you were able to type that all out without realizing it
---
Why would you go deep into feral and then stop right before the best talent in the tree?
---
Go 0/30/21 or 1/29/21 if you want to pvp
---
It was changed to depend on speed in Wrath. There are some websites like [vanilla](https://vanilla.wiki)wiki that has stuff from both TBC and wrath in it, no clue why.
---
In vanilla it's just flat % on autoattack, you can read this on the poison tooltips too.
---
I leveled as sub in actual classic, everyone is forgetting how amazing ambush is early ,you literally take 70% of a creature's life as long as you have a slow dagger...It's the same for squishies like mages and locks sooo woo!
---
As someone who is maining a Warrior...fucking thank you
---
How do you move using this? I couldn't figure it out
---
the thing is it's pretty impossible to fix. The entire retail is heavily skewed toward horde for years and years and blizzard still hasn't been able to fix it
---
Whats so different at 40? Im actually enjoying controlling the pet around and just manipulating aggro between us, is there a big shift from using multishot/arcane shot with SS up?
---
If it sells for 1.5g then buy it at 35s and flip it.
---
Tbh that's not that easy of a fix, as Blizzard doesn't track addon versions or maintain a central repo.
---
My recent update in Linux with the drivers has caused the client to drop from a normal 300fps range down to about 50-70 at times and it gets stuck there.  Oddly though the /reload UI command seems to release the problem and things return to normal.  It does not matter if the add-ons are removed or added in game, the issue still occurs with the same results and correction.
---
There is an issue with them, I just haven't pinpointed it yet.  Will probably roll back tonight and stop looking for it.
---
I don't have a target
---
Melee can hit ony when she is in the air phase if you use an ability, just not auto hits, the fight has already be broken to absolute bs imo.
---
What drain life rank u use?
---
The graphics were a bit dated already in 2004, but that was by choice, Blizzard always wanted their games accessible for lower end PC hardware.   I am not saying they were bad, i like them, but they were not groundbreaking
---
I understand. I have never been much of a pvp'er since the beginning of gaming. And I think this game has much to offer in terms of pve thankfully. I dont understand the rivalry between horde and alliance as I have not the played the game back in the days. I chose alliance because my friends went for it. But I understand. Thanks. I will definitely keep the tips in mind.
---
god this actually came in handy in my physics class one time....
---
the teacher said copper was made out of copper and iron. I was like sir, don't you mean copper and tin? 
---
felt wrong haha
---
Gnome Mage is dramatically better than Undead Mage. Not even remotely close. Wait until Insignia is released.
---
My new thing in looking for group is asking for regular dungeon runs with no one over a certain level. Sick and tired of steamrolling dungeons lol
---
Sadly on PVE faction and it was a horde that stole my skin. Cant even attack him cos flag down.
---
Its always the hunters too :(
---
It seems they have, yes. Not sure if intentional but I'm lvl 46 warlock atm and I have absolutely no down time and fast kills with the succu.
---
You can use instances to get ahead in later zones. I didn't seriously quest in STV until 35+, and then I ended up farming SM until 40, now I'm in Tanaris, questing until the minimum level for the instance, then I can run it a bunch with my group and over level for quests in the area. Then, I can either run the instance again after getting the quest XP, or move on to another zone of similar level (Tanaris to Feralas for example), and then quest there until quests start hitting my level, then I run instances again until the next tier.

Maybe it's just the water that have the time fishes? Summer/winter one.

Saving for later
---
Im looking at my warrior, and the future of it.    IM a level 21 orc warrior.
---
I have my racial, recklessness, retaliation, and eventually whirlwind.  I am arms specced.
---
I seem to see some potential there for popping all those at once?  Am I wrong, or what would probably be the advised set up for that?  As a orc I try to spend more time smashing and less time with dem big fancy words. but me not THAT kind of orc either so..
---
Dipshits think "escaping" and "snail's pace" are mutually inclusive... it's no wonder they got locked up in the first place.
---
play a pve server
---
lol
---
Buy 4 10 slot bags ASAP.  They are fairly cheap and those extra 8 - 16 slots will pay for themselves way before you ever reach level 40.  
---
As far as what you should keep, that's up to you.  Anything white has value to someone.  But keep in mind, just because it CAN sell on the AH, doesn't mean it will.  I spent about an hour farming Blue Pearls, because they were going for 90s each on my server.  I farmed 50 of the things, which would have helped me tremendously with my level 40 mount.  None of them have sold, despite there being over a dozen listings from other people on the AH which would normally indicate some kind of decent market.  The lesson: just because it can be used by someone, doesn't mean it will sell on the AH.
---
Yeah really lol it's not hard to just get up every once in a while, shouldn't need to set hard and fast rules to make sure you dont die lol.
---
Yea, we're good enough that we don't need any help. :&gt; Send all the help to our tall but somewhat dimwitted friends.
---
Cool story bro
---
You get mana by meleeing a mob with judgement of wisdom on. Wand doesnt work.
---
Remove 'charge' in the beginning.
---
I think I'm 2/5 with the regular version. So cool when they actually work
---
Loving my level 23 Gnome Warlock, but recently due to work Ive only been able to play about 1 hour or less a weekday. I feel like now I dont know whats the best way to level? If I just grind mobs I get bored and I feel like its not the best xp per hour. If I quest, I feel like I spend a majority of my time planing on what quest im going to focus on and where Im going to go, then I have to travel there which takes some time. On weekends I run dungeons for fun and xp but I cant do that in a hour. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
---
Word. It just sucks wasting combo points. They don't transfer when you switch targets. I will spend them on SND when it isn't up but sometimes you just need to dump a 3 CP Evis.
---
Remember when people thought that was going to be for player housing?
---
So I was totaly wrong and understood it the other way around.
---
Don't we all know that it will take them 7 expansions for that thunder to end in rain ?
---
Season 5 DK was something I definitely considered and it's probably the only thing that has ever come close. I was a career warrior player up until S5... that was really the first time I felt fucking useless lol. It literally killed PvP for a lot of people.
---
Still don't think it was as OP as vanilla warrior across the entire breadth of what the game offers though. Part of that is a product of the way vanilla is designed but you do have to look at it relative to its own era.
---
Dont loot the mobs. They cant skin them until you you loot them.
---
volatility is  insane wool was selling for 50s yesterday morning, by evening it was back down to 15s
---
H
---
Couple of things.  
---
Also made a toplevel comment so won't add suggestions i wrote there :)  
---
but...  
---
how about things to do without having to touch your mouse?
---
`/todo add "Get FP on Ratchet"`
---
Add in categories  
---
Making giving the option to collapse them, so you can make a list of todo's for your profession but being able to hide that, or at least minimize the info of it on screen at times.
---
Also once an item is added give it an identifier, just some number that goes up.  
---
Then you can also remove items  
---
`/todo rm &lt;id&gt;`
---
Keep it up, wish I had the patience to do what you do :)
---
&gt; You know that the game did not looked like this back in 2005?
---
There is an option in the video settings to make the game look like it used to, which from the slider of 1-10 is equivalent to 3, however, I barely notice any kind of difference between 3 and 10, some things are slightly sharper, some shadows are slightly better, and there's a lot more grass. That's literally it.
---
This isn't a difference of Skyrim 2011 vs Ultra Modded Skyrim 2019, therefore it really doesn't matter one bit.
---
shadow priest. If they were even remotely good they probably would have won
---
&gt;hardcore ERP
---
That's not the point you are suppose to role play two factions at war. Not /wave simulator
---
Allowing Warlocks and stuff to play their class isn't remotely similar to having 60 people in a single raid.  Shit was asinine 15 years ago and it still is now, with new bugs to boot!
---
I honestly ran it for the first time this week, I just looked up a map online and went the fastest route to get to the bosses.
---
Throwing rocks near me is a war worthy action!
---
yeah that's actually what the first mmorpg does to one. doesnt have to be the greatest game of all time, the first mmorpg is just magical. feel you.
---
You know you have a hearthstone so you can go home whenever you want, right?
---
You also have to kill all dragons, else they will add during the fight.
---
I wouldn't
---
It's bugged and was not fixed tell pre-bc patch. I have mentioned it before on this sub but get told AIN'T PRIVATE SERVERS BRO b.c they have no idea it's just not working and the bugged version of reckoning is live as it never was fixed in that patch.
---
Get him a job. That will help slow down leveling.
---
I'm a 23 warrior now in classic. I started playing WoW with BC and stopped with WoTLK becaue it got too much for me. I took it seriously and started affecting my real life, so I stopped. I got back into it because of classic and am having fun. I never played Alliance and never played this version (as i started with BC) and it feels like a new experience for me. That being said. I don't worry about leveling anymore. I am focusing on quests, grouping  with random people, getting into the lore, running dungeons with my guildies. That's just me. I mean, its a game. Make it fun. Just my opinion
---
Oh, I've totally missed that. Havnt raided yet so I've not been close to buff caped
---
I like the different tiers of BiS lists that people treat as sacred. "Sorry I need, this is my pre-raid, pre P2, pre-UBRS/LBRS BIS!!!!!!". Every drop is somebody's "BiS". 
---
Also the term "BiS" just doesn't really apply to Classic as much as retail. Doing the most single target boss damage and sacrificing all else isn't always best (unlike retail). Generally people who are so tied up in their "BiS" are retail heroes from my experience.
---
Same but kids
---
I like it! There is another todo list on the twitch app but it isn't as clean and hasnt been updated in a while.
---
My wishlist for the app (that I haven't seen yet): 
---
* Transparency options for the background
---
* A "complete all done items" button
---
* Font size/color options
---
* Sync lists across characters option
---
Between Naxx and Uldum would be better I guess? 
---
A new area in Ulduar might work as the 20man for Ulduar otherwise. 
---
So much rich lore there :)
---
Now there is the question of where tin came from
---
that assumes faction balance is 50/50 across all servers. Is that the case?
---
So here I am, growing older all the time
---
The Venture Co tell different stories...
---
Yeah it's been happening to me too. Best option I've found is backing up my WTF folder every session I play.
---
not getting a restealth unless you're literally standing next to LoS. Trivial for a mage to cancel block and then the fight is over with the rogue at far range. 
---
Seriously it's just funny how many people don't realise that mages shit on rogues unless the rogue is 60 with a prep spec.
---
People that abused it got the items removed and temp banned
---
Hamstring and run away... Fear, etc
---
If you ain't fishin', you cain't playin'
---
Could you expand on the Feign Death + Trap issue please?
---
Found this old screen shot from my early WoW days, and it put a smile on my face
---
Give yourself all the raid loot as well without rolling
---
What's a bitcoin poodle
---
I just tried it out and it didn't work, unless I messed something up.  I'm guessing they fixed this between the beta and the official classic release.
---
That's not what is going on here.
---
Blizzard has done a lot to reduce time involved in specific tasks but has ramped up difficulty in various areas.  The issue with this and why Classic is so popular right now, is that people want to feel like they earned what they have.  When loot is handed out like candy, you have no feeling of accomplishment.  It becomes more of just pulling a lever to see if the next loot is better.
---
My priest went 16 levels without upgrading their bracers because I didn't see anything that would be viable or I lost those roll.  A BoE green dropped last night and I immediately needed it because it was clear upgrade for my playstyle.  That just doesn't happen in retail.   You are constantly swapping gear for better gear and even your quest rewards ensure you have all the pieces you need.
---
It's not layering out in the open world that's the problem here, it's dungeon and raid resetting issues. Layering in the open world was already adressed by blizzard, Ziqo nor Venruki used did dungeon and raid 'layering'
---
Thanks for the grinding tip. Will definitely try it
---
You got me! Now I see you're joking. :P
---
*Hey, is that thread where the topic isn't about hating on streamers?? Man, im gonna have to change that right away.*
---
Druid and Paladin can tank and heal, albeit they can‚Äôt tank as well as warrior and can‚Äôt heal as well as a Priest. Shaman can heal or dps. So either start up a Warrior or Druid, or continue on with your shaman, priest or Paladin.
---
I see your FF9 reference!
---
You're a bad bad man.
---
I have no remorse for STV horde after farming bloodscalp tusks at 32.
---
Cooking, and first aid is all you need to worry about when lvling, I save those professions until after I get my mount.
---
He does, but you're not him :-D
---
To be fair, classic itself was a fan wet dream.
---
To reply, boe wise, the 'best' i got was ardent custodian the 38 mace and it sold for 25g. Besides i got some shit blue leather with int, helm and chest that sold for 3-4g each. That's the most i got from boe's. Not mining so i can't comment on thorium.
---
Usually anyone who posts pictures or videos they've taken themselves is doing it mainly for the attention. Doesn't really surprise me that they're more focused on ego-stroking than the actual game.
---
There's a classic version of elvui
---
This is the opposite feeling: [https://i.imgur.com/aA76dlC.png](https://i.imgur.com/aA76dlC.png)
---
A day isn‚Äôt a day without killing alliance scum
---
Dude look at chance the druid videos and ebbnflow videos, w/e you can find. Analyze timings of things, when to use big cooldowns when to back off and when to go ham. When you watch enuf duel videos you realize that each class is fought a bit differently, and its all a rock paper scissors game with your CDs and theirs.
---
Find some dudes of all classes near your lvl and duel the crap outta people, you learn a ton this way and you start to learn the right move against each class.
---
Other peeps may disagree but when learning id weigh stamina pretty heavy that way if you fudge up once or twice in a fight you'll have the health to recover and come back.
---
What server you on? Im 28 sham and id practice dueling all you want. 
---
You will become the bane of the allys existence.
---
And then, if somehow you manage to kill a DK, they come back as a ghoul and explode in your face. (admittedly, this ability was fun to use)
---
I think if you use your survival cooldowns rogues can be really good, but if you get caught with your pants down (no CDs left) you're done for.
---
How is mob grinding like this on a rogue? Considering going rogue with my love for monk in legion but unsure
---
No he should have gouged immediately after the CS, and the fight would have been over.
---
Correct. The rain in BfA in zones other than Zuldazar isn't as intense. It's also much easier on the eyes and each raindrop isn't as thick as paper towel tube like the rain in Classic.
---
This is super rare! Find the leprechaun and kill it and he drops a chest of gold that vendors for 1000 gold! :P
---
Still seems off. I'm a little over 10 days played and am level 60, did MC, have Tailoring and Enchanting to 300, and am farming my epic mount.  
---
This includes quite a bit of afking to avoid queues. Can you post a screenshot of your /played with your character?
---
The reason people oppose this is it will just divide the community across multiple servers and see the population decline. They are already dividing the playerbase across retail and classic, if they have 3-4 active channels it will cause server population hell.
---
No you don't :(
---
I made this video and send a bug Report in through all channels   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPKj3FqZ5H4&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPKj3FqZ5H4&amp;t=1s) Its been a while since that but we will see if they will be able to fix it with some attention to it.
---
Some people genuinely want to help others. If i were mage i would not mind giving people some free water/food if im just standing around in town doing nothing. If im busy thou i might just not reply.
---
Preach
---
I like the atmosphere of it for a while but I've gone entire sessions leveling in multiple zones where it is raining and between the oppressiveness of it and the limited visibility it starts to become so draining that I need to just log off.
---
I mean I can‚Äôt really tell you which is ‚Äúbest‚Äù but I went herb/alch, the potions and elixirs help during leveling. Any extra herbs sell pretty well on the AH too.
---
Yesterday there was an important looking post about this here. It seems heavily bugged.
---
How did you find leveling as boomkin after lvl 40 when the form is available? Does it become any easier or do you still need to drink every few mobs?
---
I struggle with letting go too I suppose, in the last few retail expansions I have been moonkin and dabbled in moonkin for BC and WOTLK so I'm very attached to the fluffy fuckers
---
after pulling half the farmers in hillsbrad because I healed someone that had tons of aggro and was about to die, I too rez instead of heal if they have more than 2 mobs attacking them. people still seem grateful or at the very least mute, so it seems to be just as good.
---
But full scale war is fun..
---
Bro Kirtonos is rough
---
But can it run Crisis?
---
Bag making is very saturated, but you have a good point on skinning, and that's how I've paid for just about everything so far. Leathers have brought in good enough money to pay for skills and wands and things here and there. I will take your advice on tailoring. Thanks
---
Oh my God! STOP PRESSING THE BUTTON!!
---
I went into duskwood the other night and slaughtered everyone.
---
Its alright, I kill most horde solely because I feel like it.
---
I'm pretty sure i killed someone with that or a similar name in stv last week
---
Or maybe.... gnome homo?
---
i just like the horde-alliance war. can't imagine that someone actually "hates" the other faction. would be the same experience when rolling the other faction so wtf lol
---
Run down the hill, keep left after bridge, trainer outside on left of building. I think lol
---
Where exactly does it say ‚Äúomg dont ban me‚Äù?
---
I want to level a shadow priest for pvp. Back in Wotlk they were crazy fun and OP in pvp from like lvl 30-40. Is that the case for classic? Do i have enough dps at 60 to take out the best pvp classes? Or any general knowledge on how shadow plays would be helpful
---
It's funny that a lot of the unfinished content came in Cata. Uldum, Grim Batol, Hijal. I'd like to see them utilize those zones if they elect to do Classic+, that way the inevitable TBC and WotLK are fairly unaffected.
---
No, and it will never be accurate. The drop rates you see are extrapolated through reported drops vs kills; by players running certain add-ons. The only way the drop rate would be accurate is if Blizz released the actual algorithm used to determine which item drop.
---
Except its not.
---
He hasn't learned that Paladins hard counter enhance shamans yet.
---
It‚Äôs not an Artisan fishing bug. There are 4 different loot tables depending on the time of day. One of the loot tables is currently empty so there is a 6 hour period where fishing in the ocean gives no loot. I know this is the problem because I tested right as the loot table was changing and went from getting no fish to the proper fish.
---
Arsenical bronze?  Crazy.
---
Yeah mana is a problem. But if you want to mainly PvP you could keep the spriest and level something else to PvE with. 
---
I'd go with Warlock personally.  They are a beast in PvP, and people like them to PvE with since you can summon.
---
Finding them ain't the issues. Finding one with an actual shell is the problem. Like, seriously, how do all these turtles not have shells?
---
Hows that different from most other dungeons though? Gnomer starts at like 24 but boss is 32 or something. Uldaman is like 38-48.
---
Your analogy reflects your base understanding of what is happening here.  That is exactly the appropriate reply when someone bitches about doing something they chose to do.  When I see someone whine because they don't like the effects of their own decision, it is right to remind them that is was, after all, their decision.  I am not dumb enough to get sucked into your internet tough guy pissing match, I don't call for help because it is easier and quicker to escape from a camper than enlist some random for aid.  It is sad that you think someone voicing an opinion that runs counter to the echohamber must be engaging in some kind of flex, and to mislabel is as so come of as infantile.  Misinterpret this how you will, I know your doublethink won't allow the actual message through.
---
What is your strat for pvp? Do you got full moonkin or split into resto/feral?
---
Okay dude go back to playing Pokemon TCG like a 5 year old
---
Awesome I'll check it out thank you!
---
Omg the old druid sets unnnnghhhh. I never got this in my vanilla Druid. This is what I want to complete.
---
Well, its a necessary evil. Without layers launch would have been 10x the clusterfuck it was, and there would be 10x the servers there are now, which means in a few months when the hype/novelty dies down and people start moving on, you would have 10x the desolate low pop servers that need to be merged into one another.
---
It think having layers in the game is fine, and the plan has been for them to be temporary.  The mistake Blizzard made is underestimating the amount they would be abused, and I also think they underestimated the volume of players, I think they thought they would be able to trim back almost all of them, but on your Herod, Stalagg, Faeralina, and other big servers, removing layering would exasperate the current pop issues.
---
Got 60 on Herod first week as a hunter.  When I started doing LBRS/UBRS I‚Äôd get blamed for a ton of stuff I didn‚Äôt even do.  It was hilarious.
---
This vid made me wanna make a mage lol
---
With that little time I would stop worrying about logging out in an inn. Just log out right in the middle of quests if you need to. When you get on the next day you just keep rolling with the quests you were on immediately.
---
Sure you are losing out on rested exp, but you could be saving upwards of 30 minutes a day on travel time.
---
‚ÄúNo you don‚Äôt‚Äù to what part of my statement?
---
If you‚Äôre in a competent group/raid, then every other caster, including shadow priests, are a higher priority than you for innervate. If you just want to be a Retailer and pad the meters then sure, you can innervate yourself. But if you‚Äôre looking to do your designed role as a balance Druid and support your group for quicker and easier kills, you‚Äôll innervate someone else.
---
‚Äú5 minutes‚Äù is a joke. Even with innervates and mana pots on yourself. That‚Äôs just not true. Nobody can spam a max rank prime dps or heal spell for 5 minutes.
---
A quick sim says in pre-bis gear you can cast 18 starfires in a row with luck on your side, before going OOM. That‚Äôs roughly a minute of combat.
---
You‚Äôre also ignoring the fact that all you CAN do as a 60 moonkin is cast starfire since you won‚Äôt be casting moonfire.
---
I don‚Äôt care about raid viability, I personally play a shadow priest, but the conversation was about ‚Äúfun‚Äù. If you find 18 starfires to be fun, go for it.
---
I had a nice time questing there last night as alliance on Stallagg.
---
Only got jumped once, killed the guy, and then when I chased him down a second time he begged and I left him alone after that.
---
Unfortunately, it doesn't disable join/leave, and I find it very odd that it doesn't also do that or that there isn't an option to disable it separately.
---
Chad Shaman.
---
Sounds good too me. Should get things done instead of role playing a vending machine.
---
I get monies into oblivion for voicing my opinion so this is my last on this topic.
---
Any new content just for classic is breaking vanilla experience. New items or itemizations could lead to changes in pvp or classes a simple mp5 plate def fear could lead to paladin tanks being bid for raids or something. Risk is insane so why would they do it. It would be stupid.
---
Would not mind a certain underwater zone coming back. Love Vashj'ir.
---
Meh we did SM Cath and Arm with a group that had a warrior tank, enhancement shaman, frost mage (me), a hunter and priest for heals, and despite myself and the hunter being low (Morg was red to us), and everyone other than the priest below 40. we chain pulled and smoked that place. I'm not sure how running it with a bunch of mages would of been faster since we were taking giant pulls easily.
---
Everything in that video was an expected part of the game by its design.
---
I would say your play was optimal in fact. You used the monster to weaken the opponent then finished them off and take the tag back for an easy kill.
---
Well played.
---
Warrior code. Just don't be a coward piece of sh1t.
---
My experience in classic is the horde wants to level in peace unless they outnumber you. Then they want to fight.
---
1v1, 2v2, etc? Nope.
---
&gt; feign death would take you out of combat, thus allowing you to place a trap, this is actually NOT how it worked in Vanilla
---
This has to be 100% false. I raided regularly as a hunter in Vanilla (not private server), and it was **common** practice to feign death mid boss fight and drink water. Something you can't do unless out of combat.
---
Feign Death would take you out of combat instantly in vanilla.
---
I know from practice, easily 2000+ hours of solely hunter main in vanilla. 
---
I couldn't imagine ever playing a hunter without FD out of combat mechanic.
---
Wish I had taken videos back in the day to prove this point, alas I did not, so it is only my word against others.
---
you are in luck! there are a lot of different ways you can effectively level.  I've been using https://classicwow.live/leveling with good success early on, but now I find I use classic codex more (lvl 34). You can also spend some time crafting &amp; AH'ing to get that $$$. I buy my mats on the cheap and make sure the finished product has high turnover and turns a profit on the AH.
---
Found the guy on top of the cage in Gadgetzan.
---
Was in STV and was being ganked - well everyone was - by a 50+ priest. Had skull anyway.  
---
Just said in gen chat 'why is this f\*\*\*\*\*g lvl 60 or whatever priest killing everyone in stv'  
---
'why you whining about pvp on a pvp server'
---
'no war mode here kid'
---
/sigh
---
Sure, but not much more. The crit chance is what makes it scary. Still, one or two crits from that is less damage than I‚Äôd take from everything else.
---
&gt;&gt;filthy gnome
---
The thing about this is that when I used to play Alliance I found gnomes to be endearing, and loved playing a gnome mage. Now that I am part of the Horde, they look like nasty vermin and I can‚Äôt help but want to murder every one of them.
---
My Nemesis macro has paid dividends so far
---
/tar [name]
---
anyone who ganks me goes on it, and when i pass an alliance i hit the macro real quick to see if they're on it.
---
2 or 3 dieing actually. Man has a pet remember :p
---
That's awesome, ty. Didn't realize I could move the slider first time I saw that page!
---
Bye.  Classic+ would gain many new players to replace you.  All the "no change" guys think that they are the majority.  Maybe for now.  
---
Wait until all the vanilla content has exausted the player base.  People will be begging for more content.  There is a reason they made TBC.  People wanted more content.
---
Shows his level as green to you.  What was the gap?
---
Oh shit.  I need to remember to grab this tonight for alts at least.  I seem to remember it taking up a bit more space than i'd like when i used it back in Wrath, but it was fucking awesome for leveling!
---
Question about this staff. Can you change it back and forth between healing and dps version or once you change it you can't change it back?
---
Yeah and if that doesn't work, try grabbing the last driver directly from Nvidia's site and performing and clean install. The rollback seemed to be hit and miss.
---

You can gouge after you cheap shot and if they blink they will be gouged at the end of it
---
WAIT I HAVE A STORY FOR THIS.
---
Last night I was in my bags trying to figure out my inventory, paying no attention to the world around me, and when I closed my bags a warrior dropped dead right in front of me. I felt terrible because I could have healed them if I wasn‚Äôt so distracted, so I used my last maple seed to res them. They stuck around for about an hour helping me kill off mobs if I pulled too many, or they swooped in to help me if they saw me coming out of animal form to panic heal. They told me they were repaying their debt to me since I used a seed on them and it was the nicest thing ever - not even a RP server üòÇ
---
Skin them yourself?
---
Press on them as soon as you loot em
---
Its easy
---
!remindme 8 hours
---
Try reinstalling the game I guess
---
That's the core of the issue.  
---
Haste vs Crit vs Mastery is not an interesting choice.  All three provide more dps.  It's a math problem to determine which is the best value.  There is no option to weigh.
---
Str vs Sta vs Spirit is interesting.  You're choosing between offensive stats, defensive stats, and resource regeneration.  What you value depends on what type of balance you're wanting to achieve.
---
If the guild isnt streaming, then only manually - track who goes into raid, inspect them after the raid.
---
So, it's like this.
---
You can, more or less, spec any way you like, and get into dungeons for any of the 3 roles.
---
1. Tank
---
   1. Your healer, and possibly the group,  can tell the difference between a tank heavily spec'd into Feral and one who is not. 
---
   2. At least have the gear for tanking.  It's a pretty shitty druid that has spirit and intelligence gear and is trying to tank!
---
2. Healer
---
   1. If you're not heavily spec'd into Resto, you're going to be drinking, A LOT
---
   2. If you're not heavily spec'd into Resto, and your druid tank isn't heavily spec'd into Feral...well, let's just say, you're not going to have fun, or easy time clearing that dungeon.  You will have wipes.....
---
3. DPS
---
   1. As long as you've put at least few points into the Feral tree, properly, for DPS,  you'll be alright.  
---
   2. If you're not heavy into the Feral tree, you will NOT be the best DPS.  In most cases, you won't even be 2nd on the meter.  You'll likely be 3rd on the DPS meter.
---
End-game, Raid Leaders, (Good Raid Leaders), are paying attention to everything, or at least logging it for future analysis.  They know who is a good DPS and who is slacking.  They know who is a good Healer, and who is the better healer.  
---
End-game raiding for guilds who are at least semi-serious about end-game content, they min-max raid build-out to maximize their chance at a successful raid.
---
If you're going to Raid for a semi-serious guild, or hard core raiding guild, you will NOT be a healer, unless your spec'd for it.  You will NOT be DPS, unless you're spec'd for it.  You will NOT be their tank, MT or OT, unless your spec'd for it and geared for it!  Since we lack an Armory for Classic, don't be surprised if someone inspects you and denies you any position on the raid.  For example, if you're the MT or OT, and you're not properly geared, it will be noticed, you will be inspected, and you will be booted from the raid.
---
Theres a guy being carried by the boat but he is in the water
---
Have many more times will I have to see this before I die
---
Did a RF with a total noob tank. At first I tried to give him tips (don't pull-taunt, pull back from distance, use sunder armor for threat...), but the guy was so bad and so slow (it looked like he was watching long version LOTR on a side screen or something) I ended up pulling/tanking most of the dungeon.
---
Also camped a dwarf rogue for a good 1h, punishment for him trying to gank me while pexing.
---
I have 32 points into BM tree with BiS pet for DPS (broken tooth) so he does insane damage on bestial wrath and basically has a 0.7 attack speed due to 5 points into frenzy (once he crits it basically stays up until the fight is done as the fast attack speed procs another crit within 8 seconds).
---
Additionally he has growl from the pet trainer which itself is pretty effective in the pet holding aggro, however intimidation also generates a lot of aggro if a mob is on you, and surprisingly amazing for PVP as it stuns the target for 3 seconds as well.  If, rarely, non of that is effective in holding the aggro then you can just feign death.  One thing I didn't like about pre-lvl 40 is just shooting at the mob for a few seconds before I get aggro for the rest of the fight and spamming raptor strike which doesn't feel like a ranged class.
---
Having this build can also allow you to have a more kiting play style in PVP where you would use aspect of the cheetah to keep your distance from the enemies while your pet drains them a lot quicker than being non-BM specced. Horde rarely focuses on attacking my cat and if they do, I can run fast quickly to get aggro on me again.  Bestial wrath is also immune to polymorph, fear, and other CC effects so I always turn it on when sending my cat in for those annoying clothies.
---
As a bonus, you also get volley (support those AOE runs with mages) and rapid fire
---
I feel this every moment I log in and see all the other warriors around me.
---
I'd reroll but I'm already too deep. :( I just wanted to be a gnome with a big 2handed weapon. I guess I'll go prot at 60...
---
I get that but you can have both weapons lmao
---
It's almost like there is more than 1 other person playing the game.
---
I won't comment on your other class choices, but as a warlock main, sounds like you could be playing warlock better. 
---
If a mob is close to dying, don't cast shadow bolt, cast searing pain or wand them.  
---
In dungeons, probably only use immolate and instant cast corruption. Save agony and siphon life for longer lasting targets like bosses.
---
You also never need to drink. In dungeons you spam life tap and never oom. Your healer should heal you up before next fight just fine.  You don't have to be at full health to engage since you're just dps.
---
I don't mean this condescendingly at all! Just trying to help out.  If you still find the class boring though, best to move on.
---
I can only handle one instance of a dungeon at a time or I burn out
---
Move more though?
---
Out of all the things streamers do this is the least offensive. I imagine questing is impossible when you have masses of people hunting you for the lulz. "ThEy ShOuLd PlAy oN a PvE sErVeR!" No, they're content creators and that affords them less opportunity to create content. Plus I wonder how many of these people who say this play on one of the mega servers? There are like three maybe four actual mega servers in NA right now: Herod, Faerlina, Stalagg and Whitemane. I'm on Whitemane myself and I recently decided to look at queues for all the full servers during peak hours. When I looked there were several "full" servers that didn't even have queues, most of the servers that did have queues were between 100-700 people long. Then there's the mega servers which still sit between 2000-6000 people in their queues (Whitemane seems to always have the longest queue averaging around 4000-6000). There really is an ungodly amount of people on these mega servers. I'm not a streamer and I'm not on the streamer server but there are times when I'm basically forced to dungeon grind because there are so many people in quest areas that quests are next to impossible to complete. I'm talking quests that should only take 10 mins end up taking an hour+ because mobs are being tagged and dying within seconds. Do you know how god damn weird it is to run around STV and literally see no mobs alive?
---
If they do classic+ I hope they don't introduce new big cities. I didn't like Shattrath in TBC and Dalaran in WotLK. OG and SW should always be the place were most 60s hang out
---
Finish the warrior unless you like being a wing man and healing, buffing, cleansing, and using your amazing utility . That‚Äôs it in a nutshell.  I played war in vanilla, I‚Äôd go pally even if boring to level but that‚Äôs just $.02
---
As someone who legitimately enjoys playing Fury, has played it for the past 16 years and is currently slowly and painstakingly leveling through the 30's with none of this spell cleave bullshit I'm really hating what's happening. 60's going to be full of asshole arms warriors who have no idea how to actually play WoW, giving all warrior DPS a bad name and stopping me from getting slots in pugs.
---
It's the rogue/hunter problem all over again, but now it's my class it's way less funny
---
I must be going crazy because I'm sure mine is disabled. Maybe I'm mistaken...
---
I'd do more dungeon runs if the gold was good. Open world quests pay better
---
Seems like youre a possible victim to which i say what goes around comes around
---
I think a lot of people don't understand that you can kill high levels in classic.
---
after a certain point, playing a warrior in pvp is a hack and slash. They can end in absolute murder machines.
---
This would be a wise warning if I weren't already being mobbed on regardless of what I do.
---
Im going off my memory here which really sucks, but i think i had seen something about an afk bear sitting at the entrance or something?
---
Again, i havent looked into it too much.  Just started doing some 5 man runs at 60 now that im holy and people are actually running the dungeons.  Just kind of looking ahead.
---
Sorry I just saw this.  There are diminishing returns yes.  Hit% gain effectively falls off after 305 (the amount you get is practically nil) and while the glancing blow reduction continues, it caps off at 308.  305 is basically the sweet spot, and other stats become better beyond this point, though weapon skill up to 308 is still at least beneficial even if not ideal.
---
Yeah, but rolling a Paladin instead of whatever he already is would be downgrading.
---
Dwarf priest is solid
---
hit the 'wand' key instead of the 'frostbolt' key
---
It's pretty easy to spirit rez or to find a nook/cranny near your corpse and hearth out.  
---
It can be frustrating getting ganked though.  But if you sign up for a PVP server you should know what you are getting into.
---
I just jumped on it? It wasn't too difficult.
---
HAHA. FUCK THEM.
---
What about for the debuffs under the enemy health bars?
---
I'm most excited to hit 60 so I can lower the time I need to play :X
---
ah. ty.
---
Barber shop? I'm ok with it... Achievments? Also ok...
---
More Npcs? No.
---
New raids/etc? No.
---
Class balance? Kinda... But no.
---
He switched to you even though he only had a sliver of health left and just watched you D E L E T E his friend, instead of running. He has more honor than you ever will.
---
As a low level levelling warrior, i can confirm that your feelings of love rach me via those buffs. Keep upt he good work.
---
So much stupidity in the AH, lucky me I found a 20g/hour farm that doesn't involve the AH at level 40.
---
It'll be returned to you after 30 days. If you fail to pick it up 30 days after that (60 days total) it will disappear.
---
MMMMM
---
Dire maul patch started killing the game not tbc.
---
Yea but it was fun actually using them outside dungeons and doing something different than the infinite hamstring kite.
---
I would pay the 5G in a heartbeat and respec to drain tanking at level 31.  
---
5G is nothing once you start moving and leveling, and you will make it back quickly with how much money you save not buying drinks and you'll also be moving much quicker.
---
No one lived to tell the tale unfortunately.
---
The intent of layering was to handle large populations.  The exploit is using it to skip the respawn mechanics or avoid other players.  The respawn times are a game mechanic, and skipping them is an exploit.
---
STV for example is hard because both factions are competing for limited spawns.  If you can just hit pass on that, you're not playing the same game.
---
That's what an exploit is.
---
Classic raider for 11 whole days.  Wow.
---
I leveled a restro druid alt in vanilla and in TBC I levelled a prot warrior. I'm doing the same again now, currently leveling prot warrior (level 48) and once I'm 60 I'm gonna level a resto druid. 
---
Why? Because I like these specs and enjoy playing them and I enjoy doing these roles in dungeons. Sure I can easily heal or tank with a dps spec, but it's more fun and more convenient in the right spec.
---
Solo questing takes a little longer but I'm in no rush so it doesn't really bother me much. I don't even have a 2hand weapon for my warrior. Every 2hand skill is still at skill 1. Well except 2hand mace, which is like skill 30 because that's when I switched to 1 hand/shield at level 8 or something.
---
My post is satire in itself. I dont care what they do, as long as they are happy but im gonna post the meme either way
---
The Devilsaur Mafia has always been a thing. I doubt it‚Äôs gonna be any different in Classic.
---
Kromcrush doesn't have 90% horde lol you are delusional
---
 #NoChanges
---
mom's spaghetti
---
You can actually go there by going to the uninstanced version of stratholme. It's green with an elf tower and over the mini map it says "quel thalas".
---
I was in that guild for like 3 hours thats hilarious i didn't know thwy started to recruit like that üòÇüòÇ
---
&gt;Well the honor system is retroactive
---
That heavily implies ranks, not just kills.
---
You run OOM very fast but have burst. Make friends with mages and get lots of water. Rest is pretty easy
---
Unarmed black cow
---
Because people who fish are weak
---
But it is a nice polite touch to try and find other players to join in.
---
He should've moved away and let the mage stay busy with the raptors and re-stealth.
---
He basically got a free ice block out of the opener, the mage will be forced to frost nova the raptors and thats the window to go in again and force the blink, now he has 4 CP and the mage has no nova so he can sprint on his face and land a full CP kidney and finish him off, he didnt even need vanish.
---
Yeah, for anyone that wants to rush around in a dark, constricted area for hours on end in order to join the top percentage of players in PUGging the two raids that are on offer. :P Or you can just play the game and enjoy yourself.
---
AYEE! I hope to see you on the battlefield, brother.
---
Interesting. Can you explain the GCD part a little 
---
more? What do you mean by others using two GCDs?
---
Sorry, didn't mean to hurt your feelings with that statement, no need to resort to kindergarten playground insults.
---
That was the only one a got. What are the others?
---
Well, optimal shaman leveling is this: lightning shield, make sure the weapon enchant is active, pull with lightning bolt, and auto attack. Don't cast a single spell unless you're at full mana somehow
---
ClassicAuraDurations
---
I agree with the sentiment, but I don't think this is the way the devs or the player base actually want the game to go. I think the horizontal content aspect is fine, but after three years of MC, does the average player really want to have to drag their new friends/alts through it to gear them up? I think we have a skewed answer to that question because we are mostly vanilla fanatics here, but once you're outside the scope of #nochanges vanilla as it was, you kinda have to take into consideration what the player base might want or expect. I don't know what the correct path is. I get a feeling that they just want to do TBC onward if the players are down for it.
---
Good to hear, many people didn't. So many Alliance tears.
---
Put these people on ignore so they have issues grouping at 60.
---
I fish so that I dont waste all my money on food and can stay in combat longer.
---
I struggle to see how abusing layers is any different then rearranging your life so you play only at night/early morning when there a minimum players. At layering is well known unlike the 10instance groups.
---
Should be everyone.
---
&gt; Do most right handed people spin left?
---
Yes, if they move with the wrist. From a neutral positions, most people have more fine grained movement control moving their hands towards their body center (left for right handed people, right for left handed people).
---
I am not entirely sure, but it might be anatomical or something in the way we are taught to write with pens.
---
I noticed that in my Quake 3 days and did some predicting on where players would end up based on them being right or left handed. Worked out quite well considering it was only a stupid theory :D
---
this has nothing to do with my post
---
Was YouTube just a gank-fest?
---
~~Tell me more about how strong shadow priests are so I feel good about my choices pls~~
---
Incendious alliance does the same lol. They were pretty much running a train on thorium point all last night.
---
I don't remember the exact syntax, but there is an "exists" tag that you can add so the first check fails. Might want to include a "nohelp" or "harm" as well for situations where your target is targeting a friend.
---
At higher levels, skinning does sell decently and quickly on AH because fewer people are high enough to provide the skins and they're needed for various endgame gear and bag recipes. Plus skinning is super easy since tons of mobs both solo and especially in dungeons are skinnable. Worst case scenario with skinning you get vendor price which is still easy money for things you're killing anyway.
---
Ya what do you do when the mage blinks away?  Can't charge in combat, waddling around cold slowed, mage is doing /dance while tossing random damage spells
---
Yeah sure! Its gonna be awhile haha but skullflame while amazing, probably isn‚Äôt achievable for myself haha. Green tower is going for 20-30g on my server at the moment so not too bad! Also planning to be engineer ha
---
It's pretty frustrating when even a WC group won't take anyone under 20. It's the new raider.io score. :p
---
The Virgin min-maxer and the Chad Immersion.
---
Did you grind?
---
That is what I have done.  Almost done now.  I just through on a creepy story youtube channel and listen while I go.
---
The odd thing is noticing my drop patterns.  Beasts in general are the money makers.  Cloth drops just aren't that profitable, but grey beast drops have been consistent gains.
---
One very odd thing to happen was blue drops.  They are rare, but I had three blue drops from three mobs in a row at one point in my 40s.  The odds of that have to be astronomical.  Like 1 in a billion.
---
Yes! 
---
No new zones outside of Eastern kingdoms or Kalimdor pls. I don't want the main continents being empty again
---
Yes, but if you forgot how time works phase 1 still has to happen before we leave it. at the earliest we get phase 2 after blizzcon.
---
same shit
---
Link?
---
&gt;Boomers (in this context) are the generation who were about that same age but during vanilla. Boomers are basically younger people (high 20‚Äôs-30‚Äôs) who uphold more of the values of the baby boomer generation ‚Äî owns a home, mowing their lawn, drinks sugar free energy drinks, washing the car that kind of thing.
---
Close, "boomer" itself refers to actual baby boomers (late 50s to 70+ year olds), but the "30 year old boomer" meme is "boomer" prefaced by a younger age to usually shit on a millennial that's acting like a baby boomer (being wildly out of touch with society and basically acting like their boomer parents). Zoomer is the same for Gen Z, it's Gen Z-ers trying to act like they're not part of that gen and are very out of touch with their own generation.
---
Yeah, not big on conversations either. I‚Äôm usually in discord with IRL friends and typically join guilds they are in. Outside of that I only join discord for guild groups and not just running around. That being said, I found joining a smaller guild and you eventually make friends with people you run with often. I‚Äôm married to my raid leader from wrath. Funny we were both hunters, she was better geared than me for obvious reasons. Still spanked her on the dps meters in raid. She came to me for guidance and it evolved from there.
---
Yeh id love to play paladin tank which was fine in tbc even though still worse than warr or druid but amazing heroic tank while atm i just cant even look at prot paladin.
---
Im in fairbanks, he lied. I‚Äôve never had under an hour when trying at 6.
---
Jesus christ this is awful even if it is satire.
---
Hello...me?
---
I was on my 40 NE hunter in STV, questing on the Skullsplitter trolls.  The horde were all being pretty chill, and we were pretty much ignoring each other so we could get our quests done.
---
I spotted a troll with a panther pet, so I opened up on him.  For some reason, the panther aggroed to me, even though my pet had been screeching.  Then I got a hunter's mark and serpent sting on me.  "Have they given up the truce?" I thought.  I was getting ready to start kiting the pet, but I didn't see another beast coming for me.  I thought it was a strange ganking attempt.
---
That's when I realized, I wasn't attacking a Skullsplitter Beast Master and his Skullsplitter Panther.  I was attacking a troll hunter with a panther pet.
---
I was going to wait for him to come back so I could /sorry
---
He GY rezzed.
---
I felt bad.
---
Mine is similar in size, but less hairy.
---
I was told paternity leave would leave me with time for things like WoW, gosh darnit!
---
&gt; I get a feeling that they just want to do TBC onward if the players are down for it.
---
It's the most likely and easiest route.
---
They'd probably do TBC and then evaluate whether or not to do an edited Wrath (no dungeon finder, etc) or stop there or take a new approach entirely.
---
Blade Flurry and the Adrenaline Rush or whatever almost melt enemies too fast. Like, the challenge is getting the mobs together and surviving while you pop cooldowns and melt em down. 
---
Was grouping with a priest last night, which was cool, except for when they'd fear my little lined up packs of soon to be melted mobs. It's a bad feeling to pop blade Flurry and orc power and adrenaline rush only to kill one guy and have to chase down three others running God knows where. To be fair, holding aggro with a priest around as a rogue can be tough.
---
&gt;	Oh, so then you're just an asshole all the time. got it.
---
Better than being a child incapable of having a discussion without resorting to name calling like yourself.
---
This is so true... Anytime I put on a streamer they are in a raid group in a dungeon... 99% of the time.
---
Soooo boring.
---
Yep, was a viable tactic for tanks in vanilla.
---
PvP servers create encounters with people that are more genuine.
---
Say you're on a PvE server and a group full of dicks run through a lowbie area to get to a dungeon. You're on the opposite faction.
---
They run past you, unable to act against you. 
---
Now say a group of cool people run past you on the way to the same dungeon.
---
They run past you, without bothering you because they're not dicks.
---
You don't think about either of these interactions, they're just people who can't do anything to you not doing anything to you.
---
Now say you're on a PvE server.  A group of dicks runs past you and veers off course just to one-shot you before continuing on to their dungeon.  You think to yourself "What a bunch of dicks".
---
Now say a bunch of respectable people run past you, they stop briefly and continue on, noticing you but not killing you for no reason.  You think to yourself "Wow, I'm glad those guys were cool enough not to kill me for no reason even though they could have."
---
In the latter case, the guys just running past WITHOUT ganking, there's a bigger emotional response when it's on a PvP server, even when in both a PvE server and a PvP server the action is the same, just because in the PvP situation they choose not to kill you, while in the PvE server you have no idea what they would do if they could.
---
This doesn't mean that the ganker isn't a jerk.  It just means that the jerks get to kind of be a bit more invisible on a PvE server, at least until they get into your groups.
---
And then people switching layers to get them all.
---
Most likely? Where have we gotten this impression?
---
Is that fine for raiding as well? Or just dungeons?
---
My statement was meaning, basically, that I didn't realize how many people would roll warrior, so I guess at end game I'll tank instead of DPS so that the oversaturation doesn't matter as much.
---
I have no interest in replicating private server mechanics. My understanding of Reckoning in Vanilla was that paladins could store charges and unleash multiple attacks at once, up to five. I don't recall this being removed until TBC. Am I mistaken?
---
Or use Eyes of the Beast, jump the pet down, command to stay, jump down yourself.
---
Than why are you complaining? Just talking to the wind?
---
Not intensing to do this one a lot. I just need those damn Triprunner Dungarees
---
I think a lot of players probably just do it habitually but it prevents parrying, makes it easier to tell when you pull threat, keeps the tank's FOV clear (not got a bunch of people on top of him), and keeps you out of any frontal AOE
---
I do that out of laziness
---
I really have not make any money with professions, I got Cassandra's Grace which sold for 120g, the rest I pick everything and sell it to vendor, unless is a green which can be sell for more I out in AH. I have all the leather I collected in my bank.
---
I didn't see a working copy of elvui, is there a confirmed working site with it?
---
If you want jack of all trades, absolutely go 0/30/21. You'll be a pretty damn good kitty/bear and still halfway decent at healing.  
---
Hopefully by the time people start raiding they'll realize the old mentalities over viable DPS classes just weren't true. You can actually do decent DPS in cat form, or you can tank just fine in bear form. My guild back in vanilla was more willing to experiment and we had no problems with Druids doing DPS or tanking. That said, you won't be doing your raid any favors if you are popping in and out of forms all the time, you'll mostly be doing one form except in emergencies.
---
Have you tried it since the big update last week? Apparently they made it way more coherent and less "run back and forth across the world"
---
I'm only 18 stuck in the Barrens still so I can't really say myself, although I've quite often hit "Grind until next level" steps despite having all of Silverpine open to me. Maybe that zone is just bad but I don't know, but grinding for half a level as Warrior in quest greens and whites is also not very fast
---
Calling rogue scum while playing the most OP class possible and AoE grinding? Come on.
---
So my social anxiety is pretty bad, I did end up joining a guild and everyone in a while I'll throw a comment in chat, but I just can't bring myself to chat on a regular basis. Forming groups for quests comes down to " does that group of people invite me?" "Nope, ok I'll just continue fighting for mob spawns." And then when I do get into group I'm extremely quite unless it's necessary for me to say something.
---
Honestly I feel my experience is somewhat hampered by it but I'm still having fun, so here's hoping I can get out of my shell and make some new friends lol.
---
As I recall: don't.
---
It was good in BC when you could do the HArP spec (hemo, adrenaline rush, prep).
---
I look forward to seeing you provide those factual statistics instead of just talking about them then, because you're wrong.
---
Coolest thing I ever did was in Desolace, there‚Äôs a quest mob at the top of a watch tower, and a way higher level troll priest that was also waiting for it to respawn. The troll killed me, so I ran back and didn‚Äôt release. Once the mob respawned, and the troll started casting a spell, I released and fire blasted the mob and got the tag. Right after the troll finished his spell and took the mob down to half health, I sheeped the troll, quickly killed the mob, and ran for my life.
---
Sure they do, better guilds offer you faster loot, faster raids, better players to play with etc.
---
I've been on a slippery slope since launch...
---
I'm going to force myself not playing tonight.
---
Keep living the dream man! i will sit and wait my friend!
---
Self aware much? Christ you're annoying not clever or funny.. just a dick.
---
Lok‚Äôtar Ogar! It takes me 10 seconds to unmount, mind blast your lvl 20, and mount back up. Have a fun walk, i‚Äôll enjoy mine when someone gets me later inevitably
---
Orrrr it will preserve the world we love.
---
Hows that? lol
---
Actually, that's only the lore-reason for Demon Hunters. Your DH, like Illidan, has an Immortal Demon Soul. So like Demons themselves, your soul remains intact after your defeat and so long as it can be reunited with your / a body you return to life. This is how Illidan is brought back in Legion - his soul is reunited with his body, despite the Legion attempting to keep them apart.  
---
The players are 'mysteriously' important. Important enough that the Spirit Healers (a faction of Val'kyr) deem us to be too valuable. Hence the enigmatic "It is not yet your time" and our ability to return to life, albeit at a cost (rezz sickness / a long-ass run). In Zandalar they are replaced by Bwonsamdi, which... Kinda makes sense on Horde-side, as we owe him a debt. And he wants cash in on that debt. So he adds 'interest' for letting us return to life in his domain, so we keep sending him souls. No idea why he lets Alliance come back.

There will not be a classic+ there will be TBC.

The game is already made, releasing it will be like printing money for blizzard.

Then in the fast auto loot skin ASAP. Or leave loot until they leave.

DAE BALD STREAMER BAD ??

I was literally shaking when I saw how he is ruining MY **C L A S S I C**  ***E X P E R I E N C E*** by taking items. He destroyed classic wow and I _CANNOT_ play anymore. Thanks for giving streamers **FREE** loot ActiBli$zard. They implemented **LAYERING** too so they can't be **FAIRLY** killed by people who just want to pvp finding them just by looking at their stream like wtf when will the ***STREAMER BENEFITS*** end ? literally garbage in the game ***DISGUSTING***
---
I only did the Nessingwary stuff in STV for the gun. There was always at least 5 horde just sitting there. The funny thing is, I usually was able to walk up and turn in without issue, but once you get outside about a 50m bubble of that camp all hell breaks loose. It was a nightmare just trying to get burn through those quests. We had a 5 man group doing it too. There were just soooooo many horde there though. Totally worth it though.
---
SMOrc for the horde
---
Is this asmon? I watched his stream for 5 minutes and he said about 3 times, anyone want to trade me some gold?
---
Level 27 horde mage here. Where are some good money/cloth/skinning grinding spots?
---
Bitchass NElf rogue three levels lower than me tried to kill my warrior while they were on low HP after killing some mobs.
---
They managed to kill me, but they diedto bleeds afterwards. Eat a dick.
---
It‚Äôs less forgiving and makes you think longer about your decisions. If you make a mistake you get punished.

Wrong talent point? Fuck you.

Forgot pet food/ammo? Fuck you.

Missed the boat? Fuck you.

Etc.

I love Classic because of that.

This is kind of a weird take when I was obviously comparing getting attacked while fishing versus getting attacked doing literally anything else. Are you roleplaying an undead irl?

&gt; That's not toxic, or elitist. That's how you run a guild.
---
I mean...it's one way to run a guild. It's hardly the only way to run a guild, or play a game. 
---
I think it's a bit of a philosophical collision between the "I play games for fun" and "I play games for srs bzness" demographics, and the latter feels comical to OP, what with this being a 15 year old game with extremely simple mechanics that were all sussed out a long time ago. He's being a bit precious about it, but it's not the like guilds aren't being a bit precious themselves.
---
It's a game.
---
That's the idea!
---
Well massive and gamebreaking are sort of subjective, but I imagine a lot of scenarios that we are unaware of taking place like for instance, say there are 4 layers at a given time, but layer 4 has almost nobody on it. If you just happen to be that lucky guy on layer 4, you have way less contest for quest mobs, black lotus, thorium, rare mob spawns, etc. The player on layer 4 has an inherent advantage over the other players without any doing anything on his part, he just straight up has an advantage for no reason. I would argue that giving random players random edges is pretty massive, and borderline gamebreaking. When it comes to wPvP I don't see how layering is anything BUT gamebreaking. If I'm in an unfavorable circumstance in world pvp I'll just switch layer. No need for me to try to defend the questgiver or the flight master if he is alive on a different layer.
---
A bad comp?
---
I'm not your google get your head out of your ass before you spew nonsense
---
I play a Mage and its really an easy class, I mean respect for no AoE and all that man, but mages do have it easy. They may not have a pet or a speed movement boost pre mount but they have food/water(which you already mentioned), great CC , great survival tools, very good damage and teleports/portals. Grats on 60 btw!
---
I puked a little
---
What they have to offer you is a raid spot in their guild 
---
Do you know how much time and effort is spent into managing the logistics of a 40 man raid team? It's a part time job, man, if not more for some guilds. 
---
If you want to make it all about you, go make your own guild and lead your own raid.
---
Rerolling is starting the character over from scratch. 
---
Make a Night Elf warrior.
---
Fury but need to tank: Respec.
---
Front Flips are dumb, want +5 to swords and maces: Reroll.
---
I'm on Herod and I agree, I see and fully understand why people on these servers dungeon grind, especially when you are the minority faction ..   me personally though I only run a few dungeons in between quest hubs to fill in the rest of a level to unlock the next area.  I hate the thought of repeatedly grinding the same dungeon over and over to get to max level. I get that I will need to grind dungeons for pre bis/bis but if I wanted to aimlessly grind dungeons for no reward but exp id play retail .. I'm slowly leveling through the content on my warrior struggling through over crowded zones, but I'm loving every second of it.. even after being ganked 5 times.  It just allows me the opportunity to  go explore other zones and get a fully immersive experience.  I'm level 46 with near maxed professions and secondary professions and just enjoying the game for what it is and not rushing to get to the finish line.
---
You can be a hateful asshole without being a trump supporter, plenty before his time and there will be plenty after. 
---
Nice try though
---
&gt;Changing layers is Classic though.  Classic has layers.  
---
Not sure if you're just being pedantic or what here.. but no. Layers did not exist in classic/vanilla wow 15 years ago and are a relatively new technology implemented by blizzard on retail and carried over as a "lesser evil" when compared to server merges in the future with blizzard assuming a massive population die off prior to phase2. 
---
Spamming "layer inv pls" in order to make your gaming easier is not a part of the classic experience and will hopefully be removed soon. #nochanges
---
Now, it's worth noting that in your use case had you asked for a group for your quest in general and been invited to that group and therefore been transferred to their layer then that's layers working as blizzard intended and fairly close to the classic experience. 
---
Frankly people spamming for invites should be banned for intentionally and knowingly abusing the mechanic. Blizzard only seems to be enforcing it when it has a very large effect on the server economy though this far(raid/dungeon resetting, monitoring contested and valuable materials etc.) Although I wish they were banning all offenders, regardless of size since the intent is still there. 
---
The sooner they are gone, the more classic-like and better we will be.
---
Interesting. I'm weird with my hands, so maybe I don't have that fine grained movement in my right hand. I use my right hand for mouse and writing, but do basically everything else with my left hand. Left eye dominant as well so shooting right handed is awkward. I think I probably should have been left handed as a kid but my parents were like, "Nah just do it with your right hand like a normal person."
---
Your logic failed . It‚Äôs 1/10000 .    1/100 * 1/100 = 1/10000   .    The logic already takes care of there being 100 possible numbers. No idea why you would multiply by 100.
---
No, you are correct in that it should store up to **4** additional extra  attacks (the fifth being your normal auto attack to proc the 4 charges).
---
I've heard for the charges to accumulate you need to turn off auto attack as getting a reckoning charge in Classic will grant you an extra attack but also reset your attack timer, essentially acting like a better parry haste.
---
Think they will do another batch?
---
I didn't test Wildwind Lake but I can confirm the above information. I can only catch fish in bodies of water outside of the coast. Thank you for your detailed information.
---
Level 27 horde mage, currently specced to AOE but questing seems difficult now with 1v1 mobs.  Should I just respec? I changed because I was going to do some grinding for gold, but dont seem to see any spots prior to STV. Thanks!
---
Relax - I‚Äôm not saying that either. I‚Äôm saying let‚Äôs say that 10% on any average population is a douchebag. 
---
Greater population on horde with same % means more douche bags. 
---
Take it easy man.
---
No!! Jesus fucking Christ, the version of retail people hate here is entirely fictional. You could say Retail removed the entire ground and every NPC and people would believe it without question.
---
But what about the ladies?
---
Sounds familiar. I used to grind that area with a warlock friend of mine, and I swear he used to enslave them...
---
But that was a long time ago.
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the moth breakers complaining about not doing AOE runs and vise Versace with others doing AOE runs lol.
---
The circle is complete.
---
I'm still playing it like it's vanilla and thoroughly enjoying it.
---
And thats why designing the game to be enjoyable for the minmaxers is important.
---
Anybody can say "just don't do X if you find it to be too easy", but the thing is, I want to use everything I can. I want the game to be challenging, even when tryharding.
---
A lot of players (like me) enjoy having a lot of tools to tackle the challenges a game presents and picking the right tool to overcome it. If by doing that, the game becomes boring, then the design is flawed.
---
tl;dr, game designers should be the one designing the game, not the players  with self imposed challenges
---
IMO, removing the incentive of "fun" when you're getting corpse camped is a simple matter. It takes some time, but generally less time than waiting them out or rez sickness. 
---
If you're being corpse camped, just keep rezzing and ignore the gankers the best you can. Don't try to get away, don't try to retaliate, don't try to be sneaky and hide. Simply act as though they are just an inanimate obstacle, like a high level mob you need to get past to grab a flight point in a zone that's a few levels higher than you can handle. 
---
It's exactly the same thing I do when I need to say, get to booty bay with my level 23 toon. Remove equipped items with durability and run naked through the maelstrom. You get slaughtered a bunch but eventually reach your goal. 
---
My thoughts behind the effectiveness of this is that corpse campers are trolls; attention-seeking and negative by nature. They want to provoke you because that's how they derive the "fun" from the activity. If you aren't even acknowledging them there's literally nothing else for them to get from the experience, especially right now with no honor system in place. You don't take a durability hit from PvP and don't lost any honor. 
---
My experience is they'll kill you a few times and realize you're no fun. Or you can get pissy about it and try to wait them out, which is how I've seen a few guildies waste over an hour.
---
You should probably finish STV to get to 43 or so, then do hinterlands/feralas/tanaris.
---
What if I told you people wanting harder leveling and people using exploits were different people?
---
This brought a tear to my eye. Wish they would make a new good solid thps or remaster
---
I quested and only grinded two levels in the high 50s, beast skinning is indeed very good. Vendor all leather up to Thick is what i did. Blue drops are a huge gamble, you either get a great one, or a shit one, like what happened to me lol.
---
[If you aren't aware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iJU-S8T0-k) :)
---
you had me until transmog
---
Pretty fun so far, more excited for phase 2 and 3 for when the pvp starts up.
---
Kaplan's Blue name was Tigole for how many years? They're tits :P
---
You get down voted on Reddit by their zealots whenever you speak the truth about APE's being notorious exploiters even from the P Server days.
---
If Blizz stays on top of layer-exploiters you will have no problem getting into raids.
---
Even if BWL comes out and you are still trying to get geared to enter MC there will always be guilds that are running it
---
Good luck and enjoy the process! Vanilla was about much more than blowing through content to reach endgame :)
---
Dude Atiesh isn't even as full as those mega servers and all the mobs are dead in quest heavy areas like STV.  It's insane and awesome how full even the realms without queues are, but man it makes finding hidden corners with fast respawns so much faster than questing.
---
Usually yes. They allow flights up and down each coast of the continent, rather than the back and forth through the middle.
---
It's just a shame they are usually the last paths you pick up (worth noting the west coast won't connect without Feathermoon)
---
&gt; Alchemy is a must for Rogues. 
---
Idk where you hear this. Obviously being able to craft potions is nice, but literally anyone can craft the potions, it doesn't have to be you and you get no benefit from being the guy doing it other than a couple of gold per day for transmutes and occasion tips from crafting.
---
Engineering has tons of awesome stuff to offer that ONLY engineers can do.
---
Picking up furor from 41-45 is better. Full hotw and 3% crit at 40 is stupid good, especially if you're stacking agi already. I did early furor from 36-40 and just got LotP at 45 and am sitting at almost 22% crit.
---
Super late but just reading through this thread -- 
---
Playing priest, me healing dungeons before Ulda: Pft, this aint so tough... I can definitely heal dungeons even though I'm a bit low. We'll get through ti.
---
me, doing my first Ulda run at level 40, at the end: WTF I AM NOT PREPARED FOR THIS
---
Im in!
---
Yeah, from the title I thought this would be something like not allowing OP to group with people outside the guild or something like that but these things are all very normal for serious raiding guilds.
---
Exactly. People that bitch about this kind of thing either had one bad experience and are too stupid to realize that it‚Äôs not a universal rule - or - they are just delusional and too far removed from reality to accept whatever notion they have about what the word ‚Äúselfish‚Äù really means.
---
lvl 1 frost bolt casts faster and is a good temporary, low mana snare.
---
BOOM!!!! BURNED!
---
also fuck spell and melee cleave setups most people can't do them properly and you end up taking longer than if you had just ran it like a normal person and it would have been a chill and normal experiance.
---
Thanks... lol
---
That‚Äôs what my buddies were saying, they couldn‚Äôt beat this wreathes same faction Druid at all. Not sure if it‚Äôs verified but thought it was interesting considering the other issues batching has presented.
---
On rp servers they say "bolster our ranks," though.
---
Wow that's a good idea. Saved.
---
Newer player here. Just hit lvl 35 as a Mage. I've specced my skills for single Target frost bolt crits, but after a few scarlet monastery runs, I really enjoy aoe. However I realize it may not be as forgiving out of the SM instances. That said, some questions. 
---
Should I Respec to AOE/blizz mage?
---
I hope to soak in the WoW lore as I play since it's my first time playing. If I Respec, will questing be more difficult? Perhaps is the AOE spec viable for questing, or just AOE farming?
---
If I do AOE farm am I really missing much from the quests I skip? It seems a lot are just get x for me plz.
---
Lastly, I have SO MANY QUESTS TO DO. Some in STV, in Hillsbrad, Duskwallow Marsh etc etc. If I go to complete one area and outlevel the other areas quests.. am I missing a lot?
---
&gt;people were just way worse back then. 
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure my hunter had the Scarlet helm and shoulder.
---
Don't look at me D:
---
Thanks for making me feel better about my time I did it in 8 days 22 hours and felt like I wasn't even in the ballpark.
---
My favorite is when the tank has over pulled and things are hectic and the warlock decides to tap until their health is at &lt;10%. So, I have to decide, heal them and go oom or wait for them to make the walk back to the dungeon after being hit once.
---
I'll take fappable wow icons for $1000 Alex
---
On my 40 rogue I wish I took herb to make my own thistle tea and blinding powder
---
I know ;-; I also understand it from a raiders perspective which is part of what started all of this lol. I'm not sure how competitive the other spec is in comparison though.
---
DPS does need heals.
---
Especially warlocks, who can convert their healers mana into mana for them at an extremely efficient rate (especially if specced into improved tap), resulting in a substantial increase to the resources that are available to the party as a whole.
---
Not saying this guy wasn't garbage, or that tapping is always justified (sometimes mana on the healer is many times more valuable than mana on a dps), but please throw a renew/rejuv on your warlock if they arent full hp and you van afford it.
---
I‚Äôm running Alch on my rogue which is way nice. However a guildie of mine popped off a gnomish death ray for 1800 dmg non-crit and made me reevaluate what I‚Äôm doing.
---
I will say this, making your own shit in Alch is nice, however you can just buy it all.
---
Engineering stuff requires engineering.
---
This is my trip up right now, I‚Äôd like the insight of others on this question as well.
---
Started a warlock. First pet class. 
---
Any addons that are helpful for locks specifically? Anything I need to know about pet management, macros, addons, etc.? I already had to set up a macro so that I would cast immolate and have the pet attack at the same time.
---
What professions are good? My mage is already a tailor so don't want to do that. I'm on a pvp server so was thinking engineering. But I also have a druid that's mine/engi so was thinking maybe herbalism/alch for variety.
---
Yeah, there's no rush when you dont really care what's at the end. Just enjoying the game leveling with my wife and attempting to duo dungeons here and there. Also we are altaholics. So it takes even longer finding something we want to stick to all the way to 60. 
---
Started as feral tank spec druid + resto shaman and got em to 26 and went prot warrior + holy priest and got em to 19 and now prot paladin + holy paladin and currently 14.
---
combat for leveling, riposte combined with the extra parry and AR is fantastic, only in your 40s do you get the talents for where daggers can make you comparable.  The RFD and SM quest swords are super good at that point though too.  So I'm staying swords for a while
---
They didn't grind dungeons in 5 mans, watched multiple member's VODs on Twitch and some of them were even grinding ZF in 8 man raids.
---
Feeling younger in my mind
---
Its the basic theme songs from iMovie, don‚Äôt know the exact name
---
Whats with all these people thinking classic is a hard game?  Its actually way easier than retail
---
I did use rank 1 fb you might of missed it
---
Of course there is, it is a rule I live by. Just like another rule someone else might live by is don't shit in someones face.
---
It is not a universally abided rule or enforced one, but simply by having one person attest to it, it exists.
---
I doubt the next phase will arrive for at least another two months, youve got plenty of time.
---
As a warrior you'll be dual wielding anyway
---
Lets say you were walking into a building and you had your hands full. You don't have enough free hands to open the door to get inside. You ask for help from the guy near the door. He says sure, just say thanks when I do it. You take too long to get to the door so he walks off. You ask the next person near the door to do the same for you but he wants a thanks PLUS a back scratch. You feel like hes asking a bit much so you yell to the entire parking lot that there is a guy by the door who is being greedy and unfair. Then that "unreasonable" guy leans over and whispers in your ear that you are actually the one who is being rude at this point and goes on about his business leaving you to figure out this door situation. Sometimes hypothetical parallels help people see perspectives.
---
I never played WOW at all before this.
---
Played DDO a tonne and then many years on SWTOR.  Also played ESO and BDO.
---
I have been having so much fun playing classic.  There is a real MMORPG feel to every part of the game.  
---
It's a shame that the gamer theory and theme park elements are so focused in todays MMOs.  Playing a game where the adventure is the game, not collecting pets, or ticking off cheevo boxes, or getting the perfect parse.  You can get lost in this game.
---
Seen the same for mass shadowbolt on a 34 elite caster. Now I ask,myself if it is,intended to cone, too. 
---
Apart from this I can confirm cleave from Onyxia being only about 120 degrees because it was save to attack from sides (back was bad due to tail sweep)
---
Having a lot of fun playing in STV casually with a friend.  We only play a few times a week so it's a nice balance of questing, grinding, and PvP.
---
Prooobably not ideal for people looking to powerlevel but not everyone is.
---
Ppl just wand Spell cleave to xp Grind SM. You could try and find a melee cleave group but those are rarer.
---
You need to adapt and use in game resources at hand. Why are you so entitled to stay in that zone as if you deserve the right to everything there. Log off, switch zones, join a guild that helps leveling, run a dungeon, ask for help in general, ask for help via whispers, join local defense chat. You‚Äôre just whining, go play PvE
---
It's not really that people were worse, but rather the meta and strategies hadn't yet developed. There were more unknowns and people hadn't had the time to learn the aspects of the game. Now people know every variable and have been testing strategies and exploits out for years. We're more informed.
---
While I can agree that the warlock, from what you are saying, did act like an asshole.. not healing a warlock basically means that they're just straight up fucked when it comes to fight longevity.  
---
Having to constantly recast thanks to the multiple resists you run into thanks to not having any inherent hit rating through talent trees means that your manabar can end up being shredded after just two or three mobs.  
---
If you have the mentality of DPS shouldn't ever need heals, I don't think many warlocks would want to group with you.  
---
Which I suppose is fine if that's what you want, always an abundance of mages around.
---
I AM INVINCIBLE!
---
I thought it was an accident or unintended. My bad.
---
The look on peoples faces when it procs, but the healer pulled aggro so the tank and group of mobs ran out of range of the proc.
---
&gt;I was in an RFC group yesterday, and our warrior tank was having trouble holding aggro 
---
This is to be expected, depending on the level of the tank, he likely only has Sunder Armor (you don't get Demo Shout until 14) and even then, a critical hit will generate more threat than a sunder will.
---
Here is the thing:  In retail, being in a tank spec, gives you a passive 500% threat generation modifier; in Classic this is 110% for Prot warriors. You don't have thunderclap, or any spammable AoE threat ability (even more so now that demo shout was hotfixed) Taunt is melee range only, not 30 yards like in retail. Revenge is single target skill, not a cleave. Challenging shout is a 10 min CD. etc etc etc.
---
That being said, you are right. DPS have a bad habit of trying big dick and top meters.  They rarely wait for 2 stacks of sunder, they often don't attack skull, the fail to interrupt, ignore that they have CC, when they get aggro they kite away from the tank, and sometimes they even attack before the LoS pull is even finished and the mobs to the tank.  
---
Best thing you can do is just be friendly and say "could you focus on skull, helps me keep aggro on everything else" or "mind sheeping moon, this is a big pull, might get messy" or "hold off on DPSing until the mobs are all around the corner and I have a sunder stack on it"
---
People are reasonable for the most part.
---
Amazing. Got a 25 hunter and a 16 rogue. (I only play the rogue when my one IRL buddy is on so we're always on the same page)
---
Gonna run BFD tonight. There's a pretty tasty bow I hope drops.
---
I've bern playin warcraft since dos. Pretty pumped I get to play vanilla again.
---
the point is ret paladins are shit .
---
Gap list &lt;3
---
I thought Gnomeregan was going to be a huge pain, but in a completely normal group, we hammered out all the quests and did a full run in two hours, no deaths.
---
Hey Steamy Nicks, you leave them britches alone.
---
And you're absolutely wrong. While the mechanics of bosses are nowhere near as difficult in classic as they are in mythic raids, there are many other factors that DO make classic raiding difficult. 
---
Ultimately, it comes down to time commitment, which I already touched on. You will need to farm consumables. You will need to have spent time to farm gear from sources outside of the raid. You are expected to actually show up to the damn thing when scheduled.
---
I've not seen ANY guild ask for much other than the bare minimum of being able to raid, having made a clear effort towards pre-bis, and of course, not being a useless meme spec. 
---
If you want to join a "normal" guild, then go join a "normal" guild. There are different types of guilds for different types of people, and ultimately, the hardcore guilds are not in the wrong for not appealing to you. You might just not be into hardcore guild communities, and that's ok.
---
Typically it's not worth getting +spell/heal until you are approaching endgame. I would go w/ the staff personally
---
Engineering is all sorts of fun, badass, useful, and great for PvP. It's also a huge money pit, but you won't care when you're throwing bombs at people and cackling maniacally. Engineering all the way!
---
Because when people first did it 14-15 years ago, we didn‚Äôt know half the shit we know now. So it took many attempts a lot of trial and error and hard work to finally down Rag.
---
Now? Probably not as satisfying I‚Äôm sure.
---
Didn't know a mob would be tagged by your if the initial attacker is dead.
---
This, so much!
---
See red and dead hell yeah my shaman brother
---
Not a specific answer to your question but an FYI when you start the game the UI is empty and as you level up the UI fills as you gain new abilities. It‚Äôs super busy to a bystander but it wouldn‚Äôt be busy to the person who has been playing that character as they level up.
---
Items reserved. 
---
o hai WoTLK
---
I'm honestly surprised they don't have a battle pass yet.
---
Unfortunately the server transfer time frame ended, but I would highly recommend you reroll. (I rerolled and used the Guidelime to quest far more efficiently)
---
I think you are overlooking the biggest reason why people wanted classic in the first place. Blizzard spent the past decade continuously destroying wow with changes. That's a pretty solid track record. It's pretty safe to assume that if they decide to make changes to classic, unless they magically pull their head out of their ass, they will ruin it all over again.
---
It was just an overall amazing raid. The randomness of what fights you got each time were cool. I liked the unknown and the overall scenery. I REALLY hope we get to see Kara again. 
---
Also...what about that rare mount drop eh!? Thing was COOL.
---
You mean since vanilla.
---
this was discovered like a week ago or more, and still not even addressed. hope they fix this soon.
---
also, at least one talent is considered an invisible buff: predatory strikes as a feral. there‚Äôs another bug where this and LotP are not being reapplied during powershifting so we need to /cancelaura them in our powershifting macro. it‚Äôs pretty bizarre.
---
Who wants to tell him?
---
He's not even pretending anymore, lmao.
---
I‚Äôm behind the curve and wishing I took a week off work hahaha
---
Or the mindset of always having to prove people wrong and that you are super smart.
---
Don't feel bad. They're on the wrong faction.
---
Is monkey quest
---
Lmao y'all try to make everything about layering. The game would be a fucking shit show without it. I don't even remotely see how you can blame layering for people dungeon grinding either, shit without it there would be so much competition for quest mobs it would probably be like 10x worse.
---
Download a threat meter, let the tank get 2 sunders on a mob before hitting it (maybe even 3 if you are particularly threat heavy), use fade, use threat reduction talents
---
No chart needed, it‚Äôs simpe: Red = Dead
---
Go Deadmines if you're Alliance and Willing Caverns if you're Horde.
---
Sure.
---
that's the point. He's part demon now
---
Literally me last night: I'll just stay up and play tonight, get only a few hours of sleep, and catch up on it the rest of the week. It will be worth it!
---
Me this morning: Holy shit I'm never doing that again
---
Me right now, 4 hours later: Another night won't be so bad.
---
This fucking sucks.
---
Sounds like you are just too close to the pack in leveling. Where everyone is doing the same thing, getting the same cloth...etc, and the market bottoms. 
---
I'd save your mats in cases where you'd barely get vendor prices. Once the wave passes...say linen, eventually those prices should come up a little during to people leveling professions, but fewer people leveling in that range to provide that cloth.
---
If you want to fish for money, I'm sure that long term it'll be viable. You just have so many people leveling it now... who may not use it later in a farming capacity. As a holy priest, I'm hoping fishing will be viable until I can get a dps alt up.
---
To hit mobs when you pull with ranged attack.
---
Yee
---
Starting fights and killing people in an area right after you finish the quest and leave. Best way to troll.
---
What are mouse over macros for healing? I haven't played in ages? Explain please
---
SOME exploits are why classic is great. What dont you people understand?
---
Nah, he used iceblock immediately both times right after the opener. The mage knew how to counter, he just had to use his cool downs better (improved sprint is the way).
---
To all the rogues giving hate, i love yall i mained a rogue for years and is my first love
---
They're worth for grey drops and cloth. Sell cloth, profit and continue. It is a pretty contested spot and you're right at the point where questing becomes worth more money. Just play naturally and you should have it 41 or so
---
I main'd a lock in vanilla and a healer now. Locks should not expect a heal and should never tap themselves into a dangerous health position. Healthstone frequently, bandage, life tap, drink between pulls. Lock can convert health into mana, but also have tools available to balance it out.
---
Of course this guys largest problem was aoe'ing everything and not managing agro. He can sit at 10% health no problem usually... if he's not pulling agro. Sounds like he has retail mindset. And given how many aoe farm xp groups are out there, it doesn't help people learn. 
---
I was in a BRD a few days ago. I'm a 60 spriest, there was a 60 mage, and a high 50s hunter. Tank was 52. Guess what happened? The hunter would burst damage immediately, pulling the mobs off the tank, he'd feign... but at that point the tank has already lost some agro time on the mobs. So now they are booking it towards the mage who was immediately aoe'ing everything. And I'm just sitting here wanding the skull target having no issues. However often had to break out of shadow and help heal and bubble the mage who was basically the tank. I mean... it's funny to watch, but annoying that even after dozens of pulls they were not adjusting or learning anything.
---
Uldum, Karazhan, Grim Batol, Dragon Isles, Emerald Dream (maybe. Their reasons for scrapping the idea are pretty sound).
---
So, so many opportunities.
---
But it's activision/Blizzard now, not OG Blizz. We're getting TBC servers instead.
---
I love TBC, so it's OK. But there is going to be a massive missed opportunity here.
---
Did your 2-handed axe brake or why would you use a shield?
---
Yeah it's off for sure, i played vanilla day 1 with a rogue on 'Murican servers from europe and on west cost servers with like 300 point i always got out of range even if i was on top of them, so this wasn't in early vanilla for sure.
---
What's the breed? I don't know much about dogs.
---
Is there a website where we can see the correct number of active players in each classic realm? i saw u got it tru wowhead, but is it an acurate/official data?
---
I did exactly that. My advice: take the role of tank and create your party. Do not invite any other warriors or enhance shaman to guarantee you get it. This might rub some people the wrong way, but hey, you are leveling a warrior and that is tough. One perk is being able to create the exact group you want to go to the exact instance you want to get the exact loot you want. We get it good in groups and others (mainly dps) get it good in leveling.
---
Boy That escalated quickly
---
Well played sir
---
/cast charge. Not charge /cast
---
Just did a orange Mara run, 3 hours later we have finished the whole dungeon.
---
Ooooh.....I don't think I mind that idea....I dont think - since dyes are already in-game.
---
Fixed! 
---
If anyone has the same issue its spells -&gt; misc -&gt; untick smartcast cleanse
---
It's supposed to do it only out of combat but it's definitely happening mid combat
---
I legit dont know what's wrong with them.
---
From what I've seen we can't /cancelaura Predatory Strikes, only /cancelaura LotP. Maybe I'm incorrect as I haven't tested this bug a lot, but I was pretty sure Predatory Strikes will always alternate with your powershifts. 
---
Also when I said they don't count, I meant they don't count towards the buff limit. This is just what I can convey from the tester's I know. Originally they thought the talents would count but after testing they don't think they do.
---
Also I'm pretty confident that this specific bug stems from the macro speed. If you shift in and out at a normal pace you'll still retain the LotP buff, it only doesn't reapply when using a macro to shift.
---
I played Shammy in classic. He didn't drop totems. Half the time I swear he was dual screening another game. Go back and check some of it out I'm sure it's on his channel still.
---
&gt;the more connected and friendly you are to your guild, the better the chances of you getting your loot.
---
Wait...that's not ok.  Performance based loot, sure.  Reliability being rewarded, sure.  Commitment to the guild, helping each other out and what not...sure.  All great things to reward.
---
But, loot should never be given out subjectively on who schmoozes the loot council more, that's actually a BAD sign of guild management.
---
My favorite part about dungeons in classic is dealing with all of the unexpected things, even on a relatively smooth run.  Adds, runners, accidental pulls, etc, are all fun to deal with, and every class has different things that they bring to the table.  We should focus on those things rather than damage.
---
(although, CC is one of the main reasons the classes were homogenized over the years in the first place.)
---
Yea but its crazy that this sub cares so much about a streamer being hypocritical in a video game that they still talk about it every day.  Its pathetic
---
i was actually looking for this info. thanks for sharing. wtf is going on in wyrmthalak??
---
At 22 you can have 3/3 Improved Blizzard and that is where it can really kick off
---
arms warriors? I thought fury is for pvp.
---
Record scratch
---
You collect those items from a quest in Loch Modan. Same model I guess.
---
tits, what's your point? never seen one?
---
How do you know what classes are the most popular? I wanna know so I can roll something lesser played
---
You are litterally a meme. This one is the most retarded of the responses ive seen so far.
---
I want pvp. I want battles. I dont mind being ganked once in a while. What I do mind is when pvp turns into genocide because unbalanced ratios. Imagine you are questing. You take 5 steps into stv. Oh there is a horde group camping the entrence. You call for help on general chat. Its all crickets, except for the one mentally challenged guy saying "pick pve".
---
I will either quit the game or server transfer to RPPvP. Im supposed to be having fun, not being frustrated because Im stuck at lvl 31 since my options are spamming dungeons (i will quit for sure if thats the only option).
---
Your attitude is going to make players quit the game. Have fun with your world pvp when al the members of the outnumbered faction leave.
---
Always fun to piss them off on the way out. Unfortunate for the fellow faction members still there but welcome to STV
---
Yeah usually when a skull or group gets me I just sit down while they beat on me and then when I rez I'll just do it right in front of them. No fear, no emotes, just ignore them.
---
Unless the graveyard is suuuuuuuper far away (looking at you Stonetalon), then I'm going to try to get out quickly because that run sucks.
---
/r/unexpectedgoldfinger
---
im not sure where the problem is? You kill the mob, if theres someone around you just dont loot it yet? if they really are just gonna wait for you to loot it, run to the next mob and loot/skin that one
---
I've been encouraging rogues to pickpocket every mob in the pull before engaging when they have aggro issues.
---
Nothing feels better than hitting level 52 and going to hillsbrad and smacking a level 20 horde in the head
---
Stance dancing is mostly used in PvP. For PvE tanking it's main use is to use berserker rage against fear but outside of this you will be mainly tanking in defensive stance. When opening it's often useful to start with charge/thunderclap and then switch to defensive stance.
---
If you have enough points in tactical mastery (should have at least 3 in any prot spec) you can also switch back to battle stance each time you want to use thunderclap if you prefer, however it's not really needed.
---
And I never once claimed others SHOULD follow it, I am arguing my standpoint however, but I've not once said I expect people to do as I do.
---
It would be outright fucking lovely if you'd stick to reading what I say rather than project on to me what you wish I had said.
---
So by your words, get out of here with your bullshit.
---
You will want to assign a keybind to pet attack and pet passive.  Also, i would recommend manual control of seduce and the felhunters abilities.  Dispelling magic CC from yourself or a party member immediately puts you at elite status with your group.
---
Warlock dps really shines when youre able to sustain dots on 2 or 3 targets.  As long as they run their duration, you can think of corruption (for example) as an instant cast extremely high damage with no cooldown.  Otherwords, damage per cast time is the highest in the game.  The trick is estimating how long something will live to determine if its worth dots, and if so, how many.   
---
Theres a lot of calculation that you can put into it if you want to push the class to the limit.  Otherwise, theres nothing with putting pets on autocast and having a standard spell rotation for each situation.
---
Ive tried playing a mage several times, and ive found warlocks to be much more fun.
---
If you're good, healers will find you and follow you in pvp. Just be sure to protect them. Spam hamstring on anything that gets near them so they can get away
---
I log in because the content is better, m+, arena the raids etc...
---
Only leveling in classic so I have a 60 ready for when they drop TBC remaster to milk that.
---
I think it's not quite that the mechanics are harder, but that everything is tuned to just require more from you. Even if that's as simple as having mobs have like +50% numbers compared to retail. This in turn makes questing take more effort (and yes, time), and makes anything that can give you an edge - paying gold for consumables or better gear, grouping, etc. - more appealing. Professions don't really matter on retail, but in Classic that stack of potions, or blue crafted items, or whatever, can make a stretch of leveling a bit easier, so they have value now.
---
&gt;it ain‚Äôt a big deal, it‚Äôs exactly why our experiences aren‚Äôt so different.
---
Kinda exactly my point. You don't notice it so you don't think it matters at all.
---
Majority of alliance players are outnumbered and it can suck sometimes. That's all. Its not the end of the world but it's fair to bitch about once in a while when you're getting swarmed.
---
There is both a uwu and a OwO guild on my server. They are at war for recruiting.
---
Yeah it is, lol.
---
We're playing a patch that had noticably broken balancing. We know what the future patches hold.
---
And it fixes this lock in right here.
---
It's a long trip, but it's a great excuse to get up and take a break from the game. I always take it because it's a free ride to TB from essentially anywhere in the world, which saves precious silver. I usually just take that time to smoke a bowl or do laundry or something and by the time I come back, I'm nearly there.
---
This is why you need to be a Druid to kill a mage for being melee.
---
There‚Äôs talking about PvP, and then there‚Äôs bitching about being ganked. People tend to hate the latter. You won‚Äôt achieve anything by whining about it, so why bother? Most random strangers aren‚Äôt gonna come help you. Just deal with it and move on.
---
Better than a warrior to 30, way worse afterward.
---
Getting a group should be no problem. However, you are also able to do the Whirlwind Weapon quest, which provides a much better axe. You would need help doing it, but if you have a higher level guildie/friend, it is vastly better.
---
What are they at? On classic release i purchased mine for about 200k it was about 260-80 before
---
I had buffed a mage whose reaction times were quite slow but when he finally noticed he stopped in his track, started running after me and then blinked to get in range to cast int on me.
---
They'll also be doing the server a favor by acting as a containment facility.
---
These are the kind of people that honk at you for not breaking the speed limit
---
as counter to the meeting stone takeing away from other players: it's not the same as mages lossing portals. portals went to cities and giving evrryone these portals ment everyone got them.
---
however meeting stones are fixed locations. warlock summons are not.
---
likewise for mages there is still SOME utility in giving a protal at the end of for instance a dungeon so people didn't have to put their HS on CD.
---
I see what you are saying, but it doesn't seem sustainable. 
---
What happens when you don't have the gear to run the new raids and you don't have a guild and nobody is running the old raids anymore? Will wow classic+ only be for those with guilds who can run them through past raids to get geared?
---
God... whenever I see the word ‚Äúglomp‚Äù accompanied by cat emojis... Lord give me strength.
---
Corruption + Hellfire + priest bubble = our aoe is A tier. Not as powerful as mage but we make up for it in utility.
---
Yes...
---
Ya i am a warrior, 41, and only half way to my gold that i need for the mount. Warrior leveling is a pain.
---
I picked hunter 12 years ago and it was an incredible experience. I didn't get to raid much in vanilla but in TBC it was fantastic. Hunters, especially BM spec, are very solid for dpa and solo, but marksmanship/survival is where it shines imo.
---
It's a solid and reliable class with a very rewarding but high mastery celling.
---
&gt;why would you even watch that, honestly? Makes you only part of the problem
---
Why would you assume a negative like this? He was the top streamer. I clicked out of curiosity for 2 reasons:
---
1. Why is Shroud playing WoW?
---
2. Is he enjoying it?
---
I kept it on in the background I wasn't actively watching and supporting. I just wanted to see classic in action. 
---
I don't know why I feel like I even needed to respond to you. Probably because 22 other people are just as stupid as you and made the assumption that "I'm part of the problem". What even is the problem? Lol.
---
and what about the power creep that is Outlands green gear lol?
---
War is hell
---
Is hunter actually not good versus mage? Idk why but I have a hard time believing this.
---
Cool thank you
---
I'd have to see real numbers, not a fan of speculation.   I could be wrong but I seriously doubt that the player base would be large enough to populate each expansion.  Who knows though.  I am human and I have nothing to totally prove you wrong nor do you me.   :)
---
Do not investigate uwu, if you start going down the uwu path you'll wish you could go back in time to when you didn't know about people who say uwu.
---
 If you're in a guild, try to plan time ahead to farm dungeons. If you're solo, explicitly ask for multiple runs. If you pick certain classes, or can piggyback, spell cleave comps can roll through early-mid game dungeons no problem (not sure if it's effective up TO 60, but it gets you far for barely touching quests).
---
To catch up gear-wise, look up BiS lists for your class and one-by-one knock them out. There's blues that last up to naxx, so don't take rarity at face value. If you're proficient at gold farming you can just buy stuff off the AH to help you catch up
---
Power differentials are like runescape in the sense that numbers are relatively small, so being at a disadvantage doesn't mean you're guaranteed to lose. Being 60 with mostly greens going against a 60 with mostly blues doesn't mean you can't kill them.
---
When you feel like that, find some comfortably easy mobs to grind and bust out a level.
---
Me too! haha
---
Fair enough :)
---
I'll start using Local Defense just in case people are in the same boat as you if I ever find myself outnumbered by the opposite faction
---
Are you avoiding it because banking?
---
God i called in to work on Monday so i could play wow all day :( i'm playin with fire
---
are you alliance? just take a dwarf priest and be lacy.
---
for horde a stancedancing tank is nice to have bur not a must.
---
just a macro /cats berserker stance /cast berserkerrage /cats defstance and spam it if needed.
---
not hard at all
---
*precedent*
---
Do you even travel, bro?
---
Just spec into -0.5s to frostbolt +10% to slow effects and 20% to frostbolt range and you will kill most of the mobs before they even get to you. And you can still spec into imp blizzard and frost nova to be able to aoe farm.  Just don't spec frostbite.
---
If I get 2 levels in a day, that's good peace of mind to stop for the night. At 60 theres not many milestones to limit my play. If I dont get that drop, I'll be running again and again till I pass out.
---
You know, Monster Hunter Frontier is a thing right? It even has raids. Only caveat is that it's exclusive to japan right now.
---
I'm using prat for my chat window that you can see on the left, but it doesn't seem to work for the combat log :(
---
Ok, this is good to note. Thank you.
---
I've had custom UIs since day one retail in vanilla.  It's definitely part of my core enjoyment of the game.  Elvui Classic is pretty gorgeous right out of the box, honestly.  I barely edited it at all.
---
US is also 50/50 which make it event more impressive. But this is EU scroll down and check the numbers
---
A bunch of the gnomish tools are bop but don't require gnomish engineering, so you can craft those, relevel as goblin and still use them.
---
&gt;  "don't be an ass".
---
This is not constructive feedback and in no way explains the how/why of what other classes are doing in the team.
---
Since the Warlock DOTs, and Tanks have few ways of pulling aggro from multiple targets simultaneously, if the Warlock fully DOTs 4 mobs, 3 run at the Warlock, the Tank pulls one (or maybe all) off, but then the DOTs kick in again with the Tank now out of Rage and/or still on cooldown, so the Tank loses 2 mobs back to the Warlock, there's no way to prevent the mobs from taking the Warlock down.
---
DOT the Tank's target only. When you are down to the final two mobs, experiment with timing  of applying DOTs to the last target so you can get in some extra damage, but not pull the mob.
---
How is this post even allowed it's just a post of rocks wtf
---
The trade channel is still being used quite a bit when you are in Cities, but LookingForGroup seems to be getting a good amount of use which is nice cause you can use that while you are still out questing. Usually the local channel for the zone the instance is in also has some groups being formed in it as well.
---
I mean it's kind of realistic in a sense, if a murderer happens to come at you with a gun as you just have a knife, you ded. It's the equivalent of this but in WoW. You can choose to quest elsewhere, or log for a bit and play an alt, or rally some higher level guildmates for help etc.
---
&gt;playing vanilla
---
&gt;expecting changes
---
Nobody ever said this classic game version was remotely close to 1.12 under the hood. Blizzard was very open about the fact that they ported the entire game to the BfA framework, for that very obviously visible change alone they can't just use private server scripting out of the box.
---
Omg what font is this? I know weird question, but I fell in love. Please let me know OP! ;)
---
When ZG comes out you'll be able to use the Bloodvine Set
---
Its better to make an alt now then during phase 2 where there will be lots of 60s and honor is introduced rip
---
Oh they used the Crypts in Legion? I don‚Äôt remember that :/ I thought they never wanted to release it because The Uoside Down sinners was too fucked for WoW.
---
Even with exploits Classic is exponentially harder...
---
Wow!
---
Yeah.. had to leave a guild because of somthing similar recently, I'm taking my time plus real life is busy right now, when I log in its my downtime to watch netflix/grind/dungeons/profession leveling and my guild chat is all a bunch of try hards especially the guild leader who put pressure to level faster as well as constantly asking for layer invites... 
---
I don't get it how do you find that style of gaming enjoyable? What are you trying to prove lol...
---
I got the key pretty fast, so I did first the quest to free him before this one, so it's clear he needs 15 cause there's multiple people inside
---
As a healing priest (when I‚Äôm in groups, anyway), how do I compare gear with +healing to +intellect and +spirit?
---
Anything really.  Two druids is fun leveling but you will be fighting over some of the same gear even though different spec'd.  Best part of two druids, you guys tank/heal and just grab 3 dps for dungeons.
---
Group up, spread out, kite mobs into a central location, shared kill quests are easy. It's the named mobs with 10 min spawns and 3 groups waiting that are hard.. tetris, bagthera etc
---
I started off pretty passive. I'd pass by people doing quests and sometimes even kill the mob if it looked like they were in trouble. Then I got to STV and started getting repeatedly spawn camped by players 10+ levels higher than me and it made me bitter, so I started killing everyone I saw, or at least trying to.
---
Then I left STV and was mostly passive again until I started doing LBRS and BRD where there seems to always be large groups of alliance sitting out front ganking everyone that comes near the portal, and thats one hell of a run back. Now if I see an alliance character anywhere near blackrock mountain, they're getting attacked assuming I'm not outnumbered.  
---
This all goes out the window though when it's a name that's griefed me in the past. I usually don't attack lowbies, but I managed to outlevel a few people who used to spawncamp me in STV, and nothing has been as satisfying as watching them try to run away when I jump them. Theres this paladin that keeps bubble hearthing though and I really look forward to the day I run into him without hearth.
---
For real. It‚Äôs kinda like sports, except even the fat people can play the game. 
---
I‚Äôll never understand.
---
Logically, Blizz won't change or add new stuff in classic, not at least in a long time. The reason: Classic Target Audience, the old schoolers, people in theyr 30+ that played Vanilla/BC and now are back. These players have a very similar mentality and life styles that don't allow for more than 4hrs playtime a day (1-2hrs its probly closer to the reality of most players) and generaly are happy (or force themselves to be happy) to slowdown a bit and take theyr time leveling, questing, gearing up and etc for the endgame content.
---
Yes, some players have reached endgame and can play 12hrs a day and are already bored with the game... But those aren't the Target Audience for Classic, those don't represent the majority of the playerbase and those wont stay for long in Classic.
---
Wanting to make my first alt over the weekend I think. Basically have a lvl 45 sham which will be my prio until he is 60. However I would like to get my alt to lvl 5 and put him in an inn to get max slept for when I come back. 
---
I am torn between troll mage or undead warrior. Not trying to being max efficient with this alt strictly fun and based of personal preference of looks/racials. 
---
Mage sounds really fun to aoe grind. Also could be very helpful for grinding gold since my sham will be healer spec at 60. However mele classes seem more fast paced to me and fury war is my favorite mele character in vanilla. 
---
Probs going to do her and alc as professions for both. Halp!
---
People should technically be using /3 too, but just like people are saying "It's a PvP server, you should be getting ganked!" on the flip side of that, it's a PvP server and you should expect to see people complaining about getting ganked.
---
I thnik it needs to be spelled out for him...
---
P V E
---
I hate that retail makes mage forget fireball in frost spec.
---
I had a few quests left being 42, thought maybe 2am is good time, 1 skull rogue, 2 red mages at the entrance and a roaming party of 49+ hordes running around the entrance of booty bay killing everyone onsight
---
In all fairness, I'd kindly ask people to duel them. This way you are in a low stake environment (since you don't die) and can practice your PvP.  
---
By dueling others, you get to learnt the abilities of their classes and through practice, get to learn how your kit might counter them. As long as the level range is close, always accept a random duel and if possible, ask people politely if they wouldn't mind dueling you.
---
Same. I play WoW with my friend. I'm a druid too. The only person who gets my revives is my friend.
---
These guys spend hours layering and doing exploits and somewhat knew their actions would have consequences, and once they did they go‚Äù seems fair‚Äù. I don‚Äôt understand this.
---
If you have mob agro, the tank is generating no rage from that mob, so it does impact them. Also the healer would rather heal the plate wearing tank over the clothy. Sure, as long as your bubble holds it is fine. But if it goes down before it dies, you are now taking a lot more damage than the tank would. Thatd be my argument anyway. 
---
I leveled as shadow. Start the instance slow, figuring out the tanks agro ability. Then I start working in a swp on skull on the pull, if that goes well add wanding immediately. If that goes well, maybe start mixing in flays. Basically just ramp up slowly. 
---
I only mind blast sub 50% when I'm confident I either have the threat space to do so or the range that the mob will die before it reaches me. Trash packs are not usually dps races, just realize the group will do fine even if you are not melting faces at 100%. 
---
Often found myself as a real hybrid support role switching between healing and dps a lot. Doing as much cleansing as possible, bubbling noobs pulling agro, throwing renew on people when out of shadow, interrupts... etc. Seemed to be the best use to the group for a clean instance run.
---
The irony is mineable.  In fact I'm going to steal this node from you.
---
Bubble mine and hearth! Go go go.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt expect anything new to be good even after classic, they haven‚Äôt learned anything except that we‚Äôll pay to play the old shit again.
---
Not that I expect them to do it, but they might start releasing new games based on the old shit.
---
It's petty to report people for knowingly abusing game mechanics by asking for a layer invite?
---
Didn‚Äôt know there was different types of window lickers. You must know a lot about it.
---
They may have, still not an intended game mechanic nonetheless and puts certain players at an advantage over the rest. When done repeatedly for the intention of benefitting off something that was unintended by blizz in the first place is when it becomes abuse.
---
Nah he explained it fine, and it's literally exactly what I've been telling you. Most of your replies seem to be centered on making me admit that I'm just not "hardcore" enough for these guilds. It shouldn't be personal. All I'm saying is that these "hardcore" guilds should change their approach for classic because classic guilds offer nothing/almost nothing that "normal" guilds can't offer. I predict people will slowly realize this and jump ship from the overly strict/unfun guilds. You're reading far too deep into my replies
---
Right? I don't need to add a feud with somebody who's gonna make my quest take 4x as long.
---
You're totally welcome to, but most skill levelups that you skip are because they're quite expensive
---
Getting a mount right at level 40 isn't difficult but doesn't come for free, so it's best to be frugal until you can hit that huge milestone
---
Some skills hardly change when they level up. I have an ability that silences spellcasting (kick) and the next upgrade... adds a few points of damage. So I could do an extra 5 damage a fight, or I could hold off for now.
---
You will eventually buy all your skills, it's just prioritizing which ones are important for leveling
---
The 'Talent Tree' is where you will actually make a 'build', as there will usually be meta talents that are optimal for your role. That is where you will have room to make your own character. But the skillups are just next ranks of your abilities and don't really change the playstyle.
---
The initial point of failure for most guilds is poor leadership, yeah, but roster issues will get them all in the end, like death and taxes. It's the creeping cancer that catches up to every guild no matter how well run.
---
Needless to say we've probably side-barred this enough, and perhaps I am conflating. I'm not a big fan of "hardcore guilds" for the simple fact that they often elevate skill above personality, and if I'm going to spend hours of my recreation time interacting with people I want them to be fun and personable, not screeching meme kids or thin lipped elitist dipshits. So I self-select out of the process, because that world is not for me. I can see finding the OP egregious if he expects guilds to warp their culture to fit his preferences.
---
They have hundreds of people in the Olympus guilds all because they support Asmongold. They are fine with him getting first pick of all the loot. The odds that this will cause any single regular Olympus player even one upgrade is really low. 
---
The problem with Asmon running loot council is not him. Of course he's going to get geared. It's that he will give the loot to his buddies. The raid content isn't hard enough to force him to prioritize gearing certain roles first (after himself as tank) so he is free to give the loot to whoever he feels like. 
---
And loot drama is drama and that's what drives his content. So not only do you lose out on stuff but you get mocked mercilessly in front of a huge audience by someone who is profiting off of all of this. But hey, that's what they signed up for. No doubt most will find a way to rationalize it to themselves until they quit.
---
Can't blame 'em for trying.  They'd be laughing about that for years.
---
If the mage plays correctly it will be almost impossible stun lock him lol.
---
You're kidding yourself if you think "Classic+" will have brand-new content.
---
**If** they do it, at best it will be the same story with altered difficulty and drop rates, and maybe alternate paths to places (if they keep flying out of the game)
---
Nameplate add-ons I know  bug out often for me with tags? But I'm not sure.  They threw dots and it was the last mob to die, so maybe they noticed and just figured finishing it off from half health and waiting for the respawn would be easier than kiting and resetting?  Or they just weren't paying full attention or figured the grey was a ui bug.
---
This is Classic NOW, what are you talking about?
---
I remember this being a huge issue when I played classic, that people only looked at the color of the item and if it was a better color than the one they had on they would use it regardless of anything else. I remember we would have dungeon runs where our tank could barely stay alive and we would inspect him to find that he was wearing cloth blues with int and spirit on them, or leather blues with agi, etc. Usually these people were wearing a hodge podge of gear intended for other classes and trying to tank a dungeon with it. So many people didnt even care about the stats on the items and only cared if they were rare or epic.
---
Me
---
Do you feel the same way towards people who watch sports? Why watch someone else play when you can just go do it yourself. It's the same thing. Maybe you're not in the mood. Just want to lay back and relax. At least with streaming there's a more personal connection besides for some 1m post game interview with whatever player.
---
Having a large pool of tools and making the min-maxed strategies fun is an inherent contradiction.
---
The more tools you have, the greater the chance of an unintended mechanic breaking the game. Since these interactions weren't planned for, the dev didn't make them fun. This goes double for things that are clearly exploits (ie save scumming).
---
Expecting an optimal play style to be fun is too much to hope for in all but the simplest games.
---
Man with people like this I am worried for the future of classic. Private servers barley made a profit, and the numbers of players on the private severs didn't even outperform games like  American truck sim. Since the announcement of classic private servers exponentially took off but to say they were doing great before that is a huge over statement. American Truck Simulator has 3k avg active users, which is about the same as any of the private servers before Classic was announced. Lasting years isn't a metric that blizzard would want. If anything the number of players playing classic would be a huge incentive for them to create classic +.
---
I really liked the fist weapon for my elemental shaman. I loved the story behind it.
---
The poor life of decor npc's, lol
---
ZF
---
Well, that's a bummer :(

So we should transfer to a realm with no activity at 60 and what, wait a month for the server to level up so we can raid again?
---
If blizzard offered a more reasonable option like a transfer to a non- fresh server, peoole would be more willing to swap. As it stands, Earthfury and the other transfer realms are the most likely to end up dead.
---
Yea , we are fine dealing with queues.
---
But the fact is blizzard gave us 8 realms on launch, when they clearly need 10 times that number. 
---
Every single one of those original realms has fucked queues. Blizzard was not adequately prepared and failed to assess the playerbase of the game. Layering seems to have become a problem for them, not a solution. 
---
They then offer an undesirable option to essentially halt your progress by transferring to a dead realm. Noone at high level would take it.
---
Blozzard created this problem and has failed to provide a reasonable solution.
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
Ohh cool. Would you say in general retail would be good to play through, at least as far as lore is concerned? Like, if I treat it like a single player game, could I have fun? Last I really played was MoP.
---
I don't have a rogue in Classic and I can't remember what Garrote did in classic. Did it still silence the target for X number of seconds? If so I'd have garroted him instead of cheap shoted cause Mages in classic can blink in a stun.
---
Druids need to go all or nothing into feral cat or feral bear.
---
You stick to your role and jump into others when absolutely necessary.
---
Warlock or priest would be your best option because shaman and druid level with melee specs. You can theoretically level as elemental shaman or balance druid, but it would be significantly slower and more frustrating.
---
Go 31/20/0 and yes you can tank perfectly fine as fury/arms even up to UBRS
---
Lmfao
---
Like everyone else said, Shimmering Flats is great for that bracket.
---
I‚Äôm on arcanite reaper , it‚Äôs a new server it‚Äôs not gonna be poppin overnight. Take that bs somewhere else.
---
Never told a white lie huh?
---
It‚Äôs included in Geforce Experience.
---
You just have to enable it. Do Alt+z while in a game and it‚Äôll open up the menu.
---
Nah the door to the last boss wouldn't open unless you completed it.
---
I really don't. There were something like 8 million players in vanilla, and still managed to stray far from the core in short order. Also, since classic and retail share a sub, it's unlikely they will differentiate. They'll see an uptick in subscription numbers, and assume things are back on track and everyone's happy.
---
Getting full BiS blues isn't endgame for you?  Raiding isn't casual or not an hour a week casual.  Play if it's fun, stop if it isn't.  Pvp and battlegrounds is coming.  This is an easy grind for casual players.
---
No, just hover your mouse pointer over them in party frames, then click the macro button. I can still have the boss targeted to dot or wand.
---
Lol yup. But you can use a lower rank and thanks to your gear it'll still be a massive heal.
---
I agree.
---
The only response to that should be "Where?" and then you either 1) avoid cuz you're still leveling, or 2) go hunting.
---
I like it when people tell me of the opposite faction's location. I don't want them to stop, but when people reply with "BooHoo, deal with it" its kinda like, why are you putting the person down and not jumping to their defense?
---
Tell Blizzard Wrath heroics were too easy
---
Blizzard makes Cata heroics hard like TBC
---
First massive sub loss since game launch
---
My personal take is that longevity is overrated. I prefer for a game to be a complete experience with a beginning, middle, and end. I personally don't care if the game dies in 5 years or not, I'll be moving on to something else. I don't see why there is a need to keep the game going for a decade or longer. That said I guess it doesnt matter to me what they change in several years, I'm just enjoying the experience right now.
---
He means rep/mats to farm and guild.
---
Anduin
---
&gt;Blizzard didn't ban anyone for server hopping when it was possible in retail which is basically the same thing as changing layers. You're waisting your time.
---
These are not even remotely close to the same thing. I probably am wasting my time though, that's part of what's so frustrating about it.
---
All I‚Äôm sayin is every class has its niche.
---
I was at that blizzcon when he said it. I‚Äôve always had this feeling that blizzard Ogs have felt a responsible guilt for how addicting wow was.  
---
Feel like mike morhaime and crew are glad not have that blood their hands this time
---
Thousand Needles, specifically the Shimmering Flats in the southeast corner has a lot of low-30s quests.
---
Can you replace the clown with faces of meth? Would be much more accurate.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I bet more realistically its: if they are farming in my area, I attack them and they kill me, If I don't like their name, I attack them and they kill me. If they've killed me before, I try again, and they kill me.
---
Yea considering it's in Silithus it's probably something that got added with AQ.
---
Noice, you will get better with time dont worry
---
What are a level 2 Horde and a level 1 Alliance warrior doing in Duskwood?
---
Are there stealthed rogues I don‚Äôt see in this photo?
---
Going into contested zones that low level without an escort seems like a good way to waste time at the local graveyard.
---
That's not reserving gear, that's literally ninja looting.
---
Let me give you all my upvote for this perfect meme!
---
Herrrrrrrres Pally!
---
There's also a difference between complaining about being ganked, and alerting your faction that you've just been ganked. If I say that I've just been ganked in LocalDefense, it's not because I'm upset about it. It's because I'm trying to alert people in the area to look out.
---
Judging by some of the whispers I've received, some people don't seem to understand the difference.
---
I want to get to know all the lore and do all the quests in the game, even if it takes me all the time in the world. I just want to enjoy the game. 
---
What is the best class to be a completionist in the game?
---
That‚Äôs what it was for.
---
This makes me sad I got so hyped and believed Blizzard this time around ....
---
Rexarr is a guildie of mine nice
---
Are you H or A? If H, give Shaman a go. You'll want to be Enhancement up to 40 for leveling ease but after that you can tale a real stab at Elemental. Primo PvP spec is 30/0/21 or 31/0/20 so you're a dedicated spellcaster with offheal capabilities.
---
Competing with other guilds for best times is fun. The end would be setting record speed clears etc. At that level of play people aren‚Äôt concerned about gear, or personal gain. 
---
That‚Äôs like saying well Alabama and the patriots win every year, what‚Äôs the point of playing football at all? I‚Äôm a competitive person, I happen to think I am good enough to play better with the best. So for me the personal gratification comes from proving it with my guild who happens to be my friends. 
---
Gear doesn‚Äôt matter to me, it‚Äôs the competition that does. We may set a fastest time in the Server or US and get complacent but when someone beats that time it lights a fire under your ass to want to take it back. I dunno, it sounds stupid to some people I am sure, but we enjoy it.
---
Uldum was suppose to be a titan facility. 
---
&gt;    Uldum is a research facility for the Creators in their continuing efforts to enhance the biosphere of Azeroth. Specific information regarding their work as it relates to Uldum is restricted to those individuals who possess the Plates of Uldum in their disc sets. 
---
Data repositories inside the Uldum complex have been programmed to address specific experiments and data compliations: please refer to them for detailed information.
---
Nope its actually in Kent, that would have been even more coincidental given your faction/class combo!
---
Thank you x
---
Plot twist 2: I never played vanilla i like mage and i never knew how good mage is before actually tried. And yes now im loving it.
---
This entire conversation has been about competitive PVP and specifically retail arena PVP. I don't know why you seem to think I'm talking about world PVP and ganking. Because here's a secret...
---
I think ganking is perfectly fair game and anyone crying over it needs to HTFU.
---
You can use lower rank spells.
---
Omg call the semantics police. Please dont take me to Hyperbole Jail!
---
Sure it's used for more. When tanks generally "stance dance" they refer to breaking fears. Obviously you can call any stance change stance dancing.
---
No where did I say that was the macro, he can google the god damn macro. Literal 1000s of people have it posted. I was justing saying what it did.
---
Stance dance next to a /dancing dwarf and tell me it's not 80% the same.
---
You need to chill
---
I have a cat that routinely wakes up from naps and demands to sit between me and the screen. He insists on attention, and also likes watching my character run around on the screen. His highest level of interest so far has been murlocks. I can credit him with 3 corpse runs thus far.
---
At this point most quests there should be green for you.  There are a buttload of quests in Stranglethorn Vale, like so many you'll fill up your quest log.
---
They're not lying in my experience, 40-43 are tough because you're too high to get a lot of xp from SM Cath (maybe 40 its not so bad) but you're too low to run Ulda or ZF. You can probably run ulda at 43 if you have enough higher level people depending on your role. The quest hubs in the early 40s are also much less dense quest-wise (at least on horde, again, in my experience) a lot of them have quests that can only be done in the late 40s.
---
Once you can comfortably do Ulda and Zul Farrak they offer very good xp. ZF groups are easy to find too as a lot of people are in tanaris compared to badlands.
---
This is about streamers. Streamers aren't playing the game to have an authentic classic wow experience. They're streaming to be entertaining for hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of people. Their goals are different than yours.
---
You laugh, but a warlock buffed me and my wife with this while we were killing the Naga off the coast of Desolace. It was extremely helpful and we even found them and asked for it again. I was also able to get about 2 stacks of mithril in 20 minutes.
---
Pretty 10/10,  if you. Can just run and still make the ‚Äújump‚Äù
---
I've pretty much given up on fade as it doesn't work on any of mobs in the instances that are my level or higher. I won't be taking the threat talent as I solo quest more than instances.
---
Potions r good.
---
At first I thought this was the undead boss in SM Cath lmao
---
Almost everything teams up well with druids, even other druids. Don't worry about racial abilities or bonuses, they are miniscule to the animations and sounds of your character that you are experiencing every moment of playing the game.
---
Going druid/druid or rogue/druid has the advantage of being able to sneak (stealth) together but you will also be competing for the same armor type (equipment made from leather).
---
I think I am viewing it too seriously.  I dreamed about all of these places, starting with the AQ gate, Uldum, Grim Batol.  I just don't see Blizzard doing anything special with all of these mysterious places that have been revealed. 
---
I could see them rewriting the Deathwing story, releasing it similar to Ony and Nef rather than the armored plating, elemental tentacle shit show it became.  That could be the start of Classic+ after releasing TBC and Wrath Classic.
---
I agree that it's ninja looting or something just as shitty, but there's people who don't.
---
General consensus is saving up for your level 40 mount is key. It‚Äôs a huge QoL improvement and will speed up your leveling as well.
---
xD
---
Is it even worth it to do the whirlwind axe quest?
---
Money is tight, as I'm starting to save for my mount, and the charms for the summon are selling for around 50s a piece on the AH. Spending the equivalent of 10g in resources along with a decent chunk of time doesn't seem worthwhile.
---
Millennials are generally people who were school aged at the turn of the 21st century.  So 25 - 37 year olds.  Or at the very least old enough to remember the 90‚Äôs. 
---
Gen Z is late 90‚Äôs through the late 00‚Äôs iirc.
---
I also bet most of them are playing in a widescreen resolution on their flat LCD Monitor and not in 4:3 on a big ass chunk of CRT Monitor on a 32 bit pentium II
---
It was, and that's why you need to clear raids quickly so you have more time to grind and need gear so you get honor faster.
---
It depends how successful classic is. If it continues to have a huge player base then they would be incentivised to keep people playing, whether through TBC or classic+ type content.
---
Hell, going back at 36 for arathi/alterac and you still gank those lvl 20-30 horde
---
you can definitely cancel predatory strike,
---
I bet they are not inviting you any more lol
---
Then you pop Cold Snap and another Ice Block. You get to watch 10 horde circling you for 20 seconds, just wasting time.
---
If it wasn't for wife aggro I would have died of a blot clot by now.
---
Also you got like 25% dodge anyway
---
Neither side has the market cornered on assholes. It's a mixed bag all around.
---
I crit a shaman the other day outside brd for 1700 aim shot. Felt good. Not for him I'm sure.
---
F all the warriors that ninja\`d this in the past 3 days from me. :)
---
&gt;I know being Ele will make my life easier as a dungeon healer with the larger mana pool etc
---
Your mana pool will be the same as it would be as enhance with an int set, it does save you bag space though.
---
I switched to ele in the 50s, imo it's worth the respec cost. kill speed is better than enhance and more importantly it's far less boring. You won't be able to get NS until 60 so EM is a better investment for levelling, but you'll have to respec at 60 if you do that and want to play NS
---
yea dude fuck those assholes killing players from enemy faction on a PvP server
---
I never understand when you have people that moan and complain about someone saying "some 'x' scum camping me at '\_\_\_\_\_\_", omg. can someone give me a hand?" That is literally what you're supposed to do and that promotes world pvp encounters. I think the only time you should complain about someone mentioning getting ganked is when they're complaining *how people even gank at all* and *why cant they just leave me alone.*
---
That‚Äôs not even humblebragging. The madlad just legit told a long winded story to let us know he got a green post. That‚Äôs just straight up bragging
---
Horde players feel guilt?
---
So answer SS spam to this question.  That seems to be the best solution for a sword combat rogue in a group, and is reccomended elsewhere as well.  Better than a garrote that won't last full duration and better than a cheap shot that will end with a mob in your face and a tank with no agro.
---
Just because I didn't main a class doesn't mean I haven't played it or don't know a thing or two about it.  I had to gear/spec/figure rotations for my wife's rogue since she couldn't be bothered, and she always seemed to end up top damage without constantly pulling agro so I think I know what I'm talking about here.
---
You need to learn to have mature discussions, without talking down to people.  And "kid" is just low-key insulting my maturity... kind of ironic.  Anger seems to be an issue for you.  I hope you get some time to work on that.
---
Negative, H side Kirtonos. Good luck, I'm sure there are plenty out there that need a competent Mage!
---
You could just...opt out of it entirely, no?
---
Lol, I did this once I was trying to find acorns in Stone Talon. Couldn't find crap until I turned it down.
---
Sorry we don‚Äôt sit on the classic wow reddit refreshing the new posts all day.
---
Would that mean no Harrison Jones?
---
Retail meme. Getting aggro is your fault and your problem.
---
This looks good to me, it lets them take all the players who are interested after reading an advertisement like that!

https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
It's crazy how addicting wow is. I've never played anything like it.
---
A lot of people have the spirit of a warrior in them so they decide to play as a warrior, not everyone wants to be a shape shifting Druid or a totem summoning shaman. Some people like it old school just weapons and fighting. I myself rolled warrior because it was my first class in retail( I have like 3 warriors in retail) so I just would let feel right not having my main be a warrior. Sometimes I do get burnt out and want to be a caster but then I don‚Äôt wanna start leveling all over again so just stick thru it, take a break and get back to grind

The problem was they were endlessly farm bosses with rare BoE drops and making hundreds of thousands of gold and completely fucking up the economy on their servers. 
---
Only servers where guilds did this were effected. Its possible many servers remain unharmed by this exploit.
---
They were talking about going to Grobbulus because of a perceived lack of competition because they thought us softies for being RP and they wouldn't have to deal with other big PvP guilds. 
---
It's what bullies do.
---
wow, that is epic mount money right there!
---
Save up for Epic mount and/or buy stuff on AH to level up your professions.
---
Came here to say basically exactly this.
---
just go play retail and stop whining
---
Right into a pack of murlocks.
---
Because you don't know what is in there beforehand. I personally never roll because I don't need the trash that is in there 99,9% of the time. It would be sad missing out that one time when it actually contains something of value.
---
You seem more salty than anyone here.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm sure STVietnam is your original content.
---
Yup 100%. This was after I did princess and grizlok. 100% kite him to princess about 14-15min runs.

Must be rocking a nice authentic Vanilla setup if you got a yellow bar for latency ;)
---
Game on brother
---
Most had a strong basis in lore. Stromkar, Scepter of Sargeras, Thas'dorah, Felo'melorn, etc.
---
I hated flying too, but I'm biased because I don't even like mounts lol
---
He's charging what he perceives as a fair price for his time investment. Lets go with an analogy. 
---
You have all the pieces you need to make a car. You meet a mechanic who is willing to build your car for what you both decide is a fair price, but he isn't available for an undetermined amount of time. 
---
Another person comes along who has a machine that instantly puts the car together and is ready to go immediately. He knows you want it quick and is available for that but his expertise and speed cost money so his price point is different. 
---
It is not the first mechanics responsibility to speed up, and it's not the seconds responsibility to come down in price. 
---
It's really just your responsibility to decide if the demand is monetarily high enough to justify the speed. 
---
He's in his right to charge you what he deems fair. It was on you to pay up or wait. You can try to work him down in price, but he's not beholden to move.
---
I‚Äôve run it 9 times and had the scarlet leggings drop 7 times. I got the axe and the shoulder thank god, one drop each, and since I was tanking I tried to pick no warriors/paladins/hunters/shamans. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get the helm at this rate. I‚Äôm lvl 42 and the mobs are starting to turn grey in armory.
---
In just telling the reason why.
---
Lol what? Sounds like people who lack knowledge. The group should be rolling for all chests.
---
That's what you get for rolling horde
---
Haha was in a party with the same chap... hang on he used the same pick up line.
---
I hate doing these and hate being so indecisive. My choices are warlock or hunter. Mainly for some raiding and mostly pvp.
---
Warlock pros: nearly unkillable 1v1 as sl/geared. Excellent pve dps scaling. Free mount
---
Hunter: great 1v1 pvp if you can kite, seemingly poor scaling in pve?
---
Help me choose! I mained a warrior in vanilla and hate dial wielding 1h so they are out, my alt was a pvp hunter that i was very skillful with. I have a screencap of my killing my servers HWL 2h enhance shaman in the 50‚Äôs because i knew how to kite/trap properly. But i like the general immortal 1v1ness of soul link locks. Yet it bothers me that i could beat them with a hunter if you max range/kite.
---
Dude you can 2 man wc at level 24. Early dungeons are not hard at all.
---
Test
---
It doesn't make sense for Blizzard to send you there because the "more active realms" are too full too. The only reason they aren't facing huge queues is because most of the time their players can all fit into the number of layers Blizzard is limiting each server to. 
---
Hell, even Earthfury has around 16K people right now so if layering were turned off today they would have a queue too. Blizz is counting on the player base massively shrinking before Phase 2. If that doesn't happen, all bets are off.
---
&gt;The reason for all the problems we‚Äôre experiencing is because Blizzard did not actually ‚Äúfind an old 1.12 backup‚Äù‚Äî they are liars.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;They‚Äôre using a public built server (private server) that they‚Äôve heavily tweaked to get ‚Äúas close as possible‚Äù to what existed before.
---
I would love to see your evidence of this. Becaue it sounds like you are just spitting non sense.
---
I guarantee you won't provide me with any reliable source to prove this statement.
---
&gt;  I'm rolling anyway.
---
Can't roll when it's master loot babe.
---
That‚Äôs where I think I‚Äôm headed. Is dungeon tier sets gonna be viable for endgame PvP?
---
I really hope for you that you're roleplaying here, otherwise that is really damn cringy.
---
Much more work involved in that than a buff
---
That sounds cool
---
Which might sound like a bad thing using Classics core values to create money. For the players though this will only be good, if Classic earns more than expected, that makes for a huge incentive to figure out why people love classic so much, what they can do to keep the people that love classic and how to create more content that lines up with those things so that they can make more money. Are you going to tell me if they release a huge Classic + expansion that kept classic's core values the same, some core values, Hard to get loot improvements, no additional flying mounts/gimiky mechanics, your character is weak not a god, more content, more quests, more etc. That you wouldn't atleast try it to see if you liked it, even if it cost 40$? We are possibly talking about Classic but a real classic experience where you can't just google or questie everything, and some more content to boot.

I have a 42 mage right now with a huge gap in quests until at least 43, if not 44. I also have a 30 hunter with another gap in quests until 31 or 32. My mage is AoE specced after being baited into it by my guild, and now stares down a 15g respec cost, since AoE is not only super awful right now since everyone and their mother does it, but now apparently it also makes you a terrible person and I'm a bit sick of receiving pms about it. I could eat the cost if I knew at least where I could grind with frostbite/shatter to 43 without having to compete for tags. I'm also a bit too high for SM Cath and a bit too low for ZF, which doesn't help. 
---
The 30 hunter could do RFK to get to 31 and keep questing... if a group existed. Every dungeon I have attempted to do on this character, not a single invite in hours of spamming while grinding. I honestly like playing this character more for leveling, but know I will like my mage more if I had to choose between either at 60. 
---
Any tips for which of these characters I should keep going with? I like the mage more, but honestly being a mage right now feels pretty bad since everyone and their mother seems to have it out for you and will intentionally fuck with you or send hateful messages because you're a mage. Not to mention how spellcleave groups are the only groups that exist for mages apparently, not wanted on anything else, which is only better than the hunter by virtue of having any dungeon groups at all.

My fear has been doing that a lot. Mobs get pushed out of the world and my demon can chase them but they are LoS‚Äôd until they return to the material world.
---
&gt;that I wouldn‚Äôt trust them when new content.
---
I'd trust them but first, we as a community really need to have a civil conversation about what the core design pillars of classic are. Like to me server community and reputation are hugely important so any new content or game design must should either reinforce this pillar or be neutral. 
---
Anyways...we're a ways off from this if ever
---
When/What are the class quests for a Warlock - first time running with a Warlock. Like, I know Paladins can unlock res through a questline. a
---
Aside from demons - what else can be earned from quests instead of just at the trainer?
---
Much appreciated.
---
Ya. Just camps with fast respawn rates. Mobs spawn in say 30 seconds rather than minutes.
---
If you're out of ideas, the best thing to do is opening a ticket about it, Blizzard *will* do their best to help you.
---
If you're alliance on Stalagg I'll give you the charms!
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Can confirm. Just spent 1 minute researching this. Why didn't I listen to your warning? Why!?
---
Level 30 mage thinking of just grinding SM for a few levels. Downside is I would be missing out on mining nodes for skillups and likely better gold from questing. Worth it?
---
Not true in the slightest. Getting killed by a skull is a gank. Getting killed by a group of people of varying levels relative to you is a gank. Getting killed by a person your level while you‚Äôre low or killing mobs is also a gank.
---
Aren‚Äôt you supposed to answer that yourself?
---
Classic? Mods are sleeping
---
1) private server functionality was vastly different in a lot of regards (Example: look at how wrong we were all these years about dungeon XP)
---
2) Aren't a lot of players in APES from a few of the top guilds across the most played private servers? That means they have more experience on this version of the game than anyone else in the world (hence why they were able to blow through all the content in less than 2 weeks).
---
3) What would streamers get out of this? Would they get praise from this? Well sure we would praise them if they brought a game-breaking bug into the spotlight so that blizz can fix it. Even if you brought this bug into the spotlight, I would praise you. Would streamers make more money from this? No. Would streamers be given an advantage from this? No. Does we all want classic to continue to be successful? Yes, so why not let the top dogs rush through content and make clickbait so that MORE people come play?
---
WW axe is so nice, but you can always use the corpsemaker at 29 and bonebiter in the mid 30's. WW axe at 30 is more about the experience of dragging your friends/guildies through hours of farming so you can have your axe.
---
should have thought about it before transfering to a low pop server. i bet your like level 26 anyway you should just reroll
---
You can make 20-50 gold an hour (depending on how quickly you can kill stuff and how luck you are with drops) just killing goblin, princess, and the croc, and vendoring the items they drop.
---
If you are a warlock or a hunter you can skip the trash and kill only those 3 bosses. They all have weapons in their loot table that sell nicely to vendors. 
---
Once you get some okay gear its not hard to make 40 gold per hour and instance capping while farming Mara. 
---
Lets say you farm 14 hours a day for 2 days. 28 hours of farming at 40 gph = 1,120 gold. Not certainly inside the realm of possibilities for a warlock.
---
Still doesn't work half the time for me. Got petpassive in my macro. Sometimes it never drops combat at all, sometimes it takes between 1-4 secs. This makes it annoying to use in pvp, and very unreliable in pvp because people will ofc try to instantly re-target and attack. Combat needs to drop instantly for it to work in pvp, but it almost never does.
---
You‚Äôre a rogue. You‚Äôre going to dodge stuff even without evasion. It‚Äôs better to eat an overpower or two than to eat an overpower or two, an MS, two autoattacks, and a whirlwind.

Was thinking about finding or starting a guild for relatively casual adults on Netherwind. 
---
Wife and I just wanna run dungeons, quest, PVP without drama. We can take a 15 min break if your kid wakes up or you gotta change a diaper, just spare us the kids that forget it‚Äôs a game and forgot how to have fun.

/old

regardless of when the fight started, the mage was still able to nova, poly and evocation to \~75% mana. I feel like he could still do the same after another blizzard or 2. mages can reset fights very easily.
---
yes yes it is...

Did you give yourself silver lol

This may be the most 2003-2007ish thing ive ever seen.

Howl breaks stealth and you should be throwing a hamstring on them ASAP. There goes their stealth/opportunity 'advantage'.

Won‚Äôt do shit versus enemies that have a mount if you don‚Äôt.

If you know how to do this please let me know, but that sounds familiar ive probably tried this but ill check agaon

What? I was making a joke. Why are you getting upset?

Scarlet monastery is broken up into 4 instances... left side is graveyard. Next one up is library on the right side where you get a key in a chest at the end boss... That gets you into the door on the right and left, but the door on the right is armory which is the next stop, and then cathedral on the left which is the last SM runs you will do.
---
Graveyard is short and not great for drops, but keep an eye out for rare spawns on the side. Loot for rogues and casters. Library is more caster loot, armory is tank/dps gear for warriors and pally's, cathedral is party loot for casters, tanks, and dps

---
No they didn't. Servers died off after naxx and new ones had to open up to cycle the players towards new servers for a "fresh" experience. Once naxx comes out 90% of the players will drop the game until a new piece of content is announced.

I wonder if that's why you can't shield random people - as there is a possible negative effect from having the shield on you. I can't think of any negative from having renew on you, or being healed in general.
---
Raiding and PvP is more challenging and more interesting in retail, but the MMO world feels hollow and rewards are less meaningful.  It‚Äôs a shame that WoW wasn‚Äôt able to progress through the years in a way that kept its MMO soul.  Maybe one day we‚Äôll get the best of both worlds with Classic+ or a whole new game entirely.
---
&gt; It will be common for tanks to reserve rare items, even every single green and grey from the entire dungeons for money. 
---
LOL you sound like Alex Jones. I played Classic and this shit never happened.

Wow can never get anywhere near EVE level conspiracies and thefts.  What in wow can compare to stealing a titan or super from someone, or their BPO collection?
---
I feel for you man. Are people still using keyboard clickers to stay online while they sleep so they don't have to queue in the morning?
---
That would really piss me off.
---
I was reading the Life at 60 link and I just want to put out there that I think I was probably the worst shaman in vanilla and BC. I was full enhancement, but I don't recall putting down many totems ever. Even in raid groups. I think I thought that the benefits weren't good enough to bother using them. Maybe I'm wrong, I'll try to go through some old screenshots and look at my action bars
---
Maybe he's been stuck in vanilla wow, kinda like Tron.
---
Butter-knife eared b\*tch.
---
At 35 you can upgrade to get past 225 I think.  Could be wrong.
---
Guy was saying he was reserving all greens and blues boe and bop for sm cath runs. We did 1 run with group loot where he just needed most items and let a few drops go to other classes. Started a second run and after the first pull sets it to Master loot. Healer and dps left right away and the rest of us bailed after 5 mins of looking for replacement. 
---
I get people are after specific drops but you can communicate that before it starts. I'm down to pass a drop if you tell me off the bat 'been running this 7 times for corpsemaker I really need it if it drops can I haven't. But if you think you're gonna reserve all drops and set it to ML to get that chances are you're gonna have a hard time keeping a party.
---
Well I'm back to +1 so.... Is there a way for you to Bubble Hearth off of Reddit?
---
how do you know that "bf" doesn't stand for "best friend" or "beef fettuccine"?
---
That really didn't happen though.  It only happened here and there.  My vanilla experience was pvp server only too.
---
I don't remember if you're not an honorable target when you got off the flight path or that most flight paths were guarded.
---
I remember getting killed or people trying to kill me at neutral spots, but that's where I expected it.
---
Problem is bud is that these no changes guys literally want no qol
---
You never know when they are going to be in the water!  Underwater breathing alll daaay
---
As a skinner who leveled to 60 with a partner with FFA on all the time this was soo damn annoying. Getting no loot from the mob probably isn't a bug but breaking the corpse for everyone else in the party has to be a bug.
---
Armory is doable I think, may need to be a little higher for cath.
---
I'm not saying there's anything wrong the environment of a top raiding guild. I'm saying that "top" classic guilds seem to be using the same tactics as "top" retail guilds while offering peanuts in return. Faster clears? How does that compare to retail guilds which are actually offering the ability to kill bosses other "normal" guilds don't have access to? Classic guilds seem to believe that they are offering something that can't be earned anywhere else, like retail guilds. But they're mistaken. The only thing classic guilds offer at the moment is faster clears. That is a small perk in comparison to hardcore retail guilds offering the ability to kill previously unseen bosses, but they both use the same recruiting style. I predict that will change soon, because (1) "top" classic guilds don't offer much other than "fast clears", and (2) classic guilds require 40 players which is significantly more difficult to put together than 20/25/whatever.
---
Yes and people want it to play out for awhile without changing.
---
Try to save your hearthstone CD and make the nearest inn your home where you're going to be for a while. Then make it a habit to hearth before logging out.
---
I typically use my hearth only if I know I'll be on for at least another hour and I'm very far without a flight path.
---
definitely not haha what
---
Huh. I'll have to try that when I get
---
Only horde has this kind of privilege, grats on thinking you doled out some just desserts while playing the overpowered, overpopulated faction.
---
Alliance guys were probably just trying to do their part to even out the imbalance

This is bad.

But it could be good, making the game more difficult ;)

original, accept that classic has to evolve like old school runescape eventually.
---
Start with removing the buff/debuff limits and slightly buffing specs that do 30% of the damage of a meta spec
---
Nah the invisible joke was around back when he was a 100% drop.. definitely just a joke about how invisible and invincible can be confused to be the same word.
---
2 months left in P1, then 3 months of P2. That means P3 in 5 months is very likely
---
Wyrmthalak is 98% alliance.. wtf is going on with that server.
---
He was killing people 20 levels under so i'm sure you're right.
---
meh if im doing that i dont advertise in world chat what i do is /who specific lvls and classes and politely ask them if they'd like to join
---
How is an entire game full of mobs limited, eat a dick if you think aoe grinding quest mobs isn't a dick move
---
He can at least xfer his gold. You take your new character to Goblin AH, post something for way too expensive(i.e. an Apple for 30g), and then have your higher level character buy it out.
---
I generally just keep a renew rolling on them. If my mana is full  I go ahead and heal them up, but I'm not going out of my way to keep them topped at all times.
---
Locks have a pretty good toolset for restoring health on their own.
---
I have the theory that the Venn Diagram that shows a) people that confuse ganking with pvp and b) people that confuse rape with sex, is a circle
---
afaik the weather and day/night cycle are still present. They did however add toys that can change it to day or night. One having a 24hr CD and the other 2hrs or something. I dunno. I don't have them.
---
It's still the main time a warlock would want to summon. Meeting stone summons also cut back on the need to be out travelling in the world.
---

---
I'm...not upset? I'm responding to something you said with questions.

Somewhat related: does a rogue's instant poison effect still overwrite windfury?

Specifically to core gameplay..

It would be easy to have an event after nax40 where it splinters the timelines into Classic+ and retail, where the retail universe has no idea that Classic+ timeline exists.

/2 Trade in cities. Not optimal bc there is lfg chat, but it hasn‚Äôt really caught on yet for lower level instances it seems

If it gets to crazy you should say something.

Usually they‚Äôre more mindful of it

I've been hearing that a lot tbh, I think Grob might be an anomaly.
---
Atiesh takes around 3 months to make iirc. By the time we get to the point of needing a classic+ Kara I feel like most guilds at that point would have at least two of them in their roster, possibly three. I'm sure there will be plenty of people with the staff who'd be looking for a more progressed guild too so I'm sure any guild looking to do Kara could probably poach a staff or two from other guilds. Something similar happened with Dragonwrath in Cata.
---
invite.
---
every situation is different. if i'm against a warrior/rogue, i make sure my 1h/shield is up and kite them. if it's a caster, always purge and save your shock cooldown for earthshock (spell interrupt). if they are a class with spell interrupts (pummle/bash, kick, counterspell), i try to bait them into using it by fake casting a heal. then i full heal. 
---
generally, regardless of spec, i focused on being more efficient rather than just blowing all my mana and not being able to heal myself. most of the fights i used to win 1v1 while leveling in vanilla came down to me being able to get my big heal off. it helped that i was a tauren as well for warstomp + heal. once i got nature swiftness, 1v1 was a joke. except of they drain your mana. 
---
also, you can ghost wolf the fuck outa there if you're gonna lose. get out of combat, drink/eat and go right back in.
---
That‚Äôs just your opinion man
---
Tell them to eat or die for their rudeness. They have to stop and wait anyway. What is the point of making you drink 2 or 3 times as much slowing down the group.
---
Never, I just like watching dancing Tauren haha
---
Lol I think stable employment is another feature of the boomer lifestyle.  I got a comp sci degree and I‚Äôm not married so I would fit the stereotype well. The only thing off (including terrible facial hair) is I drink v8 energy drinks, not monsters.

---
The Alliance has a shared racial called Victim Complex.
---
What is a "top" guild in classic? Now compare that to what a "top" guild in Retail is. See the difference? That's my point, in a nutshell
---
They're always lying because they promote the idea that it can be easily duplicated.  I once made 400g in one hour of farming.....because a 375g purple boe dropped that I sold.
---
downvoted for actually giving a shit about karma.
---
I keep debating about going oomkin
---
couldn't tell you as i have tried it on any other classes, all i can say is try to get it so the spawn at different times, fighting 3 at once isn't easy
---
I never once proposed an argument to doing SM in sections I just wanted to rebut to the original comment saying SM is broken up because of the level range when clearly that's not the case as all dungeons from LVL 25 on till BRD pretty much have a 10 level range of mobs.
---
Your point is valid, but SM could easily have been one big dungeon and nobody would care. Infact it would nearly completely solve the "LFM CATH FARM ONLY MAGES AND WARLOCKS 40+ NO SCRUB ROGUES OR HUNTERS NEED APPLY"
---
I leveled a character for a bit yesterday as I am getting tired of the ludicrous overpopulation that happens at peak hours. I'm not going to play retail much though, as I'll probably just play other games when the world is overpopulated.
---
You aren't that far off if you have 55g at 38.5.
---
My advice would be to grind SM Cath runs to 40 and you'll probably be at around 70-75 gold with some luck.  Still a bit short but not too far off.
---
Honestly man, just try to enjoy the game. Run some SM, do some quests. 3hrs/day is actually quite a decent amount of time. Just keep at it and you will be 60 in no time
---
That's Vanilla.
---
Enjoying your online power trip? You're not special if you're a dick people will leave and you're stuck leveling as a warrior, alone, in the open world. You rely on the party just as much as they rely on you. I hope to god I never get stuck in a party with you.
---
They better be life-tapping. That's how they get mana to DPS with. Theyr'e a DPS class.
---
I don't heal them unless they're pulling aggro in which case, quit pulling aggro.
---
At this point you're far enough behind that there will be mages at all of the popular AoEing spots in every layer.
---

Priest here. Had a similar experience yesterday. Lock and mage kept pulling hate off of the tank (my brother, we were on voice in Discord), so I let them know very nicely that they were playing in a manner that wasn't conducive to everyone staying alive. They got pissed, and told me to just heal. So naturally, I decided to lay off healing them too much, and just focus on the tank. The warlock was especially bad. He would get hate on multiple mobs at the beginning of every pull, not waiting at all to give the tank any chance, and then start hellfiring himself to death. I let him kill himself in this manner a few times, and he proceeded to say "you DPSing or healing, champ?" My brother and I just laughed. Some people just can't be bothered to play the game in a way that makes sense.
---
Go back to retail.
---
Rip.
---
Once you get more of the tools for it, you gather up a shit ton of melee mobs and then aoe them down. Then you drink while they respawn.
---
It's a lot better xp/hour than a lot of other options for a lot of levels.
---
How the fuck you have so much gold and I can't even buy a mount at 40?
---
So....don't join that group? I don't see what the problem is.
---
So how do they run dungeons then?
---
‚ÄúYou mean the skills that require mana? The mana I don‚Äôt have? The skills I can‚Äôt use unless you SIT YOUR ASS DOWN AND LET ME DRINK GOR TEN FUCKING SECONDS? Those skills?‚Äù
---
I got 6 procs in a row on the steps of ZF yesterday. Felt goooood.
---
He said play the game. Why do you work? You lose precious wow time!
---
I would say Warrior/Healer or Rogue/Druid and even Mage/DPS would all be nice.
---
You're assisting the DPS by giving them a bigger pool to tap from. 
---
It's their job to know not to overextend their taps into risky territory. 
---
It's your job not to overextend your mana into risky territory.
---
They should only be tapping when they have the resources to do so, and if you havent given them the resources that should be an indicator that their DPS isnt a priority at that moment. If you're going OOM by trying to keep the warlock topped off then that's on you. If they are running their health into the toilet every chance they get and dying to a cleave or complaining that you arent healing enough, thats on them.
---
It's not an opinion it's fact. There's nothing hard about raiding Molten Core in 1.12

Not the judgement. The on hit proc that stuns them.

You shouldn't have an issue getting close to casters with Blessing of Freedom. If they use a skill to get away from you then you drop HoJ on them. Just save your HoJ for AFTER they attempt their escape C/D.
---
I believe there are addons that put damage numbers over the icons based on your +dmg
---
Yes. Heroes Ascent/Hall of Heroes is still some of my greatest gaming memories.
---
Thank you for responding! 
---
So I'm a Lvl 50 Enhancement Shaman now. Is there ever a need to buy your BiS from AH or is it just going to come from time grinding dungeons and raids.
---
Not at all. The analysis accounts for those sorts of biases.
---
It's in the name. Don't argue with the name.
---
Warlock prio.
---
I had to buy an orb of deception just to sneak into dungeons.
---
Lol no one will ever want to go to darn for any reason. It might as well be on the moon, and not worth it anyway since there isn‚Äôt a single forge in the entire goddamned city.
---
What do they drop, the cloth? Since you cant skin it
---
I mained mage from TBC (when I first started wow) to bfa, so I wanted something different. And the reason for choosing rogue is because of the amount of times I got ganked by rogues as a mage. But yes incineration very fun.
---
If I see someone die in front of me and I could have helped or I had started trying to help, I rez em.
---
Many other honorable mentions of course :)
---
Last boss is 29 Basil Thredd right?
---
Imagine being a mage and bragging about anything ever lmao. You should prob delete your char honestly.
---
Much.
---
I just want to see him say it. There‚Äôs really no reason to be like that
---
Personally? I would like to talk about it before Naxx comes so that we can understand what needs to be changed.
---
GY is stupid easy to farm for rares starting late 20s.
---
Not even my mainspec gear was all sm/ulda hahaha. I would say my healing set was comparable though to my ms gear but it sounds like your gear was better than mine. You should definitely be fine in ZF as long as your group doesnt pull like two packs at once or pull the basilisk boss without clearing the adds first. The bosses in ZF are very easy after him, it's just a matter of taking it slower on the trash. My tank was also a bit underlevelled/geared
---
That's the thing, all I ever do is provide a player name, class/race, level and location. Been plenty of cool people who come to help or investigate, but lots of people just assume I'm complaining and giving me a hard time.
---
build a reaction correlation to things happening to you regardless of the fight
---
low hp? pop related cooldowns and try to heal
---
just healed yourself successfully? see if you can root or moonfire+swarm or barkskin
---
if none of the above, go in bear or cat (bear for melee cat for caster) and do some damage and watch your health to repeat the cycle
---
LOL nobody said shit about camping anyone moron
---
You shouldn‚Äôt, those critties are beautiful
---
Fun fact: Originally the Tram should go from Sw to Darnassus. That‚Äôs why there is water and that‚Äôs why the minimap inside the Tram shows the Tram going from West to east, instead of going from South to North
---
I remember riding there for the first time. Was like "hey, this is cool, let's go again!" Jumped off, enjoyed the view and spent another half an hour going back. Good times
---
Not really... 57/43 ‚âà 1.3256, not 1.5.
---
Wouldn't be able to tell you. Guild just brought my rogue along to MC/AQ raids for her Hemo debuff. Once TBC came out I went combat backstab daggers and never got a decent sword drop, ever. No lie our guild was full clearing Kara, and most T5 content including the Hellfire world boss. Never, not once, did a damn sword drop when I was in the grp to go combat swords. I didn't get swords until Blizz allowed Arena PvP weapons to be buy able w/out a decent Arena rating.
---
You are overthinking it, dude.
---
You got ganked because you were a red player. You got camped because people like you come on reddit to make threads and harvesting that salt is worth the camping.
---
I love the idea of fleshing out vanilla!
---
Akshully... 
---
The census that wowhead posted showed that Alliance outnumbers horde on all PVE servers, and Horde outnumbers Alliance on all PVP servers.  
---
Seems like a difference between faction players to me.  Personally, I prefer PVE but my brosephs all rolled on Fairbanks so I got stuck in PVP.
---
That's not something macros will do. You can make a macro that targets the target of your target, though.
---
/assist     will target your ally's target when you have your ally targeted.
---
I don't know the exact wording, but you can add "mouse-over" to the assist macro, so that you will target the target of whatever your mouse is on.
---
Looking at your hot bars, are you mostly a single target or AOE build?
---
Are they nerfing mages ?
---
&gt;in my experience, the alliance spirit is ganking us when we are at half health and they are 5+ levels higher than we are 
---
Would it be possible to experience that from the horde?
---
Wow snowflakes.  Im a mage and efficient or not I die all the time I don‚Äôt need it to be any harder.  Solo and even one other person helping can be brutal
---
Tfw you are actually mad about simple horde vs alliance ribbing online and are acting like you are the smart one. xD
---
I stopped visiting the trainer at 34 or 35. The only one I would pick up is whirlwind and maybe pummel. Others are rank upgrades and feel you can wait on those. That‚Äôs 15-20 gold I can buy a level or two later to get the mount at 40.
---
What makes anyone think modern blizzard could do this properly?
---
No thanks. Layering and Spell Batching have been bad enough I don't need anymore Activision 2019 original content.
---
Yea but i'm not sure what lvl she is.
---
Cool observation. Anyone with max viewing distance set would be able to see it from there?
---
This BiS mindset is starting to get on my nerves. In vanilla you would never have seen a warrior rolling need on leather with a rogue. Period.
---
&gt; and horde players will only gank you if they outnumber or outlevel you so they will camp you.
---
It's really funny to me playing on both sides on pservers and now classic seeing "enemy faction do x" phrased in literally the same way regardless of which faction I'm currently playing in every guild or general chat.
---
Gotcha. So I can need on the herbs with my alch/eng though.
---
It literally doesn't matter.  We had ret palies back in the day too.
---
I think it just feels like that but the reality is everyone only attacks when it‚Äôs favourable. 
---
I‚Äôm only ever killed by alliance if there is 3 of them 
---
One groups of 3 were 10 levels more than the area and were just killing people over and over for no reason
---
The bigger thing here is also deny the warrior extra rage by not being able to land hits against you.
---
Rogues who don't use evasion against warriors deserve the instant deaths they'll get.
---
I've been collecting every quest for a particular dungeon, doing it once, two times max, and never going back. I'm level 58 now and have had so much fun actually questing, exploring the world and taking in the lore.
---
No leather from this, only wool
---
Having a lvl 60 in your group *should give close to nothing*, that's how it *should work*.
---
Not doing that is a bug.
---
And what do you mean by "originally"? There's no "originally" in a games out for 3 weeks, unless you mean private servers, but they don't count, thay have a lot of things there are not "originally vanilla" at all.
---
What's your pros and cons?
---
Also, Res Sick can get pushed off on the debuff list too
---
You are an idiot, I think that was your point....
---
Yeah absolutely, only damage would cancel effect. I don‚Äôt remember if that was changed out in BC or Wrath or whenever, but it was definitely a thing. It was fucking amazing.
---
Same! I'm a Data Scientist in Global Equities but I drink BANG energy drinks... The stereotype hits too close to home lol...
---
Oh I'm sorry, by that, I thought you just meant they're your kin.
---
"dagger ears" üòÇüòÇüòÇ fkin ded!
---
Is there a raw resources calculator for engineering? Either in an addon or online?
---
&gt;reserving 1 item = "being a dick, power trip"
---
Yikes.
---
That totally makes sense!!
---
Even setting ground clutter to 7 doesn‚Äôt help much. Need to go to 5 or less.
---
I would bind a key to look at the target of what you're focusing. On my game it's bound to "F" if I remember correctly, that might even be the default.
---
You only want to attack the mobs (enemies) that the tank is attacking, so you can use the F key to see which one they're attacking at any given time.
---
As a rogue, you should always attack from behind enemies, so they can't parry your attacks. That being said, be aware of your position. If moving behind enemies would pull a nearby monster, don't do it.
---
If we're out of combat, they can eat like anybody else. If the tank pulls quickly and they're in danger of dying, then I do my job.
---
Looks like question and azeroth auto pilot
---
I disagree, i believe lots of players returning are not just vanilla players back in the day. There are lots of tbc/wrath players returning as well.
---
 With that being said you can still have classic wow with some tbc/wrath qol features added in.
---
So ppl like you are creating a toxic enviroment and you dont speak for everyone. Have an open mind you butthole
---
Run to a base or the water. Or hearth
---
If anyone wants to sell theirs hit me up with an offer. I want one so bad.
---
I don't think they forgot they were on a PvP server I think they are asking for help.
---
Idc about that because most rogues don't lie about it.  It's a non-issue because most players don't care enough to steal a fucking chest.
---
*sits upright in computer chair*
---
not true. have personally watched my buddy sheep someone for like 10 minutes straight.
---
ok I need the copypasta for tanks now
---
What about if Atiesh granted a repeatable raid-quest or quest chain that gives attunement to all participants.
---
That way you don't necessarily need to get lucky to go into naxx you only need to find someone who did.
---
It would make anyone getting Atiesh a huge thing for your entire server and would make people who have it famous (or if they choose to abuse/neglect that power/responsibility, infamous) on the server since if someone wants to get attuned, well, you're the man they need.

https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=92/rock-elemental and https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=2735/lesser-rock-elemental are the best ones to farm - they have a higher chance of dropping elemental earth, which is the big-ticket item.
---
You know there's no consequence either way, right?  Is the big consequence you're referring to here a 20 second corpse run?    
---
Never understood that mentality.  Other than the VERY top tier of rushers who pick Alliance because it's slightly better for raiding, there is NO bias towards PVP/PVE, ganking/not ganking, etc between Horde and Alliance.  Everybody is just a guy/girl playing a video game at home and ending up doing what they like doing best.  Stop with the stupid "factionism".  It's the same thing.
---
Lots of people are afraid to group with total randoms

But... you're a wow player...

some people enjoy playing this way

Up all night ganking lowbies and need a cup of coffee... brew it

Was Fortnite for me.  This game finally let me quit that shit show for good.
---
Skinning gives you a good bit of money just from vendoring everything while leveling. It‚Äôs especially useful for your first character on a server. It helped to easily pay for my first mount at 40 as a warrior.
---
Me too wanna kno
---
I usually throw on Marks against lower levels and just run away.
---
Well I rolled warlock, and there are good specs that aren't so braindead as "dot and outlast" like sm/ruin or conflag/nightfall.  Warlock needs a *lot* of keybinds though, it's a pretty high APM class which takes some mastery.
---
Hunter's that aren't jumping you at max range tend to be pretty easy, because you can seduce, run up, and then howl of terror the hunter+pet and then it's basically GG.  Dot them up and run with them in their deadzone.
---
&gt; You are not fun    
---
    
---
That's impossible. My gf always laughed when I pulled down my pants.
---
No please don't do it. We need good warriors like you
---
Any purposefully added weapon buff will overwrite the totem weapon buff. Otherwise windfury weapon would be overwritten by the inherently worse windfury totem buff.
---
True
---
Thank you!
---
Not difficult, but when I healed I used to find the constant clicking to be annoying. If you're serious about it, research some "mouseover" macros that allow you to simply put your mouse over a name to send them a heal.
---
Certainly. They're simply guillty for being the opposite faction. Or guilty for being a pacifist in a time of war! If they haven't assisted in a gank then they've stood by and watched as their kin were felled.
---
LOL! I'm looking to just distract him for a few days, not get him married off -- I want my gaming buddy back next week :-)
---
Nah, I'm horde lmao
---
That patch also brought the new mount system we don't have in classic. Their reference client is 1.12.0 and they try to recreate that.
---
Metzen on what AQ needs to look like: Make it appear like egyptian mixed with ancient mesopotomian with bugs in it and shit.
---
Metzen on what Uldum needs to look like: Fuck it make it look 100% egyptian now.
---
If you have the talents, Ghost Wolf actually saves time unless you are riding for over 17 seconds.  Over 17 seconds, the mount is faster.
---
The forest ain't fucking around anymore
---
You guys got the Bee mount in BFA so I am not sure you are ever allowed to be that bottom hurt.
---
No you can use mouse over macros.
---
I was wondering so I sent a text to my little brother who's in his 20's. All he said was, "just don't".

I assume I would regret knowing more about it.

Knocked them all out last night as alliance....the horde were angry that night my friends they were out for blood. Formed a group of brave shell shocked alliance still in the area and managed to fight most of them off. Had a 34 mage run to us while being chased by some mounted 40+. Killed and camped them for like 2 respawns before moving on we‚Äôre civilized not savages. All in all a great night of questing, wpvp and made some friends. Got to take the small victories on a horde dominated server.

Up vote for the doggos!

looks nice but could be even better:

* the item count should update while a window is open and you remove an item from your bags
---
* the price input should be split into 3 input fields for gold, silver and copper
---
* needs more ways to open the windows:

   * use cmd to open/close the windows for using them as a macro button

   * minimap button
---
   * broker button

Combat daggers can be brutal in PvP.  You need to pick up points in the other trees but having those delicious backs open to you is really, really nice.
---
&gt;That's what PvE servers are for. 
---
I mean I bought potions for a raid and the buffs made it so I couldn't even use Enrage because it wouldn't get applied over my other buffs but still went on CD. That's a bit more than "a pixel perfect jump in Mario". 
---
This post was merely to document the testing data and raise awareness to the issue. Also, YOU might not be concerned, but that doesn't mean it isn't having an effect on other players.
---
Plot twist - inefficient doesn't mean bad though, point of the game is to have fun.  So your point goes both ways.
---
MC , BWL and AQ40 were not really hard so let's have fun.
---
Hell I never did Naxx in vanilla, but it wouldn't surprise me if it wasn't as hard as people say either.  (I know there's a DPS/gear check though)
---
This thread is starting to really get on my nerves...
---
Mages who don‚Äôt know how to not take aggro are not my problem as a healer. Just sayin.
---
"every area is just as heavily farmed" that't just incorrect. People are using layer hops to quickly farm gold/xp, that's an advantage.
---
Where are you getting a couple sittings? You need like 1.5-2k furbolg kills IIRC, and all spawns are heavily contested. It's not nearly as bad as frostsabers, but still far from easy.
---
Leveling in Hillsbrad is probably the most fun part of the 1-60 grind.
---
I don't know how you are going to be able to complete any quests if you couldn't figure out the answer to that one on your own.
---
Yeah, but isn't that the idea about "Classic+", that Classic will, probably, evolve in some way. Either through expansions (again) or through other changes to the game, while (hopefully) keeping to the spirit of classic, with talent trees, much farm, etc.

Had that priest not been terrible and buffed before trying to gank, he should have won.

Nice meme
---
You say that like it diminishes his accomplishment
---
Wrong. Tank dies, raid wipes. Kicked for not healing me, find a better one. Next

Silly Alliance. Thank you for furthering our cause for us by making yourselves look so bad.

Is this a bug or what it keeps happening to me and is annoying af
---
&gt;these mobs are either mine or theirs

With the amount of people leveling atm, those mobs are probably someone else's while you waste your time fighting each other lol.

I said its bad man? I literally just said its fun for me to be efficient.
---
Just use clique and save your self the headache.
---
Whats so hard about using print screen?
---
Is this before or after Blizzard nerfs the Battleshout/Demoshout spaming tanks would do, as those abilities were generating way to high a threat gen as blizz put it.

You buggin I‚Äôm gonna run that ww axe till i get a lv50+ upgrade lol

I wouldn't worry about skilling it up at the expense of leveling though.

It's the thought that counts, I'm always grateful for a buff whether it's useful or not. Because it means some human was trying to be kind.
---
I'm not complaining about elitism, I'm saying it's misplaced. Read: *"All guilds have a right to be cliquey and elitist. I think to some effect the elitism functions as a barrier to entry. If you aren't "elite" like us, don't apply, because you won't fit in. n Retail, this elitism functions fine, because these elite Retail guilds have something that prospective raiders want: a team that has the ability to kill the hardest bosses the game has to offer. In Classic, it's much different."*
---
&gt;Top guilds should take all ret pallies and boomkins and give them gear before the guild knows if they are good or not!
---
This is a strawman to make it seem like I'm demanding top guilds cater to my needs. That's not what I'm saying at all. You're misrepresenting my argument and you know that.
---
&gt; Why would a top guild put in little to no effort?
---
Again, another strawman, making it seem like I'm saying classic guilds *shouldn't* put in effort.
---
Why did you even reply? Lol. I agree with what you're saying - but that's because you're not disagreeing with me, you're disagreeing with what you *wish* I had said.
---
The overwhelming majority of people haven't made it close to 60 yet. That's a downside of out-leveling everyone else.

Can you turn off right clicking changing your target? I always end up accidentally having an ally as my target while tabbing through the enemies because I'll change my camera angle and if you click on something while panning the camera it changes your target.

I tell the tank I am ready for the next pull when I drop 3 totems and start drinking. @10% Mana once I finish my drink tank is usually at 50% health.

... It's possible to get it this fast legitimately?
---
Rogues would be a really good option as well. Problem is, getting into raids will be difficult unless you have connections.
---
I'm honestly wondering when Blizzard plans to fix anything. You have a few very well documented bugs without so much as a Blue post. Are they just going to wait until Phase 2 for bug fixes?
---

---
That is like king of my backyard.
---
There are profitable patterns out there, you just have to look.  Dreamweave, shadoweave both make me some decent money, I power leveled from 200 to 266 ish with those, and I more than made my money back.
---
My Pally is herb/alch.
---
From the days of twinks in low lvl bgs I have a PTSD reaction to having Hunters Mark placed on me. Death is inevitable. Still loved those battlegrounds.
---
The opportunity cost will be huge. Better to invest in trade goods that will be needed for P2
---
This was constructive. Thank you for participating!
---
People have explained it already, but I wonder how popular twinking will become in the potentially unlimited world of Classic.
---
Twinking lost popularity in retail for multiple reasons, one of which was that XP gain was added to battlegrounds, so eventually you would level out of your bracket. You could lock XP, but then Blizz made it so you went in a different queue than unlocked XP players. Surprise surprise, most twink players weren't interested in continuing once placed on a more even playing field, i.e. having to play exclusively against other twinks.
---
And no footrests.
---
Except when you keep it feared. #justwarlockthings
---
Yeah. Probably.
---
The average level is like 35. Your just ahead of everyone
---
I wouldn't call it op, but useful. 
---
Dwarf anti fear = op
---
Other types of changes they do, they do to appeal to other types of players, like the flying example. Players said that flying ruined the game and made it feel small, so they added achievements to allow flying later in expansions. However, this annoyed players who _liked_ flying. So ultimately you can't please everyone.
---
Not going to argue, because I can see value in both ... but I think you are significantly underestimating how strong a fear-&gt;DP combo is in PvP, considering you will never have to worry about WotF. You could be stunlocked to 5% HP, get one moment free for a fear, shield, DP, and DPS while you have a shield for 1k and heal for up to 1500-2000 *before* any spellpower is factored in.
---
Yes, the 3 min cooldown is rough, but a life-saver every 3 minutes is a big deal. It's basically an extra free healing pot that does a lot of damage. The 24 sec duration also fucks over rogues big time, and it being a disease helps you deal with Warlocks.
---
Not opening with ambush crit.
---
For shame.
---
Nobody thinks *being* ganked is fun.
---
I mean, theres a difference between bitching about getting killed once and complaining, its an entirely different story if you're just questing and getting body camped for 30 mins with a far spawn. Its not going to solve anything but is it worth bitching about? Id say so
---
I‚Äôm leveling fire and then plan to respec into frost.  Given that I already plan to respec, I‚Äôm honestly just using whatever talents and spells sound fun to me.
---
That being said, on fire I use fireball + fire blast regularly, nova when I need space, counterspell against casters (mostly for practice) and sheep when I panic.  Arcane explosion is also good for finishing enemies off if you get overwhelmed or are fighting trash.  All of my talents are in fire other than a couple points in frost to reduce resist chance.
---
The one thing I would say on fire is to not underestimate critical hits, which I did at first.  Any talent that increases crit chance or crit damage on your core spells will be good, and I‚Äôm focused on building to the bottom talent that basically guarantees crits in mid length fights.
---
If you land crits on back to back fireball + fire blast you can often pretty much 2 shot an enemy that is at your level or just below.
---
Just some thoughts from a new player that is grinding in the mid 30s.  The main point is that I‚Äôm straight up planning to respec in the 50s which gives you some freedom.
---
Don‚Äôt try too hard, you‚Äôll just replace eventually
---
Next problem...
---
I can turn the quest tracker display off (thank you :) ), but it comes back on whenever I have a loading screen...?
---
Any ideas?
---
A couple days ago I checked my servers census data, and as a level 35 I was on the front side of the power curve, ahead of the masses that are mid to late 20's.  I can maintain my pace leveling (maybe improve on it even since I soon won't be obsessed over making gold for my mount), then I should be 60 by November.  That'll be a huge win.  If you're 42 with a mount, you are ahead man.
---
Exploiting layer hops is a method that gives an advantage to players by exploiting an unintended side effect of a game mechanic. There are lots of side effects of layering, the intention is to allow servers to support an oversaturated playerbase. If you can show me anywhere that indicates the purpose being to allow players to farm mobs for fast xp, please provide that. Blizzard has called open world layer exploiting an "issue", which indicates it's not an intentional design choice. 
---
Losing an escort mission due to layer hopping is not against the TOS because it does not provide any advantage, but it's clearly unintended and a glitch.
---
how do u set up a macro like that?
---
Dungeons was a very good income for me atleast
---
I was in Hinterlands leveling last night and some Horde 6 levels higher than me was camping my corpse. Managed to finally get away far enough to mana up and then I proceeded to keep him Polyd for like 30 years while spamming the laugh emote out of spite. Felt good lol
---
Yeaaaaahh, you're right. But i mean, generally. I assume they're a vocal minority, but i'm not a furry so idk
---
&gt;You can come back in 5 years and the game will be the same.
---
Ehh we really don't know that one for sure
---
Well it wasn't supposed to be the same. It's basically a sequel dungeon, and it was still just as fun.
---
really doubt any meta video told them to play a druid lol
---
Are you Horde or alliance?
---
lockpicking is analogous to professions. not to mage water, not to anything else. it's an extra profession as a class perk. do you also demand the ore from mining nodes in dungeons?
---
I agree that‚Äôs probably the best option. Overall if you had to choose, would you go with 4/5 dagger spec, or 1/5 dag spec and 3/3 aggression?
---
IMHO at most if classic is really popular they could add and retune some already released content that fits thematically with minor changes. (Such as Caverns of time dungeons, Karazhan, Hyjal). Quick cash in :-)
---
Thanks. This really motivates me to keep going and not doubt my decision to journey to stormwind. So i will do just that. Westfall and Loch Modan questing
---
On the same hand, me getting the play by play of you getting ganked by the other faction when you attacked them first is just as un-needed.
---
People tell you not to level prot because you'll kill things slow.
---
You can tank just fine up to 50s as arms or fury.
---
If I was to level prot, I would spec into arms first for anger management, but I don't suggest leveling prot.
---
I think you can, but have not tried that since like wrath.
---
I thought that too, but in fact it's almost 50:50! 
---

---
I agreed with OP that he was treated poorly, but I disagree with your argument about "playing his way".
---
When you play with a group, there needs to be some consensus on how the *group* wants to play. 
---
If the group wants to RP through ZF and pretend they are infiltrating the troll stronghold, awesome - if that's what everyone wants. 
---
If the group wants to min/max their way through with minimal trash pulls so they can run it 3 times back to back, awesome - if that's what everyone wants to play.
---
It's important to be respectful of the rest of a group. I may "want to play" in a way where I take frequent 10 minute breaks and the group waits for me. But what about how the other 4 want to play? Do they want to sit around and wait for me?
---
This is a debate as old as Classic Wow. But it's a two way street. OP wants his group to accommodate his play style, but gives no consideration for the group's play preferences.
---
Shhhh. I am trying to placate the Alliance from making more meta whine memes.
---
Don't be afraid to tell your group that's it's your first time in the dungeon.  If your party is cool,  they'll help explain as you go.
---
Its kind of annoying when you google for a map and these are the ones that always come up.
---
For a long time i was thinking i was fucked and there wasnt an Alliance FP in the Gorge or Steppes.  Was so happy when i found out there was one in each zone.
---
You know full well what is meant by the wording of the Terms of Service and your response is disingenuous. People know when they are cheating and rationalize it all over the place. Maybe you did as well and don‚Äôt want to admit it?
---
Charge, maybe Demo Shout, change stances, begin sundering. TBH I like a macro that charges, then changes to defensive stance right away and lays on a sunder.
---
But yes, spec for Tactical Mastery to keep up to 25 points of rage when switching stances, and for improved charge.
---
You ask that like your suggestions on how to revamp classic make this sub better.
---
They don't.
---
I drop a renew on the warlock if I have surplus mana.  If there's a big fight going on and he's lifetapping or we are about to pull and he's lifetapping, I'm not going to waste mana on him.  Most that I've grouped with are really excited when you say they can tap for more.
---
You want a summon. Get a warlock. Meeting stones are faster but it's a unique class ability. Leave it alone.
---
I main warlock and while its nice to be healed, it's not always necessary unless I somehow pull too much aggro. 
---
I have siphon life, drain life, and demon armor to heal me up, we're ranged so not a big deal to be at ~50% health for a couple of minutes to ensure we can still output consistent DPS.
---
Alliance.
---
you generally save evasion for once your stuns are already on DR and they're at like 30% and you just need to build one more evis to kill them
---
at that point one overpower isn't going to ruin your day, especially if it's all they can land before they die
---
How do I recharge my throwing knives?
---
if they do BC and WOTLK we can play for like 6+ years with blizzard never having to make a real #change, being unable to ruin the games we love, and the servers will never die. Sounds pretty fucking good to me. See you in 6 years and maybe your point will be valid
---
Ever heard of Spirit airlines ?
---
Ah, okay. Something like a "button" for Foobar
---
I mean he is right though
---
Yeah I've been farming SM.. That's been my main source of gold at the moment.

---
So the general rule is try to heal through it. If it becomes too much of an issue and you don't have a mage, tell them they need to pony up silver or water if they want heals between pulls like that. If they don't offer anything- don't heal em. Pretty simple. Remember as a healer/ tank- you are a leader. You say how shit goes, not the dps.
---
I mean, I'm sure it happened somewhere, but since I never saw it, and never heard of it happening, it certainly wasn't 'common'.

No personal insults were made.

Hahaha I‚Äôm horde, this is funny. It‚Äôs so true on Facebook at the very least

Not a douchbag, but the opposite. Was grinding out quests in STV, and a mage kept sheeping me when I got low on health for the free heal, then he'd wand me when I was full HP to get me back in the action =).

We've sadly gotten hooked on the SPIN and we can't give it up. The SPIN is love. The SPIN is life.

Ha same here.  Just gave up last night, can't take the queues anymore.  Managed to talk about classic enough at work to get two people there sucked back into it so I just rerolled with them.
---
Nope. As soon as I heard that song, I'm out.
---
I agree with you, I meant it in the sense that 75-90% of groups are only being made with the fastest leveling meta in mind. It really has affected other people being able to get groups whether people believe it or not.

Those are rookie numbers son. :)

Can‚Äôt do shit if the hunter sits in a flare
---
We slaughter them instead of letting them join a faction? Sounds about right
---
Basilisks in southern Thousand Needles. If you have skinning, you can make ~8g/hr by vendoring the leather and greys, all while getting decent exp.
---
As far as most of the content goes, we truly don't know whether the "plans" were just rough sketches, or nearly fleshed out dungeons. Karazhan was an exception. This was specifically designed as a level 60 area, and entirely finished, before it was tweaked to fit inside the TBC package.
---
I don't expect devs to follow old notes and designs to the letter, but I would hope they would use them to guide their instance/zone design, as they would clearly be a solid framework for preserving the vanilla "feel".
---
LMAO
---
Chances are a guide is going to net you less as it‚Äôll be more than just you.  I was grinding murlocs outside Menethil when iridescent pearls were a gold each.  They drop a ton of grey stuff too.
---
&gt;Properly geared and prepared
---
The priest was the one ganking, the lock should have been less prepared but the priest put no effort in. I agree, warlocks are very strong in 1v1 PvP, but so are spriests; and priests hard counter a lot of warlock's base damage a lot harder than other classes do.
---
IMO that's a pretty fair matchup, I've won more than I've lost vs. warlocks in 1v1 PvP as a spriest. Especially once you get rank 2 dispel magic and can just get rid of corruption/immolate immediately, and shadow protection/silence to keep them from shadowbolt spamming; it really limits their ability to cut through shields fast enough.
---
Economies are weird right now. So much undercutting. Bags are horrendous with pricing/mat ratio.

I've tanked up to Uldaman with no problems so far (and I started tanking Uldaman at a low level, like 41). I'm 31/20/0... well, 31/5/0
---
Try to look at your server statistics and see which will be most likely to get you into a guild.
---
There‚Äôs nothing hardcore about this. It occurred on all servers for a long time.
---
Yeah but when you play certain classes, it is really difficult if you can't upgrade your weapon without a fair /roll on items you might need.
---
Lol, dude.. you're talking about offhealing and tremoring and purging and doing all this totally unnecessary shit, and then complaining about being removed for not doing damage. No shit, you were too busy trying to be a hybrid, when you were invited to the group as a dps. 
---
Youre doing fucking scarlet monastery, all you need to do is put WF on the ground, put a fire totem on the ground, and auto attack. Saying your dps is low because you don't have ravager or whatever is bs.
---
If i invited an enhance sham and he spent all his time trying to cast chain heal for some stupid reason, i'd kick him too lmao.
---
Only in Horde. Alliance always fill the healer spots
---
Doesn't make sense to me that someone has a "copyright" on a meme. I didn't made this meme, just found out on discord
---
I don't need priests or warlocks to feel fear!
---
I'll check out the war campaign. I really want to know how this clusterfuck ends.
---
Any other hunters not figure out how pet abilities work till level 38 like me?
---
Your best bet as alliance is farming beasts like basilisks, raptors, gorillas, or elementals in arathi. If Horde shellfish are a gold mine but that's Horde only.
---
Playing a priest. Out in the open world, when I see someone dead, sometimes I can select the corpse and res, sometimes I can't. What's the deal there?

Not sure why he even put the second item on his list when he can't complete it.

"You don't like it? Take the challenge and play a prot warrior yourself or don't go. simple as that."
---
That's arrogant as hell. I was pointing that out. Period. No need to get defensive with the cop-out excuse of it just being bait.
---
I can only imagine this is a guild on Deviate Delight
---
That last tie-in to stvietnam
---
I‚Äôm on kirtinos.. hang in the brother!! 48
---
what revamp? what suggestion? what are you talking about?
---
Ha hahaha
---
I'm letting the Alliance scumbags reveal themselves, then I will permaban them all. This is a honeypot I posted on an alt account to trap those Alliance *nerds* and it seems my plan has worked.
---
It‚Äôs about preparation in both situations.  I believe prep is part of the equation in both situations.  You look only at the moment of the fight. 
---
That‚Äôs fine, just explaining my point of view and how it is consistent across all types of PvP
---
If his price us the equilibrium price he can make profit buying low
---
This gave me such a pleasant mental image, I'm going to stop browsing /r/classicwow for now and attempt to get something done at work while my mind continues to dwell.
---
Super low dungeons it doesn't really matter. Tanks have awful threat generation then. Mobs do minimal damage.
---
At 60 I can easily tank with DPS charging in the same time I do. Outside of MC core hounds and such where their direction is super important.
---
Fun fact, most PvP servers are 30% Alliance vs 70% Horde. How well do you suppose a level 32 Alliance  handles a group of 5 Horde level 24-27?
---
These posts make me feel good
---
I'm 43 and still lack 30 gold for my mount lol.
---
What class would that be? Honest question. I‚Äôm not too familiar with what skills are needed to level for certain classes but I feel like only hunters have a gold sink win their ammo and pet food so I don‚Äôt see how people could not level their skills and not have the gold at 40 unless they‚Äôre buying stuff off the ah.
---
Disposable potions are the best! No Skyrim, ‚Äúbetter save this for later‚Äù conundrum here,
---
I gotta use it this session!
---
Its extremely rare to find a group that isn't running the AOE cleave meta. To the point that, at least on my server, groups are advertising that they are LFM (NORMAL GROUP).....
---
Please show me what your DPS is,. cuz 80-100 is totally respectable while offhealing because our healer sucked. Once again, you're talking out your ass and being a dickbag.
---
This isn't Poe's law, it's obvious satire. The UwU typing has been a meme for a long time.
---
Why though? You can only cast so many spells and a lot of them aren‚Äôt needed or are inefficient. Why would I level a skill that I never use leveling? I would be literally sinking gold into something that won‚Äôt pay off until the end game and at that point I‚Äôll have a couple hundred gold to buy my skills. Doesn‚Äôt make any sense to postpone buying your mount to make leveling earlier in order to have ranks in skills you don‚Äôt use.
---
Mind control is against the 4th law of magic and thus you shall be tried for witchcraft
---
In BFA you have an Artifact item in your necklace slot. You don't replace it, you upgrade it by leveling it, and in 8.2 they released "Azerite Essences" which are basically new talents that you select in your necklace. A lot of them take very long grinds to unlock the highest level. 
---
If you have more than one max level character you have to grind the Essences separately for each character which is just an insane amount of time doing repetitive content. Effectively making it impossible to play more than one level 120 character well unless you are unemployed and can play 5+ hours a day
---
Blink was on cooldown but cold snap and ice block weren't. I'd love to see you take this mage on as a rogue. It's doable but it's not easy, especially without imp sprint and crippling not applying the majority of the encounter.
---
Undercity should absolutely fucking NOT be capital of the Horde. Org is your best bet. Even so, UC used to be an Alliance city anyway. Why make the main Horde city the only previously-used Ally city?

Gathering professions are pure profit, farming cloth or leather and selling it on the AH in full stacks or using it to craft gear and vendoring the gear.  Your options in classic especially at your level are going to be limited, there were not many alternative income resources  in that version of the game.  If you do opt to farm and sell on the AH, download a basic addon like Auctionator to make the process quicker and to insure you're not selling too low.
---
So what was the point of your comment? Do you not like that others are playing how they wish? Everyone playing this game in ANY capacity is doing so with their free time. What makes this occasion all of a sudden a waste of time other than the fact that you feel they are burning away precious moments they could be doing things you value more.
---
IMO no new content. Go play retail if you want you new content
---
Right, because @35 in Going to death march past 50+ mobs. Stop it
---
Ah,u hunting grounds. Glorious gnome killing for hours.
---
Dude, I feel your pain. Every play session I always go straight to the AH buy 3 stacks of Health pots and 1 to 2 stacks of Troll's Blood. It be hard out there for a Warr to level w/out having massive down time.
---
Your comment is spot on. I will never complain about corpse camping. But I cannot imagine ever doing it to a lowbie player. Or even to anyone outside of some kind of large scale faction fight. 
---
I was a mage main in vanilla, so I get the AOE farming thing. But when a mage comes into an area I am clearing quest mobs, tags a bunch, attempts to AOE, and gets in trouble, I don‚Äôt help. I usually help players in trouble from mobs. But this one mage tried to pull all the mobs and AOE them. He then got in trouble and ice blocked. I waited for him to die, and then went ahead and kept clearing mobs. I got called out for this. I just responded with ‚Äúpull less mobs next time.‚Äù

I was mounted running past a human paladin in Hillsbrad trying to get to the tailoring trainer in Tarren Mill. I was 60 and he was whatever level ppl level in Hillsbrad at.
---
I didn't dismount and was already a bit past him when dude just hits me with a pally stun. I'm like... really dude lmao. Blinked out of stun and killed him in one global and was on my way.
---
What a hero that guy was though. No fear
---
Im gonna be honest. Classic is make me want to play retail. I dont want to play it now and i will not play BfA again because its just too bad and i will stick to classic because i enjoy it infinitelly more than retail. There are a few things i enjoy in retail that i get the itch to do again sometime. Like i hate what they did to the classes, prunning and stuff. But i really enjoy rotations of some classes. I loved playing my unholy dk because i loved the rotation. Still one month after the first raid came out i quit because i wasnt enjoying anything elsw in the game. Raiding is fun but the items are so full that i cant motivate myself to do it a lot. There id also an adpect i love about druids which im also playing in classic. Well there is multiple QoL changes that i love in retail druids like how the shapeshifting works and how i need to use macrod in classic to even be able to do something similar, like using potions or switching from bear to cat. I can do those things in classic as well but it requires a macro. Therefore my stancebar in classic is completely useless and i just hide it but i digress. What i love about druids in retail is playing feral, and im not saying it should be better in classic. What i like about it is the mobility. Its one of the strengths of the spec and its a strenght i particularly enjoy having. Sadly thatd not how it works in classic. Cat is just as slow as caster except if you skill it but even then its only outdoors so even if i was to raid as a feral druid i wouldnt have that and would be just as slow as everyone else.

---
Hello &lt;target&gt;!
---
how do you use it? im confused on how to plan out my upgrades
---
&gt; I hear you guys furiously typing. "majority of the playerbase is only 20-something"   
---
&gt; it suuuuuuure feels like I'm not at least at the top 10-15%. 
---
Well are you trying to be above the majority, or in the top 10-15%?
---
compete with what? What are you talking about? Think about this.
---
20% of groups run instances "normally". 80% of groups try to cleave them with some 4 warrior 1 shaman or 4 mage 1 priest comp. 80% of the player base has 20% of the groups to choose from. It wasn't like this in 2004 because people didn't have 14 years to figure out the meta. It existed, but it wasn't as rampant as it is right now.
---
can't even afford my regular mount yet
---
All the fortnite streamers went horde. Thus the joke.
---
I've done this exact thing, I have 55g at 38.5.  My cooking and fishing are at 225.  Skinning and herbing are at 275ish.  I didnt buy any unneeded skills from the trainer, spent probably 5g on AH for bags.  I must be incredibly unlucky with vendor item drops.  I have basically been grinding high gold per hour beasts exclusively since 35.  
---
What I'm trying to say is that the fishing/cooking/skinning thing doesnt guarantee you 90g by level 40.
---
Gotcha thanks !
---
Automod eventually got it for being reported a lot. I've manually removed it now. Mods weren't around, and personally I was asleep.
---
Once you are 38 or so they aren't bad to fight but I would recommend raptors or gorillas with skinning for efficient farming. Elementals tend to be tougher than beasts.
---
There are literally dozens of us!
---
Thank you for the context.
---
Will be the same. It are two different characters. Stats and progress doesn‚Äôt get carried over
---
Shiro, is that you?
---
You can do BRD, but avoid "EMP" runs.  Those runs will immediately close and cross the gate over to the second half of the dungeon. You'll have a hard time with those mobs.  Personally I'd grab a buddy and do Un'goro, felwood, or WPL.
---
Thanks! One of my toons is named after dog on right.
---
I wanted to keep a Vanilla feel so I kept the default frames and the gryphon arts
---
There were screenshots submitted to the guild leaders and the individual who committed the crime.
---
It's an old rpg term from games where youd hand pick your stats. Now a days it's used to describe anyone who prioritizes numbers or efficiency.
---
I had a warlock who would lifetap down to 2/3% and then occasionally would pull aggro. I had no sympathy for him dying, but he also never complained about dying either, so it was all good. The rogue of the group joked it was a lifestyle choice.
---
Lots of leveling happening, so folks are undercutting to the point where profit margins are minimally above vendor prices. 
---
For instance, small silk packs on the AH are 25s, vendor for 20s, but a stack of silk goes for 60-80s. To buy the 12s needed, you‚Äôre going to spend at least 25-30s, not including the basic mats like leather or thread.
---
Getting camped at my aoe spot this morning so I did some thousand needles quests and then worked on my fishing level. Thank you gankers for breaking up my morning and keeping it fresh.
---
Ahead and to the left
---
Basically the Horde is Jalen Ramsey and the Alliance is Stephon Gilmore.
---
Lol what is that guy even on garrisons were definitely not even a form of player owned housing. It was basically a mobile game command centre lmao
---
Blizzard had 15 years to improve upon their server structure and it's still this bad now.    
---
I hope he continues to do this so it forces the entire team to improve upon their server tech.

6 agi is 6 AP, about 1/4 crit at 60 (the amount scales with level, so its more at lower levels), 6 armor(a tiny amount) and some amount of dodge (i dont remember the numbers for this).
---
Go with the agi for crit, the dodge is also really nice while soloing.
---
Don't know why people are saying it was great graphics. WoW was not considered a graphically impressive game even at launch. Great art style, sure, but even in 2004 other MMOs had better graphics, to say nothing of other games in general.
---
Also worth pointing out that if you want to see the game as it actually looked in 2004, you need to set your graphics to "classic" (level 3 out of 10) and play on a 1280x1024 monitor max.
---
this is new, I never experienced server lag in vanilla and definitely nobody grouped up in groups larger than 40.  I think it was all those big justin tv streamers back in the day causing the server to lag though.
---
Must be fucking nice
---
This is the EXACT thought process that got us to what retail is today
---
how about just stop fucking with it? I don't want this game to become a bloated mess. Just keep it vanilla
---
I think it would be hard to replicate vanilla zone design if you used rested, well prepared Devs with a working support pipeline tbh
---
cool, now that we have apparently "figured it out" , you should do it with us.
---
Your worst efficiency heals multiply your mana into Warlock mana at 3x or so, so it‚Äôs usually a pretty good deal.  I‚Äôd bet even with you healing the lock he‚Äôs spending more on bandages and water than you are, since you only have to heal occasionally, benefiting from regen outside the 5 second rule, while he should be spending mana nonstop on every pull.

---
I dunno, I'm a new player too and some things are common sense and someone should let you know it's not cool if you do it. Like, ninja grabbing skin or chest. You wouldn't grab something out of someones hands at a grocery store, why do it in a game?
---
Whats the difference between a BoE and a BoP when it's an upgrade?  This is a tired argument and I stand by my belief that if you need on BoEs for gold, you should need on all BoPs because clearly, gold is more important to you.  Allowing a party member to get that sweet blue BoE upgrade is anathema to getting your mount at 40, so why are BoPs any different?
---
Ultimate wow-factor for an Alliance Hunter would be Humar the Pridelord. He has a long respawn and is in a Horde zone.
---
It‚Äôs meant to insult the horde players who are like hurr durrr this is a PvP server stop complaining about ganking just git gud, when they are on a 2:1 or 3:1 horde server
---
Thanks for the insight. I am aware of the limitations of the methodology. I will address these when presenting the results.
---
Lmao. Stalagg is 65% Horde. I understand getting ganked is frustrating, but you guys got it easy.
---
It's simply called regen, look for data brokers on the usual websites (curse, wow interface...)
---
Write to your mum
---
The spawn timer of Brokentooth is 7-8 hours. If I miss him or see him killed I should be able to log out then log back in 7-8 hours later and be able to tame him. The way layering works it seems this is not possible.
---
The game is still using 15 year old code on top of that engine though...
---
Pm me and tell your server
---
Even just collecting and vendoring every few hours when you empty bags wouldn't that make it worth it ?
---
A guild is an organization.....
---
There is no problem. The person is just an idiot.
---
&gt; Usually in a wipe situation if you SS you just get swarmed by the mobs that killed you before.
---
If you have SS and are going to be the last alive you should run to a safe spot.  The are you just came from should be clear enough to res from, and if a priest then you can even reduce enemies aggro range so you can get closer to bodies to res.
---
Look for BattleFor AzerothUI\_Classic on github
---
Wish there were more quests for such a large zone. You can bust out all these in like 30 mins.
---
&gt;Bee Mount in BFA
---
How much irl money is it?
---
But seriously Alliance does get the winter saber in classic and horde doesn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm kinda bummed about that.
---
I wish I could've added that :/
---
Yep. I'm on a medium pop PVE server and even the 50-60 zones are absolutely filled with mages except between 2-7am.
---
I love how you can see the slow but steady change in the meme-ing of the warrior community here.
---
It was all about dying to 2-mob-pulls last week. As the peak of the normal distribution hits the 30s, it‚Äôs WW axe, impale and overpower memes
---
aaah, you drink right before the tick up, then keep running, never thought about that!
---
I'm the frontrunner leveling in my guild, no one is really that close to me in levels. I've been having a blast, although I cant wait to do more holy at 60 than ret. Holy shit is leveling a paladin solo slow as balls! SoC is so damn random sometimes, it makes me wonder what the hell the devs were thinking when they made it. I've made some friends (and 1 enemy) as I went through dungeons, and it's nice seeing familiar faces and guilds as I go through ironforge. 
---
Cant wait to run some max level instances and get some phat lewtz, recruit some people for MC, and help the rest of my friends get to 60.
---
You are correct that if I sent the mage a whisper saying "hey i'm about to dispel my debuffs, you better stack more than just frost nova on me" he would likely attempt to counter. However, a mage is dependent on his roots and slows to have time to cast, he also would not likely have a buff tracking addon that announces the 5 second intervals of my dispels as you presume. Mages are dependent on speed control to kite their targets or they don't get cast time. You're free to run away from a warrior at the same speed he's chasing you, but you'd better hope combat doesn't drop. Any warrior worth his salt won't intercept you until you blink :).
---
They can‚Äôt actually be breaking off parts of it so that it can‚Äôt be used as a server ever again...
---
What a loser lmao
---
You must be so devastated.
---
Since Blizzard themselves made a guide on how to use layering it seems quite a stretch that your imagination is the guideline.
---
&gt;committed the crime
---
This made me laugh
---
Who cares? I wasn't talking to you.
---
This game isn't a DPS race. Retail turned into that because of enrage timers. You HAD to do a certain amount of damage in a certain amount of time or the boss would get super strong and murder you. Most bosses in classic don't have enrage timers. If you can survive it, you can fight them for hours. Back in the day, people 10 man'd Onyxia and it took them like 30 minutes to do it. Back in TBC a hunter solo'd a world boss with his pet and a buttload of +healing. I was in Dead Mines a few days ago and we were all well underlevel. We got to VanCleef and wiped at 40%. Tried again and wiped again. We started changing our strategy. We had 2 pallies and a priest, so we started rotating healers. We stopped DPS after killing the first set of adds so the priest could regen some mana. When we finally did that, we downed him fairly easily. You can actually use strategies that aren't just CC this guy and that guy and then burn skull into the ground before the healer is oom.  
---
Also, since you can't see someone else's talent trees, you don't have to worry about if your build is cookie cutter enough.
---
Thats nice, too bad they arent here....
---
Herod Alliance side I see it all the time in /world and /lookingforgroup. Mostly in the evening, which is when I play. Even when they don't advertise it, when you whisper they ask in whispers "hoj reserved ok?" or something similar. Happens about 3/4 of the time. 
---
And no, it's not ok. I'm not out here volunteering my time to gear up strangers, and I'm not out to make friends with loot whores.
---
Having that many buffs isn't required to beat the current content (doubt it would be required to be ANY of the classic content).
---
I think this should be put behind almost every other issue as it literally only affects world buff tryhards.
---
As a mage I do this with jumper cables. It never works but doesn‚Äôt stop me from trying.
---
Wow this is shameful imo
---
I disagwee, dis is EXACTwY how yuw advewtise yuw guiwd, yuw make a non-genewic message dat gives peopwe some fowm of expectation of what being in de guiwd is wike.

Can anyone recommend a good wireless backlit keyboard and mouse for Mac that is WoW friendly? 
---
I‚Äôm playing off my TV and I‚Äôm having some issues with my older PC accessories working well with the MacBook I‚Äôm playing the game on.
---
I [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8c0t4b/cutunfinished_content/) about all the cut/unfinished content when this sub was still only a few thousand strong (instead of a few hundred thousand!!!). 
---
Fortunately if they go the Classic+ route they have a HUGE pool of content to pull from. 
---
My personal wishlist
---
1. Hyjal (with raid under the world tree where a copy of Onyxia's raid entrance is). 
---
2. Grim Batol
---
3. Azshara Crater
---
4. Uldum
---
5. Karazhan Crypts
---
off the top of my head
---
- keep pet on passive and follow, manually make it attack targets thru a macro/micro
---
- don't multishot if there's a CC'd mob
---
- concuss shot on any fleeing mobs
---
- stay pet if dropping down from a ledge
---
- now is not the time to kite; if u gain aggro feign death or run toward the tank or your pet
---
- focus your dmg on the mob that everyone is hitting, i use my pet as cc to to keep secondary mobs occupied or if one peels off to attack your casters if it's not contributing to dmg
---
- turn off growl
---
This is the best answer for all raid specs and shit posts I have seen attacking paladins, druids ETC
---
tbh I get pretty annoyed at the AOE farmers and do everything I can to ensure they die when they are AOE farming quest mobs (things like breaking their sheeps). That shit is rude af, other folks out here trying to finish quests. No need to hog it all for yourself!
---
No one said anything about waiting till naxx. If you even bothered to read my first post I said we should wait till people actually experience endgame so they have an idea of what they want for the future of classic.
---
Well enhance can seriously fuck up a mage.
---
The only thing worse than that was a guild on my server claiming in their guild ad that they have over half a dozen Scarab Lords. yeahok_jenniferlawrence.gif
---
I don't remember what my DPS was at SM levels. I know currently, in a ST or Mara or something, i do ~300 single target. 
---
I'm not talking out of my ass, lmao.
---
Look at that, people all claim hunter is trash dps and yet they rank 3rd in MC/Ony on logs.
---
Reddit/forums need to stop talking out thier ass about things thry know nothing about.
---
Ty for linking the logs!
---
Lol. Touche.
---
SORRY FOR CONFUSING POST.
---
He was in our discord and posted this image. THIS is his POV of winning the item .
---
Yeah but this info has only been documented on Discords and only recently a video. I made this post purely to raise awareness and aggregate the information. Blizzard can choose what they want to fix first, but that doesn't mean we can't help by pooling our findings.
---
Who says undercity is the capital of the horde&gt;
---
Personally I don't see why not. That isn't really a change to the game mechanics.
---
Have you tried sliding the quality bar to max? Its pretty close to retail in terms of quality...
---
The answer is no. On a side note if u think the posts are salty now about STV PvP I can‚Äôt wait to see the posts in phase 2.
---
The Level 2 Paladin is the retro equivalent to the Level 58 Death Knight.
---
Hope someone understands that observation.
---
&gt; Mind numbing poison. Nevermind. He should have made his crippling poison proc better lol
---
BS. You should use double crippling exactly because of the procc rate.
---
The best way to win a world PvP battle is to find the nearest flight master and get out of there until there is honorable and dishonorable kills in the game.
---
I had a priest try this on me I just broke Los and then we played ring around the Rosey til he gave up
---
Ryyko is for sure a ninja, I back DartTheDragoon
---
Unless the main end game raid is one fp away from darn.
---
Yeah opposite of druids who get 1-2 piece of gear with no roll each MC. My MC run we had 12 mages and only priests and warlocks won on caster items that night lol.
---
Rust was big for me but the blatant scripting killed the drive for me. You‚Äôve got people like ern on rusty moose who allows it because it‚Äôs so prevalent. I ended up just joining them scripting
---
lmao whys the vid start with "How I avoided the gank"? What a stupid video to post lol what am I missing? All i see is a ?? walking past you and you going the opposite direction?
---
Nope, this is strictly against the ToS and will get you banned.
---
I only cared when he spit in the face of his YouTube followers and abandoned his channel. That‚Äôs how I first discovered him. The sad and creepy people that spam in his chat and spend days farming gold just to give it to him is what is weird and off putting. He has just become spoiled really. No different than a cam girl. There is no difference between him and a boob streamer.
---
That's probably good.
---
Huh?  TBC *solved* the power creep of Naxx gear with a stat reset.
---
The amount of classic players who don't realize how broken the game is with Naxx gear is surprising.
---
The only other video game that I play is Team Fortress 2.
---
As others said, yes you can do this. I did the opposite by running my undead over to Durotar at level 1 because my long term goal is to get exalted Orgrimmar and a wolf mount.
---
Nothing surprising here.  As a Horde your guilt over things like this will fade and become 2nd nature, and you‚Äôll evolve into a fully formed living trashcan.
---
Is the axe better than Bonebiter?
---
You will be asked to go restoration if you raid as a shaman at 60. Enhance is not good for raiding, and you will have to be pretty lucky to find a guild that will take you on raids. You can respec for pvp, and you do have about as good an argument for sulfuras as anyone else, as no one really does 2h in high end raiding.
---
I have to prevent the alliance scum from reaching level 60 as much as possible. Making them do a corpse run takes much longer than me dismounting to slay them.
---
I let most people live still though, except gnomes. If you rolled a gnome on fairbanks I don‚Äôt care what level you are, I‚Äôll waste my day killing you.
---
His comment breaks down to "one offers more damage but the other is faster." You can tell this just by looking at both items. Its not like you needed to do any kind of testing or deep analysis to come to this conclusion.
---
You risk a ban.
---
World PvP, and then BG PvP when it comes out. Vanilla also has a rather large number of level 60 5-man dungeons to run, and numerous ways to run them. Also even as a casual player you should be able to raid at least Onyxia, ZG, and AQ20.
---
Hell yeah brotherrrrr
---
I don't think there will be new servers, maybe if they can't get rid off layering on certains servers.
---
My favorite are the mages who go "Lol I got my epic mount so EZZZZ"
---
Must be nice to abuse layering AoE grind :^)
---
Yes....
---
First. Tube the graphics up to setting 10. You can run wow classic on a toaster oven Ben with setting 10. 
---
Second. Make sure you apply the nvidia gforce experience filter if you have nvidia card. The sharpness increases tenfold.
---
Maybe you didn't see the PvP and PvE plans
---
Shaman love*
---
I dont get this, surely they're just asking for some help in killing the rogue ?
---
As you should
---
I'm really confused on what professions to take as a Warrior. Mainly focused on Tanking/PVE but also DPS. 
---
PVP I may do later with a buddy but I'm not overly crazy about it and don't care about an edge in PVP. 
---
Right now I'm mining/bs but I'm starting to wonder if Mining/Eng is more useful, or even Herb/Alch. 
---
I'd like something to make gold with and also benefit me in PVE encounters.
---
Yeah I have screenshots of Ryyko ninjaing. I submitted them to the proper authorities.
---
#satire taken seriously
---
You mean the "train pet" ability that's absolutely vital to playing a Hunter but not available anywhere you'd expect it? I vaguely remembered that it existed and had to google where to find it.
---
I think they eventually made it a tab of the Talents panel, which makes way more sense.
---
As a warlock you have fast questing and aoe grinding, so dungeons are really only worth it if you have quests or if you really want an item.
---
This is what I hear too. Or maybe it is just a clever ploy, spreading fake news about the marvellous trash-dropping kitties so people will leave them alone??
---
/Conspiracy
---
Also, Thousand Needles and Arathi Highlands at around 34ish.  Between those two, STV, and Hillsbrad you should hit 35 without issue.  Then, switch it up with Desolace and moving into Swamp of Sorrows and Dustwallow marsh in the late 30s and early 40s.
---
Definitely go into SM a bunch to get 2-3 levels in your 30s.  It's worth it to avoid some of the frustration that is STV and Hillsbrad.
---
Yep.  I timed it so that only the people who were on the loading screen as I posted that message are the right level of hardcore.
---
I'm gonna guess that it's because generally as the victim to mages and being trapped frozen in place - it's really frustrating to watch. 
---
Mages slip away from everything it seems, regardless of how many mistakes this rogue made and how bad they handled the fight. So he probably hates this gameplay because it shows how easily mages can avoid damage with their mechanics.
---
*Got'em!*
---
They will never do Classic+.  But it would be the best thing ever.
---
In pvp, yes. 
---
In pve, eh. They aren't that great but since it's a simpler time I'm sure youd find a spot. 
---
The MAIN issue with shaman is when your guild makes you switch from enhance to resto, you lose your 2h skill and have to reskill it up when you switch back to enhance. 
---
It's not the worst but it's annoying as fuck

what is this discord?

Roleplay server I take it?

no one uses deadly in classic

What is considered "best practice" or "ethical looting" when a random BOE blue drops while in a group?  Is the person who wears the loot the only one who can need roll on it or should everyone have a shot at need rolling since auction house value of random blues can be very high and gold is a HUGELY valuable resource to everyone.   I have some friends who are quite seasoned WoW classic players and they say typically during leveling it should be expected that everyone rolls on a random blue, however, I see people flaming others for doing this.  Of course, I see both sides to it. 
---
Please advise.
---
I really like how difficult the heroic dungeons were though. At least for me at the time.  Group needed to be on point,  CC, ect.  Maybe they would be considered easy now, idk
---
You buy more from a general supplies vendor.
---
Who is the intended audience right now?  This is the sole factor you and everyone else is forgetting.  Who is dropping 300g for a Staff of Jordan?  No one.  Or someone waiting for PvP and willing to invest to resell.  In fact, people should be encouraging reasonable prices for gear as that lowers the stock when phase 2 and 3 hits.
---
I'd 100% tell a level 35 mage to equip a staff of Jordan.  It will be with him for 10+ levels.  And that is not an insignificant portion of his leveling either.
---
No one has 300g to burn on a staff of Jordan on fresh servers.  Anyone who does is using it for an alt or for PvP in the future.  This concept of sky high prices for BoEs is absurd and needs to stop.  Otherwise, you are wasting people's silver in AH deposits when they put the Staff of Jordan up for 300g and expect money overnight.  Then when it doesn't sell for 300 then 200 then 100 then finally sells for 25g, how much gold did you just waste on trying to get an absurd amount?

I think a lot of people understimate the state of pvp rogue in patch 1.12. All those talk about rogues beeing broken is from earlier vanilla patches.
---
I feel the same way killing mages as a rogue tbh. It's always mages that try to gank too
---
&gt; Now that Gouge is down, I go for the Poly - juke the Kick and force you to Kidney - now I Blink  
---
what would you do if the rogue blinds you after this part?
---
It's a meme born from reality, though. This didn't just come from nowhere
---
i didn't do anything cool when i hit 60. i just grinded in the same spot i did in vanilla. coincidentally, i hit 60 at the same time at night.

Honestly I think they will wait until the player base starts to show notable decline, then look at further development or expansions. If money is the goal, which it is, do as little as possible so long as you are still making good money.

I could see the tank being a good target, but I wouldn't ever soulstone a dps unless you've got more locks than tanks and healers.
---
It doesn't have to be an ideal wipe scenario, just not a shitty one. That's why you try to pull mobs TO your group instead of fighting on top of their idle spot. If you all die you should still be a pull's distance away.
---
Actually warriors are pretty weak in a 1v1 with rogues, although orc is a pain in the arse. Outside of orc and dwarf the rogue should win at least 60%.
---
It's Azeroth Autopilot, the colors are mob spawn locations you need to kill, the color lets you know which there are different mobs to get the drop(s) from.  E.g. one might be level 28-29 and the other color might be level 30-32, of might be an entirely different mob.
---
The bags are from Questie saying there is a mob drop to farm in this area.

The swords are from Questie sayin there is a mob to kill in this area.

I get that FD is bugged, but people are saying that FD+ frost trap doesn't work at all, which it does, its just awkward to use because you have to stand completely still

Haha...excellent.
---
Id rather see low effort memes than people bitching about OTHER people that are bitching about getting ganked on pvp servers.
---
Lmao that was the first thing i did
---
Um.. how dare you assume my realm type.
---
Correct.  Opening new servers for each expansion is a poor idea as you aren't pulling in massive numbers of new players but mostly targetting lapsed and casuals.
---
When you enter boat. Make sure you go below deck!!;)
---
I don't think he specifically means the people in the guild APES, I think he is referring to the hardcore community in general. Most Fight Club discord contributors were private server regulars
---
Most "copy-pastas" are from reality too but that doesn't make it not obvious satire.
---
You honestly can't just pin this generalizing "the horde". I've had so many alliance go out of their way in packs of 3 even, taking out whoever they see. You know, that's fine and part of the game, but it's definitely not the horde being assholes...People in general can just be assholes on the internet.
---
On the other side of it, I've seen plenty of nice interaction between factions personally as well. For every 1 bad alliance interaction I have i'll have another 9 peaceful or passive interactions. 
---
The truth is that if you're just trying to level and do it quicker, it's not always faster to just gank and farm cause if he doesn't leave you're both just playing chicken for who will leave and it wastes both your time. I honestly get much much more irritated with mass mage-AoE farming in some areas than i do with getting ganked
---
&gt; Healthstone frequently,
---
We must have vastly difference definitions of the word frequently.
---
Even with that there's no way you're ever getting anywhere near a competent mage
---
Your job is also to protect the party.  Seems like you're not very good at it.  You're not special for being a tank.
---
Yeah I'm just agreeing/bitching.  
---
Only took me to level 15 to remember how it worked, but I used to raid with a Hunter main so I should really have known better.
---
Warrior: \* starts bandaging \*
---
Mage: OMGWTF CANCEL THIS SHIT!!! STOP HIM!!!
---
A well reasoned, well detailed, and forthright response. I'm very pleased with this. I have my criticisms of how Classic has been implemented, but I also know it has to be challenging for the team working on it. Nobody lost anything significant from the bugs and it will be fixed before any difficult content is released - I think everybody wins here.
---
This is basically how I did the collecting quests outside of Uldaman's instance.
---
You've wiped?
---
That's how you do loot when you have it reserved.
---
You can get a swing timer that shows you the enemy swing time.  Reposition the mobs in the middle of a swing by running through or away from them with strafe and turning to face them when the next swing is ready.

Results improved with slow (Piercing Howl should be enough)

Much quicker ways. Youtube it. "The run"

Oh, I never thought of that application! Thanks!

I still enjoyed BC and a couple other expansions after that, but I was pretty salty about my gear being trash. I still saved that mageblade though just because.
---
Thank you friend!
---
The idea is to add item link support, and also count that said item if you have any amount I. Your bag.
---
So you can create a list like: "Farm 300 [linked_item]" and it'll show like: "Farm 300 [linked_item](123)"

I don't mean to be critical, but this isn't interesting at all. Literally nothing happened and this video just feels like someone trying to promote their twitch channel.
---
Dungeon finder was no easier or harder than dungeons prior to it, look at classic right now. People are farming BRD/ubers easily to get their bis (not exploiting btw), how is this any different than say someone doing a heroic once a day?
---
Heroics were a step up in difficulty even though they got easier over time the rewards they gave didn't scale up until the ICC set of dungeons came out.
---
It was like this for many many years anyway.

Horde on Myzrael is hurting for tank warriors in the mid levels. Not sure about other servers, but we are seriously lacking. The warriors that do exist all want to dps or are the tryhards that raced to 60.
---
This is the highest of quality meme.
---
As for the other AH price question, you don't want to sell things on AH unless you can get about 20% more than vendor price for it. That's a quick rule of thumb, at least. Some items, like crafting reagents, are easier to sell than others. It's mostly experience, but an addon like Auctionator can help you a lot.

---
This is my argument for Herb / Alch. Gold wise lv 30+ areas have decent herb rates on AH. 1G a stack or so. Crafting swiftness, invisibility, and other potions helps add some rogue ness to the warrior class who does not have sprint or vanish.

Unless the mob is stunning you or rooting you, you 100% can run.

And patrols happen, people back up into packs not pulled, etc, etc. You're really struggling to stretch this into some kind of argument that it's not.

It's proven that horde players are on average younger. Which correlates with their behaviour in-game.  YEAH I SAID IT! Come gank me!  Level 32 Avelyn @ Kirontos.

Wait it out or Block it if you're trying to keep up aggression. If he's at 100% life and used 2 cooldowns and you're not at risk of dying in his next opener, just wait since it's really letting your CDs come back up.
---
Since the PvP trinkets aren't out yet all you realistically need to do is land a single Poly since it 100% lets you reset the fight in your favor. Bandage up, resheep, Fireball &gt; R1 Frostbolt and just start kiting. You can force most of their cooldowns very quickly.

Layering abuse isn't necessary for fast mage leveling, just being able to AoE effectively.(which admittedly requires either a dedicated instance group or an empty area - but both of these are achievable in normal play...though getting empty areas might require playing outside non prime time)
---
Even if mages aoe is broken up, they still burst mobs quickly and don't care about water cost.

If Asmon had any integrity and cared about his viewers, he would not take gold or donations. It's that simple. He doesn't need it, he's rich, so he's no better than the worst of the 1% taking the actual hard-earned money from those who would get far more spending it on things they need in their own lives... they could upgrade their computers, etc... just because you can take something doesn't mean you should, that's what it means to actually have integrity and build character. Doing only what's easy isn't the way. Again, I say: If Asmon cared about his viewers, he would not take gold or donations.
---
Imagine how great Asmon and his community would be if Asmon was the one giving to those who needed it? Imagine if Asmon actually didn't just do gimmick runs and raids but when he heard from his people that Redridge was being sacked that he gathered up his people and went... instead of sitting in Stormwind for hours taking gold from impressionable children who just want to be validated.
---
This is teaching all the wrong values to him and his viewers. There is much I enjoy about Asmon's streams, the mog comps, the dps comps, but he hasn't done those in months... he becomes more and more self-centered every day. He lives off the toxicity he cultivates because he knows outrage attention is better than no attention. He just wants the attention and doesn't care whether he's creating a toxic environment.
---
I find it all rather sad. I unsubscribed from Asmon because he's just too greedy and self-centered and doesn't actually care about anyone but himself. He's all talk, it's all a show. It's all a lie.
---
If Asmon had any integrity and cared about his viewers, he would not take gold or donations.
---
You can say they want to give it to him, but the truth is, if Asmon had integrity he wouldn't exploit his viewers, he'd create something better, he would not take gold or donations. When you're as rich as Asmon, you should be sick of yourself to be still behaving this way...
---
I wish Asmon had integrity because I want to enjoy a community stream... but clearly he is not the one and people really need to stop making rich, egocentric, greedy people famous. He's the male gamer Kardashian, and he has no integrity.
---
Slowly we‚Äôre going to see the adrenaline rush of the mid-30s 2h tank melee dungeon cleave, mortal strike memes, the mid 40s slow down, the eventual preemptive and unprepared switch to DW fury for a change of pace, complaining about having to tank later dungeons off-spec and improperly geared, and then we‚Äôre back again at slow leveling.

Thank you, this is the response I was looking for.  It seems my suspicions were accurate and that the jury is out on this one.  I agree with you and those in the school of thought that a BOE should be need-rolled by everyone.  It is a rare and exciting opportunity when this happens and everyone should have a chance at it.  Your point about 100g being 100g for everyone and that the other player could simply buy the item on AH for that amount anyway makes perfect sense.  Logically, I agree with you but.....wait for it......howeverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, when a friend or guildie is in the group I feel like a royal dick rolling on an item they want to equip.  I guess the conclusion for this topic is that it's inconclusive and situational.  Darn.

For me personally, it was IMPOSSIBLE to get Herods Shoulder.  It took me 26 runs to see it drop, in that time I saw the helm drop 20 times.  Literally 20.  Axe dropped once and the pants dropped 4 times.

I went back to Hiilsbrad at a higher level to snag a cooking quest I'd missed, and while I was farming the lions a group of 3 alliance rounded a hill and their warlock instantly put Curse of Agony on me. Immediately after that, though, they ran away - presumably because of the level gap. As I was turning the quest in for the recipe, I see someone in /3 complaining about a group of alliance ganking in the hills.
---
Favorable fights indeed.
---
Its not the tanks fault because of a party wipe, I'm not placing blame nor am I taking sole blame either. It's just that a healer does exactly that. Heals people, ie.) resurrects them.
---
Why should everyone have to run back if he can just press a button and get us to spawn? Seems redundant just to be polite.
---
The mental gymnastics are incredible 10/10 form
---
I disagree, the whole "buff like crazy before a fight" skews the dynamic of RPG for me and I am glad they have made it a small cap, for whatever reason that may be.
---
Myself I screwed this up, and did all of Tedrassil, then all of Dun Moru, then all of Elewyn forest (including the level 1-5 areas), then All of darkshore, all of West Fall, then all of Loch Modan.
---
What I should have done was the 1-5 Nelf -&gt; 1-5 Dwarf/gnome -&gt; 1-5 Human,
---
Then picked up all the quests in Nelf land completed only green and yellow, dropping rest, then all the green in dwarf lands, then the greens in human lands, and then just cycle greens to next zone. it would have been way slower but tons more rep.
---
I don't really see the scenario when I'm in melee with mobs, team wipes and I somehow get far enough away from their spawn without my CDs to where they don't aggro. 
---
And you do need to be in melee sometimes as a holy pala for most efficient play
---
And then they don‚Äôt join, creating longer times that you aren‚Äôt in the dungeon. How thick is your skull dude
---
Works everytime
---
That's a bold move from the level 2. Respect. 
---
So did you let him live? Burn him down? Or buff that level 1 warrior and let him get the kill?
---
I mean, there's no incentive to gank when phase 2 comes.  It might get worse, but a level 30 something doesn't really have much to gain from PvP ranks compared to level 60s.  
---
Felwood, Winterspring, WPL, EPL, and Un'Goro are going to be nightmares though.  Anyone that is 51+ is going to get constantly and repeatedly ganked as soon as they land from the flight path by 60s farming honor.
---
I mean, it's a balance between realism and quality of life. Large character models are easier to see in a crowd, *especially* during a raid. I'm willing to take a little loss of realism to be able to quickly spot important characters.
---
Is everyone replying to me high as a kite? Lmfao.
---
Yea it seems that way to you because you have put maybe 30 seconds into thinking about it. Try looking at racial imbalances then get back to me (I wonder why orcs and undead are so populated compared to every other race? must be cuz they look cool!)
---
Am I the only one who hadn't had any problems with mages? Sure I play this damn game since forever, but I never played Vanilla extensively. Yet, up until now (32 undead warrior), all mages I crossed went down easily. I know it's a bit early, but aren't warriors supposed to suck shit until 60? I'm confused hahahahaha

Not op but I think it boils down to how most of the races are humanish (it's a word now). I was horde in vanilla, now I'm a dwarf pally. I would have liked to roll horde but all my friends went alliance, I rolled a pally because I thought if I have to roll alliance I'm gonna roll the one horde don't get, but I think the horde races are better from a fantasy point of view, I'm a human in real life and it's pretty shit, in a game I want to be something totally different. I am enjoying it though as it's made it a bit more fresh than if I relived the same experience as way back in vanilla.
---
‚Ä¢Take skinning and mining. Level in a zone where there's lots of both (like Mulgore; I don't level in Alliance zones).
---
Sell the light leather and copper bars on the auction house. If you post them one at a time, there isn't any deposit to lose selling them this way. If you post them in a stack, there is a deposit.
---
The bid price is pretty useless other than as a way to get your auctions to the top. Pick a decent bid price (for instance, 85c for a copper bar). There will be some chuckleheads who have posted their copper bar auctions with a bid price of 1c or so.  For all the auctions that have a lower bid price than yours, go and bid 1c more than your bid price on all of them (86c in this example). This will promote your auctions to the top of the list. You will then either get your money back on the bids because those chuckleheads have someone/thing automatically up the bid - which is fine because then you get your money back, and their auction is now even further down on the list. In the rare case you didn't get outbid, well now you have more copper bars to sell.
---
The light leather will only be good for making money for a little bit; but the copper bars have pretty good staying power. Once the light leather isn't cutting it anymore, you can ditch skinning for some other profession.
---
‚Ä¢Make a human alt and run it to Stormwind. Park him there. Whenever you see someone advertising money for guild signatures, hop on that toon, sign, and collect! Mail that easy money to your main. /gquit if that alt is still in the guild the next time there's an offer to sign for money.
---
‚Ä¢Find something the other side cannot easily obtain (you'll have to figure that part out yourself). Go to the Neutral Auction House in Booty Bay and sell those items there. Only use the Neutral Auction House for such kinds of items; they take too big a % cut for regular items. If you do this, make another alt to sit in Booty Bay for convenience.

I made about 4-5 gold by level 8 doing this in Classic.
---
Is it 50:50? I've been in Kalimdor mostly and ashenvale feels more like 87:4 horde:alliance with the remaining 9 being dead quest NPCs
---
Also stonetalon last night: passed 14 horde and 1 alliance.
---
I was hoping EK is fairing better
---
You're the hero we all need but nobody deserved, it's like anything lately that's remotely Alliance is "low-effort".
---
Jealous.
---
As a new player, i had no idea that the honor system wouldnt be in game for months. I thought the open world pvp would be great and id get something for doing it. Nope, total waste of time for everyone involved. Just makes my questing take way longer and 70% of "fights" are last hitting low healthy enemys while they are already in combat with mobs. I made a mistake. =/

For reference:

---
I want a fuckin Ghost Rider mechanostrider.
---
Honestly, dps-wise, druids are great dps-ers. My dps meter isn't that much different from other dps classes. Although healing and tanking, other classes are indeed better.
---
Yall RP server mutha fuckas are weird.
---
Yellow cap is 9% unless you have t1 shoulders you absolutely should wear your Wyrmhide Spaulders.
---
The rewards are amazing though, even if you only get to rank 13.  In vanilla I raided with a pvp guild that had a bunch of rank 13 and 14's and many of them rarely rolled on gear because nothing was an upgrade.  We had this rank 14 lock that I only ever saw spend dkp once, on Neltharion's Tear.
---
That sounds awfully clever for a member of the Horde.
---
How much gold COULD you have spent on useless spells?
---
I checked on my Warlock, and I only would have saved like... 9gold total. Nothing that would make or break getting a mount (if I didn't have a quest to get one).
---
Layering is not a server, I dont need to see a post "aboth" to see that
---
I mean, I did get that it was some 4chan nonsense, but the 'I'm not with her' sticker threw me off. I thought 4chan thought the feminists all voted for Hilary because woman? I lose track of what exactly the bullshit stereotype is at any given moment.
---
Exactly why I made one
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Hell yea i love buffing people questing underwater. 90% of the tine its useless, but everyso often its invaluable.
---
Sure the gold is there.  Is the demand there?  No.  People aren't snapping up Staffs of Jordan the moment they are listed for 300g or even 100g for that matter.  This is not a booming market where people with money are constantly looking for upgrades to their alts.
---
To get 300g or 100g, you have to babysit the AH and keep listing and relisting the item.
---
From levels 5-30. I don‚Äôt use much wand past 36 and I use almost none past 44. But we‚Äôre talking pre-40 anyway.
---
Nice waste of gold :P
---
I tried Questie but I disabled it because it felt like spoilers with how it just shows all the quests in areas I haven't reached yet. I enjoy the exploration aspect of MMORPG's, I just wanna make sure I'm exploring in the right direction first. I'll head back towards Ironforge and see what I find, thanks.
---
Sure, there is 100 level 60 on my server, but about 15k 1-50.
---
I have not started either of these
---
Yup, we can trade with a few classesand beat a couple in this patch but Locks, Mages and Warriors can be super difficult to win.
---
This caused me physical pain
---
I sure hope so!  I‚Äôm at 38 right now :) 
---
Druid master race!!!
---
Last I checked Nazgul wasn't a furry
---
I like dailies as long as the amount is kept in check and aren‚Äôt compulsory to player power. That way it‚Äôs okay to miss a few days, it‚Äôll only hurt your wallet or progress to some rep that rewards cosmetic.
---
They've confirmed it's a bug now.
---
Mrgl blrglll mrrrg?
---
Except plenty exist who would post that unironically.
---
Works
---
I don't actually record my gameplay, but maybe I should! What are some good programs you recommend for doing so?
---
Fuck that quest dude. At least the alliance on my server were tame that day. Only got in a pvp situation a few times doing it and they didnt come back after I dotfeared them.
---
It‚Äôs like all those ‚ÄúI hate reel big fish‚Äù shirts people had in the late 90s - they were sold by reel big fish - capitalizing on both ends. Making money from followers, getting exposure from haters
---
Design wise I would agree, that seduce though is just so good in pvp.
---
Well the two most beyond broken PvP racials exist for Horde so...
---
It‚Äôs all we got! Lmao
---
Fuck it ill say it.
---
$6000 mount right there boys
---
Yes, I get that - I‚Äôm just not sure what you‚Äôre trying to add to the conversation regarding using or not using evasion...?
---
It's been fixed.
---
My post was incorrect. A post I shared that's making rounds on discord. I made it. Its mine. 
---
The mental gymnastics you just tried to pull wins you a gold medal.
---
Me: Is bug
---
You: is not bug
---
Dad: is bug
---
You: told you
---
Pre wrath, zombie event was amazing.
---
Yep and you can customize the font size and stuff now. Just wish you could move the frame
---
On an empty PvE realm maybe.  The spawns are so contested there's no way you can do this in 30 minutes.
---
I'm an early bird and I find HUGE differences in how questing goes in the morning vs at night. 
---
In the morning it's just a bunch of people trying to get their shit done and avoid the crowds. 99% of people  don't attack eachother and even silently will quest and trade off mob kills politely. I feel like an asshole if I attack anyone. 
---
At night it's like a free for all and you never know if someone's going to just quest by you or attack you or wait for you to attack a mob and then attack you. I feel like I'm always looking over my shoulder, but in the mornings it feels like  just a bunch of quiet morning people trying to get their WoW chores done
---
I don't know what to tell youd ude, that dungeon sucked to run 15 years ago, it sucked in the revamp, and it sucks now. Shit dungeon you try to only have to run once. It's not a fun dungeon even if you're one shotting everything because some dingus is still going to get fuckin lost somehow.
---
b5w hes slowly leveling on one of the servers
---
i really h9pe one of the guilds on that server help him out with t2 and whatever he needs to play around with it again
---
Kruger Park, South Africa. I was on holiday there last week :)
---
There is a hidden debuff to this ability's hit chance in-game, I am almost convinced.  Although, if I am being honest, it also seems to crit more often too, so maybe it evens out
---
Opinion? Nah. It is a fact that anti heroes are cooler than actual heroes.
---
Exhibit A: Gnomes. 
---
Exhibit B: Undead.
---
They'd be in Make Azeroth Great Again, cause they've got more in common with e-nazis than furries.
---
a better mage
---
Two tacos so should've been fortitude and renew
---
Don't forget to burst with fire Nova totem
---
Lmao why are you making things up, thats thr first thing i did on day 1, im talking about improved texture packs like gta 5
---
Then you heard wrong. Go test it if you don‚Äôt believe me. 
---
I can‚Äôt find a single blue post or any amount of evidence that shows they botched hardiness from the 30% we expect.
---
From a lore perspective, doesn't it make sense that they do? I thought they were a night elf thing.
---
Not verry nice.
---
I actually lol'd
---
This is just plain false
---
It removes one curse/disease/poison/magic effect per 5 seconds, polymorph is a magic effect so yes.
---
yea dude, look up the shortcut. Saves SOOOO much time. I never do the full run anymore
---
SOPA DE MACACAO
---
Lol yeh... There's more to raiding than efficiency.
---
Thanks for the replies everyone. It‚Äôs fixed now, cheers.
---
It really depends on the context and phrasing. The dagger ears comment in the OP is clearly a joke since it's based around the in-game lore, just telling someone to eat shit isn't really the same thing. 
---
Beyond that, humour is subjective. Some might find an unclever and crude statement said for no reason to be funny, others might not. It doesn't mean they were offended, they may have just not found it funny.
---
I know the 1.12 questie you had to ctrl+shift+click to move it. I haven‚Äôt tried because it‚Äôs where I would move it to anyways
---
I can't believe the amount of shit you're getting for that story.
---
Agreed but damned if you do damned if you don't.
---
Pretty much this.
---
Yeah, and it's also a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCwtIAFdf9U) by the B-52's.
---
&gt; Thrall doesn't want anyone to die 
---
Of course he doesn't want anyone to die, geez! He just wants them to yield all their land and resources, so **nice** orcs can cut down all those unnecessary forests so that all can live in proper deserts instead. All the violence was in self-defense, really.   
---
In fact, Thrall is so pro-life that he's friends with undead. Truly, nobel prize winner.   
---
If you didn't get the memo, no one wants peace in world of **warcraft.** Yes, even Mary Sue Thrall. Because the only peace possible is a Pax Romana like peace. Its ruin all the way down baby.
---
if you dont understand why choosing when to break fear is better than having a fear ward on you then you simply have a pvp skill issue. 
---
No one is saying 30%. Stop mentioning pservers, dont care about them. They werent the real game. Hardiness is 25%. stun resist and it feels like it.
---
Man, i was playing old school runescape again before classic came out, and for whatever reason, OSRS and the classic WoW community are so high on themselves for doing 15+ year old content that has guides how to do it down to the very last millimeter. So many dick measuring contests on forums and major social hubs in-game.
---
The Hill Country is a bit red for Arathi. Not sure where to find slate looking rocks in TX though.
---
I raided all through about half of DS in Wildstar and the raids I thought were great, when they worked, but Wildstar's best thing was it's 4 dungeons.  Mordecai Redmoon at the end of Skullcano is to this date the best Dungeon Endboss in any mmo i've played, and I've played most of them.
---
I was in Hillsbrad looking for some fights last night , and a dude calls for help at the farms. I‚Äôm like bet , I have some quest there and I wanted to PvP. Win win. I respond in general that I‚Äôm on the way with my group, and he goes ‚Äúyou‚Äôre level 23 what are you even gonna do?‚Äù Like what? Haha you wanted help but that‚Äôs not enough apparently. Still went and crushed a couple hunters and druids. Fun stuff. Ungrateful bastards.
---
It's not hard but there's a learning curve. You can also import other people's auras, don't remember the link though.
---
Right but eventually you‚Äôll just run out of stuff right? I never played wow before classic came out, and I‚Äôve only just started playing it. But one of my concerns is.. eventually just running out of stuff to do without any new updates
---
Level discrepancy checks out
---
Ah excellent I'll just kill myself
---
You.
---
Higher levels attacking me get me popping a survivability CD so I can live long enough to hit them with the

---
Add in /golfclap if they're taking a long time to actually kill me
---
I got a hey buddy we're glad you joined we really needed a druid.
---
Oh you're a feral resto guy so are we.... Uh any chance you'd want to go balance?!
---
Your opinion is wrong.  People like you ruined this game first time around and now you're out in force trying to do it again.
---
Please, go through my posts and find a SINGLE time I said "our" or "we". I take back my my previous statement, you are an idiot. The only time I even said "you" was when when I was calling you an idiot. Every other time it was a royal you, as in not you personally but one who would be in said position. 
---
1. No, again you are wrong. You can be in a guild that is not hardcore and kill all the mythic bosses in retail. Hardcore implies you are pushing for rank. Cutting edge is no where near hardcore. One could get cutting edge and only raid 2 nights a week, speaking from personal experience. A hardcore raiding guild is not to provide players the opportunity to kill bosses they wouldn't otherwise be able to kill. It is to have to opportunity to achieve server firsts/high world placements. As I said before, you are not aware of what a "top" guild or a "hardcore" guild is apparently.
---
2. Again you are conflating a typical raid guild with a "top" guild. A hardcore top guild is not just trying to find 40 people. They have a specific goal in mind. Specific class distribution for each boss, ect. This barrier is necessary. Being in a top guild is going to take far more commitment than a typical guild that just clears all the content. Again, you are drastically uninformed on the topic.
---
3. These hardcore guilds are the top guilds. Maybe if you were complaining about midlevel guilds who have aspirations that are out of reach I would agree with you, but that's not what you have been saying. There simply will not be a 99% discrepancy in raiding in classic. In vanilla there was for sure. This time there will be not. The top guilds will be racing for server first kills then clocking speed clears after that. Normal guilds will progress through the content at their own pace but will deffinately clear it. The problem in vanilla wasnt that it was too hard.
---
Or an idiot if you click on the mage instead of the priest.
---
If i'm fighting a warlock, I want Fear Ward.   If I'm fighting a Mage, then WotF.    Fear Ward is just better than WotF for fights with Fear, so Warlocks, Priests, and Warriors.    WotF is better against Mages and Druids and Hunters (Wyvern Sting).
---
This is why I am sub spec...imp sap ftw!
---
Yep, I tried that first. It doesn‚Äôt move
---
5% base + 25% mentioned in racial is 30. You don't need a source for that because it is self-evident. Your claim of a change isn't.
---

---
Nothing proud about horde. All hunched over. Plus dwarf is master race.
---
I'd say it's completely relevant, it feels more like you don't like it because it contradicts your exaggerated point backed up entirely by anecdotal evidence. It happened to you once, so what?
---
N00b question: What does it mean to "reserve" gear?
---
Camp Mojache to Brackenwall Village routes you to Gadgetzan ffs.
---
I think you miss understand my argument, I admit it was a bit rushed.
---
The people who leveled in dungeons are leveling just as fast as players who leveled in the world all the by themselves. The world first 60, mage who aoe farmed all by himself, dinged 60 just like 8-10 hours shy of the world first warrior who leveled the whole way in dungeons. Clearly dungeon farming is very competitive regardless of how difficult leveling in the zerg is.
---
Easy killer. It was a question not a die hard WOW player and started with classic. Just trying to understand why this community seems to have a vendetta against any individual who streams.
---
Spec whatever you like buddy, fire isn't horrible and has a lot higher single target DPS/burst, but lower AoE, CC and survivability.
---
Don't feel forced to be an AoE grinder/spammer just because everyone else is doing it.
---
It depends on your playstyle. Many times guides will say "grind to" or something along the lines of that meaning that you should grind all of the mobs towards your next destination instead of running past them.
---
If you feel like you're behind, just throw a dungeon in every so often.
---
Is it just because of their drops?
---
Ysing this logic Classic WoW was fatal to BfA because it was "SPLITTING DA POPULATION".  Stop posting this retarded shit.
---
Thanks.
---
Back in the day I remember whenever people asked about player housing a lot of people complained about the idea, saying that they wanted resources to go towards more QoL changes, raid content and loot, not "playing house" which was derided as something for "babies" and "PvE care bears". 
---
I kinda wonder if they would feel the same way now.
---
Linking professions I agree with, as well as guild banks.  But do NOT agree with dungeon finder.  Just activate the instance summoning stones. That's all we need there.
---
ElvUI.
---
you should try out biographer, keeps track of mob kills.
---
Shadowed Unit Frames
---
The music and UI scare me
---
I know.  But they dont.
---
That could be an alright argument if there was a mail or plate equivalent to Truestrike shoulders, which there is not.
---
Besides that, the amount of armor an item gives is irrelevant in regards to PvE DPS.
---
"For the Horde!"
---
Eyeroll...
---
The original Guild Wars back in the day was pretty awesome, from what I remember on it's release. But unfortunately no real open world meant I just couldn't be bothered to play it too much before going back to WoW
---
Alliance or Horde?
---
For Horde, you can farm Silverpine Forest at that level and still get XP, I believe, there are a couple spots.
---
For Alliance, the cemetary in Duskwood should be fairly safe.
---
You can heal while silenced or out of mana with bandages. I always leveled it on my priest.
---
Todd, so hot right now!
---
If you want to spend all day swimming, then sure.  It's much faster to just run through the wetlands.
---
Memes are just memes; depending on your level and how many people are farming chocolisks in the wetlands, you'll only die two or three times.  The memes come from old PvP servers where the wetlands run provided gankers a guaranteed place to find helpless victims.
---
Is it not because you are using the linked Bagnon listed for version 8.2.0? O.o My Bagnon works perfectly fine.
---
Moveanything doesnt seem to work anymore. It‚Äôs possible to move but I and other people have gotten crashes or errors after a while.   
---
Guess I can try quartz. Thanks.
---
Pretty shit to be honest with you.
---
Boy these comments with guild names are a nightmare to read.
---
Because I shouldn‚Äôt need to, I also don‚Äôt raise arms against criminals on the streets of my city, because that isn‚Äôt my job. What the devilsaur Mafia does is break blizzards game design, and it is their job to punish exploiters and rule breakers.
---
I can guarantee there‚Äôs more pvp large scale pvp on grobbulus than any other server.
---
Look up the word battle on our sub r/grobbulus
---
I‚Äôve been in 5 40v40+ pvp raids in my week of playing. Only level 35 atm.
---
Rp players take pvp way more seriously.
---
if i maybe missed something that fellow warlocks or really any general macro idea let me know =P im only level 34 so im sure ill make a few more and if i do ill make a new post or update this one
---
Gotta get them blues baby
---
Horde also has Thorium Point though.
---
You failed basic reading comprehension, how shocked I now find myself. 
---
But it's too late, as you said everyone is laughing at me now, because you are a bully gatekeeping WoW facts. 
---
No one is allowed to speculate or form their own opinions on how things work on WoW until they check with you or tardsout.
---
(Do I have to type the /s so you get it this time?)
---
What a fucking tard.
---
What a hero lmao
---
Rage generation is always an issue until you start picking up +hit gear and start taking more damage.
---
Additionally, speccing prot before 54-60 is not really advised as you can still tank in other specs and have a much easier time questing.
---
If the buyback slots on a vendor are full you can still sell to them. As far as I know, vendors buy forever. All a full buyback tab means is that when you sell them something else, it will push the oldest thing out of the list and you won't be able to buy it back anymore. The buyback tab is just there so if you accidentally sell something important you can get it back if you notice right away. You can still sell to vendors when it's full.
---
Best way of getting "Crunchy" gameplay
---
We should bring the murlocs into the Horde.  After all, it's you Alliance scum that have this famous recipe in your major city!
---
If his alternative is to stand and wait? Surely not a good move at all, but it hardly mattered.
---
I always thought it was "Incoming Thread Title"...
---
According to wowhead, it has a 0.04% chance to drop from foulweed warrior (I assume that's your mob since it ran away in fear).
---
Twice in a row is 0.04*0.04= 0.0016% chance
---
What is that minimap
---
Later phase.
---
i just did this with my shadow priest solo. MC killed a few mobs in, then ran in. fear bombed, looted egg, and died trying to jump out the window there.
---
Nice leveling guide. Subbed.
---
Winter is coming
---
Priest on Faerlina got it last week. World first I believe.
---
It does not help no, but blizzard deserves some critique for how poorly they have introduced this game.
---
That‚Äôs, literally, the classic experience.
---
Not the OP, but what about having a dungeon finder that  just assemble the group?
---
You'd still have to get to the instance, and talk on the way there. Less incentive to ninja leave as well.
---
Agreed, he should have been focusing on healing first and foremost. Gives balance druids a bad name ;)
---
Dwarf master race checking in
---
That's my plan though i'm currently skin/tailor then i'll probably switch skin to mining then to engi when I have enough mats.
---
Blizz needs on offical stance on layering in the world. What is and isnt okay.
---
For example... if im AOE farming and everything is dead.... or i kill a rare mob.. the layer over for respawns... is that wrong? Most of us would say yes. To make this more interesting... everything is scaled up from 2005 .... there are like 10x the amount of people... so maybe stuff like this will balance itself out.
---
Second scenario .... what if its just to play the game? Youre doing a quest and its soooo busy you cant even tag a mob... would you ban that guy for asking a guidie for a layer invite?
---
What if its because a bugged quest mob wont spawn?
---
Is there some hidden rule that Feral Druids can‚Äôt tank in lower level dungeons? I keep doing it. We clear the dungeons. It‚Äôs easy.
---
Chest pains... might have to go to PVE sever...no wait I'd rather die.
---
I‚Äôd like to qualify this with ‚Äú...in dungeons‚Äù. Outside of mythic raids (even then...), raid tanking in retail is one of the most boring roles in the game.
---
I thank you kind sir we warriors have it tough lol
---
its the 30 year old boomer meme, almost no actual 60 year olds play this game
---
Gratz!
---
dude theres retail. this game is probably not for you.
---
It‚Äôs right there
---
The sass in this comment gives me life.
---
2h tank in d stance primarily. On trash I charge -&gt; SS -&gt; iron grenade -&gt; WW -&gt; zerk rage -&gt; then sit prot stance and tab sunder
---
I like this option and it be a 1 time offer. You can transfer them to a xpan server, but you cannot go back or undo it.
---
Yeah, Cannibalize is awesome.
---
I‚Äôm confused. You guys are obviously well off, why would you need to ask for permission to get something that‚Äôs relatively inexpensive and adds a fair bit of convenience to your gaming sessions? Also, I barely know anything besides the few sentences you posted here and this picture, but it sounds like the kind of deal a mother would bargain with their son.
---
If I see someone die, I'll rez them on my druid. What's a cooldown and some coin between strangers?
---
Oh my god yes. I don‚Äôt need to be topped off. Stop panicking the moment my health drops below 100%. I‚Äôm just life tapping. Stop using your least efficient heals on me. 
---
As an aside, I love being the suicidal class. I‚Äôm damn well committed to dying if I cast hellfire on an AoE pack, and I‚Äôll be happy for it.
---
I've heard mixed answers on this: will the epic hunter bow Rhok'Delar be obtainable in phase 1? Some people told me no, because parts of the questline require world bosses. Others say yes, the world boss drops for it can be found elsewhere.
---
Blink in.
---
Frost Nova.
---
Egg Loot.
---
Blink Out.
---
Raptor is way cooler bro
---
Agree with the idea that locks should not "expect" a heal in the same way that they shouldn't "expect" their healer to be competent. 
---
I'm saying this as somebody that cannibalizes off cooldown in groups and is very mindful of my healers mana.
---
Not healing a tapping warlock on principle makes you a bad healer, but warlocks should expect to have bad healers sometimes and adapt accordingly when it happens.
---
You are correct in saying that warlocks have tools to convert mana into health, but most of those tools have a ratio of 1:1 to 1:1.2.
---
Those methods are nowhere near as efficient as a renew or a rejuv.
---
Again, none of this is directed at OPs story, more at OPs statement that DPS players shouldn't receive heals.
---
Yeah the part I like is having something familiar I can log in and start doing for progress while I figure out what exciting things I might do during that session. I don't like falling behind my guildies if I can't get online for a few days or whatever.
---
 I think they should still have the dailies just don't gate the content behind them. Provide alternative ways to rep up that don't punish those who have a lot of time every once in a while instead of a little bit of time each day. 
---
Are you subbed at r/Classicwowplus ?
---
That's wonderful.
---
Wait until you clear Naxx, then ask for new content (this will never happen).  Thank you have a nice day.
---
idiot.
---
Is it self evident that Anger Management generates free rage?  Cause it does, and the tooltip mentions nothing about it.     The tooltip isn't the end all, and its still vague with "additional 25%" really means.
---
I dont think the double crit while he's frozen is a coincidence
---
Can't blame you mate :)
---
Do yourself a favor and get it off your action bar. You should be using sunder armor, whirlwind, mortal strike, overpower, and your shouts.
---
You‚Äôll become a furry in no time
---
Probably not unless you invest an enormous amount of time and effort into being the one and only enhance shaman in a raid group where not always is enhance even guaranteed a spot
---
Here you go,  [https://wago.io/KBL3nBoZ6](https://wago.io/KBL3nBoZ6) . just press copy import string and import ingame by clicking /wa and import
---
my suggestion: take a break for awhile or go run some instances for a lvl or two.
---
I used the Twitch app, went to WoW add-ons, selected classic Wow, searched Bagnon, and downloaded it from there - I just used the first link that showed up on Google. I can't show it in the Twitch app because I'm at work. But every time I try to run it, I get errors that it's outdated, I try running it anyway, and nothing ever changes on my bag UI.
---
Go bAcK tO rEtAiL

more impressed by the fact that morpheus has a hat at 23
---
Coool coool water
---
You dont even know how much that helps us.
---
I mean you are wrong but that‚Äôs okay. You can google it if ya want! &gt;120 ms is the criteria.
---
It‚Äôs a closed story because you say so? 
---
This is a new thing. It‚Äôs not just a vanilla server. It‚Äôs not just a private server run by blizzard for the people from privates. I think there is a way to keep that population happy. My choice would be to maintain a server that won‚Äôt get content patches and allow people who want that to transfer to that server. 
---
Contrary to what you may believe, not everyone will have the same desires you do for the future of this game. 
---
The reason people are asking about post naxx options is because there is a large group of people who want to know what blizzards thought process is on that. The reason being is because blizzard will most likely need to make a decision on that in a few months because even if it‚Äôs re-releasing servers with burning crusade on it, that takes time. 
---
Just because you want it to never change, does not mean that it won‚Äôt. And honestly, if adding content means that some player base will leave, blizzard will need to see if the people who will leave on the addition of content is more or less than the people who will leave when the content for classic is done. Because as much as people want to say they will leave if content is added, there are people who will leave if it ISNT supported.
---
While you're not wrong, this isn't a discussion about level 60 builds. This post is about managing threat in leveling dungeons, so it's fair to assume we're all discussing builds that are used while leveling which tends to be affliction.
---

he's clearly using something to automate duplicating commands, isnt using a program to cast spells/move against the rules?

youre a pessimist and the guy you responded to is an optimist. Different ways of living, being a pessimist is just way worse for your mental.

I was a highly ranked fire mage in PvP back in vanilla. I used to run BGs wearing spellfire gear while everyone else was rocking PvP gear.
---
Your motto as a fire mage is "die fast, kill faster."
---
Use *every* tool at your disposal. Rank 1 frostbolt is your friend. You can shut down so many people pursuing a flag carrier (or a friend questing) just by spamming rank 1 frostbolt, nova, CoC, and polymorphs.
---
Mages in classic have *so many* tools at their disposal. Use them *all.*

That's amazing, like she did that only for people like you, maybe just the two of you, with the risk of not being noticed at all.

Get AdiBags instead.  It not only makes all you bag slots one big bag, but it also organizes the bag by categories to keep track of your stuff.  And has a temporary ‚Äúnew‚Äù category for recently looted items to make them even easier to find.
---
Mid 40s slowdown? I run dungeons( zf ) all day, currently 48 and I am literally always first place dmg wise.  Even lvl 50 mages dont top me, so its definitely highly dependant on how u play. Theres loots of bad warriors
---
Impale only applies to yellow attacks, which are few and far between, so it's usually not worth the 2 points for a long while.
---
Elvui from what I understand
---
Druid is not the class to pick if you want to use one set of gear. It goes against the core strength of the class
---
I agree that communicating is the answer. You both have a right to roll for the loot, it‚Äôs just that rolling for it without specifying that you need the gear for changing spec is a bit rude.
---
The patch that classic stared in and what vanilla was in for the first 9 months are incomparable. What I wrote still stands, and even with the major class buffs and enemy nerfs in 1.11 that classic has, BRD, for example, still easily takes 2 hours to full clear; even with 2 mages.
---
Basically if you can get through a fight using 1 potion instead of 2, that means you get an extra cast of frost bolt. Its not a huge increase, but if you want to stand out, always being in the top 3 of damage instead of sliding around between 3rd and 8th, making sure you always get that one extra cast is a good way to do it.
---
For Zygor's you can always select the leveling guide for silverpine and hammer through those to catch up on XP.
---
Quite a few leveling guides are very tunneled into "this is most efficient" as it prevents travel time. If you're a super efficient class (mage/hunter/warlock) xp/hr grinding can be pretty decent. But this is also really tedious and boring.
---
Alternatively, you can do a dungeon to get ahead in xp.
---
I feel bad now. I'm just remembering I got randomly blessed yesterday and was busy reading a quest so I didn't respond. This is my cross to bare now...
---
He is cause in classic orc racial correlates to actually hit %, not like it was on private servers. 
---
I think without world buffs being super obtainable, go for more crit. I did a shaman this round so my warrior is only 31 but I suppose the way to go is track your misses vs your flurry uptime and see what area you should improve on.
---
It's not awful, tbh, but you have so little crit while leveling anyway that it's not usually worth it.
---
I take it anyway, though,  because the alternatives really aren't that much more effective.

Is the paladin epic mount not working?

tho it makes sense that you have bigger crowds are youre at the average level. you said youre 30-40 right? theres other places aside from stv or try some dungeon running. dont let ppl on here scare you from dungeon running, its literally what i did in vanilla to level.

Thanks, I'll check it out when I get home later.

Nah man. You‚Äôre a prick because you‚Äôre a prick. People asking questions about a game they haven‚Äôt played IN a subreddit for that game doesn‚Äôt make them stupid.

So again. Go fuck yourself with a rake.

Every time I pass a dark pine forest near where I live, I imagine it's Duskwood. Going through a green forest - STV. Walking down a neat green park - Elwynn forest. 
---
Kneeling down to touch snow in the middle of a windy open waste in winter - I AM FREAKING ARTHAS.
---
I also dont carry food or water for these reasons, but it's just wrong to say that it isn't super efficient for the whole group for my healer can throw a HoT on me to let me tap a few more times.
---
It's not about "needing" the heal, it's about optimizing the performance of the group.
---
1) Gotcha, but won't most of my upgrades still be from quest rewards/dungeons? Or does it get to the point where most of your upgrades will be from the AH?
---
1 edit) Yeah, maybe I should devote a day to that. It's just that I've been using a Raptor this entire time and haven't bothered with other skills mainly because I don't want other skills competing for Pet Mana other than Growl. Am I wrong in thinking that? *(Not to mention, Stabling Pet -&gt; capture new pet -&gt; lvl with it to learn skill - Stable Pet and get back old one -&gt; teach new one seems like such a slog/hassle which is why I haven't bothered with it)*
---
2) Nice, I'll definitely make a bank alt. As for my Warlock alt though, what other ways can he help my main apart from stuff like Agility Potions or whatever?
---
3) Gotcha, thanks
---
4) Never thought about that, so that's great to hear. Safe to assume most players are still pre-40 right now? So their gold is going to be going to their mount instead of buyiny crafted gear from others?
---
5) Will do, thanks again!
---
Do Horde deal with murlocs and kobolds to the extent that Alliance does?
---
Seems like Horde mostly deal with quillboars and non-Horde members of the same race.
---
With those arms, I don't think they can reach.
---
It‚Äôs you, not the class. I got to 10 on my priest in two and a half hours.
---
I always try to invite priests to group that stam buff me so I can give them battle shout lol. I'd love to be able to do more, but what can you do?
---
DUDE ALL THE TIME!! No one will be in combat, tap to 90% mana and start bandaging or eating a corpse and the healer continues to heal me then sits and takes even longer to drink. I can't even tell you how many times stuff like that has happened. I can count on one hand the amount of aware/efficient healers i've had while leveling.

Hit cap is all melee swings at ~9%

Your white hits are more important than your abilities, especially as a warrior, as it helps you generate your resource.

Dead-zoning warriors to reset the diminishing returns on my stuns feels so good.

How about you go somewhere else with this shit. The game hasn't been back out a month

All weapons are hunter weapons, duh.

I get that they are different in PvP and even in PvE. It‚Äôs just they fill the same niche role (especially in pve).

Ofc it does. I had many people camp me while I quest. And it doesnt help horde always outnumber the alliance when I try to fight back.
---
Wow... what a snowflake you are...so precious.

No the idea was to wait for a OP proc while you can hit it, then Warstomp, MS, then OP

Go to Grom'Gol via the zeppelin in Orgrimmar or Undercity and there should be some quests there. There will also be some quests in Nesingwary's camp near the northside of STV. Booty Bay may have a few too, but I think those are mainly lvl 40 quests.
---
Oh that's BIS for me for level 23-25, so it obviously needs to go to me.
---
Bonus:
---
Priest: OMG you rolled on spirit caster necklace!
---
Me(warrior): it gives 9 Stan and 4 spirit... Its twice the tank necklace than caster necklace...
---
I respecced around 35 or so to grab consecration in the holy tree and then grabbed SoC in ret. Paladins will never be threat generators like warriors or ferral druids. We just can't compete with that. But if you get a good group and use only rank 1 consecration. Keep your 2-H on. You need that extra DPS to help with threat generation. Anyone who tells you to switch to sword and board is uneducated about the subject. Damage(Holy specifically) is your main source of generation.
---
Just don't expect to be able to hold all mobs if you aren't allowed at least a little time to drop 2 concecrations in a row at minimum when fighting groups. Vets and many newer players already know this or are quickly learning. 
---
I honestly recomend to sticking to DPS or Healing in dungeons. Don't need to spec differently for that. Ret pallys are just fine for dungeon healing. And they shine for dps in undead locations like SM GY. And ret is the way to go as a solo leveler as well.
---
Really just chiming in to say the same thing but 10% seems pretty fair for a rare craft. Your time isn't free and you won't exactly be selling thousands of these in a day or anything.

&gt; "You picked a PvP server didn't you?"
---
&gt; "PvP is happening on a PvP server?

I hate it when people say this.  Meanwhile I'm always asking where it happened so I can get in on the fun.
---
It's not replacing BGs.
---
But nothing is going to be changed so this is pointless
---
Personally I don't find it that useful while leveling, but basically you create your character, punch in your level, and then go to the bottom and click 'auto-fill.'
---
It will then populate the character sheet with what the site believes is your BIS. Click a slot to expand a list of alternatives for the slot.
---
As a hunter I wish I could buff you guys.
---
can you  share those basic addons?
---
I don't buff anyone with that shit because both of those spells require reagents.
---
Oh I agree completely, I always wanted player housing. But back then I think it was common to take the community aspect of WoW for granted. It was common to trot out the line "It's world of WARcraft, not World of X" whenever something like this was requested. When people requested changes it was rarely in the interests of developing the community, usually it was about making a spec viable or improving PvP or making things more convenient. 
---
I think the attitude shift now that we as players have woken up to what made Classic so much fun to play might mean that people would be more receptive to the idea.
---
titan panel
---
The only thing about playing warrior is I wish i had a buff to give to the kind people who help me not die to two mobs
---
What are your thoughts on gear? Like I said above everything I have right now is Str / Agi + Stam so if I respec it‚Äôll be the talent cost plus AH hunting, unless I run a few dungeons as Enh / utility and hope to get a few pieces. Already have my mount and I know I‚Äôll be healing at 60 so maybe it‚Äôs worth the upfront cost now?
---
Yeah man roll mage, sounds like you made up your mind.
---
Finally got sunder armor last night and just use rend and stack sunders and the mobs die faster then heroic strike rotations. I don‚Äôt think I could handle leveling a warrior if I wasn‚Äôt playing with my fianc√© who‚Äôs playing a priest.
---
I have a lock a priest buff while we were waiting for the zeppelin and he made and gave me a health stone
---
I apologize on behalf of the horde. I PvP with a shadow priest in my group (we are 42) at STV as we have a couple more quests there. We were camped hard in hillsbrad from 27-30 by three 35+ gnome mages. So we‚Äôve been returning the favor. Sucks your server is so toxic. Whenever we post ‚Äúcouple alliance by the quest turn in‚Äù, like 5 horde show up and throw down. It‚Äôs been pretty sweet.
---
Tldr go to retail
---
IMO, STV isn't worth going to at peak times. If the server is full there is just too much competition for mobs. Only worth going on off-hours or if you have a lot of quests that can be done easily in groups.
---
Played as a lock in vanilla, priest now. General rule is you dont get more than a renew. Also if i see youre low on mana and i pop a renew on you i expect you to tap
---
Im a fully geared main tank with half t1 gear from mc the past 2 weeks. I get whispered literally constantly asking to tank 5 man instances that drop literally nothing for me, on top of a 5g+ repair bill on a good run.
---
You better bet your ass if you want me to run I'm getting paid. I can't farm the open world, I farm 5 mans. My gear and experience ensures the run goes compelty smooth even if a dps ass pulls 99% of the time I can recover and keep the run going.
---
I know the pats, the los spots, I bring grenades and consumes and the runs are done in half the time a fresh tank could do it. 
---
I make it very clear before the run that any and all upgrades can go to who ever needs them. I'll also clear every quest the group might need but for my time and effort I expect to receive the green drops that noone else needs.
---
World chat gets so butt hurt, half are expecting a carry when I slogged my ass through with my guild group in garbage greens to get to where we are now.

---
Welp I learned of a new copy pasta today
---
I mean, at the same time its not always the end of the world if a mob is pulled off a tank. Tanks need to realize ultimately, health pools are a resource.
---
I mean if someone is busting off aggro the second a mob is pulled and its sitting on the the whole time it is up, sure that is one thing. However, say a caster is at range and gets enough threat to pull when its about halfway dead. Now its spending some time wanderng up to that ranged. Then it hits them once, and dies. They can shrug off the hit and likely regen that health with natural regen before it happens again. 
---
My first dungeon was WC as a priest and I was healing. But, considering the "healing" was a full cast heal on the tank every 15 seconds or only when bad pulls happened, I spent a lot of time wanding to kill things faster... which means less damage taken which means less mana I spend on heals. Sometimes I would pull threat on stuff. It would hit me for like 100 to my 600 health pool. Once, maybe twice. I would regen most of that from spirit tap. This was damage the tank didn't take. Damage I didn't spend mana to heal. It made the run smoother. 
---
One thing any tank needs to learn is when to just let a mob go. Sometimes things don't need to sit on you the whole time. Put a hamstring on it when its half health and target the next thing. It likely wont hit someone before it dies if you lose it. Don't feel the need to always be under control. Just manage health so no one dies.
---
The lack of random aoe damage (for the most part) means dps not having full healthbars isn't as huge a risk as it is in modern expansions.
---
Yeah, by fighting them in the first place.
---
Yep. Before this reddit thread, it thought it was common knowledge. 
---
Now that I know that no one gives a shit, I'll be a lot less respectful with the items I'm rolling on.
---
It's okay, I found the problem.
---
"Do people think that it is a good idea for the general public to have these kind of weapons?"
---
Awwww, its retarded.
---
Cool justification. Blizzard and anyone with a basic grasp of economics disagrees with you. Also no one said it is the sams as layering in dungeons. I said it affects the economy. Which it does. You gain resources at a far higher pace than would have been gained without it (doesnt always mean someone else would have gotten that node, it could have gone unmined for much longer). Also allows for monopolys which wouldnt have happened if the resources would have been spread out among players. Do I need to explain to you why monopolys are bad or do you have that covered?
---
Horde didn't exactly come peacefully so... yeah Horde are actually the villains there
---
Actually if you read the blue post this is an issue that was latent in the 1.21 original patch. Which is why it's a problem at all.
---
Sellout
---
My method was blindly allowing TradeskillMaster to make me rich with little to no brainpower used to using it.
---
All I was trying to say was that why bother pennypinching when you're about to get 1 skill train's worth of silver with each mob you kill later on.
---
If you never use the skill, I can understand that. I could have skipped having Enslave Demon, never used it once, but I wouldn't have regretted training it.
---
Wanna know what's more insane? People who hate the guy keep giving him free publicity, thus setting his place in stone moreso than it was before.

---
Wtf did I just read?
---
I am a level 36 enhancement shaman. I am changing to elemental at 40 to level faster. All these anti shaman posts are getting me down on what I have chosen. I like to pvp and raid but I do not like to heal or tank. 
---
Are elemental shamans really that bad in raids or am I reading bad advice?
---
Lol sleep dust,  sleep dust pet stab Hunter
---
I would too, but only in the short term. It would get old. Just getting unlimited currency and mats handed to you in an mmo takes away a large chunk of the point of playing. 
---
Asmon has been doing it for years.
---
I dont want to play the assumption game and make this about you and me. The bottom line is that there is never a reason someone should be shouting for honor in pvp combat, if you dont want to engage with other players of any level then PvP realms arent for those people
---
2hand tank at low level. With decent groups you can do so til about 50. I played warrior in vanilla, retail and now classic. I used to 2hand tank ubrs with a buddy. Both of us were using unstoppable  force. Good times.
---
You may want to clarify in your post that you are talking about longterm changes. As it is currently worded, people will assume you want them now.
---
Most people that spec Fury for leveling choose a 2h for one HUGE reason.
---
Hit chance. 
---
Not only do you have an increased chance to miss because you're using two weapons, but 1H weapon natively has more chance to miss than a 2H by game design.
---
Since while leveling no one specs for +Hit it's usually common to get a 2H wep over 2x 1H.
---
The +healing IMO is only better when you get to the point where you can downrank to conserve mana.
---
Then again I don‚Äôt really play priests, I‚Äôm a pally healer so YMMV
---
XD I hope Asmon reads my comment
---
They should have declined to invite you as soon as they saw you were 43.  
---
We brought a 43 lock in our at run and as 1h tank I was out dpsing them. 
---
At 43 you can‚Äôt hit your target at all and are dead weight compared to a lvl 45+ DPS
---
Grind out a couple more levels and come back. Even if you find a group that will keep you, it will be excruciatingly slow, and frustrating for the party.  
---
Part of this is your responsibility. You‚Äôre under-leveled for the content in that instance.
---
Thus perpetuating the cycle of violence.
---
They don't. Also they only get to be 4 classes so
---
Can you explain why using evasion against a warrior opens you up to overpowers, but protects against MS?  I don't understand.
---
Who hurt you
---
&gt; Anyone who thinks there's a difference between factions players is a low effort human tbh
---
There is a very clear difference in the raiding communities within each. It's also shown that new players tend to make Alliance characters first. Let's not jump the shark here, there are known differences. If anything it's low effort to say there aren't.
---
cool anecdote. Some people choose classes for looks and others for min maxing.
---
I'll be honest, last week I was in a bad mood after getting poly cheese'd over and over by an ally mage and his priest buddy. I was running through the quarry in Searing Gorge when I saw an ally trio about to start on the Overseer (3 elites). They let me pass, I got some distance, popped elemental mastery, turned and chain lightening'd as they were fighting. Think I 1 shot one of them, the other 2 died shortly to the elites.
---
There was no honor in what I did, and it didn't really make feel better. But chain lightening is cool, and ally blood needed to be spilled.
---
You forgot to buy a wand silly
---
Go to the first town outside UC and you will probably find someone who sells a wand (if not go to UC and buy one. Cost almost nothing)
---
Your rotation:
---
Dot the mob up, then just wand it down. Heal if you need to and/or apply a shield. Pull next. Remember to cast the spell in a sequence. Then wand for the rest. After 5 seconds of not casting a spell your mana will regen. 
---
Spec: 5 in wand (disc) and 5 in spirit tap (shadow). Doesnt matter which you take first. Continue afterwards with putting points in shadow
---
Someone sounds like a butthurt alliance.
---
Man you're a fucking idiot. Have fun getting your items taken from you by a GM for being a douchebag who doesn't understand what is okay to roll need on. You're spiteful and petty and the people you interact with will notice that. Have a shitty life.

A lot of us are tired of multiple classic+ threads an hour with no original ideas. Join any of the other classic+ threads of go to the subreddit dedicated to it. Don't be surprised when no one likes your ideas

I just hit 34 and the grey weapons I'm getting vendor for 30-40s. Armors for 10-20s. It's getting easier!

I love the responses that literally say what you are saying, but then claim it means its intended.

This thread seems to indicate that Horde is underpopulated there, although not by a huge margin. Either way I love Grobb, can't wait to gear up and dish out some revenge once I hit 60 and PvP gear gets released.

That‚Äôs rough man. I feel for you.
---
Arms and fury generate more threat per second then prot does while in def stance... prot spec is really just good for the damage reduction. And u only need that for raiding really...
---
Stop buying all ranks of every spell. That alone will save you 30g+ on your way to 40.
---
Is your wand up to date with greater wand? Yea 90% of damage is wanding and dots but at 15 I can take on 3 mobs if I have to. But usually never get close to dying or running out of mana in most cases.

Yeah they drop rocks. A LOT of rocks.

that's my usual strat. relying on them not being able to react quickly enough.

I mean the world first Rag kill was a raid group with half the people not even being 60. People are better now. If he wants to go feral I'm sure y'all will be fine.
---
It's true what they say, horde are from Omicron Persei 7, alliance are from Omicron Persei 9
---
Yes, absolutely. What I'd like to see if they explore Classic+ would be player housing/neighborhoods with meaningful content and crafting (maybe a new carpenter profession), more dungeons and raids at high level, but *most importantly IMO*, more level 1-60 content. This would make leveling alts fun and not repetitive, add more dungeons for them, new quests, additional shared zones (some underground and underwater perhaps to avoid altering the map too much) more ways for them to level to 60 so they don't just get sick of it and stick with their highest level characters all the time.
---
Don't just make it easier and faster to level, which leads to people speeding through the content to get to the endgame. Give people a reason to inhabit and explore the world so it stays alive and there will always be people of different levels running around.
---
I know this because during vanilla I accidentally right-clicked the flight dude. They didn't like that...

&gt; No they don't. Closest Horde FP to BlackRock Mountain is in Badlands or Burning Steps.

They're made up words just for this thread.

I'd take free gold, the YT/Twitch revenue, and PinkSparkles' holes. Not gonna lie.
---
Great post. But do you just mark a mob and not inform people to kill skull first? Also might help to communicate that you‚Äôre pulling around the corner.
---
Not reeeeeally into fishing though? Can I mine it the same way as copper? Or skinning, can I mine that instead?
---
There are plenty of areas to quest if you think you'd have more fun doing that than grinding, it might just be that grinding is the most efficient way. 
---
By any chance, is this your first time on WoW? Or on Vanilla? In my opinion, having played a lot of vanilla, I'd urge you to think about dropping the guide. Vanilla leveling is all about the discovery and adventure, in my opinion. It may be slower, but I genuinely think a new player should get immersed into the world - go the places you want to check out, read some quests and try to figure out the objectives like a puzzle (there are some really fun riddle-esque quests), stumble across a dungeon and form a group to delve into the unknown with. 
---
Ironically, I think trying to use a guide to be most efficient in terms of hastening the leveling grind will only make it more of an unbearable grind. This isn't to say my way is the only way to enjoy it, I just wanted to extend this advice in case you felt like your experience was becoming too grindy for you to enjoy.

Are you one of those people that enjoy playing new people in games like LoL instead of people your own rank? usually i find these people to be insecure in their own skill that they compete against people with less skill than them to prevent themselves feeling down for getting outplayed. A true beta male.
---
People didnt realize the importance of shadowmeld until BC and arenas. Nothing like fighting a NE war druid combo for 2 hrs to make you kill yourself

---
Oh not, not zebra hooves! The drop rate is so low! Just like every other quest in the game!
---
Lesser heal rank 1 may be cheaper but it's less efficient. 
---
Best thing to do is wait until you know a full lesser heal will not go to waste, and cast it. Then use your downtime to regain mana while you wand targets to death.
---
I probably wouldn't even accept a hearthstone because I'm so low on bag space when running dungeons.
---
Aye, which only applies to affliction spells.
---
You're fun
---
try a macro that casts every rank of your buff spell in descending order
---
Crippling poison slow &amp; kite
---
If I wanted retail, I'd play retail.
---
False.
---
What hunter is actually taking Wyvern Sting?
---
Pls pass what you're smoking.
---
Pssh I come from deep within the ruins Lordaeron, your once proud capital brought to it's knees by a few sacks of grain and a bad case of whooping cough.
---
Lol. I'm on Herod right now.
---
The only side I'm on is the far side of the number line, where I count down my place in queue
---
 (.__________.  )
---
Wheres the lie?
---
bro we legit just had this conversation.
---
&gt;But if you think it was to brag about my green post, you are simply wrong.
---
i don't think this. I ~~think~~ know it was to brag about your green post *and* the fact you proved your guildie wrong by way of your own green post.
---
Yeah, if you're already using downranked spells there's not much else you can do as a priest. Well, other than letting the DPS die if they pull instead of the tank, lol. I'm glad you're enjoying it though. Healing is very rewarding and is the most challenging role in classic, in my opinion!
---
Some of you want it, and you can't agree on what it is you want or when.
---
Shh, NE hunters are lamer 14 year olds every one.  For some reason I never hear bitching about shadowmeld even though it's 100% top shelf and I'd like to keep it that way.
---
Yeah I think it would be cool to have an awesome raid progression for classic+ and I do not want to see the return of so called "welfare epics." That said, I am in no way going to destroy my entire life for the sake of clearing Naxx in order to reach the Classic+ raids.
---
Elaborate.
---
What the fuck has happened to our world (of warcraft) with actual sentences like this existing?

#TENACIOUS | PVP | HEROD | HORDE
---
**WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE TENACIOUS?**
---
Tenacious is a long tenured, multi-platform gaming community of friends and like-minded gamers from around the world. We aspire to be extraordinary, to love our members as people as well as gamers, and to change the world around us. The gaming world knows our name, respects our reputation and our members wear our tag with pride and humility. We are large enough to have a server dominant and guild capped presence in multiple games, yet never so large that we forget our roots, never so large that we don't slow down and get to know our members as friends. We came for the gaming, but we stayed for the remarkable family we found.
---
**TENACIOUS IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT: CLASSIC**
---
If you‚Äôre looking for a guild of adult gamers that understand real life comes first, but doesn‚Äôt use that as an excuse to be mediocre gamers - look no further. Tenacious is pushing the limits of what people have come to expect from a casual guild.
---
Being a casual guild doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have goals, doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt care about progression, and doesn‚Äôt mean we do not try our best. It does mean that we won‚Äôt force a certain playstyle or skill requirements, because we understand real life obligations take priority. Because we welcome all kinds of players who want to have fun. Because your gear doesn‚Äôt define who you are as a friend, or as a guildmate.
---
**WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT**
---
Organized, involved leadership
---
Active discord and website
---
Active player base
---
Class mentorship
---
Community events
---
A friendly and welcoming group of friends to enjoy this wonderful game with
---
**Requirements:** Open Recruitment
---
**Raid times:** Mon/Fri 9 PM EST 
---
If any or all of this sounds like a good fit for you, check us out on our website &lt;https://www.tenaciousgamers.com/&gt; or Discord https://discord.gg/GBZkjVt
---
I eventually plan on PvPing on my paladin, so my professions are engineering and mining. Outside of farming ridiculous amounts of ore, how do I actually make profit off of this?
---
No I‚Äôm offended by yours. Smd
---
My first run of gnomer went pretty smooth.. probably had nothing to do with the 36 tank we had or anything
---
Each pull starts with Boris trying to chop the boss‚Äô head off, Boris forgets to block and gets one shotted, followed by another raid wipe.
---
They could balance classes by adding spell books that add new ranks to spells those classes use. Example, book of mind blast rank 10 or something that could come from some high end new content. Class is completely unaffected until later on. Just an idea
---
^^ He knows! This isn't a bug, this is how it was, and at the same time why it was changed. #nochanges though.
---
Well, we are still early levels, 13 and 15 and mages do have insane burstability early on.
---
Rofl.  Well, you weren't wrong.  Dude definitely sucked more than you.
---
ESO is far from dead
---
I mean, even if he did abuse layering reddit admins aren't the people doling out blizzard bans...
---
Most entitled? you mean the least played, most demanded ? Yeah I guess that gives tanks the right to choose who they want. Not our faults there is dozens of DPS available any moment we want to replace 1.
---
Tibia 4 life
---
Not when you take into account that it procs blackout. With blackout, it goes from one of the worst to one of the best in pvp.
---
I guess I just don't get why its called boomer if old people in general, from way before boomers did the back in my day bit. We should call them Grandpa Simpsons or something.
---
None of course, but it does exist, and someone may take it very late when the hunter spec shifts into Lightning Reflexes.
---
Highly server-dependent, of course.
---
I can get on my server about 5 to avoid the queue, and do basic things (craft or use the AH, travel to new zones to turn in/get quests, etc.) while also doing home chores and dinner. Then I actually start to play about 8. Seems to thin out after 9 for quests.
---
imagine being such a brainlet that you thought anyone would care about the struggles of a mage.
---
yeah, this is what I was going to suggest. Not sure if it'll work out the gate though, might have to do some type of sequence macro but idk, i'm no macro expert
---
uh... clearly the tank didn't have the skill/gear to multi tank at the rate the lock was generating threat. The lock didn't have the skill to avoid pulling agro. 
---
Doing things the "best" way doesn't work in a party setting unless everyone has the skill to pull it off.
---
One of us, one of us
---
Strength only affects melee AP, so its pretty worthless for hunters.
---
Well, i think people are angry about the heavy monetization of bonus exp and QoL items on rs3 which is aside from poll votes. Regardless Osrs is probably experiencing some refugees like we will if Retail ever fucks up that bad.
---
Imagine playing a fantasy game and wanting to play as a human like irl. Or a short one, or an even shorter one. Night elf‚Äôs aight
---
Are you serious?! Most servers are about 50 50 but then flamelash out here with 62% horde. God, no wonder horde is all I see. Just my luck
---
It's this.
---
Dude is instantly buying all the ones that are worth disenchanting. That's why the ones that haven't sold are so high, because they're priced above that threshold.
---
Check out what the shards sell for and you'll probably see where the threshold is.
---
Plus there will be inflation so gold won't be worth as much in the future. I mean, this guy has so much he's obviously fine for his gold needs going forward but it's something to think about for someone planning on hording a twink item or 2.
---
There‚Äôs an addon I think called kill tracker that I got for the same reason as yours being from OSRS! 
---
As for loot I haven‚Äôt found a good one for that yet so if you find something give me a shout!
---
Imma make a tank now brb
---
Basically this. You will hear people say that you can't raid as that spec, but they're speaking from a min/max standpoint. It will be fine for your average MC run. It's actually a super fun spec in PvP too. It will shine early on when everyone is in pre-Bis gear, but will fall off during T1 gear phase. It'll really shine after AQ comes out.
---
Follow these simple steps:
---
1. Get a Greater Magic Wand
---
2. Get a Greater Magic Wand
---
3. Get a Greater Magic Wand
---
Seriously, cannot be over emphasized how gamebreaking this wand is for the next several levels. Sell everything for this. Sell your bags if you have to. 
---
After this, you can MB/smite ‚Äî&gt; SWP ‚Äî&gt; PW:S/renew ‚Äî&gt; then wand until they are dead. You will have full or near full health at this point and pretty much full mana. 
---
First 5 pts in wand spec.
---
We have already seen these, but outside of Karazhan, all of these have been distorted by time and their use in an expansion. The Grim Batol dungeon we see in Cataclysm is not even close to how it would've been if it was made for Vanilla, as tons of changes were made to it for the purposes of making it fit the story of Cataclysm. Same with Uldum.
---
An even better example lies with Outland. There is concrete proof that its planned design for Vanilla (being more reminiscent of the design Outland had in Warcraft III) was completely different from what it turned into with TBC, as it transitioned from a zone made for a patch into a continent made for an expansion. We want Outland because we want to see and play through how the zone would have been in the developers' original vision. That goes for all the zones you mentioned...with the exception of one, it being Karazhan (I might as well lump Caverns of Time in as well, why not).
---
Karazhan and the two Caverns of Time dungeons were always intended to be part of Vanilla (Karazhan was planned to be the first raid of the whole game and the map files for Black Morass are still in the 1.12 game files), they were introduced close enough to the end of Vanilla that they could quite easily be passed off as Vanilla patch content that was just delayed for TBC, and people want to be able to play them without the baggage that the rest of TBC carries.
---
Ooh okay, yeah im not quite sure than to be honest, mine is just a straight weapon swap when I use it and it has been confirmed by other rogues as well that it works.
---
Ill try and find a more fluid macro than, for now I would recommend just an alternative weapon swap for In and out of stealth and just repurpose that macro as an Ambush/Pick Pocket macro --
---
I'll get back as soon as I figure things out :))
---
Troll priests are much better than Undead. Anyone who pretends otherwise is lying to themselves.
---
i did to mythic raid but i stepped down recently.
---
Get greater wand.  It's like 13 silver.  
---
With SW:P and wanding you should be doing only slightly less dps than your mage friend.
---
When you get to BFD level, get the quest wand from there.  
---
Anyway, you can go do RFC now, grab a couple of levels, then WC.  Healers can be a bit lower level wise so the disparity isn't a big deal.
---
I‚Äôll delete what I want you delete what you want seems kind of dumb imo from a mod perspective.
---
Uh, your logic is a bit flawed here. I get what you're trying to say but both instances are creating resources out of thin air. Perhaps better wording
---
im referring to your comment not your OP
---
tho i do see your edit now
---
I really wish blizzard would start chat banning people who use that add on that chats everyone around you and invites them every 5 minutes. Really annoying and kills the immersion.
---
I always think I should be leveling faster but after 50 it is such a slow grind holy shit
---
perhaps take some more data and put in a bug report? evidently some numbers haven't been accurate since beta&gt;release
---
LOL its reckoning build.  5 is max after a fix but in 1.0 you could stack infinitely and one shot raid bosses. Not hacking, he has to prep in between each of those bursts.
---
Tanking not in prot spec is completely viable until high levels. Is your position that him being spec'd prot might override these dumb decisions by dps and therefore it's actually his fault not the dumb actions of others?
---
And if that is your position, what do you make of the fact that if the dps followed these tips then prot spec is definitely not required?
---
To stretch what I believe is your argument just a bit further, you are effectively saying shadow priests who heal should stfu if dps keep yanking aggro unnecessarily - because hey, you're not spec'd holy so your opinion is invalid.
---
See how crazy that is?
---
You make money later in the game.  Right now the supply just heavily outweighs the demand.  Unless your ahead of the curve in it your items just won't sell, to much supply for the demand.  People elsewhere are also leveling it and providing them for free to friends etc just to clean bag space.
---
When the server ages and higher level materials begin seeing heavier competition for the harvest, and harder raids like AQ come along, the prices will soar compared to now.  
---
Part of the problem is 1.12 itemization and the early proxy raid nerfs from it.  The consumption just isn't there due to it.  BWL, AQ, Naxx will progressively drive demand higher.  The general hope is that more advanced game knowledge will increase the percentile of raiders versus the population of vanilla, and thus offset the accumulation time prior to release of these raids.
---
Right now, alchemy is going to suck balls for the most part as an earner.
---
Rektbomb
---
as sub rogue i can easily take down multiple mobs in a row without worrying about cc. fast daggers + hemo + ambush means half the time i kill a mob before my stealth is off cooldown
---
TFW your top posts on reddit are requests for mirrors in a porn subreddit.
---
I'd say the current big player mmo's are WoW, FF14, ESO, and then GW2 as a distant 4th. Oh how you have fallen GW2... I blame nexon.
---
There is no in game lore about animosity between night elves and dwarves.
---
Tanks are in super high demand, so they will pick and choose who they go with to maximize their dungeoning lol. Mines about to hit 30 and It‚Äôs nice being able to to pick what I want in my group .
---
Well idk, alliance are the bad guys in Firefly and I can‚Äôt disagree with captain Malcom Reynolds
---
It's that thing you have when you tank without a shield.
---
Meh. This is how I learn. Knowledge is worth downvotes. I should‚Äôve specced into protvotes
---
If you're primarily into PvP in WoW, then hall of heroes/GvG would compare very well.
---
Did you even read his whole post?
---
Untrue, that's retail horde.
---
You can be pretty efficent during the 2 hours queue on herod during week nights. smh
---
 I was a highwayman  
---
Along the coach roads I did ride
---
Yup, this fucker will chase you across the planet.  He is not programmed to tether or something.  One time I had to walk back to Kargath because he wouldn't let me mount despite being like 3 miles away.
---
Warr wpvp is horrible at low lvl, does it get better at 60 when geared?
---
But humans with swords or maxes and devilsaur should be better than edgemaster since they hit hit cap with them no? Edgemaster and racial should put them at what? +8 weapon skill?
---
Did you remember to put new ranks of spells on your action bars?
---
The ability to quickly sac a void and resummon is useful for leveling on a pvp realm.
---
Hallo. If you need any help with your english, feel free to ask me. Id be more than happy to edit or suggest grammar or vocabulary improvements.
---
I dunno man, I like the aesthetic, but they also seem the most militaristic.  The Ebonheart Pact certainly has internal conflict (ordinary Dunmer are just as racist as Altmer), but the faction understands struggling through adversity more than any other faction.
---
You don't really see the dark side of DC unless you're EP though - but man, when playing through like their various stories EP gets fucked HARD by DC.
---
The great human element of spamming trade chat(and lfg chat less often) "LFM SM GY" over and over, followed by "inv?".
---
Honestly there is little human element in the actual forming of the group and it's tedious and clogs up chat.
---
I think just being able to designate yourself or your group as LFG or LFM with what roles you could fill and having players do the rest, would be a perfect middle ground. Just something that replaces chat spam, keep everything else the same.
---
That's probably just reckoning.
---
Either Arathi or Desolace. Desolace has mad silk drops so if you need silk you'll have a good time questing there.
---
Wars don't spec prot before 50. It makes no sense to do so with respecs costing what they do.
---
Because Orcs and Undead can play more classes that get a broken racial?
---
I spam arena runs to get a chance at some pre raid Bid gear, not for the EXP... Not sure if anyone does arena for mainly EXP...
---
Did this with my buddy who was level 37 (and I was 32). Chain only took about 6 hours in total for the two of us. *Only....*
---
Razorfen Kraul.
---
Though that's no easier to get to
---
Heck yeah. Nice cozy set up with some doggos.
---
Tell your rogues to pickpocket all the mobs first.  Good advice on cheap shot, but for certain mob types its the only option.
---
If you're sitting down drinking/eating, then hit your aimshot key and have a 2h equipped (using Warmonger 2h sword atm) you'll stand up and starting the aimshot cast, hold the sword like a gun and looking down it as if it's got a scope. It's pretty incredible.
---
Fix this pls.
---
Guys I keep trying to report this bud my dummy thicc tauren as cheeks keep clapping and making it hard to report.
---
Just stop feeding the troll at this point. :( He can't be reasoned with. Just downvote and move on.
---
Me too! And because cannibalize helps me save money because i burn through food and bandages like nobodies business.. and also its hilarious.
---
god the circle jerk in here is ridiculous.
---
Do I need the scarlet key to get into the locked SM wings if someone in my party has it?
---
But what level is he?
---
Im using Classic to play Alliance for the first time, and I'm amazed how horseshit our Flight Paths are. Especially in Kalimdor. And why does the Night Elf zone connect to a level 25 area instead of having a nice convenient dock in Westfall?
---
its easy to have OG and SW as the most important cities, dont give the new cities an AH and it will always be that way. Blizzard realized this too and the latest expansions didnt have AH's in new cities and OG and SW remained the main cities.
---
Oh stop it, this makes too much sense.
---
This isn't how it works FYI and the post you're replying to explains clearly why.
---
I can respect that, I main a troll priest myself, and I do find them underrated, especially in pvp. Shadowguard and Blackout together is great, especially when you get +spell dmg gear. Hex of weakness can be used really effectively, especially if you don't have an arms warrior with mortal strike.
---
But to me, the low effort needed to effectively use fear ward, combined with it's relative high utility makes it hard to beat
---
You shot first.
---
Well deserved
---
Because our computers are way faster so you are doing something on your client that makes sense based on what you are seeing, but once it reaches the spell batch, then the server, then comes back, the outcome is completely different from what you would expect and most likely based other actions on. 
---
This is all assuming spell batching working exactly the same as it did in 2004 which I can guarantee you it does not since it's built in a version of the retail 8.0 game 
---
I don't claim to know all the details but I can guarantee you that Feign Death/Trap is WAY more unreliable than in Vanilla. It was a hunters go-to strategy to get the advantage in PVP and in Classic it's like impossible to pull off
---
Still relevant though because it's definitely a macro. 
---
When you're doing ticketsupport you're basically just using macros for 9/10 questions and since you have to meet targets you end up with people giving subpar support. 
---
Quantity&gt;quality in many companies.
---
Chatsupport isn't automatically better either though, it depends on how many chats you have to handle at the same time but whenever I had to handle more than 3 I was starting to mix things up.
---
Bloodhoof Target
---
&gt; But i still hold for a day where Prot Pally raiding is a thing. Or Crusader Strike comes back to make ret dps more conscious. OR Shadow Priest have some longevity on its rotation!
---
Exhibit A: why it is utterly imperative that we do not "vote" on Classic WoW changes.
---
Thes epeople are vandals.  They will not be happy until they've murdered Vanilla WoW for a second time.
---
And you aren't getting any chat bubbles from the armorsmith guy? Definitely sounds bugged. That totally sucks dude.
---
There will always be idiots calling "lol huntard" whenever you do anything wrong, there is not much to do about it as people are terrible unoriginal. But tbh. the biggest reason hunters are more known to make mistakes are because we got more shit going on, pet control, change aspect, a bigger rotation than most classes you need to keep track of food and arrows and position is way harder because of the dead range. But you can‚Äôt escape the elitist poopsockers that flame hunters for everything that goes wrong even if it were not your mistake, it's just easier for them that way.
---
When I get ticked about getting ganked or something, the lab will come and put her head in my lap.
---
1 item off pre-BiS with epic mount, idk what I could have been doing that would have been so productive 1-h from pulling in mc. I valued meeting and setting up a hopefully long term alchemy relationship that would benefit not only me but the other person for the foreseeable future.
---
Huehuehuehuebrbrbr
---
Hunters having growl up is not a bad thing. Unless whatever you are fighting has a cleave/breath attack (which is hardly anything), it actually is more efficient to let the pet tank the hits.
---
Use /equipslot 16 for MH and 17 for off hand
---
hemo/ambush is a billion times better then combat which is most garbage spec as a rogue. way faster, no downtime, you shouldnt ever die considering you have 2 sets of cds with prep.
---
I did this as druid. That rock the egg is on acts as line of sight. Easy egg grab and dash.
---
Feel you, but my excuses are school starting and a new job starting Monday. I‚Äôm running a disc priest. Been tough but after 30 you finally have some power to work with
---
holy shit you're clueless. wotf doesn't work against polymorph. it syops fear, charm, and sleep effects. and you're wrong about hardiness too, it's +25%. ask anyone who plays an orc and has tested it and they will confirm. idk why the most uninformed people like you insist on trying to educate others on shit you know nothing about.
---
I doubly like this post because the way you're supposed to deal with gankers and campers is getting people to help you. So if you put a call out in general and no one answers that call, they don't really get to talk.
---
Warcraft tavern has a horde only leveling guide and I like it. It seems to keep you focused and greatly reduced travel time
---
have you tried restarting your game? i know it sounds like it won't work but when i read of reports of this issue it did fix it for some people
---
I agree with the guild bank and a barebones dungeon finder. I'd also like either dual-spec or cheaper respec-ing, either have it decay faster or cap sooner.
---
Maybe even have full fledged elite zones where you're expected to group up to explore them.
---
In short, why do people want to see Karazhan and Caverns of Time? Because they're nostalgic places which people really want to see that were going to be in Vanilla in their current state if it weren't for TBC, and it would be very easy for Blizzard to add them into Vanilla in order to dip their toes into Classic+.
---
Why do people want to see places like Uldum, Grim Batol, Outland, or Quel'thalas in Classic+ despite them existing in Retail? Because their design for Retail is nowhere even close to how their design would have been in Vanilla, and we want to see their true versions, what they would be without the warped design methodology that Retail has.
---
Ehhh. If you choose to not get swallowed into the debate of how shit the story has become, and just accept the plot as it's given, then you learn that on the verge of death Vol'jin was manipulated into naming Sylvanas. Yeah, weaksauce shit, I agree. However, that's alleviates a good deal of culpability for him.
---
Thrall has no such excuse. He was a great leader, who made a damned stupid decision. A decision that ultimately the horde never recovered from. If Vol'jin had stayed alive longer, the horde might have fully recovered in time. But he didn't, so they didn't.
---
I get what you mean, I feel the same way when I find a PvP movie with heavy metal or that screaming stuff, I guess it's a matter of taste. I'll try to change up the musical style for the next one to something more in the middle (Linkin Park type). Thanks for the feedback!
---
undead are kinda against everyone and only reluctantly in the horde.  
---
It's why it's neutral honor to start with if you're anything but undead, and undead is neutral with everyone else.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Phase 2 is delayed because of this layering issue. They have said layering definitely will be gone before it starts and even the "low pop" realms have more people than would fit on the server without layering.
---
Whoever has the key can open it for you as long as you all enter at the same time AFAIK
---
I think the closes thing to "being able to anything about it" is a free action pot, but even that a Rogue has a "gazillion" answers too :)
---
‚Äûonly r13‚Äú my ass.   
---
everything above 10 is only doable if you either dont have a job, have no freetime activities outside of WoW or happen to be part of the best pvp group on your server.
---
The vast majority of my tanks have it. Most warriors start with dps gear because that's what they use to level with. If you sold it all when transitioning to tank then that's on you.
---
You should wear Alliance masks when you do this. False flag attacks!
---
That's not critique, it's a horrible attitude and toxic.
---
Shadow priests don't have 1000apm moments. They're an extremely strong 1v1 pvp class, but they're pretty straight forward and not very hard.  Still really fun though. 
---
Warlocks aren't as good in current phase, but as more gear tiers come out, warlocks will eventually pass shadow priests in pvp capability and even now they're still excellent.  They're more complicated and it takes a more nuanced approach to outplay your opponent.  
---
Both are awesome so can't go wrong.  I'd go with what class you're into more lore wise and looks/feel. They'll both be great for pvp.
---
Earthfury is nearly exactly 50/50 with a .5% to 1% difference in Horde's favor depending on time. Economy is growing. Just transferred off Herod and thankful for no queue. Great server!
---
I think I‚Äôll stick to the priest. I may end up healing PvP anyway haha
---
Is there a drop penalty for killing stuff thats a significant level lower than you?
---
No, that's not all all what that means. It's a strawman.
---
The point is not that there's a significant difference in how the most knowledgeable people performed. The differences is in how much closer the average person is to the most knowledgeable.
---
There's just more information out there now that's easier to obtain and easier to learn so the average player isn't as bad.
---
Staysafetv hust did a guide on his warlock, I think the run is pretty much the same. There is another guide out there but it‚Äôs a bit hard to find at the moment as I‚Äôm at work
---
https://i.imgur.com/F6OvlFq.gif
---
I‚Äôve been trying TSM for a week now for the same reason. Once you get all set up it‚Äôs very nice and much easier to use.
---
&gt; you're right my point is technically wrong and therefor has no bearing, but still, my point tho
---
???
---
I mean, at least the horde have their own battlecry.
---
Would you like to be an investor
---
Yeah, but atleast you save like a months usage of diapers.
---
have a test at 60 so people could actually bug test issues that could happen in endgame content?
---
Google barrens.chat tier armor sets I think there is a part on the website that shows tier armor sets on all different races/classes
---
Yes :P
---
&gt; Say what you will my friend. With the power on Hindsight we could make a Spiritual Successor to Retail
---
I bet you also think we should "try communism again".  Fucking simps never learn.
---
Alliance players are the nerds that have no friends in school, or they have their little group of misfits that no1 cares about. Prime example: Asmongold. Yes he got rich which changed his life but think about his life before streaming, that's how I imagine every Alliance player's life is.
---
I agree, a well timed growl when a stray mob is going for the healer is wonderfull. Having to spam taunt on a boss because of Growl is a pain in the butt and messes up my rage generation.
---
Yeh everyone a r1 glad
---
Wow Classic has classic rogues in the forums. I remember it well.
---
You can hate him all you like. He is an ass hole. But he is straight forward about it. He has a massive following because people like watching him and like his content. I don‚Äôt watch him religiously but I do watch some of his shit on YouTube. No need to be the Debby downer and all good sir,ma‚Äôm,thing
---
Yeah I think on almost all pvp servers, it's horde slightly in favored, with few exceptions of course.
---
I myself horde of &gt;10 years, played an alliance character during the AQ/Naxx era but didn't get to experience much of it as I was rushed pretty much through most things, (guild needed another druid and I was it!) so nice to actually get to spend the time this time.
---
Both are good, fun options.  You won't have trouble finding a group with either. Priest is a more dedicated caster, whereas paladin levels as a healer/melee hybrid.
---
Biggles?
---
Yeah the STV arena raptors are fantastic farming spot for 38-40. Probably the best tbh. Seems like raptors drop a lot of boe greens, and have a chance for thicc leather which sells for 1g+ a stack right now.
---
16s 5c? maybe?
---
Female orc is the best. Tried a male orc for hunter, and the dude just felt too buff for the class.
---
Don't forget that you can save a lot of mana with CC and mitigation. I'm not sure about classic, but Disc was insane in PVP as healer from TBC onwards. I could 1v1 basically anyone.
---
That the questions may look as if the WoW player has a bad reputation is unintentional and could arise from the topic of the questions.
---
I‚Äôm level 35 now. What I said seems to have applied since I‚Äôve been playing a Warrior. Killing slightly more than one mob per minute seems to be standard for melee DPS without using AoE strikes. I just say that because killing 4 mobs in 3 minutes with AoE strikes isn‚Äôt really that good, especially if it requires the use of a health pot.
---
You seem to be an expert at not cheating... can you prove what rules are being broken?
---
How do you check your server ratio? I‚Äôm on Thanos. I‚Äôm curious to see what it was pre- and post- the 'white flight'
---
Thank god those trashy people are gone though, they were CANCER, as they are in society
---
This is a widespread issue, that‚Äôs affecting a lot of people. I had it happen to be about a week ago. Logged out at my fishing spot to only log back in a while later to not be able to catch a single thing where I was just getting near 100% success rate. It‚Äôs been working fine for me now but I‚Äôm not sure what caused it or what fixed it so it could happen again.
---
Hahaha you RETAIL BABY! this is part of the game not a bug!
---
Take that brute hammer, thats a free 45 silver.
---
Why would we try a failed concept again?
---
Thats equal to saying, Lets just make Retail again. which is obviously not a good idea.
---
Are you seriously not trolling people right now? 3 months + 3 months - 1 month = 5 Months
---
Which one works for 1.12? Im a pleb still playing on a private server
---
That's not humble bragging. It's just bragging and that's okay.
---
I would be interested in hearing those basics.
---
I‚Äôll look into that too. Warlock still screaming in the back of my head at me though. Just worried with all the utility they have it‚Äôs a huge learning curve to ‚Äúbe good‚Äù in pvp
---
Lol qq more noob it‚Äôs not a bug. Part of the game
---
Was recruit a friend something that happened in vanjlla?
---
lmaoo thats way to go on pvp server. in desolace me and 2 other horde finished our kodo wrangling quest by killing alliance brining them back and stealing the kodo, let them do 90% of work and ill take reward
---
could be your chat settings and if it isn't that, it's just a bug.
---
What actually happened is /u/ClassicAzeroth started bawling his eyes out in general chat and someone said "PvP on PvP server".
---
and they master looted the item to themself? the ignore thing doesn't exist and chances are you just missed the notification, it's easy to miss it if there's any type of chat spam from loot or other channels. 
---
no exploit exists that i know of to change without notification
---
Oh yeah, I'm doing this all the time too. IF I'm able to unleash my WW before the mobs starts running away, it's solid. But that's not always the case.
---
How did you get the XP for 60 though? Questing? grinding? dungeons?
---
If you look at my original message, my whole point is that Overpower should be scarier than MS for you Rogues.
---
Sound like a retail baby who just reports every single thing üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I believe it's only effective against PvE targets. Tanking gear typically has other benefits such as block and parry.
---
Pamela Anderson reference?
---
I currently have it setup as a macro without a rank but it does not differentiate, it just tries to cast the highest rank which is where I see the error text appear.
---
ah, this was the low iq comment i was looking for
---
the game was designed around low aura/debuff count because of server limitations
---
removing the limitations now would require retuning basically the entire game
---
blizzard has said they don't want to retune the content
---
He's definitely confusing certain people getting unfair advantages with negatively affecting the economy as a whole. I originally agreed with the other guy but you're right. With open world layering, resources remain the same, however they may not be equally distributed. But that doesn't generate new resources out of thin air.
---
being good in PVP is always a huge learning curve. I'm sure there are videos and streamers out there though
---
I still made a valid point about Azshara and the Orcs and the Eradar were both turned to the burning legion from following their leaders who were corrupted themselves by the most powerful generals of said legion. An entire planet was manipulated by the 2nd biggest evil in the universe, it's not just cus "orcs dumb lol".
---
Good point I forgot about the gear issues like that. Maybe tweak it so you just can roll need on gear you can‚Äôt equip maybe. Would at least since the issue like hunters rolling on maces
---
What you want is Burning Crusade then.
---
Hahaha, I love this conversation.
---
I suppose it's possible, but I think it's more likely that you you played a salty rogue back then, too.
---
Imagine unironically playing as the queers
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjFXGWWOups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjFXGWWOups) (just the english one)
---
HAHAHHAHAHAHAH ''FOR THE ALLIAAAANCEEE'' holy shit you can't call yourself a man if you liked this. Alliance is for the female players and homos
---
Honestly as a top500 retail raider you just made me realize that the better guilds don't offer much more than the shit ones in classic. That's a really good point actually
---
Yah, just with life as a now adult it‚Äôs tough to invest the time to get good as well lol
---
Get RE+ and ban the term "Classic+" and "Classic Plus" in this subreddit.  Along with whatever other phrase you want.
---
Fair enough
---
Its ok every single piece of loot in every dungeon is hunter gear
---
I don't think so, the first BoE epic I found was on lower level enemies, though that's purely anecdotal.
---
There's definitely an XP penalty.
---
I also did this :) even took a flight to undercity bank to craft blinding powder. Socialising is against my role as a rogue
---
Horde usually outnumber alliance on pvp servers lol
---
Ahh not this again. No one will ever be convinced.
---
The mount is why you have kids in the first place...
---
Decisions decisions
---
As 100% of what everyone else says. Level up
---
AAP felt weird for me after awhile, right around level 25. It would take me to new places (STV) for like one or two quests and then immediately have me go to another zone. It felt really inefficient.
---
Maybe later it brings me back to those zones for the harder quests? Idk
---
Dont forget spikes. It's not a horde base if it doesnt have at least 500 wooden spikes.
---
^ Another example
---
From what I understood: Spriests are beasts in 1v1, but that's mainly it. You go oom really fast in BGs and other classes are better for BG.
---
You can sleep during maintenance of course!
---
WP. screw these casuals
---
Im horde like back in vanilla, and horde players defi itely tend to care a lot more about their faction than alliance.
---
Peoole who wanted us to roll alliance before classic releases: "dwarf is solid, and it would be nice to have pallies on our side. And I like their starter zones more"
---
People who picked horde: "No way in hell am I ever rolling fucking alliance, fuck that shit. Im rolling horde no matter what"
---
if its red its dead
---
&gt; Big Todd.
---
[Where my mind went](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohxq8ooQCHs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=602)
---
ok
---
I see, thanks.
---
I have a question about fishing: does fishing skill matter for catching specific fish like nightfin snapper? Or it doesn't matter if youre 200 fishing or 300 fishing youre always going to catch 30% of nightfin in ferralas.
---
i think the biggest concern would be splitting up the playerbase into too small of groups could be bad, but i think it would likely satisfy more people overall if say they want to be locked into wotlk.  though we have easily 2 years if classic already planned out with raid releases
---
Saw this the other day.. do you already have the ring? It is unique and won‚Äôt even allow you to roll on it. Seems like he master looted but he was the only one able to roll
---
Negative side effects != unintended, my dude. A negative side effect of chemo is that you lose your hair, but it's not unintended, it's going to happen by its nature
---
I think his Twitch name is PreparedWOW. I believe he has been multi boxing since at least MoP. Maybe even before that. He's got a unique voice. Plays lots of 80s rock on his steam.
---
no they have patience so they are the most dangerous players
---
Liar. Auction captures have 0 results for all servers.
---
Hmm I see, that makes sense... not super impactful amount of xp gain really but a nice little booster! thank you
---
I could not have said this better.
---
&gt; 1 person having a unfair advantage over another 
---
God, you must be a frustrated and sad individual. I hope for your sake that you never look outside.
---
I've heard they will be cross realm, but from what I've seen all of the PVP servers are majority horde. Unless they go and group up PVE servers with PVP servers then it's not going to be balanced anyway. I doubt they will mix them though since it's so much easier to farm gear on PVE servers.
---
The "proof in the pudding" to this difference is how Blizzard has responded to layering.
---
When it was shown how it can be disastrous to the economy via instances it was quickly rectified.
---
While they haven't even addressed layering in the open world as a problem to the economy at all beyond some players that take the time farming getting a slight advantage over the rest of us. Slight because layering is finite and not guaranteed to get you more resources.
---
as a world pvper i will only spare alliance if they have a funny name. otherwise they die.
---
Yeah right dude I bet he took every single piece of gear and then told everyone to go fuck themselves while simultaneously mind-controlling them into giving all of their gold and worldy possessions to him.
---
I cant think of another game where the 2 factions of players hate each other more than WoW. Its actually quite impressive, each side blames the other for petty bullshit and unfair advantages while at the same time doing the exact same. 
---
All I can think of is that spiderman meme where he points at himself.
---
You just said my point. If it means I get my mount at 40 why even bother buying the skills and being down 9g? 
---
Also not everyone is using TSM, you having enough gold is because of that.
---
Strange, I'm seeing constant LFM gnomers in trade chat for at least 2 weeks now.
---
no we do that cuz its funny and they picked wrong side
---
How is BFD easier for Alliance to get to...?
---
Stocks has literally no loot, and Horde can teleport to Gnomeregan for some reason. 
---
Deadmines is valid, but that's 1.
---
Sucks, but it happens. I don't blame someone who is the group leader kicking someone else because a IRL friend got on. I would only say it is bad etiquette if you are actually in the middle of the dungeon.
---
If you don't want it to happen, make your own groups.
---
Still a pain to fly from the very northern tip of the continent to fucking anywhere.
---
The warrior used intimdating shout which causes aggro. Given that the mage had not cause any other than proxy aggro it meant the warrior got higher and targeted. Also the spell he used was will of the forsaken to break the fear.
---
I don‚Äôt exactly know.. when i saw it, he was the only one to roll. Maybe everyone passed, but to be honest it seemed sketchy.  I‚Äôd say you could remove him from ignore :)
---
There was a ‚Äú4chan leak‚Äù that said wow is under a million subs or something like but it was so obvious fake.
---
WoW definitely lost subs over the years but we gotta keep in mind just how high their sub numbers were. Them being at 2 million would still be a huge sub loss but at the same time they‚Äôd still be at the top of sub based MMOs.
---
That is painfully accurate!
---
i am comin for your head dirty imp!
---
I will write the paper in my native language German, but it was an advantage to create an English survey, because I can reach more people with it.
---
But thank you for your offer and stay so with your attitude, because in my opinion there will be less and less of your kind.
---
True. Obviously retreat was the best option but it's not in a lot of people's playbook.
---
How is more responsibility good news???
---
My friend got home and he's like we can finally play wow buddy! And then I'm like bruh i got a party and I just got done walking to deadmines from darkshore and they waited for me. 
---
He was like, I understand friend do what u gotta do
---
imagine not being able to handle wpvp as a rogue
---
I'm pretty sure you can do an if statement in your macro. If target level &gt; x cast rank 1 if target level  &gt; y cast rank 2 etc.
---
Confirmed, Alliance are the bad guys.
---
Just. dont. move.
---
We still have a ways before any of this is decided and before Naxx is even released! That gives the devs time to figure out their direction with Classic AND, at the very least, balance the Naxx gear accordingly. Whether they stick to "You'll get everything the same including bugs" statement or not will be important here..
---
Not sure if genuis or Xfinity shill
---
I've got people that prefer it being shared and people that doesn't. I'll try to make the best of both but it might take some time because reordering and tabs comes first.
---
But there's a plan to make a shared list and a character list
---
Huh. I was just fishing in feralas and did not run into this. Hopefully i don't now that I mentioned it lol.
---
Bwahaha
---
We have all devolved back in to 12 year olds I see. Quick someone tell me How shit ps3 is compared ro Xbox 360 then we can have a true battle of the spergs.
---
For those with Raptor mounts:
---
Is the screen still shaking when you ride them or was that fixed by 1.12?
---
Lol the pain in this writing is real.
---
All these comments are correct up to lvl60, raiding is a different priority list, but for now, more agility is better. You shouldn‚Äôt care what your melee dps is, use whatever gives you more agl. If you can get more through dual-wielding, then go for it, but if a 2-handed comes along that‚Äôs has more AP or agility than both 1-handlers, then go with the 2H.
---
For the record, you could have just line of sighted them and looted it without ever getting into combat
---
Yesterday a random passerby priest ressed my dead pet for me while I was sitting around drinking melon juice trying to get some mana. I wasn‚Äôt sure at first if I was happy or insulted but I settled on happy, especially when they put a fortitude on my pet afterwards. Thanks!
---
I haven‚Äôt encountered this error at all and have actually had the appropriate rank be cast on targets that were low level, without grabbing a different rank or using a macro.
---
How to tell of an item is a hunter item
---
Does it have agility? Then it's a hunter item.
---
And then our Ascension to godhood at 60.
---
You mean like the forge sitting right next to the weapon trainer under the huge arch?
---
I kill allies if I can. I don‚Äôt attack greys or low greens but a few levels from me I will. I‚Äôm a warrior and I need to practice before phase 2.
---
That voice!
---
and you bought it from where? digital? physical?
---
I have a priest at 55. I'm trying to figure out what alt I want to make first.
---
Mage seems like the obvious choice for gold farming and maybe PvP. 
---
However, I also want to try tanking as a paladin. But, I don't think that's really viable outside of dungeons. 
---
My main big needs are money making and pvp. I don't really want to farm stuff as a priest. I also leveled as holy and either holy isnt great at pvp or I'm just bad. I'm open to suggestions if anyone has any.
---
I believe this is correct, you won't see the roll, just that they loot the item. it's caused confusion from myself when I had a unique boss loot item that I never saw a roll for.
---
Gotta love Rick and Morty references!
---
I didn't know the Horde had their feelings hurt so easily
---
Sensitive af I see.
---
Get necrosis add-on.
---
Shadowguard should benefit from +shadow and +spell damage
---
Wands do not benefit from +shadow, but do benefit from the Warlock curses Shadow and of the Elements. Similarly a shadow wand should benefit from Shadow Weaving, but will not apply the effect.
---
Yeah, literally triggered em last night with 3 shamans in the group lol. Get your totems out of the hallway!
---
Lol this damn quest! I ended up dying next to the egg and then a group of horde care in and killed the mobs around it. Once they started walking away I res‚Äôd and snatched it, then hearthed. F that place. F that egg.
---
Horde
---
Raptors are springy
---
Wolf is like being glued to it and you have to sit at a 90degree angle all the time
---
Kodos are like a ferd f 150
---
Undead horses are smelly
---
Alliance
---
Cats are like a riding a chopper
---
Mech rider is exclusive and uses green tech
---
Rams, that is all
---
Horses are smelly
---
They basically put him in his cousins body
---
Unless you have time to spend 30 mins every time something drops arguing about what the value and who deserves something than all need is far better.
---
In your example OP - what if a pvp priest say they 'need' it, or a flag running druid? They will both get far more use out of it than a pve mage who it's *bis* for.
---
I know that you don't think Hunters should use the Scarlet gear, but that doesn't change the fact that there are and that I have seen Hunters with the Scarlet gear. I still don't understand why you're arguing about this.
---
Dear lord it's hideous
---
Who do you think might defend the abuse of layering? Think about it.
---
OSRS!
---
FFXIV doesn't increase the size of NPCs and it's a perfectly great game with no complaints about not being able to click them lol
---
Warriors are definitely viable if you don't raid. They have an incredible kit, deal great damage, and are useful at every level and in every activity. They're great PvP damage dealers, and amazing dungeoneering tanks from level 1 all the way through to level 60. And don't worry about the gear issue, every group needs a tank and there is are **lot** of groups. You'll always be able to find a group, **especially** if you aren't raiding.
---
When leveling a priest and healing in dungeons should I be using more instant heals or HOTs? I've never healed a dungeon before so just wanting to ask beforehand.
---
The original comment has no such implication. You're making that up or putting words in their mouth.
---
It clearly states that if you get aggro from the tank it's your fault. No qualifier, no wait 3 Sunders, nothing. If you rip it then it's 100% the fault of dps every time.
---
I say no way Jose, most tanks are just shit. Which is backed up by the 30% of tanks who are out there clappin cheeks.
---
Totes original.
---
&gt; Give the horde a reputation grind mount like the wintersaber.
---
Why? Why not have differences in the factions?
---
Don‚Äôt need effort to whoop your tryhard ass ;)
---
Eso only seems to get better and bring in more people with each expansion/update
---
Also the quest logs are actually usually fairly well written flavor text that organically inform you where to go/ what to do. Reading up on the lore for why the Defias Brotherhood is leading a revolt/riot in Westfall or why there's worgens in Duskwood is actually really interesting.
---
I have only rare encounters with mounted alliance and I figured its because they're already moving quickly, and having to remount takes awhile lol
---
Yep it happens.  I typically run with a full group of irl friends. We invited some random dps to join us on a run. A minute later our 5th logged on.  So we let him know the deal.
---
If we had already been heading to the dungeon I wouldn't have done it. But we haven't even left IF yet. Since he was a good sport about it  We got the guy in a group with is the following day and did a few sm runs with him.
---
imps in particular can't be attacked until they start attacking because of [phase shift](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=4511/phase-shift#taught-by-item)
---
No matter what class you play, you'll always miss out on end game gear if you refuse to raid.
---
who will heal in armory if all the drops are for warriors?
---
The live support is great.  The ticket system usually gets bogged down for awhile after launch with the tens of thousands of reports.  So it can suffer quality sometimes.
---
Proud of you mage brother
---
You forgot, "ALLIANCE ARE RACISTS! REEEEE"
---
Isn't arena net owned by Ncsoft?
---
Do you enjoy tanking ? If you don't, don't be a warrior.
---
Regarding rogues and their need for gear to PvP, watch the 'World of Roguecraft' videos ...
---
no lol. warriors are one of the strongest pvp classes in the game, you can survive with just pvp and dungeon gear. 
---
rogues can do well with no gear, rtzs was a guild in vanilla and they were noted for killing marshall / grand marshall warriors with no gear / grey gear.
---
Warlocks shouldn't be tapping to 1hp and full mana, but keeping a nice equilibrium. THAT BEING SAID, if two locks in the group are hellfiring, it sounds like you're in an aoe farm group, in which case this is 100% on you.
---
dude the amount of people proving this guys point in the comments makes me a bit sad...
---
My portfolio has been fairly Druid-heavy, and I've been looking to diversify.
---
Hell yeah, thank you
---
The issue is the world bosses. Those might be a nightmare on a server with three or more layers. At least as the layers and permissive attitude about abusing them out in the world are right now. Blizz could try to make the layers harder to cross but the cooldown idea they are using now wouldn't get it done. Even if you expanded the cooldown to seven days then players could still fight for an extra world boss kills every week. 
---
I think Blizzard will hold off for a bit because just throwing people into massive queues on the mega-servers is could make nearly as many quit as take a free transfer. There are already more servers than they originally estimated they would need long term so they are unlikely to open new ones. 
---
My guess is that they will wait a bit to make it look good then swallow their pride and start Phase 2 without changing anything. Just threatening to ban players who they catch abusing layers for extra world boss kills.
---
And the award for the most cringy guild advertisement goes to...
---
Ohh okay I was wondering what this secret spell was xD Thanks for the info. 
---
I'm still curious how that mage manage to get me killed with his mobs.
---
Heh. All *your* mobs. Ain‚Äôt yours til you tap em.
---
I know what hes saying which is why I mentioned monopolies and why Blizzard has stated they are watching constantly to ensure no one is gaining too much of an advantage through abuse of layering in the open world for gathering purposes
---
I'm the other guy. AD is better.
---
Nah, it's more like :
---
The gauntlets have 5str 3 stam and these other higher level gauntlets have 2str 2stam 9spi and 20% more armor.  You keep the 5str gauntlets despite the higher overall stats on that other item - literally minimizing your stats to improve one.  
---
In RPG stat point buy systems to buy higher stats it costs gradually more points for each stat, so you end up minimizing overall stats to max your ideal stats.  There are often other mechanics like traits where you can choose a negative trait for a positive side effect.  Taking what would be handicaps from a holistic sense for a very specialized bonus, a trade off only worth it because its a game.
---
Literally everyone minmax's at some point in modern gaming.  It became a term because in earlier pnp game systems there was often randomized systems for stats/traits so when systems came out for stronger customization at character creation the munchkin/minmaxer presence was noticeably different from players just trying to create an interesting character.
---
I first heard Big Iron on Fallout New Vegas and found the album on youtube, and listened to it ironically. Now I genuinely enjoy it
---
This doesn't happen.
---
Class utility is important in vanilla.

this is always the case with a "low effort content will be removed" rule

Gave it to a guildie.

Paladins?

I thought fishing skill only impacted if they got away or not --

Thanks =) been driving me crazy trying to figure it out xD now I know it was the warriors fault

Hunters

if it's a boe, everyone is allowed to roll need. i don't care if it's someone's pre raid bis, it's a boe.
---
They're mostly used to "unlock" profession progression. One of the enchanter rods and a couple blacksmithing recipes for armor/weaponsmithing, specifically
---
90% of the time if a dps dies, they'll probably die again. If they manage to solo/2 man the remainders you better hope there's a res still alive, otherwise you might as well have wiped. SS the healer has always been our go to, it saves a ton of time after a wipe.
---
I love this meme template. Not a terrible use of it here.
---
Nah mate PvP all the way. Love a good challenge
---
Retail and Classic are different games. He sent a response for 1 game not the other when he had all the information needed. Were you dropped as a child or did someone hurt you later in life?  Its obvious that those arent tailored responses and it's  also glaringly obvious you didnt read the original post. I would say I hope you dont work in customer service, but working the register at Mc Donalds does count as customer service.
---
He just gave healer gear to a ret paladin for pvp.
---
 lowest of the lowest
---
As a Warlock, I always feel guilty when I spam life tap, but eating is just much quicker than drinking. At around level 34 it would take me so long to fill my mana pool by drinking(One whole water will not do it), but no time at all to eat my smaller health pool up. 
---
Even in combat, if the healer is not renewing me or whatnot, I will just focus my dps in a way to make sure I stay at decent HP. If a Warlock does not have aggro, maybe throw them a HOT, but do not stress your mana for them. I will say, if you get me full health and I am not full mana; I will always life tap once as to not waste my HP regen from my Demon armor and Siphon/Drain Life.
---
Succubus. Drain tanking is most efficient and that doesn't rely on a pet keeping threat as you basically face tank everything.
---
Yeah, I agree. I was just trying to clarify your comment.
---
What was the post?
---
Monopolies do not effect economies whatsoever - you
---
We aren't getting p2 until after blizzcon 100%. And it's not gonna release instantly after blizzcon.
---
Honestly it's the same with most herbs and gatherables too.
---
Most of them go on the AH for just barely above vendor sell price.
---
The other day I finally got 60 just before doing this boss. Everyone else was already 60 and were waiting on me pretty much. So it was a joyous moment. Feeling pretty good the tank is like, alright let's fight the postmaster. Next thing we know he just says "LMAO IS POSTY MALOWN" but laughter turns to shock as this postman kills 1 and another. Malown here starts steam rollin. As each person dies he shouts, "You've just been MALOWNED!". We were all dieing laughing. Best 60 I've ever experienced.
---
Oh, just checked and not really.
---
Warriors with first aid.
---
He just gave lawbringer helm to a ret paladin for pvp. 
---
lowest of the lowest
---
Is there much competition in farming this?
---
Lol cause that's the equivalent of steam
---
It's a volume issue. It doesnt really serve the sub to be flooded with half hearted memes. Also, a lot of them aren't funny or are repeats.
---

Priest, but you might find it a little too familiar to warlock since their offensive style is similar. Druids make fine healers and you can also try out some tanking

Thank You! This is the first intelligent, respectful discussion I've had on this sub in a LONG time!

A guy can dream though ...

probably because memes are low effort and can easily spam the subreddit of shit content. it's what ruins main game subreddits and people are forced to use alternative 'niche' subreddits.
---
Am Horde. Loled at this. Guess I'm at the right faction :(
---
For other's doing the same thing, you don't need to do all of that. 
---
Simply distract them so they stop moving and get on the opposite side of the egg to them. The little mound the egg sits on LOS them and they don't aggro. I believe it can also be done without distract for non rogues, just Rez and loot but the timing on that is much tighter because eventually they path around and see you.

Swiftness potions will be hot for flag runners when WSG comes out. The recipe is only selling for 30s right now on the AH but it will probably go for 5 gold when battlegrounds go live

Interesting, I've got it set with a shift modifier so I can cast MotW and thorns with the same button. Seems maybe the magic differentiating is just baked into the default spell. Will give it a try, thanks!
---
Even though DPS is normalized in each pet family, faster AS is a slight advantage for BM because Frenzy will proc more often. I think for 1.2 AS and faster, only 4/5 Frenzy is necessary for almost constant Frenzy up time.  
---
So Broken Tooth Will have slightly better DPS than other slower Cats. BT's fast attack speed is mainly for PVP because of Spell push back.  
---
Cats are still very good PVE pets, I'm planning on using BT for leveling.  
---
But Cat, Owl, Wolf, Raptor are all good for PVE.  
---
You can search best hunter pets on reddit and see what other people's opinions are.  
---
My end game goals are Broken Tooth (Cat), Deathmaw (Wolf), and maybe Son of Hakkar (Wind Serpent)  
---
Look at Petopia if you haven't already. Good resource for hunters on Pet information. Which pets have fastest AS and where to get them.

I keep my eye on them and toss them a renew or flash heal if it‚Äôs stressing me out too much. They have the tools to heal themselves but I don‚Äôt want to miss out on their DPS if they get randomly slapped by an odd mob.

Problem with levelling a pally is you will end up healing at the endgame and you already have a priest.

If you got the killing blow, he wouldn't have taken durability damage. You might have saved him money

Sell raid consumables. I'd recommend: major mana potions, fire resistance potions, armor potions, elixir of the mongoose. I think these are . You can also sell arcanite transmutes.
---
In classic professions have a lot of recipes that drop from the world or dungeons. You might want to try collecting some of the recipes you really want.

You take the Rig Wars quest in the engineering shop in Orgrimmar (that awards Triprunner Dungarees for killing Mekgineer) and turn around and another goblin gives you the quest to go to Booty Bay. Teleporter is outside the Booty Bay inn.

Omg The Print Screen police strikes again. Sorry, I don't use reddit on my PC and no art is intended  here. Sorry to be a bad humain being.
---
Yup. I distinctly recall my guild grinding away to Ragnaros for weeks, only to get two Pally legs drop. Our first T2 (excluding Onyxia), and we literally had to DE it. About 10 tickets went in to support that night lol.
---
Differences feel good when it has nothing to do with unfinished content. Having additional content in the form of a deterministic reward of a mount feels good. Differences for the sake of being different when gameplay suffers is bad design: you want to design with a purpose. Giving horde players additional gameplay and options when it comes to their characters agency in how they want to spend their time at 60 is something that would help make Vanilla the game it should be. Again, treating this like a ‚Äúgive paladins to the horde ‚Äú is missing the point. If you read WoW diary you will realize how much cut content there is and that horde had so much less development time than alliance.

Hey look at this guy, having friends and shit
---
That's a bummer. I guess I should consider alliance, or RP PvP. When BGs pop, fast queues would be nice. I've heard horror stories about wait times on dominating factions. And if they have Cross Realm battlegroups, horde may always be waiting.
---
Resto Shamans are usually in very high demand. It's also one of the harder classes to play in the game so good ones really stand out.
---
Lol wow with the down voters. Must be an alliance heavy thread. I always heard that kids play alliance, I have never once seen anything correlating to horde having a younger player base, this is news to me. The story always was the middle aged and up players and kids want to be the "good guy" alliance.
---
This ^^
---
idiot detected.
---
Two things, don't pre-HoT on multiple mob pulls, you'll probably pull initial aggro. Also don't pre-shield, since that will impact the tank's rage generation.
---
Unfortunately I'm not that familiar with vanilla healing so hopefully somebody with more experience can chime in.

50/50. Either it happens or it doesn‚Äôt.

It may be an add on I have doing it but I don‚Äôt think so. I can double check when I get home.

He's got charisma. Noncharismatic people hate people with charisma. Don't worry, we know what your problem with him is without you saying it.

It's still good xp if you want to farm it back to back when you are too high for lib, and too low for cath.

He edited his comment
---
Sylvanas is a bitch. I hope bain or thrall becomes the next warchief.
---
I get you, but his issue isn't so much that he's being called a ninja, but that he's auto looting when he wants to share.
---
I agree that it's really up to the rogue though, although the locked chest item I think should be rolled on.
---
Hmm if only there was like a voting system in place or something on Reddit to let the community decide what is worthy or not...
---
If it is a BoE worth 5 gold on the AH its fine to all roll need. Whatever class needs it can just buy it off the AH for 5 gold.
---
BoP is entirely different.
---
Wack knows then my fishing works fine
---
If it‚Äôs a raid run by a guild, then BOE epics (these do exist even in MC and other raids) would go to whoever wins under your guild‚Äôs looting rules. If it is a PUG raid, again the raid should have looting rules. 
---
If it‚Äôs a pug dungeon run, and a BOE drops that has high AH value, everyone is going to roll on it. The BOE drops are not generally boss drops. And world drop BOE‚Äôs like the freezing band are a shit show. Anyone can roll need on it.
---
It's possible. But if people keep talking about it, the possibility of getting what we want increases.
---
The idea has nestled into people's minds by now, and the more we push for it before they make a final decision, the more likely we are to see a future where it becomes reality.
---
Yeah, Horde have plenty to compensate - vastly better racials, vastly better town and flight path locations (and more of them), Zeppelins, an earlier dungeon, etc. etc. Moonwell locations are hardly an impact relative to those.

Yesterday I got booted from a group. Heres my little sob story.
---
While grinding for 7 hours, every 2 mins or so i'll say something like "level 44 rogue LFG for ZF". No big deal im farming but I really want that helm off the final boss.
---
Finally, 7 hours later, I get into a group. Well I hearth all the way back to my inn, as it was close to ZF, take a flightpath to tanaris then run over the ZF.
---
I get in the instance. First one there. Then after waiting 20 more mins for a tank, everyone finally arrives.
---
Just right before we start another rogue says in /1 chat "47 rogue LFG for ZF". I get a message saying "hey that other rogue is higher level so were gonna go with him".
---
They kick me. I can't even hearth back.
---
Yea I was pissed. Still am. People that do things like this are trash. Wasn't even a IRL friend, just a random person.
---
There is still silvermoon city so it wont be as cleanly separated. Exodar at least is in an island further away plus its a space ship too

lmao! you have got to be shitting me man. Plenty of more charismatic people that aren't neckbeards on the internet and act like dicks to people to make their epeen feel better. Please get real
---
Orc will be better at PvP. I don't know that NElves really have any advantages as warriors, but the most important advantage you can have is enjoying the character. If you don't care, play Orc. But if the model will help you play more, go for NElf.
---
Seriously, I LOVE Skullcano. That was the last boss where you were constantly rotating around him right? I wish dungeons in that game weren't designed in such a way where if you wiped, it wasn't worth finishing the run because you wouldn't get Gold on it. Damn shame.
---
That guy with the hamster wheel on his head is obviously a gnome using the pinnacle of gnomish engineering

That's a fine strawman, sir.  Don't knock it over too hard.
---
Exploitation of any type for any purpose is actionable.
---
Too many .... Dots
---
Yeah the weird thing for me is, I'm just a far bars away from 43, and somehow I feel it within myself that I should probably slow down a little. I've got my mount(finally) and it was a personal milestone for me that maybe it's not for others, but it was one all the same.
---
I made this walk the other day with a friend
---
I was in a group that almost kicked a lvl 19 warlock because he couldn't summon the lazy party leader. Sure, class utility is important but some people think they know more than they do and their ignorance only punish other people.
---
What does that make?
---
1) You should always get the new rank pet abilities when you can. Most towns will have a stable master in your leveling area. Taming the pet and using it to grind a couple mobs to learn the ability doesn't take very long. Look on Classic Petopia on which mobs teach you the higher rank Claw, Bite, etc.  
---
This belongs in classicwow+
---
People doing the quest
---
Classic, in my mind, is very much about enjoying the journey as you see it, whether making 5 alts to explore sunsets in every level 30 zone or rushing to 60 and farming fire resist gear to show rag who's boss. Follow your heart.
---
Remove it, IMO.  I've never seen a server go up in flames.  Should be interesting.
---
Thanks!\~  It was the Crystal Charge you get from turning in 10 Red and Yellow Power Crystals you find throughout Un'Goro, into the North Pylon! They're a bit stronger than dense dynamite, so good aoe that's easy to farm!
---
Can you sell me/explain hemo to me? It only doing an extra 5 damage person attack seems... weak.
---
This is probably really stupid but. How does /4 common chat work? I understand the opposite faction can see your chat. I've had one person say something and it came through as what he said. But trying to talk to someone else, it came across as gibberish. Tried to Google and it wasn't giving me anything. Definitely wasn't another language. Is common coded/encrypted (or whatever)? I'm just a little confused. Also I've seen people say /4 is LFG chat but for me it's common. Insight needed, please and thank you!
---
Zygor!!!
---
I just hit level 40 on my mage and want to respec to AoE but I've never done it and the class is fairly new to me. Does anyone follow any specific guide for talent build or a general how-to? Apparently you're supposed to kill mobs that are green.. is that right?
---
Excuse my ignorance, but how does using 1 potion instead of 2 potions make any difference in your damage?

---
It's not just the high pop servers. As far as I'm aware, all servers have more than 1 layer at this stage.
---
I'm sure it was the opposite the first time around in vanilla and BC; younger players went alliance cause they're more standard fantasy races and horde were primarily 30something nerds
---
And if you look at something like crushing blows: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview
---
&gt; (for percentage): ((Attacker weapon Skill - Defender defence skill)*2)-15
---
I don't believe in pvp you can ever be a victim of a crushing blow, only crits.
---
Resilience was added in TBC exactly for this reason, to lessen critical hits against you, and eventually added in reducing dot damage as well.
---
"For the Alliance" was originally from WC2, the Horde didn't start using their battlecry til WC3.
---
As per usual, the Horde can't think of anything original.
---
Depends on your server. Ghost mushrooms are valuable on big servers .
---
Scarlet Monastary and Shadow Fang Keep.  They don't camp the others because they aren't safe spaces for them.
---
One mob, then you have to reposition every 5 seconds
---
It‚Äôs not a tip if you require it to provide the service. It‚Äôs a fee.
---
From your description the fee you are charging is for your time and the exclusivity of your recipe, not for materials. If you are the only one who has it, you can charge whatever you want without worrying about competition, but if your fee is too high you may miss out on some sales, and you may upset some potential customers. If your fee is too low you miss out on profits.
---
How many people do you expect to sell to at 100g?
---
Would you make more sales in volume if you lowered it to 50g?
---
No cherry picking. PvP means you will take a 60 owning you at 60 and a 60 owning you when youre 30...you just dont get to pick
---
Level is just a number, baby.
---
This mage is killing everyone in Gadgetzan-Faerlina and the guards can't do anything about it.

tell that to the melee that have to figure out if the combo of str and agi is greater than the weapon damage.

&gt;	I had to gear/spec/figure rotations for my wife's rogue since she couldn't be bothered, and she always seemed to end up top damage without constantly pulling agro so I think I know what I'm talking about here.

Rogue in classic is legit 1 spec, whole lot of work you did there lmao. 
---
You are legitimately proving my point that you don‚Äôt know wtf you‚Äôre talking about. 
---
&gt;	better than a cheap shot that will end with a mob in your face and a tank with no agro.
---
If you really lose hate to a 3 second stun you need to get better. There‚Äôs no other thing to say about that at this point. Either you‚Äôre talking completely out of your ass because you‚Äôre upset or something or you‚Äôre legitimately awful at this game.
---
Not releasing any sort of large new content in years will do that...almost as if WoW also suffered when they did that too
---
You don‚Äôt need to keep everyone at 100% health, as long as they‚Äôd overlooked 75% you‚Äôre fine.  You can shield paladins as they generate threat by holy damage and a lot of this comes from their seals/conc, warriors and Druid‚Äôs please don‚Äôt shield, squishes shield away! 
---
Don‚Äôt pre-heal(healing before they take damage) 
---
Just run dungeons and heal! You‚Äôll get the hang of it! It‚Äôs not as daunting as it seems!
---
Went for priest but grew tired of never feeling the impact of new gear. Rerolled warrior for that reason but realized it was quite... awful. Will priest "feel" the upgrades anytime soon (lvl 30 now) because I like the class but it's just boring to never feel more powerful after having grinded out gear from dungeons?
---
Thanks
---
I just did this tonight and she was damaged and it still succeded, she just cant die before emp. Not sure about the likt thing though, sounds wierd.
---
The problem then is hunters get priority on BoEs, too.  Makes it even easier for them to ninja stuff.
---
I had it happen in some questing groups :/

It's true, cannibalize is a pvp taunt that also heals you. How broken is that?

Get an enchanter to make a lesser magic wand for you. Use that after your dots. Also keep you wand as powerful as you can while leveling. Go shadow for less down time and more killing. Go disc or holy once level 50 or so.
---
BIB?  
---
Also, welcome to RNG hell.  I used the Crescent Staff from WC I got at 20 until I was 42 or 43.
---
You literally won't be able to until you're far above their level. Pet won't matter.
---
Just normal elite trash mobs in dungeons are going to demolish your pet. Nevermind bosses.
---
You need 8 of each of these, plus 8 liferoot and 30 troll tusks to complete the Cyclonian questline. It's warrior only and gives you the BIS 2h weapon for that level, at least up until SM. 
---
You can get it at level 30 but the guys that drop these are elementals level 38/39 so this will enable the guy to get his axe early.
---
You‚Äôre not meant to solo dungeons at their level. You have to be way over leveled to start soloing them.

Sargeras was literally in Medivhs soul from the time of conception.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing.
---
Well then what do you suggest a combat sword spec rogue does aside from not bank in the first place lol? As combat spec while leveling, without improved sprint, your literal only hope is possibly getting a few seconds of stun in.
---
3. They added a cool down on layer hopping so it's no longer a good way to find Broken Tooth. You can swap layers once to check the spawns again. Also don't run around to check the different spawns. Use Eagle Eye to vision the 3 places where he spawns and use a macro (/target Broken Tooth) or use track beast and look at your minimap.  
---
Theres a tall rock by the graveyard in the middle of the 3 BT spawns. There were people usually stand to eagle eye and check the three spawns.
---
No, hes saying mobs with frontal cleave attacks are doing damage in a full circle around them.
---
Found the try hard
---
That has always been possible. That was apart of vanilla. So I hope they don't ban that
---
I meant they're a pretty race that ride along the bad ass appeal of the horde. 
---
Which appeals to people who only played alliance because they have the prettier races.
---
The players can ress far from him and run away. If he's stationary on there it's your own choice to get killed over and over. Not going to get banned for that.
---
I guess I've only encountered newb Rogues then because they are easily the easiest class for me to beat on my 38 War. Especially if I switch to 1h/shield, they just tickle me while I keep them snared with Rend and Overpowers. Don't even have MS yet.
---
Which class would be best for a braindead slob like me?
---
I realize all classes are different and bring their own thing to the table but I'm really shit at videogames.. in retail I play a Protection Paladin tank and god forbid you get into queues with me cuz I've no idea what I'm doing.. I mash my keys and hope for the best.
---
I think in Classic I'd go for a DPS so.. what would match my "style"?
---
Horde has a really OP gank spot that Alliance has no counterpart too. Menethil Harbor is a sick spot for horde
---
&gt;Well hopefully they all DIAF.
---
You seem reasonable.
---
That makes no sense man ahaha you can pick once you‚Äôre 60 to not kill low levels and go to 60 areas to gain a higher skill in PvP
---
That they copied from the Alliance.
---
I was just about post the same thing. I found just about all the 1-handed swords on the AH are Main Hand only which is a real kick in the pants with Wingblade, and a slow hard hitting sword like Outlaw Sabre. Every I read says to go dual swords for leveling, but that isn't really an easy option at the moment if you want to rock Outlaw in the MH.
---
Lvl 26 rogue horde, looking for ideas on the next OH weapon to go for.
---
I get the high end dmg weapon MH for Sinister Strikes but I thought I'd read the fast OH for poison application was a myth?
---
I don't get this, if the groups full the groups full. Leave and reform if you wanna play with your buddy. That really sucks, OP, hope you have better luck in later dungeons! As far as having summon, train when you can, naturally, but you shouldn't be booted just because you don't have it trained. :P
---
I would go into SM for a level.  Other than that, I would clean up the higher level quests in Thousand Needles and Shimmering Flats, that should put you at at least 36 after the level from Scarlet Monestary and you should head straight to Desolace for 2 levels to 38.  Then you should be good to clean up STV and Arathi which would easily put you at 40 if you mix in a Scarlet Monestary between zone switches.  
---
At 40 you can definitely do quests in Dustwallow Marsh, Swamp of Sorrows, and after those move to Badlands.  Then you have Feralas, Tanaris, Hinterlands, Searing Gorge, and all the other zones in the game.
---
??? No, the equip bonuses do not count as helpful auras atm, they count as passive auras and do not push off buffs. The bug they're fixing (along with two other) is that enchants count as helpful auras, and can push off buffs. But this was not why people were missing attacks, they were missing attacks because of a bug with set bonus auras overwriting other auras.

I like owl because it can screech, that's a really good threat AND it's aoe AND it reduces incoming damage to pet. It's great for leveling, but as others have said, you're not going to be able to do dungeons with it
---
What's ur frost talent specs?
---
Exactly my sentiment too. If I get ganked by people around my level, even if it's multiple on one, good on em. You got me. But it's when people come in over 10 levels higher to stomp people who are basically defenseless that I get annoyed.
---
Each race speaks their own language except for Humans who only speak common.
---
All horde can speak orcish.
---
You can change your language so only other characters who know that language can understand it - otherwise it gets filtered into gibberish. There is currently no way to learn another language, it's just a trait of each race.
---
Yeah when u can pair it with fear it beats almost everything but lock with spellstone.  Mage can ice block
---
Getting the same issue. Kick from flight paths. 
---
Also I sometimes get stuck on loading screens. (Instances just won't load) I have to restart and wait for my character to become available to log back in again. Leaving the party allows me to go through next time.
---
An hour wait for a WSG isn't the best, just to lose minutes later was heartbreaking.
---
Dont need the comments saying 'you cant do that'. Im a level 23 currently being able to solo deadmines pretty decently, (obviously taking a while) but not wiping at every patrol/elite. So if you're just gonna post 'CANT DO IT' Please just leave.

An upgrade is an upgrade my man

I figured, but I can't find it by searching, figured OP might have it on hand.

Unironically believing Undead is better than Gnome... lol. You can‚Äôt be helped.

This has nothing to do with a monitor. This has to do with the fact you're gaming in your laundry room. Like you're litterally one step from a closet.

It‚Äôs been fun y‚Äôall.
---
&gt;Does anyone follow any specific guide for talent build 
---
Basically just make sure you get the Blizzard talent, it's the only one that's essential, other than that keep up Ice Barrier whenever you can.
---
&gt;or a general how-to? 
---
Run around on your mount, grab some mobs (try small pulls initially, work your way up as you get more confident/skilled), dismount, throw down a CoC + FN, then get distance and Blizzard them. The Blizzard slow should give you enough time for Frost Nova to get back off cooldown, then just repeat CoC + FN and Blizzard until they're all dead.
---
&gt;Apparently you're supposed to kill mobs that are green.. is that right?
---
Green monsters are advised because they have lower chances to resist your spells, and even one mob biting you while casting Blizzard can ruin the entire AoE pull.
---
If you are confident, you can definitely work your way up to tougher mobs.
---
The only thing you need to make sure of is that you are pulling ONLY melee enemies as the ranged ones will just shoot you from a distance.
---
Keep me updated. Experiencing the same problem. May do a ticket myself.
---
The top rank of the heal spell is the most efficient, so use that whenever it makes sense to. Renew is less efficient and available if you want to heal while running. You could also use it to complement the heal spell but that sacrifices some mana efficiency.

I mained druid the first time I played (early TBC), but the only character I raided with and got to max level was a prot paladin in Wrath. I've been leveling my druid some, and tanked WC, but I felt like the character handled like, well, a cow. On the other hand, playing my warrior, I love the feeling of combat. I go out of my way to kill the boars in Durotar cuz it's so much fun. But, when I tried to fight the MoBs in Skull Rock, I pretty much needed a potion to beat each warlock NPC, and got bodied by even a chain pull. This is with some greens that dropped for my other characters. 
---
I guess what I'm asking is, does it get better for either class?
---
At 42 do the higher level quests in Dustwallow Marsh and Swamp of Sorrows.  Then rotate between Tanaris and The Badlands.
---
You can't use a potion while casting, so to use one you have to stop casting, trigger the gcd, then start casting again. If on a fight you get one extra gcd dedicated to damage over using a potion, that's more damage on the meter. It isn't much, but if you do that over 10 bosses in an MC run, you are now much higher on the overall damage
---
Nah, just imagining the ugly mud aesthetics would give me a headache
---
there was a time back in vanilla days that GMs would intervene with this stuff, but the problem was they had to catch the person in the act, and ticket response times aren't very conducive to that. I think it stopped once flying came around and people could get anywhere, but since flying isn't a thing I would suspect they have a similar stance. Might be worth a ticket but just like the good ole days, I suspect they won't get to it until he's long gone.
---
Mage is pretty simple to learn, you'll be smashing one or two buttons for most of your "rotation"
---
In what sense? Layering is the only change from 1.12, isn‚Äôt it?
---
I've seen bad UIs but this takes the cake
---
Hunter or mage

---
As sad as it is for me to say it, honestly Backstab isn't worth it.
---
You need to both go Seal Fate and have some armor with set bonuses that grant energy on hit. Backstab is just such a costly combo point generator that you'll be struggling to even keep Slice and Dice up.
---
Hemo is good for PVP and dungeons IMO, but you need the heaviest slowest weapon out there to make good use of it. You could build a dagger swap macro for ambushes, but until you're nuts geared, daggers struggle.
---
A lot of murlocs are allies of the Naga, not to mention Vol'jin and the Darkspear tribe were nearly wiped out by Murlocs.
---
I say they're a problem for both the Alliance and the Horde.
---
Hillsbrad vomits wool, the fuck you smoking.
---
Great now put the fucking fire out
---
Who the fuck are you to tell someone else they can't play how they want. Why do you think everyone else wants to farm BiS or gold like you. Some people are happy camping a lvl 20 as a lvl 30 rogue all day and won't level past 40. I never said anything about you wanting to only kill equal level players, leave PvP players to PvP how they want.
---
Bib?
---
I can't advise you but it would help if you say EU or pacific or us
---
Where do you grind that? I was not aware there was a faction equivalent.
---
Not really, because most if not all of the characters hostile to Horde are also hostile to Alliance.
---
My point is if a person wants to play a Druid and also a caster, balance is most likely their best bet and WON‚ÄôT ruin the class for them.
---
Man I remember during the leveling experience on Grob we had a human Rogue and a dwarf spriest hang out there often but whenever me (Cailean UD priest) and a rogue went up there we rocked their shit and ganked allies for a while. I went around healing everyone they tried to kill while they were up to and wasted hours of their time lole.
---
They had orc slaves
---
No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not a gathering professing. It‚Äôs a class ability that you have to rank up. It‚Äôs one of the few class abilities you make money ranking it up (tips from lockboxes) when I rank my class skills up they cost a lotta gold. As a priest do I give out forts and renews to strangers? Yes. It‚Äôs part of my classes role. People have locks, you pick them, part of your class role. Typical solo rogue mentality.

Warrior didn't actually help. Tried to kill Verdan the Everliving. If you've ever been to Wailing Caverns. You know the shit I went through. This was at level 21. People that are dedicated can actually do decent things. Just cause you haven't seen it happen doesn't mean it doesnt.
---
go to classic.wowhead.com and look at the class guides
---
Sm has several small dungeons that make up the whole dungeon, grave yard is the first one and starts around level 30
---
I'll tell you how, in a bed not made out of twigs and straw in a house made of brick. We learned our lesson from the three little pigs it would seem.
---
Blizz is actually listening , they want to do classic plus as well. They likely search this forum daily for where Classic is going. Not joking , look at the last dev interview on Classicast.
---
Just YouTube man, there are a  shit load of guides out there.
---
I mean, if you can use it to solo then you're better than me, it just seems a tall order.
---
Perhaps "can't" solo isn't the right word, but "not efficient or advisable" is better. I guess I'd still go with a gorilla or owl, it's the best aoe you're going to get. Both aoe are damage reducing, so maybe gorilla for most tank
---
Had a 31 priest, got bored and rolled a hunter because I'm a proper casual. Currently lvl26 or 27, losing track.
---
Maybe there wasn‚Äôt a lot of tips to begin with. I mean you can state the obvious, but out side that? What‚Äôs left?
---
Even if it was a useless comment, which it wasnt, wtf type douchey of response is this?
---
The heart wants what it wants. ;)
---
To an extent, yeah, but there's a difference between vomit coloured BiS that doesn't look remotely rogueish even on slender female character models and having to wear a somewhat garish purple robe as a warlock or whatever.
---
Wel that... failed...
---
Rofl. QQ more pls.
---
Won't abilities like Claw, Charge, Thunderclap, etc. "compete" for mana? My pet should be constantly using Growl to maintsin aggro right?
---
It's because they were introduced so late. Nobody cared anymore with TBC around the corner
---
Lol like how you threw Hunter in there with Rogue
---
The biggest thing about druid is leveraging your versatile toolkit. You have a lot of amazing abilities, but they are limited by the forms you can use them in. Bash and wild charge are bear only. Roots, nature's grasp, war stomp, and rejuv/regrowth are caster only. Cat dps and stealth only in cat.
---
Being able to drop out of form and straight into another to use a form exclusive ability is the key. To start, I'd make a macro that's just cancelform. Keybind it to the same key on bear and cat and build up your muscle memory for it. You can put together macros for caster abilities like roots, natures grasp, moofire, etc by putting cancelform before them. Also make sure your bear and cat shift set up so you can't cancel it but pressing it more than once.
---
One important thing to remember is that leaving cat/bear does not trigger the global cooldown. That's why these techniques work. As long as the GCD isn't active, you can shift out and immediately use whatever ability.
---
Another important thing is the Furor talent. It's a key talent for cat dps and powershifting, but it's also incredibly important for bear. It gives you 10 rage, which lets you use bash or wild charge 1 gcd after shifting into bear.
---
So, knowing all that now, you can combine these different things to be the most slippery druid anyone has ever seen.
---
Shift bear, bash, cancel form, roots. With the right timing, it's 2 gcd's for a 3-5 second stun which leaves you free to root. Then you just travel form away. This is the bread and butter for running away, or starting to kite a warrior/rogue. If you already picked up natures grasp and imp natures grasp talents, you won't even need to channel roots.
---
The other stun combo for horde druids only is with war stomp. So say you're in cat or bear, cancel form, warstomp, natures grasp. Note that paladins have blessing of freedom and can dispel magic. So avoid them if possible.
---
Now, for casters like pesky mages, or hunters trying to kite you, you have 2 key tools. First, shapeshifting clears movement impairing effects. Concussion shot? Frost bolt? Frost nova? Say hello to travel form, recast if getting slowed from a distance to reclear cc. Second, wild charge. Just shift into bear (clearing slow/root) and immediately putting you in their face. Plus it roots them.
---
The last thing I want to mention is mana. Early on, running out of mana will ruin you. Shapeshifting is stupid expensive. To remedy this, have an addon that shows your mana while you're in cat or bear, and always know how much mana your shapeshifts cost at your current level. Int on gear, Heart of the Wild talent, and Natural Shapeshifter talent will ease these problems.
---
(some examples of feral macros from Shedo)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sOPzro2suaAJ0YOAA2GlNgT91GjW3OO-Qyx9_BuIn0M/edit]. the last one in particular should give you an idea of how to do basic druid shapeshifting macros. Sorry if the rest of the post is a mess. Kind of put down what came to mind as I was thinking about it.
---
Oh a wand, that's a hunter weapon at least.
---
Wait, this is an obvious mechanic? Isn't he talking about class interactions? Like, some other class casts a spell that makes it so when allies attack it they regain mana? That's not obvious. And honestly, retail has largely removed class interactions, as have most other games, because it's too complicated for people to understand, or whatever.
---
time a gouge so that it happens at the same instant as blink
---
use sprint and predict where they're going to blink to cover the ground in time to kick
---
use blind as a ranged interrupt for poly at a key moment
---
jfc people dont even know how to play this game and they trying to give advice
---
They're not answers. I asked for pet opinions and they all stated 'You can't do that'. Did you read the answers they gave or just my responses? Question wasn't 'Can I do these dungeons?' because I know I can because I have been doing them. The question was how to optimize. Clearly the classic wow subreddit is a salty area, including yourself.
---
When you look at enemies health with the addon, if you never attacked it, it will show as 100/100.  This is because the addon tracks the combat log to see how much damage is done to the mob and uses that to reverse calculate %, which is shown in the game.
---
Since you never fight your allies, the addons do not show you health.  The addons are actually doing math to figure out how much health a mob or pvp target may have.  There isn't some like hidden number that you can unlock with an addon in classic.  It's just a % that they correlate using the combat logs.
---
Short answer, no.
---
I was in ashenvale close to the path to felwood. So this alliance hunter runs by stops and have a look then puts an arrow in me ?? No chance on that one
---
Came here to say this
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
---
For the Alliance!
---
You couldn't do back in 2005 what you can do now, it was a more fair playing field.   
---
Today it's like Vanilla WoW version but with Retail AH Api.
---
Because chests don‚Äôt give you job specific mats. They give you treasure that everyone can benefit from. In you‚Äôre current group... of which you are a part of a team getting you through it.
---
I heard Hunters had to take care of their pet like actively.. I don't think I could do that.. I've not even been able to keep a tamagotchi alive for a day.
---
As I‚Äôve said previously on this thread; you can play the game however you want. Do what makes you happy man. 
---
I am simply giving you my opinion, which in my mind is the alpha theory on reaching god mode end game. 
---
Don‚Äôt get mad at me because you are beta.
---
This works both ways.  Killed 2 alliance priests in arathi (they were 39/40, I was 41) when they were killing the lower level folks diong the elite quests.  they called in their lvl 60 rogue friend to come kill me whilst I was fighting the elite mobs.  He still almost died as well.
---
Some people just cant take getting beat or outplayed.
---
Wow.
---
You are legitimately just a petty, bitter, selfish person.
---
Are you proud of that?
---
do I really need to edit and put /sto the end mr low iq ?
---
Where you're wrong:
---
You're assuming that a creature across a layer will automatically be killed by a player on that particular layer when it respawns.  That part of your assumption is closer to correct, for so long as the layer is up.
---
The difference (and this is the part where the assumption falls apart) is that layer abuse, even in the real world involves repeatedly killing and switching layers to kill mobs utilizing their respawn timer in a similar manner that someone resetting instances does it.
---
Instances may have a higher cap per hour per abuse, but look at what layer flipping in instances accomplishes versus real world layer flipping:
---
Instance flipping revolves around abusing the layer system to allow for multiple kills on the same enemy (boss, trash, etc...) for the  purpose of obtaining the resources they hold.
---
Open World layer flipping revolves around abusing the layer system to allow for multiple kills on the same enemy (boss, trash, etc...) for the purposes of obtaining the resources they hold.
---
The primary intent - abuse of mechanics for resources is the same regardless of the situation.
---
Actually needed the unending breath while doing my druid quest for aqua form. Made the journey out into the see relaxing instead of nerve racking.
---
All cause I motw some low lvl 12 warlock. Maybe he knew I was heading there. Maybe not. But it was nice.

its pre raid bis for those guys...so idk wtf u are salty about

Ahh Stunhearld, the days of "Omg yes!" and "CAN I GET A GOD DAMN PROC?"
---
According to the stats ive seen skeram is approx. 60k and Deviate Delight is 35k. So in reality not a massive difference especially considering the amount allowed to be logged on at once.

I had this shaman and warrior fight me (priest) and this warrior outside the Stranglethorn Fever quest. We killed the two of them *six* times before we were done and left. They just never learned

Wow. I would have thought that, that sort of thing would be forbidden in an unspoken way for too many reasons to name here.

Auctioneer was a thing back then. I remember looking for deals with it in vanilla.

Idk I have only lost 1 world PvP 1v1 as shaman so far an it was to a spriest. I‚Äôve fought every other class besides pally 1 v 1 at least once. (I‚Äôm lvl 33 for reference)
---
Read my comment again. My entire point is that I don‚Äôt even *need* more rage if a rogue uses evasion, because I get constant overpowers which cost breadcrumbs and hit like trucks. If I get two overpower crits on a rogue, it‚Äôs over.
---
I'm a big fan of dominoes myself and have been since WotLK.

If everyone here is salty according to you, you‚Äôre the common denominator bud.
---
Press seal, right click boss, press judgment sometimes
---
These people annoy me. Accepting that you decided to roll a PVP server while also criticising shitty PVP behaviour is not an inconsistent position. This sort of thinking happens in every game where PVP is secondary in the community.

Gnomer doesn't get you past 40 and the dungeon takes FOREVER if you do a full run or quest run.

Then why is Blizzard banning people for one and allowing the other?
---
One is creating resources and the other is simply creating more opportunities for already generated resources.
---
Also, Layers in the open world are finite. You can hope and get the mob/node you want every time but quickly you will run out of layers

I miss that.. nowadays people are just caring about min/maxing and optimize grinding.. It's sad, retail mentality.

Interesting. I was trying to talk to a human pally yesterday but couldn't as an Undead. I did see the languages that I know and figured that was it and maybe I just had to talk with him enough and maybe I would begin "learning" the language but I guess not. It would be neato if you spoke with another race enough that it would start to unjumble itself and maybe pick up on a few words here and there. Idk. Thank you though!

Not even thirty if you do the skip in Dun Morogh to get to the best XP / HR zone in the 10-20 bracket.

For sure. I am the unpopular guy who likes several of the quality of life improvements that came over time - not necessarily lfg but things like toy /pet /mount tabs. I'm a collector so bag space is always at a premium. Also I'm a druid so I need 19 sets of gear.
---
If that was pretending to be mature holy fuck mate you don't know what mature is.
---
Yes, I used to do it so much back in the day. I had a very clean princess, then jump down and start to kite goblin towards rootgrip and kill both of them simultaneously rout. My gear is not good enough on classic at the moment for that, I kill princess to slow for rootgrip to be in the right position. But this is a fairly easy and very reliable way for warlocks to make steady income.
---
That's not the point. If you have 2-3 friends and can cover at least healing or tanking, making a group is that much easier.

This is perfect lol

WoW Classic grinds were nothing compared to earlier generation MMO grinds. Compared to Asheron‚Äôs Call or Lineage, the WoW grind is super casual. Or that‚Äôs what I thought in 2004.
---
In 2019, as an adult with a job and responsibilities, the 60 grind will take me another month or more :) It no longer feels like the casual game I thought it was in 2004-2009 (practically speaking I played a lot less from 2007-2009).

Chat, sure there some weird twich reference I don't really get but most of it is really depressing. Imagine grownup 12yrs old that didn't evolve mentally. Trying to 'choc'' with every comment to appeal to the mass or choc them, I don't know its weird. 
---
As someone who've started playing in 2004 at 22yrs old, and mainly grouped with 18+ adult I had a hard time imaging 10yrs old playing this game but it clearly show in the chat on Faerlina.
---
It‚Äôs not that simple for Blizzard. Sure, they can make ‚ÄúGrim Batol‚Äù how it would have been for Classic, but they have to make something that *works with the timeline*. You have to sandwich the lore in so that it‚Äôs entirely different only 20 years later. 
---
As far as CoT goes, yeah, they never made much more sense so it wouldn‚Äôt need much to make it work for Vanilla. But as far as most ideas go, I think there‚Äôs a lot of factors Blizz needs to consider before it‚Äôs put in, much like back in 04.

Could this be occurring because of client vs server positioning desync or the rules they have in place associated with it to reduce perceived desync? I forget what it is called but the thing that make ice nova radius effectively bigger while jumping and moving.

wrong :)

horde is overrepresented on pvp servers, and alliance is more popular on rp servers.

Blink doesn't work like it did in the original WoW.  In Classic, it just moves you a little bit in the air and you start falling again.  I've tried it multiple times this past week.  It does reset your fall distance for damage calculations, though.

It's easier to use ice block near the ground.

I mean, i get it. Some people only have enough time for one run, and they rather keep face with their guild

I‚Äôm happy to toss a rejuv but I don‚Äôt want them to think I‚Äôm freaking out.

Right... we have that with Classic. If they‚Äôre too creatively bankrupt to design some potential cool works from Vanilla that never got finished, then they‚Äôre too creatively bankrupt to design the right gear, bosses, lore, aesthetics, and game design around the new content.

Then mage. Literally cast frost bolt =win. Just look up a talent tree for the single target leveling spec.

Well this post is about +healing vs +spirit and you said that +healing is a good advocate for downranking.
---
I‚Äôm all for that. People don‚Äôt really lump that in with Classic+ though. People are either vying for BC/Wrath and/or Classic+. Personally, I would hate to see a half assed merge of them.

Except the Kul'tiras so yes really.

Yeah. Me and my grandma snapped a meme of each other here recently when I went to visit.

It was a nice meme. She told me about her friend at the home who used to be a meme-ographer during the war. I told her our generations are so different because people my age call those meme lords. I love my grandma.

I‚Äôm all about whatever will give me a leg up in PVE mostly, the gold is sort of the cherry on top.

It‚Äôs there for you to play right now if you‚Äôre subbed.

Not a big, in order to fish in open ocean without a single lost fish you need a fishing skill of 425 or something like that. You get it from improved rods and aqua dynamic fish attractors or whatever they are called. Any further issues can be bumped up by the fishing hat and other items

Getting to 60 on some servers is easier than getting to 60 on others. 
---
PvE to pvp transfers are problematic. Low pop to high pop transfers are problematic. Why? Everyone would elect to level on a low pop PvE server and later transfer to a high pop pvp server. 
---
Paid transfers from PvE to PvE servers or pvp to pvp servers are fine if they allow it. The only restriction should be the standard no transfers to high pop or full servers at least for the first few months after launch. These servers don‚Äôt need more people (I say this as I pre-queue for WoW on Herod while still at work). And those who get easy farm from low pop servers don‚Äôt need to transfer in after leveling up quickly either (yes layering makes this less of a problem but from what a few friends of mine who transferred of Herod (full/high pop) to Earthfury (low pop) say, mobs are a lot more contested in Herod than on Earthfury despite layering).
---
TLDR: I won‚Äôt mind if they eventually allow it. But for now, no transfers into full or high pop realms.
---
&gt;Here I am...30 seconds a mob..
---
Just got your whirlwind weapon i see.
---
I generally get 1-3hrs a night. The mrs is totally cool with it because I'll do all the housey responsibilities first and when I'm playing WoW half the time she's sat next to me playing Sims. Also every 2nd weekend the younglings go to their grandparents. From friday to Sunday I logged a minimum 12hrs on the hunter :-)
---
Thank you, thats good to hear.
---
What is it?
---
Hey ya never know, I killed a 60 orc rogue on my 44 nelf hunter last night. It can happen
---
It's good xp, either through AoE farming or a quick quest run (with some nice item rewards thrown in there)
---
Mage isnt OP, this rogue is just pretty bad. Cheap shot opener is a bad choice against frost mage. Or anyone for that matter. Dont open with cheap shot boys!
---
What I'm saying is our dungeon nearby town isn't on the same level as theirs. SM can give so many good drops, has multiple dungeons, great quests and quest loot, and, on average, are cleared much quicker than gnomer. If the staff doesn't drop at the end of SM library, no big deal the group would probably stay together and help get it again. If the item you want from gnomer doesn't drop off the last boss, tough shit they probably just spent hours trying to clear through and have broken equipment. Time to reform the group. It's not only about leveling via dungeons.
---
Badlands or searing gorge, maybe?
---
The big rep gain is gunna be from cloth donations. If you haven't done  any of those yet, thats probably your next step.
---
However, I've heard that these aren't repeatable yet. So you might be at a standstill until a later phase.
---
Deadzone bleed and deadly poison kiting
---
I would 100% reccomend moonglow spec during phase 1, theres a lot of solo content you need to do to prepare for phase 2, with pvp system being implemented. This spec allows you to be proficient at both raiding and solo content. I am running this spec.
---
Do disc/holy priest build for PVP healing have the points to spare for dropping 5 talents in shadow?
---
100, capped
---
*autistic screeches*
---
Rather then rewards that are just straight up better then the last raid tier, maybe instead have more horizontal gear progression that do other builds in a classes more viable. A raid dont need to give players objectively better gear then what they already have. Give them other reasons to clear content, such as hard to get weapons that require many clears and new questlines with more "guild" and community driven quests such as more challenging quests figuring out puzzles, hoarding materials, more frequent community events etc. play on the horde vs alliance and so on.
---
You could also have stuff that only buffs older gear, lets say you need this set or item to make use of a rare item dropping in a newer raid. I didnt play WoW vanilla or much of the later versions so WoW Classic is a first for me so I will just give an easy example of an item this could work with but it can work with anything really. You get corrupted Ashbringer in Naxx. Lets say during an event or a raid in Classic+ there is a possibility to get a drop that upgrades the sword to the real deal rather then corrupted version. That makes older gear still relevant while new content is also desireable to get the items in question. Ashringer is just an easy example, but you see where you go with this. You could also place materials needed for the upgrade to drop in the raid they were found to be able to upgrade etc.
---
So you could have rare mounts as rewards, items that is just a new upgrade from what you have, but rather making other builds more viable, upgradeable items from older raids. Community events that gather guilds and communities alike that give special stuff only for the event period.
---
The replies to this from hordies are cringe as fuck lol
---
Well your memory is wrong, you could never ride in water so you never played classic, just saying. Im going to jog away on my mount now

No. You don‚Äôt know my family at all.  My point is that you‚Äôre a shitty person and that‚Äôs all.  I still believe it.

So fun fact, the Paralympics aren't called that because of paraplegics,, but because they occur alongside the Olympics. So Paralympics would be the dude who lives next to Mount Olympus.

Basilisks on the coast by the horde area I‚Äôm STV. The stacks there vary from 28s a stack to 76s

Regardless if you are from the Alliance, from the Horde or from the Scourge you can never go wrong with Lordaeron!

As a Horde player I can say cringey fictional faction nationalism is noticeably higher on the Horde side.

Hi I watched a youtube video and was speaking to someone and apparently some quest/race/class involved making a sort of ‚Äúdeath run‚Äù across the whole entire map for like an hour or something? What exactly is this all about and how do I get into it seems the coolest shit ever! Lvl 14 human warrior btw.
---
Mana Pot, Int Pot, Flask and MP5 food are a good start.
---
That makes way more sense!
---
My theory is spell batching, maybe only so many actions can be passed through a macro at once? But then everyone should be having the issue, not just me..
---
When I get through the queue I'll make sure I didn't fuck it up somehow
---
Oh shit, you got us.
---
For^the^Horde!
---
When you run through Blackrock Mountain on a PvP server
---
I collected innocent blood and farmer skulls.  Horde are villains let's stop the nonsense lol
---
The voodoo-like obsession of trolls would make them more like shadow priests than shamans.
---
Well the first game of thrones book came out in 96 so that's probably just a reference. 
---
As for the deathwing thing maybe they already had the concept for the expansion planned out in some form at this point? Who knows with them, seems like they've had concepts ready since the early Warcraft games.
---
Hunter pets cause a lot of critical strikes.
---
When protection Paladins get crit they get stacks of Reckoning, which lets them attack again, up to five times,

True, but idk if he is looking to pvp, pve or what. Maybe a little of both. Maybe pve with a bit of wpvp. I went based of what he wanted. A good economy and a populated faction.
---
Only an XP penalty.
---
Combat trap is borderline unusable and is a staple in pvp. They are still super op for leveling and dungeons even without combat trap. Pvp though.... i rerolled off my hunter for this reason. Ill pick it back up when they fix the bug.
---
Community interactions and **replayability** keeps me coming back.

That is the most bad ass thing I have ever heard.

Aye, more like Neverquest amirite
---
ty for summarizing the blue post to me, couldn't have figured out that it's different without u!
---
Lol you only need 8 of each. AH the remainder
---
I have a couple, but idk.
---
I remember it being a very low drop rate, and I've seen people farming the Spellbinder's in that tower so I'm just assuming that it still drops there.
---
That....was....beautiful!
---
What ever they said, it‚Äôs going in the book.
---
It‚Äôs 30% more damage on 40% of your white attacks as well as 3% hit. More value than you‚Äôll get from any other item alone, as well as BiS through Naxx. 1 item you can get now to last you through the expansion.

I kill undead rogues on site for the griefing they will do in the future. I know it's a relentless cycle but God I hate being ganked by undead rogues.

Why? I know I'm going to complete it. I've done it before. It's up to the community to voice where we want the direction to go in the future. My say is just as important as my guildmates who are clearing MC right now.

Alliance may be massive pussies, but a lot of Horde players are fuckin delusional.

A serious comment from some Horde player on my server discord:
---
&gt;Yeah but when the alliance can only win by 2v1 someone half their lvl...
---
WOW. SO ALL THOSE SKULL-LVL HORDE THAT GANK ME EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH 2 - 3 OF THEIR BUDDIES ARE JUST IMAGINARY, RIGHT?
---
Lol jesus.
---
Had so many whiners in Darkshire a little while ago. We had a small group of mid 30s Horde ganking at Raven Hill and it was like pulling teeth putting a Raid together to chase them out. 
---
So many people whining or making fun of me for trying to put together a group to kill a few people. 
---
I had a decent amount of takers eventually and we did manage to chase them to Lakeshire, where we slaughtered them.
---
Every horde on my server is KoS, watch it nerd
---
Yes, they drop it.  Took around 8hours for a guildie to get it.  Good luck
---
Thinking of my first alt. I want to be mobile and be able to do a lot of burst damage because high numbers are fun. My main is a priest and i want to be able to fulfil a role other than healing on the alt. Shaman and druid seem to be my best options but mages are cool for aoe grinding. I just cant make up my mind at the moment
---
I'm east coast playing on a west coast server. I usually get off around midnight my time (9pm PST) and everywhere is still packed. The LFG and world chat channels are constantly spammed with dungeon groups. Ironforge and Stormwind are full of people. I think you'd be fine swapping if you're finding that your server is underpopulated.
---
Warriors don't deserve these
---
Both Alliance and Horde should unite and annihilate the guild, treat it like the scourge and erase it from the world. Concider it worse than the Legion and Scourge.
---
I dont think you read the entire blue post.  They specifically stated that this isn't the reason for misses.

That just hurts how wrong it is - even though it is just a parody

Not really, the best races for PvE are orcs and trolls.
---
The instanced ones are simply the most excessive over-reach by players.  Blizzards own words:
---
"As a reminder, Blizzard‚Äôs End User License Agreement 5 defines cheats as ‚Äúmethods not expressly authorized by Blizzard, influencing and/or facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods.‚Äù
---
As always, thank you for your feedback on this matter.‚Äù
---
Your thinking is that blizzard is allowing it.  Blizzard simply may have taken on the largest problem first.
---
So you ran a dungeon with shit players big deal

Perhaps our wand is just cat form? Although I guess that is slightly mana dependent.

Have they said their reference client was 1.12.0, 1.12.1, or 1.12. If it was the "final backup", it was probably 1.12.1. They also said in an interview that they explicitly chose to go with the older mount system intentionally because that is how it was for longer of the game's duration, ignoring what was in right before 2.0.
---
We were running a dungeon the other day where my priest friend who normally does heals was dpsing, and he hit a crit mind blast on herod... Needless to say herod popped that speed potion buff thing he does and ran right for him and basically one-shot his ass.
---
Thanks for confirming what I thought!
---
The one upside is the longer I grind, the probability of me seeing it goes up so I have that.
---
They sure did. They said people didnt have banks full of black lotus. Which would be a huge issue. My only point is that layering and abuse of it in the open world effects the economy. Somehow through pure witchery (i.e. putting words in my mouth) this dude made it seem like I was saying it was equal to dungeon layer abusing or that it was breaking the economy. I just said it has an unfortunate effect on the economy. That will likely be short lived. But it will create some uber rich people
---
Prefer to be shaman. Master class. But I wanted to be a night elf. But shamans are so fun!!! But i want to be a night elf. 
---
Ultimately i picked night elf rogue since that is what I was in vanilla. But i really want to be a shaman.
---
He doesn‚Äôt want people who haven‚Äôt done it before and that is entirely reasonable. Not all runs are teaching runs
---
I don't know why this is a discussion. You are assuming that both sides have an equal amount of support, when that's not the case.
---
The "need = use" crowd is **significantly** larger than the "everyone should need" crowd. The last representative poll I've personally seen showed a supermajority of people (3/5) support needing for using it on the spot and if you want to sell it you should not need it.
---
Don‚Äôt let them get you down, cofresi is dope.

---
Man that UI makes me want to vomit
---
I plan on doing so much lowbie killing that I tip the scales single handedly
---
It's mostly a problem for night elves. Because Deadmines is in Westfall, many players like to level in human lands. As a night elf you have to take a boat and run through Wetlands, which causes you to die a lot because of the much higher levelled mobs.
---
It's not really "fun". The death run is means to an end. I suppose there is some fun in trying to survive as long as possible but still. It's long and arduous.

From someone who‚Äôs not played retail since cata, BFA just looks like a dress up simulator with extra steps. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more to it than that, but it really looks like this transmog thing is the most popular part of wow. That kind of says something. When the most important thing in retail right now is how you look, yet in classic it‚Äôs the complete opposite. Hahaha

Gotta admire the hustle, at least. I love it when people never give up on fighting back. Keep that fire alive!!!

You're absolutely correct--and it's funny to watch the justifications continue to roll in. 
---
"You can't use these 'meme specs' in vanilla because the raids are too hard!"
---
*MC is cleared without a full 40 60s*
---
"Well yeah, MC doesn't count because it was a super easy n00b raid! You won't be able to do it in BWL though!"
---
Let me see if I can guess what will come next.
---
Seriously, the underestimation of the general skill level of players these days vs. what it was in vanilla is hilarious. Anyone who has done full clear normal mode of modern raids is already ahead of where the average players were in vanilla--by a huge margin!
---
they weren't following orders, they were magically compelled until they resisted it and killed their oppressors. then they left for their own continent after freeing themselves from alliance slavery.

---
Im level 50, everything is still being camped. Both horde and alliance always fighting for respawns even in high level areas.
---
I feel bad for older Horde players. A lot of reformed former teenage edgelords who are finding that their favourite faction is now the younger community after being taken over by the new generation of teenage edgelords.
---
I xferred from kirtonos onto earthfury to play with friends and its been great. Its not massively populated but its easy enough to find groups and it is wayyyyy easier to quest. If youre a high level its also easier to make gold because you have access to the higher level items and gathering reagents. Its only going to better too. 10/10 would recommend
---
This was nerfed during AQ though, even before Naxx dropped.
---
I have another for your priest: Please don't throw renew on me right before a pull, especially right before a group pull that's 100% perfect way for me to have to blow my aoe taunts when the fight has barely started
---
Whats funny this time around Horde has the Fortnite streamers playing it and so there will be a large number of kids over there now too. On top of Horde's warmode reputation from retail, I wouldnt be surprised to see a shift in age demographics per faction.

I personally think it's funny, but it's also ironic since he basically admitted being butthurt by the issue with this meme.

But yes, the alliance can't meme.
---
From what level?
---
I use 1 resto druid 1 healing priest and 3 aff locks to 5 man. A voidwalker does the job if you watch threat and a succubus or two for cc.
---
You probably won't get exalted from quests alone. When you get to level 51 you can start turning in stacks of runecloth for rep. Any reputation you skip just means more money you'll have to spend when you hit 60 to finish off the grind. When you're outside of a dwarf zone look for dwarf and gnome questgivers, some of those quests will reward IF rep even though it's more human or nelf territory. 
---
I'm getting a kodo on my undead, but I kind of gave up on grinding quests. In a wild guess I've missed 3-4k rep and it will end up costing me an extra 100g
---
I don't know, that's good question. Generally I would only advocate going shield/mitigation/CC/mark tanking if dps tanking doesn't work. If dps tanking does work, slow mitigation tanking is just strictly worse - unless your aim is something other than to complete the instance as easily and quickly as possible.
---
THE Todd is always hot.

But comments this deep into a Reddit post?  Okay

Sick, congrats
---
Okay yeah I think that‚Äôs my problem as well. I‚Äôll immediately lock on as soon as I see them take a hit. After they clearly have aggro is it safe to spam aoe? And is there a set number of seconds before I can attack or do I have to gauge it? Thanks for the info
---
I was there for 2-3 hours and only got ganked twice but maybe because I‚Äôm a rogue.
---
This is usually a good thing, as you can log out during downtime in raids to preserve your consumables and worldbuffs.
---
For warriors even if you tank, the prot skills ranks are a waste. You use them to up the threat.
---
Sure doing 25 damage on Revenge is better than 17 (that's an example, lowering more armor with an upgraded Sunder is the same), but it doesn't add to revenge base threat so It's almost pointless.
---
Better to get mount.
---
Only use frost nova rank 1, unless you're dueling.

I can't really argue against that mostly because I'm not really into the meta, I just have fun killing dragons and storming/defending the castles in Cyrodill

How much gold do you need for a mount and training at 40?
---
because its no fun if i cant actually tank stuff. the fun in tanking is getting attacked

Ok?  Rogues are a pure melee DPS class.  No one should be better than them at melee.  Warriors can tank, and in no way should ever out DPS a rogue.  But that's Vanilla for you:  Super-boner for Warriors.

OSRS revamped the passion and the playerbase. Aside from the obviously brutal grindy nature of the game, its really quite fun.
---
I think Trade Master Skill 4, the profession part? Not sure, I'll need to check

What server you on geek?

I call people for help with Pvp BECAUSE it's a pvp server and I love having big PvP battles. 
---
I love Hillsbrad battles. Getting hunted in StV. I love it! But I do call for help!
---
Is this some kind of joke my server is too imbalanced to understand.
---
Get this Alliance bullshit propaganda put of my fucking face
---
Imagine thinking you're not the villain
---
what do you mean by that? can you elaborate?
---
Good ‚Äòol WoW strangers giving unsolicited relationship counseling.
---
Man, my brother realized the other day that he wasn't going to have time for raiding in classic.
---
I was like...you realize we never bothered to raid much in retail vanilla, right?  Our end game is level 19 and 29 BGs homie.
---
Why is my hearth set in Gadgetzan if I am still running SM?
---
In Vanilla, my first 60 was a Shaman. My second 60 was a Paladin. Raided with them both. The people that think they make that much of a difference are silly.
---
Some guy was trying to sell a 4 agi 3 stam cloak for 35g. He was publicly ridiculed.
---
Ah gotcha. Well I just realized my main problem is going to ham with the spamming and not waiting for the tanks long enough
---
I don‚Äôt mind it when it really is in game. Like... if I‚Äôm on my undead then I‚Äôm all ‚Äúdeath to the alliance!‚Äù. On my night elf and it‚Äôs ‚Äúbring it horse scum!‚Äù. It‚Äôs a game and it‚Äôs all good fun.
---
But the ‚ÄúI would never roll alliance they‚Äôre all a bunch of asshole racist pussies, I KOS and spit on every one I see‚Äù people need to take a big step back from things.
---
Does that counterspell works on any kind of spell or just fire and frost? I've never use it before
---
Yeah I'm really happy they added straight backed trolls and orcs in BFA. I don't want to have scoliosis irl AND in game.
---
I don't recall AC1's grind being worse but them again its been a long time.
---
The grind on everquest on the other hand, ugh.
---
Normal people play the game how they want to play it. Which for him is multi boxing.

Can I get a tldr?

The high age of Alliance players is noticeable, and kind of annoying

He means it's weed smoke.

Finally, someone brought IQ into this

also maybe will freak out a bunch of lowbies in senjin lol

Alliance hoes be mad
---
What is my purpose? I give water breathing. YOURE GONNA TAKE IT AND YOURE GONNA LIKE IT!

Preferably 20 levels higher also
---
I generally fuck with everyone I see, even people way higher level that will 100% kill me. It can't be helped, really.

1500 upboats for a frost mage scraping a win against a combat rogue 1v1. my fucking sides man. losing that matchup should warrant an auto character deletion for the mage

I seriously doubt that‚Äôs why it was removed.

Frodo: He's up to something. [Gandalf acts nonchalant] *All right then, keep your secrets*. But I know you have something to do with it
---
So now defeating your opponent has stipulations?
---
A win is a win, no need to publicly bitch about it.
---
Wait till the mage has used blizzard a couple times and have less mana
---
Its true, most Alliance are late 40‚Äôs early 50‚Äôs but we horde are spry 35 year olds.
---
That's like saying Superman is the foil NPC to main character Lex Luthor. While I'll admit that Luthor is morally more complex, I'm happy to play Superman and clap the horde into jail at the end of every story.

I'm a lvl 40 mage so far. I've noticed that whenever I use sheep in PVP. It always breaks early and doesn't go the full duration even though it isn't DRed yet. What is the exact time for when it breaks on first cast?

Yeah but out of all 40 players, he was number 40. Terrible... Take a lap.

VC is way better then WC, ironforge is extremely close to all end game content except AQ, have the access to the best racials, including priest racials. Have paladins.

Oh, I thought this bug was new to classic, didn't realize it was in vanilla too. I might try it out and see how much it affects me personally. Thanks!

Only smart hord know how make good joke, just like make good mud hut

You can replace immolate with any spell.
---
Dear tank. L2P
---
Exactly the way I feel playing Alliance, NE is the best choice but even that isn't a great choice.
---
Being cringy as a joke and being cringy in earnest are exactly the same level of embarrassing, imo.
---
Wand is decent filler damage. You can also juke interruptions. If your mana is okay it's acceptable to try to get off a heal if you are locked out of shadow, but I wouldn't recommend it if you got a rogue or pet on you. You can kite using blackout as a distance getter.
---
Yeah sure! 1 29 21. I'm am able to tank, dps or heal all 5 man dungeons with the right gear. Also you can fight nearly every class in pvp.
---
there's no set amount of time, just keep an eye on all the mob's hp and gauge it that way. no one's going to kick you if you're doing single target for 5-10 seconds
---
If I could play drenai I would!

somehow i feel like dwarves are the potheads not gnomes, they seem more... methy

Do people not have threat meters?

I hate to be the "this" guy, but... 100% this. Literally every time me or someone else calls out wpvp these are always the replies. The only times I've ever seen a pvp group has been one that I have made myself with guildies/friends.
---
good luck predicting when they will chose to go out of their block with your grenade cast time.
---
I think the VW has a taunt ability, you can toggle their abilities to be auto on/off. 
---
I think they start on, so if you want greater control, just...right click (I think) the ability to toggle it.
---
I'm sure there's macros, but idk those.
---
As a hunter should I pretty much prioritize agility over everything? I know stam/spirit is good too but should agi take priority?
---
Ahhh the good old forum wars... It had to also be here.
---
What do you miss about Alliance the most?
---
"Gnomes were significantly more likely to initiate PvP against the opposing Faction, when compared to all over classes."
---
I see Gnomes have evolved into a class of their own now
---
How exactly is it hard mode on a PVP server?
---
My server (despite what the population thread says) seems to be filled with Alliance everywhere that is ganking me quite often on my Horde Toon.
---
I can't even do quests in STV due to them outnumbering us 3 to 1 over there.
---
Imagine the dusty ass footprints all over our beautiful city when we got back to SW. Yuck.
---
yea it gets stale if you put in long hours in eso like wow, plus the dailies are slowly getting annoying
---
That is really fascinating. I thought it‚Äôd go Rogue, Warlock, Hunter, Mage, Warrior, Paladin, Druid, Priest, Shaman
---
What race did you stick with?
---
For those of you curious how it was done, I ran to teldrassil using the Dun Morogh to Wetlands skip at lvl 1. As a mage, hearthed to IF at lvl 10 to learn spells for the first time, and then continued in teldrassil till level 12. At 12, I relearned spells and did every quest in Darkshore/Ashenvale. I also did every BFD quest. There was a few rep quest for Darnassus in Stonetalon, and at later levels some in Feralas. Then at 60, I just farmed gold, bought stacks of runecloth for as cheap as possible till I was exalted, and then farmed the gold via devilsaur leathers and mining. I could have AOE farmed in WPL for gold and runecloth but it is always so congested. 
---
Used classic DB to help find a lot of the quests too. Link below.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?faction=69#quests:0-2-7+1
---
Hell yea üòÖ
---
If tank had threat meter installed I use mindblast because i know when it is safe to use.
---
You‚Äôll get a Voidwalker later on and it has abilities to taunt an enemy so it can hold aggro more. Let your pet attack a bit before you do and try not to do too much damage and it‚Äôll hold the enemy on it.
---
Still do this
---
you wouldn't be here defending your *superior* memeing abilities if you weren't feeling threatened by this 11/10 meme
---
Yeah, I couldn‚Äôt imagine playing alliance
---
That's what you get for rushing to end game so fast
---
You overextended man. My and all my friends from high school all started again, I switched servers to play with them, and now they haven‚Äôt logged in in a week.
---
Point to where I said incorrect statements please
---
At level 10 you'll learn to summon a voidwalker, which has an ability that will help it retain aggro better.
---
For a macro to make your pet attack on one of your attacks, look up petattack macros.

why the hell are you playing on our server if you arnt about it???  gtfo to carebear server OMEGALUL

Bye
---
I heard pandarens will be playable in burning crusade.
---
That sounds pretty problematic. I might still try a hunter and see how it goes, but it doesn't sound too promising. Thanks!
---
does this work on the flame imp?
---
you misspelled horde
---
People love Classic for things like class identity and faction pride, but the down side to faction pride is tribalism - people start to perceive those who aren't part of their group as inherently different in some way. For instance, thinking that members of the opposing faction "only gank me when they're five levels higher or with two of their friends," and that this behavior is more exclusive to one side over another.
---
Thanks for doing this survey. Ally and horde both engage in the same types of behavior, which is apparently a hard pill to swallow.
---
holy shit that was amazing ahahah
---
your point is valid but I enjoy leveling.
---
The funny thing is, Classic runs in the modern client so they could probably just flip a switch and give us unlimited buff/ debuff slots. But they've said no changes until phase 7 at the earliest so that's how it's going to be.
---
Nope, not possible
---
I sure as fuck can be mad, lol. I can't control what he does, but I can be mad.
---
&gt; Screw this, this time i'm out. 
---
Later!

Fuck the horde

---
&gt;Having the summoning stone simply makes it easier to either replace someone who leaves or get to the instance faster
---
Yes, but that is a big difference. People will not commit as hard to the dungeon because its easier to get there and also kicks will be in effect because replacements are easy.
---
Then be mad. And then get over it.
---
My guy, you gotta look at that character for a long time and level 17 can be done in a day. You're better off re-rolling now to a face you don't hate.

Do people use regular fire protection potions at all or no?

Its unbelievably useful. I dont have rank 3 yet but rank 2 is still killing it for me.
---
Have you tried retail WoW, I hear it has no queues and is BUG FREE
---
Wut
---
Both are viable, comes down to play style and how much extra gear you want to carry.
---
I'm with you though, Heart of the Wild is the more versatile build for soloing and gearing up. It's what I'm running and can tank or heal dungeons just fine and can solo grind pretty well.

Maybe it is just anecdotal BS, but I dont work half as hard healing a bear. They hold threat on multiple targets like champs and dont take much in the way of heals to manage.

trying to tell a warlock I need to worry about the number of HOTS I have on me LOL good one. Like I said this is a non issue affecting a very small dedicated precentage of players.

Hellfire rank 1 is level 30.
---
This is how my groups do it whenever they need something CC‚Äôd. Seems like the best strategy IMO
---
I can recall myself sitting there just before Cata launch and waiting to visit this zone. One of my favorite places in retail WoW.
---
well maybe but queue seem to be as bad on any of the first few server that were up for name reservation.
---
This was always my thought. Sure Alliance will get a lot of the really young, but the 14-20 year olds probably go more Horde. Not sure about adults in retail though. Alliance in classic does seem to have a lot of adults but I don‚Äôt know how that compares to Horde.
---
thank
---
am i the only one having trouble reading htis?
---
Classic has been out for a month. What are you waiting on?
---
They already said no to original plans for Emerald Dream, they'd have to do something new because their original plan they hated, it was all green and very annoying.
---
its the only real way to get better.
---
I am a simple Horde Player, I use hunter's Mark on this post and proceed to loose myself in a fit of berserking rage.
---
I think your problem here is that you put points into that talent. Useless.
---
I love it lol
---
Totally forgot about that line
---
You can go into the keybindings and change that.
---
My whole 2nd action bar is ALT-Q, ALT-W, ALT-E, etc.
---
Actually built by Arthas. Thats why its scourged up and not just a grey drab human sewers like the ruins above it.
---
And it's also their real world time. You're pretty insane if you think this is actually something to be this upset about. Like take a step back and read what you're typing over a 15 year old game
---
As a developer, that blue post made me happy - troubleshooting with the help of customer repots is huge - it was a fun read
---
I'm actually kind of annoyed. I'm horde OCE but there's literally no server I can play on as horde that isn't horde favored unless I play on a pve server. Alliance need to come the fuck to the PVP servers.
---
oh no, isn't he the one who went and reported people who he didn't like on all his 40 characters and getting a people banned?
---
This was in WoD I think
---
And the majority of mages playing right now are just bad. I see soooooo many mages spam mana shield against spells. Hardly see wards being used and a lot of mages just panic and arcane explosion spam until they die.
---
Are you hitting shift 1-0 when you program the action bar keys?  (I know this seems obvious)
---
Are you hitting okay after?  I‚Äôve had so many times where I just close the window and it doesn‚Äôt save.
---
Agreed. "Low effort memes" is completely subjective. Their definition is that if it is not inherently classic related when you remove icons and overlays, its low effort. That is bullshit. Ill take a photoshopped funny meme over a Classic screen shot with a memey caption any day. This moderation is *garbage.*
---
Full disclosure: i just had a meme i posted removed, so maybe im a little salty.
---
I had to create a macro to thank people for buffs and such as it happens so often that it‚Äôs tough to type out a thank you before they are gone.
---
Kid you have a lot to learn about the internet, till then keep your stupid shit to yourself, we don't want to hear it.
---
? its a shaman belt
---
&gt; in peace
---
thats not how this works
---
I know right!!
---
Lmao. Ahhhh. Thanks
---
Have you seen female Tauren? Or Orcs for that matter? THICCCCC.
---
Well to be fair i mostly agree with you except when opposing faction is grinding up resources that you want to fight over, there‚Äôs a PvP solution for that. Versus, oh well nothing I can do he‚Äôs not flagged.
---
Dude.. I STILL love this :D
---
That‚Äôs nuts but well done! Looks badass and I‚Äôm jealous.
---
Neither the troll now tauren leaders are evil, the order leader guess on and off, and sylvannas only recently became totally evil.
---
I literally did all the quests there, and just got the quest to go back for the egg...
---
Todd Howard is looking fine
---
I had a mage bitch at me yesterday in Searing Gorge because I pulled 3 quest mobs at one time on my Priest. I was like I don't really know you, but I guarantee you're a hypocrite lol
---
The time it takes to do 1-17 is like 31-32
---
I have, I have set up ones just seeing if some bright spark here has something quite handy to share
---
But these art/gameplay reasons hold up in wow. The boss is bigger than average character so that he can stand out
---
Team Solomid?
---
Which part of the ToS?
---
&gt;They should be taking down 4 mobs in that amount of time as standard play.
---
That's my point. If I did unserstand them right, they were *exclusively* talking about the aoe part of their grind with no mention whatsoever of the solo kill potential. For all we know they could be killing mobs one by one within 5 seconds, farming around 40 mobs in 3 minutes. Presumably that's not the case, but they point is that they never talked about their solo kill speed. At all. All they said was that every 3 minutes, they can melt down 4 mobs. How fast they can farm solo mobs (or smaller multi target pulls, or whatever else you might think of) in between those times was simply never mentioned.
---
It is a lot of different things. Some happen in late 20s other in 30s.
---
RFK has a godly 2H weapon right around 30 for those who do not do the WW axe grind. Slam, intercept, berserker stance, and whirlwind are all in the 30s which add a lot to your damage variety. Shield wall is a great oh crap button as well as challenging Shout. SM and RFK have great mail items which make you feel like a warrior and not some weird guy in spirit mail gear.
---
Or: How to advertise every single other server at once.
---
All these add-ons existed in vanilla.
---
In vanilla there was an xyz speed hack you could use to go anywhere instantly...  Took a while to ban those people...
---
And Target macros to snipe mobs are possible without add-ons .
---
What are you escaping from, Dave?
---
Any activity that amplifies single player wealth can negatively affect the server economy depending on scale. I suspect it will mostly be short term (in terms of asset monopolization) but what will carry over is the wealth those few individuals have. Since they were ahead of the leveling bell curve they would have already been rich but the option of layer abuse on amplifies that wealth. I dont think its as bad as some say it is, and blizz has confirmed that, but to say it doesnt effect anything is outright wrong
---
This should work, you'll just have to deal with the new "existing spell active" error after the correct one is cast
---
I value both their opinions!
---
It's an option in bagnon
---
"They're gonna have blood elves join the horde. No idea what the Alliance race will be. Definitely won't be draenei though. That'd be retarded."
---
-Rough estimation of something I said in Redridge back in vanilla
---
Same here! Gonna level in shadow prey village when I get home so hopefully there is a warlock to hook me up for the cage quest üòÅ
---
The first step is to stop making these posts
---
Rogues are even more ridiculous.
---
Lmao Hastings Street, nice one Vancouver.
---
nah man they're gonna release classic + for $150 and then add a shop
---
no one knows their intentions, they're interested in other expansions and/or expanding classic but they have no full plan yet, they're taking feedback from the community
---
guess I should have made my research before joining there, but it isnt that bad for now. Hope it keep a high population over the years, have been playing retail on a dead server forever and its depressing.
---
Which is weird, I thought it was the exact opposite.
---
Your so mad :D
---
We need CONTROL to face the stuff for you guys. I always let rogues pickpocket right before I pull and I always turn mobs so they can touch their bums. That being said we can't do these things because the mass influx of idiots playing classic as the new it thing don't care about anyone but themselves.
---
That doesn't [always work.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d46cqv/mounted_highlevel_tried_to_gank_me_prot_vs_arms/)
---
1. Anyone know how pet leveling works? Does the pet gain exp separately? So for example i'm lv50 now and i catch brokentooth. Hes lv37, can i just go to SM/Uldaman runs and he'll level up? Or do the mobs i kill need to be near my own level?
---
2. When you die and are a spirit, can you see stealthed enemies/players if you walk over them? If you are alive and walk over a stealthed person you'll see them, when youre a spirit you can see people around your dead body, but can you see stealthed people around your dead body?
---
so i have a undead warrior, gnome warlock, nelf rogue, what should my next caster be?
---
Level 6, living her best life.
---
I will always pass on an item if someone in my group wants to equip it. Back in vanilla that happened to me in my beneft on more than one occasion. I would rather see someone be happy then me get some gold
---
You are asking about the pre-assigned hotkeys of additional action bars? Well, they have none. You will have to venture into the menus and assign some yourself.
---
Personally, I would recommend some addon for dealing with action bars. Bartender is one I'm using at the moment. With bartender you don't have to go digging in menus. If you write "/kb" you can assign new hotkey to any ability on your bars by simply hovering your cursor over it and pressing the desired hotkey combinations.
---
Damn, using the g-word. Shit just got real
---
I think it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre overlooking the fact that orcs are not an analog to any real life race. 
---
Orcs literally invaded a planet that was not their own with the explicit intent to wipe out whoever was already there. 
---
When the orcs were interred they were the remnants of an invasion force.
---
Gmod is nothing but a weasel breeding pit ngl
---
Yes you could. All these posts complaining about certain addons not being ‚Äútrue classic‚Äù when they were in fact in classic is just showing how bad you were back then or how bad your memory is now.
---
step 1: frost nova 
---
step 2: gtfo
---
Imagine wasting 4 other people's time because you can't spare 5 minutes to read a guide and figure out your 1-3 button dps rotation.
---
My buddy is a Druid and he kills other druids all the time. What's the issue here?
---
While levelling it‚Äôs perfectly fine to enter dungeons as an enhancement DPS, shamans bring some great utility to the group (earthbind totem, windfury, manaspring, etc) at 60 groups/raids may be more hesitant to invite an enhancement shaman over ele/resto as their utility doesn‚Äôt really justify the lower damage they do compared to other DPS classes and resto shamans are the best multi person healers in the game due to chain heal.
---
Did yall do much instance farming, or predominately quest?
---
We didn't have to pay to gain access to Classic outside of the monthly subscription.  What makes you think they'd charge for the expansion packs, especially when a huge chunk of the development work is done?
---
Don‚Äôt be BOBO be IFHO
---
It's not. There's a huge empty area between Stratholme and Deatholme on retail (yes, I know the Ghostlands isnt actually connected to EK). The maps of the Ghostlands and EPL dont line up at all.

gnomish engineering level 301

How would you even know something like that?
---

---
That's some dedication
---
I would give gold if I weren't a proud member of the Horde. 
---
Ah fuck it. Have some anyway.
---
Classic wow is really a game about gang culture disguised as a fantasy mmo.
---
A) I'm not comparing the games, I'm comparing the situation. If you knew anything about it you'd see the parallels i'm referring to. 
---
B) I'm not sure if you even read my post but I never said that the magecleave spam was an issue, and in fact was advocating just what you said. Who cares is correct, I'm talking about coming together as a community to discuss what might work best going forward and not alienating people who don't have the exact same opinion as you.
---
C) This is exactly what I detailed in my post. I'm aware that people behind #nochanges were aware of the flaws and wanted it to stay that way. I'm not even arguing for class changes, balance changes, or anything of the like. I'm advocating for breaking this shortsighted attitude and moving forward to create the game we all can be happy with. I'm aware some people want an exact snapshot of how classic was, and would be completely content playing that forever. However it is unrealistic to think that the majority of the player base will want that forever, and even more unrealistic to think blizzard would let the game die for those few.
---
My individual experience doesn‚Äôt confirm anything. What does confirm this post is the sheer number of salty comments with horde flairs that I see in this thread.
---
bur
---
My track record so far in fair fights is pretty one-sided, the only times I've really died to whored are outnumbered or out-leveled, frequently both. Try picking on people your own level cowards.
---
Woah you can talk shit about durtar all you want, but dont you EVER shit talk mulgore
---
Some demons are immune to it still. Check out necrotic addon and when you click a demon it will tell you if you can enslave it or not. Also tells you which mobs are immune to fear.
---
1. You are correct. 2. Idk
---
You may be right, but posty still the real god
---
There it is. Sooks.
---
I'd just add if you win a blue/purple on a need roll, you shouldn't need against someone else who hasn't won one.
---
trees put me to sleep, bright sherbet orange hills keep me alive
---
The racism in RP servers is what always kills me. I would always rp as racist to gnomes. I would always spit on them, and then tell them that I saw them and it wasn't an accident. Word got around and mages started opening portals to places that were the farthest from where I actually needed to go.
---
You took time off for a video game. Instead of taking time off to be with family or travel the world. Maybe Blizzard doesn‚Äôt have a problem...
---
it could have been so good, there hasnt really been another class in any game that has resonated with me like disciple of khaine, the whole vampie debuff enemies to assist allies felt so cool and powerful you could do so much  to influence a fight
---
He wouldn't be successful if he wasn't.
---
My people :(
---
Depends  on if it's a populated server and how many people in what ever city you're in.
---
I liked wotlk best, before lfr came out.
---
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying - a real one and a paper one? Care to explain for me? :)
---
I tried so hard to like gw2, it was such a beautiful looking, but it just sucked gameplay wise.
---
ok on the flipside of this, sometimes it just.. aint my fault, i mean it is but... listen  
---
i watch you pull the mob, i sheep the moon/square if needed, i wait until the mob has taken a bit of damage and i see a sunder or two on it. i start casting frostbolt. it crits, mob immediately turns and chases me.. im sorry i didnt expect my first frostbolt to crit
---
Seconded
---
And we thank you for that.
---
Welcome to classic!
---
ARE YOU HONEYDICKING ME???
---
No hot keys, auto attack in slot one. Yes this is a real boomkin here.
---
A "group" larger than 5 it's called a raid. A raid is comprised of multiple groups. There is a penalty to xp earned by members of a raid. This is the crux of the issue with early classic raid farming that was hot fixed. The raid penalty to xp wasn't being applied and the group xp bonus wasn't being removed. This resulted in many players exploiting the system to join several dungeons as raid parties and clearing them extremely fast while receiving xp gains many factors higher than intended.
---
Question, would you rather be friends with a mage that does this or a mage of the opposing faction that can properly understand threat levels?
---
So jealous I didn't abuse this haha. I'm 50/50 on whether I like the slow grind like the good ol days or I just want to set myself up to be a level 60 beast
---
Wait can you tell me how?!?!?
---
Lol.
---
You wouldn't know a proper shattercombo if it hit you in the face.
---
The game begins at 60 for sure
---
What are you farming and how? I am starting to go crazy not knowing what to farm myself and aoe seems so boring.
---
lol really enjoyed your writeup. good stuff
---
They‚Äôre really just  desperately asking but their exclamations are bugged to question marks.
---
Yo mine was David Hasselhoff swimming in the spongebob movie and I said it‚Äôs what swimming with autorun feels like. I‚Äôm still salty that meme was a work of art and possibly the most intelligent thought I‚Äôve ever had
---
Cutting away from somebody yelling and then having them be audible in the background gets me every time.
---
Maybe on a fantasy game in a fantasy world, where there are warlocks of destruction and champions of the light, some people find being someone risen from the grave or a savage bloodthirsty orc warrior is more appealing than being a walking baby (gnome), being a purple human with pointy ears, or picking "human" is just lame.
---
Props to dwarves y'all are still cool AF. And if taurean didnt have warstomp I wouldnt understand why people play those either.
---
I‚Äôm sure you absolutely believe that.
---
Awesome thanks
---
Thorium Point didn't exist in early vanilla, so Thelsamar was the closest FP to Blackrock Mountain if you had the key.
---
Ty!
---
Second for bartender. Its fantastic.
---
That‚Äôs is why I kill EVERY single Horde player I see.
---
this is racism
---
getting deleted by two people eight levels higher than me and a hanger oner, yep.
---
Sounds like a good use of time, fuck on off out of here with that attitude
---
4 levels is more like thousands if that's all you've done.
---
Oooh, if they're not even opening with a stun your priorities should be as follows. 1. Rend, 2. Disarm. You have now prevented them from vanishing or fighting for 6 seconds and that's more than enough time to dunk a rogue's brains against the pavement. They can't even blind you as disarm insurance because their own bleeds will break it. Bleed spec rogues are highly dependent on catching a warrior offguard and getting his full cycle in before the warrior can properly react. A proper reaction will bury them every time (unless they're a dward).
---
take boat to menethil, swim out towards dumn morough and die in the water, respawn IF
---
That where i have been farming, just eas double check if there was any proof
---
there is also an ingame option you missed that is built in and doesnt go thru bnet. Also AFAIK it teleports you to nearest graveyard unless you are a race in the wrong zone and haven't set a new hearth.
---
eg i did it from SW dwarven district to try to get to goldshire faster on a gnome and ended up back in coldridge
---
I won't eat them, but I will gladly and sadisticly gouge out every one of their eyes as a reminder to that foul race just how much of a plague they are to everyone that encounters them, past present and future.
---
Death to all murlocs!
---
If players abuse layer swaps the herbs in each layer will be picked sooner thus starting the respawn timer sooner thus more herbs on the AH total, compared to if everyone had to wait for the respawn timer in their own layer with all the inefficiencies that creates. So it is creating new resources, just not as crazy fast as the instance exploit did.
---
&gt; Depending on your fishing skill, you will either catch something (which will appear in a standard loot box) or the fish/item will get away. 
---
There's no "caught nothing" option.
---
??????
---
Stockades is the best low level zone. It's by far the best XP/hour, enough that server first dungeon leveling groups forfeited an hour of running to run it instead of the Horde instances.
---
Honestly the way this feels between wc3 and wc3 is hilarious. It's like you play wc2 and the horde is nothing but enjoying the demon bloodlust and destroying everything, allying with the most evil factions on azeroth etc. 
---
Then you start wc3 and it's like "all that destruction from a seemingly unsalvageable race of invasive species from another world and you PUT THEM IN INTERNMENT CAMPS!?" Its supposed to be a harsh world of evil races and they didnt just exterminate every last one except the children? At least then you might be able to at least educate them from the get go. 
---
Then horde players complain about even that. Lol.
---
What people dont realize is that in this universe just like in lord of the rings -- it's a virtue to be racist against orcs lol
---
I think 3 or 4 sounds most reasonable, but let's be honest, I'm 95% sure blizzard either didn't think about it, or didn't care, haha
---
A glaring example of Alliance privilege. Just wow. Making excuses for generations of colonization, enslavement, unhindered violence, unabashed hatred. Typical Alliance supremacist. Racist scum.
---
*smash you in the face with body sized Sylvanas pillow*
---
Reported.  Involuntary Pornography.  I appear in this image.
---
The other white meat?
---
looks like stockades pretty much lol
---
Skinning and Herb. Good money, free swiftthistle and fadeleaf, and with mining + herb you‚Äôll be wasting so much time just running to nodes
---
I hated the combat system in gw2 and made the mistake of playing the beta where nothing worked and it kinda left a sour taste.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve never complained (about this game). Some people are just complainers and they‚Äôre still complaining to this day
---
Someone say Toddy? https://clips.twitch.tv/TawdryObeseMousePanicVis
---
side note.. as a pally the OP is stall fighting that spider to this very day
---
"I need, it is an upgrade" in regards to BoE's should never apply to non-BiS. Should always be group-wide need rolls. When you come across a BiS BoE, then it is really up to the group. I always vote the AH Value of an item FAAAAAAAR outweighs the "upgrade" value, so everyone should have the chance to roll on it. This is why guilds exist, to avoid this scenario. Run with your guild and make it known that you are running for said item and would be awesome if people didn't roll for AH.
---
I‚Äôve always been Horde. I‚Äôm trying to play Alliance just to play some different leveling zones for a change. Every time I see a human I straight up think ‚Äúwtf, why is he here and why didn‚Äôt the guards attack him?!‚Äù Then I look around and I‚Äôm in freaking Stormwind. The world‚Äôs gone mad.
---
first thing i saw when running into wpl for the first time on classic, 3 naked low level allies running towards uc
---
The only low level profitable recipe I've found is the blackmouth oil because it's needed for other potions. But even those are being undercut hard on my server in the last day or two.
---
&gt;Hell, I think a large portion of the population would be fine with a total rework on the pvp system.
---
You have to be a purist to the Nth degree to truly believe that classics pvp system should not change or be reworked or improved. It‚Äôs legitimately one of the worst-designed systems I‚Äôve EVER seen in any game.  Absolute nonsense top to bottom.
---
Yeah, the nag hammadi scriptures have a very different teaching that orthodox Christianity. They were lost until 1945, buried in the deserts of Egypt to stop Romans from destroying them some time around the 4th or 5th century ad.
---
Gnom-eregan
---
Yes, because that's not a meme, that's just an insult.
---
They've already said wrath or bc classic is being strongly considered.
---
Or you can play retail for the same sub. Get to 60 and it's free.
---
But stop making these dumbass posts. There's 2 years of classic content ahead of us. Enjoy if for 2 years and blizzard will announce what's coming when it's coming
---
I love the resiliency.  Repairs are expensive.  I'm broke :(
---
Have you read the horde flaired comments though ;)
---
Oh shit brb
---
Quest up to 38-39 and farm rumbling exiles
---
fuck dude. this is definitely worthy of a platinum or gold
---
PURPLE DAWN IS HERE
---
Reroll on a PvE server
---
All them frostbolt rotations lmfao
---
Liquid cringe.  You can buy it on Amazon super cheap atm.
---
when did i say there's a caught nothing option? honestly at this point i have no idea what you're talking about or what your argument is
---
I rolled T Druid and I have been enjoying it but I hear a lot about how they are difficult in pvp and don‚Äôt put dps anything in pvm. I enjoy it‚Äôs mobility for questing but can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm rolling the wrong class. Should I turn around now and try to roll a mage/lock/warrior or is Druid better then the guides make it out to be?
---
Yes... That's why I typed it?
---
Don‚Äôt play a mage so I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm curious what‚Äôs this 2 button rotation they did?
---
Yikes
---
This is why Classic+ can be so promising. They don't have to follow the original lore. They will probably create brand new things, and personally, I think thats for the better. Imagine them making a real story in the Outlands, instead of just killing some of the best characters that were created in WC3. It'd be fucking dope
---
tellmewhen
---
It is all grind lol
---
That‚Äôs even worse.
---
Ignore me. I can't type.
---
I have had this happen once!
---
I immediately let all of General Chat know what a hero he was.
---
I reported it.
---
I played original GW + Expansions and loved it. GW2 didn't feel like Guild Wars at all. It makes me sad :(
---
Whoever reported for irony is my favorite person today.
---
Classic plus
---
How could blizzard wait that long before adding such a feature lol
---
You don‚Äôt care? So you think this will last forever? That you won‚Äôt get bored in a few years?
---
Upvoted. Thoroughly enjoyed and would read again.
---
Yes, I prefer to initiate the pull as a tank. Watch for me to take aim and that's when you should start casting, so that your cast finishes after my shot goes off. Good thanks will move the mobs away from the sheep. Good dps will know not to hit it.
---
Naw male orc rogues are bad af.
---
Lordaeronians*
---
You know, the undead......
---
yeah i‚Äôm on a usually medium RPPVP server and was trying to get through these today and was fighting over every tag AND the drop rates were just awful
---
know your role and heal me bitch
---
Yeah Staysafe has a video of him doing it.
---
it was a joke.
---
Dear Paladins:
---
Very interesting. Thanks for the explanation!
---
I'm so glad I can just ignore all the weirdos that talk like that.
---
Ah that makes sense. The clear difference being a raid vs party, etc. Thank you homie
---
how? it's a boe, do you really think i'm going to let a mage take a staff of jordan because it's good?
---
It's pretty reasonable to accept you're not good at it, it's far better than whining about being ganked too much.
---
Lmao I was so annoyed at the end of my work shift
---
This is why rpservers
---
I played on a little white MacBook with the lowest possible graphics settings and weird graphical issues until early 2008, when I built my desktop. The first time I logged in in Shattrath I actually cried seeing it in its full glory with graphics cranked all the way up. I just went back and rode around my favorite spots in Kalimdor and EK just... looking at them. So many zones are very lovingly designed.
---
This meme format is an abomination.  Don't @ me.
---
nobody plays female orc.
---
PvP servers tend towards Horde because Horde have the best racials for PvP. PvE servers tend towards Alliance because they have some good PvE racials and paladins make a lot of things easy mode.
---
I fully respect and appreciate your sacrifice for the greater goods. But I also solemnly wish you good luck in your adventure.
---
With that said, mod why you not banning this guy yet!?
---
ohh didnt know about this website! from the way im reading these macros they have for warlocks alot of them are made for clicking with a mouse which is no Bueno and they seem to be missing alot of QOL ones am i able to add mine to it as well?
---
I too am a gnome warlock. It‚Äôs the first time I ever rolled one and last night was the first time I ever initiated PvP LMFAO.
---
Hey I watch your YouTube videos sometimes, I didn't know you were a mod here. dope.
---
That‚Äôs a phase 2 thing
---
Are you being intentionally dense? If you start the game up, and your buddy is online, the game tries to put you into their layer.
---
\&gt; You made that happen by swapping layers. 
---
You did not. There's 0 promise that the mobs aren't ALSO dead on that layer, you aren't doing shit. Plenty of times ill switch layers from an invite and MORE shit is dead than where I was. You keep throwing around "If" they arent dead. If. if. if.
---
With the dungeon exploit the bosses WILL be alive. It's calculated. There's no give and take with the chances. You only take in that situation. Youll hop layers in the over world and it \*might\* have more, it \*might\* have less, but it \*probably\* has about the same. You can't intentionally hop to a layer knowing there are live units without taking more time out of your day than what it would take to just wait for a respawn. 
---
Streamers and well-known people are able to exploit it because of the sheer number of players that will follow their beck and call. If Asmon wanted to traverse every possible layer, he could by just asking his chat. You cant do that. I can't do that. 99% of players can't do that.
---
Just think about what your goals are and do things that let you do that.  
---
The main things to think about are your cds, your enemy's cds, your energy regen and DRs.  
---
So yeah it's going to depends completely on your spec, enemy spec, gear, cds, gear etc.  
---
&gt;Sap &gt; Cheap Shot
---
This is often done in the context of CS without attacking (and breaking sap) just to build combo points. So sap -&gt; CS -&gt; restealth CS for 5 CP opener, or alternatively an expose armour and restealth.
---
&gt;Gouge &gt; Stealth
---
Gouge isn't enough to restealth off against any class with an instant cast that puts you in combat. You can against a warrior normally if they're crip poisoned and you're in deadzone (ie they can neither melee you or charge you).  
---
&gt;Vanish &gt; Cheap Shot
---
Keep in mind if you do this your cheap shot will now be on DR, and so will your Kidney if that's your plan. Normally not a good idea.
---
&gt;Gouge &gt; Backstab
---
Against a warrior you'll need to keep in mind what stance they are in, because if they're in zerker they can zerker rage to remove gouge, but otherwise they can't.
---
Often against a warrior the plan is to open, get a 5pt Kidney on them, they will trinket that and then you reset and attack when you can get another 5pt Kidney without DR where you can thistle/CB evis etc.   
---
Using your CDs like sprint/evasion/blind and tools like deadzone kiting are ways to achieve that - and rupture to prevent bandaging. Doing a fake kind of opener with CS-&gt; hemo -&gt; gouge -&gt; rupture + vanish is pretty common. This is basically a reset but they start with -2k hp.
---
&gt; Bloodthirst doesn‚Äôt care about weapon damage and faster speeds smooth out rage gen.
---
Neither does Mortal Strike. Basically all instant attacks that scale off of weapon damage are normalized for attack speed: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.8.0#General
---
With this in mind the hammer is actually the best weapon from that quest because it has the highest DPS. That is assuming you're not taking any of the weapon specialization talents while leveling ‚Äî if you do take them, just take whatever reward matches your chosen specialization.
---
that's weird man because i've gotten the no loot thing in retail for a few expansions now
---
Flask of Supreme Power gives 150 SP for 2 hours. Requires 30 dreamfoil, 10 mountain silversage and 1 black lotus

Good stuff.

Nvm i am =P i will add all of mine to it as well

Pet XP is in the pet page of the hunter character info IIRC.

/u/PhoenixVersion1 meant Swiftthistle Tea.

I'm unmanned after messaging mods.  I have a screenshot if you need it.

Good for you and your brother.  Changes nothing.
---
I'm a mage and i still haven't found a decent place to farm solo..
---
for hunters it only applies to Wingclip. we got off easy.
---
Well, yeah, but that's meta-gaming. Done the intended way, it doesn't make sense to have the port with an allied city so far away from the capital.

Lol where
---
C fg~~~~
---
Im finding to fun to quest to once lol. I keep tailoring up with me as I level so Im never in a rush to hit 60 and I turn down AOE cleave group offers since it just feels so boring to do personally. Just enjoying the world and people in it has been fun for me
---
Good job fellow hordie.

BUT THIS IS REDDIT

How's his wife ?

I main a gnome and I think most people in Alliance wished we were gone :(

Hmmm sounds good, guess I will keep looking!
---
That's the spirit of BC not classic.
---
It's cool in theory, but in practice only a clique of no-lifers can challenge another clique of no-lifers
---
actually the correct answer to ‚Äúhow not to advertise your guild is‚Äù
---
‚Äústop spamming your guild in trade / general / lfg chat asshole, nobody gives a damn and you‚Äôre drowning out everything else. and stop whispering me because i‚Äôm guildless. if im level 45 and not in a guild, i obviously don‚Äôt want to be‚Äù
---
Imagine living in a mud hut in 2019
---
I got to lvl 6 on Thalnos before I switched to Thunderfury xD
---
Didn't know it went out that far, thanks!
---
Happens to me somewhat often but I play on and don't qq. Solo leveling a warrior and get ganked all the time.
---
"Low effort" is too subjective. The rule should be specific enough to be enforced consistently.
---
I've had no performance issues maxing out settings on my potato laptop.
---
Also some of the factions seem kind of random.
---
Don't get why people complain about print screen.
---
I can clearly see you're a gnome who farmed Darnassus rep for a tiger mount. Bravo.
---
Horde handed him and his scrub followers their asses today lol
---
lol, we have no idea how his house is or how their work schedules are etc, maybe the only other place is in the bedroom but he only has time to play at night and the wife works early? There could be tons of reasons for this.
---
...except the basis of Soul Link is a magic effect... dispellable by dispelling the pet... which priests can do . . . ?
---
Hello?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13243/argent-defender#comments with shield spike is possibly better than skullflame
---
Who cares? That's not comparable at all to once per week limited raid bosses.... Those Devilsaurs would have died regardless on any layer and there's no limit on how many you can kill. It'd be idiotic (and impossible) to ban people hopping for regular mobs.

I'm a shadow priest who just started making shadoweave gear at lvl 47.  The tooltip in the character page applies all of the +shadow damage to my shadow dmg wand but the numbers I'm seeing don't match.  My question is, does +spell damage affect wand damage?
---
I'm horde and I absolutely aprove this post.
---
However, You're all still a bunch of PoS, alliance scum. You ganked me on hillsbrad as a Grey and I will never forget I will literally piss on your skills after I reach level 60 I will add every person to my friends list so I can track your down and exact my revende no one will escape the fury of my holy priest you will all pay for being so dishonorful this is disgusting how can you live with yourselves loktar ogar pathetic meat bags I live by a code of honor you goddamn nerds and I will not abide while you murder innocent horde who just want to murder alliance citizens for their skills 
---
Warhammer Online still has more enjoyable PvP to me.... Being a Black Orc and throwing people off of the top of my castle never quite got old. Sucks that game relied so heavily on player counts being high... they never did quite get their numbers under control, and all the damn movement/getting stuck bugs...
---
Silithus, EPL and WPL, and Winterspring
---
Has happened a few times in this cave in Teldrassil :(
---
Yeah thats a sick rotation in theory, but in my groups as soon as i charge the 3 dps open up on three different targets.
---
Easy! Just get a BoE Epic to drop and sell it for 3000g on the AH. ezpz
---
That happened to me too on my warlock. Accidentally aggrod a slime and got the pattern lol
---
This is the real reason that it's on the table.  Blizzard is WELL aware of how wildly successful OSRS is, and it's not even "basically classic+", that's literally what it is in the context of Runescape.  Blizzard likes money, and knows how and why Jagex made a shit ton of money on OSRS.  That's why classic+ is a possibility.
---
Because he streams it I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Auctioneer dies this, but not in real time.

You need to go to the ah and do a scan in auctioneer often to keep it up to date.
---
In with, as a healer, your job is to keep people shove, not topped up 100% all the time. Heals over time and Shields can mitigate and as others stated, using lower level versions of heals

Nah the issue isn't the advert or the guild. It's people freaking out over nothing.
---
It's the first one announced
---
They did, and retards still don't believe it unfortunately.
---
It's not really even rushing for me. Like i'm not spamming shit or abusing aoe farm. Just playing hunter going to each zone and doing every quest before i move on.
---
This guy plays wow in his tauren furry suit.
---
GW2 fell the moment it came out. Shit's awful, yo. GW1 is far better and still quite played.
---
What a fun ride.
---
Well I mean, aren't you playing to have fun? This mentality kind of ruins the enjoyment of games. Go do whatever you have fun doing, there's plenty of time to level.
